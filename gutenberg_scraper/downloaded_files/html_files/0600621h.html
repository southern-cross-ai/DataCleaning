<h3>THE VOYAGE OF ABEL JANSAN TASMAN, 1642.</h3>

<p style="color:#006600">This very curious and important voyage has
been published in different languages, but the most circumstantial
relation is that of VALENTYN;<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b> his
relation does not appear ever to have been translated from the Dutch,
though many <i>abridged</i> accounts of TASMAN'S voyage have been
published in French as well as in English. VALENTYN having married
into the family of the secretary of BATAVIA, is supposed by that
means to have had access to TASMAN'S original Journal. The charts
inserted in VALENTYN have not been published by any of the editors of
TASMAN'S voyage; DE HONDT'S collection contains some, but not all the
views. I have used VALENTYN as the text, but have collated his
relation with DE HONDT'S collection, the editor whereof says he was
in possession of the MS journal; with THEVENOT; with the English
translation from DIRK REMBRANDT, published with sir JOHN NARBOROUGH'S
Voyage, etc. 8vo. LONDON, 1711; with that in Dr.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>TASMAN sailed from BATAVIA on the 14th of August 1642, with two
vessels belonging to the Dutch East-India company, the ship HEEMSKIRK
and the ZEE-HAAN pink; he went first to MAURITIUS, the south end
whereof lies in 20&deg;. 20' S latitude, and in 78&deg;. 47'
longitude; by which he found that it lay 50 miles more to the
<i>eastward</i> than their reckoning, which makes 3&deg;. 33' in
longitude<b style="color:#0000FF">[2]</b>.</p>

<p>On the 8th October TASMAN left MAURITIUS; from that time to the
22d he went S, to 40&deg;. or 41&deg;. S latitude<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[3]</b>; finding the variation to be 23&deg;.
24&deg;. and 25&deg;. W.</p>

<p>From thence, to the 29th, he steered between S and E<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[4]</b> to the latitude of 45&deg;. 47' S and
89&deg;. 44' longitude, and found the variation here to be 26&deg;.
45' W<b style="color:#0000FF">[5]</b>.</p>

<p>On the 6th November stormy weather, with hail and snow, and
extremely cold, the latitude 46&deg;. S<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[6]</b>, longitude 114&deg;. 56'; the snow and hail
continued till the 17th.</p>

<p>On the 8th, in 49&deg;. 4' S, 114&deg;. 56' long. the variation
was 26&deg;. W, the weather hazy and squally, with a hollow</p>

<blockquote>[2) Campbell says he arrived at Mauritius 5th of
September, but the period from the 14th August seems too short for
the passage from Batavia; Valentyn does not mention the day of his
arrival at Mauritius; they all agree that he departed from thence 8th
October.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[6) Valentyn says, "6th the latitude by account was
49&deg;. 4' S, longitude 114&deg;. 56';but on the 8th he mentions the
same latitude and longitude: De Hondt says the original journal, in
his possession, gives the latitude 46&deg;. S. which I have
adopted.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 67}</u></p>

<p>sea, from S W and S, so that no land was to be expected upon three
points of the compass in that quarter.</p>

<p>On the 15th, in 44&deg;. 14' S, by account 136&deg;. 53' long. the
variation was 18&deg;. 30' W, which decreased every day in such a
manner that on the 21st, in 152&deg;. 22' longitude, it was no more
than 4&deg;<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b>.</p>

<p>On the 22d the compass kept traversing eight points, so that they
imagined themselves near some magnetic mines; the latitude was
42.&deg;. 58' S. They had a very heavy sea from the S W, so that no
land was to be expected near them to the southward.</p>

<p>On the 24th, in 42&deg;. 25' S. 163&deg;. 50' long.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[2]</b> land was discovered, bearing E by N<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[3]</b>, ten miles distant, which TASMAN named
ANTHONY VAN DIEMEN'S LAND. Here they met with much bad weather, and
then stood <i>south eastward</i><b style="color:#0000FF">[4]</b>,
down to 44&deg;. S, along the coast, which then runs E, and
afterwards NE and N<b style="color:#0000FF">[5]</b>.</p>

<p>On the 1st December they anchored in 43&deg;. 10' S, 167&deg;. 55'
long. in a bay, to which they gave the name of FREDERICK HENRY'S
BAY.</p>

<p>On the 2d December, early in the morning, they sent the master,
FRANCIS JACOBSZ, with the boat, having in it four musqueteers and six
rowers, each with a pike and cutlass, together with the ZEE-HAAN'S
prauw and her mates, with fix</p>

<blockquote>[1) Valentyn gives no account of the voyage from the 8th
to 22d; De Hondt says, "the lat. on the 15th was 44&deg;. S, long.
136&deg;. 53';" Thevenot, that the lat. was 44&deg;. 3' S, long.
140&deg;. 32'. Variation 18&deg;. 30' E. Campbell says the lat. was
44&deg;. 33' S. Variation 18&deg;. 30' W. He agrees with Thevenot's
longitude. Both these authors say the long. on the 21st was
158&ordm;. but I have followed De Hondt.]</blockquote>

<p>musqueteers, into a creek or bay, which lay N W, a full Dutch mile
from them, to see if they could procure any fresh water, provisions,
wood, or any thing they wanted.</p>

<p>They returned aboard about three hours before sun-set, bringing
several kinds of vegetables, of which ,they saw great abundance, not
very different from some found at the CAPE of GOOD HOPE, and which
proved very good pot-herbs; another sort had a saltish taste, was
long, and pretty much like parsley.</p>

<p>The master and the others further related, that they had rowed a
full Dutch mile round a certain point, where the country was high,
but level, with plenty of herbage growing spontaneously, and wood in
great abundance; a sloping watering place of running water, and many
clear vallies likewise with good water, but very difficult to fetch,
and that but a little at a time, taken out with a bowl.</p>

<p>They saw no human creature, but they had heard not far off human
noises, and likewise musick, as of a trumpet or small <i>gong</i><b
style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b>.</p>

<p>They had likewise seen two trees, two or two fathom and a half in
girt, and sixty or sixty-five feet high; the bark had been scraped
off at certain distances, by way of making steps to climb up them<b
style="color:#0000FF">[2]</b>; but being full five feet from one
another, they concluded them to be the work of men of an uncommon
stature; and in one of the trees the steps seemed to be quite fresh,
and even green, so as to have been lately made, perhaps not above
three or four days.</p>

<blockquote>[1) <i>Gong</i> is a kind of <i>cymbal</i> used in the
eastern islands; some of them are of a great price, the best are made
in the island of Java; they are of a mixed mettle, and are used
instead of drums. The Chinese have flat gongs of copper, which they
use for salutes, etc. but they are in no estimation amongst the
islands.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[2) To climb up to the birds-nests. C.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 69}</u></p>

<p>They had likewise perceived the traces of wild-beasts, not unlike
the claws of a tyger, or some such creature, and even brought on
board excrements of quadrupeds.</p>

<p>They further saw on the ground some, but very little, gum, which
had come from those trees, resembling <i>gum-lac</i>. About the
corner of this bay the deepest water was thirteen or fourteen feet,
and the ebb and flood hereabouts only <i>three feet</i>: many gulls,
wild-ducks, and geese. What trees they saw were but thinly sown and
extremely incumbered with underwood and thick bushes: they heard the
noise of the abovementioned fowls up the country, but saw none. There
were several trees which seemed to have been scorched by fires having
been kindled among them.</p>

<p>They likewise, at times, perceived smoak towards the W by N, and
men of an extraordinary size had been plainly seen from the ship; a
great deal of smoak was likewise seen along shore.</p>

<p>On the 3d, ABEL TASMAN caused a pole to be set up with the
company's mark and a Dutch flag: for this purpose he took with him,
to the S E side of the bay, the master, FRANCIS JACOBSZ, Schipper
GERRIT JANZOON, ISAAC GILSEMANS, supercargo of the ZEE-HAAN, ABRAHAM
COOMANS, the factor, and PETER JACOBSZ, the carpenter; but the surf
and hard gale of wind hindering their landing, the carpenter alone,
swimming ashore, performed that service, and set up the pole near
four high trees<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b>. The variation here
was 3&deg;. E.</p>

<p>On the 5th December TASMAN sailed from VAN DIEMEN'S LAND
<i>eastward</i>, intending to continue that course from</p>

<blockquote>[1) I have given Valentyn's relation of Van Diemen's Land
at length, although it does not properly come within the limits
prescribed, but appertains to <i>Papua</i>. I have not, however,
inserted his chart or other plates of this country.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 70}</u></p>

<p>169&deg;. to 195&deg;. long. in order to find the SALOMON ISLANDS:
he could no longer keep the land aboard, because the wind was
contrary<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b>.</p>

<p>On the 9th December, in 42&deg;. 37' S lat. long. 176&deg;. 29'<b
style="color:#0000FF">[2]</b>, the variation 5&deg;. E. Some days
after, very hollow seas from the S W, so that no land was to be
expected southward or south westward.</p>

<p>On the 13th, in 42&deg;. 10' S. 188&deg;. 28' long.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[3]</b> he had sight of a very lofty and mountainous
country to the S E, fifteen miles distant, which is now in the maps
called NEW ZELAND, but TASMAN gave it the name of STAATEN LAND, from
their <i>High Mightinesses</i> the <i>States</i>, and as it made a
sightly appearance, he conceived it to be the <i>southern
continent</i>, and this passage he distinguished by the name of ABEL
TASMAN'S PASSAGE, as first discovered by him<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[4]</b>. He found the variation here 7&deg;. 30'
E.</p>

<p>He coasted along this country north eastward<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[5]</b>, and on the 17th and 18th December came to an
anchor in a bay in 40&deg;. 50' S, 191&deg;. 41' long. variation
9&deg;. E.<b style="color:#0000FF">[6]</b></p>

<p>Here, in a spacious bay, three or four miles in breadth,
<i>eastward</i> of a small sandy point, and a good mile from a
certain point of land in the lat. of 40&deg;. 49' S, long. 191&deg;.
41', he saw men of a thick set robust make, and very rough voices,
but they never came within the reach of a patterero, but several
times blew an instrument which had something of the sound of a
trumpet, and in answer the ZEE-HAAN'S trumpeter was ordered to
blow.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 71}</u></p>

<p>Their complexion was of a yellowish brown, their hair black and
coarse, closely tied over the crown of their heads, after the manner
of JAPAN, with a large white feather sticking upright in it; some of
their cloaths resembled mats, others cotton, but the upper part of
the body was quite naked.</p>

<p>Our people several times made signals to them, by way of inviting
them aboard, holding out to them some white linen and knives, but all
to no purpose, and at last they went away.</p>

<p>On a signal from TASMAN, the chief officers of the ZEE-HAAN came
on board, when it was determined to go in-shore as near as possible,
there being good anchorage, and the people appearing disposed to a
friendly intercourse.</p>

<p>No sooner had this resolution been taken than they saw seven barks
coming from the shore, one with a high sharp head and seventeen men
in it, near the ZEE-HAAN, and another manned with thirteen stout
fellows came a-head of TASMAN'S ship, within half a stone's throw,
both calling several times to one another, in a dialect quite
unintelligible to our people, not agreeing with the vocabulary given
to them, which was that of the inhabitants of the SALOMON islands<b
style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b>.</p>

<p>Here our people again waved the white linen to the Indians, as an
invitation to come on board, but they continued lying on their
paddles; on which the master of the ZEE-HAAN sent on board his
cockswain and six hands, in a small prauw, to give notice to his
mates, that if they should be for coming on board, not to let too
many of them come at once, and to keep a good look out.</p>

<blockquote>[1) By the vocabulary of the language spoken by the
natives in the <i>Salomon islands</i>, Tasman probably means the
language of <i>Horne island</i>, which Le Maire gives under this
appellation.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 72}</u></p>

<p>As the ZEE-HAAN'S prauw was going on board, the <i>prauw</i> which
was next to one of the ships waved their <i>pangayes</i> or paddles,
and called out to the other, which lay behind the ZEE-HAAN, without
our people being able all the while to comprehend their meaning.</p>

<p>When the ZEE-HAAN'S prauw was got at some distance, their
<i>prauws</i>, which lay between the two ships, made at her so
violently, that about half way from ABEL TASMAN'S ship they ran their
beak against the ZEE-HAAN'S prauw, so as to make her heel gunnel to
and take in a good deal of water, and the foremost of these villains
punched the cockswain several times on the neck with a long blunt
pike so that he fell overboard, and others with thick short clubs
(which at first we had taken for clumsey <i>parings</i><b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b>) and their <i>pangayes</i>, falling on our
people, mastered the prauw. In this attack three of the ZEE-HAAN'S
men lost their lives on the spot and a fourth was mortally
wounded.</p>

<p>The cockswain and two others swam towards ABEL TASMAN'S ship, and
we dispatched our boat away, which brought them safe on board; the
murderers very fortunately for us left the prauw.</p>

<p>One of the dead they had taken in their <i>prauw</i>, and thrown
the other into the sea; we fired very warmly at them with our great
guns and small arms, but without hitting them.</p>

<p>6C In the mean time, IDE TJERKSZ HOLMAN, TASMAN'S skipper, went in
a boat well manned and armed after the ZEEHAAN'S prauw, with which he
soon returned on board, finding in it a dead man and one mortally
wounded.</p>

<blockquote>[1) <i>Parangs</i>, a kind of large <i>chopping
knife</i>, used by the natives of the eastern islands for cutting
wood, etc.]</blockquote>

<p><b>View of ABEL TASMAN'S BAY on NEW ZEALAND in 33 fathoms water</b></p>
</center>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 73}</u></p>

<p>We have given a very neat plate of one of there murderers barks,
together with its villainous crew, and also a view of the
country.</p>

<p>In commemoration of this melancholy event, TASMAN called it
MURDERERS BAY, and seeing no good was to be expected here, he sailed
away; but soon after, twenty-two barks came towards him from the
shore, on which he fired several times at them, but to no effect; the
ZEE-HAAN hit one who had a <i>small white flag in his hand</i>, so
that he fell down, on which they all made the best of their way to
land: two of their barks had sails, like those of a <i>Tingang</i>.
In this bay they had anchored in 40&deg;. 50' S.</p>

<p>Hence he again steered E N E, where on all sides he saw land of a
very good and fertile appearance, but had so much bad weather and
westerly winds, that it was with no small difficulty he got clear of
it<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b>.</p>

<p>On the 26th December he again steered N, a little inclining to the
W.</p>

<p>On the 14th January 1643 he came to the lat. of 34&deg;. 35' S,
and 191&deg; 09' long. where, near the N W point of the land, they
met with a very strong current, which drove them <i>westward</i>, and
very hollow seas from the N E, from whence he</p>

<blockquote>[1) The account in Campbell, etc. is considerably
different from this of Valentyn, but I have no hesitation to prefer
Valentyn's relation.<br>
<br>
Campbell says, "this country appeared rich, fertile, and very well
situated.<br>
<br>
"On the 24th, the wind not permitting to continue the course to the
N, as they were uncertain whether any passage was to be found that
way, and as the flood came in from the S E, it was concluded to be
best to return into the bay, and seek some other way out; but,<br>
<br>
On the 26th, the wind becoming more favourable, he continued his
route to the N, turning a little to the W." C.<br>
<br>
Valentyn says not a word of the flood coming in from the S E, though
that would be an argument against Tasman's opinion, <i>that New
Zealand was the Continent</i>.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 74}</u></p>

<p>concluded that there must be an open sea in that quarter, and that
here likewise he should find a passage.</p>

<p>Here he saw another island, which he called THREE KINGS ISLAND<b
style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b>, in 34&deg;. 25' S lat. and 190&ordm;.
40' long. where his people going ashore to refresh themselves, met
with fresh water, and discovered between thirty and forty men of an
uncommon stature, as they appeared unto them, being at no small
distance; they were armed with sticks and clubs, and, besides calling
out to them in a very rough voice without their understanding any
thing of it, came up towards them very hastily, taking prodigious
large steps. This island is represented in the plate.</p>

<p>In rowing round the island they saw some people, and particularly
a man of a very large size, with something of a staff or pike; very
little cultivated land, only near a stream, where our people thought
of fetching water, but could not get to it. Here were a great number
of square inclosures, whose verdure made so delightful an appearance
that it brought to their minds some recollection of their own
country; but the herbage they could not particularly distinguish;
they likewise saw two <i>prauws</i> which had been hauled up above
high water mark. Hereupon TASMAN determined to run <i>eastward</i> to
220&deg;. long., then <i>northward</i> into 17&deg;. S lat. and after
that, <i>westward</i> again, to the islands of Cocos and HOORN (which
were discovered by SCHOUTEN), for a supply of provisions<b style=

to the southward.</p>

<p><b>Three King's Island in 40 fathoms on the N.W. Side</b></p>
</center>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 75}</u></p>

<p>On the 8th January he came into 32&deg;. 25' S lat. and 192&deg;.
20' long. the variation 9&deg;. E, with heavy seas from the S E, a
sure sign of no continent that way. There was a navigable sea, which
afforded a very easy passage from BATAVIA, to CHILI, without any
visible impediment<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b>.</p>

<p>On the 19th January, being in 22&deg;. 35' S, and 204&deg;. 15'
long. (the variation 7&deg;. 30' E) he had sight of an island about
two or three miles in circumference, high, steep, and barren, which
he called HIGH PYLSTAART'S (or <i>wild ducks</i>) ISLAND, from the
great number which he saw here<b style="color:#0000FF">[2]</b>. He
was for going nearer to it, but gales from the S E and S S E hindered
him.</p>

<p>The next day discovering two other islands.</p>

<p>On the 21st he reached the <i>northernmost</i> which lay in
21&deg;. 20' S, and 205&deg;. 29' long. the variation 7&deg;. 15' E;
this was not high land. To one he gave the name of AMSTERDAM and to
the other that of MIDDLEBURG. A distant view of both is here
represented. The inhabitants of the former brought him hogs, poultry,
and fruits; were very courteous, yet seemed something light-fingered,
though in other respects without any ill intention, and they had not
a single weapon about them.</p>

<p>These two islands bear N E and S W from one another; that to the
southward was the highest, the northernmost being flattish, almost
like HOLLAND. At noon a <i>prauw</i> came alongside, with three
<i>tawny men, of a stature something above the common</i>, one with
his hair cropt, the other two wearing it long; they had only a small
covering over their privities.</p>

<blockquote>[1) On the 8th, lat. 30&deg;. 25' S. (32&deg; 10' S.
long. 193&deg;. 34'. D.H.) On the 12th January, lat. 30&deg;. 5' S,
long. 195&deg;. 27' E (lat. 29&deg;. 50' S, long. 196&deg;. 10'.

<blockquote>[2) A view of it is here given.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 76}</u></p>

<p>Their <i>prauw</i> was narrow, but with a deck fore and aft, and
their paddles of the common length, but the blades with which they
paddled broad in the middle.</p>

<p>Having shewn a piece of linen to them, we tossed it overboard, at
which one of them dived and remained a long time under water, but
brought it up, and when he was got into the <i>prauw</i>, moved it
several times over his head, by way of thanks.</p>

<p>Afterwards, on their <i>prauw's</i> coming nearer to us, we threw
them a bit of wood, with two large nails tied to it, and handed to
them a small Chinese looking-glass, together with a chain of Chinese
beads, which they took hold of by means of a long pole, and in return
tied to it tome of their fishing hooks, which were made of a kind of
mother of pearl.</p>

<p>Some of them laid the beads, the looking-glass, and the chain
above their heads, and he in the middle tied the nails about his
neck.</p>

<p>We handed another looking-glass to the islanders in which they
could see, the first being covered with a thin sort of board which
could be drawn out; this they likewise very thankfully laid to their
heads.</p>

<p>We also shewed to them a cocoa-nut and a fowl, and from the
<i>vocabulary</i><b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b> asked the Indians
about water, hogs, etc. but neither understood one another; however,
they pointed towards the shore, as if they would go and bring
something, and accordingly paddled away.</p>

<p>In the afternoon our people saw a considerable number of men
running along the shore, with <i>little white flags</i>, which ours
took for ensigns of peace, and answered them with hoisting a white
ensign; on which came on board, in a prauw,</p>

<blockquote>[1) <i>Vocabulary</i>, undoubtedly that in
Schouten.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 77}</u></p>

<p>four stout fellows, with their bodies painted black, from the
navel to the thighs, and their neck decorated with leaves hanging
down from it: they brought with them a sort of garment made of rind
of trees, and likewise a <i>small white flag</i>, which they placed
in the prow of our boat. One of the prauw's <i>wings</i> being
embellished with variety of shells and other marine productions, our
people conceived it to belong to the king or chief of the country,
and presented him with a Chinese looking-glass, a knife, some
dongaree or calico, and some nails.</p>

<p>Our people, the better to please them, drank a glass of wine to
them, then gave them a rummer full, which they emptied, and carried
the rummer away with them.</p>

<p>Soon after came a great number of prauws, some of which brought
ten or twelve cocoa-nuts, for which our people bartered nails; some
even swam off to the ship with cocoa-nuts.</p>

<p>Afterwards an aged man came on board, who, amidst all the
reverence paid him by the others, saluted our people, bowing down his
head to his very feet; and we were not wanting to return the
compliment, making him, besides, a present of several trinkets.</p>

<p>Some, however, at going away betrayed a thievish disposition, and
towards evening not less than twenty prauws came about TASMAN'S ship,
making a great outcry of <i>wor, wor, wor</i>, and brought on board a
hog, with some cocoa-nuts and yams, for which we gave them a wooden
dish and some copper wire, and afterwards exchanged beads and nails
for some cocoa-nuts, plantains, and yams.</p>

<p>On its growing dark they all went away, except one, who staid
aboard all night.</p>

<p>On the 22d January several men and women, young and old, came on
board with all kinds of provisions.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 78}</u></p>

<p>The oldest of the women wanted the little finger of both hands,
which was not the case of the younger, and our people could not come
at the cause of this mutilation.</p>

<p>On the same day came again on board the abovementioned old man,
with some presents, which we returned with a satin gown, a shirt, and
a hat; at noon we had along-side thirty-two small prauws, and a large
one with a sail (as in LE MAIRE'S journal), and several men and
women, who brought refreshments and some unknown vegetables, likewise
a garment made of rind.</p>

<p>To the chief of eighteen robust men and their wives, TASMAN made a
present of a pair of breeches and a shirt, with which, on putting
them on, he fancied himself wonderfully fine.</p>

<p>Among these was a very large man, having a <i>St. Thomas's
arm</i>, and a woman with something of a natural beard.</p>

<p>Our trumpeter and fiddler played several tunes, at which they
expressed great surprize. The old man having, by signs, given them to
understand that they might have water for fetching, thereupon TASMAN
sent his and the ZEE-HAAN'S boat for that purpose.</p>

<p>In each long-boat went a mate, and with them skipper JDE TJERKZOON
HOLMAN, and merchant GILSEMANS in the barge; all our people were
likewise well armed; though by the friendliness of the natives this
precaution seemed unnecessary.</p>

<p>After rowing a pretty way, our people came to the N E side of the
island, where at length they met with three little ponds, out of
which they were obliged to take up the water with cocoa-nut shells;
but, what was still worse, it proved not worth taking up.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 79}</u></p>

<p>On this the islanders conducted our people farther up the country,
and indeed to a most pleasant place, where they seated them under a
very sightly <i>Belay</i>, on mats of a very delicate texture, and
variety of beautiful colours, treating them with two cocoa-nuts, one
for the chief, and one for our skipper.</p>

<p>In the evening our people returned on board with a hog, and an
account that no water was to be had; they however made so good a
day's work of it, as to get forty pigs, seventy fowls, and vegetables
in abundance, for a few nails, a little fail-cloth, etc.</p>

<p>Smoaking tobacco is not known here: the women from the waist to
the knees wear a covering of matted leaves, but all the other parts
of the body are naked, and their hair shorter than that of the men.
The latter have a beard three or four fingers broad, with whiskers,
carefully kept under a quarter of an inch in length. There being
likewise no appearance of weapons among these people, ours were the
less apprehensive of any disturbance.</p>

<p>The day following, going ashore to dig for water, we met with much
better entertainment, excellent fish, milk, etc. and in every respect
their whole behaviour was very courteous. and friendly.</p>

<p>They asked us from whence we came, and whither we were going? And
on our saying that we had already been a hundred days at lea, they
could not sufficiently express their astonishment: this is a manifest
proof that they thoroughly understood one another<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b>.</p>

<blockquote>[1) Most probably by means of a Malayan, or other
interpreter. Valentyn.--This seems a very improbable conjecture, for
Tasman had just before said they could not understand any of the
words in the <i>Vocabulary</i>, and therefore no probability that
they understood each other any way but by signs.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 80}</u></p>

<p>Our people farther bartered with the islanders for a considerable
quantity of pigs and fowls; but in the afternoon, the ground being
steep, the trade wind drove them out to sea, but at night got safe
again into convenient anchorage.</p>

<p>In order to give a still more clear idea of the island of
AMSTERDAM, and every thing remarkable thereabouts, we have exhibited
a nearer view of it in two plates, with alphabetical references, as
following:</p>

<p>A. Our ships at anchor in VAN DIEMEN'S ROAD.<br>
B. Little prauws belonging to the king of this country.<br>
C. A sailing vessel of two prauws, joined together by one deck.<br>
D. A fishing prauw.<br>
E. How they swam on board with cocoa-nuts.<br>
F. The point where the king lives.<br>
G. Our boats watering.<br>
H. The place where they came to meet our people with flags of
peace.<br>
I. The place where our people kept guard with arms.<br>
K. The king's <i>Baylae</i>, in a pagger, where he received our
officers.<br>
L. Washing place for the king and his nobles.<br>
M. Their barks at anchor.<br>
N. Manner of setting and standing with their cloathing.<br>
0. Bay where the king lives and his yacht lies, by TASMAN called
MARIA BAY, in compliment to Mrs. VAN DIEMEN.</p>

<p>The beautiful draught of these islands, and of the other things
represented in it, very well deserves being inserted.</p>

<p>Whilst they anchored here, they also discovered two high but very
small islands, not above a mile or a mile and a half in
circumference; about seven or eight miles to the N by W,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 81}</u></p>

<p>likewise another, but something large and low, E N E; and Eastward
three others, very small; besides two more S E, all very low.</p>

<p>The current here was not strong, the ebb ran N E and the flood S
W; it flowed <i>seven</i> or <i>eight</i> feet perpendicular, and a S
W moon made high water. The wind keeping continually S E and S S E,
the HEEMSKIRK yacht drove off from this island without being able to
water.</p>

<p>On the 25th January he came into 20&deg;. 15' S lat. and 206&deg;.
19' long. the variation 6&deg;. 20'; here he likewise saw several
small islands, as UITARDAM and NAMOKOKI, and came to ROTTERDAM
ISLAND, which is set down in the map, and where, as before, he found
the people very courteous and friendly, yet very much given to
pilfering. Besides abundance of cocoa-nut trees in this island, he
saw several gardens very neatly laid out, with plenty of all kinds of
vegetables, and it was regularly planted with delightful walks of
fruit-trees; here they also met with a reservoir of fresh water, not
less than half a mile in circumference, and full nine feet above the
sea.</p>

<p>There is no landing here but at high water, the shore being eight
feet perpendicular.</p>

<p>In the above-mentioned reservoir were large flights of wild-ducks,
which were not so shy as usual.</p>

<p>The natives came on board with cocoa-nuts and calabashes of fresh
water, with other fruits and pigs, but of the last not many.</p>

<p>Some of their prauws were rigged for sailing. In cloathing, shape,
and deportment, they were like those of the former island, only the
men's hair, in general, was not so long and thick, and the women were
pretty much of the fame stature and as stout limbed as the men.</p>

<p>The name of this island, among the natives, is ANNAMOKKA, but our
people called it ROTTERDAM ISLAND.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 82}</u></p>

<p>A view of it, and the other more distant islands near it, together
with its inhabitants, is here represented, with the following
alphabetical references.</p>

<p>A. Our ships lying Off ANNAMOKKA.<br>
B. Sandy bay, from whence they came on board in their prauws.<br>
C. Bay where our people watered.<br>
D. Reservoir near the sea, on the north side of the island.<br>
E. Sailing prauw coming with vegetables from the other islands.<br>
F. Place where our boats lay when they went for water.<br>
G. Appearance and cloathing of the inhabitants of the island at their
coming aboard.</p>

<p>On the 26th ditto they fetched two boat-loads of water for each
ship, and bartered for a plentiful, recruit of vegetables, etc. here
likewise it was found that these islanders only wanted opportunity to
lay their hands on what did not belong to them.</p>

<p>Our people being plentifully supplied with water and other
necessaries, and being resolved to be on their guard and keep a
watchful eye, some of the officers went ashore to take leave of the
king, which gave them an opportunity of seeing their elegant
plantations.</p>

<p>All being now over, on the 1st of February, 1643, they weighed
anchor, and shaped their course <i>northward</i>, which brought them
in sight of some islands taken notice of in the map; their purpose
was first to run up to 17&deg;. S lat. and then to proceed further
<i>westward</i>, to avoid passing by TRAITORS and HORN islands; and
accordingly they set sail with a breeze at SE and ESE.</p>

<p>On the 6th February, in the lat. of 170. 19' S and 201&deg;. 35'
long. they law eighteen or twenty small islands, surrounded with
rocks, lands, and banks, and in the map they</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 83}</u></p>

<p>are distinguished. by the names of PRINCE WILLIAM'S ISLANDS and
HEEMSKIRK'S BANKS.</p>

<p>Two days after, in lat. 15&deg;. 29' S and 199&deg;. 31' long.
they met with heavy rain and hard gales of wind from the N E and N N
E, and hazy dark weather, on which he determined to steer N and N E
to 5&deg;. or 6&deg;. and then <i>westward</i> to NEW GUINEA<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b>.</p>

<p>On the 2d March he was in 9&deg;. 11' S lat. and in 192&deg;. 46'
long. The variation 10&deg;. E<b style="color:#0000FF">[2]</b>.
And.</p>

<p>On the 14th March in 10&deg;. 12' S lat. and 186&deg;. 14' long.
The variation precisely 8&deg; 45'; without having been able for
twelve days successively to take an observation, the weather being so
thick and rainy<b style="color:#0000FF">[3]</b>.</p>

<p>On the 22d, in 5&deg;. S lat. and 178&deg;. 32' long. an
<i>easterly trade wind</i> brought him in sight of land five miles to
the <i>westward</i>, and discovered it to be twenty-two small islands
which LE MAIRE has set down in the map, they are called ONTONG-JAVA,
and lie about ninety miles<b style="color:#0000FF">[4]</b> from NEW
GUINEA.</p>

<p>Three days after, he came to MARKEN'S ISLANDS, which are about
fourteen or fifteen at least, the inhabitants very savage, with only
a slight covering over their privities; their hair black, and tied
up; in short, differing little or nothing from the wretches in
MURDERER'S BAY.</p>

<blockquote>[1) On the 14th February they were in 16&deg;. 30' S,
long. 193&deg;. 35, having hitherto had much rain and bad weather,

They hailed the Zee-Haan, and found their reckonings agree. N.<br>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 84}</u></p>

<p>The natives wear thin hair, cut short, and bound- up in the manner
of the above villains. One of them had two feathers sticking upright
on the crown of his head, like a pair of horns; others wore rings
through their nostrils: their prauw had a leeboard and a sharp head,
yet was by no means a master-piece of neat workmanship: they used
bows and arrows, and as for our nails and beads made little account
of them.</p>

<p>Here our people were near being driven on a large land, but very
providentially a gale at south cleared them of the imminent danger<b
style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b>.</p>

<p>On the 26th March, in 4&deg;. 33' S lat. and 174&deg;. 30' long.
they fell in with a very strong current, Variation 9&deg;. 30' E.</p>

<p>On the 29th March he came to the GREEN ISLANDS.</p>

<p>On the 30th they saw St. JOHN'S ISLAND, and</p>

<p>On the 1st April<b style="color:#0000FF">[2]</b>, NEW GUINEA, at
the point of land called by the Spaniards CABO ST. MARIA, or C. ST.
MARY, in 4&deg;. 30' lat. and 171&deg; 2' long."</p>

<p style="color:#006600">The land which TASMAN here calls NEW GUINEA,
is NEW BRITAIN; he coasted this land and NEW GUINEA, the western
point whereof he past on the 18th of May, and from thence continued
his course by SERAM, BOURO, and BOETON, for BATAVIA, where he arrived
on the 15th June, having accomplished this expedition in ten
months.</p>

<p style="color:#006600">THORNTON'S chart describes TASMAN'S track,
after passing the <i>west</i> point of NEW GUINEA, to have been
<i>eastward</i> to the False Cape, and thence along the coasts of
CARPENTARIA, etc. but although the names in the bottom of that bay
indicate the discovery to have been made about this period, I think
it is very obvious that it could not have been done by TASMAN in
<i>this</i> voyage.</p>
