<h2><a id="ch1">1</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE fisherman loosened his knife in its scabbard.
The gesture was instinctive, for what he feared was nothing a knife
could slay, not even the saw-edged crescent blade of the Yuetshi
that could disembowel a man with an upward stroke. Neither man nor
beast threatened him in the solitude which brooded over the
castellated isle of Xapur.</p>

<p>He had climbed the cliffs, passed through the jungle that
bordered them, and now stood surrounded by evidences of a vanished
state. Broken columns glimmered among the trees, the straggling
lines of crumbling walls meandered off into the shadows, and under
his feet were broad paves, cracked and bowed by roots growing
beneath.</p>

<p>The fisherman was typical of his race, that strange people whose
origin is lost in the gray dawn of the past, and who have dwelt in
their rude fishing huts along the southern shore of the Sea of
Vilayet since time immemorial. He was broadly built, with long,
apish arms and a mighty chest, but with lean loins and thin, bandy
legs. His face was broad, his forehead low and retreating, his hair
thick and tangled. A belt for a knife and a rag for a loin cloth
were all he wore in the way of clothing.</p>

<p>That he was where he was proved that he was less dully incurious
than most of his people. Men seldom visited Xapur. It was
uninhabited, all but forgotten, merely one among the myriad isles
which dotted the great inland sea. Men called it Xapur, the
Fortified, because of its ruins, remnants of some prehistoric
kingdom, lost and forgotten before the conquering Hyborians had
ridden southward. None knew who reared those stones, though dim
legends lingered among the Yuetshi which half intelligibly
suggested a connection of immeasurable antiquity between the
fishermen and the unknown island kingdom.</p>

<p>But it had been a thousand years since any Yuetshi had
understood the import of these tales; they repeated them now as a
meaningless formula, a gibberish framed to their lips by custom. No
Yuetshi had come to Xapur for a century. The adjacent coast of the
mainland was uninhabited, a reedy marsh given over to the grim
beasts that haunted it. The fisherman's village lay some distance
to the south, on the mainland. A storm had blown his frail fishing
craft far from his accustomed haunts and wrecked it in a night of
flaring lightning and roaring waters on the towering cliffs of the
isle. Now, in the dawn, the sky shone blue and clear; the rising
sun made jewels of the dripping leaves. He had climbed the cliffs
to which he had clung through the night because, in the midst of
the storm, he had seen an appalling lance of lightning fork out of
the black heavens, and the concussion of its stroke, which had
shaken the whole island, had been accompanied by a cataclysmic
crash that he doubted could have resulted from a riven tree.</p>

<p>A dull curiosity had caused him to investigate; and now he had
found what he sought, and an animal-like uneasiness possessed him,
a sense of lurking peril.</p>

<p>Among the trees reared a broken dome-like structure, built of
gigantic blocks of the peculiar ironlike green stone found only on
the islands of Vilayet. It seemed incredible that human hands could
have shaped and placed them, and certainly it was beyond human
power to have overthrown the structure they formed. But the
thunderbolt had splintered the ton-heavy blocks like so much glass,
reduced others to green dust, and ripped away the whole arch of the
dome.</p>

<p>The fisherman climbed over the debris and peered in, and what he
saw brought a grunt from him. Within the ruined dome, surrounded by
stone dust and bits of broken masonry, lay a man on a golden block.
He was clad in a sort of skirt and a shagreen girdle. His black
hair, which fell in a square mane to his massive shoulders, was
confined about his temples by a narrow gold band. On his bare,
muscular breast lay a curious dagger with a jeweled pommel, a
shagreen- bound hilt, and a broad, crescent blade. It was much like
the knife the fisherman wore at his hip, but it lacked the serrated
edge and was made with infinitely greater skill.</p>

<p>The fisherman lusted for the weapon. The man, of course, was
dead; had been dead for many centuries. This dome was his tomb. The
fisherman did not wonder by what art the ancients had preserved the
body in such a vivid likeness of life, which kept the muscular
limbs full and unshrunken, the dark flesh vital. The dull brain of
the Yuetshi had room only for his desire for the knife with its
delicate, waving lines along the dully gleaming blade.</p>

<p>Scrambling down into the dome, he lifted the weapon from the
man's breast. As he did so, a strange and terrible thing came to
pass. The muscular, dark hands knotted convulsively, the lids
flared open, revealing great, dark, magnetic eyes, whose stare
struck the startled fisherman like a physical blow. He recoiled,
dropping the jeweled dagger in his perturbation. The man on the
dais heaved up to a sitting position, and the fisherman gaped at
the full extent of his size, thus revealed. His narrowed eyes held
the Yuetshi, and in those slitted orbs he read neither friendliness
nor gratitude; he saw only a fire as alien and hostile as that
which burns in the eyes of a tiger.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man rose and towered above him, menace in his every
aspect. There was no room in the fisherman's dull brain for fear,
at least for such fear as might grip a man who has just seen the
fundamental laws of nature defied. As the great hands fell to his
shoulders, he drew his saw-edged knife and struck upward with the
same motion. The blade splintered against the stranger's corded
belly as against a steel column, and then the fisherman's thick
neck broke like a rotten twig in the giant hands.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2">2</a></h2>

<p class="first">JEHUNGIR AGHA, lord of Khawarizm and keeper of the
coastal border, scanned once more the ornate parchment scroll with
its peacock seal and laughed shortly and sardonically.</p>

<p>"Well?" bluntly demanded his counsellor Ghaznavi.</p>

<p>Jehungir shrugged his shoulders. He was a handsome man, with the
merciless pride of birth and accomplishment.</p>

<p>"The king grows short of patience," he said. "In his own hand he
complains bitterly of what he calls my failure to guard the
frontier. By Tarim, if I cannot deal a blow to these robbers of the
steppes, Khawarizm may own a new lord."</p>

<p>Ghaznavi tugged his gray-shot beard in meditation. Yezdigerd,
king of Turan, was the mightiest monarch in the world. In his
palace in the great port city of Aghrapur was heaped the plunder of
empires. His fleets of purple-sailed war galleys had made Vilayet
an Hyrkanian lake. The dark-skinned people of Zamora paid him
tribute, as did the eastern provinces of Koth. The Shemites bowed
to his rule as far west as Shushan. His armies ravaged the borders
of Stygia in the south and the snowy lands of the Hyperboreans in
the north. His riders bore torch and sword westward into Brythunia
and Ophir and Corinthia, even to the borders of Nemedia. His
gilt-helmeted swordsmen had trampled hosts under their horses'
hoofs, and walled cities went up in flames at his command. In the
glutted slave markets of Aghrapur, Sultanapur, Khawarizm, Shahpur,
and Khorusun, women were sold for three small silver
coins&mdash;blonde Brythunians, tawny Stygians, dark-haired
Zamorians, ebon Kushites, olive- skinned Shemites.</p>

<p>Yet, while his swift horsemen overthrew armies far from his
frontiers, at his very borders an audacious foe plucked his beard
with a red-dripping and smoke-stained hand.</p>

<p>On the broad steppes between the Sea of Vilayet and the borders
of the easternmost Hyborian kingdoms, a new race had sprung up in
the past half- century, formed originally of fleeing criminals,
broken men, escaped slaves, and deserting soldiers. They were men
of many crimes and countries, some born on the steppes, some
fleeing from the kingdoms in the West. They were called kozak,
which means wastrel.</p>

<p>Dwelling on the wild, open steppes, owning no law but their own
peculiar code, they had become a people capable even of defying the
Grand Monarch. Ceaselessly they raided the Turanian frontier,
retiring in the steppes when defeated; with the pirates of Vilayet,
men of much the same breed, they harried the coast, preying off the
merchant ships which plied between the Hyrkanian ports.</p>

<p>"How am I to crush these wolves?" demanded Jehungir. "If I
follow them into the steppes, I run the risk either of being cut
off and destroyed, or of having them elude me entirely and burn the
city in my absence. Of late they have been more daring than
ever."</p>

<p>"That is because of the new chief who has risen among them,"
answered Ghaznavi. "You know whom I mean."</p>

<p>"Aye!" replied Jehungir feelingly. "It is that devil Conan; he
is even wilder than the kozaks, yet he is crafty as a mountain
lion."</p>

<p>"It is more through wild animal instinct than through
intelligence," answered Ghaznavi. "The other kozaks are at least
descendants of civilized men. He is a barbarian. But to dispose of
him would be to deal them a crippling blow."</p>

<p>"But how?" demanded Jehungir. "He has repeatedly cut his way out
of spots that seemed certain death for him. And, instinct or
cunning, he has avoided or escaped every trap set for him."</p>

<p>"For every beast and for every man there is a trap he will not
escape," quoth Ghaznavi. "When we have parleyed with the kozaks for
the ransom of captives, I have observed this man Conan. He has a
keen relish for women and strong drink. Have your captive Octavia
fetched here."</p>

<p>Jehungir clapped his hands, and an impressive Kushite eunuch, an
image of shining ebony in silken pantaloons, bowed before him and
went to do his bidding. Presently he returned, leading by the wrist
a tall, handsome girl, whose yellow hair, clear eyes, and fair skin
identified her as a pure-blooded member of her race. Her scanty
silk tunic, girded at the waist, displayed the marvelous contours
of her magnificent figure. Her fine eyes flashed with resentment
and her red lips were sulky, but submission had been taught her
during her captivity. She stood with hanging head before her master
until he motioned her to a seat on the divan beside him. Then he
looked inquiringly at Ghaznavi.</p>

<p>"We must lure Conan away from the kozaks," said the counsellor
abruptly. "Their war camp is at present pitched somewhere on the
lower reaches of the Zaporoska River&mdash;which, as you well know,
is a wilderness of reeds, a swampy jungle in which our last
expedition was cut to pieces by those masterless devils."</p>

<p>"I am not likely to forget that," said Jehungir wryly.</p>

<p>"There is an uninhabited island near the mainland," said
Ghaznavi, "known as Xapur, the Fortified, because of some ancient
ruins upon it. There is a peculiarity about it which makes it
perfect for our purpose. It has no shoreline but rises sheer out of
the sea in cliffs a hundred and fifty feet tall. Not even an ape
could negotiate them. The only place where a man can go up or down
is a narrow path on the western side that has the appearance of a
worn stair, carved into the solid rock of the cliffs.</p>

<p>"If we could trap Conan on that island, alone, we could hunt him
down at our leisure, with bows, as men hunt a lion."</p>

<p>"As well wish for the moon," said Jehungir impatiently. "Shall
we send him a messenger, bidding him climb the cliffs and await our
coming?"</p>

<p>"In effect, yes!" Seeing Jehungir's look of amazement, Ghaznavi
continued: "We will ask for a parley with the kozaks in regard to
prisoners, at the edge of the steppes by Fort Ghori. As usual, we
will go with a force and encamp outside the castle. They will come,
with an equal force, and the parley will go forward with the usual
distrust and suspicion. But this time we will take with us, as if
by casual chance, your beautiful captive." Octavia changed color
and listened with intensified interest as the counsellor nodded
toward her. "She will use all her wiles to attract Conan's
attention. That should not be difficult. To that wild reaver, she
should appear a dazzling vision of loveliness. Her vitality and
substantial figure should appeal to him more vividly than would one
of the doll-like beauties of your seraglio."</p>

<p><br>
OCTAVIA sprang up, her white fists clenched, her eyes blazing
and her figure quivering with outraged anger.</p>

<p>"You would force me to play the trollop with this barbarian?"
she exclaimed. "I will not! I am no market-block slut to smirk and
ogle at a steppes robber. I am the daughter of a Nemedian
lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You were of the Nemedian nobility before my riders carried you
off," returned Jehungir cynically. "Now you are merely a slave who
will do as she is bid."</p>

<p>"I will not!" she raged.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," rejoined Jehungir with studied cruelty, "you
will. I like Ghaznavi's plan. Continue, prince among
counsellors."</p>

<p>"Conan will probably wish to buy her. You will refuse to sell
her, of course, or to exchange her for Hyrkanian prisoners. He may
then try to steal her, or take her by force&mdash;though I do not
think even he would break the parley truce. Anyway, we must be
prepared for whatever he might attempt.</p>

<p>"Then, shortly after the parley, before he has time to forget
all about her, we will send a messenger to him, under a flag of
truce, accusing him of stealing the girl and demanding her return.
He may kill the messenger, but at least he will think that she has
escaped.</p>

<p>"Then we will send a spy&mdash;a Yuetshi fisherman will
do&mdash;to the kozak camp, who will tell Conan that Octavia is
hiding on Xapur. If I know my man, he will go straight to that
place."</p>

<p>"But we do not know that he will go alone," Jehungir argued.</p>

<p>"Does a man take a band of warriors with him, when going to a
rendezvous with a woman he desires?" retorted Ghaznavi. "The
chances are all that he will go alone. But we will take care of the
other alternative. We will not await him on the island, where we
might be trapped ourselves, but among the reeds of a marshy point,
which juts out to within a thousand yards of Xapur. If he brings a
large force, we'll beat a retreat and think up another plot. If he
comes alone or with a small party, we will have him. Depend upon
it, he will come, remembering your charming slave's smiles and
meaning glances."</p>

<p>"I will never descend to such shame!" Octavia was wild with fury
and humiliation. "I will die first!"</p>

<p>"You will not die, my rebellious beauty," said Jehungir, "but
you will be subjected to a very painful and humiliating
experience."</p>

<p>He clapped his hands, and Octavia paled. This time it was not
the Kushite who entered, but a Shemite, a heavily muscled man of
medium height with a short, curled, blue-black beard.</p>

<p>"Here is work for you, Gilzan," said Jehungir. "Take this fool,
and play with her awhile. Yet be careful not to spoil her
beauty."</p>

<p>With an inarticulate grunt the Shemite seized Octavia's wrist,
and at the grasp of his iron fingers, all the defiance went out of
her. With a piteous cry she tore away and threw herself on her
knees before her implacable master, sobbing incoherently for
mercy.</p>

<p>Jehungir dismissed the disappointed torturer with a gesture, and
said to Ghaznavi: "If your plan succeeds, I will fill your lap with
gold."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3">3</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN the darkness before dawn, an unaccustomed sound
disturbed the solitude that slumbered over the reedy marshes and
the misty waters of the coast. It was not a drowsy waterfowl nor a
waking beast. It was a human who struggled through the thick reeds,
which were taller than a man's head.</p>

<p>It was a woman, had there been anyone to see, tall, and
yellow-haired, her splendid limbs molded by her draggled tunic.
Octavia had escaped in good earnest, every outraged fiber of her
still tingling from her experience in a captivity that had become
unendurable.</p>

<p>Jehungir's mastery of her had been bad enough; but with
deliberate fiendishness Jehungir had given her to a nobleman whose
name was a byword for degeneracy even in Khawarizm.</p>

<p>Octavia's resilient flesh crawled and quivered at her memories.
Desperation had nerved her climb from Jelal Khan's castle on a rope
made of strips from torn tapestries, and chance had led her to a
picketed horse. She had ridden all night, and dawn found her with a
foundered steed on the swampy shores of the sea. Quivering with the
abhorrence of being dragged back to the revolting destiny planned
for her by Jelal Khan, she plunged into the morass, seeking a
hiding place from the pursuit she expected. When the reeds grew
thinner around her and the water rose about her thighs, she saw the
dim loom of an island ahead of her. A broad span of water lay
between, but she did not hesitate. She waded out until the low
waves were lapping about her waist; then she struck out strongly,
swimming with a vigor that promised unusual endurance.</p>

<p>As she neared the island, she saw that it rose sheer from the
water in castle-like cliffs. She reached them at last but found
neither ledge to stand on below the water, nor to cling to above.
She swam on, following the curve of the cliffs, the strain of her
long flight beginning to weight her limbs. Her hands fluttered
along the sheer stone, and suddenly they found a depression. With a
sobbing gasp of relief, she pulled herself out of the water and
clung there, a dripping white goddess in the dim starlight.</p>

<p>She had come upon what seemed to be steps carved in the cliff.
Up them she went, flattening herself against the stone as she
caught a faint clack of muffled oars. She strained her eyes and
thought she made out a vague bulk moving toward the reedy point she
had just quitted. But it was too far away for her to be sure in the
darkness, and presently the faint sound ceased and she continued
her climb. If it were her pursuers, she knew of no better course
than to hide on the island. She knew that most of the islands off
that marshy coast were uninhabited. This might be a pirate's lair,
but even pirates would be preferable to the beast she had
escaped.</p>

<p>A vagrant thought crossed her mind as she climbed, in which she
mentally compared her former master with the kozak chief with
whom&mdash;by compulsion&mdash;she had shamefully flirted in the
pavillions of the camp by Fort Ghori, where the Hyrkanian lords had
parleyed with the warriors of the steppes. His burning gaze had
frightened and humiliated her, but his cleanly elemental fierceness
set him above Jelal Khan, a monster such as only an overly opulent
civilization can produce.</p>

<p>She scrambled up over the cliff edge and looked timidly at the
dense shadows which confronted her. The trees grew close to the
cliffs, presenting a solid mass of blackness. Something whirred
above her head and she cowered, even though realizing it was only a
bat.</p>

<p>She did not like the looks of those ebony shadows, but she set
her teeth and went toward them, trying not to think of snakes. Her
bare feet made no sound in the spongy loam under the trees.</p>

<p>Once among them, the darkness closed frighteningly about her.
She had not taken a dozen steps when she was no longer able to look
back and see the cliffs and the sea beyond. A few steps more and
she became hopelessly confused and lost her sense of direction.
Through the tangled branches not even a star peered. She groped and
floundered on, blindly, and then came to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>Somewhere ahead there began the rhythmical booming of a drum. It
was not such a sound as she would have expected to hear in that
time and place. Then she forgot it as she was aware of a presence
near her. She could not see, but she knew that something was
standing beside her in the darkness.</p>

<p>With a stifled cry she shrank back, and as she did so, something
that even in her panic she recognized as a human arm curved about
her waist. She screamed and threw all her supple young strength
into a wild lunge for freedom, but her captor caught her up like a
child, crushing her frantic resistance with ease. The silence with
which her frenzied pleas and protests were received added to her
terror as she felt herself being carried through the darkness
toward the distant drum, which still pulsed and muttered.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4">4</a></h2>

<p class="first">AS the first tinge of dawn reddened the sea, a
small boat with a solitary occupant approached the cliffs. The man
in the boat was a picturesque figure. A crimson scarf was knotted
about his head; his wide silk breeches, of flaming hue, were upheld
by a broad sash, which likewise supported a scimitar in a shagreen
scabbard. His gilt-worked leather boots suggested the horseman
rather than the seaman, but he handled his boat with skill. Through
his widely open white silk shirt showed his broad, muscular breast,
burned brown by the sun.</p>

<p>The muscles of his heavy, bronzed arms rippled as he pulled the
oars with an almost feline ease of motion. A fierce vitality that
was evident in each feature and motion set him apart from the
common men; yet his expression was neither savage nor somber,
though the smoldering blue eyes hinted at ferocity easily wakened.
This was Conan, who had wandered into the armed camps of the kozaks
with no other possession than his wits and his sword, and who had
carved his way to leadership among them.</p>

<p>He paddled to the carven stair as one familiar with his environs
and moored the boat to a projection of the rock. Then he went up
the worn steps without hesitation. He was keenly alert, not because
he consciously suspected hidden danger, but because alertness was a
part of him, whetted by the wild existence he followed.</p>

<p>What Ghaznavi had considered animal intuition or some sixth
sense was merely the razor-edged faculties and savage wit of the
barbarian. Conan had no instinct to tell him that men were watching
him from a covert among the reeds of the mainland.</p>

<p>As he climbed the cliff, one of these men breathed deeply and
stealthily lifted a bow. Jehungir caught his wrist and hisssed an
oath into his ear. "Fool! Will you betray us? Don't you realize he
is out of range? Let him get upon the island. He will go looking
for the girl. We will stay here awhile. He may have sensed our
presence or guessed our plot. He may have warriors hidden
somewhere. We will wait. In an hour, if nothing suspicious occurs,
we'll row up to the foot of the stair and await him there. If he
does not return in a reasonable time, some of us will go upon the
island and hunt him down. But I do not wish to do that if it can be
helped. Some of us are sure to die if we have to go into the bush
after him. I had rather catch him with arrows from a safe
distance."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the unsuspecting kozak had plunged into a forest. He
went silently in his soft leather boots, his gaze sifting every
shadow in eagerness to catch sight of the splendid, tawny-haired
beauty of whom he had dreamed ever since he had seen her in the
pavilion of Jehungir Agha by Fort Ghori. He would have desired her
even if she had displayed repugnance toward him. But her cryptic
smiles and glances had fired his blood, and with all the lawless
violence which was his heritage he desired that white-skinned,
golden-haired woman of civilization.</p>

<p>He had been on Xapur before. Less than a month ago, he had held
a secret conclave here with a pirate crew. He knew that he was
approaching a point where he could see the mysterious ruins which
gave the island its name, and he wondered if he could find the girl
hiding among them. Even with the thought, he stopped as though
struck dead.</p>

<p>Ahead of him, among the trees, rose something that his reason
told him was not possible. It was a great dark green wall, with
towers rearing beyond the battlements.</p>

<p>Conan stood paralyzed in the disruption of the faculties which
demoralizes anyone who is confronted by an impossible negation of
sanity. He doubted neither his sight nor his reason, but something
was monstrously out of joint. Less than a month ago, only broken
ruins had showed among the trees. What human hands could rear such
a mammoth pile as now met his eyes, in the few weeks which had
elapsed? Besides, the buccaneers who roamed Vilyet ceaselessly
would have learned of any work going on, on such stupendous scale
and would have informed the kozaks.</p>

<p>There was no explaining this thing, but it was so. He was on
Xapur, and that fantastic heap of towering masonry was on Xapur,
and all was madness and paradox; yet it was all true.</p>

<p>He wheeled to race back through the jungle, down the carven
stair and across the blue waters to the distant camp at the mouth
of the Zaporoska. In that moment of unreasoning panic, even the
thought of halting so near the inland sea was repugnant. He would
leave it behind him, would quit the armed camps and the steppes and
put a thousand miles between him and the blue, mysterious East
where the most basic laws of nature could be set at naught, by what
diabolism he could not guess.</p>

<p>For an instant, the future fate of kingdoms that hinged on this
gay-clad barbarian hung in the balance. It was a small thing that
tipped the scales&mdash;merely a shred of silk hanging on a bush
that caught his uneasy glance. He leaned to it, his nostrils
expanding, his nerves quivering to a subtle stimulant. On that bit
of torn cloth, so faint that it was less with his physical
faculties than by some obscure instinctive sense that he recognized
it, lingered the tantalizing perfume that he connected with the
sweet, firm flesh of the woman he had seen in Jehungir's pavilion.
The fisherman had not lied, then; she was here! Then in the soil he
saw a single track in the loam, the track of a bare foot, long and
slender, but a man's, not a woman's, and sunk deeper than was
natural. The conclusion was obvious; the man who made that track
was carrying a burden, and what should it be but the girl the kozak
was seeking?</p>

<p>He stood silently facing the dark towers that loomed through the
trees, his eyes slits of blue balefire. Desire for the
yellow-haired woman vied with a sullen, primordial rage at whoever
had taken her. His human passion fought down his ultra-human fears,
and dropping into the stalking crouch of a hunting panther, he
glided toward the walls, taking advantage of the dense foliage to
escape detection from the battlements.</p>

<p>As he approached, he saw that the walls were composed of the
same green stone that had formed the ruins, and he was haunted by a
vague sense of familiarity. It was as if he looked upon something
he had never before seen but had dreamed of or pictured mentally.
At last he recognized the sensation. The walls and towers followed
the plan of the ruins. It was as if the crumbling lines had grown
back into the structures they originally were.</p>

<p><br>
NO sound disturbed the morning quiet as Conan stole to the foot
of the wall, which rose sheer from the luxuriant growth. On the
southern reaches of the inland sea, the vegetation was almost
tropical. He saw no one on the battlements, heard no sounds within.
He saw a massive gate a short distance to his left and had no
reason to suppose that it was not locked and guarded. But he
believed that the woman he sought was somewhere beyond that wall,
and the course he took was characteristically reckless.</p>

<p>Above him, vine-festooned branches reached out toward the
battlements. He went up a great tree like a cat, and reaching a
point above the parapet, he gripped a thick limb with both hands,
swung back and forth at arm's length until he had gained momentum,
and then let go and catapulted through the air, landing catlike on
the battlements. Crouching there, he stared down into the streets
of a city.</p>

<p>The circumference of the wall was not great, but the number of
green stone buildings it contained was surprising. They were three
or four stories in height, mainly flat-roofed, reflecting a fine
architectural style. The streets converged like the spokes of a
wheel into an octagon-shaped court in the centre of the town, which
gave upon a lofty edifice, which, with its domes and towers,
dominated the whole city. He saw no one moving in the streets or
looking out of the windows, though the sun was already coming up.
The silence that reigned there might have been that of a dead and
deserted city. A narrow stone stair ascended the wall near him;
down this he went.</p>

<p>Houses shouldered so closely to the wall that halfway down the
stair, he found himself within arm's length of a window and halted
to peer in. There were no bars, and the silk curtains were caught
back with satin cords. He looked into a chamber whose walls were
hidden by dark velvet tapestries. The floor was covered with thick
rugs, and there were benches of polished ebony and an ivory dais
heaped with furs.</p>

<p>He was about to continue his descent, when he heard the sound of
someone approaching in the street below. Before the unknown person
could round a corner and see him on the stair, he stepped quickly
across the intervening space and dropped lightly into the room,
drawing his scimitar. He stood for an instant statue-like; then, as
nothing happened, he was moving across the rugs toward an arched
doorway, when a hanging was drawn aside, revealing a cushioned
alcove from which a slender, dark-haired girl regarded him with
languid eyes.</p>

<p>Conan glared at her tensely, expecting her momentarily to start
screaming. But she merely smothered a yawn with a dainty hand, rose
from the alcove, and leaned negligently against the hanging which
she held with one hand.</p>

<p>She was undoubtedly a member of a white race, though her skin
was very dark. Her square-cut hair was black as midnight, her only
garment a wisp of silk about her supple hips.</p>

<p>Presently she spoke, but the tongue was unfamiliar to him, and
he shook his head. She yawned again, stretched lithely and, without
any show of fear or surprise, shifted to a language he did
understand, a dialect of Yuetshi which sounded strangely
archaic.</p>

<p>"Are you looking for someone?" she asked, as indifferently as if
the invasion of her chamber by an armed stranger were the most
common thing imaginable.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am Yateli," she answered languidly. "I must have feasted
late, last night; I am so sleepy now. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Conan, a hetman among the kozaks," he answered, watching
her narrowly. He believed her attitude to be a pose and expected
her to try to escape from the chamber or rouse the house. But,
though a velvet rope that might be a signal cord hung near her, she
did not reach for it.</p>

<p>"Conan," she repeated drowsily. "You are not a Dagonian. I
suppose you are a mercenary. Have you cut the heads off many
Yuetshi?"</p>

<p>"I do not war on water rats!" he snorted.</p>

<p>"But they are very terrible," she murmured. "I remember when
they were our slaves. But they revolted and burned and slew. Only
the magic of Khosatral Khel has kept them from the walls&mdash;"
she paused, a puzzled look struggling with the sleepiness of her
expression. "I forgot," she muttered. "They did climb the walls,
last night. There was shouting and fire, and the people calling in
vain on Khosatral." She shook her head as if to clear it. "But that
cannot be," she murmured, "because I am alive, and I thought I was
dead. Oh, to the devil with it!"</p>

<p>She came across the chamber, and taking Conan's hand, drew him
to the dais. He yielded in bewilderment and uncertainty. The girl
smiled at him like a sleepy child; her long silky lashes drooped
over dusky, clouded eyes. She ran her fingers through his thick
black locks as if to assure herself of his reality.</p>

<p>"It was a dream," she yawned. "Perhaps it's all a dream. I feel
like a dream now. I don't care. I can't remember something&mdash;I
have forgotten&mdash;there is something I cannot understand, but I
grow so sleepy when I try to think. Anyway, it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked uneasily. "You said they climbed
the walls last night? Who?"</p>

<p>"The Yuetshi. I thought so, anyway. A cloud of smoke hid
everything, but a naked, bloodstained devil caught me by the throat
and drove his knife into my breast. Oh, it hurt! But it was a
dream, because see, there is no scar." She idly inspected her
smooth bosom, and then sank upon Conan's lap and passed her supple
arms about his massive neck. "I cannot remember," she murmured,
nestling her dark head against his mighty breast. "Everything is
dim and misty. It does not matter. You are no dream. You are
strong. Let us live while we can. Love me!"</p>

<p>He cradled the girl's glossy head in the bend of his heavy arm
and kissed her full red lips with unfeigned relish.</p>

<p>"You are strong," she repeated, her voice waning. "Love
me&mdash;love&mdash;" The sleepy murmur faded away; the dusky eyes
closed, the long lashes drooping over the sensuous cheeks; the
supple body relaxed in Conan's arms.</p>

<p>He scowled down at her. She seemed to partake of the illusion
that haunted this whole city, but the firm resilience of her limbs
under his questing fingers convinced him that he had a living human
girl in his arms, and not the shadow of a dream. No less disturbed,
he hastily laid her on the furs upon the dais. Her sleep was too
deep to be natural. He decided that she must be an addict of some
drug, perhaps like the black lotus of Xuthal.</p>

<p>Then he found something else to make him wonder. Among the furs
on the dais was a gorgeous spotted skin, whose predominant hue was
golden. It was not a clever copy, but the skin of an actual beast.
And that beast, Conan knew, had been extinct for at least a
thousand years; it was the great golden leopard which figures so
prominently in Hyborian legendry, and which the ancient artists
delighted to portray in pigments and marble.</p>

<p><br>
SHAKING his head in bewilderment, Conan passed through the
archway into a winding corridor. Silence hung over the house, but
outside he heard a sound which his keen ears recognized as
something ascending the stair on the wall from which he had entered
the building. An instant later he was startled to hear something
land with a soft but weighty thud on the floor of the chamber he
had just quitted. Turning quickly away, he hurried along the
twisting hallway until something on the floor before him brought
him to a halt.</p>

<p>It was a human figure, which lay half in the hall and half in an
opening that obviously was normally concealed by a door, which was
a duplicate of the panels of the wall. It was a man, dark and lean,
clad only in a silk loincloth, with a shaven head and cruel
features, and he lay as if death had struck him just as he was
emerging from the panel. Conan bent above him, seeking the cause of
his death, and discovered him to be merely sunk in the same deep
sleep as the girl in the chamber.</p>

<p>But why should he select such a place for his slumbers? While
meditating on the matter, Conan was galvanized by a sound behind
him. Something was moving up the corridor in his direction. A quick
glance down it showed that it ended in a great door, which might be
locked. Conan jerked the supine body out of the panel entrance and
stepped through, pulling the panel shut after him. A click told him
it was locked in place. Standing in utter darkness, he heard a
shuffling tread halt just outside the door, and a faint chill
trickled along his spine. That was no human step, nor that of any
beast he had ever encountered.</p>

<p>There was an instant of silence, then a faint creak of wood and
metal. Putting out his hand he felt the door straining and bending
inward, as if a great weight were being steadily borne against it
from the outside. As he reached for his sword, this ceased and he
heard a strange, slobbering mouthing that prickled the short hairs
on his scalp. Scimitar in hand, he began backing away, and his
heels felt steps, down which he nearly tumbled. He was in a narrow
staircase leading downward.</p>

<p>He groped his way down in the blackness, feeling for, but not
finding, some other opening in the walls. Just as he decided that
he was no longer in the house, but deep in the earth under it, the
steps ceased in a level tunnel.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5">5</a></h2>

<p class="first">ALONG the dark, silent tunnel Conan groped,
momentarily dreading a fall into some unseen pit; but at last his
feet struck steps again, and he went up them until he came to a
door on which his fumbling fingers found a metal catch. He came out
into a dim and lofty room of enormous proportions. Fantastic
columns marched about the mottled walls, upholding a ceiling,
which, at once translucent and dusky, seemed like a cloudy midnight
sky, giving an illusion of impossible height. If any light filtered
in from the outside, it was curiously altered.</p>

<p>In a brooding twilight, Conan moved across the bare green floor.
The great room was circular, pierced on one side by the great,
bronze valves of a giant door. Opposite this, on a dais against the
wall, up to which led broad curving steps, there stood a throne of
copper, and when Conan saw what was coiled on this throne, he
retreated hastily, lifting his scimitar.</p>

<p>Then, as the thing did not move, he scanned it more closely and
presently mounted the glass steps and stared down at it. It was a
gigantic snake, apparently carved of some jadelike substance. Each
scale stood out as distinctly as in real life, and the iridescent
colors were vividly reproduced. The great wedge-shaped head was
half submerged in the folds of its trunk; so neither the eyes nor
jaws were visible. Recognition stirred in his mind. The snake was
evidently meant to represent one of those grim monsters of the
marsh, which in past ages had haunted the reedy edges of Vilayet's
southern shores. But, like the golden leopard, they had been
extinct for hundreds of years. Conan had seen rude images of them,
in miniature, among the idol huts of the Yuetshi, and there was a
description of them in the Book of Skelos, which drew on
prehistoric sources.</p>

<p>Conan admired the scaly torso, thick as his thigh and obviously
of great length, and he reached out and laid a curious hand on the
thing. And as he did so, his heart nearly stopped. An icy chill
congealed the blood in his veins and lifted the short hair on his
scalp. Under his hand there was not the smooth, brittle surface of
glass or metal or stone, but the yielding, fibrous mass of a living
thing. He felt cold, sluggish life flowing under his fingers.</p>

<p>His hand jerked back in instinctive repulsion. Sword shaking in
his grasp, horror and revulsion and fear almost choking him, he
backed away and down the glass steps with painful care, glaring in
awful fascination at the grisly thing that slumbered on the copper
throne. It did not move.</p>

<p>He reached the bronze door and tried it, with his heart in his
teeth, sweating with fear that he should find himself locked in
with that slimy horror. But the valves yielded to his touch, and he
glided though and closed them behind him.</p>

<p>He found himself in a wide hallway with lofty, tapestried walls,
where the light was the same twilight gloom. It made distant
objects indistinct, and that made him uneasy, rousing thoughts of
serpents gliding unseen through the dimness. A door at the other
end seemed miles away in the illusive light. Nearer at hand, the
tapestry hung in such a way as to suggest an opening behind it, and
lifting it cautiously he discovered a narrow stair leading up.</p>

<p>While he hesitated he heard, in the great room he had just left,
the same shuffling tread he had heard outside the locked panel. Had
he been followed through the tunnel? He went up the stair hastily,
dropping the tapestry in place behind him.</p>

<p>Emerging presently into a twisting corridor, he took the first
doorway he came to. He had a twofold purpose in his apparently
aimless prowling; to escape from the building and its mysteries,
and to find the Nemedian girl who, he felt, was imprisoned
somewhere in this palace, temple, or whatever it was. He believed
it was the great domed edifice at the center of the city, and it
was likely that here dwelt the ruler of the town, to whom a captive
woman would doubtless be brought.</p>

<p>He found himself in a chamber, not another corridor, and was
about to retrace his steps, when he heard a voice which came from
behind one of the walls. There was no door in that wall, but he
leaned close and heard distinctly. And an icy chill crawled slowly
along his spine. The tongue was Nemedian, but the voice was not
human. There was a terifying resonance about it, like a bell
tolling at midnight.</p>

<p>"There was no life in the Abyss, save that which was
incorporated in me," it tolled. "Nor was there light, nor motion,
nor any sound. Only the urge behind and beyond life guided and
impelled me on my upward journey, blind, insensate, inexorable.
Through ages upon ages, and the changeless strata of darkness I
climbed&mdash;"</p>

<p><br>
ENSORCELLED by that belling resonance, Conan crouched forgetful
of all else, until its hypnotic power caused a strange replacement
of faculties and perception, and sound created the illusion of
sight. Conan was no longer aware of the voice, save as far-off
rhythmical waves of sound. Transported beyond his age and his own
individuality, he was seeing the transmutation of the being men
called Khosatral Khel which crawled up from Night and the Abyss
ages ago to clothe itself in the substance of the material
universe.</p>

<p>But human flesh was too frail, too paltry to hold the terrific
essence that was Khosatral Khel. So he stood up in the shape and
aspect of a man, but his flesh was not flesh; nor the bone, bone;
nor blood, blood. He became a blasphemy against all nature, for he
caused to live and think and act a basic substance that before had
never known the pulse and stir of animate being.</p>

<p>He stalked through the world as a god, for no earthly weapon
could harm him, and to him a century was like an hour. In his
wanderings he came upon a primitive people inhabiting the island of
Dagonia, and it pleased him to give this race culture and
civilization, and by his aid they built the city of Dagon and they
abode there and worshipped him. Strange and grisly were his
servants, called from the dark corners of the planet where grim
survivals of forgotten ages yet lurked. His house in Dagon was
connected with every other house by tunnels through which his
shaven-headed priests bore victims for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>But after many ages, a fierce and brutish people appeared on the
shores of the sea. They called themselves Yuetshi, and after a
fierce battle were defeated and enslaved, and for nearly a
generation they died on the altars of Khosatral.</p>

<p>His sorcery kept them in bonds. Then their priest, a strange,
gaunt man of unknown race, plunged into the wilderness, and when he
returned he bore a knife that was of no earthly substance. It was
forged of a meteor, which flashed through the sky like a flaming
arrow and fell in a far valley. The slaves rose. Their saw-edged
crescents cut down the men of Dagon like sheep, and against that
unearthly knife the magic of Khosatral was impotent. While carnage
and slaughter bellowed through the red smoke that choked the
streets, the grimmest act of that grim drama was played in the
cryptic dome behind the great daised chamber with its copper throne
and its walls mottled like the skin of serpents.</p>

<p>From that dome, the Yuetshi priest emerged alone. He had not
slain his foe, because he wished to hold the threat of his loosing
over the heads of his own rebellious subjects. He had left
Khosatral lying upon the golden dais with the mystic knife across
his breast for a spell to hold him senseless and inanimate until
doomsday.</p>

<p>But the ages passed and the priest died, the towers of deserted
Dagon crumbled, the tales became dim, and the Yuetshi were reduced
by plagues and famines and war to scattered remnants, dwelling in
squalor along the seashore.</p>

<p>Only the cryptic dome resisted the rot of time, until a chance
thunderbolt and the curiosity of a fisherman lifted from the breast
of the god the magic knife and broke the spell. Khosatral Khel rose
and lived and waxed mighty once more. It pleased him to restore the
city as it was in the days before its fall. By his necromancy he
lifted the towers from the dust of forgotten millenia, and the folk
which had been dust for ages moved in life again.</p>

<p>But folk who have tasted of death are only partly alive. In the
dark corners of their souls and minds, death still lurks
unconquered. By night the people of Dagon moved and loved, hated
and feasted, and remembered the fall of Dagon and their own
slaughter only as a dim dream; they moved in an enchanted mist of
illusion, feeling the strangeness of their existence but not
inquiring the reasons therefor. With the coming of day, they sank
into deep sleep, to be roused again only by the coming of night,
which is akin to death.</p>

<p>All this rolled in a terrible panorama before Conan's
consciousness as he crouched beside the tapestried wall. His reason
staggered. All certainty and sanity were swept away, leaving a
shadowy universe through which stole hooded figures of grisly
potentialities. Through the belling of the voice, which was like a
tolling of triumph over the ordered laws of a sane planet, a human
sound anchored Conan's mind from its flight through spheres of
madness. It was the hysterical sobbing of a woman.</p>

<p>Involuntarily he sprung up.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6">6</a></h2>

<p class="first">JEHUNGIR AGHA waited with growing impatience in
his boat among the reeds. More than an hour passed, and Conan had
not reappeared. Doubtless he was still searching the island for the
girl he thought to be hidden there. But another surmise occurred to
the Agha. Suppose the hetman had left his warriors near by, and
that they should grow suspicious and come to investigate his long
absence? Jehungir spoke to the oarsmen, and the long boat slid from
among the reeds and glided toward the carven stairs.</p>

<p>Leaving half a dozen men in the boat, he took the rest, ten
mighty archers of Khawarizm, in spired helmets and tiger-skin
cloaks. Like hunters invading the retreat of the lion, they stole
forward under the trees, arrows on strings. Silence reigned over
the forest except when a great green thing that might have been a
parrot swirled over their heads with a low thunder of broad wings
and then sped off through the trees. With a sudden gesture,
Jehungir halted his party, and they stared incredulously at the
towers that showed through the verdure in the distance.</p>

<p>"Tarim!" muttered Jehungir. "The pirates have rebuilt the ruins!
Doubtless Conan is there. We must investigate this. A fortified
town this close to the mainland!&mdash;Come!"</p>

<p>With renewed caution, they glided through the trees. The game
had altered; from pursuers and hunters they had become spies.</p>

<p>And as they crept through the tangled gowth, the man they sought
was in peril more deadly than their filigreed arrows.</p>

<p><br>
CONAN realized with a crawling of his skin that beyond the wall
the belling voice had ceased. He stood motionless as a statue, his
gaze fixed on a curtained door through which he knew that a
culminating horror would presently appear.</p>

<p>It was dim and misty in the chamber, and Conan's hair began to
lift on his scalp as he looked. He saw a head and a pair of
gigantic shoulders grow out of the twilight doom. There was no
sound of footsteps, but the great dusky form grew more distinct
until Conan recognized the figure of a man. He was clad in sandals,
a skirt, and a broad shagreen girdle. His square-cut mane was
confined by a circle of gold. Conan stared at the sweep of the
monstrous shoulders, the breadth of swelling breast, the bands and
ridges and clusters of muscles on torso and limbs. The face was
without weakness and without mercy. The eyes were balls of dark
fire. And Conan knew that this was Khosatral Khel, the ancient from
the Abyss, the god of Dagonia.</p>

<p>No word was spoken. No word was necessary. Khosatral spread his
great arms, and Conan, crouching beneath them, slashed at the
giant's belly. Then he bounded back, eyes blazing with surprise.
The keen edge had rung on the mighty body as on an anvil,
rebounding without cutting. Then Khosatral came upon him in an
irrestible surge.</p>

<p>There was a fleeting concussion, a fierce writhing and
intertwining of limbs and bodies, and then Conan sprang clear,
every thew quivering from the violence of his efforts; blood
started where the grazing fingers had torn the skin. In that
instant of contact, he had experienced the ultimate madness of
blasphemed nature; no human flesh had bruised his, but metal
animated and sentient; it was a body of living iron which opposed
his.</p>

<p>Khosatral loomed above the warrior in the gloom. Once let those
great fingers lock and they would not loosen until the human body
hung limp in their grasp. In that twilit chamber it was as if a man
fought with a dream-monster in a nightmare.</p>

<p>Flinging down his useless sword, Conan caught up a heavy bench
and hurled it with all his power. It was such a missile as few men
could even lift. On Khosatral's mighty breast it smashed into
shreds and splinters. It did not even shake the giant on his braced
legs. His face lost something of its human aspect, a nimbus of fire
played about his awesome head, and like a moving tower he came
on.</p>

<p>With a desperate wrench Conan ripped a whole section of tapestry
from the wall and whirling it, with a muscular effort greater than
that required for throwing the bench, he flung it over the giant's
head. For an instant Khosatral floundered, smothered and blinded by
the clinging stuff that resisted his strength as wood or steel
could not have done, and in that instant Conan caught up his
scimitar and shot out into the corridor. Without checking his
speed, he hurled himself through the door of the adjoining chamber,
slammed the door, and shot the bolt.</p>

<p>Then as he wheeled, he stopped short, all the blood in him
seeming to surge to his head. Crouching on a heap of silk cushions,
golden hair streaming over her naked shoulders, eyes blank with
terror, was the woman for whom he had dared so much. He almost
forgot the horror at his heels until a splintering crash behind him
brought him to his senses. He caught up the girl and sprang for the
opposite door. She was too helpless with fright either to resist or
to aid him. A faint whimper was the only sound of which she seemed
capable.</p>

<p>Conan wasted no time trying the door. A shattering stroke of his
scimitar hewed the lock asunder, and as he sprang through to the
stair that loomed beyond it, he saw the head and shoulders of
Khosatral crash through the other door. The colossus was
splintering the massive panels as if they were of cardboard.</p>

<p>Conan raced up the stair, carrying the big girl over one
shoulder as easily as if she had been a child. Where he was going
he had no idea, but the stair ended at the door of a round, domed
chamber. Khosatral was coming up the stair behind them, silently as
a wind of death, and as swiftly.</p>

<p>The chamber's walls were of solid steel, and so was the door.
Conan shut it and dropped in place the great bars with which it was
furnished. The thought struck him that this was Khosatral's
chamber, where he locked himself in to sleep securely from the
monsters he had loosed from the Pits to do his bidding.</p>

<p><br>
HARDLY were the bolts in place when the great door shook and
trembled to the giant's assault. Conan shrugged his shoulders. This
was the end of the trail. There was no other door in the chamber,
nor any window. Air, and the strange misty light, evidently came
from interstices in the dome. He tested the nicked edge of his
scimitar, quite cool now that he was at bay. He had done his
volcanic best to escape; when the giant came crashing through that
door, he would explode in another savage onslaught with the useless
sword, not because he expected it to do any good, but because it
was his nature to die fighting. For the moment there was no course
of action to take, and his calmness was not forced or feigned.</p>

<p>The gaze he turned on his fair companion was as admiring and
intense as if he had a hundred years to live. He had dumped her
unceremoniously on the floor when he turned to close the door, and
she had risen to her knees, mechanically arranging her streaming
locks and her scanty garment. Conan's fierce eyes glowed with
approval as they devoured her thick golden hair, her clear, wide
eyes, her milky skin, sleek with exuberant health, the firm swell
of her breasts, the contours of her splendid hips.</p>

<p>A low cry escaped her as the door shook and a bolt gave way with
a groan.</p>

<p>Conan did not look around. He knew the door would hold a little
while longer.</p>

<p>"They told me you had escaped," he said. "A Yuetshi fisherman
told me you were hiding here. What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Octavia," she gasped mechanically. Then words came in a rush.
She caught at him with desperate fingers. "Oh Mitra! what nightmare
is this? The people&mdash;the dark-skinned people&mdash;one of them
caught me in the forest and brought me here. They carried me
to&mdash;to that&mdash;that thing. He told me&mdash;he
said&mdash;am I mad? Is this a dream?"</p>

<p>He glanced at the door which bulged inward as if from the impact
of a battering-ram.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "it's no dream. That hinge is giving way. Strange
that a devil has to break down a door like a common man; but after
all, his strength itself is a diabolism."</p>

<p>"Can you not kill him?" she panted. "You are strong."</p>

<p>Conan was too honest to lie to her. "If a mortal man could kill
him, he'd be dead now," he answered. "I nicked my blade on his
belly."</p>

<p>Her eyes dulled. "Then you must die, and I must&mdash;oh Mitra!"
she screamed in sudden frenzy, and Conan caught her hands, fearing
that she would harm herself. "He told me what he was going to do to
me!" she panted. "Kill me! Kill me with your sword before he bursts
the door!"</p>

<p>Conan looked at her and shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can," he said. "That won't be much, but it'll
give you a chance to get past him down the stair. Then run for the
cliffs. I have a boat tied at the foot of the steps. If you can get
out of the palace, you may escape him yet. The people of this city
are all asleep."</p>

<p>She dropped her head in her hands. Conan took up his scimitar
and moved over to stand before the echoing door. One watching him
would not have realized that he was waiting for a death he regarded
as inevitable. His eyes smoldered more vividly; his muscular hand
knotted harder on his hilt; that was all.</p>

<p>The hinges had given under the giant's terrible assault, and the
door rocked crazily, held only by the bolts. And these solid steel
bars were buckling, bending, bulging out of their sockets. Conan
watched in an almost impersonal fascination, envying the monster
his inhuman strength.</p>

<p>Then, without warning, the bombardment ceased. In the stillness,
Conan heard other noises on the landing outside&mdash;the beat of
wings, and a muttering voice that was like the whining of wind
through midnight branches. Then presently there was silence, but
there was a new feel in the air. Only the whetted instincts of
barbarism could have sensed it, but Conan knew, without seeing or
hearing him leave, that the master of Dagon no longer stood outside
the door.</p>

<p>He glared through a crack that had been started in the steel of
the portal. The landing was empty. He drew the warped bolts and
cautiously pulled aside the sagging door. Khosatral was not on the
stair, but far below he heard the clang of a metal door. He did not
know whether the giant was plotting new deviltries or had been
summoned away by that muttering voice, but he wasted no time in
conjectures.</p>

<p>He called to Octavia, and the new note in his voice brought her
up to her feet and to his side almost without her conscious
volition.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Don't stop to talk!" He caught her wrist. "Come on!" The chance
for action had transformed him; his eyes blazed, his voice
crackled. "The knife!" he muttered, while almost dragging the girl
down the stair in his fierce haste. "The magic Yuetshi blade! He
left it in the dome! I&mdash;" his voice died suddenly as a clear
mental picture sprang up before him. That dome adjoined the great
room where stood the copper throne&mdash;sweat started out on his
body. The only way to that dome was through that room with the
copper throne and the foul thing that slumbered in it.</p>

<p>But he did not hesitate. Swiftly they descended the stair,
crossed the chamber, descended the next stair, and came into the
great dim hall with its mysterious hangings. They had seen no sign
of the colossus. Halting before the great bronze-valved door, Conan
caught Octavia by her shoulders and shook her in his intensity.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he snapped. "I'm going into the room and fasten the
door. Stand here and listen; if Khosatral comes, call to me. If you
hear me cry out for you to go, run as though the Devil were on your
heels&mdash;which he probably will be. Make for that door at the
other end of the hall, because I'll be past helping you. I'm going
for the Yuetshi knife!"</p>

<p>Before she could voice the protest her lips were framing, he had
slid through the valves and shut them behind him. He lowered the
bolt cautiously, not noticing that it could be worked from the
outside. In the dim twilight his gaze sought that grim copper
throne; yes, the scaly brute was still there, filling the throne
with its loathsome coils. He saw a door behind the throne and knew
that it led into the dome. But to reach it he must mount the dais,
a few feet from the throne itself.</p>

<p>A wind blowing across the green floor would have made more noise
than Conan's slinking feet. Eyes glued on the sleeping reptile he
reached the dais and mounted the glass steps. The snake had not
moved. He was reaching for the door...</p>

<p>The bolt on the bronze portal clanged and Conan stifled an awful
oath as he saw Octavia come into the room. She stared about,
uncertain in the deeper gloom, and he stood frozen, not daring to
shout a warning. Then she saw his shadowy figure and ran toward the
dais, crying: "I want to go with you! I'm afraid to stay
alone&mdash;oh!" She threw up her hands with a terrible scream as
for the first time she saw the occupant of the throne. The
wedge-shaped head had lifted from its coils and thrust out toward
her on a yard of shining neck.</p>

<p>Then with a smooth, flowing motion, it began to ooze from the
throne, coil by coil, its ugly head bobbing in the direction of the
paralyzed girl.</p>

<p><br>
CONAN cleared the space between him and the throne with a
desperate bound, his scimitar swinging with all his power. And with
such blinding speed did the serpent move that it whipped about and
met him in full midair, lapping his limbs and body with half a
dozen coils. His half-checked stroke fell futilely as he crashed
down on the dais, gashing the scaly trunk but not severing it.</p>

<p>Then he was writhing on the glass steps with fold after slimy
fold knotting about him, twisting, crushing, killing him. His right
arm was still free, but he could get no purchase to strike a
killing blow, and he knew one blow must suffice. With a groaning
convulsion of muscular expansion that bulged his veins almost to
bursting on his temples and tied his muscles in quivering, tortured
knots, he heaved up on his feet, lifting almost the full weight of
that forty-foot devil.</p>

<p>An instant he reeled on wide-braced legs, feeling his ribs
caving in on his vitals and his sight growing dark, while his
scimitar gleamed above his head. Then it fell, shearing through the
scales and flesh and vertebrae. And where there had been one huge,
writhing cable, now there were horribly two, lashing and flopping
in the death throes. Conan staggered away from their blind strokes.
He was sick and dizzy, and blood oozed from his nose. Groping in a
dark mist he clutched Octavia and shook her until she gasped for
breath.</p>

<p>"Next time I tell you to stay somewhere," he gasped, "you
stay!"</p>

<p>He was too dizzy even to know whether she replied. Taking her
wrist like a truant schoolgirl, he led her around the hideous
stumps that still loomed and knotted on the floor. Somewhere, in
the distance, he thought he heard men yelling, but his ears were
still roaring so that he could not be sure.</p>

<p>The door gave to his efforts. If Khosatral had placed the snake
there to guard the thing he feared, evidently he considered it
ample precaution. Conan half expected some other monstrosity to
leap at him with the opening of the door, but in the dimmer light
he saw only the vague sweep of the arch above, a dully gleaming
block of gold, and a half-moon glimmer on the stone.</p>

<p>With a gasp of gratification, he scooped it up and did not
linger for further exploration. He turned and fled across the room
and down the great hall toward the distant door that he felt led to
the outer air. He was correct. A few minutes later he emerged into
the silent streets, half carrying, half guiding his companion.
There was no one to be seen, but beyond the western wall there
sounded cries and moaning wails that made Octavia tremble. He led
her to the southwestern wall and without difficulty found a stone
stair that mounted the rampart. He had appropriated a thick
tapestry rope in the great hall, and now, having reached the
parapet, he looped the soft, strong cord about the girl's hips and
lowered her to the earth. Then, making one end fast to a merlon, he
slid down after her. There was but one way of escape from the
island&mdash;the stair on the western cliffs. In that direction he
hurried, swinging wide around the spot from which had come the
cries and the sound of terrible blows.</p>

<p>Octavia sensed that grim peril lurked in those leafy fastnesses.
Her breath came pantingly and she pressed close to her protector.
But the forest was silent now, and they saw no shape of menace
until they emerged from the trees and glimpsed a figure standing on
the edge of the cliffs.</p>

<p>Jehungir Agha had escaped the doom that had overtaken his
warriors when an iron giant sallied suddenly from the gate and
battered and crushed them into bits of shredded flesh and
splintered bone. When he saw the swords of his archers break on
that manlike juggernaut, he had known it was no human foe they
faced, and he had fled, hiding in the deep woods until the sounds
of slaughter ceased. Then he crept back to the stair, but his
boatmen were not waiting for him.</p>

<p>They had heard the screams, and presently, waiting nervously,
had seen, on the cliff above them, a blood-smeared monster waving
gigantic arms in awful triumph. They had waited for no more. When
Jehungir came upon the cliffs, they were just vanishing among the
reeds beyond earshot. Khosatral was gone&mdash;had either returned
to the city or was prowling the forest in search of the man who had
escaped him outside the walls.</p>

<p><br>
JEHUNGIR was just preparing to descend the stairs and depart in
Conan's boat, when he saw the hetman and the girl emerge from the
trees. The experience which had congealed his blood and almost
blasted his reason had not altered Jehungir's intentions towards
the kozak chief. The sight of the man he had come to kill filled
him with gratification. He was astonished to see the girl he had
given to Jelal Khan, but he wasted no time on her. Lifting his bow
he drew the shaft to its head and loosed. Conan crouched and the
arrow splintered on a tree, and Conan laughed.</p>

<p>"Dog!" he taunted. "You can't hit me! I was not born to die on
Hyrkanian steel! Try again, pig of Turan!"</p>

<p>Jehungir did not try again. That was his last arrow. He drew his
scimitar and advanced, confident in his spired helmet and
close-meshed mail. Conan met him halfway in a blinding whirl of
swords. The curved blades ground together, sprang apart, circled in
glittering arcs that blurred the sight which tried to follow them.
Octavia, watching, did not see the stroke, but she heard its
chopping impact and saw Jehungir fall, blood spurting from his side
where the Cimmerian's steel had sundered his mail and bitten to his
spine.</p>

<p>But Octavia's scream was not caused by the death of her former
master. With a crash of bending boughs, Khosatral Khel was upon
them. The girl could not flee; a moaning cry escaped her as her
knees gave way and pitched her groveling to the sward.</p>

<p>Conan, stooping above the body of the Agha, made no move to
escape. Shifting his reddened scimitar to his left hand, he drew
the great half-blade of the Yuetshi. Khosatral Khel was towering
above him, his arms lifted like mauls, but as the blade caught the
sheen of the sun, the giant gave back suddenly.</p>

<p>But Conan's blood was up. He rushed in, slashing with the
crescent blade. And it did not splinter. Under its edge, the dusky
metal of Khosatral's body gave way like common flesh beneath a
cleaver. From the deep gash flowed a strange ichor, and Khosatral
cried out like the dirging of a great bell. His terrible arms
flailed down, but Conan, quicker than the archers who had died
beneath those awful flails, avoided their strokes and struck again
and yet again. Khosatral reeled and tottered; his cries were awful
to hear, as if metal were given a tongue of pain, as if iron
shrieked and bellowed under torment.</p>

<p>Then, wheeling away, he staggered into the forest; he reeled in
his gait, crashed through bushes, and caromed off trees. Yet though
Conan followed him with the speed of hot passion, the walls and
towers of Dagon loomed through the trees before the man came with
dagger-reach of the giant.</p>

<p>Then Khosatral turned again, flailing the air with desperate
blows, but Conan, fired to berserk fury, was not to be denied. As a
panther strikes down a bull moose at bay, so he plunged under the
bludgeoning arms and drove the crescent blade to the hilt under the
spot where a human's heart would be.</p>

<p>Khosatral reeled and fell. In the shape of a man he reeled, but
it was not the shape of a man that struck the loam. Where there had
been the likeness of a human face, there was no face at all, and
the metal limbs melted and changed... Conan, who had not shrunk
from Khosatral living, recoiled blenching for Khosatral dead, for
he had witnessed an awful transmutation; in his dying throes
Khosatral Khel had become again the thing that had crawled up from
the Abyss millennia gone. Gagging with intolerable repugnance,
Conan turned to flee the sight; and he was suddenly aware that the
pinnacles of Dagon no longer glimmered through the trees. They had
faded like smoke&mdash;the battlements, the crenellated towers, the
great bronze gates, the velvets, the gold, the ivory, and the
dark-haired women, and the men with their shaven skulls. With the
passing of the inhuman intellect which had given them rebirth, they
had faded back into the dust which they had been for ages
uncounted. Only the stumps of broken columns rose above crumbling
walls and broken paves and shattered dome. Conan again looked upon
the ruins of Xapur as he remembered them.</p>

<p><br>
THE wild hetman stood like a statue for a space, dimly grasping
something of the cosmic tragedy of the fitful ephemera called
mankind and the hooded shapes of darkness which prey upon it. Then
as he heard his voice called in accents of fear, he started, as one
awakening from a dream, glanced again at the thing on the ground,
shuddered and turned away toward the cliffs and the girl that
waited there.</p>

<p>She was peering fearfully under the trees, and she greeted him
with a half-stifled cry of relief. He had shaken off the dim
monstrous visions which had momentarily haunted him, and was his
exuberant self again.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she shuddered.</p>

<p>"Gone back to Hell whence he crawled," he replied cheerfully.
"Why didn't you climb the stair and make your escape in my
boat?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't desert&mdash;" she began, then changed her mind, and
amended rather sulkily, "I have nowhere to go. The Hyrkanians would
enslave me again, and the pirates would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What of the kozaks?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"Are they better than the pirates?" she asked scornfully.
Conan's admiration increased to see how well she had recovered her
poise after having endured such frantic terror. Her arrogance
amused him.</p>

<p>"You seemed to think so in the camp by Ghori," he answered. "You
were free enough with your smiles then."</p>

<p>Her red lips curled in disdain. "Do you think I was enamored of
you? Do you dream that I would have shamed myself before an
ale-guzzling, meat-gorging barbarian unless I had to? My
master&mdash;whose body lies there&mdash;forced me to do as I
did."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Conan seemed rather crestfallen. Then he laughed with
undiminished zest. "No matter. You belong to me now. Give me a
kiss."</p>

<p>"You dare ask&mdash;"she began angrily, when she felt herself
snatched off her feet and crushed to the hetman's muscular breast.
She fought him fiercely, with all the supple strength of her
magnificent youth, but he only laughed exuberantly, drunk with the
possession of this splendid creature writhing in his arms.</p>

<p>He crushed her struggles easily, drinking the nectar of her lips
with all the unrestrained passion that was his, until the arms that
strained against them melted and twined convulsively about his
massive neck. Then he laughed down into the clear eyes, and said:
"Why should not a chief of the Free People be preferable to a
city-bred dog of Turan?"</p>

<p>She shook back her tawny locks, still tingling in every nerve
from the fire of his kisses. She did not loosen her arms from his
neck. "Do you deem yourself an Agha's equal?" she challenged.</p>

<p>He laughed and strode with her in his arms toward the stair.
"You shall judge," he boasted. "I'll burn Khawarizm for a torch to
light your way to my tent."</p>
