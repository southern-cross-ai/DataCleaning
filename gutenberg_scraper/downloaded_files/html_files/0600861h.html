<p class="cp"><i>A tale of Solomon Kane, an African slave train,
and the <br>
shuddery horror of dim footfalls in a long-forgotten tomb.</i></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">SOLOMON KANE gazed sombrely at the native woman
who lay dead at his feet. Little more than a girl she was, but her
wasted limbs and staring eyes showed that she had suffered much
before death brought her merciful relief. Kane noted the chain
galls on her limbs, the deep crisscrossed scars on her back, the
mark of the yoke on her neck. His cold eyes deepened strangely,
showing chill glints and lights like clouds passing across depths
of ice.</p>

<p>"Even into this lonesome land they come," he muttered. "I had
not thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>He raised his head and gazed eastward. Black dots against the
blue wheeled and circled.</p>

<p>"The kites mark their trail," muttered the tall Englishman.
"Destruction goeth before them and death followeth after. Woe unto
ye, sons of iniquity, for the wrath of God is upon ye. The cords be
loosed on the iron necks of the hounds of hate and the bow of
vengeance is strung. Ye are proud-stomached and strong, and the
people cry out beneath your feet, but retribution cometh in the
blackness of midnight and the redness of dawn."</p>

<p>He shifted the belt that held his heavy pistols and the keen
dirk, instinctively touched the long rapier at his hip, and went
stealthily but swiftly eastward. A cruel anger burned in his deep
eyes like blue volcanic fires burning beneath leagues of ice, and
the hand that gripped his long, cat-headed stave hardened into
iron.</p>

<p>After some hours of steady striding, he came within hearing of
the slave train that wound its laborious way through the jungle.
The piteous cries of the slaves, the shouts and curses of the
drivers, and the cracking of the whips came plainly to his ears.
Another hour brought him even with them, and gliding along through
the jungle parallel to the trail taken by the slavers, he spied
upon them safely. Kane had fought Indians in Darien and had learned
much of their woodcraft.</p>

<p>More than a hundred natives, young men and women, staggered
along the trail, stark naked and made fast together by cruel
yoke-like affairs of wood. These yokes, rough and heavy, fitted
over their necks and linked them together, two by two. The yokes
were in turn fettered together, making one long chain. Of the
drivers there were fifteen Arabs and some seventy black warriors,
whose weapons and fantastic apparel showed them to be of some
eastern tribe&mdash;one of those tribes subjugated and made Moslems
and allies by the conquering Arabs.</p>

<p>Five Arabs walked ahead of the train with some thirty of their
warriors, and five brought up the rear with the rest of the negro
warriors. The rest marched beside the staggering slaves, urging
them along with shouts and curses and with long, cruel whips which
brought spurts of blood at almost every blow. These slavers were
fools as well as rogues, reflected Kane&mdash;not more than half of
them would survive the hardships of the trek to the coast.</p>

<p>He wondered at the presence of these raiders, for this country
lay far to the south of the districts which they usually
frequented. But avarice can drive men far, as the Englishman knew.
He had dealt with these gentry of old. Even as he watched, old
scars burned in his back&mdash;scars made by Moslem whips in a
Turkish galley. And deeper still burned Kane's unquenchable
hate.</p>

<p>The Puritan followed, shadowing his foes like a ghost, and as he
stole through the jungle, he racked his brain for a plan. How might
he prevail against that horde? All of the Arabs and many of their
allies were armed with guns&mdash;long, clumsy firelock affairs, it
is true, but guns just the same, enough to awe any tribe of natives
who might oppose them. Some carried in their wide girdles long,
silver-chased pistols of more effective pattern&mdash;flintlocks of
Moorish and Turkish make.</p>

<p>Kane followed like a brooding ghost and his rage and hatred ate
into his soul like a canker. Each crack of the whips was like a
blow on his own shoulders. The heat and cruelty of the tropics play
queer tricks. Ordinary passions become monstrous things; irritation
runs to a berserker rage; anger flames into unexpected madness and
men kill in a red mist of passion, and wonder, aghast,
afterward.</p>

<p>The fury Solomon Kane felt would have been enough at any time
and in any place to shake a man to his foundation. Now it assumed
monstrous proportions, so that Kane shivered as if with a chill;
iron claws scratched at his brain and he saw the slaves and the
slavers through a crimson mist. Yet he might not have put his
hate-born insanity into action had it not been for a mishap.</p>

<p>One of the slaves, a slim young girl, suddenly faltered and
slipped to the earth, dragging her yoke-mate with her. A tall,
hook-nosed Arab yelled savagely and lashed her viciously. Her
yoke-mate staggered partly up, but the girl remained prone,
writhing weakly beneath the lash but evidently unable to rise. She
whimpered pitifully between her parched lips, and other slavers
came about her, their whips descending on her quivering flesh in
slashes of red agony.</p>

<p>A half hour of rest and a little water would have revived her,
but the Arabs had no time to spare. Solomon, biting his arm until
his teeth met in the flesh as he fought for control, thanked God
that the lashing had ceased and steeled himself for the swift flash
of the dagger that would put the child beyond torment. But the
Arabs were in a mood for sport. Since the girl would fetch them no
profit on the market block, they would utilize her for their
pleasure&mdash;and their humour was such as to turn men's blood to
icy water.</p>

<p>A shout from the first whipper brought the rest crowding around,
their bearded faces split in grins of delighted anticipation, while
the black warriors edged nearer, their brutish eyes gleaming.
The wretched slaves realized their masters' intentions and a
chorus of pitiful cries rose from them.</p>

<p>Kane, sick with horror, realized, too, that the girl's was to be
no easy death. He knew what the tall Moslem intended to do, as he
stooped over her with a keen dagger such as the Arabs used for
skinning game. Madness overcame the Englishman. He valued his own
life little; he had risked it without thought for the sake of a
pagan child or a small animal. Yet he would not have premeditatedly
thrown away his one hope of succouring the wretches in the train.
But he acted without conscious thought. A pistol was smoking in his
hand and the tall butcher was down in the dust of the trail with
his brains oozing out, before Kane realized what he had done.</p>

<p>He was almost as astonished as the Arabs, who stood frozen for a
moment and then burst into a medley of yells. Several threw up
their clumsy firelocks and sent their heavy balls crashing through
the trees, and the rest, thinking no doubt that they were ambushed,
led a reckless charge into the jungle. The bold suddenness of that
move was Kane's undoing. Had they hesitated a moment longer he
might have faded away unobserved, but as it was he saw no choice
but to meet them openly and sell his life as highly as he
could.</p>

<p>And indeed it was with a certain ferocious fascination that he
faced his howling attackers. They halted in sudden amazement as the
tall, grim Englishman stepped from behind his tree, and in that
instant one of them died with a bullet from Kane's remaining pistol
in his heart. Then with yells of savage rage they flung themselves
on their lone defier.</p>

<p>Solomon Kane placed his back against a huge tree and his long
rapier played a shining wheel about him. An Arab and three of his
equally fiercer allies were hacking at him with their heavy curved
blades while the rest milled about, snarling like wolves, as they
sought to drive in blade or ball without maiming one of their own
number.</p>

<p><br>
THE flickering rapier parried the whistling scimitars and the
Arab died on its point, which seemed to hesitate in his heart only
an instant before it pierced the brain of a sword-wielding warrior.
Another attacker dropped his sword and leaped in to grapple at
close quarters. He was disembowelled by the dirk in Kane's left
hand, and the others gave back in sudden fear. A heavy ball smashed
against the tree close to Kane's head and he tensed himself to
spring and die in the thick of them. Then their sheikh lashed them
on with his long whip, and Kane heard him shouting fiercely for his
warriors to take the infidel alive. Kane answered the command with
a sudden cast of his dirk, which hummed so close to the sheikh's
head that it slit his turban and sank deep in the shoulder of one
behind him.</p>

<p>The sheikh drew his silver-chased pistols, threatening his own
men with death if they did not take this fierce opponent, and they
charged in again desperately. One of the black men ran full upon
Kane's sword and an Arab behind the fellow, with ruthless craft,
thrust the screaming wretch suddenly forward on the weapon, driving
it hilt-deep in his writhing body, fouling the blade. Before Kane
could wrench it clear, with a yell of triumph the pack rushed in on
him and bore him down by sheer weight of numbers. As they grappled
him from all sides, the Puritan wished in vain for the dirk he had
thrown away. But even so, his taking was none too easy.</p>

<p>Blood spattered and faces caved in beneath his iron-hard fists
that splintered teeth and shattered bone. A black warrior reeled away
disabled from a vicious drive of knee to groin. Even when they had
him stretched out and piled man-weight on him, until he could no
longer strike with fists or foot, his long lean fingers sank
fiercely through a black beard to lock about a corded throat in a
grip that took the power of three strong men to break and left the
victim gasping and green-faced.</p>

<p>At last, panting from the terrific struggle, they had him bound
hand and foot and the sheikh, thrusting his pistols back into his
silken sash, came striding to stand and look down at his captive.
Kane glared up at the tall, lean frame, at the hawk-like face with
its black curled beard and arrogant brown eyes.</p>

<p>"I am the sheikh Hassim ben Said," said the Arab. "Who are
you?"</p>

<p>"My name is Solomon Kane," growled the Puritan in the sheikh's
own language. "I am an Englishman, you heathen jackal."</p>

<p>The dark eyes of the Arab flickered with interest.</p>

<p>"Suleiman Kahani," said he, giving the Arabesque equivalent of
the English name. "I have heard of you&mdash;you have fought the
Turks betimes and the Barbary corsairs have licked their wounds
because of you."</p>

<p>Kane deigned no reply. Hassim shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You will bring a fine price," said he. "Mayhap I will take you
to Stamboul, where there are Shahs who would desire such a man
among their slaves. And I mind me now of one Kemal Bey, a man of
ships, who wears a deep scar across his face of your making and who
curses the name of Englishman. He will pay me a high price for you.
And behold, oh Frank, I do you the honour of appointing you a
separate guard. You shall not walk in the yoke-chain but free save
for your hands."</p>

<p>Kane made no answer, and at a sign from the sheikh, he was
hauled to his feet and his bonds loosened except for his hands,
which they left bound firmly behind him. A stout cord was looped
about his neck and the other end of this was given into the hand of
a huge black warrior who bore in his free hand a great curved
scimitar.</p>

<p>"And now what think ye of my favour to you, Frank?" queried the
sheikh.</p>

<p>"I am thinking," answered Kane in a slow, deep voice of menace,
"that I would trade my soul's salvation to face you and your sword,
alone and unarmed, and to tear the heart from your breast with my
naked fingers."</p>

<p>Such was the concentrated hate in his deep resounding voice, and
such primal, unconquerable fury blazed from his terrible eyes, that
the hardened and fearless chieftain blanched and involuntarily
recoiled as if from a maddened beast.</p>

<p>Then Hassim recovered his poise and with a short word to his
followers, strode to the head of the cavalcade. Kane noted with
thankfulness that the respite occasioned by his capture had given
the girl who had fallen a chance to rest and revive. The skinning
knife had not had time to more than touch her; she was able to reel
along. Night was not far away. Soon the slavers would be forced to
halt and camp.</p>

<p>The Englishman perforce took up the trek, his black guard remaining a
few paces behind with a huge blade ever ready. Kane also noted with
a touch of grim vanity, that three more warriors marched close
behind, muskets ready and matches burning. They had tasted his
prowess and they were taking no chances. His weapons had been
recovered and Hassim had promptly appropriated all except the
cat-headed ju-ju stave. This had been contemptuously cast aside by
him and taken up by one of the blacks.</p>

<p><br>
THE Englishman was presently aware that a lean, grey-bearded
Arab was walking along at his side. This Arab seemed desirous of
speaking but strangely timid, and the source of his timidity
seemed, curiously enough, the ju-ju stave which he had taken from
the black man who had picked it up, and which he now turned uncertainly
in his hands.</p>

<p>"I am Yussef the Hadji," said this Arab suddenly. "I have naught
against you. I had no hand in attacking you and would be your
friend if you would let me. Tell me, Frank, whence comes this staff
and how comes it into your hands?"</p>

<p>Kane's first inclination was to consign his questioner to the
infernal regions, but a certain sincerity of manner in the old man
made him change his mind and he answered: "It was given me by my
blood-brother&mdash;a black magician of the Slave Coast, named
N'Longa."</p>

<p>The old Arab nodded and muttered in his beard and presently sent
a black running forward to bid Hassim return. The tall sheikh
presently came striding back along the slow-moving column, with a
clank and jingle of daggers and sabres, with Kane's dirk and
pistols thrust into his wide sash.</p>

<p>"Look, Hassim," the old Arab thrust forward the stave, "you cast
it away without knowing what you did!"</p>

<p>"And what of it?" growled the sheikh. "I see naught but a
staff&mdash;sharp-pointed and with the head of a cat on the other
end&mdash;a staff with strange infidel carvings upon it."</p>

<p>The older man shook it at him in excitement: "This staff is
older than the world! It holds mighty magic! I have read of it in
the old iron-bound books and Mohammed&mdash;on whom
peace!&mdash;himself hath spoken of it by allegory and parable! See
the cat-head upon it? It is the head of a goddess of ancient Egypt!
Ages ago, before Mohammed taught, before Jerusalem was, the priests
of Bast bore this rod before the bowing, chanting worshippers! With
it Musa did wonders before Pharaoh and when the Yahudi fled from
Egypt they bore it with them. And for centuries it was the sceptre
of Israel and Judah and with it Suleiman ben Daoud drove forth the
conjurers and magicians and prisoned the efreets and the evil
genii! Look! Again in the hands of a Suleiman we find the ancient
rod!"</p>

<p>Old Yussef had worked himself into a pitch of almost fanatic
fervour but Hassim merely shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It did not save the Jews from bondage nor this Suleiman from
our captivity," said he. "I value it not as much as I esteem the
long thin blade with which he loosed the souls of three of my best
swordsmen."</p>

<p>Yussef shook his head. "Your mockery will bring you to no good
end, Hassim. Some day you will meet a power that will not divide
before your sword or fall to your bullets. I will keep the staff,
and I warn you&mdash;abuse not the Frank. He has borne the holy and
terrible staff of Suleiman and Musa and the Pharaohs, and who knows
what magic he has drawn there from? For it is older than the world
and has known the terrible hands of strange pre-Adamite priests in
the silent cities beneath the seas, and has drawn from an Elder
World mystery and magic unguessed by humankind. There were strange
kings and stranger priests when the dawns were young, and evil was,
even in their day. And with this staff they fought the evil which
was ancient when their strange world was young, so many millions of
years ago that a man would shudder to count them."</p>

<p>Hassim answered impatiently and strode away with old Yussef
following him persistently and chattering away in a querulous tone.
Kane shrugged his mighty shoulders. With what he knew of the
strange powers of that strange staff, he was not one to question
the old man's assertions, fantastic as they seemed.</p>

<p>This much he knew&mdash;that it was made of a wood that existed
nowhere on earth today. It needed but the proof of sight and touch
to realize that its material had grown in some world apart. The
exquisite workmanship of the head, of a pre-pyramidal age, and the
hieroglyphics, symbols of a language that was forgotten when Rome
was young&mdash;these, Kane sensed, were additions as modern to the
antiquity of the staff itself as would be English words carved on
the stone monoliths of Stonehenge.</p>

<p>As for the cat-head&mdash;looking at it sometimes Kane had a
peculiar feeling of alteration; a faint sensing that once the
pommel of the staff was carved with a different design. The
dust-ancient Egyptian who had carved the head of Bast had merely
altered the original figure, and what that figure had been, Kane
had never tried to guess. A close scrutiny of the staff always
aroused a disquieting and almost dizzy suggestion of abysses of
aeons, unprovocative to further speculation.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The day wore on. The sun beat down mercilessly, then screened
itself in the great trees as it slanted toward the horizon. The
slaves suffered fiercely for water and a continual whimpering rose
from their ranks as they staggered blindly on. Some fell and
half-crawled, and were half-dragged by their reeling yoke-mates.
When all were buckling from exhaustion, the sun dipped, night
rushed on, and a halt was called. Camp was pitched, guards thrown
out. The slaves were fed scantily and given enough water to keep
life in them&mdash;but only just enough. Their fetters were not
loosened, but they were allowed to sprawl about as they might.
Their fearful thirst and hunger having been somewhat eased, they
bore the discomforts of their shackles with characteristic
stoicism.</p>

<p>Kane was fed without his hands being untied, and he was given
all the water he wished. The patient eyes of the slaves watched him
drink, silently, and he was sorely ashamed to guzzle what others
suffered for; he ceased before his thirst was fully quenched. A
wide clearing had been selected, on all sides of which rose
gigantic trees. After the Arabs had eaten and while the black
Moslems were still cooking their food, old Yussef came to Kane and
began to talk about the staff again. Kane answered his questions
with admirable patience, considering the hatred he bore the whole
race to which the Hadji belonged, and during the conversation,
Hassim came striding up and looked down in contempt. Hassim, Kane
ruminated, was the very symbol of militant Islam&mdash;bold,
reckless, materialistic, sparing nothing, fearing nothing, as sure
of his own destiny and as contemptuous of the rights of others as
the most powerful Western king.</p>

<p>"Are you maundering about that stick again?" he gibed. "Hadji,
you grow childish in your old age."</p>

<p>Yussef's beard quivered in anger. He shook the staff at his
sheikh like a threat of evil.</p>

<p>"Your mockery little befits your rank, Hassim," he snapped. "We
are in the heart of a dark and demon-haunted land, to which long
ago were banished the devils from Arabia; if this staff, which any
but a fool can tell is no rod of any world we know, has existed
down to our day, who knows what other things, tangible or
intangible, may have existed through the ages? This very trail we
follow&mdash;know you how old it is? Men followed it before the
Seljuk came out of the East or the Roman came out of the West. Over
this very trail, legends say, the great Suleiman came when he drove
the demons westward out of Asia and prisoned them in strange
prisons. And will you say&mdash;"</p>

<p>A wild shout interrupted him. Out of the shadows of the jungle a
black came flying as if from the hounds of Doom. With arms
flinging wildly, eyes rolling to display the whites, and mouth wide
open so that all his gleaming teeth were visible, he made an image
of stark terror not soon forgotten. The Moslem horde leaped up,
snatching their weapons, and Hassim swore:</p>

<p>"That's Ali, whom I sent to scout for meat&mdash;perchance a
lion&mdash;"</p>

<p>But no lion followed the black man who fell at Hassim's feet, mouthing
gibberish and pointing wildly back at the black jungle whence the
nerve-strung watchers expected some brain-shattering horror to
burst.</p>

<p>"He says he found a strange mausoleum back in the jungle," said
Hassim with a scowl, "but he cannot tell what frightened him. He
only knows a great horror overwhelmed him and sent him flying. Ali,
you are a fool and a rogue."</p>

<p>He kicked the grovelling black viciously, but the other Arabs
drew about him in some uncertainty. The panic was spreading among
the native warriors.</p>

<p>"They will bolt in spite of us," muttered a bearded Arab,
uneasily watching the native allies who, milled together, jabbered
excitedly and flung fearsome glances over the shoulders. "Hassim,
'twere better to march on a few miles. This is an evil place after
all, and though 'tis likely the fool, Ali, was frighted by his own
shadow&mdash;still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Still," jeered the sheikh, "you will all feel better when we
have left it behind. Good enough; to still your fears I will move
camp&mdash;but first I will have a look at this thing. Lash up the
slaves; we'll swing into the jungle and pass by this mausoleum;
perhaps some great king lies there. No one will be afraid if we all
go in a body with guns."</p>

<p>So the weary slaves were whipped into wakefulness and stumbled
along beneath the whips again. The black warriors went silently and
nervously, reluctantly obeying Hassim's implacable will but
huddling close to the Arabs. The moon had risen, huge, red and
sullen, and the jungle was bathed in a sinister silver glow that
etched the brooding trees in black shadow. The trembling Ali
pointed out the way, somewhat reassured by his savage master's
presence.</p>

<p>And so they passed through the jungle until they came to a
strange clearing among the giant trees&mdash;strange because
nothing grew there. The trees ringed it in a disquieting
symmetrical manner, and no lichen or moss grew on the earth, which
seemed to have been blasted and blighted in a strange fashion. And
in the midst of the glade stood the mausoleum.</p>

<p>A great brooding mass of stone it was, pregnant with ancient
evil. Dead with the dead of a hundred centuries it seemed, yet Kane
was aware that the air pulsed about it, as with the slow, unhuman
breathing of some gigantic, invisible monster.</p>

<p><br>
THE black Moslems drew back muttering, assailed by the
evil atmosphere of the place; the slaves stood in a patient, silent
group beneath the trees. The Arabs went forward to the frowning
black mass, and Yussef, taking Kane's cord from his guard, led the
Englishman with him like a surly mastiff, as if for protection
against the unknown.</p>

<p>"Some mighty sultan doubtless lies here," said Hassim, tapping
the stone with his scabbard.</p>

<p>"Whence come these stones?" muttered Yussef uneasily. "They are
of dark and forbidding aspect. Why should a great sultan lie in
state so far from any habitation of man? If there were ruins of an
old city hereabouts it would be different&mdash;"</p>

<p>He bent to examine the heavy metal door with its huge lock,
curiously sealed and fused. He shook his head forebodingly as he
made out the ancient Hebraic characters carved on the door.</p>

<p>"I can not read them," he quavered, "and belike it is well for
me I can not. What ancient kings sealed up is not good for men to
disturb. Hassim, let us hence. This place is pregnant with evil for
the sons of men."</p>

<p>But Hassim gave him no heed. "He who lies within is no son of
Islam," said he, "and why should we not despoil him of the gems and
riches that undoubtedly were laid to rest with him? Let us break
open this door."</p>

<p>Some of the Arabs shook their heads doubtfully but Hassim's word
was law. Calling to him a huge black who bore a heavy hammer, he
ordered him to break open the door.</p>

<p>As the black swung up his sledge, Kane gave a sharp exclamation.
Was he mad? The apparent antiquity of this brooding mass of stone
was proof that it had stood undisturbed for thousands of years. Yet
he could have sworn that he heard the sounds of footfalls within!
Back and forth they padded, as if something paced the narrow
confines of that grisly prison in a never-ending monotony of
movement.</p>

<p>A cold hand touched the spine of Solomon Kane. Whether the
sounds registered on his conscious ear or on some unsounded deep of
soul or sub-feeling, he could not tell, but he knew that somewhere
within his consciousness there reechoed the tramp of monstrous feet
from within that ghastly mausoleum.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he exclaimed. "Hassim, I may be mad, but I hear the
tread of some fiend within that pile of stone."</p>

<p>Hassim raised his hand and checked the hovering hammer. He
listened intently, and the others strained their ears in a silence
that had suddenly become tense.</p>

<p>"I hear nothing," grunted a bearded giant.</p>

<p>"Nor I." came a quick chorus. "The Frank is mad!"</p>

<p>"Hear ye anything, Yussef?" asked Hassim sardonically.</p>

<p>The old Hadji shifted nervously. His face was uneasy.</p>

<p>"No. Hassim, no, yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kane decided he must be mad. Yet in his heart he knew he was
never saner, and he knew somehow that this occult keenness of the
deeper senses that set him apart from the Arabs came from long
association with the ju-ju stave that old Yussef now held in his
shaking hands.</p>

<p>Hassim laughed harshly and made a gesture to the black. The
hammer fell with a crash that re-echoed deafeningly and shivered
off through the black jungle in a strangely altered cachinnation.
Again&mdash;again&mdash;and again the hammer fell, driven with all
the power of rippling muscles and mighty body. And between the
blows Kane still heard that lumbering tread, and he who had never
known fear as men know it, felt the cold hand of terror clutching
at his heart.</p>

<p>This fear was apart from earthly or mortal fear, as the sound of
the footfalls was apart from mortal tread. Kane's fright was like a
cold wind blowing on him from outer realms of unguessed Darkness,
bearing him the evil and decay of an outlived epoch and an
unutterably ancient period. Kane was not sure whether he heard
those footfalls or by some dim instinct sensed them. But he was
sure of their reality. They were not the tramp of man or beast; but
inside that black, hideously ancient mausoleum some nameless thing
moved with floor-shaking and elephantine tread.</p>

<p>The great black sweated and panted with the difficulty of
his task. But at last, beneath the heavy blows the ancient lock
shattered; the hinges snapped; the door burst inward. And Yussef
screamed.</p>

<p>From that black gaping entrance no tiger-fanged beast or demon
of solid flesh and blood leaped forth. But a fearful stench flowed
out in billowing, almost tangible waves and in one
brain-shattering, ravening rush, whereby the gaping door seemed to
gush blood, the Horror was upon them. It enveloped Hassim, and the
fearless chieftain, hewing vainly at the almost intangible terror,
screamed with sudden, unaccustomed fright as his lashing scimitar
whistled only through stuff as yielding and unharmable as air, and
he felt himself lapped by coils of death and destruction.</p>

<p>Yussef shrieked like a lost soul, dropped the ju-ju stave and
joined his fellows who streamed out into the jungle in mad flight,
preceded by the howling black warriors. Only the black slaves fled
not, but stood shackled to their doom, wailing their terror. As in a
nightmare of delirium Kane saw Hassim swaying like a reed in the
wind, lapped about by a gigantic pulsing red Thing that had neither
shape nor earthly substance. Then, as the crack of splintering
bones came to him, and the sheikh's body buckled like a straw
beneath a stamping hoof, the Englishman burst his bonds with one
volcanic effort and caught up the ju-ju stave.</p>

<p>Hassim was down, crushed and dead, sprawled like a broken toy
with shattered limbs awry, and the red pulsing Thing was lurching
toward Kane like a thick cloud of blood in the air, that
continually changed its shape and form, and yet somehow trod
lumberingly as if on monstrous legs!</p>

<p>Kane felt the cold fingers of fear claw at his brain, but he
braced himself, and lifting the ancient staff, struck with all his
power into the centre of the Horror. And he felt an unnameable,
immaterial substance meet and give way before the falling staff.
Then he was almost strangled by the nauseous burst of unholy stench
that flooded the air, and somewhere down the dim vistas of his
soul's consciousness re-echoed unbearably a hideous formless
cataclysm that he knew was the death-screaming of the monster. For
it was down and dying at his feet, its crimson paling in slow
surges like the rise and receding of red waves on some foul coast.
And as it paled, the soundless screaming dwindled away into cosmic
distances as though it faded into some sphere apart and aloof
beyond human ken.</p>

<p>Kane, dazed and incredulous, looked down on a shapeless,
colourless, all but invisible mass at his feet which he knew was
the corpse of the Horror, dashed back into the black realms from
whence it had come, by a single blow of the staff of Solomon. Aye,
the same staff, Kane knew, that in the hands of a mighty King and
magician had ages ago driven the monster into that strange prison,
to bide until ignorant hands loosed it again upon the world.</p>

<p>The old tales were true then, and King Solomon had in truth
driven the demons westward and sealed them in strange places. Why
had he let them live? Was human magic too weak in those dim days to
more than subdue the devils? Kane shrugged his shoulders in
wonderment. He knew nothing of magic, yet he had slain where that
other Solomon had but imprisoned.</p>

<p>And Solomon Kane shuddered, for he had looked on Life that was
not Life as he knew it, and had dealt and witnessed Death that was
not Death as he knew it. Again the realization swept over
him&mdash;as it had in the dust-haunted halls of Atlantean Negari,
as it had in the abhorrent Hills of the Dead, as it had in
Akaana&mdash;that human life was but one of a myriad forms of
existence, that worlds existed within worlds, and that there was
more than one plane of existence. The planet men call the earth
spun on through the untold ages, Kane realized, and as it spun it
spawned Life, and living things which wriggled about it as maggots
are spawned in rot and corruption. Man was the dominant maggot now;
why should he in his pride suppose that he and his adjuncts were
the first maggots&mdash;or the last to rule a planet quick with
unguessed life.</p>

<p>He shook his head, gazing in new wonder at the ancient gift of
N'Longa, seeing in it at last not merely a tool of black magic, but
a sword of good and light against the powers of inhuman evil
forever. And he was shaken with a strange reverence for it that was
almost fear.</p>

<p>Then he bent to the Thing at his feet, shuddering to feel its
strange mass slip through his fingers like wisps of heavy fog. He
thrust the staff beneath it and somehow lifted and levered the mass
back into the mausoleum and shut the door.</p>

<p>Then he stood gazing down at the strangely mutilated body of
Hassim, noting how it was smeared with foul slime and how it had
already begun to decompose. He shuddered again, and suddenly a low
timid voice aroused him from his sombre cogitations. The captives
knelt beneath the trees and watched with great patient eyes. With a
start he shook off his strange mood. He took from the mouldering
corpse his own pistols, dirk and rapier, making shift to wipe off
the clinging foulness that was already flecking the steel with
rust. He also took up a quantity of powder and shot dropped by the
Arabs in their frantic flight. He knew they would return no more.
They might die in their flight, or they might gain through the
interminable leagues of jungle to the coast; but they would not
turn back to dare the terror of that grisly glade.</p>

<p>Kane came to the black slaves and after some difficulty
released them.</p>

<p>"Take up these weapons which the warriors dropped in their
haste," said he, "and get you home. This is an evil place. Get ye
back to your villages and when the next Arabs come, die in the
ruins of your huts rather than be slaves."</p>

<p>Then they would have knelt and kissed his feet but he, in much
confusion, forbade them roughly. Then as they made preparations to
go, one said to him: "Master, what of thee? Wilt thou not return
with us? Thou shalt be our king!"</p>

<p>But Kane shook his head.</p>

<p>"I go eastward," said he. And so the tribespeople bowed to him
and turned back on the long trail to their own homeland. And Kane
shouldered the staff that had been the rod of the Pharaohs and of
Moses and of Solomon and of nameless Atlantean kings behind them,
and turned his face eastward, halting only for a single backward
glance at the great mausoleum that other Solomon had built with
strange arts so long ago, and which now loomed dark and forever
silent against the stars.</p>
