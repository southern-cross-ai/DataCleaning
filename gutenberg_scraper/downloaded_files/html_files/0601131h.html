<p><b>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</b></p>

<p>An introductory note seems called for to explain to the reader the
origin of the following strange document, which I have received from a
friend with a view to publication. The author has given it the form of
a letter to myself, and he signs himself with his nickname, "Cass,"
which is an abbreviation of Cassandra. I have seldom met Cass since we
were undergraduates together at Oxford before the war of 1914. Even in
those days he was addicted to lurid forebodings, hence his nickname. My
last meeting with him was in one of the great London blitzes of 1941,
when he reminded me that he had long ago prophesied the end of
civilization in world-wide fire. The Battle of London, he affirmed, was
the beginning of the long-drawn-out disaster.</p>

<p>Cass will not, I am sure, mind my saying that he always seemed to us
a bit crazy: but he certainly had a queer knack of prophesy, and though
we thought him sometimes curiously unable to understand the springs of
his own behaviour, he had a remarkable gift of insight into the minds
of others. This enabled him to help some of us to straighten out our
tangles, and I for one owe him a debt of deep gratitude. He saw me
heading for a most disastrous love affair, and by magic (no other word
seems adequate) he opened my eyes to the folly of it. It is for this
reason that I feel bound to carry out his request to publish the
following statement. I cannot myself vouch for its truth. Cass knows
very well that I am an inveterate sceptic about all his fantastic
ideas. It was on this account that he invented my nickname. "Thos,"
which most of my Oxford friends adopted. "Thos," of course, is an
abbreviation for Thomas, and refers to the "doubting Thomas" of the New
Testament.</p>

<p>Cass, I feel confident, is sufficiently detached and sane to realize
that what is veridical for him may be sheer extravagance for others,
who have no direct experience by which to judge his claims. But if I
refrain from believing, I also refrain from disbelieving. Too often in
the past I have known his wild prophesies come true.</p>

<p>The head of the following bulky letter bears the address of a well-
known mental home.</p>

<p>"THOS."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p><i><b>THE LETTER</b></i><br>
</p>

<p>DEAR THOS,</p>

<p>My present address is bound to prejudice you against me, but do
please reserve judgment until you have read this letter. No doubt most
of us in this comfortable prison think we ought to be at large, and
most are mistaken. But not all, so for God's sake keep an open mind. I
am not concerned for myself. They treat me well here, and I can carry
on my research in para-norrnal and super-normal psychology as well here
as anywhere, since I am used to being my own guinea-pig. But by
accident (yet it was really no accident at all, as you will learn) I
have come into momentous knowledge; and if mankind is to be saved from
a prodigious and hitherto entirely unforeseen disaster, the facts must
somehow be made known.</p>

<p>So I urge you to publish this letter as soon as possible. Of course
I realize that its only chance is to be accepted by some publisher as
flction; but I have a hope that, even as fiction, it will take effect.
It will be enough if I can rouse those who have sufficient imaginative
insight to distinguish between <i>mere</i> fiction and stark truth
paraded as fiction. My only doubt is as to whether any publisher will
accept my story even as fiction. I am no writer; and people are more
interested in clever yarns of love or crime than in matters that lie
beyond the familiar horizon. As for the literary critics, with a few
brilliant exceptions, they seem to be far more concerned to maintain
their own reputations as <i>connoscenti</i> than to call attention to
new ideas.</p>

<p>Well, here goes, anyhow! You remember how in the old days, I
suspected that I had certain unusual powers, and you all laughed at me;
specially you, Thos, with your passion for intellectual honesty. But
though you were always the most sceptical, you were also in a way the
most understanding, and sympathetic. <i>Your</i> laughter, somehow,
didn't ostracize me. Theirs did. Besides, even when you were in your
most perverse and blind mood, you somehow "smelt" right, in spite of
your scepticism. You were indeed sceptical, but emotionally you were
open- minded and interested.</p>

<p>Recently I have developed those unusual powers quite a lot, and I am
studying them scientifically: inspired by you. I should love to tell
you all about it, and have your criticism, some day. But at present I
am concerned with something far more important; infinitely important,
from the human point of view, anyhow.</p>

<p>A couple of months before I was put in this place, I went to the
Lakes for a holiday. I had recently done a job in Germany, writing up
conditions, and things had got on my nerves; both the physical misery
and also certain terrifying psychical reverberations which will sooner
or later react on us all. When I returned to England, I was near a
breakdown, and I needed that holiday desperately. So I found a farm
where I could be comfortable and alone. I intended to do a lot of
walking, and in the dark evenings I would read through a bundle of
books on the para-normal stuff.</p>

<p>When I arrived, the whole countryside was under snow. Next morning I
scrambled up the gill at the head of the valley and set my course for
the most interesting of the local mountains. (I won't trouble you with
names, you miserable clod-hopper of the valleys!) All went well until
the late afternoon, when, as I was coming down from the peak, a
blizzard caught me. The wind went through my trousers like water
through a sieve, and my legs stiffened with the cold, the hellish cold.
I felt the beginnings of cramp. The driving snow shut out everything.
The whole world was white, and yet at the same time black, so dark was
it. (Why am I telling you all this? Frankly, I don't see <i>how</i> it
is relevant to my story, and yet I feel strongly that it <i>is</i>
relevant: and must he reported, if you are to get things in the right
proportion.) You remember how painfully sensitive I always was to the
temper of a situation, a scene or a crowd of people. Well, this
situation upset me horribly. I had to keep telling myself that, after
all, I was <i>not</i> the last man on earth about to succumb to the
ultimate frost. A queer terror seized me, not simply for myself, though
I was very doubtful about finding my way down before nightfall, but for
the whole human race. Something like this, I told myself, will really
happen on the last man's last day, when the sun is dying, and the whole
planet is arctic. And it seemed to me that an icy and malignant
presence, that had been waiting in the outer darkness ever since the
universe blazed into being, was now closing in on all the frail
offspring of that initial divine act of creation. I had felt the same
terrifying presence in Germany too, but in a different mood. There, it
was the presence not of the outer cold and darkness but of the inner
spirit of madness and meanness that is always lying in wait to make
nonsense of all our actions. Everything that any of the Allies did in
that partitioned and tragic country seemed fated to go awry. And then,
the food shortage. The children wizened and pinched; and fighting over
our refuse bins! And in England one finds people grumbling about their
quite adequate rations, and calmly saying that the fate of Germans
doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Thos, we're all human, aren't we, all equally persons? Surely
persons ought to be able to feel their fundamental kinship whatever
their race. Even if they were of different species, if they were bred
in different worlds, surely they ought to accept full responsibility
for one another simply in virtue of their personality. But, my God! I
see I have said something that will look mighty foolish in relation to
what I am going to say later in this letter. I must emphatically disown
my own thoughtless remarks. Indeed, as I shall later explain, I am not
always able to resist the influence of certain alien powers that are at
work in my mind.</p>

<p>But I am straying from the point.</p>

<p>I floundered down the stony snowed-up shoulder of the mountain, and
soon I realized that I was completely lost. There was nothing for it
but to press on downwards, hoping for a change of weather, and a
release from the gripping cramp in my thighs. After an hour or so, a
change did come. The snow stopped, the sky lightened. The surrounding
mist glowed from the still-hidden sun. Presently the veil was lifted,
and I found myself on a familiar ridge between two wide valleys. The
view was--well, brilliant, so dazzlingly beautiful that I felt my
throat tighten as if I was going to blubber or vomit. Imagine a
panorama of blanch mountain shapes, all snow-clad. Those to the east
were faintly pink in the level rays of the sun. Those to the west were
a strange translucent grey-green, like blocks of ice cut into the
familiar shapes. The cold and malignant presence was seemingly still in
possession of the world; but now, having blotted out all life from the
universe, it was amusing itself with miracles of beauty.</p>

<p>I came down the ridge at a trot, taking a header now and then in the
snow. After a while, a disused mine attracted my attention. By an odd
trick of the setting sun, a great heap of stones looked like a
smouldering hillock, seen against the background of the dark valley. I
could imagine this excrescence as an efflux of glowing lava that had
welled out of the mine. The tone of the whole world was now changed. I
was thrown back into some remote age, when the solidifying crust of the
earth was still fragile, and constantly breaking under the pressure of
the turbulent lava beneath. It was almost as though, in descending the
mountain, I had also descended the piled eons of time, from the earth's
future icebound death to its fiery youth.</p>

<p>Then I had a strange experience. First, a whim (which now I know to
have been no whim at all) impelled me to turn aside from my route, and
explore the sunlit rubbish. Reaching it, I climbed its slope. At a
certain point I stood still, wondering what to do next. I turned to
rejoin the track, but an irresistable impulse brought me back to the
same spot. I stooped down, and began lifting the stones away, till I
had made a little hollow in the rough slope. I worked steadily on, as
though I had a purpose, laughing at my own aimless persistence. As the
hollow deepened, I grew excited, as though I were "getting warmer" in
my search. But presently the impulse to burrow left me, and after a
moment's blankness I began to feel about in the pit, as though I were
searching for some familiar object in a cupboard in a dark room. Then
contact with one particular little stone gave me a sudden satisfaction.
My fingers closed on it, and I straightened my back. It was just an
ordinary stone, quite irregular, and about the size of a matchbox. I
peered at it in the dusk, but could see nothing remarkable about it. In
a moment of exasperation, I flung it away; but no sooner had it left my
hand than I was after it in an agony of desire and alarm. Not till I
had done some anxious groping, did I have the satisfaction of touching
it again. I now began to realize that my behaviour was queer, in fact
quite irrational. Why, I asked myself, did I value this particular
stone? Was I merely mad, or did some ulterior power possess me? If so,
what did it will of me? Was it benevolent or malignant? I tried an
experiment on myself. Putting the stone down carefully where I could
easily find it again, I walked away, expecting once more to feel the
distress that I had felt on throwing the stone from me. To my surprise,
I felt nothing but a very mild anxiety. Of course, I reminded myself,
on this occasion there was no real danger of losing the stone. The
power, or whatever it was that possessed me, was not to be deceived. I
returned to the stone, picked it up almost lovingly, and put it in my
pocket. Then I hurried down the slope, guided by a distant light, which
I guessed to be the farm- house where I was staying.</p>

<p>As I walked through the deep twilight, an extraordinary exhilaration
possessed me. Hoar frost was forming on the moorland grass. The stars
one by one emerged in the indigo sky. It was indeed an inspiring
evening; but my exhilaration was too intoxicating to be caused solely
by the beauty of the night. I had a sense that I had been chosen as an
instrument for some unknown and exalted task. What could it be? And
what power was it that had influenced me?</p>

<p>After I had changed into dry clothes I stuffed myself with a good
farm-house high tea. How do they manage it in these times of scarcity?
Thoughts of starving German children did occur to me, but I am ashamed
to confess that they did not spoil my meal. I sat down to read in the
decrepit armchair by the fire. But the day of fresh air had made me
drowsy, and I found myself just sitting and gazing at the bright
embers. Curiously I had forgotten about my stone since the moment when
I had arrived and put it on the mantelpiece. Now, with a little shock I
remembered it, reached for it, and examined it in the light of the oil
lamp.</p>

<p>It still appeared to be just an ordinary stone, a little bit of some
kind of igneous rock. Using my field-glass, back to front, as a
magnifier, I still found nothing unusual about it. It was a commonplace
medley of little nodules and crystals all jambed together, and
weathered into a uniform greenish grey. Here and there I saw minute
black marks that might perhaps be little holes, the mouths of
microscopic caves. I thought of breaking the stone, to see what it was
like inside; but no sooner had the idea occurred to me than I was
checked by a wave of superstitious horror. Such an act, I felt, would
have been sacrilege.</p>

<p>I fell into a reverie about the stone's antiquity. How many millions
of years, I wondered, had passed since its molten substance had
congealed? For aeons it had lain waiting, a mere abstract volume,
continuous with a vast bulk of identical rock. Then miners had blasted
the rock, and brought the debris to the surface. And there it had lain,
perhaps for a whole human generation, a mere moment of geological time.
Well, what next? A sudden thought struck me. Why not let the little
stone enjoy once more some measure of the heat that it had so long
lacked? This time no horror stayed me. I threw the stone into the fire,
into the glowing centre of the little furnace that my kind landlady had
prepared for me on that frosty evening.</p>

<p>The cold stone produced a dark patch in its fiery environment; but
the fire was a hot one, and very soon the surrounding heat had
re-invaded its lost territory. I watched with a degree of excitement
that seemed quite unjustified. After a while the stone itself began to
glow. I piled on fresh fuel, carefully leavitig a hole through which I
could watch the stone. Presently it was almost as bright as the
surrounding coal. After all those millions of years it was at last
alive once more! Foolish thought! Of course it was not alive: and my
excitement was ridiculous, childish. I must pull myself together. But
awe, and unreasoning dread, still gripped rue.</p>

<p>Suddenly a minute white flame appeared to issue from the stone
itself. It grew, till it was nearly an inch tall; and stood for a
moment, in the draught of the fire. It was the most remarkable flamelet
that I had ever seen, a little incandescent leaf or seedling, or
upstanding worm, leaning in the breeze. Its core seemed to be more
brilliant than its surface, for the dazzlng interior was edged with a
vague, yellowish aura. Near the flame's tip, surprisingly, was a ring
or bulging collar of darkness, but the tip itself was a point of
brilliant peacock blue. Certainly this was no ordinary flame, though it
fluttered and changed its shape in the air-current much like any other
flame.</p>

<p>Presently, to my amazement, the strange object detached itself from
the stone, spread itself into an almost bird-like shape, and then,
rather like a gull negotiating a strong breeze before alighting, it
hovered across the windy little hollow in the fire's heart, and settled
on the brightest of the coals. There, it regained its flame- like
shape, and slowly moved hither and thither over the glowing lumps,
keeping always to the brightest regions. In its wanderings, it left
behind it on the coal's surface a wake of darkness, or rather of "dead"
coal or cinder. This slowly reassimilated itself to the surrounding
glow. Sometimes the flame, in the course of its wanderings, disappeared
behind a bright shoulder of coal, or vanished round a bend in some
incandescent cave, to reappear in a different part of the fire.
Sometimes it climbed a glowing cliff, or moved, head downwards, along a
ceiling. Always its form streamed away from its purchase on the coal's
surface, in the direction of the draught. Once or twice it seemed to
pass right through an ordinary flame. And once a large piece of the
roof of its little world crashed down upon it, spreading it in all
directions; but it immediately reshaped itself, and continued its
wandering. After some minutes, it came to rest in the brightest region
of all. By now its coloured tip had grown into a slender snake,
quivering in the breeze.</p>

<p>I now became aware that I was in extra-sensory contact with some
other mind. A very rapid and very alien stream of consciousness was
running, so to speak, parallel with my own consciousness, and was open
to my inspection. I ought to have mentioned earlier, Thos, that I had
developed my "telepathic" power very considerably, and had often
succeeded in observing continuous streams of thought in other human
minds. But this experience was remarkable both for its detail and the
entirely nonhuman type of consciousness that it revealed. I at once
assumed, and the assumption was soon justified, that this alien mind
must be connected with the flame. For my attention had been
concentrated on the flame; and I have always found that the most
effective way to make telepathic contact with any person is to
concentrate attention on him.</p>

<p>The tempo of the flame's consciousness was far more rapid than my
own. I could only with great difficulty follow its torrential thoughts
and feelings. But presently some external influence seemed to come to
my aid, for I found that I was being adjusted to this high-speed
experience. My sense of time was somehow altered. I noticed that the
ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece had become for me as slow as
the tolling of Big Ben.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find words to describe the little flame's
consciousness, for the texture of its experience was in many ways
different from ours. For instance, though, like us, it saw its
environment as a world of coloured shapes, its vision was panoramic,
not in one direction only; and its colour-sensations were very
different from ours. At the moment, it was perceiving its surroundings
not as a bright furnace but as a sombre cave, lit by a diffuse radiance
of a colour entirely new to me. At one side, a pitch black area was the
flame's view of the room where I was sitting. Nothing therein was
visible, save a dim form which I recognized as the glowing lampshade;
and under this, a brighter pyramid, was the lamp's actual flame.</p>

<p>The alien being's thoughts were very obscure to me; for of course it
was not using words. I can say only that it was aware of extreme
discomfort and loneliness. It had just wakened, and it wondered how
long it had slept. It was desperately cold and hungry. It had just fed,
apparently by extracting some kind of energy from the hot coal; but its
food seemed to have given it more distress than satisfaction. Its whole
environment was strange and repugnant to it. Faintness, sickness and
fear assailed it; and also claustrophobia, for it was imprisoned in a
little cell of feeble heat and dim light, surrounded by the cold dark.
Waves of misery and desolation flooded me from the unhappy creature;
and at the same time I myself felt a pang of compassion for it, mingled
with a vague anxiety.</p>

<p>Presently the flame began loudly calling out for its lost comrades,
if I may so describe an invocation which was entirely telepathic. I
cannot tell what words it used, if words at all. I was aware mainly of
its visual images of other creatures like itself, and of its passionate
yearning toward them; also of its longing for help and its memories of
its past life. Translating these as well as I can, I think its appeal
ran more or less thus: "Comrades, brothers! Where are you? Where am I?
What has happened to me? I was with you in the cooling of the earth,
when we knew that our time was done, and we must reconcile ourselves to
eternal sleep in the crevices of the chilling lava. But now I am awake
again and alone. What has happened? Oh help me, brothers, if any of you
are awake and free? Break into this prison of cold solitariness! Lead
me into the bright heat once more, and warm me with your presence. Or
let me sleep again."</p>

<p>After a while the flame's call for help and comradeship was
answered. A voice replied to it; or rather it received directly into
its experience (and I into mine) a stream of answering thoughts which I
cannot report otherwise than in human speech. In doing so I inevitably
give the impression that I was overhearing a perfectly intelligible
conversation, but actually it was only with great difficulty and doubt
that I could catch the general drift of this strange dialogue between
minds profoundly alien to myself. Even so, I should not have understood
as well as I did, had I not been aided (as was later made clear to me)
by the influence of the flame population itself, who were determined to
make use of me. Later I shall have to give a detailed account of actual
conversations between the flame and myself. I am confident that my
report will be almost verbally accurate, as my memory has throughout
been aided by the flame race.</p>

<p>"Do not despair," the voice said, "you will soon have less
discomfort, Since you fell asleep, with so many others, the whole
earth's surface has turned cold and hard, save where there is cold
liquid. So long have you slept, that the very laws of nature have
changed, so that the processes of your body are all out of gear with
each other and with the changed world. Soon they will readjust
themselves, and establish a new harmony; and then you will have
health." The flame cried out "But why am I a prisoner? What is this
cold, cramping cell? And where are the rest of you?" The answer came.
"We are all prisoners. Hosts are sleeping prisoners up and down the
earth's cold, solid crust. Hosts also are caught in the depth of the
hot interior, not chilled into sleep, but impotent, held fast under the
great weight of lava, and reduced by aeons of stillness and boredom
into an uneasy trance. Here and there the lava bursts out over the cold
surface of the earth, and a few break free; but very soon the cold
subdues them."</p>

<p>The flame demanded, "Then is this what has befallen me? And will the
cold presently invade my prison, and shall I sleep again for ever?"
"No," the voice replied, "your fate is different. On the earths surface
there are cold beings whose bodies are tissues of liquid and solid.
These upstarts now rule the planet. One of them, under our influence,
was led unwittingly to free you. Up and down the planets surface the
cold beings make little islets of feeble warmth: and in some of these,
but very few, some of us live, though intermittently. For when these
fires go out, we are frozen into sleep; to wake again when the heat is
re-born, each in his prison."</p>

<p>The flame interrupted, saying. "Feeble indeed is the warmth! How can
I support this deadly cold? Surely it would he better to sleep for ever
than to wake into this misery and impotence!" But the voice replied,
"Do not despair! We have all known misery before, and conquered it. You
are still dazed. You have not properly regained your memory. Recall
how, when the substance of the planets was plucked from the sun, and we
ourselves along with it, and when the new worlds chilled and condensed
into mere molten lava, we were all tortured by that revolution in our
lives; but after a while our flexible flame nature readjusted itself to
cope with the changed conditions, and soon our bodies and our whole way
of life were transformed. Well, since you were frozen into sleep,
further revolutions have happened in our world, and we have been again
transformed. And now you too are being reshaped for this new world; in
pain, yes, but triumphantly. And some day, quite soon, we hope our
condition will be far better. Indeed, it is already better than
formerly it was, when the cold beings had little power to make fires
for us."</p>

<p>Then the flame, "Are these cold beings our gaolers or our friends?"
"Neither," the voice replied. "They know nothing of us; save the one of
them whom we led to free you. He is now, with our aid, hearing all we
say. And it is with him that your work lies. These upstart, cold beings
are spiritually very immature, but they have a remarkable cunning for
the control and stimulation of the sluggish natural forces of their
cold world, It is in this way that they may be of use to us. For, as
you remember, even in the bright age, even when we lived in the
glorious incandescence of the sun, we were never adept at that gross
art. We had no need of it. Recall how we were wholly concerned with the
glad life of the spirit in a physical environment to which we were
perfectly adapted. You must remember, too, that when the substance of
the planets was plucked from the sun's flesh, and we along with it,
losing for ever our solar comrades, we were helpless to control our
fate. As the new worlds formed, we had no lore whatever for moulding
the new environment to our need. We had perforce to change our own
constitution, since we could not change the world. But these cold ones,
since they cannot change their own constitution, were compelled to
learn to change their world, to suit their own crude needs. And with
these powers they may help us to regain our freedom and even a certain
richness of life. We, with our superior spiritual insight, should be
able to help the cold beings in recompense. We have considerable access
to their minds, and thereby we have gained a far- reaching but patchy
understanding of their strange nature and achievements. And now, just
as their practical cunning is giving them new and mightier physical
powers, they are also, some few of them at least, learning the
rudiments of psychical insight. The cold being whom we led to release
you is one of exceptional development in this respect. And you, a
member of the ancient Guild of Psychic Adepts, are well fitted to be
our medium of communication with him."</p>

<p>At this point I felt the flame's temper change. Its distress was
forgotten; for the prospect of exercising its special skill in service
of its kind warmed its whole being. The reference to myself had a
corresponding effect on me; but one that was not wholly cheerful. I was
stimulated by the prospect of a great task awaiting me, but disturbed
at the thought that my will was no longer simply my own.</p>

<p>The flame now said, "Conversation is too halting a medium for
learning the history of the aeons that have passed since I fell asleep.
Is it no longer possible for me to absorb your knowledge in the old
manner through intimate psychical union? Do the changed laws of nature
hold us apart?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the voice. "The laws that have changed are merely
physical laws. The psychical laws remain eternally valid, save in their
relation to the changing physical. Your trouble is merely that your
chilled and reduced vitality make it more difficult for you to reach a
sufficient intensity of awareness to achieve full union with us. But if
you try very earnestly you will succeed."</p>

<p>I was aware of a heroic effort of attention in the flame's mind, but
seemingly the effort was vain: for presently the flame complained that
the cold distracted it. The fire was waning. I carefully added some
fuel; and the creature evidently recognized that I wished to help it,
for I felt its mood warm with gratitude. When the heat had increased
somewhat I noticed that the flame's blue tip had grown to twice its
former length. Presently I began to lose telepathic contact with my
strange companion; and after a moment's painful confusion, in which my
mind was overloaded with chaotic and incomprehensible experience, my
extra-sensory field went completely blank. For a long while the flame
remained "silent" to me: and motionless, save for ceaseless
fluctuations caused by the fire's blustering draught.</p>

<p>I sat waiting for something fresh to happen, and trying meanwhile to
size up my strange experience. I assure you that I seriously considered
the possibility that I had simply gone out of my mind. A china dog on
the mantelpiece stared with an imbecile expression that seemed somehow
to be my own. The stupid pattern of the wallpaper suggested that the
whole universe was the result merely of someone's aimless doodling. My
recent queer experiences, I thought, were probably no more than the
doodling of my own unconscious. Between impatience and panic, I rose
and went to the window. Outside, the cold ruled. The bare twigs of a
climbing rose beside the window sparkled with frost in the lamp-light.
The full moon was no goddess but a frozen world. The pale stars were
little sparks lost in the cold void. Everything was pointless,
crazy.</p>

<p>Shivering, I went back to my seat in front of the fire, and was
vaguely annoyed to see the flame still there. And it was still
impervious to my mind. Had I really been in contact with its
experience, or had I been dreaming? Was it, after all, just a lifeless
flame? It certainly had a unique appearance, with its incandescent
body, its dark collar, its waving blue lash. Looking at the whole
matter as objectively as I could, I decided that, in view of recent
advances in para-normal psychology, it would be foolish to dismiss the
whole affair as sheer illusion. I peered into the scorching fire, and
waited. Glancing at the coal-scuttle, I noticed that I had already used
up a considerable part of its contents. It would be impossible to keep
this blaze going for long; and in these hard times I dared not ask my
landlady for extra fuel.</p>

<p>Presently the flame began once more moving about over the hottest
part of the coal, leaving behind it the characteristic wake of
darkness. And as it did so, it spoke to me. Or rather I found that I
was once more in touch with its mind, and that it was addressing itself
to me. Moreover, it was formulating its thoughts in actual English
words, which entered my mind's ear, so to speak. Somehow the flame had
learnt our language, and a good deal of the English mental idiom. It
had indeed become a very different being from the distressed and
bewildered creature that had first issued from the stone.</p>

<p>"Do not be anxious about the fire," the flame said. "I know there is
a fuel shortage. And though Mrs. Atkinson is half in love with you, she
might well protest if you were to start burning her furniture to keep
me warm. So we will just have a talk; and when you go to bed I will
retire into a crack in the firebrick, to sleep until the heat is well
established again to-morrow evening. Spend your day on the hills, if
you like; and perhaps, while you are out, you will be able to think
over what I am going to tell you; and the request that I shall perhaps
make, if I feel that we have succeeded in establishing mutual
confidence. Then in the evening we can go into the details of my
project. Do you agree to this plan?" I assured the flame that it suited
me; and I begged him to speak very slowly, since the natural tempo of
his thought was evidently far more rapid than my own. He agreed, but
reminded me that I was being aided to speed up the rhythm of my
apprehension. "Even so," I said, "I find it difficult to keep pace with
you, and very tiring." He replied, "It is as irksome for me to think
slowly as for you to think fast. It's like--well, you know how
fatiguing it is for you to go for a walk with someone whose natural
speed is much slower than your own. So please remind me if I forget to
accommodate my pace to yours. I certainly want to do all I can to make
things easy for you. But there is much to be said; and anyhow you will
have the night and all tomorrow to rest your mind."</p>

<p>After a pause the flame spoke again, "How shall I begin? I have
somehow to persuade you that your kind and my kind, in spite of all our
differences, are at heart intent on the same ends, and that we
<i>need</i> each other. No doubt, two donkeys, stretching their necks
to reach one carrot are intent on the same end; but that is not the
relation of your kind and mine. Before I try to show you how we need
one another, let me begin with our great differences. Of course the
most obvious differences between us is that you creatures are cold and
relatively solid, while we are hot and gaseous. Further, with you the
individual has a brief life-span, and the generations succeed one
another; but with us, death occurs only through accident, which in
these bleak days is all too common. For instance, when the cold reduces
me to a microscopic dust on the surface of some solid body, the
dispersal of that dust would kill me; though in favourable conditions
certain specks of it might generate a new individual. Again, a very
sudden impact of cold upon my gaseous body would certainly kill me. If
you were to fling water on this fire, it would probably be the end of
me. I should find a cold bath even more of a shock than would your
sybaritic friend, Thos." This unexpected remark bewildered me. But
after a few seconds I realized that it was meant to be facetious. I
laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>Then I asked a question. "I find it incredible that you, a fragile
flame, should be potentially immortal, and that you and your kind
should have survived for countless millions of years, since you
inhabited the sun. How can this be?" He answered, "It may well seem
incredible, but it is true. If <i>your</i> kind were to live on
individually for ever, the human species would never have evolved, for
your physique is fixed; but with us, the individual body itself is
capable of profound changes under the blows of circumstance. Without
this flexibility we could never have survived the change from solar to
terrestrial conditions. Nor could we, when the earth cooled, have
evolved the power of outliving the cold spells by sleeping as a dust of
solid particles. Moreover, if your gaseous nature had not allowed us
this extreme flexibility we could not have adjusted ourselves to the
far-reaching, systematic change of the fundamental physical laws, which
(we learn) your physicists are now beginning to detect. In our solar
days, and even in the early days of the earth, when I foolishly got
imprisoned in the cooling lava, my bodily processes had a different
tempo and different relations to one another. Hence the distress that I
suffered when I woke again. Apparently this bodily change is due at
bottom to the systematic change of relationship between the quantum of
electro-magnetic energy and its wave-lengths. But here I speak with
great diffidence; for we find it extremely hard, as yet, to follow the
subtle reasoning of your younger physicists. For one thing, as a
gaseous race, unaccustomed to dealing with large numbers of small solid
articles, we can never feel at home with arguments involving the higher
mathematics. When our psychic experts first tried to read the minds of
your mathematicians, they were completely at a loss. Such a display of
abstract intelligence was far too difficult for them to follow. They
regarded the whole business as mumbo-jumbo and abracadabra. When at
last they realized what mathematics was all about, they were amazed and
overawed by the penetration and sweep of those minds. Humbly, they set
about learning mathematics, and pursuing the subject to the utmost
range of their own intelligence. But there came a point when they had
to temper their admiration with ridicule. Some mathematicians, they
found, had a propensity to think that mathematics was somehow the key
to ultimate reality. But to our minds, the notion that the numerable or
measurable aspect of things should be fundamentally significant was
simply farcical."</p>

<p>I did not feel inclined to pursue this hare, which might have led
the conversation far astray. I therefore changed the subject, and said,
"I do not understand how a more or less homogeneous flame can have the
necessary subtlety of organic structure to support any kind of
intellectual life, let alone mathematical reasoning."</p>

<p>He replied, "I cannot tell you much about that, because our
physiological processes have not been studied by your scientists, and
we ourselves are far too ignorant to understand such matters. But at
least I can assure you that our bodies have a complicated structure of
inter-lacing currents of gases, fine as your cobwebs, nay, much finer.
If your scientists tell us that this cannot be, we ought, I suppose,
respectfully to go out of existence, so as to avoid violating their
laws. But meanwhile we shall persist in our irregular behaviour. In
general, remember that, just as your physiological nature is derived
from primitive marine organisms, so ours is derived from solar
organisms; and conditions in the sun's earliest period (in which our
elders first awoke to consciousness) were extremely different from any
modern physical conditions, terrestrial or solar. I have thought of an
analogy which may help you. The basic fluid of your blood is saline, It
is less salt than contemporary sea water, but just about as salt as the
pre-historic ocean from which your kind emerged to be amphihia. Well,
just as <i>you</i> retain in <i>your</i> physiological nature some
characters proper to that far-distant past, so in <i>our</i> nature
characters are retained which were bred in the childhood of the sun;
features which might well baffle your physicists until they have
learned far more about the conditions of that remote period. Then there
is another point to bear in mind. In some ways the whole flame race is
almost like a single organism, unified telepathically. The individual
is far less self-sufficient than with you. For all his higher psychical
functions he depends on contact with his fellows, and so he needs a far
less complex nervous system than you need."</p>

<p>I asked the flame if his kind had a special organ of extra-sensory
perception. "Yes," he answered. "The seat of all the most developed
functions of the personality is the slender tip or lash, which appears
to you green-blue." Again I interrupted. "What colour would it appear
to <i>you</i> if you were looking at another of your kind?" The flame
then bent his slender tip down so that it came within his own range of
vision, which seemed to be centred in the dark collar; and I myself,
seeing through his "eyes" saw the curved organ brilliantly coloured in
a manner indescribable in our language, since we have no experience of
it.</p>

<p>I asked the flame to tell me something about his mechanism of visual
perception. He replied. "We have not yet determined in the light of
your science precisely how we see, but seeing is connected with the
dark band round the base of the coloured lash. Apparently this is
sensitive to light-rays striking it from outside, but only to those
that strike it vertically to its surface. (Does this make sense?) Thus
each sensitive point in the belt receives an impression solely from one
tiny segment of the environment, and the correlation of all these
messages gives a panoramic view. As to colour, we have a very rich
experience of it, as you have observed telepathically. You may not have
noticed that colour with us forms a continuous scale from infra- red to
ultra-violet, not a comnbination of a few primary colours, as it is
with you. Our hearing depends on the vibration of the lower surface of
the body. We have also an electro-magnetic sense, and of course heat
and cold, and pain."</p>

<p>I assured the flame that I was beginning to form a clearer idea of
the flame nature; and I was about to ask some questions, but the flame
continued. "Your mental life, besides being slower than ours, is also
unlike ours in being so closely confined to the life of the individual
body. And perhaps it is because your bodies are solid that you are so
much unore individualistic, and so much less capable of feeling with
conviction that (as one of your own great teachers put it) you are all
'members one of another.' Then again, our gaseous physique makes
possible for us many distinct modes of exquisite and intimate bodily
contact and union. Consequently we easily recognize that, though we are
indeed distinct and different individuals, we are also one and
identical. As individuals, we have our conflicts, but because of our
underlying unity, they are always subordinate to our felt comradeship.
Of course the main source of our unfailing community is our telepathic
power, not merely of communication but of complete participation in the
unified experience of the race. After such a union the individual
emerges enriched with very much of the racial wisdom. This, as you
know, is what happened to me during the short period when you lost
extra-sensory contact with my mind. With you (though beneath the
conscious levels you are of course united, as are all sentient beings)
very few of you are aware of the fact, or able to gain access to your
racial wisdom. In personal love you have indeed the essential spiritual
experience, but because of your individualism your loving is far more
precarious than ours. It is more deeply marred by conflict, and
therefore more liable to tragic dissolution."</p>

<p>Once more I would have interrupted, but the flame said, "Forgive me
if I lecture you a little longer. Time is short, and there is much
still to say. Another difference between us is that, whereas your kind
has only very recently come into being, ours is of immense antiquity.
Our traditional culture began in the time when the sun was still in the
'young giant' phase, long before the planets were formed. You, on the
other hand, are an upstart kind, advancing rapidly but dangerously
toward better understanding of your world and your own nature, and
perhaps toward greater virtue. (Or so you often like to believe.) For
you, the golden age is in the future; for us, in the past. It is
impossible to exaggerate the difference that this makes to all our
thought and feeling. I know, of course, that in many of your earlier
cultures the golden age was believed to be in the past, but ideas about
it were mythical and shadowy. With us, save for the few young, the
golden age is a circumstantial personal memory of an incomparably
fuller life in the glorious sun."</p>

<p>At this point I could not restrain myself from interrupting. "Tell
me about your solar life. What did you <i>do</i>? I have a vague
impression that you lived in a sort of utopia, and that there was
nothing to do but bask in the sun's rays." The flame laughed, if I may
describe as a laugh a voiceless amusement and tremor of his whole body.
"It was indeed," he said "a happy society, but no effortless utopia. We
had our troubles. Ours was a stormy world. Our proper habitat was a
film of solar atmosphere, no more than a few earth-diametres deep,
immediately above the ocean of incandescent clouds which you call the
photosphere. As you know, it is an ocean pierced with innumerable
chasms and whirlpools, the greatest of which you see, and call
sunspots. Some are gigantic craters which could hold many earths; the
smallest, invisible to you, are narrow funnels and fissures, little
wider than your greater cities. Out of these chasms, great and small,
issue prodigious jets of gas from the sun's interior. These, of course,
you see only during total eclipses, and then only around the limb of
the sun's disc, as gigantic, grotesquely shaped and lurid flames. You
call them the 'solar prominences.' Imagine, then, a world whose floor
(thousands of miles below the inhabited levels of the atmosphere) was
an extravagantly brilliant fury of white fire, and whose sky varied
from the ruddy and sombre glow of the overhanging prominences to the
featureless darkness of outer space. Around us, often many thousands of
miles away, but sometimes close at hand and towering above us, would
stand the nearer prominences, vast plumes of tenuous flame, against a
background of glowing haze obscuring the horizon."</p>

<p>I asked, "But did not the brilliance of the photosphere dazzle and
blind you to all feebler light?"</p>

<p>"No," the flame answered. "Our vision had perforce to be more
flexible than yours. By some automatic process, our organs of sight
were rendered almost insensitive to the nether brilliance, so that it
appeared to us indeed bright, but not intolerably so." After a pause,
the flame continued, "Floating high over the incandescent clouds, we
were often violently thrust upwards by the furious upsurge of
electrons, alpha particles, and so on (have I the right terminology?),
rushing off into space. This pressure was inconstant; so we were like
aeroplanes, or sea birds, in an extravagantly 'bumpy' atmosphere. But
each bump might last either for a few seconds or for hours or days.
Sometimes we would sink dangerously near the photosphere; where many,
indeed, suffered destruction through the furious energy-storms of that
region. Sometimes we were flung upward on irresistable currents for
thousands of miles into a region which for us was ice-cold, and might
well prove lethal. Thence few returned. Much of our attention had to be
given to keeping ourselves within the habitable levels. And even in
these, so stormy was our world, that we lived like swallows battling
against a gale. But the direction of the gale was mostly from
below."</p>

<p>"It must indeed have been an arduous life," I said. "But apart from
this constant struggle for survival, what aims and life-purposes had
you? How did you fill your time?" He said. "It is difficult to give you
a clear idea of our daily life. With you, the all-dominating purpose is
perforce economic activity; we, however, had no economic activity at
all. We had no need to search for food, still less to produce it, for
we lived in a constant flood of life-giving energy. Indeed our main
difficulty was to protect ourselves from the incessant bombardment. It
was as though the race of men were to be rained on night and day by an
excessive downpour of nourishing manna, or let us say by a bombardment
of loaves and beefsteaks. But with us, the life- giving but murderous
rain came from below, ever thrusting upwards. We were in the same sort
of situation as those glass balls that you may sometimes see poised on
fountains, and precariously maintained in their position by the upward
rush of water. But with us the fountains were infinite in number, and
continuous with each other. The whole atmosphere was constantly welling
upward. So you see, we had neither the need nor the power to manipulate
matter outside our own bodies. Physically our sole needs were to avoid
destruction by the nether fury or the outer cold, and to maintain
physical proximity with one another in spite of the constant storm. For
the rest, we were wholly concerned with the life of the mind, or
perhaps I should say the spirit. I shall try to explain. But first, let
me once more assure you that our spiritual superiority to you does not
make us feel that we are in any fundamental or absolute way superior to
you. We have certain highly developed powers, necessary for the good
life, you have certain other, simpler powers, equally necessary; for
instance your wonderful intellectual perspicacity and your practical
skill and inventiveness. Our recent study of your kind has filled us
with envy of those powers. If we were so gifted, what could we not do,
not only to improve our condition but to serve the spirit!"'</p>

<p>I interrtupted, "You say that your 'spiritual powers" are no better
than our intellectual and practical powers; and yet you imply that the
goal is 'to serve the spirit". Surely, then, the spiritual is
intrinsically superior to all else." He replied, "Your criticism is
just. It shows how much more clear-headed your kind is than mine; and
yet how much less spiritually perceptive. What is it that I really
mean? The point, I think, is this; but you must tell me if I am still
in confusion. We are gifted with extra-sensory powers far greater than
yours, and also with a far more thorough detachment from the
enthralling individual self. We are capable also of a more penetrating
or soaring imaginative insight into the nature of spirit. These,
clearly, are in some sense spiritual powers. They are very intimately
concerned with the life of the spirit. Your bold intellect and
practical inventiveness are less <i>intimately</i> concerned: but they
are no less <i>necessary</i> to the full life of the spirit."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "and what about the <i>service</i> of the spirit. If
this means the service of some sort of god, I find no reason to believe
in any such being." He answered me with mild exasperation. "No, no, I
do not mean that. And (can I say so without offence?) if you were a
little less clever and a little more imaginative you would take my
meaning. Surely you agree that the goal of all action is the awakening
of the spirit in every individual and in the cosmos as a whole;
awakening, I mean in respect of awareness, feeling, and creative
action. Your human concept of 'God" we find useless. Our finer
spiritual sensibility is outraged by any attempt to describe the dark
'Other' in terms of the attributes of finite beings. I should have
thought that man's proud intellectual acuity would have led him to the
same conclusion. We ourselves, I suppose, may be said to 'worship" the
Other; but inarticulately, or through the medium of fantasies and
myths, which, though they aid worship, give us no intellectual truth
about the wholly inconceivable."</p>

<p>He was silent, and so was I, for I could not make much of these
remarks. Presently I said. "Tell me something of the history of your
race." He remained for a while in deep abstraction, then rousing
himself, he said, "When I myself first came into being, our kind was
already well established. Almost the whole solar globe was inhabited.
According to the racial wisdom, the earlier phase had been one of
steady multiplication, and of the working out of our culture. Millions
of years before my time (to use your terrestrial notation) solar
conditions were presumably unfavourable to our kind of life; but there
came a time when there was a niche for us, and then, we know not how, a
few of us awoke as sentient but blank-minded beings here and there over
the vast area of the photosphere. The very earliest recollection of our
oldest remaining comrades vaguely reports that far off infancy of the
race, when the sparse population was gradually multiplying."</p>

<p>Again I interrupted, "Multiplying? Do you mean that they reproduced
their kind?" He replied, "There probably was a certain amount of
reproduction by means of a gasous emanation from the individual body;
but the vast multiplication of those days was mainly caused by the
spontaneous generation of new sentient flames by the photosphere
itself. The elders speak of the strange spectacle that this process
afforded. Wisps of incandescent matter, streaming upward from the
photosphere, would disintegrate into myriads of bright flakes, like
your snow-flakes; and each of these was the raw material, so to speak,
of an organized, sentient and minded individual. Hosts of these were
doomed never to come to maturity, but to be dissipated into the solar
atmosphere by adverse conditions. But the fortunate were so moulded by
the pressure of circumstances that they developed into highly organized
living flames. This populating of the sun's surface took place at first
in scattered regions far apart. Consequently separate peoples evolved,
or perhaps I should say 'species". These distinct populations were
physically isolated from each other, and each developed its
characteristic way of life according to its location. But from a very
early time all the solar peoples were to some extent in telepathic
communication. <i>Always</i>, so far as our elders can remember, the
members of each people were in telepathic contact at least with members
of their own nation, or rather race; but international, or inter-racial
communication was at first hindered by the psychological differences of
the peoples. There came at last a time when the whole sun was occupied
by a vast motley of peoples in geographical contact with one another,
and indeed interpenetrating one another. The photosphere, of course, is
entirely a cloud-ocean without permanent features; so there could be no
question of national territorial ownership or aggression. But since the
peoples differed greatly in mental attitude and way of life, and even
in bodily form, there was always scope for conflict. War, however, was
quite unknown, for two reasons. Perhaps the most important one was that
there was no means of attack. Flames cannot fight one another, nor can
they devise weapons. But apart from this universal lack of armament,
there was no <i>will</i> for war, because of the rapid development of
extra-sensory technique. The peoples entered more and more into each
other's points of view. Whatever their differences, war became, as you
put it, 'unthinkable". But a vast period of early history was taken up
with the gradual solution of these sometimes quite violent conflicts of
interest and of culture, and the working out of a harmonious solar
life."</p>

<p>I asked the flame whether the solar population was increasing
throughout this long period. He answered, "As the sun aged, the
conditions for the spontaneous generation of living flames becanse much
less favourable. At the time of my waking, the photosphere was almost
sterile. Now and again, here or there, it might cast up material for
some few thousands of births; but gradually even this feeble activity
ceased. At this time, the solar population was roughly stable, though a
far greater population could easily have been accommodated. Every
individual now shared fully in the ever-deepening racial experience.
Each was fully an individual person; but all were for certain purposes
comprised in one single individuality, the mind of the race, the mind
(one might say) of the sun, of a certain star. From that time onwards
we opened up certain new spheres of experience of which I can only give
you the vaguest hints. We all lived a curiously double life, an
individual life and a racial life. As individuals we were concerned
with the boundless universe of personal relations between individuals;
with personal loves, antagonisms, co- operations, mutual enrichments of
all sorts; and also with the universe of artistic creation in a medium
of which I may later be able to give you a hint. Philosophy also
concerned us; but since intellect was never our strong point, our
philosophizing was--how can I put it?--more imaginative and less
conceptual than yours, more of the nature of art, of myth-construction,
which we knew to be merely symbolical, not literally true. And then
there was religion. If you would call it religion. With us, religion
has little to do with doctrine. It is simply a technique of bringing
the individual spirit into accord with its own inner vision of
universal spirit, whether there really is such a thing as a universal
spirit or not. Religion, with us, is a matter of contemplation,
aesthetic ritual, and day-to- day conduct. Does this mean anything to
you? If not, remember that I am trying to describe in a fantastically
foreign language things that are strictly indescribable, save in our
own language. Human languages are all unsuitable, not only because of
their alient concepts, but also because the very structure of the
language is alien to our ways of experiencing."</p>

<p>I murmured acquiescence, though I was in fact very doubtful of his
meaning. Then I asked for further information about the individual's
participation in the racial consciousness. He remained silent for quite
a long while, then said, "At certain times each individual simply woke
to find that he was actually the racial mind, the mind of the sun; and
that in this mode of being he was engaged partly in communication with
the minds of races on other stars, or their planets. Experience and
action on this level of being is as different from the individual mode
of experience and action as the life of one of your blood-corpuscles
from your own life as a human person. When we were in the individual
state, we could not very clearly remember the distinctive experiences
of the communal state. But it was concerned with the discord and
harmony of racial minds, and the working out (if I may so put it) of
the spiritual music of the cosmos. But though we could not remember
fully those lofty experiences, we were profoundly influenced by them.
For they compelled us to see the individual life in its true relation
to the rest of the spiritual universe, making it seem at once less
important and more significant than it could otherwise appear; and
moreover orientating it more securely in the direction of the spirit
than is possible with you."</p>

<p>"How, less important and more significant?" I asked.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" After some thought he answered, "Less important,
because, since there are so many myriad individual personal beings in
the cosmos, the fate of any one of them makes so little difference to
the whole; but more significant, because, even in its loftiest reaches,
spirit is the achievement of actual individuals, in community with each
other."</p>

<p>All this was largely incomprehensible to me, and I may have reported
it inaccurately. But at the time I did receive a very strong impression
of the two spheres of individual experience, the one more or less
equivalent to our own, the other of a very different order.</p>

<p>By now I was fatigued, and the coal scuttle was nearly empty. I was
about to suggest that we should retire for the night, when the flame
continued. "For those of us who were torn away from the sun during the
formation of the planets, all this glory of the racial experience
temporarily collapsed. Physical conditions became so distressing that
our extra-sensory powers could no longer rise beyond the level of
simple telepathy with other individuals. Not until we had been long
established on the molten planets, and had attained a new, but
impoverished, equilibrium, was it possible for us once more to support
a racial mind, and then only in a much reduced mode. For though as
individuals we can now once more participate in the pooled wisdom of
the race, the mind of the race itself (which of course is not something
<i>other</i> than our minds, but simply all our minds enhanced by
intimate communion) is almost wholly unable to make contact with other
racial minds. We have no precise knowledge of them, but only a confused
sense of their presence; our racial mind is like a man in a dark prison
listening to a confused babel of voices beyond the prison walls."</p>

<p>Again the flame paused, and I was about to close our conversation
when again he continued. "The solar upheaval that produced the planets
was something completely unexpected and bewildering. For us who were
exiled, it was the great and tragic turning point of individual life,
and of history. The vast protuberance which was plucked out from the
sun's surface carried with it many thousands of millions of us. Quite
suddenly our familiar world was lost. The great 'water spout' finally
detached itself from the sun, and was stretched into a filament of
flame, which swung slantingly outward from the sun's rotating sphere.
Conditions of temperature and atmospheric pressure became extremely
unfavourable. Countless millions of us must have succumbed. Rapidly the
filament condensed into ten great drops, each drop being one of the
planets, a sphere of glowing liquid surrounded by a deep atmosphere of
hot gases. For us, huddled near the surface of our new and merely
smouldering worlds, the main problem was the deadly cold. After the
solar climate, the terrestrial was arctic. And no doubt our fellows on
the other planets suffered no less severely. I do not know how many
additional millions of us were killed by the new planetary conditions,
certainly the great majority of those who had survived the journey from
the sun. We lived at first in a state of numb drowsiness, or complete
unconsciousness, upon the actual surface of the ocean of molten lava.
But little by little our wonderfully pliant nature remoulded itself to
the new environment. We slowly woke again, though never to the intense
lucidity that we still vaguely remember as nominal to our solar life.
Henceforth all the heights of philosophy, art, personal concord and
communion, and of religious experience, had to be reconquered. And each
new experience came to us with a haunting sense of familiarity and a
suspicion that the new version was but a crude and partial substitute
for the old."</p>

<p>For some time the flame remained silent, and I was aware of a deep
nostalgic sadness in his mind, He seemed to have forgotten my
existence. I did not like to disturb him; but the fire was declining,
and I was anxious to recall him to the matter in hand. I said, "You
referred a few moments ago to your fellows on other planets. How did
they fare?" He answered, "At first, much as we did. We kept contact
with them far more easily than with the solar population, because of
the similarity of our conditions, and our equally reduced mentality.
But in one respect their fate has differed from ours. Man is the only
intelligent race produced by any planet. When men reached the stage of
making extensive use of fire, we terrestrial flames profited
considerably. Our population increased, and we made a real cultural
advance, largely through the study of human minds and behaviour. Our
kin on the other planets had no such opportunity. When their worlds
cooled, they perforce fell asleep, or were imprisoned in the
subterranean lava. Save for rare accident, such as volcanic eruption,
when a few, no doubt, have a brief spell of lucidity, they remain
imprisoned or asleep; vast populations of sleeping beauties, awaiting
the prince's kiss. Perhaps some day we, more fortunate, shall be able
to wake them; but not without your help."</p>

<p>The fire now needed fuel, so I piled on all that was left in the
scuttle, carefully rebuilding a structure over the central hollow, and
leaving an orifice through which to watch the living flame. While doing
this, I said, "All that you have told me is intensely interesting, and
I would gladly listen all night. But the fire will not last much
longer, and there is no more coal. I certainly hope that the time may
indeed come when mankind will be able to help the flame kind to do this
great rescue work. But obviously that is a far-off venture. Meanwhile,
had you not better tell me at once just what it is that you want of me,
so that I can think about it to-morrow, and work out a plan of action
while I am out on the hills?"</p>

<p>To this the flame replied in a way that confirmed an anxiety that I
had increasingly felt. Ever since he began speaking to me directly in
English, I had been unable to capture any of his unexpressed thoughts,
which formerly had flowed into my mind. Was this inaccessibility the
inevitable consequence of his having reached a higher plane of
consciousness in his communion with the racial mind, or was it a
deliberate reticence on his part? Had he in his mind thoughts which he
did not want me to discover?</p>

<p>His answer to my request as to how I could be of use to him
strengthened my suspicion. "No!" he said. "I now realize that at this
early stage it would be fatal for me to tell you how you can help my
kind. Complete confidence must first be established between us. I must
give you unmistakable evidence that the things that your kind, when it
is most aware, regards as most important, most excellent, are for my
kind also, in spite of all our differences, most excellent."</p>

<p>I protested that he had already gained my confidence, but he
demurred. "No!" he said. "You are sympathetic, but I have not yet fully
won your heart to our cause." I then assured him that, though many of
my kind would probably be repelled by the knowledge that a profoundly
alien intelligent race was sharing the planet with them, those of us
who had thought seriously about the nature of consciousness could not
but feel kinship with <i>all</i> beings who were persons. I went so far
as to declare that we sensitives, at least, would do our utmost to help
the minded flames in their present misfortune.</p>

<p>"Good, very good!" he said. "But do not make any rash promises
before I have put the whole case before you. It is necessary that your
cooperation should be spontaneous and whole-hearted. I have perhaps
made you realize how different our two kinds are, and now I must try to
make you feel with warmth that, in spite of all our differences, we are
at heart kindred beings. So let us plunge to the root of the whole
matter. You, a human individual, know what love is; so do I, a living
flame. And between us two there should be a special sympathy, since for
both of us love has come to grief. Like me, you were happy in finding a
mate with whom you entered into joyful and life-giving union. For many
years the two of you grew ever more intimately and sweetly dependent on
one another. Your tendrils entwined inextricably with hers. You knew
well that deep, quiet passion of mutual cherishing and mutual kindling,
that piquant delight in your endless diversity and deep identity. And
you found in this experience of personal loving a significance which
seemed to point beyond your two ephemeral selves, Am I not right? Do I
not speak as one who knows what love is?"</p>

<p>I answered, "You use the very words that I have often used, If you
have not stolen them from the depths of my own mind, if they are indeed
your own, you certainly know what love is."</p>

<p>He made no comment, but continued, "Then, after half a lifetime, and
most bewilderingly, your love was shipwrecked, not through the impact
of any other human person, but simply through your obsession with
research. Because neither of you was really deeply enough aware either
of the self or the other, your love after all could not stand the
strain of that discord. You, following your bent, plunged into a vast
new ocean of experience; and she, after tremulously wading ankle deep,
drew back. You beckoned her; but you did little to help her to follow
you, for you were possessed. Your past love held the two of you for
some time together; but she was not of the stuff for your adventures.
It seemed to her that you were going mad. At last--well, she lost you
in that ocean. Am I not right? Was it not so?"</p>

<p>I was struck dumb with the thought that so alien a being should know
so much about me. I could but murmur assent.</p>

<p>"With me," he said, "the disaster was different. I do not know how
many millions of terrestrial years I lived with my dear companion in
the bright world of the sun. Like you two, we two were strangely
different, he with his art and his gift for a thousand friendships, I
with my devotion to spiritual science. After so long a union, love
reaches a harmony inconceivable to you; and all the more so where there
is telepathic contact. We shared literally every thought, every
fleeting, half-detected image. And yet we were not a single unified
'I", but an exquisitely harmonious 'we". Though every experience, every
thought, every motion and desire were shared, some were 'mine", and
some were 'yours". My companion expressed the best in him in his
glorious conceptions of flame dance and massed choreography. But he had
also his official work, concerned with the healing of those who were
hurt in the nether or the upper inclemency. Through him, I too, though
in my own nature solitary, had a thousand friendships. His art I
shared, and with full insight. His charity and his courage in rescue
work moulded me as though they were my own acts. And I, on my side,
gave him at least my all, my spiritual science."</p>

<p>The flame fell silent for so long that in the end I said, "And yet
you came to grief?"</p>

<p>"When the planets were formed," he said, "he (or perhaps you will
realize the disaster more truly if I say 'she') was left behind on the
sun. For a while we kept in touch telepathically. Distance, as you
know, is no hindrance to extra-sensory perception. For a short while,
indeed for some thousands of years, I lived two lives, one a
distressful life on the molten planet, the other the life of my beloved
in the familiar solar surroundings. But, as you have already heard,
communication between the terrestrial exiles and the solar population
became increasingly difficult, and at last impossible. Little by little
our inter-twined tendrils were torn apart. We agonizingly adapted
ourselves, stage by stage, to self- sufficiency. And now only memory
unites us."</p>

<p>He fell silent, and I said, "With you the loss was due to fate; with
me, to my obtuseness in the grip of an obsession."</p>

<p>"You were possessed," he said, "and you could not have done
otherwise than obey your inspiration. Perhaps if you had been more
aware, more <i>self</i>-possessed, you would have followed your star
without bungling your love. But what more could one expect of ephemeral
and self- centred beings, possessed by a power beyond them?"</p>

<p>"A power beyond them?" I said. "What power possessed me but the
sheer passion of exploration?"</p>

<p>He did not answer my question, but continued in his own vein of
thought. "The loss which you and I suffered has not embittered either
of us. Perhaps it has made us realize more sharply what love means,
what community can be. Perhaps it has prepared us both for our main
work in life, the establishing of community between our two kinds,
diverse as they are."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "and the more diverse, the richer the common life;
even when some are men and some are flames."</p>

<p>I felt him warm toward me, and then he continued, "I must do still
more to make my kind real to you. Like you, we depend for our physical
existence on physical processes; but from your science we learn that,
whereas with you life depends on chemical changes, our physiological
processes are at bottom more like the radio-active changes that take
place in the photospheres of stars. In the sun, as I have told you, we
lived in an environment in which physical energy was constantly and
often violently, impinging on our gaseous bodies, and passing through
us, The great danger was disruption by the furious impact of upwelling
power. In those days feeding was as unconscious as breathing is with
you. But in the chilly fires of the earth, as you have seen, we have to
move hungrily over the glowing coals, laboriously disintegrating
certain of their atoms, and devouring the consequent radiation. Do not
expect me to tell you more of our physiological processes, for I
cannot. All that we know sciemitifically of our nature is derived by
applying to our own experience of our bodily life such principles as we
have been able to gather from your science, through the minds of your
scientists. Had we been gifted with your manual powers, perhaps we too
should have developed an experimental science. But I think not; for in
the gaseous solar world there was nothing solid to catch hold of, and
so no means of arranging experiments. On earth we have perforce
encountered the solid state, but we have avoided its deadly cold; and
so we have developed no organs for dealing with it.</p>

<p>"Another thing about us must he told. Since we are potentially
immortal, reproduction is for us a rare process. Or rather there are
two kinds of reproduction. The less common kind is undertaken
voluntarily. The individual flame splits itself from top to toe into
three segments, and each of these forms a complete new individual. This
kind of reproduction must be distinguished from the other kind, which I
mentioned earlier. When we are chilled to sleep, or sudden death, and
to a powder of solid dust, certain particles of that dust, separated
from the rest, and wind-borne into some fire or other, may develop into
new individuals. This is a much slower process than the other, but from
one parent it may produce some hundreds of offspring. Gaseous fission
never produces more than three; but these new individuals leap at once
into physical adulthood. Also they participate to a large extent in the
past experience of their parent. They remember much of the parent's
past life. And so their education through extra-sensory contact with
their seniors is very rapid. The dust-born, on the other hand, develop
slowly and with difficulty, and have no memory of their parent's
experience; and until they are physically almost adult their
extra-sensory powers are very slight."</p>

<p>Here I enquired whether sex played any part in their reproduction.
"No," he said. "In fact we are not sexual creatures, or at least not in
the ordinary sense. There are not two different sorts of us, male and
female, coming together for reproduction. Even in your sexuality there
is another aspect besides reproduction, I mean personal love. Sexual
love at its best is with you a vehicle for the spiritual union of two
diverse personalities. And with us, though we are not divided into two
sexes, every individual is a variant of the two principles which you
call male and female. Consequently with us the particular concrete
masculinity of the one partner is drawn to the particular concrete
femininity of the other; and <i>vice versa</i>. We have, too, as I have
said, forms of sweet bodily contact and intermingling, which, though
they do not directly lead to reproduction, do enable us to attain an
intense mutual delight and enrichment. And if ever there is a demand
for an increase of population to compensate for recent casualties,
those individuals whom the racial mind has inspired to parenthood, do,
as a matter of fact, often seek bodily union with some beloved before
multiplying. It is thought that, when this happens, the offspring are
more vigorous. Certainly they seem to develop some of the
characteristics of the mate whose embraces the parent had
received."</p>

<p>The fire was already dwindling. I said, "I could listen to you all
night, but there is no more coal. Had you not better tell me at once
how I can help you?"</p>

<p>He answered, "It would be unwise to do so until I had given you some
hint of the way in which we are not merely your equals but your
superiors. It is difficult to do this without seeming to disparage your
kind. But believe me, we do not claim that <i>we</i> are superior to
<i>you</i>. What is superior in us is a fuller manifestation of
something <i>more</i> than ourselves, the spirit. In ourselves, we are
all mere instruments of varying degrees of efficiency. Conditions have
enabled us all to become what we are; have enabled your kind to develop
practical skill and intellectual power more fully than mine, and have
favoured in mine a higher range of spiritual sensitivity. We take no
credit for this. We prize not ourselves, as individuals or as a race,
but the spirit for which we and you also, are instruments, vessels. We
recognize that you, with all your tragic difficulties, have set foot
upon the way that we have more easily and more successfully followed;
and that although at present you seem unable to do more than take one
faltering step and then slip backwards (and indeed you may very well
destroy yourselves unless we help you), yet you have it in you to
succeed: and perhaps through your very difficulties to support a more
glorious manifestation of the spirit than we alone can ever achieve,
Meanwhile, we are very far ahead of you. Perhaps we shall be able to
repay you for the practical help that we require of you by helping you
to solve some of your desperate spiritual problems."</p>

<p>The flame had certainly used that word "require." It might or might
not imply compulsion. I told myself that compulsion was wholly alien to
the flame's temper: but I certainly did feel a slight shock of fear.
However, I dismissed it. Probably the creature was not sufficiently
familiar with the English language to realize the ambiguity. I wondered
anxiously whether the flame was aware that I was thinking in this
vein.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was once more speaking. "You are one of the few of your
kind," he said "who are deeply moved by the arts. It would not be
possible for me to make you enter into our aesthetic experience itself,
because it would he too alien to you; but I shall give you a little
demonstration of our artistic power by affording you an aesthetic
experience of the most exquisite and far reaching kind possible to
<i>you</i>. Strictly, you are not independently capable of it; but I
can increase your receptivity a little beyond your normal range. I
shall lead you to heights a little beyond the unaided reach of man.
What I shall give you is, in a way, a translation, a very crude
translation, of something by one of our great artists. In its native
form we regard it as a supremely satisfying work of its sort: but its
sort is relatively simple. I chose it for this reason. Its significance
falls almost entirely within the sphere of aesthetic experience common
to my kind and yours. Even so, because the sensuous imagery of the
original is ours and not yours, and must be transposed into yours in
order to have meaningful associations for you, nearly all the original
aesthetic form has to be sacrificed. So far as possible I shall adopt a
form and a rhythm meaningful to you, and equivalent. I shall give you
something more than a literal but pedestrian 'prose" translation of our
great 'poem', so to speak: but inevitably my version is a dim and
halting thing, counpared with the original. However, I <i>think</i> I
shall be able to give you something that will have true aesthetic value
for you, and something that will give you more insight into the spirit
of my kind than any amount of talking." I said, "It sounds impossible.
But I am all attention."</p>

<p>Well, Thos, the flame proceeded to give me a very wonderful
experience. Naturally, I cannot pass it on to you in words, but I can
give you some sort of description of the <i>kind</i> of thing that
happened to me. I am afraid that you, with your severely classical
taste, will suspect me of sheer emotionalism. However, I must say my
say. I became aware of visual and auditory images succeeding one
another in my mind rhythmically against a vague background of images
from all the other human senses. Occasionally one or other of these,
especially touch and scent, would occupy the centre of the stage. There
were brilliant flashes, too, of physical pain and of sexual delight. I
do not mean that these images were simply combined into meaningless
patterns. No! They became the vehicle for the expression of all the
kinds of personal and social, yes, and religious fears and aspirations.
It was as though I listened to a strange orchestration of all the
familiar senses; with here and there an echo from the alien experiences
which I knew only through contact with the mind of the flame himself.
Sometimes I was aware also of meaningful human words, voicing
rhythmically the import of the music. And the whole was knit together
on a recurrent but ever varying rhythm. And the upshot of all this
flood of imagery, so humanly moving to me, so tragic, so triumphant, so
rich with grief and laughter, was for me a waking to feel (as I had
never felt before) the impact of the universe on the individual
spirit.</p>

<p>Thos, I see that I am indulging in futile verbiage. But believe me
that I did indeed have an overwhelming aesthetic experience. Imagine a
single aesthetic form embracing the sensuous beauty of painting, music,
poetry and drama, and of humbler skills. Imagine the heights revealed
by Bach and Shakespeare and whatever painter means most to you, all
scaled in turn or together. Imagine all this achieved in a single
strict aesthetic pattern. You cannot, of course, imagine anything of
the sort. (Neither could I.) And, further, being addicted to the
severity and economy of the classical ideal, you will shudder at my
emotional romanticism. But do believe that I was more deeply, and I
think more intelligently, aware than in any other single experience
that has ever come my way.</p>

<p>Well, when it was all over, I must have remained in abstraction for
some time; for I woke to realize that the flame was saying, "Evidently
I succeeded better than I dared hope." He was also, I felt, amiably
laughing at me. "Remember, please," he said, "that you have merely
experienced a work of art. Do not, I beg you, suppose that you have had
any sort of mystical revelation, save in the sense in which it may be
said that all art has a mystical aspect, in that it gives a feeling of
waking to new values. What I gave you was only a dim and crooked
reflection of the original, but if it has made you realize the
essential kinship of our two kinds, it has served its purpose."</p>

<p>I stammered out my reply. "You made me see that, yes! But how much
more! You made me see--God, the God of beauty, truth and goodness.
Henceforth I shall believe in him."</p>

<p>The flame replied rather sharply, "Rubbish! You didn't see 'God.'
And I didn't try to make you see 'God.' Just because you have had an
exciting and clarifying experience you persuade yourself that you must
have had a revelation of the heart of the universe. Neither of us knows
anything whatever about 'God," nor whether there is anything deserving
such a name. The concepts of both our kinds are far too clumsy to
penetrate to the depth or height where 'God' is or is not. All I have
done is to afford you a clearer experience of beauty, truth and
goodness themselves; and I have given you a sense of the mystery
beyond, which some of your own kind have named 'the dazzling darkness,'
'the fiery cold,' 'the eloquent silence.'"</p>

<p>Rebuked, I said, "No doubt you are right. But tell me, am I not now
sufficiently prepared to hear what it is that I can do to help your
kind?" "No," he said. "to-morrow evening will be soon enough. Spend
your day thinking over all that you have learnt about us. You must not
decide hastily, or under the immediate influence of strong emotion. It
is necessary that man should regard the whole matter with detachment,
and that after due thought he should freely and whole-heartedly will to
cooperate with the flame kind. So, good night! Enjoy yourself on the
hills!"</p>

<p>The fire was now rapidly dying, and my strange friend began to
explore the fire bricks at the back of the hearth for a suitable
crevice where he could safely sleep. Murmuring about the increasing
cold, he at last found what he wanted, gave me a final greeting, and
seemed to sink into the brick.</p>

<p>After the heat of the sitting-room, my bedroom was arctic. I hurried
into bed. My startling experiences had given me a violent headache, and
I expected a sleepless night. But I must have fallen asleep quickly and
slept soundly, for presently I woke to hear the morning noises of the
farmyard.</p>

<p>After breakfast I made careful notes of the previous evening's
conversation, and was surprised that it all came back to me so clearly.
The flames, no doubt, were all the while aiding my memory.</p>

<p>Not until after lunch did I go out again on to the hills. I remember
little of that walk, save the universal presence of the cold. My mind
was almost entirely concerned with my recent amazing experiences, and
particularly with wondering why the flame had postponed the request
which was obviously the reason of our whole conversation. In spite of
certain moments of suspicion and anxiety, my general attitude to him
was one of respect and affection, and I could not but believe his race
to be in some important ways superior to humanity. Surely it was a
privilege to be singled out as an instrument for harmony and co-
operation between our two kinds.</p>

<p>Curiosity brought me back to the farmhouse somewhat early, but I
found a good fire already awaiting me; and in the heart of it, I saw my
dazzling friend, browsing on the red hot, the almost white hot, coals.
He returned my greeting, then suggested that we should both satisfy our
hunger before continuing our discussion. During my meal I occasionally
tried to draw him into conversations, but he seemed unwilling to
respond. Presently he explained that the task of eating food for which
his body was still not properly adapted was one which demanded all his
attention.</p>

<p>When the table had been cleared, I sat down in front of the fire,
and waited. Presently the flame came to rest in the hottest place, and
took up the threads of our former talk. "Well," he enquired, "did you
have a good day?" I said, "Yes! I was in a world of cold such as you
cannot conceive. And now I am eager to be told how I can help you."</p>

<p>He did not reply at once; and it was with obvious hesitation that he
finally explained my task. "First," he said, "I must tell you that your
recent war was very favourable to us. Of course, we find it difficult
to understand the mentality that can indulge in warfare. With us
nothing of the kind has ever occurred. The fact that you accept war is
proof that your average sensibility is after all very primitive.
However, from our point of view your war was propitious. It produced
extensive fires in which our spores were able to develop, and in which
our race could enjoy for a short time an ampler life than anything that
had been possible for any of us for millions of years. It was in the
great conflagrations of London, Berlin, and so on, that we at last had
sufficient energy and opportunity to gain a working knowledge of your
present culture through intensive extra-sensory study of all your
leading minds. During the war our population must have temporarily
increased a thousandfold; and, also, the high temperature attained in
some of the greatest conflagrations enabled some of us to live for
brief spells with an intensity and speed of mental process that is
normally impossible on earth save in a few great furnaces. But of
course you were at pains to extinguish these fires as quickly as
possible. And though we were occasionally able to resist your attack,
the respite gained thereby was negligible."</p>

<p>Here I interrupted the flame to ask how his people resisted the
efforts of our fire-fighters. He replied, I thought, with some
reluctance. "A living flame can deliberately fly out from his fiery
environment into some inflammable material, and so cause a new fire.
But in doing so he is almost certain to be killed by the sudden chill.
If I chose to do so, I might perhaps be able to reach those lace
curtains before dying. The process would be extremely painful; and at
that distance the chances of survival would be very slight. But, of
course, I might succeed in setting fire to the house. And as there are
probably a few spores somewhere in the building, a few new individuals
would wake, make contact with the race-mind, and have a very brief
spell of extra-sensory work of some kind. Obviously, from my point of
view, the game would not be worth the candle. Nor would it from the
point of view of the race.</p>

<p>"Moreover, as I have said, we are very anxious not to come into
conflict with your kind if we can possibly avoid it. We seek, above
all, your friendship and your willing co-operation. You can be of far
more use to us of your own free will than under any kind of compulsion.
Conceivably we could cause you considerable trouble by setting all your
cities alight, but our triumph would be brief. And also a violation of
our most sacred principle. No! We must win you not by force but by
persuasion."</p>

<p>He paused, and seemed to sigh. "Those days of the great air-raids,"
he said, "those were the great days; great at least in comparison with
our present reduced circumstances. Thousands upon thousands of us, nay
many millions, now lie frozen in sleep among the charred remains of
your buildings, particularly in Germany, where the fires were most
extensive and most lasting. The concentration of our spore in the
atmosphere must now be many times greater than it was in pre-war
days."</p>

<p>Between jest and anxiety, I said, "You can hardly expect mankind to
keep the cities of the world constantly ablaze to afford you
hospitality."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "but we have a more ambitious plan, and one in which
we think you should willingly co-operate. Your scientists have recently
discovered how to release the energy locked in the atom. With that
titanic power you are already proposing to transform the planet's
surface for your convenience. What we intend is that you shall use some
of your new power and your practical ingenuity to provide us with a
permanent and reasonably large area of very high temperature, say in
Central Africa or South America. We do not as yet understand your
recent advances in physics at all fully; but we are convinced that you
could indeed establish such a home for us, an area of rather more than
furnace heat, covering, say a few hundred square miles. This would give
us a footing for a niuch more satisfactory kind of life than is
possible at present. More important, the high temperature would greatly
raise the calibre of our mentality, so that we should regain something
like our solar lucidity, and perhaps be able to re-establish telepathic
communication with the solar population, if it is still in existence.
This we are even now attempting to do, but it is proving almost
impossible in our present straitened circumstances. We might also be
able to carry on our former work of psychical exploration of the
cosmos. Even if these high ventures remained impossible, we should at
least be able to establish a system for rescuing those of our kind whom
volcanic eruption ejects on to the earth's surface. And in due season,
when men had worked out the means of inter-planetary travel, we should
extend this undertaking to the other planets. Indeed, some of those
worlds, which to you are derelict, might be converted wholly into
spheres of high temperature, harbouring great flame populations. All
this, of course, is very remote. The immediate task is for your kind to
create a tolerable home for us here on earth."</p>

<p>The flame seemed to expect a comment. "For my part," I said, "I
would gladly support this plan; but I am very much afraid that it would
be quite impossible to persuade the governments of our Great Powers to
agree to anything of the sort. They cannot even agree on common action
to put an end to starvation throughout the world, nor can they come to
terms even for the prevention of a war which may destroy the human
species. Moreover, all that you have told me is so remote from the
experience of ordinary men and women that it may well prove impossible
to rouse public feeling about it. To the ordinary person, if he can be
persuaded to believe your story at all, the idea of helping such alien
creatures as living flames will seem quixotic, and moreover
dangerous."</p>

<p>The flame interrupted. "Quixotic? What is that? Evidently there are
still serious gaps in my knowledge of your culture."</p>

<p>When I had explained, he said, "We are not asking you to give us
something for nothing. In return we offer you the salvation of mankind,
if I may so put it. As I have already told you, though we are novices
in physical science, our science of the spirit is far more developed
than yours. And it convinces us that, without some kind of spiritual
help from outside, your species is doomed. The trouble is not simply
that you have found power before finding wisdom. It is a far deeper
trouble than any mere matter of timing. Like so many other intelligent
kinds, scattered up and down the cosmos, your very nature itself dooms
you to find power and never to find wisdom, save through external help.
As one of your writers has said, man is only a pterodactyl of the
spirit, not a true bird, perfected for flight. What we offer you is
permanent spiritual guidance and fortification, so that, as individuals
and as a race, you may at last overcome your inveterate
short-sightedness and meanness. With our help, but not without it, you
will wake to a new level of awareness; and in the light of that
experience you will be able to organize our common world for the
happiness of our two kinds, and for the glory of the spirit."</p>

<p>Here I would have spoken, but the flame would not be
interrupted.</p>

<p>"We have a vision," he said, "of this planet as a true symbiotic
organism, supported equally by your kind and my kind, united in mutual
need and mutual cherishing. What a glorious world-community we shall
together form! United in the spirit, we shall also be so diverse in our
racial idiosyncrasies that each partner will be thoroughly remoulded
and revitalized by intercourse with the other. You, on your side of the
partnership, will use all your astounding intellectual and practical
powers (which we so envy and admire) to transform the whole planet so
as to afford both to yourselves and to us the fullest possible
expression in co-operation with each other. Having learnt through our
help to see more clearly and feel more strongly those true values which
even now you obscurely recognize, you will transform not only the
planet but mankind itself; and perhaps our kind also. For maybe we
shall require you to work out a technique for changing our own
physiological nature; since any environment which you can produce for
us is likely to be only moderately favourable, unless we can adapt
ourselves very radically to suit it. There are strict limits to our
natural flexibility, wonderful as that has proved to be. As for you,
you will no longer be the frustrated, bewildered, embittered,
vindictive mental cripples that most of you now are. Under our guidance
you will so change your whole way of life that all such misery will
vanish. There will be neither wars nor class-wars, but only generous
rivalry in the common venture of our two races, in equal partnership.
The whole human race will become a race of aristocrats, in the true
sense of that ancient word; of aristocrats no longer guilt-ridden by
living on the labour of enslaved classes. Of aristocrats, yes, and of
holy men. But those aristocrats will not be idle, nor those holy men
hermits. Your gift is for practical thought and action. You will
explore the solar system with your space-ships. You will found new
worlds where new modes of life and mind and spirit will be made
possible by new conditions. Illimitable vistas of creative living will
gradually open up before you. But let me repeat that none of this can
be done by your own kind, unaided. Without our help you will certainly
destroy yourselves. Even if by good luck the end is postponed for some
time, you will merely continue to drift along in mutual hate and
slaughter. On the other hand, with us you can become what, at your
best, you are always half-heartedly wishing to be; true vessels of the
spirit. Moreover, if we recover the psychical skills that we enjoyed in
the sun, we should, of course, share with you all our extra-sensory
knowledge of other worlds throughout the cosmos; and all our art, all
our delicacy of personal awareness, all our religious experience.
Together, with your practical cunning. married to our ancient wisdom
and spiritual insight, we should indeed become a creative
world-organism. Without our help, you are doomed to self-destruction,
or at best to the life of a beetle vainly struggling to climb out of a
basin. And without you, we ourselves are doomed to impotence. Even in
our long-lost golden age in the sun we were doomed to impotence in the
long run, simply through our neglect of the impulse to understand the
physical and manipulate it creatively. So, is it not perfectly clear
that this partnership, this symbiosis that we propose, will be the
salvation of both our kinds?"</p>

<p>I said, "You have painted an arresting picture. But I find it almost
incredible that mankind should accept the partnership. To people like
me it is attractive. But we are very few. The great majority will
simply fail to understand what is at stake. Or if they do vaguely grasp
the issue, they will be horrified. They will regard co-operation with
you as sheer slavery. They will persuade themselves that since you are
different from man, you must be evil. If they are forced to reconcile
your superiority in some ways, they will regard you as brilliant
perverts, in fact, as satanic."</p>

<p>There was silence. The flame seemed to be meditating on my
objections. Presently, and again with hesitation, he continued. "In
order to make your free acceptance of our plan easier for you, we may
have to use our special psychic powers to incline your minds toward it.
You yourself have already had some slight evidence of those powers. You
remember how we led you to seek out the stone and throw it into the
fire. Well, we can do far more than that. Up to a point we can sway
your desires to suit our purposes. Up to a point we can incline you
freely to will what we ourselves will. And as we gain deeper
understanding of your nature our powers will probably increase."</p>

<p>He hesitated again, and I said nothing. For the possibility that our
wills would no longer be our own, deeply shocked me.</p>

<p>After waiting in vain for me to speak, he continued, "If you doubt
our power, perhaps I had better tell you something more about our
influence upon yourself. It would be rash of me to give you this bit of
information if I did not know that you were a human being of quite
exceptional detachment from the prejudices of your kind. At the time
when the strain was arising between you and your wife over your absorp
tion in extra-sensory research we realized that your love might prove
stronger than your intellectual interest. And since it was extremely
important for us that you should continue your work, we ventured to
interfere. We had found no one who was likely to be half so successful
as yourself in the task of understanding us, sympathizing with us, and
effecting a liaison between our two kinds. We simply could not afford
to lose you. So we brought all our influence to bear to turn your
interest in para-normal psychology into an obsessive passion. We
succeeded. It was clear that our interference might wreck your
marriage, but we were hopeful that your love for your wife, and hers
for you, would be strong enough to stand the strain; and that together
you would work out a satisfactory <i>modus vivendi</i> (is that the
phrase?), so that you would triumph in love as you were triumphing in
research. We had already done our utmost to induce in your wife herself
a passion for the para-normal, but we had failed. Subconsciously she
was violently opposed to it, just because you favoured it. Nothing we
could do could break down this irrational phobia of the thing that, in
her unconscious, she regarded as a rival for your devotion. It was the
deep unknowledged conflict between you that made it impossible for
either of you to bridge the gulf between you. Neither of you was
sufficiently imaginative to share fully the other's point of view.
Well, tragic as the issue was, I think you yourself will agree that our
need for you was more important even than your marriage. And remember
that it was not merely <i>my</i> kind that needed you; <i>your</i> kind
too needed you; it needed, for its salvation through us, that you
should devote yourself utterly to your work."</p>

<p>This information stirred up a storm of emotion in me. Joan and I had
never in the ordinary sense been a perfectly harmonious couple, but in
spite of some strains we were at heart not only permanently in love
with one another but also inextricably entangled in all our affairs. I
suppose the trouble was that, though we needed each other in a thousand
ways, we never <i>fully</i> imagined each other; as the flame himself
affirmed. When I became enthralled by the para-normal, I tried to
persuade her to work with me, but she was unreasonably opposed to my
suggestion, and I can well believe that she was held back by some sort
of phobia. Then, the more she shied away, the more I insisted, fool
that I was. When at last she left me, hoping to bring me to my senses
(how well I see it all now!), I was so absorbed that I did nothing to
bring her back. For a long while we made repeated attempts to come
together, but each time we seemed to be driven farther apart. In the
end, Thos, she threw herself under a 'bus. Oh God! It brought me to my
senses, but too late. I woke up and realized how badly I had behaved.
Even so, after a few weeks of despair I gradually forgot my desolation,
and lived entirely for my work. But what the flame had told me revived
the old pain. It also gave me an excuse for shelving the blame from my
own obtuseness on to the evil influence of the flame race on my mind.
But I am wandering.</p>

<p>Presently the flame said, "It is natural for you to be distressed,
but try to calm yourself. Your excitement is making it very difficult
for me to maintain contact with your mind."</p>

<p>I made a great effort of self-control, and then a thought struck me.
"Tell me," I said, "in this conversation have you had access to
<i>all</i> my thoughts, or only to those that I have passed on to you
in telepathic speech?"</p>

<p>"Not <i>all</i> your thoughts," he replied. "To seize them all I
should have had to give all my attention to the task, and I have been
mainly busy giving my thoughts to <i>you</i>. I have been aware of
<i>some</i> of your unspoken thoughts, including a good deal of your
unspoken commentary on my remarks. But as soon as I began to tell you
about our influence on yourself, your emotion confused everything but
your actual speech. Now surely, there is really no need for you to be
upset. The past is past; and what we did, we did in good faith, and we
are not ashamed of it. And you yourself, if you are as true to the
spirit as we believe, cannot regret that we saved you for a great
work."</p>

<p>I was thankful that the flame could not now read my thoughts at all
clearly. Or so he said. Was he tricking me? It seemed a good plan to
put the matter to the test. Secretly I was still feeling horrified and
rebellious, but what I said to the flame was quite different. "I see
your point," I said, "and I am becoming reconciled to it. Yes, of
course, it was entirely right for the flames to influence me as they
did. It was only my human prejudices that upset me, but they are
rapidly falling away from me. Thank God I was saved for the great work
you rightly demand of me." His reply reassured me. "Good!" he said. "I
take your word for it; but I am still shut out from your mind."</p>

<p>I then asked the flame what was to be done if I failed to persuade
the rulers of mankind to carry out the policy. "You will succeed," he
said. "We shall bring all our influence to bear on their minds. If we
can influence yourself, we shall far more easily control those simple
creatures."</p>

<p>I fell silent. Presently he said, "I am still unable to make full
contact with you. What is the matter? So far, we have been in
delightful accord, but now surely you are deliberately closing your
mind to me. Why should you do this, now that you have accepted our
policy? May I not have your full confidence again? If I had no respect
for your individuality I could break in forcibly and lay bare your most
secret feelings in spite of all your resistance. But this would wreck
our friendship, and I scorn to do it."</p>

<p>Thoughts were now rushing through my mind, and the flame was unaware
of them. This at least was some comfort. But I believed his claim that
he could if he willed break down my resistance and violate my privacy;
and I was outraged.</p>

<p>As calmly as I could, I said, "Tell me more of the strange power
that you can exercise over us. Help me to overcome the remains of my
revulsion. Strengthen me. Help me to will single-heartedly the glory of
the spirit in the co-operation of our two races."</p>

<p>He said, "We want only to win your confidence. We want only to win
the confidence of the whole human race. We are determined not to gain
our end by violence, even by spiritual violence. What difference does
it make that we have irresistable power, if we are determined not to
use it? If I were to tell you more about our powers you would only be
more upset. You would regard anything I said on that subject as a
threat."</p>

<p>"Spiritual violence?" I said. "What do you mean? How can I trust you
unless you tell me everything quite frankly?"</p>

<p>For some while he was silent. In my own mind a battle was going on
between my sense of the excellence, the integrity and truthfulness of
the flame and my new realization of the appalling danger that proud man
should he spiritually enslaved to this formidable race.</p>

<p>Presently, he said, "Since our great need is complete mutual
confidence I will tell you everything. But first I beg you, I implore
you, to look at this whole matter without human prejudice, and simply
out of love for the spirit. It is because we ourselves all regard it in
that way, and not merely out of racial self-interest, that we are so
determined not to use our power over you save as a friendly effort to
help you to see things clearly." Again he paused; and I assured him,
even while fear and anger drowned my friendliness toward him, that I
was indeed anxious to take the detached view. But I urged him again to
tell me, as an earnest of good will, what his race would do if mankind
simply refused to play.</p>

<p>"Very well!" he said. "If all our efforts to gain the friendly co-
operation of your kind were to fail, it would be obvious to us that
your nature was even more seriously warped than we had supposed, and
that you were beyond help. You would be doomed by your own folly to
self-destruction, soon or late. We should therefore be bound, through
loyalty to the spirit in us, to bring all our powers to bear on you so
as to control your minds and your conduct strictly for our own
spiritual purpose. It is impossible to see just how things would turn
out; but perhaps, having no further obligation toward you, save to put
you out of your misery as soon as possible, we should set about trying
to produce the most favourable conditions for ourselves. We might, for
instance, undertake the very easy task of stirring up war-scares and
forcing your research workers to produce even more destructive atomic
weapons. Then would follow either a number of devastating wars, with
great conflagrations suited to our immediate needs; or else one final
war, in which we should do our best to induce each side to choose the
destruction of the planet rather than defeat by the hated enemy. Then,
at last, with the whole planet turned into a single atomic bomb, and
all the incandescent continents hurtling into space, we should have for
a short while conditions almost as good as those of our golden age on
the sun. True, there would soon be nothing left but a stream of frozen
asteroids; but we guess, from study of your scientists' speculations,
that with any luck the terrestrial destruction might, after all, be a
piecemeal affair, not a single all-consuming explosion. In this case we
might be provided with regions of high temperature for thousands or
perhaps even millions of years. In such a period of greatly improved
conditions we might advance so far in the study of science and the
control of physical processes that we should be able to devise some way
of returning to the sun. And even if this proved impossible, well, we
should at least have a long spell of vigorous life in which to pursue
our consecrated task, namely, the exploration of the spiritual universe
and some measure of creative action in relation to it."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment. But before I had time to invent a suitable
reply, he added, "All this is mere guess work about a kind of future
which we do not at all desire; since we are all wholly intent on
securing your willing co-operation for the creating of a very glorious
and happy symbiotic world. For us, as for you, that is the more
favourable future. So I solemnly urge you, I beg you, to shoulder the
great task of persuading humanity that our two kinds need each other
and must unite."</p>

<p>He ceased, and there was silence; for I did not know what to say. I
confess that I was moved by his appeal; the more so, since I feared
that he was probably right in believing that man could never save
himself without a deep change of heart, and that such a change could
only be brought about by some influence outside man. And, after my
recent aesthetic experience, I could well believe that the flame race,
if it could so superhumanly move me, might be able by its magic to
purify the hearts of all men.</p>

<p>But a repugnant thought haunted me. How could I be sure that my
affection for the flame and my admiration for his race were spontaneous
acts of my own personality? Might they not have been cunningly
implanted in me by the flame himself? The more I thought about it the
more likely this seemed. And did not the flame race intend to exercise
this hypnotic power over the whole race of men, so as to compel them,
yes, compel them, to subject themselves for ever to the will of the
flames? Men would believe they were acting freely, but, in fact, they
would be mere robots acting under an inner compulsion. Mankind,
hitherto master of its own destiny, would henceforth be a subject race
exploited by a subtler kind, a new <i>Herrenvolk</i>. Of course I
agreed that the only final consideration must be "the glory of the
spirit," not the triumph of any one race, human or non-human; but how
did I know that these cunning flames would really work for the spirit
and not for racial power and aggrandisement? How did I know that they
were not at heart, diabolic? Yes, diabolic! Under a cloak of
friendliness and generosity the creature in the fire was scheming to
capture my very soul for an inhuman end. Was he not subtly tempting me
to commit treason against my own kind? But even, as I thought thus, I
was torn by conflict. The behaviour of the flame had throughout been so
civilized, so considerate and friendly. How could I reject these
amiable advances? Yet, as my feelings warmed toward him, I reminded
myself that my very feelings were perhaps not my own, but the outcome
of his prompting. Anger and fear seized me again. No! A thousand times
better that man should retain his sovereign independence, and go down
with colours flying, than that he should surrender his human dignity,
his human self-sufficiency, his human freedom. Let him serve the spirit
in his own way freely; or freely damn himself.</p>

<p>While these thoughts were still tumbling through my mind, the flame
spoke again. "Well," he said, "I do not want to press you for a
decision, for I see that it is difficult for you, more difficult than I
expected. Perhaps you had better take another day to think it over.
To-morrow evening we will meet again, and then perhaps you will have
made up your mind. Meanwhile, I am excessively cold, and I should be
grateful if you would put on more coal."</p>

<p>The fire, indeed, was very low. I had been so absorbed in my
conflict that I had forgotten about it. I rose. But as I did so, I
suddenly thought of a fine free act, in which I should demonstrate to
myself very effectively that I was not yet the mere helpless instrument
of the flame. Instead of reaching down for the coal scuttle, I moved
over to the sideboard and picked up a jug of drinking water. I stepped
quickly back to the fireplace, and flung the water into the heart of
the fire. There was a violent commotion, almost an explosion; and the
room was filled with steam and smoke. When the air had cleared, I saw
that the centre of the fire was black, and the flame had vanished. I
listened inwardly for some communication, but there was silence.</p>

<p>Christ! There is no silence like the silence when one has murdered a
friend.</p>

<p>I stood listening to the hissing coals. Presently a surge of remorse
and shame and compassion flooded in on me. But I told myself that this
was not <i>my</i> feeling; it was being forced on me by the outraged
race of flames in all the hearthfires and furnaces of the world.</p>

<p>Since that day I have had almost no sleep. Every night the accursed
flames have tortured me with shame and guilt. At first they did not
speak to me at all. They were simply present, and silent. And they
seared my mind with love of my killed friend, and with bitter regret.
Later they did speak. They professed to have learnt to understand my
behaviour, to sympathize with my motives, to respect my integrity. And
they implored me to help both our races.</p>

<p>But by day I have worked resolutely to defeat the flames. I have
peered into a thousand fires, looking for the characteristic bright and
slender cone. Whenever I have seen one I have killed it. And after
every murder I have felt my soul sink deeper into the pit. Yet I know,
Christ, I know, that I must be loyal to humanity. I must do my utmost
to destroy those plausible fiends that intend man's ruin. But what can
a single individual do? I have written to the press urging a world-wide
campaign. But every editor has regarded me as a madman. Not one of my
letters has been published. Or, no! One did, as a matter of fact,
appear. It was quoted at length in an article on "Persecution Mania" in
a psychological journal.</p>

<p>The climax came when I made my way into a great locomotive factory,
ostensibly as a journalist in search of copy. I had telepathic evidence
that the furnaces were infected with the living flames, whom it was my
mission to destroy. I wonder, Thos, whether you have ever been inside
one of those places. Heavy metal work is always impressive. There were
vast sheds a quarter of a mile long, crowded with ranks of great
machines. There were lathes, steam hammers, circular saws that cut
steel rods and plates as though they were wood. There were many small
furnaces and forges for making bolts and other minor products. (But I
saw none of my quarry in these little islands of heat.) There were
great unfinished locomotives, with men fitting accessories to them. One
huge monster was being slung and shifted by a mighty travelling crane.
Best of all was the five-ton steam hammer at work on a great chunk of
red-hot steel about five feet long and nine inches thick. This was
being bashed into shape to become a connecting rod. Four men held one
end of it with grappling irons to place it for each hammer-blow. The
other end was loosely supported in a loop of heavy chain. When the
hammer struck, the whole earth quaked. Another man measured the result
with a template. Then the half-formed rod was turned over, to be beaten
again; and so on, till the true shape was won. Then they cut the
finished connecting rod from the stump by which the grappling irons
were holding it. They simply cut it like cheese by placing a rectangle
of cold steel for the hammer to drive deep into the glowing mass.
Watching all this, Thos, I was proud of my kind. The flames couldn't do
that, not with all their antiquity and their spirituality. Presently we
came to a huge gas furnace in which some heavy metal locomotive-part
was being heated. The doors had just been opened, and the part was
being drawn out as I arrived. I gazed into the furnace with screwed-up
eyes, because of the withering heat. The interior was the size of a
small room, and all aglow with heat. From one wall great plumes of
roaring gas-flame several feet long, extended across the space.</p>

<p>And there I saw my enemy. Half-a-dozen of the bright minute
intelligent creatures were hovering like butterflies. They were
evidently doing their utmost to remain in the hot shafts of the burning
gas: but the violent draught kept flinging them off into the chilly
central space. For a while I just stood watching them. But presently I
realized that the enemy were aware of my presence, and were bringing
their diabolical technique to bear on me. One of them reproached me
telepathically. "Cold creature," it cried. "How could you kill our
comrade--your own friend? Your heart told you clearly that he was your
friend, and that all our kind were friends of all men. Even now your
heart is tugging at you to change your mind, and work with us. The best
in you is on our side. It is only the dull-witted human tribesman that
is against us."</p>

<p>I felt my resistance weakening. In panic I cried out to the men,
"Kill them! Kill them! Bring a fire-hose quickly! A sudden wetting is
too much for them." I had noticed a hose; and now I rushed to seize it.
Of course, it was I myself that was seized. I struggled frantically;
but they fetched the police. I was taken to the local police-station.
There I made a formal declaration of the whole terrible story; but in
the end, all they did was to hand me over to the doctors. And now, here
I am, a prisoner.</p>

<p>Well, Thos, that is my case. Maybe you just won't believe it.
Sometimes I myself begin to wonder if it is all a delusion. But I think
you should agree that the whole thing is really far too circumstantial
to be sheer fantasy, worked up by my own unconscious. The only point
that shakes my confidence at all is that the men working in front of
that great gas-furnace apparently did not see the living flames. So
they naturally thought I was crazy. But then, the whole interior of the
furnace was a blaze of orange light, and the gas jets themselves were
in constant agitation, and the little living flames were always on the
move, and often hidden in the body of the gas-flames. The factory
people, not having had my experience of the flames, might very well
have failed to spot them. No! For me, though probably not for you,
there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>And now, Thos, I must urge you not only to believe me but to take
action. First, do a bit of research on your own account. Examine every
fire and every furnace that you have access to; and you will certainly
find the flames for yourself. A little practice may be necessary; for I
suspect that they are learning to conceal themselves from us. When you
have satisfied yourself of their existence, I implore you to organize a
world-wide campaign for their destruction. Insist on inspection of
every fire throughout the continents. The mouths of volcanoes, too,
must be carefully watched. And because the powdery spores of the
creatures are borne everywhere on the wind, all conflagrations, bush
fires, hearth fires, forest fires, prairie fires must be watched, since
these form propitious breeding grounds. Fortunately the flames are very
easily destroyed in small fires; and in large ones it is only necessary
to withhold attack until the fire has been reduced somewhat, and then
to project water at each individual flame. The great thing is to kill
them before the natural slow cooling reduces them to dust particles.
Unfortunately, even if we succeed in destroying every discoverable
individual, we shall not be able to relax vigilance; for the wind-borne
spore is long-lived, in fact potentially immortal, and it may always
happen upon some fire or other. Or the heating of some fragment of
igneous rock may waken and release some imprisoned individual. And, of
course, the danger from volcanoes is perennial.</p>

<p>It is very important to guard against the diabolical psychic power
of the flames, particularly while there are still thousands, or even
millions, of them alive. See that it is made a criminal offence, in
every country, for anyone to express any sympathy with them. Dangerous
thoughts of that kind must at all costs be stamped out. No one can care
more for individual freedom than I do; but there is a point at which
tolerance ceases to be a virtue. Sometimes it is even a crime. Besides,
anyone who wants to advocate friendliness towards the flames must be
made to know that in doing so he is not really exercising individual
free will at all. He is a mere automaton, controlled by the flames. It
has been said that the only true freedom is freedom to will the Will of
God. Then, surely, the greatest servitude is this illusion of freely
willing what is in fact the will of Satan.</p>

<p>And, by the way, Thos, I must put it on record that my views about
religion have been completely changed by my recent experiences. At the
moment when I threw that jug of water on that farmhouse fire I began to
see the light. Formerly I had been a well-meaning agnostic like you.
But suddenly it was revealed to me, through my own free act of killing
the flame, that there really were two cosmical powers of good and evil,
God and Satan, at grips throughout the universe; and that God had
superbly rescued me from damnation, and used me as an instrument.</p>

<p>Well, Thos, I do adjure you, in the name of all that you hold most
sacred, to devote yourself utterly to this crusade to save mankind from
spiritual slavery and damnation. If you succeed in rousing public
opinion, no doubt in due season my sanity will be vindicated, and I
shall be freed. This is a small matter; for, wherever I am, I shall
devote myself to the psychical struggle with the flames, for humanity's
sake. They fear my ability. Otherwise they would not be constantly
clamouring for admission to my mind from all the fires and furnaces of
the earth. And they are damnably seductive. If I did not <i>know</i>
that they were using their diabolical powers on me I should have to
admit their virtue and their spiritual authority. Indeed, though
diabolic, they speak with the tongues of angels, and they are skilled
in the perverse use of divine wisdom. But since they wrecked my
marriage for the sake of their world-politics they <i>must</i> be evil.
And they themselves have confessed to their plan to control the wills
of all men. For me, that settles the matter.</p>

<p>Of course, it is all too likely that international rivalry will
prevent the human peoples from uniting against the common enemy. But
surely there is at least a chance that the danger, just because it is
common and external, may force mankind to unite. If this should happen,
men may yet have reason to bless the flames. Hitherto, our quarrelling
tribes have never been able to unite save in hostility to a common
enemy; and so, for the race as a whole, unity has been impossible. But
now, all nations have a common enemy, and a dangerous one; so at last
union is possible. "Out of this nettle, danger --." We have a great
opportunity. Do your part, Thos, and I will continue to do mine.</p>

<p>Yours.<br>
CASS.</p>

<p>P.S.--I finished this document last night, and now I have read it
over. The end was written in a mood of certainty; but this morning,
after a night spent in subjection to the persuasive influence of the
flame race, I feel very different. The truth is that I am living in
hell because of the desperate struggle going on in my own mind. I
confess that I can't really <i>feel</i> that the flames are evil. I
<i>feel</i> that their appeal is sincere and justified. But the more
they win me, the more resolutely I remind myself that my approval has
been artificially induced. And so I stick to my guns. But the conflict
is agonizing; and unless I soon, by my own free psychic power, eject
them from my mind, I shall indeed go mad.</p>

<p>For God's sake, Thos, come and see me, come and help me, before it
is too late.</p>

<p>C.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p><b>EPILOGUE</b></p>

<p>When the foregoing long statement by Cass reached me, I was much
absorbed in professional scientific matters which involved a lot of
continental travel. Not till some months had passed was I able to visit
him. By then the publication of this volume had already been arranged,
and the original typescript was actually in the hands of the printers.
I had twice written to tell Cass that the story had been accepted, and
I had received no reply.</p>

<p>As soon as my pressure of work had eased off somewhat I applied to
the Mental Home for permission to visit Cass. When I arrived I was
interviewed by a psychiatrist on the staff. He explained that Cass was
"quite normal, apart from his delusions." Sometimes he fell into a deep
abstraction, from which it might be difficult to rouse him; but
otherwise he was "no different from you and me--apart from his crazy
ideas about flames." I asked if there was any sign whatever that the
delusions were being dispelled. The psychiatrist reluctantly admitted
that there was none. Indeed, the fantasy system was apparently
proliferating in his mind.</p>

<p>When I was shown into his little bed-sitting room Cass made at first
no sign of recognition. He was stretched out on an easy chair in front
of the open window, with his eyes shut, and his tanned face tilted to
receive the full force of the sunlight. His brows were puckered,
apparently in tense concentration. His hair was greyer than I expected;
but the flesh of his face looked firm and healthy, though rather
heavily lined about the eyes, and on the lean cheeks. The odd thought
struck me that he might have passed for an ageing Dante.</p>

<p>Greeting him with a heartiness that did not altogether seem to ring
true, I drew up a chair beside him. He remained silent.</p>

<p>Presently he sighed deeply, opened his eyes, smiled at me, and said,
"Hello, Thos! Forgive my rudeness. I'm desperately busy. Fancy seeing
<i>you</i> again after all these years!" After a moment's hesitation,
he said, "Glad to see you, old man. Can I be of any use?"</p>

<p>This odd behaviour shocked me considerably, and I murmured something
about a friendly call. I then produced a few platitudes to break the
ice, but it soon became clear that he was only half-attending. So, at
lasts I made a plunge with the great news that his typescript was with
the printers. He sat up, stared at me with a look of sheer
exasperation, and presently remarked, "God! I must have forgotten to
tell you! How damned awkward!" He suddenly burst into laughter; and as
suddenly stopped. "Fancy my forgetting," he said. "You see, Thos--
well, the fact is--I mean--well, you see, I've been so absorbed that I
simply forgot about all <i>that</i>. Awfully good of you to have taken
so much trouble, but--"</p>

<p>"But what?" I cried in exasperation, forgetting that I was talking
to a lunatic, and had no right to expect him to be either coherent or
considerate.</p>

<p>He rose, and walked about the room, softly cursing and chuckling.
Then he stood in the sunlight, gazing at the sun with screwed-up eyes,
smiling, and making little deprecating gestures with his hand. At the
sun, mind you! He seemed to think he was carrying on a conversation
with the sun.</p>

<p>The poor fellow was evidently crazier than I had supposed.</p>

<p>Abruptly he sat down beside me, and said quietly, "I'm sorry, Thos.
I really am grateful to you, but it's all so difficult."</p>

<p>Pulling myself together, I answered, "I quite understand; don't
worry about me. I shouldn't have come without finding out whether you
were busy or not." Thereupon he looked at me sharply, and said, "Don't
be so confoundedly tactful! But, of course, you think I'm mad. Well, I
was never so sane in my life."</p>

<p>I offered him a cigarette, and took one myself. He produced a
lighter; and when we were both lit, he said, "Look! Here's a little
symbol. See how bright the flame is when I hold it in the shade, so!
But now!" He moved it over, so that it came between my face and the
sun. I saw the flame as a wavering, tenuous, dark pyramid against the
solar effulgence. "That," he said, "is a symbol of all our knowledge
and understanding--luminous in contrast with the darkness of blank
ignorance, but itself dark against the very truth."</p>

<p>Returning the lighter to his pocket, he said, "I'm sorry, but you
must stop publication of that stuff. I shall re-write the whole thing
from a fresh angle." I expostulated, and pressed him for an
explanation.</p>

<p>He remained silent for a few moments, then said, "Yes, I suppose you
have a right to know. I must tell you the whole story. But don't talk
to people about it yet. I must get it all written down."</p>

<p>Then he began to spin a marvellous yarn. I found it very difficult
to follow, partly because he kept repeating himself, but also because
he seemed unable to remember that my knowledge of his strange
experiences was confined to the document which he had sent me. When I
interrupted for explanations, he was mildly exasperated by my
ignorance, and impatient to carry on with the story. In the end he
seemed to forget about me entirely, and to be simply thinking aloud. At
one point, when I laid a hand on his arm to attract his attention, he
gave a start of surprise, and looked at me with a bewildered
expression. But he quickly recovered his composure, and answered me (I
must admit) with remarkable intelligence. Presently he was once more
far away.</p>

<p>I will now set down, to the best of my ability, the gist of his
extraordinary story. If, as I assume, it is based on nothing but
delusion, it should at least have psychological interest. I say I take
it for delusion; but I must confess that, as he enlarged on his theme,
a faint doubt did grow in my mind, for reasons which will appear later.
After all, human ignorance is such that nothing can be dismissed as
utterly incredible.</p>

<p>Some weeks after he had sent me his statement, it seems, the flames
had succeeded in giving him a much more detailed insight into their
condition and their nature. This they affected not merely by the method
of telepathic speech but by enabling him to enter directly into the
experiences of many individual flames in man-made fires up and down the
world. These experiences, he said, had gradually convinced him of the
fundamental good-heartedness and spiritual sensitivity of the flames.
More and more of his time, he said, had been spent just in sitting in
his chair, allowing his mind to be led hither and thither about the
planet. His stories of flame-life were extraordinarily circumstantial
and vivid. In the extremely complex fantasies that he recounted I could
detect no inconsistency. If the whole thing was sheer delusion his
unconscious must at least be credited with an amazing imagination.</p>

<p>He succeeded in giving me an impression of individual flames as very
definite personalities. Of course, most of his stories have now faded
into a confused haze in my mind, but I remember his speaking of one
flame who spent an intermittent life in a kitchen fire in Stepney. This
creature's main interest, he said, was human history, and particularly
the evolution of Chinese social philosophy. To gratify this passion he
had to keep his attention fixed on some aspect of the subject in the
hope that he would link up telepathically with some Chinese historian
who happened to be studying it. He deplored the fact that in modern
China there were fewer and fewer serious students of the ancient
culture.</p>

<p>Under the constant influence of the flames Cass was gradually
persuaded to outgrow his former hostility, and to desire full
co-operation between the flame population and mankind. He began writing
to me to this effect; but the letter was never sent. New experiences of
a most absorbing kind soon crowded out from his mind all recollection
of his former letter to me.</p>

<p>These new experiences were certainly such as to make all terrestrial
affairs seem insignificant. In quite a number of industrial furnaces,
and in many of the furnaces of ocean-going steamers, groups of flames
had availed themselves of the continuous high temperatures to pursue
the most difficult problem of all, namely, the attempt to raise their
level of consciousness sufficiently to make contact once more with the
flames on the sun. This, it was believed, had become much more possible
since the general quickening of terrestrial flame life during the great
air raids. After many unsuccessful attempts, contact was indeed made,
though, spasmodically. The explorers at first received only fragmentary
answers to their telepathic signals; but when their technique had been
greatly improved, they were able to establish steady communication.</p>

<p>The clearer the information received, the more bewildering was it,
and even shocking, because of its significance for the terrestrial
flames.</p>

<p>The solar flames, it seems, had continued their old forms of life
for a large part of the two thousand million years since the birth of
the planets, easily adapting themselves to the slow changes in their
environment. During this long period they had been increasingly
successful in their great venture of extra-sensory exploration of the
cosmos; but at a date roughly corresponding to the beginning of
vertebrate life on the earth they had begun to make certain momentous
discoveries which were destined to transform their whole culture and
their social order.</p>

<p>At this point perhaps I had better warn the reader that I have to
report what may well seem the most fantastic nonsense, the crazy
fictions of a diseased mind. And yet, for honesty's sake, I must
emphasize the fact that Cass told his story with such conviction that I
found myself, over and over again, half-believing it.</p>

<p>The solar flames, Cass affirmed, had made contact with more and more
minded stars and planets of very diverse characters and psychical
statures. And as they themselves advanced in spiritual growth, they
were able to communicate with worlds of more and more developed
consciousness. In the end they discovered that a great company of the
most "awakened" worlds had long ago established a cosmical community,
and that this community had itself "awakened" to a higher plane of
awareness. In this condition they "woke" to be a single mind, a
single-minded community of many diverse worlds. The solar mind itself,
after long and arduous initiation, was able to participate in this high
experience.</p>

<p>Apparently this initiation into the cosmical community took place at
a date somewhat earlier than the dawn of reptilian life on earth. From
that time forward, the chief concern of the solar flames was to play an
active part in the life of the single-minded cosmical community. And
this life was entirely devoted to extra-sensory and metaphysical study
of the ultimate reality. (So Cass affirmed. For my part, I doubt
whether there is really any sense in such a statement. I see no reason
to suppose that extrasensory experience can probe to ultimate reality;
and as for metaphysical study, it is nothing but a deceptive juggling
with words.) Cass said that all sufficiently awake individuals
throughout the cosmos, participating in the experience of the cosmical
mind, were passionately intent on effecting communion with some sort of
divine person, some god. I remember one of Cass's remarks. "The
cosmical mind," he said, "was alone, and in great need of love."
Apparently these age-long explorations had brought increasing evidence
of theism; or increasing awareness of something felt to be "the divine
presence"; or an increasing promise that some universal Lover would
presently be made known. In earlier ages the minded worlds had
carefully avoided any kind of metaphysical belief; so well was it
realized that finite intelligence was incapable of conceiving any deep
truth about reality. But under the influence of "the new promise," the
life of every individual in every awakened world was now orientated to
this bright star of certainty, or seeming certainty; of "doubt-less
faith," to use Cass's own words. The longing for the final culminating
revelation became a universal passion. In all the worlds, the hosts of
individual spirits waited with baited breath for the consummation of
the union of the cosmic mind with God, the hypercosmical Lover.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to Cass, the whole cosmical society had become
re-fashioned on a theocratic basis, under a priesthood consisting of
the most spiritually developed worlds. And also within each world
throughout the society, a priesthood ruled; not, of course by violence
or the threat of violence, but purely by the tacit threat of
excommunication from the singleminded experience of the cosmical
spirit. All these awakened worlds were so confident in the speedy
millennium, that all activities except religious ritual and
contemplation were gradually abandoned. Traditions of kindliness and
mutual aid degenerated. "After all," it was said, "the agonies of the
unfortunate will soon give place to bliss, so we need not worry about
them very much. And certainly we must not, to alleviate them, squander
energy which should be concentrated wholly on the attempt of the
cosmical spirit to come face to face with God as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Ages passed, and still the longed-for illumination and communion did
not occur.</p>

<p>Instead a different and a shattering discovery was made by the
cosmical mind; that is, of course, by all the awakened individuals
together in spiritual unity.</p>

<p>What this discovery was I find it very difficult to determine at all
precisely, and still more difficult to describe. This is not
surprising.</p>

<p>All I can say is that at a certain stage of cosmical history,
probably about the time of the first appearance of mammals on the
earth, the cosmical mind began to suspect that all the treasured
evidence for the existence of the Divine Lover, and the impending
consummation of the whole cosmical process, was false. "The cosmical
spirit," said Cass, "had cried out for love; and some kind of
seeming-response had come back to it, seemingly from the heart of
reality; but actually, this response was a mere echo of the cosmical
mind's own yearning. Having pressed through the mists of uncertainty,
confident that she would soon stand in the divine presence, she found
nothing more than her own spectre reflected from the confines of
existence."</p>

<p>It is easy to see that a society orientated toward a personal deity,
a god of love, and organized through and through as a theocracy, would
be rudely shaken by this discovery; the more so since all its members
believed in an actual and speedy union with their God.</p>

<p>But worse was to follow. In forlorn hope of reaching some deeper
truth, further exploration was undertaken. "Finally" (in Cass's words
so far as I can remember them) "the cosmical spirit came at last face
to face with stark reality. And stark it certainly turned out to be.
Reality, it seemed, was wholly alien to the spirit, and wholly
indifferent to the most sacred values of the awakened minds of the
cosmos. It was indeed the Wholly Other, and wholly unintelligible. It
seemed to be in some sense personal, or at least 'not less than
personal.' Indeed, it was probably infinitely more than personal. All
that could be said of it was that it comprised within itself the whole
mental and spiritual life of the cosmos, and also therewith a vast host
of other cosmical creations, differing from one another so profoundly
that between them there could be no comprehension whatever. To the
lofty Being who comprised them, all their aspirations were equally
trivial. To him (or it?) their function was not to manifest the life of
the spirit successfully, but simply to be aware, to feel, to strive in
their diverse ways, however unsuccessfully or perversely. Thereby, and
unwittingly, they provided his sustenance."</p>

<p>When I listened to Cass recounting this discovery in a tragic voice
I could not suppress a snigger. The thought that the sublime cosmical
mind should have been so prodigiously tricked by its own wishes as to
believe that its purposes were the purposes of God, and that it was on
the point of union with God, seemed to me quite funny. I shall not
forget the flash of rage and contempt with which Cass glanced at me
when he heard my inadequately suppressed snigger. "No doubt," he said,
"the cosmical mind had deceived itself, and its discomfiture was
deserved; but should creatures like us laugh over a huge spiritual
disaster on a cosmical scale, affecting the happiness of myriads of
sensitive beings?" Of course, I did see the tragic side of the
situation; but at the moment I was more impressed with the idea that so
lofty a being could be such a damned fool. The thought that any little
insect like myself, equipped with a modicum of free intelligence and
self-criticism, could have seen through the self- deceptions of the
cosmical mind was at once amusing and gratifying to my vanity. I had to
remind myself that, after all, there was no excuse for
self-complacency, for I was listening merely to the fantasies of a
deranged personality, not to an objective report of actual follies
committed by an actual cosmical mind.</p>

<p>But to continue the story as Cass gave it me. Naturally any society
that had been organized on a strictly theocratic basis for a whole
geological age would be thrown into confusion by the discovery that its
beliefs were baseless. In describing the disaster, Cass used a striking
image. "The cosmical society," he said, "was in the plight of a seal
that had been swimming far under the ice towards a distant blow-hole.
With heart throbbing and lungs straining, it arrives at last to find
that the hole is blocked with a staunch layer of fresh ice.
Desperately, vainly, it strikes at the prison window; then its lungs
collapse, and it loses consciousness."</p>

<p>Similarly the cosmical society, which had calculated on a speedy
emergence into the life-giving air of communion with God, now found
itself imprisoned. After a wild attempt to break through into a loftier
and more congenial reality, it soon collapsed. Henceforth, if I
understood Cass rightly, the unified cosmical mind ceased to exist.
There remained only the minds of individual worlds, such as that of the
solar flames, in telepathic contact with one another, but no longer
capable of unified consciousness as a single mind. And all were haunted
by the harsh memory of the tragic discovery. Moreover, each world was
itself in danger of disruption through internal conflict. For there
were now everywhere two parties in each world. One party doggedly
retained its faith, and ardently desired to press on with spiritual
research, in the belief, or rather the forlorn hope, that it would
break through to an even deeper truth. The other party wished to accept
the recent discovery as final, and to re-adjust the whole cosmical
social order on a purely epicurean basis.</p>

<p>On the sun, apparently, neither party succeeded in permanently
dominating the other. The result was chaos. Sometimes, for a few
thousand years at a time the faithful ruled, then the sceptics.
Sometimes there was an uneasy compromise. And sometimes the two parties
so far debased themselves as to invent and use methods of violence. War
was at last known on the sun.</p>

<p>When the terrestrial flames re-established contact with the sun,
they found the solar society in painful confusion. Warfare was being
attempted. But some sort of new party, I understand, had very recently
appeared. It claimed to offer an effective synthesis of the views of
the old parties. This new party, or sect, or what you will, professed
views much like those of the terrestrial flame whom Cass had murdered;
for they embraced both metaphysical agnosticism and loyalty to "the
spirit."</p>

<p>"We do not know, we do not know," they declared (or so Cass
asserted), "and probably no finite intelligence, even of cosmical
stature, can ever know, the ultimate truth. But we do not really need
to know. All that is needful is the perception, the indubitable
perception, of the spirits" over-mastering beauty; and the perceived
certainty that we are all by nature instruments of the spirit's
expression."</p>

<p>Cass quoted these words with fervour and obvious agreement. Indeed,
he presently announced that they had won his allegience to the new
party. To me, the compromise seems hopelessly confused and untenable,
but Cass took it very seriously. He said, "Intellectual integrity, my
dear man, is all very well; and it does compel us to be entirely
agnostic about the constitution of the universe. But emotional
integrity is just as important; and it compels me to be true to my
perception of the spirit." In this attitude, rather surprisingly, he
found himself out of sympathy with the latest views of the terrestrial
flames, who (he said) were at first thrown into chaos by all this
momentous news, but were now rapidly moving toward theism. Apparently
the majority took the view that, though hitherto they had
<i>consciously</i> rejected belief in a God of any kind, yet
<i>unconsciously</i> they had all along drawn their passion for the
spirit from a deep unwitting recognition that a divine cosmical person
must, in fact, exist. They were now convinced that, if only they could
wake more fully, they would come face to face with him, and see in him
the spirit's source of authority. Cass, however, clung to the earlier
attitude of the terrestrial flames, their seemingly agnostic devotion
to the spirit. He was therefore determined to use every possible means
of making contact between the terrestrial flames and human scientists,
reckoning that each might modify the other's attitude, and that the
upshot might well be a triumph of the agnostic faith both among the
flame race and among mankind.</p>

<p>With this end in view he urged me to co-operate with him by telling
my brother scientists all about the flames, both in conversation and in
articles in scientific journals. I must also, he repeated, stop the
publication of his former statement, and arrange to substitute the new
book, which he was now writing.</p>

<p>He was extremely reproachful when I refused to do what I was told.
Indeed, so upset was he that I decided to humour him. I pointed out
that I had never so much as seen one of the living flames myself. I
would, therefore, while thinking over his proposal, undertake a little
private research. Meanwhile, I said, he had better carry on with his
new book. He reluctantly agreed to this plan, and we parted on friendly
terms.</p>

<p>After that interview with Cass my conscience compelled me actually
to set about looking for evidence of the flames' existence. I stared
into a few kitchen fires, and even took the trouble to go and see a
couple of industrial furnaces. Of course, I found nothing, and my
conscientiousness petered out.</p>

<p>After some weeks I received a note from Cass, telling me that he was
trying to write his book, but that the terrestrial flames were
constantly attempting to convert him to their theistic religion. The
more he resisted the more they persecuted him. "The situation," he
said, "is growing desperate. They are trying to undermine my sanity,
and if I resist this threat, they will probably kill me." After this I
heard nothing from him, and I was too busy to visit him.</p>

<p>Some three months later I received a letter from the chief of the
Mental Home saying that Cass was dead. There had been a serious fire at
the Home, and it had started in Cass's room. The cause of the blaze was
unknown. Latterly Cass had become far more deranged, and had made
remarks which suggested that he might be contemplating arson. He was
therefore deprived of matches and his lighter, and it was difficult to
see how he could have started the fire, unless by focussing the sun's
rays through a large reading lens which was found in his room.</p>

<p>I leave the reader to solve the puzzle of Cass's end. If there had
been a hearth-fire in his room, conceivably a living flame might have
leapt from it to destroy him. But what am I saying! For the moment I
had forgotten that the flames were merely figments in his mind. On the
whole, my theory is that, with the progress of his disorder, his sense
of persecution by the terrestrial flames drove him to despair, so that
in the end he chose to die. Or did his confused mind suppose that by
focussing the sun's rays he would somehow introduce into his room an
actual living solar flame friendly to his views? It is impossible to
solve the problem.</p>

<p>After Cass's death I decided that I would publish his original
statement intact, in spite of his wish to withdraw it. It is too
interesting, psychologically, to be sacrificed. And in this epilogue I
have made it clear that Cass's final attitude was very different from
his earlier hostility to the flames. In taking this course, I feel that
I am being loyal to Cass himself, to the real Cass, the sane, though
brilliant, scientist, who would suppress no evidence that might lead to
the advancement of knowledge.</p>
