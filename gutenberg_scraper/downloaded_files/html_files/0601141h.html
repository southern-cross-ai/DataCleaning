<h1>NORTHMOST AUSTRALIA</h1>
<h2>VOLUME I</h2>
<hr align="center" width="60%">
<h3><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER I</h3>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>The Cape York Peninsula, forming, as it does, the link binding the two great
islands of Australia and New Guinea, is necessarily of the highest importance
from a geological, ethnological, zoological, botanical, historical, political
and strategical point of view.</p>
<p>It so happens that the Peninsula is the first part of Australia to which
authentic written history refers. On the earliest landing of Europeans there
arose the complex questions which obtrude themselves whenever civilisation
comes into contact with barbarism.</p>
<p>My practical interest in the Peninsula began with a tour made in 1879 in the
course of my Geological Survey work. On my way to the recently rushed and still
more recently abandoned "Coen" gold diggings, I crossed the base of the then
almost unknown Cape Melville Peninsula, where I found indications of auriferous
country, and also the rivers south of Princess Charlotte Bay, down which the
unfortunate explorer Kennedy had struggled in vain to keep his appointment with
the relief ship twenty-two years earlier. From the Coen, I was only able to
push out to the north for a period inexorably limited by the condition of my
horses and the quantity of food remaining in my saddle-bags. Even under these
conditions, however, I penetrated for some distance into the McIlwraith Range,
and on the heads of the river which I named the Peach (unaware that it was the
river named the Archer by the Brothers Jardine, who crossed it near its mouth)
I found widespread evidence of the presence of gold and tin.</p>
<p>From the Laura Telegraph Office, from Cooktown, and ultimately from my
headquarters at Townsville, I made such communications as were possible in
anticipation of a complete report to the head of the Department of Mines, which
administered the Geological Survey.</p>
<p>My individual impression was that the reefs in the district traversed were
of more importance than the alluvial gold, but there had been neither means nor
time at my disposal to enable me to satisfy myself of the value of either, and
this view I duly represented in my correspondence with the Department.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 2}</u></p>
<p>The desire of the Government, and of the eager diggers throughout
Queensland, was to discover an alluvial goldfield on the pattern of the Palmer,
which was by that time approaching exhaustion.</p>
<p>A party of miners, headed by James Crosbie, volunteered to go and settle the
question of the existence of payable alluvial gold, and they asked for and
obtained government assistance, and I was instructed to lead them to the spot.
In addition, a prospecting party was equipped, with money subscribed in
Cook-town, and sent out to anticipate the expedition subsidised by the
Government.</p>
<p>The combined geological and prospecting parties left Cooktown on 26th
November, 1879, and striking out from the "bend of the Kennedy" on the
Cooktown-Palmerville road, reached the "Peach" (Archer) River on 20th December.
The prospectors commenced operations at once, and were rewarded with
"prospects" which led them into the jungle-clad recesses of the McIlwraith
Range. Here, to their disappointment, although prospects were obtained here and
there, the creeks and gullies were found to run over almost bare rocks, their
beds being too steep for the retention of any quantity of alluvial "washdirt."
On 30th December, the wet season set in. For the remainder of our time in the
field, the creeks were too swollen for the "bottom" to be reached where there
was any washdirt at all, or the ground was too sodden to carry our horses.
There were long and vexatious delays when it was neither possible to work nor
to travel. Nevertheless, we continued, during breaks in the bad weather, to
cross the McIlwraith Range and touch the Macrossan Range. Regaining the summit
of the McIlwraith Range, we followed it to its northern extremity, where the
valley of the Pascoe River separates it from the mountain mass which we named
the Janet Range. It was found that the Pascoe River bounds the Janet Range on
the south and east, and we practically followed it down till we had finally to
cross it where it took an easterly course towards the Pacific. We had already
made up our minds that it was safer to chance the unknown in the north than to
return to Cooktown across several great rivers, now all certain to be flooded.
No sooner had we left the Pascoe than we entered on the Bad Lands or Wet Desert
of "heath" and "scrub" without anything for horses to live on. From the Pascoe
to the Escape River, our course must have coincided in many places with
Kennedy's on his "forlorn hope" journey, and we repeated many of his
experiences, as told by his surviving companion Jackey-Jackey, but happily not
the series of disasters which resulted in his own death and the disasters which
overtook the two parties he left behind to await the relief he went to bring.
The natives displayed in our case, as in Kennedy's, a persistent hostility
which hampered our</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 3}</u></p>
<p>movements and partially incapacitated me during the final stages of the
journey. Horses died of starvation or poison, and the men of the party were
running perilously short of food&mdash;the journey having been prolonged beyond
our calculations&mdash;when we reached Somerset on 3rd April, 1880.</p>
<p>Kennedy's maps and journals (1848) perished with him, and what we know of
his expedition is taken (as far north as the Pascoe River) from the narrative
written by William Carron, one of the three survivors, and (north of the
Pascoe) from the "statement" of the black boy Jackey-Jackey, another of the
survivors and the only one of the thirteen men to make the complete journey
from Rockingham Bay to Somerset. The Geological and Prospecting Party's
<i>route</i> only coincided for a short distance, from the head of the Jardine
River to its westward bend, with that of the Jardine Brothers (1865). Day after
day, during the whole of my journey, I was mapping the mountain ranges, rivers
and other features of the country, checking my latitudes by star-observations
whenever the night sky was clear enough, and as far as charting was concerned
we were in virgin ground.</p>
<p>My report on the two expeditions was completed at my Townsville office in
the winter of 1880 and sent to the Minister for Mines, Brisbane, with the
relative map, which had taken a good deal of time, subject to interruptions by
other duties. The report was printed and officially issued on 14th September,
1881, without my having had any opportunity of seeing it through the press, and
to my astonishment the map&mdash;which might have been supposed to be of the
first importance&mdash;was omitted. What became of the map and of my office
copy will be seen in <a href="#ch57">Chapter LXVII.</a></p>
<p>After the map had reached Brisbane and before my report was published, my
map had been reduced to a smaller scale and embodied in official maps issued by
the Department of Lands. In that form, however, my charting was open, in parts,
to an interpretation which I could never have sanctioned.</p>
<p>In 1913, when.I had been out of the government service for about fourteen
years, and when for the first time some degree of leisure had begun to fall to
my share, I commenced to prepare a revised and corrected issue of the report,
with its map reconstructed from my notes, with the intention of offering it to
the Government for republication (the report itself having been long out of
print). Some progress had been made when my friend James Dick, of Cooktown,
sent me proofs of a pamphlet in which he proposed to summarise the narrative of
the Geological and Prospecting Expeditions. When I had gone over the proofs,
correcting them only in so far as statements of fact were concerned, I fully
realised how misleading my original narrative must have been, misprinted as it
was, and unaccompanied by the map which</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 4}</u></p>
<p>formed its most essential part. I resumed my task with renewed vigour, and
with a wider scope, and Mr. Dick, up to the date of his death, assisted me in
many ways through his local and personal knowledge, happily of more recent date
than mine. I am grateful to his memory, and am conscious that he was, in a
sense, "the only begetter of these ensuing lines."</p>
<p>Between 1880 and 1913, a great deal of charting of the interior had been
accomplished by the Departments of Lands and Mines, although even now that work
is incomplete. The new lines gave me, when I was recharting the lost map, an
opportunity of correcting my sketching to correspond with actual surveys.</p>
<p>The first lesson to force itself upon me was that my estimates of distances
covered had been influenced by fatigue or difficulties on the one hand (leading
to over-estimation) or by good-going and good-feeding for the horses on the
other (leading to underestimation).</p>
<p>The second lesson was that, even in the direction of my course, I had in
many instances strayed to the right or left, as a ship may steer a definite
course and yet make leeway owing to the pressure of forces incorrectly
estimated, or even not recognised. In short, the personal equation had to be
introduced and allowed for before I could hope to reconcile my supposed with my
actual position on any given date.</p>
<p>Long before I had finished the revision of my own narrative, it had become
evident that its significance could not be fully understood without a critical
study of the diaries of explorers who had gone before me and whose paths I had
crossed from time to time. This led me back from Mulligan to Leichhardt, and as
one by one the writings of honoured pioneers came under my review, I subjected
them to the tests already applied to my own, and to the best of my ability
substituted where the writers were for where they thought they were, and made
the necessary allowances and corrections. Then it seemed that the story might
as well be continued to the present date by the addition of the developments
which have taken place since 1880 through the instrumentality of surveyors,
explorers and prospectors. Some of the actors are, happily, still alive, and
these have rendered material assistance by the contribution of original matter.
Among these are Webb, Bradford, Paterson and Embley. To the last-named
gentleman, especially, I am indebted for assistance rendered doubly valuable by
his prolonged residence in the Peninsula, and which, in some parts of the work,
almost amounted to collaboration.</p>
<p>While dealing with land explorers it was borne in upon me that they owed
some of their difficulties and many of their errors to an imperfect
comprehension of the work of earlier maritime explorers. They were not, indeed,
to be blamed for this, as in few instances could they have perused the
narratives or seen the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 5}</u></p>
<p>charts of the sea-adventurers. As it was, the Dutch sailors named "reviers,"
or inlets, on the Gulf coast, and subsequent explorers of the interior, almost
without exception, made bad guesses at the connection of their rivers with the
inlets on the coast line. I do not propose any reform so drastic as to restore
their original names to the western rivers of the Peninsula, but content
myself, after years of research, with distinguishing the original, or right, or
<i>de jure</i> names from the <i>de facto</i> names, the product of pardonable
misidentifications sanctioned, in many cases, by half a century of popular and
official usage. I have, I hope, succeeded in making it clear that, in many
instances, the <i>de facto</i> names are in reality not those bestowed by the
earliest explorers, but rather what are called "complimentary" names.</p>
<p>From the preceding explanation, it will be understood that this work began,
so to speak, in the middle, and followed lines dictated by the questions which
arose during its progress. It was ultimately realised that it would be
advisable to arrange it in chronological order, so that the tale told by each
explorer might be compared with the facts ascertained by his predecessors and
at the same time be complete in itself. Of no less importance was the
consideration of precisely how much knowledge each explorer had of the
achievements of his predecessors; and this point has exacted very careful
study. I am forced to the conclusion that in most instances the later explorers
knew very little about their predecessors, having taken what little they knew
at second hand and without having had access to important documents, some of
which, indeed, only came to light after their own time.</p>
<p>While aiming at chronological order, it must be conceded that it is not
always possible to observe it strictly. It may be that the stories of two
observers overlap; or a statement may demand historical investigation into the
past; or, again, it may be convenient at once to trace the outcome of a newly
discovered fact downwards to the present time. Hence a certain amount of
repetition is inevitable, as facts or statements are viewed by one observer
after another from a different angle.</p>
<p>It is impossible to define the exact base of the Cape York Peninsula, and in
writing of it one must occasionally follow its pioneers beyond its southern
boundary, however liberal or elastic the definition of the latter may be. The
historian of France needs no excuse for referring to happenings in Germany or
Italy. In a parallel way, what was commenced as a history of the Cape York
Peninsula has come to include Torres Strait, the "Gulf" country west to the
boundary of Queensland and the Pacific country as far south as Bowen.</p>

<p>A mass of vague and fragmentary evidence points to the conclusion that by
the middle of the sixteenth century Spanish and Portuguese navigators had
become aware that New Guinea was separated by a strait from a continent lying
to the south. The knowledge was, however, jealously guarded. A significant
passage occurs in an English edition, published in Louvain in 1597, of CORNELIS
WYTFLIET'S <i>Descriptionis Ptolemicae Augmentum</i> (1597):</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The Australis Terra is the most southern of all
lands. It is separated from New Guinea by a narrow strait. Its shores are
hitherto but little known, since, after one voyage and another, that
<i>route</i> has been deserted, and seldom is the country visited, unless when
sailors are driven there by storms. The Australis Terra begins at two or three
degrees from the equator, and is maintained by some to be of so great an extent
that, if it were thoroughly explored, it would be regarded as a fifth part of
the world." <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<p>The inference, as pointed out by Collingridge, is inevitable that Wytfliet
referred to sources of information other than Dutch.</p>
<p>Collingridge adduces <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> reasonable support for
his contention that the western coast of Australia had been "charted".
(although the word "sketched" might be more appropriate) by the Portuguese</p>
<blockquote>[1) Collingridge, <i>Discovery of Australia</i>, p.
219.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) British Association for the Advancement of Science: Sydney
meeting, 1914. See also his work, <i>The Discovery of Australia</i>, Sydney,
1895, p. 172, where the "Dauphin Chart," dated 1530-1536, is
reproduced.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 7}</u></p>
<p>and the eastern coast by the Spanish prior to the year 1530. In the DAUPHIN
CHART, on which this conjecture is founded, the point identified as Cape York
is, however, not depicted, as it really is, south of New Guinea, but as lying
west of Timor and in the latitude of the north coast of Java. The supposed Gulf
of Carpentaria has for its western limit the eastern end of Java, and from its
south-western corner what may be called a strait or channel, or still more
correctly a canal, runs westward between "Jave" on the north and "Jave la
Grande," or Australia, on the south. The supposed Gulf of Carpentaria is,
according to the map, interrupted by a few islands, and on it is written, in
the Portuguese language, the legend "Anda ne Barcha" (no ships come
here).<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Collingridge conjectures that the French
compiler of the map, ignorant of Portuguese, copied this legend from an older
Portuguese map, under the impression that it was the name of the Gulf or of the
group of islands.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century, the islands between Asia and Australia came to be
well known to European adventurers. In 1512, Portugal took possession of the
Molucca group, the centre of the "Spice Islands," and this possession speedily
grew to great commercial importance and passed into the hands of Spain.
Magelhaen "discovered" the Philippines in 1520 and Spain annexed them fifty
years later. Meantime the Dutch and the English were on the alert and looking
for a foothold.</p>
<p>As far back as July, 1493, a BULL OF POPE ALEXANDER VI had fixed a north and
south line of demarcation between the claims of Portugal and Spain to future
discoveries. Portugal was to occupy the hemisphere to the east and Spain the
hemisphere to the west of that line, which was placed 100 leagues (5&deg;
43')<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> west of the Azores and Cape Verde Islands.
The generosity of the Pope was no doubt fully appreciated by the two
beneficiaries, but the line was not quite satisfactory to either of them;
besides, it was ill-defined, because some six degrees of longitude extend
between the westmost Azores and the eastmost Cape Verdes. A private arrangement
or treaty was therefore made on 4th June, 1494, by Don Juan II of Portugal on
the one hand and Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain on the other, whereby it was
agreed that the line should run 370 leagues (21&deg; 9') west of the Cape Verde
Islands.</p>
<p>Assuming 25&deg; W. to be the mean longitude of the Azores and Cape Verde
Islands, the bull of 1493 bisected the globe by the meridians of 40&deg; 43' W.
and 149&deg; 17' E., the latter meridian giving to Portugal the islands of the
Pacific west of the eastmost cape of New Guinea and to Spain all those east of
that cape. The treaty</p>
<blockquote>[1) The equivalent of the phrase in modern Spanish, <i>viz.</i>
"Barcas no andan," differs so little from the Portuguese that some hesitation
may be felt in settling the question on the sole evidence of language. Blank
ignorance of Portuguese on the part of a French cartographer is rather a bold
assumption. The most genuinely learned men of these days were to be found among
the compilers of maps.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) 17&frac12; Spanish leagues= 1 geographical
degree.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 8}</u></p>
<p>of 1494 cut through the globe by the meridians of 46&deg; 9' W. and 133&deg;
51' E.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that COLUMBUS had just discovered the West Indian
Islands a year before the issue of the papal bull. The mainland of America was
discovered in 1497 by SEBASTIAN CABOT, a Venetian in the service of Henry VII
of England. Then the passage of the SPANISH MAIN, the sphere of influence
granted to Spain, became, for Europe, a question of very practical politics,
over which much blood was to be shed, as other nations claimed the freedom of
the sea. It was not till 1588 that the question was settled by the decisive
defeat of the Spanish armada by the English fleet.</p>
<p>Had the nations outside of Spain and Portugal admitted the validity of the
bull, the greater part of Australia would have belonged to Portugal, and a
slice of the eastern coast, covering Sydney, Brisbane and Rockhampton, would
have been Spanish. By the treaty (which was a sort of reciprocal Monroe
doctrine), the western half of Australia would have been Portuguese and the
eastern half Spanish.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that no other maritime powers ever assented to the
partition between Spain and Portugal of all lands to be discovered in the
future. The title of the two Powers was soon to be disputed by the rising
maritime nations England and Holland. Moreover, the definition of the treaty
line in the Pacific raised, between Spain and Portugal themselves, questions
which brought them to the verge of war.</p>
<p>Here,then,was an excellent reason why Spaniards and Portuguese should
preserve secrecy or practise deceit regarding the location of discoveries in
the vicinity of the boundary line, whether by bull or treaty. The interest of a
Portuguese tempted him, sometimes beyond his strength, to place his discovery
west, while a Spaniard was tempted to place his discovery east of the boundary
line in the Pacific. Secret instructions must have been issued to navigators by
the authorities of both countries, in consequence of which they would
systematically misrepresent their longitudes, and the truth would be arrived at
by the authorities on reading the reports and charts with the aid of a
"key."</p>
<p>Granting that the "Dauphin Chart" was compiled in parts from Spanish or
Portuguese originals and that the land shown to the south of Java really
represents the northern portion of Australia, which was already, early in the
sixteenth century, vaguely known to both Spanish and Portuguese, the
westward-moving of the new continent was clearly in the interest of Portugal,
and the warning or danger signal "ships do not (or cannot or must not) come
here"&mdash;in other words, "not navigable"&mdash;was clearly a "bluff." It
was, therefore, probably a Portuguese map which was drawn upon for the
information given in the Dauphin chart.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 9}</u></p>
<p><b>MAGELHAEN AND CANO</b></p>
<p>MAGELHAEN, a Portuguese who had taken service with Spain, set out with five
vessels from Luzar on 10th September, 1519. After passing through the strait
which now bears his name, he reached the Philippine Islands, where he was
killed by the natives. Only one ship of his squadron returned to Europe,
<i>via</i> the Cape of Good Hope, carrying eighteen persons, all very sick.
This ship was the "<i>Victoria</i>," Captain Juan Sebastian del CANO. The
"<i>Victoria</i>" sailed <i>via</i> the Moluccas to Timor. Thence she must have
gone south-westward till "certain islands" were discovered under the tropic of
Capricorn. As this land, according to Cano, was only 100 leagues (5&deg; 43')
from Timor, it is more likely to have been the continent of Australia
(somewhere between Onslow and Carnarvon, Western Australia) than Madagascar, as
has been assumed by some writers. Whether Cano actually landed here is
uncertain, but it may be taken for granted that in these days no ship could
afford to neglect an opportunity of landing for the purpose of taking in
water.</p>
<p><b>TORRES</b></p>
<p>A Spanish expedition under ALVARO MENDANA DE MEYRA, with PEDRO FERNANDEZ DE
QUIROS as second in command, sailed from Callao on 9th April, 1595, and
discovered the island of SANTA CRUZ (lat. 11&deg; S., long. 166&deg; E.), where
an attempt was made to establish a colony. The result was a disastrous failure,
and Mendana's death took place soon after. WYTFLIET'S MAP (1597<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b>) shows, in the same latitude as the southmost Solomon
Islands (10&deg; S.), a strait dividing Nova Guinea and Terra Australis, and
this is actually the latitude of Torres Strait. The map has a note stating that
TERRA AUSTRALIS is "SEPARATED FROM NEW GUINEA by a narrow strait. Its shores
are hitherto but little known, since, after one voyage and another, that
<i>route</i> has been deserted, and seldom is the country visited unless when
sailors are driven there by storms." In this harmless statement, there is
surely no ground for Collingridge's accusation of fraud on the part of the
Dutch, or of a desire to filch the credit of the discovery of the strait.
Collingridge adduces a good many fragments of evidence that both the Spanish
and the Dutch were well aware of the existence of the strait before the end of
the sixteenth century, but after Wytfliet's admission there was a growing
tendency on the part of the Dutch to deny the existence of such a strait, and
several failures on their part to verify it only strengthened this doubt. They
doubted more and more until the question was finally settled by Cook in
1770.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>The Discovery of Australia</i>, by George Collingridge, 4to,
Sydney, 1895, p. 218.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 10}</u></p>
<p>That the strait was known to Spaniards early in the seventeenth century is
proved by a remarkable document, dating from somewhere between 1614 and 1621.
This is a MEMORIAL which DR. JEAN LUIS ARIAS, a lawyer in Chili, writing on
behalf of a number of priests, addressed to King Philip III, urging more
vigorous exploration, on humanitarian and religious grounds. NEW GUINEA is
referred to in it as "a Country ENCOMPASSED WITH WATER."</p>
<p>QUIROS, who persisted for years in urging the colonisation of Santa Cruz and
the further exploration of the South Land, was at last given the command of an
expedition, which left CALLAO, Peru, on 21st December, 1605. He hoisted his
flag on the "<i>San Pedro y San Pablo</i>" (usually referred to in narratives
as "<i>El Capitano</i>," or the Flagship), with, as his Captain or Chief Pilot,
JUAN OCHAO DE BILBAHO. This officer was not a man of his own choice, but was
forced upon him by the Viceroy at Lima, whose relative and
<i>proteg&eacute;</i> he was. In the course of the voyage he was disrated and
replaced by the Junior Pilot GASPAR GONZALEZ DE LEZA. TORRES commanded the
"<i>San Pedro</i>" (usually called, "for short," the "<i>Almirante</i>," or
Lieutenant's ship). A zabra, or tender, named the "<i>Tres Reyes</i>," was in
charge of PEDRO BERNAL CERME&Ntilde;O.</p>
<p>The flagship parted company with her consorts at the island of Espiritu
Santo, and thereafter the two fragments of the expedition pursued separate
courses. It is only with the section commanded by TORRES that the historian of
the Cape York Peninsula is directly concerned, but the full significance of
Torres' voyage cannot be correctly estimated without some consideration of the
events which preceded the separation.</p>
<p>Quiros and Torres were among the last of Spain's navigators of the first
order: by the time their expedition set out, Spain's influence in the Pacific
was on the wane. The records of their experiences met with the usual fate of
such documents. In accordance with what had become almost a matter of routine,
they were at first jealously kept secret. Pigeon-holed, they were in due time
forgotten, only to be unearthed, piece by piece, through the diligence of
patriots, politicians and historians. In reviewing the progress of discovery
subsequent to Quiros and Torres, it is necessary to remind ourselves that at
any given date the information available was limited to such documents as had
come to light, and the problems confronting new explorers were not at all those
which would have been before them had they been fully aware of what had already
been done. It may be confidently asserted that had the various reports of
Quiros and Torres been given to the world in their true chronological order,
the course of history would have differed widely from what it has been. Up to
comparatively recent times the achievements of Quiros were only known at second
hand, and chiefly through the meagre references by Torres, Arias and</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 11}</u></p>
<p>Torquemada. It was only in 1876 that the text of QUIROS' VOYAGE was given to
the world by JUSTO ZARAGOZA, whereupon clouds of tradition and misconception
were dispelled. Practically the whole of the Quiros documents have been
skilfully marshalled by the late SIR CLEMENTS MARKHAM for the Hakluyt Society
in the two volumes published in 1904. The chief items in the QuirosTorres
bibliography are enumerated in the footnote.<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>On leaving Callao, the expedition steered WSW. into 26&deg; south latitude,
somewhere in the vicinity of Easter Island, when, from considerations of the
lateness of the season and other reasons, Quiros turned his ships towards WNW.
His original intention had clearly been to go much further south, as may be
seen from the text of his directions to Torres:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"You are to be very diligent, both by day and night,
in following the '<i>Capitano</i>' ship, which will shape a WSW. course until
the latitude of 30&deg; is reached, and when that is reached, and no land has
been seen, the course will be altered to NW. until the latitude of 10&deg; 15';
and if no land has yet been found, a course will be followed on that parallel
to the west in search of the Island of Santa Cruz. There a port will be sought
in the bay of Graciosa, in 10&deg; of latitude and 1,850 leagues from the city
of The Kings [Lima] to the South of a great and lofty volcano standing alone in
the sea, about 8 leagues from the said bay. The Captain who arrives first in

<p>Much confusion has arisen, and much speculation has been indulged in, owing
to a doubt as to the correct interpretation of references by Torres to the
"prescribed latitude." The general and very natural impression has hitherto
been that Quiros was under orders not to turn north until he had reached a
certain southern latitude, the precise situation of which he and Torres were
ordered to keep secret.</p>
<p>The narrative of Bermudez (as the mouthpiece of Quiros), only recently given
to the world, proves conclusively that there was no mystery and no intentional
concealment. Quiros, as a matter of fact, received no orders from Spain, and
the valedictory epistle of the Governor of Peru did not restrict his
discretionary powers.</p>
<p>The expedition was manned by 130 seafarers and six priests. The flagship and
the "<i>Almirante</i>" were vessels of 150 and 120 tons respectively.</p>
<p>QUIROS had barely gone to sea when he began to be ill, and he was more or
less of an invalid during the whole of the voyage. From the occasional
references to headaches and other symptoms, a layman would conjecture that he
had got a "touch of the sun" at Lima. At all events, he was frequently too ill
to take his proper place of command and was under the necessity of leaving to
subordinates many decisions which were among his own obvious duties. The
narrative (written, it must be remembered, by a faithful admirer) na&iuml;vely
shows him to have been by turn querulous, weak, timid and vacillating, although
ever honestly and even zealously solicitous for the glory of his God and the
advantage of his King. His sentiments, as reported by Bermudez, were humane,
honourable and far ahead of his time, and I do not think they were cant, such
as flowed readily enough from the pens of some previous and contemporary
navigators. His shortcomings may charitably, and I think justly, be set down as
symptoms of his malady.</p>
<p>The too early abandonment of the initial WSW. course was unfortunate for
Quiros, who, had he persevered, would probably have anticipated Tasman's
discovery of New Zealand. Torres protested against it and endeavoured to induce
Quiros to carry out his original intention of touching 30&deg; S. before
"diminishing his latitude," but to no purpose.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 13}</u></p>
<p>There is reason to believe that Quiros was influenced in his decision to
steer WNW. no less by the insubordinate, if not mutinous, conduct of a section
of his crew than by the lateness of the season. Probably enough, with a
commander of greater firmness, the ugly word "mutiny" would never have been
heard.</p>
<p>Having reached, approximately, the latitude of 10&deg; S., the expedition
steered west for VERA CRUZ, driven by the imperative need for fresh water and
firewood. These requisites, however, were obtained at an island named TOUMACO,
and the project of making for Vera Cruz was abandoned.</p>
<p>By this time, the INSUBORDINATION on the flagship had to be dealt with. The
ringleader was the Chief Pilot, or Captain, JUAN OCHOA DE BILBAHO, for whom
Quiros considered that a sufficient punishment was to be relieved of his office
and sent on board the "<i>Almirante</i>"&mdash;a proceeding which was perhaps a
little hard on Torres. Ochoa was replaced by GASPAR GONZALEZ DE LEZA, Junior
Pilot.</p>
<p>A bitterly spiteful enemy of Quiros, and necessarily a supporter of the
disrated Captain, was DIEGO DE PRADO Y TOBAR, who, according to his own
account, voluntarily accompanied Ochoa and boarded the "<i>Almirante</i>" at
Toumaco. In allowing an officer of the flagship t0 desert openly and to side
with a degraded malcontent, it seems to me that Quiros displayed a weakness
which was most reprehensible, unless it was to be pardoned as a "symptom" of
his illness. Be this as it may, we owe to the desertion of Prado, as will
afterwards appear, a much fuller knowledge of Torres' subsequent proceedings
than we should have had if Prado had not accompanied Torres for the remainder
of the expedition. In the letters already referred to, Prado states that: "I
went as Captain of the ship <i>Capitano</i>,' knew what took place on board and
took part in it, and as it was not in conformity with the good of Your
Majesty's Service, I could not stay. So I disembarked at Toumaco and went to
the <i>Almirante</i>,' where I was well received." The assertion that he was
Captain is sheer impudence, as there can be no question that the Captain was
Ochoa. Prado was perhaps a mate" of some sort, and the sailing of the ship may
at some time have temporarily devolved upon him in the course of duty, but
beyond this there was never any justification for his claim. His version of the
story is that he gave Quiros timely warning of the mutinous disposition of the
"<i>Capitano's</i>" officers and crew, and he insinuates that Quiros either did
not believe him or stood so much in fear of the malcontents that he made things
so unpleasant that he (Prado) was glad to exchange into the
"<i>Almirante</i>."</p>
<p>At Toumaco, the natives were understood to say that large lands (which, of
course, might prove to be the desired South Land) lay to the south, and the
course was changed accordingly. In latitude 15&deg; 40' S. and longitude
176&deg; E., the promised land</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 14}</u></p>
<p>seemed to have been reached at last, on 30th April, 1606. Good harbourage
was afforded by the GRAN BAYA DE SAN FELIPE Y SANTIAGO (Saints Philip and
James), otherwise the Port of VERA CRUZ (True Cross), thus going one better
than Mendano with his Santa Cruz (Holy Cross). On the banks of the JORDAN
RIVER, at the head of the bay, the site for the great colonial city, the NEW
JERUSALEM was selected. The country was at first called the Land of ESPIRITU
SANTO (Holy Ghost), but as Quiros became convinced that it was part of the
great Southern Continent, he expanded the title to AUSTRALIA DEL ESPIRITU
SANTO, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and took formal possession, in the name
of his Sovereign, of "all lands then seen, and still to be seen, as far as the
South Pole." The grandiose names bestowed illustrate not only the innate piety
but also the weakness for superlatives which characterised the Spaniard of the
seventeenth century.</p>
<p>It has been argued (e.g., by the late Cardinal Moran) that Quiros, with
three ships under his command, could not have spent five weeks at the Island of
Santo without discovering that it was no part of a continent. The fact remains
that he did believe it to be continental, although from the first Torres did
not agree with him. Quiros approached the island predisposed to believe as he
did. The elaborate ceremony which marked his stay, including the nomination of
municipal officers, the erection of a votive church and the inauguration of an
order of Knighthood of the Holy Ghost, sufficiently attested the sincerity of
his belief. The ceremonies and the hopes to which they testified were, indeed,
as Sir Clements Markham observed, in the light of our present knowledge, not a
little pathetic.</p>
<p>In after years the conviction obsessed him, till he besought his King and
the world to believe that he had added to the Spanish Crown a territory of
hardly less importance than that gained by the discoveries of Columbus. He
died, broken-hearted, shouting this belief into deaf ears.</p>
<p>The argument that Quiros had time enough to ascertain that Santo was an
island is sufficiently answered by the fact now clearly discernible from the
narrative of Bermudez, that the exploration which took place during the five
weeks was confined to the "Gran Baya" and its environs, and that Quiros, in the
flagship, was never outside of the bay until the day when he finally departed
from it, to be driven out of sight of land and separated from his two consorts.
Unexpected confirmation of this fact is supplied by the CHART OF THE GRAN BAYA
(brought to light as recently as 1878) signed by PRADO, which shows so many
anchorages inside the bay that it may easily be believed they account for as
many of the</p>
<blockquote>[1) Markham supports the view that the name should read&mdash;as it
sometimes does, spelling in the seventeenth century being
capricious&mdash;Austrialia, a claim to Austria being signified in one of the
titles of the King of Spain.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 15}</u></p>
<p>thirty-five days as were not spent ashore. The chart, whether the credit of
the surveying or only of the draughtsmanship belongs to Prado, agrees so well
with modern Admiralty Charts of that portion of the island, that there can be
no question of the accuracy of Captain Cook's identification&mdash;made, of
course, without the assistance of Prado's Chart, which, in 1770, lay unknown in
the Spanish archives.</p>
<p>Sir Clements Markham, for many years President of the Royal Geographical
Society, had no difficulty in admitting the honesty of Quiros' belief that he
had discovered the southern land, and wrote of his approach to the Island of
Espiritu Santo:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Island after island, all lofty and thickly
inhabited, rose upon the horizon, and at last he sighted such extensive
coast-lines that he believed the Southern Continent to be spread out before
him. The islands of the New Hebrides Group, such as Aurora, Leper, and
Pentecost, overlapping each other to the south-east, seemed to him to be
continuous coast-lines, while to the south-west was the land which he named
Austrialia del Espiritu Santo. All appeared to his vivid imagination to be one
continuous continental land."</blockquote>
<p>The expedition, as has been mentioned, remained in the Bay of Saints Philip
and James for thirty-five days, <i>viz.</i>, from 3rd May to 8th June, 1606,
the numerous anchorages laid down on Prado's chart showing how thoroughly the
shores must have been examined. The sailors made themselves very much at home
and behaved with such arrogance, cruelty and rapacity that the natives treated
them with well-merited hostility, and although Quiros "deplored" such excesses,
he seems to have taken no suitable steps to stop them, beyond formally
prohibiting profane swearing and other unseemly practices. It is noteworthy
that the outrageous conduct of Prado was so far condoned that he figured in the
list of officers of the municipality of the New Jerusalem as Depositario
General. This term is translated by Markham as "General Storekeeper," but in my
opinion, the fact that Prado carried off with him, among other things, the
manuscript, or at least a copy, of the new chart of the bay and its environs,
favours the view that the office held by him was the more responsible one of
receiver or recorder.</p>
<p>The three vessels left the bay on 8th June, presumably with the intention of
coasting along the continent to the north-west, or, should Espiritu Santo prove
to be a cape, of running south-west to 20&deg; S. north-west to 4&deg;, and
west on that parallel to the coast of New Guinea, given an open sea, in
accordance with the spirit of the instructions given to Torres for his guidance
in the event of a separation. As soon, however, as they cleared the cape which
formed the north-western horn of the bay, they met with a strong wind from the
south-east and endeavoured to get back into the bay for shelter. In this
attempt the "<i>Almirante</i>" and the <i>tender</i> succeeded, but the
FLAGSHIP was blown further and further to</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 16}</u></p>
<p>leeward and in the morning succeeding the first night was out of sight of
land and hopelessly SEPARATED FROM HER CONSORTS. Quiros</p>
<p>himself was "below," too ill to direct the conduct of his vessel. Prado
asserts, indeed, that Quiros was a prisoner in the hands of mutineers, but as
he was not on board and could only have obtained his information at second
hand, and, moreover, was prejudiced and malicious, the statement may be
disregarded. Quiros himself, as he complained, had enemies on board,
discontented and sulky, but there can be no doubt of the loyalty and devotion
of his new Captain, de Leza, and his Secretary, Bermudez, who, perhaps jointly,
conducted affairs during Quiros' incapacity.</p>
<p>The "<i>Capitano</i>," having reached 10&deg; S., the latitude of Santa
Cruz, without seeing the island, being probably between it and the Solomon
Group, it was resolved on 18th June to make for Acapulca. unless some friendly
port should first be discovered suitable for refitting and repairing the ship.
On a NE. by N. course the line was crossed on 2nd July. The course was shortly
altered to NE., and lay, in all probability, between the Marshall and Gilbert
Islands. Having reached 38&deg; N. latitude, the vessel steered ESE. until
North American land was sighted in 34&deg; on 23rd September. The Mexican coast
was then followed to the SE. and Acapulca was reached on 23rd November, 1606.
Only one death occurred during the voyage, that of an old priest. Quiros, who
landed without resources, was coldly received. He, however, managed to reach
Madrid on 9th October, 1607. The remainder of his life was spent in making
passionate appeals to the King for the means to prosecute his discoveries and
develop the imaginary continent in the interests of Spain. Wearied by his
importunities, the Government got him out of the way by giving him an open
letter to the Governor at Panama, who was instructed to assist him to his
object, at the same time sending an0ther letter in which the Governor was
secretly instructed to string him on and delay him <i>ad infinitum</i>.
Fortunately for himself, he died on the voyage to Panama (1609-1610) unaware of
the treachery of which he was to be the victim. He was only fifty years of age,
but was, says Markham, "worn out and driven to his grave by Councils and
Committees with their futile talk, needless delays and endless
obstructions."</p>
<p>The flagship having disappeared, TORRES waited and searched for it for
fifteen days, before feeling himself free to form his own plans for carrying
out the instructions given him by Quiros. He weighed anchor on 26th June, and
commenced the voyage which took him through the passage on which Dalrymple
afterwards conferred the name Of TORRES STRAIT.</p>
<p>Torres' relation or report on this voyage occurs in the form of a letter
from Manila, dated 12th July, 1607, addressed to the King of Spain, and is, so
far as is known, the <i>first recorded</i> account of the passage of Torres
Straits. Had this report been published</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 17}</u></p>
<p>at once future explorers would have followed different lines from those now
marked by history. We have already seen how this report disappeared. There are
indications that Robert de Vaugondy had got some inkling of it, or of charts
relating to it, between 1752, when his map of the region showed no strait, but
only a "bight" on the western side (the Dutch idea), and 1756, when his map
showed the strait. The report was, in fact, discovered at Manila<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> in 1762, when a copy fell into the hands of Alexander
Dalrymple, who printed the Spanish text in Edinburgh in 1772, as an appendix to
his <i>Charts and Memoirs</i>. He had not, apparently, mastered its contents,
or grasped its significance, in 1770. Years later,. he translated it into
English, and permitted Captain James Burney to print the translation in his
<i>Discoveries in the South Seas in 1806</i>. Dalrymple, in fact, only knew of
Torres' achievement at second hand, and chiefly through the references of
Arias, when Cook sailed in the "<i>Endeavour</i>" in 1768.</p>
<p>Up to the last quarter of the eighteenth century, the references to the
voyages of Torres, second hand and unauthenticated as they were, contained in
Arias' Memorial (written between 1614 and 1641) were practically all that were
known to the world of Torres and Torres Strait.</p>
<p>The last, and not the least important, of the sources of information
regarding Torres have come to light as recently as 1878. These are CHARTS
signed by PRADO, and purporting to have been drawn during his voyage with
Torres. It appears that Napoleon I looted the treasures of the Spanish Archives
in a wholesale fashion and sent them to Paris. "There," says
Collingridge,<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> "they were found some years ago
by a friend of mine, who caused them to be restored to their original owners,
and acquainted me with their existence." They were reproduced in the <i>Bol. de
la Soc. Geografica de Madrid</i>, tom. iv, January, 1878, and, with two letters
of Prado, dated 24th and 25th December, 1613, again reproduced by
Collingridge.<b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> Possibly, as Markham suggests,
the surveys were the work of Torres or his Sailing Master, Fuentidue&ntilde;as,
and only the draughtsmanship is to be credited to Prado; but in any case the
charts are undoubtedly authentic and in accuracy of surveying bear comparison
with modern Admiralty work. Fortunately, Torres followed the pious custom of
his time in naming places discovered by him after the Saint or Saints whose
festivities appeared in the Calendar of the day, and thus we get several
important dates for which no other authority can be cited.</p>
<p>Our sources of information regarding Torres' important voyage are,
therefore, practically limited to (1) Torres' Letter to</p>
<blockquote>[1) Flinders' Voyage to Terra Australis in 1801, 1802 and 1803,
London, 1814, vol. i, p. 10.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) First Discovery of Australia, p. 122.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) The First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea, Sydney, 1906,
pp. 246-256.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 18}</u></p>
<p>the King of Spain, (2) Prado's Charts and Letters and (3) the Arias
Memorial. In the order in which these became known to the world they should
read (1) Arias, (2) Torres and (3) Prado.</p>
<p>It may be here observed that Torres apparently wrote without having the
charts before him, as he is vague and unreliable as to latitudes; that Prado's
charts contain latitudes which agree with modern official maps; and that the
Priests for whom Arias wrote had to rely, to a great extent, upon hearsay
evidence and were not able to quote from either Torres or Prado, although it is
possible that they had seen the general map of the work of the expedition
referred to by Prado in one of his letters, and which is still missing.</p>
<p>In spite of short rations, rough winds and the unwillingness of his crew,
Torres, after leaving Espiritu Santo, sailed south-west and claimed to have
passed, by one degree, the latitude indicated by the sailing orders. In other
words, he reached 21&deg; S. He considered that he had thus proved Espiritu
Santo to be an island. In reality he demonstrated that if it was a part of the
mainland at all it must have been a cape jutting out from it to the northeast.
Having now passed the "prescribed latitude" by a degree without seeing land, he
altered his course to the north-west, and again (probably about the latitude of
Princess Charlotte Bay, Queensland) to the north-east, and "FELL IN WITH THE
BEGINNING OF NEW GUINEA," and after coasting to the west for five days, landed
On what he named TIERA DE BUENAVENTURA on 18th July, 1606. Collingridge clearly
identifies this land as BASILISK ISLAND, so named by Captain John Moresby,
R.N., in 1873.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> West of Basilisk Island lies
Hayter Island, which is separated from New Guinea proper by the narrow China
Strait.</p>
<p>Torres then sailed along the south coast of HAYTER ISLAND (which he failed
to distinguish from the mainland of N. Guinea) and westward along the south
coast of New Guinea, noting "many ports, very large, with large rivers and many
plains." "In these parts," he says, "I took possession for Your Majesty,"
adding: "We caught in all this land twenty persons of different nations, that
with them we might be able to give a better account to Your Majesty." Shoals
extending to the west were skirted, and eventually cleared, according to
Torres, in 11&deg; S. lat.</p>
<p>Having thus passed through TORRES STRAIT, Torres hugged the coast of what is
now DUTCH NEW GUINEA, mainly on a north-west course, landing in many places and
"taking possession for Your Majesty," and noted that the natives had "iron,
China bells and other things, by which we knew we were near the Molucas." At
last the point was reached" where NEW GUINEA COMES TO AN END, fifty leagues
before you reach the Molucas." Here the adventurers</p>
<blockquote>[1) See Prado's Chart No. 2 and <i>Discoveries and Surveys in New
Guinea and the D'Entrecasteaux Islands</i>, London, 1876.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 19}</u></p>
<p>found MAHOMEDAN RESIDENTS, with whom they traded for such of their immediate
necessities as they could afford to pay for with cloth. The Mahomedans "gave
them news of the events of the Molucas" and spoke of Dutch ships.</p>
<p>Torres in his report gives impossible latitudes in and about the GULF OF
PAPUA, and the inference is inevitable that he was writing from memory and
without having the charts of his voyage, or perhaps even his log, before him.
Therefore, the southmost point (11&deg;) at which he says he cleared the strait
is open to grave doubt, especially as it is actually nineteen minutes south of
Cape York.</p>
<p>Prado's No. 3 Chart<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> shows the expedition in
"THE GREAT BAY OF ST. LAURENCE and PORT OF MONTEREY" modern ORANGERIE BAY),
lat. 10&deg; 25' (Prado has it 10&deg; 10'), long. 149&deg; 40', with the
legend "Discovered by D. Luis Vaes de Torres, 10 August, 1606." This careful
survey, which agrees admirably with modern charting, is sufficient evidence of
a sojourn of at least a few days, while the sketched rectangular subdivision of
the coast land into what are probably agricultural areas or PLANTATIONS
suggests that the site was considered to be well adapted for a settlement.</p>
<p>In Prado's No. 4 Map, of the BAY OF S. PETER OF ARLANCA (lat. 3&deg; 40' S.,
according to Prado, more correctly 3&deg; 56', according to modern charts,
long. 134&deg; 7' E.), we have no difficulty in recognising, with Collingridge,
TRITON BAY, in Dutch New Guinea, nor in identifying the "ISLA DEL CAPan. LUIS
VAES DE TORRES" with the modern AIDUMA ISLAND. A legend on the map reads:
"Discovered by D. Luis Vaes de Torres, 18th October, 1606."</p>
<p>THE PASSAGE OF TORRES STRAIT, therefore, took place between the dates of
Torres' touching at Orangerie Bay, 0th August, and Triton Bay, 18th October.
Considering that, once he had cleared the reefs and banks of the Gulf of Papua,
and taken a north-westerly course along the Dutch New Guinea coast, his
difficulties were over, it would only be reasonable to assign two-thirds of the
time to the voyage east and one-third to that west of the turning-point. On
this assumption, the approximate date of clearing the strait would be 24th
September.</p>
<p>Torres' report was written at Manila and dated 12th July, 1607, and he
states that he had been in that city for two months, thus fixing the date of
his arrival at the PHILIPPINES approximately at 12th May.</p>
<p>The time employed between Triton Bay (18th October) and the Philippines
(12th May), nearly seven months, has now to be accounted for. If we allow ten
days for bargaining with the Mahomedans at Triton Bay and leaving New Guinea
"where it comes to a termination fifty leagues before you come to the</p>
<blockquote>[1) See Collingridge's <i>Discovery of Australia</i>, p.
251.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 20}</u></p>
<p>Molucas," the time to be accounted for is narrowed to the period between
28th October and 12th May.</p>
<p>At the outside, the run from the west end of New Guinea to BATCHIAN (lat.
0&deg; 37' S., long. 117&deg; 36' E.), at the south-east end of the Moluccas,
in a sea already well known to the Spanish, could hardly have taken more than a
month, so that we may provisionally date Torres' arrival there at 28th
November.</p>
<p>On his arrival at BATCHIAN, Torres met a priest who had about one hundred
Christian followers, within the territory of a friendly Mahomedan king. The
priest, says Torres, "begged me to subdue one of the Ternate islands inhabited
by revolted Mahomedans, to whom Don Pedro de Acunha had given pardon in Your
Majesty's name, which I had maintained; and I sent advice to the M. de Campo,
Juan de Esquival, who governed the islands of Ternate, of my arrival, and
demanded if it was expedient to give this assistance to the King of Batchian;
to which he answered that it would be of great service to Your Majesty, if I
brought force for that purpose. On this, with 40 Spaniards and 400 Moors of the
King of Batchian, I made WAR, and in only four days I defeated them and took
the fort and put the King of Batchian in possession of it in Your Majesty's
name, to whom we administered the usual oaths, stipulating with him that he
should never go to war against Christians and that he should ever be a faithful
vassal to Your Majesty."</p>
<p>Assuming a week to have been occupied by the journey of Torres' messenger,
and another week for the four-days' missionary war and preparations for the
voyage, it was probably about 12th December when Torres himself sailed for
TERNATE (lat. 0&deg; 48' N., long. 127&deg; 18' E.). He probably did not take
more than three days to reach the latter port, say 15th December.</p>
<p>It is likely enough that Torres stayed for some time at Ternate, where he
was well received by Esquival, the Governor, for he did not, as we have seen,
arrive at MANILA till about 12th May, and the voyage of about 1,200 knots could
hardly have taken five months.</p>
<p>The Moors, or Mahomedans, near the eastern extremity of New Guinea (Triton
Bay?), says Torres, "gave us news of the events of the Molucas and told us of
Dutch ships." Collingridge observes<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> that "the
events of the Molucas were of a stirring nature at that time," and raises the
question of whether the Dutch expedition of 1606 could have been sent out in
consequence of the Dutch having heard of Torres' discoveries.</p>
<p>The "<i>Duyfken's</i>" cruise along the coasts of New Guinea and the Cape
York Peninsula took place within the limits set by the yacht's departure from
Bantam on 18th November, 1605, and its return in or before June, 1906. It is
therefore simply impossible that the Dutch could have heard, prior to the
despatch of the</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Discovery of Australia</i>, p. 236.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 21}</u></p>
<p>"<i>Duyfken</i>" of the doings of Torres, who only reached Ternate on 2th
December, 1606. In fact the "<i>Duyfken</i>" had returned to port before Torres
had got in touch with civilisation near the western extremity of New
Guinea.</p>
<p>In Torres' narrative, there is not a word implying that he laid any claim to
the discovery of a passage between New Guinea and Australia. On the contrary,
everything points to his having made for a passage regarding which he was
already in possession of some information, and there is a great deal of
evidence that the passage had already been used many times by Spanish and
Portuguese, although its existence was hidden from the Dutch and English. The
fact that Prado carefully labels the charted landing-places on the south coast
of New Guinea as having been discovered by Torres in no way supports the claim
(which Torres never made) to the discovery of the strait itself.</p>
<p>The narrow sea (ninety-eight knots across) known as TORRES STRAIT, between
New Guinea and Cape York, is crowded with islands and coral reefs, among which
a newcomer would be lucky indeed, as well as bold and skilful, if he found an
east and west passage. Modern surveys have laid down nine such practicable
passages, known, in their order from north to south, as Napoleon, Bligh,
Bramble, Yule, Simpson, Dayman, Prince of Wales, Normanby and <i>Endeavour</i>.
The question is, by which of these did Torres clear the strait?</p>
<p>As Torres himself gives an impossible northern latitude for his voyage in
the Gulf of Papua, and the southern latitude (11&deg;) he assigns to the strait
is no less impossible, for the reason that it would have brought him well into
Queensland, there can be no doubt that he was speaking from memory, and in
round numbers, without, for the time, having access to the documents which
would have enabled him to make accurate statements. On the other hand, his
description of the point where he was able to turn from a southerly to a
north-westerly course is of the highest value. "Here," he says, "there were
many large islands and there appeared to be more to the southward." Such a
description would be ludicrously incorrect if written from any point of view
whatever in 11&deg; S. lat., but it fits admirably what would be seen by an
observer passing through the BLIGH CHANNEL (10&deg; 20' S.). This is the second
channel which Torres could possibly have found, and I eliminate the first, or
Napoleon, channel because it is obviously hard to enter and barely navigable
without the aid of steam. Torres was, in fact, sailing west, with Jervis and
the Belle Vue Islands on his right and the two large islands, Mulgrave and
Banks, on his left, while catching glimpses of Hammond, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday, Horn and Prince of Wales Islands still further to the south. I cannot,
therefore, agree with Collingridge's suggestion that CAPTAIN COOK in 1770
merely</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 22}</u></p>
<p>rediscovered, in his <i>Endeavour</i> Strait, the channel used by Torres in
1606. No exception can be taken to the name of Torres being applied to the
whole of the strait, but the merit of finding channels among its dangerous
reefs is considerably greater than if the.reefs had been visible islands.</p>

islands. He attempted a new <i>route</i> by going round the north of Borneo,
and is said to have then discovered New Guinea. He called the new island Papua,
because of the fact that the natives of the Molucca Islands called the New
Guinea aborigines 'Papuans,' on account of their woolly hair. Next in order
came the Spanish navigator Alvaro de Saavedra, in 1537. In 1545 his countryman
Ortis de Retes, proceeding to take a more southerly course to the Moluccas, in
order to catch more favourable winds, sighted the island, and imagined he was
the discoverer, and named it Nueva Guinea. The island first appeared on

<p>The Dutch had been more or less in possession of Java since 1597, but even
within the first decade the necessity for expansion had begun to be felt, and
had a spur been needed it would have been supplied by the rivalry excited by
the comings and goings of the Spanish and Portuguese. The Dutch "General United

<p>the port and to what places, what commodities were in demand, how far their
navigation had extended, if they knew anything of Nova Guinea, and if they had
sent ships there or had been visited by ships from that country.</p>
<p>The above instructions were entered in the "<i>Gelderlant's</i>" log of 10th
April, 1602, and under date 15th May following a</p>
<p>note gives what appears to be a brief summary of the report brought back by
the "<i>Duyfken</i>":&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"They [the Ceramites, when interrogated] can say
nothing definite respecting the island of New Guinea, but say that white people
live on the south side, inhabited by Portuguese, but they had seen no
Portuguese ships. They can give no information about their [the New Guineans']
commerce and products."<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<p>The language of the note is somewhat involved, but it may be taken to mean
"white people, possibly Portuguese." Portugal had been in possession of the
Molucca Islands, then usually referred to as the Spice Islands, since 1512, and
it is more than likely that in the course of nearly a century her sailors had
acquired some knowledge of the not very distant southern coast of New Guinea
proper and had even spent some time on the land.</p>
<p>In 1605, Jan Willemszoon Verschoor, Manager of the Dutch East India Company
at Bantam, Java, sent out the "<i>Duyfken</i>" on a voyage of discovery, under
command of WILLEM JANSZOON. The Subcargo (Junior Supercargo?) was JAN LODEWIJS
VAN ROSINGIJN.</p>
<p>There is much room for doubt as to whether the "<i>Duyfken</i>" was (1) the
60-ton yacht of the expedition which was equipped in 1603, was commanded by
Steven van der Hagen, and came out to the East Indies, or (2) the 30-ton yacht
attached to the expedition which left the Texel in Holland on 2nd April, 1595,
and which sailed by Madagascar, reaching the south-west coast of Sumatra on 1st
June, 1596, called at Bali in 1597, turned back on 26th February of that year,
and returned to Holland <i>via</i> the south coast of Java and the Cape of Good
Hope, reaching the Texel on 14th August, 1597.<b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<p>No description of van der Hagen's 60-ton "<i>Duyfken</i>" is available,
beyond the statement of her tonnage. The Texel "<i>Duyfken</i>" is described as
"a small yacht of 30 tons, carrying 20 men, and having 2 large and 6 small
guns, with 2 bombards," and her master was Simon Lambertsz(oon) Mau. The other
vessels of the expedition were of 400, 400, and 200 tons respectively. It is
reasonable to suppose that this "<i>Duyfken</i>" acted as a tender to the
larger vessels, and it is unlikely that in addition to her armament and twenty
men she could have had carrying</p>

<p>capacity for native "trade" and stores for her crew sufficient for a voyage
of seven months. In the course of the voyage on which she is first heard of,
she probably drew supplies periodically from the larger ships of the
expedition. I incline, therefore, to the opinion that the 60-ton yacht was the
one which Willem Janszoon commanded from November, 1605, to June, 1606.</p>
<p>The "<i>Duyfken</i>" left BANTAM for New Guinea on 28th November, 1605, and
was back at BANDA ISLAND in or before June, 1606. Janszoon visited KEI and ARU
ISLANDS and made the coast of NEW GUINEA in 5&deg; south latitude. He then
followed the land south-eastward, passing TORRES STRAIT without settling the
question of whether or not there was a passage, although less than six months
later TORRES left the New Hebrides and made for the strait, evidently guided by
previous information. Still under the impression that he was off the New Guinea
coast, Janszoon kept the land in sight to 131 degrees of south latitude.
Instructions drawn up for the use of ABEL TASMAN in 1644 refer to the
"<i>Duyfken's</i>" voyage in these terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"It being ascertained that vast regions were for the
greater part uncultivated and certain parts inhabited by savage, cruel, black
barbarians, who slew some of our sailors, so that no information was obtained
touching the exact lie of the country or the commodities obtainable or in

been compelled to return and abandon the discovery they had begun, only
registering in their chart, by the name of KEERWEER, the extreme point of the

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 26}</u></p>
<p>touching a charter for the Australia Company, and a Memorandum, dated 2nd
August, 1618, was laid before the East India Company as a basis for the reply.
It is argued in this document that the Australia Company should be excluded
from the southern parts between the meridian of the east end of Ceylon and that
lying 100 miles east of the Solomon Islands, because the East India Company had
already busied itself with this part of New Guinea, instancing the
explorations, about 1606, by the "<i>Duyve</i>" ("<i>Duyfken</i>") by Skipper
Willem Janszoon and Supercargo Jan Lodovijkszoon van Rosingijn, "who made
sundry discoveries on the said coast of Nova Guinea, as is AMPLY SET FORTH IN
THEIR JOURNALS." Heeres remarks that therefore the journals of the expedition
must have been extant in 1618. They were extant, I have no doubt, in 1623, when
CARSTENSZOON sailed the "<i>Pera</i>" along the west coast of Cape York
Peninsula. Indeed, a close reading of the "<i>Pera's</i>" log gives the
impression that the "<i>Duyfken's</i>" charts and journals were the daily study
of the officers of the "<i>Pera</i>." Yet there is no reference in Tasman's
instructions, drawn up in 1644, to the charts and journals of the
"<i>Duyfken</i>."</p>
<p>The "<i>Pera's</i>" log, hereinafter quoted at length, contains the
following entry, dated 11th May, 1623:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"In the afternoon we sailed past a large river
(which the men of the '<i>Duyfken</i>' went up with a boat in 1606, and where
one of them was killed by the missiles thrown by the blacks). To this river,
which is in lat. 11&deg; 48', we have given the name of REVIER DE
CARPENTIER<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> in the new chart."</blockquote>
<blockquote>[1) This river is now named the SKARDON (see Queensland 4-mile Map,
Sheet 21A).]</blockquote>
<p>I take this to be evidence of Carstenszoon's familiarity with the
"<i>Duyfken's</i>" charts and journals.</p>
<p>There is no absolute certainty that any of the "<i>Duyfken's</i>" men, who
"went up" the Carpentier River "in a boat," set foot on the land. The man
killed by missiles may have been speared in the boat. If any of the crew
landed, this is the EARLIEST RECORDED LANDING Of white men in Australia.</p>
<p>The exact locality of the greater disaster which, according to the Kling
skipper, resulted in the death of nine of the "<i>Duyfken's</i>" crew, is not
stated. It may, however, be presumed that the slaughter took place at CAPE
KEERWEER, and finally determined the abandonment of the enterprise. The loss of
nine men, added to the loss of one at the Carpentier River, must have left a
30-or even a 60-ton vessel very short-handed.</p>
<p>The probability that the <i>Duyfken</i> "made still another voyage to New
Guinea, including possibly the Cape York Peninsula, has been argued from the
following passage in <i>A Narrative and journal of the Voyage made from Bantam
to the Coast of Choromandel and other Parts of India</i>, by PAULUS VAN SOLT,
in the Years 1605, 1606, 1607, 1608:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 27}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">"On the 4th of March, 1607, through God's mercy,
arrived before the Castle [of Victoria, Amboyna]...Here we found the yacht
<i>Duyfken</i>' which had come from Nova Guinea [was van Nova Guinea
gekommen]."<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<p>When van Solt arrived at Amboyna, only nine months had elapsed since the
"<i>Duyfken</i>" had put in to Banda on her return from her famous voyage. She
might very well have made another voyage to New Guinea in that time, but on the
other hand, she may only have been pointed out to van Solt as the vessel which
had made the adventurous and disastrous voyage, the fame of which had not yet
been forgotten.</p>
<p>At the time when Torres made his way through the strait between New Guinea
and Australia&mdash;a strait which had probably been known to others before
him&mdash;and when Janszoon sailed past the western opening of the passage and
coasted Australia for 250 miles to the south, never doubting that he was
following the coastline of New Guinea, Queen Elizabeth was not long dead and
William Shakespeare was still a living force. The events occurring in the Cape
York Peninsula some three centuries later were contemporaneous with the gay
adventure of Germany in setting forth, carrying "sword and fire, red ruin and
the breaking up of realms," for the acquisition of "world-domination," her
title being that she was strong enough to take whatever she coveted, and found
instead the "downfall" which had been ironically alluded to in her boasting as
the absurd and wholly unimaginable alternative.</p>
<p>Through the first three centuries of Australian history, contemporary events
in Europe affected more or less the course of exploration. The reader will be
apt to reflect, as an example, on the bearing of the Napoleonic wars on the
career of Flinders, and I venture to assert that Australian history is no
isolated phenomenon, but will be best understood by a reader who can picture to
himself what, at any given date, was happening in other portions of the
globe.</p>

<h4>THE VOYAGE OF THE "PERA" AND "AERNEM" (1623)</h4>
<b>I. THE SAILING ORDERS</b>
<p>MINUTE SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS DISCOVERIES AND FAILURES. INSTRUCTIONS TO EXPLORE
AND SURVEY THE COAST OF THE SOUTH LAND AND INQUIRE INTO ITS COMMERCIAL
RESOURCES. To MAKE TREATIES WITH NATIVE KINGS. To TAKE POSSESSION OF ANY LAND
OF SUFFICIENT VALUE. To CAPTURE SOME NATIVES, WHO MAY IN TIME GIVE USEFUL
INFORMATION.</p>
<p>Reports having reached Batavia of the loss of the English ship
"<i>Triall</i>" and the perilous experiences of three Dutch ships, the
"<i>Wapen van Hoorn</i>," "<i>Amsterdam</i>" and "<i>Dordrecht</i>," on the
north-western coast of Australia, the Governor and Council of the East India
Company at Batavia resolved to dispatch an expedition for further explorations
of the Southern Land. Instructions were accordingly made out for the yachts
"<i>Haring</i>" and "<i>Hasewint</i>." Unforeseen circumstances having,
however, prevented these yachts carrying out the orders, they were taken over
by the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>."</p>
<p>The full text of the instructions is given by PROFESSOR HEERES in his
Commemoration Volume, <i>The Part borne by the Dutch</i>, together with an
English translation by Mr. C. Stoffel. The latter is followed hereunder, except
that I have occasionally employed an English word or two which appeared "more
agreeable to the text" than the expression selected by the translator.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE YACHTS 'HARINGH' AND
'HASEWINT,' SELECTED FOR THE JOINT EXPLORATION OF THE SOUTHERN
LAND."</blockquote>
<blockquote class="inline">INASMUCH as our Superiors earnestly enjoin us to
despatch hence some yachts, with the object of making discoveries in the
Southern Land; and since, moreover, experience has taught, through great perils
incurred by several of our ships, and still more through the destruction of the
English ship '<i>Triall</i>' on the said coast, how necessary it is to have
full and accurate knowledge of the true position of this land, so that further
misfortunes may henceforth be prevented as much as is possible; and as,
moreover, it is desirable that this land, or any inhabited portion thereof,
should be explored, so as to ascertain whether any trade with them might be
worth while;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="inline">"THEREFORE, for the purpose before mentioned, we
have resolved to fit out the yachts '<i>Haringh'</i> [herring] and
'<i>Hasewint</i>' to undertake the voyage and to discover as much regarding the
resources of these regions as God Almighty shall permit.]</blockquote>
<blockquote class="inline">"You will accordingly set sail from here together,
run out of Sunda Strait, and steer your course from the western extremity of
Java to the South Land, keeping as</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 29}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">close to the wind as ever you can, so as not to be
driven too far west by the southeasterly winds which generally prevail in these
waters. You may therefore run on as far as the thirty-second or thirty-third
degree if you do not before that fall in with the land. If you should have
sailed so far, and yet have seen no land, you may conclude<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> that you have fallen off too far westward, for sundry
ships coming from the fatherland have accidentally come upon the South Land
before these latitudes. In this case, you will have to shape your course
eastward and run on in that direction until you sight land.<br>
<br>
"In running over to the South Land aforesaid, you will have to keep a careful
lookout, as soon as you get in 14&deg; or 15&deg;, seeing that the said English
ship <i>Triall</i>,' when in 20&deg; 10' S. lat., got on certain sunken rocks,
which, according to the observation of the English pilot, extend for 7 miles
north-east and south-west, although no dry land was visible. Nevertheless, the
men who saved themselves in the pinnace and boat and arrived here stated that
about 13&deg; or 14&deg; they had seen masses of reeds, wood and other drift
floating about in the sea, from which they concluded that there must be land or
islands somewhere in the neighbourhood. The aforesaid sunken rocks on which the
<i>Triall</i>' was wrecked ought, according to the report of the Englishmen, to
be due south of the west cape of Java.<br>
<br>
"Having reached the South Land in the said latitude or near it, you will then
sail along the same as far as lat. 50&deg;, in case the land extends so far
south, but if the land should come to an end before you have oversailed the
said latitude, and should be found to trend eastward, you may follow it in that
direction for a little, but if you find no further southward extension
possible, you had better turn back. You will do the same if the land should
turn westward. On the return voyage you will run along the coast as far as it
extends to the north, and next eastward or otherwise as the land goes, and thus
follow the land as close and as far as possible and as you judge your
provisions will suffice for the return home, even if, in so doing, you should
sail round the whole land and emerge to southward.<br>
<br>
"The main object for which you are dispatched on this occasion is that from 45
or 50 degrees, or from the furthest point to which the said land shall be found
to extend southward between these latitudes, up to the northmost end of the
South Land, you are to discover and survey all capes, forelands, bays, lands,
islands, rocks, reefs, sandbanks, deeps, shallows, roadsteads, winds, currents
and whatever else appertains to the same, so that they may be charted and
noted, with their true latitudes, longitudes, bearings and conditions. You will
moreover land in various places and carefully observe whether they are
inhabited, and what sort of people and country there are, what towns and
villages there are, their government, their religion, their policy, their
war-equipment, their waters, their vessels, their fisheries, and their
commodities and manufactures, and more especially what minerals they have, such
as gold, silver, tin, iron, lead and copper, as well as precious stones and
pearls, and what vegetables, animals and fruits these lands afford.<br>
<br>
"To all of which particulars and whatever else may be worth noting you will pay
diligent attention, keeping a careful record or journal with reference thereto,
that we may get full information of all your doings and experiences and the
Company may obtain due and perfect knowledge of the natural resources of these
lands in return for their heavy outlay.<br>
<br>
"To all the places which you touch at, you will give appropriate names,
choosing for the same either the names of the United Provinces or of the towns
therein, or any other dignified names. Of all which places, lands and islands,
the Commander and Officers of the said yachts will, by order and pursuant to
the Commission of The Honourable the Governor-General, Jan Peterszoon Coen,
sent out there [i.e., to the East Indies] by their High Mightinesses the States
General of the United Netherlands, together with Messieurs the Directors of the
General Chartered United East India Company in these parts, by solemn
declaration signed by the Ships' Councils, take formal possession, and in token
thereof, besides, erect a stone column in such places as</blockquote>

recorded in bold, legible characters the year, the month, the day of the week
and the date, the person by whom, and when such possession has been taken on
behalf of the States General above mentioned. You will likewise endeavour to
enter into friendly relations and make covenants with as such kings and nations
as you shall happen to fall in with, and prevail upon them to place themselves
under the protection of the States of the United Netherlands; of which
covenants and treaties you will likewise cause proper documents to be exchanged
with the other parties.<br>
<br>
"All lands, islands, places, etc., which you shall take possession of, as
aforesaid, you will duly mark in the chart, with their true latitude, longitude
and bearings, together with the names newly conferred on the same.<br>

"According to the oath of allegiance which each of you, jointly and severally
has sworn to the Lords States General, His Princely Excellency and Messieurs
the Directors, none of you shall be allowed to secrete, or by underhand means
to retain any written documents, journals, drawings or observations touching
the expedition but every one of you shall be bound on his return here
faithfully to deliver up the same without exception.<br>
<br>
"According to the writings of Jan Van Huygen [van Linschoten] and the opinion
of several others, some parts of this South Land are likely to yield gold, a
point in which you should inquire as carefully as possible.<br>
<br>
"We also give you, for an experiment, divers ironwares, cloths, 'coast' dress
[Heeres explains, in a footnote, 'from the coast of Coromandel'] and linen
stuff which you will show and try to dispose of to such people as you may meet
with, always carefully noting what articles are found to be most in demand,
what quantities might be disposed of, and what might be obtained in exchange
for them. We also send samples of gold, silver, copper, iron, lead and pearls,
that you may inquire whether these articles are known to the inhabitants and
might be obtained there in any reasonable quantity.<br>
<br>
"In landing anywhere you will exercise extreme caution, and never go ashore
inland unless well armed, trusting no one, however simple the people may appear
be, or how plausible, but be always ready to stand on the defensive, so that no
disaster may overtake you, such as, God knows, has often happened in like
cases. Should people come out to you from the land, you will take the like care
that they suffer no harm from our men.<br>
<br>
"Coming to the northern extremity and east side of the South Land, you will
diligently enquire whether any sandalwood, nutmegs, cloves, or other aromatic
fruits grow there. Item, if there are any good harbours or conveniently
situated or fruitful lands, where colonies might be planted which might be
amply self-supporting. In a word, let nothing pass you unobserved, and whatever
you find bring us a full and particular report of it, by which you will do the
States of the United Netherlands service and lay up special honour for
yourselves.<br>
<br>
"In places where you meet with people, you will, by dexterity [behendlicheyt]
or otherwise, get hold of some adults, or, still better, young lads or girls,
to the end that they should be brought up here, and later, when opportunity
offers, be broken in at the said quarters.<br>
<br>
"The command of these two yachts is given to JAN Vos, who, during the voyage
will carry the flag, convene the Council and preside therein, by virtue of Our
Special Commission granted to the above-named Vos for that purpose.<br>
<br>
"Given in Fort Jacatra the 29th September, Ao. 1622."</blockquote>
<p>No better instructions could have been drawn up to serve the guidance of
sailors setting out on a voyage of discovery with the object of acquiring
geographical and commercial knowledge (although some clauses indicating what
was expected, such as the references to kings and nations and treaties of
alliance, may bring</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 31}</u></p>
<p>a smile on the faces of those who have come to know what was the actual
condition of affairs. In other parts, the language employed is intentionally
and diplomatically ambiguous. A notable instance</p>
<p>is the instruction regarding the CAPTURE OF SLAVES. The word "behendlicheyt"
meaning literally "hardihood," might be rendered as dexterity, adroitness,
ingenuity, strategy, smartness, trickery or treachery, and the addition of "or
otherwise" left no room for delicate scruples. The sailors made no mistake in
interpreting their orders to mean that they were to capture slaves, with a
minimum of friction, if possible, but in any case to capture them somehow. It
is not so written, but it is easy to understand that the voyagers were
expected, by the capture of "adults, or, still better, young lads or girls," to
do something substantial towards recouping the expenses of the expedition.
Ample evidence will be found in the log of the "<i>Pera</i>," which carried out
the instructions originally drawn up for the "<i>Haring</i>" and
"<i>Hasewint</i>," that this was the true meaning of the instructions. One
hundred and thirty-three years later, the Dutch ship "<i>Rijder</i>" was
carrying on the same tactics as were employed by the "<i>Pera</i>," and on the
same western shore of the Cape York Peninsula. Even while the "<i>Pera</i>" was
at sea, Torres was at work on the same lines, for his Spanish masters, on the
southern shores of New Guinea; only he was more successful, as he records with
satisfaction that in the course of the voyage he had captured twenty
persons.</p>
<p>Early in the seventeenth century, the idea that there was anything
reprehensible in slavery had barely suggested itself to the European mind, and
I desire to point out that the Dutch were neither better nor worse than their
contemporaries. If their proceedings appear simply abominable to readers in the
twentieth century, there can be no doubt that those of their contemporary
rivals were dictated by the same principles and carried out by the same
methods.</p>
<p>At the present day we are confronted by the spectacle of savage populations
dying out wherever they come in contact with comparatively civilised men.
Belated Christianity, benevolence, philanthropy, charity or fair dealing seem
alike powerless to arrest the working of what appears to be a natural law. In
these circumstances, it is open to argument that for savage races a
probationary period of SERVITUDE is preferable to its only alternative,
EXTINCTION.</p>

EXPEDITION PASSED "TORRES STRAIT" SATISFIED THAT IT WAS ONLY A SHALLOW BIGHT
AND THAT THE CAPE YORK PENINSULA FORMED PART OF NEW GUINEA.</p>
<p>THE history of the voyages of the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" in 1623
may be studied in the original records of the Dutch East India Company by those
who have the opportunity. They consist, in the first place, of a "covering
letter," dated 3rd January, 1624, from the Governor-General and Council to the
Directors of the Company, and secondly, what is entitled <i>Journal kept by Jan
Carstensz.(oon) on his Voyage to Nova Guinea.</i></p>
<p>The letter states that, in January, 1623, Governor VAN SPEULT dispatched
from AMBOINA the yachts "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Arnhem</i>" for the purpose of
cultivating friendly relations with the inhabitants of Queij, Aroe and Tenimber
and of exploring the land of Nova Guinea. The above-named islanders, it is
further stated, had of their own free will placed themselves under the rule and
protection of the States of the United Netherlands and promised to come and
trade with the fortresses of Banda and Amboina. For the remaining portion of
the voyage, along the land of Nova GUINEA (which was described as a barren
country, inhabited by absolutely barbarous, cruel savages), the Directors were
referred to the enclosure itself.</p>
<p>The second document, the JOURNAL, was printed in full by L. C. D. Van Dijk,
in 1859, in <i>Mededlingen Oost-Indisch Archief: No. 1, Twee Togten naar de
Golf van Carpentaria</i>. The portions relating to Australia were subsequently
printed by Professor Heeres (Leiden, E. J. Brill, London, Luzac and Co.) in his
work <i>The Part of the Dutch in the Discovery of Australia, 1606-1765</i>,
issued by the Royal Dutch Geographical Society on its twenty-fifth anniversary,
in 1899, together with an English translation by Mr. C. Stoflel. The Journal
itself is bald and businesslike, makes no pretensions to literary form, and is
even careless as to grammatical</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 33}</u></p>
<p>accuracy. Stoffel's translation, on the other hand, is a dainty piece of
work. It is as if he had rewritten a plain tale with the object of suiting it
for acceptance by a high-class magazine. He has, indeed, while taking no
serious liberties with the facts, presented the tale in the garb of early
seventeenth-century English, the trick of which he has caught admirably. The
only fault to be found with the translation is that it is better than the
original. In the following pages, I have ventured, while freely acknowledging
my indebtedness to the Dutch translator, to present an almost literally
translated English version which, in my opinion, more nearly reflects the
rough-hewn story of the author.</p>
<p>The Report is in the form of a DIARY kept on board the "<i>Pera</i>," and is
probably in the main a transcription of the ship's log, and is signed by JAN
CARSTENSZOON, the COMMODORE of the Expedition. It is headed "Journal kept by
Jan Carstensz," that being the contraction in common use at a time when
surnames denoted only that the person known by a certain Christian name was the
son (zoon) of somebody else.</p>
<p>Although the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" took over the orders
originally drawn up for the "<i>Haring</i>h" and "<i>Hasewint</i>," the SKIPPER
of the "<i>Pera</i>," JAN SLUIJS, was not in the position which was to have
been occupied by Jan Vos, who, presumably, was the skipper of one of the two
vessels. Vos, it was intended, should carry the flag, convene the Council and
preside therein." In short, he was not only to command his own ship but to be
commodore of the expedition as well. The SKIPPERS of the "<i>Pera</i>" (Sums)
and "<i>Aernem</i>" (MELISZOON) had no higher status than that of SAILING
MASTERS, and although most of the hard work was assigned to them, they were
evidently of less importance than the merchants or traders (kooplieden), as
witness the order of precedence observed in the Aru and Queij inscriptions.</p>
<p>A democratic institution, <i>viz.</i>, a "FULL COUNCIL" of the assembled
officers of both ships,<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> seems to a modern lay
reader to have been well calculated to destroy all order and discipline, and
yet there is no evidence that on these two ships any serious trouble
resulted.</p>
<p>From a reference in the log to a resolution of the Council on a certain
date, which resolution is not mentioned in the log of that date, there is
reason to suppose that the proceedings of the Council were recorded in a
separate minute book, which has been lost, or lost sight of.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know the names of all the adventurers who set out
in 1623 and who lighted upon the Cape York Peninsula, but no list is given in
the log, only a few names being mentioned incidentally, while a few more can be
gathered from other documents.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The composition of the Full Council is explained in Tasman's
instructions.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 34}</u></p>
<p>JAN CARSTENSZOON, "Opper Coopman" (Upper merchant, or trader or SUPERCARGO)
on the "<i>Pera</i>," acted as COMMODORE of the expedition. The ASSISTANT
SUPERCARGO Of the "<i>Pera</i>" was PIETER LINGTES Or LINTIENS. The SKIPPER was
JAN SLUIJS. The UPPER STEERSMAN (Chief Mate)was AREND MARTENSZOON DE LEEUW, and
the UNDER STEERSMAN (Second Mate) was WILLEM JOOSTEN VAN COOLSTEERDT, who was
made skipper of the "<i>Aernem</i>" on the death of Meliszoon, the original
master (10th February, 1623). The number of the crew is nowhere stated, but at
any rate it was large enough to furnish a boat's crew of thirteen men on
occasion. A CARPENTER and an "ASSISTANT" are referred to, but it is not clear
whether the latter was the carpenter's apprentice or a midshipman. A CORPORAL
and TEN MUSKETEERS are mentioned, but it is doubtful whether these were marines
or sailors armed for the occasion. There was also a BARBER-SURGEON, and a
"JUREBASS," who was an expert swimmer and who died of liver complaint or of the
operation performed by the barber. Stoffel is unable to give an English
equivalent for "jurebass" and no more can I, nor can any Dutchman whom I have
had an opportunity of consulting. We must, therefore, for the present be
content to define a Jurebass as "a person who performs jurebassial functions."
My conjecture wavers between a slave, prisoner, convict or hostage on the one
hand and a lent or temporarily impressed local pilot on the other.</p>
<p>The "<i>Aernem</i>" set out on the voyage under command of DIRK MELISZOON,
assisted by an unnamed FIRST MATE and a SECOND MATE named JAN JANSZOON. On 10th
February, 1623, Meliszoon was killed by natives of New Guinea, together with an
"assistant." (midshipman?) named JAN WILLEMSZOON VAN DEN BRIEL and eight
others. After this disaster, VAN COOLSTEERDT, second mate of the "Perez," was
given command of the "<i>Aernem</i>," and JANSZOON, the "<i>Aernem's</i>"
second mate, was made FIRST MATE.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this study to follow the fortunes of the
expedition except in so far as they are connected with the Cape York Peninsula,
but it may be mentioned that the "<i>Pera's</i>" officers completed their
voyage under the mistaken impression that they had demonstrated the CONTINUITY
OF CERAM AND NEW GUINEA, although pre-existing maps showed this stretch of land
to be divided into a chain of islands. When DE LEEUW&mdash;evidently some time
after the voyage&mdash;drew his famous sketch-chart, he must have been
satisfied of the error of this conclusion, as he showed the islands. The
expedition abandoned the search for the alleged opening now known as TORRES
STRAIT, believing that it DID NOT EXIST, and coasted Australia for eight
degrees southward, having failed to realise that New Guinea was a distinct
island. On the other hand, they furnished the earliest account of a portion of
Australia and added materially to the knowledge of New Guinea.</p>

<p>On 11th March, 1623, the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" anchored off a
promontory, which they named VALSCH CAEP (False Cape), the western extremity of
what is now distinguished as FREDERICK HENRY ISLAND, and is separated from the
mainland of New Guinea by the narrow Princess Marianne or Dourga Channel. From
this point, the "<i>Pera's</i>" log, dealing with an attempt to find an
eastward passage through the suspected TORRES STRAIT, the "DRY BIGHT" which was
supposed to be "all there was" to it, and the cruises along the western coast
of the CAPE YORK PENINSULA, is reproduced almost <i>verbatim</i>.</p>

two boats well manned and armed, in order to see if there was anything worthy
of note there; but when we had got within a musket shot from the land, the
water became so shallow that we could not reach it, whereupon we all of us went
through the clay up to our waists and with great difficulty reached the beach,
where we saw a number of fresh human footprints. On going a short distance into
the bush, we saw 20 or more huts made of dried grass,</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 36}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">the huts being so small and cramped that a man could
hardly creep into them, from which we could sufficiently conclude that the
natives must be poor and miserable specimens of humanity. We afterwards tried
to penetrate somewhat further into the bush, in order to ascertain the nature
and situation of the country. As we were returning, a number of BLACKS sprang
out of the bush and let fly their ARROWS at us very furiously and with a
horrible shouting, wounding a carpenter in the belly and an apprentice in the
leg. They also made signals to other blacks to come to their assistance. Being
thus hard pressed, we fired three or four muskets at the blacks, killing one
stone dead, which utterly took away their courage, and they dragged the dead
man into the bush. Being so far from the boats and a very difficult path to
travel, we returned, rowed out and went on board. The same day, at low water,
we saw a great shoal, extending SE., S. and SW. from us, where we had been with
the yachts on the 11th. The said shoal stretches fully 4 miles [16 minutes]
WSW. and W. by S. of the land or hook, to which has been given in the new chart
the name of VALSCH CAEP, and which is in lat. 8&deg; 15' S. [really 8&deg; 21'
and about 70 miles [280 minutes] east [really SE.] of Aru.<br>
<br>
"NOTE that the land which we have touched at, as above mentioned, is low-lying
and half-submerged to the north, so that a large part of it is under water at
high tide. In the south it is somewhat higher, and here some men inhabit it,
and possess huts, but so far as we could ascertain it is barren, although
closely covered with tall, wild trees. The men are quite black and naked. Their
hair curls, like that of the Papuans. They wear certain fish-bones through the
nose, and through the ears pieces of the bark of trees, a span in length, so
that they look more like monsters than human beings. Their weapons are ARROWS
AND BOWS, with which they are very expert.<br>
<br>
"On the 13th, the wind N.: good weather and the current stronger to west than
to north. We got under sail in the forenoon, course WNW. to get into deeper
water, and when we had run a short distance we got about 8 feet, upon which we
turned back, and towards evening anchored in 2 fathoms.<br>
<br>
"On the 14th, good weather, the wind N. by W., and the current, as before,
strong to the SW. At midday, both boats sent out to take soundings, and they
went fully a miles WNW. of the yachts without finding anywhere more than
1&frac12; or 2 fathoms of water. The same day, it was found practicable to set
up again the '<i>Aernem's</i>' main topmast (which had been lowered because it
was useless in the calm weather), for which the weather was now every day
becoming more suitable.<br>
<br>
"On the 15th, wind NNE., good weather, and the current as strong as before. At
midday, got under sail, on a tide coming from the NW., in the hope of getting
clear of the shoals, but after beating about till towards evening, we were
forced by contrary currents to anchor in 3 fathoms.<br>
<br>
"The 16th, good weather, the wind NE. by E. Got under sail before midday. In
the course of the day the wind dropped. Towards evening the wind veered round
to WSW. Course NNW. along the shallows, in 2&frac12; and 2 fathoms. In the
evening, anchored in 3 fathoms. We have found that in these parts the currents
set very strongly to SW., as before mentioned, and that the water rises and
falls fully 1&frac12; and 2 fathoms at each tide.<br>

"On the morning of the 21st, we again set sail, the wind NNW. and the course

more south of the mainland.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> A quarter of a mile
N. by E., and S. by W. of the islet is a rock, on which two leafless trees are
standing.<br>
<br>
"On the 22nd, the Council having been convened, it was finally resolved to land
with the two boats properly manned and armed, seeing that the coast here is
covered with coco-nut trees, and is also higher, better looking and more
fruitful than any country which we have seen hitherto: afterwards when we
failed to get ashore because of mud-flats, we rowed to the before-mentioned
islet, and let go the anchor in order to visit it. While we were so engaged,
the yacht '<i>Aernem</i>' got adrift, owing to the force of the current and the
wind, and ran foul of the bows of the '<i>Pera</i>,' much damage being done to
both ships...This prevented any further sailing for some days, and indeed had
God not specially looked after them, both yachts would have gone ashore.<br>
<br>
"On the 23rd, good weather, and the Council having been convened once more, I
proposed to try every possible means to get the '<i>Aernem</i>' into sailing
trim again and in the first place another rudder so as not to delay the voyage,
but there was absolutely no means of doing this because in neither of the
yachts were there any spare rudders or old ones which could be cut down.
Prevented thus from making a proper job of it, it was finally resolved (to
expedite the voyage and not have the yacht lagging behind) that with the
materials available a rudder should be constructed Javanese or Chinese fashion.
For this purpose the <i>Pera</i> will have to give up her main topmast, the
rest of the required wood to be fetched from the land, and we shall stay here
until the rudder has been made.<br>
<br>
"On the 24th (while the rudder was being made) the subcargo,<b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> with both the boats, went to the aforesaid island to
get water for the <i>Aernem</i> (which was very short of it) and came on board
in the evening with four firkins full, after great trouble.<br>
<br>
"On the 25th, the yacht <i>Aernem</i> again seaworthy (Praise God!) with good
weather and a favourable wind got under sail once more, course E., in
5&frac12;, 6 and 6&frac12; fathoms along the land. In the evening, in 2&frac12;
fathoms and 2 miles off the land, we cast anchor, having sailed ten miles [40
minutes] this day.<br>
<br>
"NOTE that the island hereinbefore mentioned lies in 8&deg; 8' S. lat. [8&deg;
16' according to modern charts.&mdash;R.L.J.] about a mile N. and S. [i.e., S.]
of the mainland, as aforesaid, is pretty high and is well timbered with wild
trees on the east side and quite bare on the west. It is about a quarter of a
mile in circumference and is surrounded by many boulders and rocks (on which
plenty of oysters grow). The soil is very good and suitable for all sorts of
plants and cereals. It carries, by our estimate, upwards of too full-grown
coco-nut trees, with many young ones coming on, and also some bananas and
oubis, with fresh water, which comes trickling through the clay in small rills
and may be caught in pits dug for the purpose. There are also a great many bats
(vleermuijsjen) which live in the trees, for which reason in the new chart we
have given the island the name of VLEERMUIJS EIJLANDT. We have seen no huts or
human beings on it, but found unmistakable signs that men had been there
before. [The island appears on modern charts as Habeeke Island.&mdash;R. L.

<blockquote>[1) The wording ("near an island lying a mile or more south and
north of the mainland") is ambiguous, but the island, which was afterwards
named Vleermuijs Eijlandt (Bat I.) must have been south of the land. The island

weather, the wind NNW., course SE. by E. along the land in 5 fathoms. In the
forenoon four canoes put out from the land and eventually, on our waiting for
them, boarded us. There were altogether 25 BLACKS, who had nothing with them
but their weapons. They called out and made signs that we should come on shore.
We threw them some small pieces of iron and coral, at which they showed great
satisfaction. Gold, silver, nutmegs and cloves, which were shown to them, they
paid little or no attention to, though they were willing to accept them as
presents. Their canoes are very skilfully made out of a single piece of wood,
and some are so large that they will carry 20 or more blacks. Their paddles are
long, and they used them standing or sitting. The men are black and tall and
carry themselves well, with big and strong limbs and curled hair like the
Kaffirs, which some of them bind on the neck with a knot, while others let it
hang loose down to their waists. They have little or no beard. Some of them
have two, and others three, slits through the nose, in which they carry tusks
of boars, or the 'teeth' of swordfish. They are stark naked and have their
privates enclosed in a conch-shell (which is fastened to the waist with a piece
of twine). They have no rings of gold, silver, copper, tin or iron on their
bodies, but occasionally they have them of turtle-shell, from which it may be
inferred that their country yields no metals, nor any wood of value, being all
low and submersible land, as indeed we have found it to be. There were also
among them some not provided with paddles, but wearing two strings of human
teeth round their necks, and excelling the others in ugliness, carrying on the
left arm a hammer, with a handle of wood, with at one end a black conch-shell,
the size of a fist, and at the other, by which it is held, a three-sided bone
not unlike a staghorn. For one of these hammers they were offered a rug, coral
(beads) and iron, which were refused, though the savages were quite willing to
barter one for one of the boys, to whom they had taken a fancy. It seems likely
that those who carry the aforesaid hammers belong to the nobility or military.
The people are cunning and suspicious and by no finesse<b style=

catch one or two with the nooses which we had prepared for the purpose. They
carried also in their canoes some human thighbones, which they repeatedly held
up to us, but what they meant by this is unknown to us. At last they asked for
a rope to tow the yacht to land, but found it too hard work and quickly paddled
back to the land.<br>

armed, to the land, in order to ascertain what could be done for the service of
our masters, and to parley with the people, and, if practicable, get hold of

black, thin in body, and stark naked, with basket-work or nets round their

of Coromandel, but they seem to be less cunning, bold and wicked than the
blacks at the west end of New Guinea. Their weapons, some of which we are
bringing with us, are assegais, shields, clubs and sticks about 1&frac12;

that hereabouts in these climes in the east monsoons north winds prevail, just
as south [north?] of the line in the forenamed monsoons south winds do, and so
we might fall on a lee shore. On which considerations, it was judged to be best
for the interests of our Masters, and was determined and resolved to TURN BACK,
and to follow the coast of New Guinea northward as far as it may be practicable
also to touch at various places and examine them carefully, and then shape our
course for Aru and Queij...It was further proposed by me, and ultimately agreed
to, to offer to the boats' crews for each black captured on the land and
brought on board ten reals of eight, and that, to this end, the crews may use
greater care and diligence, so as to do our Masters signal service, for which
they might expect to reap due recognition.<br>

"On the 25th, the skipper of the <i>Pera</i> was ordered to land, with both
boats well manned and armed, and especially to look out for fresh water, with
which we are now very poorly provided. About midday, the skipper returned and
reported that he had sunk pits at various places on shore, but could find no
water: also that they had seen 7 small huts on the beach, made of hay, and 7 or
8 blacks, who would not stop to parley. In the afternoon, I, personally, taking
both boats, went up a salt inlet for about half a mile [about 2 1/3 English
miles.&mdash;R.L.J.], and then, with the party, walked a good way into the
land, which was under water [salt water?&mdash;R.L.J.] in many places,
recalling the Waterland in Holland, so that it may be presumed that further
into the interior there may be great lakes or marshes. We also saw many
footprints of men, and the tracks of large dogs, going from south to north; and
since by resolution it has been determined to begin the return voyage from
here, we have, in default of stone, nailed to a tree a wooden tablet, on which
the following words were engraved:&mdash;' Anno 1623 den 24n April sijn hier
aen gecomen twee jachten wegen de Hooge Mogende Heeren Staten Gen'.' ['In the
year 1623 the 24th April hereto came two yachts on behalf of the High and
Mighty Lords States General.'] The addition of the aforesaid river is
denominated the STATEN RIVER in the newly made chart." [A marginal note
reads:&mdash;" The Staten Revier is in latitude 170&deg; 8'."&mdash;This was
the latitude of the anchorage.&mdash;R.L.J.]</blockquote>
<p>[EDITORIAL NoTE.&mdash;The exact position of the inlet named the "STATEN
REVIER" by the Commodore of the Expedition is open to question&mdash;within
certain narrow limits.</p>
<p>The position is not defined with sufficient accuracy by the midday solar
observation of 24th April.</p>
<p>On that date, the "<i>Pera</i>" sailed southward till midday, close to the
land, as indicated by the soundings, which had a maximum of 4&frac12; fathoms.
At noon, the sun was taken, and gave the latitude 17&deg; 8' S. As soon as the
latitude had been calculated and noted, orders were given to let go the anchor,
and probably the anchorage was an (English) mile or two south of 17&deg; 8',
and very near the beach. We may assume that it was 2 miles south of the noon
position, or, say, 17&deg; 10', i.e., 4 (English) miles north of Accident
Inlet. The "<i>Pera</i>," no doubt, waited some time for the arrival of the
"<i>Aernem</i>" (which always lagged behind), in order that the officers of
both ships might meet in "full council" on board the "<i>Pera</i>." The
question of sailing further south or turning back having been discussed at some
length, the latter course was decided on, and by this time the afternoon was
too far advanced for a landing.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 44}</u></p>
<p>The skipper of the "<i>Pera</i>" was "ordered" to land on the 25th, and to
look out for fresh water. He landed, there can be no doubt, on the nearest
beach, where he saw huts and a few natives, and dug unsuccessfully for water.
There is no indication whatever that he landed at, or because he saw, any
"revier" or inlet. He returned to the "<i>Pera</i>" at noon.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Commodore (Carstenszoon) took the two boats and,
having found a "salt inlet," rowed up for some 2&frac12; (English) miles. The
probability is that he searched to the south for an inlet, the coast-line to
the north having already been seen from the ship the day before. Assuming the
anchorage to have been 17&deg; 10', there were only 4 (English) miles to go
before falling in with ACCIDENT INLET, in 17&deg; 12', one of the mouths of the
Gilbert River. It was this inlet, there is every reason to believe, which was
named the STATEN REVIER. It would have been 9 (English) miles from the
anchorage to the nearest inlet to the north, <i>viz.</i>, the (erroneously
named) Van Diemen Revier (17&deg; 3' S.), which is another mouth of the
Gilbert, known inland as the Smithburne River, and the 18 miles of rowing at
sea, added to 4 on the inlet, would have taken so much of the afternoon that
the landing party would not have had daylight enough to do all that they did on
shore.</p>
<p>There is no ground whatever, now that we have the information furnished by
the log of the "<i>Pera</i>," for continuing to hold the belief embodied in
Flinders' chart (1802) and all subsequent official maps, that the
"<i>Pera's</i>" Staten River runs into the Gulf of Carpentaria between
latitudes 15&deg; 24' and 15&deg; 30' S.</p>
<p>The party left the boat and walked some distance, over country which was
partly "under water"&mdash;presumably stagnant salt water, lying in "claypans."
Thereafter they scratched an inscription on a wooden slab, which they nailed to
a tree before returning to the ship.&mdash;R.L.J.]</p>

<p>[EDITORIAL NOTE.&mdash;The inlet, in lat. 16&deg; 10', named the NASSAU by
Carstenszoon was, no doubt, the mouth of the unnamed creek between Leichhardt's
"Rocky Creek" and the "Staaten River" of modern land maps. The creek in
question has been traced from east to west through the pastoral blocks Rocky
No. 2, Wynola No. 4 and Wynola No. 3 for a distance of about 13 miles. It may
be referred to as the NASSAU de jure, to distinguish it from the NASSAU <i>de
facto</i>, which falls into the Gulf in lat. 15&deg;55'. The lower course of
the Nassau <i>de facto</i> has been named the Nassau from an erroneous
identification of it with the Nassau <i>de jure</i>, while its upper course is
known as Dunbar Creek. This creek or river is one of the mouths of Leichhardt's
MITCHELL RIVER.</p>
<p>The Nassau <i>de jure</i> traverses the continuous deltas of the Mitchell
and the Staaten <i>de facto</i>, and in times of high flood would probably be
found to be connected with both rivers, as in the whole of this coastal flat
the mouths of the large rivers anastomose in a manner which could only be
satisfactorily traced in flood seasons (when nobody goes there) with the aid of
a canoe. It is, perhaps, more likely that a canoe survey would prove the Nassau
<i>de jure</i> to be a trickle emanating from the Mitchell River than from the
Staten River <i>de facto</i>.</p>
<p>Although it is quite clear that the inland rivers have, in many cases, been
erroneously identified with the "reviers," or inlets,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 47}</u></p>
<p>named by the Dutch navigators, a wholesale RENAMING of the rivers would be
IMPRACTICABLE at the present day. The names of the inland rivers have been
irrevocably fixed by the fact that they have entered into history, into
literature, into official maps, proclamations and other documents, and even
into title deeds. In the circumstances, all that can now be done is to
distinguish between the inlets named by the Dutch (<i>de jure</i>) and the
watercourses to which the Dutch names have been erroneously applied in the
first place, to be afterwards sanctioned by usage (<i>de facto</i>). It must,
however, be clearly understood that the <i>de facto</i> names are not names
conferred by the Dutch navigators, but names given in compliment to
them.&mdash;R.L.J.]</p>

was seized round the waist by the skipper, and then the quartermaster threw a
noose round his neck, by which he was dragged to the boat. The others, seeing
this, tried to help the captive, furiously throwing their assegais, so that, in
our defence, one of them was shot dead, and the others ran away, upon which we

<p>[EDITORIAL NOTE.&mdash;It is quite clear from the narrative that the
"<i>Pera</i>" anchored on 7th May in lat. 13&deg; 7', and that on the following
morning a party landed, probably on a beach, and without having observed any
inlet, but having found human footprints, followed them north to a river which
they named the COEN (the COEN, <i>de jure</i>). <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> Nothing is said as to whether the water was fresh or
salt, the only observation made being that the neighbourhood yielded esculent
herbs (pigweed). There cannot be a river of any importance in this locality, as
the Ward River, running from north to south, a few miles to the east, restricts
the possible catchment area of the Coen within very narrow limits.</p>
<p>The name Coen has been irrevocably attached to a river (the COEN, <i>de
facto</i>) rising near the Pacific coast in lat. 13&deg; 50' and which falls
into the still larger Archer River, which empties into the Gulf of Carpentaria
in 13&deg; 20'. GOLD was found in this river in 1876, by a party of
prospectors, who erroneously identified it with Carstenszoon's Coen River. The
establishment of a township named Coen, with a post and telegraph office,
followed in due course. As it had become impossible to confer a new name on the
Coen, <i>de facto</i>, the Survey Office has begun to call the river of the
goldfield the SOUTH COEN, to distinguish it from the COEN, <i>de jure</i>,
which it would be an historical injustice to omit from the map. It remains to
be seen whether the name of South Coen will receive popular recognition.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that the landing party had for their walk north and south
only the time between daylight and noon, when they returned to the
"<i>Pera</i>," less the time taken by (breakfast?), rowing ashore, tracking the
footprints, gathering herbs, fighting</p>
<blockquote>[1) In the course of the "<i>Investigator's</i>" survey, FLINDERS
landed on 7th November, 1802, at an inlet in 12&deg; 13' S., which he described
in his Chart as "INLET, PROBABLY COEN R. OF THE OLD CHARTS." It was a most
unfortunate misidentification, which has given rise to much confusion. What
Flinders took to be the "COEN RIVER of the old charts" is now charted as the
PENNEFATHER RIVER, but had been called the Prince Revier by Tasman in.

<p>and rowing to the ship. It was just after noon when they came alongside, and
the latitude of the anchorage (13&deg; 7' S.) having been taken, the anchor was
lifted, and the "<i>Pera</i> "resumed her northward voyage. I conclude that
they walked about four miles north, and the same distance back,. which would
put the COEN RIVER in 13&deg; 4' S. latitude. MR. N. HEY, of the Mapoon
Mission, informs me that <i>precisely in this position</i> is a creek, which is
the only watercourse between False Pera Head (12&deg; 58' S.), and the mouth of
Ina Creek (13&deg; 12' S.). This must be CARSTENSZOON'S COEN REVIER. The
subject is discussed in greater detail in the chapters devoted to Mr. J. T.
Embley's Explorations and Surveys and Missionary Explorations.</p>
<p>It may be noted here that Flinders' "Chart of Terra Australis," 1802-3
(Admiralty Chart No. 1043), gives the name of "False Pera Head" to a small
promontory in lat. 13&deg; 7', while on Sheet 20D of the modern 4-mile map of
Queensland issued by the Department of Lands the name is given to a promontory
about 3 minutes south of Pera Head, which is in 12&deg; 55'. Although I am not
aware on what ground the change was made, I accept it as authoritative,
especially as what Flinders called False Pera Head had been named RIJDER'S HOEK
in 1756 by JEAN ETIENNE GONZAL.&mdash;R.L.J.]</p>
<p>NOTE IN THE DIARY.&mdash;" Wherever we have landed, we have treated the
blacks or savages with especial kindness by every means in our power, such as
offering them presents of iron, beads and cloth, so as by this pretence to win
their friendship and be allowed to penetrate some distance inland and make a
reliable report on what we saw. But, notwithstanding all this care and fair
seeming,<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> the blacks everywhere met us with the
most marked hostility, so that in most places our landings were attended with
great peril. Thus, and for various other reasons afterwards to be mentioned, it
has not been possible to learn how Nova Guinea is populated, what sort of
people and soil there are, what towns, what inhabited villages, what
distribution of wealth, what religion, what politics, what preparation for war,
what waters, what shipping, what raw materials, what manufactures, or what ores
of gold, silver, tin, iron, lead, copper or quicksilver are to be had. In the
first place, in any further landings, we should have to look out for rain
which, at times when need for muskets might arise, would be very damaging to
them, whereas the weapons of the savages would not be injuriously affected.
Secondly, the paths and roads, which are unknown to us, would have to be
surveyed. Thirdly, we might easily, seeing the number of the blacks, be
surrounded and cut off from the boats, and then the boats' crews which we
always employed in the landings, but who could not be depended upon in the use
of their weapons, would have been</p>

<p>in danger. If, on the other hand, we could make use of trained and proved
soldiers (who are really necessary on such an expedition), we might make good
reddings and scourings.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Still, in spite of all
these obstacles and difficulties, we have spared neither labour, trouble nor
risk, with the means at our command, to inquire into everything, for our honour
and reputation, and that nothing may pass unmarked, the following are the
results of our investigations:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The land between 13&deg; and 17&deg; 8' is a dry and barren tract, without
any fruit trees or anything that man could make use of. It is low and flat,
without mountains or heights, overgrown in many places with scrub and stunted
timber, with little fresh water and what there is must be collected in holes
dug for the purpose. There is also an entire absence of capes or inlets, except
for a few bights not sheltered from the sea winds. It extends mainly N. by E.
and S. by W., with clay- and sand-bottomed shoals, with numerous salt inlets
extending into the interior, across which the natives ferry their women and
children by means of dry logs or boughs of trees. The men are in general utter
barbarians and built very much alike as to shape and features, pitch black and
stark naked, with a braided net on head or neck for keeping their food in, the
same consisting, so far as we could make out, of roots which they dig out of
the earth, very evil-smelling. Their residences or dwelling-places appeared to
us to be on the beaches during the easterly monsoons, as there we saw numerous
huts made of hay. We also saw many dogs, herons and water curlews and other
wild fowl, and also delicate fish, which may easily be caught with a seine net.
They have absolutely no acquaintance with gold, silver, tin, iron, lead or
copper, nor even with nutmegs, cloves or pepper, all of which we repeatedly
showed them without their evincing any sign of recognising or setting any value
on the same. From all of which, taken together with the rest of our
observations, it may safely be concluded that they are poor and miserable
creatures who prize most such things as iron and beads. Their weapons are
shields, assegais and callaways, of the length of I+ fathoms, made of light
wood and cane, some with fish-bones and others with human bones fastened to
them. As we discovered, they are particularly expert in throwing them by means
of a stick half a fathom in length, on which a hook is bound, so as to catch
the upper part of the callaway or assegai."</p>

<p>[EDITORIAL NOTE.&mdash;The latitude of 12&deg; 33' is, not 2, but 8&frac12;
Dutch miles north of the anchorage at the Coen, <i>de jure</i>. It is evident
from what follows that the midday ANCHORAGE of 9th May was still SOUTH of
ALBATROSS BAY, and the distance named (2 Dutch miles) would bring the
"<i>Pera</i>" to what is now known as PERA HEAD, which is in 12&deg; 55',
according to the modern Lands Department map. In deciphering the manuscript,
some transcriber, no doubt, mistook the figures 55 for 33.</p>
<p>The latest issue (1908) of the 4-mile Sheet 20D of the Department of Lands
shows a small creek falling into the Gulf in 12&deg; 59' S. lat. In this
position, says MR. N. HEY (in a letter dated 5th February, 1919), there is
only, in wet weather, a SMALL RUNNEL OF FRESH WATER, which could not be called
a creek. It is, I have no doubt, the "WATERPLAETS" of 9th May, 1623, regarding
which MR. J. T. EMBLEY has given me the following additional particulars, in a
letter dated 10th August, 1916: "The Waterplaets is at Pera Head. These
headlands are about 80 feet high and consist of soft reddish and whitish
sandstone. The red is most conspicuous, as being uppermost, and gives rise to
the expression low reddish cliffs 'as in the sea chart and land maps. After the
wet season&mdash;April and May&mdash;small SOAKAGES OF FRESH WATER may be
noticed oozing out from the base, and it is this which must have given rise to
the WATERPLAETS.'"]</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"In the afternoon," continues Carstenszoon, "wind
SW., course as before. From the aforesaid watering-place to a high hook, or
cape [DUYFKEN POINT.&mdash;R.L.J.], is a great bight [ALBATROSS

<p>[EDITORIAL NOTE.&mdash;This night anchorage was in ALBATROSS BAY, and,
judging by the course on which next day's journey had to be begun, so as to
clear Duyfken Point, outside of the shoals which guard the mouths of the Embley
and Mission Rivers. It is singular that Carstenszoon gave no name to the bay,
nor to its two "horns," Pera Head and Duyfken Point. On 26th April, 1756,
Lavienne Lodowijk van Asschens, in charge of the "<i>Buijs</i>," recognised the
bay as that which TASMAN, in 1644, had named VLIEGEBAAIJ, and on 31st May,
1756, Lieut. Jean Etienne Gonzal, commanding the "<i>Rijder</i>," called it
MOSSELBAAIJ. The name now current was that of the Queensland Government's

to throw, and evidently very distrustful, for, though pieces of iron and other
things were thrown to them, they would not stop to parley, but tried every
trick with the object of wounding and capturing one of our men. This compelled
us to fire one or two shots to frighten them, one of them being hit in the
breast and carried to the boat, while all the others retired into the sand
dunes. In their wretched huts on the beach we found nothing but a four-edged
assegai, two or three little stones, and some human bones, with which they make
and scrape their weapons. We also found a quantity of resin and a piece of
metal, which the wounded man had in his net, and which had probably been got
from the '<i>Duyfken's</i>' men. At last, there being nothing more to be done
here, we turned back to go aboard the ship, the wounded man dying on the
way."</blockquote>
<p>[EDITORIAL NOTE.&mdash;We are now confronted with the most difficult problem
raised by the narrative of the "<i>Pera's</i>" eventful voyage, <i>viz.</i>,
the identification of the "reviers" Batavia and Carpentier.</p>
<p>It will be readily conceded that the diary for 11th May, 1623, proves that
the navigators of the "<i>Pera</i>" were familiar with the charts of the
"<i>Duyfken</i>," which were undoubtedly then extant. They probably carried
copies with them, and would naturally make them their daily study.</p>
<p>Our difficulties begin with the discovery of the "Chart by the Upper
Steersman Arend Martensz(oon) DE LEEUW, who took part in the Voyage," in the
State archives at the Hague. The chart has no date, but it may be taken for
granted that it was compiled prior to 1630, since in that year, Kepler and
Eekerbrecht's map followed de Leeuw's in naming the Carpentier Revier the
Batavia. It is not stated to what voyage reference is made in the title of de
Leeuw's chart, but there can be no doubt that the "<i>Pera's</i>" voyage is
indicated. The chart is reproduced in <i>Remarkable Maps</i>, II, 5, and (on a
reduced scale) by Heeres (p. 46).</p>
<p>I offer the following as a fair and unbiassed paraphrase of the diary of
11th May, 1623:&mdash;</p>
<p>In the morning of the 11th, we left the anchorage at 12&deg; 5', and, with
good weather and a favourable wind (ESE.), sailed NNE. along the land. Observed
the sun at noon and made the latitude</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 54}</u></p>
<p>11&deg; 48'. North of this latitude, and in the afternoon, having passed a
large inlet, which we identified as that where the <i>Duyfken</i>' had one of
her men killed, and which we named the REVIER DE CARPENTIER (Carpentier Inlet),
we dropped the anchor. We landed here next morning..."</p>
<p>The mouth of a river, now known as the SKARDON, enters the Gulf in 11&deg;
45', and everything points to this having been the inlet which Carstenszoon
named the Carpentier.</p>
<p>It is very strange that the "<i>Pera</i>" should have passed, without
remark, the entrance to PORT MUSGRAVE, which is practically the estuary of the
great river which Tasman was the first to notice in 1644 and to which Asschens,
in 1756, gave the name of BATAVIA, no doubt believing it to be de Leeuw's
Batavia, that is to say, Carstenszoon's Carpentier. According to Mr. J. T.
Embley, who is very familiar with the aspect of this portion of the coast, the
entrance to Port Musgrave could hardly be missed by a ship passing in daylight
and fine weather. Perhaps it was not unobserved by the officers of the
"<i>Pera</i>," but the true explanation of their silence regarding it may lie
in their anxiety to make northing, coupled with the fact that they were making
good progress and the consideration that they passed the entrance too early in
the day to be willing to stop. On the other hand, the identification, later in
the day, of the inlet which had been the scene of the "<i>Duyfken's</i>" mishap
formed a perfectly sound reason for a halt with the object of making
observations on shore.</p>
<p>Returning to DE LEEUW'S CHART: it bears, to my thinking, internal evidence
of having been constructed&mdash;perhaps by request&mdash;some time after the
conclusion of the voyage, and from memory, possibly with the aid of notes, by a
man who had not, at the time, access to the ship's log or diary, or to the
authentic newly made chart so often referred to therein. The following table
shows, by means of parallel columns, how imperfect was de Leeuw's knowledge (or
recollection) of the positions of the various inlets referred to in the
log.</p>

<p>The watering-place at PERA HEAD, north of the Coen River, to which de Leeuw
assigned the latitude of 13&deg; 5' (correctly, 12&deg; 55') is one of the
localities where de Leeuw and the "<i>Pera's</i>" log evidently mean the same
thing. North of this watering-place de Leeuw shows a bay, at the head of which
his supposed "REVIE R DE BATAVIA falls in. This bay (ALBATROSS BAY) is now
known to be entered by the Embley and Mission, both considerable rivers, and
although de Leeuw may have been justified in conjecturing that at least one
river would enter the bay, it is more than doubtful if he could see either the
Embley or the Mission. In any case, he had no authority to name this
hypothetical river, or any other.</p>
<p>The captain of the "<i>Pera</i>" had his authority very much curtailed by
the "Full Council," and even Carstenszoon had to bow to its decisions. It is
quite possible that de Leeuw's memory, when he made his sketch-chart, may have
recalled a discussion in the Council in the course of which the name Batavia
was suggested, but the log leaves no room for doubt that the name Carpentier
was finally adopted for the inlet identified with the "<i>Duyfken's</i>"
misfortune.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, de Leeuw "got the ear" of cartographers, so that the name of
Batavia appeared on Dutch maps long before Asschens gave that name (in 1756) to
the river which enters the Gulf at Port Musgrave.&mdash;R.L.J.]</p>

an inlet (revier), which, in the chart, we have entitled the REVIER VAN SPULT.
[SEE MAP A.] On the 14th, sailed before daylight, wind SE., steady weather.
From the 9th of this month up to date, we have found the land of Nova Guinea to
stretch NNE. to SSW., and from here onwards N. and S. Here [while the ship
stood by under short sail] I, personally, rowed to the land, with the skipper
and to musketeers, and saw many human footprints and tracks of dogs (going
southwards) and also a very fine fresh water river which runs out into the sea,
whence water could conveniently be taken by boats or pinnaces, and which lies
in 10&deg; 50' latitude, and is noted in the chart as DE WATERPLAETS (the
Watering-place). The land is high and duny (sand dunes), with reefs in front of
the sandy beach. Seeing that no service could be done, or profit made, here, we
returned to the yacht (which was standing by with shortened sail)." [SEE MAPS B
AND A.]</blockquote>
<p>[EDITORIAL NOTE.&mdash;There is no reason to question the correctness of the
observation for latitude (11&deg; 16') made at noon on 13th May. The anchorage
for that night, which was "near" an inlet from which fresh water was running
out to sea, and which was named VAN SPULT, is another matter. The "<i>Pera</i>"
dropped her anchor in the evening of the 13th, and sailed before daylight</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 56}</u></p>
<p>of the 14th, so that there was no opportunity for a solar observation.</p>
<p>The latitude attributed to the anchorage at the Van Spult Inlet must
therefore have been more or less of a guess based upon dead reckoning. The
guess made by the navigators was 10&deg; 50'. Carstenszoon must have
overestimated the distance sailed in the afternoon of the 13th. Had the
"<i>Pera</i>" reached the latitude of 10&deg; 50', Barn Island and Red Island
could not have escaped observation, and indeed the high land of Prince of Wales
Island must have appeared a much more striking object than the low-lying
mainland. In view of what took place on the following day (14th May), the
probability is that the observed inlet was where the modern chart shows a
breach in the coast-line, in 10&deg; 59'. The Van Spult is, therefore, probably
a mouth of the JARDINE RIVER. The principal channel of that river (which has
been carefully surveyed almost to its head), discharges into the Gulf in
10&deg; 54', and the Jardine Brothers, in 1865, found the tide to flow up it
for about 6 miles, even in a very wet season. It is quite possible, however,
that another mouth, that named the Van Spult, carries fresh water down to the
beach. The point could easily be settled, even by a party on foot, as the inlet
is, apparently, not more than 10 miles west of Jardine's crossing of the river
at his camp 87. After the landing party rejoined the "<i>Pera</i>" on 14th May,
1623, the narrative continues as follows.&mdash;R.L.J.]</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Towards evening [14th May], we were about one mile
from three little islands, of which the southmost was the largest [WOODY and
WALLIS ISLANDS] and some 5 miles [20 minutes] to the north, by our estimate,
was mountainous land [PRINCE OF WALES ISLAND], which, however, it was
impossible to approach by reason of shoals; for in almost every direction in
which we took soundings very shallow water was found, and we sailed for a long
time over 5, 4, 3, 2&frac12;, 2 and 1&frac12; fathoms, or even less, and at
last were obliged to anchor in fathoms, without knowing where to look for
greater or less depths. After sunset, therefore, we sent out the boat to take
soundings, and water deeper than 2, 3 and 4&frac12; fathoms was found, to
which, very well pleased, we brought the yacht, and anchored in 8 fathoms,
thanking God Almighty for His unspeakable grace and mercy on this occasion, as
on all others.<br>
<br>
"In the morning of the 15th, the wind SE., good weather, thereupon set sail,
course W., which took us into shallower water, such as 2, 2&frac12;. and 3
fathoms; altered course to SW., where we had 3&frac12;, 4, 5 and 6 fathoms, or
more. Lost sight of the land, which, because of the shoals, reefs and banks, as
well as of the easterly winds, it was not possible to reach and follow further.
This was agreed to, and it was resolved&mdash;to avoid all the obvious dangers
which would be encountered if we continued to coast the land any
longer&mdash;to TURN BACK and, firstly to shape our course for the Yleermuis
Eijlant. We therefore stood out to sea, westwards, in 9&frac12; fathoms and
upwards, and, keeping west, made 17 miles [68 minutes] in 24 hours, finding no
bottom in 27 fathoms.<br>

"NOTE.&mdash;That in our landings between 13&deg; and 11&deg;, we only saw
blacks or savages twice, and that they received us with even greater hostility
than had the men further south; also that they have some knowledge of muskets,
of which, apparently, they had learned, to their great cost, from the men of
the '<i>Duyfken</i>,' who landed here in the year 1606.]</blockquote>

<h4>THE VOYAGE OF THE "PERA" AND "AERNEM" (1623), continued</h4>
<p><b>V. THE "AERNEM"</b></p>
<p>CARELESS LANDING ON NEW GUINEA COAST. SKIPPER AND NINE MEN KILLED AND SOME
WOUNDED BY NATIVES. "AERNEM'S" INFERIOR SAILING QUALITIES. HER DESERTION OF THE
"PERA." CROSSES GULF OF CARPENTARIA. GROOTE ISLAND. ARNHEIM LAND.</p>
<p>No reader of Carstenszoon's narrative can fail to observe that although the
"<i>Aernem</i>" was inferior in sailing qualities to her consort, the
"<i>Pera</i>," she was expected to keep up with her, and that her failure to do
so was the cause of much friction between the officers of the two ships.</p>
<p>Before the expedition left the shores of NEW GUINEA proper, and
approximately in 4&deg; 20' S. lat., the "<i>Aernem</i>" met with a DISASTER
which is related by Carstenszoon under date 11th February, 1623:-</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The same day the skipper of the yacht
"<i>Aernem</i>," DIRCK MELISZOON, without the knowledge of myself or of the
supercargo or first mate of the said yacht, unadvisedly rowed to the open beach
in the boat, with fifteen persons, officers and hands, with only four muskets,
with the object of fishing. There was great disorder in landing, the men
running off in different directions, and presently the BLACKS issued savagely
from the bush and, to begin with, SEIZED an assistant named JAN WILLENS(ZOON)
VAN DEN BRIEL, who was unarmed, and dragged him away from the others, and so
forth, without our people having been able to resist or shoot. Next, with
arrows, callaways and oars which they took out of the boat, they SLEW no less
than NINE of our men and WOUNDED the remaining SEVEN (among them the SKIPPER,
who was the first to run away), who by a miracle, and by means of the boat and
a single oar, returned to the ship in a sorry plight, the skipper loudly
lamenting his gross imprudence and begging forgiveness for the fault he had
committed."</blockquote>
<p>He DIED next day, and was succeeded by WILLEM JOOSTEN VAN COOLSTEERDT,
second mate of the "<i>Pera</i>."</p>
<p>The return voyage had barely commenced when the "<i>Aernem</i>" once more
lagged behind (27th April, 1623) before dark, and the "<i>Pera</i>" saw her no
more. (SEE MAP H.) The latter was then at anchor off the coast of the Cape York
Peninsula, in about 16&deg; 25' S. lat. Carstenszoon, in his diary, accuses the
"<i>Aernem</i>" of deliberate desertion because her men had no liking for the
business, and he believed they desired to have "a good time" at Aru, where,
apparently, the natives were kind. It is, indeed, more than likely</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 60}</u></p>
<p>that the "<i>Aernem's</i>" complement were heartily tired of the voyage,
which brought them daily recrimination on account of the shortcomings of their
vessel, for which they were not to blame. They had hardships enough, saw no
chance of profit for themselves and were condemned to play the unenviable part
of second fiddle. On the other hand, it is probable that the "jury" rudder was
lost, in which case (the wind being SE. by E.), the ship would have to stand
out to sea, and in course of time some other substitute for a rudder would have
to be rigged up. At any rate, ISACK DE BRUNE, Governor of BANDA, reported to
the Governor-General, PIETER DE CARPENTIER, that on 14th May a ship was
sighted, which proved to be the "<i>Aernem</i>," and that she had lost her
rudder on the 13th.</p>
<p>No report of the "<i>Aernem</i>'s" voyage is known to exist, and with her
parting from the "<i>Pera</i>" she passes out of the region with which we are
dealing. HEERES, who has thoroughly investigated the whole of the available
documentary evidence, comes to the conclusion that the first land she saw was
GROOTE EYLAND and that afterwards she skirted the north-western horn of the
Gulf of Carpentaria, forming the northern portion (now known as ARNHEM LAND) of
the "Northern Territory" of Australia.</p>

<p>Of all her gallant sailors there is none of whom Holland has more reason to
be proud than of ABEL JANSZOON TASMAN. In many voyages of discovery he rendered
signal services to his country. Only two of these, however, come within the
scope of our inquiry.</p>
<p>Prior to the first of these voyages, the western and a portion of the
southern shores of Australia were already known, but the theory that the South
Land formed part of a great antarctic continent had yet to be disproved. In
1642-3, Tasman demonstrated the INSULARITY OF "NEW HOLLAND" by sailing round
it, although at a great distance, with Batavia as his starting- and
finishing-post. He touched TASMANIA (named by him Van Diemen's Land) and
rounded its southern end, believing it to be the southern limit of the South
Land, now to be called New Holland. Thence he sailed eastward to NEW ZEALAND,
which he coasted to the north. He returned to Batavia <i>via</i> the Friendly
Islands, Fiji and the north coast of NEW GUINEA, which he believed to be the
northmost part of New Holland. Tasman's journal is extant and relates, with
painstaking industry, the minutest details of his remarkable voyage.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 62}</u></p>
<p>The voyage which mainly concerns us is that of 1644. The
INSTRUCTIONS<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> of the Governor-General and
Council of the Dutch East India Company were drawn up at Batavia on 13th
January, 1644, and were signed by Antonie Van Diemen, Cornelis Van Der Lijn
(Director-General), Joan Maetsuijker, Justus Schouten
("Councillor-Extraordinary to the present assembly"), Salomon Sweers, and
Pieter Metschagh (Secretary).</p>
<p>The ships employed in the expedition were the yachts "<i>Limmen</i>" and
"<i>Zeemeeuw</i>" and the galiot "Bracq," and their respective complements
were:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
"Limmen"    45 sailors, 11 soldiers = 56
"Zeemeeuw"  35           6          = 41
"Bracq"     14                      = 14

                                     &mdash;-
</pre>
<p>From the instructions and a list of members of the Full Council, we gather
how each of the ships was officered:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Limmen</i>". Commander and Skipper, Abel Janszoon Tasman. Assistant
Skipper, Pilot-Major Francois Jacobszoon Visscher. Mate, Crin Hendrikszoon.
Trader (Assistant Supercargo), Counsel and Secretary, Anthonio Blauw.</p>
<p>"<i>Zeemeeuw</i>." Skipper, Dirck Corneliszoon Haen. Supercargo, Isaac
Gilesemans. Mate, Carsten Jeuraenszoon.</p>
<p>"Bracq." Skipper, Jasper Janszoon Koos. Mate,. Cornelis Robel.</p>
<p>When matters concerning navigation were to be discussed in the FULL COUNCIL,
the second mates were to be called in. Councils of individual ships were to
consist of the officers, to whom were to be added the Assistant Supercargoes or
book-keepers and the master-boatswains. The minutes of the Full Council were to
be made out in triplicate.</p>
<p>The fleet left BATAVIA on 30th January, and returned to that port on l0th
August, 1644.</p>
<p>The SAILING ORDERS began with a preamble recapitulating the achievements of
previous navigators in the region to be visited, and to this narrative we are
indebted, <i>inter alia</i>, in default of the "<i>Duyfken's</i>" journal and
charts, for some of our scanty information regarding her disastrous pioneering
voyage along the coast of the Cape York Peninsula.</p>
<p>The orders were first to go to Banda and there to take in water and firewood
and to obtain such information regarding "New</p>

Major's <i>Early Voyages</i>, in Heeres' <i>Life of Tasman</i> and (partly) in
Heeres' <i>Part borne by the Dutch,</i> etc.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 63}</u></p>
<p>Guinea" as could be supplied by the Vice-Governor, who, it was said, was
likely to have a copy of CARSTENSZOON'S JOURNAL of the "<i>Pera</i>" and
<i>Aernem</i>" expedition. This shows that, in 1644, the journal was not
obtainable in Batavia; and it may be assumed that the "<i>Pera's</i>" chart was
also missing. Tasman, therefore, unless he succeeded in obtaining copies in
Banda, must have started on his voyage of exploration without these documents
which were so essential to his success in identifying the localities visited
and charted by Carstenszoon.</p>
<p>After leaving Banda, Tasman was instructed to make for FALSE CAPE, on the
New Guinea coast; to follow the coast east to 9&deg; S. latitude; cautiously to
clear the shoals (the so-called "DROOGE BOCHT," the entrance to TORRES STRAIT);
to anchor near the High Island (PRINCE OF WALES ISLAND) or the SPEULT RIVER and
to send the "<i>Bracq</i>" into the bight to make one more search for the
alleged (and actual) passage. Having settled this point, he was to skirt the
west coast of "New Guinea" southward to the FURTHEST KNOWN POINT, about 17&deg;
S. latitude. Thence he was to follow the coast and connect the coast-line
charted by Carstenszoon with the "VAN DIEMEN'S LAND" discovered by himself and
supposed to be the southern extremity of the "South Land." He was, however, to
carry out only as much of this programme as time would permit; but, in any
case, he was to be back in Batavia, <i>via</i> Sunda Strait, "by June or
July."</p>
<p>The expedition, as we have seen, returned to Batavia on 10th August, and we
are justified in assuming that the instructions were obeyed, although the
carrying out of the full programme was impossible. As a matter of fact, Tasman
had only followed the Australian coast (already to some extent known) to the
Tropic of Capricorn when the prescribed time-limit compelled him to make for
Batavia. Considerable portions of the Australian coast west of where the
"<i>Pera</i>" turned back had already, however, been discovered and more or
less charted from twenty-eight to twenty-one years before; so that Tasman's
achievement consisted of a demonstration of the CONTINUITY OF THE LAND from the
44 Drooge Bocht (Torres Strait) to the Tropic of Capricorn. His contributions
to cartography were chiefly the southern and western shores of the GULF OF
CARPENTARIA and the coast-line from Melville Island to the Tropic of
Capricorn.</p>
<p>A clause in the instructions (perhaps mere routine) empowered Tasman to take
possession of new discoveries and to enter into Treaties. There is nothing to
show that either power was exercised. The tone of contemporary official
references to the expedition gives the impression that the Dutch East India
Company regarded it as having been only moderately successful and as having
failed to add materially to the Company's assets. The presumption is that
Tasman did not claim to have discovered any land of value or to</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 64}</u></p>
<p>have fallen in with any potentates with whom it was worth his while to
conclude alliances.</p>
<p>Before leaving Batavia, Tasman was supplied with a SPECIALLY PREPARED CHART,
which, no doubt, showed all that was known of the south coast of New Guinea (as
we know the island to-day) and the north, west and south coasts of Australia.
There is reason to believe that, as regards previous exploration of the coast
of the Cape York Peninsula, this chart was very imperfect.</p>
<p>In a report under date 23rd December, 164, signed by Van Dieman, Van der
Lijn, Sweers, Crooq and Van Alpen (President), representing the Governor and
Council of the Dutch East India Company, and addressed to "The Noble,
Worshipful, Provident and Very Discreet Gentlemen" (The Directors of the
Company in Holland), it is stated that Tasman's expedition, after leaving
Bantam on 29th February, 1644, "followed the coast-line, but found NO OPEN
CHANNEL between the half-known Nova Guinea and the known land of Eendracht or
Willem's River in 22&frac12;&deg; S. latitude and 119&deg; longitude.<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> They, however, found a large, spacious BAY OR GULF, as
shown in the annexed CHART AND JOURNALS. Nor did they make any profit by
bartering, having only met with naked, beach-roaming wretches, destitute of
rice and not possessed of any fruits worth mentioning, excessively poor and in
many places of a very malignant nature, as Your Worships may in great detail
gather from the BATAVIA MINUTES, in which are recorded the courses kept and the
incidents of the voyage, under date 4th, 5th and 10th August last, at which
time the said Tasman returned to our port through Sunda Strait, from the
latitude and longitude aforesaid of the South Land (having continually sailed
in shallow water along the coast)...This vast and hitherto unknown South Land
has by the said Tasman been sailed round in two voyages and is computed to
comprise 2,000 miles of land, as shown by the delineation of the Charts, which
we subjoin for Your Worships' inspection."</p>
<p>Whatever became of Tasman's journal, it has not come down to us. There is,
however, a CHART, on the scale of 1 cm. to a degree of longitude, showing
Tasman's routes in 1642-3 and 1644, entitled "Company's New Netherlands. To the
east the large Land of Nova Guinea forming one land with the first-known South
Land, and all of it joined together, as may be seen from the dotted course-line
of the Yachts '<i>Limmen</i>' and <i>Zeemeeuw</i>' and the Galiot
'<i>Bracq</i>' anno 1644." A further inscription says: "This Work has been put
together out of divers Writings, together with Personal Observations by Abel
Janszoon Tasman anno Domini 1644." The chart shows a continuous New Guinea and
Cape York Peninsula, with a shallow bight between. PROFESSOR HEERES,</p>
<blockquote>[1) Actually 113&deg; E. The Dutch of this period reckoned
longitude from the meridian of the Peak of Teneriffe, which is 16&deg; 46' W.
of Greenwich.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 65}</u></p>
<p>in his great work, <i>The Life of Tasman</i>,<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> describes it as having been "drawn-up immediately,
after the (1644) expedition and under the eye of Tasman himself." It may,
indeed, be a copy of the chart forwarded with the Report by the
Governor-General and Council at Batavia to the Directors in Holland. It was
reproduced by JACOB SWART in his <i>Journaal van de Reis nar het Onbekende
Zuidland in den Jare 1642 door Abel Janszoon Tasman</i> (<i>Amsterdam</i>,
1860), and HEERES, in his <i>Life of Tasman</i> gives a version of it, with the
place-names and other inscriptions translated into English.</p>
<p>The names along the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula in the charts
reproduced by Swart and Heeres are as in Column I of the table below, and the
latitudes as in Columns II and III; but the small scale of the map, together
with a "personal equation" resulting from mechanical differences in drawing
between the two maps, makes it impossible, in some cases, to be certain of the
positions indicated within a few minutes of latitude.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 66}</u></p>
<p>It would be of great assistance to know whether or not Tasman succeeded in
getting Carstenszoon's diary and charts from the Vice-Governor at Banda. I am
inclined to think that he left Banda without these important documents<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and had to rely entirely on the general chart with
which he was furnished at Batavia. Had he been able to refer to the original
report and chart, he would surely have adopted for the northmost
"Watering-place" at which he touched, Carstenszoon's name of "Van Spult
Revier." The question arises, was the sketch-chart made by de Leeuw, mate of
the "<i>Pera</i>," prepared for the guidance of Tasman? I conclude that it
could not have been, or Tasman would have used de Leeuw's name of "Batavia
Revier" instead of Carstenszoon's "Carpentier."</p>
<p>The note at 17&deg; S. latitude, on Tasman's 1644 chart, which may be freely
translated: "Some people have been as far as this," was, in all probability, of
the nature of an instruction. To that point the coast had been explored, and it
was in Tasman's discretion (I) to hurry past it and begin where Carstenszoon
left off, or (2) to land from time to time for the purpose of verifying
Carstenszoon's report. His decision would depend upon how much time he was
prepared to spend on an already-known coast.</p>
<p>In all probability, he landed, or at least anchored, in several places on
the coast of the Cape York Peninsula short of previous explorers' furthest
south, as he makes observations, or leaves names, which he could not possibly
have got from pre-existing charts, e.g., the Prince Revier 12&deg; 12'), the
Revier mit Bosch (12&deg; 30' or 12&deg; 33'), Vliege Baij (13&deg; 12'),
Visscher's Revier (13&deg; 42', named after his Assistant Skipper) and the Pera
Revier (16&deg; 15'). It remains for us to consider the places named by Tasman,
one by one, in their order from north to south.</p>
<p>Having given the shoals of the "Drooge Bocht" a wide berth, the first
position noted in Cape York Peninsula is the WATER PLAETS to which the latitude
of 11&deg; S. is assigned.</p>
<p>Carstenszoon, in the "<i>Pera</i>," on 14th May, 1623, noted an inlet (SEE
MAP A) which he named "WATERING-PLACE" and also "REVIER VAN SPULT," in, as he
said, 10&deg; 50' S. lat. For reasons already given, I have pointed out that
this (which is the latitude of Red Island) is impossible, and that the Van
Spult Inlet must be a mouth of the Jardine River, and in, or about, 10&deg; 59'
S. Carstenszoon having described it as an ideal watering-place, where fresh
water could be taken up in buckets lowered from ships, Tasman was likely enough
to have paid it a visit, especially if he needed water. If he really found and
identified it, he was practically</p>
<blockquote>[1) My son, R. Lockhart Jack, suggests that if Tasman had a
difficulty in obtaining the "<i>Pera's</i>" charts, he would endeavour to
enlist and carry with him some of the "<i>Pera's</i>" old sailors, in the hope
of getting from them assistance in the identification of Carstenszoon's
reviers.&mdash;R.L.J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 67}</u></p>
<p>correct in placing it in 11&deg;. But why did he not 'adopt Carstenszoon's
name of "Van Spult"?</p>
<p>The next position noted by Tasman is the "STAETEN REVIER," in 11&deg; 50'
(Swart) or 11&deg; 54' (Heeres). (SEE MAP B.) Close to the coast and in either
of these latitudes, Tasman would be looking into the mouth of PORT MUSGRAVE,
the estuary common to the Batavia, Ducie and Dalhunty Rivers of modern maps. He
had just passed (apparently without observing it) the river to which
Carstenszoon gave the name of CARPENTIER (called the SKARDON RIVER in modern
maps), and still believed that river to be a long way south and this shows how
inaccurate was the chart on which he had to rely for information as to his
predecessor's discoveries. Having missed the real Carpentier and found another
"revier" not very far to the south, he would almost certainly have called the
latter the Batavia had he been in possession of either de Leeuw's chart (date
uncertain, say 1623-30) or Kepler and Eekerbrecht's chart (1630), as de Leeuw
had altered Carstenszoon's name of Carpentier to Batavia and Kepler and
Eekerbrecht had copied from him. TASMAN' DID NOT, however, CALL THE INLET THE
BATAVIA, but, believing it to be new, called it the Staeten (States) Revier.
Why he should have called it by that name is a mystery, seeing that (as proved
by his subsequent erroneous identification of another Staeten Revier in 16&deg;
47') Carstenszoon's Staten Revier was shown (although, incorrectly, to the
north of lat. 17&deg;) in the "specially prepared" map which he carried.</p>
<p>Up to the date when Tasman passed Port Musgrave, the singular state of
affairs was that NO inlet had yet been named the Batavia, although the name
even then stood on at least two charts. As a matter of fact, the name was first
applied in 1756 to the principal river debouching into Port Musgrave by VAN
ASSCHENS, the mate in command of the "<i>Buijs</i>," who, no doubt, was in
possession of Kepler and Eekerbrecht's chart, if not of de Leeuw's. Thus Tasman
was the first to notice the mouth of the Port Musgrave Estuary, but he gave it
a name (Staeten) which cannot be accepted, and Van Asschens was the first to
apply the name Batavia to the principal river discharging into the estuary.</p>
<p>Tasman's third position is in 12&deg; 18' (Swart) or 12&deg; 13' (Heeres),
and is named the PRINCE REVIER, probably in honour of Prince Frederik Henry,
then Stadtholder of Holland. The only opening between 12&deg; 13' and 12&deg;
18' is the mouth (12&deg; 14'-12&deg; 15') of the PENNEFATHER RIVER, which has
figured on maps for several decades as the "COEN" River, from Flinders'
erroneous identification with the "revier" to which Carstenszoon gave that
name. Tasman had named the inlet in question the "PRINCE" more than two
centuries before it was named the Pennefather.</p>
<p>Tasman's "REVIER MIT BOSCH"" (Wooded Inlet) is placed in 12&deg; 33' by
Swart and in 12&deg; 30' by Heeres. On modern charts,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 68}</u></p>
<p>the mouth of PINE or NOMENADE CREEK is in 12&deg; 30', but to reach it
Tasman must have doubled sharply round DUYFKEN POINT, and it is very odd indeed
that his 1644 chart gives no indication of this very prominent cape. The
omission may be attributable to a desire to avoid overcrowding the chart with
details.</p>
<p>If Tasman really sailed to the mouth of Pine Creek, he was then well inside
of ALBATROSS BAY, and his next inlet, which he calls the "REVIER CARPENTIER,"
1S placed in a bay in 12&deg; 48'. In 12&deg; 40', the EMBLEY RIVER discharges
into Albatross Bay. Tasman's observation may be correct, but why should he have
given a new name (Staeten Revier) to Carstenszoon's Carpentier Inlet? And why
should he have identified as Carstenszoon's Carpentier an inlet 55 minutes to
the south of it? It is easier to believe that he was supplied with a very
imperfect chart of Carstenszoon's voyage than that he was careless in his
identifications. I conclude that he did not find Carstenszoon's diary and chart
at Banda, as the Governor and Council at Batavia expected he would, and that
the "special chart" supplied to him was imperfect and misleading.</p>
<p>Tasman next writes "VLIEGE BAIJ" (Fly Bay) on the coast in 13&deg; 12' S.
Towards the latter end of the nineteenth century, this bay was labelled by the
Hon. John Douglas (I am afraid unalterably) "ALBATROSS BAY." It extends from
Duyfken Point (12&deg; 33' S.) to Pera Head (12&deg; 55' S.), and receives the
important, and to some extent navigable, MISSION and EMBLEY RIVERS. Here, for
the first time, Tasman's latitude will not square with modern charting, as,
even if the latitude given by him is meant to be that where he left the bay
behind him, he is wrong by 17 minutes too much south. In any case, his name of
Fly Bay has priority, by more than two and a half centuries, over the <i>de
facto</i> name Albatross Bay. The name probably records the fact that
mosquitoes had forced themselves on Tasman's notice. The skipper of the
"<i>Buijs</i>," in April, 1756, recognised VLIEGE BAIJ, although, a month
later, the skipper of the "<i>Rijder</i>" named it MOSSEL BAIJ. (SEE MAP
D.)</p>
<p>South of Albatross Bay, an inlet in 13&deg; 30' (Swart) or 13&deg; 27'
(Heeres) was named the REVIER COEN by Tasman, who evidently believed that he
had identified the inlet (in 13&deg; 7') so named by Carstenszoon.</p>
<p>The "<i>Investigator</i>" Chart by FLINDERS (1802), corrected by the
Admiralty surveyors up to 1896, shows no break in the coast-line in the
position (13&deg; 7' S.) assigned to the Coen Revier by Carstenszoon in 1623;
nor does the Lands Department map. In the chapter devoted to Missionary
Exploration it is shown that the "<i>Pera's</i>" anchorage was in 13&deg; 7'
and that a boat's crew landed there, and a short walking distance to the north
found a small inlet remarkable only for the presence of esculent herbs, and
which was named the COEN. The Rev. N. Hey, of the Mapoon Mission,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 69}</u></p>
<p>informs me that there is such a water-course in 13&deg; 4' S. lat. Tasman
was mistaken in his identification of the inlet in 13&deg; 27-13&deg; 30' with
Carstenszoon's Coen, which is in 13&deg; 4'. Tasman's inlet is, in fact, in
lat. 13&deg; 20'-13&deg; 21', and is the mouth of the important river named the
ARCHER by Jardine in 1865. Some 70 miles from its mouth, the Archer splits into
two branches, and the southern and shorter has borne the name of the COEN since
1876, for the reason that the discoverers of a GOLDFIELD on its upper reaches
believed it to be the head of the "<i>Pera's</i>" (i.e., Carstenszoon's) Coen.
The Lands Department maps now call the river of the goldfield the "SOUTH COEN."
Tasman's erroneous identification was probably due to the imperfection of the
charts with which he had been supplied.</p>
<p>It would not surprise me if direct investigation were to prove the inlet in
13&deg; 27'-30' which Tasman mistook for the Coen to be a mouth of the Archer.
Considering the "habit" of rivers on this coast, I should expect a river like
the Archer to have several mouths. In fact, a sketch-map recently made by the
Rev. A. Richter, and certified by the Rev. N. Hey, shows a mouth named the
DUGALLY RIVER in 13&deg; 33'. There are probably 'other inlets or mouths of the
Archer between 13&deg; 33' and 13&deg; 20', where the only charted mouth is
located, and in this case we need not even suppose an error of a few minutes of
latitude on Tasman's part.</p>
<p>Next in order, in Tasman's 1664 chart, is VISSCHER'S REVIER, in 13&deg; 42'.
Here, again, no inlet appears on the most recent Admiralty charts or on the
maps of the Lands Department. On the latter, the whole of the coast-line from
the mouth of the Archer River to Cape Keerweer is a blank; but my charting (not
very far to the east) of Jardine's <i>route</i> of the last days of 1864, from
his camp numbered 55 to that numbered 57, shows that a group of considerable
streams must find their way to the sea somewhere on this stretch of coast,
unless they all go to feed the Archer River. It is, however, equally probable
that, assuming Tasman's latitude to be correct, the inlet which he named in
compliment to his Assistant-Skipper was a mouth of the Archer itself. So far,
there is no reason for suspecting any serious error in Tasman's latitudes. The
fact that he named what he believed to be a new "revier" in 13&deg; 42' is
strong evidence that he actually landed in or near that latitude.</p>
<p>The next locality noted on Tasman's chart is CAPE KEERWEER (where the
"<i>Duyfken</i>" turned back), which he places in 14&deg; 36'. In that latitude
nothing like a cape appears in modern official sea charts or land maps. I
suggest that his course here was too far out at sea to enable him to lay down
this not very prominent cape from his own observation and that he copied it
from the defective chart which he carried. (SEE MAP F.)</p>
<p>South of the real (13&deg; 58') and the imaginary (14&deg; 36') Cape</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 70}</u></p>
<p>Keerweer, Tasman's chart shows the "VEREENIGDE REVIER" (the "main channel"
of the MITCHELL RIVER), in 15&deg; 12' (Swart) or 15&deg; 6' (Heeres). Modern
charts place it in 15&deg; 9'. Did Tasman identify the inlet so named by
Carstenszoon, or did he merely copy from the chart supplied to him?</p>
<p>Next in order comes the "WATER PLAETS" in 15&deg; 30', which agrees with
Carstenszoon's <i>data</i>. I doubt if Tasman would have attempted to land here
if he had had access to the text of Carstenszoon's diary, which shows that
water was only to be collected by a tedious process and in trifling quantity.
For this reason, I conclude that he did not land, and that he merely copied the
note from the chart supplied to him. (SEE MAP H.)</p>
<p>Tasman next places the REVIER NASSAU in 15&deg; 37' (Swart) or 15&deg; 48'
(Heeres), instead of in 16&deg; 10' where it was placed by Carstenszoon, and
where, according to modern maps, an unnamed creek runs into the sea. A large
river, which modern maps name the Nassau, and which is one of the mouths of the
Mitchell River, runs into the sea in latitude, 15&deg; 54', but it was
unnoticed by Carstenszoon. It is more likely that Tasman copied the Revier
Nassau from the imperfect chart supplied to him than that he was 33 or 22
minutes out in his own observation, so that I doubt if he really visited it.
His supposed identification of Carstenszoon's Nassau was, unfortunately,
accepted by FLIN DERS (1802), and has, since then, passed into geography and
literature, so that the error cannot now be corrected. It must, however, be
understood that the "NASSAU" MOUTH of the MITCHELL, as it appears on modern
land maps, is not Carstenszoon's Nassau, and that the name is merely a
complimentary one.</p>
<p>On an inlet in 16&deg; (Swart) or 16&deg; 15' (Heeres), Tasman bestows the
name of the REVIER PERA. If the latitude (16&deg;) scaled from Swart's version
of Tasman's chart correctly conveys Tasman's meaning, this Pera Inlet must,
according to the Lands Department map, be the "TIDAL MOUTH" OF LEICHHARDT'S
"ROCKY CREEK." This mouth is navigable by small craft for four miles. It may,
therefore, be conceded that Tasman landed at or rowed up the inlet which he
named the Pera Revier.</p>
<p>South of the Pera inlet, and 5 minutes south of the mouth of the large river
which modern maps (incorrectly, though irrevocably) name the Staaten River,
Tasman places the REVIER ARNHEM in 16&deg; 30'. Modern land maps show that a
water-course, known as VAN ROOK CREEK, leaks out of the Einasleigh, a tributary
of the Gilbert River, and falls into the Gulf in this latitude, only 6 miles
south of the mouth of the Staaten River, <i>de facto</i>, after meandering
across the coastal plain, in a general WNW. direction, for 150 miles.
Carstenszoon, in the diary of the "<i>Pera's</i>" voyage, made no mention of an
inlet in this neighbourhood, where he was fuming over the desertion and
supposed treachery of the "<i>Aernem</i>."</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 71}</u></p>
<p>I am inclined to believe that Tasman actually saw the inlet which he named
the Arnhem, and that he named it in commemoration of the last appearance of
that yacht on the "New Guinea" coast.</p>
<p>In an inlet in 16&deg; 47' (Heeres), Tasman believed himself to have
recognised Carstenszoon's STATEN REVIER. The modern land map shows a mouth of
the Gilbert River falling into the Gulf in 16&deg; 45', and it may be assumed
that this is the inlet mistaken by Tasman for Carstenszoon's Staten Revier.
There is, however, as is argued elsewhere, every ground for believing that
CARSTENSZOON'S STATEN REVIER was ACCIDENT INLET, another mouth of the Gilbert,
in 17&deg; 13'. However, seeing that the note in the chart "specially prepared"
for Tasman's use laid down 17&deg; as the limit of previous discovery, he was
compelled to recognise, SHORT OF THAT LATITUDE, some inlet or other as that
which was the "<i>Pera's</i>" and "<i>Aernem's</i>" furthest south, and which
Carstenszoon named the STATEN REVIER. That note itself was incorrect,
Carstenszoon's diary giving the latitude as 17&deg; 8', while 17&deg; 13' is
probably more accurate. That Tasman accepted the authority of the note is an
additional proof, if such were required, that he was not in possession of
Carstenszoon's diary or chart.</p>
<p>The foregoing attempt to follow Tasman, with the assistance of modern
charts, along the coast previously described by Carstenszoon leads to the
conclusion that while he might very well, in following the instructions laid
down for his guidance, have passed rapidly over the already-described region
and commenced operations where Carstenszoon left off, he adopted the
alternative course of spending a considerable amount of time in verifying
Carstenszoon's information. That his success was indifferent is probably
attributable to the imperfection of the chart with which he was supplied.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that we have not the chart which accompanied Tasman's
instructions, and that there are good grounds for the belief that it gave only
an imperfect, second-hand delineation of Carstenszoon's discoveries; that
Tasman, apparently, was not furnished with Carstenszoon's diary or chart; and
that we have not Tasman's account of his own voyage and have to rely on a
small-scale chart on which he laid down his discoveries, identifications and
observations. (SEE MAP M.)</p>
<p>Free at last, and with an absolutely untouched stretch of coast before him,
I am inclined to think that Tasman found that he had already spent too much
time in verifying Carstenszoon's <i>data</i>, and that he had to hurry over
what should have been the most important part of his task. It may be truthfully
said in excuse for him that the whole world presents but few stretches of coast
less picturesque than that on which he was now entering. It may well be
imagined that he was content, in the first place, by a cursory observation,
to</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 72}</u></p>
<p>settle whether "New Guinea" (as he regarded it), or Cape York Peninsula (in
reality), was continuous with Arnhem Land or whether a passage to the south lay
between.</p>
<p>Presumably with the intention of making certain that he was now on an
unexplored shore, Tasman made his first descent at 17&deg; 30' (Swart) or
17&deg; 33' (Heeres), where he named VAN DIEMEN INLET (Revier). Next, he named
the VAN DER LIJN and CARON INLETS, the latter in 17&deg; 47'.</p>
<p>FLINDERS, in 1802, in the "<i>Investigator</i>," believed he had identified
Tasman's Van Diemen Inlet in the mouth of the Gilbert River (16&deg; 57'). All
the attendant circumstances point to the incorrectness of this identification,
but it has, nevertheless, been adopted without question in subsequent official
maps. Firstly, there is the discrepancy between the latitudes of 16&deg; 57'
and 17&deg; 30'. Then it is precisely at his Van Diemen's Inlet that Tasman
makes the trend of the coast-line change from S. by W. to W. by S. I see no
reason for doubting that Tasman's latitude of 17&deg; 30' was substantially
correct, especially as it is here that his chart shows the abrupt change in the
trend of the coast-line. There can be no reasonable doubt that Tasman's VAN
DIEMEN INLET was the MOUTH OF THE NORMAN RIVER, now the port for the Croydon
goldfield and a considerable area of pastoral country. Its latitude is 17&deg;
28'.</p>
<p>Tasman's three inlets, the Van Diemen, Van Der Lijn and Caron, are all,
according to his chart, within 17 minutes of latitude. The position in which
the name of the VAN DER LIJN is written appears to me to be purposely
indefinite, as if it were designed to convey merely that the inlet is between
the Van Diemen and the Caron. I take it to be what is now mapped as the "BYNOE"
mouth of the FLINDERS RIVER.</p>
<p>The CARON INLET is placed on Tasman's chart in 17&deg; 47', and must be the
principal MOUTH OF THE FLINDERS itself. Here, however, Tasman's latitude is
incorrect, according to modern charts, which place the mouth of the river in
17&deg; 36', so that Tasman's position is II minutes inland. I am under the
impression that Tasman had become rather indifferent as to his true position
and had come to regard the continuity of the coast of the Cape York Peninsula
with that of Arnhem Land as the problem of the moment.</p>
<p>It may be noted here that FLINDERS' chart of 1802 shows the CAPRON RIVER
coming from the east and falling into the Norman River at Normanton. Subsequent
Lands Department maps have always given the name of the CARRON RIVER to this
water-course, thus creating a mistaken impression. that this was supposed to be
Tasman's Caron.</p>
<p>From the Caron Inlet (Flinders River) Tasman passes beyond our ken. By
following the coast he established the CONTINUITY OF THE CAPE YORK PENINSULA
(which he named CARPENTARIA)</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 73}</u></p>
<p>WITH ARNHEM LAND, and incidentally that instead of a passage to the south
there was merely the GULF OF CARPENTARIA.</p>
<p><b>SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>The loss of Tasman's journal reduces us to conjecture and the weighing of
probabilities when we attempt to realise what it was that he accomplished, the
groundwork or text of such speculations being the sketch-chart containing the
names which he bestowed on certain inlets or capes.</p>
<p>So far as the Cape York Peninsula was concerned, he was apparently supplied
with a very imperfect and misleading "SPECIALLY MADE" CHART of the voyage of
his predecessor, CARSTENSZOON (in the "<i>Pera</i>"). He failed to procure the
copies of Carstenszoon's journal and chart which it was expected he might pick
up at Banda. Carstenszoon's journal, however, is available to us, although it
was denied to him, so that we are in a position to judge how far he succeeded
in identifying the inlets, etc. named by Carstenszoon.</p>
<p>The truth is that he was very unsuccessful; but this must be attributed
entirely to the defects with the "specially made" chart and to no fault of his
own.</p>
<p>He began his exploration of the Peninsula by rediscovering the
"<i>Pera's</i>" "WATERING-PLACE" in or near 11&deg; S. lat., but did not give
it the additional name of the "REVIER VAN SPULT" which Carstenszoon had
bestowed on it. He next made a very bad guess at the locality of Carstenszoon's
COEN REVIER, but either correctly identified or copied from his "specially
made" chart (which seems to have been correct in this instance) Carstenszoon's
VEREENIGDE REVIER (the MITCHELL RIVER).</p>
<p>Carstenszoon's NASSAU and STATEN REVIERS were incorrectly located by Tasman,
the latter inlet being placed north instead of south of 17&deg;, because the
"specially made" chart had erroneously fixed that latitude as Carstenszoon's
southern limit.</p>
<p>He was the first<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> to notice PORT MUSGRAVE,
which&mdash;probably misguided by the "specially made" chart&mdash;he seems to
have taken at first for Carstenszoon's Staten Revier (before he realised that
the latter was in the neighbourhood of 17&deg;).</p>
<p>He next found a new inlet (12&deg; 13'-18') which he named the PRINCE
REVIER. The name never "caught on." For a good part of the nineteenth century
this inlet was believed (incorrectly) to be Carstenszoon's COEN, and towards
the end of that century was officially, and irrevocably, named the
PENNEFATHER.</p>
<p>He indicated a "REVIER MIT BOSCH" just inside of DUYFKEN POINT, where modern
maps now show the mouth of PINE or</p>
<blockquote>[1) Unless he was anticipated by Janszoon, in the "<i>Duyfken</i>,"
of which there is no record.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 74}</u></p>
<p>NOMENADE CREEK. To press Tasman's undoubtedly just claim to priority of
nomenclature is not to be thought of, as it would only add one more to the too
numerous family of "Scrubby" Creeks.</p>
<p>He was the first to give a name, VLIEGE BAIJ (Fly Bay) to what was
afterwards named MOSSEL BAIJ, and, in recent times, ALBATROSS BAY, now
unalterably fixed by usage and official recognition.</p>
<p>An inlet in this bay (12&deg; 48') was named by Tasman the CARPENTIER,
although its identification with the inlet so named by Carstenszoon would be
absurd. This is one of the few remaining uncharted portions of the coast land,
and if there should turn out to be an inlet of any importance in the locality
indicated, I would suggest that it be named the TASMAN.</p>
<p>In 13&deg; 27'-30', Tasman was the first to note a revier which he
erroneously took for Carstenszoon's Coen, but which must have been one of the
mouths of the great river named the ARCHER by Jardine in 1865.</p>
<p>A new Revier, VISSCHER'S, was placed by Tasman in 13&deg; 42'. Should there
prove to be such an inlet in this uncharted portion of the coast land, there is
every reason why Tasman's name (Visscher) should be applied to it.</p>
<p>CAPE KEERWEER (where the "<i>Duyfken</i>" turned back) is placed in an
altogether wrong position. 'It is more than doubtful if Tasman saw it, and I
believe he merely copied it from his incorrect "specially prepared" chart.</p>
<p>An inlet in 16&deg; was named the REVIER PERA. This inlet, one of the mouths
Of LEICHHARDT'S ROCKY CREEK, is only designated a "TIDAL INLET" in the modern
official map, and should have the name given to it by Tasman.</p>
<p>On Tasman's REVIER ARNHEM, long use and official recognition have
irrevocably fixed the name of VAN ROOK CREEK.</p>
<p>In Tasman's three inlets named VAN DIEMEN'S, VAN DER LIJN'S and CARON'S,
there is no difficulty in recognising respectively (1) the mouth of the NORMAN
RIVER, (2) the "BYNOE" MOUTH Of the Flinders River and (3) the "FLINDERS" MOUTH
of the Flinders.</p>
<p>The name of the Van Der Lijn does not appear to have ever been adopted by
modern maps, but Flinders was responsible for erroneous identifications of the
Van Diemen and Caron, and, following him, the name Van Diemen still persists as
applied to one of the mouths of the Gilbert River, in 16&deg; 58'. The sooner
it is dropped the better. Nor could any useful purpose now be served by
restoring Tasman's names for the three inlets, even if it were possible to
overcome the weight of long-established private and official use of other
names.</p>

<p>The two ships set out together from Batavia on 8th February, 1756, but
parted company in a storm which was encountered off the Banda Islands. The
"BUIJS" took refuge in the port of Banda and remained there till 1st April. The
"RIJDER,"<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> having ridden out the gale, continued
her voyage alone.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Rijder</i>, Ritter, Rider, person of equestrian rank,
Knight.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 76}</u></p>
<p>Emerging from the friendly harbour of Banda on 1st April, the "<i>Buijs</i>"
barquentine sailed to the east, and on 23rd April, while in latitude 12&deg;
58' S., "sighted the LAND OF CARPENTARIA, recognising what has been named CAPE
KEERWEER." The anchor was dropped at sunset.</p>
<p>On 24th April, the noon latitude was 12&deg; 54'. The anchor was dropped at
sunset and bearings gave Cape Keerweer 8 1/3&deg; N. and "the inner hook near
the river," (inlet) ENE. (SEE MAP D.)</p>
<p>Assuming the correctness of the noon observation of 12&deg; 54' (and there
is no reason to doubt it), the point of land was not Cape Keerweer, which is in
13&deg; 59', but either FALSE PERA HEAD or PERA HEAD itself&mdash;probably the
former, the latter being the "inner hook." The reference to "the revier"
(inlet) is obscure, but this may be the fault of the summary rather than of the
log.</p>
<p>Under the mistaken impression that he had identified the Cape Keerweer of
the "<i>Duyfken's</i>" voyage, Asschens resolved to steer to the north. In the
forenoon of 25th April he cleared PERA HEAD. At noon he was in 12&deg; 42' and
he anchored at sunset.</p>
<p>Next morning the northerly course was resumed, and in the forenoon "a red
point" was seen to form the northern horn of "a deep bay or bight" (now
ALBATROSS BAY) on which the "<i>Buijs</i>" had entered after clearing Pera
Head. (SEE MAP B.) The bay was recognised as that which Tasman had designated
VLIEGE BAIJ. The Point, which now bears the name of the "DUYFKEN," was charted
as ASSCHENS' HOEK, and by right of priority should be so called. The error,
however, has so long been condoned by usage as to have become unalterable.</p>
<p>Leaving this point and keeping close to the land, the "<i>Buijs</i>" was in
12&deg; 16' at noon. Smoke was observed.on land, and even what appeared to be
men and huts. The anchor was dropped at sunset in a position which may be
conjectured to have been about 12&deg; 2' S., a little south of the mouth Of
JANIE CREEK, between the PENNEFATHER RIVER (which Tasman had already named the
PRINCE REVIER) and MAPOON MISSION STATION.</p>
<p>Setting sail again at daybreak on 27th April, the land was found to fall
away to the east. As a matter of fact, in coming from the south, the direction
of the coast-line changes, about 7 minutes short of Mapoon, from N. by E. to
NE. Before midday, Asschens was abreast of "a revier (inlet) with an island
lying off its mouth." The inlet (which had been seen by Tasman) was designated
by Asschens the BATAVIA, and by this name the largest river of the Peninsula,
ending in Port Musgrave estuary in 11&deg; 56' S., is now known. It is true
that the name of Batavia had already figured for some time on Dutch maps, but
it was improperly applied (following de Leeuw) to the inlet which</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 77}</u></p>
<p>Carstenszoon had named the Carpentier River in 1623, and which is now known
as the Skardon River.</p>
<p>The "<i>Duyfken</i>" had passed this inlet in 1606, and the "<i>Aernem</i>"
(once) and the "<i>Pera</i>" (twice) in 1623, without observing it. The records
of the "<i>Duyfken's</i>" voyage have been lost, and it may be conjectured that
the "<i>Buijs</i>" either sailed closer to the land, or approached it in a
better light, than the "<i>Pera</i>" or the "<i>Aernem</i>." The supposed
island was, no doubt, a sandbank visible at low tide, 3 miles off the mouth of
Port Musgrave.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>Without landing at the new river, the "<i>Buijs</i>" sailed on to the north.
At noon on the 27th, the latitude was roughly estimated at 11&deg; 38'. Smoke
was observed on the land, and apparently the mouth of Carstenszoon's CARPENTIER
RIVER was not seen. The "<i>Buijs</i>" anchored in the afternoon. At noon on
the 28th she was in 11&deg; 29'. At noon on the 29th she was in 11&deg; 3'.
(SEE MAP A.) Two hours later, the anchor was dropped in 8 fathoms, the
navigators believing themselves to be close to the VAN SPULT RIVER named by
Carstenszoon in 1623. In this belief they were quite correct, the solar
observation at noon on the 30th giving 10&deg; 56'. They were, in fact, on the
Inskip Banks or the "extensive sandy shoals" south of the Banks which are
indicated by modern charts.</p>
<p>It had become necessary to take in water and firewood, both of which were
running short. The charted Watering-place at the Van Spult River naturally
suggested itself to Asschens, but the uncharted shoals called for prudent
action. Accordingly, on 30th April, a boat with eight men was sent out to take
soundings towards the land. The BOAT was lost sight of before nightfall and was
NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF AGAIN. Whether it was wrecked among the shoals or the
crew fell into the hands of the natives must remain a mystery. The
"<i>Buijs</i>" waited for the boat till 12th May, when the scarcity of water
and firewood compelled her to sail westward for TIMOR LAUT,<b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> which was reached on 20th May. No attempt appears to
have been made to search the land for the boat's crew, and it may have been
that there were too few men left on the "<i>Buijs</i>" to furnish a landing
party and risk its loss.</p>
<p>From the cartographer's covering letter, it appears that the sailing orders
of the "<i>Rijder</i>" and "<i>Buijs</i>" enjoined some exploration of the
interior, and Asschens probably intended to carry out this instruction when the
overwhelming disaster overtook him.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Mr. J. T. Embley, who has sailed frequently along this coast,
and seen it from probably the same distance as the "<i>Buijs</i>," writes me
under date 18th July, 1916: "The Batavia has a little island about three miles
out from the mouth, but it is only a high sandbank covered at high tide...The
mouth of the Batavia is plainly visible to any boat travelling from the north
at a distance of 15 or 20 miles before you come to it. No boat could pass it in
the daytime without seeing it."]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) The largest island of the Tenimber group, and now known as
Yamdena.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 78}</u></p>
<p>The cartographer's comment on Asschens is most severe, and, I think,
unjust:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Of the proceedings of 'Stuurman' Lavienne Lodewijk
Asschens (who had command of the barquentine '<i>Buijs</i>'), the Undersigned
can give no account deserving of consideration, while his reports or notes are
so misleading that it is clear at the first glance that he can never have had
any first-hand knowledge or ocular view of the matters referred to by him,
seeing that he has hardly ever been nearer to the land than 3 miles off, at
which distance, however, he pretends to have seen a river with an island before
its mouth, as well as men, huts, etc.: all which seems to the Undersigned
impossible on a flat land, such as this is. Nor has he made any landing on the
said coast, although, contrary to Your Worships' orders, he had sailed along it
from S. to N. for 40 miles before the misfortune of the loss of the boat befel,
as Your Worships may gather from the annexed rough sketch of the coast sent in
by him."<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<p>Asschens certainly began by mistaking Pera Head for Cape Keerweer, but, with
the exception of this mistake, his description can easily be followed on, and
agrees with, accurate modern charts. It must be remembered that his description
is only known to us from a paraphrase of it made by a very unfavourably
impressed (shall we say, prejudiced?) official. He correctly identified
Tasman's Vliege Baij (Albatross Bay) and gave the name of Asschen's Hoek to
what is now called Duyfken Point. He noted the estuary now called Port
Musgrave, which he named the BATAVIA REVIER.<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b>
Lastly, he correctly located himself abreast of the VAN SPULT RIVER before
leaving Australia.</p>
<p><b>THE "RIJDER" (GONZAL)</b></p>
<p>After losing sight of her consort, the "<i>Buijs</i>," off Banda, on 26th
March, 1756, and unaware that she had found shelter, the "RUDER," having
weathered the storm, continued her voyage, and reached FALSE CAPE, the westmost
point of Frederick Henry Island, Papua, on 4th April. (SEE MAP A.) "The HIGH
LAND OF CARPENTARIA, known by the name of HOOG EIJLAND," was sighted on 10th
April. This high land" was, no doubt, HAMMOND and PRINCE OF WALES ISLANDS. A
reef (the Gerard and Larpent Banks) was observed to extend from the high land
nearly to a hitherto uncharted island, which was named RIJDER'S ISLAND, and
which must have been BOOBY ISLAND. Possibly the ship's course lay between the
reef and the island. In making cautiously for the coast, the "<i>Rijder</i>"
apparently approached PRINCE OF WALES ISLAND near its north-western corner,
where a first LANDING was made on 17th April. Only one NATIVE was seen, and he
fled on the approach of the boat's crew, who noted bark huts, a bark canoe,</p>
<blockquote>[1) Heeres says: "I have not met with this chart."]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Tasman, who was probably misled by the "specially prepared"
chart with which he was provided, had named it the Staeten Revier, under the
impression that it was the Staten Revier of Carstenszoon.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 79}</u></p>
<p>fishing-lines, claws of animals used for fish-hooks, and spears barbed with
bone. The description of the country could not possibly apply to any portion of
the adjacent Cape York Peninsula. There were very rich soil, tall grasses, long
straight timber and fine valleys with rills of fresh water. Several landings
were subsequently made for the purpose of taking in water and firewood before
the "<i>Rijder</i>" put out to sea again on 26th April. Her next recorded
course was ENE., "following the trend of the coast," in 5, 6 or 7 fathoms. The
coast-line of Prince of Wales Island, it is true, takes this direction from the
north-western point of the island, but modern charts show that it would have
been impossible to carry the depth of water indicated for any distance on an
ENE. course. The presumption is that after an unsuccessful attempt on this
impossible coast-line, the ship stood out to sea until she had cleared the
Gerard and Larpent Banks and then followed the Prince of Wales Channel
east-north-eastward, passing the north sides of GOOD and HAMMOND ISLANDS. The
anchor was dropped on 28th April in 10&deg; 30' S. The only land in this
latitude is WEDNESDAY ISLAND. Here a party LANDED, but found only bark huts
inhabited by NATIVES, who fled into the woods. The ship's boat was beached and
repaired. The "<i>Rijder</i>" herself lay at anchor till 13th May, to give the
"<i>Buijs</i>" a chance of rejoining her.</p>
<p>Had Gonzal taken the "<i>Rijder</i>" east of Wednesday Island, he would have
had a clear way into the Coral Sea and the Pacific Ocean, but he turned back on
13th May with the intention of following the coast to the south. He kept well
out from the land, and, in fact, overdid it in his natural desire for sea-room,
and it was not until 24th May that he again sighted LAND (south of the
Pennefather River&mdash;Tasman's Prince Revier), in 12&deg; 18' S. (SEE MAP B.)
Drawing closer to the shore, he anchored on 25th May in 12&deg; 26' S. (9 miles
north of Duyfken Point).</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"As they lay at anchor at about 1 or 1&frac12; miles
distance from the shore, they saw two of the previously described canoes
paddling up to the ship, each containing two men, who, when they had got near
the ship, by signs and cries began to signify to our men that they wished them
to come ashore. The following day, being the 26th of May, our men went ashore
at daybreak, and on landing found several persons there, who, however, all took
to flight directly. They also saw two dogs,<b>style="color:#603000"&gt;[1]</b>
not unlike Bengal jackals. The persons who had fled shortly afterwards returned
to them, when they found them armed with the assegays above described. They
were accompanied by a number of womenfolk who were clothed with a sort of mat.
The natives then all of them sat down on the beach near our men, who made signs
to them that they were seeking fresh water, upon which the natives rose and
signified their willingness to point out the places where water was obtainable.
And so it happened that our men were taken along the beach for a short distance
and conducted to a beautiful valley with fine trees. This seemed to be the home
of the natives, as there were more women and children and also some places
where they lived, consisting merely of shelters beneath the trees covered in
with bark. The water which was found here welled up through artificial
openings. They walked round and inspected the</blockquote>
<blockquote>[1) They were thus the first white men to record having seen the
DINGO.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 80}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">place and then returned to the strand, where they
found the two canoes in which the natives had first visited the ship. While
they sat on the beach, 19 natives came up to them, having their bodies all
besmeared with red, and held a frolic with a kind of song.<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> Then they were treated to some arrack with sugar, and
shortly afterwards they retired satisfied into the wood.<br>
<br>
"In the morning of the 27th, our men landed again, to see if they could not
capture a man or two, but they did not succeed in doing so that day, because
they were too late to entice the natives to the beach. Early in the morning of
the 28th they landed again in order to execute their plan. On their arrival the
natives came dancing and singing, sat down beside them and laid aside their
so-called assegais or weapons and again indulged in drinking, under the
influence of which two of them were seized, whereupon the others jumped up and
set upon our people with their assegais, without, however, wounding anyone; but
the ship's clerk, who was trying to get hold of one of the savages, was
slightly wounded by him in the hand. Then a shot was fired and one of the
natives was wounded and the others fled into the bush. Our people then tried to
drag to the boat the two men they had got hold of, but while they were being
tied up one of them, by superhuman biting and tearing, managed to break loose
and took to flight. Immediately thereafter, upwards of 50 natives came up,
preparing to throw assegais, but a single volley put them to flight. Then our
men took their one captive on board."</blockquote>
<p>On 29th May, the "<i>Rijder</i>" dropped anchor at noon in 12&deg; 31' S.,
i.e., about 4 (English) miles north Of DUYFKEN POINT. She lay at anchor all the
next day, and two canoes paddled out and inspected her from a distance of half
a mile (Dutch). On the 31st, she cleared DUYFKEN POINT, and at noon was in lat.
12&deg; 44' S. (SEE MAP D.) After contending with a contrary current, she
anchored at sunset in ALBATROSS BAY, which Gonzal named MOSSELBAAIJ. Asschens
had recognised it five weeks earlier as Tasman's VLIEGE BAIJ.</p>
<p>On 1st June, only a short distance was sailed in the forenoon, and an anchor
was dropped in 12&deg; 51' S. A boat was sent out the following day, and
reported abundant water at or near the "<i>Pera's</i>" WATERING-PLACE of 9th
May, 1623, where "the chart showed a fresh-water river." The "<i>Rijder</i>"
moved oh, on 3rd June, to the position indicated, which was in 12&deg; 57' S.,
between PERA HEAD and FALSE PERA HEAD, and dropped her anchor. A stay of ten
days was made here while water and firewood were taken in and the boat was
repaired. "Water came rushing down the rocks, and there was also a fine pool
where many birds of different sorts were seen." The place was named RIJDER'S
WATERPLAETS. The above description is not unlike that of the "<i>Pera's</i>"
Waterplaets, but the two may be distinct, although they cannot be far apart. No
natives were seen.</p>
<p>The voyage was resumed on 13th June. At noon the latitude was 13&deg; 2' S.
(the narrative gives 12&deg; 2' S., evidently a clerical error). On the 14th,
it was 13&deg; 8' at noon. "At the first glass of the dog-watch," the anchor
was dropped, slightly to the south of the RIJDER'S HOEK. To this prominence, in
13&deg; 10', modern</p>
<blockquote>[1) This is the first record of white men having been entertained
with a CORROBORREE.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 81}</u></p>
<p>charts give no name. The latitude of the anchorage was made out to be
13&deg; S. at noon on the following day. I can only conclude that this was a
faulty observation, as it is contradicted by the observations of the two
preceding days, which agree with the contour of the coast-line. In the morning
of the same day, a boat's crew landed, after having been met by two men in a
canoe, who invited them to come ashore. Eleven men and five women met them on
the beach, the men being armed with spears. The NATIVES tried to take off the
hats of the visitors, which the latter resisted whereupon the natives
threatened with their spears. A shot was fired and the crowd fled, with the
exception of one youth, who was carried on board.</p>
<p>The sailors found a large pond of fresh water, and judged that the country,
if cultivated, would prove fertile. It was remarked that the natives subsisted
mainly on roots of trees, and wild fruits such as batatas or oubis, with a
little fish, and that they seemed to have some knowledge of gold when some
lumps of the metal were shown them. It is not stated on what occasion these
observations were made. It cannot have been on the single interview above
referred to.</p>
<p>On 16th June, the course was set westward for AERNEM'S LAND. On the 24th,
the "MAINLAND OF NEW HOLLAND was sighted, and the home journey was concluded
<i>via</i> Timor and Rotti.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as her crew effected landings on Prince of 'Wales Island and at
three different localities on the mainland, the "<i>Rijder</i>" added more to
our knowledge of the interior and its inhabitants than the "<i>Buijs</i>,"
whose men were defeated on their only attempt at landing. The "<i>Rijder</i>"
was the first (except, perhaps, the "<i>Duyfken</i>") to land a party in the
neighbourhood of DUYFKEN POINT and to explore the southern shore of ALBATROSS
BAY. The landing south of PERA HEAD confirmed the existence of the
"<i>Pera's</i>" watering-place. The last landing on the Peninsula, at RIJDER'S
HOEK, was made in a locality till then unvisited. After this landing, probably
no white footprint marked the soil until, fourteen years later, Captain Cook
landed on the eastern coast of the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Beyond question, Lieutenant-Commander (by courtesy Captain) James Cook,
R.N., ranks foremost among the navigators who helped to build up the British
Empire. Among the services which he performed, the greatest of all were the
discoveries which led to the acquisition of Australia.</p>
<p>The main incidents of his adventures in Australia are so well known that in
the present volume it is necessary to do little more than to trace his
connection with the Cape York Peninsula.</p>
<p>The great "First" Voyage commenced in 1768 and ended in 1771. Although
Cook's original Log or Journal is still extant, it was only given to the world
in its entirety by Captain Sir W. J. L. Wharton, R.N., in 1893. The Editor
remarks:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Strange it must appear that the account of the most
celebrated and certainly, to the English nation, the most momentous voyage of
discovery that has ever taken place&mdash;for it practically gave birth to the
great Australian colonies&mdash;has never before been given to the world in the
very words of its great leader. It has fallen out in this wise.]</blockquote>
<blockquote class="inline">"After the return of the '<i>Endeavour</i>,' it was
decided that a full and comprehensive account of the voyage should be compiled.
Cook's Journal dealt with matters from the point of view of the seaman, the
explorer and the head of the expedition, responsible for life and for its
general success. The Journals of Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander looked from the
scientific side on all that presented itself to their enthusiastic
observation.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 83}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">"What could be better than to combine these accounts
and make up a complete narrative from them all?</blockquote>
<blockquote class="inline">"The result, however, according to our
nineteenth-century ideas, was not altogether happy. Dr. Hawkesworth, into whose
hands the Journals were put, not only interspersed reflections of his own, but
managed to impose his own ponderous style upon many of the extracts from the
united Journals; and, moreover, as they were all jumbled together, the whole
being put into Cook's mouth, it is impossible to know whether we are reading
Cook, Banks, Solander or Hawkesworth himself."</blockquote>
<p>Up to the present day, numerous accounts of the "Voyages," "Lives," etc.,
have been issued, and in many languages. They condense or expand with the
greatest freedom, according to the views or objects of this or that author or
editor.</p>
<p>More than fifty years ago, I picked up, at an Edinburgh bookstall, a Glasgow
edition <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> of Cook's Voyages, in three volumes,
which may serve as an illustration of how Cook's narrative was dealt with and
edited in such a fashion that Cook himself would hardly have recognised it. It
is Hawkesworth, without the division into chapters, or the rubrics which
preface the chapters. Portions, however, are omitted and again portions are
added, the Journals of Cook, Banks and Solander, together with Kippis' <i>Life
of Cook</i>, having been laid under contribution, while many philosophical
observations were evidently contributed by the anonymous editor himself. No
acknowledgment is ever made, but, even for statements or facts which at first
appear to be new, justification can usually be found somewhere in one or other
of the authentic documents. The editing, on the whole, is skilfully done,
although Captain Cook is made to speak "in the first person singular," and
reflections and observations are put into his mouth which he certainly would
never have dreamed of making. What between Hawkesworth and the later editor,
the plain tale of a sailor has assumed a mask compounded of pedantry and
Calvinistic piety which forms a baffling disguise.</p>
<p>The primary object of the voyage which was commenced in 1768 was the
measurement of the sun's distance by means of an observation of the transit of
Venus, a project which was urged by the Royal Society and warmly supported by
King George III. This object having been accomplished, the expedition was to
explore the South Seas.</p>
<p>The barque "<i>Endeavour</i>," of 370 tons, originally built as a collier,
was selected as a suitable vessel and added to the Royal Navy. Her complement
was ninety-five persons in all, inclusive of eleven who were civilians. Among
the latter were Mr. (afterwards Sir) Joseph Banks, a naturalist with a leaning
towards botany, who had been President of the Royal Society, Dr. Charles
Solander, his Secretary and Assistant, Mr. Charles Green, Astronomer, and
Messrs. Reynolds, Parkinson and Buchan, Artists. All of the</p>

Journal</i>. Glasgow, W. D. and A. Brownlie, 1807-8-9.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 84}</u></p>
<p>above-named, except Banks and Solander, died on the voyage. As Banks was
merely a passenger, and therefore practically independent of Captain Cook, it
would not have been surprising if friction had arisen. But he was plentifully
endowed with judgment as well as with initiative and technical knowledge, and
was able to render signal services during the voyage, and afterwards to help
the Government with sage advice regarding the conduct of the newly acquired
colony of New South Wales. Considering that the observations of Cook and Banks
sometimes overlapped, and that their journals were written simultaneously, but
independently, and that Cook, although self-taught, possessed no mean
scientific knowledge, it is, indeed, much to the credit of both men that their
intercourse was never marred by jealousy. The obvious explanation is that both
were gentlemen in the finest sense of the word. It is, nevertheless, a fact
that, reading between the lines of both of their journals, one can find here
and there a trace of human weakness. The one can enjoy a joke which tells
against the other.</p>
<p>The transit of Venus was duly and successfully observed at Tahiti, the
locality selected for the purpose. Intimate relations were established with the
natives of the islands during a residence of three months, and showed that an
unsophisticated race had attained a measure of civilisation along ethical lines
differing widely from those of Europe. New Zealand was next visited, and the
information given by Tasman was greatly added to, the essential division of the
land into two large islands being established.</p>
<p>Early in the year 1770, Cook set sail from New Zealand and struck the east
coast of Australia near Cape Howe. Following the coast to the north, he made
his first landing on 28th April at BOTANY BAY, where he stayed till 6th May.
Fresh water was taken on board and Banks and Solander revelled in new realms of
natural history. Daily attempts were made to cultivate the friendship of the
natives, who, unfortunately, proved hostile and suspicious, and on several
occasions threw spears. It was observed that they used wimmeras.</p>
<p>Leaving Botany Bay, Cook followed the coast north and northwest, giving to
the majority of the capes and bays the names which they now bear. His landings
were few and brief, and were made chiefly in search of fresh water. His first
landing at the base of Cape York Peninsula was at TRINITY BAY, on 10th June.
(SEE MAP G.) It was at CAPE TRIBULATION that his troubles began, on the night
of that same day. In fine weather and clear moonlight, the ship stuck fast on a
coral reef, and began to leak in an alarming manner. Ballast, six guns, and
other material over 50 tons&mdash;were jettisoned, and at length, by throwing
out anchors, the "<i>Endeavour</i>" was warped into deep water. The leak was
temporarily overcome by the process known as "fothering," i.e., a sail was
passed below the keel and secured at both bulwarks and</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 85}</u></p>
<p>was pressed into the hole by which the water had been rushing into the ship.
Then the pumps easily kept the water under control. In the nick of time, a
harbour of refuge was found. On the 17th June, the "<i>Endeavour</i>" lay
alongside a steep beach in ENDEAVOUR INLET, where, 103 years later, arose the
town of COOKTOWN. (SEE MAP E.) When the bottom could be examined, it was found
that the biggest hole was plugged up by a stone which had been detached from
the reef. Had this rock dropped out, the ship must inevitably have
foundered.</p>
<p>While the ship was being repaired, the officers and passengers explored the
land. They were in harbour till 4th August. They made the acquaintance of the
kangaroo, the opossum, the dingo, the flying fox, the snake, the turtle, the
"alligator" and many birds. Banks collected a store of plants then new to
science.</p>
<p>Tied, as they were, to the crippled ship, we cannot expect much information
from Cook and his companions regarding the interior. Cook himself climbed
GRASSY HILL, south of the harbour, and probably also the jungle-clad hill now
known as MOUNT COOK. What concerned him most was the question of a northward
passage, and the outlook in this respect was disquieting. He also climbed one
of the hills on the north side of the harbour, and another (MOUNT SAUNDERS?) 7
or 8 miles further north. Other members of the party rowed up the ENDEAVOUR
RIVER to fresh water.</p>
<p>In Cook's mind, next to the safety of the ship, came the desire to cultivate
the friendship of the NATIVES (the Indians, as it was then the fashion to call
them) and observe their habits. The party had, however, been in the harbour for
no less than three weeks before they "spoke" any of the inhabitants. On 10th
July, four men appeared on the north side of the estuary, engaged in spearing
fish. Eventually, they paddled their outrigger canoe to the ship and entered
into conversation "without expressing any fear or distrust." Small presents
were given to the men, who came on board and remained for some time. Besides
the spears which they carried, Cook noted the wimmera or throwing-stick. Daily
visits followed and amicable relations were established and strengthened by
gifts of iron, beads and food. It took the natives, however, only nine days of
intercourse to learn how to presume upon the good nature of their hosts. On
19th July, a party of sixteen or seventeen came to the ship, the number
including, for the first time, a few women. Scornfully rejecting biscuits, they
demanded a turtle and attempted to take it by force. Foiled in this attempt,
they leaped into the sea, climbed into their canoe and paddled for the shore.
Cook and Banks got into a boat, with a crew, and were the first to land. As
soon as the natives landed, they snatched a brand from beneath a kettle of
pitch and set fire to the grass around the camp. The smith's forge was
destroyed and a pig was burned to death. The natives then made for another</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 86}</u></p>
<p>spot, where sailors were engaged in washing and drying nets, and set fire to
the grass. As matters had gone far enough, a musket loaded with small shot was
discharged at one of the natives, "which drew blood at 40 yards," says Cook,
and the natives fled. Then a ball was fired "across their bows," to convince
them that they were not yet beyond the reach of punishment, whereupon the
fugitives quickened their pace and were lost to sight. A few minutes later,
they emerged from a wood, headed by an old man, made friendly advances, and
were forgiven, and received presents, among which, by way of object-lesson,
were musket bullets, the uses and effects of which were explained. If the
trouble had occurred a few days earlier, Cook remarked, all his powder, which
was then ashore, would have been lost.</p>
<p>Four days later, a member of the crew incautiously walked into a native
camp, and found himself in the power of four "Indians," who, however, permitted
him to depart in peace after having satisfied their curiosity regarding the
texture of his clothing and skin and refused the knife which he offered them.
They even took the trouble to set him right when he made for the ship in the
wrong direction.</p>
<p>Such relations had been established before the "<i>Endeavour</i>" left the
harbour that the crew knew most of their aboriginal visitors by name, and were
able to distinguish strangers when these made their appearance. The tribe
consisted, as far as Cook saw, of twelve men, seven women, one boy and one
girl. He observed the native method of fire-raising by friction.</p>
<p>What "frightfulness" means in navigation can be fully appreciated by any
passenger on a mail steamer who has the run of the chart-room on the bridge
between Cooktown and Cape York. The narrow passage between the land and the
Barrier Reef, charted, lighted, buoyed and beaconed though it now is, is
crowded with reefs ready to punish remorselessly any deviation from the right
path. That this path is negotiated daily in safety and comfort is due to the
skill and the ceaseless watch of the officers. What must the passage have been
when this was an unknown sea and the frail sailing craft depended on the
caprice of light winds!</p>
<p>Cook put out to sea on 5th August. The "Master" had previously visited the
"Three Islands" of the Low WOODY GROUP. The "<i>Endeavour</i>" rounded CAPE
BEDFORD and anchored off LOOKOUT POINT, where COOK himself LANDED. The lookout
was very unsatisfactory, as the chance of getting away to the north seemed
doubtful, and so the boats were called upon to scout. The Master landed on the
TURTLE ISLANDS to the north. COOK himself LANDED and passed a night on LIZARD
ISLAND, and on his way back to the ship landed on EAGLE ISLAND.</p>
<p>The "<i>Endeavour</i>" left LOOKOUT POINT on 13th August and, passing on the
north side of EAGLE and LIZARD ISLANDS, found a</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 87}</u></p>
<p>way (COOK'S PASSAGE) through the reef due east of the HOWICK ISLAND. There
was deep water (over 150 fathoms) outside of the reef and an open sea to the
north-west, in which direction the course was set. At four in the morning of
the 16th, it was found that although the lead gave "no bottom" the ship was
within a mile of a REEF on which the swell broke thunderously: there was hardly
a breath of wind, and a strong current was driving the ship on the reef. After
a fight with death lasting till late in the afternoon, a light breeze and a
current combined to drive the ship through a narrow opening in the reef into a
peaceful anchorage. The passage was appropriately named PROVIDENTIAL
CHANNEL.</p>
<p>Cook was, no doubt, even better pleased to get inside the reef than he had
been to get outside a few days beforehand he resolved, as he said, "whatever
the consequence might be, to keep the main land on board" for the rest of his
northward voyage. He had to settle, once and for ever, the question "whether
this country did or did not join to New Guinea." This question had been
answered centuries before by Spaniards and Portuguese, but so well had these
guarded the secret that the answer was unknown not only to the Dutch in 1606,
1623, 1644 and 1756, but also to the English in 1770.</p>
<p>Inside of the Barrier Reef, Cook again saw the mainland, at a point which he
named CAPE WEYMOUTH. (SEE MAP B.) On resuming his northward course, he saw and
named TEMPLE BAY and passed outside of the FORBES ISLANDS, which he named. He
then rounded CAPE GRENVILLE, which he named, leaving the SIR CHARLES HARDY and
COCKBURN ISLANDS, which he named, on his right. Still keeping the mainland in
sight and steering to the north-west, he passed outside of the islands which he
named BIRD and CAIRNCROSS. He also named NEWCASTLE BAY. (SEE MAP A.) Arrived
within sight of MOUNT ADOLPHUS ISLAND, he observed that the mainland receded to
the west and altered his course to that direction. CAPE YORK, the northmost
horn of Australia, was passed and named. The high lands of PRINCE OF WALES and
HORN ISLANDS, which the earlier Dutch navigators had taken to be part of the
mainland, were recognised as islands. The INSULARITY OF NEW GUINEA was at last
settled beyond cavil.</p>
<p>Before bidding a last adieu to Australia, Cook landed on POSSESSION ISLAND
and hoisted the ENGLISH FLAG on the highest point.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Having satisfied myself," says Cook, "of the great
probability of a passage, thro' which I intend going with the Ship, and
therefore may land no more upon this Eastern coast of New Holland, and on the
Western side I can make no new discovery, the honour of which belongs to the
Dutch Navigators, but the Eastern Coast from the Lat. of 38&deg; down to this
place, I am confident, was never seen or visited by any European before us; and
notwithstanding I had in the Name of His Majesty taken possession of many
places upon this Coast, I now once more hoisted English Colours, and in the
Name of His Majesty King George the Third took possession of the whole Eastern
coast from the above Lat. down to this place by the Name of New Wales,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<blockquote>[1) New South Wales in the "Admiralty" copy of the
manuscript.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 88}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">together with all the Bays, Harbours, Rivers and
Islands, situated upon the said Coast; after which we fired 3 Volleys of small
Arms, which were answer'd by the like number from the Ship."</blockquote>
<p>It would have been more correct, dramatically, if the ceremony had been
performed on the mainland, but the reason for the use of the island is
sufficiently explained by the passage from Cook's diary above quoted.</p>
<p>On the summit of the highest hill in POSSESSION ISLAND, and therefore
practically on the spot where Cook planted his flagstaff, a vein of AURIFEROUS
QUARTZ was discovered by Mr. J. T. Embley in 1895 and worked by him and others
for some years afterwards. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> It is safe to say
that had the discovery been made by Captain Cook the development of Australia
would have proceeded from north to south instead of from south to north. By
what apparently trivial circumstances the currents of historical events may be
directed into one channel or another!</p>
<p>Ten men were observed on a hill in POSSESSION ISLAND, and one of them
appeared to have a BOW AND ARROWS. Cook, however, confessed that the
observation was of doubtful value, having been made with glasses and from a
considerable distance. Subsequent observations have proved bows and arrows to
be foreign to the mainland of Australia.</p>
<p>His task accomplished, Cook rounded the southern cape of Prince of Wales
Island and set his course to the north-west. One more LANDING was made in
Australian waters, at BOOBY ISLAND, on 23rd August, 1770. On his homeward
voyage, he visited New Guinea, Timor, Java and the Cape of Good Hope, and
reached Dover on 12th June, 1771. In after years, and far from Cape York
Peninsula, he was fated to win further laurels and the crown of martyrdom.</p>
<p>The passage discovered by Cook is now known as <i>Endeavour</i> Strait, and
is the southmost of the nine passages through the islands and reefs lying
between Australia and New Guinea recognised as practicable by the modern
cartographers of the Admiralty. The question of its identity with the passage
through which Torres found his way in 1606 has already been discussed at some
length, and there can be no reasonable doubt that TORRES and COOK deserve the
credit of having made genuine and DISTINCT DISCOVERIES, although the existence
of a strait was known even before Torres.</p>
<p>Chiefly for the reason that the story of Cook is the best known of all the
Australian explorers, it has been judged unnecessary to present to the reader
anymore than a brief account of his experiences in the Cape York Peninsula.
This chapter may fitly close with the less known story, "in lighter vein," of
how nearly another than Cook came to being in command of the
"<i>Endeavour</i>."</p>
<p>ALEXANDER DALRYMPLE, a younger brother of Sir John Dalrymple</p>
<blockquote>[1) See <a href="#ch87">Chapter LXXXVII.</a>]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 89}</u></p>
<p>Earl of Stair, the famous authority on the law of Scotland, was an
enthusiastic and scientific <i>G&eacute;ographe</i>r, and a shrewd and capable
collector, critic and editor of <i>Voyages</i>. Many important documents came
to light through his industrious researches. He had conducted marine surveys in
the East Indies, and had been present at the capture of Manila by the British
fleet in 1762.</p>
<p>When the Royal Society initiated the project of a Transit of Venus
expedition, Dalrymple was consulted as to the details and claimed to have
actually selected the "<i>Endeavour</i>" as a suitable vessel. He was nominated
as Observer of the transit and expected to be given command of the ship, and
might have received it had not the conduct of the expedition been turned over
to the Royal Navy. The Naval authorities could not possibly have sent out tars
and marines under the command of a civilian. Dalrymple was of the merchant
service, and the Admiralty put Lieutenant Cook in command.</p>
<p>This disappointment was never forgotten by Dalrymple during his long and
useful after life. (He was born in 1737 and died in 1808.) The memory of his
grievance undoubtedly lent a tinge of bitterness to his criticism of the
explorers of his own time.</p>
<p>COMMODORE (afterwards Admiral) BYRON, in H.M.S. "<i>Dolphin</i>," made a
voyage round the world (1764-6), in the course of which he devoted a good deal
of attention to Patagonia.</p>
<p>In 1766, after Byron's return to England, CAPTAIN WALLIS was sent out with
the "<i>Dolphin</i>" and CAPTAIN CARTARET with the "<i>Swallow</i>" to continue
the discoveries made by Byron. The "<i>Dolphin</i>" parted with the
"<i>Swallow</i>" after passing the Straits of Magellan and subsequently visited
Prince Rupert Island, Whitsun Island, Tahiti, etc., returning to Ungland in
1768. In Tahiti the men of the "<i>Dolphin</i>" made themselves much at home.
The official account of the voyage may be read in Vol. III of <i>A Collection
of Voyages round the World performed by Royal Authority</i>, London, 1790. A
shorter <i>History of Wallis and Cartaret's Voyage round the World</i> (London,
A. Wren and G. Hodges) hints at dalliance with the ladies, in passages such as
these: "Port Royal, 5th July, 1767.&mdash;The Captain was entertained by a lady
of authority, whom he called his Queen."..."27th July.&mdash;The Queen parted
from him with wild demonstrations of regret. This Island is represented by
Captain Wallis as one of the most pleasant in the universe." It was owing to
the representations of Wallis that Cook was directed to Port Royal as a
favourable locality for the observation of the transit.</p>
<p>DALRYMPLE, while Cook was prosecuting his momentous first voyage, issued his
admirable <i>Historical Collection of the Several Voyages and Discoveries in
the South Pacific Ocean</i>, and seized the opportunity of expressing in a
DEDICATION which is one of the curiosities of literature, his opinion of Byron,
Wallis and another</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 90}</u></p>
<p>whom I cannot identify with confidence, and his admiration for an ideal

<p>I am not prepared to admit the justice of the contemptuous allusions to
Byron and Wallis. If the third person (mentioned second in order) was Quiros,
which his alleged reluctance to go further than 20&deg; south renders probable,
it must be remembered that Dalrymple, when he wrote in 1770, was, like the rest
of the world, very imperfectly informed as to the proceedings of Quiros. But
whatever may have been the shortcomings of Quiros (?), Byron and Wallis, to
whom the book was pointedly NOT dedicated, the description of the ideal
navigator, the man after Dalrymple's own heart, reads like a pen-portrait of
Cook, who was even then, while Dalrymple wrote with his pen steeped in gall,
making the great discoveries which the writer himself might have made if he had
been given the opportunity. After Cook's return Dalrymple could not but admit
the importance of his discoveries, but a tendency towards bitterness may still
be traced in his inclinations to belittle the value of the passage between
Australia and New Guinea and the assertion that its discovery had been
forestalled by Torres.</p>

<h3><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<h4>QUIROS, TORRES AND COOK AND THE VAUGONDY AND DALRYMPLE MAPS</h4>
<p><b>INSULARITY OF NEW GUINEA. KNOWN TO THE SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE. DENIED BY
THE DUTCH. PROVED BY TORRES, BUT PROOF LONG WITHHELD FROM PUBLICITY.
DEMONSTRATED BY COOK.</b></p>
<p>We have seen that, in 1606, PEDRO FERNANDEZ DE QUIROS found a harbour which
he named VERA CRUZ, on the east side of one of the islands of the New Hebrides
group. Believing the land adjoining the harbour to be the east coast of the
southern continent, he named the supposed continent LA AUSTRALIA DEL ESPIRITU
SANTO, and selected a site for its capital, which was to be called the New
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Admiral (i.e., Second-in-Command) Luis DE VAES TORRES, who parted with
Quiros at Vera Cruz, threw a justifiable doubt on Quiros' assumptions and
sailed along the south coast of New Guinea. He thus demonstrated&mdash;though
not for the first time&mdash;the SEPARATION OF NEW GUINEA FROM AUSTRALIA, a few
months after the Dutch vessel the "<i>Duyfken</i>" had made a voyage along the
southwest coast of New Guinea and the west coast of Cape York Peninsula, which
voyage left, as far as the Dutch were concerned, the question of a strait
unsettled. In 1623, CARSTENSZOON, in the "<i>Pera</i>" decided that there was
no strait, although the west coast of the Peninsula was indented with a shallow
bight.</p>
<p>Carstenszoon's view as to the connection of New Guinea with Australia was
held by ROBERT DE VAUGONDY, one of the best-informed Geographers of the
eighteenth century, when he and his father, who was Geographer to the King of
France, issued their magnificent <i>Atlas Universel</i>, containing a map (on a
globular projection) dated 1752. The map also showed Tasmania as a part of
Australia, and from Tasmania a "conjectural coast-line" ran north-eastward to
include Vera Cruz and then west-north-westward to take in the north side of New
Guinea, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> in accordance with Tasman's ideas on
the conclusion of his voyage of 1642-3.</p>
<p>Robert de Vaugondy issued another map (on Mercator's projection) in 1756,
"pour servir de la lecture de 1'Histoire des Terres Australes." This, which is
generally known as "Vaugondy's</p>
<blockquote>[1) This 1752 map is reproduced in Collingridge's work, p. 305, but
transposed to a plane projection.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 93}</u></p>
<p>Map," was on a scale of .15 inch to a degree. It is reproduced on a slightly
smaller scale (.109 inch to a degree) in Bartholomew and Cramp's Australasian
School Atlas of 1915. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> It shows a very distinct
expanse of water between New Guinea and Cape York Peninsula.</p>
<p>A comparison of Vaugondy's two maps, therefore, leads to the conclusion that
between 1752 and 1756 the cartographer had become convinced of, or had strong
reason to suspect, the existence of Torres Strait. What was the source of his
information? As the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the second map was to help in the
correct reading of President du Brosses' work, we naturally turn to that work
for an explanation of the change in Vaugondy's views between 1752 and 1756;
and, strange to say, the text only refers to the connection of New Guinea and
the Southern Continent as doubtful. Perhaps something was known to Vaugondy of
which du Brosses was ignorant. (SEE MAP A.)</p>
<p>In rediscovering Torres Strait in 1770, COOK was, in one sense, merely
settling a question which was still open to discussion, although he discovered
a channel distinct from that used by Torres. Had he read Torres' report of 1607
there would have been no such question for him to settle. It is possible that
Cook was aware of the conclusion arrived at by Vaugondy between 1752 and 1756,
without knowing the ground on which that conclusion was based.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, it would be well to know at what time the fact of
Torres' passage through the strait (which he does not claim as a discovery at
all) was given to the world, or "published."</p>
<p>In accordance with the custom and policy of Spain, the report would be kept
a secret as long as possible. Likely enough, as it so happened that shortly
after Torres' voyages Spain's interest in the South Sea diminished greatly, the
report would soon be forgotten, "pigeon-holed" and lost sight of.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER DALRYMPLE <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> an eminent British
Geographer (afterwards Hydrographer to the Admiralty), published in 1767, an
<i>Account of the Discoveries in the South Pacifck Ocean previous to 1764</i>.
The chart accompanying the volume bears the date of October, 1767, and shows
Torres' <i>route</i> between New Guinea and New Holland, but the text makes no
reference to Torres' adventures.</p>
<p>Dalrymple again, in 1770, issued the same map, with the date October, 1767,
in his <i>Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean</i>.
Although Volume I is correctly described as "being chiefly a literal
translation from the Spanish Authors," it contains no reference to Torres'
report.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The only omission from the reproduction is that of the legend
"Carpentarie en 1644" applied to Cape York Peninsula, or perhaps more correctly
to the whole of the land supposed to continue eastward to Vera
Cruz.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Born 1737. See Biography in <i>European Magazine</i> for Nov.,
1802. Mitchell Library, A 923, 9 C.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 94}</u></p>
<p>As early as 1774, Dalrymple had claimed, in a letter to the editor of Cook's
Voyages, that he had marked Torres' <i>route</i> on his map from information
contained in Arias' Memorial, and that he had given a copy of that map to Mr.
(afterwards Sir) Joseph Banks before the latter sailed with Cook in the
"<i>Endeavour</i>" (i.e., before 27th May, 1768). <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> He therefore was quite justified in assuming that
Cook's passage through the strait was "determined by" that information. It is
reasonable to suppose that Cook took into consideration the probability of
there being a passage, but that he considered it open to doubt as being based
on maps only (Vaugondy's 1756 map and Dalrymple's 1767 map&mdash;probably then
in manuscript&mdash;supplied by him to Banks).</p>
<p>It is clear that Dalrymple, although he had been in possession of Torres'
Narrative since 1762, had not yet seen, or at any rate had not yet translated,
the narrative of Torres when he furnished Banks (prior to 27th May, 1768) with
a map showing Torres Strait. He himself states that the information which he
had at that date was taken from Arias' Memorial.</p>
<p>I believe that TORRES' REPORT, written in 1607, was, to begin with, kept
secret by the Spanish Government, and was then pigeon-holed and forgotten. It
need not, however, be supposed that Torres sent in his report, or narrative,
without keeping a copy, and there is nothing in the narrative, as given by
Dalrymple, to indicate that it was accompanied by a chart. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> A man who had a genuine grievance against his
government, Torres probably (perhaps long after 1607) showed, or gave copies of
the narrative and chart to people of importance whom he wished to interest. It
is more than likely that he himself gave some high officer of the Dutch East
India Company at Manila the copy of the narrative which was found by Alexander
Dalrymple in the archives of the city when it was taken by the British in 1762.
It is probable that a copy of Prado's general chart had come into Vaugondy's
hands between 1752 and 1756, but if a copy of Torres' own narrative had come
into Dalrymple's possession in 1762, he had evidently not mastered its
contents&mdash;perhaps had not reached it in the course of working through the
translations&mdash;when he published his Collection of Voyages in 1770.</p>
<p>DR. JEAN Luis ARIAS, acting as the mouthpiece of a Committee of priests, in
a MEMORIAL to King Philip III of Spain, exhorted the King to rise to a sense of
the duties of his position and conquer the Southern Land, to the end that
Christianity might be spread, and, above all, that Dutch and English heretics
might be forestalled.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Collingridge, p. 200.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Three very accurate charts of localities on the south side of
New Guinea, all of which are described as having been discovered by Torres,
were made by Captain Prado, Torres' companion, but they only came to light
about 1778. Prado referred, in a letter dated 24th December, 1613, to a general
chart of the Quiros-Torres Voyage, which has not yet been discovered. The
report of Torres himself bears internal evidence of having been written at a
time when he had not the charts of his voyage to refer to.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 95}</u></p>
<p>Among the arguments employed are the achievements of early Spanish
navigators (recounted at some length), including those of Torres.</p>
<p>Internal evidence dates this remarkable document between 1614 (referred to
as the year of Quiros' death) and 1621 (when Philip III died). The Memorial was
published in Spanish in Edinburgh, and translated by Dalrymple, who printed it
as an appendix to his <i>Charts and Memoirs</i> in 1772.</p>
<p>After relating the parting of Quiros and Torres, in 1606, the memorialist
goes on to say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The Admiral Luis Vaes de Torres being left in the
Bay, and most disconsolate for the loss of the '<i>Capitano</i>' [Quiros'
vessel] resolved to continue the discovery...Finding himself in great straits
in 21&deg; S., to which high latitude he had persevered in sailing in about a
SW. direction from the 15&deg; or 20&deg; S., in which lay the aforesaid Baia,
he put back to the NW. and NE. up to 14&deg;, in which he sighted a very
extensive coast, which he took for that of New Guadalcanal. From thence he
sailed westwards, having constantly on the right hand the coast of another very
great land, which he continued coasting, according to his own reckoning, more
than 600 leagues, having it still on the right hand (in which course may be
understood to be comprehended New Guadalcanal and New Guinea). Along the same
course he discovered a great diversity of islands. The whole country was very
fertile and populous. He continued his voyage on to Bachan and Ternate, and
from thence to Manila, which was the end of his discovery." <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<p>Had Arias and his colleagues themselves seen Torres' report they would not
have had to conjecture, as they did (and rightly), that the land which lay on
Torres' right hand included New Guinea, as Torres' report leaves no room for
question on the point. They therefore must have obtained the information at
second hand. The report was almost new&mdash;at the most not fourteen years
old&mdash;and must have been zealously kept a secret if even priests powerful
enough to lecture the King on his neglect of duty, with impunity, were denied a
sight of it.</p>
<p>It was not Torres' report but Arias' summary of it which was known to
Dalrymple in 1768 (although it may have been in his possession, but still
untranslated), and we may believe that it had already come to the knowledge of
Robert de Vaugondy between 1752 and 1756.</p>
<p>Torres' report, or a copy of it, was discovered in the archives of Manila in
1762. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> It was first presented to English
readers in a translation by Dalrymple in Captain James Burney's <i>Discoveries
in the South Sea</i>, 1806, Part II, p. 467. The translation is</p>
<blockquote>[1) An English translation is given by R. H. Major in <i>Early
Voyages to Terra Australis</i>. London, Hakluyt Soc., 1859. Another is printed
in the same Society's <i>Voyages of Quiros</i>, 1904. A portion of it is given
by Collingridge, p. 225.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Flinders, <i>Voyage to Terra Australis in 1801, 1802 and
1803</i>. London, 1814. In vol. i. p. 10, Flinders writes: "Torres, it should
appear, took the precaution to lodge a copy of his letter in the Archives of
Manila, for after that town was taken by the British forces in 1762, Mr.
DALRYMPLE found out and drew from oblivion this interesting document of early
discovery; and...NAMED the passage TORRES STRAIT."]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 96}</u></p>
<p>reprinted in Collingridge, p. 229, where it is more accessible to the
general reader. Captain Burney refers (p. 272) to the manuscript as
follows:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Mr. Dalrymple has in his possession a copy of the
Narrative written by de Torres, of which he has made an English translation...I
have to acknowledge the being favoured with the use of this valuable
manuscript."</blockquote>
<p>Although Dalrymple had been in possession of a copy of the Torres'
manuscript since 1762, or shortly thereafter, he was unaware of its contents in

MUTINEERS.</b></p>
<p>William Bligh was born in Cornwall about 1753. He was Sailing Master of the
"<i>Resolution</i>" in Captain Cook's Second Expedition. In 1781 he took part
in the naval action off the Dogger Bank, and next year fought under Howe at
Gibraltar.</p>
<p>The story of the MUTINY OF THE "BOUNTY" has been so often told that it need
only be referred to here as the event which led to Bligh's acquaintance with
the Cape York Peninsula and Torres Strait, which is our immediate concern. His
memorable voyage in the "BOUNTY'S" LAUNCH brings into prominence the
characteristic faults and virtues of one who was at the same time a capable and
courageous navigator and an insufferable master.</p>
<p>The story is told in two books issued by Bligh. The first may be referred
to, by way of "short title," as the <i>Narrative</i> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and the second as the <i>Voyage</i>. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> The <i>Narrative</i> was written and published with all
possible speed as Bligh's vindication of his conduct, and commences with the
departure of the ship from Otaheite on 4th April, 1789, reviews the incidents
of the mutiny of 29th April, and ends with Bligh's arrival at Portsmouth on</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>A Narrative of the Mutiny on board His Majesty's Ship

<p>14th March, 1790. The Voyage commences with the departure of the
"<i>Bounty</i>" from Spithead on 23rd December, 1788, and includes a revised
edition of the <i>Narrative</i>. (ADMIRALTY CHART, No. 780.)</p>
<p>At Tofua, twenty-five of the mutineers took possession of the
"<i>Bounty</i>" and forced Bligh and eighteen others, loyal to him, or at least
obnoxious to the ringleaders, on board the ship's launch, and cast them adrift.
The names of the men in the boat were:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
Lieut. William Bligh, Commander.
John Fryer, Master.
Thomas Ledward, Acting Surgeon.
David Nelson, Botanist.
William Peckover, Gunner.
William Cole, Boatswain.
William Purcell, Carpenter.
William Elphinston, Master's Mate.
Thomas Hayward, Midshipman.
John Mallet, Midshipman.
John Norton, Quartermaster.
Peter Linkletter, Quartermaster.
Laurence Lebogue, Sailmaker.
John Smith, Cook.
Thomas Hall, Cook.
George Simpson, Quartermaster's Mate.
Robert Tinkler, Boy.
Robert Lamb, Butcher.
&mdash;&mdash;. Samuel, Clerk.
</pre>
<p>Left in this plight, says Bligh:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"My first determination was to seek a supply of
breadfruit and water at Tofua, and afterwards to sail for Tonga Taboo, and
there risk a solicitation to Poulaho, the king, to equip our boat and grant us
a supply of water and provisions, so as to enable us to reach the East
Indies."</blockquote>
<p>A stock-taking of the provisions on board furnished a very brief inventory:
"Bread, 150 lb.; Pork, 32 lb.; Wine, 6 bottles; Empty Barracoes, 4"&mdash;about
nine days' rations on a most economical scale. Three days' foraging in TOFUA
produced only a few coco-nuts and plantains. On 1st May, thirty NATIVES were
met with, and supplied a small quantity of food in exchange for buttons and
beads. Next day, the crew, as they were getting into the boat, were stoned by
200 natives, John Norton being killed and every other man being more or less
seriously injured. The idea of seeking aid from the king was abandoned. A fresh
stock-taking showed that 12 lb. of the pork and three bottles of wine had been
consumed: the bread (150 lb.) was intact, and five quarts of rum were
discovered. With this provision, the voyage to Timor, <i>via</i> New Holland,
was commenced on the evening of 2nd May. The nights were cold; the sea was
rough enough</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 99}</u></p>
<p>to enforce constant bailing; and there were frequent heavy rains, which at
any rate enabled the unhappy men to catch drinking water. The rough weather
continued till 26th May, and in all the twenty-four days the only addition to
the food supply consisted of three small birds, two boobies and a noddy. As the
boat approached Australia, birds became comparatively plentiful. On 28th May,
the boat touched the BARRIER REEF, but a passage was found in 12&deg; 51'. The
mainland of AUSTRALIA was sighted, as well as an island, which Bligh named
DIRECTION ISLAND. (SEE MAP C.)</p>
<p>This region is thus described by Bligh:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"As we advanced within the reefs, the coast began to
show itself very distinctly as a variety of high and low land, some parts of
which were covered with wood. In our way towards the shore, we fell in with a
point of a reef which is connected with that towards the sea [the shoals south
of CHAPMAN ISLAND, which are almost connected with the 'FREDERICK PATCHES' to
the east.&mdash;R. L. J.] and here we came to a grapnel, and tried to catch
fish, but had no success. The ISLAND DIRECTION at this time lay about 4 miles
to the W. by N. and appeared eligible for a resting-place, if for nothing more;
but on our approaching to the nearest island [Ashton Rock?__R. L. J.] it proved
to be only a heap of stones, and its size too inconsiderable to shelter the
boat. We therefore proceeded to the next [ROCKY ISLAND, 130 feet high, and
presumably what Bligh named Direction Island, from the circumstance of its
being where he picked up his bearings.&mdash;R. L. J.], which was close to it
and towards the main. On the north-west side of this island, I found a bay, and
a fine sandy point to land at. Our distance was about a quarter of a mile from
a projecting part of the main [ViLLis POINT?&mdash;R. L. J.], which bore from
SW. by S. to NNW.&frac34;W., we landed [presumably on the mainland south of
Villis Point.&mdash;R. L. J.] to examine if there were any signs of the
natives...We saw some old fireplaces, but nothing to make me apprehend that
this would be an unsafe situation."</blockquote>
<p>The tide was low, and by this time it was nearly dark. Oysters were found,
and some of the party spent the night on shore.</p>
<p>Next morning (29th May), the boat passed what is now known as CAPE
DIRECTION, and ran the chord of the arc of LLOYD BAY (20 miles), making for the
furthest visible point of land, which proved on closer acquaintance to be an
island. Bligh took its latitude at noon, 12&deg; 39' (12&deg; 37&frac12;'
really, but near enough for identification). (SEE MAP B.) The men dug and got
water; found oysters in abundance; made a fire with a magnifying glass; and
indulged in a generous stew of oysters and palm tops. "This day," says Bligh,
"being the anniversary of the restoration of King Charles II, and the name not
being inapplicable to our present situation (for we were restored to fresh life
and strength), I named this RESTORATION ISLAND."</p>
<p>Being now, as he thought, in a land flowing with water and edibles, Bligh
felt himself justified in distributing the remainder of the pork. Next morning
(30th May), after prayers, he resumed the voyage to the north. As the men bent
to the oars, they saw, on the mainland, a crowd of NATIVES, who were armed with
spears</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 100}</u></p>
<p>and wimmeras, and who invited them to come ashore; but the invitation was
declined.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I directed my course," continues Bligh, "within two
small islands [Blue Bell Rocks?&mdash;R. L. J.] that lie to the N.
[NNW.&mdash;R. L. J.] of Restoration Island, passing between them and the
mainland towards Fair Cape [WEYMOUTH BAY, which extends from Restoration Island
to Fair Cape.&mdash;R. L. J.]...I was abreast of it [FAIR CAPE] by 8 o'clock.
The coast we passed was high and woody [CARRON RANGE.&mdash;R. L. J.]. As I
could see no land beyond Fair Cape, I concluded that the coast inclined to the
NW. and WNW. I therefore steered more towards the W.; but by 11 o'clock at
night we met with low land which inclined to the NE.; and at 3 o'clock in the
morning [Sunday, 31st May], I found that we were embayed [He had met with the
promontory of CAPE GRENVILLE, which is the northern limit of TEMPLE BAY, the
southern being Fair Cape.&mdash;R. L. J.], which obliged us to stand back for a
short time to the southward."</blockquote>
<p>When daylight came (Sunday, 31st May), it was found that the aspect of the
country had completely changed.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"There was now," says Bligh," a low sandy coast,
with very little verdure, or anything to indicate that it was at all habitable
to a human being, except a few patches of small trees or brushwood [the heathy
swamp land, interspersed with sandhills, between the Macmillan River and Temple
Bay.&mdash;R. L. J.]. Many small islands [COCKBURN ISLANDS.&mdash;R. L. J.]
were in sight to the NE., about 6 miles distant. The east part of the main
[CAPE GRENVILLE.&mdash;R. L. J.] bore N., 4 miles, and FAIR CAPE SSE., 5 or 6
leagues. I took the channel between the nearest island and the mainland [CAPE
GRENVILLE.&mdash;R. L. J.] which were all about a mile apart, leaving all the
islands on the starboard side. Some of these were very pretty spots, covered
with wood and well situated for fishing. Large shoals of fish were about us,
but we could not catch any. In passing this strait, we saw another party of
INDIANS, seven in number, running towards us, shouting and making signs for us
to land. Some of them waved green branches of the bushes which were near them,
as a token of friendship; but some of their other motions were less friendly. A
little further off, we saw a larger party, who likewise came towards us. I
therefore determined not to land, though I much wished to have had some
intercourse with these people. Nevertheless, I laid the boat close to the
rocks, and beckoned them to approach; but none of them would come within 200
yards of us. An island [SUNDAY ISLAND] of a good height [157 feet] bore N. W.,
4 miles from us, at which I resolved to land, and from thence to take a look at
the coast. At this isle we arrived about 8 o'clock in the morning. The shore
was rocky, but the water was smooth, and we landed without difficulty. I sent
two parties out, one north and the other south, to seek for supplies, and
others I ordered to stay by the boat. On this occasion, fatigue and weakness so
far got the better of their sense of duty that some of the people expressed
their discontent at having worked harder than their companions, and declared
that they would rather be without their dinner than go in search of it. One
person in particular went so far as to tell me, with a MUTINOUS LOOK, that he
was as good a man as myself. It was not possible for me to judge where this
might have an end, if not stopped in time; therefore, to prevent such disputes
in future, I determined either to preserve my command or die in the attempt;
and, seizing a cutlass, I ordered him to take hold of another and defend
himself; on which he called out that I was going to kill him, and immediately
made concessions. I did not allow this to interfere further with the harmony of
the boat's crew, and everything became quiet."</blockquote>
<p>The parties collected oysters and clams and a few small fish, and water
enough for their requirements. Bligh himself climbed</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 101}</u></p>
<p>to the highest peak (157 feet), and named the scene of the disturbance
SUNDAY ISLAND. On rejoining the boat, he steered NW. by N., in which direction
he saw a small "key," alongside which he grappled at night. At dawn on the
following day (Monday, 1st June), he landed, and named LAGOON KEY. This was the
south-western of Cook's BIRD ISLANDS. He observed the shells and tracks of
turtles, but the only edibles collected were clams and dolichos (beans). The
ruins of a native dwelling were observed.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"After 8 o'clock, Mr. Samuel and Mr. Peckover went
out to watch for turtle, and three men went to the east [north-east] key to
endeavour to catch birds. All the others, complaining of being sick, took their
rest, except Mr. Heywood [Hayward] and Mr. Elphinston, whom I directed to keep
watch. About midnight, the bird party returned, with only 12 noddies, birds
which I have already described to be about the size of pigeons; but if it had
not been for the folly and obstinacy of one of the party, Robert Lamb, (This
man, when he went to Java, acknowledged he had eaten nine birds raw after he
separated from his two companions), who separated from the other two and
disturbed the birds, they must have caught a great number. I was so much
provoked at my plans being thus defeated that I gave the offender a good
beating. I now [Tuesday, 2nd June] went in search of the turtling party, who
had taken great pains, but without success."</blockquote>
<p>The party embarked at dawn on Tuesday, 2nd June, and set a course N. by W.
In about two leagues, the sea became very rough, from which Bligh inferred that
he was opposite an open channel in the Barrier Reef. Beyond this there was a
large shoal, (V Reef), on which were two sandy keys. Between these keys and two
others, 4 miles to the west (HANNIBAL and BUSHY ISLANDS), Bligh passed on his
way northward. His journal continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Towards noon, I fell in with six other keys
[BOYDONG CAYS and HALFWAY ISLAND.&mdash;R. L. J.], most of which produced some
small trees and brushwood. These formed a pleasing contrast with the mainland
we had passed, which was full of sandhills, and the northmost land...appeared
like downs, sloping towards the sea. Nearly abreast of us was a flat-topped
hill, which, on account of its shape, I called PUDDING PAN HiLL, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and a little to the north were two other hills which we
called THE PAPS, and here was a small tract of country without sand, the
eastern part of which forms a cape [ORFORD NESS.&mdash;R. L. J.], whence the
coast inclines to the NW. by N." [SEE MAP A.]</blockquote>
At noon, Bligh observed the latitude of 11&deg; 18' S., the Cape bearing W., at
an estimated distance of 10 miles. A few miles further, "five small keys bore
W. [SW.?], distant 4 miles. My course from the Lagoon Island had been N.W.,
distance 30 miles."
<p>This day the gunner's watch was lost, so that, as Bligh remarked, "sunrise,
noon and sunset for the future were the only points of time accurately
known."</p>
<blockquote>[1) The tragic events which followed Kennedy's mistaking a similar
sandstone-capped hill, 50 miles to the south, for Pudding Pan Hill, are related
in a subsequent chapter.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 102}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">"At 5 p.m.," continues Bligh, "steering to the NW.,
we passed a large and fair inlet [ESCAPE RIVER, in 10&deg; 58'.&mdash;R. L.
J.], into which, I imagine, there is a safe and commercial entrance. It lies in
lat. 11&deg; S. About three leagues [miles?&mdash;R. L. J.] to the north of
this, is an island, at which we arrived about sunset, and took shelter for the
night under a sandy point which was the only part we could land at...The island
was covered with wood, but in other respects it was a lump of rock.<br>
<br>
"Wednesday, 3rd June. We lay at grapnel till daylight. The main bore from SE.
by S. to NNW. &frac12;W., 3 leagues; and a mountainous island with a flat top
[MOUNT ADOLPHUS ISLAND.&mdash;R. L. J.] N. by W., 4 or 5 leagues, between which
and the mainland were several other islands. The spot we were at, which I call
TURTLE ISLAND [He grappled to the island on Tuesday night, and therefore it
would be his TUESDAY ISLAND.&mdash;R. L. J.], lies in latitude, by account,
10&deg; 52' S. [say, 10&deg; 55' S.&mdash;R. L. J.]. Abreast of it, the coast
has the appearance of a sandy desert, but improves about 3 leagues further to
the northward, where it terminates in a point, near to which are many small
islands. I sailed between these islands, where I found no bottom at 12 fathoms
[He did not take the Albany Pass, in which the greatest depth is 11
fathoms.&mdash;R. L. J.], the high mountainous land with a flat top [MOUNT
ADOLPHUS ISLAND.&mdash;R. L. J.] and four rocks to the SE. of it, that I call
the BROTHERS, being on my starboard hand. Soon after, an extensive opening
appeared in the mainland [He evidently considered Prince of Wales and other
high islands to be part of the mainland.&mdash;R. L. J.], in which were a
number of high islands. I called this the Bay of Islands. We continued steering
to the NW. Several islands [ENDEAVOUR STRAIT, across which a chain of islands
(including Cook's Possession Island), stretching westward from Peak Point, Cape
York, to Rattlesnake Point, Prince of Wales Island.&mdash;R. L. J.] and keys
were in sight to the northward. The most northerly island was mountainous,
having on it a very high round hill; and a smaller was remarkable for a
single-peaked hill.<br>
<br>
"The coast to the northward and westward of the Bay of Islands [HORN and PRINCE
OF WALES ISLANDS.&mdash;R. L. J.] is high and woody, and has a broken
appearance, with many islands close to it, amongst which there are fine bays
and convenient places for shipping. The northernmost of these islands I call
WEDNESDAY ISLAND [Wednesday, 3rd June, 1789]. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
To the NW. of this, we fell in with a large reef [NORTH-WEST REEF.&mdash;R. L.
J.], which, I believe, joins a number of keys that were in sight from the NW.
to the ENE. We therefore stood to the SW., half a league, when it was noon, and
I had a good observation of the latitude in 10&deg; 31' S. Wednesday Island
bore E. by S., 5 miles; the westmost land in sight [HAMMOND ISLAND.&mdash;R. L.
J.], SW., 2 or 3 leagues; the islands to the northward from NW. by W. to NE.;
and the reef from W. to NE., distant 1 mile. I was now tolerably certain that
we should be clear of New Holland in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
"I know not how far this reef extends. It may be a continuation or a detached
part of the range of shoals that surround the coast. I believe the mountainous
islands [PRINCE OF WALES ISLAND.&mdash;R. L. J.] to be separate from the
shoals, and have no doubt that near them may be found good passages for ships.
But I rather recommend those who are to pass this strait from the eastward to
take their direction from the coast of New Guinea. Yet I likewise think that a
ship coming from the southward will find a fair strait in the latitude of
10&deg; S...<br>
<br>
"At 2 p.m., as we were steering towards the westernmost part of the land in
sight, we fell in with some large sandbanks that run off from the coast. I
therefore called this SHOAL CAPE. We were obliged to steer to the northward
again till we got round the shoals, when I directed my course to the west.<br>
<br>
"At 4 o'clock, the westernmost of the islands to the northward bore N., 4
leagues;</blockquote>
<blockquote>[1) Bligh did not name Tuesday, Thursday or Friday Islands. He
anchored on Tuesday at Turtle Island. After leaving Wednesday Island on
Wednesday, 3rd June, he took the Prince of Wales Channel and reached Booby
Island in the afternoon. The earliest reference to Thursday Island which has
come under my notice is contained in Lieut. James Grant's <i>Narrative of a
Voyage of Discovery in the "Lady Nelson," 1801-2</i>. London,
1803.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 103}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">Wednesday Island E. by N., 5 leagues; and Shoal Cape
SE. by E., 2 leagues. A small island was seen bearing W., at which we arrived
before dark, and found that it was only a rock, where boobies resort, for which
reason I called it BOOBY ISLAND. Here terminated the rocks and shoals of the
north part of New Holland, for, except Booby Island, no land was seen to the
westward of south after 3 o'clock this afternoon.<br>
<br>
"I find that Booby Island was seen by Captain Cook, and, by a remarkable
coincidence of ideas, received from him the same name; but I cannot with
certainty reconcile the situation of some parts of the coast that I have seen
to his survey. I ascribe this to the various forms in which land appears when
seen from the different heights of a ship and a boat.<br>
<br>
"The chart which I have given is by no means meant to supersede that made by
Captain Cook, who had better opportunities than I had and was in every respect
properly provided for surveying. The intention of mine is chiefly to render
this narrative more intelligible, and to show in what manner the coast appeared
to me from an open boat. I have but little doubt but that the opening which I
have named the BAY OF ISLANDS is ENDEAVOUR STRAITS; and that our track was to
the northward of Prince of Wales Isles. Perhaps, by those who may hereafter
navigate these seas, more advantage may be derived from the possession of both
our charts than from either of them singly."</blockquote>
<p>Without landing on BOOBY ISLAND, Bligh left it late on 3rd June. He reached
KOEPANG, Timor, on 14th June, 1789, and having obtained a passage to Europe on
a Dutch vessel, landed at PORTSMOUTH on 14th March, 1790. Nine of the mutineers
found their way to Pitcairn Island, where they married native women and founded
a colony, which is still in existence. The fate of the other sixteen is bound
up with the voyage and wreck of the frigate "<i>Pandora</i>" to which a chapter
must be devoted.</p>

<p>The "<i>Pandora</i>" a frigate carrying 160 men and 24 guns, was commanded
by CAPTAIN (afterwards Admiral) EDWARD EDWARDS. Her commission was to capture
and bring to punishment the mutineers who had seized the "<i>Bounty</i>" one of
His Majesty's ships of war, and turned her Captain and his adherents adrift in
an unvictualled open boat.</p>
<p>The fullest record of this voyage is the narrative of the Surgeon, George
Hamilton. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Next in importance as regards
detail, though probably more reliable as to the navigation, are the Commander's
Reports to the Admiralty, especially one dealing with the wreck on the Barrier
Reef and the subsequent passage of the survivors, in four boats, through Torres
Strait. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> Then a Chart of the Voyage, up to the
date of the wreck, was constructed by Lieutenant Hayward, and was published in
1798 by Alexander Dalrymple. From the above materials, Flinders compiled a
short account of the voyage for his introductory chapter of <i>Terra
Australis</i> (I, XVI). On his own chart, he copied the <i>route</i>, as far as
the wreck, from Dalrymple; but he frankly admitted that, as regards the boat
voyage, the imperfection of the narrative had baffled his editorial capacity.
No serious attempt to identify the <i>route</i> followed by the boats appears
to have been made up to 1915, when Basil Thomson, <b style=

Commander and Surgeon.</p>
<p>The "<i>Pandora</i>" left Portsmouth in August, 1790, and reached TAHITI on
23rd March, 1791. Here sixteen of the MUTINEERS had settled down, but two had
already been killed by the natives. The fourteen remaining were arrested and
confined on board the "<i>Pandora</i>" The frigate left Tahiti on 8th May, and
after having made some search (without having any clue) for the "<i>Bounty</i>"
continued her voyage, <i>via</i> Palmerston Island, Atafu, Samoa, the Friendly
Islands and Tongatabu, Wallis Island, the Santa Cruz Islands and Indispensable
Reefs, to the Great Barrier Reef. (SEE MAP A.) The latter was met with on 26th
August? in about 10&deg; S. lat. Steering westward, the MURRAY ISLANDS were
seen and named. The islands were found to be fringed by a reef, which forced
the ship to take a southerly course, interrupted by many attempts to find a
westerly passage. The last of these attempts was made on 29th August late in
the afternoon, when the ship grounded on the reef in about 11&deg; 24' S. lat.
The spot is now charted as PANDORA ENTRANCE. The "<i>Pandora</i>" was hammered
on the reef during the whole of the night, but at daylight next morning (30th
August) slipped over into deep water and SANK. Thirty-one of the ship's company
and four of the mutineers were drowned. Ninety-nine men answered the rollcall
and found temporary refuge on a sandbank about four miles from the wreck. Very
little could be saved and the party were almost destitute of provisions. It may
be assumed, however, that the Captain saved his sextant and charts and that
each of the boats carried a compass. A reference by Hamilton to the boat's
position "at meridian" makes it probable that Lieutenant Larkin, on the "red
yawl," had a sextant.</p>
<p>From this point it is necessary to compare the reports of the Commander and
Surgeon, remembering always that the two witnesses were in different boats,
which parted company for a time.</p>

and WNW., within the reef. This channel through the reef is better than any
hitherto known, besides the advantage it has of being situated further to the
north, by which many difficulties would be avoided when within the reef. In the
run from thence to the entrance of <i>Endeavour</i> Straits, there is a small
white island or key on the larboard end of the channel, which lies in latitude
l1&deg; 23' S. The sides are strong and irregular.<br>

<h4>SURGEON HAMILTON</h4>
<blockquote class="inline">"Everything being ready on the following day, 1st
September, at 12 o'clock [10.30 a.m., Captain], we embarked in our little
squadron, each boat having been previously supplied with the latitude and
longitude of the island of Timor, 1,100 miles from this place. Our order of
sailing was as follows:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"<i>In the Pinnace.</i> CAPTAIN EDWARDS; Lt. Hayward; Mr. Rickards, Master's
Mate; Mr. Packer, Gunner; Mr. Edmonds, Captain's Clerk; Three Prisoners;
Sixteen Privates.<br>
<br>
"<i>In the Red Yawl.</i> Lt. Larkin; MR. GEORGE HAMILTON, SURGEON; Mr.
Reynolds, Master's Mate; Mr. Matson, Midshipman; Two Prisoners; Eighteen
Privates.<br>
<br>
"<i>In the Launch.</i> Lt. Corner; Mr. Gregory Bentham, Purser; Mr. Montgomery,
Carpenter; Mr. Bowling, Master's Mate; Mr. McKendrick, Midshipman; Two
Prisoners; Twenty-four Privates.<br>
<br>
"<i>In the Blue Yawl.</i> Mr. George Passmore, Master; Mr. Cunningham,
Boatswain; Mr. James Innes, Surgeon's Mate; Mr. Fenwick, Midshipman; Three
Prisoners; Fifteen Privates.<br>
<br>
"As soon as we embarked, we laid the oars upon the thwarts, which formed a
platform, by which means we stowed two tiers of men. A pair of wooden scales
was made in each boat, and a musket-ball weight of bread served to each
man.<br>
<br>
"At meridian, we saw a key, bounded with white craggy rocks. As the principal
part of our subsistence was in the launch, it was necessary to keep together,
both for our defence and support. We towed each other during the night and at
daybreak cast off the tow-line.<br>
<br>
"At 8 in the morning [2nd September] the red and blue yawls were sent ahead to
sound and investigate the coast of New South Wales and to search for a watering
place. The country had been described as very destitute of the article of
water; but on entering a very fine bay [Orford Bay.&mdash;R. L. J.] we found
most excellent water rushing from a spring at the very edge of the beach. Here
we filled our bellies, a tea kettle and two quart pots. The pinnace and launch
had gone too far ahead to observe any signal of our success, and immediately we
set sail after them. The coast has a very barren aspect, and from the
appearance of the soil and land, looks like a country abounding with
minerals.<br>
<br>
"As we passed round the bay [towards Usher Point, west of Gilmore
Bank.&mdash;R. L. J.] two CANOES, with three black men in each, put off and
paddled very hard to get near us. They stood up in the canoes, waved, and made
signs for us to come to them. But as they were perfectly naked, had a very
savage aspect, and having heard an indifferent account of the NATIVES of that
country, we judged it prudent to avoid them.<br>
<br>
"In two hours we joined the pinnace and launch, which were lying to for us. At
10 at night, we were alarmed with the dreadful cry of 'Breakers ahead.' We had
got amongst a reef of rocks; and in our present state, being worn out and
fatigued, it is difficult to say how we got out of them, as the place was
fraught with dangers all round...After running along, we came to an inhabited
island, from which we promised ourselves a supply of water. [It was evidently
daylight, and therefore 3rd September.&mdash;R. L. J.] On our approach, the
NATIVES flocked down to the beach in crowds...We made signals of distress to
them for something to drink which they understood; and on receiving some
trifling presents...they brought us a</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 107}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">cag of good water, which we emptied in a minute, and
then sent if back to be filled again. They, however, would not bring it the
second time, but put it down on the beach and made signs to us to come on shore
for it. This we declined, as we observed the women and children running and
supplying the men with bows and arrows. In a few minutes, they let fly a shower
of arrows amongst the thick of us. Luckily, we had not a man wounded; but an
arrow fell between the Captain and Third Lieutenant and went through the boat's
thwart and stuck in it. We immediately discharged a volley of muskets at them,
which put them to flight. There were, however, none of them killed. We now
abandoned all hopes of refreshment here. This island lies contiguous to
Mountainous Island [Mount Adolphus Island.&mdash;R. L. J.]. It may be observed
that the channel through the reef is better than any hitherto known. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> We ascertained the latitudes with the greatest accuracy
and exactness."</blockquote>
<p>The writer goes on to advise the Government to plant pines and coco-nut
palms as landmarks.</p>
<h4>CAPTAIN EDWARDS</h4>
<blockquote class="inline">"I steered for an island called by Lieutenant Bligh
Mountainous Island, and when joined by the boats [2nd September] ran into a bay
of that island [3rd September, MOUNT ADOLPHUS ISLAND.&mdash;R. L. J.], where we
saw INDIANS on the beach. The water was shoal, and the Indians waded off to the
boats. I gave them some presents and made them sensible that we were in want of
water. They brought us a vessel filled with water, which had been given them
for the purpose, and they returned to fill it again. They used many signs to
signify they wished us to land, but we declined their invitation from motives
of prudence.<br>
<br>
"Just as a person was entering the water with the second vessel of water, an
arrow was discharged at us by another person, which struck my boat on the
quarter, and perceiving that they were collecting bows and arrows, a volley of
small arms was fired at them, which put them to flight. I did not think proper
to land and get water by force, as land was seen at that time in different
directions, which by appearance was likely to produce that article, and which I
flattered myself we might be able to procure without being drove to that
extremity. I therefore ran close along the shore of this island and landed at
different places at some distance from the former situation. I also landed at
another island near it, which I called PLUM ISLAND [Thomson's footnote: 'TREE
ISLAND.' Possibly LITTLE ADOLPHUS ISLAND. R. L. J.], from its producing a
species of that fruit, but we were unsuccessful in finding the article we were
in search of and in so much want of.<br>
<br>
<p>"In the evening [3rd September] we steered for the islands which we supposed
were those called by Captain Cook the PRINCE OF WALES ISLANDS, and before
midnight came to a grapnel...near one of these islands, in a large sound formed
by several of the surrounding islands, to several of which we gave names, and
called the sound SANDWICH SouND. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> It is fit for
the reception of ships, having from 5 to 7 fathoms of water. There is plenty of
wood on most of the islands, and by digging we found very good water [in the
morning of 4th September. R.L.J.] on the flat part of a large island which I
called LAFORY'S ISLAND [Basil Thomson's Note: HORN ISLAND], situated on the
larboard hand as we entered the sound from the eastward. We saw a burying-place
and several wolves [Basil Thomson's Note: 'Dingoes'] near the watering-place,
but we saw no natives. Here we filled our several vessels with water and made
two canvas bags, in which we also put water, but with this assistance we had
barely the means to take a gallon of water for each man in the boats. We

savages to other islands in sight, and sent some armed men on shore...without
success. This island we called PLUMB ISLAND, from its bearing an austere,
astringent kind of fruit, resembling plumbs, but not fit to eat.<br>
<br>
"In the evening, we steered for these islands which we supposed were called the
PRINCE OF WALES ISLANDS, and about 2 o'clock in the morning [4th September.
'Before midnight,' says the Captain], came to anchor, with a grappling,
alongside of an island, which we called LAFORY'S ISLAND [HORN ISLAND]. As the
night was very dark, and this was the last land that could afford us relief,
all hands went to sleep.<br>
<br>
"The morning [4th September] was ushered in with the howling of WOLVES, who had
smelt us in the night...Lieutenant Corner and a party were sent at daylight to
search again for water; and, as we approached, the wild beasts retired and
filled the woods with their hideous growling."</blockquote>
<p>Water was discovered on digging in a hollow. Signs of recent human presence
were also observed.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"After having gorged our parched bodies with water
till we were perfectly waterlogged, we began to feel the cravings of
hunger&mdash;a new sensation of misery we had hitherto been strangers to, from
the excess of thirst predominating. We found a harsh, austere, astringent
fruit, resembling a plumb...We permitted the men to fill their bellies with
them. There was also a small berry, of similar taste to the plumb...We
carefully avoided shooting at any bird, lest the report...should alarm the
natives, whom we had every reason to suspect were at no great distance...When
every other thing was filled with water, the carpenter's boots were also
filled. The water in them was first served out, on account of leakage.<br>
<br>
"There is a large sound here, to which we gave the name of SANDWICH'S SOUND
[now FLINDERS PASSAGE], and commodious anchorage for shipping in the bay, to
which we gave the name of WOLF'S BAY, in which there is from 5 to 7 fathoms
water all around. This is extremely well situated for a <i>rendezvous</i> in
surveying <i>Endeavour</i> Straits; and were a little colony settled here, a
concatenation of Christian settlements would enchain the world and be useful to
any unfortunate ship;...or should a rupture take place with South America, a
great vein of commerce might find its way through this channel.<br>
<br>
"HAMMOND'S ISLAND lies NW. by W., PARKER'S ISLAND [WEDNESDAY ISLAND?] from N.
and by W. to N. and by E., and an island seen to the north entrance NW. We
supposed it to be an island called by Captain Bligh MOUNTAINOUS ISLAND [now
BANKS ISLAND.&mdash;R. L. J.], laid down in latitude 10&deg; 16' S. [The island
now charted as Hammond Island may or may not be the one so named on this
occasion, as the above confused description does not tally with anything when
the bearings are plotted on the modern chart. The name, however, has been
perpetuated, but must be regarded as a 'complimentary' one.&mdash;R. L. J.]<br>
<br>
<p>"SANDWICH'S SOUND is formed by Hammond's, Parker's and a cluster of small
islands on the stat board hand at its eastern entrance. We also called a back
land behind Hammond' s Island and the other islands to the southward of it,
CORNWALLIS LAND. The uppermost part of the mountain was separated from the main
by a large gap. Under the gap, low land was seen; but whether that was a
continuation of the main or not we could not determine. Near the centre of the
sound is a small, dark-coloured, rocky island. [By a 'back land,' Hamilton
probably meant a land</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 109}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">behind the boats, and on this assumption his
CORNWALLIS LAND was probably PRINCE OF WALES ISLAND.&mdash;R. L. J.]<br>
<br>
"This afternoon, at 3 o'clock, being the 4th of September, our little squadron
sailed again, and in the evening saw a high-peaked island lying NW., which we
called HAWKESBURY'S ISLAND [It rises to 560 feet]. The passage through the
north entrance [i.e., between Flinders Passage and Prince of Wales
Channel.&mdash;R. L. J.] is about 2 miles wide. After passing through it, saw a
reef. As we approached it, we shallowed our water to 3 fathoms; but on hauling
up more to the SW. we deepened it again to 6 fathoms. Saw several large turtle,
but could not catch any...After clearing the reef, stood to the westward.
Mountainous Island [BANKS ISLAND] bore N.&frac12;E.; Captain Bligh's WEST
ISLAND, which appears in three hummocks, NNW.; a rock [RED WALLIS ISLAND] NW.,
at the SW. extreme of the mainland, S. and by E.; and the NORTHERNMOST CAPE OF
NEW SOUTH WALES SSE. [Not really Cape York, but the projecting hump of land
west of the mouth of the Jardine River and south of Cook's Possession
Island.&mdash;R. L. J.]; and to the extreme of the land in sight, the eastward
E.JN., a small distance from the nearest of the Prince of Wales Islands, we
discovered another island, and which we called CHRISTIAN'S ISLAND. Saw two
hummocks [DUNCAN ISLANDS, or PHIPPS and SPENCER ISLANDS.&mdash;R. L. J.]
between Hawkesbury's Island and Mountainous Island; but could not be certain
whether it was one or two islands.<br>
<br>
"We now entered the great Indian Ocean, and had a voyage of 1,000 miles to
undertake in our open boats. As soon as we cleared the land, we found a very
heavy swell running, which threatened destruction to our little fleet; for
should we have separated, we must inevitably perish for want of water, as we
had not utensils to divide our slender stock. For our mutual preservation, we
took each other in tow again."</blockquote>
<h4>CAPTAIN EDWARDS</h4>
<blockquote class="inline">"On the 4th September, at half-past 3 in the
afternoon, we stood out of the north entrance of the sound i.e., out of
FLINDERS PASSAGE into PRINCE OF WALES CHANNEL.&mdash;R. L. J.]. Before 5, we
saw a reef extending from the N. to the WNW., and which appeared to run in the
latter direction, or more to the westward [NORTH-WEST REEF], On the edge of
this reef, we had 3&frac34; fathoms of water, and after hauling to the
southwest we soon deepened our water to 5 fathoms. Besides Mountainous and West
Islands, seen by Lieutenant Bligh, we saw several other islands between the
north and the west, one of which I called HAWKESBURY ISLAND...<br>
<br>
"In the evening, we saw the NORTHERNMOST EXTREMITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES [really
the hump of land west of the mouth of the Jardine River.&mdash;R. L. J.], which
forms the south side of <i>Endeavour</i> Straits. At night the boats took each
other in tow and we steered to the westward.<br>
<br>
"It is unnecessary to retail our particular sufferings in the boats during our
run to TIMOR, and it is sufficient to observe the company suffered more from
heat and thirst than from hunger, and that our strength was greatly decreased.
We fortunately had good weather."</blockquote>
<p>Surgeon Hamilton states that "we ascertained the latitudes with the greatest
accuracy and exactness," a claim which he would hardly have made on his own
account, and which, it may be conjectured, he simply copied from the Captain's
log, of which the latter evidently made only a short abstract for his reports
to the Admiralty. Nor, I imagine, would the Captain himself have made such a
claim unless he had been provided with a sextant. The Captain gives the
position of MURRAY ISLANDS as 9&deg; 57' S. and 216&deg; 43' W = 143&deg; 17'
E.; and the WRECK REEF is also given in his table, but the figures are left
blank. The Surgeon gives the same position to the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 110}</u></p>
<p>Murray Islands, and fills in the blank at the Wreck Reef with the figures
11&deg; 22' S. and 216&deg; 22' W. = 143&deg; 38' E. The inference is that he
copied from the Captain's log, and set down, without question, <i>data</i>
regarding which the Captain himself had some doubt, so that he omitted them
from his report.</p>
<p>After many attempts at plotting from Hamilton's <i>data</i>, on various
hypotheses as to his meaning, I can no more make head or tail of the positions
of the islands and other landmarks mentioned by him than could Flinders,
although I had the advantage of more complete charts than were accessible to,
or made by, Flinders. One hypothesis, suggested by the Surgeon's tale, which I
tried by all possible tests, was that the boats went through <i>Endeavour</i>
Strait; but this is flatly contradicted by the Captain's narrative. I am
satisfied, therefore, that Basil Thomson is correct in supposing that the
"Sound" referred to by both Captain and Surgeon was neither <i>Endeavour</i>
Strait as a whole nor the passage between Entrance Island and Prince of Wales
Island, but the strait between Horn and Wednesday Islands, now known as
Flinders Passage. Edwards thus anticipated Flinders (in the
"<i>Cumberland</i>") by twelve years. The island named LAFORY'S was, no doubt,
as suggested by Basil Thomson, HORN ISLAND, and the "wolves" which Edwards saw
and Hamilton heard must have been DINGOES. This is the only mention of the
dingo as an indigenous inhabitant of the Torres Strait Islands which I have met
with.</p>
<p>Edwards, then, took the "<i>Pandora's</i>" boats through the FLINDERS
PASSAGE, and was actually its discoverer, rounded the north end of HAMMOND
ISLAND <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> entered the PRINCE OF WALES CHANNEL and
passed through its western half. The first to enter the Prince of Wales Channel
was GONZAL, in the "<i>Rijder</i>" in 1756. BLIGH, in the "<i>Bounty's</i>"
launch, in 1789, was the first to traverse it from end to end.</p>
<p>Endeavouring to maintain a westerly course through the Channel, Edwards
encountered the "NORTH-WEST REEF," and was forced by it southwards, nearly to
Good Island, before he found an open sea by which he could make westward for
Timor.</p>
<p>On emerging from the strait, a last glimpse of Australian land was obtained,
S. and by E. Both Edwards and Hamilton refer to this as the northernmost
extremity of New South Wales, Edwards adding "which forms the south side of
<i>Endeavour</i> Straits." The land visible from the observer's position could
not have been Cape York, which would be shut out by the high Prince of Wales
Island, and must have been the blunt promontory west of the MOUTH OF THE
JARDINE RIVER.</p>
<p>The provisions with which the boats left the scene of the wreck were
inventoried as "a small barrel of water, a keg of wine and some</p>
<blockquote>[1) He gave the name of Hammond to some island hereabouts, but his
narrative does not make it clear that it was the island now known by this
name.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 111}</u></p>
<p>biscuit." The ship's cat was saved from the wreck. The scanty fare was
supplemented by shellfish while the party sojourned among the Torres Strait
islands.</p>
<p>. The survivors got a passage from Koepang, in TIMOR, to Batavia and thence
to Europe. At the Cape of Good Hope, Edwards and his prisoners were transferred
to H.M.S. "<i>Gorgon</i>." They arrived at Spithead on 19th June, 1792. The
prisoners were tried by court martial, when six were condemned to death (18th
September), and three were executed.</p>
<p>It is beyond the limits of our task to relate the whole story of the mutiny,
one of the most tragic and romantic in modern history; but the reader who
desires to pursue the subject for its own inherent interest may refer to Sir
John Barrow's little book, <i>The Mutiny of the "Bounty"</i> (the World's
Classics, No. CXCV, 1914).</p>

<p>Having reached England after his perilous voyage in the open boat, following
on the mutiny of the "<i>Bounty</i>" and written his <i>Narrative</i>, BLIGH
was given command of H.M.S. "<i>Providence</i>" and was accompanied by the brig
"<i>Assistant</i>" under LIEUTENANT J. NATHANIEL PORTLOCK, in a second
expedition having for its object the transference of breadfruit from Tahiti to
the West Indies. He had thus another opportunity of traversing Torres Strait,
and this time he succeeded in his mission. So far as is known, he wrote no
report on this voyage, but he lodged his charts in the Admiralty Office. The
only available record of the voyage is the journal kept by MATTHEW FLINDERS,
who accompanied Bligh as a junior officer. (<i>Terra Australis</i>, Vol. I, pp.
xix. <i>et seq</i>.}. Bligh's charts, "with other authorities," were
incorporated in Plate XIII of Flinders' Atlas, and the journal was sanctioned
by Bligh, so that there is every reason for accepting it as authoritative. The
expedition left</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 113}</u></p>
<p>England in 1791. The quotations which follow are from Flinders' Journal.</p>
<p>Having come to the conclusion, when he threaded Torres Strait in the open
boat three years before, that ships attempting the passage from the east should
keep in touch with the New Guinea coast, Bligh took the "<i>Providence</i>" and
"<i>Assistant</i>" north of his former course. After passing south of the
Louisiade Archipelago and the south-eastern part of New Guinea, he sighted the
REEFS which he named after Captain PORTLOCK on 1st September, 1792. After
seeking vainly for a passage to the south, he steered to the north till he had
cleared the Portlock Reef, when he bore NW. and SSW. for the high land which he
named DARNLEY ISLAND, and anchored NE. of the island on 4th September, 1792. He
might, had he known the soundings, have set a straight course SW. for Dalrymple
Island, through what is now charted as "BLIGH ENTRANCE," but he did not,
preferring to make for the landmark to which he gave the name of Darnley. (SEE
MAP A.)</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"5th September, 1792. Boats were again sent to sound
the passage. Several large sailing canoes were seen, and the cutter making the
signal for assistance, the pinnace was sent to her, well manned and armed. On
the return of the boats in the afternoon, it appeared that of four canoes which
used their efforts to get up to the cutter, one succeeded. There were in it 15
INDIANS...and they made signs which were interpreted to be amicable. These
signs the officer imitated, but not thinking it prudent to go so near as to
take a green coco-nut which was held up to him, he continued rowing for the
ship. A man who was sitting upon the shed erected in the centre of the canoe
then said something to those below, and immediately they began to string their
bows. Two of them had already fitted arrows, when the officer judged it
necessary to fire in his own defence. Six muskets were discharged, and the
Indians fell flat into the bottom of the canoe, all except the man on the shed.
The seventh musket was fired at him. and he fell also. During this time, the
canoe dropped astern, and the three others having joined her, they all gave
chase to the cutter, trying to cut her off from the ship; in which they would
probably have succeeded had not the pinnace arrived at that juncture to their
assistance. The Indians then hoisted their sails and steered for Darnley's
Island.<br>
<br>
"No boats could have been manoeuvred better in working to windward than were
these long canoes by the naked savages. Had the four been able to reach the
cutter, it is difficult to say whether the superiority of our arms would have
been equal to the great difference of numbers, considering the ferocity of
these people and the skill with which they seemed to manage their weapons.<br>
<br>
"6th September. Two boats were sent ahead and the vessels followed them,
between Canoe Key and the reef lying from it half a mile to the north. After
running 12 miles beyond this narrow pass, they anchored in 13 fathoms, the
latitude being 9&deg; 37' and longitude 143&deg; 41' [east of Tobin
Cay.&mdash;R. L. J.]. In the afternoon, they proceeded 5 miles further to the
NNW., and Darnley's Island then bore S. 74-75 E., 2 leagues. Except on the
north side, this island appears to be surrounded with reefs and sandbanks to a
considerable distance. In sailing for [from.&mdash;R. L. J.] Canoe Key, the
vessels had left on the larboard hand a long chain of reefs and banks, at the
north end of which were three low woody islands, the nearest of these, bearing
S. 41&deg; W., 2 or 3 miles from the anchorage, was named NEPEAN ISLAND...<br>
<br>
"This day, several canoes from DARNLEY ISLAND came off to both vessels. On
approaching, the Indians clapped upon their heads and exclaimed 'Whou! whou!
whou!' repeatedly, with much vehemence; at the same time they held out
arrows</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 114}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">and other weapons, and asked for 'toree, toree,' by
which they meant iron...Their arms were bows, arrows and clubs, which they
bartered for every kind of ironwork with eagerness, but appeared to set little
value on anything else...<br>
<br>
"Their canoes are about 50 feet in length, and appear to have been hollowed out
of a single tree...These vessels are low forward, but rise abaft, and being
narrow are fitted with an outrigger on each side to keep them steady. A raft,
of greater breadth than the canoe, extends over about half the length, and upon
this is fixed a shed or hut, thatched with palm leaves. These people, in short,
appeared to be dextrous sailors and formidable warriours, and to be as much at
ease in the water as in their canoes.<br>
<br>
"7th September. The boats having found deep water round the north end of the
three low islands, the vessels followed them, but anchored again soon after
noon, in lat. 9&deg; 31' and long. 143&deg; 31', being sheltered by the two
western ISLANDS, named STEPHENS' and CAMPBELL'S, and the reefs which surround
them...<br>
<br>
"8th September. The vessels steered westward...No land or other obstruction had
been seen in that quarter, but at 10 o'clock they were forced to haul the wind
to the southward, their course being impeded by reefs, upon one of which was
PEARCE'S SANDY KEY. At noon they had anchored in 15 fathoms under the lee of

then visible in the S. by W...The latitude here was 9&deg; 37' and longitude
143&deg; 31'-143&deg; 15'E. In the afternoon, NATIVES came out from the beach
and exchanged ornaments and plums for iron. A moderate-sized dog, of a brown
chestnut colour, was observed amongst the party."<br>
<br>
"9th September. The ships still followed the boats, "between the cluster of
islands to the southward and an extensive reef to the west. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b>...At noon, the lat. was 9&deg; 48', long. 143&deg; 6',
and two other islands came in sight to the westward. Before 2 o'clock, an
extensive reef, partly dry, to which the name of Dungeness was given, made it
necessary to heave to until the boats had time to sound; after which Captain
Bligh bore away along the north side of the reef, and anchored a mile from
it...In this situation DUNGENESS ISLAND, which is low and woody, bore N.
64-87&deg; W., 3 miles, and a small sandy isle, named WARRIOUR'S ISLAND, N.
6-1&deg; W., 4 miles...Besides these, there were other low isles, called the
Six SISTERS, in sight to the SE., and a long fiat island, bearing S. 33-46&deg;
W., over the dry Dungeness Reef. In the west also there were islands visible,
at a greater distance, and much higher, than the others. The strait, instead of
becoming clearer, seemed to be more and more embarrassed with dangers as the
vessels proceeded westward. The latitude of this anchorage was 9&deg;
50&frac12;' S. and longitude 142&deg; 55' E.<br>
<br>
"l0th September. The boats sounded the channel [BASILISK PASS, so named in 1871
by Captain Moresby, of the "<i>Basilisk</i>."&mdash;R. L. J.] to the north-west
between Dungeness and Warriour's Islands, and finding sufficient water the
vessels got under way at noon to follow them. There were many NATIVES collected
upon the shore of Dungeness Island, and several canoes from Warriour's Island
were about the brig. Presently Captain Portlock made the signal for assistance,
and there was a discharge of musketry and some guns from his vessel and from
the boats. Canoes were also coming towards the "<i>Providence</i>" and when a
musket was fired at the headmost, the natives set up a great shout and paddled
forward in a body; nor was musketry sufficient to make them desist. The second
great gun, loaded with grape, was directed at the foremost of eight canoes,
full of men, and the round shot, after raking the whole length, struck the high
stern. The Indians leaped out and swam towards their companions, plunging
constantly to avoid the musket-balls which showered thickly about them. The
squadron then made off as fast as the people could paddle, but afterwards
rallied at a greater distance, until a shot which passed over their heads made
them disperse and give up all idea of any further attack.<br>
<br>
"In passing the deserted canoe, one native was observed still sitting in it.
The other canoes afterwards returned to him, and, with glasses, signals were
perceived</blockquote>

the arrows penetrated into the deck and sides of the brig was reported to be
truly astonishing.<br>

"The vessels passed between Dungeness and Warriour's Islands [BASILISK

forming the sole visible obstructions.<br>

the eye could range without being obstructed was that whence the vessels had
come; everywhere else the view was arrested by rocks, banks and islands. The
most extensive of these was BANKS ISLAND, extending from S. 14&deg; E. to

Second-Lieutenant was sent for the purpose of taking possession of all the
islands seen in the strait for His Britannic Majesty George III, with the

"Whilst the boats were sounding, several INDIANS, in three canoes, were
perceived making towards them, but on a swivel-shot being fired over their

<br>
"On the signal being made for good anchorage further on, the '<i>Assistant</i>'
led to the W. by S.; but on reaching the boats, the bottom was found much
inferior to what had been imagined. The approach of night, however, obliged
Bligh to anchor soon afterwards...<br>
<br>
"In this situation, the vessels were so closely surrounded with rocks and reefs
as scarcely to have swinging-room. The bottom was rocky. The wind blowing a
fresh gale, and a tide running between 4 and 5 knots an hour. This anxious
night was, however, passed without accident, and next morning.<br>

reefs and rocks which, in some places, were not three-quarters of a mile

Captain Bligh and his associate in their <i>route</i> to the ISLAND
TIMOR."</blockquote>
<p>After his voyage in the "<i>Bounty</i>," Bligh was promoted to Commander and
afterwards to Post Captain. In 1794, he was Captain of the 74-gun
"<i>Warrior</i>" off Ushant. In 1797, he commanded the 64-gun "<i>Director</i>"
at Camper down and distinguished himself on the occasion of the mutiny at the
Nore. On 21st May, 1801, he commanded the 64-gun "<i>Glatton</i>" at
Copenhagen, and was personally thanked by Nelson.</p>
<p>During the administration of John Hunter and Philip Gidley King as Governors
of New South Wales, the colony had got somewhat out of hand, chiefly on account
of the "rum"-currency, the usurpation of authority by the New South Wales Corps
and questions arising out of the status of freed convicts. To the Government in
England, it appeared that the only remedy lay in the appointment of a strict
disciplinarian, and his whole career indicated that Bligh was such a man. He
took up the reins in 1806.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Bligh's insistence on discipline," says Professor
Scott, <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> "was indeed sufficiently stiff, but
unfortunately he was also a quarrelsome, ill-tempered, coarse-speaking man. His
manner of doing business with those who had to see him was repellent. He would,
with no regard for the dignity of his position, pour forth a stream of personal
abuse, loaded with dire threats; and if he felt angry with anyone he would
blurt out his displeasure, no matter where he was&mdash;on the parade ground,

<blockquote class="inline">in his tantrums wrote that he would not brook
contradiction or protest; 'his features became distorted, he foamed at the
mouth, stamped on the ground, and shook his fist at the person so presuming.'
He was a law unto himself, and he said so. It can hardly be contended that
Bligh's acts were more arbitrary than those of his predecessors, and he had the
same refractory material to deal with; but his manner soon made him hated by
those who came into personal contact with him, and at length brought about the
mutiny by which he was deposed from office."</blockquote>
<p>He was deposed and put under arrest on 26th January, 1808, by the New South
Wales Corps, whose officers administered the colony until the arrival of
Governor Macquarie in December, 1809. After his return to England, Bligh was
promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral in 1811, and to that of Vice-Admiral in
1814, but he was never again entrusted with official responsibility. He died on
7th December, 1817.</p>
<p>A foreign, and therefore presumably unbiassed, estimate of Bligh's
character, that of the Surgeon-Major of the French warship "<i>La
Z&egrave;el&eacute;e</i>" [1] may be given here.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"He was a sea-wolf, a rude, brutal, intrepid,
indefatigable man. He never slept, and could not bear that any of his crew
should sleep. He was a poor eater, and he desired that his crew should diet
themselves on his scale. All his words were words of wrath. All his orders were
threats. All his threats were of the lash. The day comes when his crew revolt
and Jay hold of the shark that has no pity. 'Cease your cries!' say the
mutinous sailors. 'We don't want to kill you, but we will not obey you. We will
put the launch in the water, and you in it, with four sailors, all good
swimmers. Then you can beat the waves with those hands that are always so ready
to strike. Farewell, Bligh, and a good voyage. Here is the compass. Search for
and find..."</blockquote>
<p>Such was the imaginary scene conjured up by the dramatic imagination of the
Surgeon while his ship lay fast on a sandbank in the "Canal Mauvais," near
Warrior Island and within a few miles of Bligh's track, and when it seemed more
than likely that the crews of the "<i>Astrolabe</i>" and
"<i>Z&egrave;el&eacute;e</i>" might have to make for Timor in open boats, as
Bligh had done forty-eight years before.</p>

<p>"The last passage known to have been made through Torres Strait previously
to the sailing of the 'Investigator,'" says Flinders (<i>Terra Australis</i>,
I, xix) "was by Messieurs WILLIAM BAMPTON and MATTHEW ALT, Commanders of the
ships '<i>Hormuzeer</i>' and 'Chesterfield.' Their discoveries were made public
in two charts by Mr. Dalrymple in 1798 and 1799, and from them, and Captain
Bampton's manuscript journal, the south coast of New Guinea and most of the
reefs and islands near it are laid down in Plate XIII, after having been
adjusted to the observations of Captain Bligh and those subsequently made by me
in the '<i>Investigator</i>' and '<i>Cumberland</i>.' Flinders then gives an
abridgement of BAMPTON'S JOURNAL, which I further condense.</p>
<p>The "<i>Hormuzeer</i>" and "<i>Chesterfield</i>" sailed from NORFOLK ISLAND
with the intention of passing through TORRES STRAIT by a <i>route</i> which the
Commanders did not know to have been before attempted. (SEE MAP A.)</p>
<p>Late on 20th June, 1793, MURRAY ISLANDS were seen, bearing NW.&frac12;W. The
following day the course was changed to the north. At the point where the
change was made, the latitude was 10&deg; 20'S. and the longitude 144&deg;
50'E., according to Flinders. It is doubtful whether it was the intention of
the Commanders to attempt a</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 119}</u></p>
<p>passage <i>via</i> Murray Island; but if so, the Boot and Portlock Reefs no
doubt forced them to alter their plans. At noon on the 22nd, they were in
8&deg; 48' S., and land (NEW GUINEA) was seen an hour later. An attempt was
made to follow the New Guinea coast and to get away to the north between New
Guinea and the Louisiade Archipelago.</p>
<p>No such passage, however, having been found, and following the coast of the
Gulf of Papua having carried the ships too far east, it was determined once
more to seek a passage through TORRES STRAIT. From 7&deg; 55' S., <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> therefore, the ships turned southward on 26th June. At
dawn on 1st July., Bligh's DARNLEY ISLAND was in sight, bearing W. by
N.&frac12;N., at an estimated distance of 5 leagues. Next day, the boats were
employed in sounding, and NATIVES from Darnley Island (to which the ships were
near enough for coco-nut trees to be seen) approached in canoes and exchanged
bows and arrows for knives, etc.</p>
<p>The following quotations are from <i>Terra Australis</i> (I, xxxiii <i>et
seq</i>.}.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"3rd July. Mr. Shaw, Chief Mate of the
"<i>Chesterfield</i>," Mr. Carter, and Captain Hill, of the New South Wales
Corps, who was a passenger, went away armed, with five seamen, in a whaleboat,
and were expected to return on the following day; but the 4th, 5th and 6th
passed, without any tidings of them...<br>
<br>
"7th July.&mdash;Two boats, manned and armed, under the command of Mr. Dell,
Chief Mate of the '<i>Hormuzeer</i>,' were sent in search of the whaleboat. On
reaching the island, Mr. Dell heard conch-shells sounding in various parts, and
saw eighty or ninety armed NATIVES upon the shore. To the inquiries, by signs,
after the missing boat, they answered that she was gone to the westward; but
none of them would venture near; nor did they pay attention to a white
handkerchief, which was held up, and had before been considered a signal of
peace.<br>
<br>
"As the boats proceeded on their search round the island, the natives followed
along the shore, with increasing numbers. One man, who was rubbed with
something blue, and appeared to be a chief, had a small axe in his hand, which
was known, from the red helve, to have belonged to Mr. Shaw. On reaching the
bay in the north-west side of the island, Mr. Dell remarked that the natives
disappeared, all except about thirty, who were very anxious in persuading him
to land. They brought down women, and made signs that the boat and people whom
he sought were a little way up in the island. He, however, rowed onward, when
the beach was immediately crowded with people who had been lying in ambush
expecting him to land.<br>
<br>
"After having gone entirely round the island and seen nothing of the objects of
his research, Mr. Dell returned to the first cove, where a great number of
natives armed with bows, arrows, clubs and lances, were assembled at the
outskirt of the wood. By offering knives and other things, a few were induced
to approach the boat, and the coxswain seized one of them by the hair and neck,
with the intention of his being taken off to the ships to give an account of
the missing boat and people. A shower of arrows instantly came out of the wood,
and a firing was commenced, which killed one Indian and wounded some others. In
the meantime, the coxswain found it impossible to keep the man, from his hair
and body being greased, and the boat's crew was too much occupied to assist
him.

but without having seen any of the inhabitants.<br>

"10th July. An armed party of 44 men landed from the ships, under the command
of Mr. Dell. After hoisting the Union Jack and TAKING POSSESSION of this and
the neighbouring islands and coast of New Guinea in the name of His Majesty,
they examined the huts, and found the greatcoats of Captain Hill, Mr. Carter
and Mr. Shaw, with several other things which had belonged to them and to the
boat's crew, so that no doubt was entertained of their having been MURDERED. In
the evening, the party arrived from making the tour of the island, having burnt
and destroyed 135 huts, 16 canoes measuring from 50 to 70 feet in length, and
various plantations of sugar-cane. The natives appeared to have retired to the
hills in the centre of the island, as not one of them could be discovered...The
plantations of the natives, which were extensive and numerous in the plains,
contained yams, sweet potatoes, plantains and sugar-canes, included within neat
fences of bamboo, and coco-nut trees were very abundant, particularly near the
habitations.<br>
<br>
"The habitations of the Indians were generally placed at the heads of the small
coves, and formed into villages of ten or twelve huts each...In each of the
huts...were suspended two or three human skulls, and several strings of hands,
five or six on a string. These were hung round a wooden image, rudely carved
into the representation of a man or of some bird...In one hut, containing much
the greater number of skulls, a kind of gum was found burning before one of
these images...<br>
<br>
"The corpse of a man who had been shot we found disposed of in the following
manner. Six stakes were driven into the ground about three feet from each other
and six feet high. A platform of twigs was worked upon them at the height of
about five feet, and upon this the body was laid, without covering; but the
putrid state of the corpse did not allow of a close inspection.<br>
<br>
"11th July.&mdash;The '<i>Hormuzeer</i>' stood north. In the afternoon both
ships anchored off STEPHENS' ISLAND. An armed party was immediately sent ashore
to obtain intelligence, if possible, of the lost whaleboat. The NATIVES were
assembled in hostile array upon the hills, sounding their conches, but after
lancing a few arrows they fled. Several were wounded by the shots fired in
return, but they succeeded in escaping to a canoe at the back of the island and
getting off, all except one boy, who was taken unhurt. In the huts which were
burnt, several things were found, and amongst them a sheet of copper which
belonged to the 'Chesterfield.'<br>
<br>
"12th July.&mdash;Stephens' Island was traversed all over, and a spike nail,
with the King's broad arrow upon it, was brought on board. [<i>Note by
Flinders</i>: 'It had probably been obtained from the crews of either the
"<i>Providence</i>" or "<i>Assistant</i>," which had been anchored under
Stephens' Island nine months before.']<br>
<br>
"13th July.&mdash;A boat was sent to CAMPBELL'S ISLAND, but it did not contain
either plantations, coco-nut trees or fixed habitations...<br>

"In the afternoon, the ships proceeded to the westward, but, meeting with many
reefs, they hauled more to the north, and discovered BRISTOW ISLAND, lying
close to the coast of New Guinea. Their attempts to find a passage here were
fruitless, and, after incurring much danger, the '<i>Chesterfield</i>' getting
aground, they returned to their former anchorage in the evening of<br>

<p>No attempt to estimate the value of the contribution made by Matthew
Flinders to the geography of Torres Strait and the Cape York Peninsula would be

<p>is to leave out enough to reduce it to reasonable proportions. In this
difficult matter of condensation, I gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to
Professor Scott. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>Flinders was the son of a physician in Donington, Lincolnshire, where he was
born on 16th March, 1774. From his earliest youth, he developed an invincible
inclination towards maritime pursuits. The patron so necessary in these days
was opportunely found for him in Captain (afterwards Admiral) Sir Thomas
Pasley, through whose influence he entered the Royal Navy in 1789, and was
rated as "Lieutenant's Servant" on the "<i>Belleroophon</i>" on 31st July,
1790. In 1791, he joined the "<i>Providence</i>" under Captain William Bligh,
on his second voyage for the transport of the breadfruit tree to the West
Indies. This mission was successfully accomplished, the plants being delivered
at their destination near the end of 1793. By this time, Britain was at war
with France. The only existing account of the voyage of the "<i>Providence</i>"
and her tender, the "<i>Assistant</i>" is that given by Flinders in the
introductory chapter of his great work.</p>
<p>On his arrival in England, Flinders (then nineteen years of age), eagerly
embraced the opportunity of rejoining the "<i>Bellerophon</i>" and Admiral
Pasley, who had received a good report on his conduct from Captain Bligh, made
him his <i>aide de camp</i>. In the great battle off Brest, Pasley's active
career was ended by the loss of a leg. Afterwards, although he received
promotion and honours, he was only fit for administrative duties, and therefore
Flinders left the "<i>Bellerophon</i>" after exactly five days' experience of
naval warfare (28th May to 1st June, 1794).</p>
<p>In 1788, the British colony of NEW SOUTH WALES was inaugurated by CAPTAIN
PHILLIPS, who sailed from England in the "<i>Sirius</i>" commanded by CAPTAIN
JOHN HUNTER (who succeeded him in the governorship in 1794). In March, 1794,
the "<i>Reliance</i>" and "<i>Supply</i>" were commissioned to convey Hunter to
Sydney, and Flinders was a midshipman on the first-named vessel. Sydney was
reached on 7th September, 1795.</p>
<p>On the voyage out, a close friendship had sprung up between Flinders and
GEORGE BASS, the Surgeon of the "<i>Reliance</i>" The two friends had no sooner
landed than they concerted measures for the exploration of the coast of New
South Wales. Having secured the best boat available, the "<i>Tom Thumb</i>,"
eight feet in length, they, and a boy, visited Botany Bay and the St. Georges
River before the end of 1795. In a second boat of the same name, they left
Sydney on 25th March, 1796, and explored the coast of the Illawarra district to
the south and Port Hacking to the north, returning to Sydney on 2nd April.</p>
<p>A British protectorate of the Cape of Good Hope had by this</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>The Life of Captain Matthew Flinders, R.N.</i> By Ernest
Scott, Professor of History in the University of Melbourne. Sydney,
1914.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 125}</u></p>
<p>time been proclaimed, and the "Reliance" under Captain Waterhouse, with the
"<i>Supply</i>," under Captain William Kent, made a voyage to the Cape and
brought back cattle to stock the colony of New South Wales. The ships returned
to Sydney on 26th June and 16th May, 1797, respectively. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> Flinders was one of the officers of the
"<i>Reliance</i>."</p>
<p>While Flinders was either confined to the neighbourhood of Sydney during the
overhaul of the "<i>Reliance</i>" and "<i>Supply</i>" or engaged in their
voyage to the Cape, BASS started on the memorable voyage which led to the
discovery of BASS STRAIT. He set out from Sydney on 3rd December, 1797, in a
WHALEBOAT with six men. A month later, they found white men near Wilson's
Promontory. These proved to be escaped convicts, marooned by the treachery of
some of their companions, who made away with the only boat. On 5th January,
1798, Bass discovered WESTERN PORT, only a few miles short of Port Phillip, and
remained there for a fortnight. The port is now a naval base for the
Commonwealth fleet. Bass firmly (and correctly) believed that he had discovered
a strait separating Tasmania from Australia; but official admission or
recognition of the fact was delayed until the strait had actually been sailed
through.</p>
<p>Flinders had passed as lieutenant while at the Cape in 1797. On his return
to Sydney, it was reported that the "<i>Sydney Cove</i>" had been wrecked at
the Furneaux Islands (north-east of Tasmania), and the schooner
"<i>Francis</i>" and sloop "<i>Eliza</i>" were dispatched from Sydney for the
scene of the wreck on 1st February, 1798. Governor Hunter permitted Flinders to
embark on the "<i>Francis</i>," "to make such observations serviceable to
geography and navigation as circumstances might afford." Unfortunately, the
"<i>Eliza</i>" got separated from the "<i>Francis</i>" and was lost with all
hands. The "<i>Francis</i>" returned to Sydney on 9th March. The net
geographical result of the voyage was the addition to the map of the Kent group
of islands, west of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Bass had returned to Sydney from his whaleboat voyage along 600 miles of the
coast of New South Wales on 25th February. He and Flinders were eager to
"pursue inquiry to the point of proof "regarding the separation of Tasmania
from New South Wales, and Flinders desired to circumnavigate Tasmania. Before
this object could be attained, however, Flinders, as an officer of the
"<i>Reliance</i>" had to make a trip (May to July, 1798) to Norfolk Island. On
7th October, the Governor having put him in command of the sloop
"<i>Norfolk</i>" he sailed with a crew of eight men, accompanied by Bass. They
CIRCUMNAVIGATED TASMANIA and returned to Sydney on 12th January, 1799.</p>
<p>On 8th July, 1799, Flinders sailed for the north in the "<i>Norfolk</i>." He
visited Moreton Bay, where he spent fifteen days, and Hervey</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Terra Australis</i>, I, civ.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 126}</u></p>
<p>Bay, returning to Sydney on 20th August. He came to the conclusion that
there were no important rivers on this stretch of the coast, having missed the
Hunter, Clarence, Richmond and Brisbane.</p>
<p>Flinders sailed for England on 3rd March, 1800, in the "<i>Reliance</i>"
under command of Captain Waterhouse, and arrived at Portsmouth on 26th August.
He pressed the Admiralty for employment in the further exploration and survey
of Australia, and through the influence of SIR JOSEPH BANKS was given the
"<i>Investigator</i>" a sloop of 334 tons, built as a merchantman and
originally known as the "<i>Xenophon</i>" He was promoted to the rank of
commander, and took possession of his ship on 25th January, 1801. The Admiralty
was most liberal in "finding" the vessel, giving Banks carte blanche to furnish
it according to his own and Flinders' ideas, and the assistants were well
remunerated, according to the value of money at the time, as witness the sums
placed against some of their names. Evidently, the expedition was a popular
one. Under Flinders, the following were the officers:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
1st Lieutenant, Robert Fowler.
2nd Lieutenant, Ward Flinders.
Midshipmen, 6, one of whom was John Franklin.
Botanist, Robert Brown (&pound;420 per annum).
Landscape and Figure Draftsman, William Westall (&pound;315).
Botanical Draftsman, Ferdinand Bauer (&pound;315).
Gardener, Peter Good (&pound;105).
Miner, John Allen (&pound;105).
Astronomer, John Crossley (&pound;420). His health broke down, and
   he returned to England from the Cape of Good Hope, when Matthew
   Flinders and his brother, Ward, took over his duties.
</pre>
<p>The East India Company donated &pound;600 for table-money for the officers
and staff.</p>
<p>Britain was at war with France at this time, but in view of the purely
scientific aims of the expedition Flinders was provided with a passport signed
by the French Minister of Marine on behalf of the First Consul.</p>
<p>With this improvement in his position and prospects, Flinders MARRIED, on
17th April, 1801, Miss Ann Chappell, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> whom he
proposed to take with him, in spite of a regulation to the contrary. The
regulation had, indeed, been frequently disregarded, but unfortunately for
Flinders recent instances of flagrant abuses on the part of highly placed
officers had just then forced the Admiralty to insist on implicit obedience.
Even Sir Joseph Banks looked coldly upon what seemed like an attempt to smuggle
a wife on board. In the end, Flinders had to yield and leave his bride behind.
The separation was destined to last more than nine years, and the married
lovers had less than four years of life together.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Scott, <i>Life of Flinders</i>, p. 164.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 127}</u></p>
<p>Flinders sailed from Spithead on 18th July, 1801, and it is recorded that he
raised discipline, sanitation and food supply to a pitch never before attained,
even improving on the methods of Cook. The Australian coast, near CAPE LEEUWIN,
was sighted on 6th December, 1801.</p>
<p>From the Leeuwin to Fowler's Bay, the coast was already known.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"In 1791, Captain GEORGE VANCOUVER, in the '<i>Cape
Chatham</i>' sailed along it from Cape Leeuwin to King Georges Sound, which he
discovered and named...In 1792, BRUNY D'ENTRECASTEAUX, with the French ships
'<i>Recherche</i>' and '<i>Esperance</i>,' searching for tidings of the lost
'Lap&eacute;rouse' followed the line of the shore more closely than Vancouver
had done, and penetrated much further eastward, to 131&deg; 38&frac12;', east
of the present border-line of Western and South Australia. These navigators,
with the Dutchman PIETER NUYTS, in the early part of the seventeenth century,
and the Frenchman ST. ALOUARA, who anchored near the <i>Leeuwin</i> in 1792,
were the only Europeans known to have been upon any part of these southern
coasts before the advent of Flinders; and the extent of the voyage of Nuyts is
by no means clear." <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<p>Fowler's Bay was named and surveyed by Flinders, who now commenced to devote
careful study to this part of the coast, seeing that it was new to geography.
As an evidence of the minuteness of the survey, Scott compares the 240 names
bestowed by Flinders on the South Australian and Tasmanian coasts with the 103
noted by Cook along the whole of the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>Cape Catastrophe was rounded on 20th February, 1802, and the northward trend
of the land east of the Cape revived for a time the old idea of the connection
of the Bight with the Gulf of Carpentaria. The ominous name of the cape was
conferred because on the 21st a boat, with the master of the
"<i>Investigator,</i>" John Thistle, a midshipman and six sailors, was upset
while returning from the shore to the ship, and the whole party was lost.</p>
<p>Spencer's Gulf was explored and charted between 6th and 20th March, 1802,
and Kangaroo Island was also discovered. St. Vincent's Gulf was entered on 27th
March, and the survey was finished on 1st April. Forty years later, the
foundations of the city of ADELAIDE were laid at the foot of the Mount Lofty
Range, on country which Flinders had described as "well clothed with forest
timber" and "having a fertile appearance."</p>
<p>Kangaroo Island was left behind on 6th April. About half a degree to the
east, on the 8th, Flinders met BAUDIN, in the "<i>G&eacute;ographe</i>" in
Encounter Bay. It appeared that the "<i>G&eacute;ographe</i>" had sailed
through BASS STRAIT and had been between Wilson's Promontory and Cape Otway
from the 28th to the 31st of March, thus narrowly missing the discovery of Port
Phillip.</p>
<p>Captain Nicolas Baudin, on the "<i>G&eacute;ographe</i>" left Havre on</p>
<blockquote>[1) Scott, Life of Flinders, p. 206.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 128}</u></p>
<p>19th October, 1800, accompanied by Captain Hamelin, in the
"<i>Naturaliste</i>" on a geographical and scientific expedition, and had
passports not only from the Government of the First Consul of France but also
from the British Government, although the two countries were at war. Early in
the voyage, scurvy made dreadful havoc in both ships. The expedition reached
(<i>via</i> Timor), in January, 1802, the southern shores of Tasmania, in which
island there was then no European settlement, and sojourned there till March.
On 7th-8th March, the vessels were separated by a storm near the east end of
Bass Strait. The "<i>Naturaliste</i> "spent some time in Western Port, which
had already been discovered by Bass. Finally, Captain Hamelin took her to
Sydney, with the object of soliciting aid from the Colonial Governor. In the
meantime, Baudin had taken the "<i>G&eacute;ographe</i>" westward through Bass
Strait, and he was fortunate enough to meet the "<i>Investigator</i>" in
Encounter Bay. Flinders advised and invited him to make for Sydney to refit and
victual his ship. Baudin went on to King Island, where he turned back, and
arrived at Sydney on 20th June, 1802.</p>
<p>Baudin had explored the coast from Cape Banks to Encounter Bay. From Cape
Banks to Port Phillip, the discoverer was Captain Grant, of the "<i>Lady
Nelson</i>" who sailed from the Cape of Good Hope eastward through Bass Strait
(3rd-16th December, 1800).</p>
<p>From Cape Otway, Flinders went to King Island, the southern part of which
had been discovered in 1799 by Captain John Reid, a sealer, and the northern
part by Captain John Black, of the "<i>Harbinger</i>" Leaving King Island on
24th January, 1802, Flinders sighted Grant's Cape Schanck on the 26th. Thence,
bearing west, to trace the land at the head of the Great Bight, he entered PORT
PHILLIP, which at first he took for Bass' Western Port. It did not take him
long to satisfy himself that this was a mistake, and his natural conclusion was
that in Port Phillip he had himself discovered a bay of no less importance than
Western Port; but the discovery of Port Phillip had been anticipated by
Lieutenant John Murray, who succeeded Captain Grant in the command of the
"<i>Lady Nelson</i>" Flinders surveyed the bay, and ascended Arthur Seat, where
he found himself with Port Phillip on the west and Western Port on the
east.</p>
<p>On 9th May, 1802, Flinders entered Port Jackson, with something to be
proud&mdash;of a clean bill of health&mdash;and reported himself to Governor
King. In the harbour lay the "<i>Naturaliste</i>" (which had arrived on 24th
April), and Flinders was able to inform Hamelin that his lost consort would
make for Sydney also. As a matter of fact, Baudin brought the
"<i>G&eacute;ographe</i>" into the port on 20th June, with every man on board
sick.</p>
<p>The signing of a treaty of peace (which, unfortunately, proved</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 129}</u></p>
<p>very temporary) between Britain and France had become known in Sydney a few
days before the arrival of the "<i>G&eacute;ographe</i>." There was, therefore,
nothing to prevent the utmost kindness being extended to the distressed
explorer; but it is pleasing to relate that, even while a state of war was
supposed to prevail, the "<i>Naturaliste</i>" had been equally well
treated.</p>

<p>The "<i>Investigator</i>" having been repaired and refitted in Sydney
Harbour and a new master (John Aken) having been appointed, it was decided, on
consultation with Governor King, that she should proceed to explore TORRES
STRAIT and the eastern side of the GULF OF CARPENTARIA, accompanied by the
"<i>Lady Nelson</i>" (Captain Murray).</p>
<p>Flinders accordingly left Sydney on list July, 1802, with the
"<i>Investigator</i>" and "<i>Lady Nelson</i>." The latter&mdash;a 60-ton
brig&mdash;</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 131}</u></p>
<p>proved herself from the first to be an unsuitable ship, and merely a drag on
the larger vessel, and was sent back on 18th October. In following the coast to
the north, Flinders named (7th August) PORT CURTIS, now the port of GLADSTONE,
and (28th September) the PERCY ISLANDS. (ADMIRALTY CHART, No. 2759A.) On 20th
October, he got outside of the Barrier Reef (18&deg; 45' S.; 148&deg; 10' E.)
by the passage which now bears his own name. Nine days later, he came inside of
the reef by a passage in 9&deg; 50' S. and 144&deg; 45' E., between Portlock
and Boot Reefs, which he identified as the one used by Captain Edwards of the
"<i>Pandora</i>" in 1791, and therefore named PANDORA ENTRANCE. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> (SEE MAP A.) The same night (29th October, 1802), he
was at anchor north of the largest of the MURRAY ISLANDS. He remarks, <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> "I did not forget that the inhabitants of these islands
had made an attack on the '<i>Providence</i>' and 'Assistant,' <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> nor that Mr. Bampton had some people cut off at Darnley
Island in 1793 (pp. xxxiv-xxxix). The marines were therefore kept under
arms...Bows and arrows were contained in all the canoes, but no intimation of
hostility was manifested by the Indians." He bartered iron articles, including
hatchets, for plantains, bows and arrows, etc., with forty or fifty
islanders.</p>
<p>From Murray Island, Flinders picked his way cautiously among the reefs and
low islets southward and westward towards Cape York. Late in the afternoon of
30th October, he anchored at the south end of the reef surrounding what he
called HALFWAY ISLAND. This island is described as being barely a mile in
circumference, only a few feet above the reach of spring tides, and covered
with casuarina and other trees. Indications of the recent presence of "Indians"
were observed.</p>
<p>On 31st October, good progress was maintained to the southwest. At noon, the
position was 10&deg; 26" 45" S. and 142&deg; 39&frac12;' E., and from this
position high land was seen bearing SSE. and at an estimated distance of 10 or
12 miles&mdash;almost certainly the MOUNT ADOLPHUS ISLANDS, the larger of which
rises to 548 feet. By 2 p.m., the ship passed on the north side of DOUBLE
ISLAND and the course was altered to SW. by S., in which direction lay some
rocky islets. These, however, when reached, afforded no shelter, and the ship
wore round to the west until an anchorage was found on the north side of
WEDNESDAY ISLAND (10&deg; 30' S.; 142&deg; 18&frac12;' E.), which had been
named by Bligh.</p>
<p>On 1st November, the weather was too rough for landing or</p>

<p>sailing. Some fires were seen on HAMMOND ISLAND, but Wednesday Island showed
no sign of habitation except for gigantic ant-hills which were at first taken
for huts. On the following morning (2nd November), the course was shaped
westward and west-southwestward, with Wednesday and Hammond Islands to the
south and the NORTH-WEST REEF on the north. This passage is now officially
known as PRINCE OF WALES CHANNEL. (In modern charts the passage between
Wednesday and Horn Islands, named FLINDERS PASSAGE, is that used by Flinders in
his later voyage [1803] in the "<i>Cumberland</i>.")</p>
<p>HAMMOND ISLAND was so named by Captain Edwards on his voyage in the boat of
the wrecked "<i>Pandora</i>."</p>
<p>South-west of Hammond Island, Flinders distinguished another, which he named
GOOD ISLAND, after the gardener of the expedition, and the anchor was dropped
near its west end in the afternoon. Flinders landed with the botanists and took
bearings, and remarked that "the stone is granite...and...porphyry, and in one
place I found streaks of verdegrease, as if the cliffs above had contained
copper ore." This is the earliest recorded indication of "MINERAL WEALTH" in
Queensland territory. The adjacent Hammond Island, nearly a century later, was
found to contain auriferous quartz associated with copper pyrites, and there
can be no doubt that Flinders' observation on Good Island was correct and his
deduction justifiable.</p>
<p>From Good Island, BOOBY ISLAND was visible, and the "<i>Investigator</i>"
was therefore in the open sea west of Torres Strait.</p>
<p>The voyage was resumed on 3rd November, with the immediate object of
"getting in with the mainland south of the Prince of Wales Island." The course
taken was mainly to the south-west between the LARPENT and GERARD BANKS, and
must have been a very hazardous one, from the shallow soundings shown on modern
charts. Once clear of the shoals, the vessel's head was turned to the south,
and at noon she was west of the WALLIS ISLANDS and between the RED and WALLIS
BANKS. Flinders wrote: <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> "Between Cape Cornwall
[southern point of Prince of Wales Island] and the low mainland...is the
opening called in the old Dutch chart SPEULT'S RIVER, but which Captain Cook,
who sailed through it, named Endeavour Strait."</p>
<p>Some of the charts prior to Tasman's conveyed the idea that the Van Speult
Revier was identical with the passage afterwards named Endeavour Strait, but
Carstenszoon's diary (13th May, 1623) clearly points out that it was the (or a)
mouth of a fresh-water river draining the land, and as such it was identified
by Asschens in the "<i>Buijs</i>" in 1756.</p>
<p>After clearing the WALLIS ISLANDS, further progress to the south was barred
by the INSKIP BANKS, and the "<i>Investigator</i>"</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Terra Australis</i>, II, p. 122.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 133}</u></p>
<p>was forced to the west until the mainland was lost sight of. It was late in
the day when the southerly course could be resumed, and at dusk the anchor was
dropped in 11&deg; 5' S. and 141&deg; 51' E.</p>
<p>From early morning till 3 p.m. next day (4th November), the wind was
unfavourable for an approach to the land, and the ship still headed to the
south, the midday latitude being 11&deg; 24&frac12;' S. and longitude 141&deg;
46&frac12;' E. (SEE MAP B.) A change of wind at 3 p.m. enabled the course to be
laid ESE.: the low-lying mainland soon afterwards came into view, and the
anchor was dropped near the shore.</p>
<p>On 5th November, the ship had gone but a little way south when the wind
failed. At this point, NATIVES could be seen grouped around a fire.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"At 11, the sea breeze came in from W. by N., with
dark, cloudy weather, and we steered forward, passing a SMALL OPENING at one
o'clock [where the '<i>Duyfken's</i>' men landed in 1606, one of them being
killed by the natives; where Carstenszoon landed in 1623 from the '<i>Pera</i>'

SKARDON RIVER, the name having been given by Jardine in 1865 to what may
possibly have been one of its heads.&mdash;R. L. J.]. "This opening was 4 or 5
miles south of where the natives had been seen." A much LARGER OPENING came in
sight at 2, into which I hoped to get the ship; but the water was so shallow at
5 or 6 miles off that we were obliged to tack, and after making a second
ineffectual attempt it became dark, and we anchored in 6 fathoms, fine dark
mud, the centre of the opening bearing S. 37&deg; E., 3 leagues.<br>
<br>
"The coast was low, as before, but the trees upon it were taller. The largest
opening [PORT MUSGRAVE.&mdash;R. L. J.] is about two miles wide, leading in
SE., but turning afterwards more east and apparently contracting its width [the
mouth of the DALHUNTY RIVER, <i>de facto</i>, of modern maps, where it enters
the Port Musgrave estuary.&mdash;R. L. J.]. Near the south-west point of the
entrance [CULLEN POINT. R. L. J.], which projects a little from the general
line of the shore, was a clump of trees higher than usual, presenting the first
mark I had yet found for bearings. The latitude of this opening is 11&deg; 55',
and agrees nearly with that of the BATAVIA RIVER in the old Dutch chart in the
old Dutch chart [i.e. in Thevenot's chart.&mdash;R. L. J.]; but the shoal which
runs 6 miles out seemed to render it inaccessible to a ship." <b style=

south-western corner of the Port Musgrave Estuary. Tasman anchored in 1644 off
the mouth of Port Musgrave, and named it STAATEN REVIER, which is curious, as
there was already a Staten Revier on the map, more than 5 degrees further
south.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p>In the morning of 6th November, adverse weather conditions and the fear of
the north-west monsoons forbade any further investigation of this important

difficulty to get in on account of the shoals, the channel among them being
narrow and winding and not more than 9 to 12 feet deep. On the north side was a
party of NATIVES, and Bongaree went on shore to them, naked and unarmed; but,
although provided with spears, they retreated from him and all our endeavours
to bring about an interview were unsuccessful. It was not safe for the
gentlemen to botanise in presence of these suspicious people, and therefore we
rowed a mile higher up, to a green-looking point on the same side and landed
about noon. The depth thus far was 2 fathoms, and I could see 2&frac12; miles
further up the inlet to the ESE., where it turned more southward round a wooded
point, and, from the strength of the tide, probably extended some miles into
the country.<br>
<br>
"While the botanists were making their examination and I walked along the shore
to shoot some birds, several voices were heard in the wood, as of people
advancing towards us...We rowed back to the first place, where the country was
open, and the gentlemen botanised, whilst sentinels kept watch on the sandy
hillocks...<br>
<br>
"Before quitting the shore, a hatchet was made fast to the branch of a tree and
set up conspicuously near the water side. We had scarcely shoved off, when the
party of Indians, sixteen in number, made their appearance and called to us;
but when the boat's head was turned towards them they ran away. On the south
side of the entrance were four other natives, who also ran at our approach. We
therefore set up another hatchet for them, and returned back to the ship.<br>
<br>
"These people were all naked; and in colour, as in everything else, seemed to
have a perfect resemblance to the inhabitants of the east and south coasts of
Terra Australis. In Torres Strait, bows and arrows are the offensive weapons;
but here we saw spears only. Each man had several in his hand, and something
which was supposed to be a throwing stick.<br>
<br>
"This small opening appears to be the COEN RIVER of the Dutch chart. Its
latitude is 12&deg; 13' S..."</blockquote>
<p>Tasman was the first to chart this inlet (1644), and he named it PRINCE
REVIER. Flinders' suggested identification of it was a most unfortunate one,
and was destined to give rise to much confusion in later years. He could not
possibly have made the mistake had he been in possession of the diary of
Carstenszoon's voyage in the "<i>Pera</i>" which distinctly places his COEN
INLET, where he landed on 8th May, 1623, and kidnapped a native, in 13&deg; 7'
S., i.e., midway between the mouth of the Archer River and Pera Head, the
southern horn of Albatross Bay. The fact is, Flinders had to rely on
second-hand and generalised charts, such as Thevenot's, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> of which he gives a copy as an inset in his Chart Sheet
2, in the atlas issued with <i>Terra Australis</i>. When, in the process of
land exploration, it became necessary to give names to rivers which rose in the
ranges near the east coast of the Peninsula, but obviously flowed towards the
Gulf, the natural tendency was to connect the new rivers with the few inlets,
or reviers, which appeared on the map of the Gulf coast. Thus, when, in 1876, a
goldfield was discovered in 13&deg; 55' S. and 143&deg; 13' E., on a river
which flowed to the northwest, the discoverers believed themselves to be near
the head of the</p>

version of Tasman's chart published by Swart, nor with that published by
Heeres, it was probably taken from some contemporary chart to which neither
Swart nor Heeres had access.]</blockquote>

<p>Dutch Coen River, whose position was very erroneously laid down on the map,
on the authority of Flinders, in 12&deg; 13' S. It would be impossible now to
alter the name of the COEN GOLDFIELD, which has been sanctioned by half a
century of usage, but the Department of Lands has begun to call the "COEN
RIVER" of the goldfield the SOUTH COEN, in order to minimise the confusion.</p>
<p>About 1881, the inlet named by Tasman the PRINCE REVIER, and erroneously
identified by Flinders as Carstenszoon's COEN REVIER, was renamed the
PENNEFATHER RIVER. As the change took place during the administration of the
Hon. John Douglas, who used, as Government Resident at Thursday Island, to
patrol the pearl fisheries of the Gulf, it was probably made because he had
realised the impossibility of the inlet being the real Coen, while at the same
time he may have been unaware that it had already been named the Prince by
Tasman.</p>
<p>When Flinders and "the botanical gentlemen" finally rowed out of the
supposed Coen River (to which we may henceforth refer as the PENNEFATHER) and
rejoined the ship, at 3 p.m., he resumed his narrative:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We then steered south-westward along the shore, and
soon after sunset anchored in 10 fathoms nearly four miles from the land,
which...was still low and woody and fronted with a sandy beach." According to
the chart, the anchorage was in 12&deg; 23 'S.<br>
<br>
"8th November, 1802. Early in the morning we steered along the coast, with good
soundings, between 10 and 9 fathoms, muddy bottom. A SANDY POINT, with two
hillocks on it,...was passed at 10 o'clock; and, seeing a large bight
[ALBATROSS BAY.&mdash;R. L. J.] round it, we tacked to work up...This point is
one of the very few remarkable projections to be found on this low coast, but
it is not noticed in the Dutch chart. [It is, however (unknown to Flinders),
very clearly referred to in Carstenszoon's diary of the voyage of the
'<i>Pera</i>' on 12th May, 1623.&mdash;R. L. J.] There is little doubt,
however, that it was seen in 1606, in the yacht '<i>Duyfken</i>' the first
vessel which discovered any part of Carpentaria; and, that the remembrance may
not be lost, I gave the name of the vessel to the point. Our observations
placed the south extreme of DUYFKEN POINT in 12&deg; 35' S. and 141&deg; 42" E.
[It had already been named ASSCHENS HOEK by Asschens, Skipper of the
'<i>Buijs</i>' who passed it on 26th April, 1756.&mdash;R. L. J.]<br>
<br>
"On the sea breeze setting in at 2 o'clock, we steered into the bight until
past 5, when, having no more water than 2&frac12; fathoms, we tacked and
stretched out. The bight extends 11 or 12 miles back from the line of the
coast, and there are THREE SMALL OPENINGS in it; but the shore being so low and
in many places overrun with mangroves, these openings are probably no more than
drains out of salt swamps or lagoons. The bearings when we tacked in 2&frac12;
fathoms were:&mdash;<br>
<br>
[1] Duyfken Point, south extreme, distant 6 or 7 miles, N. 63&deg; W.<br>
<br>
[2] A small opening behind it, distant 5 or 6 miles, N. 23&deg; W.<br>
<br>
[3] A second opening, distant 4 miles, N. 64&deg; E.<br>
<br>
[4] A third, distant 3 miles, S. 78&deg; E.]</blockquote>
<p>These bearings, taken from the shoals off Urquhart Point, very accurately
locate:&mdash;</p>
<p>[2] PINE OR NOMENADE CREEK, referred to in Tasman's chart as a wooded inlet
("REVIER MIT BOSCH").</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 136}</u></p>
<p>[3] MYALL CREEK, now known as the MISSION RIVER.</p>
<p>[4] The EMBLEY RIVER, which is navigable for boats for a good many miles,
and on which the WEIPA MISSION STATION now stands.</p>
<p>Having "reached out of the bight" at 8 p.m., a southward course was kept
till 10.30, when the anchor was dropped, approximately in 12&deg; 45' S.
lat.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Next morning" (9th November), says Flinders,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> "I set the west extreme of Duyfken Point at N.
9&deg; E. and the furthest land in the opposite direction at S. 9&deg; E. [SEE
MAP D.] This land forms the south side of the large bight, and besides
projecting beyond the coast-line and being a little higher than usual, is
remarkable for having some reddish cliffs in it and deep water near the shore.
It is not noticed in the Dutch chart [referring to Thevenot's chart.&mdash;R.
L. J.], but I called it PERA HEAD, to preserve the name of the second vessel
which, in 1623, sailed along this coast."</blockquote>
<p>Modern maps give the name PERA HEAD to the northmost point of this blunt
promontory, while its southern portion, where the "reddish cliffs" are marked
on Flinders' chart, is distinguished as FALSE PERA HEAD; on the other hand,
Flinders, in his chart, applies the name of False Pera Head to a blunt
projection about 14 miles south of Pera Head proper. It is to be noted that
Flinders' FALSE PERA HEAD is in 13&deg; 8' S., practically where Gonzal, in the
"<i>Rijder</i>" had placed RIJDER'S HOEK in 1756.</p>
<p>It is fortunate that Flinders did not add a third name to the two which had
already been given to the "bight" so carefully charted by him. TASMAN had named
it VLIEGE BAIJ in 1644, and as such it was recognised by ASSCHENS, in the
"<i>Buijs</i>" on 26th April, 1756. On 31st May, 1756, GONZAL, in the
"<i>Rijder</i>" had named it MOSSEL BAAIJ. Tasman's name of Vliege Bay has
undoubtedly the right of priority, but usage has irrevocably fixed the name of
ALBATROSS BAY, bestowed upon it about 1881, after the small government steamer
used for patrol purposes during the residency of the Hon. John Douglas.</p>
<p>The narrative of Flinders is resumed, after his sailing out of Albatross Bay
on 9th November, 1802:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"PERA HEAD was passed at a distance of one mile and
a half at noon, with 9 fathoms water; and the most projecting part of the cliff
found to be in 12&deg; 58&frac12;' S. and 141&deg; 40' E. The sea breeze had
then set in, and we steered southward till past 10 o'clock, when a decrease in
the soundings to 3 fathoms obliged us to tack at a league from the land; and
the wind being at south-west, we worked along the shore till 10 in the evening,
and then anchored in 6 fathoms, oozy bottom. At daylight (10th November), the
land was seen to be 5 miles distant, equally low and sandy as before; and a
SMALL OPENING in it, perhaps not accessible to boats, bore S. 79&deg; E. [mouth
of ARCHER RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.]."</blockquote>
<p>Between Pera Head and the anchorage of 9th November, Flinders had
unwittingly passed the inlet in 13&deg; 7' S. where</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Terra Australis</i>, II, p. 129.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 137}</u></p>
<p>Carstenszoon landed on 8th May, 1623, and which he named the COEN REVIER.
The unfortunate misidentification of this inlet with the "Coen River" of the
goldfield has already been alluded to. Carstenszoon's latitude (13&deg; 7' S.)
places it north of the blunt projection which Gonzal named RIJDER'S HOEK on
13th June, 1756, and which Flinders saw obviously from a distance and named
FALSE PERA HEAD (not what is called False Pera Head on modern charts). In
Chapters <a href="#ch85">LXXXV</a> and <a href="#ch89">LXXXIX</a> it is shown
that Carstenszoon's Coen Revier is the creek located by the missionaries about
13&deg; 4' S.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"On getting under way again [10th November]"
continues Flinders, "we closed in with the shore and steered along it at the
distance of 2 or 3 miles, in soundings from 3 to 7 fathoms, until noon. Our
latitude was then 13&deg; 42' 35", long. 141&deg; 32', being nearly the
position of CAPE KEERWEER, at which the yacht '<i>Duyfken</i>' gave up her
examination. I could see nothing like a cape here; but the southern extreme of
the land, seen from the masthead, projects a little, and from respect to
antiquity the Dutch name is there preserved [i.e., at 13&deg; 57' S.&mdash;R.
L. J.]. At 4, we passed the southern extremity of CAPE KEERWEER, round which
the coast falls back somewhat; the water then became more shallow and did not
admit of [the coast] being safely approached nearer than 4 miles. An opening is
laid down here in the Dutch chart, called VEREENICHDE RIVER, which certainly
has no existence. [Evidently referring to Thevenot's map, which puts the
Vereenichde River in 14 and makes no mention of Cape Keerweer. Flinders does
not deny the existence of the river, but merely states that it is not in the
position assigned to it by the Dutch chart.&mdash;R. L. J.] All this afternoon
the sea breeze was fresh and favourable, and by 8 o'clock, when we anchored in
5 fathoms [This would be about opposite the mouth of Jardine's Hersey
Creek.&mdash;R. L. J.], the distance run from noon exceeded 40 miles. A fire
was seen on the land about 4 miles off, and some smokes had been passed in the
day; so that the country should seem to be at least as well peopled in this
part of Carpentaria as further northward. The coast was, if possible, still
lower than before; not a single hill had yet been seen; and the tops of the
trees in the highest land had scarcely exceeded the height of the ship's
masthead."</blockquote>
<p>In coasting from the mouth of the ARCHER RIVER southward to CAPE KEERWEER,
Flinders failed to observe two inlets noted on Tasman's chart, in 13&deg;
27-30' and 13&deg; 42' S. The former was erroneously identified by Tasman with
Carstenszoon's COEN and the latter was named by him VISSCHER'S REVIER. It would
not surprise me if both inlets should turn out to be mouths of the Archer
River. It <i>would</i> be surprising if a river of such importance as the
Archer were almost the only one on the western coast of Carpentaria to have a
single mouth. In fact, the Dugally River, located on a missionary sketch-map in
13&deg; 33&frac12;' S., is obviously a mouth of the Archer, and probably the
same is true of Visscher's Revier.</p>
<p>Continuing his account of the voyage. Flinders writes (II, p.
130):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"11th November, 1802.&mdash;The land wind came from
NNE., and our course was pursued along the shore at the usual distance. At 8
o'clock, the depth decreased</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 138}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">to 2&frac12; fathoms and obliged us to steer off,
though 5 miles from the land; and when fair soundings were obtained, the tops
of the trees only were visible from the deck. [SEE MAP F.] At noon we had
closed in again, the shore being distant 5 or 6 miles and the depth 6 fathoms,
on a gravelly bottom. Our latitude was 14&deg; 51' 5", long. 141&deg; 33'; the
extremes seen from the deck bore N. 29&deg; to S. 26&deg; E., and a smoke was
seen arising at S. 28&deg; E. The sea breeze came in from the south-westward,
but the trending of the coast being nearly SSE., we lay along it until past 4
o'clock and then tacked off, in 3 fathoms...At 8 in the evening, the breeze
died away, and a stream anchor was dropped in 5 fathoms, mud and shells, 5 or 6
miles off the shore, where the latitude, from an observation of the moon, was
15&deg; 5' S.<br>
<br>
"12th November, 1802.&mdash;At sunrise next morning, the ship was steering
southward, with a land wind at east; and at 7 o'clock we passed an OPENING near
which several NATIVES were collected. The entrance seemed to be a full mile in
width, but a spit from the south side runs so far across that there is probably
no access to it unless for rowing boats. Its latitude is 15&deg; 12' S.,
corresponding with a bight in the Dutch chart to the south of the second
waterplaets. [This, beyond question, was the VEREENICHDE REVIER, afterwards
named by LEICHHARDT the MITCHELL RIVER. R.L.J.]...Our course southward was
continued at 2 or 3 miles from the shore...The latitude at noon was 15&deg; 25'
20", and long. 141&deg; 32'. At 1 o'clock, we steered SSW., with the whaleboat
ahead...until 7 in the evening, when the stream anchor was dropped about 4
miles from the shore. [SEE MAP H.]<br>
<br>
"13th November, 1802.&mdash;We were again under way very soon after 5 o'clock,
and at 6, being then 4 miles from the land and steering SSW., a LAGOON was seen
from the masthead over the front beach. It has doubtless some connection with
the sea, either by a constant or a temporary opening, but none such could be
perceived. The latitude, 15&deg; 53', corresponds with that of NASSAU REVIER in
the old chart; and from the examples already seen of the Dutch rivers here it
seems probable that this lagoon was meant. [Subsequent cartographers have
accepted Flinders' suggestion, which was, however, altogether a mistaken one.
CARSTENSZOON gave the name of NASSAU REVIER to an inlet in 16&deg; 10' S.,
where modern Lands Department charting places the mouth of an unnamed creek,
near the head of which were LEICHHARDT'S CAMPS of 2nd and 3rd July, 1845.
Thevenot's chart (perhaps reduced and generalised from Tasman's) places the
Nassau about 16.&mdash;R. L. J.]<br>
<br>
"A few miles further south, the shoal water obliged me to run westward out of
sight of land from the deck. [Thus Flinders missed the 'Tidal Arm' of
LEICHHARDT'S 'ROCKY CREEK,' which had already been named the REVIER PERA by
TASMAN.&mdash;R. L. J.] At noon, when the latitude was 16&deg; 24' 29" and
longitude 141&deg; 14&frac12;, trees were visible from the deck at N. 70&deg;
E., and from thence to S. 50&deg; E., the nearest part, whence a smoke arose,
being distant 7 or 8 miles, and the depth of water 4 fathoms. The slight
projection here is probably one of those marked in the old chart on each side
of STATEN RIVER; but where the river can be found I know not."</blockquote>
<p>This "nearest part" of the land, "whence a smoke arose," is identifiable,
with the aid of Flinders' chart, about 16&deg; 25', where, as a matter of fact,
one of the mouths of a large river is placed by modern Lands Department maps.
Flinders' identification of it, however, with the STATEN REVIER of the
"<i>Pera's</i>" voyage is a very unhappy one, the latter (which was the
"furthest south" of the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>") being, in all
probability, ACCIDENT INLET, one of the mouths of the GILBERT RIVER, in
latitude 17&deg; 13' S. To do Flinders justice, the identification of an inlet
which he did not even see was suggested by him in the most tentative way; but
it was accepted by Stokes (1841), Leichhardt (1845) and Jardine (1864), and the
river has become</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 139}</u></p>
<p>for all time the STAATEN RIVER, <i>de facto</i>, though not <i>de jure</i>.
It is noteworthy that Flinders, although his diary carefully gives the
latitudes and his conjectures as to the identification of his inlets with "the
Dutch chart" (Thevenot's), his own chart, "North Coast, Sheet 2," names no
rivers or inlets south of Cape Keerweer. The inference is that although he
indulged in conjectures his intention was to be careful not to commit
himself.</p>
<p>Flinders continues his narrative of 13th November:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The nearest approach made to the land in the
afternoon was 5 or 6 miles, with 3 fathoms water. At dusk we anchored in 6
fathoms, mud, at 6 or 7 miles from the shore. [Flinders' chart gives the
latitude of this anchorage as 16&deg; 41' S., i.e., just outside of the
'<i>Pera's</i>' anchorage of 26th April, 1623.&mdash;R. L. J.]"</blockquote>
<p>The voyage was resumed at daylight on 14th November.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We steered," says Flinders, "a course nearly due
south, which, as the coast then trended southward, brought us in with it. At
noon, the latitude was 17&deg; 3' 15", longitude 141&deg; 0': a PROJECTING PART
bore N. 59&deg; E., 3 or 4 miles. [SEE MAP M.]...There appeared to be a SMALL
OPENING on the south side of this little projection, which corresponds in
latitude to VAN DIEMEN'S RIVER in the old chart [Thevenot's.&mdash;R. L. J.],
but across the entrance was an extensive flat, nearly dry, and would probably
prevent even boats from getting in. If this place had any title to be called a
river in 1664 [i.e., by Tasman.&mdash;R. L. J.], the coast must have undergone
a great alteration since that time."</blockquote>
<p>TASMAN'S CHART, according to Swart's version, gives to his VAN DIEMEN RIVER
the latitude of 17&deg; 30', and it cannot therefore be doubted that Flinders
was in error in supposing his "small opening" south of the "little
projection"&mdash;where, in fact, one of the mouths of Leichhardt's GILBERT
RIVER is pushing out delta-mud into the Gulf to be the Van Diemen Inlet. The
"small opening" must be the SMITHBURN RIVER of modern Lands Department maps,
which is one of the numerous mouths of the GILBERT.</p>

afternoon, our course along shore was more westward; and this, with the
increasing shallowness of the water, made me apprehend that the Gulph would be
found to terminate nearly as represented in the old charts, and disappoint the
hopes formed of a strait or passage leading out at some other part of Terra
Australis. At 4 o'clock, after running more than an hour in 3&frac12; fathoms,
or less than 3 at high water, our distance from the shore was 5 miles, and a

at the south-east extremity of the Gulph in the Dutch charts [i.e., in
Thevenot's version of Tasman's chart. My impression is that Thevenot, in
reducing Tasman's chart to an inconveniently small scale, found himself crowded
towards the south-eastern corner of the Gulf and omitted some of Tasman's
names.&mdash;R. L. J.], but," continues Flinders, "whatever it might have been
in Tasman's time, no navigator would now think of attempting to enter it with a
ship. The latitude is 17&deg; 26' and longitude 140&deg; 52' E. From 4 till 7,

<blockquote class="inline">then stood off; and the water being smooth, anchored
on muddy ground in 4&frac12; fathoms, which became 3&frac12; at low
water."</blockquote>
<p>The position of this anchorage is not given on Flinders' own chart. The
"small opening" in 17&deg; 26', which Flinders thought might be TASMAN'S CARON
RIVER, was the mouth of the modern NORMAN RIVER, which was named the VAN DIEMEN
REVIER by TASMAN in 1644. The precise position of the mouth, according to
Captain John Lort Stokes' survey of 1844, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> is
17&deg; 28'. Stokes suggests, by a dotted line entering the sea in 17&deg; 23',
the position of the CARON RIVER, and in this position, according to the Lands
Department Map, Sheet 19A, there actually appears an insignificant
water-course. But it is easier to believe that Flinders' position was two
minutes too far north than that it was three minutes too far south, and the
mouth of the NORMAN RIVER, however little Flinders may have thought of its
possibilities, is a genuine "opening" and is at the present day the port for
Normanton and the Croydon goldfield. Granting that the modern NORMAN RIVER is
TASMAN'S VAN DIEMEN (and there seems no room for doubt), his VAN DER LIJN'S
REVIER was the "Bynoe" mouth of the FLINDERS RIVER, and his CARON REVIER was
the principal mouth of the Flinders. Flinders' course after he saw (from a
distance) the mouth of what he erroneously took for the Caron was too far from
the land to permit of his seeing the Van der Lijn and Caron Inlets.</p>
<p>As Flinders, when he altered his course after passing the supposed Caron
Inlet, passed out of the waters of the Cape York Peninsula, it is unnecessary
for us to follow his further progress with critical minuteness. Some
observations on the character of his work are, however, in place here.</p>
<p>From his earliest youth, Flinders had put before himself a lofty ideal, his
constant endeavour, as he declared, being to do his work in such a manner that
no one should have to come after him to correct it. Incidentally, it may be
mentioned that he carried a chronometer, and his longitudes are reliable, which
even Cook's were not. The chronometer was first adapted to navigation by James
Harrison in 1735. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> It had been officially
tested on a voyage to Barbados in 1763, when its efficiency was demonstrated,
and it is odd that Cook was not furnished with one, and had to rely mainly on
lunar observations for his longitudes. <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> In a
word, the accuracy of Flinders' own work along the western coast of the Cape
York Peninsula was beyond praise. On the other hand, his interpretation of the
work of previous</p>

<p>navigators was very faulty. For this, however, he could hardly be blamed, as
his identifications were for the most part based on second-hand and erroneous
<i>data</i>. He had not the advantage of access to the most important
documents, viz., Carstenszoon's diary of the "<i>Pera's</i>" voyage and
Tasman's chart of his second voyage, both of which came to light after his
time. The onus of the confusion which has arisen lies rather with those
cartographers who came after him and who treated his obviously tentative
suggestions as authoritative statements.</p>
<p>The "<i>Lady Nelson</i>" was destined to make another appearance in Torres
Strait. In 1824, with the double object of extending British commerce with the
east and forestalling the suspected intention of the French to claim part of
Australia, H.M.S. "<i>Tamar</i>" Captain James Gordon Bremer, was sent out from
England to Sydney with instructions to establish a settlement in the vicinity
of Melville Island. At Sydney, the "<i>Tamar</i>" was joined by the
"<i>Countess of Harcourt</i>" and the "<i>Lady Nelson</i>" commissioned by the
colonial authorities to assist in the conveyance of troops and stores.</p>
<p>The three ships sailed via Cape Grafton, Snapper Island, Cape Tribulation,
Cape Flattery and the Howick Islands, passed Cape Melville and the Flinders
Islands, and anchored off Cape Direction on 12th September, 1824. (SEE MAPS C,
B AND E AND ADMIRALTY CHART, No. 2922.) Thence they sailed by Forbes Island and
BLIGH'S SUNDAY ISLAND to the BIRD ISLANDS <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
(13th September). (SEE MAP B.) From the Bird group they sailed to MOUNT
ADOLPHUS ISLAND, where they anchored on 14th September. (SEE MApA.) They had,
in the course of the day, passed TURTLE ISLAND, where BLIGH had been with the
"<i>Bounty's</i>" launch on a Tuesday (which may therefore be considered his
TUESDAY ISLAND, even if he did not name it so). On 15th September the
"<i>Tamar</i>" and her consorts passed WEDNESDAY and THURSDAY ISLANDS, got into
the open sea and, keeping a westerly course, crossed the mouth of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, to anchor at PORT ESSINGTON on 20th September.</p>
<p>So far as his journals and charts show, Bligh (1789) named only Sunday and
Wednesday Islands. Lagoon Island, of the Bird group, and Turtle Island, off the
mouth of the Escape River, were, respectively, the islands at which he touched
on Monday and Tuesday. He named Wednesday Island because he passed it that day
on his way to the open sea, but obviously he could not have named Thursday and
Friday Islands. There is no Monday Island on modern charts, but there are
TUESDAY, THURSDAY and FRIDAY ISLANDS (the Tuesday Island not being where Bligh
was on Tuesday), and the question arises, who named the three last? As
regards</p>
<blockquote>[1) Bligh had landed on Lagoon Island, one of the Bird group, on
Monday, 1st June, 1789, and that may therefore be regarded as his Monday
Island.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 142}</u></p>
<p>Thursday Island, at least, the date of its naming is narrowed down by its
mention by the Commander of the "<i>Lady Nelson</i>" to the period between 1789
and 1824. The probability is that KING named Tuesday, Thursday and Friday
Islands in 1818, although the names do not appear on his charts.</p>
<p>Having completed her mission at Port Essington, the "<i>Tamar</i>" left for
Mauritius and England on 10th November, 1824, taking the "<i>Countess of
Harcourt</i>" with her. The "<i>Lady Nelson</i>" was left behind, to make
herself useful in the transport and provisioning services required by the new
settlement. On 28th February, 1825, she set out from the port to bring
buffaloes from Timor. She fell into the hands of pirates and her men, with,
apparently, only one exception, were murdered. Her wreck lay for many years on
the rocks at Baba Island, one of the Serawatti group. <b style=

<p>Satisfied at last that he had really reached the "bottom" of the Gulf and
that there was no passage between "New South Wales" and the "mainland of New
Holland," and weary of the monotonous flats defended by wide shoals, Flinders
turned the head of the "<i>Investigator</i>" to the northwest, in order to
survey the western shores of the Gulf. On 22nd November, 1802, an anchorage was
found in INVESTIGATOR ROADS, between SWEERS and BENTINCK ISLANDS, and fears
having arisen as to the condition of the ship, she was careened and examined by
the carpenters. (SEE MAP M.) Their comprehensive report (26th November) may be
summed up in a single line of Kipling. The ship was "just a pack of rotten
planks puttied up with tar." With luck and fine weather she might hold together
for six months. Flinders resolved to pursue his work until the monsoons abated,
and then to make for Sydney by the west side of Australia, unless forced by
rough weather to run for shelter to some port in the East Indies.</p>
<p>After such repairs had been made as were possible in the circumstances,
Tasman's CAPE VAN DIEMEN was found to be an island, and named MORNINGTON
ISLAND. Next the SIR EDWARD PELLEW group of ISLANDS was visited and named. Here
were found traces of the former presence of MALAYS, in the shape of fragments
of pottery, basket-work, rags, etc. The so-called CAPE MARIA had to be called
MARIA ISLAND. In BLUE MUD BAY, the master's mate was fatally speared by
NATIVES. MELVILLE BAY was discovered on 12th February, 1803.</p>
<p>On 17th February, the "<i>Investigator</i>" left the Gulf and steered west
along the north coast of ARNHEM LAND. Here were met no</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 144}</u></p>
<p>fewer than sixty MALAY VESSELS, in squadrons. Their business was to collect
<i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> for sale to Chinese merchants at Timor.</p>
<p>Early in March, a severe outbreak of SCURVY reinforced the argument
furnished by the rotten condition of the ship in favour of a speedy return to
Sydney. Flinders therefore made for TIMOR, which was reached by the end of
March. His intention was to send Lieutenant Fowler home in any Europe-bound
ship, with his reports and charts, and a scheme for completing the survey. No
such ship offered itself, and the "<i>Investigator</i>" finally sailed for
Sydney on 16th April, 1803. She touched at CAPE LEEUWIN and the north-west cape
of Tasmania, but otherwise gave the land a wide berth. SYDNEY was reached on
9th June. Flinders was the first to CIRCUMNAVIGATE AUSTRALIA, although Tasman
had previously demonstrated its insularity, but not its separation from
Tasmania. The crew were in a very bad way with scurvy and dysentery, and
Flinders himself was much debilitated. As for the "<i>Investigator</i>," she
was in such a crazy condition that Flinders believed she must have foundered
had she encountered a single gale between Timor and Sydney. She had done her
last exploratory work, and was broken up at Deptford in 1810. <b style=

<p>After consultation with Governor King, Flinders determined to go to England
as a passenger by the "<i>Porpoise</i>" under command of Lieutenant Fowler, to
lay his charts and journals before the Admiralty and to solicit the grant of
another vessel to continue his investigations. Fowler's instructions were to go
by TORRES STRAIT "by the <i>route</i> Captain Flinders may indicate." The
"<i>Porpoise</i>" left Sydney on 10th August, 1803, accompanied by the
"<i>Bridgewater</i>" of the East India Company, and the "<i>Cato</i>" of
London, both bound for Batavia. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>On 17th August, the "<i>Porpoise</i>" which was in the lead, struck on WRECK
REEF (22&deg; 11' S., 155&deg; 13' E.) and the "<i>Cato</i>" immediately did
the same. The "<i>Bridgewater</i>" weathered the reef and shamefully deserted
her consorts. (She reached Bombay and left for London; after which she was
never heard of again.)</p>
<p>Three lives were lost in the WRECK, but the remainder (ninety-four</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Terra Australis</i>, II, p. 286.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 146}</u></p>
<p>in number) of the crews of the "<i>Porpoise</i>" and "<i>Cato</i>" got on a
dry sandbank. They saved what they could from the stranded "Porpoise" including
three months' provisions and sails to make tents, but the "<i>Cato</i>" had
disappeared.</p>
<p>On 25th August, Flinders took three weeks' rations and left for Sydney, with
Captain Park, of the "<i>Cato</i>" and twelve men, in a six-oared boat. The men
left on the sandbank did fairly well on the rations saved from the
"<i>Porpoise</i>" supplemented by fish and turtle, and they built a boat of 32
feet keel, which was ready for launching early in October.</p>
<p>Flinders arrived in SYDNEY on 8th September, his boat having rowed 700 miles
in fourteen days, and reported the disaster to Governor King. It was planned
that Captain Cummings, of the "<i>Rolla</i>" a 438-ton ship bound for Canton,
should call at the reef and take some of the shipwrecked men to his
destination, while the "<i>Francis</i>" was to bring the rest back to Sydney.
Flinders was to take command of the "<i>Cumberland</i>" a 29-ton schooner, and
sail her to England, with his charts and papers.</p>
<p>The flotilla left PORT JACKSON on 21st September and reached the sandbank on
7th October. Flinders selected to go with him on the "<i>Cumberland</i>" John
Aken, late Master of the "<i>Investigator</i>" Edward Charrington, Boatswain,
John Elder, Steward, and seven seamen; and, on 11th October the three ships
sailed for their respective destinations. From the first, the
"<i>Cumberland</i>" proved an unseaworthy craft. (SEE MAP A.) Flinders took her
through TORRES STRAIT, past MURRAY ISLAND (see Inset Map on Plate 13, Terra
Australis Atlas) on 22nd October, and thence, not far from his track in the
"<i>Investigator</i>" a year earlier, but a little to the south, through what
is now known as CUMBERLAND PASSAGE, and between HORN <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and WEDNESDAY ISLANDS (24th October), north of HAMMOND
ISLAND, and westward through PRINCE OF WALES CHANNEL, north of BOOBY ISLAND,
and westward, via Arnhem Land, towards TIMOR, which was reached on 10th
November.</p>
<p>Flinders had originally planned to call at Koepang, in Timor, Mauritius, the
Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena and the Canaries; but by King's desire Mauritius
was cut out of the programme. As it happened, there were no facilities for
repairs at Koepang, and Flinders therefore left, with his ship unrepaired, for
the Cape. Bad weather shortly afterwards compelled him, in spite of himself, to
run to the Mauritius for shelter: moreover, he doubted if it would be safe to
complete the voyage in the "<i>Cumberland</i>" and</p>
<blockquote>[1) Flinders did not actually give this name, but referred to "a
hill forming something like two horns at the top." This hill appeared to him to
be on PRINCE OF WALES ISLAND itself, but as he approached it from the
north-east he got a glimpse of a bight, which must have been the "BOAT PASSAGE"
separating what is now called HORN ISLAND from Prince of Wales Island.
Flinders, as well as Cook, passed north of ALBANY ISLAND, taking it for part of
the mainland.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 147}</u></p>
<p>hoped to sell her and get a passage to England by some other ship. He
arrived at Port Louis, MAURITIUS, on 17th December, 1803. When he left Sydney,
England had been at peace with France, but WAR, unknown to him, had broken out
soon after between the two countries.</p>
<p>The Governor, or Captain-General, of the island was GENERAL DE CAEN, an old
soldier, who had been, in fact, one of the most conspicuously heroic figures in
the battle of Hohenlinden, and was violently anti-British; and Flinders was
unfortunate enough to strike the wrong note with him from the first. In the
prejudiced eyes of the Governor, he appeared, to begin with, as an impostor;
next as a spy; and finally as an enemy who knew too much to be safely set free;
and all the time as a person of arrogant and unconciliatory bearing, who
demanded rights where he should have sued for favours. This was very far indeed
from being the true character of Flinders; but he was wounded by the hostile
reception he met with when he expected a sympathetic welcome and generous
assistance. On the other hand, it was undeniable that his passport was three
years old and was for the "<i>Investigator</i>" and not for the
"<i>Cumberland</i>" and he should have made allowance for the fact that his
mere presence at the Mauritius in a time of war would naturally raise a
suspicion that he was not engaged in the investigation covered by his French
passport. Although when Flinders left Sydney, Governor King had objected to his
touching at the Mauritius, he had foreseen the possibility of the
"<i>Cumberland</i>" being driven by stress of weather into French waters, and
that, in such a case, the necessity would arise for an explanation of her
presence there. Accordingly, he had provided Flinders with two letters
addressed to General Magallon, Governor of the Mauritius (De Caen's
predecessor), to be forwarded from the Cape, or by such opportunity as might
offer itself. These letters, together with passports and commission, were
actually sent ashore for the Governor's inspection when Flinders found himself
obliged to seek shelter and assistance. The probability is that De Caen chose
to regard them as personal and not official letters and declined to read them;
or if he did read them, considered them irrelevant, and confined himself to the
consideration of the passport and commission.</p>
<p>The details of FLINDERS' CAPTIVITY on the island, which grew, as it did, out
of a misunderstanding, are most distressing, but he received much kindness from
civilians and from some of the French officers. His detention lasted till 13th
June, 1810. Although, on 1st March, 1806, Napoleon, then Emperor, ordered
Flinders' release, the order did not reach Mauritius till July, 1807, and by
that time De Caen considered that the circumstances had altered, and took the
responsibility of disobeying the order, pending further instructions. Britain
had, in fact, gained the mastery of the sea;</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 148}</u></p>
<p>had taken possession of the Cape of Good Hope; and was threatening
Mauritius. In June, 1809, a British squadron was actually blockading the
island. On 15th March, De Caen consented to the liberation of Flinders. On 13th
June, Flinders had his sword returned to him and was liberated on parole.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The blockading squadron being still outside
the harbour, Flinders arranged for a passage in the "<i>Otter</i>" to the Cape,
where he was delayed for six weeks. In August, 1810, he embarked on the
"<i>Olympia</i>" and he reached ENGLAND on 23rd October. He lost no time in
rejoining the wife he had left as a bride more than nine years before. The
British captured Mauritius on 3rd December, 1810.</p>
<p>In spite of failing health, Flinders laboured for over three years on his
narrative and charts, and his great work on Terra Australis was published in
1814. The first copy of the book and atlas came to his hand on 18th July, and
he died on the 19th. His wife lived till 1852, and he left a daughter, born 1st
April, 1812.</p>

<h5>#1. FIRST VOYAGE OF THE "MERMAID"</h5>
<p>CAPTAIN, afterwards Admiral, PHILLIP PARKER KING, a son of Phillip Gidley
King, who had been Governor of New South Wales from 1800 to 1805, left England
in 1819 in H.M.S. "<i>Mermaid</i>" on a surveying cruise along the Australian
coast. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> He was accompanied by Allan Cunningham
as Botanist.</p>
<p>On 27th June, 1819, the "<i>Mermaid</i>" anchored in the ENDEAVOUR RIVER.
(SEE MAP E.) Amicable relations were maintained with the NATIVES for nearly a
week, but on 2nd July the aboriginal instincts of curiosity and acquisitiveness
brought about a rupture. Some of the sailors were washing clothes, to which the
natives took a violent fancy, going so far as to insist that one of the sailors
should denude himself for their benefit. They threw a spear, and shots had to
be fired over their heads before they would desist. Two days later, they
attempted to decoy and ambush the white visitors.</p>
<p>On 8th July, a boat was rowed up the ENDEAVOUR RIVER to</p>

Australia, 1819-22</i>, by Admiral Phillip P. King. London, 1827.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 150}</u></p>
<p>the limit of boat navigation, about 10 miles "as the crow flies," and this
portion of the river was charted and soundings were taken. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> In this chart, the name "MOUNT COOK" appears for the
first time.</p>
<p>The ship left the harbour on 11th July, and followed the coast to the north.
After passing CAPE BEDFORD and CAPE FLATTERY, Lieut. Jeffreys named the COLE
GROUP OF ISLANDS (off Murdoch Point), CAPE BOWEN <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> and CAPE NINIAN. On 14th July, the "<i>Mermaid</i>"
passed CAPE FLINDERS, the northmost point of Stanley Island, Flinders Group
(14&deg; 8' S.; 144&deg; 14" E.), where the wreck of the "<i>Frederick</i>" was
seen. On 20th July, King named HAGGERSTON and the SIR EVERARD HOME ISLANDS and
MARGARET BAY, all in the vicinity of Cape Grenville. (SEE MAP B.) Bligh had
already crossed the mouth of Margaret Bay in the "<i>Bounty's</i>" launch, in
1789.</p>
<p>On 24th July, the McARTHUR and HANNIBAL ISLANDS were named. <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> (SEE MAP A.) The same day the "<i>Mermaid</i>" grounded
off the mouth of the ESCAPE RIVER and was got off with great difficulty. It is
to this incident that the river owes its name, and not, as is generally
supposed, to the attempted escape of Kennedy.</p>
<p>From the Escape River, King steered (25th July) NNW., altering his course to
NW. between ALBANY and MOUNT ADOLPHUS ISLANDS. Practically following the
<i>route</i> taken by Bligh in the "<i>Bounty's</i>" launch, he rounded the
northern capes of WEDNESDAY and HAMMOND ISLANDS. Thence, between GOOD ISLAND
and the NORTH-WEST REEF (PRINCE OF WALES CHANNEL), he followed the track of
Flinders, in the "<i>Cumberland</i>" to BOOBY ISLAND. The long distance from
the Escape River to Booby Island was covered in a single day. Crossing the Gulf
of Carpentaria, WESSEL'S ISLAND was reached on 28th July. (ADMIRALTY CHART, No.
447.)</p>
<h5>#2. THIRD VOYAGE OF THE "MERMAID"</h5>
<p>The "<i>Mermaid's</i>" second voyage does not concern the present inquiry.
On her third, she left Sydney on 14th June, 1820, and anchored for the second
time in the ENDEAVOUR RIVER on 27th July. The previous watering-place was found
to be dry. (SEE MAP E.) The party made observations and took in wood and water,
and explored the land within a radius of 6 miles. The NATIVES appeared inclined
to be tricky: on one occasion, they approached furtively dragging spears with
their toes.</p>
<p>The anchor was weighed on 5th August, and on the following</p>

<p>day a party landed on the LIZARD ISLAND, where rough weather detained the
ship till the 8th. She touched on the 13th at Bligh's SUNDAY ISLAND, off Cape
Grenville, and on the 14th at CAIRNCROSS ISLAND. (SEE MAP A.) On 15th-16th
June, King followed Cook's track through ENDEAVOUR STRAIT to BOOBY ISLAND. He
passed CAPE WESSEL on 19th August, and reached Botany Bay on 4th December,
1820. (ADMIRALTY CHART, No. 447.)</p>
<h5>#3. VOYAGE OF THE "BATHURST"</h5>
<p>A survey of the "<i>Mermaid</i>" in Sydney showed her to be unfit for
further sea service, and after consultation with Governor Macquarie the
purchase of a 170-ton brig was effected. The ship was renamed the
"<i>Bathurst</i>" Her complement was 33 men, among whom were Allan Cunningham,
Botanical Collector, Andrew Montgomery, Surgeon, and an aboriginal named
Bardwell. The "<i>Bathurst</i>" left Sydney on 26th May, 1821, accompanied by
the merchant ship "<i>Dick</i>," bound for Batavia. On 17th June, the merchant
brig "<i>San Antonio</i>," from Sydney for Singapore, was overtaken at the
largest of the FRANKLAND ISLANDS (17&deg; 15' S., opposite the mouth of the
Mulgrave River), and she followed the "<i>Bathurst</i>" and "<i>Dick</i>." (SEE
MAP K.) The same night they anchored in TRINITY BAY, where they rode out a
storm. (SEE MAP G.) On 20th June, they were at LIZARD ISLAND, which, according
to King, is granite. (SEE MAP E.) On 21st June, they rounded CAPE MELVILLE and
crossed Bathurst Bay, landing, 22nd June (at BATHURST HEAD?). Here the landing
party was surprised and threatened by NATIVES, and one man was slightly
wounded. Presumably, the Bay, the Head and the Bathurst Range were named on
this occasion. This voyage showed that CAPE FLINDERS, till then believed to be
a point of the mainland, was really the northern extremity of the chain of
islands which prolongs Bathurst Head to the north for about 10 miles, and, as
King demonstrated the fact, it may be assumed that it was he who gave the
islands the name of the FLINDERS GROUP which they still bear. Cook had no idea
of the contour of this portion of the coast, as he was too far to the east to
see it in fact, outside of the Barrier Reef. Flinders was still further east,
both in the "<i>Investigator</i>" and "<i>Cumberland</i>."</p>
<p>On 23rd June, CUNNINGHAM observed aboriginal CAVEDRAWINGS on schistose
rocks, underlying sandstone, on CLACK'S ISLAND (144&deg; 15' E., 14&deg; 5'
S.). They were executed in white on a ground of red ochre, and represented
sharks, porpoises, turtles, lizards, tripang, starfish, clubs, canoes,
water-gourds and quadrupeds.</p>
<p>The ships were detained by bad weather from 27th June to 1st July, on which
day they reached the opening between ALBANY and MOUNT ADOLPHUS ISLANDS. (SEE
MAP A.) Thence they</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 152}</u></p>
<p>followed the "<i>Mermaid's</i>" track of 1818 to Booby Island, <i>via</i>
Prince of Wales Channel. The "<i>Bathurst</i>" left BOOBY ISLAND, where she
parted with the "<i>Dick</i>" and "<i>San Antonio</i>" on 1st July. CAPE WESSEL
was reached on 3rd July, 1821, and SYDNEY on 25th April, 1822.</p>
<p>The series of Admiralty Charts issued after King's surveys, bringing the
charts of Cook and Flinders up to date, may be said to have set the hydrography
of the Coral Sea on a firm foundation. There were, however, many shoals, reefs
and other dangers still to be located before Torres Strait could be safely
navigated by sailing vessels.</p>
<p>King was responsible for the "INNER PASSAGE" in the first issue of the
Sailing Directions. Two notes from the "Directions" may be quoted here, with a
view to their preservation:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The "<i>Lalla Rookh</i>" passing eastward through Torres Strait in 1821,
struck a reef "inside of "(i.e., east of) BOOBY ISLAND. She was repaired at
PORT LIHOU, on the south side of Prince of Wales Island, and concluded her
voyage to Sydney outside of the Barrier Reef.</p>

<p>The "<i>Charles Eaton</i>" a 313-ton barque, commanded by CAPTAIN G. F.
MOORE, left Sydney on 29th July, 1834, for Canton, and was WRECKED on the
Barrier Reef, near the SIR CHARLES HARDY ISLANDS. (SEE MAP B.) The only
available boat was taken by George Pigott (Boatswain), Laurence Constantine
(Carpenter), and three seamen, two of whom were William Frendall and Joseph
Wright. The four above named, having sailed through Torres Strait, landed at
Timor Laut after a run of only five days, the fifth man having died on the
voyage. It was not till twelve months later that they were able to leave the
island, and they eventually reached Amboyna and Batavia, whence the news of the
wreck slowly travelled to Sydney.</p>
<p>The story told by these men was that on 15th August, 1834, the "<i>Charles
Eaton</i>" "was making for an apparent opening in the reef near Sir Charles
Hardy's Islands" (ENE. of Cape Grenville) when she grounded. "She fell
broadside on, the sea making a clear breach over her. The longboat and one of
the quarter boats were stove. The remaining boat was lowered and three seamen
jumped into her. The Captain and officers determined to continue in the ship,
as they thought the boat could not live. The rest of the crew and passengers
went on the poop."</p>
<p>The Captain of the ship "<i>Mangles</i>" reported that he had seen, on an
island in Torres Strait, a white boy who said he had been in</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 154}</u></p>
<p>the wreck of the "<i>Charles Eaton</i>" The Captain made an unsuccessful
attempt to get the boy from the natives.</p>
<p>For the rescue of any of the crew or passengers who might still be alive
among the natives, the Government of New South Wales fitted out their schooner
the "<i>Isabella</i>" under command of CAPTAIN C. M. LEWIS. The Captain's
journal was edited by CAPTAIN PHILLIP PARKER KING, R.N.<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> Additional particulars are given by WILLIAM EDWARD
BROCKETT. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> The words "I shipped on the
'<i>Isabella</i>'" are the only clue to the capacity in which Brockett was on
board, but he was evidently an educated man, and was occasionally entrusted
with difficult and delicate duties, so that it may be taken for granted that he
was an officer.</p>
<p>The story has also been lucidly retold by CAPTAIN JAMES H. WATSON in the
<i>Scottish Australasian</i> for September, 1916.</p>
<p>The Hon. East India Company also sent their sloop "<i>Tigris</i>" (CAPTAIN
IGGLESTON) from Bombay on the same quest. The two search ships, in fact, met at
Double Island, Torres Strait.</p>
<p>In a very short time after striking the reef, the "<i>Charles Eaton</i>"
became a hopeless wreck, but the upper part held together and gave a foothold
for the greater number of the passengers and crew.</p>
<p>When she left Sydney, there were altogether thirty-one persons on the ship,
including about a dozen passengers, among whom were Captain D'Oyley, H.E.I.
Co.'s Artillery, his wife, two sons and a native Indian servant, Dr. Grant and
George Armstrong, Barrister. Five left with the boat, leaving twenty-six on the
wreck.</p>
<p>After the departure of the boat, as above related, the first raft was
constructed, but it proved of insufficient capacity. The raft, therefore,
carrying only nine persons, viz.. Captain Lewis, Dr. Grant, Mr. Armstrong,
Captain D'Oyley, his wife and two sons and native servant, with, probably, an
officer or seaman, left the ship. Of the fate of this FIRST RAFT little is
known with certainty. The only survivors were the two D'Oyley boys, who said
that the ADULTS of the party had all been killed. The boys were taken in a
canoe to an island, probably AUREED, and in all probability the heads of the
adults were taken there at the same time. (SEE MAP A.) So at least we are
justified in conjecturing from what happened to the occupants of the second
raft.</p>
<p>Seven days after the first, a SECOND RAFT left the ship, carrying seventeen
persons, including Mr. Clare (Chief Officer), W. Mayor (2nd Officer), John
Ireland (Steward's Boy), a boy named Sexton,</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 155}</u></p>
<p>and thirteen others. These, after being two days and nights half-immersed in
the sea, on a daily ration of two glasses of water and half a biscuit, drifted
among a number of small islands. In the morning of the third day, they saw a
canoe, carrying about a dozen natives, approaching. The natives were apparently
unarmed, and appeared very friendly. Proposals that the castaways should land
were acceded to, and they were taken in the canoe to "the island of BOYDAN."
(SEE MAP B, BOYDONG, lat. 11&deg; 30' S., about 40 miles north-west of the Sir
Charles Hardy Islands.)</p>
<p>On this island, where there was neither water nor food, the castaways lay
defenceless, sleeping the sleep of utter exhaustion, when they were set upon
and BEATEN TO DEATH, with the exception of IRELAND and SEXTON, who for some
reason were spared, although Ireland had a spear wound. Growing boys have
obviously some potential value, even among savages. The heads of the murdered
men were cut off and placed, together with Ireland and Sexton, in a canoe which
proceeded to AUREED ISLAND, where a party of natives were in temporary
residence for the fishing season, and where they found the two D'OYLEY BOYS,
who had arrived before them. (SEE MAP A.)</p>
<p>With the addition of the crew of the canoes from Boydong and their captives,
and the murderers of the castaways of the first raft and their captives, there
were now on this island about fifty persons. About two months after the arrival
of Ireland and Sexton, the natives left the island in two parties. No. 1 PARTY
took Ireland and the two-year-old D'Oyley boy, and No. 2 PARTY took Sexton and
the elder D'Oyley boy, and both set out in their canoes, for destinations which
were of course unknown to the captives.</p>
<p>The boys with No. 2 PARTY of savages were never heard of again. No. 1 PARTY,
after cruising among islands for some weeks, reached MARSDEN ISLAND. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> To this island came, after a time, a native named
Dappar and his wife, who took Ireland and the younger D'Oyley boy to their home
on MURRAY ISLAND, where they were kindly treated until their rescue by the
"<i>Isabella</i>."</p>
<p>Ireland related that at BOYDONG ISLAND the savages ate the eyes and cheeks
of the murdered people, not, as he judged, for food, but with an idea that the
act would increase their efficiency against enemies.</p>
<p>The "<i>Isabella</i>" left SYDNEY on 3rd June, 1836, and on the 9th was "in
the latitude of CATO'S REEF" (23&deg; 20' S. and 155&deg; 35' E.). (ADMIRALTY
CHART, No. 780.) Six days later, Captain Lewis saw floating wreckage, but did
not suppose it to have come from the "<i>Charles Eaton</i>." On 17th June, the
northmost reefs of the EASTERN FIELDS (ADMIRALTY CHART, No. 2759 A) were
rounded</p>
<blockquote>[1) This island was probably named in honour of the Rev. Samuel
Marsden, Rector of St. John's, Parramatta, who, in 1812 and for many years
after, was unofficially regarded as "the head of the English Church in New
South Wales." See J. P. McGuanne in <i>Journ. Roy. Aust. Hist. Soc.,</i> Vol. V
(1919).]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 156}</u></p>
<p>and a westward course was set for the "PANDORA PASSAGE" in the Barrier Reef
(ADMIRALTY CHART, No. 2422), which was cleared in lat. 9&deg; 58' S. and long.
144&deg; 46' E. on the 18th, and before noon of that day the anchor was dropped
off Murray Island. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>In the absence of all information, Captain Lewis' obvious course would have
been to commence his search for survivors at the Sir Charles Hardy Islands,
where the wreck took place. But the meeting of the captain of the
"<i>Mangles</i>" with a white boy on an island in Torres Strait indicated that
survivors might be searched for further to the north, and therefore MURRAY
ISLAND was selected as the starting-point.</p>
<p>Natives of Murray Island came out in canoes and made known by signs that a
white man was with them. This man, who proved to be JOHN IRELAND, two years
older than when he shipped as Steward's Boy on the "<i>Charles Eaton</i>" was
ultimately brought out to the "<i>Isabella</i>" and exchanged for tomahawks.
Later on, WILLIAM, the younger of the D'OYLEY boys, was also produced and
ransomed, the chief difficulty being his reluctance to part with his black
foster-mother. He did not understand English, but spoke the Murray Island
language fluently.</p>
<p>On 24th June, the "<i>Isabella's</i>" launch was sent to WYER ISLAND, south
of Murray Island, where the men saw a string of HUMAN SKULLS in a hut. There
was no reason to suppose that the skulls were those of white men, but they, no
doubt, gave Captain Lewis a hint.</p>
<p>Four days later, the "<i>Isabella</i>" left for Darnley Island, steering
north-west, but grounded on Canoe Key, where she was detained for a week. On
the 5th July, she sailed round the reefs east and north of DARNLEY ISLAND, and
anchored on the north side of the island. The natives recognised the two boys.
The island was searched for survivors of the wreck, but without avail. On 21st
July, the low woody islands west of Darnley Island, viz., STEPHEN'S and
CAMPBELL'S, were searched, and also (by parties in the two whaleboats) islands
lying to the windward, known by the native names of MASSEED and CADDOW
(presumably the two YORKE ISLANDS designated on the modern chart MASSIK and
KODALL). <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> The inhabitants, who were apparently
in a state of great alarm and anxious to get rid of their visitors, came down
to the beach, offering gifts of coco-nuts, shells, etc. Ireland believed that
they had skulls hidden in the bush, but they denied the imputation and
fled.</p>
<p>On 25th July, the "<i>Isabella</i>" anchored at AUREED ISLAND, which was
carefully searched. No natives were met with, but in a hut there were found a
great number of SKULLS, many of them having marks of violence, lashed with rope
of European make to a</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 157}</u></p>
<p>mask-like figure of turtle-shell. The skulls were taken possession of and
carried to Sydney, where a sufficient number were pronounced to be OF EUROPEAN
ORIGIN to account for the majority of the shipwrecked people.</p>
<p>The object of the expedition had been attained, and the "<i>Isabella</i>"
left Aureed on 26th July, on the home voyage, calling at HALFWAY, MOUNT
ADOLPHUS and DOUBLE ISLANDS. While at Double Island, the "<i>Isabella</i>" was
overtaken by the "<i>Tigris</i>" It appeared that the latter had sailed
south-west from Murray Island by a new <i>route</i>, now known as the TIGRIS
PASSAGE, changed her course to north-west and rounded the north end of Halfway
Island and followed on the track taken by the "<i>Isabella</i>" to DOUBLE
ISLAND. The two ships left Double Island on 2nd August, passed through the
PRINCE OF WALES CHANNEL, passed BOOBY ISLAND on 3rd August and reached RAFFLES
BAY, and ultimately TIMOR, where they parted, the "<i>Isabella</i>" for Sydney
and the "<i>Tigris</i>" for India.</p>
<p>Although the geographical results of the "<i>Isabella's</i>" voyage were of
no great importance, the voyage furnished ethnological <i>data</i> of
considerable value. It gave, before the disturbing influence of a white
invasion had had time to make itself seriously felt, a picture of the islands
of the Coral Sea inhabited by a race of Papuan type, absolutely distinct from
the Australian, who, while carrying their agricultural acquirements with them,
had specialised in navigation and fishing, roaming from island to island in
their canoes, fishing and turtle-hunting here and there at what their
observation of winds, rains and currents had taught them were seasonable times
for their pursuits, with, probably, only a limited enjoyment of home or head
quarters. They worked the islands and fishing and hunting grounds on a
carefully thought out plan, comparable to a scientific rotation of crops. As
far as their opportunities permitted, they were HEAD-HUNTERS and SLAVERS. They
penetrated by sea at least as far south as CAPE GRENVILLE, and it is very
singular indeed that they seem never to have attempted to seize or settle upon
the mainland of Australia, and that they had communicated very few of their
accomplishments to the inhabitants of the continent. So far as observation
goes, slight or local infusions of Papuan blood into the Australian race are
the only traces of their descents on the coast. It seems to me that the only
possible explanation must be that they had not had time enough to make their
mark on the Cape York Peninsula. In other words, it may not have been many
centuries, or perhaps not even many generations, since they had begun their
systematic exploitation of the Torres Strait islands and reefs. To all
appearances, they had not had time, up to 1836, to exhaust or seriously
impoverish the fishing and hunting grounds which it was their custom to harry
year after year.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 158}</u></p>
<p>It is stated by Captain Watson <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> that Captain
Moore, of the "<i>Charles Eaton</i>" carried CAPTAIN SAMUEL ASHMORE'S CHARTS,
which I have been unable to find, although modern Admiralty charts locate
several "dangers," etc., as having been "seen by Mr. Ashmore." According to
Captain Watson, Ashmore was "a well-known master mariner of Sydney who, like
Captain Thomas Beckford Simpson, of a decade or two later, never went a voyage
without, on his return, giving his brother mariners and the public the benefit
of what he learned by a careful study of the many problems which confronted the
early navigators, of the dangers on the Australian coast."</p>

<h4>THE "BEAGLE"</h4>
<h5>#1. FIRST CAPE YORK SURVEYING VOYAGE, 1839</h5>
<p>On 29th May, 1839, Commander John Clements Wickham left Sydney in H.M.S.
"<i>Beagle</i>" to explore the northern part of the Australian continent. The
story of this and the other Australian voyages of the "<i>Beagle</i>" is told
by Captain (afterwards Admiral)</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 160}</u></p>
<p>J. Lort Stokes, who succeeded Wickham in the command in 1841. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>An interesting link with the last important surveying voyage was found at
Port Stephens, where Wickham and his officers were the guests of CAPTAIN
PHILLIP PARKER KING, who was settled as Superintendent of the AUSTRALIAN
AGRICULTURAL COMPANY. This company, in about eighty years of usefulness, up to
the present date has contributed greatly to the industrial progress of
Australia. (SEE MAP E.)</p>
<p>In crossing Princess Charlotte Bay, Wickham identified the "remarkable
level-topped hill" called by Captain Cook, JANE'S TABLELAND. (SEE MAP B.)</p>
<p>At the northern extremity of Lloyd Bay, he surveyed Cook's CAPE WEYMOUTH and
Bligh's RESTORATION ISLAND, which he observed were of granite.</p>
<p>In BOYDONG ISLAND, he recognised the scene of the massacre of the castaways
on the second raft from the "<i>Charles Eaton</i>" (SEE MAP A.)</p>
<p>Sailing, as Cook had done, between Reefs Y and Z, and between the Brothers
and Albany Islands, the "<i>Beagle</i>" was headed for MOUNT ADOLPHUS ISLAND,
where (in Blackwood Bay) the anchor was dropped on 12th July. From Mount
Adolphus Island, she sailed west, past POSSESSION ISLAND, into ENDEAVOUR
STRAIT. In this neighbourhood, channels about the WALLIS ISLANDS and Cape
Cornwall (PRINCE OF WALES ISLAND) were surveyed. Wickham called the largest of
the Prince of Wales Islands COOK ISLAND, but the name has not been adopted in
official cartography. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<p>A few days afterwards, the "<i>Beagle</i>" passed BOOBY ISLAND, on her way
to Port Essington. Some particulars regarding this island recorded by Stokes
are worthy of preservation. The island, he says, is 30 feet above sea-level and
is composed of porphyry. The famous "POST OFFICE" was started in 1835 by
Captain Hobson, of the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" (afterwards Governor of New
Zealand), who also erected a flagstaff on the island.</p>
<p>Wickham's observations and experiences during the rest of this voyage may be
briefly alluded to.</p>
<p>Leaving PORT ESSINGTON on 4th September, 1839, he called at PORT DARWIN
(12th September), and then he and Stokes explored the VICTORIA RIVER in boats.
(ADMIRALTY CHART, No. 2759 A.) Afterwards, on landing at POINT PEARCE, near the
mouth of that river, to correct his chronometers, Stokes was speared in the
left</p>

Rivers Explored and Surveyed during the Voyage of H.M.S. "Beagle" in the Years

J. Lort Stokes, Commander, R.N. London, 1846.</blockquote>

<p>shoulder by NATIVES from an ambush in a cliff. Having drawn out the spear,
he ran, with the natives in pursuit, to safety in the arms of a party of
sailors coming from the boat with instruments. By 12th December, he had
recovered from the wound sufficiently to bear the motion of the vessel, which
accordingly left Point Pearce for the Swan River settlement. Twelve days later,
he was "just able to crawl on the poop." At the SWAN RIVER, he was interested
in the shipping in Gage's Roads, which included some American whalers, and in
the infant city of PERTH. On 25th March, 1840, he visited the penal
establishment for aborigines on ROTTNEST ISLAND. A surveying cruise to the
north, along the western coast of Australia, commenced on 4th April and ended
at TIMOR on 23rd July, 1840.</p>
<p>TIMOR was left behind about 9th August. The SWAN RIVER was revisited. The
town of ALBANY was visited on 2nd and ADELAIDE on 27th November, and the
"<i>Beagle</i>" returned to SYDNEY on 23rd December.</p>
<h5>#2. SECOND CAPE YORK SURVEYING VOYAGE, 1841</h5>
<p>On 3rd June, 1841, the "<i>Beagle</i>" again left SYDNEY for Torres Strait,
this time in command of Captain Stokes, as Captain Wickham had not recovered
from dysentery contracted at the Swan River. On anchoring on 19th June at
RESTORATION ISLAND, off Cape Weymouth (SEE MAP B), it was found that the island
was temporarily occupied by a large party of BLACKS from Torres Strait, who had
come in canoes. Some further surveying was done between POSSESSION and WALLIS
ISLANDS (SEE MAP A), and BOOBY ISLAND was reached on 23rd June (SEE MAP H).</p>
<p>On 27th June, the "<i>Beagle</i>" lay off BOLD POINT (17&deg; S.; 140&deg;
56' E.), on the Cape York Peninsula. Two miles north-north-east of the point,
an inlet was observed, and, following Flinders, it was taken for Tasman's Van
Diemen Inlet. It was explored in whale-boats by Messrs. Forsyth, Fitzmaurice
and Tarrant up to fresh water, a distance of 27 miles by the windings, but not
more than 10 in a direct east-south-easterly line. NATIVES were seen, but they
displayed no hostility. This inlet is, in fact, as later exploration has
proved, the largest of the many MOUTHS OF THE GILBERT RIVER.</p>
<p>Leaving Bold Point on 5th July, the "<i>Beagle</i>" reached BOUNTIFUL ISLAND
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> (16&deg; 41' S.; 139&deg; 55' E.), east of
Mornington Island, the following day. On 8th July, she dropped anchor in
INVESTIGATOR ROADS, between Sweers and Bentinck Islands. (SEE MAP M.) On the
latter were found the well sunk by Flinders and a tree branded "Investigator."
About a dozen NATIVES were observed under MOUNT INSPECTION, but they displayed
no hostility.</p>
<blockquote>[1) So named by Flinders on account of the abundance of
turtles.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 162}</u></p>
<p>Surveying and sounding in this neighbourhood occupied the time till 21st
July.</p>
<p>Two boats were sent out from Investigator Roads on 9th July, under
Lieutenants Forsyth and Parker. They returned on the 13th with the report that
they had passed to the south of Bentinck Island and landed at POINT BAILEY (SEE
MAP N), between which and the south end of Mornington Island were what were
named the FORSYTH ISLANDS. At POINT BAILEY (139&deg; 4' E.; 16&deg; 55' S.), a
native well was observed. Ten and a half miles to the south-east was POINT
PARKER, where, from a hillock 30 feet in height, there was a view of "a vast
level."</p>
<blockquote class="inline">[In 1881, Point Parker became "a name to conjure
with," as it, or some place near it, was designated as the northern terminus of
a "Transcontinental Railway" which, as an "all-Queensland" line, was to connect
the existing railway from Brisbane to Charleville with the Gulf of Carpentaria,
and thus shorten the line of communication between Australia and England. The
distinguishing feature of the undertaking was that, on the American model, the
interior of the country was to be settled along the railway on a land-grant
system, of which principle Sir Thomas McIlwraith's government approved. The
railway was to be constructed by a British syndicate and handed over to the
Government, the syndicate receiving as a consideration alternate blocks of land
on both sides of it. There seemed no reason why the settlement of a large
inland population should not have followed the realisation of such a scheme, as
was the experience of America.<br>
<br>
It was, however, too good an opportunity to be missed by the rising Labour
Party, and the Government fell, on a cry, raised by Sir Samuel Griffith and his
followers, of the danger involved in the "alienation of the people's
patrimony." The immediate construction by the new Government, on borrowed
money, of a railway to the Cloncurry copper-field was promised as an
alternative. It was not, however, till the end of 1907 that Cloncurry was
connected with Townsville by rail. The delay of twenty-six years deprived the
great majority of the pioneer discoverers of the copper-fields of the just
reward of their struggles; there was no population settled on "alternate
blocks"; and the Townsville railway does not answer the purpose of a
"transcontinental" line, as it adds, for the produce of the mines, the
circumnavigation of Australia to the distance from a European market.<br>
<br>
Major-General the Hon. William Feilding was in charge of the Transcontinental
Railway Expedition, and he traversed the country from Charleville to Point
Parker in what proved to be an exceptionally hot and dry summer, and was
consequently delayed beyond expectation. Acting under instructions from the
Colonial Treasurer of Queensland, I rode from Townsville to Cloncurry (558
miles), where I arrived on 20th September, 1881. General Feilding only arrived
on 7th October, so that I had already had an opportunity of inspecting a
portion of the mining district. After his arrival, while the main body of the
expedition toiled on in the direction of Point Parker, I accompanied him and
Ernest Henry, one of the leading pioneers, on excursions to outlying mining
properties, which, of course, still lay idle from the want of facilities for
transport. My reports were dated between 12th October, 1881, and 1st March,
1882. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> I parted with General Feilding on 9th
October, 1881, at Gregory Downs and, after spending some further time in the
mineral district, returned to Townsville by a <i>route</i> south of that by
which I had travelled to Cloncurry.<br>

<p>The "<i>Beagle</i>" left INVESTIGATOR ROADS on 21st July, and at the same
time Lieutenants Fitzmaurice and Pascoe set out in boats to examine a portion
of the mainland which it was unsafe for the ship to approach too closely. The
officers on the boats reported on 30th July to Captain Stokes (who by this time
had brought the ship to Flinders Inlet) the occurrence of a cape which was
called POINT TARRANT (139&deg; 31' E.; 17&deg; 24' S.), and, 2 miles west of
it, a "promising inlet," up which a boat was taken for about a league to the
south-west. (SEE MAP M.) Ten miles south-east of Point Tarrant was a "large
inlet," which was named the PASCOE INLET (17&deg; 30' S.). [It is now known to
be the mouth of the NICHOLSON RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.] Seven miles further in the
same direction was an "important inlet," afterwards named the ALBERT RIVER.</p>
<p>The "<i>Beagle</i>" herself, which had left Investigator Roads on 21st July,
anchored on the 24th off GORE POINT, on the mainland, where (in 139&deg; 56'
30" E.; 17&deg; 38' S.) a sand-hill rises to a height of 40 feet. Between the
sand-hill and a quoin-shaped <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> clump of
mangroves to the south-east, is an opening, which was explored in boats by
Stokes and Gore for 27 miles by the windings (9 miles direct, to
SW.-&frac12;-W.), up to "plains with open woodlands." It was named DISASTER
INLET, owing to a gun accident with injured the hand of Lieutenant Gore, who
was shooting at white cockatoos. A pedestrian excursion for 6 miles
S.-&frac12;-E. appears to have been devoid of interest or incident. There can
be little doubt that Disaster Inlet is a mouth of the LEICHHARDT RIVER.</p>
<p>On 26th July, the "<i>Beagle</i>" went eastward, approaching the low "head"
of the Gulf of Carpentaria as closely as the soundings permitted (about 13
geographical miles off), to MIDDLE POINT (140&deg; 12' E.), 2 miles east of
which is MORNING INLET.</p>
<p>On 28th July, the ship anchored in about 140&deg; 35' E.; 17&deg; 35' S.,
off the mouth of a large inlet, which was named the FLINDERS RIVER (which I
believe to be Tasman's CARON REVIER), and which was explored southward in a
boat on the 29th and the morning of the 30th to 17&deg; 51&frac12;' S. Here the
river split up into two branches, one of which came from the east and the other
from the south. The former is now regarded as the "main" channel of the
FLINDERS RIVER, and, in fact, joins, or rather "leaves," the "BYNOE" MOUTH of
the river; while the latter is known as" ARMSTRONG CREEK. The reach below
(north of) the conjoined Armstrong and Flinders was named Burial Reach, because
an unburied aboriginal corpse was observed exposed in the fork of a tree.</p>
<blockquote>[1) A quoin is the wedge which used to be placed below the breech
of a cannon to give the desired elevation.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 164}</u></p>
<p>In the afternoon of the 30th, Captain Stokes, accompanied by Lieutenant Gore
and Messrs. Forsyth and Dring, took a boat back to the west to the "important
inlet" noted by Fitzmaurice and Pascoe on 21st July. They followed it to the
south-west for about 40 miles as the crow flies, and more than 50 by the
windings, until the water had become quite fresh and the country had opened up
into the "PLAINS of PROMISE" <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> (1st August). It
was named the ALBERT River. At Stokes' "furthest south" (17&deg; 58&frac12;'),
he was, in fact, nearing the southern limit of the coastal plain in which the
mouths of the NICHOLSON, GREGORY and LEICHHARDT RIVERS anastomose. The party
returned to the ship on 6th August. Stokes indulged in speculations on the
facilities for INLAND EXPLORATION afforded by the landing at the Albert,
opening up into country of the most inviting character. They were wise words,
and if they had come under the eye of Kennedy I might have averted the
disasters which overtook that unfortunate explorer in 1848.</p>
<p>Up the ALBERT RIVER, about half-way to Stokes' furthest point, now stands
the town of BURKETOWN, which serves as the port for a large pastorally occupied
area, as well as for the northern portion of the continuous mineral district
extending from the heads of the Burke and Wills Creeks (21&deg; 30' S.),
through CLONCURRY COPPERFIELDS and the LAWN HILL SILVER-LEAD MINES.</p>
<p>While Captain Stokes was occupied as above mentioned, Lieutenant Fitzmaurice
had been engaged in examining the coast of the Gulf between the mouth of the
Flinders River and what was known to him as the Van Diemen Inlet of Tasman. Ten
miles from the Flinders, he found the BYNOE INLET (Tasman's VAN DER LIJN
REVIER), another mouth of the same river. Seven miles further, there was
another, which he did not name, in reality Tasman's VAN DIEMEN REVIER, but now
known as the NORMAN RIVER, on which stands NORMANTON, the sea outlet for a
large pastoral country and the terminus of the railway to the CROYDON
GOLDFIELD. From this inlet, the coast-line begins to trend only a few degrees
to the east of north, and it continues so for 25 miles to the wrongly named Van
Diemen Inlet (16&deg; 58' S.). North of this, the coast-line trends
north-north-east to the 16th parallel.</p>
<p>Thirteen miles south of the supposed Van Diemen Inlet (Smithburn River, a
mouth of the Gilbert), "an opening of some magnitude" was observed (17&deg; 11'
S.), with ponds of fresh water on its southern side. Two and 4 miles south of
it were smaller openings (marked in the modern chart in 17&deg; 13' and 17&deg;
15&frac12; S.). The "opening of some magnitude" was named ACCIDENT INLET
because "Mr. Fitzgerald had been seriously wounded in the ankle by the
discharge of a gun, which had gone off within a few yards of it." He was, in
fact, maimed for life.</p>
<blockquote>[1) This country is now all occupied as pastoral holdings: the part
reached by the explorers is now Alice Vale No. 5 block on Bustard Plains
run.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 165}</u></p>
<p>ACCIDENT INLET is the outlet of CROOKED CREEK, one of the mouths of the
GILBERT RIVER, and there is every reason to believe it to be the STATEN REVIER,
the "<i>Pera's</i>" boat's "furthest south" in the year 1623. Another opening
was noted in 17&deg; 4' S., and this is marked in modern charts "Southern Mouth
of Gilbert R." It is certainly a mouth of the Gilbert, but Accident Inlet,
which is another, is further south. This so-called "Southern Mouth" is named
the SMITHBURN RIVER in the maps of the Lands Department. (SEE MAPS H, F, D, B
and A.)</p>
<p>From the Smithburn mouth of the Gilbert River, after the wounded Lieutenant
had been taken on board, the "<i>Beagle</i>" ran along the western coast of the
Cape York Peninsula to BOOBY ISLAND. In passing, a cursory examination was made
of the NORTH WALLIS ISLAND (now RED WALLIS ISLAND), which is described as a
conical hill of coarse sandstone, 70 feet in height modern charts say 60. A
"grave" was seen, containing several skeletons covered with turtle-shells.</p>
<p>BOOBY ISLAND was left on 17th August, 1841. CAPE WESSEL was passed on the
18th, and PORT ESSINGTON was reached on the 20th. KOEPANG (TIMOR) was visited.
Touching at the SWAN RIVER and ADELAIDE, the "<i>Beagle</i>" returned to SYDNEY
on 15th March, 1842. After a visit to Tasmania, she arrived in England on 30th
September, 1842.</p>
<p>It is greatly to be regretted that Stokes accepted, without hesitation or
investigation, Flinders' erroneous identifications of several of the "reviers,"
or inlets, named by the early Dutch navigators. In the case of Flinders, as we
have already seen, the errors into which he fell were very pardonable, as he
had not seen Carstenszoon's Journal of the voyage of the "<i>Pera</i>" (1623)
and was only acquainted with the chart of Tasman's voyage of 1644 through the
medium of Thevenot's by no means careful reduction. Tasman's chart, in fact,
only became available through Jacob Swart's reproduction in 1860. We have to
remind ourselves that Flinders, although permitting himself to make guesses as
to the identity of Carstenszoon's and Tasman's inlets, modestly omitted the
names from his own chart. It would have been well if Stokes had imitated
Flinders' caution, since he, no more than Flinders, could have seen Swart's
version of Tasman's chart, and he was equally unacquainted with Carstenszoon's
"<i>Pera</i>" journal which was first published by Van Dijk in 1859. The
acceptance by Stokes as <i>facts</i> of what Flinders merely put forth as
<i>conjectures</i> gave official authority for a number of errors which must
for all time disfigure the maps, to the detriment of historical accuracy.</p>
<p>Taking the various inlets in their order from south to north, the
corrections which should be made, but which have been rendered impossible by
long official and private usage, may be traced, so as to distinguish between
<i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> names.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 166}</u></p>
<p>1. The FLINDERS RIVER, first named by Stokes, may be accepted as a safe
starting-point.</p>
<p>2. The BYNOE INLET, so named by Stokes, is another mouth of the Flinders,
but it had already been named by Tasman VAN DER LIJN'S REVIER.</p>
<p>3. The NORMAN RIVER, to which Stokes alluded only as "another inlet," and to
which he attached so little importance that he gave it no name, and which
Flinders had erroneously conjectured to be Tasman's CARON REVIER, is Tasman's
VAN DIEMEN REVIER. (The name of Van Diemen Revier is erroneously applied in
modern charts to a mouth of the GILBERT RIVER in 16&deg; 58' S.)</p>
<p>4. Stokes' ACCIDENT INLET (a mouth of the GILBERT RIVER, continued inland as
CROOKED CREEK) was the "furthest south" of the "<i>Pera</i>" and
"<i>Aernem</i>" expedition in 1623 and was named the STATEN REVIER by
Carstenszoon, who was on board the "<i>Pera</i>" and in command of the
expedition.</p>
<p>5. The Smithburn River, or SMITHBURN MOUTH OF THE GILBERT, was fortunately
not named by Stokes, who merely refers to it as an "opening." (The modern
chart, corrected to 1896, calls it "Southern Mouth of Gilbert River," although
Accident Inlet, another mouth, is still further south.)</p>
<p>For the reason that many of the names of the officers have been conferred on
capes, islands and other geographical features of Torres Strait, the Gulf of
Carpentaria and the neighbourhood of Cape York, the full list of the

<h4>NORMANTON AND THE NORMAN RIVER</h4>
<h5>(SEE MAP M.)</h5>
<p>In consequence of the disastrous issue of the Burke and Wills expedition,
parties set out in different directions, in the year 1861, in search of traces
or survivors, and two of these, Landsborough's and Frederick Walker's, reached
the base of the Cape York Peninsula. Both parties had been carried north by the
200-ton brig "<i>Firefly</i>" (Captain Kirby). Walker's debarked at Rockhampton
and Landsborough's at the Albert River. LANDSBOROUGH established a dep&ocirc;t
20 miles up the river and commenced his land travelling on 17th October, 1861.
He ran the ALBERT (SEE MAPS N AND R) up to its head, either by the Gregory or
O'Shanassy branch, crossed the BARKLY TABLELAND and followed down the Herbert
(now GEORGINA) RIVER southward to 20&deg; S., i.e., to about the site of
CAMOWEAL township, when the hostility of the natives compelled him to retrace
his steps to his dep&ocirc;t on the Albert River, which he regained on 7th
December, to find that Walker had already been there. WALKER had gone westward
from Rockhampton to the Barcoo River in long. 146&deg; E. and lat. 24&deg; S.,
and from this point had shaped his course to the north-west, running down the
river which was afterwards called the NORMAN, and crossing the Flinders to the
Albert. He had left the dep&ocirc;t on his return journey before Landsborough's
arrival. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>By the end of 1869, the northward march of pastoral occupation had brought
it to the southern shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, BURKETOWN had been
established as a township on the Albert, and a custom house on SWEERS ISLAND
was supposed to meet the requirements of the Gulf and Straits. A small steamer
named the "<i>Back Diamond</i>" (Captain Norman) left Sweers Island in
February, 1870, and landed 200 tons of cargo at the point where the NORMANTON
custom house now stands. The new township and the river itself were named in
honour of Captain Norman.<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> Normanton is now the
port for a considerable area of pastoral country, as well as for the Croydon
goldfield, with which it is connected by a</p>

<p>railway. The railway which links Cairns with the Etheridge goldfield will
probably in the future be joined with that from Croydon to Normanton. The
ultimate northern, or Gulf, terminus of the
Townsville-Hughenden-Cloncurry-Mount Cuthbert railway will probably be at
Burketown rather than at Normanton, as not only is the distance less (Burketown
152, Normanton 184 miles), but the tendency will be to keep the line as far as
possible on the high and mineralised country extending through Mount Oxide and
Lawn Hills.</p>
<p>I have already pointed out, when dealing with Flinders' conjectural
identifications, that the "small opening in 17&deg; 26' S." (17&deg; 28' S.,
really), which he thought might be Tasman's Caron Revier, was much more likely
to have been what Tasman named the Van Diemen Revier, and that this VAN DIEMEN
INLET is the mouth of the modern NORMAN RIVER.</p>

<p>This admirably planned and equipped expedition left Toulon on 7th September,
1837, and returned to that port on 6th November, 1840. Its brilliant
achievements and scientific reports <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> form a
valuable and permanent addition to the world's knowledge of south polar as well
as of tropical regions. As usual, however, we confine ourselves to that portion
of the work bearing on the region dealt with in this book.</p>
<p>The two vessels of the expedition, coming from New Zealand, sailed westward,
to the north of the PORTLOCK REEFS and ANCHOR CAY, and dropped anchor in
Treacherous Bay, DARNLEY ISLAND, on 31st May, 1840. (SEE MAP A.) A boat was
sent ashore, and the NATIVES greeted their visitors with waving palm branches.
They endeavoured to entice the sailors to accompany them inland, using women as
decoys. This invitation having been declined, they displayed a desire for iron
articles of all kinds, but indicated a preference for axes. They had, however,
no eatables to offer in exchange, and would not take the hint when palm trees
bearing fine coco-nuts were pointed out to them. When, after what the Surgeon
called "an agreeable hour" had been spent ashore, and the visiting party turned
back on the sound of the recall from the flagship, the natives were so friendly
as to <i>carry</i> them to the boat and to repeat the word "to-morrow" again
and again.</p>
<p>In 1886, the Hon. John Douglas described Darnley Island <b style=

<p>estimated at 300, besides fifty South Sea Islanders and three or four
Europeans. Further evidences of progress were a police station and a mission
station, with plantations of bananas, coco-nuts, sweet potatoes and
bamboos.</p>
<p>On 1st June, the voyage was resumed, and the vessels passed STEPHENS' and
DALRYMPLE ISLANDS, and made for the south end of the WARRIOR REEF. "On the
right," says the Admiral, "was the Grand Reef, off which is the little WARRIOR
ISLAND, called TOUD <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> by the natives. I wished
to anchor behind this little island and establish our second stage. I kept
close to the reef on the starboard side, confident that it was completely
charted. The blacks of Toud Island ran out on the reefs to watch us." The
Surgeon puts it more elegantly: "We entered a calm channel, bordered with
islets which looked like oases on the surface of the blue sea. There were shady
dwellings beneath clumps of vegetation and coco-nut groves. The natives ran out
on the reefs to see us pass and invited us to approach. We sailed confidently,
being provided with the carefully constructed charts of the scientific
King...But here are two passages, one wide, free and open, and the other
narrow, tortuous and bristling with reefs. The "<i>Astrolabe</i>" takes this
one. There are shoals ahead..."</p>
<p>Both vessels GROUNDED in the narrow channel, on which the name of CANAL
MAUVAIS was appropriately bestowed. They were, in fact, on the wrong side of
Warrior Island. The channel on the south side, which Moresby named BASILISK
PASS in 1871, had already been used by BLIGH (" <i>Providence</i>"and
"<i>Assistant</i>") in 1792 and by BAMPTON and ALT ("<i>Hormuzeer</i>" and
"<i>Chesterfield</i>") in 1793.</p>
<p>The ships, which had, unfortunately, grounded at high water, were very
seriously&mdash;it seemed for a time hopelessly&mdash;in danger, and there was
something maddening in the thought that the brave ships which had triumphantly
come through the storms of the southern seas were cast away on a mud-bank in
good daylight and fine weather, while the crews would have to make their way in
boats to Timor. But by dint of superhuman exertions the ships were at last
floated, the "<i>Z&egrave;l&eacute;e</i>" on the 2nd and the "<i>Astrolabe</i>"
on the 4th June. Naturally, they had sustained considerable damage; and, while
the necessary repairs were being effected, the way out of the passage was
carefully surveyed and sounded.</p>
<p>The NATIVES of the island were considered to be of New Guinea origin, as by
their hair, their habits, and especially their custom of tattooing, they
recalled the Papuans. They were entirely distinct from the Australian
aborigines, and much more industrious and enterprising. They possessed about
thirty very fine carved canoes or dugouts, and fishing was their daily
avocation. Near the south end of the island were about a dozen huts. As there
was no fresh</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 171}</u></p>
<p>water, the natives had a system of collecting it in large clam-shells placed
so as to catch the drip from pandanus trees when showers fell. Their weapons
were of Papuan type, bows and arrows, and spears barbed with iron, and they had
also iron hatchets. Their vocabulary included a few English words, and the
conclusion was inevitable that they must have enjoyed frequent opportunities of
intercourse with the English. A heap of bones and skulls of the dugong,
observed at the north end of the island, was believed to be a dep&ocirc;t to be
drawn upon, as required, for the decoration of graves.</p>
<p>On 8th and 9th June, the ships, piloted by the boats which had been engaged
in sounding, cleared the CANAL MAUVAIS. In the morning of 10th June, GUEBORAR
(GABBA, or "THE BROTHERS") ISLAND was passed on the north, and, says D'Urville,
"served as a guide-post towards BLIGH'S EXIT: then we saw the high summits of
BANKS, MULGRAVE and JERVIS ISLANDS." In the afternoon, PASSAGE ISLAND (which
marks the entrance to Napoleon Passage) was left behind and the anchor was
dropped south of the JERVIS REEF, which stretches east and west between Jervis
and Mulgrave Islands. The next day was spent in soundings to assure a safe
passage through BLIGH CHANNEL. The passage of the channel was made on 12th
June, and a week later TIMOR was in sight. BLIGH took the "<i>Providence</i>"
and "<i>Assistant</i>" through the channel which bears his name in 1792, and
there is every reason to believe that he had been anticipated by TORRES in
1606.</p>
<p>Jervis Island was named by Bligh in 1792 and surveyed by Moresby in the
"<i>Basilisk</i>" in 1873, but I have been unable to ascertain who discovered
the channel now charted as "NAPOLEON PASSAGE (1859)," a few miles north of
Bligh Passage and between Jervis Island and Jervis Reef. The name suggests a
French explorer, while the "HAMELIN BOULDERS" in the middle of the passage are
reminiscent of Captain Hamelin, of the "<i>Naturaliste</i>" whom Flinders met
in Sydney in 1802. Captain James H. Watson informs me that he has seen a
reference in the <i>Shipping Gazette</i> to the passage (apparently by the
Prince of Wales Channel) through Torres Strait of a British ship called the
"<i>Napoleon III</i>" in July, 1856. It is quite possible that the same vessel
may have revisited the Strait three years later and discovered a new passage,
but I have failed to find any record of the occurrence.</p>

<p>Her Majesty's Ship "<i>Fly</i>," under command of CAPTAIN F. P. BLACKWOOD
(Sailing Master, F. J. Evans; Mate, D. Aird), was commissioned by the Admiralty
to continue the SURVEYING WORK on the coast of Australia which had been
commenced by FLINDERS and carried on by KING, WICKHAM</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 173}</u></p>
<p>and STOKES. She was accompanied by the tender "<i>Bramble</i>" LIEUTENANT C.
B. YULE, and the pinnace, which was named the "<i>Midge</i>" did useful service
in the minutiae of the surveying operations. Blackwood devoted himself heart
and soul to the work, but he was a parsimonious writer. He has left us a short
"Abstract of the Voyage," <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> which is little more
than an itinerary, and incomplete at that. The Admiralty charts, as revised and
corrected by him, and his "Chart of Endeavour Strait," and Notes in "Sailing
Directions," a were apparently his only published contributions to the
hydrography of Torres Strait. Fortunately, there was, among the scientific
staff, a naturalist, J. BEETE JUKES, whose account of the voyage not only took
its place at once as a geological classic, but abounded in that human interest
which gives to a book of travel a permanent value apart from its geographical
and scientific <i>data</i>. It is to this work, <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> therefore, that we must turn for the greater number of
the incidents and observations which made the voyages of the "<i>Fly</i>"
memorable. Jukes joined the Geological Survey of Great Britain on his return
from Australia, and was subsequently appointed Director of theGeological Survey
of Ireland and Professor of Geology in the University of Dublin.</p>
<h5>#1. FIRST VOYAGE FROM SYDNEY AND CRUISE IN TORRES STRAIT, 1843</h5>
<h5>(SEE MAP K.)</h5>
<p>Between 19th May and 1st June, 1843, the "<i>Fly</i>" and "<i>Bramble</i>"
lay in ROCKINGHAM BAY, off GOULD ISLAND. The passage between "MOUNT
HINCHINBROOK" and the mainland, which had been "suspected" by King, was
explored by Lieutenant Shadwell, Mr. Porcher and Jukes.</p>
<p>On the mainland, Blackwood explored "a fresh-water stream of considerable
size," in the north-western portion of Rockingham Bay, probably the TULLY
RIVER. Two others, traced by Lieutenant Ince, Mr. Pym and Jukes, through
jungles till they became streamlets of no importance, were probably DALLACHY
and WRECK CREEKS.</p>
<p>The NATIVES of Gould Island commenced by being very friendly, and soon fell
into the habit of paddling up to the ships for long talks, punctuated by the
occasional receipt of trifling presents. Such</p>

<p>confidence did they inspire that boats' crews would sometimes "neglect" to
take their firearms when they went ashore. On 31st May, one crew netted a good
haul of fish, which they shared with the natives. Greatly to their surprise,
they were assailed shortly afterwards with SPEARS AND STONES. Mr. Weekes, the
boatswain, was struck by a stone, which laid him off duty for a week. One of
the men happened to have an uncharged fowling-piece, and after some search a
ball was found on the bottom of the boat, and with this one of the foremost of
the blacks was wounded, whereupon the attack was abandoned.</p>
<p>On another occasion, Jukes, Ince and Pym, when on a creek on the north side
of Rockingham Bay, were STONED by some forty or fifty blacks, and replied with
small shot. One of the blacks was slightly wounded.</p>
<p>On 4th June, Jukes and others landed in ENDEAVOUR HARBOUR, but found no
trace of the visit of Captain Cook, nor even of Captain King. (SEE MAP E.)</p>
<p>On 5th June, Jukes, with Evans and others, climbed the hill on LIZARD ISLAND
to make barometrical observations. They camped on the summit for the night and
took a series of bearings in the morning. They made the altitude nearly 1,200
feet. While they descended, a party of NATIVES, five men and some women and
children, were seen below them. After they joined the ship, the voyage to the
north was resumed.</p>
<p>From 7th to 17th June, the "<i>Fly</i>" was engaged in surveying the outer
edge of the BARRIER REEF between Lizard Island and Cape Melville.</p>
<p>On 17th June, Blackwood, Mackay and Jukes landed 2 miles south of CAPE
MELVILLE and Jukes observed that the formation was granite. Some NATIVES
approached, and after mutual laying down of arms, guided the visitors to water.
At sunset, the latter boarded the boat which was waiting for them. They then
discharged their guns into the sea&mdash;with what object does not appear,
unless they meant to "impress" the natives, who were observing them from some
cliffs about 200 yards distant. It may be conjectured that the natives took
this to mean that, having "shot their bolt," the visitors were at their mercy.
At all events, the stowing away of the guns in the lockers was the signal for
the discharge of two SPEARS, which fell close to the boat. The arms were got
out again, and Jukes, having loaded one barrel with ball and the other with
shot, fired at trees in the vicinity of the blacks, alarming the blacks
sufficiently to put them to flight. A confiscated spear was found to be barbed
with an iron nail and two sting-ray spines.</p>
<p>For some time after this incident, the "<i>Fly</i>" was "in and out" of the
BARRIER REEF near Cape Melville. Jukes himself was not on board, and Blackwood
is silent, but the expression "in and out" may be taken to mean that the inner
passage and the landward side</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 175}</u></p>
<p>of the Barrier Reef, from the PIPON ISLANDS and MELANIE ROCK south-westward,
were surveyed on this occasion.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Yule was dispatched with the "<i>Bramble</i>" from Cape Melville,
to measure the difference in latitude between that cape and CAPE DIRECTION, and
Jukes was a passenger. Evidently the "<i>Bramble</i>" took the passage inside
the reef, as NIGHT ISLAND is mentioned as having been seen before CAPE
DIRECTION was reached on 24th June. (SEE MAP C.) At daybreak on the 25th, two
NATIVES were observed near the anchorage fishing from a large outrigger-dugout.
Following on a brief parley, some amicable bartering of spears, etc., for
bottles, biscuits and ribbons took place. After breakfast, two boats were rowed
ashore with a party comprising Lieutenant Yule, Dr. McLatchie, Messrs. Pollard
and Sweatman, Jukes and nine seamen. The landing-place was probably near VILLIS
POINT, where Bligh had landed in 1789 from the "<i>Bounty's</i>" launch. A few
men were left in the boats, and the rest of the party ascended MOUNT DIRECTION,
where they made a series of observations. The hill was of granite and 490 feet
high. The two blacks who had been fishing reached the hill-top shortly after
the whites, and were presently joined by a third. To keep them in good humour
and prevent them disturbing Yule and the observing party, Jukes and McLatchie
engaged their attention by dancing and "daffing." When the serious business was
finished and the descent had begun, the blacks shouted and signalled to others
below, who replied, and the whites began to suspect that they were being
betrayed into an ambush. The suspicion was justified when they reached the
bottom of the hill and made for the boats, and a crowd of natives concealed in
the bushes assailed their flank and rear with a flight of SPEARS. Yule, at this
time, was limping painfully in the rear (being crippled with rheumatism), and
was followed by a sailor named Bayley, who carried the artificial-horizon box.
Jukes happened to look back just in time to see a tall savage discharge a spear
from a wimmera and transfix BAYLEY, who DIED of the wound three days later. The
<i>post mortem</i> showed that the spear had passed from behind between the
heads of two ribs and the spine, splintering the bones, and then penetrated the
left lobe of the lungs all but an eighth of an inch. The spear was barbed with
a three-inch bone, wrought to an acute spindle-shape, and this barb remained in
the body when the spear was withdrawn.</p>
<p>Some random shooting into the scrub followed this act of treachery, but no
good could be done, and it would have been mere folly to follow the natives
into the jungle.</p>
<p>The "<i>Bramble</i>" which had left the "<i>Fly</i>" at Cape Melville about
a week before the end of June, rejoined her in Wreck Bay (143&deg; 50' E.;
12&deg; 10' S.). (ADMIRALTY CHART, No. 2920.)</p>
<p>There is nothing in the narratives of Jukes or Blackwell to</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 176}</u></p>
<p>indicate the <i>route</i> taken by either the "<i>Fly</i>" from Cape
Melville or the "<i>Bramble</i>" from Cape Direction. It may be considered the
most probable conjecture that both ships got outside of the Barrier Reef, the
"<i>Fly</i>" by the MELVILLE PASSAGE, due north of Cape Melville (4-mile Sheet
20C), and the "<i>Bramble</i>" by "BLIGH'S BOAT ENTRANCE" (15&deg; 52' S.),
east of Cape Direction. In Wreck Bay, which is an indentation in the outer edge
of the Barrier Reef, there were seen (between 26th June and 12th July), the
WRECKS of the "<i>Ferguson</i>" (1840) and "<i>Martha Ridgway</i>" (1841).
Three vessels were met on their way to pass through Torres Strait. Two of
these, the "<i>Winscales</i>" and the "<i>John Wrenwick</i>" carried sheep,
potatoes and ale, and a bargain was made for fresh provisions, which were badly
needed, SCURVY having broken out on board; and it may be added, the fresh food
acted like a charm. (SEE SHEET B AND ADMIRALTY CHART, No. 2920.)</p>
<p>From Wreck Bay, and probably by the line of soundings shown on the chart
extending north-westward from the MARTHA RIDGWAY REEF, the flotilla made for
the SIR CHARLES HARDY ISLANDS, which were visited on 12th July. (SEE MAP B.)
Jukes describes them as composed of a brown siliceous rock, like a flinty slate
passing into porphyry, the northmost island rising to 280 feet (modern charts
give 320 feet). Thence the <i>route</i> lay by the POLLARD CHANNEL, south of
the COCKBURN REEF.</p>
<p>Jukes and Aird, in the "<i>Midge</i>" arrived at CAPE GRENVILLE on 18th July
and ascended the eminence which modern charts name HIGHGATE HILL (249 feet.
Jukes gives it as 400). The rock was of the same character as that of the Sir
Charles Hardy Islands, and the view comprised a "barren sandy country with low,
scrub covered hills." In fact, this was the dreary stretch of scrubby
sand-dunes through which the MACMILLAN RIVER finds its way into MARGARET
BAY.</p>
<p>Probably the "<i>Fly</i>" and her consorts next rounded COCKBURN REEF and
surveyed the eastward "course recommended" of the charts, by the "NORTH
CHANNEL" to Raine Island. (ADMIRALTY CHART, No. 2354.)</p>
<p>RAINE ISLAND was visited on 29th July, and Blackwood and Jukes spent the
night on it. It is described as an oval rim of coral, enclosing a sandbank
which rises a few feet above the sea. As a breeding-place for birds it can have
few rivals. It was hardly possible to walk or lie down without stepping on a
bird or an egg. "The whole island," says Jukes, "stank like a foul hen-roost,
and we were covered with bird-lice and ticks. After sleeping in the sand, we
dined upon young boobies and frigate-birds' and terns' eggs."</p>
<p>On 1st August, the ships anchored in PANDORA ENTRANCE (where the
"<i>Pandora</i>" was wrecked in 1791). On the 3rd, 4th and 5th, they skirted
the outside of the BARRIER REEF to the northward.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 177 }</u></p>
<p>On the 5th, they entered the reef by a small opening in 10&deg; 1' S., and
reached MURRAY ISLAND the same day. (SEE MAP A.) The highest point of the large
island was estimated at 700 feet (modern charts make it 750). Many huts were
observed and the INHABITANTS were numerous and eager to trade. In fact, they
were so numerous and so hearty in their manners, when Blackwood landed on the
6th, accompanied by Jukes and Melville (artist) and exchanged iron for
coco-nuts, turtle-shell and bows and arrows, that he feared his men might be
hustled, with an undesirable collision as the probable result. Jukes observed
that the whole of the lower portion of the island, and even a good part of the
hill slopes, were covered with a continuous plantation of COCO-NUTS.</p>
<p>Murray Island was left behind on the 7th, and the survey was extended to
MOUNT ADOLPHUS ISLAND (11th). Jukes climbed Mount Adolphus (518 feet) and
observed that this and the whole of the York Islands (meaning, apparently,
Mount Adolphus and the smaller islands in the vicinity) were composed of
porphyry.</p>
<p>On 14th August, 1843, the ships passed north of WEDNESDAY ISLAND and hove to
off BOOBY ISLAND for a visit to the "POST OFFICE." The log-book and a bag of
beef and some biscuits were observed. The "<i>Fly</i>" then sailed to PORT
ESSINGTON, TIMOR, the SWAN RIVER and TASMANIA.</p>
<h5>#2. SECOND VOYAGE FROM SYDNEY AND CRUISE IN TORRES STRAIT, 1844-5</h5>
<p>The "<i>Fly</i>" left Sydney on 22nd March, 1844, accompanied by the
"<i>Bramble</i>" (Lieutenant Yule) and a small revenue cutter named the
"<i>Prince George</i>" and sailed direct to RAINE ISLAND, where a party under
command of LIEUTENANT INGE landed on 27th May. (ADMIRALTY CHART, No. 2354.)
Their primary business was the erection of a BEACON on the island to mark what
was believed to be a safe passage through the Barrier Reef for ships coming
from the east. A tank and some necessary timber were obtained from the wreck of
the "<i>Martha Ridgway</i>," but other building material had to be cut or
quarried from various islands or the mainland. The work was not completed until
the middle of September.</p>
<p>As there was no anchorage close to Raine Island, the "<i>Fly</i>" lay about
twelve miles to the south-west, under the shelter of the "GREAT DETACHED REEF,"
while the smaller vessels were fetching and carrying for the party camped on
the site of the beacon. The "<i>Fly</i>" herself had to keep in touch with, and
serve as a base for, the party operating on the island, but she managed, with
the assistance of the "<i>Prince George</i>" to put in a good deal of surveying
and sounding between Raine Island and Endeavour Strait. From 8th August to 25th
September, the "<i>Bramble</i>" (Lieutenant Yule)</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 178}</u></p>
<p>was surveying ENDEAVOUR STRAIT.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> (SEE MAP A.)
On 21st September, the "<i>Fly</i>" left Endeavour Strait for PORT ESSINGTON
and SOURABAYA, Java, where she arrived on 19th October, 1844, to be joined,
shortly afterwards, by the "<i>Bramble</i>" and "<i>Prince George</i>"</p>
<p>The "<i>Fly</i>" and "<i>Bramble</i>" returned to TORRES STRAIT on 10th
February, 1845. At BOOBY ISLAND, they left provisions for possible future
shipwrecked people&mdash;fortunately for themselves, as it turned out. They
were engaged up to 19th April in surveying the central and north-eastern parts
of Torres Strait. During this time they laid down the "track recommended" from
the north-eastern end of the Barrier Reef to Endeavour Strait. Lieutenant
(afterwards Commander) Shadwell, of the "<i>Fly</i>" made a series of
magnetical observations. SHADWELL POINT, near Somerset, was named after him.
Yule, in the "<i>Bramble</i>" surveyed the passage between the mainland and
ALBANY ISLAND and named it PORT ALBANY. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<p>From 28th March to 1st April, the ships lay off the west side of DARNLEY or
ERROOB ISLAND, and the officers and men spent a good part of the time on shore.
They sedulously cultivated a good understanding with the NATIVES, and came to
regard some of them as personal friends. Among these were two individuals named
MAMMOOS and SEEWAI, who were leaders rather by virtue of their strength of
character than by right of any hereditary or electoral chieftainship. It was
observed by Jukes that TOBACCO was cultivated and smoked, and he puzzled
himself over the question of whether the plant and the custom had been
introduced by early Portuguese, Spanish or Dutch visitors. He saw carved wooden
figures, and was of opinion that they had no religious significance, but
represented the filling up of idle time, or perhaps the instinctive expression
of artistic feeling. The barter of iron articles, chiefly axes and knives, for
coco-nuts and turtle-shell went on briskly. Jukes made the observation that
DARNLEY and MURRAY ISLANDS were of VOLCANIC origin, while the islands extending
from Cape YORK to MOUNT CORNWALLIS were composed of granite or old metamorphic
rocks. Dr. Muirhead and Lieutenant Risk <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> were
among the persons who landed on Darnley Island.</p>
<p>On 11th April, the ships anchored off MURRAY ISLAND and the NATIVES gave
Blackwood and Jukes a hospitable and even effusive welcome. During the whole of
their stay (till 15th April), the most friendly relations were maintained
between the islanders and the ships' companies. Bartering was carried on with
zest, the islanders frequently visiting the ships in their canoes. It was
noted</p>
<blockquote>[1) I gather the impression that Blackwood intended to apply the
name "Endeavour Strait" to the whole of Torres Strait.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) <i>MacGillivray's Voyage of the "Rattlesnake,"</i> 1, 132.

<blockquote>[3) RISK POINT, on the mainland, opposite the Hannibal Islands was
probably named after him.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 179}</u></p>
<p>that the shore was lined with a continuous row of huts, each enclosed in a
courtyard of ten to twenty yards square, fenced with bamboo. The interiors were
neat and clean. The natural products most in request were yams, plantains and
coco-nuts, which seemed to be parted with reluctantly; on the other hand, the
market was, perhaps, overstocked with bows and arrows. Many of the houses
contained SKULLS, on which the tenants did not appear to set much value. One
skull was sold for a fig of tobacco.</p>
<p>Blackwood and Jukes visited the smaller islands of the group, DOWAR and
WYER, in the "<i>Midge</i>" DARNLEY ISLAND is composed of a lava-form
hornblendic trap rock, with volcanic sandstone and conglomerate. WYER and DOWAR
are composed of volcanic sandstone and conglomerate, dipping at high angles
quaquaversally, i.e., from the centre towards the circumference of the islands.
There is an igneous rock also in the centre of the coral ring known as BRAMBLE
CAY.</p>
<p>On 19th April, Lieutenant Yule left with the "<i>Bramble</i>" for Sydney,
against the prevailing wind of the season. She was successful, although Jukes
remarks that the feat had only twice been attempted before, first in the
"<i>Zenobia</i>" by Captain Lihou,<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and second
by Captain McKenzie in the "<i>Heroine</i>" (1845). On this southward voyage,
the "<i>Bramble</i>" surveyed the outside of the BARRIER REEF from Lizard
Island to 16&deg; 40' S. (south of TRINITY OPENING). (SEE MAPS E AND G AND
ADMIRALTY CHART No. 2759A.)</p>
<p>The "<i>Fly</i>" and "<i>Prince George</i>" finally left Murray Island for
New Guinea on 21st April. (SEE MAP A.) On the 25th, they anchored off the
WARRIOR REEF, the eastern outline of which had already been surveyed by the
"<i>Bramble</i>." Thence they made northward for BRISTOW ISLAND and the
adjacent portion of the NEW GUINEA coast, into which the FLY RIVER discharges
its waters. The sea-water was found to be barely salt 10 miles out from the
shore.</p>
<p>Blackwood and Ince explored, with the "<i>Fly's</i>" gig (29th April to 1st
May), the FLY RIVER, which was 5 miles wide at its mouth. They found a depth of
4 fathoms, and the water quite drinkable. They were not, however, allowed to go
far without opposition. A landing had been made on the north, or left, bank of
the river, when something like 500 men rushed at them from the woods, and they
retreated. They were no sooner in the boat than a hot pursuit was commenced by
four WAR CANOES, each containing forty men. At nightfall the party in the gig
shook off their pursuers, and at midnight they reached the "<i>Prince
George</i>"and safety.</p>
<p>The water was too shallow for the "<i>Fly</i>" and "<i>Prince George</i>"and
on 2nd May it was planned to outline the coast with the</p>
<blockquote>[1) After whom is named PORT LIHOU, Prince of Wales Island
(Admiralty Chart. No. 2354).]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 180}</u></p>
<p>"<i>Midge</i>," under Mr. Pym, and the second gig, under Mr. Harvey. Mr.
Millery is also mentioned as being in the gig as a volunteer. Besides those
named, there were twelve seamen. Dirty weather set in and the boats and ships
lost sight of one another. Captain Blackwood's plans were upset and an earnest
search for the boats took the place of the projected survey.</p>
<p>On 6th May, the "<i>Fly</i>" anchored at BRAMBLE CAY, and on 6th and 7th she
sailed northward towards AIRD'S HILL.</p>
<p>No trace of the MISSING BOATS having rewarded the search, it was resolved to
return to DARNLEY ISLAND and enlist the services of some of the friendly
natives, to "explain" matters to the New Guineans, and accordingly the anchor
was dropped in TREACHEROUS BAY on 24th May.</p>
<p>The island (which Jukes estimated to contain no more than 100 men of
military age) was in a ferment, and something like civil war was in progress.
When, after a time, the position began to get clearer to Blackwood and Jukes,
the trouble appeared to resolve itself into a trial of strength between Mammoos
and Seewai and their respective partisans&mdash;a sort of tournament, in fact.
The islanders had seen and heard nothing of the missing boats, and had no time
for other people's affairs, and so turned deaf ears to the proposal that either
leader should withdraw himself from the business in hand. Specifically and
emphatically did they object to visit "DOWDEE" (their name for the nearest
portion of New Guinea), whose people they feared and hated.</p>
<p>In such a condition of affairs, the atmosphere is electric, and it is not
surprising that in a few days the strangers, hitherto treated as friends, were
subjected to an unprovoked assault. Blackwood and Evans had been ashore taking
a meridian observation, and when they returned to their boat five ARROWS were
discharged at them, and muskets had to be fired in return. Happily, there were
no casualties on either side.</p>
<p>At last the contending parties of natives met and "had it out" with bows and
arrows. There were only light wounds on either side. Apparently somebody's, or
everybody's, honour was satisfied, and the affair was over, obviously to the
great relief of all concerned.</p>
<p>The peace, however, did nothing to overcome the reluctance of the islanders
to go to "Dowdee," and after promises had been made and broken again and again,
the idea of obtaining help from Darnley Island had to be abandoned.</p>
<p>The "<i>Fly</i>" left Darnley Island on 27th May and joined the "<i>Prince
George</i>" at BRAMBLE CAY.</p>
<p>On 29th May, Blackwood and Jukes went on board the "Prince George" and
sailed to a point 24 miles north of 8&deg; S. latitude, and up a large inlet
(AiRD RIVER) in 7&deg; 50' S., where they had a sharp encounter with the New
Guinea men, ten or twelve of whom were shot, some, it was supposed, being
killed.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 181}</u></p>
<p>It would be going too far outside the scope of this work to detail the
further adventures of the "<i>Fly</i>" and "<i>Prince George</i>" in New
Guinea. The point that chiefly concerns us is that nothing was heard or seen of
the missing boats.</p>
<p>The "<i>Prince George</i>" was sent, on 2nd June, direct to BOOBY ISLAND,
where she found, in the "post office," an account of the adventures of the
boats.</p>
<p>On 3rd June, the "<i>Fly</i>" once more cast anchor in Treacherous Bay,
DARNLEY ISLAND, and this time gentle peace was smiling on the land.
Nevertheless, the islanders did not disguise their satisfaction when they heard
that their white friends had been obliged to shoot some of the detested
Dowdeeans.</p>
<p>There were on the island a good many visitors from Tutte (WARRIOR) and
Damood (Damuth or DALRYMPLE) ISLANDS, and these reported that the MISSING BOATS
had passed by their islands peaceably and safely.</p>
<p>On 4th June, the "<i>Fly</i>" left Darnley Island, ran rapidly round Attagor
(Attagoy or STEPHEN'S ISLAND), and between DAMOOD (Dalrymple) and TUTTE
(Warrior Island), and anchored under DOVE ISLAND (10&deg; S.; 143&deg; 2' E.).
On the following day she was in EVANS BAY, CAPE YORK, where the 6th, 7th and
8th were employed in watering. The presence of five AUSTRALIAN NATIVES gave
Jukes an opportunity of contrasting the physical characteristics of this race
with those of the natives of the islands, who are of Papuan type. Briefly, his
observations may be stated thus:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Skin</i>.&mdash;Australians, sooty black. Islanders, reddish or yellowish
brown.</p>
<p><i>Hair</i>.&mdash;Australians, uniformly fine, and either straight or waved
in broad, open curls. Islanders, tufted on head and body: on the head frizzled
when short, and forming hard pipe-ringlets when long.</p>
<p>Jukes says of the Australians:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Houseless and homeless, without gardens or any kind
of cultivation, destitute of the coco-nut, the bamboo, the plantain or the yam,
as of almost all useful vegetables, they pass their lives either in the search
for food or in listless indolence. Instead of associating with us on something
like terms of equality, bartering with us, teaching us their words and learning
some of ours, laughing, joking and engaging in sports, like our Erroobian
friends, these Australians sat listlessly looking on, standing where we told
them, fetching anything or doing anything we ordered them, with great docility
indeed, but with a complete want of interest or curiosity. In our endeavours to
get words from them, they merely repeated our sounds or imitated our gestures."
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<p>In the vegetation of the two regions, there was a line of demarcation</p>
<blockquote>[1) My own experience corroborates these remarks. In spite of many
more opportunities for learning the Aboriginal language, or languages, than
Jukes enjoyed, I was completely baffled by the attitude which he so well
describes. All attempts that I made to "exchange words," although my object was
quite well understood to begin with, met with the invariable routine of
amusement as at a game, a tired feeling, brain-fag, sulks and
insubordination.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 182}</u></p>
<p>equally clear. On the mainland, gum trees extended to Cape York and the
immediately adjoining islands, with jungle-foliage only in gullies. On the
northern islands of the strait, there were no gum trees, and the woods were
dense and umbrageous, and often matted into thickets, with coco-nuts,
plantains, bamboos, etc. "It was evident," says Jukes, "that in crossing Torres
Strait we were passing from the Australian centre of life, so to speak, into
that of the Indian Archipelago, or, more strictly, perhaps, of the
Moluccas."</p>
<p>Having replenished the water supply at Evans Bay, the "<i>Fly</i>" sailed to
BOOBY ISLAND, where she found the "<i>Prince George</i>" whose men had learned
through the "post office" all about the movements of the LOST BOATS. It
appeared that the boats, unable to sight the ships or to make Bramble Cay, the
length of their stay being determined by the amount of the provisions carried,
had made for Booby Island, where, fortunately, the provisions left by the
"<i>Fly</i>" in February were still available. Their men had got water at PORT
LIHOU, Prince of Wales Island, and then taken on the "<i>Midge</i>" to PORT
ESSINGTON.</p>
<p>The "<i>Fly</i>" and "<i>Prince George</i>" arrived at PORT ESSINGTON on
12th June, 1845. There they found the crews and passengers of the
"<i>Hyderabad</i>" and "<i>Coringa Packet</i>" which had been WRECKED, the
former in the Cumberland Passage, near Murray Island, and the latter on outside
reefs in 17&deg; S. and 150&deg; E. The "<i>Prince George</i>" conveyed some of
the men to Singapore and the "<i>Fly</i>" took the rest to SYDNEY, where she
arrived on 25th September, 1845. There, orders were waiting, requiring the
"<i>Fly</i>" to return to England, while the survey was to be continued by Yule
in the "<i>Bramble</i>" with a tender to be commanded by Master (now
Lieutenant) Aird. The "<i>Castlereagh</i>" was subsequently purchased in Sydney
for this purpose, but was found unsuitable and was resold. The "<i>Bramble</i>"
was paid off in Sydney, but on the arrival of the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" to
replace the "<i>Fly</i>" was recommissioned to act as her tender and again put
under the command of Lieutenant Yule. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>In reviewing the voyage of the "<i>Fly</i>" Jukes strongly urged the
establishment of a POST AT CAPE YORK similar to that at Port Essington. He
foreshadowed the changes soon to be brought about by steam navigation, citing
Captain McKenzie's article in the <i>Nautical Magazine</i> for February, 1847,
in support of his views, and insisted on the necessity for coaling stations. He
predicted for such a settlement that it would speedily become "another
Singapore."</p>

<h4>LEICHHARDT'S OVERLAND EXPEDITION FROM BRISBANE TO PORT ESSINGTON,
1844-5</h4>
<h5>BRISBANE TO THE LYND RIVER</h5>
<p><b>LEICHHARDT'S PREVIOUS HISTORY. THE OVERLAND EXPEDITION. START FROM
BRISBANE. PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT. MOBILISE AT JIMBOUR. ITINERARY FROM JIMBOUR
TO THE HEAD OF THE LYND.</b></p>
<p>For a brief hour, as the southern cross appears to a watcher in the north,
DR. LUDWIG LEICHHARDT, the first land explorer to reach the Cape York Peninsula
from the south, rises above our horizon.</p>
<p>Leichhardt was born in Trebatch, Liibben, Prussia, in 1813. Owing to the
accidental omission of his name from the military rolls, he found himself, on
arriving at the age of manhood, free to indulge the passion for travel which
had been born with him. He reached Sydney in 1842, and as soon as he had
attained sufficient prominence to be noticed, was posted in his native country
as a deserter. At a later date, in recognition of his services to science, the
King of Prussia was graciously pleased to remove the stigma from his name by
granting him a free pardon. He might prove a useful instrument for peaceful
penetration.</p>
<p>For a little over two years, Leichhardt occupied himself in BOTANICAL AND
GEOLOGICAL TRAVELS, in the course of which he went as far north as Moreton Bay
(Brisbane).</p>
<p>Apart from the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death, Leichhardt's
fame rests on his successful TRAVERSE OF THE AUSTRALIAN CONTINENT from Moreton
Bay to Port Essington, the early settlement in Coburg Peninsula, in the north
of Arnhem Land, which has since been superseded by Port Darwin.</p>
<p>LEICHHARDT LEFT SYDNEY on 13th August, 1844, accompanied by JAMES CALVERT,
JOHN ROPER, JOHN MURPHY (aged 16), WILLIAM PHILLIPS (a "prisoner of the Crown")
and "HARRY BROWN," an aboriginal of the Newcastle tribe.</p>
<p>In Brisbane, there were added to the party, PEMBERTON HODGSON, a botanist;
JOHN GILBERT, who had been collecting for Gould, the Naturalist; CALEB, an
American negro; and CHARLEY, an aboriginal from Bathurst.</p>
<p>The expedition was mobilised at JIMBOUR, on the Darling Downs, and finally
left that station on 1st October, 1844.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 184}</u></p>
<p>The scientific EQUIPMENT consisted of a sextant and mercurial horizon; a
chronometer; a compass; and Arrowsmith's Map of New Holland. The TRANSPORT
animals were seventeen horses and sixteen bullocks.</p>
<p>A SPRING CART formed part of the initial train, but was evidently not meant
to go far: as a matter of fact, it was abandoned after a few days.</p>
<p>Leichhardt's original idea was to LIVE almost entirely ON GAME, as far as
meat was concerned. This was, however, soon found to be impracticable, and as
it was necessary to reduce the number of the party, HODGSON and CALEB LEFT on
3rd November to return to Jimbour, the main camp being then on the heads of the
DAWSON RIVER.</p>
<p>The ITINERARY of the expedition from Darling Downs to the heads of the
rivers falling into the Gulf of Carpentaria need only be briefly summarised, as
only the latter portion of the journey comes within the region forming the
subject of this work.</p>
<p>From JIMBOUR station, north of DALBY <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> to
near MiLES, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> the plain on the southern side of
the Bunya Bunya Range was followed. The range was crossed north of Miles and
the heads of the DAWSON RIVER were successively crossed on a course which was
at first nearly west and gradually swung round to the north. The COMET RIVER
was next run down from its head to its junction with the MACKENZIE. After the
high ground forming the PEAK RANGE had been traversed, a descent was made into
the valley of the Isaacs River, in the latitude of Broad Sound. The ISAACS was
then run up to its head, at a gap in the DENHAM RANGE, leading to the head of
the SUTTOR RIVER; and the Suttor was followed down to the Burdekin. (SEE MAP
Q.) The BURDEKIN valley was next followed up, past Sellheim railway station on
the Townsville to Charters Towers line, Dalrymple and the Valley of Lagoons,
and the DIVIDE between the waters of the Pacific and the Gulf of Carpentaria
was cleared north of MOUNT LANG. (SEE MAPS O, P AND K.)</p>
<blockquote>[1) The <i>route</i> is more easily followed by the introduction of
names of places which did not exist in Leichhardt's time than it would be if
only his own place-names were given.]</blockquote>

<p><i>(SEE MAP K.)</i></p>
<p>After spending some time in an attempt to get on western waters, Leichhardt
succeeded in crossing the DIVIDING RANGE and dropped down on the river to which
he gave the name of LYND, and which he ultimately followed down to the
north-west till it joined the MITCHELL RIVER.</p>
<p>Leichhardt's narrative of this portion of his travels shows some
carelessness as regards the direction and the distances travelled daily. It may
be assumed that, as he knew that he was following a river with a general
north-westerly course, he trusted to the establishment of his position from
time to time by observations for latitude, but as a matter of fact such
observations were not always possible or convenient. The best that can now be
done is to assume the correctness of the latitudes given and trust to hints in
the narrative for the position of intermediate camps. Arrowsmith's map,
however, gives additional information on many points, and, as it was "laid down
from Leichhardt's original map," such information is of material
assistance.</p>
<p>The gap by which Leichhardt crossed the DIVIDING RANGE on 23rd May, 1845,
appears to have been that which now takes the TELEGRAPH LINE from Junction
Creek to Mount Garnet. From this gap he reached the LYND in about 6 miles. The
rock passed over was mainly granite. CAMP, 23RD MAY. Lat. 17&deg; 58' S.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 186}</u></p>
<p>25th May.&mdash;Eight miles down the river WNW. Granite and pegmatite. CAMP
25TH MAY. This camp was probably about the mark LL 7 of the modern survey.</p>
<p>26th May.&mdash;This day's journey was mainly in granite country, although
basalt was met with towards the end of the stage. Very rough and mountainous.
Probably covered 8 miles to WSW. down the river. CAMP 26TH MAY must have been
about the western boundary-line of Glenfinlas block, St. Ronan's run.</p>
<p>27th May.&mdash;Low rocky ranges. Course of river mainly NW. Basalt
reappeared on the banks of the river below "a range of rugged little peaks"
(Ros's RANGE?) and "extended for some distance, now filling the flats with its
rough and cellular blocks and pebbles and again forming small hillocks of black
bare rock." CAMP 27th May. The latitude is given as 17&deg; 44' 40", which is
probably a clerical error, and should read 17&deg; 54' 40", and on this
assumption the camp would be about the modern bench mark L, XIX. This day some
NATIVES, men, women and children, were met with. "The men poised their spears
and shook their waddies to frighten us," says Leichhardt, "but when,
notwithstanding their menaces, we approached them, they left all their goods
and, with their weapons only, hurried up the rocks with wonderful agility."</p>
<p>A halt of three days was made at this camp while a bullock was killed and
the beef dried, the last of the salt having already been used. A series of
LUNAR OBSERVATIONS enabled Leichhardt to calculate the longitude of the camp as
143&deg; 30'. It may be that by a clerical error "143" has been substituted for
"144," as the error is practically one degree; but if Leichhardt really meant
143&deg; 30' his longitudes must be taken with caution. Arrowsmith charts the
camp at 144&deg;, which is impossible.</p>
<p>The expedition moved on down the river on 31st May, the country being
granitic except for small outbreaks of basalt. The distance travelled is not
mentioned, nor the direction, but the latter must have been NW. and the former
about 14 miles. CAMP 31st May was probably on the site of the "LYNDBROOK"
station on the modern CHILLAGOE-ETHERIDGE RAILWAY.</p>
<p>On 1st June, 8 miles down the river to NW. took the party to the infall of
Fossilbrook. CAMP 1st June. Lat. 17&deg; 45' 50" S., at Bench Mark LF.</p>
<p>2nd June.&mdash;Seven and a half miles WNW. down the river, in porphyry and
granite. CAMP 2nd June. Opposite mouth of HACKETT'S (FULFORD) CREEK.</p>
<p>3rd June.&mdash;Seven miles NW. down the river, in porphyry and granite, but
had to leave the river in some places and cross porphyry hills. Saw a family of
NATIVES, who fled. CAMP 3rd June. Talc schist near the camp.</p>
<p>4th June.&mdash;Travelling so rough that the party was compelled</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 187}</u></p>
<p>to leave the river. Regained the river after covering about 8 miles, gaining
about 5 miles to NW. Camp in lat. 17&deg; 34' 17.</p>
<p>5th June.&mdash;The party travelled about 9 miles west, on the chord of an
arc formed by a northward detour of the river. A range north of the river was
named KIRCHNER RANGE. (The 4-mile map names one of its peaks MOUNT VALENTINE.)
The rocks observed during the day's journey were granite, syenite, permatite
and hornblende rock. CAMP 5th June. On bank of river, near bench mark L 95.</p>
<p>6th June.&mdash;Nine miles west. Porphyry rocks, "composing hills of an
almost conical form." CAMP 6th June. Lat. 17&deg; 39' 47" S. Opposite bench
mark L 87.</p>
<p>7th June.&mdash;Travelled about 9 miles down the river, NW. Porphyry for the
first 4 miles, and then sandstone rocks appeared in the distance on the left.
As the party progressed, the sandstone approached the river, until they were
forced to travel in its bed. CAMP 7th June. About a mile short of the mouth of
the river which Hann afterwards named the TATE. Passed a camp of NATIVES.</p>
<p>8th June.&mdash;Travelled about 9 miles NW. Open country, although the
sandstone ranges approached the river in many places. CAMP 8th June. About 2
miles below bench mark L 71.</p>
<p>9th June.&mdash;Ten miles down the river NNW. Box-tree flats interrupted by
"abrupt barren craggy hills composed of sandstone, which seemed to rest on
layers of argillaceous rock." CAMP 9th June. Near the division between Torwood
and Torwood No. 1 pastoral blocks.</p>
<p>10th June.&mdash;Five miles NNW. down the river, over similar country. CAMP
10th June. Lat. 17&deg; 9' 7". At bench mark L54.</p>
<p>11th June.&mdash;Travelled 8 miles a few degrees west of north, the river
opening up into fine flats. CAMP 11th June. About 6 miles below bench mark L
50. (SEE MAP G.)</p>
<p>12th June.&mdash;Travelled 9 miles NNW. CAMP 12th June. Lat. 16&deg; 55' S.
(SEE MAP H.)</p>
<p>13th June.&mdash;Travelled 9 miles NNW. on "a coarse conglomerate of broken
pieces of quartz, either white or coloured with oxide of iron." Leichhardt
remarks of this conglomerate that "it greatly resembles the rock of Wybong
Hills on the Upper Hunter." CAMP 13th June. About 2 miles south of MASSIE
CREEK.</p>
<p>14th June.&mdash;Travelled 9 miles N. by W. over extensive box-tree flats.
Saw a TWO-STOREY NATIVE HUT or gunyah. CAMP 14th June. Lat. 16&deg; 38' S.</p>
<p>15th June.&mdash;Travelled 9&frac12; miles N. by W. down the river, over
similar country. CAMP 15th June. Lat. 16&deg; 30' S.</p>
<p>This was the LAST CAMP ON THE LYND. It will be observed that a sandstone,
apparently resting on argillaceous strata, and</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 188}</u></p>
<p>associated with a conglomerate bearing a resemblance to certain rocks on the
Upper Hunter, was met with from 7th to 15th June. I have been accustomed to
regard this and similar sandstones, occurring in tablelands in this district,
as belonging to DAINTREE'S DESERT SANDSTONE formation (Upper Cretaceous), but
in view of its proximity to "TAYLOR'S CARBONIFEROUS RANGE" and the relation of
the latter to MOUNT MULLIGAN, it is at least as likely to prove to be
PERMO-CARBONIFEROUS. (See <i>postea</i>, under "Hann's Expedition.")</p>
<p>Beneath this horizontally-bedded sandstone, or at least a portion of it,
there is reason to believe that the LOWER CRETACEOUS sedimentary rocks (which,
in this region, are the principal source of ARTESIAN WATER) will be found. The
probability is that the fossiliferous strata of the Walsh River and Elizabeth
Creek (<i>vide</i>, Taylor, in Hann's Expedition) are continued BENEATH THE
NEWER SANDSTONES OF THE LOWER LYND till they join the great artesian basin of
western Queensland.</p>
<p>All the way down the Lynd, GAME was abundant, and the presence of animals
not destined for "the pot" was noted by the leader of the expedition Among
these were scrub turkey, bower bird, black cockatoo, kite, crow, duck, teal,
white crane, native companion, pike, perch, sawfish (10th June), kangaroo,
wallaby, opossum, bandicoot and dingo.</p>

<p><b>(SEE MAP H.)</b></p>
<p>It is easy to follow Leichhardt's footsteps down the Mitchell with the aid
of modern maps. It must not, however, be forgotten that seventy years ago
Leichhardt was traversing an absolutely uncharted new land, and that his were
the first contributions to the charting which now delineates the topography of
the interior of the Cape York Peninsula.</p>
<p>Before tracing Leichhardt's progress north and west of the mouth of the
Lynd, it is necessary to consider the RHEOGRAPHY OF THE NASSAU, <i>de jure</i>,
AND MITCHELL RIVERS, as it is now understood.</p>
<p>Travelling from south to north, the three rivers, the NASSAU, <i>de jure</i>
(the STAATEN, <i>de facto</i>), the LYND and the MITCHELL, are perfectly
distinct, but long before they reach the Gulf of Carpentaria they have entered
a coastal plain which is common to them all, and have lost their identity by
linking one with another in a complex system of anastomosis.</p>
<p>For about 25 miles of its lower course, before joining the Mitchell, the
LYND begins to leak through numerous channels into the Staaten, <i>de
facto</i>. Then the MITCHELL, nearly as far down as</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 190}</u></p>
<p>the mouth of the Palmer, sends similar leakages to the STAATEN, <i>de
facto</i>. Below the Palmer, the MITCHELL, now only a little more than a degree
of longitude from the sea, begins to spread out a FAN OF MOUTHS, which,
however, do not keep independent courses but form a bewildering network of
anastomosing channels. It is difficult at all times for a traveller to be
certain which is the "main channel" of such a river, and it must be that, if
not from year to year, at least from century to century, floods alter the
channels in such a manner that their comparative importance undergoes radical
alterations.</p>
<p>Leichhardt himself did not actually see the JUNCTION OF THE LYND WITH THE
MITCHELL when he camped about 2 miles south of it on 15th June, 1845. Had he
realised, at the time, the importance of the Mitchell, he would not have been
content to take, as he did, his information about it from his followers. Roper,
Brown and Charley described the river at the junction as having a very broad
sandy bed, quite bare of vegetation, and, meandering through the sand, a small
stream which here and there expanded into large water-holes.</p>
<p>The expedition moved on 16th June WNW. down the Mitchell for an estimated
distance of 9 miles. The CAMP was on HIGHBURY LAGOON, on the left bank of the
river (long afterwards a Native Police Reserve).</p>
<p>A delay of two days was made at this camp while a bullock was killed and the
meat cured. The flour had been finished three weeks before.</p>
<p>On 19th June, a stage of about 8 miles was made to the NW., down the
Mitchell. The CAMP, beside a deep lagoon on the left bank, was in lat. 16&deg;
22' 16" S., and must have been about bench mark 10 M. Here Leichhardt noticed
the tracks of CROCODILES.</p>
<p>20th June.&mdash;Ten miles NW. down the Mitchell, past some fine LAGOONS.
Camp at bench mark 20M.</p>
<p>21st June.&mdash;Nine miles NW. down the Mitchell, past more fine lagoons.
The CAMP, in lat. 16&deg; 9' 41" S., was on "a small creek, scarcely a mile
from the river, from which John Murphy and Brown brought the leaves of the
first PALM TREES we had seen on the waters of the Gulf. They belonged to the
genus Corypha." This creek runs into the left bank of the river near bench mark
30M. NATIVES were observed collecting the seeds of water-lilies for food.</p>
<p>From the Lynd to the camp of 21st June, Leichhardt's course is now followed
by the road connecting GAMBOOLA with DUNBAR cattle station.</p>
<p>22nd June.&mdash;Twelve miles NW. down the Mitchell. Passed a very long
lagoon and noted the superior quality of the grass now known as MITCHELL GRASS,
which is the most appreciated of all on the "sheep country" of the western
interior of Queensland. The</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 191}</u></p>
<p>CAMP, in lat. 16&deg; 3' 11" S., was on a swamp or sedgy lagoon near bench
mark L.</p>
<p>23rd June.&mdash;Eight or 9 miles NW. down the Mitchell, passing a great
number of dry SWAMPS. The CAMP was in lat. 16&deg; 0' 26", about the bench mark
R 100. The river is thus described: "Its banks were covered with a rather open
vine brush. Palm trees became numerous and grew 40 or 50 feet high, with a
thick trunk swelling in the middle and tapering upwards and downwards.
<i>Sarcocephalus</i>, the clustered fig tree, and the drooping tea tree were
also present as usual. The bed of the river, an immense sheet of sand, was full
a mile and a half broad, but the stream itself did not exceed 30 yards in
width." In the course of this day's journey, the infall of the PALMER RIVER was
passed, but was not observed.</p>
<p>24th June.&mdash;Nine miles W. by N., to lat. 15&deg; 59' 30" S., the CAMP
being on PLAIN CREEK. This creek leaks out of the left bank of the Mitchell and
falls into Dunbar Creek, which itself leaks out of the Mitchell. Leichhardt,
referring to it, remarks that "a chain of water-holes, fringed with mangrove
myrtle, changed into a creek which had no connection with the river, but was
probably one of the heads of the Nassau."</p>
<p>This erroneous conjecture has been followed by all subsequent cartographers,
and the creek named DUNBAR CREEK where it issues from the river, is designated
the Nassau River further to the west. It SHOULD BE NAMED THE DUNBAR
THROUGHOUT.</p>
<p>The inlet which the Dutch navigators named the NASSAU REVIER is the river
which hugs the parallel of 16&deg; 30' S. lat. westward from the meridian of
142&deg; 35' E. long., and which is erroneously named the Staaten on modern
maps. The true STATEN REVIER of the Dutch is one of the mouths of the Gilbert
River, probably Accident Inlet.</p>
<p>25th June.&mdash;Travelled 10 miles NW., but did not follow the river, which
made large windings to the north. The track lay "over a well-grassed forest
land and several CREEKS, WHICH, ALTHOUGH RISING NEAR THE RIVER, APPEARED TO
HAVE NO COMMUNICATION WITH IT." The plains, says Leichhardt, "rose slightly
towards the river, forming a remarkable watershed, perhaps between the Nassau
(i.e., DUNBAR CREEK) and the MITCHELL."</p>
<p>Leichhardt was, in fact, puzzled by a phenomenon which is well known to
travellers in lands where large rivers deploy upon flat country. The beds of
such rivers tend to silt up, and the deposits left by periodical floods raise
the banks until they become the highest land of the neighbourhood. The best
known instance is that of "China's Sorrow," the HOANG Ho, whose channel has to
be laboriously cleared out from time to time as a precaution against the
inundation of the "netherlands."</p>
<p>The CAMP of 25th June was in 15&deg; 21' 26" S. lat., on an anabranch now
known as LEICHHARDT CREEK.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 192}</u></p>
<p>Here Leichhardt determined to LEAVE THE MITCHELL, which was carrying him too
far north, his intention being to round the southern end of the Gulf.</p>
<p>26th June. Seven miles almost due west, passing a number of fine long reedy
water-holes. The CAMP, in lat. 15&deg; 52' 38" S., was on LONDON CREEK, and on
the road which now connects DUNBAR and KALKA stations. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>27th June.&mdash;Eight miles WSW. to a CAMP on a lagoon parallel to a dry
creek, "which," says Leichhardt, "must belong to the Nassau, as its latitude
was 15&deg; 55' 8"." This is the water-course which, as has already been
pointed out, ought to be called DUNBAR CREEK.</p>
<p>The smoke of NATIVES' FIRES was seen on the plains in every direction, and
in all probability the fires were gathering signals.</p>
<p>After the party had arrived in camp, Leichhardt relates that "whilst Charley
and Brown were in search of game, they observed a NATIVE sneaking up to our
bullocks, evidently with the intention of driving them towards a party of his
black companions, who, with POISED SPEARS, were waiting to receive them. Upon
detecting this manoeuvre, Charley and his companion hurried forward to prevent
their being driven away, when the natives gave the alarm, and all took to their
heels, with the exception of a lame fellow, who endeavoured to persuade his
friends to stand fight. Charley, however, fired his gun, which had the intended
effect of frightening them, for they deserted their camp, which was 300 yards
from ours, in a great hurry, leaving, among other articles, a small net full of
potatoes [yams?] which Charley afterwards picked up. The gins had previously
retired; a proof that mischief was intended."</p>
<p>28th&mdash;June. Crossing DUNBAR CREEK (which Leichhardt erroneously
believed to be the Nassau), the party travelled 9 miles west, over "a most
beautifully varied country, of plains, of forest land, and chains of lagoons.
The camp was on a chain of shallow lagoons, connected by a hollow."</p>
<h5>THE DELTA OF THE MITCHELL</h5>
<p><b>(SEE MAPS H AND F.)</b></p>
<p>It is convenient, in this place, to conclude the description of the Lower
Mitchell, as it is now known.</p>
<p>It has already been pointed out how Leichhardt, in 1845, followed down the
river which he had named the Mitchell, while it was still a distinct
watercourse and ran in its own valley, and how, having entered on the delta, he
ran down Dunbar Creek, one of the mouths of the Mitchell, which (following
Flinders) he erroneously identified with Carstenszoon's Nassau Revier. The
error has since been confirmed by long usage, and DUNBAR CREEK, <i>de jure</i>,
has become the NASSAU RIVER, <i>de facto</i>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Assuming the correctness of the modern map, Leichhardt's
positions from 20th to 25th June are all about 4 miles too far
south.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 193}</u></p>
<p>The JARDINE BROTHERS' traverse of the delta of the Mitchell in 1864 was
further west than Leichhardt's. Keeping a northerly course, they crossed DUNBAR
CREEK (the Nassau River, <i>de facto</i>) and were the first to wander among
the anastomosing channels intersecting the delta. They next crossed the
SCRUTTON RIVER, which comes out of Magnificent Creek and runs into the Dunbar,
and MAGNIFICENT CREEK (named by them Arbour Creek), which comes out of the
Mitchell proper and runs into the "South Mouth" of the river. Lastly, they
followed the MITCHELL proper northwestward to lat. 15&deg; 10' S., where the
"North Mitchell" leaks out of the mouth which is named the "Main Channel."</p>
<p>Most of the mouths of the Mitchell (below the infall of the Palmer) were
surveyed by J. T. Embley in 1886-7.</p>
<p>It was the part of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND MISSION to the Aborigines to make
the latest addition to our knowledge of the delta. I am indebted to the Rev.
John Jones, of the Australian Board of Missions, for a pamphlet entitled
"Mitchell River Aboriginal Mission," printed in Thursday Island, undated, but
evidently issued after 11th July, 1905, as it contains excerpts from Bishop
White's diary of that date. A map attached to the pamphlet shows that
KILPATRICK CREEK has been traced northwestward to its junction with the "South
Mitchell," while another creek, to the west, runs NNW. and joins Kilpatrick
Creek. On this creek, which may be referred to as BOSWORTH CREEK, is located
"OLD" BOSWORTH (CATTLE) STATION (lat. 15&deg; 30' S.), as well as the site of a
new mission station, to be named YEREMUNDO. West of Magnificent Creek, a chain
of fine fresh-water lagoons extends from east to west, and on the banks of the
lagoons are first the out-mission-station DAPHNE, and then the head station
TRUBANAMAN. Below the head station the lagoons merge into a winding salt-water
inlet, opening into the Gulf in lat. 11&deg; 25' S. Two out-stations of the
mission, KOONGALARA and ANGERAM, are situated on this salt-water inlet, the
former about a mile west of the head station and the latter on the sea coast. A
few miles south of the Trubanaman Creek and lagoons, TOPSY CREEK commences in
the east, also as a chain of fresh-water lagoons, and further west becomes a
salt-water inlet, which falls into Trubanaman Creek. Bishop White, in his
diary, expresses the belief that both Trubanaman and Topsy Creeks leak out of
Magnificent Creek, and I have no doubt that he is right.</p>
<p>The Mission, for which a reserve of about 500 square miles has been set
apart, was initiated in 1902, and evidently exercises a civilising influence on
the natives, but I am unable to assign the credit due to individual
missionaries for their part in the exploration of this exceptionally
interesting geographical region.</p>

<p>At Leichhardt's camp on 28th June, 1845, a terrible disaster overtook his
party. (SEE MAP H.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"After dinner," says Leichhardt, "Messrs. Roper and
Calvert retired to their tent, and Mr. Gilbert, John Murphy and the aboriginal
Brown were platting palm leaves to make a hat. Gilbert then retired with John
to the tent. This was about seven o'clock, and I stretched myself upon the
ground as usual, at a little distance from the fire, and fell into a dose, from
which I was suddenly roused by a loud noise and a call for help from Calvert
and Roper. NATIVES had suddenly ATTACKED us. They had doubtless watched our
movements during the afternoon and marked the position of the different tents;
and as soon as it was dark sneaked upon us and threw a shower of spears at the
tents of Calvert, Roper and Gilbert, and a few at that of Phillips, and also
one or two towards the fire.<br>
<br>
"Charley and Brown called for caps, which I hastened to find, and as soon as
they were provided they discharged their guns into the crowd of the natives,
who instantly fled, leaving Roper and Calvert pierced with several spears and
severely beaten by their waddies. Several of these spears were barbed and could
not be extracted without difficulty. I had to force one of them through the arm
of Roper, to break off the barb; and to cut another out of the groin of Mr.
Calvert. John Murphy had succeeded in getting out of the tent and concealing
himself behind a tree, whence he fired at the natives, and severely wounded one
of them before Brown had discharged his gun."</blockquote>
<p>GILBERT was KILLED outright. On coming out of his tent,</p>
<blockquote>[1) Macgillivray, who was Naturalist on the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>,"
wrote in September, 1849:&mdash;I am convinced that some at least of the
collisions which have taken place in Australia between the first European
visitors and the natives of any given district have originated in causes of
offence brought on by the indiscretion of one or more of the party and revenged
on others who were innocent. As a memorable instance I may give that which
happened during Leichhardt's overland journey to Port Essington, when his camp
was attacked one evening and Mr. Gilbert lost his life. Long afterwards, the
undoubted cause of this apparently unaccountable attack transpired, in the
acknowledgment, while intoxicated, by one of the persons concerned, that a
gross outrage had been committed upon an aboriginal woman a day or two
previously by the two blacks belonging to the expedition." (<i>Voyage of the
"Rattlesnake</i>," 1, 313.) Macgillivray, who was a man of sound and temperate
judgment, and who had more than once been confronted with the aboriginal
problem in its most practical form, must be respectfully heard, and it may be
presumed that he had satisfied himself of the truth of the story, although, as
he tells it, it certainly would not pass for legal evidence in a court of
justice.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 195}</u></p>
<p>he handed a gun and ammunition to the aboriginal Charley, and then dropped
dead. "The spear," says Leichhardt, "had entered the chest between the clavicle
and the neck; but made so small a wound that for some time I was unable to
detect it."</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Mr. ROPER had received two or three spear wounds on
the scalp of his head: one spear had passed through his left arm, another into
his cheek below the jugal bone, and penetrated the orbit, and injured the optic
nerve, and another in his loins, besides a heavy blow on the shoulder. MR.
CALVERT had received several severe blows from a waddi; one on the nose, which
had crushed the nasal bones; one on the elbow, and another on the back of his
hand; besides which, a barbed spear had entered his groin, and another into his
knee. As may be readily imagined, both suffered great pain and were scarcely
able to move."</blockquote>
<p>Both the wounded men recovered rapidly. Calvert was able to resume his
duties by 21st July.</p>
<p>The JOURNEY WAS RESUMED on 1st July, and SALT WATER was met with on the 5th,
in an inlet from the Gulf of Carpentaria. It is of interest, before going
further, to quote Leichhardt's own summing-up of his progress to this point. He
remarks, with satisfaction:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We had now discovered a line of communication by
land between the eastern coast of Australia and the Gulf of Carpentaria. We had
travelled along never-failing and, for the greater part, running waters; and
over an excellent country, available, almost in its whole extent, for pastoral
purposes."</blockquote>
<p>On 7th July, the party forded a salt-water river, in 16&deg; 30' S. lat.,
which Leichhardt (erroneously, following Flinders, who followed Tasman)
supposed to be the "<i>Pera's</i>" STATEN REVIER, but which, it is now clear,
must have been the "<i>Pera's</i>" NASSAU REVIER. It would be impossible to
restore the original name, and long use has indelibly stamped the river as the
STAATEN, <i>de facto</i>.</p>
<p>On 9th July, the explorers camped on what Arrowsmith's map <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> called the VAN DIEMEN RIVER. This, according to modern
maps, is the SMITHBURN MOUTH OF THE GILBERT, erroneously identified by Flinders
as Tasman's Van Diemen River. On the 12th, 13 miles to the south-west, they
crossed a small river which Leichhardt named the GILBERT. (SEE MAP M.) This
appears to have been CROOKED CREEK (ending in ACCIDENT INLET), below the
modern</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Australia, from Surveys made by Order of the British
Government combined with those of D'Entrecasteaux, Baudin, Freicinet, etc.,
etc.</i>, by John Arrowsmith, 1838. Evidently the map by which Leichhardt
travelled.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 196}</u></p>
<p>Midlothian Station. It is the southmost mouth of the Gilbert, and there are
the strongest grounds for the belief that it was the "furthest south" of the
"<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" named by Carstenszoon the STATEN REVIER.</p>
<p>On 18th July, Leichhardt camped in 17&deg; 41' 52", probably east of the
modern township of NORMANTON. There does not appear to have been anything
distinctive enough about the NORMAN RIVER, in this region, to call for a name.
It was simply that the party had to go a long way round to the east and south
to avoid mangrove swamps. On the 17th, presumably because he was near the
latitude (16&deg; 23') of the inlet which Flinders had mistaken for Tasman's
Caron Revier, he reckoned he had identified "Caron RIVER (CORNER INLET)."
Possibly it was BRANNIGAN CREEK.</p>
<p>It may be said here that I have made painful and conscientious attempts to
follow Leichhardt round the southern end of the Gulf by the aid of his diary
and Arrowsmith's illustrative map, and I warn those who may essay the task in
future that "that way madness lies." Leichhardt did not give sufficient
<i>data</i> for the identification of his positions on the modern map, whereas
Arrowsmith, with only the coast-line to guide him, must have had even a harder
task than was mine. I have come to the deliberate conclusion that all charting
of this portion of Leichhardt's journey is worthless. His latitudes <i>must</i>
be wrong. Perhaps his sextant was out of order. He must have been very careless
about distances and bearings.</p>
<p>We find him camped on 6th August in what he calls lat. 17&deg; 57' S., on a
river which, he says, "I am inclined to think is the ALBERT of Captain Stokes
and the Maetsuyker of the Dutch navigators." Sir (then Mr.) Augustus Gregory
noted (in 1856) the obvious mistake and named the river the LEICHHARDT.</p>
<p>On 18th August, Leichhardt struck a large river which must have been the
real ALBERT, and had to follow it up 4 or 5 miles to the south-west before he
could find a crossing. A running creek was found falling into its left bank,
and was named BEAME'S BROOK, after Walter Beames, of Sydney. (SEE MAP N.)</p>
<p>Leaving Beanie's Brook on a north-westerly course, a river, which Leichhardt
named the NICHOLSON, after Henry Alleyne Nicholson, of Bristol, was crossed
within two miles. Pursuing this, or a slightly more northerly course, the 138th
meridian of east longitude was passed. This line now divides the State of
QUEENSLAND from the NORTHERN TERRITORY.</p>
<p>Leichhardt's journey across the southern end of the Gulf of Carpentaria was
marked by few noteworthy incidents. His assiduity in making botanical and
geological observations had full play, and his success in "shooting for the
pot" gave him no reason for complaint as regards diet, emus, pigeons and
cockatoos being abundant.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 197}</u></p>
<p>It is not within the scope of our subject to follow the fortunes of the
expedition from the GULF TO PORT ESSINGTON, which was reached on 17th December,
1845. At the small settlement, the party were entertained for a month by the
Commandant, Captain Macarthur. The schooner "<i>Heroine</i>" Captain Mackenzie,
conveyed the party, <i>via</i> Torres Strait and the inner passage, to SYDNEY,
where they arrived on 29th March, and were accorded an enthusiastic
welcome.</p>
<p>LEICHHARDT'S SECOND EXPEDITION had for its object the crossing of the
continent from BRISBANE TO THE "SWAN RIVER SETTLEMENT" (now Perth). Having
collected funds and made other necessary preparations, he LEFT MELBOURNE in
September, 1846. The expedition was, like the first, mobilised at JIMBOUR,
which was left on 7th December. The party comprised LEICHHARDT, DANIEL BUNCE
(Botanist and Naturalist), JOHN F. MANN (Draftsman), HOVENDEN HELY, JAMES PERRY
(Saddler), HENRY BOECKING (Cook), TURNBULL (Assistant Storekeeper) and WOMMAI
(or Jimmy) and "HARRY BROWN" (both aboriginals).</p>
<p>The progress of this second expedition is mainly to be followed in BUNCE'S
"NOTES FROM TRAVELS WITH DR. LEICHHARDT" and MANN'S "EIGHT MONTHS WITH DR.
LEICHHARDT." <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Both men had grievances against
their leader, and refused to follow him in his subsequent campaigns. This
circumstance may have coloured their narratives, but even allowing for such
colouring, there seems to be strong grounds for the belief that Leichhardt's
PREPARATIONS for a two-years' trip were INADEQUATE beyond all reason or
prudence. There was hardly any MEDICINE CHEST, and as for FOOD, Bunce
states:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The quantity of FLOUR taken was just sufficient to
admit of a daily allowance of 3&frac12; OUNCES to each man for a period of 8
MONTHS, by which time it was supposed they would have become sufficiently
abstemious in their habits to enable them to dispense with that staff of life
during the remainder of their journey, which it was expected would terminate in
TWO YEARS from that period."</blockquote>
<p>It is not to be wondered at that the expedition was a fiasco.</p>
<p>By slow marches, interrupted by long periods of camping in different places,
the expedition wound its way to the NORTH-NORTHWEST. The <i>route</i> of the
previous "overland expedition" was followed for the most part, the chief
exception being that the head waters of the DAWSON were crossed a little
further to the east and the EXPEDITION RANGE was crossed from east to west into
the valley of the COMET RIVER.</p>
<p>EVERYTHING WENT WRONG FROM THE START. Much time was lost in SEARCHING FOR
HORSES, mules, cattle, sheep and goats, which</p>
<blockquote>[1) See also Ernest Favenc's <i>History of Australian
Exploration</i>, Sydney, 1888, p. 165, and Rev. J. E. Tenison-Woods' <i>History
of the Discovery and Exploration of Australia</i>, London, 1865, Vol. II, p.
147.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 198}</u></p>
<p>continually strayed. A heavy WET SEASON set in, and the march along alluvial
flats on which mud was drying in the sun brought MALARIAL FEVER in its train.
By the end of March, 1847, the whole stock of FLOUR had SOURED. Parties of the
sick had to be left here and there, the main body having to wait for them to
catch up. The individual members of the expedition grumbled and discussed the
advisability of retreat, and the leader, himself sick, lost his nerve and
displayed the most embarrassing vacillation.</p>
<p>Bunce's statement that the expedition set out on a two-and-a-half years'
trip, with only a starvation allowance of flour for eight months, if true,
shows that the leader was rash to the point of criminality. On the other hand,
if his followers were aware of the state of affairs from the start (and in
handling the loads daily they must have learned the facts in a few days at
most), their only course, as sensible men, would have been to refuse to embark
on an expedition foredoomed to failure.</p>
<p>On 22nd June, 1847, LEICHHARDT TURNED BACK from a point on the eastern side
of the PEAK RANGE in lat. 22&deg; 50' S. (approx.). This was the point from
which he had originally planned to strike west for the Swan River, but the
hopelessness of the task had become obvious, and the inevitable had to be
accepted.</p>
<p>CHAUVEL'S STATION on the CONDAMINE RIVER, at that time the furthest outpost
of civilisation, was reached on 6th July, 1847, and the party was broken
up.</p>
<p>Here Leichhardt heard of the successful termination of SIR THOMAS MITCHELL'S
EXPEDITION, and on 9th August he set out from HENRY STUART RUSSELL'S STATION,
on what may be called his THIRD EXPEDITION, accompanied by F. N. ISAACS, JAMES
PERRY, DANIEL BUNCE AND WOMMAI (Jimmy), the aboriginal. No difficulty was
experienced in reaching and identifying Mitchell's FITZROY DOWNS and GRAFTON
RANGE. The <i>route</i> traversed by Leichhardt, indeed, offered no natural
obstacles (except black soil in wet seasons) and is now served by the Western
Railway. Leichhardt joined lines with Mitchell at MOUNT ABUNDANCE, near Roma,
where smiling vineyards now gratify the eye of the tourist.</p>
<p>Leichhardt returned to JIMBOUR about 14th September, and shortly afterwards
went to SYDNEY. His journal of this Third Expedition is given in an Appendix to
Bunce's <i>Travels with Dr. Leichhardt</i>, and is also to be found, as edited
by the REV. W. B. CLARKE, in <i>Waugh's Australian Almanac</i> for 1860. The
latter, it may be pointed out, is an instance of the extraordinary <i>media</i>
chosen by Clarke for the publication of his writings, which were valuable at
the time, and have now become of historical as well as scientific importance.
It may well be doubted whether any human being is in possession of Clarke's
<i>Omnia Opera</i>, and the fact that somebody vaguely recollected having
somewhere seen something written by Clarke is, no doubt, responsible for
the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 199}</u></p>
<p>luxuriant growth of unverifiable legend which has gathered around his
statements and opinions.</p>
<p>Leichhardt's FOURTH, and last, EXPEDITION set out from "BIRRELL'S STATION on
the CONDAMINE" in March, 1848. Its only record is contained in a short letter,
dated 3rd April, from "MACPHERSON'S STATION on the COGOON," <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> in which he states that he had travelled to that
station, via MOUNT ABUNDANCE, in eleven days. The rest is silence.</p>
<p>The party consisted of LEICHHARDT, BOECKING, CLASSEN, HENTIG, STUART, KELLY,
and two BLACK BOYS. Boecking, who had been cook on the second expedition, was
the only white man who had been with Leichhardt before. BUNCE makes the
significant statement that he and other members of the second expedition had
agreed to join the fourth on certain conditions to which Leichhardt had agreed
at the conclusion of the second expedition, but which he repudiated on his
return from Sydney. We can only conjecture that the disputed stipulations
referred, <i>inter alia</i>, to food, medicines and remuneration. Bunce's words
regarding the "stipulations" are: "They were such as we humbly conceived to be
of the greatest importance to the success of the expedition."</p>
<p>From the mass of documents relating to Leichhardt's preparations, I carry
away the impression that he was short of funds, and that what appeared mean and
parsimonious to the men who were prepared to share his adventures and
privations, may have been forced upon him by pecuniary considerations, added
to, of course, by his desire to TRAVEL LIGHT, and TRUST TO LUCK for game and
vegetable foods. It appears also, according to Bunce, that Leichhardt held some
faddist theory that men could train themselves to dispense with farinaceous
food.</p>
<p>As on his second expedition, LEICHHARDT'S GOAL on his fourth and last was
the SWAN RIVER SETTLEMENT (Perth, Western Australia). He is known to have
entertained theories as to the northward extension of the supposed "Great
Australian Desert," which would naturally lead him to the north of a direct
westerly course. Many conjectures have been made regarding his <i>route</i>,
some even supposing that he would make for the Gulf of Carpentaria before
turning to the south-west. Several SEARCH PARTIES tried to solve the mystery of
his fate; none of them, however, met with any success, except, perhaps, Mr.
(afterwards SIR) AUGUSTUS GREGORY'S, who, in April, 1858, discovered traces of
what may have been ONE OF LEICHHARDT'S CAMPS on the upper waters of the BARCOO
RIVER between the modern townships of Tambo and Blackall, and, perhaps, Duncan
Macintyre of Glengower's.</p>
<p>Macintyre, who had made a journey down the Flinders to the Gulf of
Carpentaria towards the end of the year 1864, reported on</p>
<blockquote>[1) Now better known as Muckadilla Creek. It runs south-eastward
from Muckadilla railway station and falls into the Balonne River about fifty
miles south of Roma.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 200}</u></p>
<p>his return that he had seen two trees marked L on the western bank of the
Flinders in about 20&deg; S. lat. (SEE MAP R.) It would be natural to suppose
that the marks were Landsborough's, made in 1862, but the growth of bark over
the incised letters appeared to be of considerably greater age than two years,
and besides there were no numbers, whereas it was Landsborough's custom to mark
his camps with consecutive numbers as well as initials. On these grounds it was
argued that the marked trees indicated camps of Leichhardt on his last journey.
Two old horses picked up by Macintyre on the Dugald River (which he named)
about 100 miles west of the marked trees, he also supposed to have been
Leichhardt's. The ladies of Melbourne raised a sum of money and sent Macintyre
back to the locality in 1865, but no further traces of Leichhardt were
discovered. On this occasion, Duncan Macintyre observed a tract of fine land on
Julia Creek, where, later, his brother, Donald, took up Dalgonally Station.
(See <i>Proc. Roy. Geogr. Soc.</i>, Vol. IX, p. 303, quoting letter to the
Editor of the <i>Melbourne Age</i> of 24th December, 1864, signed by Drs. Ferd.
von Mueller and David Wilkie, and <i>The Empty North</i>, by John Norman
Macintyre. Sydney, Penfold, 1920.)</p>
<p>It will never be known whether Leichhardt and his party were killed by
natives, or whether they fell before one of the other furies of the waste whose
dread names are Famine, Thirst, Flood and Fire.</p>
<p>In the cities of the south, Leichhardt was noted for a charming and
ingratiating manner, and this served him in good stead while he was soliciting
financial aid for his schemes of exploration. He desired above all things to
win the honour of a British Knighthood, and this ambition was probably never
lost sight of when he cultivated the friendship and support of influential
colonists. The conspicuous success of his "Overland" expedition, and afterwards
the tragedy of his mysterious disappearance from the face of the earth,
stimulated the enthusiasm of a generous public to a high appreciation of the
amiable and admirable qualities he had displayed.</p>
<p>The success of the "Overland" expedition was due in a great measure more to
the luck of an exceptionally favourable season than to the perfection of his
plans. His other expeditions were no less ill-planned, and they confronted him
with obstacles which he was incompetent to overcome.</p>
<p>Out in the field with his men, and faced with difficulties which foresight
and resource on his part should have averted or minimised, he would not have
been recognised as the suave and tactful courtier known to Sydney Society. The
coarse bully lecturing his followers and comparing himself to a general leading
an army had forgotten that he had taken advantage of the mistake of a registrar
to evade the military service which was the law of his own land. He was callous
to the sufferings of the fever-stricken members of the party, who were unable
to keep up with his pace. He made agreements</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 201}</u></p>
<p>which he refused to fulfil. He carried secret stores of dainties on which he
luxuriated while his followers were on the brink of starvation. In the middle
of the nineteenth century he was a living proof that the Prussian spirit, as
the world came to know it in 1914-18, was no new thing.</p>
<p>It is painful to write such words of a man who did unquestionable service to
Australia, and I am conscious that my opinions may be supposed to be tinged
with the bitterness engendered by the Great War. As a matter of fact, these
opinions were formed on the whole mass of documentary evidence before the war
broke out, and I am unable to place the easy-going rule of saying nothing but
pleasant things of the dead above the duty devolving on the historian to write
the unvarnished truth. It may be added that my conclusions had been arrived at
before my reading on the subject had taken me as far as Ernest Favenc's
<i>History of Australian Exploration.</i> <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
After reading that writer's illuminating remarks, it will be understood that I
make no claim to originality for my estimate of Leichhardt's personal
character.</p>

<p>EDMUND BESLEY COURT KENNEDY had been second in command of Sir Thomas
Mitchell's expedition, which left Buree on 15th December, 1845, and which
penetrated to the Darling River, Balonne, St. George and the Maranoa River. In
1847, he led an expedition with the object of tracing the course of the Barcoo,
when he followed the river into South Australia till it ran out into
marshes.</p>
<p>In 1848, he was appointed by the Government of New South Wales to the
leadership of an expedition designed TO EXPLORE the coast country FROM
ROCKINGHAM BAY (18&deg; S. lat.) TO CAPE YORK. The successes of Mitchell and
Leichhardt had roused him to emulate their exploits and to plan an expedition
on a more ambitious scale than the one which he had already concluded. He
carried a copy of Leichhardt's <i>Overland Expedition</i>, then fresh from the
press. No doubt it was his daily study, and Leichhardt's methods his model. The
influence of the book is very distinctly traceable in the nature of his
preparations and equipment&mdash;which proved singularly inapplicable to the
country he was to travel over. He and his party left Sydney in the "<i>Tam
O'Sbanter</i>" barque, on 29th April, 1848, convoyed by H.M.S.
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>." The "<i>Rattlesnake's</i>" voyages extended to New Guinea
and the Louisiade Archipelago, although she set out from Sydney with the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 203}</u></p>
<p>specific object of surveying the "Inner Passage," <i>viz</i>., that between
the eastern side of Cape York Peninsula and the Barrier Reef. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>The ship was also to carry Kennedy's party to Rockingham Bay and assist in
their debarkation and start. The two vessels anchored on 23rd May under the lea
of the westmost of the Family Islands group, and the debarkation was
accomplished on the two following days. The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" carried a
distinguished group of naturalists, among whom was THOMAS HUXLEY, Assistant
Surgeon. Huxley accompanied Kennedy, before the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" sailed, on
an excursion made by the explorer "for the purpose of searching a way out from
the low swampy district of Rockingham Bay," and contributed a drawing,
reproduced in the <i>Narrative of the Voyage</i>, of a scene entitled "Cutting
through the Scrub." Kennedy is represented hacking at vines with a tomahawk,
and is followed by a man carrying a gun. Both men lead spirited and
gaily-caparisoned horses. MacGillivray remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I last saw poor Kennedy on the evening before he
broke up his camp: he was then in high spirits and confident of success. The
party, of 13 men and 28 horses (with carts, a flock of sheep for food, etc.),
appeared to be furnished with every requisite for their intended journey, and
the arrangements and appointments seemed to me to be perfect. Nor did I,
despite the forebodings of others, argue anything but a successful result to an
undertaking, the blame of which was <i>afterwards</i> attempted to be thrown
upon those who had planned it." <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></blockquote>
<p>We learn from the <i>Narrative of the Voyage</i> that Kennedy's original
plan was to explore first to the east of the dividing range; to meet a vessel
<b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> which was to wait at Cape York with supplies;
and then to make his way southward by the west coast to the southeast corner of
the Gulf of Carpentaria, and make his way back, as might be found convenient,
to the nearest settlement. It was a gigantic undertaking, and its success
obviously depended upon the endurance of the horses, regarding which bushmen of
experience might well have entertained serious forebodings.</p>
<p>It appears also that H.M.S. "<i>Bramble</i>" was to be in PRINCESS CHARLOTTE
BAY in the beginning of August, <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b> and Kennedy
expected to obtain SUPPLIES from her. He arrived, however, too late, and
abandoned the attempt to reach the coast on 13th October, in the belief that
the "<i>Bramble</i>" must have left the <i>rendezvous</i>.</p>
<p>Kennedy was provided with a SEXTANT and must also have carried a
CHRONOMETER/ as, in the few instances where the latitude is given and the still
fewer instances where the longitude is recorded, the figures are as accurate as
could be expected in the circumstances.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 204}</u></p>
<p>He may have given these readings to Carron at the request of the latter, or
Carron may have assisted in the observations and noted the results.</p>
<p>The leader kept a DIARY, which was LOST, or lost all but a few unimportant
scraps. Carron kept a private diary, but that portion of it which would have
been of geographical value, bringing the travels of the party to his last camp
at the mouth of the Pascoe River, was lost, and it was only from an abstract of
it that he reconstructed his narrative.</p>
<p>Practically, the only record of the ill-fated expedition is contained in an
octavo booklet entitled:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Narrative of an Expedition undertaken under the Direction of the late Mr.
Assistant Surveyor, E. B. Kennedy, for the Exploration of the Country lying
between Rockingham Bay and Cape York: By WILLIAM CARRON, one of the Survivors
of the Expedition";</p>
<p>to which are added:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) "The Statement of the Aboriginal Native JACKEY-JACKEY, who accompanied
Mr. Kennedy";</p>
<p>(2) "The Statement of DR. VALLACK and CAPTAIN DOBSON, who rescued the
Survivors of the Expedition"; and</p>
<p>(3) "The Statement of CAPTAIN SIMPSON, of the '<i>Freak</i>,' who proceeded
in search of Mr. Kennedy's Papers, etc."</p>
<p>The booklet was printed in Sydney in 1849 by Kemp &amp; Fairfax. It is now
almost inaccessible to the public, the only copy for sale in Sydney being
priced at three guineas. It has, however, been substantially incorporated in
the <i>Voyage of the "Rattlesnake"</i> and an examination of the copy in the
Mitchell Library enables me to point out the omissions from the reprint.</p>
<p>1. The Statement of Captain Dobson, of the "<i>Ariel</i>" is omitted
entirely.</p>
<p>2. In Captain Simpson's Statement, the portion of the diary relating to the
voyage from the Percy Islands to the Claremont Islands is omitted.</p>
<p>3. In "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" II, p. 263, after the words "pick them up," the
following passage seems to have been inadvertently left out:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"At 2 p.m., the tide commenced ebbing, the schooner
got under way and worked down towards the '<i>Freak</i>.' At half-past 6 p.m.,
the tide being down, the schooner anchored about 1 mile to the northward of us,
while I returned on board."</blockquote>
<p>Besides Carron's Narrative, some facts have been gleaned from documents in
the Parliamentary Library of New South Wales, to which I obtained access
through the courtesy of Mr. Charles Walsh, Parliamentary Librarian. Chief among
these are:&mdash;</p>
<p>(a) A notice of the arrival at Sydney, on 5th March, 1849, of the schooner
"<i>Ariel</i>" printed, together with an interview with the Survivors, in the
<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> of 6th March, 1849.</p>

the latter on 25th April. <i>Govt. Gazette</i>, Vol. XXVII, 1850, p. 336.</p>
<p>(e) Debate, 17th July, 1849 (reported in <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> of
18th) on Mr.Darvell's Motion to erect a Tablet to the Memory of Kennedy in St.
James' Church, Sydney.</p>
<p>Having carefully perused all the available material, I propose, in the pages
which follow, to tell the story as it appears to me, in the light of modern
maps. In other words, an attempt is made to ascertain where Kennedy was from
day to day and to compare my conclusions with the ideas held by Carron or
Jackey-Jackey as to his whereabouts. It must be remembered that although
Kennedy was an expert surveyor, and no doubt had provided himself with "blanks"
constructed from the then existing Admiralty charts, and plotted his work on
these blanks, this material, there is every reason to believe, has been
irretrievably lost, as has also his journal.</p>
<p>Kennedy's party consisted, besides the LEADER, of WILLIAM CARRON, Botanist;
THOMAS WALL, Naturalist; C. NIBLET, Storekeeper; JAMES LUFF <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> EDWARD TAYLOR and WILLIAM COSTIGAN, Carters; EDWARD
CARPENTER, Shepherd; WILLIAM GODDARD, THOMAS MITCHELL, <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> JOHN DOUGLAS and DENIS DUNN, Labourers; and
JACKEY-JACKEY, an aboriginal from the Hunter River; thirteen persons in all.
Kennedy seems to have had no misgivings about the unlucky number! There were
also 28 horses, 100 sheep, three kangaroo dogs and one sheep-dog. One ton of
flour, 600 lb. of sugar, 90 lb. of tea, 22 lb. of gunpowder, 130 lb. of shot, a
quarter-cask of ammunition, 588 feet of tether rope, 40 hobble chains and
straps, boxes and paper, etc., for preserving specimens, firearms, cloaks,
blankets, tomahawks, horse-shoes, cooking utensils, four tents and a canvas
sheep-fold constituted the chief items of the load, and there were, besides, 24
pack saddles and harness for nine draught horses. The greater part of the load
was to be carried in ONE HEAVY SQUARE CART and TWO SPRING CARTS, while each man
had a horse to ride and a spare horse in reserve. Some of the stores, which it
was not expected would be required before the arrival of the expedition at Cape
York, were repacked and sent on board the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" on 30th May.
After a good deal of rehearsal and experiment, A START was made on 5th June,
with seven pack-horses and three carts, carrying 21 cwt., drawn by nine horses.

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 206}</u></p>
<p>The large party, with its equipment, was LANDED AT TAM O'SHANTER POINT on
24th and 25th May, 1848. The tents were pitched in the form of a square, with
the SHEEP-FOLD in the centre, about 200 yards from the beach and near a
fresh-water creek. One HORSE was DROWNED in landing.</p>
<p>A party of NATIVES approached (24th May) and watched the landing of the
sheep with curiosity, and without displaying hostility.</p>
<p>KENNEDY and three others rode out to examine the country in advance of the
main party, leaving on 30th May and returning to the camp on 3rd June, HUXLEY
accompanying him part of the way. Kennedy came to the conclusion that a
get-away to the north or north-west was impossible because of swamps and dense
scrubs. Had he gone further north, the coast range coming down close to the sea
would have formed an insuperable barrier to his progress. If he had left the
sheep and carts behind and landed at Port Douglas he might have got away by the
now-existing road; but of course he knew nothing of the country before him.
Again, had he landed at Cardwell, 18 miles south of Tarn O'Shanter Point, and
made a road up a comparatively easy spur of the coast range, as George
Elphinstone Dalrymple did in 1864, he might have carried his expedition to a
successful issue.</p>
<p>It was most unfortunate that, before parting with the "<i>Tam O'Shanter</i>"
and "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" Kennedy did not make a <i>reconnaissance</i> to the
south. As it was, he started on 5th June, with an outfit of CARTS and SHEEP, to
penetrate a country equally unsuitable for the carriage of the one and the
feeding of the other.</p>
<p>The caravan had only gone two miles south when it met with a large tidal
river, which was then named the MACKAY on the Admiralty charts, but which has
since been named the HULL RIVER. A boat lent by the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>"
assisted in carrying the stores and some of the sheep across, while the horses
and the remainder of the sheep swam. The NATIVES assembled in great numbers to
watch the landing, but gave no trouble. Kennedy himself CAMPED, in the dark, on
the south side (right bank) of the river, whilst Carron and five others
recrossed for fresh water, with which they filled their kegs, returning to
Kennedy's camp at midnight.</p>
<p>On 6th June, LIEUTENANT SIMPSON, of the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>," left to rejoin
the ship, and the exploring party thereafter saw no more white faces. Carron
does not explain how the carts were got across the river, but says that early
in the morning they loaded the carts and pack-horses and travelled for 3 miles
inland, when they met with impassable swamps and returned to the beach and
resumed their southward course. In 2 miles (say 3) they reached, about dusk, a
second tidal river, larger than the first, the TULLY (subsequently named after
the Commissioner of Crown Lands, who took part in Dalrymple's expedition in
1864), and CAMPED on its left, or northern, bank.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 207}</u></p>
<p>In the morning of 7th June, a RAFT or punt was improvised by covering the
body of one of the carts with a tarpaulin, its buoyancy enhanced by air-filled
kegs and water-bags; and the tether-ropes having been tied together and made
fast on both banks, the punt was pulled from bank to bank. Most of the things
were thus got across during the day, and the party CAMPED, some on the right
and some on the left bank of the river.</p>
<p>8th June. The remaining baggage was transported across the river. The horses
also were taken across, not without difficulty. Nothing is said about the
sheep, which probably were ferried in the punt. The party camped on the right
bank of the river, near the beach.</p>
<p>9th June. With the exception of Kennedy, Jackey-Jackey and three others, the
party remained in camp, where they were visited by a great number of NATIVES,
who evinced no hostility.</p>
<p>10th June. Kennedy and his companions returned to the camp at night, having
found nothing but swamps and no practicable inland <i>route</i> for the
carts.</p>
<p>11th June. After about 4 miles of travelling southward along the beach, the
party came to another river, the MURRAY, and CAMPED. Near the river, they
explored an untenanted native camp, noting a shield, four wooden two-handed
swords, fishing lines, fish-hooks made of shells, cooking ovens of a now
well-known type, consisting of excavations nearly filled with stones, and
gourds for holding water.</p>
<p>12th June. Taylor having failed, owing to the strength of the ebbing tide,
to swim across with a rope, some NATIVES who had been observed fishing from
canoes were induced to take the rope across and make it fast on the right bank,
receiving a tomahawk for the service. It was 10 o'clock before the last of the
baggage had been punted across, by moonlight. The horses were led across a
quarter of a mile above the ferry, the operation being watched with interest by
several natives, who afterwards visited the camp and were presented with
fish-hooks. It may be assumed that the party CAMPED at night on the southern,
or right, bank of the river, and that the carts were got across somehow on the
following day, but Carron says nothing about these matters.</p>
<p>13th June. In the morning CARPENTER, the shepherd, was MISSING, and was
ascertained to have taken with him a damper weighing 11 lb., 10 lb. of sugar
and 2 lb. of tea. He was FOUND, after much searching, next day, in the act of
sharing the damper with a party of NATIVES. He expressed contrition, but,
according to Carron, "throughout the expedition he was of very little service,
being, in fact, little better than an idiot." Carpenter died at the Pascoe camp
on 26th November. It is well known that many Australian shepherds of the old
days went mad as a natural consequence of their lonely life. If Carpenter had
really been</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 208}</u></p>
<p>recruited from that class, it is more than likely that his mind was unhinged
by the new style of shepherding, with its attendant difficulties, to which he
had been introduced.</p>
<p>Carron mentions that on the 14th an ALLIGATOR rose to the surface of the
water close to the camp and appeared to have his eyes on the sheep. The unhappy
sheep were further disturbed by a pack of dogs belonging to the natives.</p>
<p>On 15th June, the party progressed 3 miles inland, and camped on the edge of
some fresh-water swamps. On this and the following day, Kennedy, with a small
party, endeavoured, without success, to find a way through the swamps. The camp
was broken up on 17th June, and a stage of 5 miles was made along the edge of
the swamp, the cart-wheels often sinking to the axles in the rotten ground.</p>
<p>The next day, Sunday, 18th June, was observed as a day of rest, the Leader
reading prayers at eleven.</p>
<p>19th-22nd June. Kennedy and five others explored unsuccessfully for a way
out of the swamps, and the Leader made up his mind to return to the beach.
There was heavy rain from the night of the 19th to the night of the 22nd. Two
of the horses left at the main camp were found bogged, and were extricated.
Parties of NATIVES, as many as 80 or 100, came and surveyed the main camp from
a distance.</p>
<p>23rd June. The expedition moved on southward by the beach, and presently
crossed a small tidal river (DALLACHY CREEK?), on a sand-bar near its mouth.
Turning inland for a short distance, they camped on the north, or left, bank of
"a small river" (WRECK CREEK) south of the last. Kennedy and five men spent the
next day (24th June) looking for a way out of the swamps, but without
success.</p>
<p>On 25th June, they accomplished 5 or 6 miles southward, near the beach, the
ground being rotten and sandy.</p>
<p>On 26th June, after a little distance southward along the beach, another
"small river "was met with, which Carron thought might be the same they had
left the day before (WRECK CREEK), but which must have been MEUNGA CREEK, 2
miles north of the modern town of CARDWELL. In crossing this creek, the carts
sunk into the mud, and had to be unloaded, the goods being carried ashore. In
this operation, a number of NATIVES, who had by this time learned to address
some of the party by name, assisted. One or two were detected in petty acts of
theft. The CAMP was made on a grassy rise, after cutting through half a mile of
mangroves.</p>
<p>On 27th June, a progress of 5 miles was made inland (west), the country
rising gradually and becoming dryer. Probably the night's CAMP was on MEUNGA
CREEK, where it turns south. On the 28th, a road had to be cut for 3 miles
west, through a</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 209}</u></p>
<p>thick scrub, after which a CAMP was made in open forest country. LUFF and
DOUGLAS were very ill with AGUE.</p>
<p>From 29th June to 1st July, Kennedy and three others, leaving the main camp,
explored 40 miles of country, having, as they believed, at last found the WAY
OUT. A fresh start was to have been made on Monday, 3rd July, but was delayed
by the continued ILLNESS of LUFF and DOUGLAS. The HORSES were GETTING WEAK and
the SHEEP were FALLING AWAY, and for this reason four days more were spent at
the camp. On 4th July, Kennedy and three others, roaming "some distance from
the camp," were ATTACKED BY NATIVES. "One spear was actually thrown, when Mr.
Kennedy, fearing for the safety of his party, ordered his men to FIRE upon
them. Four of the natives fell, but Mr. Kennedy could not ascertain whether
more than one was killed, as the other three were immediately carried off into
the scrub."</p>
<p>On 6th July the camp was broken up and the WESTWARD MARCH was resumed. Early
in the day two creeks were met with, running to the north-east. The second was
crossed with difficulty, the CARTS having to be lowered into its bed with ropes
and pulleys. The CAMP was made on the north, or left, bank, in hilly open
forest country, with a high range visible to the west.</p>
<p>On 7th July, small progress was made, owing to fallen timber which impeded
the carts. The evening CAMP was made on a creek with a large sandy bed. This
was, no doubt, what is now called KENNEDY CREEK, one of the heads of Meunga
Creek.</p>
<p>8th July. Cutting SCRUB on north side of Kennedy Creek. Small progress.
CAMPED in open forest country with large boulders of granite.</p>
<p>9th July (Sunday). Rest and prayers.</p>
<p>10th to 13th July. Travelling at an estimated rate of 3 to 5 miles per day
(probably less), cutting SCRUB and crossing many small creeks. I am convinced
that they must have taken an ENE. course till they had rounded MOUNT CARRUCHAN
(2,810 feet), as they could never have got the CARTS across the spur of the
range connecting that mountain with MOUNT ALMA (3,300 feet). These four days'
travelling probably brought them to DEEP CREEK or DUNDONALD CREEK, tributaries
of the MURRAY RIVER. On the 11th the party was visited by a small tribe of
NATIVES, "who appeared very friendly and did not stop long."</p>
<p>On 14th July, in crossing country which had the appearance of being
frequently inundated, ONE OF THE CARTS BROKE DOWN and had to be left behind. A
start had been made early in the morning, and at dusk THE OTHER TWO CARTS STUCK
FAST at the crossing of a small creek and some of the horses got bogged. It was
only two hours short of midnight when the loads were carried to a dry CAMP.</p>
<p>This experience finally convinced Kennedy that the CARTS were a useless
impediment, and he admitted that they had to be LEFT</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 210}</u></p>
<p>BEHIND. While it is impossible to withhold our admiration for the tenacity
of purpose with which he clung to his original plan, it is to be deplored that
he was not convinced of its hopelessness till forty days of incessant work and
worry had taken the heart out of man and beast. Certainly the horses never
recovered from the strain which had been put upon them at the beginning of the
journey.</p>
<p>The 15th and 17th July were devoted to rearranging the load for transport on
pack-saddles, a crosscut saw, pickaxes and various other articles being left
behind; among them Carron specially lamented his specimen-box. Sunday the 16th
was given to rest and prayers.</p>
<p>On 18th July, the company set out in the new order, "rejoicing," says
Carron, "to have got rid of one great impediment to our progress." He adds:
"The BLACKS regarded us with curious interest as we proceeded on our way,
forming a train of twenty-six horses, followed by the sheep, and Mitchell
occasionally sounding a horn he had brought with him." Little wonder that the
blacks were impressed by this outburst of innocent merriment ! But for the
absence of a score or so of banners, it might have been a Chinese procession.
Carron records that the SHEEP had by this time grown very thin and poor. "They
had, however, become so habituated to following the horses that they cost us
very little trouble in driving them." Thus is the wind tempered to the shorn
lamb ! On this day, after travelling about 6 miles (presumably NNW.) through
open forest land, the party camped near a creek on the edge of a thick
scrub.</p>
<p>For four days, from the 19th to the 22nd July, the march was continued over
mountainous country, with numerous belts of SCRUB, which had to be cut.
Considering the sheep, the scrub, the steep gullies and the inevitable
windings, the rate of progress may be estimated at 3 miles per day. SUNDAY, the
23rd was devoted to REST AND PRAYERS.</p>
<p>On 24th July, similar country was passed through, with occasional patches of
open forest, and the CAMP was pitched by a creek running to the north. One
HORSE, which had fallen lame, was shot. This would leave twenty-five. A tribe
of friendly NATIVES visited the camp. The creek was found to be one of two
branches of a river running to the south-east, the other running east, possibly
BEAR CREEK and DAVIDSON CREEK, affluents of the TULLY RIVER.</p>
<p>25th July. The party went up the creek (NW.) for 3 miles, having much scrub
to cut, and crossed the creek; here several horses fell among granite boulders.
Unable to get out of the scrub before dark, the party CAMPED and the horses
were tied up for the night. The next day is not accounted for by Carron.
Probably it was spent in hacking through the scrub for a short distance.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 211}</u></p>
<p>27th July. The greater part of the day was occupied in cutting scrub and
little progress was made. Eventually the creek was recrossed and a path was cut
to the top of a high hill on which there was grass for the horses. Here the
party spent the night, the horses being tethered lest they should fall down the
steep bank of the creek. A high granite range lay ahead.</p>
<p>28th July. No sooner had the HORSES been untethered than one of them fell
down 30 feet and was KILLED (twenty-four left). The party cut through the scrub
down the hill to the foot of the range, and camped.</p>
<p>29th July. Kennedy was out exploring the range, which was densely scrubby.
The following day being Sunday was spent in the usual manner. On Monday,
Kennedy took out Jackey-Jackey and four others, clearing a way up the mountain
through the scrub, a task which occupied them till Wednesday, 2nd August.</p>
<p>On 3rd August, the party climbed a spur of the range by the cleared track.
One horse was unable to do his part and was tied up to a tree and left behind,
the party going on a little further and CAMPING in the scrub. Next morning (4th
August), the whole of the horses, including the weak one, and the sheep, were
driven back to grass by Carron, Mitchell and Dunn, who camped beside them. At
the main camp, Niblet and three others remained to watch over the stores, while
Kennedy, Jackey-Jackey and four others formed an advance party cutting scrub.
The main camp was on the creek by which the party had camped on 24th July.</p>
<p>On 6th August, the party camping with the horses and sheep were visited by
seven or eight NATIVES, who ran away on seeing Carron shoot a bird which had
opportunely perched on a neighbouring tree.</p>
<p>Carron left his camp on 7th August with the sheep and horses, widening and
improving the partially cleared track made by the advance party, whom they
overtook on the 9th. At Carron' s camp on the night of the 8th, great
difficulty was experienced in lighting a fire, everything having been saturated
with rain, and he and his companions were copiously bled by LEECHES. I may say
that I have had a similar experience on the coast range further north, and that
the annoyance is something frightful. Carron left one horse, which was too weak
to travel, at his camp on the morning of the 7th, thus reducing the number to
twenty-three.</p>

<p>On 9th August, the united party reached the SUMMIT OF THE COAST RANGE, which
Kennedy estimated to be over 2,000 feet above sea-level, and CAMPED on the
western side of a small river, which must have been BLUNDER CREEK, a tributary
of the Herbert River, which falls into the south end of Rockingham Bay. (SEE
16-MiLE MAP OF QUEENSLAND, OR, PREFERABLY, THE 16-MILE INSET IN SKETCH MAP OF
THE WALSH AND TINAROO MINERAL FIELD, 1904: No. 181 OF GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
PUBLICATIONS.)</p>
<p>Sixty-six days of toil and hardship had brought the explorers into the
HERBERT VALLEY, their actual start for the north having been preceded by a long
and arduous journey in the opposite direction. Kennedy was, at this furthest
south, 2 miles from the site of Cardwell and within a few miles of the point
where, had he only known, he might have ascended the range by DALRYMPLE'S GAP
and then made his way with ease up the Herbert valley to the point which he had
at length reached with so much difficulty.</p>
<p>On 10th August, BLUNDER CREEK was crossed and the party camped on the right
bank, lat. 17&deg; 48' S. long.; 145&deg; 20' E. The horses swam across and the
sheep followed them "like dogs." A deep channel between two rocks was bridged
with three trees, over which the men carried the stores. "NIBLET, who had been
very UNWELL for three or four days, was taken much worse to-day."</p>
<p>Consideration for the horses kept the party in camp on the 11th. Five miles
of uneven open forest country were covered on the 12th, and the party CAMPED by
a chain of rocky water-holes, which must</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 213}</u></p>
<p>have been near the left, or southern, bank of QUAMBER CREEK(?). The 13th,
being Sunday, was given to rest and prayers.</p>
<p>Next day (14th August) it was found that NIBLET, the storekeeper, had been
APPROPRIATING STORES for himself and making false returns. Kennedy thereupon
gave the charge of this department to Carron and a weekly ration was directed
to be weighed out for the future. The FLOUR was found to have been reduced to
700 LB. Having started with 2,240 lb. on 5th June, about two-thirds had been
consumed in 70 days, or at the rate of about 118 lb. per man, which works out
at about 1.7 lb. per man per day. The future RATION was fixed at 50 lb. per
week for the thirteen men; equal to a little over half a pound per man per day.
In addition, there were to be served out weekly for the thirteen men: 12 lb. of
sugar and 2&frac34; lb. of tea; and, as before, a sheep was to be killed every
second day. Starting with 100 sheep, 35 would be eaten in the 70 days, and
allowing 5 more for losses, there would now be about 60 left.</p>
<p>The journey was resumed on 15th August, scrub having to be cut nearly all
day, and the party camped "by the side of a fine Casuarina creek coming from
the north-east." There can be no doubt that this was the WILD RIVER, the head
of the Herbert. The CAMP was probably about 4 miles above the modern WOODLEIGH
cattle station and 20 miles below the tin-mining township of HERBERTON, which
is now connected by RAILWAY with the port of Cairns, in Trinity Bay. One more
HORSE was ABANDONED, leaving twenty-two.</p>
<p>16th August. No reference is made by Carron to the crossing of the Wild
River, and the presumption is that it was forded without difficulty, as it may
be in many places. (MULLIGAN must have crossed KENNEDY'S TRACK here on 8th
June, 1875.) This day's stage, to the north-west probably, ended near the head
of NETTLE CREEK, a tributary of the Wild River and a prolific source of stream
tin in later years. One HORSE, too weak to travel further, was KILLED (leaving
twenty-one) and what flesh was on him was EATEN in two days, and the SAVING OF
ONE SHEEP for future consumption was effected. On the following day (17th),
only a short stage had been made when the party camped out of consideration for
the horses, there being rugged and broken country to the north-west. This
country, although the explorers were not aware of it&mdash;or at any rate
Carron was not&mdash;was the DIVIDE BETWEEN the rivers falling eastward into
the PACIFIC and westward into the GULF OF CARPENTARIA. The night's CAMP must
have been a little north of the modern tin-mining township of COOLGARRA and not
far from the present TELEGRAPH LINE and road from Coolgarra to Herberton.</p>
<p>On 18th August, the march was continued ACROSS THE DIVIDE and 4 miles
north-west till a camp was found "by the side of a fine river, with steep reedy
banks lined with large casuarinas and</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 214}</u></p>
<p>flooded-gum trees, and abundance of grass in the valley." The march was
difficult, one HORSE falling into a gully, to DIE next day, thus leaving only
twenty. The position of this CAMP is given as 17&deg; 30' S. and 145&deg; 12'
E., and if this is correct the camp would be down the valley a little below the
GLEN LINEDALE tin mines, Glen Linedale being one of the heads of EMU CREEK,
which falls into the Walsh River.</p>
<p>A halt on Saturday, 19th August, was substituted for the usual Sunday halt,
and the journey was resumed on the 20th. The expedition moved on to the
north-west during that and the three following days, camping on the 23rd by "a
creek running to the westward, with rather a broad bed and steep banks of
strong clay." The country traversed during the four days, in the valley of Emu
Creek, was undulating forest land, with red ant-hills, up to 10 feet in height,
on the sandy flats. About midway between the CAMPS of the 18th and 23rd, the
expedition's track is now crossed by the CHILLAGOE RAILWAY east of LAPPA LAPPA
JUNCTION. The district traversed between these two points is now thickly
studded with tin, copper and silver mines. The creek on which the CAMP was
pitched on 23rd August was the WALSH RIVER, about three miles below the mouth
of Eureka Creek.</p>
<p>When the party approached the camp, about a score of NATIVES made a friendly
visit and were presented with fish-hooks and a tin plate.</p>
<p>The camp having been pitched, Goddard and Jackey-Jackey went out to shoot
wallabies for the pot. They parted at a hill, which they agreed to round in
different directions, and meet. GODDARD, however, got LOST and did not reach
the camp till late next day, after the party had searched anxiously for him.
Only a short stage to the north-west was made that day (24th August), owing to
the late start. The march was probably continued northward on the 25th and
26th. Carron does not give the direction in which the party travelled; but it
was probably north, as they wished to go in that direction, and that it was
possible to do so was proved by Mulligan in 1874 (6th to 9th September). Carron
mentions only that three or four of the party suffered severely from eating
figs. It is now known that these native figs can be made more wholesome by a
period of burial, this method being practised by the blacks. (MULLIGAN'S CAMP
of 8th September, 1874, west of WOLFRAM CAMP, was probably on KENNEDY'S
footsteps of 25th August, 1848.)</p>
<p>27th August (Sunday). Prayers at eleven. Carron refers to the "poor
condition of the horses," saying that the wool from slaughtered sheep was
carefully saved to stuff saddles.</p>
<p>28th August. During this day's (presumably northward) march, a HORSE, too
weak to travel, was SHOT, and the meat saved for consumption. (This left
nineteen.) Only a short distance was</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 215}</u></p>
<p>covered, and the CAMP was pitched on a small creek, which I assume to be
MOUNT MULLIGAN CREEK, draining the south-eastern end of Mount Mulligan and
falling into the Hodgkinson River. (SEE MAP G.)</p>
<p>Another weak HORSE was ABANDONED before a start was made on 29th August,
leaving eighteen. The party CAMPED at night on the HODGKINSON RIVER, which was
not running, but had large water-holes.</p>
<p>On the 30th and 31st August and 1st September, the party followed the
HODGKINSON down the valley to the north-west, with much difficulty, owing to
the roughness of the country, the depth of the gullies and the density of the
scrub on the hills. On 2nd September, they left the river at a
bend&mdash;probably about 6 miles short of its junction with the Mitchell, and
in about 5 miles to the north-west CAMPED on the MITCHELL RIVER itself. They
had been under the impression that the Hodgkinson would lead them to Princess
Charlotte Bay. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>On Sunday, 3rd September, prayers were read as usual, and some of the party
hunted for food, bagging an emu, a kangaroo and some fish.</p>
<p>For six days (4th to 9th September), the party followed the MITCHELL to
west-north-west, sometimes in its bed and sometimes over hill-tops, being under
the impression that the river would lead them to Princess Charlotte Bay.
Kennedy's mountain BAROMETER was BROKEN, so that altitudes, for the future,
could only be guessed at. The CAMP of 9th September was on the river, probably
about the 144th meridian, where it is now crossed by the TELEGRAPH LINE between
the Walsh and Palmerville stations (HANN'S CAMPS 16 and 48, 1873).</p>
<p>There is no evidence in Carron's narrative that Kennedy identified this
river with Leichhardt's Mitchell, and, of course, Kennedy was many leagues
higher up the river than Leichhardt had been. The mere fact that he expected it
to lead him to Princess Charlotte Bay proves that he considered it a different
river.</p>
<p>Kennedy must by this time have been convinced that he had gone far enough
west if he was to strike Princess Charlotte Bay, where the relief ship was
awaiting him. On 5th September, while they were travelling down the Mitchell,
Carron says: "We were now in the vicinity of CAPE TRIBULATION." Possibly
Kennedy may have told him they were near the latitude of that cape, but they
must then have been at least 80 miles west of it. The Leader now (10th August)
ALTERED his COURSE from NW. to N.: in fact, he took the <i>route</i> which HANN
followed in 1872 and MULLIGAN in 1873, and which is now followed by the
TELEGRAPH LINE from the Walsh to the Palmer.</p>
<blockquote>[1) MULLIGAN'S journey of 2nd and 3rd September, 1874, practically
covered the same ground as KENNEDY'S of 28th August to 2nd September,
1848.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 216}</u></p>
<p>The 10th September was a Sunday, and although the party was on the march,
there were "prayers as usual at eleven o'clock." Exactly twelve hours later,
three SPEARS were thrown into the camp, and were answered by a few SHOTS fired
in the dark, but no casualties appear to have resulted on either side.</p>
<p>From the 11th to the 14th September, the course was north, over "rotten,"
but fairly level, country, partly liable to inundation and occasionally with
small grass-covered hillocks, among which the failing horses continually
stumbled and fell. A camp was surprised and the NATIVES having fled in alarm, a
half-cooked chestnut cake and some pandanus fruit were taken away, fish-hooks
being left in compensation. The pandanus did not prove satisfactory because of
its laxative properties and its tendency to produce violent headache. It might
have been better, after all, to have eaten the fish-hooks and left the pandanus
to the natives. On the 15th, the party crossed the PALMER RIVER and CAMPED on
its right, or northern, bank, opposite the site of the future PALMERVILLE. The
Hodgkinson, Walsh and Palmer are, of course, designated by names bestowed long
after Kennedy's day. By what name he distinguished them will never be
known.</p>
<p>After the camp had been pitched, a party caught a few fish in the river.
Towards evening, six or eight NATIVES threatened the camp, shipping their
SPEARS in throwing-sticks (wimmeras). An endeavour to convince the intruders
that hostility was not intended was construed into an indication of fear and
the advance was continued, whereupon the white men FIRED. No one was hurt, and
the invaders retired, but only to go and attack the fishing party. Here again
they met a determined defence, and they only fled after they had been fired
on.</p>
<p>The party remained in camp on the following day (16th September), when they
were again ATTACKED, this time by 12 or 14 NATIVES, armed with spears and
boomerangs.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Their bodies were painted," says Carron, "with a
yellowish earth, which, with their warlike gestures, made them look very
ferocious. The grass in the position they had taken up was very long and very
dry, quite up to the edge of the gully; they set it on fire in three or four
places, and the wind blowing from them to us, it burned very rapidly. Thinking
we should be frightened by this display, they followed the fire with their
spears shipped, making a most hideous noise, and with the most savage gestures.
Knowing the fire could not reach us, as there was nothing to burn on our side
of the gully, we drew up towards them with our firearms prepared. They
approached near enough to throw three spears into our camp, one of which went
quite through one of our tents. No one was hurt, but a few of our party fired
at them; we could not tell whether any were wounded, as they disappeared almost
immediately. We kept three on watch this night for fear of the
natives."</blockquote>
<p>It does not appear that Kennedy or any of his party prospected the Palmer,
or had any suspicion of the presence of GOLD, which was to be so amply
demonstrated by the subsequent explorations of HANN and MULLIGAN.</p>

<p><b>(SEE MAP G.)</b></p>
<p>From the 17th to 21st September, inclusive, the course is given by Carron as
north-west; more probably it was north-west to begin with, and then veered
round to the west until a gap was found in the "CONGLOMERATE RANGE," which
bounds the Palmer valley on the north&mdash;likely enough the same gap which
was subsequently made use of by "MACMILLAN'S ROAD," and then the north-western
course was resumed, to be changed to a northern as soon as the nature of the
ground permitted. "There was," says Carron, "occasionally fair travelling over
stiff soil intersected by many creeks, most of</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 218}</u></p>
<p>them dry, but we were everywhere able to find water at intervals of a few
miles. We passed over some ironstone ridges and rocky hills covered with
<i>Callitris</i>, <i>Cochlospermum</i> and <i>Sterculia</i>"</p>
<p>After clearing the gap and getting on the "Conglomerate" tableland, Kennedy
was on PACIFIC WATERS, and must have crossed the heads (here no more than
rivulets) of the river to which his name was afterwards given, and which is
popularly believed to have been followed by him northward to Princess Charlotte
Bay. That this idea is erroneous is evident when we consider that his course
was nearly north, while the Kennedy River presently turns sharply to the
north-east. A few miles to the north would take him out of the catchment area
of the Kennedy. It should therefore be understood that the KENNEDY RIVER was
NAMED IN HONOUR OF KENNEDY, but was not, as is supposed, traced by him from its
head to the ocean. (SEE MAP E.)</p>
<p>On 22nd September, the explorers "crossed a creek running eastward" and
CAMPED. This was, in all probability, WANGOW CREEK. The CAMP of 23rd September
was on the same creek, at a point where it ran temporarily south-west. My first
camp on my second Cape York Peninsula expedition must have been close to this
camp of Kennedy's.</p>
<p>Kennedy crossed to the right bank of the creek next morning, and as the
creek was running south-west, he supposed it to be an affluent of the Palmer
(Carron, p. 193). He had not yet grasped the idea that he was now at last on
PRINCESS CHARLOTTE BAY WATERS. By this time the heat had become intense,
noonday shade temperatures of 95 to 100 degrees Fahr. being recorded, and this
must have added greatly to the distress of the surviving horses.</p>
<p>The description of the country traversed (northward) on the 24th and 25th is
that which is typical of the sandstone tablelands in these latitudes.</p>
<p>On the morning of 25th September, three HORSES were MISSING, and four men
were left behind to search for them, while the rest of the party moved on. At
night, a CAMP was made on a large water-hole. One of the four men came in,
stating that the other three had halted for the night. Carron, by Kennedy's
instructions, went back and led them (and presumably also the lost horses) to
the camp in the dark. The best KANGAROO DOG failed to reach this camp, having
been overpowered by the heat. He crawled into the camp of the 28th, 30 miles
on, but DIED next day.</p>
<p>On 26th September, Kennedy's CAMP was fixed "in a sandy creek where the
country seemed to fall slightly to the north-east." Kennedy was still under the
impression that the waters he was meeting with ran into the Mitchell,
<i>via</i> the Palmer, and "still hoped to find a river running into Princess
Charlotte Bay." As a matter of fact, he had been on such rivers for several
days without</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 219}</u></p>
<p>being aware of it; but the valleys on sandstone tablelands are not, as a
rule, separated by "ranges." The "sandy creek" of the CAMP of 26th September
was the "STATION CREEK" of modern maps, about 5 miles south of MULLIGAN'S ROUTE
(1875), between his 80th and 81st camps, and which he (Mulligan) named the
WARNER RIVER.</p>
<p>In this place it becomes necessary to refer once more to the comedy of
errors arising out of the multiplication of "Kennedy" Rivers and Creeks. The
river which Kennedy is supposed to have followed down towards Princess
Charlotte Bay is placed in Carron's sketch map on the 144th meridian of east
latitude, and this was, of course, the only river in these parts then known to
geographers. In what is practically the same map, attached to A. J.
Richardson's <i>Overland Expedition from Port Denison to Cape York under the
Command of F. and A. Jardine, Esqrs., in 1865</i>, this river appears as the
"Kennedy River." It was not known, even at that date, that quite a number of
rivers run northward into Princess Charlotte Bay, their mouths anastomosing
when they reach the coastal plain. From east to west, these now appear on the
maps as the Laura River, Normanby River, Kennedy Creek, Kennedy River, North
Kennedy River and Hann River. The first of the "Kennedy" group, <i>viz</i>.,
Kennedy Creek, might advantageously be renamed. The Kennedy River, long known
as such by the thousands who have come and gone between Cooktown and the
Palmer, and the largest of the group, should retain the name of the revered
explorer who was the first to reach Princess Charlotte Bay by land. To the
whole of the so-called North Kennedy, the name of Therrimburi Creek, which is
borne by its upper reach, should be applied. It was BETWEEN THERRIMBURI CREEK
AND THE HANN RIVER (named by Mulligan) that KENNEDY TRAVELLED northward in
1848.</p>
<p>On 27th September, the party travelled over sandy ridges and marshy flats
subject to inundation. The CAMP was made at a rocky creek containing very
little water, probably the WARNER RIVER (STATION CREEK), where it takes an
easterly course before falling into the so-called "North Kennedy River"
(Therrimburi Creek). The SALT WATER came up the creek to the camp, but fresh
water was obtained in a lagoon.</p>
<p>For the next two days (28th and 29th September), a halt was necessitated by
the STRAYING of the SHEEP.</p>
<p>The SHEEP are only once again referred to in Carron's narrative,
<i>viz</i>., on 11th November, when the last was killed at the Pascoe camp, and
it may be surmised that the majority were finally LOST here, as the party
evidently subsisted for the rest of the way to the Pascoe mainly on horseflesh,
a little flour and what game they could shoot. When we last took stock of the
sheep, on 14th August, 60 were left of the original 100. Since that date,
reckoning</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 220}</u></p>
<p>the consumption at one in two days, and balancing losses while travelling by
economies made possible by the capture of game, there should have been 38 left
on 27th September.</p>
<p>Two NATIVES were seen, carrying spears, on 28th September.</p>
<p>On 30th September, the expedition moved on for 5 or 6 miles to the west,
across a plain, when, finding a dry lagoon where a supply of water was
expected, they RETURNED to the camp on STATION CREEK. Nothing is said of the
SHEEP, but the poor animals must have been about equally unfortunate whether
they had to be left where there was no water or were driven 10 or 12 miles back
in the summer heat.</p>
<p>The 1st of October, being Sunday, was spent in rest and prayer. Next day
(2nd October), the party again crossed the plain westward, the NATIVES BURNING
THE GRASS behind them, so that they were glad to hurry on to a patch which had
already been burned. They must have reached water, probably in the HANN RIVER,
about the place where I crossed it on 4th September, 1879. One horse, too weak
to travel, was bled, and his blood was mixed with flour and made into a
pudding. The HORSE DIED next day, and his flesh was prepared for food. This
left seventeen horses alive. The STRENGTH OF THE MEN WAS DECLINING, and it is
sad to record that their morals also had been sapped by privation and toil, so
that, to guard against selfish peculation, it became necessary to watch the
horseflesh when it was drying in the sun.</p>
<p>When the march to the north-west was resumed on 4th October, JANE'S
TABLELAND <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> was in sight. It appears in
Arrowsmith's map, issued in 1838. I saw this tableland on 4th September, 1879.
It is impossible, from Carron's journal, to account satisfactorily for the
whole of the 4th, 5th and 6th October (1848), but on the afternoon of the 6th
the CAMP was pitched near "a salt-water creek," which is probably that now
shown on the maps as "SALTWATER CREEK," and which was known as such to the
diggers who rushed the "Coen" in 1878. My track from the Hann River to
Saltwater Creek, on 4th September, 1879, probably coincided with Kennedy's.</p>
<p>Near the explorers' camp of 6th October, a NATIVE CAMP was inspected in the
absence of its owners. There were seven or eight conical huts built of saplings
and lined inside with woven strips of bamboo and covered outside with palm
leaves. It was obviously a camp designed to keep out rain in the wet season. In
the huts were stone ovens, fishing-nets and pieces of BOTTLEGLASS.</p>
<p>On 7th, 8th and 9th October, the march was continued NNW. to "a river
running into Princess Charlotte Bay, in lat. 14&deg; 30' S. and long. 143&deg;
56'," which must have been the ANNIE RIVER, if the latitude is correct. The
longitude given is evidently about</p>
<blockquote>[1) This conspicuous table was probably named by King, in the
"<i>Bathurst</i>," in 1821.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 221}</u></p>
<p>10 minutes too far east, as the river was crossed 12 or 14 miles from the
sea, where the water was only brackish.</p>
<p>During the midday halt on 10th October, the party were visited by a large
number of NATIVES, including women, who had been collecting the fruit of the
nondah. When the march was resumed, says Carron, "the natives followed us at
some distance, continually THROWING SPEARS after us for some time: one was
thrown into the thigh of a horse, but, fortunately, not being barbed, was taken
out, and the horse was not much injured. We then rode after them in two or
three directions, and FIRED at them, when they left us, and we saw no more of
them."</p>
<p>On the 11th, when halting in a place where there was no water, the
travellers were visited by NATIVES, who, in exchange for fish-hooks, brought
water in bark vessels, and left quietly.</p>
<p>I am unable to place Kennedy's camps between the 9th and 20th of October,
but it is evident that he must have travelled north-north-west and kept as
close to the west coast of PRINCESS CHARLOTTE BAY as the mangroves and
salt-water creeks and swamps permitted. In all probability, from the ANNIE to
the STEWART RIVER, his <i>route</i> was near perhaps a little west of that
followed by William Hann on his "home" trip, 5th to 8th September, 1872,
between his camps Nos. 32 and 35. (SEE MAP C.)</p>
<p>On 13th October, a last unsuccessful attempt was made to penetrate the
mangroves to the beach. It may be surmised that this was somewhere near the
latitude of the Rattlesnake Reefs. H.M.S. "<i>Bramble</i>" was to have been in
Princess Charlotte Bay in the beginning of August, and Kennedy was satisfied
that the ship must have come and gone, and that relief was no longer to be
expected.</p>
<p>On the 15th (Sunday), there were "prayers as usual at 11 o'clock," and the
sugar was finished. Next day (16th) a horse which fell into a rocky water-hole
was killed and his flesh was dried in the sun. This left sixteen horses, for
the most part too exhausted to carry loads, and the horses were now driven on
chiefly for food. One tent and other useless articles of baggage were left
behind.</p>
<p>In the four days, 16th to 20th October, the march continued across the
creeks which drain the eastern side of the MC!LWRAITH RANGE, including the
valleys of the Rocky River, Scrubby Creek and Chester River, which now form the
ROCKY RIVER GOLDFIELD. It is noted on the 19th that "several of our horses were
now quite unable to carry anything but the saddle." On the following day the
party "passed over a piece of stiff ground about two miles in extent, which
appeared to have been the scene of a devastating HURRICANE. The ground was
covered with fallen timber, which rendered it very difficult to cross. The wind
must have swept from the south-west to the north-east, and from the appearance
of the saplings which were growing from the stumps of some of</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 222}</u></p>
<p>the trees which had been broken, this terrific storm appeared to have taken
place about two years ago. Not a tree had been left standing...Many of the
trees in the middle of the fallen timber measured two feet in diameter. Some
were torn up by the roots, and the trunks of others were snapped off at various
heights from the ground." It is interesting to compare this description with
that of the cyclone-swept clearing seen by me on 20th February, 1880.</p>
<p>Kennedy's camp of 20th October was in 13&deg; 35' S. lat., which was
probably in the valley between the McIlwraith and Macrossan Ranges, south of
the mouth of the NISBET RIVER. It is safe to assume that Kennedy followed this
valley, which not only affords an easy passage to the north, but is practically
the only one.</p>
<p>On the 22nd October, only a short stage was made, three of the party,
Douglas, Taylor and Costigan, who were suffering from diarrhoea, being
compelled to ride, in spite of the weakness of the horses. The flour was found
to be reduced to 200 lb. In 70 days which had passed since it was weighed at
700 lb., the 13 men had consumed 500 lb., or at the rate of 0.55 lb. per man
per day, so that they must have kept strictly to the ration fixed on 14th
August. The three sick men "complained despairingly to Mr. Kennedy that they
should NEVER BE ABLE TO REACH CAPE YORK"&mdash;and they never did. The
travelling this day is briefly described as "between the hills," which makes it
almost certain that the party was between the McIlwraith and Macrossan Ranges,
and now ascending the valley of the NISBET RIVER. The blacks were burning the
grass to the south.</p>
<p>In the six following days, 23rd to 28th October, the expedition travelled
over "a rocky mountainous country, interspersed with deep gullies and creeks,
fringed with belts of scrub." Kennedy must have got up on the eastern slopes of
the MC!LWRAITH RANGE, crossing Swallow, Cherry, Surprise and Greyhound Creeks.
Had he but known, he might have found an ideal natural road by running the
Nisbet River to its head and crossing into the Lockhart Valley by an almost
imperceptible gap.</p>
<p>In all probability, when I was attacked on 9th January, 1880, and my horse
was killed by the blacks, I was standing on Kennedy's footsteps. I probably
also followed his track on 18th January, 1880, between my Camps 25 and 26.
Dickie, Dick and Sheffield's "home" track, as far as it went NNW. from Cherry
Creek, in 1910, was probably also Kennedy's.</p>
<p>29th October. This was Sunday and there were "prayers at eleven o'clock" and
three wallabies were shot to eke out the scanty food supply. The party remained
in camp, and the horses must have needed rest.</p>
<p>30th October. Luff was too lame to walk. Here the two last of the round
tents were burned to lighten the load and enable Luff</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 223}</u></p>
<p>to ride. The party had left Rockingham Bay with a 6 ft. by 8 ft. tent for
Kennedy and two large tents and a small round one for the others.</p>
<p>It is doubtful, from the wording of Carron's narrative, whether the party
left camp on the 1st and 2nd November. One more horse was killed, leaving
fifteen.</p>
<p>Very little progress was made on 3rd November, the party having had to cut
through scrub intersected by deep gullies and rocky hills. In the afternoon
they reached "a small river, with very uneven rocky bottom, running southerly,"
with a rapid current swollen by a recent rainfall. There can be no doubt that
this was the upper portion of the PASCOE RIVER, the only stream with a
southerly fall in these parts. (Here I crossed his track, in 1880, between my
Camps 31 and 32, and again between Camps 32 and 33.) The Pascoe, it may be
remarked, has a singular course. Rising in the centre of the Janet Range, it
first runs south-south-east and south for 14 miles, then west for 20 miles, due
north for 16 miles, north-east for 17 miles, and finally east for 10 miles,
when it falls into Weymouth Bay.</p>
<p>On reaching the Pascoe, five of the horses, including the one carrying
CARRON'S BOTANICAL SPECIMENS AND SEEDS, fell in crossing the river, but the
specimens were recovered. The night's camp was in a thick bamboo scrub by the
side of the river, the HORSES being TIED TO TREES.</p>
<p>On the 4th November, the camp was not moved. Jackey-Jackey climbed a hill
and saw grass ahead, and shot a cassowary. Mr. Wall failed to preserve the skin
"properly." Greater misfortunes were to follow.</p>
<p>While admiring the persistency with which the botanist and naturalist kept
their object before them, one cannot help wondering whether they had not lost
all sense of proportion. To load even a single horse with specimens at the same
time that they were daily throwing away the necessaries of life seems a
questionable proceeding.</p>
<p>On 5th November, the camp was moved to the hill from which Jackey-Jackey had
seen the grass, and another horse was killed, leaving fourteen. A halt was made
at this hill on 6th November, and two more horses were killed, leaving twelve.
The condition of the remaining horses, which had, apparently, not eaten for
four days, may be imagined.</p>
<p>On 7th and 8th November, travelling over "very rough rocky ground,
intersected with gullies and belts of scrub, the head of the PASCOE <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> was reached.</p>
<p>On 9th November, starting without breakfast, having had no</p>
<blockquote>[1) This river was afterwards named in honour of Lieutenant Pascoe,
the officer in command of the party of marines who arrived at Somerset on 25th
March, 1863.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 224}</u></p>
<p>water to bake with, the party got over a gap and into a creek running to the
north. They must have threaded their way among the peaks afterwards named SOUTH
PAP, NORTH PAP, MOUNT DOBSON and MOUNT NELSON&mdash;probably west of the "Paps"
and east of the "Mounts." They ran the creek down, and in the evening found
water in its bed and camped. (SEE MAP B.)</p>
<p>On 10th November, the expedition moved about three miles northward down the
valley of the creek and camped near a spot where a great number of pandanus
trees were growing. On the 11th, a further progress of 2 or 3 miles was made to
the north; the creek was crossed where it turned eastward and showed the
influence of the tide; and the party camped. This day the LAST SHEEP presumably
the only one that had reached the camp&mdash;was KILLED.</p>
<p>The camp was visited by several NATIVES, who conducted themselves peaceably,
having been gratified by presents of a tin plate and fish-hooks and impressed
by the shooting of fourteen or fifteen hawks. One of the dogs killed a puppy
belonging to the natives, and the puppy was eaten by Dunn, Luff, Costigan and
Goddard.</p>
<p>On Sunday, 12th November, there were "prayers at eleven." Carron and
Jackey-Jackey walked to the beach in the hope of finding a supply of salt, but
were disappointed.</p>
<p>On 13th November, the camp was shifted to a more suitable position on the
right or southern bank of the creek, at the foot of a high bare hill. The hill
was evidently what appears in the Admiralty Chart of 1897 as BARRETT HILL, the
camp being at the northern end of the hill. Carron gives its latitude as
12&deg; 35' S., but it is really 12&deg; 31'.</p>
<p>Kennedy was constitutionally averse to admitting his defeat and hard to
convince; but he had at last been satisfied by the unanswerable logic of facts
that it was impossible to complete the journey as he had originally planned. He
now made preparations for a DASH TO CAPE YORK, from which he hoped to bring
speedy relief to the party left in charge of CARRON at the dep&ocirc;t on the
PASCOE RIVER, near its outfall into Weymouth Bay.</p>
<p>A short distance below the dep&ocirc;t, the creek which had been followed
down from 9th November becomes a tidal inlet and joins the PASCOE RIVER. The
river itself is little more than a mile north of the camp of the 11th. North of
the river, a range of mountains extends north-westward, by Fair Cape to Temple
Bay. To this I gave the name of the CARRON RANGE (see my Diary of 11th
February, 1880). According to the Admiralty Chart of 1897, individual peaks of
the range are now named WALL HILL, HUXLEY HILL, STANLEY HILL, KENNEDY HILL (the
highest point, 1,440 feet) and CARRON HILL (1,380 feet). <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> South of the river mouth lies</p>
<blockquote>[1) Names given by the officers of the surveying ships
"<i>Palutna</i>" and "<i>Dart</i>," 1890-8. See the chapters on Minutiae of
Marine Surveys.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 225}</u></p>
<p>the mountain mass which I named the JANET RANGE in 1880. Individual points
now appear on the chart, including SIMPSON HILL at the mouth of the Pascoe,
BARRETT HILL (on the north end of which was Carron's dep&ocirc;t), the ROUND
BACK HILLS, near Cape Weymouth, MOUNT TOZER (the highest point, 1,953 feet),
the "SOUTH" and "NORTH" PAPS, MOUNT DOBSON, MOUNT NELSON and the GODDARD HiLLS.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The names commemorate Kennedy's expedition,
the voyage of the relief ship "<i>Ariel</i>" (1848), the voyage of the
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" and the administration of two Premiers of Queensland, Sir
Horace Tozer and Sir Hugh Nelson.</p>
<p>Kennedy and Carron took stock of the PROVISIONS remaining on 13th November,
which consisted of 46 lb. of flour, 75 lb. of dried horseflesh and 1 lb. of
tea. The consumption of flour since stock was taken on 23rd October had been at
the rate of 0.7 lb. per man per day.</p>
<p>The twenty-seven HORSES with which the expedition set out from Rockingham
Bay had now been reduced to NINE. There were, apparently, twelve on 6th
November, so that three are unaccounted for. They either died in the passage of
the Janet Range, or Carron omitted to mention some deaths or losses when they
took place.</p>
<p>KENNEDY TOOK with him SEVEN of the HORSES, the 75 lb. of HORSEFLESH, 18 lb.
of FLOUR and half a pound of TEA. CARRON and his party were left with 28 lb. of
FLOUR, half a pound of TEA and two HORSES, which were to be killed for food as
occasion required. He was instructed to make his provisions last for six weeks.
Besides Carron, the party left at the dep&ocirc;t consisted of Wall, Niblet,
Taylor, Carpenter, Goddard, Mitchell and Douglas. Those eight men were to wait
in camp for the relief which Kennedy hoped to bring them by water in fourteen
days at the earliest. Kennedy expected to meet H.M.S. "<i>Bramble</i>" at Port
Albany and to have a party sent out at once to Weymouth Bay by sea.</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald Meston in his <i>Report on the Aboriginals of Queensland</i>,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> states that in 1896 he mustered the blacks of
the district surrounding Moreton Telegraph Station, and adds: "One old fellow
remembered Kennedy's expedition of 1848 and all the fatal circumstances of the
last sad days. He said Kennedy had been shooting blacks all along his
track."</p>
<p>If that old black really saw the Kennedy expedition forty-eight years before
he told the story, there can be no doubt that he exaggerated grossly. Carron
records only two instances (16th September and 10th October, 1848) when
Kennedy's party used firearms in self-defence. If there was any foundation for

Jardine expeditions. Supposing him to have been ten years old in 1848, he would
be fifty-eight when Meston interviewed him, and at fifty-eight an Australian
aborigine is in his dotage. The accuracy of such a person's recollection of
dates, figures or names would be open to grave doubt.</p>

<p>KENNEDY, accompanied by COSTIGAN, DUNN, LUFF and JACKEY-JACKEY, LEFT THE
PASCOE DEP&Ocirc;T on 13th November, 1848. On 22nd December, JACKEY-JACKEY, the
sole survivor of the party, having been forty days on the journey, ARRIVED AT
CAPE YORK and he was taken on board the "<i>Ariel</i>" on the following
morning. The "<i>Ariel</i>" sailed the same evening bent on relief, and Dr.
ADONIAH VALLACK, who was on board, committed JACKEY-JACKEY'S DEPOSITION to
writing. This deposition is a document of the utmost value, not only because it
is almost the only record of Kennedy's last journey, but also because it throws
light on the aboriginal mind and its limitations. I have myself on many
occasions been under the necessity of eliciting information from aboriginals,
and my experience is that a very short course of interrogation is sufficient to
confuse and give them brain-fag, which generally ends in sulks, so that it is
difficult or impossible to obtain from them a consecutive tale. Jackey-Jackey's
"Statement" is a marked instance of this limitation, and it is evident that Dr.
Vallack, tactful as he was, gave up the attempt to pin the hero of the tale
down to dates. Moreover, the poor fellow was DISTRACTED,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 228}</u></p>
<p>WEAK from wounds and fatigue, and STARVING, and was probably UNCONSCIOUS for
a considerable part of the eventful forty days; and thus could not be expected
to take note of the divisions of time in such a manner as to satisfy either a
Justice of the Peace or an historian.</p>
<p>As the "Statement," for what it is worth, must form the text from which any
conclusions whatever regarding the last days of Kennedy's career must be drawn,
it is given below in its entirety; but I have added my conjectures as to dates
in notes within the text and appended explanatory footnotes.</p>
<h4>STATEMENT OF JACKEY-JACKEY</h4>
<h5>MADE BY HIM ON BOARD THE "ARIEL," AND WRITTEN DOWN BY DR. VALLACK</h5>
<h5>(SEE MAP B)</h5>
<p>I STARTED WITH MR. KENNEDY from Weymouth Bay for Cape York, on the 13th
November, 1848, accompanied by COSTIGAN, DUNN, AND LUFF, leaving eight men at
the camp, at Weymouth Bay. We went on till we came to a RIVER <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> which empties itself into Weymouth Bay. A little
further north we crossed the river [13th November]; next morning a lot of
NATIVES camped on the other side of the river. Mr. Kennedy and the rest of us
went on a VERY HIGH HILL <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> and came to a flat on
the other side and camped there [14th November]; I went on a good way next day
[15th November]; a HORSE FELL down a creek; the FLOUR we took with us LASTED
THREE DAYS; we had much trouble in getting the horse out of the creek; we went
on, and came out, and camped [16th November] on the ridges; we had NO WATER.
Next morning went on and LUFF was taken ILL with a very bad knee; we left him
behind, and Dunn went back again and brought him on [17th November]; Luff was
riding a horse named Fiddler; then we went on and camped at a little creek
<b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> [18th November]; the flour being out this day
we commenced EATING HORSEFLESH, which Carron gave us when we left Weymouth Bay;
as we went on we came on a small river, <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b> and
saw no blacks there; as we proceeded we gathered NONDAS, and lived upon them
and the meat; we stopped at a little creek <b style="color:#603000">[5]</b> and
it came on raining, and COSTIGAN SHOT HIMSELF; <b style="color:#603000">[6]</b>
in putting his saddle under the tarpaulin a string caught the trigger and the
ball went in under the right arm and came out at his back under the shoulder;
we went on this morning all of us, and stopped at another creek in the evening
[19th November], and the next morning <b style="color:#603000">[7]</b> we
KILLED A HORSE named Browney, smoked him that night [20th November], and went
on next day, taking as much of the horse as we could with us, and went on about
a mile and then turned back again to where we killed the horse, because
Costigan was very bad and in much pain; we went back again because there was no
water; then Mr. Kennedy and I had dinner there and went on in the afternoon
[21st November], LEAVING DUNN, COSTIGAN AND LUFF at the creek. This was at
Pudding-Pan Hill,</p>

was to differentiate Sunday from week-days. The date would therefore be the

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 229}</u></p>
<p>near Shelburne Bay. MR. KENNEDY CALLED IT PUDDING-PAN HiLL. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> We left some horse meat with the three men at
Pudding-Pan Hill and carried some with us on a pack-horse. Mr. Kennedy wanted
to make great haste when he left this place, in order to get the doctor to go
down to the men that were ill. This was about three weeks after leaving
Weymouth Bay. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> ONE HORSE was LEFT with the
three men at Pudding-Pan Hill, and WE (Kennedy and myself) took with us THREE
HORSES. <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> The three men were to remain there
until Mr. Kennedy and myself had gone to and returned from Cape York for them.
Mr. Kennedy told Luff and Dunn when he left them, if Costigan died they were to
come along the beach till they saw the ship, and then to fire a gun; he told
them he would not be long away, so it was not likely they would move from there
for some time. They stopped to take care of the man that was shot; we (me and
Mr. Kennedy) KILLED A HORSE for them before we came away. Having LEFT THESE
THREE MEN, we camped that night [21st November] where there was no water;
<b style="color:#603000">[4]</b> next morning Mr. Kennedy and me went on with
the FOUR HORSES: <b style="color:#603000">[5]</b> two pack-horses and two
saddle-horses; ONE HORSE got BOGGED in a swamp. We tried to get him out all
day, but could not; we LEFT HIM there, <b style="color:#603000">[6]</b> and
camped at another creek <b style="color:#603000">[7]</b> [22nd November]. The
next day Mr. Kennedy and I went on again, and passed up a ridge very scrubby
and had to turn back again, and went along gulleys to get clear of the creek
and scrub. <b style="color:#603000">[8]</b> Now it rained and we camped
<b style="color:#603000">[9]</b> [23rd November}; there were plenty of BLACKS
here, but we did not see them, but plenty of fresh tracks, and camps, and
smoke. <b style="color:#603000">[10]</b> Next morning we went on and camped
at</p>
<blockquote>[1) It is clear, from subsequent events, that Kennedy was mistaken
in his position and believed that he was at the Pudding-Pan Hill of the Charts
(named by Bligh) when he was actually 50 miles south of it. As far as
appearance goes, any one of the numerous fragmentary Desert Sandstone
tablelands might be supposed to bear a fanciful resemblance to an inverted
"pudding-pan." All the known circumstances are in favour of Kennedy's so-called
Pudding-Pan Hill being west of Cape Grenville. The probability is that it was
the "Sandstone Table" sketched by me on 25th February, 1880, in 12&deg; 1' S.
lat. and 142&deg; 34' E. long. Jackey-Jackey's petulant remark: "Mr. Kennedy
called it Pudding-Pan Hill "was evidently his reply to cross-examination when
the spot where the men had been left had become the question of the hour in the
minds of the officers of the relief ship.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Jackey-Jackey has accounted for only nine days. They probably
seemed like three weeks to him, and his arithmetic was defective.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) Jackey-Jackey breaking down under the strain of prolonged
cross-interrogation and his memory and arithmetic hazy. He states on the
21st&mdash;no doubt correctly&mdash;that he and Kennedy left the so-called
Pudding-Pan Hill with two pack-horses and two saddle-horses.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[4) Say near Middle Peak, 11&deg; 56' S. lat., 142&deg; 52' E.

<blockquote>[5) They left the Pascoe with seven horses. One was killed on 19th
November, one live horse and one which was killed for food were left with the
party at the so-called Pudding-Pan Hill on 20th. Four were now left to go on
with Kennedy.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[6) This leaves three horses alive.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[7) Say 11&deg; 47' S. lat. and 142&deg; 50' E. long.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[8) The description of this country, with its bogs and scrub,
corresponds with that of the country where my own party were in great
difficulties from the same cause (involving starvation for the horses) between
Camps 51 and 55, 1st-6th March, 1880, and where the Jardine Brothers had
experienced similar difficulties between their Camps 71 and 77, 17th-23rd
January, 1865. The "ridge very scrubby" may have been the same on which
Jardine's 74th and 75th Camps and my 51st, 54th and 55th were
situated.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[9) This camp was probably west of Helby Hill, near Jardine's 77th
and my 52nd Camp. The "gulleys" to which the travellers doubled back" to get
clear of the creek and scrub "were probably heads of my "Captain Billy's" and
"Camisade" Creeks.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[10) The <i>Herald</i> reporter obtained a significant addition to
Jackey-Jackey's story (<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, 6th March, 1849): "Mr.
Kennedy once got into a bog, after leaving Pudding-Pan Hill, up to his
shoulder, and was 'like a pig in the mud,' Jackey says. He lifted him
out...After Jackey had taken Mr. Kennedy out of the bog between Shelburne Bay
and Escape River, they SPELLED FOR SEVERAL DAYS, he was so ill, and Jackey says
he carried him often on his back&mdash;not far; only half a mile at a
time...Sometimes Jackey carried Mr. Kennedy from place to place when he was
ill, out of the way of the blacks, and, as he terms it, 'planted' him." It may
be conjectured that this "spell" of several days took place at the camp of 23rd
November. We may suppose that perhaps for three days (24th, 25th and 26th)
Jackey-Jackey was busy collecting food, evading the blacks, and from time to
time carrying his enfeebled master to new hiding-places.]</blockquote>

<p>another creek <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> [27th November], and on the
following morning we continued going on, and camped in the evening close to a
scrub <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> [28th November]; it rained in the night.
Next day we went on in the SCRUB, but COULD NOT GET THROUGH. I cut and cleared
away, and it was near sundown before we got through the scrub&mdash;there we
camped [29th November]. [SEE MAP A.] It was heavy RAIN next morning, and we
went on in the rain; then I changed horses and rode a black colt, to spell the
other, and rode him all day, and in the afternoon we got on clear ground, and
the HORSE FELL down, me and all; the horse lay upon my right hip. Here Mr.
Kennedy got off his horse and moved my horse from my thigh; we stopped there
that night [30th November], and could not get the horse up; we looked to him in
the morning and he was DEAD; <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> we left him
there. We had some horse meat left to eat, and went on that day and crossed a
LITTLE RIVER and camped <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b> [1st December]. The
next day we went a good way; Mr. Kennedy told me to go up a tree to see a sandy
hill somewhere; I went up a tree, and saw a sandy hill a little way down from
Port Albany. That day we camped near a swamp <b style="color:#603000">[5]</b>
[2nd December]; it was a very rainy day. The next morning we went on, and Mr.
Kennedy told me we should get round to Port Albany in a day; we travelled on
all day till twelve o'clock (noon), and then we saw Port Albany; then he said:
"There is PORT ALBANY, Jackey a ship is there you see that island there,"
pointing to ALBANY ISLAND; this was when we were at the mouth of ESCAPE RIVER.
<b style="color:#603000">[6]</b> We stopped there a little while; ALL THE MEAT
WAS GONE; I tried to get some fish, but could not; we went on in the afternoon
half a mile ALONG THE RIVER-SIDE, <b style="color:#603000">[7]</b> and met a
good lot of BLACKS, and we camped [3rd December]; the blacks all cried out
"Powad powad," and rubbed their bellies; and we thought they were friendly, and
Mr. Kennedy gave them fish-hooks all round; everyone asked me if I had anything
to give away, and I said "No," and Mr. Kennedy said, "Give them your
knife,Jackey"; this fellow on board was the man I gave the knife to; I am sure
of it; I know him well; the black that was shot in the canoe was the most
active in urging all the others on to spear Mr. Kennedy; I GAVE THE MAN ON
BOARD MY KNIFE; <b style="color:#603000">[8]</b> we went on this day, <b style=
"color:#603000">[9]</b> and I looked behind, and they were getting up their
spears, and ran all round the camp which we had left; I told Mr. Kennedy that
very likely those black fellows would follow us, and he said, "No, Jackey,
those blacks are very friendly"; I said to him, "I know these black fellows
well, they too much speak"; we went on some 2 or 3 miles and camped [4th
December]; I and Mr. Kennedy watched them that night, taking it in turns every
hour all night; by-and-by I saw the black fellows; it was a MOONLIGHT NIGHT;
and I walked up to Mr. Kennedy and said to him, "There is plenty of black
fellows now"; this was in the middle of the night; Mr. Kennedy told me to get
my gun ready; the blacks did not know where we slept, as we did not make a
fire; we both sat up all night; after this, daylight came [5th December], and I
fetched the horses and saddled them; then we went on a good way up the river,
and then we sat down a little while, and we saw three BLACK FELLOWS coming
along our track, and they saw us, and one fellow ran back as hard as he could
run, and fetched up plenty more, like a flock of sheep almost; I told Mr.
Kennedy to put the saddles on the TWO HORSES and go on, and the blacks came up,
and they FOLLOWED us ALL THE DAY; all along it was raining, and I now told him
to leave the horses and come on without them, that the horses made too much
track.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Possibly on the Jardine River, west of False Orford
Ness.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Say west of Orford Ness, having passed the real Pudding-Pan
Hill.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) This leaves only two horses.</blockquote>
<blockquote>[4) Probably Henderson Creek, from the right bank to the
left.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[5) A mangrove swamp near the mouth of Henderson
Creek.</blockquote>
<blockquote>[6) The Escape River was named by Captain King, R.N., on 24th July,
1819. <i>See Narrative of a Survey of the Tropical and Western Coasts of
Australia, 1818-1822</i>. Murray, 1827.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[7) Kennedy came to the mouth of the Escape River and ran up the
right bank because he could not cross, precisely as I did on 18th and 19th
March, 1880.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[8) The question of the identity of this man was discussed later
on, during the voyage of the "<i>Ariel</i>."</blockquote>
<blockquote>[9) Jackey-Jackey evidently meant "next day," 4th
December.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 231}</u></p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy was too weak, and would not leave the horses. We went on this
day till towards evening [5th December]; raining hard, and the blacks followed
us all the day, some behind, some planted before; in fact, BLACKS ALL AROUND
following us. Now we went on into a little bit of a scrub, and I told Mr.
Kennedy to look behind always; sometimes he would do so, and sometimes he would
not look behind to look out for the blacks. Then a good many black fellows came
behind in the scrub, and threw plenty of SPEARS, and HIT MR. KENNEDY in the
back first. Mr. Kennedy said to me, "Oh ! Jackey-Jackey ! shoot 'em, shoot
'em." Then I pulled out my gun and fired, and hit one fellow all over the face
with buck shot; he tumbled down, and got up again and again, and wheeled right
round, and two black fellows picked him up and carried him away. They went away
then a little way, and came back again, THROWING SPEARS all around, more than
they did before; very large spears. I pulled out the spear at once from Mr.
Kennedy's back, and cut out the jag with Mr. Kennedy's knife; then Mr. Kennedy
got his gun and snapped, but the gun would not go off. The blacks sneaked all
along by the trees, and speared Mr. Kennedy again in the right leg, above the
knee a little, and I GOT SPEARED over the eye, and the blacks were now throwing
their spears all ways, never giving over, and shortly again speared Mr. Kennedy
in the right side; there were large jags to the spears, and I cut them out and
put them into my pocket. At the same time we got speared, the HORSES GOT
SPEARED too; and jumped and bucked all about, and got into the swamp. I now
told Mr. Kennedy to sit down, while I looked after the saddle-bags, which I
did; and when I came back again, I saw blacks along with Mr. Kennedy; I then
asked him if he saw the blacks with him; he was STUPID WITH THE SPEAR WOUNDS,
and said "No"; then I asked where was his watch. I saw the blacks taking away
watch and hat as I was returning to Mr. Kennedy; then I carried Mr. Kennedy
into the scrub; he said, "Don't carry me a good way"; then Mr. Kennedy looked
this way, very bad (Jackey rolling his eyes). I said to him, "Don't look far
away," as I thought he would be frightened; I asked him often, "Are you well
now," and he said, "I don't care for the spear wound in my leg, Jackey, but for
the other two spear wounds in my side and back," and said, "I am bad inside,
Jackey." I told him black fellow always die when he got spear in there (the
back); he said, "I am out of wind, Jackey"; and I asked him, "Mr. Kennedy, are
you going to leave me?" and he said, "Yes, my boy, I am going to leave you"; he
said," I am very bad, Jackey; you TAKE THE BOOKS, Jackey, to the Captain, BUT
NOT THE BIG ONES, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> the Governor will give
anything for them." I then tied up the papers; he then said, "Jackey, give me
paper and I will write"; I gave him paper and pencil and he tried to write, and
he then fell back and died <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> [5th December,
dusk]; and I caught him as he fell back and held him, and I then turned round
myself and cried; I was crying a good while until I got well; that was about an
hour, and then I BURIED HIM; I digged up the ground with a tomahawk, and
covered him over with logs, then grass, and my shirt and trousers.</p>
<p>That night I left him near dark; I would go through the scrub, and the
BLACKS THREW SPEARS at me, a good many, and I went back again into the scrub;
then I went down the creek which runs into ESCAPE RIVER, and I walked along the
water in the creek very easy, with my head only above water, to avoid the
blacks, and get out of their way; in this way I went half a mile; then I got
out of the creek, and got clear of them, and walked on all night nearly, and
slept in the bush without a fire; I went on next morning and felt very bad, and
I spelled for two days [6th and 7th December]; I lived upon nothing but salt
water; next day I went on and camped 1 mile away from where I left [8th
December, camp], and ate one of the pandanus fruits;</p>
<blockquote>[1) There were two or more books, larger than the others, to which
Kennedy attached great importance even in his dying moments. It may be taken
for certain that they were the diary of the whole trip from Rockingham Bay. It
is impossible to conjecture the nature of the smaller books.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) The deplorable events of this day, culminating in Kennedy's
death, took place on the right bank of the Escape River, the ground which I
covered on 19th March, 1880, between Camps 62 and 63.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 232}</u></p>
<p>next morning I went on 2 miles, and sat down there, and I wanted to spell a
little there, and go on; but when I tried to get up, I could not, but fell down
again very tired and cramped, and I spelled here two days [camp]; then I went
on again 1 mile, and got nothing to eat but one nonda [camp]; and I went on
that day <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and camped [camp], and on again next
morning, about half a mile, and sat down where there was good water, and
remained all day [camp]. On the following morning, I went a good way, went
round a great swamp and mangroves, and got a good way by sundown [camp]; the
next morning I went and saw a very large track of black fellows; I went clear
of the track and of swamp or sandy ground; then I came to a VERY LARGE RIVER;
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> and a large lagoon; plenty of ALLIGATORS in
the lagoon, about 10 miles from Port Albany. I now got into the ridges by
sundown, and went up a tree and saw ALBANY ISLAND [camp]; then next morning at
four o'clock <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> I went on as hard as I could go
all the way down, over fine clear ground, fine ironbark timber, and plenty of
good grass; I went on round the point (this was towards Cape York north of
Albany Island) and went on and FOLLOWED A CREEK DOWN, and went on top of the
hill, and SAW CAPE YORK; and I knew it was Cape York, because the sand did not
go on further; I sat down then a good while; I said to myself, "This is PORT
ALBANY, I believe inside somewhere"; Mr. Kennedy also told me that the ship was
inside, close up to the mainland; I went on a little way, and SAW THE SHIP and
boat; I met close up here two black gins and a good many piccaninnies; one said
to me "Powad, powad!"; then I asked her for eggs; she gave me turtle's eggs,
and I gave her a burning-glass; she pointed to the ship which I had seen
before; I was very frightened of seeing the black men all along here, and when
I was on the rock cooeying, and murry murry glad when the boat came for me [8
a.m., 23rd December, 1848].</p>

the narrator of the tale was, as is evident from his creeping on at the rate of
a mile or half a mile in a day, his periods of sleep and insensibility were, no
doubt, longer than he knew, and as he scarcely knew, at times, what he was
doing, his memory was not to be relied on&mdash;at least since his and
Kennedy's arrival at the Escape River.]</blockquote>

<p>THE Schooner "<i>Ariel</i>" (72 tons), <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
under the command of CAPTAIN DOBSON, having on board DR. ADONIAH VALLACK and
BARRETT, who were to join Kennedy's party, was chartered by the Government of
New South Wales to await Kennedy's arrival and supply him with provisions for
the return journey. The ship left Sydney on 2nd October, 1848, and reached PORT
ALBANY on the 27th of the same month. Although the period for which she had
been chartered had expired, she was still waiting when JACKEY-JACKEY ARRIVED on
23rd December with the news of the fate of the expedition.</p>
<p>The story of the rescue of the survivors is contained in (1) a STATEMENT BT
CAPTAIN DOBSON, printed with Carron's Narrative but not reprinted in the
<i>Voyage of the "Rattlesnake</i>" (2) a STATEMENT BY DR. VALLACK, printed with
Carron's Narrative and reprinted in the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" (3) a few NOTES BT
DR. JOHN MACGILLIVRAT in the <i>Voyage of the "Rattlesnake."</i> Captain
Dobson's Statement is short and bald and he evidently delegated to Dr. Vallack
the task of writing the history of his voyage.</p>
<p>JACKEY-JACKEY was seen from the ship about 8 a.m. on</p>
<blockquote>[1) Number of hands not stated. One of the crew was named Parker
and another is referred to by Dr. Vallack as "Thomas" and "Tom," but it is not
clear whether this was a Christian name or a surname.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 234}</u></p>
<p>23rd December, "first standing, then walking very lame, then sitting down on
a rock." When taken on board he became faint and had to be revived with wine.
He carried the mark of a spear wound on his forehead. (SEE MAP A.)</p>
<p>The "<i>Ariel</i>" after losing the remainder of the day in an attempt to
increase the supply of beef, got away on 24th December. DR. VALLACK spent that
day in eliciting the information already given in JACKEY-JACKEY'S "STATEMENT."
The deponent could not be kept too long under the strain of examination and Dr.
Vallack humoured him "by changing the subject now and then by speaking of his
comrades at Jerry's Plains." The anchorage for the night was 5 miles south of
SHADWELL POINT, opposite the mouth of HENDERSON CREEK.</p>
<p>A dead calm the following morning (25th December) made it useless to weigh
anchor till about 10 o'clock, when a light breeze sprang up. Shortly
afterwards, a CANOE was met with&mdash;probably about 2 miles north of the
Gilmore Bank&mdash;and the native crew were interrogated. One native was
allowed to come on board, and Jackey-Jackey, who had been stationed in the
foretop, recognised the NATIVES as those WHO HAD SPEARED KENNEDY, the one who
had come on board being the one to whom Jackey-Jackey had given his knife at
Kennedy's request. The native was therefore forcibly detained, and it was
observed that his arm was decorated with part of a bridle and a piece of a
tendon of a horse round his arm. The other blacks in the meantime had jumped
into the sea and the long-boat was put out to examine the deserted canoe for
other relics. Observing the boat, the natives re-entered the canoe and paddled
for the shore. The boat, however, overtook the canoe, when all the blacks again
sprang overboard, with the exception of one, who SPEARED BARRETT in the arm,
and was himself shot. The boat returned to the ship towing the canoe, in which
lay the dying native. A portion of a spear, an inch in length, was extracted by
Dr. Vallack from Barrett's arm on 13th February.</p>
<p>There were found in the canoe "the leg part of a pair of trousers, three
spears, a piece of iron of a saddle, hooks and lines, etc.," and a piece of
moleskin was taken off the captive native's leg and identified by Jackey-Jackey
as part of his own trousers which he had tied round KENNEDY'S head before
burying the body. Jackey concluded, and, no doubt, correctly, that the BODY had
been EXHUMED. (SEE MAP B.)</p>
<p>With a favouring and refreshing breeze the ship resumed her course, and
shortly afterwards Jackey-Jackey pointed out from the foretop, a HILL which he
said was LIKE PUDDING-PAN HILL. THIS WAS the real "PUDDING-PAN HILL" of the
chart, but the absence of certain surroundings which Jackey-Jackey had noted
soon convinced him that it was NOT THE HILL TO WHICH KENNEDY HAD erroneously
GIVEN THAT NAME. On his vehement insistence, the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 235}</u></p>
<p>"<i>Ariel</i>" kept on its course to the south and anchored at nightfall "in
the centre of HANNIBAL BAY, RISK POINT ahead."</p>
<p>There is no Hannibal Bay in the chart from which I made my travelling
"blank" in 1869, nor in that of 1894, but the double bay extending north from
the latitude of the Hannibal Islands to False Orford Ness was so named in the
older charts which, presumably, were carried by Kennedy and Captain Dobson in
1848. Risk Point, although not named in the chart which I used in 1879, nor in
later issues, must have appeared in the charts carried by Kennedy and Captain
Dobson in 1848, and is located from bearings taken by Captain Simpson as
11&deg; 35' 30" S. The probability is that the anchorage of 25th December was
off the mouth of CAMISADE CREEK, where, thirty-one years later, the blacks
attacked my own party.</p>
<p>While approaching the anchorage in the afternoon of 25th December, Dr.
Vallack saw about forty NATIVES on the shore.</p>
<p>On 26th December, the "<i>Ariel</i>" struck a reef within a few minutes of
weighing anchor, but got off without damage. She ANCHORED in the afternoon in
SHELBURNE BAY in sight of a HILL which Jackey-Jackey identified by surrounding
landmarks as the locality WHERE COSTIGAN, DUNN AND LUFF HAD BEEN LEFT on 20th
November (Costigan having been mortally wounded by an accidental gunshot) and
which Kennedy erroneously supposed to be the "Pudding-Pan Hill" of the chart.
Captain Dobson saw two NATIVES on the shore WEARING what he took to be either
CLOAKS OR BLUE SHIRTS.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate, considering how important it was to locate the last
resting-place of Costigan, Dunn and Luff, that Captain Dobson did not record
the latitude of his landing, which he might easily have done from the chart in
the absence of an observation.</p>
<p>At daybreak of 27th December a party consisting of CAPTAIN DOBSON, DR.
VALLACK, BARRETT, a sailor named TOM and JACKEY-JACKEY landed on the coast, the
last named acting as guide. From a careful consideration of every expression
made use of by Dr. Vallack, the probability is that the boat, which was left in
charge of two of the "hands," touched first at DOUBLE POINT. A CANOE was found
here, containing part of a cloak which Jackey-Jackey said belonged to the men
left behind on the 20th November. The party then "trudged through dense scrub
inland for about an hour." Considering the density of the scrub, that Barrett
had a spear wound, and that Jackey-Jackey had by no means recovered his
"condition," probably not more than 2 miles were covered. The direction of the
march is not stated, although "inland" may be taken to be south-west, or at
right angles to the coast-line. Jackey-Jackey then declared that they were not
going far enough south and might as well get away in that direction from a new
point of departure on the coast which would be easier to reach by</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 236}</u></p>
<p>the boat. Returning to the boat, it was decided, before again going inland,
to visit a point, probably "WHITE POINT," about 4 miles distant, and at "the
southernmost part of the bay," where fires had been seen in the morning, as
well as on the previous night. No camp, however, was seen, but only the remains
of a bush fire. Jackey-Jackey then pointed out a place, about three miles
distant and "more in the central part of the bay," as the spot where the next
landing should be made. Jackey-Jackey, who was weak and lame and had to rest
from time to time, led the party westward for a distance estimated at 6 miles,
but which was probably less. He then climbed a tree, from which he reported
that he could see KENNEDY'S SUPPOSED "PUDDING-PAN HILL," but it was still a
long way off, and as the party had left early in the morning without food,
under the impression that only a short walk was before them, they went back to
the boat and rejoined the ship. The men waiting in the boat reported having
seen from 50 to 100 NATIVES on the beach.</p>
<p>Concluding, as there was every reason to do, that Costigan, Dunn and Luff
must have long ago been dead; and seeing that Jackey-Jackey had collapsed and
was no longer capable of acting as a guide through the bush; and, above all,
mindful of their duty to the men still possibly alive at the Pascoe Camp, it
was resolved to spend no more time in investigating the circumstances attending
the death of the "Pudding-Pan Hill" party.</p>
<p>The "<i>Ariel</i>" accordingly left Shelburne Bay next morning, 28th
December, dropping her anchor at night between the "M" REEF and YOUNG
ISLAND.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the anchor was dropped at the mouth of the PASCOE RIVER in
WEYMOUTH BAY, and on the following day the last SURVIVORS OF KENNEDY'S
EXPEDITION found rest and succour on board the "<i>Ariel</i>"</p>

<h5>THE "FREAK"</h5>
<p>BEFORE relating the story of the rescue of the two survivors of the Pascoe
Camp, the last efforts made to discover traces of COSTIGAN, DUNN and LUFF, and
of KENNEDY himself, have to be recorded.</p>
<p>The brig "<i>Freak</i>," CAPTAIN T. BECKFORD SIMPSON, Chief Officer,
Macnate, was chartered by the Government of New South Wales" to call (on her
way to Port Essington) at Shelburne Bay and Escape River, to ascertain&mdash;if
possible&mdash;the fate of the three men left at the former place, and recover
the papers of Mr. Kennedy secreted by Jackey-Jackey." JACKEY-JACKEY was on
board, together with two other natives of his own tribe. CAPTAIN SIMPSON'S
PRIVATE LOG of the voyage, which appeared in Carron's book, and was reprinted
in the <i>Voyage of the "Rattlesnake"</i> gives the only available account of
what was done.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of 4th May, 1849, the "<i>Freak</i>" anchored near Round
Point, the eastern horn of SHELBURNE BAT. (SEE MAP B.) The importance of the
exact position of the anchorage was fully realised by the Captain, who took
careful bearings from three distinct landmarks which were then, and are now,
laid down on the chart.</p>
<pre>
Conical Hill&mdash;SE.&frac12;E.
Saddle Hill&mdash;S.&frac34;E.
Remarkable Sand Patch&mdash;SW.&frac12;W.
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately these bearings, when plotted on the chart, FIX NO POSITION;
the inference being that the landmarks had only</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 238}</u></p>
<p>been sketched from a surveying vessel, and were therefore valueless for
Captain Simpson's purpose. Had he contented himself with giving the bearing of
Round Point and marking the approximate latitude and longitude, as taken from
the chart, the position of the anchorage and of what Jackey-Jackey pointed out
as KENNEDY'S SUPPOSED "PUDDING-PAN HILL" would have been tolerably certain.
From the anchorage the bearing of that hill is given as W.&frac14;N. Whether we
assume the anchorage to have been "in 6 fathoms water" (as stated) on the
bearings given from Conical Hill, or on those given from Saddle Hill,
W.&frac14;N. would place the supposed Pudding-Pan Hill NORTH of where the
"<i>Ariel's</i>" boat party first landed on 27th December, 1848; and where that
party tried, guided by Jackey-Jackey, to get away SOUTH. The presumption is
that, seen from a point of view new to him, Jackey-Jackey pointed out the WRONG
HILL to Captain Simpson. For a mistake of this kind, Jackey-Jackey might very
well be excused, as my own travels showed the neighbourhood to be full of
little detached sandstone tablelands, any one of which might be fancifully
likened to an inverted pudding-pan. The balance of probability is in favour of
COSTIGAN, DUNN AND LUFF'S LAST CAMP and KENNEDY'S SUPPOSED "PUDDING-PAN HILL"
being in the positions I have assigned to them.</p>
<p>From daylight to 8 p.m. on the following day (5th May), the whale-boat of
the "<i>Freak</i>" manned by the Second Officer, four seamen, Jackey-Jackey and
his two aboriginal companions, skirted the coast of SHELBURNE BAY and the
Pacific from ROUND POINT to a point nearly opposite HELBY HILL, landing at
three places, as detailed in the Officer's short report:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I kept close along the beach all day, LANDED three
times; first near the Creek where the '<i>Ariel's</i>' boat [first] landed. Saw
no indications there of Europeans. I landed again some distance further on,
where I saw a NATIVE CAMP and a CANOE. In the latter I found a leathern
pistol-holster, marked 34, which Jackey recognised as belonging to the party.
Three NATIVES were seen by Jackey, who, on perceiving the boat, ran into the
bush. At the third place I landed I saw no indication of men. I was close to
the beach all along, and occasionally fired a musket."</blockquote>
<p>The holster found in the canoe could only have been one belonging to the
unfortunate COSTIGAN, DUNN AND LUFF PARTY, but whether they died a natural
death or were killed by the natives can never be known.</p>
<p>The "<i>Freak</i>" was anchored about a mile from the shore, at a place from
which the HANNIBAL ISLANDS bore SE. by E.&frac12;E., when she took the boat's
crew on board at 8 p.m. RISK POINT lay S.&frac12;E. Risk Point is thus shown to
be the not very prominent cape north of Captain Billy's Creek, where my party
came down to the beach on 9th March, 1880, near Camp 56. As related elsewhere,
we travelled that day northward along the beach to Camp 57, where the natives
gave us a <i>camisade</i>.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 239}</u></p>
<p>While waiting for the boat, the men on the "<i>Freak</i>" saw a CANOE and
five NATIVES on the beach. Early next morning (6th May), the boat, manned as
before, started to continue the exploration of the beach northward, LANDING
first where the canoe and natives had been seen. In the evening, the boat was
picked up at TERN ISLAND, near the mouth of the ESCAPE RIVER, having covered 48
miles, and the Officer reported:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I ran along close to the shore all day. I LANDED a little to the southward
of ORFORD NESS. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> We met about thirty NATIVES on
the beach, who came up to us without hesitation, and appeared very friendly;
they shook hands with all of us, and brought us water. Jackey at first thought
he recognised the native who escaped from the '<i>Ariel</i>' among them; he got
a little excited and wanted to shoot him; when he approached nearer he was
satisfied he was not the same individual. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> At
another place where I landed I found part of the lower mast of a vessel about
400 tons, and pieces of WRECK; saw no natives or indication of them on the
beach."</p>
<p>Next day (7th May) Captain Simpson boarded the schooner "<i>Coquette</i>"
which was lying at anchor. The "<i>Coquette</i>" CAPTAIN ELLIOTT, we learn from
the <i>Voyage of the "Rattlesnake</i>" had been sent from Sydney to AWAIT the
arrival of KENNEDY'S EXPEDITION AT PORT ALBANY, the period for which the
"<i>Ariel</i>" had been chartered for that purpose having expired. She was,
when the "<i>Freak</i>" came up with her, trying to recover four anchors lost
shortly before by the ship "<i>Lord Auckland</i>" from Hobarton, when the
latter was aground on "X" Reef. Captain Elliott had heard from the "<i>Sea
Nymph</i>," from Hobart Town, of the fate of Kennedy's expedition and was about
to sail for Sydney. He had seen a NATIVE at Port Albany who had, apparently,
been WOUNDED in the FACE WITH LARGE SHOT, and as he exactly answered the
description given by Jackey, there is little room for doubt that he was the
individual mentioned in the Statement of the latter as having been wounded with
buck-shot on 1st December, 1848.</p>
<p>Captain Elliott lent two men and himself joined Captain Simpson's boating
party which set out next morning (8th May) at daylight. With this
reinforcement, two boats were "manned, thus making a most formidable party,"
says Captain Simpson.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the ESCAPE RIVER, the little bay west of Sharp Peak was
pointed out by Jackey-Jackey as the place where KENNEDY and he first met
HOSTILE NATIVES. (SEE MAP A.) The party LANDED about 12 miles up the inlet at
the first place where the left bank <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Near the REAL "PUDDING-PAN HILL," not the hill so named by
Kennedy.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) The NATIVE in question was reported missing while the
"<i>Ariel</i>" was at anchor on the night of 11th January between Cape Bedford
and Turtle Reef, near Cooktown The night was dark and stormy and sharks were
seen in the morning. It is doubtful whether the native ever reached land, and
if he did there were about 400 miles to walk to Orford Ness, through hostile
tribes. Even supposing him to have escaped death at sea he could hardly have
covered the distance on foot in four months, delayed as he must have been, by
the necessity for procuring food daily.&mdash;R.L.J.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) His right, as the Captain reckoned.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 240}</u></p>
<p>was free of mangroves. This, Jackey-Jackey said, was WHERE HE ADVISED
KENNEDY on the day when he was killed TO LEAVE THE HORSES, and swim the river,
here about 30 yards wide. Jackey pointed out the tree where he TIED THE HORSES
while they searched unsuccessfully for oysters, having had NOTHING TO EAT that
day.</p>
<p>Three or four miles further up the stream, which had narrowed considerably
and was overhung with mangroves, the fresh water was reached and a LANDING was
made at a clear spot on the left or western bank. Near this was "an extensive
PLAIN, with numerous large ant-hills on it, which JACKET knew as the place he
had CROSSED the day Mr. Kennedy was killed."</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We walked," says Captain Simpson, "some distance
across a swamp, still following the course of the creek. We traced the creek
for nearly a mile, looking out for a crossing place, when JACKEY pointed out on
the other side the place where he had SECRETED THE SADDLE-BAGS. At length we
came to a tree which had fallen and formed a kind of bridge, over which we
passed with difficulty, and returned to the place where Jackey said the
saddle-bags were planted. Jackey then showed us the place where 'horse tumble
down creek' after being speared. Some horse-dung was found on the top of the
bank close to this place, which confirmed Jackey's statement. He then took us a
few yards into the scrub to look for the saddle-bags, and told us to look about
for a broken twig growing over a thick bush. The place was found, but THE
SADDLE-BAGS WERE GONE. On searching under the bush among the leaves, the
horizon glass of a sextant was found a strong proof that Jackey had hit upon
the right place.<br>
<br>
"Jackey then took us through a dense scrub for some distance, when we came on
open swampy ground about half a mile wide. On the opposite side there was more
scrub, close to which there were three large ant-hills. Jackey took us up to
the centre one, five yards from which poor KENNEDY FELL. Against this ant-hill
Jackey placed him when he went after the saddle-bags. Jackey told us to look
about for broken SPEARS; some pieces were found. He then took us to a place
about sixty yards from the ant-hill, WHERE HE PUT MR. KENNEDY, who then told
him not to carry him far. About a quarter of a mile from this place, towards
the creek, Jackey pointed out a clear space of ground, near an angle of a very
small running stream of fresh water, close to three young pandanus trees, as
the place where the unfortunate gentleman DIED. Jackey had taken him here to
wash his wounds and stop the blood. It was here, when poor Kennedy found he was
dying, that he gave Jackey instructions about the PAPERS, when Jackey said,
'Why do you talk so: You are not going to leave me?'<br>
<br>
"JACKEY then led the way to a dense tree-tea scrub, distant about three or four
hundred yards, where he had CARRIED THE BODY AND BURIED IT. When we came to the
edge of the scrub, Jackey was at a loss where to enter, as he said when he was
carrying the corpse he did not look behind&mdash;all the objects in front being
nearly alike he did not get a good mark. Into the midst of the scrub we went,
divided ourselves and searched in every direction, but COULD NOT FIND THE
PLACE. Jackey had not made the spot too conspicuous; fearing the blacks might
find it, he had only bent down two twigs across each other. The scrub was not
very extensive but exceedingly thick. I placed the party (eleven in number)
five yards asunder and traversed it this way in all directions, but without
success. I then took Jackey to the plain where the poor gentleman died, and
told him to go towards the scrub in the same manner he did when he was carrying
the corpse, and not to look back, which he did, telling me the manner in which
he carried it and where he shifted it from one shoulder to another. In this
manner he entered the scrub, and I have no doubt he took us very near the exact
place where the body was buried. We sounded the ground all round with our
ramrods, but without success. After taking another good look we reluctantly
gave up the search, as the night was rapidly approaching, and returned to the
boats."</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 241}</u></p>
<p>Near the scrub where Kennedy was buried, the party searched for, and found,
a prismatic COMPASS which Jackey-Jackey told them he had left there. In another
place he had left a sextant, which was not found. The trough of an ARTIFICIAL
HORIZON and a bottle of QUICKSILVER were, however, found near the spot where
the sextant had been left.</p>
<p>Captain Simpson was of opinion that Kennedy's body had not been exhumed and
that the small mound must have been levelled by rains. As for Jackey-Jackey's
idea that the moleskin rag found in the canoe (see Dr. Vallack's Statement,
25th December, 1848) was the one he had bound round Kennedy's head, he admitted
that the saddle-bags which the natives certainly carried away, contained
trousers exactly similar to those from which he tore the rag."</p>
<p>Jackey-Jackey," adds Captain Simpson, "was very quiet, but felt, and felt
deeply, during the day. When pointing out the spot where Mr. Kennedy died, I
saw tears in his eyes, and no one could be more indefatigable in searching for
the remains. His feelings against the natives were bitter, and had any of them
made their appearance at the time, I could hardly have prevented him from
shooting them."</p>
<p>The party regained the boat, got clear of the intricate navigation of the
inlet before dark and CAMPED on the beach near POINT SHADWELL at 11 p.m.</p>
<p>At daybreak on 9th May, they rowed to the beach of the inlet west of SHARP
POINT, where some natives had been seen launching a canoe the previous morning.
They found only a CANOE and a CAMP which the natives had abandoned. One of
Jackey's aboriginal comrades got a glimpse of a native disappearing into the
bush. In the camp was a small piece of red CLOTH identified by Jackey as part
of Kennedy's cloak, and a piece of painted CANVAS. The canoe was destroyed.</p>
<p>The BOATS REJOINED THE SHIP at 10 a.m. At half-past twelve, the
"<i>Freak</i>" and "<i>Coquette</i>" LEFT THE ESCAPE RIVER, to anchor at night
on the north side of ALBANY ISLAND.</p>
<p>On 11th May, Jackey-Jackey and his two aboriginal companions were taken in
the whaleboat by Mr. Macnate, Chief Officer of the "<i>Freak</i>" up KENNEDY
INLET for an estimated distance of 11 miles and landed at a point where the
channel had narrowed to 40 feet. From this spot, Jackey-Jackey led across
country for about 2 miles straight to the place where he had secreted the
PAPERS entrusted to him by Kennedy on 5th December, 1848. The papers had been
taken out of the hollow log in which they had been hidden, and had been
saturated with water and much damaged. They consisted of a ROLL OF CHARTS and
some MEMORANDUM BOOKS, including one in which Jackey-Jackey had drawn sketches.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Captain Simpson, on 15th May, 1849, wrote a letter to Captain
Owen Stanley, R.N., Commander of H.M.S. "Rattlesnake," which was communicated
by the latter to the Secretary of the <i>Royal Geographical Society</i>, and
read at a meeting of the Society on 27th January, 1851:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"A river which runs into the centre of Newcastle Bay was next examined, and the
place found where Jackey had concealed the SMALL PAPERS in a hollow log, but a
rat or some animal had pulled them out where they had been exposed to the
weather, and were quite saturated with water. They consisted of a ROLL OF
CHARTS, ON WHICH HIS TRACK WAS LAID DOWN; these, with care, may possibly be
deciphered: I am sure if you had them you could do it. There were some
MEMORANDUM BOOKS, much defaced, and also a TIME BOOK. I have sent everything
carefully packed, to Sydney." It is evident that Captain Simpson was of opinion
that the roll of charts on which Kennedy's <i>route</i> was laid down was,
though damaged, not incapable of being deciphered if placed in competent
hands.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 242}</u></p>
<p>A PAIR OF COMPASSES which Jackey-Jackey expected to find was missing. The
blacks probably carried away the compasses, which would make excellent barbs
for spears, and left the papers, for which they had no use. Captain Simpson
observed in his report that he feared the papers were "nearly destroyed," but
thought the charts might be deciphered, with care. This was, apparently, never
done, though the charts were carefully packed and sent to Sydney.</p>
<p>It is evident that the memorandum books and time book referred to in the
letter quoted in the footnote were distinct from the "big ones," to which
Kennedy attached supreme importance, and which probably contained his full
journal.</p>
<p>WHERE ARE THE CHARTS AND BOOKS? Unless they can be recovered, we now know
all that can ever be known of the gallant but unfortunate Kennedy.</p>

<p><b>(SEE MAP B.)</b></p>
<p>IT now becomes necessary to resume the consideration of CARRON'S NARRATIVE,
for his account of the party left under his charge on the 13th November, 1848,
when Kennedy set out on his ill-fated journey to Cape York to obtain
relief.</p>
<p>The party camped near the mouth of the Pascoe consisted of eight
individuals, viz., CARRON, WALL, NIBLET, TAYLOR, CARPENTER, GODDARD, MITCHELL
and DOUGLAS. They had been told by Kennedy that in the most favourable
circumstances they might expect relief in fourteen days, but were instructed to
make their provisions last for six weeks. These PROVISIONS consisted of 28 lb.
of flour, &frac12; lb. of tea, and two horses, which were to be killed for food
as required.</p>
<p>The men left behind were, as may well be believed, weak and weary, and
settled down in their last camp with "a sort of sluggish indifference" and
without the stimulus of hope.</p>
<p>One horse was killed on the 14th and the other on the 27th November, and the
last of the FLOUR was FINISHED on the 4th</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 244}</u></p>
<p>December, and what little horseflesh remained was almost unfit to eat. A
midday shade temperature of 110&deg; F. prevailed. The RAINS set in on the 27th
and continued for three days, and the heat and humidity, together with the
absence of salt, made it difficult to preserve the meat, some of which was
eaten in a putrid condition. The men were now face to face with STARVATION,
twenty-one days after they had settled in camp. The flour had been consumed at
the rate of less than a quarter of a pound per man per day, so that evidently
an economical regimen had been submitted to.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS DIED on the 16th and TAYLOR on the 20th November, and they were
buried side by side. CARPENTER died on the 26th and was buried in the bed of
the creek, the survivors being too weak to carry the body to the resting-place
of his companions. In all three cases, however, Carron read the burial service.
Carron says that Carpenter "did not suffer very acutely on the approach of
death, but the animal energies were destroyed, and they withered away one after
another, without pain or struggle."</p>
<p>The stores of the party included a fair amount of ammunition, but it had to
be used with economy in view of the requirements of defence. There were plenty
of fish-hooks, but the eager anglers never got so much as a bite. A small bag
of shell-fish was brought up from the beach by Carron and Goddard on the 4th
December, and another on the 7th by Carron and Mitchell, but after the latter
date none of the party had sufficient strength for such work. A few small
pigeons, a heron and a small wallaby fell to the guns, up to the 29th December,
but these were far below the food requirements of the men. The kangaroo dog was
killed on the 21st December and furnished two days' food for the survivors,
then four in number. The sheep-dog was only saved from the same fate by the
arrival of the rescue party.</p>
<p>There was at first a disposition to TRUST TO THE NATIVES FOR FOOD. The men
were afraid to leave the camp and for the most part were unable to go far from
it. Some natives came to the camp, on the 16th November, bringing "a few small
pieces of fish, old and hardly eatable." Two days later they returned, this
time with women, and "brought some fish, but it was such as they would not eat
themselves; also a kind of paste, made of different kinds of leaves and roots,
mixed with the inside of the roasted mangrove seeds, all pounded up together,
then heated over a fire in a large shell. Although we did not much like the
taste of the paste, and it was very full of sand, we ate some of it as a
vegetable."</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the visits of the natives under a pretence of
offering food, which was always in such quantities and of such a quality as to
suggest a spirit of mockery, were prompted by a desire to spy on the camp and
ascertain the defensive capacity of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>On 19th November FIFTY OR SIXTY ARMED MEN came up and made</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 245}</u></p>
<p>a HOSTILE DEMONSTRATION, but retired on a show of resistance being made.
This being Sunday, prayers were read as usual.</p>
<p>On 21st November (the day after the second death in the party)</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"about SIXTY NATIVES," as Carron relates, "came to
the camp, well armed with spears, and pieces of fish, which they held up to us,
to entice us to come to them. We took no notice, however, of their invitations,
but preparing our firearms, we turned out. They were now CLOSING ROUND us in
all directions, many of them with their spears in their throwing-sticks, ready
for use&mdash;pointing them to their own necks and sides, and showing us by
their postures how we should writhe with pain when they struck us. Then they
would change their tactics and again endeavour to persuade us that they meant
us no harm, but they would not lay down their spears. Some of them seemed
inclined to go away, but others appeared determined to attack us. After keeping
us standing for about an hour, ELEVEN SPEARS were THROWN AT us. Three of my
party then fired, slightly wounding one of them, when they all immediately ran
away as fast as they could. Some of them, however, remained hovering in sight
for some time after. Three of the spears that were thrown fell short of us, the
rest passing very close, but fortunately no one was hurt. The three spears
which passed us were barbed with bone, and were very heavy."</blockquote>
<p>On 26th November (the day of the third man's death), the NATIVES RETURNED,
bringing a few small fish, and leaving their spears at a distance. Apprehensive
of a trap, however, the besieged refused to accept the fish. It is noteworthy
that the two visits in force occurred each time after the death of one of the
party, of which the hovering natives were evidently aware.</p>
<p>By the end of November the distress of the survivors reached such a pitch
that they ate the hide of the last horse. The hide of the horse killed
previously had been given to the dogs.</p>
<p>The LOWEST DEPTHS OF MISERY were sounded by the unhappy men on the 2nd
December, the day after Kennedy's death. H.M.S. "<i>Bramble</i>" had been seen
on the previous day sailing southward, having waited at Cape York till the
limit of time specified in her instructions had been exceeded and she was
relieved by the "<i>Ariel</i>." Still on the look out for Kennedy's expedition,
the "<i>Bramble</i>" actually lowered a boat the following morning, as if with
intent to land a party. Failing, however, to see the signals made by the men on
shore, the schooner CONTINUED ON HER SOUTHWARD VOYAGE, and the sufferers were
apparently left to their fate. The events of these two days are best related in
Carron's own tragic words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"1st December. The wind was blowing strong from the
south-east this morning. On going up the hill in the afternoon, I saw a
schooner from the northward beating to the southward. I supposed her to be the
"<i>Bramble</i>" as it was about the time Mr. Kennedy had given me expectation
of being relieved by water, and I afterwards found I was right in this
supposition.<br>
<br>
"I naturally concluded she had come for us; and full of hope and joy I
immediately hoisted a FLAG on a staff we had previously erected on a part of
the hill where it could be seen from any part of the bay. We placed a ball
above the flag to put the crew on their guard against the natives. We then
collected a quantity of wood, and at dusk lighted a FIRE, and kept it burning
till about half-past seven or eight o'clock.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 246}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">I then fired off three ROCKETS one after the other,
at intervals of about twenty minutes. I also took a large PISTOL up the hill,
and stood for some time firing it as quickly as I could load it, thinking they
might perhaps see the flash of that, if they had not seen the rockets.<br>
<br>
"2nd December. Early this morning I was up, straining my eyes to catch a view
of the bay, and at length saw the schooner standing in to the shore, and during
the forenoon a BOAT was LOWERED. I now made quite certain they were coming for
us, and thinking they might come up the creek in the boat for some distance, I
hastened down the hill and began to pack up a few things, determined to keep
them waiting for our luggage no longer than I could help. I looked anxiously
for them all the afternoon, wondering much at their delay in coming, until at
last I went up the hill, just in time to see the SCHOONER PASSING THE BAY. I
cannot describe the feeling of despair and desolation which I, in common with
the rest of our party, experienced as we gazed on the vessel as she fast faded
from our view. On the very BRINK OF STARVATION AND DEATH death in the lone
wilderness, peopled only with the savage denizens of the forest, who even then
were thirsting for our blood HOPE, sure and certain hope, had for one brief
moment gladdened our hearts with the consoling assurance that, after our many
trials and protracted sufferings, we were again about to find comfort and
safety. But the bright expectancy FADED; and although we strove to persuade
ourselves that the vessel was not the '<i>Bramble</i>' our hearts sunk within
us in deep despondency."</blockquote>
<p>The remainder of the story of the camp cannot be better told than in
Carron's own words, on which it is impossible to improve, and which I only
abridge in a few places where incidents have already been related.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"9th December. The NATIVES visited us this morning
and brought with them a few pieces of turtle's entrails and a few nondas. I
gave them an old shirt and a knife, the latter being highly prized by them.
GODDARD had a fit of AGUE to-day, followed by FEVER.<br>
<br>
"l0th December. We all of us had fits of AGUE this morning, and none of us
could get up till the afternoon, when, being Sunday, I read prayers.<br>
<br>
"11th December. The NATIVES came this morning, and brought us a little
vegetable paste, and some pieces of turtle's entrails, with some shark's liver.
The latter was fresh, but one could not eat it, as it all melted into a
yellowish oil when boiled for a few minutes. I gave them a few fish-hooks, but
found it very difficult to get them to leave the camp.<br>
<br>
"13th December. This morning MITCHELL was found DEAD by the side of the creek,
with his feet in the water. He must have gone down at night to get water, but
too much exhausted to perform his task, had sat down and died there. None of us
being strong enough to dig a grave for him, we sewed the body in a blanket,
with a few stones to sink it, and then put it into the brackish water.<br>
<br>
"15th December. The thermometer fell this morning and was broken. It was
raining heavily all day, and two bags of my seeds and several other little
things were washed out of the tent by the water which ran down the hill. We
were all very ill and weak.<br>
<br>
"16th December. It was raining this morning, and we remained in the tent.
Hearing one of our dogs barking, however, I went out and saw several NATIVES
with pieces of fish and turtle, which I took from them, when they left us. The
natives also brought us some roasted nymphaea roots, which they call
'dillii.'<br>
<br>
"During the last few days we shot seven pigeons. Wall and Goddard used to go
into the scrub and sit beneath a tree, to which they used to come for berries
to feed their young, and, watching their opportunity, shoot them.<br>
<br>
"21st December. Our KANGAROO DOG being very weak, and unable to catch
anything,</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 247}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">we KILLED and lived on him for two days. There was
very little flesh on his bones, but our dried meat was so bad that we very much
enjoyed the remains of our old companion, and drank the water in which we
boiled him.<br>
<br>
"24th December. The NATIVES took a tin case from Wall whilst he was talking to
them, he not being able to resist them. My legs had swelled very much, and I
was able to walk but a very short distance.<br>
<br>
"26th December. The NATIVES brought in a few pieces of fish and turtle, but
both were almost rotten. They also gave us a blue-tongued lizard, which I
opened, and took out eleven young ones, which we roasted and ate. There was
nothing but scales on the old one, except in its tail.<br>
<br>
"We always divided whatever we got from the natives, be it what it might; but
they brought us very little that was eatable. I could easily perceive that
their pretended good feeling towards us was assumed for the sake of fulfilling
their own designs upon us. Although they tried to make us believe they were
doing all in their power to benefit us, THEIR OBJECT was to obtain an
opportunity of coming upon us by surprise and DESTROYING us. They had at many
times seen the fatal effect of our firearms, and I believe that it was only the
dread of these that prevented them from falling upon us at once and murdering
us...It would be almost impossible for any class of men to excel these fellows
in the scheming and versatile CUNNING with which they strove to DISGUISE THEIR
MEDITATED TREACHERY. In fine weather I always had our firearms standing out for
them to see, and once or twice every night I fired off a pistol to let them
know we were on the look out by night as well as by day.<br>
<br>
"28th December. NIBLET AND WALL both DIED this morning. Niblet was quite dead
when I got up, and Wall, though alive, was unable to speak. They were neither
of them up the day previous. I had been talking with them both, endeavouring to
encourage them to hope on to the last; but sickness, privation and fatigue had
overcome them, and they abandoned themselves to a calm and listless despair. We
had got two pigeons the day before, which in the evening were boiled and
divided between us, as well as the water they were boiled in. Niblet had eaten
his pigeon and drank the water, but Wall had only drunk the water and eaten
part of his half pigeon.<br>
<br>
"About eleven o'clock as many as FIFTY NATIVES, armed with spears, and some of
them painted with a yellowish earth, made their appearance in the vicinity of
our camp. There were natives of several STRANGE TRIBES amongst them. They were
well aware that neither Niblet nor Wall was able to resist them, if they did
not know they were dead. They also knew that we were very weak, although I
always endeavoured as much as possible to keep that fact from them. This
morning, when I made signs to them to lay down their spears, they paid no
attention, with the exception of two, who had been in the habit of coming very
frequently to the camp. These two came running up quite close to us, without
their spears, and endeavoured to persuade one of us to go across a small dry
creek for a fish which another of the rascals was holding up to tempt us. They
tried various methods to draw our attention from the rest, who were trailing
their spears along the ground with their feet, closing gradually round us, and
running from tree to tree, to hide their spears behind them. Others lay on
their backs on the long grass, and were working their way towards us, unnoticed
as they supposed. GODDARD AND MYSELF stood with our guns in readiness and our
pistols by our sides for about two hours, when I fell from excessive weakness.
When I got up we thought it best to send them away at once, or stand our chance
of being speared in the attempt, both of us being unable to stand any longer.
We presented our guns at the two by our side, making signs to them to send the
others away, or we would shoot them immediately. This they did, and they ran
off in all directions, without a spear being thrown or a shot fired.<br>
<br>
"As the evening came on, there came with it the painful task of removing the
bodies of our unfortunate companions who had died in the morning. We had not
strength to make the smallest hole in the ground as a grave; but after great
exertion we succeeded in removing the bodies to a small patch of phyllanthus
scrub, about four feet high, and eighty yards from the tent. We then laid them
side by side and</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 248}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">covered them with a few small branches; and this was
all the burial we were enabled to give them.<br>
<br>
"29th December. Goddard went into the scrub and shot three pigeons. We ate one
at night, and the others we reserved till next day. Our bowels were greatly
relaxed, which was partly stayed by eating a few nondas, which we got
occasionally.<br>
<br>
"The six weeks having expired which Mr. Kennedy had led me to expect would be
the longest period we should have to wait, I now began to fear the rainy season
had set in, and filled the creeks to the northward, so that his party had been
unable to cross them, or that some untoward accident had happened, which
prevented us being relieved.<br>
<br>
"I did not quite despair, but I knew we COULD NOT LIVE LONG. OUR SHOT WAS
ALMOST CONSUMED, not having more than eight or ten charges left, and although
we had plenty of ball, we were too weak to attempt to form any plan to make
shot. Our sole remaining companion, the sheep-dog, I intended to kill in a day
or two; but he would not last long, as he was nothing but skin and bone.<br>
<br>
"30th December. Early this morning we ate the two pigeons left yesterday and
boiled each a quart of tea from the leaves we had left; but we had not had any
fresh tea to put into the pot for a long time. Goddard then went into the bush,
to try to get another pigeon or two, and if the natives made their appearance I
was to fire a pistol to recall him to the camp. After he had gone I saw NATIVES
coming towards the camp, and I immediately fired a pistol; but before Goddard
could return they came into the camp and handed me a piece of paper very much
dirtied and torn. I was sure, from the first, by their manner, that there was A
VESSEL IN THE BAY. The paper was a NOTE FROM CAPTAIN DOBSON, of the schooner
'<i>Ariel</i>,' but it was so dirtied and torn that I could only read part of
it.<br>
<br>
"For a minute or two I was almost senseless with the joy which the hope of our
deliverance inspired. I made the natives a few presents, and gave them a note
to Captain Dobson, which I made them easily understand I wanted them to take to
that gentleman. I was in hopes they would have gone, but I soon found they had
other intentions. A great many NATIVES were coming from all quarters well ARMED
WITH SPEARS. I had given a shirt to the one who had brought the note and put it
on him; but I saw him throw down the note and pull off the shirt, and picking
up his spear he joined the rest, who were preparing to attack us. We were
expecting every minute to be attacked and murdered by these savages, our newly
awakened hope already beginning to fail, when we SAW CAPTAIN DOBSON and DR.
VALLACK, accompanied by JACKEY and a man named BARRETT (who had been wounded a
few days before in the arm by a barbed spear), approaching towards us, across
the creek. I and my companion, who was preserved with me, must ever be grateful
for the prompt courage with which these persons, at the risk of their own
lives, came to our assistance, through the scrub and mangroves, a distance of
about three miles, surrounded as they were all the way by a large number of
armed natives."</blockquote>
<p>The STRANGE CONDUCT OF THE NATIVES in first bringing Captain Dobson's letter
and then refusing to carry the answer was probably caused by an imperfect
comprehension of the means of communication. In any case, they, no doubt,
thought the Captain's letter would furnish one more PRETEXT FOR A VISIT TO THE
CAMP. Understanding, from the directions accompanying the reply, that the
besieged knew that relief was coming, they prepared to ANNIHILATE THE SURVIVORS
before they could be reinforced by the addition of the new-comers. CARRON'S
NARRATIVE approaches the end:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I WAS REDUCED ALMOST TO A SKELETON. The elbow bone
of my right arm was through the skin, as also the bone of my right hip. My legs
were also swollen to an</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 249}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">enormous size. GODDARD WALKED TO THE BOAT, but I
COULD NOT DO so without the assistance of Captain Dobson and Dr. Vallack, and I
had to be carried altogether a part of the distance. The others, Jackey and
Barrett, kept a look out for the blacks.<br>
<br>
"We were UNABLE TO BRING MANY THINGS from the camp. The principal were the
firearms and one parcel of my seeds, which I managed to keep dry, containing
eighty-seven species. All my specimens were left behind, which I regretted,
for, though much injured, the collection contained specimens of very beautiful
trees, shrubs, and orchideae. I could also only secure an ABSTRACT OF MY
JOURNAL, except that portion of it from 13th November to 30th December, which I
have in full. MY ORIGINAL JOURNAL, with a botanical work which had been kindly
lent me by a friend in Sydney for the expedition, WAS LEFT BEHIND. We got
safely on board the '<i>Ariel</i>' and, after a very long passage, arrived in
SYDNEY.<br>
<br>
"I am confident that no man could have done more for the safety of the party
than was done by MR. KENNEDY, nor could any man have exerted himself more than
he in the distressing circumstances of our perilous journey. He walked by far
the greater part of the distance, giving his one horse for the use of the weak
men and the general use of the expedition. I never rode but two hours all
through the journey, and that was on two successive days when we were in the
vicinity of Cape Sidmouth and I was suffering from bad feet.<br>
<br>
"The unfortunate DEATH OF OUR brave and generous LEADER, deeply and extensively
as I know it to have been lamented, can have no more sincere mourner than
myself.<br>
<br>
"The tale of his sufferings and those of his party has already been read and
sympathised over by hundreds, and it would ill become me to add anything to the
artless narrative of the faithful and true-hearted JACKEY, who having tended
his last moments and closed his eyes, was the first, and perhaps the most
disinterested, bewailer of his unhappy fate."</blockquote>
<p>It may be remarked that Carron's narrative gives very few geological notes.
Probably if Kennedy's diary had been preserved it would have added much to our
geological knowledge. CAPTAIN DOBSON concludes his brief "Statement" by
saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We then pursued our way to Weymouth Bay and RESCUED
MR. CARRON AND GODDARD. We brought with us what INSTRUMENTS we could from the
camp&mdash;they were not many, as Mr. Carron was hardly in a state to tell me
what was there. I should have returned to the camp at Weymouth Bay to save
everything, but for the HOSTILITY OF THE NATIVES, who surrounded us in great
numbers, and, as soon as we had left the camp, rifled it."</blockquote>
<p>Some further particulars of the closing scene of the tragedy are given by
DR. VALLACK.</p>
<p>On 29th December, 1848, the "<i>Ariel</i>" anchored in Weymouth Bay. The
afternoon was wet and squally, and the day was too far spent for a landing
party to reach Carron's Camp and return to the schooner. An anxious look out
for a flagstaff or signals, of which nothing was seen, led to a gloomy
foreboding that all had been lost.</p>
<p>At daylight, next morning, the 30th, the "<i>Ariel</i>" shifted to a
distance of about half a mile from the land. No sooner had she dropped anchor
than FIVE CANOES were seen, paddling towards them from among the mangroves,
five to ten natives in each. From the foremost canoe came shouts of "ferraman"
and "white man"</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 250}</u></p>
<p>and the natives pointed towards the hill which had already been indicated by
Jackey. Doubts as to the reality of the friendliness of the natives were
allayed by the presence of some women and children in the canoes. CAPTAIN
DOBSON wrote a NOTE TO CARRON, which was given to one of the natives, who was
instructed by gestures to take it to the camp. A boat followed the canoes and
CAPTAIN DOBSON, BARRETT, DR. VALLACK and JACKEY-]ACKEY LANDED among the
mangroves. Having at length cleared the swamp, the party followed up a creek,
for about 2 miles, when Jackey-Jackey exclaimed, "See, two white fellows sit
down and camp." The NATIVES, who had been "DEMONSTRATING," must have WITHDRAWN
on the approach of the boat party. "On the other side of the hill," says Dr.
Vallack, "not two hundred yards from us, were TWO MEN sitting down, looking
towards us, the tent and fire immediately behind them; and on coming up to
them, two of the most pitiable creatures imaginable were sitting down. One had
sufficient strength to get up; the other appeared to be like a man in the very
last stage of consumption. Alas! alas! they were THE ONLY TWO LEFT of the
eight, the remainder having died from starvation."</p>
<p>Dr. Vallack continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Whilst here we were considering what was best to be
done, when NATIVES in great numbers were descried watching our movements.
Jackey said, "Doctor," calling me aside, "now I tell you exactly what to do.
You see these black fellows over there" (and in pointing to them I saw a great
number, some 800 yards away, peeping from behind trees), "you leave him tent,
everything, altogether, there, and get the two white fellows down to the boat
quick." Jackey was exceedingly energetic, and grave as well. "Get away as quick
as possible" was resounded by all, but what was to be done? Two MEN ALMOST DEAD
to walk 2 or 3 miles! We looked over the tent, asked Carron for what important
things there were, and each laid hold of what appeared to be of most value, the
Captain taking two sextants, other parties, firearms, etc., etc. "Come along,"
again and again Jackey called out, and the Captain too, whilst they were
half-way down the creek, and Barrett and I loaded ourselves. I took a case of
seeds, some PAPERS OF CARRON'S, a double gun and pistols, which, together with
my own double gun and brace of pistols, thermometer <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and my pockets full of powder and shot, was as much as
I could manage. Seeing CARRON COULD NOT GET ALONG, I told him to put his hands
on my shoulders, and in this way he managed to walk down, as far or nearly
through the mangrove swamp, towards the water's edge, when he could not in that
way get any further, and BARRETT, with his disabled arm, CARRIED HIM down to
the edge of the water. GODDARD, the other survivor, who was JUST ABLE TO WALK
down, spoke and looked exceedingly feeble. They were brought on board at noon,
and attended to according to my instructions. Carron's legs were dreadfully
swollen, about three times their natural size, from oedema. In the afternoon
both reviving and thanking God for their deliverance. I was for some time
afraid of Carron. At 10 p.m., they are both doing well, and I trust will be
enabled to tell us their tale, which will render it unnecessary for me to write
it down here. I told the Captain to proceed direct on to Sydney, Jackey, Carron
and Goddard and the Captain stating it would be running too great a risk to go
to recover anything from the tent. Moreover, with so small a party as the
Captain, Jackey and myself (BARRETT really being UNFIT to go, and the SAILORS
all REFUSING to</blockquote>
<blockquote>[1) The broken one.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 251}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">go), I consider the Captain deserves considerable
credit for his action throughout in exerting himself to rescue the
survivors."</blockquote>
<p>The "<i>Ariel</i>" accordingly LEFT WEYMOUTH BAY on the following day, 31st
December, 1848, and reached SYDNEY on 5th March, 1849. The tidings of the
disastrous conclusion of Kennedy's expedition having reached Sydney, the brig
"<i>Freak</i>" as already stated, was chartered by the Government of New South
Wales to make a FURTHER SEARCH for Kennedy's papers and for traces of the
parties left at Kennedy's so-called "Pudding-Pan Hill" and the Pascoe. An
account of the discovery of a few of KENNEDY'S PAPERS between the Escape River,
where he died, and Cape YORK, and of the unsuccessful attempt to reach the
scene of the DEATH OF THE THREE MEN AT "PUDDING-PAN HILL" has already been
given.</p>
<p>The "<i>Freak's</i>" whaleboat, on 3rd May, 1849, landed in WEYMOUTH BAY a
party which included CAPTAIN SIMPSON of the "<i>Freak,</i>" CAPTAIN SAMPSON of
the "<i>Harbinger</i>" (who volunteered), JACKEY-JACKEY and two of his
aboriginal comrades. The landing and the overhaul of CARRON'S CAMP were made
under very difficult circumstances owing to torrential rain and the threatening
aspect of the natives. At the landing-place were found part of a BLANKET, part
of a TARPAULIN, a piece of CANVAS and a small TIN DISH. Three outrigger CANOES
were also met with and in these some pieces of IRON were observed. These
articles, Captain Simpson concluded, came from the PILLAGE of Carron's last
camp. A tree was found with the carved letters "K. LXXX." This, Jackey-Jackey
said, was the camp of the 11th November, 1848 (the last but one). This would
indicate that it was KENNEDY'S 80TH CAMP.</p>
<p>Of the LAST CAMP, to which CARRON'S PARTY removed on the 13th November, the
day on which Kennedy left for Cape York, Captain Simpson writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"This spot was strewed with portions of BOOKS, all
of a religious or scientific character. Found NO MANUSCRIPTS. Parts of harness,
leather belts, pieces of cedar boxes in leather covers, were also found; one or
two tins for carrying water, a camp stool and part of a table, and piece of a
tent-pole; the bones, skull, and part of the feathers of birds, etc.; SPECIMENS
of natural history, all DESTROYED. I observed the bones of a HORSE and the
skull of a DOG. A piece of torn calico with a portion of a CHART adhering to it
was picked up; I thought I could make out the words "River Mitchell" on it. I
found, among the pieces of books, a portion of Leichhardt's Journey
Overland.<br>
<br>
"It was some time before I could find the remains of WALL AND NIBLET, who were
the last men that died, and had not been buried, the survivors being too weak.
I placed myself at the camp and looked about for the likeliest place to which a
corpse would be taken under the circumstances. I went down into a small gully,
about sixty yards from the camp. Under some small bushes, in about two feet of
water, I found THEIR BONES, two skulls and some of the larger bones, the
smaller ones having most probably been washed away by the flood. The bones were
carefully collected and taken on board. From the position in which these bones
were found, agreeing</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 252}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">with the description given me by Mr. Carron, I feel
confident that they are the remains of Wall and Niblet."</blockquote>
<p>The remains of Wall and Niblet were carried on by the "<i>Freak</i>" to
ALBANY ISLAND, where, on the top of the highest hill at the southern end of the
island, they were INTERRED on the 13th May, 1849. A tombstone was erected on
the spot by Captain Owen Stanley, of H.M.S. "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" who himself
died in March, 1850.</p>
<p>There is abundant evidence that CARRON'S LAST CAMP was pitched, not on
Simpson's Hill, at the mouth of the Pascoe, but on Barrett's Hill, two or three
miles to the west, near the tributary of the Pascoe River, which the expedition
followed down on the 9th, 10th and 11th November, 1848. In this position, the
camp, flagstaff and signals cannot have been sufficiently conspicuous to
attract attention from the sea. Had it been placed on Simpson's Hill it must
have been visible from the "<i>Bramble</i>" when that ship sailed to the south
on the 3rd December, to the heartrending disappointment of the despairing
watchers on the land, and the lives of Mitchell, Wall and Niblet would probably
have been saved. It must not, however, be forgotten that Carron's party did not
know whether relief was to come by land or sea, and therefore the position of
their last camp may have been the result of a compromise. It is also impossible
to say whether they judged the site chosen to have strategical advantages for
defence against the savages. Lastly, it is only too likely that the weak and
dispirited men had not energy enough to look for a better site and move the
camp.</p>
<p>The touching narratives of the survivors and rescuers give a very clear
insight into KENNEDY'S CHARACTER. Unquestionably brave, he was always
scrupulously fair and considerate towards his enemies. His plan of operations
had been most carefully thought out, but with its cumber of carts and sheep it
proved absolutely inapplicable to the country to be traversed; it is not too
much to say that the plan would have been rejected with horror by any man
knowing the country, as I for one came to know it later, and as, of course,
Kennedy could not have conceived it when he set forth full of confidence in the
perfection of his arrangements. Nevertheless, a more reasonable leader would
have realised the impossibility of the task under the conditions much earlier
than Kennedy did, and would have remodelled his equipment, as he did at last,
after men and horses had had all the heart worked out of them before the
journey could have been said to have begun. He and nine others paid, in full
measure, the penalty of an admirable perseverance which had degenerated into
obstinacy.</p>
<p>The persistence displayed by Kennedy, the inability to bow before the forces
of Nature and admit defeat, were closely allied to the piety which
distinguished him above other explorers. The heartfelt prayers which ascended
from his moving tents every</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 253}</u></p>
<p>Sunday morning&mdash;sometimes under circumstances which would have driven
other men to work rather than to pray&mdash;were persisted in to the very last,
although they seem almost invariably to have been followed by some new
disaster. Kennedy had the spirit which drew from Job in his agony the defiant
cry: "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him, but I will maintain mine own
ways." He was revered and loved by all who shared with him the hardships of the
terrible journey.</p>
<p>REQUIESCAT IN PACE!</p>
<p>A sufficient reason why no serious attempt has hitherto been made to garner
the geographical results of Kennedy's expedition is to be found in the fact
that the task was practically impossible until the progress of settlement had
brought with it the production of land maps on which his course could be
traced.</p>
<p>CARRON AND WALL merit the highest commendation for the fidelity with which
they persisted in their scientific duties, even when everything pointed to
their efforts being made in vain. Carron has furnished in his (which is the
only) record of the Kennedy expedition, a narrative as thrilling as that of
Daniel Defoe, and with the additional advantage of being true in every
line.</p>
<p>Perhaps, after all, the hero of the tale is the aboriginal JACKEY-JACKEY.
The laurel wreath due to the first explorer to reach Cape York by land would
have been justly placed on his black brow. The unavoidable limitations imposed
on him by his ancestry have already been pointed out, but</p>
<p>"Though tawny was his hide,<br>
He was white, clear white, inside,"</p>
<p>and in courage, prudence, resourcefulness and loyalty he could not have been
surpassed by the whitest of men.</p>
<p>The "<i>Ariel</i>" arrived in SYDNEY on 5th March, 1849. A reporter of the
<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> at once interviewed the survivors of the
expedition and the officers of the schooner. The report gives an abstract of
Jackey-Jackey's narrative, as taken down by Dr. Vallack, and some further
particulars which account for a portion of the time spent on the forlorn hope
between the Pascoe and Cape York. These have already been embodied in notes
appended to Jackey-Jackey's "Statement."</p>
<p>Jackey-Jackey now said that thirteen days elapsed between KENNEDY'S DEATH
and his own arrival at Cape York. On a critical consideration of the statement,
read in the light of other evidence, I conclude that only ten out of the
eighteen days are accounted for. I have no doubt that Jackey-Jackey crawled
along in a dazed condition and was too far gone to take an accurate account of
time. He added that he had taken three spears out of Kennedy's body.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 254}</u></p>
<p>If the guns and powder had not been damaged by the constant rain, he
believed that Kennedy would have got through.</p>
<p>An OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION, ordered by the Attorney-General, was held on 6th
March at the Water Police Court by Captains Innes and Browne.</p>
<p>CARRON put in his diary of the period during which he was in charge of the
party left at the mouth of the Pascoe. The subsequently published booklet gives
the substance of the diary put into narrative form, together with the previous
part of the journey from Rockingham Bay to the Pascoe, which was compiled from
an abstract of his private diary.</p>
<p>GODDARD'S examination added nothing to Carron's narrative, but he gave
instances of Kennedy's consideration for the subordinate members of his
party.</p>
<p>Dr. VALLACK put in the Statement of Jackey-Jackey which he had taken on
board the "<i>Ariel</i>" and gave an account of the voyage of the
"<i>Ariel</i>" to Shelburne Bay and Weymouth Bay, and the doings on shore in
these localities, but added practically nothing to the "Statement" included in
the booklet.</p>
<p>The evidence was handed to the Attorney-General, who submitted it to the
Government.</p>
<p>On 9th March, the Colonial Secretary, the Hon. E. Deas Thomson, officially
announced the fate of the expedition in the Government Gazette. The
announcement pays a high tribute to Kennedy and Carron and generously
recognises the devoted services of Jackey-Jackey. It contains also the
statement that "it is hoped from the documents which have been preserved, a
narrative of the expedition may be compiled for publication at a future
date."</p>
<p>On 25th April, 1849, the Governor, Sir Charles Fitzroy, transmitted the
PAPERS relating to the expedition to Earl Grey, who replied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"DOWNING STREET, 1st October, 1849.<br>
"SIR,<br>
<br>
"I have to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 55, of the 25th of

death of that gentleman and others of his party.<br>
<br>
"I have read the melancholy narrative contained in these documents with much
regret, and it has given me deep concern to observe the loss of life which has
resulted from the undertaking. I avail myself, however, of the earliest
opportunity of expressing to you the sense which I entertain of the courage and
enterprise shown by every individual belonging to the party, by whom,
notwithstanding so calamitous an issue, much appears to have been achieved; and
I especially appreciate the intrepid zeal and energy by which their leader
would seem to have been distinguished.<br>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 255}</u></p>
<p>On 17th July, 1849, on the motion of Mr. Darvall, a sum of &pound;100 was
placed on the Supplementary Estimates for the erection of a MEMORIAL TABLET in
St. James' Church, Sydney. The vote was carried on a division by twenty-one
votes to four. In the course of the debate, the Colonial Secretary (the Hon. E.
Deas Thomson) said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"A NARRATIVE BY ONE OF THE SURVIVORS WOULD SHORTLY
BE PUBLISHED, and advantage had been taken of the departure of a vessel to
Torres Straits to send down Mr. Kennedy's faithful companion Jackey-Jackey, in
the hope of recovering the Journal of the former. The Journal had not been
found, but A CASE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED, somewhat affected by damp, in which were
many VALUABLE MAPS, delineating the <i>route</i> pursued by Mr. Kennedy and the
general features of the country through which he passed. THESE DOCUMENTS, he
was happy to inform the House, WOULD SUPPLY A GOOD DEAL OF INFORMATION at
present wanting, and would serve as a material guide to any person attempting
the same <i>route</i>."</blockquote>
<p>The principal objector was MR. ROBERT LOWE, afterwards Lord Sherbrooke. His
arguments were: (1), that "the expedition was a most ill-advised one, and was
commenced by the Government on its own responsibility, without consulting the
Council"; and, (2), that the expense should be defrayed by private subscription
rather than be taken from the public purse.</p>
<p>The mural tablet in St. James' Church is of white marble. A bas-relief
representing Kennedy lying under a palm tree and supported by his faithful
Squire, with armed savages in the distance, is followed by the inscription:</p>

<p>A few biographical notes on Carron's career are furnished by Mr. J.H.Maiden,
C.M.G., in his "Records of Australian Botanists" (<i>Journ. Roy. Soc., N. S.
Wales,</i> XLII, 1908). Carron was born in Norfolk, England, on 18th December,
1823, and arrived in Sydney in 1843, in charge of plants for one of the
Macleays. He was a Licensed Surveyor when he joined Kennedy's expedition. After
the expedition he was engaged for some time in collecting plants. [Documents in
the Mitchell Library show that he was appointed Sub-Collector of Customs at
Eden, New South Wales, in 1856.&mdash;R. L. J.] He was on the staff of the
Botanic Gardens, Sydney, as a Collector, from 1st September, 1866, to 31st
December, 1875, when he left to take up the position of Forester on the
Clarence River. He died at Grafton on 25th February, 1876.</p>

<h5>#1. FIRST NORTHERN CRUISE</h5>
<p>EARLY in the year 1845, the Admiralty determined to replace the "<i>Fly</i>"
by the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>," but his formal instructions were not handed to the
Commander, Captain OWEN STANLEY, until the eve of his departure from England,
towards the close of the following year.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 258}</u></p>
<p>It was intended that the "Rattlesnake" (28 guns) should be accompanied by
the "<i>Bramble</i>" under LIEUTENANT C. B. YULE, and the "<i>Castlereagh</i>"
under Lieutenant Aird. A survey, however, proved the "<i>Castlereagh</i>" to be
unfit for the service, and she was left behind. The complement of the
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" when she commenced her northern work, was 154 officers and
men, and that of the "<i>Bramble</i>" 36. A decked boat, named the "<i>Asp</i>"
followed the expedition, and appears when conducting independent operations to
have usually been in charge of LIEUTENANT DAYMAN. JOHN MACGILLIVRAY was
Naturalist and a younger naturalist was THOMAS HUXLEY, who was destined to
attain world-wide fame as a biologist. Owing to the illness and death of the
Commander of the expedition, which took place before the work was completed, it
is not to his pen, but to MacGillivray's that we owe the narrative of the
voyage, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and from Huxley's brush came the
spirited drawings which illustrate the text.</p>
<p>The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" left PLYMOUTH on 11th December, 1846, and reached
SYDNEY on 16th July, 1847. On 11th October, she, with the "<i>Bramble</i>" set
out for Port Curtis and the north, anchoring in UPSTART BAY (between the sites
of Bowen and Townsville, two towns not as yet founded) on 10th December, 1847.
(SEE MAP O.) They returned to SYDNEY on 14th January, 1848.</p>
<h5>#2. SECOND NORTHERN CRUISE</h5>
<p>The second northern cruise began at Sydney on 29th April, 1848. Up to that
date, with the exception of Leichhardt's brief appearance on the base of the
triangular area of the Cape York Peninsula, in 1845, the exploration of the
Peninsula had penetrated only in a few places for a few miles from the coast,
and had been entirely the work of maritime pioneers. The time had now arrived
for the opening up of the interior, and Kennedy's ambitious scheme for an
overland journey from Rockingham Bay to Cape York was about to be carried out.
The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" and "<i>Bramble</i>," therefore, had the honour of
convoying the barque "<i>Tam O'Shanter</i>," with KENNEDY'S EXPEDITION on
board, to ROCKINGHAM BAY, the scene of its initial operations. (SEE MAP K.)</p>
<p>On 23rd and 24th May, 1848, the sailors assisted Kennedy with the
debarkation of his men, horses, sheep and stores, and immediately thereafter
began their own labours to complete the survey of the INNER PASSAGE to the
north. It was arranged that the "<i>Bramble</i>" was to be in PRINCESS
CHARLOTTE BAY during the first week of August, to wait for Kennedy and to
assist him in any way possible. (SEE MAP E.) We have already seen how</p>

1846-1850</i>. By John MacGillivray, F.R.G.S., Naturalist to the Expedition.
Published under the Sanction of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.
London, 1852.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 259}</u></p>
<p>Kennedy was unable to keep the appointment, arrived only on 9th October, and
did not think it worth while to force his way through the mangroves and swamps
of the coastal plain to the bay, from which the "<i>Bramble</i>" must long ago
have sailed away. (SEE MAP G.)</p>
<p>The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" was in TRINITY BAY (the site of the future town of
Cairns) on 26th July, and shortly afterwards gave to the mountain behind Cook's
Cape Tribulation the name of PETER BOTTE, from a fancied resemblance to the
mountain of that name in the Mauritius. A fortnight (31st July to 14th August)
was spent at LIZARD ISLAND. (SEE MAP E.) CAPE MELVILLE was reached on 21st
August and the PIPON ISLANDS on the following day. Here the
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" was joined by the "<i>Bramble</i>" and Yule reported that
he had waited ten days in Princess Charlotte Bay without seeing anything of
Kennedy. While the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" lay off CAPE MELVILLE, a watering party
was attacked by NATIVES on a small stream "inside of the cape" (i.e., in
BATHURST BAY, to the west), but no casualties took place. (SEE MAP C.)</p>
<p>From the Pipon Islands to PELICAN ISLAND (143&deg; 50' E.; 13&deg; 55' S.),
which was reached on 28th August, the course of the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" and
"<i>Bramble</i>" was probably across Bathurst Bay, through Rattlesnake Channel
(between Denham Island and Bathurst Head), across Princess Charlotte Bay, and
west of the Beabey Patches and Stainer Island. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>From Pelican Island, the "<i>Bramble</i>" was dispatched to the south, to
fill in details of the survey to the head of PRINCESS CHARLOTTE BAY. The
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" anchored at No. 5 CLAREMONT ISLAND (143&deg; 43' E.;
13&deg; 39' S.), now charted as FIFE ISLAND, on 31st August, and at NIGHT
ISLAND (143&deg; 35' E.; 10&deg; 1' S.) on 8th September. (SEE MAP B.)</p>
<p>On 29th September, the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" arrived at Bligh's SUNDAY
ISLAND, where she was rejoined by the "<i>Bramble</i>." The two ships were at
CAIRNCROSS ISLAND on 3rd October, and at the northern entrance of Port Albany
(ALBANY PASSAGE) on 7th October. (SEE MAP A.) On the 8th, they went on to EVANS
BAY, where they took in water, after having cleared out the wells dug by the
"<i>Fly</i>."</p>
<p>"While the ship ['<i>Rattlesnake</i>'] remained at Cape York, the
'<i>Bramble,</i>' 'Asp,' pinnace and our second cutter were engaged in the
survey of ENDEAVOUR STRAIT and the PRINCE OF WALES CHANNEL, which they finished
before they left, thus completing the survey of the INNER ROUTE between Dunk
and Booby Islands" ("<i>Rattlesnake</i>" I, p. 122). Among the surveys made by
Yule in the "<i>Bramble</i>" was that of ALBANY PASSAGE. Yule named</p>
<blockquote>[1) Named after F. G. Beabey, Boatswain (1899), and C. E. Stainer,
Lieutenant (1898), H.M.S. "<i>Dart</i>."]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 260}</u></p>
<p>PORT ALBANY ("<i>Rattlesnake</i>" I, p. 132). The pinnace was sent to BOOBY
ISLAND and found letters.</p>
<p>About the same time that the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" arrived at Cape York, five
canoes arrived from Mount Adolphus Island, temporarily increasing the
population of Evans Bay to about 150 men, women and children. They visited the
ship and were friendly and well treated. They only stayed a few days, and then
dispersed along the coast to the south. Stanley considered Cape York a suitable
locality for a military post, such as was then contemplated, as Port Essington
was not answering the purpose for which it had been founded. In Evans Bay,
water was obtainable only in wells, and he judged a small sandy bay on Albany
Island to be preferable. MacGillivray noted the occurrence of porphyry in the
vicinity of Cape York and of sandstone cliffs, 30 feet high, on ALBANY
ISLAND.</p>
<p>It had been "arranged" that KENNEDY should be at Cape York by the beginning
of October, but such arrangements are liable to be overruled by unforeseen
circumstances. The schooner "<i>Ariel</i>" Captain Dobson, sent from Sydney,
with Dr. Adoniah Vallack and another man as reinforcements, and with sheep and
other provisions for Kennedy, arrived at Cape York on 27th October.</p>
<p>The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" or the "<i>Bramble</i>" was constantly on the look
out for the expected arrival of the land party till 2nd November, when this
duty was delegated to the "<i>Ariel</i>" It was not till 23rd December that
Kennedy's aboriginal "boy" JACKEY-]ACKEY, sole survivor of the forlorn hope
which had attempted a "dash" to Cape York (Kennedy and his three white
companions having perished), more than half dead, hailed the "<i>Ariel</i>"
from the shore. It has already been related how Captain Dobson took
Jackey-Jackey on board the "<i>Ariel</i>" and sailed promptly to the relief of
the main body of the expedition marooned in WEYMOUTH BAY and rescued the two
survivors, CARRON and GODDARD, on 30th December.</p>
<p>The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" and "<i>Bramble</i>" left Evans Bay on 2nd November
and reached BOOBY ISLAND on the 4th, having passed through PRINCE OF WALES
CHANNEL. The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" arrived at PORT ESSINGTON on 9th November,
1848, and at SYDNEY on 24th January, 1849.</p>
<p>The "<i>Bramble</i>" was left at Booby Island with instructions to finish
some work in Endeavour Strait and the Inner Passage, and was then to proceed to
Sydney. She passed WEYMOUTH BAY on 1st and 2nd December, full in sight of the
party dying of sickness and starvation and frantically making signals of
distress. (SEE MAP B.) CARRON has described with a glowing pen the elation
arising from the certainty of being snatched from the very jaws of death and
the subsequent agony of despair when their hopes were dashed to the ground.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 261}</u></p>
<p>Granting that one of the possibilities of the situation was that the
exploring party had been lost, and that another was that they had been
compelled to abandon their intention of making for Cape York, there still
remained a third, <i>viz.</i>, that they had made for the coast in the hope of
signalling the ship which had been ordered to meet them at Cape York on her
return voyage, or of being picked up by some other vessel. Yule had, no doubt,
technically obeyed orders when he waited in Princess Charlotte Bay and at Cape
York for Kennedy, who did not keep his appointment; but he might have been
expected not to have lost sight of the third possibility, and to have kept a
look out as he passed southward within sight of the coast. He may, indeed, have
done so, and I have already pointed out that Carron's flagstaff was not planted
in the most commanding position. It must also be admitted that on the afternoon
of 1st January the declining sun in the look out's eyes may have prevented him
seeing the signal flag as he scanned the shore, and that the noise of the
pistol shots might not carry far, as "the wind was blowing strong from the
south-east"; but the fires and rockets might have attracted attention during
the night. At the judicial investigation held in Sydney on 6th March, 1849 (the
day after the arrival of the "<i>Ariel</i>" with the survivors), Lieutenant
Yule was not called upon to give evidence, as he would almost certainly have
been had he been on the spot. His account of the "<i>Bramble's</i>" traverse of
Weymouth Bay might have been of material value as a commentary on Carron's
narrative. The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" was in Sydney from 24th January to 8th May,
1849, and MacGillivray makes no mention of the arrival of the "<i>Bramble</i>"
which probably came no further south than Moreton Bay, where she was joined by
the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" on 17th May.</p>
<h5>#3. THIRD NORTHERN CRUISE</h5>
<p>The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" which left SYDNEY on 8th May, picked up the
"<i>Bramble</i>" in Moreton Bay nine days later. On 26th May, the two ships
sailed for the LOUISIADE ARCHIPELAGO and NEW GUINEA. On 27th September, they
left New Guinea for Cape York to meet a vessel which was to bring them supplies
from Sydney. Next day they anchored off BRAMBLE CAY. (SEE MAP A.) By STEPHENS'
and CAMPBELL'S ISLANDS, they went to MARSDEN ISLAND, where they anchored on
29th September. Here the "<i>Bramble</i>" left the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" to call
at the BOOBY ISLAND post office. The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" sailing <i>via</i>
ARDEN and COCONUT ISLANDS, reached EVANS BAY, Cape York, on 1st October, and
was rejoined by the "<i>Bramble</i>" Yule reported that the boats of an
American whaler lost on the Alert Reef, outside the Barrier, had arrived at
Booby Island, and their crews had been saved from starvation by the provisions
deposited there.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 262}</u></p>
<p>During the stay of the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" at Cape York, a remarkable
incident took place. On 16th October, a WHITE WOMAN claimed the protection of a
boat's crew who had landed on the beach. She was Barbara Thomson, a native of
Aberdeen, who had immigrated with her parents to New South Wales, where she had
married. Some four and a half years ago, she had embarked with her husband in
the cutter "<i>America</i>" bent on the salvage of oil from a whaler wrecked on
the Bampton Shoal. The guide, a member of the shipwrecked crew, failed to
discover the wreck, whereupon recrimination and quarrelling ensued. Two men
were accidentally drowned and a third was left on a small uninhabited island.
Then the "<i>America</i>" made for Torres Strait and was wrecked on "the
eastern Prince of Wales Island" (Entrance Island?). The only two men then on
the ship (one of them Barbara's husband?) were drowned in the attempt to swim
ashore; but the woman was rescued by the natives, one of whom, named Boroto,
took her to wife; and she also enjoyed the protection of a person of importance
in the tribe, who lived in Muralug (Prince of Wales Island), and who recognised
her as the re-embodied spirit of his deceased daughter, who had been named
Gi'Om, which name was conferred on her.</p>
<p>A year ago, the people of the island had heard of the visit of "two war
canoes"&mdash;no doubt the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" and "<i>Bramble</i>"&mdash;to
Cape York. Recently, when the smoke-telegraph conveyed the news of the return
of the two ships, Gi'Om had persuaded her hosts, chiefly by hints of great
rewards, to take her to Cape York. Once safely on board the
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" and in spite of objections and threats on the part of her
black friends (who seemed to have become genuinely attached to her), she
elected to return to Sydney, where she was ultimately restored to her
parents.</p>
<p>Gi'Om had much to tell of a WHITE MAN, with a name which sounded like Wini,
who had lived with the Badu (MULGRAVE ISLAND) tribe for many years. This man
had once visited Prince of Wales Island in the hope of inducing Gi'Om to "share
his fortunes." From the fact of his not understanding English and having to
converse with her in the native language, she took him to be a foreigner.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"He had," says MacGillivray, "reached Mulgrave
Island in a boat, after having, by his own account, killed his companions, some
three or four in number. In course of time, he became the most important person
in the tribe, having gained an ascendancy by procuring the death of his
principal enemies and intimidating others; which led to the establishment of
his fame as a warrior, and he became in consequence the possessor of several
wives and canoes and some property in land, the cultivation of which last he
pays great attention to. Wini's character appears from the accounts I have
heard&mdash;for others corroborated part of Gi'Om's statement&mdash;to be a
compound of villainy and cunning, in addition to the ferocity and headlong
passions of a thorough savage. It strikes me that he must have been a runaway
convict, probably from Norfolk Island. It is fortunate that his sphere of
mischief is so limited, for a more</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 263}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">dangerous ruffian could not easily be found. As
matters stand at present, it is probable that not only during his life but for
years afterwards, every European who falls into the hands of the Badu people
will meet with certain death."</blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant J. Sweatman, of the "<i>Bramble</i>" connected the advent of Wini
on Mulgrave Island with the murder of a boat's crew belonging to a Sydney
<i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> and tortoise-shell vessel, who, in June, 1846, landed
on MULGRAVE ISLAND to barter, but rowed off to a sandbank on the appearance of
suspicious symptoms among the natives. Four men were killed on the sandbank,
while two others, who were in the boat, apparently escaped. "In my opinion,"
observes MacGillivray, "Wini's arrival on Mulgrave Island probably took place
long before the murder of the boat's crew. More, I think, than three years and
a half must have been required for him to have acquired the influence,
reputation and property referred to by Gi'Om; and this supposition accords with
her phrase of 'many years.'"</p>
<p>Only two years ago, i.e., before 1849, adds MacGillivray, two men and a boy,
who had reached BANKS ISLAND in a boat, were murdered by the natives.
MacGillivray remarks that the natives of DARNLEY ISLAND, which is more
frequently visited by ships than Banks Island, are safe to deal with, and that
the MURRAY ISLANDERS treat distressed strangers with kindness.</p>
<p>MacGillivray's observations led him to the conclusion that the CAPE YORK
NATIVES were of mixed Australian and Papuan blood. The PRINCE OF WALES
ISLANDERS look down upon them and are justified in regarding them as inferiors.
Bows and arrows are in use on the islands, but not on the mainland, where also
there is no true chieftainship. I may point out that observations prior to
MacGillivray's leave it doubtful whether, even in the islands, there is
chieftainship, or anything more than the temporary ascendancy of individuals
showing unusual strength of character. Nor am I certain that a deliberate
preference for wimmeras and spears to bows and arrows is in itself a proof of
mental inferiority. On the other hand, the superiority of the islanders in
cultivation, in industry and in land and marine architecture, is beyond
question.</p>
<p>During a stay of nine weeks in the neighbourhood of Cape York, the men of
the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" had good opportunities for observing the natives of
the "Land's End" of the Australian continent, with whom they kept up friendly
relations. They were interested spectators of a FIGHT or tournament, of fifteen
warriors on each side, which resolved itself into duels with spears between
individual combatants. When shooting parties left the ship, each sportsman was
assisted by a favoured black individual who had been selected as associate, or
<i>botaiga</i> (younger brother), and there was keen competition for this
honour.</p>
<p>A native DANCE, of about 150 performers, was got up for the entertainment of
the visitors; but it proved, according</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 264}</u></p>
<p>to MacGillivray, "a very poor affair," and broke up in disorder because of
the distribution of biscuits having been entrusted to one of the women.</p>
<p>A fine fresh-water stream was discovered running into Muddy Bay, and was
named the MEW RIVER. As there was some good land on its banks, MacGillivray
considered this a good site for a SETTLEMENT, Port Essington having by this
time been abandoned.</p>
<p>On 3rd December, 1849, the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" left Cape York and anchored
at ERNEST ISLAND, 27 minutes to the north. The island is composed of syenite,
rises to a height of 751 feet and contains a village of 150 inhabitants.</p>
<p>SUE ISLAND (142&deg; 50' E.; 10&deg; 12' S.) is the central of the "THREE
SISTERS" GROUP, POLL ISLAND lying to the south and BET ISLAND to the north. The
group is about 21 minutes east of Ernest Island. Sue Island, which is composed
of coral sand, has a village of sixty inhabitants and a coco-nut plantation.
Seven men paddled out to the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" in a canoe and bartered
tortoise-shell for tobacco. The men "differed in no material respect" from the
natives of Prince of Wales and Darnley Islands. The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>"
anchored for the night of the 7th off the west end of the reef which runs east
and west (chiefly east) of BET ISLAND.</p>
<p>On 8th December, the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" sailed ENE. between COCO-NUT and
DOVE ISLANDS and anchored at ARDEN ISLAND to the NE. A party landed on 8th
December, but found no natives in residence. She then proceeded to KEATS
ISLAND, where she anchored, having passed RENNEL and MARSDEN ISLANDS on the
right. The following day she anchored north of DARNLEY ISLAND, where, on the
11th, 12th and 13th, the usual bartering took place in the villages. In
addition to coco-nuts, sago palms and mangoes were noted among the cultivated
trees. The MUMMY of a child was offered for sale, and over this deal friction
arose, which at one time threatened to develop into serious trouble. Huxley was
allowed to enter a hut and sketch its interior and contents.</p>
<p>On 14th December, the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" proceeded to BRAMBLE CAY, where
some of the party landed, collecting turtles' and birds' eggs. The booby was
present in great numbers.</p>
<p>On 19th December, the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" left BRAMBLE CAY for CAPE
POSSESSION, New Guinea (146&deg; 20' E.; 8&deg; 38' S.), and, two days later,
was at anchor in the lee of the Paiwara Islands, where she lay for a week while
Yule, in the "<i>Bramble</i>," surveyed between CAPE DIRECTION and REDSCAR BAY,
New Guinea. (ADMIRALTY CHART, No. 2758 A.) Observations were made (for the
second time) to ascertain the height of MOUNT OWEN STANLEY (13,205 feet).</p>
<p>On 6th January, 1850, the DUCHATEAU ISLANDS (152&deg; 25' E.; 11&deg; 25'
S.) were reached, and the survey of the LOUISIADE ARCHIPELAGO was entered
upon.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 265}</u></p>
<p>The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" left the Duchateau Islands on 8th January, and
reached SYDNEY on 5th February, 1850. CAPTAIN OWEN STANLEY DIED there on 13th
March, while apparently convalescing from an illness contracted during the last
cruise, and Lieutenant Yule succeeded to the command.</p>
<p>The "<i>Bramble</i>" was left in Sydney when, on 2nd May, the
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" left for England, with, it may be noted, the greater
number of the marines from the abandoned station of Port Essington on board.
The voyage to England was made by the north end of New Zealand and round Cape
Horn, and ended at CHATHAM on 9th November, 1850.</p>

<p>In 1854, at the instigation of the Royal Geographical Society, the British
Government, although at the time much preoccupied with the Crimean war,
organised an expedition designed "to lay open, if favoured with success, more
of the interior of the great Australian Continent than the many energetic but
partial attempts hitherto made have succeeded in developing." A sum of
&pound;5,000 was voted and it was understood that more</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 267}</u></p>
<p>would be provided if necessary. The command was given to Mr. (afterwards
Sir) AUGUSTUS CHARLES GREGORY, then Assistant Surveyor, Western Australia. The
full party was thus composed:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
<i>Commander:</i> A. C. Gregory.
<i>Assistant Commander</i>: H. C. Gregory.
<i>Geologist</i>: J. S. Wilson.
<i>Artist and Storekeeper</i>: J. Baines.
<i>Surgeon and Naturalist</i>: J. R. Elsey.
<i>Botanist</i>: Ferdinand von' Mueller (afterwards Baron and Sir Ferdinand).
<i>Collector and Preserver</i>: J. Flood.
<i>Overseer</i>: G. Phibbs.
<i>Stockmen, &amp;c.</i>: C. Humphries, R. Bowman, C. Dean, J. Melville,
     W. Dawson, W. Shewell, W. Selby, S. Macdonald, H. Richards, J. Fahey.
</pre>
<p>The proceedings of the expedition are summarised in a British Parliamentary
Paper, 1 while the Diary is given in a Collection of Mr. Gregory's Journals
published by the Queensland Government. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>The expedition was conveyed to the scene of its land operations by the
barque "<i>Monarch</i>" and the schooner "<i>Tom Tough</i>," which left Sydney
on 18th July, Brisbane on 12th August and Port Albany on 27th August, 1855.
After passing through ENDEAVOUR STRAIT, PORT ESSINGTON was reached on 1st
September. The horses were landed at POINT PEARCE. The "<i>Monarch</i>" went on
to Singapore while the "<i>Tom Tough</i>" was sent up the VICTORIA RIVER to
establish a <i>dep&ocirc;t</i> at the highest convenient point.</p>
<p>After preliminary rides, during which the McADAM RANGE was crossed and the
FITZMAURICE RIVER was reached, the land party left POINT PEARCE on 6th October.
The VICTORIA RIVER was reached on 17th October, but it was not until the 20th
that Elsey and two men were found camped at a spring, and they told that the
schooner had grounded lower down the river (below Mosquito Flat). With infinite
labour the damaged ship was brought up the river to a point in 15&deg; 39' 43",
near STEEP HEAD, where a <i>dep&ocirc;t</i> was established. Further
<i>reconnaissances</i> connected the explorer's <i>route</i> with the points
named during the voyage of the "<i>Beagle</i>."</p>
<p>Finally, a party consisting of A. C. and H. C. Gregory, Baines, Mueller,
Flood, Phibbs, Bowman, Dean and Fahey started out, on 3rd January, 1856, to the
south-west to carry out the main purpose of the expedition in the exploration
of new country, A second <i>dep&ocirc;t</i> was established in 17&deg; 43' S.

<p>130&deg; 30' E.) and a party of four (the two Gregorys, Mueller and Dean)
continued the journey. A river, which was named the STURT, was followed to the
SW. to 20&deg; 16' 22", where it entered a dry salt lake (6th March). The party
then made for the (second) DEP&Ocirc;T CAMP, which was reached on 28th March.
The party there, in charge of Baines, had been "somewhat annoyed" by frequent
attempts on the party by the NATIVES to burn them out. The principal
DEP&Ocirc;T CAMP near Steep Head was reached on 6th May. Elsey was in charge,
Wilson having gone down the river to where the "<i>Tom Tough</i>" was still
undergoing repairs. One member of the crew had died. All was quiet at the
dep&ocirc;t. The natives had been respectful to the full party, but isolated
units or small parties had at different times been threatened.</p>
<p>The journey on which Gregory crossed and recrossed the southern base of the
Cape York Peninsula STARTED FROM THE DEP&Ocirc;T CAMP on 21st June, 1856, and
the party comprised, besides the leader, H. C. Gregory, Elsey, Mueller, Bowman,
Dean and Melville. They had thirty-four horses and five months' provisions. The
general course followed was E. by N. as far as Leichhardt's ROPER RIVER
(14&deg; 50' 56" S. lat.; approx. E. long. 133&deg; 40'), and thence
south-eastward, parallel to the Limmen Bight&mdash;Bentinck Islands shore of
the Gulf of Carpentaria to the meridian of 138&deg; E., which three years later
was to become the dividing line between Queensland and the Northern Territory.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>In running down what was named ELSEY CREEK, a tributary of the Roper, the
remains of a hut were noted. This was taken to be one of Leichhardt's camps on
his last journey. On 19th July NATIVES were detected in the act of breaking
into the camp and had to be scared away by a charge of shot. Two horses died
from poison on the 21st.</p>
<p>On 4th August, Gregory identified Leichhardt's MCARTHUR RIVER, although he
must have been still considerably south of Leichhardt's course of 1845.</p>
<p>On 19th August, the expedition struck the waters of the NICHOLSON RIVER,
which were followed for more than a week to the east. On the 21st the 138th
meridian was passed and the future territory of Queensland was entered. (SEE
MAP N.) On 30th August, the river was found to bend from east to north and it
was left behind, the party continuing to follow an easterly course, and after
crossing a large tributary, now known as the GREGORY RIVER, camped for the
night on the left bank of the BARKLY <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b>
RIVER.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 269}</u></p>
<p>J. T. Embley connected the Nicholson River with Lawn Hill Creek. (SEE MAP
M.)</p>
<p>Gregory was now in touch with the "<i>Beagle</i>" (1841) and LEICHHARDT
(1845), for the Barkly had only to be followed down a short distance when it
received Leichhardt's BEAME'S BROOK, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> shortly
below which it widened into what Stokes called the Hope Reach of the
"<i>Beagle's</i>" ALBERT RIVER. Beanie's Brook is in reality one of the
channels of the Barkly or Albert River and, as it happens, the only one which
carries running water through all but the most prolonged droughts. On the banks
of the Hope Reach, certain marks on trees were understood to denote the
presence, in the month of March, 1856, of a boat party sent up the Albert by
Lieutenant Chirnmo, of H.M. steamer "<i>Torch</i>."</p>
<p>It had been arranged that the "<i>Tom Tough</i>" should await the land party
on the Albert River, but she had evidently failed to make the rendezvous in
time, and Gregory left instructions which it was expected would be found by
Baines.</p>
<p>It appeared that, having reached Soerabaya, the "<i>Tom Tough</i>" was
overhauled and pronounced to be in need of extensive repairs before she would
be fit for a voyage to the Gulf of Carpentaria. She was therefore left behind,
while another schooner, the "<i>Messenger</i>" was chartered for the service.
The latter reached the Albert on 11th November, and found Gregory's letters.
She then sailed for Sydney by the west coast.</p>
<p>From the right bank of the Albert River below Beame's Brook, Gregory steered
(3rd September) eastward for about 10 miles over box flats and grassy plains to
HARRIS CREEK, which he followed to the NE. for a few miles until he had
satisfied himself that it was one of the heads of the "SALTWATER ARM" of the
Albert. (Here he was 8 miles SE. of the modern township of BURKETOWN.) Then
turning SSE., he crossed CROOKY CREEK, here running north, and another head of
the Saltwater Arm. On the same course, he camped for the night at "Millar's
Waterhole," on MILLAR CREEK, by far the longest tributary of the Saltwater Arm.
The telegraph line from Burketown to Normanton, <i>via</i> Floraville, now
crosses Millar Creek at the water-hole. The names Harris, Crooky and Millar
designate the three branches of the SouthWestern Arm on modern maps, but there
is nothing in the diary or report to indicate that they were bestowed by
Gregory.</p>
<p>The following day (4th February) brought the party by a course still to the
SE., to the bank of a large river which Leichhardt, who had crossed it about 12
miles lower, i.e., down stream, had mistaken for the Albert, but which Gregory
now named the LEICHHARDT. Its course is to the north and it falls into the Gulf
only 2 miles east of the Albert, the mouths of the rivers being interlaced by
the Landsborough Inlet. Gregory's camp of 4th</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 270}</u></p>
<p>September must have been at or very near the modern FLORAVILLE STATION. It
was visited in the evening by a party of nine armed BLACKS, who seemed at first
inclined to be hostile, but eventually retired. On the following morning,
however, they returned, reinforced to the number of nineteen, and rushed the
party, when it was about to make a start, with poised spears, "but just as
their leader was in the act of throwing a spear," says Gregory, "he received a
charge of small shot. This checked them, and we charged them on horseback, and
with a few shots from our revolvers put them to flight, except one man, who
climbed a tree, where we left him."</p>
<p>Without notable incidents, the expedition, travelling eastward, crossed
PUNCHBOWL and "M" CREEKS, heads of MORNING INLET, "L" and ARMSTRONG CREEKS,
tributaries of the Flinders, and reached the FLINDERS on 9th September (18&deg;
8' 41"). Still keeping an easterly course, the camp of the 10th September was
on BROWN CREEK, a tributary of the Norman River. The NORMAN RIVER itself was
crossed next day and followed up, on its right bank, to SSE. to the camp in
18&deg; 18' 5". (SEE MAP L.)</p>
<p>On the 13th September, they steered ENE., through box flats for five or six
hours, and must have crossed BELMORE CREEK&mdash;probably not
recognisable&mdash;some 50 miles below (west of) the present CROYDON GOLDFIELD.
The course was then altered to the north till a dry creek in a rocky channel
was met with, falling to the west, and this was followed down till 6.15 p.m.
when a waterless camp was made. This was, no doubt, CLARINA CREEK. Next day
water was found some distance down the creek, in 17&deg; 59' 26", and the camp
was shifted. This was probably about a mile south of the HAYDEN Station on the
present Normanton-Croydon Railway.</p>
<p>On 15th September, a course of N. 10&deg; E. (mag.) brought the party in six
hours to "a small water-hole in a sandy creek, 15 yards wide," in 17&deg; 46'
11". This must have been the CARRON RIVER ( = CREEN CREEK), some 35 miles below
(WNW. of) the "CREEN CREEK" TELEGRAPH OFFICE of the "seventies."</p>
<p>On the 16th, on a general NNE. course, the party travelled to what must have
been WILLS CREEK, and then followed the creek down to the west in search of
water. The camp had been made in 17&deg; 34' 5", before water was found in a
hole half a mile lower down. A day's halt was made for the sake of the
horses.</p>
<p>On 18th September, a day's march to North 10&deg; East (mag.) brought them
to a fine lagoon on the bank of WALKER CREEK, in 17&deg; 21' 20", about 36
miles below (west of) where the creek leaks out of the Gilbert River. Walker
Creek is one of the mouths of the Gilbert, and falls into the Norman River a
few miles before the latter reaches the Gulf. Two days were spent here in
refreshing the horses, with the exception of one unfortunate which was
killed</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 271}</u></p>
<p>for meat, the flesh being sun-dried. The ration of flour was reduced to
three-quarters of a pound per day.</p>
<p>Three hours, on the 21st, on a NE. course, brought the explorers to the
SMITHBURN BRANCH, or mouth, of Leichhardt's GILBERT RIVER. The branch was then
followed up for some 12 miles and the camp was pitched on the southern or left
bank of the GILBERT'S main channel, in 17&deg; 18' 5" S., just above where the
"branch" leaks out of it.</p>
<p>The left bank of the Gilbert River was then followed up to ESE. The camp of
22nd September was above the outfall of Walker Creek. On the 23rd, east of
where MIRANDA DOWNS Old Station was afterwards built, and west of the Bobby
Towns Lagoon 5 the confluence of the EINASLEIGH RIVER with the Gilbert was
passed unobserved, and the left bank of the GILBERT was followed on a
south-easterly course to a camp in 17&deg; 36' S.</p>
<p>Gregory and his party crossed to the right bank of the river next day, and
followed its south-easterly course, camping on 27th September in 18&deg; 15'
21", near what is now COBB &amp; Co.'s "TONKS" STAGE. The night before, they
had camped near the present GILBERT TELEGRAPH AND POST OFFICE. 1 A belt of
auriferous and cupriferous country was afterwards discovered to extend eastward
from the Gilbert Telegraph Station, through the Cumberland and Etheridge.</p>
<p>Above "Tonks," the Gilbert River first comes from the east for about 12
miles, and then from the south. The party rounded this bend and camped on the
right, or eastern bank, on 29th September in 18&deg; 25' 33", about 4 miles
above the junction of MACDONALD CREEK.</p>
<p>Some distance east of the river, but for the most part keeping it in sight,
the party followed it up to the south on 29th and 30th September and 1st
October, passing through what was afterwards known as the GREEN HILLS
GOLDFIELD. (SEE MAP P.) On the 1st October, the camp was in 18&deg; 40' 29", on
the right bank of a river which Gregory understood to be still the Gilbert, but
he had in reality left the river about 2 miles back and was on the branch now
known as the ROBERTSON RIVER. After <i>reconnaissances</i>, an east-south-east
course was taken and the camp on 4th October was in 18&deg; 47' 54" on the
left, or south-eastern bank of the Robertson River west of MOUNT HELPMAN. On
the 4th the camp was moved 3 miles ENE. up the river, and the three following
days were spent in <i>reconnaissances</i>, while a fourth was lost owing to the
straying of horses.</p>
<p>On 10th and 11th October, the course of the march was to the east. The camp
of the 10th appears to have been between Bowman's Springs and the bend of the
Robertson River, which here runs to the north. On the 11th, the "NEWCASTLE
RANGE"&mdash;by which Gregory appears to have understood the dividing ridge</p>
<blockquote>[1) Not "Gilberton," which is much further up the
river.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 272}</u></p>
<p>between the Robertson and the Einasleigh was crossed, and the camp was made
in 18&deg; 45' 53" S., within a two hours' march (say 5 miles) of the
Copperfield River.</p>
<p>On 12th October, after steering E. 30&deg; N. for an hour and three
quarters, a creek coming from the south was crossed. It had a sandy bed 100
yards wide, but only a few pools of shallow water. [It must have been the
COPPERFIELD RIVER, about 12 miles below (north of) Kidston, the township of the
modern OAKS GOLDFIELD.&mdash;R. L. J.] On the same course, over basaltic
country, another water-course was met with in the afternoon and the camp was
pitched in 18&deg; 38' 12" on a water-hole 70 yards wide. [This must have been
the EINASLEIGH RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>Gregory believed the two rivers met with on this day's march to be
tributaries of Leichhardt's LYND RIVER. As a matter of fact, they unite some 15
miles north of Gregory's track at the modern copper-mining township of
Einasleigh, and the united stream, under the name of the EINASLEIGH RIVER,
falls into the GILBERT about 170 miles lower. The Lynd has its source in the
range which divides the Gulf and Pacific waters about 60 miles N.E. of
Gregory's camp of 12th October.</p>
<p>This misconception persisted for some time after the establishment of
CARPENTARIA DOWNS station on the Einasleigh, which was believed, even by the
owner of the station, to be the Lynd. The Jardine Brothers first, in 1864,
settled the distinctness of the two rivers.</p>
<p>The progress made by Gregory on 13th and 14th October was to the east,
mainly in basaltic country traversed by small tributaries of the Einasleigh
draining to the SW. The camp of the 14th was on one of these, in|granite
country, in lat. 41&deg; 38' S. and long. 144&deg; 33' 15" E.</p>
<p>On 15th October, the so-called "GREAT DIVIDING RANGE" was crossed early in
the day, and at 1.15 p.m. the camp was pitched, in 18&deg; 49' 13", on a small
tributary of the DRY RIVER, which falls into the Burdekin River. Following the
Dry River to the SE., Leichhardt's BURDEKIN RIVER was reached early next day,
and the camp was made at 2 p.m. on its right, or western, bank in 18&deg; 57'
48", about 9 miles above the present GREENVALE head station. It must have been
near the site of that station of the future that Gregory, on 17th October,
noted trees which had been cut with iron axes and a bullock-bone, and judged
these to be traces of LEICHHARDT'S CAMP of 26th April, 1845.</p>
<p>As Gregory was now retracing Leichhardt's tracks, it is unnecessary to
follow his progress minutely, but a few details may be noted. (SEE MAP Q.)</p>
<p>Still following the Burdekin down, Gregory observed, on 21st October, in
19&deg; 16' 22", that the BLACKS used throwing-sticks (wimmeras) to propel
their spears. On 27th October, he crossed</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 273}</u></p>
]
<p>the BROUGHTON RIVER, south-east of Charters Towers, and camped at the mouth
of GLADSTONE CREEK.</p>
<p>He followed the Burdekin to the SE., to its junction with the SUTTOR RIVER,
which comes from the south. He then followed up the Suttor to the south as far
as lat. 21&deg; 22' 43", where he placed his camp of 3rd November.</p>
<p>Six miles south of this camp, the stream now known as the Suttor, branches
off to the east. Gregory, however, followed southward on what is undoubtedly
the more important watercourse, the BELYANDO, which he believed to be the
Suttor. Ten miles above the Suttor, the Belyando is joined by another creek,
which Gregory followed up to E. and SE., still in the belief that he was on the
Suttor. This appears on modern maps as "MISTAKE CREEK," the name being
apparently a sarcastic reference to Gregory's natural&mdash;and
justifiable&mdash;mistake. A branch of this creek goes off to the SE. 45 miles
above its junction with the Belyando, and is named MICLERE CREEK. Gregory
camped on Miclere Creek on 8th November, in lat. 22&deg; 26' 16". Two days
later he camped west of BLAIR ATHOL, on what is now known as GREGORY CREEK,
which runs WNW. into Mistake Creek.</p>
<p>Leichhardt's MACKENZIE RIVER was reached on 15th November. (QUEENSLAND
16-MiLE MAP.) On the 17th, below the junction of the COMET and MACKENZIE
RIVERS, one of LEICHHARDT'S CAMPS on his second journey was identified. On the
22nd, the party arrived at Connor and Fitz's Station on the DAWSON RIVER
(23&deg; 51' 15" S.). Thence, <i>via</i> Rannes (Hay's Station), Rawabelle,
Boondooma, Tabinga, Nanango, Colinton, Kilcoy, Durundur and Caboolture.
BRISBANE was reached on 16th December, 1856.</p>
<p>Gregory did not travel by dead reckoning and rarely gave even his own
estimate of the distance covered. But his carefully taken latitudes and
occasional lunar observations for longitude are thoroughly reliable, and enable
us to lay down the position of his nightly camps with confidence on modern
maps. Kennedy was also an expert surveyor and may have been no less accurate on
his Cape York Peninsula trip, but his records perished with him.</p>
<p>In addition to the charting of his <i>route</i>, Gregory made careful
petrographical notes on the journey which we have followed, and these, so far
as the Peninsula part is concerned, I have added to the map along his line of
travel.</p>
<p>Gregory's expedition (March-July, 1858) in search of Leichhardt did not
touch the Cape York Peninsula.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 275}</u></p>
<p>The sixth and seventh decades of the nineteenth century were "flush" times
in the new colony of Victoria, for the output of the goldfields had flooded it
with prosperity. A period of lavish, extravagant and whimsical private spending
suggested that the Colony should do something worthy of itself in its
collective capacity, and a proposal for a thorough exploration of the interior
of Australia by a strong party equipped as no previous party had ever been was
enthusiastically taken up. A sum of &pound;12,000 was found in Victoria for the
expedition itself, and it has been calculated that, including the relief
expeditions, at least &pound;50,000 was expended. An ideal leader seemed to
have been found in ROBERT O'HARA BURKE, a popular Inspector of Police. With him
was associated WILLIAM JOHN WILLS, at first as astronomical and meteorological
observer, but he soon became second in command. There were in all eighteen men
when the expedition left Melbourne in August, 1860, with at least 20 camels,
numerous horses and drays and 21 tons of provisions.</p>
<p>A dep&ocirc;t, FORT WILLS, Camp 65, was made on Cooper's Creek on the
Queensland side of the South Australian border line, and here Burke and half
the party waited for some time for the arrival of the other half, with the
greater part of the stores. Burke soon grew tired of waiting and, having
determined to make a dash for the GULF OF CARPENTARIA, left Fort Wills on 16th
December, 1860, accompanied by Wills, King and Gray, taking two horses, six
camels and three months' provisions. On a course a little east of north, he
struck the DIAMANTINA, which he named and followed up, and then crossed the
almost imperceptible watershed between that river and the Cloncurry, which
latter river was struck at the site of the future Cloncurry township. (SEE MAP
R.)</p>
<p>The CLONCURRY (which Burke named after Lord Cloncurry) was traced down to
the north till it fell into the Flinders, and the FLINDERS was then followed
down till it debouched on the coastal plain and led the party of four almost to
the sea. (SEE MAP M.) By this time it was the middle of February, 1861, and
four of the camels had died and the stock of provisions had diminished to such
an extent that a single exhausted pack-horse could easily carry it. King and
Gray were therefore left behind on 9th February while Burke and Wills pushed on
through the mangroves. They did not actually see the blue water of the Gulf,
but they saw the salt water rushing through the tortuous passages in the
mangrove swamps with the rise and fall of the tides. The camp (No. 119, lat.
17&deg; 53', according to Wills' Diary) where King and Gray were left behind
has been identified by means of marked trees on the right bank of the Bynoe Arm
(or mouth) of the Flinders, about 5 miles below where it leaks out of the
river. Burke and Wills probably reached (11th February, 1861) a point between
the BYNOE MOUTH OF THE FLINDERS and the mouth of the NORMAN RIVER. From the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 276}</u></p>
<p>time when they struck the Cloncurry they had entertained the belief that
that river and the Flinders were Stokes' ALBERT RIVER. As it happened, the
mistake mattered nothing to them, but it meant a great deal to those who went
out in search of them later on.</p>
<p>Burke and Wills having rejoined King and Gray (12th February), no time was
lost in facing southward towards the dep&ocirc;t on Cooper's Creek. The party
apparently retraced their steps past the site of the future township of
Cloncurry (where they had first struck the river), and then followed the river
up to the infall of the MALBON RIVER, after which it would be natural for them
to shorten the way by taking the chord of the arc described on the outward
journey in following up the Diamantina. (SEE MAP R.) Keeping on a southerly
course and crossing the SELWYN RANGE by O'Hara's Gap, they struck a river
falling to the south and now known as the BURKE RIVER. Following this river
they passed the site of the future BOULIA township (in Sheet 12A).</p>
<p>Three of the party reached the FORT WILLS DEP&Ocirc;T late on 21st April,
1861. The fourth, CHARLES GRAY, had succumbed, on the way, to fatigue and
hunger on the 17th. The day's delay caused by his obsequies had tragic
consequences for the three survivors.</p>
<p>William Brahe and three other men had been left in charge of the dep&ocirc;t
to await (1) the arrival of the second half of the full expedition (with
stores) and (2) the return of Burke and his companions from their ill-advised
dash to the Gulf. Neither event, although long overdue, having taken place, and
his own stores having been dangerously depleted, he left the camp at noon on
the very day of Burke's arrival, having first buried a note to that effect,
which was found by Burke. He also left some provisions.</p>
<p>Emaciated and footsore as Burke and his companions now were, they judged
that they could not hope for success in chasing a party mounted on animals
which presumably were fresh and in good condition. One is inevitably reminded
of the agonising moment when Kennedy's party, left to starve and die at the
mouth of the Pascoe, saw and failed to attract the attention of the rescue
ship.</p>
<p>Burke, Wills and John King spent altogether about a week at the dep&ocirc;t,
while in one false start one of the two camels died. Another false start was
made and each man carried a bundle, in addition to a pack carried by the last
camel; but they had not gone far when the camel knocked up and they had to
return to the camp. Their plan had been to go down Cooper's Creek for some
distance and strike west for Eyre's Mount Hopeless. The camel was shot and the
meat sun-dried, and for a few days the men depended for food mainly on the alms
given them by a tribe of friendly natives, who ultimately left them to their
own resources. They then tried to live as the blacks did, but the time spent in
finding and preparing nardoo to support life left them no time for</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 277}</u></p>
<p>progress towards their goal. Wills, unable to travel, was left behind, while
Burke and King went back to the dep&ocirc;t in search of the natives. BURKE
DIED next morning, and King returned to where WILLS had been left, and found
him also DEAD. BRAKE'S PARTY, all this time, had not been far away. In fact,
had the Gulf party waited at the dep&ocirc;t till 8th May, they would have been
found by Brahe and Wright who, after they had effected a junction, visited the
dep&ocirc;t together on that date. Strange to say, Brahe and Wright observed no
trace of the Gulf party's recent occupation of the camp, and they themselves
left no trace by which King, who returned a few days later, could gather that
they had been on the spot.</p>
<p>Before it was too late, KING again fell in with the blacks, who supported
him for nearly three months, until he was RESCUED by A. W. Ho WITT'S search
party on 15th September.</p>
<p>One of BRAHE'S PARTY, named Patton, died at the dep&ocirc;t. WRIGHT'S PARTY,
which was to have brought on the bulk of the provisions to the dep&ocirc;t, but
failed to do so, was delayed by an outbreak of scurvy and the death of three of
its members, Messrs. Stone and Purcell and Dr. Beckler.</p>
<p>In some respects the story of Burke and Wills is strikingly parallel to that
of Kennedy. Both expeditions were marked by the high courage of their leaders,
by their many mistakes in judgment, by the hamper of over-equipment, by the
frequency of harrowing delays and disappointments, leading to fatal results,
and by sufferings beyond the capacity of the human frame. But they differed
widely as regards the attitude observed by the aboriginal NATIVES. The northern
tribes dogged Kennedy's footsteps day after day, malignantly watching for signs
of exhaustion which would give them the opportunity to attack with impunity. On
the other hand, the tribe into whose hands Burke, Wills and King fell, treated
their guests with what was nothing short of philanthropy, considering their own
limited means.</p>
<p>It has already been pointed out, in the case of the survivors of the
"<i>Maria</i>" that even two neighbouring tribes might act on diametrically
opposite principles. In one case there was barbarous murder, and in the other,
help unceasing and unselfish.</p>

<p>The Brahe and Wright sections of Burke's expedition, having effected a
junction and visited Fort Wills (8th May, 1861), hastened back to civilisation.
Their reports reached Melbourne in the end of June, and steps were at once
taken to send out various parties in search of the missing men. The most
successful was that led by A. W. HOWITT, which rescued the only survivor, KING
(15th September), and found the bodies of WILLS and BURKE. There was no
occasion for this party to extend their search in the direction of the Cape
York Peninsula.</p>
<h5>I. LANDSBOROUGH</h5>
<p>Moved by the Royal Society of Victoria, the Victorian Government, with the
assistance of the Queensland Government, dispatched the "<i>Firefly</i>," a
200-ton brig, Captain Kirby, conveying WILLIAM LANDSBOROUGH and his party, who
were to land at the Gulf of Carpentaria, and commence a search for Burke and
his men. Unfortunately the brig was severely damaged at the Sir Charles Hardy
Islands, but she was refitted and ultimately taken (with twenty-five horses) to
the Albert River by COMMANDER NORMAN of H.M. Colonial Steamship
"<i>Victoria</i>" where the hulk was utilised as a dep&ocirc;t. <b style=

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 280}</u></p>
<p>The "<i>Victoria</i>" anchored on 1st October, 1861, 28 miles up the ALBERT
RIVER (20 miles in a straight line), where the water, although influenced by
tides, was fresh. Landsborough recommended as a site for the proposed
dep&ocirc;t to be formed of the "<i>Firefly</i>" hulk the vicinity of "a narrow
mere which I called Wood's Lake," i.e., the site of the future township of
BURKETOWN. (SEE MAP M.) The report in which this recommendation is made was
addressed to Captain Norman and is dated Sweers Island, 8th October. After that
date, the "<i>Victoria</i>" must have come on to the ALBERT INLET, and
established the dep&ocirc;t. Landsborough finally set out from the dep&ocirc;t
on 17th October. As Burke had reported that he followed the Albert River to the
sea, Landsborough's first task was to run that river up. He found its main
feeder to be the GREGORY RIVER, which, with its important branch, the
O'SHANASSY, he traced to SSW., almost to the source of the latter, naturally
without seeing any trace of Burke, who had mistaken a mouth of the Flinders for
the Albert. (SEE MAPS N AND R.) He then crossed the BARKLY TABLELAND to the
south and followed down the Herbert (now GEORGINA) River to 20&deg; 11' 15" S.
(27th December, 1861), i.e., to a few miles south of the present CAMOOWEAL
township, where the threatening attitude of the NATIVES made it advisable,
considering the numerical weakness of his party, to turn back. He named the
GREGORY and O'SHANASSY RIVERS, and the SEYMOUR and THORNTON RIVERS, tributaries
of the latter, the BARKLY TABLELAND and the HERBERT (NOW GEORGINA) RIVER.</p>
<p>On passing BEAME'S BROOK on his return journey from this "FIRST EXPEDITION,"
he observed (18th January, 1862) the tracks of an exploring party making for
the dep&ocirc;t on the Albert. (These must have been WALKER'S TRACKS.) He
reached the dep&ocirc;t early next day. (SEE MAP M.)</p>
<p>On what is called his "SECOND EXPEDITION," Landsborough left the FIREFLY
HULK DEP&Ocirc;T on 8th February, 1862. Crossing the LEICHHARDT RIVER on 14th
February, at a ford formed by a basaltic ledge, just above the influence of the
tide, in latitude 18&deg; 10' 30" S. (where is now FLORAVILLE TELEGRAPH
STATION), he struck out to the south-east and passed DONNOR'S HILL on the
CLONCURRY RIVER close enough to note that it was composed of sandstone and
conglomerate and reached the FLINDERS RIVER on 19th February. (SEE MAP R.) This
course would take him up the valley of the ALEXANDRA RIVER, a tributary of the
Leichhardt, for about 40 miles and up the valley of its tributary, COLLIER
CREEK, for some 16 miles, and then for a few miles across the watershed between
the Alexandra and the Cloncurry Rivers. He then followed up the Flinders (SSE.)
<i>via</i> FORT BOWEN, MOUNT BROWN, MOUNT LITTLE, HERVEY DOWNS, O'CONNELL CREEK
(near the modern township and railway station of RICHMOND), SLOANE CREEK,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 281}</u></p>
<p>WALKER CREEK and JARDINE CREEK, to all of which places he gave their names.
(SEE MAP Q.) Between Walker Creek and the Jardine he passed the site of the
modern town of HUGHENDEN. On 8th March, on O'CONNELL CREEK, he saw CATTLE
TRACKS, and on WALKER CREEK he discovered TRACKS which he (no doubt correctly)
believed to be those of WALKER'S PARTY. From the Jardine Valley he crossed the
low WATERSHED BETWEEN THE GULF OF CARPENTARIA AND THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN BIGHT
and passed southward to COXON CREEK, one of the heads of the Thomson River.
Coxon Creek led him to TOWERHILL CREEK, which he followed southward, apparently
to its junction with Cornish and Landsborough Creeks, which unite with
Towerhill Creek and form the THOMSON RIVER. From the Thomson River he crossed
country to the south-east to the WARREGO RIVER, which he followed down to
Williams' station on the DARLING (21st May, 1862).</p>
<p>As regards the primary object of his travels, the evidence procured by
Landsborough was of a purely negative character, but perhaps more than any
explorer of these regions he had the good fortune to demonstrate the existence
of an enormous extent of first-rate PASTORAL COUNTRY.</p>
<p>The steamer "<i>Victoria</i>" was back in Moreton Bay on 14th March,
1862.</p>
<p>A sequel to Landsborough's expedition was the race for the magnificent
pastoral country described by him. One of the first starters was ERNEST HENRY,
of Mount McConnell station, near the junction of the Belyando with the Burdekin
River. He had been, as a member of one of George Elphinstone Dalrymple's
expeditions, among the earliest to follow up Leichhardt's discoveries in that
region. In his early youth he had served as a subaltern officer in the Crimean
War. Along with a companion named Devlin, he pushed through the spinifex
country between the Cape and Flinders Rivers. Descending to the Jardine Valley,
he followed the Flinders down to a point which he selected as the site for a
new station, on which he bestowed the name of HUGHENDEN, the Tudor manor house
in Buckinghamshire owned by his grandfather, and known to fame in later days as
the residence of Benjamin Disraeli. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The name
in due course passed on to the town which grew up near the station. Not long
after the foundation of the station, Henry drifted westward and discovered the
mineral riches of CLON CURRY. He died at Epping, near Sydney, on 26th March,
1919.</p>
<p>Another of the immediate effects of Landsborough's expedition was the
settlement of the fine "country" on the ALBERT RIVER, or Inlet. First observed
by STOKES in 1841, the importance of this district was emphasised by
LANDSBOROUGH in a manner which ensured attention. The leader in this new
enterprise was JOHN</p>
<blockquote>[1) "Early Carpentaria," by "Pioneer." <i>The World's News</i>, 5th
May, 1906.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 282}</u></p>
<p>GRAHAM MACDONALD, who was already known in other districts as an
enthusiastic explorer. When Landsborough's report became known, Macdonald
started at once for the "Albert." He was then resident at CARPENTARIA DOWNS
station, as Managing Partner of the firm of Towns and Black, of which Mr.
(afterwards Sir) John Robertson was a member. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
This station had just been taken up, and was supposed to be on LEICHHARDT'S
LYND RIVER, but shortly afterwards Jardine proved it to be a tributary of the
Gilbert and named it the EINASLEIGH. Macdonald's was the "old" station, not the
one which now appears on maps <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> and which I saw
in course of erection by the Brothers Barker in 1886. <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> The "old" station (which was Jardine's starting-point
in 1864) is about 11 miles to the north, down the Einasleigh.</p>
<p>Macdonald gives the position of the old station, from information supplied
to him by A. J. Richardson, the surveyor attached to Jardine's expedition, as
18&deg; 37' 10" S. and 144&deg; 3' 30" E., and Richardson himself in his
Journal <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b> gives the same figures, with the
addition that the longitude was the mean of seven sets of lunar observations,
and the latitude the mean of several northern and southern observations. The
latitude is correct, according to modern mapping, but the longitude is about 8
miles too far west. (SEE MAP P.)</p>
<p>From the "old" station, then, which was at the time the "furthest north" of
settlement, and which he left on 31st August, 1864, Macdonald struck south-west
and saw the ROBERTSON RIVER (which he named) at the apex of its V-shaped bend
to NW. and NE. Continuing to the south-west, he cut the GILBERT RIVER, which he
followed northward to the (future) Cumberland Goldfield. (SEE MAPS Q AND L.)
The names MACDONALD TOWN and MACDONALD CREEK are reminiscent of this trip,
although they were bestowed by later comers. From the Cumberland, Macdonald
followed the river on its westward and north-westward course to about opposite
the modern STRATHMORE STATION, when, having headed the CARRON (or Charron?)
RIVER, he turned to the west. After crossing the Carron River, which falls into
the NORMAN RIVER, he crossed the latter at GLENORE, where the modern railway
from Normanton to the Croydon Goldfield now crosses it. (SEE MAP M.) After
crossing the FLINDERS RIVER, he turned more to the south (almost to SW.) and,
practically on the line now taken by the telegraph poles, struck the LEICHHARDT
RIVER in about 18&deg; 14' S. latitude. Thence he went westward to the GREGORY
RIVER, which&mdash;under the names of the Barkly and the Albert&mdash;he
followed down northward,</p>

<p>almost, if not quite, to the site of BURKETOWN (30th September). Thence he
returned (SE. by E.&frac12;E.) to his former crossing of the Leichhardt, where
he fixed upon the site of a head station, to be called FLORAVILLE, designed to
command the greater part of what Stokes had designated the PLAINS OF PROMISE
nearly a quarter of a century before.</p>
<p>His return track to Carpentaria Downs was almost the same as his outward
track; indeed, he generally camped at his old camps. On arriving, however, at
the ROBERTSON RIVER, he ran the river up to its head. (Gregory had already run
it up for some distance in 1856, although he had not given it a name.)
Macdonald arrived at CARPENTARIA DOWNS on 22nd October, 1864.</p>
<p>Very shortly afterwards he took cattle along his tracks to stock the new
Floraville station. In May, 1865, he chartered the "<i>Jackmel Packet</i>" for
the conveyance of supplies to Burketown.</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonald, who afterwards was a Police Magistrate, died in Brisbane in
1918.</p>
<h5>II. WALKER, 1861-2</h5>
<p>FREDERICK WALKER, an officer of Native Police, with troopers and a few white
men, among whom were Haughton, Rodney and Macalister, was sent to search for
Burke or his tracks on a traverse from the east coast of Queensland to the Gulf
of Carpentaria. He came north by the "<i>Firefly</i>" which also carried
Landsborough's party, and landed at Rockhampton, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> from which he travelled westward to "Mr. Macintosh's
station on the Nogoa." The station was left behind on 15th September, 1861.
Passing EMERALD DOWNS on the 20th, Walker reached Dismal Creek, a tributary of
the BARCOO RIVER, at the intersection of the 146th meridian and 24th parallel,
i.e., between the modern townships of BLACKALL and JERICHO. On 30th October,
after having, apparently, travelled <i>via</i> Barcaldine, Aramac, Muttaburra,
Cameron Downs and Afton Downs, he reached (at his Camp 30) and named the
STAWELL RIVER, which he then followed up about 12 miles northward to its
junction with the WOOLGAR. (SEE MAP Q.) Crossing the river (to which he gave
its name), he struck out north-west, and on 10th November (Camp 36) cut a
river, running north-west, which might be either the "Bynoe" or the NORMAN.
(SEE MAP R.) Modern charting proves that it was the latter. He followed</p>

<p>this river down for 120 miles and left it, near his Camp 48, on 25th
November. (SEE MAP M.) His 45th Camp (21st November) was opposite the site of
the modern VENA PARK STATION.</p>
<p>West of Camp 48, he struck the FLINDERS RIVER (25th November, Camp 49) about
3 miles north of Gregory's camp of 9th September, 1856, and 6 miles north of
the modern MILGARRA station, but had to follow up the right bank of the river
to the south for a couple of miles above Milgarra before he found a convenient
crossing. On the bank of the river he found CAMEL AND HORSE TRACKS, making down
stream, which could only have been made by BURKE'S expedition.</p>
<p>Keeping a course of west by north from the Flinders, almost on Gregory's
track, he crossed ARMSTRONG, "L," GOAT and "M" CREEKS, camping on the latter
(28th November, Camp 52) near the GEARY HILLS. He recognised this as very GOOD
PASTORAL COUNTRY.</p>
<p>On 1st December, salt water was met with on LAGOON CREEK, a tributary of the
Leichhardt, and after a considerable southward detour the LEICHHARDT RIVER
itself was reached. But it was "salt 'as brine." Followed up to SSE. for 8
miles it was still salt, but fresh water was found in a small creek (Camp 55,
1st December, 1861). Here the NATIVES made a threatening attack. Few details
are given, but it is stated that "their (the blacks') right wing, which was the
strongest, got over the river and were off, but the centre and left wing
suffered a heavy loss." Near the camp, a camp of the natives was found to
contain a sailor's jumper and an empty brandy bottle.</p>
<p>Steering NNW., Walker's Camp 56 (2nd December) was on MILLAR'S CREEK, close
to Gregory's of 3rd September, 1856. A course of NNW. brought him next day
(Camp 57) to the Albert (Barkly or GREGORY) River, where the water was slightly
salt and influenced by the tides. After the camp had been made snug, the sound
of a GUN was heard down the river.</p>
<p>Near this camp, on the 4th, a tree marked by GREGORY (1856) was found, and
also a buried bottle containing a letter from CAPTAIN NORMAN, dated 29th
November, stating that the "<i>Victoria's</i>" dep&ocirc;t was 12 miles down
the river (i.e., on the site of the modern town of BURKETOWN). Walker crossed
the BARKLY RIVER and BEAME'S BROOK, and on 7th December, 1861, "shook hands
with Captain Norman."</p>
<p>At the dep&ocirc;t, Walker was supplied with the rations and stores
necessary to replenish his equipment, and eagerly addressed himself to the task
of taking up BURKE'S TRACKS from the point where he had seen them on the
Flinders. He hastened back to the FLINDERS, no doubt, avoiding the difficulties
which had delayed him on his outward course, and succeeded in tracking Burke to
"two or three camps," i.e., probably to his Camp 119, when he</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 285}</u></p>
<p>had to give it up, owing to the obliteration of the hoof-marks by rain. His
exact course from this point to Port Denison, which he reached on 5th May,
cannot be traced, as his journal, as printed by the Royal Geographical Society,
ends with his meeting with Captain Norman. Westgarth's map in "McKinlay's
Tracks" sketchily indicates Walker's homeward <i>route</i>, and if the sketch
is correct, Walker's <i>route</i> must have been partly up the Lynd (and it is
difficult to imagine what could have taken him there) and on, <i>via</i> Bowen,
to Rockhampton. On the other hand, Landsborough saw TRACKS which there was
every reason to believe to be WALKER'S on what he named WALKER'S CREEK, between
Richmond and Hughenden, so that the probability is that Walker ran up the
Flinders and struck eastward for Port Denison, crossing the heads of the
Thomson and Cape Rivers, and the Belyando and Bowen Rivers on his way to Port
Denison.</p>
<p>Walker's correspondence with Captain Norman shows that his first intention
was to make for Adelaide <i>via</i> Eyre Creek on the conclusion of his task of
tracking the hoof-marks of the camels. Seeing where he left the camel track, he
probably argued that Burke and Wills must have made good their return to Fort
Cooper, and he was probably influenced by considerations of his own chances of
not finding water on Eyre Creek in deciding in favour of the Port Denison
<i>route</i>.</p>
<h5>III. McKINLAY <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></h5>
<p>JOHN McKiNLAY was born at Sandbank, on the Clyde, in 1819, and settled in
Australia when still a young man. McKinlay's party (officially known as the
South Australian Burke Relief Expedition) was composed of W. O. Hodgkinson
(second in command), afterwards Minister for Mines, Queensland; John Davis;
Robert Poole; Middleton (camel driver); E. Palmer (bullock driver); Bell and
Wylde; and Frank, an aboriginal. It left ADELAIDE on 16th August, 1861. The
work of the expedition had already been done by Howitt, although the news had
not yet reached Adelaide. On 20th October, McKinlay found human remains
(27&deg; 15' S.; 140&deg; E.), which must have been those of Gray, although,
misled by cock-and-bull stories told by the blacks in circumstantial detail, he
regarded them as evidence of the massacre of the whole of Burke's party,
followed by a cannibal orgy. He had a rather serious encounter with the NATIVES
three days later. Hodgkinson was shortly afterwards sent back on a mission to
Blanche Water Station, in South Australia, and on his return, in about five
weeks,</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 286}</u></p>
<p>brought the news of Hewitt's rescue of King. McKinlay next found Hewitt's
camp and visited the graves of Wills and Burke.</p>
<p>Leaving the region which had already yielded up its story, McKinlay
determined to get on the track of Burke further north. According to his diary
he ran up the "Mueller River" (the DIAMANTINA) to its head (22&deg; 40' S.
lat., 8th April, 1862). It is now understood that he actually came up the
HAMILTON RIVER, east of Boulia, crossed the SELWYN RANGE by "McKiNLAY'S GAP,"
and ran for some distance northward down the "McKiNLAY RIVER." (SEE MAP R.) He
probably followed the McKinlay (which, lower down, is called the Gilliat) down
to its junction with the CLON CURRY (30th April), which latter river here, and
here only, runs, as described by him, from west to east, its general course
being from south to north. Twenty-five miles below the junction, <i>viz.</i>,
at Caroline Creek, the CLONCURRY River approaches the FLINDERS RIVER (which
lies east of it), and for the next 32 miles of their northerly course the two
rivers are seldom as much as 4 miles apart. In fact, now that the rivers have
deployed on the coastal plains, the usual "anastomosis" has commenced, and from
the Cloncurry eastward, high floods would connect that river with channels
running into the Flinders, the Saxby and the Norman Rivers.</p>
<p>Keeping the left, or western, bank of the Cloncurry River, McKinlay crossed
and named the DUGALD RIVER (2nd May, 1862). He had been practically on Burke
and Wills' track since he struck the Cloncurry, but observed no trace of the
lost expedition. By the time he crossed the Dugald, however, he must have been
fully convinced that the river he was following, lead where it might, was not
taking him to the Albert Inlet, although Burke and Wills had believed they were
on the Albert when they reached the sea 72 miles east of that inlet. He,
therefore, steered north-west from the Dugald River and, on 6th May, struck
Gregory's LEICHHARDT RIVER in 18&deg; 55' S. lat. (7 miles below the modern
LORRAINE cattle station). He then followed the Gregory down to the north (past
the modern AUGUSTUS DOWNS station) to the sea (Camp 60, 18th-21st May, 1862).
(SEE MAP M.) This camp was probably between the ALBERT INLET and LANDSBOROUGH
INLET, the latter of which connects the Albert with the Leichhardt. In spite of
the mistake which he was now aware Burke must have made, McKinlay had to visit
the Albert Inlet, where he might chance to meet the parties which were to come
by sea and commence the search from the Gulf. He saw a tree which had marked
LANDSBOROUGH'S Camp 5 in February, 1862.</p>
<p>He had now proved that the Albert was <i>not</i> the river which Burke and
Wills had followed to the sea: the ship which had conveyed Landsborough's
expedition had already left the inlet. His provisions were diminishing to
danger-point; he knew that the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 287}</u></p>
<p>lost men had been found, and there was no further reason why he should
linger. Therefore, as his rations would not suffice to carry him back to
Adelaide, he made for PORT DENISON, then the northmost known harbour on the
east coast.</p>
<p>Retracing his steps up the Leichhardt, he crossed to the right bank about 6
miles north of the site of the present FLORAVILLE TELEGRAPH OFFICE. Thence, on
an eastward course, differing little from Gregory's (1856) and Walker's
(December, 1861), he came, on 5th June (Camp 12), to a large, broad creek, or
mass of creeks, or river&mdash;the Flinders. His 14th Camp (7th-11th June) was
on the NORMAN RIVER (which he named), opposite Gregory's camp of 10th
September, 1856, and Walker's camp (No. 48) of 24th November, 1861. From the
Flinders, he travelled, mainly E. by S., crossing the range (sandstone on
granite) dividing tributaries of Belmore Creek from tributaries of the Gilbert
River. (SEE MAP L.)</p>
<p>[The modern Croydon township is on Belmore Creek, about 10 miles north of
McKinlay's track, and is the centre of the goldfield which was opened in
January, 1886, in consequence of the discovery of payable gold by W. C. Brown,
the owner of Croydon Downs cattle station, and the brothers T. and R. Aldridge.
In 1887, the population was about 6,000. <b style="color:#603000">[1]]</b></p>
<p>The range which McKinlay crossed south-east of Croydon was named by him the
GREGORY RANGE. It has since proved fairly rich in reef GOLD and stream TIN.
McKinlay was under the erroneous impression that the waters draining the
south-western side of the range represented the principal head of the Flinders.
Turning to the south-east, he struck the GILBERT RIVER, which he provisionally
called Stuart Creek, being unaware of the name it already bore. He followed the
Gilbert to the south-east till the PERCY RIVER fell in, and traced the latter
north-eastward to its source (PERCYVILLE, now a gold and copper-mining centre).
(SEE MAP P.) From the head of the Percy River, McKinlay appears to have kept
the same north-easterly course, crossing the COPPERFIELD RIVER near the modern
mining township of KIDSTON, and the EINASLEIGH RIVER south of the now "old"
(but then nonexistent) CARPENTARIA DOWNS station. Then, crossing the "GREAT
DIVIDING RANGE" (here unimportant) between the Gulf and Pacific Waters, he got
on the head of the DRY RIVER, and followed it, and the BURDEKIN RIVER, into
which it flows, down to the junction of the BELYANDO RIVER, practically on
Gregory's tracks. (SEE MAPS O AND Q.) All the way down the Burdekin, dray
tracks</p>

for food on 31st July and the horses were by this time reduced to nineteen.
This day he and his party buried "everything but the clothes they stood
in."</p>
<p>On 2nd August, 1862, McKinlay reached civilisation at HARVEY AND SOMERS'
STATION on the BOWEN RIVER (a tributary of the Burdekin). Five miles further
they reached STRATHMORE STATION, where Messrs. Sellheim <b style=

for a week. Near the station was a camp of NATIVE POLICE, under a white

<p>QUEENSLAND was separated from New South Wales in 1859. The Governor of the
new colony, SIR GEORGE BOWEN, on his return from a voyage to the northern
ports, recommended SOMERSET, Cape York, as the site of a settlement, "on
account of its geographical importance, as harbour of refuge, coaling station
and <i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> for the trade of Torres Strait and the North
Pacific." MR. JOHN JARDINE, then Police Magistrate and Gold Commissioner at
Rockhampton, was placed in charge of the new settlement as "Government
Resident" and a detachment of marines was landed in 1863.</p>
<p>Gradually as it became evident that the prevailing industries of the new
settlement were destined to be chiefly maritime, THURSDAY ISLAND, off the
mainland of Cape York, became the chief dep&ocirc;t for the ships engaged in
the search for pearls, pearl-shell and <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> and the seat
of Government was eventually transferred to the island.</p>
<p>Shortly after his installation, Mr. Jardine foresaw the necessity for a
regular supply of FRESH MEAT to the new settlement, and proposed to the
Government to send his two sons, Frank (22) and Alick (20) overland with a herd
of cattle to form a station from which it might be supplied. The proposal was
agreed to and the Government instructed a surveyor to accompany the
expedition.</p>
<p>With all the advantages of health and youth, and above all, of training from
their childhood in the bushmanship which Australia requires and bestows, the
two brothers were unusually well qualified</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 290}</u></p>
<p>to lead such an expedition as that on which they were about to embark. For
them no glamour of romance shone in the far north to lure them to adventure.
Their object was strictly business. Their attitude towards the natives was from
the first fair and considerate, but on the other hand they were determined to
"stand no nonsense." The lessons unintentionally taught by Leichhardt and
Kennedy had not been thrown away upon the young explorers. They chose their
line of advance with a view to its capacity for the support of travelling
cattle.</p>
<p>In the sixteen years that had elapsed since Kennedy had set out from
Rockingham Bay, the settlement of northern Queensland had made rapid strides.
Ports had been opened at MACKAY, BOWEN, CARDWELL and SOMERSET, and pastoral
occupation was approaching the Gulf of Carpentaria. The whole of the CAPE YORK
PENINSULA, however, was still unoccupied except for the settlement at its
extreme northern point, and the BROTHERS JARDINE were destined to be the FIRST
TO TRAVERSE IT from end to end. The ill-starred KENNEDY, as we have already
seen, almost succeeded, but laid down his life within a few miles of the
goal.</p>
<p>The younger brother, ALICK, led a party of ten, with thirty-one horses,
overland from Rockhampton (14th May, 1864) to Bowen (17th June). Six more
HORSES were added when the elder brother, FRANK, joined the party at Bowen on
16th July and five more belonging to MR. RICHARDSON, the Surveyor, brought the
total up to forty-two. The CATTLE were collected at Bowen, and, as opportunity
offered, between Bowen and CARPENTARIA DOWNS. The latter station, which had
recently been taken up by J. G. MACDONALD, was at that time the NORTHMOST
dwelling-place along the Jardines' <i>route</i>, and they selected it as the
spot where their expedition was to be finally mobilised.</p>
<p>The PARTY which left Carpentaria Downs included: Frank Lascelles Jardine;
Alick Jardine; Archibald J. Richardson (Surveyor); C. Scrutton; R. N. Binney;
A. Cowderoy and four black boys named Eulah, Peter, Sambo and Barney; ten
persons in all. They carried "provisions estimated to last, with care, four
months." The main item was 1,200 lb. of flour. The "mob" of cattle numbered
about 250 head of bullocks and cows.</p>
<p>The CARPENTARIA DOWNS STATION of these days was the "OLD" STATION, now shown
in the 16-mile map in 18&deg; 37' 10" S. lat., while the modern station, of
which I saw the beginnings in 1886, is also shown on the map in 18&deg; 44'.
(SEE MAP P.) It was situated on the right, or eastern, bank of the EINASLEIGH
RIVER which was then believed to be Leichhardt's "LYND." A station higher up
the valley, to the south, still retains the latter name.</p>
<p>While waiting for his brother at Carpentaria Downs, ALICK JARDINE set out on
3rd September to reconnoitre the <i>route</i> to be followed by the expedition
down the SUPPOSED LYND RIVER. He</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 291}</u></p>
<p>was accompanied by HARRY BODE (who was on the look out for cattle country),
his own black boy "Eulah" and Mr. Bode's black boy. It may be mentioned that I
met Mr. Bode in 1879 when he was residing near Bowen. ALICK JARDINE traced the
river for 180 miles, to north-west and west, and from the fact that it had not
joined Leichhardt's Mitchell River, and other circumstances, he satisfied
himself that it was NOT THE LYND, and the name "EINASLEIGH" was conferred on
it. No adventure marked the outward journey. On the return two parties of
NATIVES were met with, but they displayed no hostility. The party RETURNED, on
21st September, TO CARPENTARIA DOWNS, where they remained till the arrival of
Frank Jardine, with the cattle, on 6th October.</p>
<p>The JARDINE BROTHERS kept DIARIES which were afterwards EDITED by FREDERICK
J. BYERLEY, Staff Surveyor, Rockhampton, a gentleman whom I afterwards knew,
and who was gifted with literary talents which made the task a congenial one.
Byerley's amplification of the diaries, under the title of <i>Narrative of the
Overland Expedition of the Messrs. Jardine from Rockhampton to Cape Fork,
Northern Queensland</i>, was published in Brisbane by J. W. Buxton in 1867.</p>
<p>RICHARDSON also kept a DIARY and charted the <i>route</i> travelled, and a
paper by him, entitled <i>An Overland Expedition from Port Denison to Cape York
under the Command of F. and A. Jardine, Esqrs.</i>, was read before the Royal
Geographical Society of London on 27th November, 1865. The paper was
accompanied by a MAP on the scale of 40 miles to an inch showing the
<i>route</i> followed by the main expedition. As he always accompanied the main
caravan, he had no first-hand information to give regarding the numerous and
important <i>reconnaissances</i> of the brothers.</p>
<p>BYERLEY'S publication also includes a MAP (on a 38-mile scale), which is
practically Richardson's, with the addition, however, of KENNEDY'S <i>route</i>
and with the omission of the Lynd River (of Leichhardt's charting). Regarding
KENNEDY'S <i>route</i>, as charted by Byerley, it may be observed that it
differs considerably from the <i>route</i> as I have charted it, by the aid of
surveys which were nonexistent in Byerley's time.</p>
<p>The EXPEDITION finally LEFT CARPENTARIA DOWNS on 11th October. It is only
possible to give a short summary of the incidents and observations made by the
travellers until they come within the region which is more immediately the
subject of this review. (SEE MAP K.)</p>
<p>Between the 11th and 22nd October, the caravan had covered 120 miles DOWN
THE EINASLEIGH VALLEY, the LAST CAMP (No. 13) being near the right bank of the
river about 5 miles above the point where the Etheridge River, coming from the
south, falls into the Einasleigh. (SEE MAP L.) In this portion of their course,
except for the last day and a half, the travellers found</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 292}</u></p>
<p>exceedingly rough country, their choice of evils often being between barren
ridges and a river bed hemmed in by basaltic cliffs or flowing over high bars
of granite; both horses and cattle suffered severely and the cows began to
calve.</p>
<p>The BLACKS gave no actual trouble, although they had to be carefully guarded
against. About fifty of them, "painted and fully armed," dogged the heels of
the party on 15th and 16th October from Cawana Swamp to opposite Barney's Nob.
Another "mob" was surprised on the 18th and decamped with their weapons, which
included spears and a large stone axe. On the following day, near the lower
junction of the anabranch named PARALLEL CREEK, HUMAN REMAINS were seen
roasting on a fire. "Whether this was the body of an enemy cooked for food or
of a friend disposed of after the manner of their last rites must," says Frank,
"remain a mystery until the country and its denizens become better known." On
the 21st, two blacks were seen spearing fish. It was judged advisable that the
CATTLE AND the majority of the HORSES should REST AND FEED at Camp 13 while the
brothers reconnoitred the proposed course. The valley had now become more open
and it was surmised that a way might be found to the north, whereas the
Einasleigh was now bearing them steadily westward. It is now known that the
EINASLEIGH falls into the right bank of the GILBERT RIVER about 50 miles west
of the Jardines' Camp 13. To ONE OF THE MOUTHS OF THE GILBERT, ACCIDENT INLET,
JAN CARSTENSZOON, on the Dutch ship "<i>Pera</i>" gave the name of the STATEN
RIVER on 24th April, 1623.</p>
<p>The following is a brief summary of the ITINERARY of the expedition from
Carpentaria Downs "Old Station" to the mouth of the Etheridge River, as read in
the light of modern maps:&mdash;</p>
<p>11th October, 1864. DOWN EINASLEIGH RIVER, NW. Byerley says 20 miles,
Richardson 19. Distance by map, 14 miles. (SEE MAPS P AND K.)</p>
<p>At 5 miles passed MOUNT EULAH (now called MOUNT HARRY), CAMP No. 1, a mile
N. of junction of COPPERFIELD RIVER, near EINASLEIGH COPPER MINE and EINASLEIGH
STATION on the modern RAILWAY from Chillagoe to the Etheridge. Richardson gives
LATITUDE of camp as 18&deg; 23' 59", which is 7 miles too far north.</p>
<p>12th October. Shifted to CAMP 2, 1&frac12; miles down the EINASLEIGH. (SEE
MAP K.)</p>
<p>13th October. Travelled NNW. down the EINASLEIGH. Passed the MOUNT ALDER
GOLD DIGGINGS of the future. Passed lagoon now known as "JARDINE'S LAGOON,"
CAMP 3, on a small dry creek (LIGHTHOUSE CREEK?). Distance travelled 11 miles
(B.), 10 miles (R.)</p>
<p>14th October. Travelled 11 miles NNW. down the EINASLEIGH. CAMP 4 on
junction of CANAL CREEK with the river. The creek is described as "deep, sandy
and dry, 80 yards wide, coming from</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 293}</u></p>
<p>ENE., its banks steep, and lined with immense Melaleuca trees"; "also," says
Byerley, quoting Jardine, "some magnificent Leichhardt trees." The only creek
that would answer to this description is the one now called JUNCTION CREEK, in
which case the distance travelled is understated by 5 miles, and the camp is on
the site of the modern AMBY CATTLE STATION opposite the EINASLEIGH HOT
SPRINGS.</p>
<p>15th October. Travelled 8 miles NNW., a mile or two from the right bank of
the Einasleigh. CAMP 5 is among the hills called by the Brothers the JORGENSEN
RANGE and the western edge of a swamp which they called CAWANA SWAMP.
Richardson gives the LATITUDE as 18&deg; 2' 7", which may be taken as
correct.</p>
<p>6th October. Travelled NW.: 11 miles (R.), 10 miles (B.): winding through
the JORGENSEN RANGE. CAMP 6, at the point where WARROUL CREEK falls into
PARALLEL CREEK, which here leaves the EINASLEIGH RIVER as an anabranch, to fall
in again 22 miles lower. Warroul Creek has got into the maps as ELIZABETH
CREEK, and was identified by W. Hann in 1872 as the creek on which MOUNT
SURPRISE CATTLE STATION was situated. MOUNT SURPRISE is now a STATION on the
Chillagoe-Etheridge RAILWAY.</p>
<p>17th October. PARALLEL CREEK is separated from the Einasleigh River by a
high ridge of BASALT. Travelled WNW. down Parallel Creek 8 miles (B.),
7&frac12; miles (R.). CAMP 8 was in bed of creek (Byerley calls it Camp 8,
although really Camp 7, and his numbering is followed with the object of
facilitating reference to his narrative).</p>
<p>18th October. WNW., down PARALLEL CREEK, which had now become a gorge.
10&frac12; miles (R.), 10 miles (B.). CAMP 9.</p>
<p>19th October. W. by N. 8 miles. Midway, the lower confluence of PARALLEL
CREEK with the EINASLEIGH was passed. CAMP 10 on an alluvial flat on right bank
of river. The LATITUDE given by Richardson (17&deg; 45' 40" S.) is about right.
(SEE MAP L.)</p>
<p>20th October. WNW., 11 miles down the EINASLEIGH. At 6 miles crossed the
mouth of GALAA CREEK (now on the map as MARTIN CREEK) and got out of the stony
country. From 7 to 11 miles, low sandstone ridges. FLOOD-MARKS 30 feet above
river. CAMP 11.</p>
<p>21st October. WNW., 11 miles down the river. Good travelling. DESERT
SANDSTONE tablelands to north and (according to modern maps) also to south.
CAMP 12.</p>
<p>22nd October. W., 10 miles down the river. CAMP 13, on a creek which was
named COOROORA CREEK, but does not appear on modern maps, was half a mile north
of the river and about 5 miles east of the point where the ETHERIDGE RIVER
falls into the southern, or left, bank of the Einasleigh. Richardson gave the
LATITUDE as 17&deg; 34' 32", which must be nearly correct, and estimated, after
plotting his <i>route</i>, that the CAMP was 18 or 20 miles SSW. of
LEICHHARDT'S LYND RIVER. The actual distance is about</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 294}</u></p>
<p>53 miles, but the inaccuracy of Leichhardt's charting was mainly responsible
for the miscalculation.</p>
<p>Had the Brothers Jardine followed their EINASLEIGH RIVER a few miles further
they would have seen it JOINED BY THE ETHERIDGE. Fifty miles west of the
confluence, the conjoined stream meets the river which Leichhardt named the
GILBERT, and this name is retained till the river waters discharge into the
Gulf nearly a hundred miles west. The Einasleigh has actually a longer course
than the Gilbert, but historical considerations have determined that the
Gilbert be regarded as the main stream and the Einasleigh as a tributary.
ACCIDENT INLET, one of the many MOUTHS OF THE GILBERT (in 17&deg; 13' S. lat.)
was the "furthest south" of the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" and was
consequently named the STATEN REVIER by Carstenszoon in 1623.</p>

<p>THE Brothers, according to their diary, accompanied by Eulah, left Camp 13,
on the EINASLEIGH, on 24th October, 1864, and after majormitchelling <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> to the north, northeast and north-west, returned on the
27th, having failed to find the LYND RIVER. (SEE MAP L.) They had made about 40
miles of northing and had struck the creek which they named BYERLEY CREEK (now
mapped as the RED RIVER) and another which they named MAROON CREEK, and which
appears in modern maps as the head of the STATEN RIVER. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> This STATEN RIVER, <i>de facto</i>, and which will, no
doubt, be so called for all time, is <i>de jure</i>, the NASSAU, one of its
mouths (17&deg; 24' S. lat.) having been named the NASSAU REVIER by Jan
Carstenszoon on 26th April, 1623. BYERLEY CREEK, or Red River, is a tributary
of the STATEN RIVER, <i>de facto</i>.</p>
<p>Had the Brothers struck north-east from their 10th or 11th Camp, on the
Einasleigh, they would have reached LEICHHARDT'S LYND RIVER in less than 30
miles. Beyond Camp 11, the chance was lost, as the courses of the two rivers
diverge, the Einasleigh to the west and the Lynd to north-north-west.</p>
<blockquote>[1) This expressive verb, indicative of a method of exploration
favoured by Major (afterwards Sir Thomas) Mitchell, was in common use among
Australian bushmen in the "seventies," when I first made their
acquaintance.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Carstenszoon spelt the name Staten, which spelling, except in
quotations, I retain. In modern Dutch, the double "a" is correct, but in 1623
spelling was no more fixed in Holland than it was in England.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 296}</u></p>
<p>The Staten River, <i>de facto</i>, north of the Einasleigh, flows mainly
west, while the Lynd runs to north-north-west, and is east of the heads of the
Staten, <i>de facto</i>.</p>
<p>On their way back to Camp 13, the reconnoitring party blazed a track to
guide the party with the cattle to Byerley Creek.</p>
<p>After their return to Camp 13, the Brothers discussed the situation with
Richardson, who contended that the EINASLEIGH RIVER, which they had by this
time traced for 50 miles, could be no other than the LYND. It is unfortunate
that a question of this sort should have been discussed with heat; but so it
was. The Brothers lost confidence in the Surveyor, who, on his part, performed
his duties in a half-hearted and perfunctory manner and, as it were, under
protest, for the remainder of the journey.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the BROTHERS, accompanied by EULAH, set out on a further
<i>reconnaissance</i> to the north. Having crossed BYERLEY CREEK (the RED RIVER
of modern maps), they gave the name of MAROON CREEK to what is now known to be
the head of the STATEN RIVER, <i>de facto</i> (the NASSAU RIVER, <i>de
jure</i>). Further north, they came on a creek running, like their Maroon
Creek, to the north-west, and named it COCKBURN CREEK. (SEE MAP H.) The latter
is a tributary, or head, of the Staten, <i>de facto</i>, as is also Byerley
Creek, which, before it falls into the Staten River, <i>de facto</i>, bears the
names of Red River and Wyaaba Creek in parts of its course.</p>
<p>The reconnoitring party penetrated northward, as far as can be made out, to
about 16&deg; 35' S. lat. (approximate longitude 143&deg; 5' E.), having for
some distance been travelling almost parallel with the long-sought-for LYND.
They TURNED BACK about 15 miles south of the MITCHELL, and on 3rd November
reached the lagoons on BYERLEY CREEK (the Red River, <i>de facto</i>), to which
the body of the expedition had by this time moved, in two stages, making this
their CAMP 15. (SEE MAP L.) The majority of the men who had been with the
cattle were now suffering from OPHTHALMIA. The shade temperature was 90&deg; at
daylight and 103&deg; at noon.</p>
<p>On 4th November, BYERLEY CREEK, now admitted not to be the Lynd, was crossed
within half a mile north of Camp 15. CAMP 16 was about 4&frac12; miles further
north, on what was named BELLE CREEK.</p>
<p>On 5th November, the BROTHERS, accompanied by BINNEY, EULAH and BARNEY, went
ahead with the cattle and having marked a line of trees for 15 miles to the
north, camped for the night, with the cattle, at MAROON CREEK (head of the
STATEN RIVER, <i>de facto</i>), in which there was no water. Some of the horses
had been missing when the cattle left Camp 16. These having at length been
collected, RICHARDSON, SCRUTTON AND COWDEROY</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 297}</u></p>
<p>brought them along, but were too late in the day to overtake the cattle.
(SEE MAP H.) While they were unpacking and preparing camp (a dry camp, No. 17,
some distance south of the Staten, <i>de facto</i>), the GRASS TOOK FIRE, with
the result that 420 lb. of flour, almost all the tea, 100 lb. of rice, jam,
apples and currants, a box of cartridges and caps, 2 tents, 1 pack-saddle, 22
pack-bags, 14 surcingles, 12 leather girths, 30 ring pack-straps, 2 bridles, 2
pairs of blankets, clothing and needles, awls, twine, etc., were destroyed. The
most heroic exertions were required to save the rest of the stores. Scrutton is
said to have snatched some of the powder canisters from the fire with the
solder melting on the outside.</p>
<p>While waiting at MAROON CREEK (STATEN RIVER, <i>de facto</i>) for the party
to whom this misfortune occurred, the BROTHERS and their three companions had
an anxious and trying time. At their camp, only a trifling amount of water had
been obtained by digging, not enough even for their own horses. They could not
go back to look for the men left behind, whose delay they could not understand.
They had to go forward and find water for the cattle.</p>
<p>On the 6th, the BROTHERS marked a line, while their companions drove the
cattle to COCKBURN CREEK, where they camped (CAMP 18); and still the men did
not arrive with the horses and packs. They remained the two following days at
Camp 18, still awaiting the two parties left behind, and came near starvation.
They succeeded, however, in killing three small "opossums" on the 7th and in
shooting a calf on the 8th. On the latter day, twenty or thirty of the cattle
were found to be missing, and "Maroon," a stallion designed for stud purposes,
died of POISON or SNAKE-BITE. On the 9th, ALICK went back and met the rear
party.</p>
<p>On 10th and 11th November, the BROTHERS and EULAH followed COCKBURN CREEK
down for 38 miles <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> to the north-west,
instructions having been left for the rest of the party to follow with the
cattle and pack-horses. On the 12th, about 9 miles further on the same course,
they found two sandy water-courses, which they supposed to be the heads of the
Mitchell, but which must have been branches of the STATEN RIVER ( <i>de
facto</i>). Then, striking out to north by west, they crossed 16 miles of
barren inundable country to MARAMIE CREEK, so named, in the aboriginal
language, because of the abundance of fresh-water crabs.</p>
<p>On the 13th, the Brothers followed MARAMIE CREEK down for 25 miles to WSW.
Nothing but a waste of tea tree and spinifex was to be seen, and it was evident
that this was no country for travelling cattle.</p>
<p>On 14th November, the Brothers struck south and came on "what they supposed
to be the Mitchell, which was afterwards ascertained to be the Staten of the
Dutch navigators, or one of its</p>
<blockquote>[1) Modern mapping shows that the distances must have been
over-estimated.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 298}</u></p>
<p>heads" (<i>Byerley</i>, p. 19). As already mentioned, the river is the
"STATEN," <i>de facto</i> and not <i>de jure</i>.</p>
<p>Here the NATIVES for the first time evinced a threatening disposition.
Running the river up from the point where they had struck it (8 miles below the
junction of Cockburn Creek), the little party of explorers was followed for 3
miles by a noisy crowd of armed blacks. "Getting tired of this noisy pursuit,
which might at any moment end in a shower of spears, the Brothers turned on
reaching a patch of open ground, determined that some of their pursuers should
not pass it. This movement caused them to pause, and seeming to think better of
their original intention, they ceased to annoy or follow the little party,
which pursued its way for 5 miles further, when they camped in the bed of the
stream."</p>
<p>The character of the country to which the Jardines had now penetrated had
entirely changed. The littoral of the southern end and eastern side of the Gulf
of Carpentaria is a network of salt-water inlets, which if nothing were known
of their hinterland, might be supposed to be the delta of a single gigantic
river. The inlets, however, prove to be the ANASTOMOSING MOUTHS of a great
number of rivers which take their rise in the high ground to the south and
east. Any one of the rivers may be followed down with confidence till it enters
the deltal plain, whereupon it splits up into anabranches, which sooner or
later coalesce with similar anabranches of other rivers. On the other hand, a
traveller who attempted to follow any inlet of the sea up to its head, would
find himself, within the deltal area, in a maze of anabranches. With no
fingerpost to guide him, he might, for example, turn to the right and find
himself on the Norman, or to the left and find himself on the Gilbert.
Moreover, any two travellers crossing the NETWORK OF DELTAL ANABRANCHES, say
from south to north, on parallel courses a few miles apart, would form quite
different ideas as to what were "main streams" and what were mere
"tributaries." An anabranch might in one place contain a long deep water-hole,
and a few miles distant be only a barely distinguishable hollow. It may be
stated that the mouths of the Nicholson, Gregory, Albert, Leichhardt, Flinders,
Norman, Gilbert, Staten, <i>de facto</i>, Dunbar, Mitchell, Coleman, Holroyd
and Archer Rivers anastomose.</p>
<p>For this reason, the rivers named by the Jardine Brothers, who kept as much
as possible on the upper edge of the delta out of consideration for their
cattle, are difficult of identification, even with the aid of modern maps.</p>
<p>On 15th November, the BROTHERS and EULAH moved up and found the MAIN CAMP
(Camp 18) settled on COCKBURN CREEK about 25 miles above its confluence with
the Staten, <i>de facto</i>. Richardson gives the latitude of the camp as
16&deg; 46' 5" S.</p>
<p>On the 16th, the now UNITED EXPEDITION followed COCKBURN</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 299}</u></p>
<p>CREEK down (NW. by W.) for about 11 miles and camped (CAMP 23). <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>On the 17th, a further move of 5 miles was made to where COCKBURN CREEK
falls into the STATEN RIVER (<i>de facto</i>), which the Brothers took for the
Staten and Richardson for the Lynd. CAMP 24 was 6 miles down the river below
the junction. At this camp SCRUTTON "was bitten in two or three places by a
SCORPION, without, however, any very severe effects." The camp of the 18th, No.
25, was about 8 miles further down the river. The next camp, No. 26, was made
on the 19th, 11 miles further down.</p>
<p>On the 20th, 9 miles further west, <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> the
party having been compelled to camp early in the afternoon owing to a deluge of
rain (CAMP 27), was ATTACKED by about a score of NATIVES and there were some
narrow escapes, one spear passing between Cowderoy's legs. Two shots in reply,
although they missed their aim, dispersed the assailants.</p>
<p>21st November, 1864. The camp was shifted 3 miles to the west, to a spot
where there was some grass and plenty of water (CAMP 28). Thirteen of the
horses were missing in the morning and were not found till the 27th. The BLACKS
had been among them and had scattered them all over the country, and they were
"wild as hawks "and had broken their hobbles.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, as FRANK JARDINE was riding out alone looking for good
travelling for the cattle, he was ATTACKED by NATIVES, who threw half a dozen
spears at him. When he had shot three of the natives, the remainder (about
nine) fled, leaving their weapons behind. The black boy Sambo was assailed by
three natives who, after a boastful harangue, threw spears. The pinch of
starvation now began to threaten and stern restrictions were imposed: on the
consumption of rations. Kites hovered around the camp in myriads and grew so
bold as to snatch the meat cooking on the fire.</p>
<p>Camp 28, where the party was compelled to stay for seven days, was a very
undesirable residence. Mosquitoes, sandflies and gadflies tormented the
explorers, who had worries enough on their minds. The final misfortune was the
loss, on the night of the 26th November, of fifteen cattle owing to the
carelessness of the man in charge, who slept on his watch. Only seven of the
cattle were recovered.</p>
<p>Finally, when a start was made on the 27th, one of the horses was missing
and had to be left behind. FRANK JARDINE rode on, on the north side of the
river, ahead of the party, looking for good travelling and a suitable camp.
Nine miles down the river he</p>

into two or three parties which camped at different places.</blockquote>

windings of the river and difficulties.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 300}</u></p>
<p>passed a number of NATIVES, who seemed indifferent to his presence, but 2
miles further on he met seven more and a spear flew past, within six inches of
his face. He shot one of his assailants. Shortly afterwards, he crossed to the
other side of the river and met the other members of the party, who had also
been attacked by the natives in force. They had killed or wounded several of
their assailants. The distance travelled down the river (westward) was
estimated by Richardson at 8 miles. CAMP 29 (infall of Emu Creek from the
south).</p>
<p>CAMP 30 (28th November) was 9 miles further down the river. The poverty of
the country travelled and its obvious liability to be inundated gave rise to
much misgiving, as the wet season was now drawing nigh.</p>
<p>On 29th and 30th November, CAMPS 31 AND 32 marked stages of 9 and 11 miles
respectively down the river. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Camp 32 was
within a quarter of a mile of the left bank of MARAMIE CREEK, near its junction
with the STATEN RIVER (<i>de facto</i>).</p>
<p>CAMP 33, 10 miles down the river, was made on 1st December. This day two
parties of BLACKS were seen FISHING in the river with four-pronged spears and
also lines and hooks, the latter made of wood barbed with bone.</p>
<p>On 2nd and 3rd December, the expedition moved on to CAMPS 34 AND 35, over
stages of 10 and 6 miles respectively. At the last-named camp, the river had
become a SALT-WATER ESTUARY, and the hope that it would turn to the north and
lead them in the desired direction was finally abandoned by the Brothers. On
the 4th, the camp was moved 2 miles WNW. to good feed close to the mangroves.
CAMP 36 (LEICHHARDT'S CAMP of 5th July, 1845).</p>
<p>The long-drawn dispute between the Brothers Jardine and Richardson over the
identification of the river which they had followed to the west since Cockburn
Creek fell into it, was now brought to an end. It was admitted by Richardson
that its course lay altogether west of the Lynd and that Leichhardt's Mitchell
River was still to the north. It was, in fact, a new and distinct river. The
Brothers proposed to name it the "Ferguson" after Sir George Ferguson Bowen,
first Governor of Queensland (there was already a "Bowen" river), although they
erroneously believed it to be identical with the Staten River of the Dutch
navigators. For the last mistake the Jardines were not responsible, as the
Admiralty charts of their day placed the Staten where the mouth of the
"Ferguson" really is, as do the charts still in use. The name "Ferguson" never
was adopted, and officially in the maps of the Lands Department, the river is
still known as the Staaten. It falls into the Gulf where the NASSAU REVIER was
placed by the Dutch</p>

with the total distance between the mouths of Cockburn and Maramie
Creeks.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 301}</u></p>
<p>in 1623. THE DUTCH STATEN REVIER is ACCIDENT INLET, one of the mouths of the
GILBERT. Modern Lands Department maps, following Flinders' chart, confirmed by
King, erroneously place the Dutch Nassau Revier in 15&deg; 55' S. latitude, the
inlet in that position (on which is the "Nassau Landing" for Lochnagar and
Dunbar cattle stations) being DUNBAR CREEK, one of the many mouths of the
MITCHELL RIVER.</p>

<p>THE meagre diet of the camps at the mouth of the Staten River, <i>de
facto</i>, was varied by the addition of shark's flesh, which was jerked
(sun-dried), together with the flesh of a bullock which was killed.</p>
<p>The position of the party was now very serious. The HORSES were leg-weary
and emaciated, and both they and the CATTLE were falling off owing to the
insufficiency of food and were rapidly diminishing in numbers. Trying to
progress to the north the party had been forced to march further and further to
the west till they reached the mangrove swamps of the Gulf littoral. In the
flat country where they now found themselves, ominous FLOOD MARKS</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 303}</u></p>
<p>on the trees proclaimed that at any moment the water might rise above the
heads of the travellers. (SEE MAP H.) At least one large river, the MITCHELL,
was known to cross their path to the north. And the WET SEASON might set in
to-morrow, if reliance could be placed upon what was then known of
meteorological conditions in Northern Queensland. The supply of farinaceous
FOOD was already limited and had been seriously diminished by fire. Finally,
the hostility and treachery of the ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS had to be taken into
consideration. The Brothers must have marvelled day by day, as every explorer
of these regions has done, why the blacks did not compass their death by the
simple expedient of killing their horses when the latter strayed from the camps
in search of grass. Thanks only to the limited intelligence of the natives,
this method of warfare does not appear to have suggested itself.</p>
<p>It is probable enough that the Brothers themselves, their black boys and
some of the white men, might, if the blacks had let them alone, with their
skill in bushmanship, have contrived to subsist for a time on the natural
products of the country even if they had lost all the cattle and horses, as
well as their rations. But the savages would certainly have waited for the time
when relaxed watchfulness, hunger and fatigue would make them an easy prey, as
in the case of Kennedy.</p>
<p>Everything pointed emphatically to the necessity for an immediate CHANGE OF
COURSE to the north, with a leaning to the east, to escape from a country
subject to periodical, and now imminent, INUNDATION.</p>
<p>With much rejoicing, the whole expedition turned their backs on their Camp
36, on the STATEN RIVER, <i>de facto</i>, on 5th December, 1864, and after
crossing sand flats and sandy ridges covered with tea tree, camped in a dry
swamp (CAMP 37), say 10 miles <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> from Camp 36.
This camp must have been very near LEICHHARDT'S CAMP of 4th July, 1845, in
16&deg; 15' 11" S. lat. A little slimy green water was, however, found about
2&frac12; miles to north-north-west.</p>
<p>Next morning (6th December), half the HORSES were MISSING, and the camp was
shifted to the green water (CAMP 38). After having been packed for this short
journey, a very useful MULE slipped away and got lost, carrying with him a load
of "indispensable" articles. He only got ten minutes' start, but he travelled
faster than a black boy could track his footprints.</p>
<p>The Brothers found nine of the horses at Camp 35 and camped there for the
night, without food or blankets, and with myriads of mosquitoes for company.
They returned to Camp 38 next day (7th December), to learn that five of the
horses and the MULE were still MISSING, Sambo and Binney having searched for
them in vain.</p>
<blockquote>[1) F. Jardine says 13; Richardson 12. Both continually
over-estimate distances made, though perhaps not distances covered. At Camps
35, 36 and 37, the Jardines must have been on or near Leichhardt's track of 6th
and 7th July, 1845.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 304}</u></p>
<p>Sambo had been two days without food or water, and was DELIRIOUS, but when
sufficiently recovered to speak, he stated that he had followed the mule's
tracks to the back of Camp 35, when he was obliged to return.</p>
<p>On 8th December, ALICK JARDINE and SAMBO set out in the direction of Camp
35. They found four of the five lost horses, one of them, named "Lucifer," at
Camp 35, quite mad (it was supposed from drinking salt water.)</p>
<p>On resuming the search next morning (9th December), Alick and Sambo met
Eulah and Barney, who had also seen the MAD HORSE. Sambo and Barney were sent
after the mule, and Alick and Eulah came in sight of "Lucifer," but only
succeeded in knocking up their mounts in pursuit of him. They then returned to
Camp 38, with the recovered horses.</p>
<p>In the meantime (8th December), FRANK JARDINE had been out 18 miles to the
north of Camp 38, hoping to find water on the desired <i>route</i>, but without
success, and the prospect of driving the cattle over dry country was
disheartening. On 10th December, Frank Jardine and Eulah rode westward from
Camp 38 for 6 miles, when they found themselves on extensive marine plains and
downs. After 19 miles more, mainly south (and probably over the site of the
modern cattle-station named MENTANA) they came on "Lucifer's" track and found
the place where he had been drinking salt water and lying down. They followed
the tracks for fifteen miles and camped without water.</p>
<p>From daylight on the following day (11th December), Frank and Eulah followed
the tracks, mostly on foot, leading their horses, and were thus led, at
sundown, to Camp 33, on the STATEN, <i>de facto</i>. Here, for the first time
since they left Camp 38, they found water. It was brackish, but it satisfied a
two days' thirst. While they were trying to catch something to eat, the elusive
"Lucifer" was seen, but he galloped away at once. Frank mounted his horse and,
heading the mad animal, drove him back to Eulah's horse, "but to no purpose,
for he galloped past without taking the least notice of him, and as it was now
dark they had to let him go." "Lucifer" was again tracked next day (12th) and
was found at noon 13 miles off. He was white with perspiration, and it was
surmised that he had galloped the whole distance. He was, besides, still quite
mad, and Frank made up his mind to leave him behind. The remaining HORSE,
"Deceiver," was found shortly afterwards&mdash;DEAD, whereupon the tired and
hungry men made their way back to CAMP 38.</p>
<p>"LUCIFER" and "DECEIVER," says Byerley, were the two best riding horses, and
the MULE the best pack-animal. His own loss was aggravated by his carrying his
pack with him. This carried most of the odd ARTICLES that were hitherto DEEMED
INDISPENSABLE, but which henceforth they had perforce to dispense with. One
pack contained all that remained of the tea, currants and raisins</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 305}</u></p>
<p>saved from the fire and two pairs of boots&mdash;the only ones the Brothers
had; and the other was filled with oddments, such as files, gimlets, ragstone,
steel, weighing maching, awls, tomahawks, American axes, shoeing tools and a
number of things that they could not do without; but perhaps the most important
loss was that of the spade, to which they had many times been indebted for
water. The losses also included the mallet and chisel with which the successive
numbers of the camps had hitherto been cut on trees.</p>
<p>ALICK had spent a day (11th December) in searching for WATER, and was
rewarded by finding it in a creek 8 miles north-north-west of Camp 38. One
day's march in the right direction was thus secured.</p>
<p>During the detention at Camp 38, Richardson determined the variation of the
compass to be 4 degrees east (misprinted "40 degrees" in Byerley). Previously
he had been allowing 6 degrees.</p>
<p>To the other considerations which so urgently dictated a forward movement,
was now added the ILLNESS of SCRUTTON and COWDEROY, brought on by drinking the
impure water of Camp 38.</p>
<p>The party fared forth on 13th December, and in 8 miles reached the place
where water was known. Alick, however, riding ahead of the main body, had come
on water four miles further on, in what was probably LEICHHARDT'S "ROCKY
CREEK," and the cattle were brought on. A disappointment ensued when the water
turned out, although covered with <i>nymphea</i>, to be salt. Good water was
luckily found a mile up the creek to the east (CAMP 39). At this camp a fine
barramundi was caught and six whistling ducks were shot.</p>
<p>With the intention of striking the Mitchell about the head of the tide, the
course was altered next day (14th December) to north-east. Water was passed at
5 miles and 9 miles from Camp 39, and CAMP 40 was pitched on a well-watered
creek at 14 miles (DUNBAR CREEK). Richardson gives the latitude of the camp as
15&deg; 56' 31" S.</p>
<p>The position assigned to Camp 40 is on what is called the "NASSAU RIVER" in
the 4-mile map (1910) and in the "Tenure Map" (December, 1911). As has already
been pointed out, the RIVER SO CALLED BY CARSTENSZOON, in 1623, is that WHICH
THE JARDINE BROTHERS FOLLOWED DOWN FROM CAMP 24 TO CAMP 36. Modern maps show
that the water-course (15&deg; 53' S. lat.), erroneously named the Nassau River
(the NASSAU, DE FACTO), is ONE OF THE MOUTHS OF THE MITCHELL RIVER, which
leaves the main stream at BURKE'S LAGOON, near Dunbar cattle station, and is
there known as DUNBAR CREEK. CAMP 40 may, therefore, be placed with confidence
on DUNBAR CREEK. Between their 38th and 39th camps, the Brothers must have
crossed the (apparently insignificant) water-course which, some 10 miles to the
west, becomes the Revier Nassau (16&deg; 10' S. lat.) and which Carstenszoon,
of the" <i>Pera</i>" named on 29th April,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 306}</u></p>
<p>1623. It is now too late to give effect to the claim of this STATEN RIVER,
<i>DE JURE</i>, for recognition.</p>
<p>On 15th December, a stage of 22 miles was made to the north-east, over
better country than had been met with for some time, part of it being SANDSTONE
RIDGES rising above the level of the inundable land. Four or five miles from
Camp 40, a creek was passed falling to the west, which the Brothers proposed to
call Arbour Creek, but which does not appear on Richardson's map, or on
Byerley's. At 19 miles a halt was made at a dry swamp, which now appears on the
maps as the "SCRUTTON RIVER," running out of the main stream of the Mitchell
below Dunbar Creek and joining DUNBAR CREEK (the Nassau River, <i>de
facto</i>), midway between Camp 40 and the Gulf. Eulah, having been sent ahead,
found a good site for a camp 3 miles further, and the caravan pushed on to it
(CAMP 41). "It was," says Byerley, "well worth the extra fatigue to the stock.
They were rewarded by an excellent camp, plenty of green GRASS, open country,
and WATER, which was alike acceptable to men and beasts. The creek received the
name of EULAH CREEK, in honour of the discoverer." It was not, however, so
named in Richardson's map or Byerley's, and is called "MAGNIFICENT CREEK" in
modern maps.</p>
<p>Probably the Jardine Brothers passed through this country in an unusually
bad season, and it was lucky for them. Had they not been ready to perish from
THIRST in crossing the inundable country they would have run a serious risk of
DROWNING.</p>
<p>Yet it is evident from the subsequent course of occupation that the country
traversed by the interlacing and anastomosing MOUTHS OF THE MITCHELL RIVER is
not worthless, as it seemed to its first explorers. In good seasons at least,
the coastal plains afford abundant FOOD FOR STOCK, and the Brothers' experience
of 15th December indicates the existence of ELEVATED SANDSTONE PLATEAUX to
which stock may retreat in times of flood. Moreover, there is almost a
certainty that the ARTESIAN WATER area of Normanton is prolonged in that
direction, although the coastal alluvium makes it impossible to see the outcrop
of the basal beds of the Lower Cretaceous strata. The area in question,
according to modern maps, now contains cattle stations at OLD and NEW MENTANA,
DUNBAR, KALKA, LOCHNAGAR, RUTLAND PLAINS and KOOLATA, as well as the MISSION
STATION of TREBANAMAN. (SEE MAP F.)</p>
<p>From Camp 41 to Camp 42, the company travelled about 6 miles north-eastward
on 16th December. The two Brothers, riding ahead, had barely gone a mile when
they were confronted by a party of NATIVES, who jeered and brandished spears. A
stand was made and eight or nine fell to the rifle fire, whereupon the
remainder retired. CAMP 42 was on an anabranch of the MITCHELL RIVER, running
NNW., "its bed in some parts densely timbered, the foliage rich and luxuriant:
in others there are fine sheets of</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 307}</u></p>
<p>excellent water. Leichhardt's melaleuca, fan-leaved palm and fig trees, some
of the latter bearing ripe fruit, also vines and tropical trees unknown to me"
(Richardson, p. 33).</p>
<p>On 17th December, about 7 miles were travelled to northwest, among the
channels of the MITCHELL. One of these, about midway, was taken to be the "MAIN
STREAM." It is described thus by Richardson: "Bed 500 yards wide, sandy, and
two channels, some water, not running, banks low, and flood marks above them;
the foliage of the trees on both sides is very dense and rich in various shades
of green. The latter part of our journey bore some resemblance to a deserted
garden, which had contained many choice plants and trees, acacia, bauhinia,
Leichhardt, and fan-leaved palm, the latter numerous, also cedar." Game was
plentiful, including wallabies, native companions, duck, and Torres Strait
pigeons. CAMP 43 was on a flooded gum flat. Here one of the cows died from the
effects of some POISONOUS PLANT.</p>
<p>The story of the 18th December is given in Byerley's words (p. 35), which
cannot be abridged or paraphrased:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"18th December. The river was followed down to-day
for 9 miles through a complete network of anabranches, gullies, and vine scrubs
to another branch, which may be called the true stream. It was 30 yards wide,
deep, and running strongly. Here the party had to camp for about 3 hours,
whilst the Brothers searched for a good crossing. The cattle and pack-horses
were crossed in safety, but some of the pack-bags got wetted in the passage.
They were travelled another mile over to a sandstone bar, crossing another deep
sheet of water that had been previously found. This stream had been explored in
search of a ford for 4 miles further up but without success. It continued of
the same width and appeared to do so much further. This day, Sunday, was marked
by the severest conflict the travellers had yet had with the natives, one which
may well be dignified by the name of the 'BATTLE OF THE MITCHELL.' On arriving
at the running stream before mentioned, whilst the cattle halted, the Brothers
and Eulah, taking axes with them to clear the scrub, went down to find a safe
crossing. At about a mile and a half they came on to a number of blacks
fishing: these immediately crossed to the other side, but on their return, swam
across again in numbers, armed with large bundles of spears and some nullahs,
and met them. The horsemen, seeing they were in for another row, now cantered
forward towards the camp, determined this time to give their assailants a
severe lesson. This was interpreted into a flight by the savages, who set up a
yell, and redoubled their pursuit, sending in the spears thick and fast. These
now coming much too close to be pleasant (for some of them were thrown a
hundred yards), the three turned suddenly on their pursuers, and galloping up
to them, poured in a volley, the report of which brought down their companions
from the camp, when the skirmish became general. The natives at first stood up
courageously, but either by accident or through fear, despair or stupidity,
they got huddled in a heap, in, and at the margin of the water, when ten
carbines poured volley after volley into them from all directions, killing and
wounding with every shot with very little return, nearly all their spears
having been expended in the pursuit of the horsemen. About thirty being killed,
the leader thought it prudent to hold his hand, and let the rest escape. Many
more must have been wounded and probably drowned, for fifty-nine rounds were
counted as discharged. On the return of the party to the cattle an incident
occurred which nearly cost one of them his life. One of the routed natives,
probably burning with revengeful and impotent hate, got into the water under
the river bank, and waited for the returning party,
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 308}</u></p>
<p>and as they passed threw a spear at Scrutton, before anyone was aware of his
proximity. The audacious savage had much better have left it alone, for he paid
for his temerity with his life. Although the travellers came off providentially
without hurt, there were many narrow escapes, for which some of them might
thank their good fortune. At the commencement of the fight, as Alexander
Jardine was levelling his carbine, a spear struck the ground between his feet,
causing him to drop his muzzle, and lodge the bullet in the ground a few yards
in front of him. His next shot told more successfully. There were other equally
close shaves, but providentially not a scratch. This is one of the few
instances in which the savages of Queensland have been known to stand up in
fight with white men, and on this occasion they showed no sign of surprise or
fear at the report and effect of fire-arms, but it is probable that they will
long remember the 'Battle of the Mitchell' (Camp XLIV). Course NNW. Distance 7
miles."</p>

<p>The camp was probably on the ALICE RIVER, about 3 miles west of the modern
KOOLATAH STATION.</p>
<p>The TACTICS OF THE ABORIGINES consist mainly of AMBUSCADES AND HARASSMENT OF
THE REAR of travelling parties. It is rarely, as Byerley observes, that they
venture to stand up in bodies to fight.</p>
<p>The MITCHELL RIVER was followed down to the north-west on 19th, 20th and
21st December, CAMPS 45, 46 AND 47, representing stages of 13, 11 and 9&frac12;
miles. The head of the SALT WATER was found between Camps 45 and 46. Heavy RAIN
fell on 20th and 21st.</p>
<p>At sunset on the 21st it was discovered that the BLACKS were "STALKING" the
party at the camp, under cover of screens of boughs. The Brothers, Scrutton and
the four black boys mounted and PURSUED THE NATIVES for a couple of miles,
driving them at last into the scrub, but using no fire-arms. At the conclusion
of the chase, two dozen abandoned spears were collected along the line of
retreat.</p>
<p>The MITCHELL RIVER <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> was finally LEFT BEHIND
on 22nd December and the camp was pitched 15 miles to the north (lat. 15&deg;
2' 10" S.) "at a puddle without a blade of grass" (CAMP 48). <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<p>In the locality attributed to Camp 48, the modern map (Sheet 20B) sketches a
water-course about to fall into the Gulf, and obviously suggests that this
water-course is the Coleman River. Mr. Embley informs me that he is not
responsible for the sketch or the suggestion, and that he only traced the
Coleman down (westward) to a point 30 miles east of the coast. He believes, in
fact, that flood waters of the Coleman flow southward into the Mitchell by
courses indistinguishable in normal dry weather.</p>
<p>The following day (23rd December) there was HEAVY RAIN. "Twelve miles of
wretched country were traversed, white sandy undulating ground, clothed with
shrubs and underwood in the</p>

Embley, in April, 1887.]</blockquote>

<p>place of grass, and the CAMP pitched on a low stringybark ridge, WITHOUT
WATER, for in this flat sandy country the ground absorbs the rain as soon as it
falls. The horses had to be watched again to-night, for there was not a blade
of grass to be got. A small quantity of water was found in a creek about a mile
and a half ahead. Late in the evening the horses and water-bags were taken to
it, and sufficient water brought back for the use of the camp" (CAMP 49).</p>
<p>On 24th December the journey was continued 7 miles to the north and Camp 50
was pitched on a ridge timbered with bloodwood and stringybark. The grass was
poor, but it was better than none (CAMP 50). This camp cannot have been far
south of the EDWARD RIVER surveyed by Mr. J. T. Embley in 1885. That river runs
westward between the COLEMAN and HOLROYD RIVERS and very likely is to be
connected with one or other or both.</p>
<p>25th December. The RAIN which had set in the night before, continued to fall
heavily during the whole of Christmas Day. In spite of this, 15 miles were
gained to the north. At 7 miles, was a creek in which some swamp mahogany trees
(balourgah) were growing. The creek at 15 miles was named "CHRISTMAS CREEK." It
ran in a rocky bottom and was well watered, and blue grass was plentiful on its
banks (CAMP 51). In the course of his traverse in 1885, Mr. Embley sketched
Balourgah and Christmas Creeks as joining&mdash;or rather parting&mdash;a few
miles above (east of) the Brothers' line of march and as being probably mouths
of the Edward River to the south, while Christmas Creek is joined just above
the Brothers' crossing by a water-course which emanates from the Holroyd River
to the north. Thus mouths of the Edward and Coleman Rivers appear to be
confluent.</p>
<p>26th December. The rain still continued but was not heavy enough to prevent
travelling, and a further stage was made to the north and the night's camp was
made on HERSEY CREEK, "a splendid sheet of water in a rocky creek, 80 yards
wide and very long" (CAMP 52). According to the Brothers, the distance
travelled this day was 13 miles and according to Richardson 12 miles, whereas
their maps agree in showing the distance between Christmas and Hersey Creeks to
be not more than 5 miles. Perhaps the name Hersey Creek should be applied to
another mouth of the Holroyd River, 9 miles north of that to which the name is
attached on modern maps. The matter could probably be settled satisfactorily by
some one on the spot who might be able to identify the long water-hole among
the rocks. It is not in any case a matter of great importance, and the <i>de
facto</i> may be accepted as the <i>de jure</i>.</p>
<p>On 27th December, the party made a northing of 10 miles to a small creek
with water for the men and horses but not enough</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 310}</u></p>
<p>for the cattle (CAMP 53). This may have been the other mouth of the HOLROYD
RIVER above referred to.</p>
<p>28th December. The cattle satisfied their thirst 5 miles north of Camp 53,
at a fine sheet of water in the river which the Brothers named HOLROYD CREEK.
The river is described as having a sandstone bed with several channels. Two
miles further north was another similar stream which was named DUNSMUIR CREEK.
Both streams are channels of the HOLROYD RIVER which was surveyed in September,
1885, by Mr. Embley. The upper reaches of this river were named the Lukin River
in 1875 by Mulligan. The river rises far to the east in the Hamilton
Goldfield.</p>
<p>Four miles north of the Holroyd River (inundable box flats), THALIA CREEK, a
salt-water inlet, was met with. On following the creek up to the east for a
mile and a half, CAMP 54 was pitched on a lotus lagoon, where the water was
only slightly brackish.</p>
<p>The party had hardly settled down in Camp 54 and were digging trenches and
making such other preparations as they could for an impending thunderstorm,
when the BLACK BOY who had been tailing the cattle, came in with the report
that he had been PURSUED BY NATIVES, who were now engaged in "RUNNING" THE
HORSES. The Brothers and Scrutton rushed out and found the horses flying about
in all directions, while a party of natives waited for the men. "When the
distance had been reduced to 60 yards, SPEARS began to fly and were answered by
Terry BREECH-LOADERS. The blacks (some of whom were observed to be unusually
tall) ultimately retired, having paid for their gratuitous attack by the loss
of some of their companions" (Byerley, p. 40). "The THUNDERSTORM now broke with
great violence, and the frightened CATTLE STAMPEDED from the camp. The rain
continued to fall heavily until midnight."</p>
<p>There is a very unsatisfactory discrepancy between the narratives of Frank
Jardine and Richardson concerning the proceedings of 29th, 30th and 31st
December. I am inclined to follow Richardson, as his sole business was to chart
the progress of the main caravan, while the Brothers Jardine went
"majormitchelling" in search of country which would be safe in a time of
floods, and perhaps their notes were not very intelligible to their editor,
Byerley.</p>
<p>From THALIA CREEK (Camp 54) it appears that Richardson and the cattle on
29th December travelled ENE. for about 4 miles, when a TIDAL RIVER, 40 yards
wide, was met with. (SEE MAP D.) Frank Jardine, on a NNE. course, had struck it
further west, where he estimated the width of the stream at 100 yards. The
river was followed up by Richardson, the pack-horses and the cattle for
1&frac12; miles before it could be forded. In the next 51 miles, on the ENE.
course, the inundable tea-tree flats began to be varied by low ridges covered
with bloodwood. CAMP 55 was pitched beside a tea-tree swamp. Heavy rain fell at
night.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 311}</u></p>
<p>THALIA CREEK and the "TIDAL RIVER," I take it, must be mouths, perhaps the
most important mouths, of the KENDALL RIVER, <i>de facto</i>, which was run
down by Mr. Embley in February, 1886, as far west as the 142nd meridian of east
longitude. This Kendall River, <i>de facto</i>, according to Mr. Embley, is the
most considerable water-course in the district, but I am of opinion that he was
mistaken in identifying it with the water-course to which Jardine gave the name
of KENDALL CREEK.</p>
<p>Ten head of CATTLE had been MISSING when Frank Jardine left Camp 54, and as
they had not been recovered, he determined on his return to Camp 55, to wait
there while they were searched for. The search proved fruitless, and "as it
would have been madness to have remained longer in such dangerous country," the
cattle were finally left behind. "The country," says Byerley, "was all alike,
and they were satisfied beyond doubt that it must be ONE SEA DURING THE RAINS."
On the night of the 30th, the camp was visited by a rain-and-wind STORM of
unusual severity.</p>
<p>On 31st December, the distance travelled from Camp 55 was estimated at 12
miles on a general course of ENE.&frac12;E. Two miles from Camp 55, a CREEK was
met with, 50 yards wide, with steep banks and water 3 feet deep. (QUEENSLAND
4-MILE MAP, SHEET 20D.) It was named KENDALL CREEK, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> after a friend of Richardson's, although Frank Jardine
seems to have considered it identical with a creek further to the west which he
had seen the day before, and which he named the MACLEOD.</p>
<p>Richardson's Kendall Creek was followed up for 3 miles to the east before it
could be forded, and the journey could be continued on the desired course of
NNE.&frac12;E.</p>
<p>As plotted from Richardson's narrative, his Kendall Creek practically
coincides with what appears on the modern map as "SINCLAIR CREEK, G 52-4." This
SINCLAIR CREEK, <i>de facto</i>, has apparently been named on a mistaken
identification with the creek so named by Jardine (SINCLAIR CREEK, <i>de
jure</i>), which is further north.</p>
<p>The remainder of the journey of 31st December (5 miles NNE.&frac12;E.) was
on bloodwood and stringybark forest country alternating with tea-tree flats.
The latter were now bogs, owing to the rains. CAMP 56 was on the left, or
southern, bank of the KENDALL, <i>de jure</i> (SINCLAIR, <i>de facto</i>).</p>
<p>What must be called the KENDALL RIVER, <i>de facto</i> (see southeast corner
of Sheet 20D and north side of Sheet 20B of Queensland 4-mile Map), has been
surveyed by Mr. Embley, in 1886, as far down as the western boundaries of
"Dunning" and "Lockton" runs (142&deg; E. long.). From this point, the supposed
seaward course</p>
<blockquote>[1) In 1879-80 I believed the "Coen" (South Coen) of the Goldfield
to be the head of what Richardson had named Kendall Creek. In this I was
mistaken, as the South Coen has since been ascertained to be a tributary of the
Archer River.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 312}</u></p>
<p>of the river is indicated in the modern 4-mile map by a dotted line running
about 12 miles towards Cape Keerweer (WNW.). Mr. Embley informs me that this
conjecture is not his. It is more than likely that Jardine's Thalia Creek,
Tidal Inlet, Macleod Creek and Kendall Creek (Kendall Creek, <i>de jure</i> =
Sinclair Creek, <i>de facto</i>) reach the Gulf between the Holroyd River and
CAPE KEERWEER, where the "men of the '<i>Duyfken</i>'" turned back in 1606, and
where the "men of the '<i>Pera</i>'" landed on 5th May, 1623, and were attacked
by the natives.</p>
<p>1st January, 1865. The KENDALL, <i>de jure</i>, i.e., what the Brothers
called Kendall Creek and the modern map names Sinclair Creek, was crossed a
mile above their Camp 56 and a course of NE.&frac12;N. was pursued through
bloodwood and stringybark forest on ridges of red sand resulting from the
decomposition of sandstone. Twelve miles on this course took the party to CAMP
57, on the small and canal-like NEW YEAR CREEK coming from the NE. and running
S. by E. Four miles short of the camp another water-course was named SINCLAIR
CREEK. It looks as if the two creeks were one and the same. A heavy rain set in
during the afternoon and lasted till midnight.</p>
<p>Sheet 20D of the 4-mile map shows an isolated east and west line 5 miles
long, marked "SINCLAIR CREEK, G 52-4," about 7 miles south-west of Camp 56
(which camp the information to be gleaned from the Jardine and Richardson
diaries places approximately in 14&deg; 1' S. and 142&deg; E.). A creek in the
position indicated in the 4-mile map, although it may be called the SINCLAIR,
<i>DE FACTO</i>, would, in my opinion, in all probability be what Jardine, or,
rather, Richardson, named "KENDALL CREEK." What the Jardine Brothers named
"Sinclair Creek" (SINCLAIR CREEK, DE JURE) lies to the north of Camp 56.</p>
<p>On 2nd January, the stage was 15 miles to NNE. over country described by
Frank Jardine as "an extensive plateau, sloping away to the eastward,
terminating abruptly in a perpendicular wall, overlooking the valley on the
head of which the party camped." [Evidently a sandstone tableland.&mdash;R. L.
J.] He adds that the country covered on this and the previous day "would make a
FINE CATTLE RUN, being watered at every 6 or 7 miles by running creeks, besides
a large swamp." CAMP 58, in 13&deg; 46' 46", was pitched near the head of a
small creek running NNE.</p>
<p>3rd January. The creek was followed down to NNE. for 3&frac12; miles till it
fell into a larger creek, running WSW., which was named the "KINLOCH," after
John Kinloch, Mathematical Master of Sydney College. At 7 and 12 miles from
Camp 58, small, deep, running creeks were crossed, the first by an improvised
bridge. Four miles beyond the second of these creeks, CAMP 59 was pitched. Its
latitude is given as 13&deg; 35' 54". The country traversed this day consisted
of sandstone ridges, timbered with</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 313}</u></p>
<p>bloodwood and stringybark, with occasional ironbarks, zamias, pines and
grasstrees; in fact, the usual features of the DESERT SANDSTONE TABLELANDS. The
small creeks had a fringe of banksias with a few "mahogany" trees. The escape
of the party from the inundable coast land must have been a source of profound
satisfaction. There was a heavy storm of rain and thunder at night.</p>
<p>In consequence of the rain, the country traversed on the following day (4th
January) was boggy. The travellers soon got on a river and its anabranches.
CAMP 60 was on one of the anabranches, the total distance covered in the day
being 6 miles. Frank Jardine proposed to call this water-course
"MICKETEEBOOMULGEIAI" ("the place where the lightning struck"). Fortunately the
name has not stuck, to be a terror to future students of the gentle art of
orthography. It is, in fact, the river on which, 90 miles higher up, is the
centre of the GOLDFIELD which its discoverers called the "COEN." It is NOT,
however, the DUTCH COEN, but a tributary of the ARCHER RIVER. The name "Coen"
has been too long in use to be changed, but the Lands Department has begun to
call the river of the goldfield the "SOUTH COEN" to distinguish it from the
Coen proper.</p>
<p>On 5th January, the party travelled, in the rain, 14 miles N. by E.,
crossing at 5 miles a large river 200 yards wide, and dry, in spite of the
rains, which was named the ARCHER RIVER, and two of its anabranches. The valley
of this river is described by Frank Jardine as "of great richness and beauty,
and the BEST COUNTRY FOR CATTLE seen north of Broadsound." "The banks," he
continues, "are fringed by a thick belt of vine scrub, containing very many
Leichhardt trees and other handsome trees and shrubs of great luxuriance and
growth." (Byerley, p. 43).</p>
<p>Of the ARCHER RIVER, Richardson (p. 38) says: "I believe this river to be
the same as that one NAMED at its mouth the COEN BY THE DUTCH." The discoverers
of the goldfield to the south-east named it, as well as the river on which it
occurred, the COEN, following Richardson's suggestion; but their river is in
reality only a tributary of the Archer and neither river is the Coen of the
Dutch. The inlet named "COEN REVIER" by Jan CARSTENSZOON on 8th May, 1623, is
about 17 miles north of the mouth of the Archer.</p>
<p>CAMP 61 was pitched on a small water-hole in a water-course running SSE.</p>
<p>6th January was a toilsome day for the horses, but 16 miles were gained to
the north, through undulating country with open box forest and some ironbark,
bloodwood, acacia, sterculia and pandanus. The ground was "rotten" from the
rains, and yet the WATER-COURSES were TOO SANDY TO RETAIN WATER. A "RANGE" was
sighted 5 or 6 miles to the east&mdash;the escarpment of a fragmentary
sandstone tableland. The day's march was a</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 314}</u></p>
<p>little to the west of the DIVIDE BETWEEN the ARCHER and WATSON RIVERS, and
across the heads of MERKUNGA AND GUMBOL CREEKS, tributaries of the Watson. CAMP
62 was on a little clay water-hole with barely water enough for the men.</p>
<p>On 7th January, the stage was 15 miles, across "numerous small water-courses
similar to those of yesterday." "It was strange," remarks Frank Jardine, "to
see the horses bogging leg-deep during a thunderstorm and in five minutes after
unable to get a drink of water." The course lay across LAGOON CREEK, the
principal head of the WATSON RIVER (about 10 miles west of the modern MERLUNA
DOWNS cattle station, which has recently been "nationalised" by the State
Government), and SAY CREEK, a similar tributary of the Watson, to the heads of
MYALL CREEK, which enters ALBATROSS BAY under the name of the MISSION RIVER.
CAMP 63 was on a small deep creek falling to NNW., but without much water.
Scrub turkeys, wonga wongas and Torres Strait pigeons were seen.</p>
<p>The next day's journey (8th January) added 18 miles of northing between
MYALL and Cox CREEKS, both here running northward, the former to turn to the
west and become the MISSION RIVER <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and the
latter to fall into the BATAVIA RIVER, which runs to the north-west and
discharges into the Gulf. For the first 15 miles there was "good undulating
forest country, timbered chiefly with box and apple-gum and a few ironbarks,
and intersected with numerous canal-like creeks running north-west. The last 3
miles was wretchedly bad, being similar to the tea-tree country of the Staaten"
(<i>de facto</i>). "The whole country between the Archer and Staaten is without
water, save immediately after rain sufficiently heavy to set the creeks
running." CAMP 64 (lat. 12&deg; 38' 2" S.) was on a small shallow tea-tree
water-pan. (SEE MAP B.) The night was marked by heavy rain and high wind. Two
of the horses were knocked up.</p>
<p>On 9th January, a distance of 16 miles was accomplished to the north. A
little more than half-way, a large RIVER was crossed 20 miles west of the
modern MORETON TELEGRAPH STATION. The Brothers believed this to be the DUTCH
COEN, but Richardson identified it correctly as the BATAVIA RIVER.</p>
<p>A digression becomes necessary at this point.</p>
<p>It is distinctly stated in Carstenszoon's Diary of the Voyage of the
"<i>Pera</i>" that "the Coen Revier is in 13&deg; 7' latitude," but a careful
reading of the narrative shows that that was the latitude of the anchorage of
7th May, 1623. A boat party landed next morning, and followed northward the
footprints of men and dogs, which led them to a "revier" notable only for the
fact that esculent herbs a great prize for scurvy-haunted sailors grew on its
banks. They spent some time in walking, in collecting</p>
<blockquote>[1) The Mission River was surveyed by Mr. Embley in
1897.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 315}</u></p>
<p>herbs and finally in a skirmish with the natives when they returned to the
boat; and they were alongside the "<i>Pera</i>" at midday. The "Coen,"
therefore, cannot be many miles north of the boatlanding. Now it so happens
that, in quite recent years, members of the Mapoon Mission to Aborigines have
located a small INLET IN 13&deg; 4' N. LAT. (between Pera Head and the mouth of
the Archer), and I consider it practically demonstrated that this is
CARSTENSZOON'S COEN REVIER. Unfortunately, Flinders, in 1802, made a bad guess,
and suggested that an inlet, now known as the PENNEFATHER RIVER, in 12&deg; 13'
S. lat., was "probably the Coen R. of the old charts," and the suggestion
having been accepted without question, much confusion has arisen. The subject
of the true location of the Coen is discussed in detail in Chapters VII, LXXXV,
and LXXXIX.</p>
<p>The BATAVIA RIVER, as seen by Richardson, is described by him as "running
NW. by W., 120 yards broad, sandy bed, 30 feet deep; water very clear and good,
running about 2 feet deep." Crocodiles were seen in it by the Brothers Jardine.
The head of the river is in 13&deg; 11' S. lat. and 143&deg; 17 E. long.
PLUTOVILLE, the centre of the "BATAVIA GOLD RUSH," is about 13 miles west of
its source. Below this, the river, to the north-west, cuts its way through the
DESERT SANDSTONE formation, and for a considerable distance divides the
sandstone shelves named by me in 1880 the "SIR WILLIAM THOMSON RANGE" and the
"GEIKIE RANGE."</p>
<p>The Jardines' CAMP 65 was on a tea-tree swamp north of the river.</p>
<p>On 10th January, the progress made was only 2&frac12; miles to NNE. The
greater part of the journey was on ridges timbered with bloodwood and
stringybark. The trouble began at a watercourse running north-west, with the
water knee-deep and the gently sloping banks very boggy. The CATTLE SANK IN THE
MUD. Four refused to face it and had to be let go. Thirty or forty stuck fast
and the greater part of the day was spent in hauling them out with ropes. Five
had to be abandoned when only their backs and heads were out of the slough. The
horses came through the ordeal better, but their saddles and loads had to be
carried by the men. At CAMP 66, which was, of course, pitched on the nearest
piece of sound ground, the remainder of the day was spent in drying the arms
and loads and in jerking the beef of one of the bogged bullocks. HEAVY RAIN
fell at night.</p>
<p>A stage of from 2 to 3 miles was the total result of next day's toil (11th
January).</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"After having travelled with the greatest difficulty
for 2 miles over execrable country, so boggy as to be barely possible to
traverse, their progress," says Byerley (p. 45), "was stopped by a creek 25
yards wide, flooded 'bank and bank' and running like a mill sluice. This was
the River Batavia [a mistake: it was a tributary of NIMROD CREEK, which falls
into the right bank of the Batavia.&mdash;R. L. J.]. The usual</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 316}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">formidable fringe of VINE SCRUB covered the margin
and approaches, and had to be cut through before the cattle could cross. In
addition, a large melaleuca which leant over the stream, was felled across it,
by means of which (by tying a rope above it as a leading-line) they were
enabled to carry over the packs, saddles, stores, etc., on their heads. The
CATTLE, ACCUSTOMED TO SWIMMING, took the water in splendid style, ONE, however,
getting entangled and DROWNED. With the HORSES they were not so fortunate, for
though a headstall was put on each, with a rope attached to the bit, to haul
them across, the rapidity of the current swept away TWO of them into a tangle
of vines in the middle of the stream, under which they were carried and
DROWNED, despite the exertions of four or five of the party to pull them across
by the rope. Their efforts to save them nearly cost their own lives, and A.
JARDINE chronicles receiving a 'nasty crack' on the head from a log in
attempting to disentangle his own horse, 'Jack,' from the vines. The other,
'Blokus,' was a Government horse, belonging to Mr. Richardson. Both were useful
horses and a great loss to the party, but only the forerunner of much greater
ones. The creek at last crossed, the party attempted to push forward on the
other side; but after travelling a mile leading the horses, slushing through
bog and swamp, under a heavy rain, they were obliged to turn back and encamp on
some high ground on the banks of the creek, about half a mile above the
crossing, where there was a little good grass. Several of their horses were
left behind, one more in particular, 'Nell Gwynne,' being too weak to travel."
[CAMP 67.]</blockquote>
<p>This camp (Camp 67) was in the centre of what is now a "POLICE RESERVE" of
about 840 square miles.</p>
<p>12th January. The HORSES left bogged on the previous day were got out, but
FIVE DIED from eating some POISONOUS HERB, and one was missing and was supposed
to have been drowned. BLINDNESS was one of the effects of the poison. The
remaining horses were confined in an improvised yard. Owing to the loss of so
many transport animals, only one man, Binny, tailing the cattle, could now be
allowed to ride. Horseshoes and other articles were buried in a "<i>cache</i>."
The day was marked "BLACK THURSDAY" in the Leader's diary, and the entry closed
with the words "<i>Nil desperandum</i>."</p>
<p>The HORSES were now reduced to TWENTY-ONE, and these the poorest and worst,
another of the malignant peculiarities of the poison being that it attacks the
animals which are in the best condition&mdash;presumably because they eat more
heartily.</p>
<p>"With stout hearts and naked legs," the Brothers Jardine, Binney, Scrutton
and the four black boys set out on 13th January to face what further trials
might be ahead of them, for by this time their wardrobes had been reduced to
shirt and belt. A stage of 10 miles NE. by N. was made with the utmost
difficulty during the day. The country was composed of ridges of red soil,
divided by boggy black soil flats covered with tea tree. "The CATTLE floundered
and BOGGED at every hundred yards, and even the spare unladen horses had to be
pulled out. The latter were at length so completely knocked up that it was
necessary to leave some of them at one side of the swamp, the party carrying
their pack and loads about a quarter of a mile on to a dry ridge on the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 317}</u></p>
<p>other. Here they camped, and, tired as they were, they were obliged to keep
a vigilant watch, as, to add to their many annoyances, the NATIVES had been
following them all day." (CAMP 68.)</p>
<p>On the 13th and 14th there had been no rain. By the morning of the 14th, the
swamp behind camp 68 had been so much dried that the horses were got across
without any great difficulty. During the remainder of that day, however, in
crossing the teatree flats between the red-soil ridges, the HORSES again and
again BROKE THROUGH THE CRUST and the packs had to be unloaded and carried by
the men. Two more HORSES DIED during the day from the effects of the POISON,
leaving only nineteen. The camp was made a little after midday (CAMP 69). RAIN,
the heaviest the party had yet experienced, began shortly afterwards and lasted
for three hours. In the midst of preparations for the protection of the stores
from the deluge, some fifteen or twenty unarmed NATIVES came up to the camp and
were CHASED AWAY.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"They were soon back again, however," says Byerley
(p. 48), "with large bundles of SPEARS barbed with fish-bones, but not before
the party had had time to prepare for them. The rifles were dry and loaded.
Frank Jardine here owns to a feeling of savage delight at the prospect of
having a 'shine' with these wretched savages who, without provocation, hung on
their footsteps, dogging them like hawks all through the thickest of their
troubles, watching, with cowardly patience, for a favourable moment to attack
them at a disadvantage. Even then, however, he would not be the aggressor, but
allowed them to come within sixty yards and ship their SPEARS in the WIMMERAS
before they were fired upon. The two foremost men fell to the only two shots
that were discharged, and their companions at once broke and fled; nor was the
advantage followed up, as the travellers were careful to husband their
ammunition, and their caps were running short. This, however, was the LAST
OCCASION on which the party was molested, their sable adversaries having,
probably, at last learned that they were worth letting alone, and never again
showing themselves."</blockquote>
<p>The 15th of January, "being Sunday," was observed as a day of rest, which
was much needed by men and beasts. If the party did not travel, neither were
they guilty of "profaning the day by idleness." Useful employment was found in
SPREADING OUT THE CONTENTS OF THE BAGS TO DRY, everything having become mouldy
from the damp, and in PICKING OUT PANDANUS THORNS from one another's feet and
legs. Heavy rain fell during the night and three inches of water ran through
the tents.</p>
<p>Very wisely, RICHARDSON MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CHART THE ROUTE BETWEEN THE
BATAVIA RlVER AND THE HEAD OF THE JARDINE, i.e., from Camp 67 to Camp 78, and
the reason is obvious. The expedition was boring through scrubs, unable to see
any distance ahead, floundering through bogs or winding about to avoid them,
and, in short, until the Pacific was sighted and a bearing was taken to Cape
Grenville, did not know where it was. The latitude could not be ascertained,
for black clouds blotted out the stars by night. Moreover, the flooded state of
the country made it impossible to</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 318}</u></p>
<p>judge of the relative "values" of water-courses, a "creek of the fourth
magnitude" being indistinguishable from a "river."</p>
<p>In these circumstances, with the aid of the charts now existing, I am
obliged to attempt to HARMONISE THE NARRATIVE of the explorers WITH THE
TOPOGRAPHY of the district, as the latter is now understood. I take it for
granted that the water-courses laid down on modern maps actually exist and are
in the positions assigned to them. The survey incidental to the construction of
the Cape York Telegraph line (Cooktown to Cape York) in 1884-7 gives firm
<i>data</i> for the intersections of the line by numerous creeks. The country
is now partly taken up in pastoral "runs" and partly reserved for the
aborigines or the police. In 1885-6 and 1895-7, Mr. Embley traversed and
surveyed most of the important creeks and rivers as well as the boundaries of
reserves and pastoral leases within the region now under consideration.</p>
<p>On the western or Gulf side of the peninsula, between 11&deg; 45' and
12&deg; 5' of south latitude, modern maps, <i>viz.</i>, the Admiralty Chart,
the 4-mile map (Sheet 21A), the 12-mile "Tenure Map" and the 16-mile map of
Queensland, show a GROUP of RIVERS named in their order from north to south,
the SKARDON, DALHUNTY and DUCIE. A critical examination of the narratives of
the Jardine Expedition leads to the conclusion that the so-called DALHUNTY (the
Dalhunty River, <i>de facto</i>) is the river to which the Brothers gave the
name of the SKARDON; that the Jardines' DALHUNTY is the so-called SOUTH ALICE
CREEK, a tributary of the NORTH ALICE, which falls into the Ducie; and that the
so-called SKARDON, with its head east of the McDonnell station of the Cape York
Telegraph line, falls into the Gulf in 11&deg; 45' south latitude, at the inlet
where a boat's crew from the "<i>Pera</i>" landed on 12th May, 1623, which
Carstenszoon (who obviously followed the "<i>Duyfken's</i>" chart) then
identified as the "CARPENTIER REVIER," "which the men of the '<i>Duiffken</i>'
anno 1606, went up with a boat, and one of them was killed by the projectiles
of the savages" (Heeres, p. 42). It would, however, be impossible to substitute
the original name of the "Carpentier," bestowed 314 years ago, for the <i>de
facto</i> name of "Skardon," which has been confirmed by thirty-three years of
usage. The <i>de facto</i> name of "Skardon" was unalterably fixed by the
telegraph surveyors in 1887. Mr. Embley informs me that the river at the
McDonnell Telegraph Station has a large deep channel and carries a large volume
of water in flood times.</p>
<p>The mistake by which the Carpentier River, <i>de jure</i>, became fixed as
the Skardon River, <i>de facto</i>, made it necessary to find another
water-course to bear the Jardines' name of "Dalhunty," and accordingly the
river (falling into Port Musgrave) which was the Jardines' SKARDON, <i>DE
JURE</i>, became the DALHUNTY, <i>DE FACTO</i>.</p>
<p>With these observations, we return to the NARRATIVES OF THE EXPLORERS.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 319}</u></p>
<p>On the 16th of January, 1865, it is stated that the FEET AND LEGS of the men
had been CUT IN PIECES by the thorny vines. [From my own experience in the same
district I can testify that such WOUNDS are more or less POISONED and are
difficult to heal.&mdash;R. L. J.] With considerable reluctance, but driven by
necessity, the men packed up and RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY. It had rained in the
morning, but the weather cleared as the day went on. Five miles from Camp 69,
the party descended gradually into a valley and crossed, "the horses bogging a
little; a smaller stream of excellent water running to the west. A little
further on a deeper creek, but sandy and firm, water also running knee-deep in
the same direction." Richardson, from whom the above quotation is taken,
conjectured that the last creek mentioned was one of the heads of the Batavia
River. It was, in fact, the "ROCKY CREEK" of the subsequent Telegraph survey,
and if he had crossed it twenty-two years later he might have seen the
telegraph wire above his head. Unhappily no such infallible guide to Cape York
cheered the foot-sore wanderers.</p>
<p>Rocky Creek, according to the Telegraph survey, is one of the heads of what
appears on the modern 4-mile map as the DUCIE RIVER. Five or six miles
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> further, the PALM CREEK of the Telegraph
survey was crossed, and at 15&frac12; miles from Camp 69, the party camped
(CAMP 70) on the north, or right, bank of a creek which the Brothers named the
DALHUNTY. It is described as "ten yards wide; water knee-deep and running
slowly to the westward: banks steep." This DALHUNTY RIVER, <i>DE JURE</i>, has
unalterably become the SOUTH ALICE CREEK, <i>DE FACTO</i>.</p>
<p>The PALM CREEK of the Telegraph survey, according to Mr. Embley (in a recent
letter to me) where it crosses the line, "has a big channel and carries a large
volume of flood water."</p>
<p>Shortly after the construction of the telegraph line, in which Frank Jardine
took part, he changed the name of Palm Creek to the DUCIE RIVER, in honour of
the Earl of Ducie. He ran the river down westward for some 20 miles, where he
established BERTIE HAUGH STATION (named for his own son). He found that 20
miles further west, the river ran into PORT MUSGRAVE, the common estuary of the
DALHUNTY ( <i>de facto</i>) and the DUCIE and BATAVIA RIVERS.</p>
<p>On this day's march (16th January, 1865), Richardson refers for the first
time for many months to something resembling a range. "They walked," he says,
"over some high ridges, or one might almost say LOW RANGES; there does not
appear to be a distinct range, merely a succession of gradually ascending
ridges, which are not well grassed." They were now, in fact, getting on to the
sandstone shelf which lies west of my "Sir William Thomson</p>
<blockquote>[1) Distances over-estimated, for a reason which it is easy to
understand, <i>viz.</i>, the "difficulty" equation.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 320}</u></p>
<p>Range" and which forms the divide between the waters of the Gulf of
Carpentaria and the Pacific Ocean. This divide, or watershed, the Brothers
named the RICHARDSON RANGE.</p>
<p>One more of the horses died in the course of the day from the effects of the
POISON PLANT eaten at Camp 67.</p>
<p>On 17th January, "the country was similar to that of yesterday, save that
the RIDGES were HIGHER AND MORE STONY." The ascent commenced at Camp 70 and the
summit was reached in 4&frac12; miles. ANT-HILLS of bright red earth were noted
by Richardson as reaching the height of 25 to 30 feet. At 2 and 10 miles from
Camp 70, creeks were crossed, running west, probably to join the NORTH ALICE
CREEK <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> of the Telegraph survey. CAMP 71 was
pitched on the right bank of a creek (with vine scrub and Seaforthia palms)
15&frac12; miles north of Camp 70, which was named SKARDON CREEK. This creek
crosses the telegraph line a few miles further west and discharges into Port
Musgrave. It was erroneously identified by the telegraph surveyors as the
Jardines' "Dalhunty" and the error has been imported into official maps
subsequent to 1887. It must remain the DALHUNTY, <i>DE FACTO</i>, although it
is the SKARDON, <i>DE JURE</i>.</p>
<p>The two last of the "good" HORSES DIED at this camp from the POISON eaten at
Camp 67. The forty-two with which they had set out were now reduced to fifteen
of the "culls."</p>
<p>A general course of N. by E. was kept on 18th January and 12 miles were
believed to have been accomplished. Applying the "correction for difficulty,"
the distance works out at about 4 miles of northing.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The march to-day," says Byerley (p. 50), "is
described as being through the MOST ABOMINABLE COUNTRY that can we]l be
imagined, being a continuation of loose white sandy ridges thickly covered with
LOW BUSH from 3 to 8 feet in height, broom, fern, grasstree, pandanus and
'five-corner' bushes being thickly matted together with PRICKLY VINE. Not a
tree relieved the monotony of this waste, and, what was worse, NOT A BLADE OF
GRASS was seen for miles. Several DEEP CREEKS were crossed, all running
strongly with clear pellucid water to W. and NW. The timber, when it
occurred,was bloodwood, stringy- and iron-bark on the ridges, banksia,
grevillia and several kinds of teatrees in the gullies, which were honeycombed
and boggy. Two new kinds of PALM were seen. The bush, which seems to be what
Kennedy alluded to as "HEATH," could only be got through by leading a horse
ahead, the others following slowly behind him, the cattle then following in
their track. A straight course was impossible, as all the boggy creeks and
gullies had to be run up to their heads before they could be crossed...The
packs were continually being knocked off the horses, occasioning great
delay...Some black perch were caught in one of the creeks and scrub turkeys
were seen. Poor 'Nel Gwynne's' foal knocked up to-day, after having kept up
bravely since the mare's death. Nothing remained therefore but to kill him. The
party being without meat, and it being impossible to stop in such a country to
kill a beast, part of his flesh was dressed and carried on, which was a
grateful addition to the food, and although two or three at first refused to
eat of it, the craving of hunger soon made them forget their repugnance to
HORSEFLESH.</blockquote>
<blockquote>[1) Named after Frank Jardine's daughter.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 321}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">At night the horses had to be short-hobbled, and a
watch kept over them. The weather kept fine, raising the hopes of the Leader of
getting in before the rains." (CAMP 72.)</blockquote>
<p>A clear night permitted of a star being taken, and the latitude of the camp
is given as 11&deg; 46' 36" S. This I take to be about 3' 30" too far
south.</p>
<p>19th January. In similar "ABOMINABLE COUNTRY," boggy creeks had to be
headed, and capsized horses had to be set on their feet again and again, and
only about 8 miles of northing were gained. CAMP 73 was on the head of a small
creek running to the east, and the WATERSHED OF THE PENINSULA had been crossed
at last. Late in the afternoon, after the camp had been pitched, the Brothers
saw SHELBURNE BAY from trees which they had climbed in search of the honeycomb
of the native bee.</p>
<p>20th January. After having pushed on for 2 miles northward through brushwood
and scrub, the travellers were confronted with a dense PINE-AND-VINE SCRUB.
After some delay, a NATIVE TRACK was found and followed through the scrub for 2
miles further, when it was found that the tangle of scrub and vine ropes was
more than the cattle could face. The native track was therefore retraced, and
half a mile was made to the east, to a point whence Shelburne Bay was
distinctly visible. Thence a stony spur of the range was followed down and the
party camped on a small creek running east. (CAMP 74. ) The total distance
covered was estimated at 9 miles, and the actual northing at a mile and a half.
Quoting from the Leader's diary, Byerley observes that the tracks of NATIVES
were very numerous on this day's journey, "and it was evident by the neat
cutting of the marks on the trees that they were provided with good IRON
TOMAHAWKS. Many TURKEYS' NESTS were found, but the eggs only benefited the
stronger stomachs of the party, having young ones in them in most cases."</p>
<p>From a point near Camp 74, Richardson got a prismatic compass bearing of
117&deg; to CAPE GRENVILLE and thus determined the position of the camp with
some approach to accuracy. [My camp 51 (1st March, 1880), must have been
practically on the same spot.-R. L. J.]</p>
<p>It is a coincidence, although, considering the nature of the country, by no
means a "remarkable" one, that in this region the THREE PARTIES which were
making for Cape York, Kennedy's (by this time reduced to himself and a black
boy), the Jardines' and my own, each HAD TO DOUBLE BACK and search for a new
opening.</p>
<p>From their 74th almost to their 76th Camps, the track of the Brothers was
east of mine, and west of Kennedy's, mine being on the western and the
Jardines' and Kennedy's on the eastern side of the watershed. Kennedy's and
mine could not have been more than 2 miles apart.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 322}</u></p>
<p>21st January. The SCRUB was so dense that more than seven hours were spent
in cutting 8 miles through it to the NNE. It was described by the Brothers as
"FEARFULLY DIFFICULT." "The cattle occasionally got their horns entangled in
the vines and had to be cut loose. One cow got furious at being thus arrested,
and when extricated galloped straight away and was no more seen...A great
variety of PALMS were seen in the scrubs, which were covered with fruit and
berries, but only the '<i>Seaforthia</i>,' the most graceful of the family, the
<i>Caryota urens</i>, remarkable for its star-shaped fronds, and the more
common <i>Corypha</i>, of which the Colonial straw hats are made, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> were known to the travellers." Four deep and narrow
creeks were crossed, running generally east, says Richardson. The Brothers say,
seven creeks, running westward. There can be no doubt that as regards the
direction of the flow Richardson was in the right, as they were on the
coastward side of the watershed. They must have crossed KENNEDY'S TRACK,
between his camps of 21st and 22nd November, 1848. CAMP 75 was probably on, or
not far from, my "CAPTAIN BILLY CREEK." Its latitude is given by Byerley as
11&deg; 37' 46" S., which I take to be 3&frac12; miles too far south. The fact
that Richardson (who made the observations) does not record the latitude
suggests that he himself doubted its accuracy.</p>
<p>22nd January. The same class of country prevailed, with even a more marked
ABSENCE OF GRASS. The distance travelled was estimated at 10 miles, but the
actual northing can hardly have been more than half. Four or five creeks were
crossed, all running east. CAMP 76 was among open brushwood near one of them,
which was probably CAMISADE CREEK, at the mouth of which (my Camp 57) the
blacks made a nocturnal attack on my party in 1880. Heavy RAIN set in before
Camp 76 was reached and continued till midnight.</p>
<p>23rd January. The rain fell steadily all day long. The course was altered to
NNW., and for some distance was on the DIVIDE between the Pacific (5 miles to
the east) and the Gulf (48 miles to the west). The distance traversed was
estimated at 9&frac12; miles, and was probably about 6. CAMP 77 was on a
teatree water-course in forest country, with GRASS enough for the camp. It
cannot have been more than 2 miles west of my Camp 52.</p>
<p>24th January. Two miles from Camp 77 a stream was struck, running north,
with a clear bed 30 yards wide. The right bank was followed for 3&frac12; miles
through heath and brushwood, a track having to be cut for the passage of the
horses and cattle. A heavy thunderstorm then caused the creek to rise rapidly
and bar further progress. CAMP 78. Rain fell at intervals till midnight.

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 323}</u></p>
<p>camp cannot have been more than 2 miles west of MY CAMP 53, from which I
DOUBLED BACK to the south, on 4th March, 1880, TO AVOID the death of all my
horses from STARVATION.</p>
<p>The Brothers and Richardson agreed that this stream must be the ESCAPE RIVER
to which reference has so often been made, and this theory, lightly formed, as
it seems to me, and adhered to with an amazing obstinacy, was destined to lead
to the most serious consequences. It is now known that the Escape River, which
was named by Captain King, R.N., on 24th July, 1819, and where Kennedy met his
death in 1848, "heads" not more than 13 miles south of the point where it
enters the Pacific 16 miles from Somerset, whereas Camp 78 was at least 31
miles south of the outlet. Acting on the theory they had adopted, the idea of
the Brothers was to get on the left bank of the river to avoid the swamps which
Jackey-Jackey's narrative had shown to exist near the mouth of the Escape.</p>

FINALLY THE "JARDINE." CAMP 87.</b></p>
<h5>(SEE MAP B.)</h5>
<p>ON 25th January, 1865, the party CROSSED THE SUPPOSED ESCAPE RIVER and
travelled N. 16&deg; W. down its left side for 10 miles, the rain falling
heavily almost all day. The country was "of the usual character, heath and
brushwood." "A delay of a couple of hours occurred in consequence of a
thunderstorm flooding a narrow gutter that might be hopped over. It was not
until this subsided that the horses and cattle could be made to face it, the
poor brutes having been so frightened with bogs and water that the horses had
to be led over the smallest of them." CAMP 79 was in "a miserable hole" in the
middle of the brush.</p>
<p>The RIVER which the expedition now followed down proved to be an ENTIRELY
UNKNOWN one, to which the name of the JARDINE was subsequently given. The great
mistake was made of regarding it as King's ESCAPE RIVER and believing that by
keeping on its left bank a deep crossing and formidable swamps would be
avoided.</p>
<p>On 26th January, the river (subsequently named the JARDINE) was traced for
10 miles a little to the north of west, and the rain</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 325}</u></p>
<p>fell heavily all day, as well as during the night following. CAMP 80, at the
end of this stage, was pitched on the right bank of a river, which was named
the McHENRY, coming from the south, and of a volume equal to that of the
Jardine itself. This river probably takes its rise near the 74th Camp.</p>
<p>On 27th January, the party crossed to the left bank of the McHenry. "This
was accomplished in safety, CATTLE AND HORSES TAKING THE WATER LIKE DOGS, the
greater difficulty being in getting over the packs, saddles and stores, which
had to be carried on the heads of the swimmers of the party, and this necessary
part of a bushman's education was not common to all." RAIN fell steadily the
greater part of the day. The day's journey was estimated at 5 miles; the
country slightly improving, with a little grass on the banks of the Jardine.
CAMP 81.</p>
<p>28th January. Following the JARDINE, with its "endlessly recurring
water-courses, each with its eternal fringe of thick vine scrub," was soon
found to be intolerable, and a course was shaped to the west. The intention was
to run the river (supposed to be the Escape) down to the head of the tide and
to leave the cattle to recruit while the Brothers found a practicable way to
Somerset. The westward excursion proved a failure, and "far from improving the
travelling, made it worse, as they got into a maze of scrub, heath and swamp,
through which they had to thread their course. They had therefore to make their
way back to the river." The total distance travelled was estimated at 12 miles.
I reckon that it must have been more, and that CAMP 82, on the bank of the
river, was about 9 miles NNE. of Camp 81. The rain poured all day long.</p>
<p>In the last portion of its course, the river seemed to be making at last as
if it would really become the Escape. This hope, however, was to prove
illusory.</p>
<p>CAMP 82 was established as a dep&ocirc;t and resting-place for the main body
of the party and the animals, while the Brothers went out to reconnoitre.
Packs, saddles and stores were found to be for the most part completely rotted
from the constant wet. (SEE MAP A.)</p>
<p>The EXCURSION OF THE BROTHERS, who were accompanied by EULAH, occupied the
30th and 31st January and the 1st February, and the reconnoitring party
returned to the main camp (82) early in the morning of 2nd February.</p>
<p>They found that it was IMPOSSIBLE TO GET AWAY FROM THE RIVER, as they no
sooner got out of sight of it than they became entangled in thick brush and
teatree swamps WITHOUT a blade of GRASS. Following the windings of the river
for a distance which they estimated at 31 miles, they struck a large creek
which they named the ELIOT, coming from the south. The course of this river has
since been determined by the CAPE YORK TELEGRAPH SURVEY. It rises in 11&deg;
30' S. lat. and the telegraph line now</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 326}</u></p>
<p>follows its left bank to N. 10&deg; W., and it falls into the left bank of
the Jardine River in 11&deg; 9' S. According to the modern4-mile map, the
junction of the Eliot with the Jardine is about 16 miles a little north of west
of Camp 82. After wading across the Eliot, their saddles and packs on their
heads, and the water up to their necks, the explorers FOLLOWED THE JARDINE for
14 miles further, until they were satisfied that the Jardine River must shortly
fall into the Gulf, and could not by any possibility be the Escape. Rain was
falling for the greater part of the three days they were out.</p>
<p>On their return to CAMP 82, the Brothers found an unaccountable DEFICIENCY
of 30 lb. in the now very scanty supply of FLOUR. Byerley, who records the
incident with hearty disgust, remarks that similar instances of non-communal
meanness had blotted the records of the followers of Burke and Wills and of
Kennedy.</p>
<p>It was now determined that the Brothers should CROSS THE JARDINE RIVER and
make another attempt to reach Somerset or the mouth of the real ESCAPE RIVER.
The RAIN being almost continuous, the Jardine was still high and the 3rd and
4th February were consumed in experiments to find a practicable crossing. All
their labour had only resulted in their finding themselves hopelessly on the
WRONG SIDE of a RIVER which was NOT THE ESCAPE, whatever it was.</p>
<p>A raft was constructed by stretching a hide over a framework of dead nondah,
the only timber light enough for the purpose&mdash;and it was scarce. On this
the saddles, rations, etc., were floated across the Jardine on 5th February.
Byerley's account of the passage is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The river having sunk considerably during the
night, the crossing was commenced this morning, despite the downpour of RAIN,
which lasted all day without a break. The stream was 130 yards wide, the banks
fringed with scrub and the current still running rapidly. It required,
therefore, strong and expert swimmers to get the horses across, the method
being as follows: One of the party went in first, with a line made fast to the
bit of the horse's bridle, and another followed, holding on by his tail by way
of rudder. Now as a horse can swim faster than a man, and is, of course,
heavier in the water, the leader has no easy task, even if his horse swim
honestly for the opposite bank, but should he turn or boggle at all, man and
line are alike powerless; the use of the rudder, therefore, will be seen. When
the leader reaches the opposite bank, he has to scramble up nimbly, or he may
have the horse on him, and, arrived there, be in readiness with the line to
assist him should he get entangled in the saplings and vines which fringe the
banks. It will be remembered that in crossing the Batavia [NIMROD
CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.] on the 11th January, two horses were drowned, in spite
of every care and precaution. Here, however, they were fortunate enough to
cross their four horses without accident, Mr. Scrutton, old Eulah and the black
boys doing good service, being all excellent swimmers. The saddles and rations
were then floated over in the raft, and the advance party (THE BROTHERS and
EULAH) CAMPED ON THE NORTH SIDE, leaving the remainder of the party and cattle
in charge of Mr. Scrutton."</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 327}</u></p>
<p>"Even now," continued Byerley, "FRANK JARDINE was uncertain as to what
stream they were on, and still LEANED TO THE BELIEF THAT IT WAS THE ESCAPE."
"The necessity for reaching their journey's end was becoming urgent, for their
tea and sugar were exhausted."</p>
<p>On this, their SECOND EXCURSION undertaken with the object of finding a way
to the north, the Brothers and Eulah spent four days (6th to 9th February).
Leaving the Jardine opposite Camp 82, they rode NNE. and at 15 miles found
themselves on "a line of high ridges forming a saddle-range." This was the
WATERSHED OF THE PENINSULA, probably a little east of my Camp 64. From this
range they obtained a view of the PACIFIC OCEAN and could distinguish a few
small islands, probably ARNOLD and SINCLAIR and possibly MILMAN ISLANDS. They
could not, however, see clearly because of the drizzling rain. Now turning N.
by E, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> they got, at an estimated distance of 5
miles [say 9.&mdash;R. L. J.] from the watershed, on a white hill [SHARP
PEAK?&mdash;R. L. J.] from which they looked on NEWCASTLE BAY, which was about
half a mile off. Then they skirted the coast for 3 miles to the west, and
CAMPED. This westward stretch of coast was evidently that opposite the south
end of TURTLE ISLAND. Their camp of this night (6th February) must have been in
the immediate vicinity of KENNEDY'S FIRST CAMP ON THE ESCAPE.</p>
<p>The following morning (7th February) they came on what they correctly
surmised to be the MOUTH OF THE VERITABLE ESCAPE RIVER. It was three-quarters
of a mile in width and running rapidly "from the NW." The flow, as given, is
probably a clerical error in Frank Jardine's notes. The adjoining COUNTRY was
"VILLAINOUS" with boggy swamps, brushwood and scrub.</p>
<p>For three days (7th, 8th and 9th February) the Brothers erred and strayed
over the western side of the little peninsula almost encircled by the Escape
River and the Pacific Ocean. Again and again they tried in vain to CROSS THE
ESCAPE, the mosquitoes and the bogs and scrubs of the VILLAINOUS COUNTRY
combining to reduce the horses to the last stage of debility.</p>
<p>It is impossible to chart these wanderings from the bearings and distances
given. The Brothers met the same difficulties which had made a pothook of
KENNEDY'S ROUTE seventeen years before. Even eighteen years later, in spite of
having the experiences of my two predecessors to warn me, I HAD TO "HEAD" THE
ESCAPE, after trying to cross it.</p>
<p>FRANK JARDINE HAD COME ROUND AGAIN TO THE BELIEF, which he had persisted in
almost against the evidences of his senses, THAT THE JARDINE RIVER WAS ONLY THE
HEAD OF THE ESCAPE, his theory</p>
<blockquote>[1) It is doubtful whether the Brothers carried, or used, a pocket
compass. They would trust, like bushmen, to taking their bearings from the sun,
which, in such weather, would be a poor guide.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 328}</u></p>
<p>being, that if he had only followed the Jardine down a few miles beyond his
"furthest west" of 1st February, he would have found the river doubling back to
the east coast. He had, he imagined, proved that there was no way for the
cattle across the ESCAPE, and made up his mind that the only thing to be done
was to drive them down the (Jardine) river and get them round its supposed
elbow.</p>
<p>It is not for a moment suggested that the Leader of the expedition was
"bushed" during his wanderings in the little peninsula east of the Escape
River. If proof were needed, it would be found in the fact that, having turned
back on the 10th, he found himself on the 11th on the right bank of the Jardine
River, opposite Camp 82. This, however, was due rather to the mysterious
instinct of locality known as bushmanship than to steering a course.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the camp their horses were incapable of a greater
pace than a mile and a half an hour with the assistance of their now dismounted
riders. They were left on the right bank of the river, while the Brothers and
Eulah swam across to the camp. A very heavy thunderstorm had flooded the little
creeks during the last part of the day's journey. It was found that another of
the HORSES had DIED at the camp from exhaustion.</p>
<p>RICHARDSON agreed with the Brothers. His diary of 11th February says: "There
is no doubt that the river near which we are encamped is the ESCAPE, and our
best plan is to follow it until it bends to the eastward." Richardson's sextant
had already become an object of suspicion. On overhauling it at Camp 82 he
found that it had been injured by the rough travelling, and it could not be
corrected for some time, as the sun was invisible (and so presumably were the
stars), "both days and nights being now rainy not heavy rain, but continuous."
He comforted himself with the thought that after all the error in latitude
could not be more than fifteen miles! By 5th February, however, he had got the
instrument into some sort of adjustment and gave the latitude as 11&deg; 11'
30".</p>
<p>On 11th February, when the Brothers returned to the camp, it was found that
11 lb. of FLOUR was all that remained of the provisions. Henceforth the menu
was restricted to JERKED BEEF AND WATER, with the addition of as much game as
could be caught.</p>
<p>Owing to preparations for the journey, the necessity for rest to the horses
and the temporary loss of some cattle, it was not till 14th February that a
start was made. That day another HORSE had to be ABANDONED, leaving the party
with only thirteen. CAMP 83 was pitched 11 miles down the river, perhaps 7
miles NW. More of the luggage was left behind; all that now remained consisted
of jerked meat, ammunition, tents and personal swags.</p>
<p>Although the expedition followed the footsteps of the Brothers on their
first <i>reconnaissance</i>, it was found that taking the CATTLE over the
sodden ground was a very different matter from travelling</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 329}</u></p>
<p>in light marching order. On 15th February, no less than three hours were
consumed in crossing one of the boggy gullies. The horses had to be unpacked,
and half of them had to be pulled across with ropes. From Camp 83 to CAMP 84, 8
miles east of the Eliot River, the distance was estimated at 11 miles.</p>
<p>16th February. The ELIOT RIVER was crossed; it was 30 yards wide and 5 feet
deep, with sandstone outcrops. The horses had to be relieved of their loads.
Two miles further, CAMP 85 was pitched on the river bank after 10 miles had
been accomplished. The camp must have been where the TELEGRAPH LINE now crosses
the Jardine.</p>
<p>17th February. CAMP 86 was on the right bank of a large creek falling into
the Jardine, 8 miles down the latter from Camp 85, and 2 miles beyond the
Brothers' camp of 1st February.</p>
<p>18th February. The creek at Camp 86 was crossed in the morning, cattle,
horses and men having to SWIM, the men carrying the saddles and loads on their
heads. The course of the Jardine River had now become NORTHWARD, and for a
short time the travellers were elated by the conviction that they were about to
round the elusive and mythical "BEND TO THE EAST," which had by this time
become an article of faith with them. The 10 miles of this day's march are
described as "poorly grassed stringybark ridges" for the first mile, and then
"the country resumed its old character of swamp, brushwood and low scrubby
banks, flooded for 4 or 5 feet, the overflow filling swamps running parallel,
and about 300 or 400 yards distant from the river." After CAMP 87 had been
fixed, a suspicion arose that the river was within the influences of the tide,
a rise and fall of 6 inches being perceptible, although, owing to the floods,
the water was fresh.</p>
<p>Richardson made the latitude of the camp 10&deg; 56' 14" S., which is nearly
correct.</p>
<p>A halt was made at this spot earlier than would otherwise have been the
case, because the party had started without breakfast, having NOTHING TO EAT,
and it had become necessary to kill a calf.</p>
<p>The 19th February, "being Sunday," was, according to Byerley, "chiefly
devoted to rest," the slight exception being the cutting up, jerking and
smoking of the meat, a bark hut having to be erected for the smoking
process.</p>
<p>20th February. Heavy RAIN fell from 2 a.m. till after the party resumed
their journey. It was found that the JARDINE RIVER again took a WESTWARD
COURSE, and after following it in this direction for 6 miles [say 4.&mdash;R.
L. J.] the procession was brought to a standstill by a creek coming from the
south, fringed with mangroves, the banks showing a TIDAL RISE AND FALL of 3
feet. The Brothers and Eulah crossed the creek and ALICK and Eulah climbed a
tree, from which they saw the MOUTH OF THE JARDINE RIVER some 2 miles distant,
and also PRINCE OF WALES and BARN</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 330}</u></p>
<p>ISLANDS. The rain poured down heavily and CAMP 88 was pitched on the
eastern, or right, bank of the creek.</p>
<p>THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED! And the solution was a disgusting anti-climax. THE
RIVER WAS NOT THE ESCAPE, and it lay, an apparently insurmountable barrier,
between the explorers and their goal, where the father anxiously awaited the
sons, who were NOW LESS THAN 30 MILES SOUTH-WEST OF SOMERSET.</p>
<p>Six miles south-west of the mouth of the river an indentation in the
coast-line of the <i>Endeavour</i> Straits maybe the "waterplaets"
(watering-place) marked on the chart by JAN CARSTENSZOON on 13th May, 1623,
when he and ten musketeers landed from the "<i>Pera</i>" and found "a very fine
FRESH-WATER RIVER, flowing into the sea, whence fresh water can easily be
obtained by means of boats or pinnaces." This inlet was named the REVIER VAN
SPULT, and there can be no doubt that it is a MOUTH OF THE JARDINE RIVER. The
fresh water at the landing was probably due to floods. It is strange that
Carstenszoon's diary never once mentions any meteorological conditions except
winds.</p>
<p>On the NEW RIVER, the Brothers proposed to bestow the name of the DECEPTION,
but subsequently the Governor of Queensland, Sir George Bowen, gave orders that
it should be charted, and named it the JARDINE RIVER. No name could have been
more appropriate. The Brothers had indeed made the river their own. They had
discovered it, followed it down from its head to the salt water during twelve
toilsome and costly marches and investigated its surroundings. In time alone it
had cost them a month, and was yet to cost some weeks more before the remnant
of the cattle was delivered at Somerset.</p>

SPULT RIVER.</b></p>
<p>ON 22nd February, 1865, the whole party retraced their steps to CAMP 87.
(SEE MAP A.) A day (23rd February) was spent in killing a calf and drying the
meat and in the construction of a RAFT like the one employed at Camp 82. The
rain was falling heavily and the Jardine River was rising fast.</p>
<p>On 24th February, the BROTHERS AND EULAH started on a THIRD EXCURSION OR
RECONNAISSANCE IN SEARCH OF SOMERSET. HEAVY RAIN fell during the whole of the
day and a COLD WIND nipped the wet and half-clad travellers more severely than
they had a right to expect midway between the equator and the Tropic of
Capricorn. By this time, however, they had learned the natives' trick of
protecting themselves from the elements and the mosquitoes by SMEARING THEIR
BODIES WITH FAT.</p>
<p>Opposite CAMP 87, the JARDINE RIVER had to be crossed. The HORSES SWAM
gallantly and the RAFT rode well on the flood, but the transit took the whole
of the day, the party camping on the right bank of the JARDINE.</p>
<p>Next day (25th February) the travellers were arrested only 2 miles from the
river by COWAL CREEK, which was in high flood, at least half a mile wide,
running strongly, and, in short, IMPASSABLE. Three nights (25th, 26th and 27th)
were spent on the LEFT BANK OF THE COWAL, and the days were occupied in trying
to find a crossing and hunting for something to supplement the ration of dried
veal. The only success in the latter direction was the discovery of the oblate
"WILD GRAPES," which Alick said were "very good to eat, but they take all the
skin off the tongue and lips." My own experience is that a very few of these
"grapes" may be eaten with impunity when dead ripe.</p>
<p>On 28th February, the creek had fallen sufficiently to be crossed. There was
a rapid current 15 yards wide which the MEN AND HORSES SWAM ACROSS, the
saddles, etc., being transported by a SUSPENSION BRIDGE improvised out of tent
ropes. On the right bank of the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 332}</u></p>
<p>river, the travelling improved at once to good sound stringybark ridges
intersected by only a few broad teatree gullies. The party accomplished 10
miles and CAMPED. In the evening, Frank and Eulah climbed trees and SAW
NEWCASTLE BAY, "on the south-east of the bight on which they were now camped."
This is puzzling, but it appears as if the Brothers had steered about 5 degrees
north of east from Cowal Creek, crossing my (then non-existent) track midway
between my Camps 69 and 70, and that their camp on 28th February was on
JACKEY-JACKEY'S TRACK near the head of KENNEDY INLET.</p>
<p>The 1st March was a wet day. The party started early in the morning, and,
probably heading a little to the west of north, in JACKEY-JACKEY'S FOOTSTEPS,
"over a great deal of low scrub and brushwood," at 3 o'clock met a party of
NATIVES. It may be assumed that they were now in the vicinity of my 71st Camp.
The NATIVES proved to be FRIENDLY and, moreover, were posted up in the names of
some of the party, excitedly shouting "Alico, Franco, Dzocko [Jock], Johnny,
Toby, tobacco and other English words" and pointing in the direction of
SOMERSET, which they named "Kaieeby." It may be imagined how lovely seemed the
"kindly dark faces" and how sweetly mellifluous sounded "English words" spoken
by black lips!</p>
<p>Guided by their new friends, the party travelled about 7 miles (presumably
ENE.), skilfully piloted through the scrubs and between the swamps, and reached
"a shallow SALT-WATER CREEK that empties itself into a northern inlet of
Newcastle Bay," where a large body of NATIVES was met. These blacks were
without arms, but later in the day they presented the white men in token of
friendship, as was supposed&mdash;with a number of spears and wimmeras which
had been concealed among the mangroves. The party thus reinforced went on for 2
miles further to their main camp, where three large "dug-out" CANOES lay at
their moorings. Here the whites CAMPED and watched, still not sufficiently off
their guard to feel secure against treachery, while the natives kept up a noisy
corroborree till the "small hours" of the morning.</p>
<p>On 2nd March, the Brothers were up and away at daylight, in spite of a
downpour of rain, the blacks guiding them to and along the coast, and they
REACHED SOMERSET at noon. Father and sons met at last after five months of
anxiety on one side and heroic effort on the other.</p>
<p>JOHN JARDINE had realised, before he had been long resident in Somerset that
the intricate nature of the country must render the approach from the south a
matter of difficulty, especially in a wet season. With the object of guiding
his sons to the settlement, he had, therefore, MARKED A LINE OF TREES, about 30
miles in length, south-westward to the head of the Kennedy (Jackey-Jackey
Creek). [That would be about 2 miles south of my Camp 68.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 333}</u></p>
<p>From that point, the line went west for 10 miles to the Gulf coast [which
would be on the parallel of 11&deg; 5' S. lat., crossing the JARDINE RIVER, and
in all probability also the VAN SPULT, and passing close to the Brothers' Camp
86.&mdash;R. L. J.]. The line was not observed, however, having probably been
hidden by a rapid growth of scrub.</p>

<p>THE 2nd, 3rd and 4th March, 1865, were spent in getting five fresh horses
across the Strait from Albany Island and in selecting a SITE FOR THE CATTLE
STATION. (SEE MAP A.) The spot chosen was at VALLACK POINT, 3 miles south of
Somerset.</p>
<p>On 5th March, the two Brothers left Somerset for Camp 87, with black guides
to show them the best track. They were also accompanied by a younger brother,
John, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> the "Jock "whose name, as pronounced by
the friendly natives on the 1st March, sounded like "Dzocko." The guides led
for some time by the line of marked trees to the SW. which was "a fair road for
the cattle" and only presented a few light belts of scrub. The first night was
spent where the Brothers had camped with the tribe on 1st March, which was 17
miles from Somerset by the new track. Next day (6th March) the Brothers took
the lead and in 22 miles reached the JARDINE RIVER nearly opposite CAMP 87. The
river was still high and had been even higher during their absence. It was too
late in the day for the party to cross, but two of the black guides swam over
and returned with a large supply of beef. This was welcome enough to the
whites, but to the native guides, who had never before seen cattle or fresh
beef, it was nothing less than a revelation. The feast the blacks indulged in
was a GARGANTUAN MEAL which filled the Brothers with awe.</p>
<p>The whole party swam across to CAMP 87 next morning (7th March), and were
confronted with the familiar tale of missing horses and cattle. One of the
horses had died. A beast was killed and with its hide a RAFT was constructed,
having a carrying capacity of 400 lb.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Afterwards the owner of Aberfoyle Station, near
Hughenden.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 335}</u></p>
<p>Three of the CATTLE were still missing and were LEFT BEHIND when the
expedition finally CROSSED THE JARDINE on 9th March. COWDEROY, who was unable
to swim, was taken across holding on by the raft, which was upset, and he
NARROWLY ESCAPED DROWNING. The passage had been completed in safety by four
o'clock and the party camped on the right bank. CAMP 89.</p>
<p>10th March. The distance covered to the NE. was estimated at 11 miles. COWAL
CREEK had to be swum early in the day. A HORSE, too much exhausted to travel
further, had to be LEFT BEHIND. CAMP 90 must have been close to my Camp 71.</p>
<p>It may be remarked here that between Cowal Creek and Camp 90, the Brothers'
line of march is now crossed by the TELEGRAPH LINE, which goes nearly due north
to <i>Endeavour</i> Strait, and then follows the beach north-eastward to Cape
York. Probably the beach offers much better travelling than was found by the
Jardine Brothers or myself.</p>
<p>11th March. The LINE OF TREES marked by Mr. John Jardine, Senior, was
followed for 10 miles. A long detention took place at a scrub on WIMMERAH
CREEK, and here thirty head of CATTLE were LOST. CAMP 91 was pitched on the
north side of CHIPPAGYNYA LAKE. THREE HORSES KNOCKED UP.</p>
<p>The following day (12th March) was spent in the recovery of twenty-five of
the thirty cattle lost at Wimmerah Creek. The camp was not moved.</p>
<p>On 13th March, the whole party arrived at Vallack Point, CAMP 92, in about 8
miles. About midway they were met at LAKE BORONTO by Mr. John Jardine,
Senior.</p>
<p>Thus ended the long march of the pioneers. Nearly five months had elapsed
since they left CARPENTARIA DOWNS, the furthest outpost of civilisation, and
the main body had covered about 900 miles, irrespective of several hundreds of
miles traversed by the Brothers, singly or together, prospecting for "good
travelling" for the cattle.</p>
<p>It is very easy and very cheap to speculate on "the might have been," and
yet the temptation to do so is irresistible.</p>
<p>An actual economy of time would probably have been effected by the Brothers
if they had made two separate trips. Had they left the cattle behind, chosen a
suitable season, and travelled in light marching order, I have no hesitation in
saying, knowing the men as I did, that they could have "romped through,"
marking a practicable <i>route</i> for the cattle as they went, in a couple of
months. They could then have led the cattle to their destination without
distress. As it was, the difficulties that met them at every step, and the
consequent delays, were due almost entirely to the dragging weight of the
helpless tail of cattle; and the cattle had to be knocked about hither and
thither while a way was found for them.</p>
<p>The expedition cannot have been much of a commercial success,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 336}</u></p>
<p>owing to the loss of three-fourths of the horses (including all that were of
value) and at least a fifth of the cattle.</p>
<p>The Brothers have been criticised for their treatment of the BLACKS, and
their tale shows that about fifty of the latter fell. Still it must not be
forgotten that the hostility and treachery of the blacks was entirely
unprovoked. These natives dogged the steps of the travellers, and threatened
their lives day by day. There can be no doubt that had the Brothers betrayed
any weakness, they would have shared Kennedy's fate.</p>
<p>I incline to the belief, founded on personal contact with the AUSTRALIAN
ABORIGINES, that their MURDEROUS PROPENSITIES have no higher motive than MERE
SPORTSMANSHIP. Their instinct is to ambush and kill their game, and to a race
of cannibals human strangers are big game, and nothing more.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is just possible that traditions of the descent of
white men or Malays on the shores of the Cape York Peninsula may have been
handed down among the natives for hundreds of years; at all events since the
earliest landing of the DUTCHMAN, or the perhaps still earlier landing of
SPANIARDS and PORTUGUESE, and that the intrusion of foreigners was synonymous
in their minds with surprise, slaughter and kidnapping. Even in that case the
question of "Who began it?" may be raised. Unless the savages of three
centuries ago were of milder manners than their descendants of to-day, I
believe that they would have been tempted beyond their strength if ever they
saw strangers at their mercy.</p>
<p>The contribution of the Jardine Brothers to a knowledge of the GEOGRAPHY OF
THE CAPE YORK PENINSULA was of immensely greater value than that of Leichhardt
or Kennedy. The former only touched on a corner of the Peninsula and the
journal of the latter perished with him. We owe to the Brothers our first real
knowledge of the western interior of the Peninsula. I esteem it a privilege to
have traced their steps, with the aid of modern maps, over a country which in
their time was an uncharted waste.</p>
<p>ALICK JARDINE is now resident in London. In 1863, the Brothers were awarded
the Murchison grant of the Royal Geographical Society in recognition of their
services of twenty-one years previously. Two interesting PHOTOGRAPHS are
reproduced in this volume. The first is from Byerley's frontispiece, and shows
Frank (sitting) and Alick (standing), and apparently dates from 1867. The
second is from the <i>Queenslander</i> of 10th February, 1917, and is a recent
portrait of FRANK. The latter settled at Somerset on his arrival with the
cattle in 1865, and after the transfer of the government offices to Thursday
Island made the old residency his home, or rather headquarters. After his
father's return to the south, Frank was Acting Resident many times during the
intervals between the periods when his father's successors held the office. For
some years, his pastoral interests occupied his attention, but in</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 337}</u></p>
<p>course of time he directed his activities, with the assistance of his elder
son, chiefly to pearl-shelling among the islands of the Coral Sea. He DIED at
Somerset on 18th March, 1919, after a short illness, having retained his vigour
almost to the last. It is said that he kept a DIARY, covering the whole of his
northern life. It is to be hoped that this diary will be given to the public.
It should be an historical record such as very few men have had the opportunity
of compiling.</p>
<p>EULAH, one of the black boys who came with the Brothers to Somerset in 1865,
settled down there with Frank. He was a member of a party of white men and
friendly blacks who were surprised and KILLED by the NATIVES in a hut at
Vallack Point a few years later. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>

<p>In the first half of the nineteenth century, BOOBY ISLAND was known to
seafaring men as a refuge, house of call, post office and club.</p>
<p>In those days, when two ships met on the ocean, it was the custom for each
to record the date, the latitude and longitude, and the name, port of origin
and destination of the other. On reaching port, each reported these particulars
for the information of owners and friends. The event was analogous to a social
call in polite society. In certain conventionally agreed upon localities, such
as Booby Island, a letter-box and visitors' book were kept. In the former,
letters were left to be taken up and "favoured" by the next passing ship, and
in the latter, such particulars were written as the skipper might wish to
communicate. The arrangement was advantageous to all concerned, inasmuch as
ships which had never actually met might be deemed to have "spoken" one
another.</p>
<p>Apart, however, from the advantage derived from the opportunity afforded a
ship of reporting its presence at a comparatively frequented island on a given
date, the necessity for HARBOURS OF REFUGE grew with the increasing traffic in
dangerous and practically uncharted seas. A ship in distress could make for
such a harbour with a fair chance of meeting other ships or finding provisions.
Hence it became the custom for ships calling at such harbours to leave what
stores they could spare. It was something like paying a premium of insurance. A
ship might leave her surplus stores at some harbour marking a stage in a
prosperous voyage, while later on the lives of her own crew might be saved by
finding something to eat at that or another harbour of refuge.</p>
<p>BOOBY ISLAND <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> served its purpose for a time;
but at length the PRINCE OF WALES and other ISLANDERS came to know of the
existence of stores of undefended valuables and got into the habit of making
periodical RAIDS, when they looted what suited them and destroyed what they had
no use for. Contributions to the stores naturally ceased when it became evident
that they would benefit murderous savages instead of distressed mariners. There
followed a period when CASTAWAY CREWS were MURDERED WHOLESALE on the Peninsula
and the Islands. A particularly atrocious case was the massacre of the entire
castaway crew (23 men) of the "<i>Charles Eaton</i>," wrecked near the Sir
Charles Hardy Islands, off Cape Grenville.</p>
<p>For the remedy of this intolerable state of affairs, SIR GEORGE</p>

Proudfoot Shoal (141&deg; 28' E.; 10&deg; 31' S.).]</blockquote>

<p>BOWEN, the first Governor of the new colony of Queensland, PROPOSED, on his
arrival at Brisbane on 23rd October, 1862, from a voyage of investigation with
H.M.S. "<i>Pioneer</i>" (in the course of which, by the way, he found the
stores on Booby Island "in good condition"), the establishment of a SETTLEMENT
(to be named after the Duke of Somerset) ON ALBANY ISLAND, "on account of its
geographical importance, as harbour of refuge, coaling station and
<i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> for the trade of Torres Straits and the North Pacific."
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The approval of the Imperial and the
Queensland Governments was given at once, and MR. JOHN JARDINE, who was then
Police Magistrate and Gold Commissioner at Rockhampton, was appointed
GOVERNMENT RESIDENT and sent, in 1863, to establish the new settlement. He
decided on a site on the mainland opposite the island.</p>
<p>SOMERSET, besides the uses pointed out by Sir George Bowen, was also to be a
sanatorium "for the people who were just then rushing to the Gulf country to
take up land," and in this respect was to supersede the establishment on
Sweer's Island (east of the larger Bentinck Island).</p>
<p>The QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT contributed &pound;5,000 and the IMPERIAL
GOVERNMENT &pound;7,000, besides sending a detachment of twenty-five MARINES
under command of LIEUTENANT PASCOE, and accompanied by DR. T. J. HARAN as
Medical Officer, who landed on 25th March, 1863.</p>
<p>The official "FOUNDATION" of the settlement took place on 21st August, 1864,
when H.M.S. "<i>Salamander</i>" CAPTAIN THE HON. J. CARNEGIE, visited it on
behalf of the Imperial Government. For some time, the "<i>Salamander</i>" and
afterwards the "<i>Virago</i>" made three trips per annum from Sydney to
Somerset for the provisioning and protection of the settlement.</p>
<p>The IMPERIAL BUILDINGS consisted of barracks and hospital, which were mainly
erected by the marines. They have long ago disappeared, and their site is
covered with scrub. The COLONIAL BUILDINGS (which included a custom house) were
on the site occupied by Frank Jardine's residence until his death in March,
1919.</p>
<p>The necessity for the establishment may be gauged from the record of the
year 1866, during which forty men, being the CREWS OF THREE WRECKED SHIPS, were
taken south by the "<i>Salamander.</i>" Regarding other years, no records are
available, but I have seen frequent references by travellers (e.g., James Dick)
to meetings with shipwrecked mariners waiting at Somerset for ships to take
them off.</p>
<p>JOHN JARDINE, the first Resident, held the office till the end of</p>
<blockquote>[1) At this time, the only habitation in the neighbourhood was the
<i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> station belonging to Captain Edwards, of the "<i>Blue
Bell</i>," situated at Frederick Point (the north western cape of Albany
Island). Its buildings comprised a stone curing-house and a store. (Douglas,
<i>Past and Present of Thursday Island and Torres Strait</i>, p.
9.)]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 341}</u></p>
<p>1865, when he returned to his magisterial duties at Rockhampton.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by CAPTAIN HENRY G. SIMPSON, R.N., who was still in office
at the end of 1866. His appointment was for three years, but before the end of
his time he left on sick leave, and did not return. The office was vacant at
the end of 1867.</p>
<p>The appointment was held by FRANK JARDINE in 1868 and 1869. In the latter
year he discovered that the CREW of the "<i>Sperwer</i>" seventeen in number,
had been MURDERED by the natives of Prince of Wales Island, and avenged the
murder.</p>
<p>FRANK JARDINE held the office from 1870 to 1873. He was succeeded by CAPTAIN
CHARLES BEDDHAME, of the East India Company.</p>
<p>When he left on sick leave (say, 1874), he was replaced by GEORGE
ELPHINSTONE DALRYMPLE. The conspicuous part played by Dalrymple in 1873 in the
exploration of the eastern rivers and harbours between the Herbert and the
Endeavour and in the opening of Cooktown after the discovery of the Palmer
goldfield is described in another chapter. He also took up the Valley of
Lagoons in the Burdekin valley and discovered a practicable road from the
station to Rockingham Bay. He did not hold the office of Resident long, having
contracted a fever at Somerset and died on his way south.</p>
<p>His successor was C. D'OYLEYH. APLIN, who had been Government Geologist for
Southern Queensland in 1868-9. He had been, in 1849, a guest on the
"<i>Freak</i>" brig, when she searched for relics of the party left at the
Pascoe River by KENNEDY. The bones of two of the party, Wall and Niblet, having
been recovered, were interred on Albany Island, Aplin reading the funeral
service. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> He himself died at Somerset, and was
buried beside the lost explorers.</p>
<p>FRANK JARDINE again temporarily held the office until the appointment of H.
M. CHESTER, formerly of the Indian Navy, who was Resident from about 1876 to
1879, when Somerset was closed on the OPENING OF A NEW SETTLEMENT AT THURSDAY
ISLAND. I Saw him first On 7th July, 1877, when the "<i>Normanby</i>" the
steamer by which I had come from Singapore, lay off Somerset in quarantine. He
and DR. SALTER came alongside in a boat and arranged for the burial, on Albany
Island, of a lady, Madame de la Forest, who had died on board. I saw him next
at Thursday Island on 5th April, 1880.</p>
<p>HUGH MILMAN, R.N., was the next Resident at Thursday</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Vide</i>, Shanahan, in "Sidelights." <i>Queenslander</i>,
25th September, 1897. "The Private Log of T. Beckford Simpson," Master of the
Brig "<i>Freak</i>," as printed in Carron's <i>Narrative of the Voyage of the
"Rattlesnake</i>," makes no mention of Aplin, but contains the following
passage (13th May, 1849): "Pulled to the south end of Albany Island, and...dug
a grave and interred the remains of the unfortunate individuals Thomas Wall and
Charles Niblet, reading the funeral service over them." It may be mentioned
that the "<i>Freak</i>" was wrecked on the Barrier Reef early in the
"seventies."]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 342}</u></p>
<p>Island, and was succeeded in 1885 by the HON. JOHN DOUGLAS, who had been
Premier of Queensland in 1877.</p>
<p>"I have often thought," says Douglas, "that a good deal was lost to us when
we left Somerset and the mainland. We abandoned with it the chance of occupying
some twenty or thirty thousand acres of fine RICH SCRUB SOIL...and we abandoned
also the chance of a RAILWAY which might have pushed through the Peninsula and
made our starting-point for the East, for India, China and even the Old
Country. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>It must be admitted that much of the scrub in the vicinity of Somerset
covers poor soil; but Douglas's estimate of 20,000 to 30,000 acres (say, 31 to
47 square miles) of available good scrub land is probably a cautious one. The
abandonment of the settlement on the mainland has undoubtedly retarded the
occupation of whatever area of such soil there may be for over a quarter of a
century. A commencement has been made at last by MR. JOHN McLAREN, who, in
partnership with Mr. J. W. Graham, started UTINGU PLANTATION (960 acres), near
the old Paterson Telegraph Station, in October, 1911, clearing the scrub with
the assistance of native labour. The greater part of the clearing is planted
with coco-nuts, but maize, bananas, pine-apples, sweet potatoes, etc., are very
much at home, and grow practically "without cultivation."</p>
<p>After Utingu was started, Mr. Frank Jardine planted coco-nut trees on an
area at SOMERSET itself, and several thousands were also planted on POSSESSION
ISLAND. Shanahan records that on his visit to LOCKERBIE (25th July, 1896), he
found corn (maize), pineapples, bananas and paupaus growing at the station.</p>
<p>The CATTLE overlanded by Frank and Alick Jardine were first camped on a
station at VALLACK POINT. Writing on 11th August, 1896, Shanahan asserts that
the scrubs between the Jardine River and Somerset contained several thousands
of WILD CATTLE, descended presumably from stragglers of the overland mob, as
well as many wild PIGS. VALLACK POINT station was not continuously occupied
except during a few years after 1865, but it was occasionally camped in by
parties mustering cattle. One of these parties, consisting of white and black
STOCKMEN (among whom was EULAH, who had accompanied the Brothers Jardine on
their overland expedition), was ANNIHILATED BY THE NATIVES.<b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> On a previous occasion (August or September, 1868), the
blacks had rushed the station and carried away the whole of the stores, arms
and ammunition, which, however, were afterwards recovered. <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b></p>
<p>Frank Jardine's first out-station was BERTIE HAUGH, on the</p>

<p>Ducie River. The river and "country" were discovered by him during the
construction of the telegraph line in 1886-7. The station was named after his
son, who, it may be mentioned, served with distinction in the European War of
1914-18.</p>
<p>An incident of the early days of this station may be abridged from
Shanahan's "Sidelights."</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The manager, Harry Price, a South Sea Islander,
with three others, heard, one morning in 1893, what seemed to be a murderous
FUSILADE. In preparing for defence they loaded up the whole of their firearms,
consisting of some fifty RIFLES AND MUSKETS and a 12-inch SWIVEL GUN, and
ranged them inside the LOOPHOLED BUILDING. Presently they were approached by
twelve native troopers in a state of nervous blue funk, who had been
responsible for the firing.<br>
<br>
"Two men named CHARLES BRUCE and SAM ROE had been pearling or beche-de-mer-ing
in Torres Straits, and had been brutally MURDERED by their aboriginal crew,
presumably on Orman Reef, the murderers getting away to their own country on
the Ducie River. SENIOR CONSTABLE CONROY, of Thursday Island, with twelve
NATIVE TROOPERS, and accompanied by R. BRUCE, the murdered man's brother, were
sent out to arrest the murderers. While their boat was going up the DUCIE the
BLACKS THREW SPEARS at them from both banks of the river.<br>
<br>
"The TROOPERS LANDED at seven o'clock next morning, the constable and Bruce
remaining in charge of the boat. For two hours the white men listened to the
sound of an almost continuous firing, and concluded that the troopers were
engaged in a serious conflict with the natives&mdash;while, in fact, the
troopers were making their way to the station. As the firing ceased, and the
troopers did not return, the white men came, as the afternoon wore on, to the
conclusion that the troopers had been overpowered. Then a strong force of
natives appeared on the bank, boastfully asserting that the troopers had been
annihilated, and holding up two "captured" guns in confirmation of their tale
(the guns were afterwards believed to have belonged to the murdered men Bruce
and Roe.) Satisfied that they could do no good, they set sail for Thursday
Island, whence was telegraphed the false news that a detachment of native
police had been annihilated on the Ducie River."<br>
<br>
"What actually happened," says Shanahan, "was that the troopers marched
straight to the station, without even seeing a native, but firing almost all
their ammunition with the object of keeping the natives at a distance. One
native came up to the station after the arrival of the troopers, and in this
individual the troopers recognised, they alleged, one of the men 'wanted' for
the murder. The troopers fired twelve shots at the native, who ran away
uninjured, to return shortly with a large crowd armed with spears. The troopers
(by this time, presumably, without ammunition) retreated to Cape York, 100
miles distant, where they reported their belief that Conroy and Bruce had been
killed."</blockquote>
<p>The murder of Bruce and Roe, and the events which followed, as above
related, for a time brought the newly established MAPOON MISSION STATION into
popular disfavour. In Thursday Island, the mere fact that the murderers, who
belonged to the Ducie tribe, had returned to their haunts was construed into
evidence that the missionaries on the coast were harbouring and encouraging
them in their evil courses.</p>
<p>The story, as told by the missionaries, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
takes quite a different complexion. It appears that the murder of Bruce and Roe
took place at the Skardon River, <i>de facto</i>. NICHOLAS HEY, one of the</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>The Miracle of Mapoon</i>, p. 140.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 344}</u></p>
<p>missionaries, heard of it, and reported to Thursday Island that it had
occurred at the Skardon River. Charles Bruce had recruited his crew from the
neighbourhood of Bertie Haugh station, having previously told JAMES G. WARD,
one of the missionaries, that he "had done with the rascally Batavia River
boys," and hinted that these had not improved under missionary influences.
"Within six weeks," says the author of <i>The Miracle of Mapoon</i>, "this
crew, uncontaminated by missionary influences, murdered him."</p>
<p>The murderers beached Bruce and Roe's cutter and waited to consume the
provisions on board before going further. Some Skardon natives, who had been
invited to participate in the feast, then took the cutter, which they professed
to have "found," to Thursday Island in the expectation of obtaining a
reward.</p>
<p>When the news of the murder reached Thursday Island, Mr. Douglas sent a
police party to arrest the murderers, but gave them orders not to shoot. The
party went out and returned, "without having effected anything."</p>
<p>Next came R. BRUCE, the brother of Charles. He was a Justice of the Peace,
and obtained the assistance of a POLICE CONSTABLE and the seven <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> Skardon natives, who, on their arrival at Thursday
Island, were "enlisted by the Justice and the constable." <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> Having reached Mapoon Mission Station in a cutter, R.
Bruce, professing the belief that his brother might not be dead, and that he
desired to search for the runaway crew and learn from them if his brother had
been landed on some island, borrowed the mission whale-boat, into which the
constable and troopers were transferred. The whale-boat was returned some days
later, but the missionaries had already heard of the landing and the firing of
guns. R. Bruce and the constable then returned to Thursday Island and reported
their belief that the landing party had been wiped out by the natives.</p>
<p>MR. DOUGLAS'S OFFICIAL REPORTS, it is said, exonerated the missionaries from
all blame. My own impression, after a dispassionate consideration of the story,
as told from two different points of view, is that R. Bruce's expedition was
undertaken with a punitive object, which was frustrated by the cunning of the
Skardon natives, who had been enlisted as troopers for the occasion. Having
been landed, with arms in their hands, and without any white witnesses, they
began to fire their rifles as soon as they were out of sight, partly to impress
the men in the whale-boat (who, of course, heard the firing) and partly to warn
the local inhabitants, with whom they had no wish to come into collision.</p>
<p>It is certain that an avowed punitive expedition, with a constable and
native troopers, would not have been sanctioned by Mr. Douglas, and it is at
the same time very difficult to believe that</p>
<blockquote>[1) Shanahan says twelve.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) <i>The Miracle of Mapoon</i>, p. 146.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 345}</u></p>
<p>such an expedition could have got away from Thursday Island without his
knowledge. Either the true object of the expedition was not disclosed or the
police acted independently of the Government Resident&mdash;which latter is
most unlikely.</p>
<p>Another murder, that of a man named NICHOLLS, was reported in November of
the same year (1893). He had shipped a crew of nine natives from the mission
station, and they threw him overboard. The report that he was dead fortunately
turned out to be incorrect. Nine natives were arrested at the mission, one for
the Skardon murder and eight for the Nicholls affair. Four were discharged on a
preliminary examination at Thursday Island and five were sent to Cooktown.</p>
<p>FRANK JARDINE, who at first located his cattle at VALLACK POINT in 1865 and
next took up BERTIE HAUGH in 1887, afterwards started two out-stations,
LOCKERBIE, on Laradunya Creek, and GALLOWAY, on Black Gin Creek, about 5 miles
south-west of Lockerbie and 4 from Red Island. Shanahan, who visited LOCKERBIE
on 25th July, 1896, records that "within the last three or four years" (1892-3)
the wild blacks and the native police boys (presumably he means ex-troopers)
had been killing the cattle. In 1896, Frank Jardine "spent most of his time
there." GALLOWAY is used by the Torres Straits Butchering Co. as a
mustering-place for the cattle which come from the Coen country to be killed
and shipped at Red Island Point for the supply of Thursday Island.</p>
<p>In 1891, J. T. EMBLEY formed THORNBURY STATION, on Black Gin Creek, near the
telegraph crossing. The original "Occupation Licence" was at RED ISLAND POINT,
where the bullocks were killed and dressed and shipped to the Thursday Island
REFRIGERATING WORKS of the Torres Straits Fresh Food and Ice Co. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>LACHLAN KENNEDY, an old Palmer and Coen digger, found cattle "country" on
MYALL CREEK, and on this country York Downs station was established about 1885.
Later, J. T. Embley acquired an interest in the property, which is now a
State-owned cattle run. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> Myall Creek is the
head of the MISSION RIVER, which discharges into Albatross Bay (SHEET 21A).
About 1895, Embley discovered a river, which now bears his name, by which he
could bring supplies by boat from the bay to a landing only 9 miles from York
Downs. <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> The WEIPA MISSION STATION was
afterwards established on the EMBLEY RIVER, which is navigated by the mission
cutter. When the missionaries and Mr. Embley first met in 1895, the latter had
already suffered from the depredations of the natives among his cattle and had
been forced to take stern measures in self-defence, and he welcomed the project
of a mission settlement. <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b></p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 346}</u></p>
<p>Twenty-five miles south-east of York Downs, a cattle station named MERLUNA
was founded about 1888 by the BROTHERS WATSON, one of whom (Edwin) was
afterwards KILLED BY THE BLACKS. The station is on LAGOON CREEK, one of the
heads of the WATSON RIVER and about 9 miles east of the Jardine Brothers' track
of 1865. AURUKUN MISSION STATION was established in 1904 near the mouth of the
river.</p>
<p>PINE TREE CREEK STATION, near Mein Telegraph Station, was opened by PATRICK
Fox in 1887, while the telegraph line was under construction.</p>
<p>ROKEBY cattle station, on the SOUTH COEN RIVER, was taken up by the BROTHERS
JOHN AND CHARLES MASSY in 1884. CHARLES was KILLED BY THE BLACKS shortly
afterwards.</p>
<p>LANGI cattle station, on the ARCHER RIVER, was taken up by A. W. KNOTT in
1883.</p>
<p>The twenty-five MARINES landed at Somerset in 1863 were WITHDRAWN in 1866,
from which time till the seat of the Resident was transferred to Thursday
Island, in 1879, a force of Queensland POLICE, generally numbering four to
seven white men and four to eight native troopers, was maintained at the
Residency. The EARLY DAYS OF SOMERSET were far from peaceful. Meston records
that five of the MARINES were SPEARED, one of them, while performing sentry
duty, being simultaneously wounded both before and behind. "JAMES HOWARD was
SPEARED at Newcastle Bay and brought in to Somerset with spear-points stuck all
over him." <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The massacre, at Vallack Point, has
already been referred to.</p>
<p><i>Willmetfs Almanac</i> for 1867 has a note to the effect that "the LONDON
MISSIONARY SOCIETY has of late years made Somerset the point of departure for
their proselytising expeditions to New Guinea." Shanahan mentions the
abandonment of this mission, which he characterises as a failure.</p>
<p>Professor Semon, of Jena, who visited Torres Strait in 1895, says: "On the
mainland, near Cape York, stands a squatting and pearl-fishing station,
Somerset, belonging to Mr. Jardine, one of the oldest and most celebrated
settlers of North Queensland. Passing steamers observe the custom of saluting
his house with one gun."</p>
<p>Shanahan asserts that the natives of Cape York POISON THEIR SPEARS by
dipping them into corpses. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> It is more than
doubtful if the custom is indigenous, although this trick of "frightfulness"
may have been learned in recent years from the Papuans.</p>
<p>Until the transfer of the Residency to Thursday Island, SOMERSET was the
base of the pearl-shelling and <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> shipping, except for a
short time when Roko, a small island between Possession</p>

<blockquote>[2( "Sidelights." <i>Queenslander"</i>, 2nd October,

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 347}</u></p>
<p>Island and the mainland, was the base. In these days there was a LEPER
STATION on DAYMAN ISLAND, south of Possession Island. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>I am tempted to add a few words on the subject of NATIVE "BOYS" IN THE
EMPLOYMENT OF WHITE MEN. On many occasions I have been impressively cautioned
by miners and others never to trust police or missionary boys, who not only had
the inborn treacherous instincts of their race, but were dangerous because they
"knew too much." I have had no experience of ex-missionary boys, but I have had
several ex-troopers in my employment. These I found capable enough, but, as a
rule, unwilling to work their best. My impression is that without the
semi-military discipline of the barracks and the incentive of competition with
their fellows, they are apt to become lazy and to give themselves airs. There
is also the undoubted fact that they are dangerous from their familiarity with
the weak points in the white man's armour. This danger would probably be even
more marked in the case of boys who had mixed with white ships' crews. With
this class of boys I have not come in contact, unless I did so in the case of
Captain Billy of Camisade Creek. Lastly, I have observed again and again that
senile debility sets in, at least as regards the intellectual powers, among
Australian aborigines at a very early age.</p>
<p>When the complete tale of Somerset comes to be written, it must of necessity
form one of the most striking chapters in the history of the founding of the
British dominions overseas. Fortunately, as has been pointed out in the
preceding chapter, the material exists in the diary, covering a period of over
half a century, left by the late Frank Jardine. It is to be hoped that the
diary will be edited and published without delay.</p>

<p>RICHARD DAINTREE <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> was born in
Huntingdonshire in 1831, and came to Victoria in 1852, and resided in that
Colony till 1864. From 1854 to 1856, and again from 1858 to 1864, he was a
member of Selwyn's Geological Survey of Victoria.</p>
<p>In 1863 he visited Queensland, and spent some time in exploring and
prospecting, from Maryvale, a tributary of the Clarke River, one of the
principal heads of the Burdekin River. His observations were printed in the

<p>references to the discovery by himself of gold on the Broken River, Burdekin
Valley.</p>
<p>In 1864 he entered into partnership in Maryvale cattle station with William
Hann, and making the station his headquarters, extended his geological
observations to the north and north-west. (SEE MAPS Q, O, P, K AND L.)</p>
<p>In the three years that followed, he appears to have visited the Flinders
and Gulf country, and probably the Cook district. But he was such an impersonal
writer that it is impossible to construct a satisfactory itinerary from his
description of localities, and it is equally impossible to distinguish between
his own observations and those made by somebody else. As he was a geologist of
keen insight, his own observations would be worthy of the highest respect,
while the hearsay evidence of an unnamed "somebody else" might or might not
deserve consideration.</p>
<p>On 23rd July, 1867, he wrote from Maryvale to the Rev. W. B. Clarke, sending
his notes with permission to the latter to use them at his discretion. The
result was a paper read by Clarke on 9th September, 1867, on "The Auriferous
and Metalliferous Districts of North Queensland" before the Royal Society of
New South Wales. The paper refers to the discovery of COPPER at CLONCURRY by
ERNEST HENRY, the discovery by DAINTREE of COPPER at the "LYND" <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> MINE at the junction of the Einasleigh and Copperfield
Rivers, and of GOLD at the head of the GILBERT RIVER.</p>
<p>It may be said here that Daintree "selected" and made a freehold of the
"Lynd" Copper Mine, and, with his partner Hann, worked it in a desultory
fashion for a few years. The low price of copper and the high cost of
everything else, including carriage to the nearest port, soon brought about the
inevitable consequence, although the ore was exceedingly rich. It was not till
1898 that the extension of railway facilities enabled the mine to be reopened
under sounder economic conditions&mdash;and by that time it was not the
pioneers who were to reap the benefit.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Now known as the "Einasleigh" Copper Mine. Although Carpentaria
Downs station had by this time been established on the Upper Einasleigh, the
river was still believed to be Leichhardt's Lynd River.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 350}</u></p>
<p>In May, 1868, Daintree was appointed Government Geologist for the Northern
Division of Queensland, and C. D'Oyley H. Aplin for the Southern.</p>
<p>Daintree's first official report was dated October, 1868, and was
descriptive of the CAPE RIVER GOLD DIGGINGS, of which geological maps, on the
Victorian model, were given.</p>
<p>In March, 1869, he led a party of prospectors from Mitton's Oak Park Station
on the Copperfield River, and with their assistance blazed a track to the scene
of his gold discoveries in the Gilbert Ranges. He left the prospectors on
payable (alluvial) gold near the junction of the "Forty-one Mile Creek" with
the Gilbert River, while his own party went on and found further payable gold
in a tributary of the Gilbert to which he gave the name of the PERCY RIVER. His
report is dated 7th April, 1869.</p>
<p>His "Progress Report," dated 20th April, 1869, has a map in which the
locality of the new discoveries is given with relation to already known places,
such as Oak Park and Carpentaria Downs, and CAVE AND AGATE CREEKS, tributaries
of the Robertson River, are named for the first time and are indicated as
gold-bearing. By this time there were 200 diggers on the ground, and Daintree
recommended a site for a township (which was shortly afterwards established and
named GILBERTON.</p>
<p>From the Gilbert, he went to the new gold diggings on DELANY CREEK and the
head of the ETHERIDGE RiVER, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and then returned
to Maryvale, his home and headquarters, where he wrote his report, dated 18th
June, 1869, "On the Gilbert Ranges Goldfields." The report was accompanied by a
geological map of the district visited.</p>
<p>It must have been something of a surprise for the competent geologist and
altruistic citizen who had just handed over his own gold discoveries to the
public, to find awaiting him on his return home an official intimation that
after the conclusion of the current financial year (30th June), the estimates
would make no provision for the Geological Survey. The precise political
significance of this action is still a mystery to me, since it is evident that
Daintree had not lost the confidence of the Government, who employed him for
the remainder of his life and eventually advanced him to practically the
highest non-political position within its gift, the Agent-Generalship of the
Colony (he was the last non-political Agent-General). Aplin retired at once
from the service and took up commercial pursuits (tin-mining and tin-buying at
Stanthorpe).</p>
<p>After completing a geological survey of Peak Downs, Mount</p>
<blockquote>[1) Named, as I am informed by Mr. Alfred Foot, after Donald
Etheridge, who, in 1864, took cattle from Carpentaria Downs down the valley of
the Etheridge to stock R. Town &amp; Co.'s newly acquired station, MIRANDA
DOWNS, on the Gilbert River (Queensland 4-mile Map, Sheet 18B).]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 351}</u></p>
<p>Wheeler, etc., in the south ("Progress Report on a Portion of the
Rockhampton Mining District"), Daintree wrote his "General Report on the
Northern District," dated Maryvale, 2nd February, 1870, being a sketch of the
geological features designed to make up for the want of the complete geological
map which he had hoped to issue. In this report he claims to have made
discoveries of economic importance as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) "Eighteen months before a digger had prospected the Cape Range, I had
indicated the area of the present Cape diggings as a future goldfield."</p>
<p>(2) "It is now more than three years since I pointed out that auriferous
tracts would be found to extend from the heads of the Gilbert, by way of
Kirchner's Range, towards the <i>Endeavour</i> River."</p>
<p>On 29th August, 1870, he wrote "Report by Mr. Richard Daintree, late
Government Geologist, North Queensland, on the RAVENSWOOD, MOUNT WYATT AND CAPE
RIVER GOLDFIELDS, etc." This was the record of a tour embracing the above-named
places, and also the BOWEN RIVER COALFIELD, the tour having had for its primary
object the collection of specimens for the LONDON EXHIBITION. In 1871, he went
to London in charge of the mineral exhibits. On the close of the Exhibition, he
was appointed AGENTGENERAL for the Colony of Queensland. Early in his
incumbency of this office he wrote a handbook entitled <i>Queensland,
Australia: Its Territory, Climate and Products, Agricultural, Pastoral and
Mineral, etc., etc.</i> (no date). Besides profuse illustrations, this handbook
contains a "MAP SHOWING MINERAL AREAS," and it also shows "Mount Daintree"
(named by Hann), and sketches Hann's "Northern Exploration" <i>route</i>. The
latter shows the date of publication to be about 1873, because during that year
the report of Hann's trip of June-November, 1872, was published. During his
stay in London he received the distinction of C.M.G.</p>
<p>On 24th April, 1872, Daintree read "NOTES ON THE GEOLOGY OF THE COLONY OF
QUEENSLAND" before the Geological Society of London. This paper still ranks as
a classic in the geology of Queensland, and it was accompanied by a small
GEOLOGICAL MAP of the Colony, on which the "work" significantly stops short at
the Mitchell River. It is stated that the <i>data</i> for the paper were
"collected while prosecuting the search for new goldfields on behalf of the
Queensland Government." It is a resume and review of his field work, and
inasmuch as it gives an analysis of the Saxby River hot spring "near Gibson's
Station," it confirms the surmise that he had personally travelled in the Lower
Flinders region.</p>
<p>Failing health led to his resignation of the Agent-Generalship, and in 1876
he was succeeded by the Hon. Arthur Macalister. He died at Mentone on 20th
June, 1878.</p>

SYDNEY, 6TH APRIL, 1871.</b></p>
<p>HER Majesty's cruiser "<i>Basilisk</i>," commanded by CAPTAIN (afterwards
Admiral) JOHN MORESBY, R.N., was a paddle-steamer of 1,031 tons burthen and 400
horse-power and carried five guns.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 353}</u></p>
<p>The Commander's narrative <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> is full of
interest and brings vividly before the eye of the reader not only the progress
accomplished in the twelve years which had elapsed since the separation of
Queensland from New South Wales, but also some of the abuses which had followed
the scramble for wealth in a little-known sea far from the seat of
government.</p>
<p>The cruiser left SYDNEY on 15th and BRISBANE on 28th January, 1871, taking
on board at the latter port horses and stores for Somerset, and following the
"inner <i>route</i>," which had already been charted by Captains Owen Stanley
and Francis Blackwood and others. (SEE MAP O.)</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk's</i>" work began at the base of the Cape York Peninsula.
Thirty miles from Cardwell, and therefore about the PALM ISLANDS, a small
fore-and-aft schooner was met, apparently in a helpless condition, and was
boarded. She proved to be the "<i>Peri</i>" and there was neither food nor
water on board, and no boat. The crew, of Solomon Islanders, were "living
skeletons, creatures dazed with fear and mortal weakness...Some were barely
alive, and the sleeping figures were dead bodies, fast losing the shape of
humanity, on a deck foul with blood." The first thing that had to be done was
to bury six bodies.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The story of the '<i>Pera</i>' says Moresby (p. 5),
"proved to be this: A noted kidnapping vessel, the '<i>Nukalow</i>' had brought
a cargo of some 180 kidnapped natives to Rewa River, Fiji, some two months
previous to our falling in with the 'Peri.' At Rewa they were disposed of by
being hired out to planters at the rate of ten to fifteen pounds a head, paid
to the owners of the '<i>Nukalow</i>' and about eighty of them were transferred
to the <i>'Peri'</i> for conveyance to the various islands of the Fiji group,
in charge of three white men and a Fijian crew. On getting to sea, insufficient
food was served to the natives, who were quite unsecured, and they clamoured
for more, on which some rice was issued; but one of the white men, angered by
the clamour for food, was heartless enough to throw the rice overboard as the
natives were cooking it, and the maddened creatures rose at once and threw him
over after the rice. The other two whites and the Fijians followed; and the
savages, thus left to themselves, and wholly unable to manage the ship, drifted
helpless and starving before the southeast trade wind for about five weeks,
accomplishing a distance of nearly 1,800 miles through a sea infested with
coral reefs and full of islands; finally passing over a submerged part of the
Barrier Reef, or through one of its narrow openings, to the place where the
'<i>Basilisk</i>' found them. Thirteen only were then alive out of the eighty
natives who had sailed from Rewa. We took these survivors to Cardwell, 30 miles
distant, which was then, excepting Cape York, the most northerly point of
Queensland, and here, under the humane care of Mr. Brinsley Sheridan, the
Police Magistrate, they recovered strength in time, and were afterwards taken
by us to Sydney, whence they were carried by one of H.M. ships to their various
islands in the Solomon group."</blockquote>
<p>It will be remembered that in 1848, KENNEDY, who landed at Tarn O' Shanter
Point, opposite Dunk Island, had been unable to</p>

<p>get away from the coast until he had been forced southward to about 2 miles
north of the site of the present town of Cardwell, which by the time of the
"<i>Basilisk's</i>" visit, twenty-three years later, had become an agricultural
centre and the port for the Etheridge goldfield.</p>
<p>"Various tribes of aborigines," says Moresby, "range about the vicinity and
not unnaturally regard the white men who are rapidly dispossessing them of
their homes as mortal enemies. They show this feeling by committing murders and
outrages, and suffer terrible retaliation at the hands of our countrymen, who
employ native troopers, commanded by white men, to hunt down and destroy the
offenders."</p>
<p>MR. SABBEN, Navigating Lieutenant of the "<i>Basilisk</i>" was left in
charge of the "<i>Peri</i>." (SEE MAP K.) The "<i>Basilisk</i>" after leaving
Cardwell, took in wood and water at Fitzroy Island, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> off Cape Grafton (SEE MAP G), and left for Cape York on
9th February. SOMERSET was reached on the 16th and the steamer lay there at
anchor for six nights. (SEE MAP A.)</p>
<p>The settlement had been founded in 1866, but had failed to attract a trading
population. Captain Moresby found only FRANK JARDINE, the explorer of 1865, now
acting as Police Magistrate, and the five white men of his boat's crew, with
some fifteen or twenty coloured men, some of them native troopers and the rest
pearl-divers. The removal of the settlement to a better site was already
contemplated.</p>
<p>During the detention of the "<i>Basilisk</i>" at Somerset, an attempt to
visit some of the islands in boats, piloted by MR. CHESTER, formerly Police
Magistrate at Somerset, was rendered abortive by stormy weather, which set in
as soon as the Albany Passage had been cleared. Moresby visited a NATIVE CAMP
about 3 miles from the settlement and was impressed by the low type of humanity
presented by the idle, depressed and shiftless natives, who, in sharp contrast
to those of New Guinea, attempted no cultivation and built no permanent
dwellings.</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk</i>" left Somerset on 22nd February, and in a few days
located a reported danger, now known as the MORESBY ROCK, east of Saddle Island
(10&deg; 1' S.; 142&deg; 42' E.). Two vessels had already been wrecked on it.
SADDLE ISLAND is described as "fertile and hilly, though uninhabited."</p>
<p>About 30 miles north of Saddle Island lies GABBA ISLAND, or The Brothers
(9&deg; 45' S.), and this was visited next. The large reef south of the island,
charted as MOURILYAN REEF (after Lieutenant Mourilyan), was surveyed.</p>
<p>Gabba Island is distinguished by a couple of "twin" hills,</p>
<blockquote>[1) In 1877, the writer was on board the "<i>Normanby</i>," from
Singapore, when 250 Chinese, bound for the Palmer goldfield, were landed on
Fitzroy Island, to be quarantined because of cholera on board.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 355}</u></p>
<p>which explains the growing use of the English, in preference to the native,
name, and was, at the time of the visit, one of the chief centres of the
pearl-shelling industry. Moresby made inquiries into the conditions under which
island labour was recruited to man the pearl-shelling boats, and concluded that
in many instances the divers had only imperfectly understood alleged verbal
agreements with their employers, who detained them for years, in slavery, by
force or fraud; while in still worse cases there was "nothing more nor less
than an organised system of KIDNAPPING, attended at times with atrocities that
it blanches the cheek and makes the blood run cold to hear of." At the close of
the year, the boats were wont to sail for Sydney, each with thirty or forty
tons of shell, worth from &pound;150 to &pound;180 per ton. The islanders, thus
taken to Sydney, soon spent their earnings and were glad to ship for further
services. These statements, it must be pointed out, were not made of Gabba
Island in particular, but applied to the whole industry and region. The
existence of abuses of this kind was corroborated by the Hon. John Douglas and
Mr. Chester, P.M., and led to legislation under which island labour was
regulated and supervised, the pearlers having to be licensed to recruit and
employ labour and being forced to make proper agreements and to carry them
out.</p>
<p>Although the survey of the Mourilyan Reef was reserved for the
"<i>Basilisk</i>" Gabba Island itself was already well known. BLIGH had passed
it in 1792, with the "<i>Providence</i>" and "<i>Assistance</i>" and Captains
BAMPTON and ALT, in the "<i>Hormuzeer</i>" and "<i>Chesterfield</i>" in 1793,
DUMONT D'URVILLE, with the "<i>Astrolabe</i>" and "<i>Z&egrave;l&eacute;e</i>"
in 1840, and BLACKWOOD, in the "<i>Fly</i>," in 1846.</p>
<p>"Due north of The Brothers, the high peak of CORNWALLIS ISLAND could be seen
about 20 miles off, and occasionally, when raised by the mirage, the low,
wooded outline of SAIBAI ISLAND, lying about 4 miles from the New Guinea coast,
not marked on any chart, and only recently brought into knowledge by the
pearl-shellers" (p. 27). Saibai Island was, in fact, first charted as an island
by Moresby on this occasion (p. 132).</p>
<p>From Gabba, the "<i>Basilisk</i>" went eastward to WARRIOR ISLAND (142&deg;
58' E.; 9&deg; 48' S.). It is described as "a vegetated sandbank on a coral
reef and not more than 2 miles in circumference, and yet the home of one of the
most powerful tribes in Torres Strait." It was also, at the date of the
"<i>Basilisk's</i>" visit, the headquarters of a pearl-shelling station
belonging to Mr. Merriman, of Sydney, "the largest and best-conducted in the
Straits," and in charge of Mr. Bedford, who gave a cordial welcome to the
"<i>Basilisk</i>" The NATIVES evidently impressed Moresby with their
(comparative) advancement. They had war canoes 50 or 60 feet in length, 6-foot
bows and poisoned arrows.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 356}</u></p>
<p>Moresby remarks that the name of the island had been given in commemoration
of an attack on a man-of-war "in former years." This vague reference is to the
attack on the "<i>Providence</i>" and "<i>Assistant</i>" commanded by Bligh and
Portlock, in 1792. He saw a "war dance" of natives.</p>
<p>On the island were two teachers or MISSIONARIES, natives of the Loyalty
group of islands. They had been brought, with others, some nine months
previously, by the Revs. S. Macfarlane and A. W. Murray, from Cape York and
landed on Cornwallis and Saibai Islands, where they were left with a small
stock of "trade" for the purchase of their requirements and the propitiation of
the native chiefs. When food and trade were exhausted, the two men came to
Warrior Island to beg for relief for the wives they had left sick and starving
at Cornwallis Island, and were fortunate enough to obtain alms, first from Mr.
Merriman's employees and afterwards from the men of the "<i>Basilisk</i>"</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk</i>" returned to Sydney by the inner passage, calling at
LIZARD ISLAND and the ENDEAVOUR RIVER. In all probability the course was
outside of the Dungeness Reef, and, if so, this would be the first occasion on
which she cleared the strait now known as BASILISK PASS, between Warrior and
Dungeness Reefs. The pass had already been used, though not named, by Bligh and
Portlock, in the "<i>Providence</i>" and "<i>Assistant</i>," in 1792; and by
Bampton and Alt, in the "<i>Hormuzeer</i>" and "<i>Chesterfield</i>" in 1793;
while Dumond D'Urville, with the "<i>Astrolabe</i>" and
"<i>Z&egrave;l&eacute;e</i>" had the misfortune to discover the "MAUVAIS
CANAL," on the wrong side of Warrior Island.</p>
<p>Moresby took the "<i>Basilisk</i>" on the 5th March, 1871, to the spot where
COOK had landed in 1770, and found it just as Cook had left it. Before he had
found time to pen his narrative, the discovery of the PALMER GOLDFIELD had
created on this spot the township of COOKTOWN, with "a population of 10,000
people, three banks, a daily newspaper and all the appointments of a full-grown
city."</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk</i>" arrived at CARDWELL on 9th March, 1871, and came in
touch with a tragedy which has become historical.</p>
<p>Sabben, who had been left in charge of the captured "<i>Peri</i>" reported
to Moresby the circumstances attending and following the WRECK OF THE "MARIA,"
a brig of 167 tons. Sixty-seven adventurous spirits had clubbed together in
Sydney, contributing &pound;10 each towards the expenses of an expedition, of
which the chief item was the purchase of the leaky and ill-found old craft in
which they eventually sailed with the intention of prospecting in New Guinea.
Four hundred miles short of their destination, they met the north-westerly
monsoon and just escaped shipwreck. In an almost helpless condition they
drifted southward for a time before they managed to steer westward through the
Barrier Reef.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 357}</u></p>
<p>When, at length, they had begun to believe that their troubles were about to
end, the ship struck (on 26th February, before daylight) on BRAMBLE REEF, on
the south side of Rockingham Bay. (SEE MAP K.) The Captain, taking six men,
according to the information given to Sabben, deserted the ship with the best
boat (which would have held twenty) in the early morning, under the pretence of
going for assistance, Cardwell being about 30 miles to the west. This boat's
crew landed at TAM O' SHANTER POINT, where the Captain and three of his men met
their death at the hands of the natives. The three survivors (who had only
dared to travel by night) crawled into Cardwell some days afterwards. Sabben at
once took the gig and hurried (4th-5thth March) to Tarn O' Shanter Point, with
two of his own men and six volunteers from Cardwell. They found the CAPTAIN'S
BOAT drawn up into the scrub, where preparations had been made to burn her. The
party, who had been without food for twelve hours, hauled the boat to the water
and had begun to cook a meal on shore, when they were suddenly RUSHED BY 120
NATIVES, who emerged from the mangroves, armed with spears. The assailants were
beaten off, with a loss of eight killed and eight wounded. The gig then
returned to Cardwell, with the Captain's boat.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously with the departure of the gig from Cardwell, MR.
BRINSLEY SHERIDAN, Police Magistrate, chartered the small steamer
"<i>Tinonee</i>" which visited the scene of the wreck; but nothing was to be
seen of the "<i>Maria</i>" even her masts having sunk.</p>
<p>The fact that the Captain left the ship secretly and before daybreak
certainly favours the theory of desertion, but as his death deprived him of an
opportunity of explaining his conduct, it is charitable to surmise that he
wished to avoid a panic and that he hoped to organise a speedy rescue from
Cardwell; in short, that he only added one more to the numerous errors of
judgment which he had already made.</p>
<p>When the absence of the Captain and the boat was discovered, the mate, who
took charge, had two RAFTS constructed. These had barely been launched when the
ship heeled over, slipped from the reef, and sunk to her lower yards. Thirteen
men scrambled into the larger raft and twelve into the smaller, while some
clung to the rigging of the ship. At this critical moment, there were only two
boats belonging to the ship, and one of them was pursuing the other, which had
broken adrift. Both boats then returned to the ship and took as many men as
could be accommodated, leaving nine clinging to the rigging. The BOATS then
made for the nearest land, 15 miles distant; but it was five days before they
reached Cardwell, a devious course having probably been forced upon them by the
weather; or perhaps the occupants of the boats may have been unaccustomed to
navigation and unprovided with charts</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 358}</u></p>
<p>and consequently ignorant of the exact locality of the then infant
settlement. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>Six days later (9th March), on the arrival of the "<i>Basilisk</i>" Mr.
Sheridan claimed the assistance of the warship in punishing the murderers of
the captain of the "<i>Maria</i>" and his three men, having by this time come
to the conclusion that the existence of the settlement itself was threatened by
the blacks. The request was met by the detail of fourteen men from the
"<i>Basilisk</i>" under Lieutenant Francis Hayter, who were joined by a
detachment of native troopers, led by Sub-Inspector R. Johnstone, on board the
"<i>Peri</i>" "The tribe was surprised before daylight," and a bloody vengeance
was meted out.</p>
<p>Moresby himself took the "<i>Basilisk</i>" in search of the rafts, and at
COOPER'S POINT (lat. 17&deg; 25' S.) descried white men on the beach. Eight
emaciated and half-naked wretches were all that remained of the thirteen men
who had left the "<i>Maria</i>" on the 26th February, on the LARGER RAFT,
unprovided with food or water. They had but a single oar; and a tent which was
fashioned into a sail was soon lost. It was not long before two men became
insane and two others were drowned. On the third day, another man went raving
mad and died. At night another went mad, but was restrained from violence by
his companions. In the small hours of the following morning the raft grounded,
and the men scrambled to the beach, where they slept till daylight, when they
found fresh water and some wild fruits. Shortly afterwards they met a party of
natives, who entertained them with generous hospitality, lodging them in their
own gunyahs and giving them a share of their own scanty provisions. Both hosts
and guests were on the verge of starvation when the "<i>Basilisk</i>" came to
their rescue.</p>
<p>On the same day (12th March) that the eight men were rescued from the larger
raft, LIEUTENANT SYDNEY SMITH, in the "<i>Basilisk's</i>'s" cutter, found the
remains of the SMALLER RAFT on the beach, not more than 6 miles from the point
where the larger had grounded, the two localities being separated by what
Moresby afterwards</p>
<blockquote>[1) Thomas Tate, who had been a medical student, was Acting Surgeon
on the "Maria" and was generally spoken of as Doctor Tate. Later in 1872, he
joined William Hann's expedition as Botanist. According to his narrative, "An
Old-Time Story" (<i>Norman Chronicle</i>, 1903, and <i>North Queensland
Register</i>, 13th December, 1915), the mate took charge of one of the boats,
with thirteen men, and Tate of two boats, with fifteen men. The boats were
beached on the seaward side of Hinchinbrook Island, where the starving men
spent five wretched days, the weather being too rough to permit of their
putting to sea again. Afterwards they coasted the island southward and entered
the Hinchinbrook Passage, between the island and the mainland and, turning
northward, reached Cardwell in two days. Tate's story leaves little doubt that
the Captain (a German) deliberately deserted the wreck and the men for whom he
was responsible. The mate became temporarily insane from excitement and
exposure, and had to be put under restraint on his arrival at Cardwell. Tate,
as the only other surviving officer of the "<i>Maria</i>," went with Moresby in
the "<i>Basilisk</i>" to the scene of the wreck.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 359}</u></p>
<p>named the GLADYS RIVER. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Here the bodies of
two men were found. Two days later, the naked body of another castaway was
discovered, and its condition pointed to a violent death, the skull having been
beaten in. "Still further search, afterwards made by NAVIGATING LIEUTENANT
GOWLAND, of the New South Wales Government steamer '<i>Governor Blackall</i>,'
discovered six more bodies further to the south, which showed that those who
had landed from the smaller raft had endeavoured to reach Cardwell by walking
along the beach, but, meeting hostile natives, had been murdered." Although
only nine of the twelve men on the raft are accounted for, there is no reason
to doubt that three more met a similar fate.</p>
<p>The contrast between the conduct of the natives in the case of the Captain's
boat and the smaller raft on the one hand and that of the larger raft on the
other is very remarkable. It is possible that some difference in the attitude
of the castaway parties may have led to murder in one case and succour in the
other. Or there may have been different tribes of natives, actuated by
different ideas. It is to be hoped that the "tribe" which received exemplary
punishment for the murder of the captain and his three men had no connection
with that which saved the lives of the occupants of the larger raft.</p>
<p>In the course of the search for the shipwrecked men, Moresby discovered the
admirable little landlocked harbour which he named after his Navigating
Lieutenant, MOURILYAN, with the MORESBY RIVER (which he named after himself)
"flowing into the sea at its south head." It may be noted that the country
behind Mourilyan Harbour was shortly afterwards surveyed by GEORGE ELPHINSTONE
DALRYMPLE, who pronounced it fit for the cultivation of sugar cane, and that it
has since become an important centre of the SUGAR INDUSTRY.</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk</i>" returned to CARDWELL on 15th March, 1871, and sailed
for Sydney two days later, with the "<i>Peri</i>" in tow. The survivors of the
"<i>Maria</i>" were taken on board the "<i>Governor Blackall</i>" which had
been sent to Cardwell for the purpose by the Government of New South Wales.</p>
<p>In the course of her voyage south, the "<i>Basilisk</i>" called at the PERCY
ISLANDS and KEPPEL BAY, and the officers had the pleasure of attending a ball
in "the rising town of Rockhampton." MORETON BAY was reached on 27th March,
1871, and Moresby had an interview with the Governor, Lord Normanby, and the
Premier, the Hon. (afterwards Sir) Arthur Palmer. SYDNEY was reached on 6th
April.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The mouth of this river now bears the name of Gladys Inlet. In
1873, Dalrymple named the river the Johnstone, after Sub-Inspector Johnstone,
believing him to be the first to trace it inland, and the name has stuck beyond
remedy. As a matter of fact, Lieutenant Sydney Smith, of the "<i>Basilisk</i>,"
had been 10 miles up the river in a boat during the search for the survivors of
the "<i>Maria</i>."]</blockquote>

<p>AFTER cruising among the islands of Polynesia from 14th May till 24th
September, the "<i>Basilisk</i>" left SYDNEY on 8th December, 1872, for Torres
Strait and New Guinea. On calling at BRISBANE, Moresby again met the Governor,
Lord Normanby, and Mr. Palmer, the Premier, of Queensland, from whom he
learned, among other things, that the Government contemplated the establishment
of a MAIL SERVICE to be carried on by</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 361}</u></p>
<p>a line of steamers running between BRISBANE AND SINGAPORE. A survey of such
portions of the mail <i>route</i> as lay in her way, therefore, became a part
of the "<i>Basilisk's</i>" objective, and it was with much satisfaction that
NAVIGATING LIEUTENANT CONNOR, R.N., was added to the surveying staff.</p>
<p>Reaching CARD WELL (SEE MAP K) on 2nd January, 1873, MORESBY went ashore to
see MR. BRINSLEY SHERIDAN, the Police Magistrate, by whom he was informed that
"the pearl-shellers had received warning that the new Kidnapping Act, which
rendered the employment of natives illegal, without licence, had come into
force, and that they knew of the '<i>Basilisk's</i>' coming, and were clearing
out of the straits as fast as possible," "on which," says Moresby, "I
determined to make all haste north."</p>
<p>On 5th January, the two schooners, the "<i>Melanie</i>" with fifty-five, and
the "<i>Challenge</i>" with thirty-three South Sea Islanders on board, were
captured and taken to FITZROY ISLAND.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> As the
result of an investigation held there, it appeared that the islanders, who had
been employed as divers in Torres Strait, had, in many cases, understood that
their service was to be of limited duration, whereas some of them had served
for six years, for nothing more than food, clothing and tobacco. Others stated
that they had shipped voluntarily; some were on the ships' books as having been
legally engaged at Sydney; seven alleged that they had been "kidnapped";
others, according to their own account, had been run down in their canoe by a
schooner named the "<i>Maria Renny</i>" and taken on board; while another had
been "seized from a reef." There is nothing to show that the officers of the
schooners were given an opportunity of presenting their side of the story,
beyond the statement that "to secure themselves from the penalties of the new
Act, the pearl-shellers had induced these natives to sign an agreement to serve
them for five months from August, and had fixed wages for them." "After the
investigation," says Moresby, "we sent the vessels as prizes to Sydney, where
they were condemned; but on a subsequent appeal to the Privy Council, the
highest appeal court for the colonies, the vessels were restored, on paying all
costs connected with the case, on the grounds that retrospective evidence could
not be entertained and that an intention to procure a licence had been
proved."</p>
<p>While the "<i>Basilisk</i>" lay at anchor off Fitzroy Island, and the
investigation was in progress, the poor "slaves" had a merry time diving and
scrubbing her copper sheathing. As "some eighty" of them (out of a possible
eighty-eight) were engaged at once in this pastime, it was evidently a very
popular amusement.</p>
<p>On 8th January, the barque "<i>Woodbine</i>" was taken as a prize. She had
on board 20 tons of pearl-shell, gathered by coloured</p>
<blockquote>[1) Off Cape Grafton. See Map G.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 362}</u></p>
<p>labour, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and three South Sea Islanders,
without licence, and her men were suffering dreadfully from scurvy.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I sent this vessel," says Moresby, "to Brisbane, in
charge of Lieutenant S. G. Smith, where she was eventually released for want of
sufficient evidence."<br>
<br>
"On the 14th," continues Moresby, "we boarded the barque '<i>Crishna</i>,' of
Sydney, and found that she had thirty-five South Sea Islanders on board, whose
history was so similar to that of the '<i>Melanie</i>' natives that I need not
relate it. We sent her to Brisbane, where she was condemned and sold for
&pound;3,900, with her cargo, intelligence of which was very cheering to the
ship's company. This amount has since been heavily cut, down by law expenses,
and the Imperial Government has claimed half the remainder."</blockquote>
<p>The owners of the "<i>Crishna</i>" do not appear to have followed the course
pursued by the owners of the "<i>Melanie</i>" in appealing to the Privy
Council.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Wishing to clear up doubt," says Moresby, "as to
the existence or non-existence of a RIVER REPORTED AT THE BOTTOM OF LLOYD'S
BAY, we stood in and anchored near Low Island on the evening of the 15th
[January, 1873]. [SEE MAP C.] The chart at this point is marked 'apparent
opening of a large river'; and it will be seen, by a glance at the map of North
Queensland, that a river would be a rich gift of Nature here, as affording an
opening into the country and a highway for the transit of agricultural produce.
Navigating Lieutenant Connor and I, in the galley, and Mr. Mourilyan, in the
gig, came to an anchor accordingly, off the supposed entrance of the river, at
11 p.m...At daybreak we began our search for the river, and explored one
salt-water creek after another; but each was a failure, and led only to
entanglement in the swamp, where clouds of mosquitoes resented our invasion of
their holds. THERE WAS NO RIVER. The drainage of a hill range, 6 or 7 miles
inland, had created a swamp of many miles extent, covered with mangroves and
intersected by these salt-water creeks; and that was all."</blockquote>
<p>But that was not all. The boats had simply got lost, as they very well
might, in the network of channels formed by the outlet of a large river.
Greater persistence, or a stroke of luck, would have revealed a channel leading
up to deep fresh-water reaches. Seven years later, the writer stood on an
eminence from which he sketched the windings of a river in the bottom of a
valley which fell to the north, parallel to the coast-line, from near its head
to its mouth in Lloyd Bay. The right, or eastern, wall of the valley was formed
by a sierra to which he gave the name of MACROSSAN RANGE. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> The left was formed by a portion of the "Great Dividing
Range," which parts the waters of the Pacific and the Gulf of Carpentaria, and
which, for the reason that in this locality it is a distinct geographical
entity, he called the MC!LWRAITH RANGE. <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> The
river itself he named the LOCKHART. <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b> Shortly
afterwards,</p>
<blockquote>[1) The presumption is that the shell had been gathered before the
Act came into force: at all events, no evidence to the contrary is adduced.
Moresby, in his zeal, not only anticipated the attitude of the labour unions of
recent days in treating as "black" any commodity which had been handled by
non-union workmen, but even made his condemnation retrospective.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) After the Hon. John Macrossan, Minister for
Mines.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) After Sir Thomas McIlwraith, Premier of
Queensland.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[4) After Hugh Lockhart, S.S.C., Edinburgh, a friend of his
boyhood.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 363}</u></p>
<p>this river became a waterway for sandalwood getters and gold prospectors
operating in the McIlwraith and Macrossan Ranges. These pioneers of industry
established GIBLET'S LANDING, at the head of the tidal reaches. MR. JOHN EMBLEY
afterwards surveyed the lower reaches of the river and laid out a township.
(SEE MAPS B AND A.)</p>
<p>From Lloyd Bay, the "<i>Basilisk</i>" proceeded to SOMERSET, where she
anchored on 18th January, 1873. Her officers were welcomed by FRANK JARDINE,
the leader of the exploring expedition of 1865, now acting as Police
Magistrate. A service was held on the ship by the REV. A. W. MURRAY, who had
been conducting missionary work in the South Seas for thirty-five years. The
wet season had set in. Here an interesting personage was met, a naturalist
named COCKERILL, who lived, with his son, and a couple of natives, in an 8-ton
boat, and had amassed a magnificent collection of tropical birds.</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk</i>" left Somerset on 24th January, 1873, and anchored at
SADDLE ISLAND. (SEE MAP A.) Thence a survey was made to GABBA, or THE BROTHERS
ISLANDS. JERVIS ISLAND was next visited, and in this neighbourhood the
"<i>Basilisk</i>" stuck on a shoal, but got clear on the rise of the tide.
Jervis Island, which is said to be volcanic, rises to 525 feet. It was, at the
date of the "<i>Basilisk's</i>" visit, the headquarters of three pearling
stations. The anchorage was surveyed and named PHILIP HARBOUR. Moresby remarks
that "the space of 36 miles which lies between Jervis Island and the low
mangrove-covered coast of New Guinea is a mass of coral reefs and contains no
passage for ships and scarcely any for boats. Thus all the passages by which
ships can enter Torres Straits lie between Jervis Island and Cape York, and are
now British waters." He adds: "The natives of Jervis Island are black Papuans,
quite uncivilised and unclothed." (Cf. Douglas on Islands of Torres Straits,
1866.)</p>
<p>CORNWALLIS ISLAND was next visited (30th January, 1873). It is described as
high and healthy, a granite mountain rising to an altitude of 790 feet. It had
hitherto been held to be part of the mainland of New Guinea. SAIBAI ISLAND was
the next anchorage, and was described as low and probably malarious, with 600
inhabitants, with two-story houses raised on poles, and some cultivation. It
had for the first time been charted as an island by Moresby, who saw it in 1871
from the neighbourhood of Gabba Island. LIEUTENANT CONNOR, AND MR. PITT,
Midshipman, with nine seamen, in the pinnace and a whale-boat lent by Mr.
Jardine, were left at SAIBAI ISLAND to make a survey, while the
"<i>Basilisk</i>" sailed for the eastern islands of Torres Strait and the NEW
GUINEA COAST. On the 4th February, she touched at WARRIOR ISLAND, to find that
pearl-shelling had come to a standstill, thirty-two South Sea Islanders being
idle while waiting till their employers</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 364}</u></p>
<p>had secured licences. Next day she went through the BASILISK PASS to
COCO-NUT ISLAND, where a Scotchman had recently established a pearl-shell
fishery and a model village. The population was estimated at 150. Fresh water
had to be brought, in bamboo tubes, from Sue Island, 15 miles distant.</p>
<p>On 8th February, DARNLEY ISLAND was visited. This mountainous island was
then the centre of the <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> industry. This dainty,
destined for the Chinese market, was at the time worth from &pound;80 to
&pound;140 per ton. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> "This," remarks Moresby,
"is the only island in Torres Straits in which SAGO PALMS GROW."</p>
<p>The MURRAY ISLANDS were touched at and left behind on 11th February, and the
"<i>Basilisk</i>" stood across the Gulf of Papua for REDSCAR BAY [9&deg; 10'
S.], about 200 miles distant, on the east New Guinea coast [presumably she went
out by Flinders Passage, and north of Portlock and Lagoon Reefs, and thence E.
12&deg; N. to Redscar Bay.&mdash;R. L. J.], to visit the missionary station
established there, where the MISSIONARIES were said to be sick and
half-starving, and to glean KIDNAPPING INFORMATION. "Some large rivers," says
Moresby, "were reported to exist in this neighbourhood, and we determined to
explore sufficiently to make sure." This portion of the coast had been partly
surveyed by CAPTAIN OWEN STANLEY in 1849, but it was reserved for CAPTAIN
MORESBY to discover and survey PORT MORESBY (9&deg; 30' S.; 147&deg; 10' E.)
and the Inner or FAIRFAX HARBOUR.</p>
<p>On 5th March, the "<i>Basilisk</i>" returned to SOMERSET. On the 7th she was
joined by Messrs. CONNOR AND PITT, who, with nine men, had been left at Saibai
Island six weeks before. They had made a survey of SAIBAI and CORNWALLIS
ISLANDS and a part of the adjacent NEW GUINEA COAST.</p>
<p>The barque "<i>Springbok</i>" was lying at Somerset, with eighty-five
disappointed diggers, returning from the goldfields behind Port Darwin, and was
short of provisions and stores. Moresby acted with promptitude and vigour,
convened a naval court, deposed the skipper, whose incompetence for command was
established, and put the barque in charge of Sub-Lieutenant Allan Waters, who
navigated her to Newcastle, New South Wales.</p>
<p>The REV. A. W. MURRAY and his wife, from Sydney, had recently arrived at
Somerset, where they were housed in quarters provided by Mr. Jardine. From this
station, without even possessing a boat, Murray had essayed the impossible task
of conducting, controlling and protecting the various mission stations
scattered among the islands of Torres Strait and as far as Redscar Bay. Moresby
addressed to him a remonstrance in the form of a report on the wretched
condition of the missionaries whom he had met with. The result was that the
missionary</p>
<blockquote>[1) It rose to &pound;600 per ton in 1920.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 365}</u></p>
<p>society provided Murray with a small steamer and some young assistants.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>The tender "<i>Restless</i>" was at Somerset, with rations for the
"<i>Basilisk</i>" which had to remain in this neighbourhood till the beginning
of June, when a relieving ship was due. By this time the air was full of
rumours concerning the true object of various Russian, French, Italian and
American SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITIONS to New Guinea.</p>
<p>During the stay of the "<i>Basilisk</i>" at Somerset, NAVIGATING LIEUTENANT
CONNOR made a trigonometrical survey of the harbour. When the "<i>Basilisk</i>"
left, he was left behind, with Mr. Midshipman GRANT as his second-in-charge, to
survey the northern shores of Torres Strait.</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk</i>" left Somerset on 20th March, Moresby having been
requested by Lord Normanby to assist Jardine in looking for a better site for
the settlement than Somerset. Considerations of safe anchorage and a plentiful
water supply led him to recommend HAMMOND ISLAND, after a short visit.</p>
<p>With the object of seeing that all was right on the pearling stations, the
"<i>Basilisk</i>" visited several islands, to find the industry at a
standstill, while the Government licences were awaited.</p>
<p>CORNWALLIS ISLAND was revisited, and the "<i>Basilisk</i>" left for WARRIOR
ISLAND on 26th March. She left again for the east coast of New Guinea on 28th
March. BRAMBLE CAY and YULE ISLAND were visited and the ROBERT HALL SOUND, New
Guinea (146&deg; 3' E.), was surveyed, and the eastern limit of New Guinea was
for the first time correctly defined. The survey of a portion of the north-east
coast of New Guinea was then commenced.</p>
<p>On 21st April, 1873, Moresby took the "<i>Basilisk</i>" through the CHINA
STRAIT, round the eastern end of New Guinea. The strait and the islands to the
east, <i>viz.</i>, HAYTER, BASILISK and MORESBY, were his own discoveries. On
the 24th, he TOOK POSSESSION of these islands for Queen Victoria. Shortly
afterwards he left the China Strait for SOMERSET, which was reached in ten
days. Here CONNOR AND GRANT reported themselves, having spent two laborious
months in open boats, and having surveyed 46 miles of the great WARRIOR REEF
and 148 miles of the southern coast of NEW GUINEA and ISLANDS, including SAIBAI
and CORNWALLIS.</p>
<p>Once more the "<i>Basilisk</i>" toured the pearling stations, to find the
industry still stagnant, work having been suspended pending the arrival of
licences, and all the Polynesian labourers sent to their homes. She finally
LEFT SOMERSET on 24th May, arriving at BRISBANE on 21st June, and SYDNEY on
22nd July, 1873.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 366}</u></p>
<p>This was practically the last of Moresby's exploring and surveying voyages
so far as they affected the shores of Cape York Peninsula and the islands of
Torres Strait; but a vast amount of useful work was done by him on the east and
north of New Guinea before the "<i>Basilisk</i>" was finally paid off at
Sheerness on 15th December, 1874.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 368}</u></p>
<p>In the natural course of the development of Queensland, it so happened that
two new industries required the services of labourers capable of working under
tropical conditions on land and sea. On the one hand, there were the sugar
planters, who needed gangs of cheap labourers possessing some knowledge of the
principles and practice of agriculture. On the other hand, there were the
"fishers" of pearl-shell and <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i>, whose requirements were
more complex, and necessitated the grading of their hands according to their
skill in diving, their capacity for handling boats, and their</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 369}</u></p>
<p>fitness for hard, rough and dirty work on schooners and curing stations.</p>
<p>The "fisheries" had room for a considerable number of labourers of the
unskilled order. Queensland aborigines, Torres Strait Islanders of Papuan
descent. South Sea Islanders, any or all of them could perform the duties of
the rank and file employed in this industry. In the early days the absence of
acts or regulations prescribing the period of service, the hours of work or the
remuneration of the persons so employed left the employers&mdash;the party of
the first part&mdash;free to make and enforce their own terms. Even if the
captains of the industry had been willing to negotiate for service on fair
conditions, their ignorance of the languages of the different tribes would, in
most cases, have made it impossible for them to do so. Add to this the
"contributory" condition that the party of the second part was often by nature
and habit unversed in the art of chaffering and ignorant of values in time,
money and merchandise, and it is not surprising that in many instances the
party of the first part concluded that, "once on board the lugger," the party
of the second part would prove amenable to reason and make such contracts as
were suggested to him. It can easily be imagined that, however much the
ultimate employer might desire to secure only willing labour, the interests of
skippers, paid at so much per head, were all in favour of large numbers
recruited by whatever inducements would fill up their vessels. Without rigorous
naval supervision, abuses would appear to have been inevitable under such a
system of recruiting. It is much to their credit that the majority of the
skippers recruiting for Queensland employers did their best under very
difficult conditions; but there were exceptional cases of cruelty and
deception. Tales of wrongs and violence began to reach the world outside. Now
and then a warship made a surprise visit to the scene of operations and
executed justice at the discretion of the Commander and the Naval Court
composed of his officers convened by him. The Parliament of Queensland made act
after act for the regulation of the traffic and the protection of the aborigine
and Polynesian, and an ex- Premier, the Hon. John Douglas, having been
appointed Government Resident at Thursday Island, was entrusted with the
institution and conduct of a system of marine patrolling. It may be conceded
that the information on which the official supervisors of the fisheries had to
act on their own responsibility, was often difficult to bring into line with
the principles regulating admissible legal evidence; but, on the other hand,
there can be no doubt that Mr. Douglas and his successors did their best to
administer evenhanded justice of a rough and ready sort. The principles of this
administration were obviously modelled on those followed from time immemorial
by the Royal Navy in dealing with savages when interference became
unavoidable.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 370}</u></p>
<p>Under the (Imperial) Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts of 1872 and 1875,
naval officers were entrusted with formidable powers, to be used at their
discretion and on their own responsibility. Naval interference, as a rule,
amounted to a demonstration that an irresistible power was to be reckoned with
by white men or black who overstepped the bounds of fair dealing or resorted to
violence.</p>
<p>After some chaotic years, the Government managed to regulate the labour
traffic for the fisheries in matters affecting recruiting licences, term of
service, remuneration and other conditions, and the industry then settled down
satisfactorily into working order.</p>
<p>Captain Moresby, as we have already observed, appeared on the scene in a
period of transition. New Colonial legislation regarding licences to recruit
had just come into force, and such of the recruiters of labour and employers as
had heard of them, had suspended operations and were waiting for licences,
while others had not even heard of them. In such circumstances, action of a
very tactful nature was obviously demanded, but Moresby was enthusiastic and
zealous, and treated as a slaver, and therefore a lawful prize, every ship on
which an islander could be found who complained that he had been misled as to
the term of service (although the offence might have been committed before
there was any law on the subject). It need only be said that the courts of
appeal did not support his view of the justice of retrospective penalties. The
wording of the 1872 Act, forbidding ships to carry unlicensed labourers "except
the crew," it seems to me, left room for an elastic interpretation of the word
"crew." In a passenger or cargo vessel the crew may be defined as the men
necessary to make it go; but in a fishing-boat which is also a fish-curing
factory the definition may be stretched to the point of absurdity.</p>
<p>The foreign skilled labour employed in the "fisheries"&mdash;more and more
in demand as deeper diving became necessary&mdash;has always been furnished by
the justly self-respecting natives of Japan and the Malay Peninsula, who are
not less expert in the making and the legal enforcement of bargains than in
deep diving, and may be trusted to safeguard their own interests.</p>
<p>The sugar industry had no need for aboriginal labour, except during the
initial operation of clearing the land; and the ring-barking and felling of
trees, especially when the natives were supplied with steel axes&mdash;new toys
with which it was a pleasure to work, when contrasted with their own stone
implements&mdash;was light labour, made lighter still by the zest of
destructiveness, and exactly suited to their temperament. The planters had no
difficulty with them, and already the only terms on which the aborigines would
work were well understood. The planter practically said to the local tribesmen:
"Come when you like. For a certain number of trees barked, felled or grubbed,
you will get enough blankets, clothing, flour, meat, tea and tobacco, and a
little money for yourselves and</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 371}</u></p>
<p>a fair number of your hangers-on. Go when you are tired of it, and come back
when you feel inclined." Later on, the actual planting and culture of the cane
demanded a more intelligent and reliable class of field labourers, who had to
be paid at a rate which would not disqualify the planter for competition with
employers of coloured labour in the same business elsewhere. For the supply of
this labour the islands of Polynesia formed the only recruiting ground
available. The cultivation of large areas of cane entailed, ultimately, the
employment of numbers of skilled and highly paid white artisans in crushing and
refining.</p>
<p>Recruiting among the islands for field labour in tropical agriculture began
practically in 1875, by which time there were nearly 13,000 acres under cane.
The traffic was almost from the first subject to the provisions of the Imperial
Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts of 1872 and 1875. From 1879, Colonial
legislation provided, as the necessity for each became apparent, strict
regulations regarding rationing, housing, payment, medical attendance, term of
service, return of the labourers to their proper islands, the supervision of
recruiters by Government agents on board the vessels and the protection of
labourers by inspectors in the agricultural districts.</p>
<p>In the ninth decade of the nineteenth century the idea of a White Australia
had captured the democratic electorates of Queensland. The aborigine, in whose
possession an inexplicable, but inexcusable, blunder on the part of the Creator
had placed the Australian continent before white men "discovered" it, was
negligible because he was dying out in obedience to a law of nature, but, at
all events, the immigrant black man must go. There was no place for him in a
Utopia where a limitless wages-fund&mdash;accumulated in the hands of
capitalists and <i>ipso facto</i> wrongfully accumulated&mdash;awaited
distribution among a restricted number of white workers. It was in vain that
the capitalist remonstrated that the proposed action would put an end to the
industry and ruin those who had invested their all in it, for the labour
logician was ready with his answer: "That is your affair; no industry that
cannot afford to pay the workers the wages they require has any right to
live."</p>
<p>White Labour made an outcry about the poor blacks kidnapped and enslaved,
and the object of the outcry was evident. The impartial observer need make no
mistake about it. To White Labour, the black man is not a suffering brother,
but a noxious animal, no more and no less. But the cry of "blackbirding" was
sufficient to rally the force known as "Exeter Hall."</p>
<p>It may be taken for granted that among the earlier labour recruits there
were many who had no clear idea of the term for which they were to serve or the
remuneration they were to receive. But it was very different with those who
recruited after having had the opportunity of conversing with the returned boys
of the first</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 372}</u></p>
<p>fleet, who had travelled and seen the world and returned to their homes the
envied possessors of tangible riches in the form of European wares. Indeed,
many of the first fleet boys, like Byron's "restless spirit," soon got "sated
of home," and took the first opportunity of returning to the plantations.</p>
<p>On the plantations themselves, I had many opportunities of observing the
gangs of field labourers, and, in my opinion, they were fairly happy and
contented, and took a pride in their work. They even imbibed some Christianity,
no doubt of a crude order, suited to their comprehension. On this point the
evidence of the Rev. A. C. Smith, Convener of the Presbyterian Foreign Missions
Committee, is significant, and I should suppose him to be a sufficiently
respectable and responsible authority.</p>
<p>As regards recruiting and its abuses, the reader who desires to pursue the
subject further may profitably peruse the whole of the literature referred to
in the footnote, and especially {<i>contra</i>) Palmer's <i>Kidnapping in the
South Seas</i>, and Duffield's <i>Labour Traffic</i> (also Moresby, as in the
two preceding chapters), and (<i>pro</i>) Wawn's <i>The South Sea Islanders and
the Queensland Labour Trade</i>. This Captain was engaged in recruiting for
practically the whole of the period during which it was practised. He declares
emphatically that he never engaged in kidnapping and never saw it, but
suspected that some other parties might have been guilty. He depicts the
growing difficulties of the traffic under fresh enactments&mdash;one of
Duffield's "points"&mdash;for instance that, whereas others might send out
punitory expeditions to avenge island murders, it became at length "a hanging
matter" for the recruiter to defend himself against treacherous attacks by
natives, as in the words of the old adage, "one man may steal a horse while
another is hanged for looking over a wall." The gist of Wawn's argument is
summed up in his dedication, which is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"To the Sugar Planters of Queensland, who have spent
the best years of their lives and millions of money in developing an Industry
which represents not less than Ninety per cent, of the total Agricultural value
of that Colony; and which at one time bade fair to eclipse even the great
Pastoral and Mining Industries in wealth and importance: To those Bold Pioneers
who have opened up the rich pastoral districts along the Coast, and have been
the means of settling thousands of Europeans on the Land; and who have done
more towards the practical civilisation of the Cannibal and the Savage than all
the well-intentioned but narrow-minded enthusiasts of the Southern Pacific: To
those Good Men and True who, after a quarter of a Century of hard work and
doubtful prosperity, have been basely betrayed and unscrupulously sacrificed to
the greed of the political place-hunter and the howling ignorance which follows
in his train&mdash;I dedicate this work, with much sympathy and
respect."</blockquote>
<p>In 1885 it was decreed that within five years all Polynesians should be
returned to their homes and that from the passing of the Act no more should be
landed in Queensland. Repatriation commenced forthwith, but it was complicated,
embittered and delayed by a number of circumstances, chief among which was
the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 373}</u></p>
<p>question of fire-arms. The sale of firearms to the islanders in Queensland
had been forbidden in 1879, as was also the trade in fire-arms at the islands.
The sole effect of the latter regulation was to hand this "trade" to French and
Germans. Then, again, a number of "boys" who had completed their contracts in
Queensland had bought and paid for cheap guns, and these were confiscated
without compensation when the boys embarked on the return vessels.</p>
<p>The repatriation of the islanders by the end of 1890, the time prescribed by
the Act of 1885, having been found to be incomplete, the Act was repealed in
1892, and the limit of deportation extended. A few years later the obnoxious
islanders were finally cleared out of the country, some of them very
unwillingly.</p>
<p>My conclusions are:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) That the pearl and <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> "fishers" in many instances
wronged and oppressed the aborigines whom they induced to board their vessels,
and that murders and reprisals resulted; that to a lesser extent they treated
Torres Strait and Pacific Islanders in the same way; that these evils were in
course of time successfully overcome by legislation and supervision, and that
the industry is now as respectable a business as any other.</p>
<p>(2) That the sugar planters never did the aborigines the slightest harm.</p>
<p>(3) That their agents engaged in recruiting did occasionally employ methods
for which they had neither authority from their employers nor any reason except
their own cupidity, but that such irregularities were exceptional.</p>
<p>(4) That such irregular, unjust or outrageous conduct could be put an end
to, and, in fact, was practically put an end to, by legislation and
supervision.</p>
<p>(5) That the South Sea Islanders were, and are, the best labourers in the
cane-fields.</p>
<p>(6) That the islanders brought to Queensland were well treated on the
plantations, liked their work, and in many instances voluntarily renewed their
term of service on the completion of their contracts.</p>
<p>(7) That the whole generation of pioneer planters was financially ruined by
the stoppage of the labour on the faith of the continuation of which they had
spent their capital.</p>
<p>(8) That South Sea Island labour could, after all, only have served to keep
the industry going during its early years, because of the insufficiency of the
supply. At the present day cane growers establish plantations on the islands of
the Pacific, and already find that the population cannot furnish the number of
labourers demanded by a progressive industry, however suited for it the
conditions of soil and climate may be.</p>
<p>(9) That Queensland is irrevocably committed to white labour, which, in
spite of assertions to the contrary, is shy of field work in the tropics.</p>

<p>THE seven years which followed the return of the Jardine Brothers'
Expedition in 1865 witnessed the steady march of settlement in Northern
Queensland. In 1865, Mackay and Townsville were opened as ports. A hardy and
adventurous population had been drawn to the interior by the discovery of gold
in widely separated localities, such as the Cape River (1868), the Gilbert and
Percy Rivers (1869), Ravenswood (1870), Etheridge (1869-71) and Charters Towers
(1872). With a view to the supply of the goldfields and ports with meat, and to
the export of wool, numerous "squatters" spread out and occupied such tracts of
country as were suitable, available and accessible.</p>
<p>In the usual course of events, the discovery and opening of the interior
radiate inwards from the harbours of the coast. Townsville, however, formed an
exception to this rule. Pastoral occupation, with Port Denison and the town of
Bowen <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> as a base, had pushed out to the west of
the Coast Range, and reached the Fanning and Burdekin valleys. The growing
necessity for access to the coast at some point nearer than Bowen led to a
lookout for a more convenient port. Early in 1864, J. M. Black (Managing</p>
<blockquote>[1) In 1859, while the negotiations for the separation of
Queensland from New South Wales were in progress, Captain H. D. Sinclair left
Rockhampton in the "<i>Santa Barbara</i>" in search of a suitable harbour on
the north-east coast. Port Denison was recommended by him. The township of
Bowen, on the new port, was established in 1861.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 375}</u></p>
<p>Partner of R. Towns &amp; Co. in the north) pointed out the claims of a site
at the mouth of Ross Creek, and, in June of that year, organised a party who
made it their business to connect the site with the squatting runs of the
interior. (See Map O.) In 1865, the port of Cleveland Bay was proclaimed, and
the town of TOWNSVILLE was founded. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>The Brothers William and Frank Hann, who had settled at Maryvale, on a
branch of the Clarke River, a tributary of the Burdekin, had the honour of
being the first to take wool to the new port for shipment. It may be mentioned
that Townsville is now a "city" of nearly 28,000 inhabitants. It is also the
starting point of a railway, through the sugar lands of the Lower Burdekin to
the older town of Bowen, of another to the sugar lands at the mouth of the
Herbert River (Ingham), and of a main trunk line through the Cloncurry
Copper-field (480 miles) and Mount Cuthbert Copper Mine (70 miles), passing
through Charters Towers Goldfield and the great pastoral centre of Hughenden,
with a branch to Ravenswood Goldfield; and it must, at no distant date, reach
the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>
<p>The Brothers Hann early developed a passion for exploration, and their
friendship and business connection with Richard Daintree had an influence in
directing their energies. The achievement of the elder brother, William, who
died in the eighties, alone comes within the province of this investigation,
but it may be noted that the younger brother, Frank, during a long and
adventurous life, has added greatly to our knowledge of the interior of
Australia, from the east coast to the west, and until quite recently was still
active in exploring the less known lands on the borders of Western Australia,
South Australia and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>William Hann's expedition was, to some extent, assisted by the Government,
and had for its object "ascertaining, as far north as the 14th parallel of
latitude, the character of the country and its mineral resources, with the view
to future settlement and occupation." Its members were William Hann <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> (Leader), Norman Taylor, formerly of the Geological
Survey of Victoria (Geologist), Thomas Tate (Botanist), <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> Frederick Warner (Surveyor), Stewart, William Nation,
<b style="color:#603000">[4]</b> and Jerry, an aboriginal.</p>

<blockquote>[3) Tate (born 25th June, 1842) was one of the survivors of the
wreck of the "<i>Maria</i>" brig, bound for New Guinea with a number of gold
prospectors. Having previously been a medical student, he was rated on the
ship's books as Acting Surgeon, and was generally known as Dr. Tate. He landed
at Cardwell in charge of one of the "<i>Maria's</i>" boats in March,
1872.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[4) Nation left Maryvale station on 1st September, 1873, as a
volunteer member of George de Lautour's party, with cattle for Port Darwin.
Fifty-four miles past the Nicholson River, a disagreement with de Lautour led
to Nation and Leonard Elvoy leaving the party. Having encountered floods and
other difficulties, they were soon reduced to the brink of starvation, and had
killed all their horses but one for food. From a camp near the Roper River, in
the Northern Territory, Elvoy rode (150 miles SW.) to Daly Waters Telegraph
Station, to seek relief for Nation. Under instructions from Adelaide, R. R.
Nuckey, an Overseer of the Overland Telegraph Construction party, promptly set
out to the rescue, accompanied by de Lautour, who by this time had arrived,
<i>minus</i> his cattle. On 12th June, 1874, Nation's remains were found at the
camp where Elvoy had left him. He appeared to have been dead about ten days.
Nation Range and Nation River were named to mark the scene of the
tragedy.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 376}</u></p>
<p>Of William Hann's abilities as a bushman there can be no question. His
courage was only kept in check by his sound judgment. On the other hand, he was
sometimes petulant and sometimes overbearing in manner, and, in a word, was not
"easy to get on with." He himself confesses to occasional loss of temper and
injustice done to his subordinates in the heat of the moment. No doubt the
temper of an angel would be tried at times by the alternating hardships and
ennui of a long exploring expedition. Hann definitely charges Taylor with two
acts of reprehensible carelessness of the safety of the horses and Tate with a
want of consideration for the other members of the party. It is obvious that
both of these gentlemen performed their own special duties zealously and with a
full appreciation of the opportunity they enjoyed.</p>
<p>The principal items of the equipment consisted of "25 pack- and
saddle-horses, 20 sheep and 5 months' supply of flour, tea, sugar and other
necessaries."</p>
<p>The mobilisation of the expedition took place at FOSSILBROOK, an out-station
belonging to Mr. Firth of Mount Surprise (lat. 18&deg; 2' S.; long. 144&deg;
30' E.).</p>
<p>The record is contained in (1) <i>Copy of the Diary of the Northern
Expedition under the Leadership of Mr. William Hann</i>. Brisbane, by
Authority, 1873; and (2) <i>Report from Mr. W. Hann., Leader of the Northern
Expedition Party</i>. Brisbane, by Authority, 1873. The "Diary" is accompanied
by a <i>route</i> map on the scale of 8 miles to an inch. The "Report" is
reproduced almost in its entirety in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal
Geographical Society</i>, Vol. XVIII, p. 87.</p>
<p>Before the start of the expedition, and to fill in the time occupied in
communication with the Minister for Public Works and Goldfields, Hann,
accompanied by Taylor and Tate, traversed the country between the Etheridge and
Fossilbrook and established the fact that the creek on which is Mount Surprise
Cattle Station (now a stopping-place on the railway connecting the Etheridge
with Cairns) runs into the Jardine Brothers' "Parallel Creek," an anabranch of
the Einasleigh River.</p>
<p>The whole expedition left Fossilbrook (old) station on 26th June., 1872, and
after travelling 9 miles down the creek N. by W., camped on its left bank, Camp
1. (See Map K.) For the first 6 miles the creek is described as running over a
limestone bed with basalt on both banks.</p>

Fossilbrook Telegraph, Police and School Reserves are about midway on this
day's stage.</p>
<p>28th June.&mdash;Leichhardt's Lynd River was met with 6 miles north of Camp
2, opposite the infall of Fossil Brook. It was not found possible to keep close
to the Lynd, rough stony ridges forcing a deflexion to the left. After 8 miles
on a westward course, Camp 3 was pitched on Haskett's Creek (which appears on
the 4-mile map as Fulford Creek).</p>
<p>29th June.&mdash;Before a start was made, the party narrowly escaped being
burnt out, owing to some carelessness in setting fire to the grass. After 7
miles of very rough travelling N. by W. through stony ridges, the Lynd River
was again touched, and Camp 4 was formed on its left bank.</p>
<p>30th June.&mdash;Trying to keep the river in sight, but forced back by stony
ridges, the party gained 9 miles to WNW. and formed Camp 5 on the left bank of
the Lynd opposite the so-called "KIRCHNER Range," which was found to be
composed of "five or six hills." The first 5 miles of the day's march were over
porphyry ridges, and the remaining 4 over mica-schist and granite. The latitude
of the camp is given as 17&deg; 22' S., but, judging from the modern maps,
seems to have been about 17&deg; 32'. Hann's Camp 5 was about 3 miles east of
Leichhardt's camp of 5th June, 1845.</p>
<p>Four days (1st to 4th July) were spent in the neighbourhood of Camp 5
prospecting for gold, but without success, the invariable "dish "result being"
black sand and garnets." It is not impossible that some of the black sand may
have been stream tin.</p>
<p>5th July.&mdash;The party crossed the Lynd River, here 330 yards wide, near
Camp 5, and struck to the north, through the Kirchner Range, over "quartz
ridges with open forest and good-looking country for gold." In 9 miles a creek
was crossed, which must have been Pinnacle Creek. In 5 miles more Camp 6 was
pitched at a convenient water-hole.</p>
<p>6th July.&mdash;In a mile and a half to the north "a large sandy river" was
crossed and named the Tate. The Tate falls into the right bank of the Lynd
about 20 miles to the west. Four and a half miles further north, the party
struck the head of a creek (Nonda Creek) falling to the north, with high
sandstone ridges on its left bank. The creek was followed to the north for 6
miles and a camp was made at a native well in the bed of the creek, to which
the party were guided by a woman, who carried a child&mdash;the first
aboriginals seen on the journey. Four more were seen later in the day. Camp
7.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 378}</u></p>
<p>7th July.&mdash;Moved camp 3 miles down Nonda Creek (northward) to where
water was plentiful. Camp 8.</p>
<p>8th July.&mdash;Moved 6 miles NNW. down Nonda Creek. Camp 9. (See Map
G.)</p>
<p>9th July.&mdash;Nonda Creek was crossed from the left bank to the right
after it had been followed down for 2 miles NNW. of Camp 9. Four miles north of
the crossing, Hann reached a river, with a sandy bed over a quarter of a mile
wide, which he named the Walsh after the Hon. W. H. Walsh, Minister for Works
and Goldfields. He crossed the river and camped on its north, or right bank.
Camp 10 was about 2 miles down the river from where the Palmerville-Junction
Creek Telegraph Line now crosses. The Walsh River is, no doubt, the creek on
which Kennedy camped on 23rd August, 1848, about 3 miles below the mouth of
Eureka Creek. It drains tin, copper, lead and silver-bearing country extending
from Watsonville in the east to Arbouin in the west, a distance of 80 miles.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>The 10th July was given to prospecting (which was unsuccessful) in the
neighbourhood of Camp 10.</p>
<p>On 11th, 12th and 13th July, Hann, with Taylor and Jerry, rode up the valley
of the Walsh. They appear to have penetrated as far as Mount Redcap, a distance
of about 27 miles to east by south. This conjecture is based not so much on the
diary and accompanying map as on the nature of the country described, which is
exactly such as would be encountered in a journey of the distance and in the
direction indicated. The early part of the journey was marked by mica-schist
rising into hills capped by horizontal sandstone. Towards Redcap were the hills
of magnetic IRON ORE and limestone which became familiar objects to me a few
years later. The party, having recrossed to the right bank of the river,
returned to Camp 10 on 14th July and found "everything safe and in order." A
few natives were seen on this excursion, but they ran away in haste.</p>
<p>On 15th July, the expedition moved 5 miles NW. down the river and camped
(Camp 11) on the right bank of the Walsh opposite what is now the NW. boundary
of Blackdown pastoral run. For the last 2 miles of this stage they had been on
"a limestone formation similar to that on the Barcoo and Upper Flinders": in
fact in the "Rolling Downs" or Lower Cretaceous formation, a collection of
fossils, including Ichthyosaurian vertebrae, was made by Taylor, a few being
carried on and the remainder buried beneath the ashes of the camp fire.</p>
<p>On 16th July, the camp was moved 9 miles NW. down the Walsh, Camp 12. Some
huts were seen during the day and natives</p>

<p>17th July.&mdash;NW. down the right bank of the Walsh. After passing the
site of the modern Walsh Telegraph Station, a watercourse was crossed 3 miles
from Camp 12, and named Elizabeth Creek. This Creek rises about 26 miles to the
east, near the "O.K." Copper Mine. Wrotham Park Cattle Station is about 8 miles
up the creek. Nolan Creek falls into the left bank of Elizabeth Creek, and the
creek which Hann left on 13th July because it was going north and taking him
out of his course, must have been a tributary of Nolan Creek. Camp 13 was on
the right bank of the river (on a reach which runs north) 3 miles NW. of
Elizabeth Creek.</p>
<p>18th July.&mdash;Two miles down the river (north) from Camp 13, a creek
(Louisa Creek) was passed, running westward into the river. Below the mouth of
this creek, the river turned abruptly to the west, and Hann left it and headed
for the north-west. Eight miles from Louisa Creek he crossed a creek (Cassidy
Creek?), and 3 miles further camped on the left bank of Leichhardt's Mitchell
River, which was 300 yards wide. Camp 14.</p>

<h5>(See Map G.)</h5>
<p>FROM Elizabeth Creek onwards, Hann recognised the same formation as that
prevailing on the Barcoo&mdash;in fact the Rolling Downs or Lower Cretaceous,
although he did not know it by either of these names. A large collection of
fossils was made by Taylor and Hann, and these were afterwards determined by
Mr. Robert Etheridge, of the British Museum. Mr. Robert Etheridge, Junior,
gives an account of them in Jack &amp; Etheridge's <i>Geology and Palceontology
of Queensland</i>, p. 393. Hann appreciated the rich land of this district,
which he described as "as fine a piece of pastoral country as any I have seen
in Queensland," and he estimated that there were at least 500 square miles of
it. As a matter of fact, the good country extended much further than Hann could
see, and the whole region between his Camp 10 and the Mitchell is now held as
squatting runs.</p>
<p>Hann made his Camp 14 the base from which he made excursions to determine
the relations of the Walsh and Lynd to THE Mitchell, in which he was perfectly
successful. Accompanied by Warner and Jerry, he rode down the left bank of the
Mitchell to the south-west, and in 8 miles saw the junction of that river with
the Walsh. He gives the latitude as 16&deg; 24' 39" S., the actual latitude,
according to the 4-mile map, being about 16&deg; 31' 30". The "Diary" shows
that the observation made must have been</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 381}</u></p>
<p>of the sun, which would naturally be less reliable than an observation of a
star. (See Map H.)</p>
<p>The Mitchell was then traced down to its junction with the Lynd, where
Leichhardt first struck the Mitchell in 1845, 19 miles west of the mouth of the
Walsh. The latitude of the junction (by a sun observation) is given as 16&deg;
23' S. The modern map makes it 16&deg; 28'.</p>
<p>Hann notes that "the moment the Mitchell joins the Lynd, it enters on the
wretched description of country of the latter, which at the junction bears the
same character as seen by us further up." This refers to the country between
Hann's Camp 2 and Camp 5, which, so far as can be made out from expressions
scattered among phrases condemnatory of the roughness of the "abominable stony
ridges," appears to have consisted of mica and hornblende-schist and granite
with dykes of greenstone and quartz reefs.</p>
<p>Hann further notes that although he had no doubt of the identity of his
river with Leichhardt's Mitchell (and there is no doubt) it was considerably
south of the position assigned to it by Leichhardt's sketch-map. His own
latitude was, however, about 5 miles too far north.</p>
<p>The lower portion of the valley of the Lynd may be country of a "wretched
description," as observed by Hann, but he carried away a wrong impression in
believing that the whole valley was similar to that between his second camp and
his fifth. Leichhardt shows that the granites, gneisses and mica-schists of the
Upper Lynd are replaced in the lower part of the valley by horizontal
sandstones, and under the latter the Rolling Downs Formation is probably
buried. (See Map G.)</p>
<p>Hann's return to Camp 14 was accomplished in two days. From the incomplete
details furnished by the "Diary" and map, the <i>route</i> from the junction of
the Lynd and Mitchell was: NE. 2 miles, E. 12 miles to a lagoon (Camp of 22nd
July), NE. 10 miles, E. 5 miles, SE. 14 miles to the right bank of the Mitchell
and E. up the Mitchell to Camp 14. If my charting is correct the party must
have headed Soda Springs and Lagoon Creeks. All was well at the camp. Early in
the morning of 23rd July a camp of native women and children was seen by the
travellers.</p>
<p>The whole party moved 9 miles NNE. up the Mitchell on 24th July and camped
on the left (south-eastern) bank. Camp 15. The limits of the Lower Cretaceous
area had been passed, as a bar of mica-schist ran across the river at the camp.
On the following day (25th July) the party pushed 8 miles further up the river,
with considerable difficulty owing to the roughness of the country, and camped,
with the object of exploring the upper reaches of the Mitchell before resuming
the journey to the north. Camp 16 must have been about where the telegraph line
now crosses the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 382}</u></p>
<p>river between the "Walsh" Station and Palmerville. Warner made the latitude
16&deg; 16' 59" S., but according to the 4-mile map it is about 16&deg;
22'.</p>
<p>On 27th July, Hann, Taylor and Tate rode 13 miles SE. up the left bank of
the Mitchell and camped. The first 8 miles were on basalt country, in which
agates were found. The next 2 miles were on limestone and the remaining 3 miles
on slate.</p>
<p>To the right of the <i>route</i> the hills rose into a sandstone-capped
tableland which Hann named Taylor's Carboniferous Range. Taylor had already
found <i>Glossopteris</i> and other fragmentary plant remains in a portion of
the range about a mile south of Camp 16. Some years later he kindly wrote for
my use some "Notes on the Geology of Hann's Exploring Expedition." <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> At that time I regarded the whole of the fragmentary
sandstone tablelands as belonging to Daintree's "Desert Sandstone" formation
(Upper Cretaceous). Subsequent observation made it evident that, whatever their
age, Taylor's Range and Mount Mulligan, on the Hodgkinson, were once continuous
and were now only separated by the accident of denudation. The Mount Mulligan
tableland extends for 16 miles from near Woodville, to the confluence of the
Hodgkinson with the Mitchell, a distance of 24 miles. Taylor traced the
Taylor's Range for about 12 miles ESE. from Camp 16. The distance intervening
between where he left off and Mount Mulligan is only 40 miles, and although I
do not know the locality well, I have little doubt that the hill-shading on the
4-mile map passing south of the O.K. Copper Mine correctly indicates the
continuity (with gaps, perhaps) of the two ranges. A seam of COAL is now known
to underlie the whole of the Mount Mulligan tableland, and a railway line from
Dimbula now connects the coal with the copper region. Mr. Lionel Ball, of the
Geological Survey, has established the Permo-Carboniferous age of the Mount
Mulligan beds, <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> and to that age Taylor's Range
must also be referred.</p>
<p>On 28th July, an arduous march of 15 miles was made to the east up the
valley of the Mitchell over "horrible slate country," the slates, "sharp as
knives," proving very severe on the horses. The camp for the night was pitched
east of the pinnacled hills south of Groganville (Anglo-Saxon Gold Mine) and
north of the O.K. Copper Mine. These hills, named "Warner's Peaks" by Hann, now
appear on the maps as "The Pinnacles."</p>
<p>The following day (29th July), an unsuccessful attempt was made to get
better travelling on a south-east course away from the river, but the
"knife-edged slates" drove the party back to</p>

Mining Journal</i>, June, 1909.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 383}</u></p>
<p>the river after 10 miles of very rough country. The camp for the night was
on the left bank.</p>
<p>The slate country having become too rough for the horses, Hann and Tate set
out on foot next day 30th July), and after 7 miles of the roughest walking that
they had ever done (mainly east), reached a hill from which they took their
last view up the valley of the Mitchell, as they supposed, but really of its
tributary the Hodgkinson. A conspicuous mountain, estimated to be about twenty
miles to the S.E., was named Mount Lilley. The distance and bearings given
place this mountain on the divide between the Mitchell and Hodgkinson, north of
the mouth of the "Eastern Hodgkinson."</p>
<p>After walking back to the camp, Hann and Tate took the horses on to the camp
of 28th July. Next day (31st July), the whole party rode back to Camp 16, where
they found everything safe.</p>

<h5>(SEE MAP G.)</h5>
<p>HANN and his companions turned their backs on the Mitchell on 1st August,
1872, and for some distance to the north were favoured with good travelling.
This led to an under-estimation of the distances covered, just as bad
travelling leads to over-estimation. Those tendencies to estimation by
difficulty are a weakness common to all explorers, and allowances have to be
made for it in every case. No amount of experience on the part of a traveller
will eliminate it, and the "fatigue correction" and the "easy-going correction"
have had to be applied to my own estimates as well as to others. In following
Hann from the Mitchell to the Palmer, and comparing his diary and sketch-map
with the modern 4-mile map, the "easy-going correction" is applied freely and
without apology. It may be noted, further, that, especially north of Mount
Mulgrave, the Diary and Report both display some carelessness in giving (or
omitting) bearings and distances, taking into consideration Hann's initial
point at Camp 16 and the point at which he arrived on the Palmer at Camp
20.</p>
<p>Almost from the start at Camp 16 the course was directed towards a
conspicuous mountain (Mount Mulgrave) which bore N. 5&deg; E. Eight miles on
this course. Camp 17 was pitched in a gully falling into the Mitchell through
the medium of "Sandy</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 385}</u></p>
<p>Creek." <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Eight miles further, Camp 18 (2nd
August) was made on the divide between the Mitchell and the Palmer. From the
Mitchell to Camp 18, Hann's <i>route</i> is now followed by the telegraph LINE
from Walsh to Palmerville. The country rises northward from the Mitchell to the
watershed on a gentle grade, the "bottom" being composed of mica-schist, but to
the east of the Telegraph Line, and from Camp 18 to about 5 miles south, this
rock rises abruptly in Mount Mulgrave to about 1,400 feet above the surrounding
country.</p>
<p>On 3rd August, a northerly course was followed for 5 miles and a
north-westerly for 15, over mica-schist country strewn with small quartz stones
which were hard on unshod horses. The last 15 miles appear to have been in the
drainage area of the Twelve Mile Creek, and Camp 19 was pitched on a creek
which Hann named Garnet Creek from the abundance of small garnets in the
washdirt of his unsuccessful prospecting operations in search of gold. Garnet
Creek, from a comparison of Warner's sketchmap with the modern 4-mile map, is
evidently a tributary of the Twelve Mile Creek. Mount Daintree, "a high hill
with perpendicular sides, composed of sandstone and conglomerate resting on
quartzite," lay 3 miles east of the camp. The camp, according to a
sun-observation, is in latitude 15&deg; 51' 59" S., but according to the 4-mile
map is in 15&deg; 58' S.</p>
<p>On 5th August, Hann and Taylor visited Mount Daintree, and after their
return to Camp 19 the whole party moved 3 miles north-westward and camped on a
river which was named the PALMER in honour of Sir Arthur Palmer, Chief
Secretary of Queensland. CAMP 20. The camp must have been about the site of the
subsequent FROME Native Police Station, about 2 miles up the river (east) from
LUKINVILLE, which, a few years later, was for some time a busy centre of
alluvial GOLD-DIGGING. Hann gives the latitude of the camp as 15&deg; 49' 14"
S.; but according to the 4-mile map it is 15&deg; 56'.</p>
<p>It was on the same river, and probably not far from Palmerville, that
KENNEDY camped on 15th September, 1848, when the natives displayed a determined
hostility, burning the grass and attacking his party several times.</p>
<p>A sporting offer of a reward of half a pound of tobacco to the first member
of Hann's party to DISCOVER GOLD had been open for some time, but it was
probable that nothing was needed to whet their appetite for the precious metal.
On 6th August, WARNER claimed and obtained the reward, and other members of the
party followed up the discovery by obtaining "prospects" from all the little
ravines falling into WARNER'S GULLY.</p>
<p>Hann made CAMP 20 the headquarters of the Expedition from 5th to 21st
August, while prospecting operations were vigorously</p>
<blockquote>[1) Maps of Australia are crowded with "Sandy Creeks" ad
nauseam.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 386}</u></p>
<p>carried on. Down the river for 7 miles the prospecting gave only negative
results, and this is remarkable in view of the fact that the site of the
subsequent LUKINVILLE rush must have been passed over. The Lukinville gold was
in the form of fine dust, and for the most part went to reward the industry and
patience of Chinese diggers.</p>
<p>Up the river, the flying party, consisting of Hann, Taylor, Warner and
Jerry, met with more success. The first CAMP was made on 9th August, 5 miles
east of Camp 20 (about north of MOUNT DAINTREE), and further encouraging traces
of GOLD were found. The second CAMP, of 10th August, was 5 miles further up the
river, say at the mouth of the creek on the west side of MOUNT Fox. Here GOLD
was found in the bed of the river. The sight of fresh cattle droppings gave
rise to high hopes of an addition to the supply of meat, but the hunt for the
CATTLE led to nothing. The third CAMP was reached in four hours of travelling
on 12th August, and the distance may be estimated at 10 miles, which would
place the camp about on the site of PALMERVILLE. The latitude is given as
15&deg; 32' 34" S. That of Palmerville, according to the 4-mile map, is 15&deg;
59'. The results of prospecting here were "more flattering than hitherto," and
Hann was now in hopes of being on the right track for discovering a
GOLDFIELD.</p>
<p>On 13th August, a further progress of 12 miles was made up the river, the
men prospecting on the way, with results "more or less favourable" and the
fourth CAMP was probably about the mouth of SANDY CREEK. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> GOLD was found in the river bed at the camp of 13th
August.</p>
<p>On 14th August, the party went 17 miles up the Palmer, cutting off bends of
the river where it was possible to do so. The CAMP of 14th August was about a
mile below the mouth of Granite Creek. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> During
the day, GOLD was found in the bed of the Palmer as well as in ravines on both
sides. About half-way, Hann must have passed the site of MAYTOWN, afterwards
the official centre of the PALMER GOLDFIELD.</p>
<p>On 15th August, leaving Jerry in camp in charge of two horses, one of which
had lost a shoe and been lamed by the sharp slates, Hann and Warner prospected
the river above the camp, again finding GOLD, and afterwards ascended a high
hill, from which a view up the valley gave the impression that the country was
too rough for further progress. This hill, HANN'S FURTHEST EAST, is without
doubt the one which subsequently received the name of MOUNT HANN.</p>
<p>Returning to the camp, preparations for the return journey were</p>
<blockquote>[1) The "Sandy Creek" of the Palmer, not the Sandy Creek of the
Mitchell already mentioned.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) "Granite Creeks" are nearly as common as "Sandy Creeks." Both
belong to a family, which includes Stony Creeks, Oaky Creeks, etc., descriptive
of some characteristic of the creek where it was first met with, and the name
is of no topographical value.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 387}</u></p>
<p>in progress when a party of NATIVES assembled and commenced to burn the
grass. The appearance of the white men did not seem to impress them much, but
as soon as they saw the black boy they retreated in haste. "The most ridiculous
part of the affair," says Hann, "was that they were running in opposite
directions, Jerry for his firelock, the natives for their safety." Hann and his
companions completed the packing and travelled 8 miles down the river, making
their CAMP for the night on a large sandy creek, which they had already
prospected. This creek was the NORTH PALMER RIVER, which afterwards proved very
rich in alluvial GOLD.</p>
<p>Gold was found in the North Palmer on the following morning, l6th August.
The MAIN CAMP, No. 20, was reached in the afternoon. The excursionists were met
by the tidings that in their absence all their fresh meat, in the shape of
SEVEN SHEEP and ONE HORSE, had been lost. The loss was responsible for four
days' delay, which was employed by some of the party in prospecting in the
neighbourhood of the camp, without much success. The sheep were recovered by
Jerry, but not the horse.</p>
<p>On 20th August, Hann visited a camp of NATIVES about a mile from his own,
hoping to learn something about the missing horse, but the men precipitately
fled, leaving the women and children behind.</p>
<p>Hann did not consider that his party had discovered payable gold, and summed
up his operations as "flattering prospects." In reporting the discovery he was
very guarded and deprecated anything in the nature of a "rush." In those days,
indeed, to report PAYABLE GOLD was a serious responsibility, and diggers
returning from an unsuccessful rush were ugly customers for the reporter to
meet.</p>
<p>In this case, however, the hint of gold was enough to set prospectors on the
track, and their success was beyond all expectations. In a few years GOLD TO
THE VALUE OF FIVE AND A HALF MILLIONS STERLING had been won from the Palmer and
its tributaries. Of this amount over 94 per cent, was alluvial gold, only 6 per
cent, coming direct from reefs, chiefly in the neighbourhood of Maytown.</p>

THE whole party left the dep&ocirc;t on the PALMER (CAMP 20) on 21st August,
1872, and steered into the unknown on a course of 30 degrees to the west of
north. The first day's stage, of 15 miles, ended at CAMP 21 on the right bank
of a creek which was flowing to the north. The sandstone cliffs of the
"CONGLOMERATE" RANGE lay on the right of the line of march, another range on
the left being a detached fragment of the same. The head of what is now known
as ANNIE CREEK was crossed a few miles south of Camp 21. Annie Creek flows W.
by S. into the Palmer.
<p>CAMP 22, of 22nd August, was 12 miles N. 30&deg; W. of Camp 21, and on the
same creek. This creek, which, at Camp 22, had "plenty of water," was probably
a tributary of the MOREHEAD RIVER, which falls into Princess Charlotte Bay.
(SEE MAP E.)</p>
<p>On 23rd August, a stage of 16 miles was accomplished to N. 30&deg; W. in
heavy sandy country, the sand resulting from the decomposition of sandstone and
conglomerate. About 7 miles of the day's march was on the divide between the
Pacific and Gulf waters. CAMP 23 was on some small water-holes in a sandy flat,
not far from the creek on which Camps 21 and 22 were situated. (SEE MAP F.)</p>
<p>On the same course, 15&frac12; miles were traversed on 24th August,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 389}</u></p>
<p>and CAMP 24 was pitched on the creek which had been practically followed
down from Camp 21, and which must have been one of the heads of the MOREHEAD
RIVER, which falls into Princess Charlotte Bay. The latitude of Camp 24, by
observation of the sun, was made out to be 15&deg; 4' 14" S. This is about 9
miles too far north. About 3 miles east of the camp was a high sandstone range
to which the name of JESSIE'S TABLELAND was given.</p>
<p>On 26th August, a stage of 14 miles (say 9) was made to CAMP 25, on "a fine
large creek, running south-east, with abundance of fine grass and water for the
horses." This "fine large creek" must have been another of the heads of the
MOREHEAD RIVER.</p>
<p>On 27th August, the course must have been only a few degrees to the west of
north. The distance travelled was estimated at 12 miles. The party for a great
part of it kept on the DIVIDE between the Gulf and Pacific waters, which was
the best travelling, and which appears to have been entirely composed of the
horizontal sandstone, except for a gap between my CROSBIE CREEK, falling
towards the Mitchell and a head of the Morehead River falling towards Princess
Charlotte Bay. Gneiss was observed in this portion of the range, which was
below the level of the base of the sandstone. CAMP 26 was at the junction of a
"large creek running south-west" and a river coming from the north, which was
named the COLEMAN. The creek is now mapped as TEATREE CREEK, and on it, about 4
miles east of Camp 26, is the site of what is now designated the "OLD KALKAH
STATION," which had, of course, not been built in HANN'S time. Hann gives the
latitude of the camp as 14&deg; 45' 59" S., which is 10&frac12; miles too far
north.</p>
<p>Hann spent a day in following his newly discovered COLEMAN RIVER down,
tracing it for 7 miles to the sea. He was satisfied, as it took this course,
that the river was "a Mitchell water." The Palmer River itself, and all the
westward-flowing rivers crossed since the Palmer, are actually tributaries of
the Mitchell, while the Coleman is the first to enter the Gulf independently,
although some of its southern mouths anastomose with northern mouths of the
Mitchell.</p>
<p>Hann and Taylor also visited a hill west of the camp, and found it to
consist of "mica-schist in which garnets were largely imbedded," and numerous
quartz reefs were also seen.</p>
<p>On 29th August, Hann continued his journey northward up the valley of the
COLEMAN RIVER for 13 miles, and camped (CAMP 27) "at a very small hole of bad
water," where "the grass was very bad." The day's stage was "as wretched a
country as one could wish for&mdash;sandy ridges and miserable timber, although
the river itself was prettily fringed with various trees." A NATIVE MAN AND BOY
were surprised. The man levelled a spear at one of the dogs, but the shouting
of the party "checked his evil intentions," and he ran away.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 390}</u></p>
<p>On 30th August, the COLEMAN was found to be going too far east, and was
crossed. Eight miles from Camp 27, a low ridge formed the WATERSHED between the
Coleman and a creek which flowed northward. Here tracks of CATTLE, both old and
fresh, were detected by Jerry. The creek was followed for some distance, to the
north and then to the north-west. Some 18 miles (14, according to Hann, but he
was on "easy travelling") north of Camp 27, CAMP 28 was pitched on burnt
country beside a small creek with "abundance of water." Three NATIVES walked
past the camp in the afternoon "very leisurely and fearlessly." They were
smeared with mud, even on the head, perhaps as a precaution against flies. They
accepted a present of fish-hooks.</p>
<p>Hann was under the impression that the creek he had followed down to Camp 28
was an affluent of the Kendall of the Brothers Jardine, but it must have been
the head of Mulligan's KING RIVER, a tributary of the Coleman. The party was
now within the boundaries of the present HAMILTON GOLDFIELD and only a few
miles east of the YARRADEN TOWN RESERVE.</p>
<p>The lure of FRESH BEEF exacted a day's delay in search of the cattle whose
tracks had been seen, and which must have been the offspring of some of those
lost by Jardine. The search, however, was not rewarded by success. Taylor took
advantage of the delay to visit and ascend MOUNT NEWBERY, the landmark for
which the party had been steering for some time back. The mount is said to have
been "about 2 miles from the camp." The direction is not given, but it was
evidently ahead on the <i>route</i>, and is more likely to have been the hill,
north-east of Yarraden, named MOUNT RYAN than the one east of the head of
Balclatha Creek which is named Mount Newbery in the 4-mile map. It was named
after J. Cosmo Newbery, Chemist to Selwyn's Geological Survey of Victoria.</p>
<p>On 1st September, the journey was continued to the NNW. for about 14 miles
(Hann says 10, but I apply the "easy-going correction"), across a branch of
the HOLROYD on which the VIOLETVILLE Receiving Office is now situated, and then
across RYAN CREEK, another branch of the Holroyd. CAMP 29 was on "a springy
flat with abundance of water," in the neighbourhood of the modern EBAGOOLAH
TOWNSHIP, the centre of the HAMILTON GOLDFIELD. Warner, by a sun-observation,
placed the camp in lat. 14&deg; 13' 4" S., about 6&frac12; miles too far south.
It may be mentioned that a TELEPHONE LINE now connects Ebagoolah Post Office
with the Cape York Telegraph Line, which is 12 miles off at its crossing of the
Stewart River.</p>
<p>On 2nd September, the party headed north, and in 9 miles were on the DIVIDE
BETWEEN THE WATERS OF THE GULF AND THE PACIFIC (which is now the northern limit
of the HAMILTON GOLDFIELD). A descent of 3 miles (mica-schist and gneiss) to
the north-east</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 391}</u></p>
<p>brought them to a river flowing east, which was named the STEWART after one
of the members of the party. CAMP 30. The position of the camp was fixed by a
sun-observation at 14&deg; 2' 34" (about 7 miles too far north). (SEE MAP
C.)</p>
<p>The STEWART RIVER was followed down to the east, in two stages, on 3rd and
4th September. CAMP 31, 10&frac12; miles from Camp 30, was on "a reedy lagoon
running into the river." CAMP 32 was on the right bank about a mile and a half
from the point where the river falls into PRINCESS CHARLOTTE BAY, and was
HANN'S NORTHMOST CAMP. Its latitude was determined to be 13&deg; 59' 49" S.
(about 4 miles too far south).</p>
<p>By this time Harm had become convinced that his observations for latitude
were seriously in error and suspected a derangement of his sextant. The truth
was that, in such low latitudes as he had now reached, observations of the sun,
under the conditions imposed by land travel, could not be expected to give
reliable results, especially as a bucket of water was used for a horizon.</p>
<p>Hann visited the beach and also rode north of the camp for 6 miles, while
the straying of two horses caused delay.</p>
<p>During its brief existence as an alluvial goldfield, parties bound for the
diggings at the "Coen" were content to start from Cooktown, but at a later
date, when gold began to be worked in the parent reefs, PORT STEWART, at the
mouth of the Stewart River, was opened and connected with the Coen township by
a dray road 40 miles in length. The township of MOOJEEBA is situated at the
port.</p>

<h5>(SEE MAP C.)</h5>
<p>HAVING attained his object in reaching the 14th parallel of south latitude,
Hann turned southward on 6th September, 1872, following at first the
south-western shore of PRINCESS CHARLOTTE BAY as closely as the mangroves and
swamps permitted.</p>
<p>CAMP 33 is shown by the sketch-map to be about two-thirds of the distance (6
miles) separating the STEWART RIVER from BALCLUTHA CREEK, i.e., 4 miles south
of the mouth of the Stewart. (SEE MAP E.) The Diary makes it 11 miles.</p>
<p>On 7th September, a creek "with abundance of water" was crossed within a
short distance of Camp 33. This creek is named the BALCLUTHA in the sketch-map.
A HORSE was left behind here. The animal appeared to have been POISONED and a
drink of water at the creek finished him. CAMP 34 was on "a creek with a
little</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 393}</u></p>
<p>muddy water in it." The distance travelled was about 20 miles, and the camp
would be about 14&deg; 24' of south latitude.</p>
<p>On 8th September, a distance of 10 miles was travelled, in a south-easterly
direction. Several lagoons and creeks were passed. One fine lagoon, 6 miles
from Camp 34, was selected as a camping place, but the horses would not look at
the old grass, and the new "burnt feed" was so short that it meant rambling and
semi starvation, and the men, very unwillingly, repacked and went on for 4
miles to a moist teatree flat where there was good feed and where water could
be obtained by digging. CAMP 35 must have been about 2 miles north of the ANNIE
RIVER. It is worthy of note that two SHEEP had come with the party as far as
this camp, where they were lost, but were recovered through the "unerring
eyesight" of the black boy Jerry.</p>
<p>On 9th September, a stage of 10 miles south-east and 2 east was made through
inundable country. At a lagoon, 2 miles from Camp 35, probably on the Annie
River, some NATIVES were met, and fish-hooks were amicably exchanged for a net
and string of native manufacture. CAMP 36 was on "a creek with large
waterholes"&mdash;SALTWATER CREEK, which rises near the Musgrave Station on the
Cape York Telegraph Line.</p>
<p>From the Stewart River to Saltwater Creek, Hann's track coincided with, or
at least was parallel and close to, KENNEDY'S TRACK, Kennedy having crossed the
Annie River on his northward journey on 9th October, 1848.</p>
<p>On 10th September, a march of 2 miles to the east brought the party to the
bank of a large river fringed with clumps of fan palms of immense size and
beauty. CAMP 37 was pitched here, as the Leader was convinced that he was now
on the river seen by Kennedy on 9th October, 1848. KENNEDY'S RIVER was
described by Carron as "deep, and about 100 yards wide, the water salt, and the
banks high." And there is every reason to believe that it was the ANNIE RIVER,
as, according to Carron, it enters Princess Charlotte Bay in 14&deg; 30' S.
lat.</p>
<p>The expedition halted for a day at Camp 37, while Hann and Jerry explored
the lower reaches of the river.</p>
<p>On 12th September, the party followed the river up to the southeast for 14
miles as Hann supposed, but actually for about 10. CAMP 38 was on the left bank
of the river. A day's halt was made here while Hann, Taylor and Jerry rode down
the river, where they met with "several mobs of NATIVES, most of them
friendly," to whom presents of fish-hooks were made. In their absence Warner
made a last attempt to "take the sun," but as the angle could not be read on
the sextant, it was concluded that in future distances would have to be
computed by dead reckoning.</p>
<p>Hann was sorely puzzled by this river. At first he had no doubt that it was
"KENNEDY'S RIVER," and "Kennedy's river" had become</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 394}</u></p>
<p>defined in his mind as the "KENNEDY RIVER" indicated in Carron's sketch-map.
The river seen by Kennedy on 9th October, 1848, was, however, the ANNIE RIVER.
The reach of the river on which Hann was now camped, between his Camps 37 and
38, is now named on the 4-mile map the "NORTH KENNEDY RIVER," and the same name
is given to Therrimburi Creek, a water-course coming from the south and passing
KOOLBURRA STATION; and I have elsewhere suggested the propriety of avoiding the
confusion resulting from the MULTIPLICATION OF "KENNEDY" RIVERS by calling the
whole of this creek THERRIMBURI.</p>
<p>On his return to Camp 38, Hann had come to the correct conclusion that the
river at that camp was "WATER NEVER SEEN BY KENNEDY, it being many miles to the
east of his track." He adds: "As this is a large and remarkable river, and one
discovered by this expedition, I have named it the NORMANBY, after Lord
Normanby, the present Governor of Queensland."</p>
<p>Local usage has fixed beyond recall the name of "KENNEDY" to the river up
which the coach road from the head of the railway, at the Laura, goes to
Maytown, on the Palmer Goldfield. The name must stand, but the river, it must
be understood, is NAMED IN HONOUR OF KENNEDY, although Kennedy never saw it.
The idea that Kennedy came down the river which now bears his name is
sufficiently refuted by Carron's narrative.</p>
<p>Local usage has also attached the name "NORMANBY" to the river crossed by
the COOKTOWN-LAURA RAILWAY between ALDERBURY and BATTLE CAMP stations.</p>
<p>Hann's perplexities arose from the fact that the phenomena of ANASTOMOSING
RIVER MOUTHS which puzzled the Brothers Jardine on the western littoral of the
Peninsula were repeated, on a smaller scale, in the coastal plain south of
Princess Charlotte Bay. Following the rivers from east to west, the NORMANBY is
first joined by the KENNEDY RIVER. The conjoined river, on approaching the Bay,
splits into at least THREE MOUTHS, the eastmost bearing the name of the
NORMANBY on the 4-mile map, a second named the BIZANT, and the westmost named
the NORTH KENNEDY. The NORMANBY, above the branching-off of the Bizant, leaks
into the so-called NORTH KENNEDY.</p>
<p>On 14th September, the expedition followed the river up for 3 miles to the
south-east, when it branched (the western branch being THERRIMBURI CREEK), and
he followed the eastern branch. On the south-east reach of this eastern branch
Hann noted "numerous ALLIGATORS' HEADS all stuck on a sapling tree, but whether
as trophies of the chase or some superstition entertained by the natives with
respect to these animals is unknown. All the other parts of the body appeared
to have been well cleaned, showing no compunctions as far as a feast was
concerned supposing the brutes to have been eaten." Incredible as it may have
appeared</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 395}</u></p>
<p>to Hann, alligator steaks are something of a dainty, as the aboriginals must
have been well aware.</p>
<p>The "eastern branch" which Hann followed was one of the channels by which
the NORM AN BY proper leaks into Therrimburi Creek, the conjoined water-course
forming the mouth of the Normanby which at present (rather unhappily) bears the
name of the "North Kennedy River." After following this channel for 7 miles,
CAMP 39 was pitched on a swamp near the point where the channel leaves the
Normanby proper.</p>
<p>The position of CAMP 41 is fixed by the sketch-map, and subsequent
conversations with Hann and correspondence with Taylor have left me in no doubt
that it was on the NORMANBY RIVER due north of the "Welcome" Station on the
Cooktown-Laura Railway. According to the 4-mile map, the distance between Camps
39 and 41 is 55 miles, and yet Hann's diary relates that this distance was
covered in two stages, of 21 and 8&frac12; miles respectively, leaving
25&frac12; miles unaccounted for. There may have been some carelessness in
making, or error in transcribing the Leader's notes, or, as he had very "easy
going," he travelled faster than he knew and did not apply the necessary
correction. In any case, a journey of 55 miles in two days with a team of
horses that had been so long on the road and living on grass only, was a feat
which speaks eloquently of the care with which the members of the expedition
had "nursed" their riding and baggage animals.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the fact that Hann's diary and map give the
distance between Camps 39 and 41 as 29&frac12; miles, whereas the modern 4-mile
map makes it 55 as the crow flies, the position of Camp 40 is very much in
doubt. It was probably either on Embley's Jack River or his Brown Creek. I am
inclined to decide in favour of the former, which, at all events, Hann must
have crossed, whether he camped on it or not. The total distance (Camp 39 to
Camp 41) covered by Hann, which he divides into two stages of 21 and 8&frac12;
miles, must be proportionately stretched to include the 25&frac12; miles
unaccounted for by him. If I am right, the second day's journey (16th
September} would be 23 miles to CAMP 41 on the NORMANBY. The river here has now
been known for many years, both popularly and officially, as the Normanby, and
has a valley of its own, with no confusion of branches an astomosing with other
rivers or of mouths each claiming to be the "main stream." At Camp 41 it was
running from east to west.</p>
<p>In the course of the day, Hann observed some women and children on a lagoon
fishing with a net. NATIVES were also seen by Tate and Jerry, who were
travelling in the rear of the procession, and TATE BROUGHT A LITTLE BOY INTO
THE CAMP, mounted on the front of the saddle, the boy apparently happy in his
novel experience. "In the afternoon, Jerry and the little boy strolled out
together in search of wild honey, but returned in a short time followed by
a</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 396}</u></p>
<p>mob of EXCITED NATIVES. The white men met the natives, and, after some
'chattering,' neither party understanding the language of the other, the
natives retired, taking the little boy with them, apparently amicable and
satisfied that he had not been kidnapped or had been an unwilling visitor, but
they displayed 'evident signs of triumph.'"</p>
<p>Next morning (17th September), while STEWART AND JERRY were collecting the
horses, they were ATTACKED by two distinct parties of natives, who threw
spears. Stewart drove the horses towards the camp, from which the other white
men sallied to his rescue, firing two shots at long distance. "The effect was
instantaneous; the quick advance was immediately turned into as quick a
retreat."</p>
<p>Having packed up after this incident, the party travelled east-south-east
for 7&frac12; miles, and camped (CAMP 42) at the foot of what is now known as
the BATTLE CAMP RANGE. The name does not, as might be supposed, commemorate the
skirmish of this morning, but a stand made by the natives some two years later
against a party of native police and officials, with prospectors, on the way to
the PALMER GOLDFIELD.</p>
<p>From this range, TAYLOR COLLECTED FOSSILS, two of them identified by the
late Mr. Robert Etheridge, F.R.S., of the British Museum, as belonging to the
genera <i>Ostrea</i> and <i>Hinnites</i>. As both these genera have a wide
vertical range in time, and the specimens do not seem to have been specifically
determinable, the mere identification of the genera does not help in assigning
a firm geological horizon to the strata of the range, which Taylor claimed as
"Carboniferous," and to a wide-spread formation of the same character, whatever
its age may be. The point is of importance, and I have myself searched the
Battle Camp Range on four different occasions without finding the fossiliferous
bed. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> I have always been inclined to regard the
BATTLE CAMP RANGE, and other tablelands which must at one time have been
continuous with it, as part and parcel of Daintree's "DESERT SANDSTONE" (Upper
Cretaceous). In the comparatively low-lying area south of the range which is
now traversed by the Cooktown-Laura Railway, there are sandstones and shales
with thin coal seams, but they have yielded only indistinct plant remains of no
value for palaeontological purposes. These strata are characterised by a great
paucity of fossils, which is in marked contrast to the undoubted
Permo-Carboniferous strata at Deep Creek, Oaky Creek and the Little Kennedy
River. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> At the LITTLE KENNEDY, near Palmerville
(SEE SHEET 18C, 4-MILE MAP), the Permo-Carboniferous formation, which is highly
fossiliferous, coal-bearing and much disturbed, is succeeded unconformably</p>
<blockquote>[1) See <i>Geology and Paleontology of Queensland and New
Guinea</i>, by Robert L. Jack and R. Etheridge, Junior. Brisbane and London,
1892, p. 531.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) <i>Op. cit</i>., p. 533.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 397}</u></p>
<p>by a horizontal cake of sandstone which I believe to be continuous with the
Battle Camp Range and other fragmentary ranges of the district which I have
classed with the Desert Sandstone. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The
question can only be settled on the production of sufficient palaeontological
evidence, read in the light of careful stratigraphical work.</p>
<p>On 18th September, the party travelled 10&frac12; miles south-eastward up
the left bank of the NORMANBY. Crossing the river about 2 miles south of where
the railway now crosses, CAMP 43 was pitched on the right bank. Here they were
little more than a mile from the head of Cook's ENDEAVOUR RIVER (near Alderbury
Railway Station), the DIVIDE BETWEEN THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE BAY WATERS
(Normanby River) AND THOSE OF THE PACIFIC (<i>Endeavour</i> River and Oaky
Creek) being here very close to the right bank of the <i>Endeavour</i>.</p>
<p>On 19th September, after crossing the DIVIDE, on a south-easterly course, a
steep descent led to OAKY CREEK, which was followed eastward to a point 14
miles from Camp 43. CAMP 44 was on the bank of the creek south of CUNNINGHAM'S
RANGE, and about 4 miles west of the modern township of Hamilton. The
prevalence of <i>Casuarina</i> trees led Hann to add one more to the already
intolerably long list of Oaky Creeks. He and Taylor visited the range, which is
composed of horizontal sandstone.</p>
<p>Eight and a half miles further down OAKY CREEK to the east, brought the
party on the following day (20th September} to CAMP 45 between the modern
HAMILTON TOWNSHIP and the junction of Oaky Creek with the ANNAN RIVER, a
distance of about 8 miles.</p>
<p>In 3 miles further eastward down OAKY CREEK, the party found themselves,
early on 21st September, on the left bank of the ANNAN RIVER, into which Oaky
Creek falls, and which here runs northward, although immediately after its
junction with Oaky Creek it turns and flows eastward into the sea. HANN WAS
FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT this river (THE ANNAN) "WAS no other than THE ENDEAVOUR,
of which so much has been said and heard from time to time." To a traveller
approaching the sea from the landward side the MISTAKE was not an unnatural
one, although it would have been impossible for Hann to have made it if he
could have taken his latitude accurately.</p>
<p>Near their mouths, the ENDEAVOUR and the ANNAN both run eastward to the sea
and are only 5 miles apart. A high mountain, MOUNT COOK, lies between the
mouths of the two rivers, and on the northern and north-western foothills of
the mountain the modern town of COOKTOWN is picturesquely situated. Oaky Creek,
above its confluence with the Annan, prolongs the valley of the latter to the
west, parallel to the valley of the ENDEAVOUR, which is now followed by the
railway from Cooktown to Laura.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Op. cit</i>., p. 175.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 398}</u></p>
<p>After leaving his Camp 43, had Hann borne a little to the left he would have
dropped into the valley of the Endeavour instead of into that of Oaky Creek and
the Annan.</p>
<p>Having forded the ANNAN about a mile up (south), Hann followed its windings
down for about 10 miles, and fixed his Camp 46 on some fresh water adjacent to
the mangroves, the river itself having by this time become salt.</p>
<p>On 22nd September, leaving the other members of the party in camp, Hann,
Warner and Nation went 4 miles east till they were in sight of the sea (WALKER
BAY) at the mouth of the river. They observed four NATIVES in a canoe. They
selected a spot where the horses might camp on good water and grass "in the
vicinity of a conspicuous hill on the south side of the river" (WALKER HILL).
Here they came on the remains of a DESERTED FISHING ESTABLISHMENT belonging to
TOWNS &amp; Co. CAMP 47 was settled here next day (23rd September).</p>
<p>Firmly convinced that he was now on the ground where CAPTAIN COOK spent
eleven weeks in 1770, HANN WAS DISAPPOINTED and somewhat soured by his failure
to follow Cook's description. Naturally he "did not discover," as he says, "the
spot used by Captain Cook as a careening ground for his ship." He continues
(see Diary):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"This is an exceedingly pretty place, and it is much
to be regretted that the Endeavour does not hold out prospects for settlement,
but there is nothing on it but its beauty, that we have seen, that would induce
anyone to come to it. The soil is poor, therefore what else would induce people
to come when so many other places within easy communication with civilised
parts are still open? However, I shall follow the river up as far as I can, and
look to its mineral capabilities."</blockquote>
<p>In the Report he remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The bay and its environs are exceedingly pretty;
for a settlement it would be a charming place, being picturesque and compact,
but when this has been said, all has been said. From time to time, the
Endeavour has cropped up as being a wonderful place for many things; amongst
others some fabulous ideas were afloat about its richness in gold. It has
fallen to my lot to dispel these by pronouncing it, in mining phraseology, a
"duffer": it has no gold, no good land, nor anything beyond scenery and its
pretty situation to recommend it."</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, the Admiralty charts already showed that COOK'S HAVEN was NO
CHIMERA, and shipmasters had no difficulty in finding it as soon as a
convenient port for the Palmer Goldfield was called for. Hann's report on the
conclusion of his journey was followed by the start of a prospecting party who
proved the existence of PAYABLE GOLD ON THE PALMER, and the establishment of
the port and the foundation of COOKTOWN were accomplished in the year 1873. In
1877, when I first saw it, the town was a busy centre of distribution and
contained more "first-class hotels" than I dare to say.</p>

<h5>(SEE MAP E.)</h5>
<p>THE journey up the valley of the ANNAN (the supposed <i>Endeavour</i>) RIVER
commenced on 25th September, 1872, after the horses had enjoyed a couple of
days on good grass at the southern end of WALKER BAY. First retracing their
steps to Camp 46, the party struck WSW. and crossed to the left bank of the
ANNAN below the mouth of TREVETHAN CREEK. (SEE MAP G.)</p>
<p>CAMP 48 was on the left or western bank of the ANNAN about 2 miles south of
the creek. The river was hemmed in by ranges on both sides and travelling was
difficult. The day's journey amounted to about 15 miles.</p>
<p>The difficulties of travelling increased next day (26th September). Thirteen
miles (to the south) were gained by following the ANNAN RIVER where it was
possible and climbing the hills, sometimes by dangerous "sidelings," where the
valley was too rough.</p>
<p>SCRUBBY CREEK was crossed, falling into the left bank, and MUNGUMBY CREEK,
falling into the right. A casual allusion, in</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 400}</u></p>
<p>the Diary, to "a spur from MOUNT COOK" coming down to the right bank shows
that Hann took the mountain mass east of the Annan for Mount Cook, instead of
the isolated hill between the mouths of the Annan and <i>Endeavour</i>. Some
POISONOUS HERBAGE had been eaten by Hann's best mount, which died at the camp.
Two other horses appear also to have partaken of the poison, and were not
considered out of danger for at least three days and were not fit for work for
some weeks.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that some years later, the ANNAN VALLEY and the mountain
mass lying between it and the sea, including MOUNT THOMAS and MOUNT AMOS,
produced a considerable quantity of tin oxide, of which the greater part was in
the form of STREAM TIN. A dredging scheme has lately been set on foot with the
object of recovering stream tin from the lower reaches of the river.</p>
<p>CAMP 49, of 26th September, appears to have been on high ground between
WALLABY CREEK and BAIRD'S CREEK, tributaries of the Annan's right bank.</p>
<p>On 27th September, the day opened with something of the nature of a
war-dance by NATIVES on a hill, but the "demonstration" was not followed up by
any hostile act. Much time was spent, and lost, in following old tracks of
natives, in the hope that these would lead to a way out of the "steep mountains
and dense scrub." A progress of 5 miles to the south was the gross result of a
day of severe toil. CAMP 50 was on the left bank of the ANNAN, about 15&deg;
49' S. latitude.</p>
<p>On 28th September, the party climbed up the valley of the ANNAN, partly in
the rough bed of the river and partly over steep slopes covered with dense
scrub, and appears to have reached a point very near the head of the river in
about 3 miles to the south-east. CAMP 51.</p>
<p>From the HEAD OF THE ANNAN (which, it must be remembered, Hann called the
<i>Endeavour</i>) to the mouth of the BLOMFIELD RIVER, in Weary Bay, the path
had literally to be hewn foot by foot through a dense jungle which covered
steep and dangerous slopes. A general south-eastward course was kept, but many
deviations were forced on the travellers by the nature of the country. CAMPS
52, 53 and 54, of 29th September and 1st and 2nd October, appear to have
represented gains of 3, 2, and 2 miles respectively. Frightful risks were
taken. In one place a horse fell on a "knife-edge ridge," and must have been
killed if the ground had been clear; but the trees were close enough together
to save him from death. Another horse rolled over no less than four times
before he could regain his footing.</p>
<p>The mouth of the BLOMFIELD RIVER was safely reached on 2nd October, but in
this region the shore of the Pacific affords no footing for travellers. Some 12
miles south of Weary Bay, MOUNT</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 401}</u></p>
<p>PETER BOTTE rises to the height of 3,311 feet, and slopes steeply down to
Captain Cook's "CAPE TRIBULATION."</p>
<p>The BLOMFIELD RIVER, which is barely 30 miles long, reaches the Pacific on a
north-easterly course. Hann's idea was, without crossing this river, to follow
it up in the hope that it would take him some way on his course, and lead him
into better country. The word "country" is used here as Hann regarded it from
his point of view, that is, country fit to travel over. As "country," from an
agricultural point of view, the Blomfield is good enough. Its cleared scrub
land, in the present day grows SUGAR-CANE and is a valuable asset of the
State.</p>
<p>CAMP 55 was pitched on the left bank of the BLOMFIELD on 3rd October.</p>
<p>The river, indeed, followed a course which would have taken the expedition
for some distance south, had it been possible to follow it. The banks, however,
were so steep and so scrubby that it became necessary to leave it at Camp 55,
and take to the hills.</p>
<p>It would be unprofitable, even if it were possible, to follow minutely the
daily record of Hann's wanderings in the SCRUB. His one idea was to GET AWAY
SOUTH, and to this end he and his companions toiled, and struggled day after
day. Paths were laboriously hewn through the jungle and the horses were led on;
and as often as not it was labour lost, as some insurmountable obstacle would
force them back on their tracks, or round in a direction that was not at all to
their liking Until he tackled the Annan (which he called the <i>Endeavour</i>),
Hann, looking back, forgot all his previous troubles, and declared that "THE
EXPEDITION HAD BEEN A PLEASURE TRIP." He added that SINCE CROSSING THE
Endeavour (ANNAN) "there have been NOTHING BUT TROUBLES AND DIFFICULTIES, with
still more ahead, and how they will end remains to be proved." Above all, there
was no time for anything like careful charting. Already on the second day from
Camp 55 (5th October) Hann had LEFT THE waters of the BLOMFIELD BEHIND and was
on those of the DAINTREE RIVER, without knowing it. The course of the DAINTREE
was at that time unknown to him and all the world, and as for landmarks, he
might as well have been travelling through a dark tunnel. The DAINTREE RIVER
was discovered and named after Richard Daintree, then Agent-General for
Queensland, formerly Government Geologist, by G. Elphinstone Dalrymple in 1873.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> On the fourth day (7th October) his CAMP 59
was on the "WEST NORMANBY," one of the heads of the river which he had himself
named, but he never suspected the fact. By this time he had gained, from Camp
55, at most 4 miles of the desired southing and something like 23 miles of
westing. Probably the actual distance travelled was not less than 40 miles.</p>
<p>The party had hardly gone a mile west of Camp 59, on 8th</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Queensland North Coast Expedition</i> of 1873, par.
436.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 402}</u></p>
<p>October, when they saw in front of them the "main range," the</p>
<p>WATERSHED BETWEEN THE GULF AND THE PACIFIC. To their eyes</p>
<p>it appeared "a perfect barrier to further progress." It may be remarked that
at a later date the perseverance of prospectors was rewarded by the discovery
of at least two passes through this part of the range, by which tracks were
made to give access to the GOLD-DIGGINGS of the UPPER PALMER; but Hann did not
wait to seek for passes. After consultation with the other members of his
party, he decided to make another attempt to reach the coast. The course was
altered to south and south-east, and after a day's march of 13 miles, "equal to
30 on level ground," CAMP 60 was pitched on "a creek among the ridges."</p>
<p>On 9th October, only 2 miles were made, to ESE., and the party camped, as
Hann supposed, on the Blomfield River, but probably on ADELINE CREEK, a
tributary of the DAINTREE. CAMP 61.</p>
<p>On 10th October, the march continued to the south-south-east for 4 miles to
CAMP 62. The head of the DAINTREE must have been crossed. A SNAKE 16 feet long
was shot, and Jerry enjoyed a full meal after his own heart, in which the white
members of the party gladly shared.</p>
<p>The expedition moved forward about 4 miles to the south-east on 11th
October, and CAMP 63 was pitched on a scrubby creek, with plenty of water,
which, however, could not be reached by the thirsty horses because of the
steepness of the banks. Hann and Jerry had gone ahead of the party when they
met a party of very FRIENDLY NATIVES, from whom it was hoped information could
be obtained regarding a way to the sea. The natives accompanied Hann and Jerry
on their return to Camp 63. Here the Leader found, to his annoyance, that
Taylor, who had been put in charge, refused to accept such a responsibility for
the future, as Tate had "entered into a warm altercation with him."</p>
<p>After the midday meal at the camp, Hann started out to explore, accompanied
by Nation and Jerry and two of the friendly natives to act as guides. In 3
miles they reached the summit of a ridge to the south-east, and wished to
proceed further in the same direction. The "guides" disapproved, pointed in
another direction, and finally slipped away. It soon became apparent that the
guides had been in the right. "At our feet," says Hann, "lay miles of thick and
IMPENETRABLE SCRUB, covering ridges and gullies alike; to have ventured into
it, with or without horses, would have been sheer madness, as the sea lay miles
away not even in sight. The prospect was worse than anything seen by us
hitherto. CAPE TRIBULATION and the country for miles around its base was a sea
of scrub, which extended as far as our vision in a southerly direction. We
turned away from the prospect with a dismal sensation of DISAPPOINTMENT, as we
had hopes that this was our way out&mdash;whereas, it proved a gate shutting us
in more</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 403}</u></p>
<p>completely than ever. But still there was one other hope, and that was the
road indicated by the natives, so we buoyed ourselves up for another trial and
returned to camp."</p>
<p>On 12th October, Hann started early, accompanied by Tate, Stewart and Jerry,
with a native "guide." In 3 miles to the south-east a site was selected for
CAMP 64. Stewart was sent back to bring on the expedition to this point, and
the others penetrated about 6 miles further to the south-east, and got on a
high hill.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Our doom is sealed," says Hann. "All further
progress south is debarred us, and the retreat to the westward has become
imperative; it is now a case of personal safety...I saw at once how completely
I was frustrated in my desire to reach the coast, which, if I had reached,
would have wrecked the expedition. From this eminence I had a view of the whole
country beneath me. Towards the sea stretched miles of broken country densely
covered with scrub of an impenetrable character. To the south, the DIVIDING
RANGE towered to an immense height, forbidding approach, and also covered with
scrub, which seemed to spread over the whole country. The range ended abruptly
over the sea, and as far as I could discern, maintained the same character
south, as far as visible. Here my last hope vanished, and I descended the hill
with a feeling of disappointment exceeded by [exceeding] anything I had felt
the previous day when I found my first road was shut against me. I have
STRUGGLED HARD, BUT TO NO PURPOSE; all my endeavours have been frustrated by
the completely impassable nature of the country for white men with
horses."</blockquote>
<p>The guide slunk off. Jerry had been told by an old man, one of the "friendly
natives," that there was no possibility of reaching the sea; that they
themselves reached it by CANOES, which came up salt-water creeks to within a
few miles of the camp. The navigable channel thus indicated must have been the
DAINTREE RIVER.</p>
<p>It was by the favour of God that HANN HAD THE WISDOM TO ADMIT HIS DEFEAT.
Had he been endowed with the unbending pertinacity, or obstinacy, of Kennedy,
he would have gone on at all risks, to perish with his whole party. His dilemma
was now a sharp-horned one indeed. The formidable character of the westward
<i>route</i> had already decided him to TRY THE COAST, which was found to be
impossible, and the difficulties of the WESTWARD ROUTE had by this time been
seriously aggravated. On a deliberate review of the situation, these
difficulties resolved themselves into the physical weakness of some members of
the party, worn out with fatigue and faced with inevitable scarcity of food,
and the leg-weary condition of the horses and the chances of drought and want
of grass. Nevertheless, the WESTWARD RETREAT was the lesser of two evils, and
no other course was now open.</p>
<p>On Hann's return to CAMP 64, it was reported to him that the "friendly
natives" had given annoyance by pilfering.</p>
<p>While traversing these scrubs, Jerry described a CLIMBING KANGAROO which he
had seen in the Cardwell district, and showed Hann and Tate trees bearing the
marks of the ascent of some such</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 404}</u></p>
<p>animal. Although they did not see the animal itself, which was then unknown
to science, its subsequent discovery places beyond doubt the accuracy of
Jerry's information and description.</p>
<p>It may be remarked that the "MAIN RANGE" which Hann saw towering "to an
immense height" contains mines of TIN and of the rarer minerals WOLFRAM,
MOLYBDENITE and BISMUTH.</p>

<h5>(SEE MAP G.)</h5>
<p>BITTERLY chagrined over their failure to travel southward by the east coast,
the party left CAMP 64 on 14th October, 1872. RETRACING THEIR STEPS through the
scrub, CAMP 60 was passed on the third day (16th October) and the party struck
west, shortly afterwards getting clear of the scrub and crossing a divide of
"dry and hard-looking ridges," with a steep ascent. CAMP 65 was on a creek,
which Hann correctly surmised to be within the drainage area of the NORMANBY.
It was, in fact, FLAT CREEK, which runs westward to join the "WEST
NORMANBY."</p>
<p>Next morning (17th October), as Stewart and Jerry were hunting for a mare
which had strayed, some NATIVES yelled at them from a distance. This day's
march was 10 miles down FLAT CREEK</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 406}</u></p>
<p>to the west and then northward down the WEST NORMANBY. CAMP 66. Gins and
children were surprised at the camp. Their camp contained several pieces of
iron, one a rod used as a yam-stick. After dark, during Tate's watch, he heard
BLACKS prowling about the camp. On his firing a shot they ran away howling,
their flight being accompanied by the rattling of SPEARS.</p>
<p>On 18th October, a progress of 10 miles to the north was made down the WEST
NORMANBY. CAMP 67 was probably not more than 6 miles west of Camp 59.</p>
<p>Leaving the WEST NORMANBY on 19th October, a basalt ridge was met with in 2
miles. The country from Oaky Creek to this point had been entirely of slate.
The BASALT continued for the remaining. 13 miles of the day's march to the
north-west. From the point where the basalt was first seen, the party had been
on the head-waters of the LAURA. Hann named the branch which he followed, the
HEARN <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> (the name of his wife's family) and
camped (CAMP 68). He believed it to be the Kennedy.</p>
<p>The river (the Laura) still running to the north-west, with the dividing
range&mdash;which he judged to be impassable&mdash;a few miles to the left,
Hann followed it next day (20th October) for 9 miles to CAMP 69. The country
passed over was "stony and broken quartz ridges," with basalt on the right
hand. Rain fell at night, for the first time during the journey.</p>
<p>On 21st October, Hann very unwillingly pursued his way DOWN THE LAURA for 9
miles further to the north-west. CAMP 70 was "close under a range of
SANDSTONE." The leader was most anxious to find a pass through the range and
get away south, but was satisfied that "the horses could not climb these
precipices." <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<p>Six miles from Camp 69, while Hann rode ahead of the party, he "came," as he
relates, "upon a NATIVE, who at first ran away, but shortly returned with his
friends, who began to shout and gesticulate and brandish their SPEARS." He
continues: "I rode away to join my party without paying any attention to them.
In 1&frac12; miles...the NATIVES again made their appearance and began to yell
at us, all being armed with SPEARS. I now thought it necessary to disperse
them, so four of us dismounted from our horses and advanced towards them. When
one of our party went to within 80 yards of the mob, one native made himself
more conspicuous than the rest by preparing his spears for an onslaught, but a
BALL fired in amongst them had the desired effect, for they all ran away
without looking behind. This was all I wanted. I had no wish to have these
fellows hovering about the neighbourhood,</p>
<blockquote>[1) Hann's name ought to stand, by undoubted right of priority, but
the name of Laura, applied later, during the Palmer rush, has become too firmly
fixed by usage, especially since the "Laura" became a railway terminus, to be
altered now.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) In the beginning of 1875, the portion of the Hearn or Laura
valley which had been followed down by Hann was already occupied as a fattening
run for cattle. <i>Expedition in Search of Gold and other Minerals in the
Palmer Districts, by Mulligan and Palmer.</i> Brisbane, by Authority, 1876, p.
1.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 407}</u></p>
<p>watching every chance to pilfer, or prowl about our camp at night."</p>
<p>Rain on the following day (22nd October) kept the party from travelling, and
the day's "spell" was good for the horses.</p>
<p>On 23rd October, the valley of the LAURA was followed down for 2&frac12;
miles. On the river turning to the west (with precipitous SANDSTONE HILLS on
both sides), the party turned south-west and, after travelling for 7 miles over
SANDSTONE AND CONGLOMERATE, camped on a little water-hole. CAMP 71.</p>
<p>On 24th October, the party marched 11 miles to WNW., when they came on a
large river. This was the MOSMAN RIVER, which falls into the LAURA RIVER, 8
miles to the north-east, at what is now the terminus of the COOKTOWN-LAURA
RAILWAY. Hann now came to the conclusion that all the waters he had followed or
crossed between his 67th camp and the Mosman belonged to the NORMANBY, and not
to the Kennedy, to which he had been assigning them. THE MOUTHS OF THE NORMANBY
AND KENNEDY, as already pointed out, ANASTOMOSE; but their upper valleys are
distinct, and Hann had arrived at the truth in his latest surmise.</p>
<p>Having crossed the MOSMAN, a march of 8 miles brought the party to "a large
running creek, with fine feed for the horses." This was the LITTLE LAURA, which
falls into the Laura 10 miles north of the present railway terminus. CAMP 72,
which was in sandstone country, was probably on the left bank.</p>
<p>On 25th October, the course for the first 6 miles was a little to the south
of west, when a SANDSTONE CLIFF forced the party 2 miles to the north. A narrow
gap in the cliff was at length found, and by this the horses made the ascent
with great difficulty and danger. On the top of the sandstone, the head of a
creek was found and followed to the west for 6 miles to CAMP 73. This creek was
the head of the ST. GEORGE RIVER, which joins the Kennedy River, <i>de
facto</i>, above the "Kennedy Bend," the terminus of my first, and
starting-place of my second, expedition in 1879.</p>
<p>On 26th October, the ST. GEORGE'S RIVER was followed westward for 7&frac12;
miles to CAMP 74, at its junction with the LITTLE KENNEDY RIVER, where at the
present day the road and telegraph line run southward to Palmerville.</p>
<p>To solve their doubts as to whether or not they had now crossed the divide
into western waters, Hann and Taylor ascended a hill near the camp, and the
latter recognised, on looking southward, some remembered features of the
Palmer. They concluded therefore that they were still on eastern waters, and
that Camp 74 was on the KENNEDY. It was, in fact, on an eastern head of the
RIVER NAMED IN HONOUR OF KENNEDY. A tributary valley was seen coming from the
south towards the camp.</p>
<p>Up the creek which forms the tributary valley, and to which the name of the
LITTLE KENNEDY RIVER is now applied, Hann and</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 408}</u></p>
<p>his companions travelled 5 miles southward to CAMP 75 on 27th October. The
camp was on the site of the present FAIRLIGHT Cattle Station. The LITTLE
KENNEDY has a longer course than the ST. GEORGE, although the conjoined stream
bears the latter name until it falls into the Kennedy proper.</p>
<p>On 28th October, 11 miles to the south, up the LITTLE KENNEDY, brought the
party to the summit of the DIVIDE, from which Hann could see MOUNT MULGRAVE and
other familiar landmarks. A pass so narrow that the horses had to travel in
single file led down into the valley of the PALMER. The river was reached in a
mile and a half from the summit, and CAMP 76 was pitched on its bank, opposite
the mouth of GLENROY CREEK, between the camp of 10th and 10th August and that
of 12th August.</p>
<p>Hann was now on well-known ground. He steered south on 30th October for the
east side of MOUNT MULGRAVE, at the south end of which he fixed his CAMP 77. He
estimates the distance travelled at 17 miles, whereas it cannot have been less
than 22, which shows the necessity for the "easy-going" correction.</p>
<p>On 31st October, 12 miles brought the party to the MITCHELL RIVER, on the
right bank of which CAMP 78 was pitched, opposite the old Camp 16.</p>
<p>On 1st November, the party travelled 21 miles south by west to ELIZABETH
CREEK, on which CAMP 79 was made. The day's journey was on the track now
followed by the TELEGRAPH LINE from the Walsh to the Palmer. The first 3 miles
were BASALT, to which succeeded 3 miles of sandy flat, and the remainder of the
journey was on a LIMESTONE formation. This bore, says Hann, "some of the finest
soil conceivable, the same as noted by me on the outward trip."</p>
<p>An old HORSE, which had been failing ever since, with some others, it had
been POISONED on the Annan on 26th September, could be driven no further, and
was left behind at this camp. Great hauls of FISH were made in the Palmer and
Mitchell.</p>
<p>The camp was moved 3 miles south on 2nd November to an ideal spot for grass
and water for the horses. CAMP 80 was on the site of the modern WALSH TELEGRAPH
STATION, and about 2 miles north of Camp 12 of Hann's outward journey.</p>
<p>The right bank of the WALSH was followed up for about 12 miles on 3rd
November, and CAMP 81 was between the former camps Nos. 11 and 12. A further
search was made for FOSSILS, as the camp was where a collection had been made
on the outward trip, but nothing new was found, and those which had been hidden
in a cache had been spoiled by exposure to water.</p>
<p>Still following the right bank of the WALSH for 9 miles, CAMP 82 was fixed
next day (4th November) about 3 miles south-east of Camp 10, and at or near the
present crossing of the TELEGRAPH LINE.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 409}</u></p>
<p>Having crossed the WALSH about a mile south-east of the camp of 5th
November, the travellers immediately got among scrubby SANDSTONE HILLS, which
they cleared in 6 miles. They apparently travelled southward, east of MULDOON
CREEK and west of the ARBOUIN COPPER MINES.</p>
<p>As soon as they got clear of the sandstone hills, the party followed MULDOON
CREEK to its head, and 22&frac12; miles from Camp 82, camped at sunset on the
DIVIDE between the Walsh and the Tate. (SEE MAP K.) At CAMP 83 there was no
water. The TELEGRAPH LINE and road from the Walsh to the Tate now follow Hann's
track of this day.</p>
<p>On 6th November, Hann continued his journey to the southeast and struck the
TATE RIVER in 8 miles. He then followed the right bank, on the same course, for
2 miles, and, at what is now the TATE RIVER TELEGRAPH STATION, crossed to the
left bank and camped on "splendid feed for the horses." CAMP 84.</p>
<p>The windings of a tributary of the Tate were followed up for 11 miles to the
south-east on 7th November. The actual distance gained to the south-east
appears to have been about 6 miles, but something must be allowed for the
windings and also for the "fatigue" correction. There was "fine grass for the
horses" at CAMP 85. Hann was of opinion that the country traversed was "most
promising-looking for gold," in fact, "the best-looking country seen by us
yet." So far as I am aware, no gold has yet been discovered on Hann's actual
<i>route</i> (Camp 84-85), but it is interesting to note that the FISCHERTON
mining camp, the centre of the TATE RIVER MINERAL FIELD, is only a few miles to
the east. LODE TIN and WOLFRAM are worked in this neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Five miles south-east of Camp 85, a hill, which was named MOUNT McDEVITT,
was left on the right on 8th November. The course was then altered to south by
east, the first 3 miles being over granite ridges. Three miles more over flat
sandy country brought the party to "a shallow creek," probably PANDANUS CREEK,
where CAMP 86 was pitched. Heavy rain fell during the night.</p>
<p>On 9th November, the right bank of the LYND RIVER was reached in 6 miles.
Two miles further east, the river was crossed, and the outward track was

station, which may be called CAMP 88, is only 5 miles down the brook from
FOSSILBROOK STATION, the starting-point of 26th June.</p>

Works and Goldfields. CAMP 90. This telegraph station has now been removed to

<p><b>SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>HANN'S CONTRIBUTION TO GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE of the Cape York Peninsula was
of equal importance to that of any of his predecessors.</p>
<p>Commencing on the river named the LYND by LEICHHARDT he followed it down to
the north-west for 30 miles. Sixteen miles to the north he found a new river
which he named the TATE, a tributary of the Lynd. Twenty-eight miles to the
north he found and named the WALSH RIVER, a tributary of the Mitchell. He
traced the Walsh for 45 miles till it fell into the MITCHELL, and thence
followed the Mitchell itself westward for 30 miles to the junction of the LYND,
joining lines at this point with LEICHHARDT. He also traced the Mitchell up
from the junction of the Walsh for 60 miles to the east, almost to its
confluence with the Hodgkinson River. The PALMER RIVER was next found about 30
miles north-west of the Mitchell. This important tributary of the Mitchell must
have been crossed by KENNEDY, who, however, left no record. Struck by its
auriferous capabilities, Hann explored the Palmer for 50 miles to the east.
From the Palmer (near Lukinville) he then travelled north-westward for 80
miles, to a new Gulf river which he named the COLEMAN, the greater part of the
journey from the Palmer to the Coleman having been on or near the WATERSHED OF
THE PENINSULA. He traced the COLEMAN down for a few miles till it began to run
westward and northward for 20 miles to its head.</p>
<p>Pursuing his northward course, almost on the watershed of the Peninsula,
Hann in 40 miles struck a river which he named the STEWART and identified as
one crossed by KENNEDY. This river he followed down to the east for 30 miles
till it discharged into PRINCESS CHARLOTTE BAY.</p>
<p>Having reached the latitude of 14 degrees south and thus completed the task
which he had set before himself, Hann now turned homeward. South of Princess
Charlotte Bay he was inevitably mazed by the ANASTOMOSING OF THE MOUTHS OF THE
yet-uncharted KENNEDY, MOREHEAD AND NORMANBY RIVERS. From one of these mouths,
which he named the NORMANBY, he then marched south-east</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 411}</u></p>
<p>for 50 miles, striking, near the BATTLE CAMP RANGE, the river now known as
the NORMAN BY which here runs in a valley of its own. After following the
valley up for 22 miles, he turned his back on its right bank and found himself
in a few miles on a watershed in which the Endeavour River and a branch of Oaky
Creek rise close together, to flow eastward to the Pacific over beds only a few
miles apart. He MISSED THE ENDEAVOUR by only a mile or two, and ran down OAKY
CREEK for 20 miles to the east, when it fell into a RIVER which came from the
south and then turned east. His next procedure was to follow this river for
about 8 miles to its mouth in WALKER BAY, firmly convinced that it was the
ENDEAVOUR, although he was unable to reconcile his surroundings with CAPTAIN
COOK'S description. The river, in fact, was distinct, its mouth being about 6
miles south of that of the <i>Endeavour</i>, and is now known as the ANNAN.</p>
<p>Having observed that the ANNAN came from the south, and his objective lying
in that direction, Hann gladly embraced the opportunity of FOLLOWING THE RIVER
(the supposed <i>Endeavour</i>) TO ITS HEAD. He succeeded, indeed, in this, but
only in the face of great difficulties with tangled scrub, and dropped down on
the mouth of the BLOMFIELD RIVER, in WEARY BAY.</p>
<p>The course of the BLOMFIELD again promised a means of getting away to the
south, but the rugged and precipitous nature of its bed and valley soon forced
the explorers to climb the hills above the left bank. The increasing density of
the scrub and roughness of the SCRUB-MASKED COUNTRY, however, made southerly
progress impossible for a time. It was not till they had hewn their way 30
miles to the east, and were actually (although without knowing it) on the
head-waters of the NORMAN BY, and within a few miles of the head of the PALMER,
that it became possible to get away to the south-east, in which direction they
HOPED TO REACH THE EAST COAST and find better travelling. With infinite toil
some 40 miles were gained to the south-east, and as the travellers heard from
natives of the only way to reach the sea being by canoes, they were probably
not far from the lower reaches of the DAINTREE RIVER. At this point, Hann bowed
to the inevitable, and resolved to RETRACE HIS STEPS as far as he had come to
the south-east. But for this wise and timely decision there is no doubt that
the expedition would have perished in the jungle.</p>
<p>Having regained to the north-west the 40 miles lost in the attempt to reach
the sea, Hann crossed the valley of the WEST NORMAN BY and, continuing
north-west, followed the LAURA RIVER (which he named the HEARN) down from its
head for 40 miles, not very sure whether it was a "western water," or whether
the apparently impenetrable range on his left was or was not the watershed of
the Peninsula. The LAURA, as is now known, is a tributary of the NORMAN BY.
When at last it became possible to go west-south-west,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 412}</u></p>
<p>this course was followed for 40 miles, crossing the MOSMAN and the LITTLE
LAURA, both tributaries of the Laura, and the "LITTLE KENNEDY" was met with.
The valley of this river, coming from the south, offered a practicable course
in the desired direction, and 15 miles of good travelling brought the party to
a gap in the "GREAT DIVIDING RANGE," from which their eyes rested with
satisfaction on familiar landmarks in the valley of the PALMER.</p>
<p>Having descended to and crossed the PALMER, Hann struck south, and reached
the MITCHELL in 35 miles. The WALSH was reached in 23 miles more to the south
and followed (by the outward track) for 28 miles to south-south-east.</p>
<p>From the Walsh, a course was followed to south-south-east. The TATE was
crossed at the site of the modern TATE TELEGRAPH STATION, some 13 miles above
the outward track. The LYND was met with, on the same course, in about 25
miles, and after crossing that river, the outward track was retraced to the
south, up FOSSIL BROOK to the starting-point of the expedition, which was
reached on 10th November, 1872.</p>
<p>Hann's expedition, no doubt, owed a good deal to the fine weather which
prevailed all the time it was in the field, but its successful issue was mainly
due to the superior bushmanship of the Leader. It resulted in important
economic developments, as it revealed the existence of an immense area of "GOOD
COUNTRY," the pastoral occupation of which quickly followed the publication of
the report. The indication of the presence of GOLD led the way to the opening
of the PALMER GOLDFIELD, with its far-reaching influence on the settlement of
Northern Queensland. Finally, the discovery of the TATE and WALSH Rivers
attracted a swarm of prospectors, who opened out RICH MINERAL AREAS a few years
later,</p>
<p>William Hann was drowned while bathing in the sea, at Townsville, on 5th
April, 1889. Thomas Tate now (1920) resides at Peak Vale, near Clermont.</p>

<p>HANN'S FIRST REPORT was made by telegraph from Junction Creek on 12th
November, and a complete report, accompanied by a map and diary, was dispatched
from his home at Maryvale on 20th December, 1872. These documents were
published in Brisbane as Parliamentary Papers early in 1873.</p>
<p>The reported occurrence of gold over a wide area on the Palmer attracted the
attention of miners, ever on the alert for the first hint of a new discovery,
and the conviction grew that although mere "cattle men" like Hann and his
companions might not consider the gold to be payable, skilled prospectors might
follow it up to an EL DORADO.</p>
<p>Several parties of prospectors set out without loss of time and were soon
distributed over the new field. Among these were JAMES VENTURE MULLIGAN, and
his companions, viz., Albert Brandt, James Dowdell, David Robinson, Peter
Abelson, Alexander Watson and Peter Brown, who left the Etheridge Goldfield on
5th June, 1873. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>A prospector is an explorer in every sense of the word (one is tempted to
add "only more so"), but the circumstances surrounding his calling make for the
concealment of the results of his labour up to a certain point. Let him "drop
on a good patch of gold" and he naturally settles down to put the gold in his
pocket with the least possible delay. It is true that by giving early
notice</p>
<blockquote>[1) See <i>Petition to Parliament. Queensland Votes and
Proceedings, Session 1874.</i> Vol. II, p. 755, and Heaton's <i>Australian Men
of the Time</i>, 1879.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 414}</u></p>
<p>of his discovery he may ultimately secure the standing reward, but he will
do so at the cost of giving away his valuable secret, and will soon be
surrounded by a crowd of diggers who will peg out claims and thus confine him
to a limited area. If he can escape detection, he may make more in a week than
the reward is worth. At any time, however, he may be tracked or accidentally
detected in the act of amassing wealth, and in that case other gold seekers
will deprive him of elbow-room, and may forestall him in applying for the
reward. The successful prospector is thus always on the horns of a dilemma: to
work on in secret and risk it, or to report payable gold.</p>
<p>After the discovery of payable gold on the Palmer had been publicly
announced by Mulligan, other prospectors put forward their claims to the
honour, in some instances giving accounts of their travels and doings. Such
accounts, however, were for the most part contributed to the daily or weekly
newspapers of the "seventies," in some cases to newspapers now defunct. Such
publications rank as "fugitive literature," which no man may hope to marshal in
evidence after the lapse of forty years. Mulligan's first explorations on the
Palmer (1873-4) were no exception. His reports were contributed to the
<i>Queenslander</i> newspaper, and would have shared the oblivion which has
overtaken the reports of his contemporaries and rivals but for the circumstance
that they were collected and reprinted in a Guide Book <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> in 1875. This guide book is very rare at the present
day, but fortunately a copy has been preserved in the Mitchell Library, Sydney,
and to this I am indebted for the text of the notes which follow.</p>
<p>GEORGETOWN, the centre of the ETHERIDGE GOLDFIELD, was, in 1873, connected
with Firth's Station, MOUNT SURPRISE, by a road, about 85 miles in length. (SEE
MAP K.) Mulligan covered this journey (eastward) in four days, arriving at
Mount Surprise on 9th June, 1873. His <i>route</i> from MOUNT SURPRISE
<i>via</i> FOSSIL BROOK to its junction with the LYND diverged but little from
that of Hann. Nearly on the footprints of both LEICHHARDT and HANN, he followed
the LYND down to about the infall of EMU CREEK.</p>
<p>On 19th June, he first broke new ground, leaving the Lynd and keeping a
north-east course, and camped (CAMP 3) on a large creek, a tributary of the
Tate, no doubt what is now known as the ROCKY TATE, and probably about the
infall of BULLOCK CREEK. He struck the TATE itself in about 8 miles to the
north-east, and followed it down 5 miles westward to the junction of the Rocky
Tate and camped 4 miles further down the river. CAMP 5, 21st</p>

<p>June. Prospecting near this camp, "colours" of GOLD were obtained. He had
passed in the course of the day what was subsequently known as "FISCHERTON,"
the centre of the TATE RIVER MINERAL FIELD.</p>
<p>Leaving the Tate on 22nd June, Mulligan took a NNW. course, parallel to
Hann's homeward track (Camps 82-84) and from 4 to 12 miles to the east of it.
His CAMP 6 was on BLACK GIN CREEK, a tributary of the Tate. His CAMP 7 (23rd
June) was on the WALSH RIVER, near the mouth of MULDIVA CREEK. (SEE MAP G.)
Here he got "colours" of gold, and observed "thousands of BLACKS' TRACKS."</p>
<p>Down the WALSH to the infall of ELIZABETH CREEK, Mulligan's track coincided
with Hann's outward track (Hann's Camps 10-12). Mulligan's CAMP 9 was Hann's
80th camp on the return journey, and is now the site of the WALSH TELEGRAPH
STATION.</p>
<p>Northward from the Walsh to MOUNT MULGRAVE, Mulligan was on, or not far
from, Hann's return track (Camps 78-79). His CAMP 10 (26th June), on the
Mitchell, was about 2 miles west of Hann's Camp 16, i.e., down the river. Here
he got colours of GOLD and observed that the "DARKIES" were numerous. He passed
Mount Mulgrave on its eastern side, and his CAMP II (28th June) was on the head
of Fox CREEK, a tributary of the Palmer. Keeping the THOMPSON RANGE on his
right, he dropped down on the PALMER on 29th June (CAMP 12), about a mile above
what was soon to become the township of PALMERVILLE.</p>
<p>The ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS of the Palmer valley had seen KENNEDY'S PARTY in
1848, and in 1872 HANN'S PARTY had been there twice, having spent sixteen days
on the first occasion. It was obvious to the natives that their country was
becoming too much of a thoroughfare, and Mulligan's invasion could not be
passed over without a protest. Accordingly the prospecting party had barely
settled down when an attempt was made to burn them out by SETTING FIRE TO THE
GRASS. The catastrophe was averted by the usual bush expedient of anticipating
the fire by burning a ring of grass, taking care that the flames did not spread
inward. In the meantime, the blacks climbed a hill from which they threw down
great stones, shouted and brandished SPEARS. That night a watch was set and the
camp was never after left with less than two men while the other members of the
party pursued their avocations.</p>
<p>Having moved camp twice for a short distance up the Palmer, the first week's
PROSPECTING was rewarded by six ounces of GOLD.</p>
<p>About a dozen BLACKS appeared on 6th July, but they were "civil," and the
interview ended with the "exchange of cooeys" and mutual invitations to visit
one another's camps, mutually declined owing to mutual distrust.</p>
<p>At a THIRD CAMP up the river, PAYABLE GOLD was again met</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 416}</u></p>
<p>with, and the party worked with dishes, and having "made a few ounces,"
began to think of working on a bigger scale with a cradle and selecting a
prospecting claim. On 13th July, they moved camp to the infall of CRADLE CREEK,
so named "because we got timber here to make a cradle out of a Leichhardt tree,
which we chopped down and chopped into boards with a tomahawk, having no other
tool save a rasp and hammer."</p>
<p>Up to 16th July, the camp being still at the mouth of CRADLE CREEK, parties
prospected the river up to the infall of the NORTH PALMER, or "left-hand branch
of the Palmer," as it is sometimes called, finding PAYABLE GOLD all the way, as
well as in a tributary coming from the north, which they named SANDY CREEK. The
NORTH PALMER was also found to be highly auriferous.</p>
<p>On 16th July, the party returned to their THIRD CAMP on the Palmer, and
while some settled down to work with the cradle, others rode down the river
past Hann's MOUNT TAYLOR.</p>
<p>On 30th July, the camp was shifted a little higher up the river, and again
(1 mile) on 1st August, to points where GOLD was plentiful. The majority of the
party worked steadily on GOLD till 7th August, while the Leader and others
extended their operations in various directions.</p>
<p>On 7th August they camped on the site of PALMERVILLE, where they had
resolved to make their headquarters beside what they were about to claim as a
prospecting area.</p>
<p>An extract may here be given from the diary in illustration of Mulligan's
singleness of purpose and his pre-Wordsworthian contempt for mere scenery,
which bored him almost to the point of incoherence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Due north," he says, "to the coast range close at
hand, the range of sandstone capping is irregularly broken into by creeks and
gorges, whilst, in a parallel line south, at the back of Thompson's Range, is
horrid to look at, and really I think looks worse than it really is. On the
whole, looking at the numerous bush fires and darkies' signal fires, which show
so well this calm morning, the scene is terribly grand, and considered so far
away in the wild bush, is a little shocking, though pleasing."</blockquote>
<p>On 8th August, they got PAYABLE GOLD at MOUNT TAYLOR, down the river below
Palmerville.</p>
<p>On 10th August, the CAMP was moved down the river to a point 5 miles below
MOUNT DAINTREE, i.e., to what is now FROME, and was the site of Hann's Camp 20,
near WARNER'S GULLY, the scene of WARNER'S FIRST DISCOVERY OF GOLD. Here only
"colours" were obtained, but one of the party got half an ounce of GOLD in a
crevice in a granite bar in the river.</p>
<p>From 12th to to 24th August, the prospectors were working PAYABLE GOLD in
the vicinity of PALMERVILLE. They then BURIED THEIR TOOLS, surplus AMMUNITION,
etc., resolving to build a hut on their return, and left for the Etheridge on
24th August, carrying</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 417}</u></p>
<p>102 ounces of GOLD. They struck south for MOUNT MULGRAVE, which they passed
on the west side, and followed Hann's track across the MITCHELL, and to, and
up, the WALSH, identifying on the way Hann's 12th camp. Crossing to the left
bank of the Walsh near Hann's Camp II, on 28th August, they struck S. and SSE.
up the valley of BROWN CREEK and camped on BLACK GIN CREEK, within a mile of
where it falls into the Tate River. (SEE MAP K.)</p>
<p>Next day (29th August) Mulligan ran up the TATE south-eastward to what is
now the TATE TELEGRAPH STATION (Hann's Camp 84), where he left the river and
followed Hann's homeward track (Camps 84-85) to MOUNT McDEVITT. Thence,
practically by Hann's track, he went south on 30th August, and camped at the
junction of FOSSIL BROOK with the LYND. "The Woolshed" (FOSSILBROOK OLD
STATION) was reached on 1st August, MOUNT SURPRISE STATION on 1st and
GEORGETOWN (Etheridge) on 3rd September.</p>
<p>Mulligan's first business at the Etheridge was to report payable gold on the
Palmer. The claim, supported as it was by the exhibition of the actual gold,
admitted of no dispute. An unprecedented "RUSH" to the new field soon followed
the announcement.</p>
<p>The first "RUSH" FROM THE ETHERIDGE to the Palmer was led by Mulligan, and
is briefly referred to in the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"After recruiting their health for a few days, they
[the prospectors] left the ETHERIDGE on the 12th day of September [1873],
accompanied by 100 men and about 300 horses, for whom they had to make a new
road, and reached the PALMER RIVER for the second time, on the 26th day of
September, remaining there until the 16th day of February, 1874, enduring great
hardships and privations, when they left for Cooktown, <i>Endeavour</i> River,
their horses completely worn out, after having prospected from Mount Taylor for
the distance of 60 miles, and found payable gold."</blockquote>
<p>The above paragraph is the only record of Mulligan's second trip to the
Palmer which I have ever seen, and is an excerpt from a Petition to Parliament
signed by 382 residents of Cooktown, praying for a reward to the prospecting
party. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>Mulligan appears to have written no account of it, and it is not therefore
numbered as an "expedition." It will be convenient to refer to his next
RECORDED trip, starting from Cooktown on 1st May, 1874, as his "SECOND
EXPEDITION."</p>

<p>SOME interesting glimpses of the events following on Mulligan's report of
the occurrence of payable gold on the Palmer are afforded by GEORGE ELPHINSTONE
DALRYMPLE'S <i>Narrative and Reports of the Queensland North-East Coast
Expedition</i>, 1873. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>This expedition set out on 29th September, 1873, from ROCKINGHAM BAY in the
12-ton cutter "<i>Flying Fish</i>" and 10-ton cutter "<i>Coquette</i>," both
chartered by the Queensland Government. (SEE MAP K.) Its object was to explore
all rivers, inlets, etc., between Cardwell and the Endeavour River. Dalrymple
was the officer in command, and he was assisted by Sub-Inspector F. M.
Thompson. There were also on board Walter Hill, Botanist, and Sub-Inspector R.
Johnstone, with thirteen native police troopers. Each of the cutters had its
own master, and there were six seamen and a cook.</p>
<p>The GOVERNMENT acted with promptitude and thoroughness, FORESEEING THE RUSH
which must inevitably take place. Mulligan only arrived at Georgetown and
telegraphed his discovery to Brisbane on 31st August, and on 9th September,
Dalrymple, as instructed, took charge of the expedition. The terms of the
instructions, however, involved delays at river-mouths between Rockingham Bay
and the Endeavour, and, besides, the minuteness of the craft employed made it
imperatively necessary to wait for perfect weather, so that the expedition only
anticipated the first of the rush by a bare nineteen hours. The cutters dropped
their anchors</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 419}</u></p>
<p>in the ENDEAVOUR RIVER in the afternoon of 24th October, and the
Australasian Steam Navigation Company's Steamer "<i>Leichhardt</i>" (Captain
Saunders) steamed into the harbour next morning. (SEE MAP E.)</p>
<p>The "<i>Leichhardt</i>" brought&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"A complete Government staff of police&mdash;to be
stationed at the Endeavour&mdash;of the Goldfields Department, for the new
diggings, in charge of MR. HOWARD ST. GEORGE, Gold Commissioner, who till then
had been Goldfield Warden at the Etheridge; and of Engineers of Roads under the
able leadership of MR. A. C. MACMILLAN, charged on this occasion with the
responsible duty of finding and making a road to the diggings. Some seventy
hardy miners accompanied them, the expedition being under the immediate charge
of LIEUTENANT CONNOR, R.N., of H.M. Surveying Schooner '<i>Pearl.</i>'"<br>
<br>
"Official correspondence," continues Dalrymple (par. 282), "informed me that
since my departure from the settlements, the continued good reports from the
Palmer diggings and the imminence of an immediate 'rush,' calculated greatly to
magnify the distress and danger which it had been part of the duty of my
expedition, co-operating with MR. SELLHEIM, to make provision for, had called
forth immediate executive action to provide for all possible emergencies." [Mr.
Sellheim had been instructed to mark a line of trees from the Palmer to
Cooktown. He was appointed Goldfield Warden for the Palmer in July, 1874. He
was subsequently Under-Secretary for Mines.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p>No time was lost in commencing the erection of dwellings for the
newcomers.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"On the day before [Friday]," says Dalrymple (par.
283), "we had sailed into a silent, lonely, distant river mouth, with thoughts
going back a century to the arrival of the brave navigator [Cook], its
discoverer, and his people, in knee breeches, three-cornered hats, and small
swords, pigtails and silver shoe-buckles. On Saturday we were in the middle of
a phase of enterprise peculiarly characteristic of the present day&mdash;of a
young diggings township&mdash;men hurrying to and fro, tents rising in all
directions, horses grazing and neighing for their mates, all around
us&mdash;the shouts of sailors and labourers landing more horses and cargo,
combined with the rattling of the donkey-engine, cranes and
chains."</blockquote>
<p>Dalrymple left on 31st October, observing (310):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The '<i>Leichhardt</i>' steamed out of the
Endeavour, leaving a lively little seaport under her starboard quarter,
gleaming with white tents and noisily busy with workmen, where a week before we
found a silent wilderness."</blockquote>
<p>In his report, dated 23rd February, 1874, Dalrymple observes that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Already, in the short space of four months,
COOKTOWN and the PALMER RIVER DIGGINGS have acquired a population of some 3,000
souls, and some 60 vessels are about to be 'laid on' for the Endeavour from the
Australasian ports at the termination of the rainy season."</blockquote>
<p>Within three years&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"About 15,000 white men and 20,000 Chinese landed at
the foot of Grassy Hill, on the way to the Palmer River Goldfield. And so
Cooktown continued to progress,</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 420}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">and the first section of a railway towards the
Palmer was opened on 30th November, 1885, a distance of 31 miles, and on the
8th October, 1888, to the Laura River, 67 miles from Cooktown." <b style=

<p>Unfortunately, alluvial gold, however rich, becomes exhausted sooner or
later, and the richer the sooner. As an alluvial field, the Palmer was at its
zenith in 1875, and had dwindled into insignificance by 1886. The field has,
however, produced GOLD to the value of about five and a half millions sterling,
of which it is estimated that 94 per cent, was alluvial. The reefs, principally
in the neighbourhood of Maytown, which have furnished the remaining 6 per
cent., have not attracted a large population. The result is that the Palmer
townships now present a very much less imposing aspect than they did in the
first decade of their existence, and Cooktown is a quiet town, supplying the
Palmer Goldfield, such as it now is, some fair pastoral country, some rich
agricultural land and some tin-mining centres, and with an asset of increasing
importance in its good harbour, which is the <i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> for Papua
and other Pacific Islands. By the time the RAILWAY had reached the LAURA, the
decay of the Palmer arrested its further progress, but I have a firm belief
that the Palmer reefs will in time receive the attention which they
deserve.</p>
<p>In spite of rich winnings, there were many diggers who failed to clear their
expenses on the Palmer. For a time the COST OF PACKING was enormous. Instances
are given of carriage charges varying from 2s. to 4s. per pound avoirdupois.
Flour was quoted on the field for some time at a standard rate of 1s. per pint
(approximately 1 lb.), and Mulligan mentions in 1874 that he paid &pound;20 per
bag for flour in Palmerville. For a time horse-shoe nails were weighed against
gold. Under such conditions, the definition of "PAYABLE GOLD" becomes very
elastic.</p>
<p>Among the "hardy miners" referred to by Dalrymple was a young man named
WILLIAM J. WEBB, from Brisbane, where he had arrived from England, as a boy, in
1855. The portrait herewith shows him as he was in 1915. His marriage was the
first celebrated in Cooktown, of which he is probably by this time the oldest
inhabitant. He has been good enough to write for my information an account of
the first journey from Cooktown to the Palmer, from which I quote the following
extracts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The '<i>Leichhardt</i>' dumped 96 of us diggers,
New Zealanders, Victorians, New South Welshmen, and Queenslanders, where No. 3
wharf, Cooktown, now is, in the morning of Saturday, 25th October, 1873. MR.
MACMILLAN, who was to lead the party to the Palmer, had picked up JERRY, the
black boy who was with Mr. William Hann, whose party had discovered gold, and
whose services Mr. Hann, while Mr. Macmillan was in Townsville, "lent" for the
occasion. There were diggers already on the field, but they had come from the
Etheridge, led by Mulligan, who, following Hann, had reported that the gold was
payable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>[1) A. Meston, <i>Geographic History of Queensland</i>. Brisbane,
by Authority, 1895, p 61.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 421}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The Government officials were mounted, but the
diggers were on foot, and had therefore to carry their swags and rations, each
man's share totalling about 70 lb., although some burdened themselves with even
greater loads. The diggers brought their rations from Townsville.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Macmillan wished to give the horses a spell after they left the ship, but
the diggers were impatient to make a start. Some thirty of the latter made up
their minds, the day after the landing, to set out next morning ahead of the
guides. A night of 'sleeping over it' brought wiser counsels and the number of
hot-heads was reduced to five next morning. THESE FIVE STARTED on Monday the
27th, under the leadership of George Batton Welch. Before telling about our own
doings I may say that on Friday, 31st October [having not long before come on a
tree on which Welch's name was cut], we met one of the party making his way
back to the port. He told us that after crossing a big river
[Normanby?&mdash;R. L. J.], the party split up on the top of a high range [Mt.
Ruby Range, between the Normanby and the head of the Deighton?&mdash;R. L. J.],
three going one way and our man and a mate going another. Later these two also
parted company. The man we met was, I believe, the ONLY SURVIVOR of the
five.<br>
<br>
"On Monday, the 27th, Messrs. Macmillan and St. George and Jerry got on a hill
where Jerry (who had not been in Cooktown, but in Weary Bay) got his bearings
and recognised landmarks he had seen when with Mr. Hann. Next day (Tuesday) he
led them to Mr. Hann's Camp No. 45 on Big Oaky Creek. We diggers having
received our orders, started out on Thursday, 30th October, and got as far as a
water-hole which we named after 'King Jerry,' and where we camped. On Friday,
31st, we came to Big Oaky Creek (Hann's Camp 45) and here joined Mr. Macmillan
and his party. We stopped there on Saturday. Mr. Macmillan did not wish to
follow Hann's track slavishly (Hann did not go from the Palmer direct to the
Endeavour&mdash;or rather to the Annan, which he thought was the
Endeavour).<br>
<br>
"On Sunday he led us to the foot of the range at the head of Oaky Creek and we
camped there. On Monday, 3rd November, he went ahead of us for a few hours,
looking for a gap in the range west of the Normanby River. Unfortunately he did
not go far enough north to see the gap through which the Railway now goes. We
got down in the NORMANBY RIVER at a place which must have been about Hann's
Camp 43. Some BLACKS were shot here. I do not know why, as they had not
interfered with us.<br>
<br>
"On Tuesday morning, 4th November, the mounted men crossed the river about a
quarter of a mile below our camp, followed by most of the pedestrians, who
waded across (the water knee-deep). I happened to see a log which had fallen
across the stream near the camp, and by this some 25 of us crossed. The 'horse'
party and the 'log' party had not quite come together when a number of BLACKS
made their appearance. When Mr. Macmillan and some other of the mounted men saw
them they galloped towards them, and they disappeared. The men who were near
enough to see the blacks well told us (the 'log' party) that they did not offer
to throw spears. On the contrary, they leant their spears up against rocks and
trees and did not raise their hands, and were evidently, in their own way,
trying to make it known that they meant peace.<br>
<br>
"From the crossing of the Normanby, we went on to the north-west, with the
river on our right and the range on our left, and came to the northern end of
the range, now known as BATTLE CAMP RANGE, and camped for the night. The
northern face of this range, between Hann's 4151 and 42nd camps, was where the
natives attacked Hann [17th September, 1872.&mdash;R. L. J.].<br>
<br>
"About five next morning, 5th November, while the stars were still shining, a
crowd of natives came up yelling out a terrible war cry, and they reached to
about 70 yards from where we lay all over the ground. There were about 40 in
the first rank and as many more in reserve some distance behind. Just as the
day was breaking, Messrs. Macmillan and St. George advanced towards them. I
noticed that they fired over the heads of the blacks, but some of the men fired
straight at the blacks, some of whom</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 422}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">fell. Thereupon the blacks ran away and were pursued
as far as a large lagoon, and all that went there stayed there.<br>
<br>
"In the meantime some of the horses rushed up to the camp, in a state of great
alarm. One horse went into a water-hole almost up to hie back. Then, about a
mile away, a party of blacks had got 14 horses, and were driving them away. The
blacks were yelling loudly and the horses (which had hobbles and bells on) were
mad with fright, when Johnnie Anderson, Jack the Blower, Jimmy the Poet, and a
tracker jumped (bareback) on four of the horses that had come into the camp and
went for the blacks who were driving the 14 horses. With the first shot fired
by the little party, the blacks ceased to yell and made off. The horses were
brought back to the camp. None of them had been speared, as they were too wild
to let the blacks come within spear range of them.<br>
<br>
"I may add that a Government Inquiry was held in Cooktown a few months later,
and it was settled that the diggers were justified in defending themselves.<br>
<br>
"We started from 'Battle Camp,' as the place was called afterwards, about 8
a.m., and when we had gone about 4 miles we were halted at a place we named
Consultation Hill. Mr. Macmillan told us that he estimated we were about 70
miles from the Palmer. The Government party were getting short of rations and
would push on ahead, marking a line of trees for us to follow. Then there was
an uproar! All hands set to work to lighten their loads by throwing away
everything but the barest necessaries. Some of the more heavily loaded even
abandoned quantities of flour, tea and sugar. In half an hour we started again
for the promised land. We had now rounded the northern end of the range and our
next course was to the south-west. The Queenslanders&mdash;some 25 of
us&mdash;got away first and tried to keep up with the horses or at least to
keep them in sight, and the others called after us, threatening to shoot us
unless we kept together, but we kept on and reached the WELCOME WATER-HOLES, on
Cabbage Tree Creek, by night and camped there. That was our longest stage
without water.<br>
<br>
"Next day, 6th November, 15 miles from the Welcome Water-holes, we came to a
river which Mr. Macmillan named the DEIGHTON, after the Under-Secretary for
Mines, and camped. Some 25 of us got into this camp by sundown. As night fell,
and all night long, we heard firing miles and miles behind us. It was the
stragglers trying to keep in touch with one another and with us after it became
too dark to distinguish the marked tree line. They kept dropping in to the camp
all through the night, the last of them only coming up next morning (7th
November) about 7 o'clock, as we were starting again.<br>
<br>
"We Queenslanders were still keeping up with the leader, Mr. Macmillan. About 4
miles from the Deighton that morning (7th November) we came on a big river, and
Mr. Macmillan said, 'I am calling this river the LAURA, after my wife.' It is
still the Laura River, but Mr. Macmillan did not know that Mr. Hann (who
crossed it higher up) had already named it the HEARN, after <i>his</i> wife.
About 4 miles further we came to a fine stream running from south to north. Mr.
Macmillan named it the 'Streamlet,' but it has since come to be known as the
'LITTLE LAURA.' After running it up about 5 miles, it was going too much south
and we crossed it and traversed, to the SW., the plains now known as FAIRVIEW.
At sundown we camped on a fine running stream, now known as PINE TREE CREEK,
and a tributary of the Little Laura. [Alluvial gold was discovered on this
creek in 1893.&mdash;R. L. J.] Between the Little Laura and Pine Tree Creek it
was very hot and dry. Half-a-crown was offered by one thirsty soul for a drink
of water from the 'billy' of a more provident man, who refused the offer, not
knowing where the next drink would come from. [SEE MAP G.]<br>
<br>
"On Saturday morning, 8th November, we started again, south-west, and came to
Pine Tree Creek again, and 3 miles further were at the foot of the
'Conglomerate' Range, or tableland. We mounted on the top, and when we had
crossed the tableland we could not get down, as the cliffs were perpendicular.
There was a deep valley in front of us, 2 miles wide, and then more cliffs, so
we had to go back to where</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 423}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">we had got up, and camped at the foot of the cliffs.
Here the last of our straggling mates came up, and they had the laugh on us,
saying we had had 8 miles more walking than they had, and it served us right
for being so smart.<br>
<br>
"Sunday was a day of rest, but Messrs. Macmillan and St. George rode about 10
miles out and found the 'bend' of the Kennedy. A mate named Tom Lynett and I
went back to Pine Tree Creek, where I had seen fish, and took my kangaroo dog
with us. We caught nine small fish, but that was nothing compared to the big
kangaroo that we bagged with the help of the dog. He was so heavy that it was
hard work getting him back to the camp, but when we came in sight with our
burden all hands ran out to welcome and help us and overwhelmed us with
affection, falling over one another and almost falling on our necks. I never
saw such willing and enthusiastic co-operation as there was in skinning,
dressing and cooking the meat. There was enough to let everybody in the
camp&mdash;more than 100 men&mdash;have a bit. Rations were getting very short
by this time.<br>
<br>
"On Monday, 10th November, we went on, north and west, to the KENNEDY BEND,
which we reached at noon. We ran the Kennedy up for 4 or 5 miles to the west,
to where it turns south. There were many blacks in the sandy river bed, and
they ran off to the hills as we came in sight. We camped on the river about two
o'clock. I fished for the rest of the day, but caught nothing. Here the river
splits into three branches, one of which retains the name of the Kennedy, while
the other two were named Emu Creek and St. George. [Emu Creek now appears on
the map as Kavanagh Creek.&mdash;R. L. J.] A lot of BLACKS were shot while we
were at this camp. I do not know why, as they had not interfered with us. I saw
three bodies in the water of the St. George, and I heard shooting while I was
fishing. Some of the diggers brought two gins and three piccaninnies into the
camp. The gins had in their possession a looking-glass, a razor and the HAIR OF
A WHITE MAN, besides two papers which proved to refer to the sale of a horse to
a man of the name of Leahey. It was supposed that this man was one of the
diggers from the Etheridge, who had been killed by the blacks on the
Palmer.<br>
<br>
"On Tuesday, 11th November, we went a day's stage to the south, up the KENNEDY
RIVER, which was dry. We had to dig in the sand for water when we camped at
night, and it took the Government party most of the night to water their
horses. Next morning (12th) we headed the river and got across the divide,
coming down about 11 a.m. off the 'Conglomerate' tableland to the valley of a
big river, which the leaders judged (correctly) to be the PALMER. It ran from
east to west and we crossed and camped on the south side. By this time we were
very SHORT indeed OF FOOD. My mates and I had come down to a limited allowance
of 'bango,' i.e., boiled flour and sugar, so no time was lost in going
a-foraging, some fishing and some shooting. After dinner, Messrs. Macmillan and
St. George went 4 miles up the river to a hill (which proved to be Hann's MOUNT
DAINTREE) to look out, but they saw no sign of diggers. The first evidence of
the presence of white men we saw was tracks of four horses in the sand of the
river, going down. Afterwards we learned that the horses belonged to some
diggers who had left the Palmer for Normanton.<br>
<br>
"Next day (13th), Mr. St. George rode 20 miles down the river, but saw nothing.
Mr. Macmillan went about 12 miles up and found diggers at work. In the evening
he returned to our camp, accompanied by Inspector Dyson, from the
Etheridge.<br>
<br>
"On Friday the 14th, the diggers started before daylight and went up the river
to what is now PALMERVILLE, where we found a few hundred diggers. The diggings
on the 'Left-Hand Branch' of the Palmer had been opened three days before and
had taken away a considerable number of men.<br>
<br>
"We had come very near the end of our provisions, what we could carry on our
backs, and unless we could buy more on the spot must return to the port,
however rich in gold the Palmer might be. We found that the only FLOUR FOR SALE
was a few bags on a 5-horse dray belonging to Ned Neil. Mrs. Neil was mounted
on the dray and conducted the sale of the flour, at half-a-crown a pound. If
the lady didn't like the looks of you, or found fault with your manners, or
thought she could read</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 424}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">in your eye any question as to whether the battered
pannikin she measured with, really held a pound of flour&mdash;you went
without&mdash;that was all about it. The butchers on the ground were Alf
Trevethan and Jack Edwards, and they had only nine bullocks left. Trevethan and
I had been boys together in England before we went to Brisbane. Afterwards he
found the crossing of the Annan (where the bridge now is) [SEE MAP E.] and
discovered Trevethan Mountain (tin lodes and stream tin). [SEE MAP G.] There
was no salt to be had on the Palmer and we had to sun-dry what little meat we
could get in the day and smoke it at night. I could not stay under these
conditions and made for the port with two mates. After a few days Mr. Macmillan
also started back, with 70 diggers and 150 pack-horses. <b style=

<p>Within nine months of the first "rush" the settlement of COOKTOWN and the
new PALMER GOLDFIELD had made rapid strides. The record of Mulligan's "second"
trip is chiefly valuable for the light it throws on the new activity, and only
the concluding portion shows that he broke new ground.</p>
<p>There were soon two roads from Cooktown to the Palmer, the first, the DRAY
ROAD, or COWARD'S TRACK, being practicable for wheel traffic to within 15 miles
of the goldfield, and the second, or DOUGLAS'S TRACK, "a good bridle track in
fine weather." (SEE MAPS E AND G.) Both roads made for the heads of the
NORMANBY, the dray road, up the westmost branch, which afterwards came to be
named LAKE CREEK (after Captain Lake, of the A.U.S.N. Co.) and Douglas's Track
crossing Cox CREEK (now called the EAST NORMANBY) and the WEST NORMANBY. (SEE
MAP G.)</p>
<p>Mulligan left the Four-Mile Camp, Cooktown, on 1st May,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 426}</u></p>
<p>1874, by Douglas's Track and diverged towards tributaries of the KENNEDY (as
he says, though it seems more likely that they were LAURA waters) where he got
GOLD, but not in payable quantities. He then spent a few days on the "LEFT-HAND
BRANCH," or NORTH PALMER RIVER, camping at the highest point which he had
reached on the first trip.</p>
<p>Leaving the NORTH PALMER on 23rd May, Mulligan camped on the PALMER proper
on the 25th. On the 27th, while he and his party were prospecting down the
river, they were ATTACKED BY BLACKS. "After being three times repulsed," he
writes, "they made a furious rush at us as we were leaving the camp. I never
saw blacks so determined. The long grass, scrub and high ridges were greatly in
their favour. Three of us got marked by them. They will, however, for the
future, know the effect of the rifle in that locality." The most seriously
WOUNDED of the party was a man named PETER ABELSON, and he was reported, eight
days later, to be nearly well again.</p>
<p>At this time PALMERVILLE was the headquarters of the Gold Commissioner
(Howard St. George),<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and EDWARDSTOWN, between
the Palmer and North Palmer, and north of the present township of Maytown, was
the "Commissioner's Upper Camp." MULLIGAN visited both camps, and LEFT
EDWARDSTOWN on a trip to the Mitchell Valley on 4th June.</p>
<p>Crossing the PALMER where MAYTOWN now stands, the party crossed Oaky Creek,
a tributary of SANDY CREEK, and cut the latter about 20 miles above its
confluence with the Palmer, and CAMPED on 13th June at PINE CREEK, one of the
heads of SANDY CREEK. PAYABLE GOLD was got in both these localities.
Incidentally, Mulligan DEFINES "PAYABLE GOLD," i.e., gold which it would pay
the party, under then existing conditions, to stop and work, as "not less than
1 oz. per man per day." He mentions that "all the branches on SANDY CREEK are
now occupied by people too late for OAKY CREEK; they are in most cases getting
good gold...I am told that men are now leaving the UPPER PALMER, where some are
making 2 to 3 oz. per week...The lower part of SANDY CREEK has been worked for
months, and considered poor; the people are now making their way upwards." He
also refers to "numerous good-looking REEFS for gold right opposite OAKY
CREEK."</p>
<p>Mulligan's CAMP ON OAKY CREEK was about 6 miles west of the subsequently
discovered CANNIBAL CREEK TIN LODES.</p>
<p>The horses were suffering from the cold in the high land at the PINE CREEK
CAMP, and Mulligan gladly left it on 9th July, and crossing the divide to the
south, dropped down on "MITCHELL WATERS." It was not, however, the Mitchell
itself which was first</p>
<blockquote>[1) Mr. St. George was appointed Police Magistrate at Cooktown, and
Mr. P. F. Sellheim became Warden of the Palmer in July, 1874.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 427}</u></p>
<p>met with, but a large tributary coming from the east on which the name of
the ST. GEORGE RIVER was bestowed. The new river was prospected upwards for "a
few days," but no other indication is given of the distance traversed. GOLD was
found in it everywhere, but not enough to be payable. Returning down the river,
they came on a party who had been following their tracks under the belief that
they were on good gold.</p>
<p>The ST. GEORGE RIVER<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> was then followed down
to its junction with the Mitchell, with similar results as regards gold. The
CAMP of 20th July was on the MITCHELL, 4 miles below the infall of the St.
George, and therefore probably about the infall of LIMESTONE CREEK from the
north.</p>
<p>Mulligan LEFT THE MITCHELL on 22nd July and turned northward, prospecting
till he reached the watershed between the Mitchell and the Palmer. In some of
the gullies he found a "tolerably fair show of fine GOLD." Apparently his
course was far enough west to miss the ANGLO-SAXON REEF (Groganville), which,
about 1887, was a considerable producer of GOLD. From the divide he came
straight in (NW.) to PALMERVILLE, <i>via</i> LIMESTONE CREEK,<b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> "to see after fresh horses," arriving on 27th July,
1874.</p>

<h5>(SEE MAP G.)</h5>
<p>After a stay of ten days in Palmerville, Mulligan again set out on 6th
August., 1874, with the intention of extending his observations in the valley
of the St. George River. About WHITE HORSE CREEK, he left the track by which he
had approached Palmerville on his second trip and shortly afterwards, on an
ESE. course crossing McGANN CREEK, reached, on 10th August, a camp where he had
already worked, "getting a little gold." This must have been PINE CREEK, on
which he camped from 13th June to 9th July. So rapidly had occupation
progressed that the site of that camp was now covered by "Tought's BUTCHERING
ESTABLISHMENT" AND STORE, and all the surrounding gullies were being worked for
GOLD, including some which drain into the St. George. Among the latter was FINE
GOLD CREEK, which is shown on the 4-mile map. Mulligan, who had evidently
intended to pick up a little more gold here, confesses to a disappointment that
the RUSH had set in so soon.</p>
<p>Having procured two fresh horses at Tought's camp, Mulligan and his party
left on 13th August, and keeping on the whole a little to the south of east,
crossed the watershed between the PALMER AND ST. GEORGE and prospected the
drainage area of the latter river up to 24th August, when they camped on TIN
CREEK. The country was so rough that it was frequently necessary to travel 30
miles to gain 10. Every gully contained GOLD, "but not enough to satisfy
us."</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 429}</u></p>
<p>From a main camp on TIN CREEK, which they named, they followed the creek
north for 20 miles, to near its head, where they found, besides a little GOLD,
"a fair show of TIN," but Mulligan observed, "when we consider it would take
three tons to pay the carriage of one, better leave it alone, and try to find
it over the eastern falls towards the coast near the Daintree, where carriage
will not be such a consideration." A belt of granite country, containing TIN
LODES, is now known to extend from the divide where the South Palmer and Tin
Creek (of the St. George) take their rise, westward to the head of CANNIBAL
CREEK.</p>
<p>On 29th August, the camp was moved 8 miles south, to where Tin Creek falls
into the ST. GEORGE RIVER. A little GOLD was found in the ST. GEORGE here. In
two days (30th and 31st August) to the south, the party struck the MITCHELL
RIVER. This watershed must have been crossed only a mile or two east of HANN'S
FURTHEST EASTERN POINT, which he reached on foot on 29th July, 1872, the
country being too rough for horses. From the greatest elevation reached, a
"notable landmark" descried to the southeast was the tableland to which the
name of MOUNT MULLIGAN was afterwards applied. The MITCHELL VALLEY at the camp
of 31st August and 1st September is described as "FINE CATTLE COUNTRY." The
hoof-prints of four cattle were seen north of the river, and a day was spent in
an (unsuccessful) hunt for beef. Probably the cattle had been dropped from some
travelling mob, as by this time cattle had begun to be driven from every
possible source towards the Palmer, where they commanded high prices.</p>
<p>The camp on the MITCHELL must have been very near the infall of the
HODGKINSON RIVER, which was met with early on 2nd September. The river was
named in honour of W. O. Hodgkinson, M.L.A.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The
CAMP of 2nd September was 6 miles up the Hodgkinson River (ESE.) and at the
foot of the tableland, the "notable landmark" of 31st August, which the other
members of the party insisted on calling MOUNT MULLIGAN. This tableland,
overhanging the Hodgkinson valley, extends south-eastward from the junction of
the HODGKINSON with the MITCHELL for 23 miles, is apparently of
Permo-Carboniferous age and consists mainly of horizontal beds of sandstone,
with a seam of COAL. For the connection of this coal with metallurgical works

<p>On 3rd September, Mulligan went 18 miles up the HODGKINSON, south-eastward,
passing the infall of the EASTERN HODGKINSON. Up to this camp he describes the
valley as "fertile" and "comprising the best and richest soil I have seen
anywhere." He got "colours" of GOLD on the bars.</p>
<p>Proceeding on the same course up the river on 4th September, he found that
in 2 miles it branched. Presumably, this was where CALEDONIA CREEK, and another
creek rising west of MOUNT McGANN, fall in. Following the river itself for 5
miles SE., he camped "at another junction," i.e., at the infall of the creek
followed to-day by the DIMBULAH-MOUNT MULLIGAN RAILWAY. This CAMP was about 2
miles south of the site of THORN BOROUGH, which afterwards became the centre of
the HODGKINSON GOLDMINING DISTRICT. Here they saw NATIVES, "but," says
Mulligan, "they soon hide from sight. They are wilder than kangaroos. They run
from their camps, and leave many little things behind."</p>
<p>Next day (5th September), all hands prospected the neighbourhood for
ALLUVIAL GOLD. "Colours" and "shotty specks" were the only reward of their
labour, and the verdict was that "there was NO PROSPECT FOR ANYTHING PAYABLE
HERE only for fattening cattle." An amusing instance of how Mulligan's views
were coloured by his disappointment, or perhaps of his habitual attitude of
being bored to the point of incoherence by mere scenery, occurs in his
observation: "We are disgusted with the sight of such nice round hills and
mountains passed by, and yet no show of gold or even quartz."</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1877, attention began to be directed to the HODGKINSON
as a REEFING DISTRICT, and it may be mentioned incidentally that Mulligan was
one of Thornborough's earliest business men. Exceedingly rich crushings were
obtained from numerous narrow shoots, but after ten or twelve years the
industry languished. It never, however, quite died out, and recent indications
appear to promise for it a renewed lease of life. Details of the geological
structure and output of the field will be found in the reports quoted below.

<p>On 6th September, 1874, the Party left the Hodgkinson proper, and struck
NSW., camping on "a large tributary," probably the "LITTLE HODGKINSON" RIVER.
Next day (7th September) "a few miles to the SW." brought them into very
difficult country between the Hodgkinson and the Walsh. "I never beheld such
rough country before," says the Leader. (SEE MAP K.)</p>
<p>On the 9th, the party scrambled up a spur which they had discovered after
much anxious search, and were at last on the southern, or Walsh side of the
watershed. On the 10th, although</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 431}</u></p>
<p>they "kept well on the range," travelling was even more difficult than on
the 7th. "In all my travels," Mulligan remarks, "I never saw such rough country
as to-day. All porphyry, intermixed with sandstone, therefore it is not
slippery, otherwise the horses could not get along. I cannot see to what
earthly use this country can be turned. Such a solid block of country, of about
50 miles across by 100 miles long, stretching longways from within a few miles
of the Mitchell towards the head of the Lynd; too rough and stony, destitute of
grass, not even enough for a kangaroo!" Nevertheless, he reached and camped on
the WALSH in the afternoon. The precise position of this CAMP cannot be given,
though it might easily be located, if one were on the spot. I take it to be
about 6 miles down the river from the infall of EMU CREEK.<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> It could easily be located by the ALMOST BOILING SPRING
which Mulligan found beside it, and no doubt the spring is known to many of the
wolfram, tin, copper and silver miners a population ever prone to wandering and
prospecting&mdash;now resident within easy reach of it at the Wolfram Camp,
Lappa-Lappa, Koorboora and Chillagoe.</p>
<p>Trying next day (11th September) to follow the course of the river downward
to the west, the party travelled 12 miles, but had to turn back some distance
to find a crossing, as the valley had narrowed to an impassable gorge, so that
probably the actual westing was comparatively small. The CAMP was on a little
patch of green feed, beside a BOILING SPRING. On the 12th, the river was
followed down for 15 miles, and the frequent HUMAN FOOTPRINTS seen proved the
native inhabitants to be numerous.</p>
<p>On the 13th, still following the WALSH down to the west, "a very large
river, like the Palmer," was found falling in from the south. The conjecture
may be made that this "river" was CHILLAGOE CREEK. The "much smaller river"
which fell in on the north side was probably DOOLAN CREEK. (SEE MAP G.) The
CAMP for the night was probably just west of the infall of ROOKWOOD CREEK. Here
two branded trees were found, one marked</p>

<p>Mulligan's position was now WEST OF HANN'S "FURTHEST EAST" on the Walsh
(13th July, 1872). He (Mulligan) attributed the marks to members of "J.
EDWARDS' PARTY, when out prospecting in 1871." If he was right, Hann was, after
all, not the first to visit this portion of the Walsh. Even in that case, the
unrecorded visit of the prospector does not detract from the credit due to
Hann, who named, traced and mapped the river a year later, and located its
junction with the Mitchell.</p>
<p>On 14th September, Mulligan ran the WALSH down, and left it at a reach which
bent to the south. He then, for a short</p>
<blockquote>[1 Till recently, EMU CREEK was only known as the "THIRD
WALSH."]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 432}</u></p>
<p>distance, followed up a creek (BOWLER CREEK?) which fell in on the right, or
north, bank, but as he wished to go north-west and the creek was taking him to
the east of north, he left it and struck out north-west, following a high ridge
of granite boulders. The country lately traversed is dismissed with the curt
remark: "No GOLD HERE." He camped on the 15th on a gully falling to the north,
towards the Mitchell, as he supposed, but which must have been a tributary of
Nolan Creek.</p>
<p>On 16th September, Mulligan travelled NNW. and camped on a "big watershed"
with sandstone cliffs to north and south. [For "watershed" it is necessary to
read "water-course," as a close acquaintance with Mulligan's writings shows
that he was careless in the use of the former word.&mdash;R. L. J.] The
water-course must have been NOLAN CREEK, a tributary of the Walsh.</p>
<p>On the 17th, he went north to the MITCHELL RIVER, which he struck near the
mouth of the "DRY RIVER" (the "Dry River" which heads near the O.K. Copper
Mines). He had great difficulty in getting down off the sandstone tableland
(TAYLOR'S CARBONIFEROUS RANGE of the Hann expedition), and compares the descent
unfavourably with that on the Hell's Gate track between the Normanby and the
Palmer. Between the cliffs and the Mitchell, he must have crossed HANN'S TRACK
of 28th July, 1872.</p>
<p>After stopping two days at the MITCHELL to recruit the energies of men and
horses, both tired and worn, the journey was resumed, and PALMERVILLE was
reached, <i>via</i> MOUNT MULGRAVE, on 21st September, 1874. No details are
given of this portion of the journey, which was now familiar ground.</p>
<p>As already stated, Mulligan's intention when he left the Palmer was only to
see the St. George River above the point reached on his previous visit, but the
fascination of his pursuit took him much further. The "notable landmark" now
known as MOUNT MULLIGAN drew him like a magnet, and at the foot of that
mountain he discovered the HODGKINSON RIVER, a large affluent of the Mitchell.
From the site of the present town of Thornborough, on the Hodgkinson, he then
crossed a rugged range to the Walsh River near the infall of Emu Creek. Finally
he traced the river downward till he was west of Hann's "furthest east," and
returned to the Palmer.</p>

<h5>(SEE MAP G.)</h5>
<p>Mulligan left his camp, near MOUNT Fox, about 10 miles below PALMERVILLE, on
1st October, 1874, and spent about a fortnight on a PROSPECTING TOUR TO THE
WEST AND NORTH. He crossed BIG CREEK and STEWART'S CREEK and CAMPED on 2nd
October at a hill which he estimated to be 22 miles W. 30&deg; N. of MOUNT
DAINTREE. The bearing is no doubt correct, and assuming the correctness of the
distance, the camp would be on the north side of ANNIE CREEK, about 7 miles
west of HANN'S TRACK between his 20th and 21st camps. He got "colours" of GOLD,
but places which appeared promising could not be prospected for want of water.
The CAMP of 3rd October was 8 miles NNE. at a spring on HANN'S TRACK, north
of</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 434}</u></p>
<p>his 21st camp. Mulligan then ascended the sandstone tableland known as the
"CONGLOMERATE RANGE," and here, of course, the prospect of alluvial gold ended.
The whole of the country to the west, visible from the summit, was ablaze with
FIRES lighted by the NATIVES. About 11 miles east of the encampment,
"MACMILLAN'S ROAD" from Cooktown to Frome and Palmerville, following up the
KENNEDY RIVER, was crossed, and 10 miles further east, "MACKENZIE'S NEW ROAD,"
which follows up the LITTLE KENNEDY RIVER by HANN'S RETURN TRACK of 1872 (Camps
74 to 76). As neither the Kennedy nor the Little Kennedy had carried the
process of erosion down through the horizontal sandstone to the underlying
auriferous foundation, the quest for alluvial gold was abandoned and Mulligan
and his party RETURNED TO PALMERVILLE.</p>
<p>A FRESH START was made on 22nd October, and the MITCHELL RIVER was reached,
<i>via</i> MOUNT MULGRAVE, on 24th. This camp on the Mitchell was probably a
little above that of 17th September (3rd trip).</p>
<p>From this point the party travelled and prospected up the ST. GEORGE RIVER
to the camp of 29th August, at the infall of TIN CREEK, which was reached on
28th October. "A little GOLD" was obtainable anywhere in the river and the
presence of "good looking QUARTZ REEFS" was noted. Travelling up the river on
30th and 31st October, "good-looking country for GOLD" and "numerous QUARTZ
REEFS" were observed on the south side. On the latter date the river, flowing
through slate country, was hemmed in by granite mountains forming the divide
between the St. George and the Palmer on the north and the McLeod on the
south.</p>
<p>On 2nd November, to SSE. with "really good travelling" and "magnificently
grassed country, level box flats, open forest," the party reached a river,
which at first was taken for the main Mitchell, but was afterwards ascertained
to be a branch and named the McLeod, after one of the party. The CAMP for the
night was where, on following the river up, it bends, according to the modern
map, from north-east to south-east. A creek falling in from the north side,
probably ESCAPE CREEK, was prospected. Mulligan mentions that in crossing the
river, which was chest deep, they stripped to the skin and waded. "Our
appearance," he observes, "must be very annoying to the DARKIES, as well as
theirs is to us, for they immediately abandoned a laborious piece of work they
were engaged at, in making a wing-dam across a back bend or wing of the river
in order to poison the water with branches and leaves to catch fish." The creek
yielded "a little GOLD, but not enough to pay, and also a little TIN." Mulligan
remarks on the magnificent soil and vigorous growth of trees on both the creek
and the river. "Colours" of gold were got in every dish on the river
itself.</p>
<p>On 3rd November, Mulligan and his companions continued</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 435}</u></p>
<p>their journey to the north-east, at the branch which the modern map calls
SPENCER'S CREEK. They made the camp near the head of this creek their
headquarters <i>till</i> 8th November for various reasons. A horse was lame,
Mulligan himself was not feeling very well, and it rained every day:
prospecting, fishing and shooting took up some time, and finally there was the
sport of tracking a bullock. This hunt for beef, though unsuccessful in its
primary object, resulted in the locating of the MITCHELL RIVER 12 or 14 miles
south of the camp, and also some quartz reefs, which, however, were not of a
promising aspect.</p>
<p>On 9th November, the party climbed, in 2 miles, northward to the top of the
WATERSHED BETWEEN THE McLEOD AND THE PALMER. The ascent is described as being
"higher and four times worse than Hell's Gates, on the road to Cooktown."
Outcrops of LIMESTONE were observed on the summit. The CAMP for the night was
at the first water on "the extreme head" of the PALMER, apparently the head
named PROSPECT CREEK on the modern map. There was no quartz in the hills and no
gold at the camp.</p>
<p>The party, next day (10th November), went 11 miles WNW. down the PALMER
(Prospect Creek), which would make the camp midway between PICCANINNY and
STEWART CREEKS. On 11th November, a further distance of 9 miles was
accomplished, and for the first time water was observed in the river, which
received it from "a narrow boggy creek," presumably the BOGGY CREEK of the
modern map. Quartz had now begun to appear, and "shotty GOLD," but not enough
of it, was found in the river as well as in gullies and ravines near the
camp.</p>
<p>The CAMP of 12th November was 6 miles further down the river (NW.). The two
following days were spent in prospecting, but as water was for the most part
not available, the men had to be content with "dry-blowing," and although
"colours" of GOLD were obtained, nothing remunerative was found. The fires of
four NATIVE CAMPS were seen above this camp.</p>
<p>On 15th November the party LEFT THE PALMER and went north for 9 miles. On
the 17th, they camped beside an old native camp, where a spring issued from
basalt, on the eastern fall, near the head of the HEARN OR LAURA RIVER, after
having headed the "LITTLE PALMER" RIVER. In crossing from the Palmer valley to
the head of the Little Palmer, it was found that the granite range which had,
down to this point, formed the north-eastern wall of the Palmer valley,
continued to the north or north-west, while the divide between the Little
Palmer and the Normanby was a comparatively low range of basalt. From a peak
near this camp, BATTLE CAMP RANGE was visible to the north (45 miles) and MOUNT
PETER BOTTE to east-south-east (40 miles).</p>
<p>In this camp it was hotly debated whether the expedition should return to
Palmerville or go eastwards to the DAINTREE.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 436}</u></p>
<p>It may be remembered that all they could have known of the Daintree was the
situation of its mouth, as determined by Dalrymple the year before. Mulligan
himself favoured the former course, having observed from his peak that the
country to the east was extremely rough. He concluded that it was better to
tackle the Daintree with rations purchased at reasonable prices in Cooktown
than with an outfit from Palmerville where flour, for example, cost &pound;20
per bag. Fortunately, the other members of the party were convinced by the
sweet reasonableness of this argument.</p>
<p>On 18th November, Mulligan RECROSSED THE DIVIDING RANGE, and, after passing
over "beautiful quartz ridges," CAMPED on a "big sandy creek" (a tributary of
the "LITTLE PALMER").</p>
<p>Next day (19th November}, a CAMP was formed 7 miles to the west, for a few
days' prospecting. Fine GOLD was got in the neighbouring gullies, "but not
sufficient to pay at present, water being scarce."</p>
<p>On 23rd November, Mulligan and four others started on an EXCURSION with the
intention of prospecting the HEADS OF THE NORMANBY RIVER. That day they
travelled 30 miles east before they got water for a CAMP, probably in STORING
CREEK, one of the heads of the WEST (middle) NORMANBY. Next day (24th
November), they moved camp eastward across a low range to "another and larger
branch," which must have been the "EAST NORMANBY or COX CREEK, as bearings
taken from an adjoining hill showed MOUNT COOK to lie N. 10&deg; E. and MOUNT
PETER BOTTE ENE. They had been travelling parallel to, and a few miles to the
north of, HANN'S COURSE between his camps 57 and 59. Two of the party went
east, but reported that it was simply IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE HORSES TO THE
BLOMFIELD in that direction. The mouth of that river was about 15 miles, and
the nearest part of the river about 11 miles from the camp of 24th
November.</p>
<p>"Colours" of GOLD could be obtained in the gullies within reach of the camp,
but there was no water for prospecting purposes.</p>
<p>The party moved NW. down the EAST NORMANBY RIVER on 25th November, finding
by the way prospects of GOLD, which, although they could only "dry-blow," they
judged would be payable after the advent of the rains, especially as outfit and
provisions could be purchased economically at Cooktown, instead of costing the
prohibitive Palmerville prices. A little lower, they came on an old mate, JACK
WATSON, who was himself "getting a little GOLD," and informed them that a
little RUSH had already taken place, but that most of the men had left for want
of water and grass. One party was still working up a gully, stacking washdirt
to be ready for the rains.</p>
<p>On 26th November, the excursion party returned to the main camp of the
19th.</p>
<p>Two of the party were now despatched to COOKTOWN for a</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 437}</u></p>
<p>load of stores, and on 27th November, the main body commenced the HOME
JOURNEY TO PALMERVILLE. Now almost within sight of his goal, Mulligan's diary
becomes somewhat careless as regards directions and distance travelled. The
party camped the first night after going 8 miles, presumably southward, to the
"main" PALMER RIVER, passing "good-looking gullies, in some of which could see
a little fine GOLD on the bars," which had apparently been missed by the
diggers. They worked hard for two days, and located GOLD which no doubt would
have been payable under more favourable conditions, but as they had only tin
dishes and had to carry the dirt a long way to water, they were "not quite
satisfied" with their earnings. In the afternoon of the second day (29th
November), they shifted 4 miles to another creek, "on their way," and therefore
probably BLACKFELLOW CREEK.</p>
<p>The 30th November was spent in prospecting here, with similar results.</p>
<p>On 1st December, keeping a few miles out from the left bank of the river,
mainly NW., the party, after travelling deviously for 15 miles, over slate
formation with numerous outcrops of quartz reefs on every hill, CAMPED again on
the PALMER RIVER, probably about 2 miles below the site of BYERSTOWN. It may be
added that the country traversed by Mulligan, 27th November to 1st December,
1874, was occupied, during the wet season which followed, by diggers who
grouped themselves around the new township of BYERSTOWN, of which Byers and
Little's butchery formed the nucleus, a convenient fattening ground for cattle
being situated on the head-waters of the Laura.</p>
<p>On 2nd December, 2 miles to the SW., the party found DOUGHBOY CREEK, which
had already been named by a party who had WORKED GOLD in it. Mulligan's idea
was that their neighbourhood was workable at a profit by parties obtaining
their stores direct from Cooktown instead of through the medium of Palmerville.
He camped for the night, after 15 miles of travelling, at what he called
PENRICH CREEK, probably the SOUTH PALMER. The diggers who subsequently worked
out this neighbourhood established the township of UHRSTOWN.</p>
<p>On 3rd December, over rough country where he "had to go 5 miles to gain 3,"
Mulligan travelled 16 miles to WSW. A little GOLD was to be got, and had there
been water he would have stopped, as he thought well of the country, and it had
evidently been little prospected. This must have been "GRANITE CREEK."</p>
<p>On 4th December, Mulligan travelled 27 miles westward to SANDY CREEK.
PALMERVILLE, 18 miles further west, was reached on 5th December, 1874.</p>
<p>For Mulligan the Palmer had by this time gone stale, and he pined for new
fields. He could not get out of sight of landmarks</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 438}</u></p>
<p>with which he had already become familiar. "To me it is a pleasure," he
writes, "to traverse and gaze on new country where no human foot ever trod or
gazed (!) before. Every step discloses new scenes and fresh discoveries...The
fascination, as well as the charm, is broken once I return to ground travelled
before, though I expect more gold."</p>

<p>In four trips, on the first of which he proved that the gold first
discovered by Hann on the Palmer River was present in payable quantities,
Mulligan had exhausted the attractions of the district, for he was a man who
could not be happy as long as he was in sight of a landmark already known to
him.</p>
<p>These FOUR TRIPS were undertaken AT HIS OWN EXPENSE, or at all events
without aid from the State, although it is possible that some of his companions
may have contributed towards the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 440}</u></p>
<p>cost of the outfit. The remuneration which he and they shared was the
Government reward of &pound;1,000 for the discovery of a payable goldfield,
added to what gold they found time to pick up. Compared to what fell to those
who followed his tracks and systematically worked the ground, Mulligan's own
share was infinitesimal.</p>
<p>In his FIFTH EXPEDITION, Mulligan was assisted by a GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY of
&pound;500. His companions were Frederick Warner (afterwards Staff Surveyor,
Department of Lands), James Dowdall, William Harvey, Peter Abelson, Jack Moran
and the black boy, Charlie. Abelson had been with Mulligan on his second
expedition and had been wounded by the blacks.</p>
<p>The RECORD OF THE EXPEDITION is a Parliamentary Paper entitled "Expedition
in Search of Gold and other Minerals in the Palmer District by Mulligan and
Party." (Brisbane, by Authority, 1876.) The party returned to Cooktown on 23rd
September, 1875, and Mulligan sent an abstract of his report on the 24th to the
Minister for Works and Mines. In that abstract and in the report itself, as
finally printed, reference is made to a MAP TO BE PREPARED BY MR. WARNER as an
essential adjunct to the report; but the report appeared without the map.</p>
<p>As the map was obviously of high importance (indeed, in my view of no less
importance than the report itself), I instituted inquiries, and Mr. A. B.
Brady, the present Under-Secretary for Works, who was good enough to interest
himself in the matter, unearthed a correspondence, from which it appeared that
as late as 27th March, 1876, the map had not been prepared. Mulligan, writing
from Cooktown on that date to the Under-Secretary, said: "Mr. Warner is going
to Brisbane in a few days; he being our Surveyor will be able to furnish you
with all the information required, and plot a chart of the whole <i>route</i>."
In the same letter, Mulligan forcibly insisted on his report being officially
published, observing, "to have my journal shelved for a departmental record
without giving me time or opportunity to copy and correct it, is more than I
would barter for half the amount received by the whole party."</p>
<p>The report was officially issued later in the same year (1876), but without
the map, which either had not been received in time, or was not considered of
sufficient importance to justify the expense of drawing it on stone. Mulligan
had quite correctly gauged the official attitude of the time with regard to
reports which had no political significance. They were "given to the
newspapers," and were printed in full if the "demands on our space" permitted,
or, if not, a sub-editor extracted such portions as he judged would strike the
popular taste. The same policy was still in vogue when I arrived in the Colony
in 1877, and resulted, among other things, in the loss of the map which was to
have accompanied</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 441}</u></p>
<p>the report on my explorations of 1879-80 in the Cape York Peninsula.</p>
<p>Having become convinced that Mulligan had intentionally left much to be
explained by the map, I made an effort to trace the latter, and I am indebted
to Mr. A. R. Macdonald, lately Undersecretary for Mines, for a copy of a record
of the Department of Lands (Survey Branch), inscribed as in the
footnote.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>It is evident that Warner's map was received between 27th March and &mdash;
June, 1876, as from no other source could the information relating to
Mulligan's explorations have been derived. The lines of alternate dot and dash
showing "Mulligan's Track" depict first that portion of his fifth, or official,
journey lying between the head of the Palmer and (<i>via</i> the heads of the
Mitchell and Wild Rivers) the "main divide" between the Herbert River and the
Lynd, and second, that portion of the same journey from the confluence of the
Lynd and Mitchell to the Lukin (Holroyd) River and thence to the Normanby River
north of the present "Welcome" Railway Station. The line of dash and two dots
showing "Mulligan's second trip, 1875," depicts only 32 miles (from the
Hodgkinson River northward) of what I have described as the "third" trip
(1874).</p>
<p>It was gratifying to find that the track of the fifth or official trip, so
far as the tracing showed it, agreed in a remarkable manner with the track as
laid down by me from the narrative before the tracing came into my possession.
The only differences were due to my having much more complete maps to work on
than were available to the compiler of June, 1876.</p>
<p>The tracing throws no light on Mulligan's four previous trips, the first of
which led directly to the opening of the Palmer Goldfield. So far as I am aware
their tracks are now for the first time laid down on the maps accompanying this
volume.</p>
<p>The party LEFT COOKTOWN with twenty-two horses, on 29th April, 1875, and
travelled <i>via</i> the FOUR-MILE and "Coward's Track" to the NORMANBY
DIGGINGS. (SEE MAP E.) COWARD'S TRACK, as already explained, is the westmost of
two roads up the Normanby valley, and follows the head known as LAKE CREEK.
(SEE MAP G.)</p>
<p>"The NORMANBY COUNTRY, as well as the HEADS OF THE LAURA," says Mulligan,
"is about the best country to be seen in the north. Little and Byers are
running their fat cattle on the extreme east head of the Laura. Here we stop to
cure sufficient beef for our trip. Paid &pound;30 for a bullock, which, with
200 lb. ham and suet, we reckon will do us for a few months."</p>

<p>After a delay caused by the loss of a horse, Mulligan led the party on 11th
May from the head of the LAURA up the spur of the Coast Range discovered by him
on 26th November, 1874, when he had noted that it would be suitable for a dray
track. It was already, he now found, "used by diggers coming down from the
Palmer."</p>
<p>Keeping a general southerly course, Mulligan crossed the PALMER and ST.
GEORGE RIVERS and camped on 16th May on the bank of the MITCHELL. CAMP 6. As
this region was already familiar to him, Mulligan only remarks that "a good
dray road can be got, every perch of which we travelled." A DRAY ROAD does now
follow his track, connecting WOODVILLE, on the Hodgkinson, with COOKTOWN,
<i>via</i> UHRSTOWN. Mulligan's <i>route</i> from the Mitchell to the eastern
branch of the Hodgkinson coincided with the dray road as laid down on the
modern map. His CAMP 7, of 17th May, on the EASTERN HODGKINSON, was near the
mouth of McLEOD CREEK. He was now on AURIFEROUS GROUND HITHERTO UNKNOWN, and on
prospecting got a little GOLD.</p>
<p>Travelling a mile or two south of the left bank of the river, Mulligan
continued next day to get "colours of GOLD," and camped on the left bank about
2 miles east of MORAN CREEK. CAMP 8, 19th May.</p>
<p>Next day (20th May) he followed up MORAN CREEK, which he took to be (and
which perhaps is) the largest head of the EASTERN HODGKINSON, in a NNE.
direction, getting only "colours" of GOLD. His CAMP 9, on MORAN CREEK, he
judged to be 13 miles from Camp 8, but it is evident that the difficulties of
travelling and delays for the purpose of prospecting caused him to overestimate
the distance. In 15 miles SSE., on the following day (21st May), he reckoned
that at his CAMP 10 he had at last got clear of the Hodgkinson waters. He was
probably about the head of ROMAN CREEK.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>East of the heads of the EASTERN HODGKINSON lies the granitic mass which
Mulligan named HANN'S RANGE, and which runs from NNW. to SSE. Mulligan now made
to the east for a gap in this range, beyond which he confidently (and
correctly) hoped to find the head of the MITCHELL. He did, indeed, find it, but
crossed it without being aware of the fact. His CAMP 12, of 23rd May, was on
the MITCHELL, "close to a new mia-mia of the darkies," and he "hoped to see the
Mitchell to-morrow." The camp was in "open forest country, more like a meadow,
traversed by numerous deep creeks, with a stream of water in each, and it was
difficult to find a stone for an anvil to punch horses' shoes on." This FINE
COUNTRY, hitherto untrodden by white men, excited his</p>
<blockquote>[1) Called after "Sam the Roman," a Roumanian, afterwards a
well-known Hodgkinson "identity."]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 443}</u></p>
<p>admiration, and although mere scenery left him cold, he foresaw its value
for pastoral purposes.</p>
<p>A few years later, I had occasion to become very familiar with this
district, and to my surprise I found that the HEAD OF THE MITCHELL is actually
in this "meadow"&mdash;a stretch of ALLUVIAL PLAIN COMMON TO THE MITCHELL AND
THE BARRON RlVERS, the latter of which carries a great volume of water. An
extra high flood in the Barren would send the surplus water of that river down
the Mitchell. The conclusion was inevitable that THE BARRON WAS ONCE actually
THE HEAD OF THE MITCHELL. Geological investigation showed that at no very
remote date (probably Tertiary) this portion of the Barron valley was raised by
the accumulation of thick <i>coul&eacute;es</i> of basaltic lava to a level
which enabled the river to escape through a gap to the east, and this was
followed by the EROSION OF THE STUPENDOUS GORGE commencing at the famous BARRON
FALLS, and THE BARRON BECAME AN INDEPENDENT RIVER, discharging into the Pacific
at Trinity Bay instead of into the Gulf of Carpentaria, as it had previously
done. The RAILWAY line from Cairns, Trinity Bay, to Chillagoe, Mount Mulligan,
the Etheridge and Herberton, now climbs up the southern side of this gorge, and
besides subserving the industrial purposes for which it was designed, carries
crowds of tourists to the Falls, the unrivalled jungle scenery and the health
resorts of the district.</p>
<p>Mulligan struck the left bank of the BARRON on 24th May (CAMP 13) near the
point where the course of the river abruptly changes from north to east.
Without a suspicion that the river was not the Mitchell, he was naturally
amazed that it should still, so far above where he had previously crossed that
river, be a river of so much importance and carry such a large body of water.
Believing it to be the Mitchell he emphatically declared the Mitchell to be
"<i>the</i> river of Queensland."</p>
<p>Mulligan's mistake was strictly comparable with Hann's mistake in following
the Annan River to its head under the impression that he was following the
Endeavour. Both mistakes were not only natural, but inevitable.</p>
<p>Where the BARRON was first met with, Mulligan noted the deep, RICH, fertile
alluvial SOIL, densely covered with SCRUB, or jungle; but regretted that it was
not "the kind of country in which we expect gold." He named the flats "KING'S
PLAINS," after the then Minister for Works, the Hon. H. E. King, but the name
does not appear to have caught on, and the popular appellation of the "BARRON
SCRUB" seems likely to be perpetuated, although the scrub itself has to some
extent been cleared for agriculture, and may in time disappear entirely.</p>
<p>Rain had by this time set in, and the BARRON could not be CROSSED until the
26th May, on which day Mulligan estimated that he made 10 miles to the
south-east, over slate country. It</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 444}</u></p>
<p>may be said here that from the time when he first camped on the Barron till
he reached the head-waters of the Wild River the distances given by him are
either greatly exaggerated, or his course was unusually tortuous. CAMP 14, of
26th May, was some 2 or 3 miles east of the site of BIBOOHRA (now a railway
station). A day and a half spent in prospecting in the neighbourhood of this
camp gave only "colours" of GOLD, although Mulligan judged the country to be
highly favourable for its occurrence in payable quantities. The voices of
NATIVES were heard.</p>
<p>On 28th, 29th and 30th May, the party travelled, mainly southward, for an
estimated distance of 25 miles (say 14 in a direct line) to CAMP 17 on the
BARRON RIVER (which Mulligan calls the Mitchell), at a point about 8 miles
above the present MAREEBA railway junction. (SEE MAP K.) Only "colours" of GOLD
were obtained. "Floating Basalt" was observed (i.e., basalt in horizontal
beds), and a rich chocolate soil.</p>
<p>Although Mulligan's party had not the luck to discover payable GOLD east of
the Barron River, they drew attention to the existence of the metal, and in
1879 a party of miners camped on Tinaroo Creek, actually found it PAYABLE,
although I believe the alluvial gold was soon worked out.</p>
<p>Crossing to the left (or western) bank of the BARRON, 3 miles below Camp 17,
the party, on 1st June, rode 8 miles SSW. "over the best table of basaltic
country that we have yet met; it is of a dark red or chocolate-coloured soil."
Here the edge of the thick scrub barred the way. After a vain attempt to
penetrate the SCRUB, getting stung by the "STINGING TREE" and observing
enormous CEDARS,<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> a NW. by W. course was
followed for 3 miles, when CAMP 18 was made on "a basaltic creek," presumably
one of the branches of ABBOTT'S or GRANITE CREEK.</p>
<p>Rain and the necessity for a preliminary exploration of the scrub delayed
the start till the afternoon of 3rd June, when a NATIVE TRACK leading through a
narrow passage between the scrub and the granite hills on the west was followed
southward for about 4 miles. CAMP 19 was on a grassy flat, "where a creek
enters the scrub, with deep alluvial banks," probably west of the site of
CARBEEN Railway Station. In the scrub gigantic KAURI PINES were observed, and
the superior style of architecture of eleven "townships" of the NATIVES was
commented on. The "townships" were groups of well-thatched gunyahs, each
capable of accommodating five or six persons.</p>
<p>On 4th June, the party first marched for "a few miles" to the south-east,
with the edge of the scrub on their left and the granite range on their right.
When at length the range on the right was observed to recede westward (which
should be about the</p>
<blockquote>[1) A few years later the cedar of this district proved immensely
valuable, and was almost entirely cut out.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 445}</u></p>
<p>site of the modern township of ATHERTON&mdash;a prosperous agricultural
centre), the course was changed to the south-west. The total stage for the day
having been 9 miles, it may be assumed that CAMP 20 was between PRIOR CREEK and
SCRUBBY CREEK and about 2 miles south-west of ATHERTON.</p>
<p>On 5thth June, the general course was 13 degrees west of south, and the
estimated advance 11 miles. Soon after their start, a spur led the travellers
up to the top of GRANITE RIDGES, where, in fact, although they could only guess
at the facts, the WALSH drained the western, the BARRON the northern and
eastern, and the WILD RIVER the southern slopes of the elevation on which they
stood. Had Mulligan been as familiar with southern Scotland as I then was, his
imagination would have transported him to the "Black Larg," where</p>
<p>"Kello, Euchan, Scarr and Ken<br>
A' rin oot o' ae hill&mdash;en!"</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards they found themselves following a river, which after
winding to west and east, began to show a general tendency to fall to the
south. They camped (CAMP 21) on this river, dubious as to their whereabouts,
after a tortuous journey of 11 miles. They were on the WILD RIVER, the main
HEAD OF THE HERBERT RIVER, which, after running about 150 miles to the south
and south-east, discharges into the Pacific opposite the southern end of
Hinchinbrook Island, and they must have been on or near the site of the future
township of MOOMIN.</p>
<p>The WET WEATHER which had set in on 23rd May still continued, and the next
day (6th June) "being Sunday," it soon transpired that all hands were "willing
to camp" for the day, especially as there were six or seven horses to be shod.
The delay gave Mulligan an opportunity for prospecting, and he brought back to
the camp "a fine sample of TIN ORE." He reflected: "There may be any quantity
of it here, but of what use is it at present, considering the price of
carriage? Yet it is well for the future of the Colony to know that there is tin
in this locality, and will no doubt be got in sufficient quantity to pay when
carriage and other facilities are available, the country being opened up."</p>
<p>This prediction has since been amply justified. The TINMINING INDUSTRY which
commenced at HERBERTON, 3 miles down the river from Moomin, and spread out far
to the west, has done even more for the development of northern Queensland than
the discovery of the Palmer Goldfield. In its train has followed the
construction of RAILWAYS from Cairns (Trinity Bay) to Atherton, Herberton, and
Tumoulin, Irvinebank, Stannary Hills, Mount Garnet, Chillagoe, the Etheridge
Goldfield, Mount Molloy and Mount Mulligan, with a total length of about 460
miles, <i>viz.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>The following brief account of the beginnings of the tin Industry is taken
from my first official report "On the Wild River Tin Mines," dated 27th
October, 1880<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"This neighbourhood was described by Mulligan as
stanniferous as much as six years ago,<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> but as
there was then no nearer port than Cooktown, the expense of land carriage
would, of course, have rendered the working of tin unremunerative. The harbours
of Cairns and Port Douglas having, however, at length been opened, and the
basaltic regions in the valleys of the Herbert and Barren having been taken up
in squatting runs, attention was again directed to the tin deposits. Mr.
ATHERTON, of Emerald End, on the Barron, having found stream and surface tin in
sufficient quantities to warrant further prospecting, took up JOHN NEWELL, and
seven others from Tinaroo (about 39 miles off) to the heads of the Wild River
in the latter end of 1879. This party found stream tin in payable quantities in
Prospectors' Gully, on the left bank of the Wild River, near the present
township of Herberton. Four months later, WILLIAM JACK and party explored the
neighbourhood of Prospectors' Gully, and was rewarded by the discovery of the
Great Northern lode. Other lodes were quickly found and taken up by the miners,
who shortly afterwards rushed the ground."</blockquote>
<p>The discoverers of the Great Northern Mine were Jack, Newell, Joss and
Brandon.</p>
<p>It may be added, before concluding this digression, that Messrs. JACK AND
NEWELL shortly afterwards opened a general store at Herberton, with branches in
the various townships which sprung up in the district later on. In the course
of a few years they came to exercise many of the functions of a providence, and
by judicious assistance and credit bestowed on the men who were pioneering the
new field were potent factors in its development. Mr. Newell represented the
district in Parliament for many years. Mr. Jack fell into ill-health, suffering
from a peculiar form of asthma which rendered life impossible for him except in
such hot and humid climates as are to be found in Cairns, Papua or the Celebes.
Even a short stay in the bracing upland atmosphere of Herberton was at last
forbidden to him. He died a few years ago.</p>
<p>Shortly after the discovery of the Great Northern mine, JOHN</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 447}</u></p>
<p>MOFFAT acquired an interest in it, and was instrumental in establishing
tin-dressing machinery thereon. His activities in this direction extended
westward with the progress of the mineral field, and he was prominently
associated with the inception of tin-dressing plants at Irvinebank, Montalbion,
Glen Linedale and California Creek, and with smelting works for lead, silver
and copper at Irvinebank, Montalbion, Glen Linedale and Chillagoe, as well as
at Mount Elliott (Cloncurry) and with the Chillagoe and Etheridge railway
system. In addition to his personal enterprise he was a ready "backer" of any
prospector who professed to be on the trail of discoveries in tin, lead,
silver, copper, bismuth, molybdenite or wolfram. He was frequently spoken of as
the FATHER OF TIN MINING in the north. Prior to his arrival at Herberton, he
had been engaged in alluvial tin mining at Stanthorpe since 1870, and had
erected the smelting works at Tent Hill on the New South Wales side of the
border. Born at Loudon, on the River Irvine, Ayrshire, in 1840, he came to
Queensland in 1862, and died at Toowoomba on 28th June, 1919.<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>When MULLIGAN and his party finally started to follow the WILD RIVER
southward, on 7th June, 1875, Mulligan and Warner inclined to the belief that
it was the head of the Mitchell; that is to say, dominated by the idea that the
Barron was the Mitchell, they imagined that it first flowed southward, then
eastward and northward (the Barron), and finally westward to the Gulf of
Carpentaria. The identity of the Wild River with the Herbert was shortly to be
ascertained, but not by Mulligan, if, indeed, it was not already known to the
"mute, inglorious" bullock-driving pioneers, who by this time had marked a road
from Cardwell to the Palmer.</p>
<p>Passing the site of HERBERTON about 3 miles below their Moomin CAMP, No. 21,
Mulligan traced the windings of the WILD RIVER (now followed by the
HERBERTON-TUMOULIN RAILWAY) for 12 miles, when he camped (CAMP 22) on a track
and markedtree line, running 15 degrees west of north, which he believed to be
the ROAD FROM CARDWELL TO THE PALMER. This would be about a couple of miles
east of the (future) township of NEWELLTON.</p>
<p>Another day's journey of 12 miles, to the south, down the river, on 8th
June, brought the travellers to their last camp (CAMP 23) on the WILD RIVER.
Here they saw some NATIVES, who fled, leaving spears and nets behind. The camp
was probably about 3 miles north of the junction of "THE MILLSTREAM" with the
river.</p>
<p>Although Mulligan had avowed the intention to follow the river "until we
find out what water this is," he left the problem unsolved, and finally turning
his back on the Wild River on 9th June,</p>
<blockquote>[1) For some of the above particulars, I am indebted to a
biographical notice by Sir Robert Philp.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 448}</u></p>
<p>steered south-west for Mount Surprise. In about 5 miles he must have passed
close to the INNOT HOT SPRINGS, on NETTLE CREEK, of which his diary makes no
mention.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> His first camp (CAMP 24) was 16 miles
south-west of Camp 23, on "a very large creek with deep red banks, running
east," evidently RETURN CREEK. No prospecting seems to have been done in Return
Creek, which afterwards became an important producer of stream tin, but
Mulligan remarks on the "rich blue grass, through which we can scarcely force
the horses, they keep eating so." He adds: "I wonder at people being hard up
for country, and all this lying idle here, so near at hand."</p>
<p>NETTLE and RETURN CREEKS were evidently flowing eastward to swell the WILD
RIVER (which below the infall of "The Millstream" is named the HERBERT), and
Mulligan had at last guessed the truth, as he wrote at this camp: "I am now all
but sure that we must have crossed the main range about 7 miles south-west of
the scrub, at the head of this creek, and that we are now on eastern waters,
probably the Herbert River."</p>
<p>On 10th June, the party made 10 miles to the south-west, over nearly flat
country, with swamps and belts in which there was "abundance of POISON PLANT."
CAMP 25 was on what is now called POISON CREEK.</p>
<p>Continuing on the same course, the travellers, on 11th June, crossed
MULLIGAN and EXPEDITION CREEKS near their heads, and crossed the "MAIN DIVIDING
RANGE," almost without being aware of it, probably by what is now called
"DOYLE'S TRACK," and camped (CAMP 26) on the LYND side of the watershed, after
a stage of 12 miles.</p>
<p>It has long been the custom to speak of, and to map, the watershed of the
Cape York Peninsula as the "Great Dividing Range"; but at the actual parting of
the waters there is often no "range" whatever.</p>
<p>A short distance west of Camp 26, Mulligan's track crossed that of
LEICHHARDT, who followed the LYND RIVER down to the west in 1845. This portion
of the journey was accomplished on 12th June, when Mulligan made 15 miles west
by south, and camped on MERO CREEK, a tributary of the Lynd, about 5 miles
below the present ST. RONANS STATION (CAMP 27). His track of this day
practically coincides with the modern TELEGRAPH LINE from Mount Surprise to
Mount Garnet, Newellton and Herberton.</p>
<p>The camp of 13th June (CAMP 28) was 6 miles lower down MERO CREEK (west). In
the course of the day some known LANDMARKS, including MOUNT McDEViTT, MOUNT
SURPRISE and MOUNT FIRTH, were sighted.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The last time I saw Mr. Mulligan was in December, 1906, at the
Innot Springs Hotel, now a favourite health resort. Nettle Creek has yielded
large quantities of stream tin.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 449}</u></p>
<p>On 14th June, after travelling 10 degrees south of west for 9 miles, Firth's
OLD FOSSILBROOK STATION, which by this time had come to be known as the
"Woolshed," was reached. CAMP 29. This was HANN'S STARTING-POINT of 26th June,
1872. Mulligan arrived at Firth's MOUNT SURPRISE STATION on the following day,
and on 16th June, 1875, he rode to JUNCTION CREEK, whence he telegraphed to
Brisbane a short progress report, in which he referred to the DISCOVERY OF TIN.
During his stay at Mount Surprise it was reported that the BLACKS had been
spearing the station horses and in some instances cutting off their legs.</p>
<p>Some of Mulligan's horses became seriously ill after leaving Poison Creek on
11th June. None of them, however, died of the POISON, but some were still
suffering from its effects a fortnight later.</p>

all the way. Spent some time in different camps prospecting. Crossed a granite
range east on to the heads of the Mitchell where in one locality we could get
innumerable colours of gold but no payable prospects. Greatly disappointed in
where we expected to get rough country we found level deep rich alluvial soil
well grassed and well watered over 3,000 square miles in extent interrupted by
mountains. Further south large scrub containing very large cedars and kauri
pine over 150 square miles. Crossed the main range on to the heads of the
Herbert where there is another very large extent of very good level country.
Got stream tin here. Crossed the range again on to the western waters. Crossed
the heads of the Lynd and over to Fossilbrook. Mr. Warner will have the whole
of the country passed over carefully mapped. I have kept a journal well written
up, in which everything is carefully noted, describing grass, soil, formation,
timber, etc. We stop here four days to spell horses sick from eating poison
plant. Do you suggest moving in any other direction?"</blockquote>
<p>The reply, dated Brisbane, 19th June, was:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Secretary for Works wishes you to use your own
discretion as to direction of further exploration, but he thinks you had better
explore south of Cooktown.&mdash;A. O. Herbert."</blockquote>
<p>Probably the above was not the whole of the telegraphic correspondence. In
all likelihood it was at this time that Mulligan asked for a further subsidy of
&pound;500, to enable him to prospect the Hodgkinson, and was refused (see
Heaton's <i>Australian Men of the Time</i>, p. 148). (SEE MAP K.)</p>
<p>The proposed delay of four days at MOUNT SURPRISE was lengthened to
seventeen by the disappearance of some of the horses, which were not recovered
till 2nd July. One HORSE, when found, had become MAD, and it is remarkable that
the Jardine Brothers had noted a similar result to follow the eating of POISON
PLANT.</p>
<p>Other interesting events are recorded by Mulligan: "During our stay at Mount
Surprise, Mr. HANN, Mr. Anning and many others have passed to and from the
Palmer, the former had fat cattle with them for the Palmer. Several parties
belonging to the telegraph contract party have passed during the last few
days." The construction of the TELEGRAPH LINE FROM JUNCTION CREEK TO THE
PALMER, along Hann's return track of 1872, was already in progress.</p>
<p>On 3rd July, the party LEFT MOUNT SURPRISE Station, following the Palmer
Road north-north-west past MOUNT McDEViTT to Hann's Camp 85. "What a
difference," writes Mulligan, "there is in travelling on the road compared with
through the bush!...No road here when last I came, only the track we made!"</p>
<p>Mulligan LEFT THE PALMER ROAD at his CAMP No. 33 between Hann's Camps 84 and
85, early on 6th July, and struck at first 10 degrees south of west. After
travelling about (prospecting creeks and gullies, in which he got "colours only
"), in a general north-west direction, for 11 miles, he camped on the northern
or Tate side of the divide between that river and the Lynd. CAMP 34.</p>
<p>Next day (7th July), after making about 4 miles<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> of northing,</p>
<blockquote>[1) The diary says "travelled 9 miles." The <i>route</i> must have
been circuitous.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 452}</u></p>
<p>he camped on the TATE RIVER opposite the mouth of REVOLVER CREEK. CAMP 35.
In the afternoon the river was prospected in the vicinity of the camp, and
"numerous colours of GOLD and a fair sample of TIN ORE" were obtained.</p>
<p>The TATE RIVER was followed down westward for 9 miles on 8th July and CAMP
36 was fixed a quarter of a mile above the infall of BLACK GIN CREEK. The
afternoon's prospecting in the river showed both GOLD and TIN, but the gold was
only represented byslight colours and the tin was not so plentiful as at the
previous camp or as in Black Gin Creek 20 miles above its junction with the
Tate.</p>
<p>[Mulligan had previously camped on BLACK GIN CREEK, first on 22nd June, 1873
(Camp 6) and second on 28th August, 1873, on his first trip to the Palmer. It
must have been at his Camp 6 that he had noted the occurrence of tin, although
the diary says nothing of it. He was, of course, under no obligation to
disclose the discovery.]</p>
<p>Three miles west of Camp 36, on 9th July, Mulligan crossed the water-course
which Hann had named PINT POT CREEK, and prospected it for GOLD, but only got
"colours of the finest description." On this he remarks (having forgotten the
JARDINE BROTHERS): "We are now OUTSIDE ALL TRAVELLERS, OLD LEICHHARDT
EXCEPTED." In the course of the day the party followed the river down westward
for 10 miles, to CAMP 37. The sand of the river bed was covered with the
footprints of NATIVES, and in one place Mulligan lighted on an accumulation of
their property, consisting of shells, nets, chalk, dilly-bags and bags of
resin, besides IRON NAILS AND SPIKES, the metallic articles showing that some
of the blacks had travelled. CAMP 37A, of 10th July, was on the right or north
bank of the TATE, at its junction with the LYND.</p>
<p>Mulligan had now traversed the Tate from the Mount SurprisePalmer road to
its junction with the Lynd, thus CONNECTING HANN'S WORK WITH LEICHHARDT'S. He
had already explored a higher portion of the valley (between his Camps 4 and 5)
on his first trip to the Palmer.</p>
<p>Between his Camps 35 and 37A, he had mainly travelled on the left, or
southern, bank, when not actually in the bed of the river. He describes the
river itself as flowing over Palaeozoic or Metamorphic rocks, while on his
left, i.e., to the south, was a tableland of horizontal sandstone, broken into
or cut through by Pint Pot and other creeks. There can be no doubt that the
northern side of the river, which he did not see, was of a similar
structure.</p>
<p>Mulligan and others had often speculated on the possibility of finding a
more direct ROAD FROM THE ETHERIDGE TO THE PALMER than the roundabout one which
goes ENE. from Georgetown to Fossilbrook and then follows Hann's return
<i>route</i> (Camps 76 to 88) northward to Palmerville. With the object of
solving this problem, Mulligan, accompanied by Warner and Moran, penetrated</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 453}</u></p>
<p>16 miles to the west of Camp 37A, but saw only a very rough and uninviting
sandstone country. Returning by a more northerly <i>route</i>, the LYND was
struck and followed up to the infall of the TATE. In the Lynd valley a few
miles below the junction, they came on an old native camp and charred human
remains which were unmistakable evidence of a cannibal repast. Returning to
Camp 37A, a move was made about a mile to the south-east to better feed on the
left bank of the TATE. CAMP 38, 13th July.</p>
<p>Since Mulligan's time, a better and shorter road from the Etheridge to the
Palmer has come into use, without going so far west. It leaves Georgetown and
crosses the Einasleigh at Dagworth Station; crosses the Lynd near the mouth of
Rocky Creek (Hann's Camp 5); and joins the old road at the Tate Telegraph
Station, whence it follows Hann's return track and the telegraph line to
Palmerville.</p>
<p>The caravan left CAMP 38 on 14th July. As Leichhardt had followed the Lynd,
Mulligan elected to keep further east, on "that solid block lying between the
Walsh and this river," as no white man had yet been there. On a north-westerly
course, over a tableland of horizontally bedded sandstone, he struck the right
bank of the LYND, which here runs a little west of north, in 23 miles, and then
followed the river for 7 miles to CAMP 40, 15th July. (SEE MAP G.)</p>
<p>On 16th July, Mulligan followed the right bank of the LYND down for 15
miles, to CAMP 41, Leichhardt having kept the left bank. A creek falling into
the river, it is said, "might be Hann's Nonda Creek." The remark might be
misinterpreted to mean that Mulligan identified it with that creek, but he
probably meant only to convey that in soil and vegetation there was a
resemblance. Nonda Creek is 35 miles to the east, and falls into the Walsh.
(SEE MAP H.)</p>
<p>THE JUNCTION OF THE LYND WITH THE MlTCHELL, 25 miles from Camp 41, was
reached on 18th July. CAMP 43. The party caught some fine fish (Barramundi) and
indulged in the new sport of ALLIGATOR SHOOTING. It was observed that "the
BLACKS' MARKS on the trees in all this locality have been made with very sharp
instruments, quite as broad as a half-axe." It is more than probable that the
marks in question were made by HANN, who had camped on the same spot on 21st
July, 1872. LEICHHARDT'S CAMP, on the Lynd, of 15th June, 1845, was barely 2
miles to the south.</p>
<p>On a course of 15 to 20 degrees east of north, the expedition travelled 29
miles in two days (20th and 21st July) and camped on the 21st on "a beautiful
shallow creek" running to the west. CAMP 45. The land was "of the poorest
description, all thickly timbered with tea tree and other bush resembling
brigalow." "Many of the flats," says Mulligan, "are now boggy. I do not think
it would be possible to travel this country in wet weather.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 454}</u></p>
<p>There is nothing remarkable about this country, nor are there any landmarks;
I have not seen a mountain, nor a hill, peak or anything of the kind, since we
left the Tate River."<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> (SEE MAP G.) "It may be
considered," he adds, "one continual scrub of either tea tree or brigalows
right over from the Mitchell to the Palmer." On the third day (22nd July),
however, bloodwood and stringybark trees made their appearance, and in 8 miles
from Camp 45 the PALMER RIVER was crossed and CAMP 46 was pitched on its
northern or right bank.<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> "The formation," says
Mulligan, "is granite. The arenaceous rocks, or Desert Sandstone, we have now
left far behind us, and the siliceous drifts with the beautiful rounded quartz
pebbles seen in the Palmer would be sufficient to induce us to proceed further
up, did we not know that it has been already worked." MOUNT DAINTREE was
identified by bearings taken from a slight elevation west of the camp. To the
north-east were seen the cliffs forming the western boundary of the
"CONGLOMERATE" TABLELAND, the top of the cliffs here forming the WATERSHED
between the GULF and the PACIFIC.</p>
<p>On 26th July, the party left CAMP 46 and travelled 10 miles to 10 degrees
north of east. CAMP 47 was on SARAGA CREEK. In this neighbourhood, prospecting
operations were conducted among "rough quartz ridges," but the prospectors
"couldn't raise the colour anywhere."</p>
<p>Owing to the straying of horses, the party did not get away from SARAGA
CREEK till 30th July, when they travelled about 10 miles to the north-east.
CAMP 48 must have been near what is shown on the map as the ANNIE RIVER. "A
vast number of BLACKS' TOWNSHIPS" were observed on this day's march, and it was
inferred that the blacks were wont to camp in this region during the season
when the nonda fruit was ripe.</p>
<p>It was now the intention of the party to make for the COLEMAN RIVER, Hann's
Journal having given them the idea that there was auriferous country which it
might be worth their while to prospect. They started accordingly for the
Coleman on 31st July, but had only gone a mile and a half to the north-west
when their minds were made up that the way lay plain and easy before them. A
consultation was held, and, "to make a long story short," it was
resolved:&mdash;</p>
<p>That they now knew their way to the Coleman;</p>
<p>That, if unsuccessful in their mission there, they might have to stay for
some time;</p>
<p>That they were short of many things with which it was expedient to supply
themselves before getting out of touch with Palmerville;</p>
<blockquote>[1) The cliffs bounding the sandstone tableland were apparently the
only noteworthy features of the landscape.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Opposite the Benchmark T1, P3, shown on the map as the "Initial
Point" of "Co. Strathleven."]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 455}</u></p>
<p>That their sextant might be repaired at the township;</p>
<p>That in these circumstances it was expedient to VISIT PALMERVILLE before
setting out for the Coleman.</p>
<p>The "right about face" to the north-east was immediately effected, and in 12
miles from Camp 48 the party camped on BIG CREEK. CAMP 49. Prospecting for GOLD
on the day's journey yielded "no show."</p>
<p>In 10 miles to the east, on the following day (1st August), CAMP 50 was
pitched on the right bank of the PALMER RIVER, between Fernhill and Glenroy
Creeks. Shortly after leaving Camp 49 the party crossed "MACMILLAN'S ROAD" from
Frome on the Palmer, <i>via</i> the Kennedy River, to Cooktown. It had already
come to be known as "Macmillan's Old Road," owing to the general use of the
newer road up the Little Kennedy to Palmerville, which is now followed by the
telegraph line.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>In the afternoon, Mulligan went up the river to PALMERVILLE (about 7 miles)
for his mail.</p>
<p>The replenishment of the supply of provisions, horse-shoeing, the death of a
horse, and the recuperation of the others on good grass, filled up the time
till 11th August, when the party moved down the river 4 miles to the site of
HANN'S CAMP of 9th August, 1872. CAMP 51.</p>
<p>ABELSON AND MORAN were DETACHED from the main party at PALMERVILLE and went
up the river to prospect for REEFS. I am unable to give any account of their
success, but it is probable that the start of the REEF-GOLD MINING in the
neighbourhood of MAYTOWN was due, at least in part, to their explorations, as
these reefs began to be producers of GOLD in 1876.</p>
<p>On 12th August, 9 miles were accomplished, partly down the PALMER, partly by
"MACMILLAN'S OLD ROAD," which was now disused, and then north-westward along
the foot of the CONGLOMERATE RANGE to CAMP 52.</p>
<p>The base of the range was followed on the same course for 10 miles, over
granite country, on 13th August. CAMP 53 was on "a little creek, with plenty of
water," on which was HANN'S CAMP 21, of 21st August, 1872. Mulligan himself had
been thus far on 3rd October, 1874, when he was driven by the scarcity of water
to return to Palmerville, abandoning for the time his intention of penetrating
to the Coleman.</p>
<p>The expedition diverged on 14th August a few degrees west of Hann's track.
In 4 miles they mounted a low SANDSTONE TABLELAND, which they followed for the
remainder of the day. The stage was a long one, 21 miles having to be covered
before water was found in a spring at the head of a ravine. CAMP 54.. (SEE MAP
E.)</p>
<blockquote>[1) Macmillan came from Cooktown by what was afterwards named the
"new" road and returned by the "old" road.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 456}</u></p>
<p>The spring appears to have marked the base of the sandstone where it rested
on granite, as the diary of 15th August refers only to granite, which Mulligan
was anxious to get out of, because, in his opinion, a change to slate like that
of the Palmer would give him a better chance of getting gold. Still keeping
north-west, he gained 7 miles, and in the granite he "could not raise the
colour" of gold. The "ravine" was followed down for a mile, when it was left,
as it went too far west. Another creek was crossed, running west, and next a
creek was met with, and followed, as it kept the desired north-western course.
CAMP 55 was formed where this creek fell into a larger one (called the ALICE
RIVER on the 4-mile map) coming from the east. (SEE MAP F.)</p>
<p>On 17th August, Mulligan followed the river down for 6 miles to west and an
equal distance to north-west, crossing, in so doing, the area of 100 square
miles now officially known as the PHILP GOLDFIELD, and dismissing the day's
journey with the brief remark: "No show for gold." CAMP 56 was on the western
boundary of the field.</p>
<p>The goldfield was originally named the Alice River Goldfield, but the
genuine and original ALICE RIVER was that tributary of the Mitchell on which
the BROTHERS JARDINE pitched their 44th Camp on 18th December, 1864, and fought
the so-called "Battle of the Mitchell," and which has been traced by
"run-surveys" up to longitude 142&deg; 53' E. and latitude 15&deg; 55' S., or
70 miles above the Jardines' Camp. There can be little doubt that the so-called
Alice of the goldfield falls into the real Alice at the meridian of 142&deg;
14' E., through the medium of the unnamed water-course which runs westward
along the parallel of 15&deg; 30' S., and this river should be named the
PHILP.</p>
<p>Mulligan followed the PHILP RIVER down to the west for 5 miles on 18th
August, when, finding that it turned south-west, he left it and resumed his
course of W. 40&deg; N. In 6 miles in this direction, he camped on a large
creek with deep water-holes. CAMP 57.</p>
<p>The "large creek" was followed down for 2 miles, 10 degrees to the north of
east, on 19th August, when it ran into a still larger creek, "quite a river, in
fact," which was named FAHEY CREEK, after the Hon. B. Fahey, at that time
Sub-Collector of Customs, Cooktown. The name was officially recognised, and
appeared in a map of Queensland showing the proposed Transcontinental Railway,
in 1880, but the 16-mile map of Queensland, 1899, and the 4-mile map, 1910,
name the river ETHEL CREEK. When, or by whom, or for what reason, the
alteration was made, I am unable to conjecture, but Mulligan's name should be
restored to FAHEY CREEK.</p>
<p>After running Fahey Creek down for 1 mile to the west, Mulligan left it
running south-west and resumed his own course of W. 40&deg; N. In this
direction he travelled for 10 miles, when he pitched CAMP 58 on "a creek, with
water-holes, running SW." This was CROSBIE</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 457}</u></p>
<p>CREEK, which I named on 6th December, 1879, and followed down westward from
my Camp No 4 (second trip) to a point about 21 miles above Mulligan's Camp
58.</p>
<p>From Crosbie Creek, Mulligan travelled 11 miles to W. 40&deg; N. on 20th
August. His CAMP 59 was on "a fine creek; deep banks and fair grass." This was
one of the large creeks falling southward to the Philp River, into which it
falls just west of the meridian of 142&deg; 30' E.</p>
<p>The nature of the land is summed up by Mulligan in a few disparaging
sentences: "We have the ever-present teatree and brigalow scrubs...Every now
and then numerous colonies of ants appear, generally built on some boggy
flat...No LANDMARKS in this part of the country; have not seen any elevation
for many days; the country is quite flat. We make it a rule to camp on the
first water or good camp we come to after midday."</p>
<p>On 21st August, CAMP 60 was pitched 12 miles W. 40&deg; N. of Camp 59, and
half a mile north of "a scrubby creek, running west." This was at last on
COLEMAN WATERS, and the creek was the one which, after running west along the
15th parallel of south latitude, falls into the left, or southern, bank of the
Coleman in 142&deg; 11' E. latitude. The parting of the Mitchell and Coleman
waters had been imperceptible, but till quite near Camp 60 the water-courses
crossed had been falling to the south towards the Philp River.</p>
<p>Seven miles,<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> following the same course,
brought the party, on 22nd August, to "a creek with large water-holes," which
proved, on further acquaintance, to be an ANABRANCH OF THE COLEMAN, and Camp 61
was made. Next day the anabranch was followed to the east for 2 miles, and Camp
62 was selected as affording good grass for the horses.</p>
<p>On 25th August, 2&frac12; miles to the east brought the party to the point
where the anabranch left the COLEMAN. The river itself was then followed up for
11&frac12; miles to the east, and CAMP 63 was pitched on the northern, or
right, bank. The river was broad and sandy, with four channels, and its banks
carried very large fan palms.</p>
<p>On 26th August, 7 miles east of Camp 63, the river was observed to receive a
large branch coming from the north. This branch, which was crossed again,
higher up, on 4th September, Mulligan then designated the KING RIVER. Three
miles to the east, after crossing the King River, CAMP 64 was made on a
"billybong," or anabranch, of the Coleman, where there was not only good grass
for the horses, but plenty of wildfowl for the men. Tracks and old camps of the
NATIVES were very numerous. As for the main object of the expedition, "a perch
or so of stony surface "and some <i>[1) Mulligan says 11. The monotony of this
region had bored him to such a pitch that he unconsciously over-estimated the
weary miles.</i></p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 458}</u></p>
<p>quartz pebbles gave indications that they were approaching a country where
prospecting for gold might be possible.</p>
<p>On 27th August, a progress of 12 miles was made, a little to the north of
east. "A deep creek running south towards the Coleman" was crossed. This was
DISMAL CREEK, which I followed on 11th December, 1879 (Camps 5 and 6, second
trip). Mulligan's Camp 65 was 2 miles east of Dismal Creek on a quartz ridge,
in a country of "light micaceous-slate," several similar ridges having been
crossed in the course of the day. After camping, the party "worked hard on the
REEFS and in the gullies," prospecting for gold, but "could not raise the
colour."</p>
<p>On 28th August, the party left the river, which went too far south, and
steered 20 degrees south of east for 6 miles, prospecting for gold at
intervals, but without success. The course was then altered to a little north
of east, in the direction of a range of low hills, and in 4 miles CAMP 66 was
pitched. After camping, Mulligan and Warner climbed the hills, which they found
to be composed of "hypersthenic granite." They were near the western end of the
low range, the eastern end of which, near their Camp 26, HANN AND TAYLOR had
visited on 27th August, 1872, when they found the formation to be mica-schist
in which garnets were numerous, and which contained many QUARTZ REEFS. As
Mulligan remained in camp on the following day, Warner took the sun at noon and
determined the latitude to be 14&deg; 49' S. It was really about 14&deg; 55',
but a sun-observation in these latitudes, with a bucket of water for horizon,
could not be expected to give very accurate results.</p>
<p>Near the camp, the black boy pointed out the tracks, only a few weeks old,
of shod horses, and a tent-peg was found, and it was evident that the explorers
were not the first WHITE MEN on the ground. Prospecting for gold in the
neighbourhood of this camp was entirely unsuccessful.</p>
<p>On 30th August, Mulligan steered 24 degrees east of south for some conical
hills. CAMP 67, 6 miles from Camp 66, was pitched on the south side of the
COLEMAN RIVER at the foot of the hills in question. The hills proved to be of
mica-schist, but prospecting operations met with no success.</p>
<p>Nine of the horses were missing on the morning of 31st August, and while
they were being searched for, Mulligan prospected for 3 miles up the river and
camped. CAMP 68. "Quartz reefs and wash plentiful, but this schistone rock is
not indicative of gold."</p>
<p>The party travelled 8 miles to W. 40&deg; N. next day and pitched CAMP 69 a
little west of Camp 66. Near the latter they saw "an old and very large camp of
some large party," who had travelled 20 degrees to the east of south. "We
suppose it," says Mulligan, "to have been the PRINCESS CHARLOTTE BAY
PARTY."<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) I have met with no record of this party's
explorations.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 459}</u></p>
<p>Having given the Coleman a fair trial, and satisfied himself that it was not
the alluvial goldfield which he had dreamed of for years, Mulligan steered W.
35&deg; N., on 2nd September, for some hills seen in the distance. In 5 miles
he got among the hills, and camped 2 miles further on. CAMP 70. He "had an
opportunity of seeing a great number of QUARTZ REEFS of enormous size,
abundance of ironstone and iron in the quartz, which really looks auriferous,
and would be so did any eruptive belt travel this micaceous slate (slate has
now set in)." Prospecting was rewarded, however, only by "colours" of GOLD.</p>
<p>On 3rd September, "a large branch of the Coleman, quite as big as the
Coleman itself, was passed in a mile and a half from Camp 70 on a course of W.
35&deg; N. It did not look promising, and gave "no colours" on prospecting.
[This was DISMAL CREEK, up which I travelled (Camps 5 to 6) on 11th December,
1879.&mdash;R.L.J.] After 5&frac12; miles on the same course and 3 to N.
20&deg; W., through good pastoral country, CAMP 71 was pitched, on "a pretty
slate, but too light; REEFS of unusually good appearance for gold in all
directions, and THERE OUGHT TO BE GOLD in this vicinity." The party "tried
hard" for some hours next morning; as the result is not stated, it was
presumably negative or insufficient.</p>
<p>On 4th September, on a N. 35&deg; W. course, CAMP 72 was pitched on a river
150 to 300 yards wide, which Mulligan named the KING, after the Honourable H.
E. King, Minister for Works and Mines. Mulligan had crossed the same river,
between Camps 63 and 64, on 26th August. I crossed the river (Camp 6 to 7,
second trip) on 12th December, 1879, 5 miles higher up, and had previously
crossed it (Camps 43 to 44, first trip), 25 miles higher up on 20th September,
1879. HANN ran it down from its head (Camps 27 to 28) on 30th August, 1872, and
crossed it 5 miles above my crossing of 20th September, 1879.</p>
<p>Of this day's journey, Mulligan says: "I never saw so many good-looking
REEFS without gold in the gullies," and he resolved to prospect the
neighbourhood. This was done next day, both to south-west and north-east of the
camp. "Both parties got colours of GOLD; this is auriferous country." In the
river itself, the wash was too deep for efficient prospecting.</p>
<p>From a hill south-east of the camp, Mulligan observed "a notable landmark,"
bearing 43&deg;, which he took to be HANN'S MOUNT NEWBERY. If the conjecture
was correct, which it probably was, Mount Newbery must be the elevation now
named MOUNT RYAN on the 4-mile map.</p>
<p>On 6th September, the party went north for 8 miles, and camped (CAMP 73) on
the divide between the KING AND HOLROYD RIVERS. The country looked promising
for gold, but the prospectors "got no show." The camp was just inside the
boundary-line of the HAMILJTON GOLDFIELD of to-day.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 460}</u></p>
<p>On 7th September, a progress of 13 miles was made to N. 13&deg; W., down a
fertile valley between green hills. "This is," says Mulligan, "SPLENDID COUNTRY
FOR SQUATTERS, open forest, well grassed in all directions. The country has
been lately burnt, and the new blue grass is long. The horses mow it down and
will soon pull up for past starvation from the Mitchell to the Palmer and in
that miserable country south of the King. At one time I had thought that the
western slopes of the Gulf were all poor sterile country, but now I see
different. What a change! How far this country will continue, I do not know. It
is a pity to be influenced and only interested in the one indefatigable search
for gold, which is the chief object and the only one of any consequence to me.
I remember a time when my knowledge of this country could have been turned to
profitable account for myself, but now there is no inducement to explore and
see the extent of such fine country as this. We will stop to-morrow to examine
this river a little, and will then return. It is only FUTILE LOOKING FOR GOLD
in such deep alluvial country."</p>
<p>The river alluded to, and on which Mulligan pitched his CAMP 74, was larger
than the King, and he named it the LUKIN, after Gresly Lukin, proprietor of the
<i>Queenslander</i> newspaper, which had published his previous
reports&mdash;not the least of its services to the pastoral and mining
industries.</p>
<p>The grassy valley which I named the MACDONALD (Camps 8 to 9) on 15th
December, 1879, lies about 4 miles east of the valley by which Mulligan
approached the "Lukin" River.</p>
<p>One hundred and thirty miles to the west of Mulligan's Camp 74, the JARDINE
BROTHERS had crossed a river which they named the HOLROYD (Camps 52 to 54) on
28th December, 1864, and traverses and run-surveys connected with the pastoral
occupation of the country subsequent to Mulligan's, and my own, journeys, leave
no room for doubt that MULLIGAN'S LUKIN is identical with the JARDINES'
HOLROYD. The river has many mouths. Mulligan was too far from the west coast of
the Peninsula to attempt the identification of his river with that of the
Jardine Brothers.</p>
<p>Mulligan had now, as he believed, exhausted the last chance of finding a new
goldfield north of the Palmer. He had, indeed, found traces of alluvial gold on
both the Holroyd and Coleman Rivers, but not enough, in his opinion, to be
payable; as well as numerous quartz reefs between the Coleman and the King,
though these, as far as his own observation went, appeared to be practically
barren of gold. His Camp 74 was actually within the limits of the FUTURE
HAMILTON GOLDFIELD, but the surroundings of the camp were not sufficiently
promising. He therefore determined to turn back and MAKE FOR COOKTOWN. As it
had been his dream for years to get to the Coleman, which he pictured to
himself as a Promised Land or an El Dorado, the decision must</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 461}</u></p>
<p>have been a painful one. It must, however, be admitted that HANN, the only
previous visitor, had held out no hope. Mulligan reasoned that on the Coleman
there was rough country, apparently of a geological formation favourable to the
occurrence of gold, and that as Hann had been unduly pessimistic or timid
regarding the Palmer, he might have been equally so regarding the Coleman.</p>
<p>Leaving Camp 74 on 9th September, Mulligan and his companions struck east,
at some distance from the HOLROYD RIVER (which here comes from the east), with
the object of rounding the hills which form the western wall of the MACDONALD
VALLEY. Mulligan was evidently out of sight of the Coleman, which he believed
to come from the north. In fact, he took for the main river the branch which I
followed up from its confluence with the Holroyd on 15th December, 1879 (Camps
8 to 9, second trip). Having cleared these hills in 4 miles, he altered his
course to the south-east. In 8 miles in this course, he crossed the granitic
WATERSHED BETWEEN THE HOLROYD AND KING, and saw, 7 degrees to the east of
south, what he took to be HANN'S MOUNT NEWBERY. In this conjecture he was, I
believe, correct, and if so, Mount Newbery is the elevation east of Yarraden
Town Reserve, which is given on the Queensland 4-mile map as MOUNT RYAN. Four
miles further to the south-east, he camped on good grass on the King waters.
CAMP 75.</p>
<p>The KING RIVER was crossed from right to left I mfle to E. 25&deg; 5' on
10th September. Here NATIVES were heard making a "hideous din," but the cause
of the commotion was not explained. This crossing of the river was 10 miles
below my crossing (Camps 43 to 44, first trip) of 20th September, and 15 miles
above my crossing (Camps 6 to 7, second trip) of 12th December, 1879. On the
same course 6 miles more brought the party to "a very nice sugarloaf, of good
height, which we climbed, and named it MOUNT WALSH, after John Walsh,
Cooktown." This mount lay about 7 miles south of the mountain supposed by
Mulligan to be Harm's Mount Newbery.</p>
<p>About 4 miles E. 25&deg; S. of Mount Walsh, my Camp 44 (first trip, 20th
September, 1879) was close to Mulligan's track. One mile further, Mulligan
passed the southern boundary-line of the present HAMILTON GOLDFIELD. Fifteen
miles from Camp 75, CAMP 76 was pitched on a creek which Mulligan believed to
be "the extreme head of the COLEMAN." The creek was prospected, but NO GOLD was
found. Here a white-haired NATIVE was surprised. He was carrying a bundle of
spears and instinctively "drew his throwing-stick "on the appearance of the
white men, but ultimately retreated, "looking back occasionally and uttering
inarticulate words of horror."</p>
<p>Still keeping the same course (E. 25&deg; S.), on 11th September the party
crossed, 4 miles from Camp 76, a low granite tableland, which proved to be the
WATERSHED OF THE CAPE YORK PENINSULA,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 462}</u></p>
<p>and, leaving the Gulf waters, descended to those of the Pacific, and pitched
CAMP 77 on "a big creek" 6 miles from the summit. (SEE MAP E.) The CAPE YORK
TELEGRAPH LINE now runs from south to north along the eastern side of the low
watershed.</p>
<p>From Camp 77 to Camp 84, the travellers were on a level country forming part
of the COASTAL PLAIN south of Princess Charlotte Bay, and there was nothing to
prevent them keeping a straight course (E. 30&deg; 5'), and no inducement to
diverge.</p>
<p>CAMP 79 (13th September) was on SALTWATER CREEK, already "quite a river."
This camp was 11 miles above my Camp 32 (4th September, 1879, first trip),
which I believe to have been on the site of Kennedy's of 6th October, 1848. The
country is described by Mulligan as "light, sandy and poor, teatree scrubs,
stringybark and grass trees, occasionally honeysuckle and nonda flats, all of
which must be boggy and almost impossible to travel in the wet season...Nowhere
have I seen so many camps and fresh tracks of the NATIVES as here; they must be
numerous. What a number of fresh-made paths round the little lagoons and on the
creek! We sprang a plant of theirs which was a regular curiosity shop,
containing an empty sardine box, jam-pot, hammer made of stone, tomahawk ground
out of a piece of inch iron, chalk, gum, beeswax, nets (large and small), any
quantity of well-made twine, shells, etc., etc...Observed that the blacks build
little gunyahs, in the shape of a marquee, to protect themselves from the
mosquitoes; they cover them with teatree bark and rope them down with straw,
exactly in the shape of a haystack, having a hole in the side, one foot square,
to go in at." Nor were traces of the presence of WHITE MEN wanting. Three miles
short of Saltwater Creek, a track made by horses, and only a few weeks old, was
observed going 20&deg; east of north, and close to the creek, horse tracks only
a few days old were seen going south. I am unable to identify the party to whom
these horses belonged, but it is evident that the movement which led to the
opening of the Coen Goldfield in 1876 had already commenced. According to the
information given to me in Cooktown in 1879, a party of fifteen men left
Cooktown in 1876, and split up into two parties about the Coen, and the party
left there discovered gold about September of the same year. The tracks seen by
Mulligan must have been made by a still earlier party.</p>
<p>On 15th September, 16 miles from Camp 79, Mulligan crossed "a large river
running to the east of north," with "a great body of water in long reaches,"
and named it the HANN. The river was crossed below the infall of the MOREHEAD
RIVER, which was named in 1886 during the construction of the Cape York
Telegraph Line.</p>
<p>Five miles further, Mulligan gave the name of the WARNER to another "very
large river running north."..."This river has</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 463}</u></p>
<p>got deep water in it, and a large, strong, running stream, big timber, and
fertile, well-grassed banks." It now figures on the 4-mile map as STATION
CREEK. There is, or was, a station (Walwa) further down the creek, at Kennedy's
Camp of 30th September, 1848, but the restitution of Mulligan's name, the
Warner, is to be recommended. There must be some hundreds of "Station Creeks"
in Queensland.</p>
<p>According to my reading of Carron's narrative, KENNEDY travelled northward,
a few miles east of the HANN RIVER, and then dropped down to, and followed, the
WARNER till he was satisfied that he was on waters discharging into Princess
Charlotte Bay.</p>
<p>Fifteen miles beyond the Warner, Mulligan camped on "a large creek," with
"conglomerate-like banks and a deep small stream," which appears in the
Queensland 4-mile map as the "NORTH KENNEDY RIVER." (CAMP 81. 15th September.)
As the water-course in question is west, not north, of the Kennedy River, the
name is misleading, and should be altered. I propose that the name Therrimburi
Creek, applied to the head of the water-course, be extended to the whole of it.
There are already on the map, within 18 miles from west to east, a "North
Kennedy River," a "Kennedy River," a "Little Kennedy River" and a "Kennedy
Creek." Respect for the memory of the unfortunate Kennedy does not justify the
confusion of the map.</p>
<p>Nine miles further on his course, Mulligan reached the KENNEDY RIVER (CAMP
82, 16th September), which, he says, has "deep and scrubby banks, with big
timber on both sides; the river is going 50&deg; E. of N. I have very little
doubt of this being the KENNEDY RIVER, as named by Kennedy, the explorer, who
ran it up to Princess Charlotte Bay; it is not so large as the River Warner."
He was wrong in this. Kennedy did not himself name the river; after his death
it appeared on maps first as "Kennedy's River," and later on as the "Kennedy
River." There is every reason to believe that Kennedy only saw some of its
insignificant heads and that his northward track was further west.</p>
<p>Sixteen miles further, threading his way among swamps and lagoons covered
with wild-fowl, the water-course now shown on the map as "Kennedy Creek" having
apparently not been recognisable as a distinct entity, he crossed the LAURA
RIVER (CAMP 84, 18th September) 20 miles north of the present railway terminus.
From this point, a north-east course of 5 miles took him across the chord of
the bow formed by the junction of the LAURA with the NORMANBY, and he then
followed the PalmervilleCooktown road for 12 miles, and fixed his CAMP 85 (19th
September) in the vicinity of HANN'S CAMP 41, near the Battle Camp Range.
COOKTOWN was reached on 23rd September, 1875, and on the following day Mulligan
reported the safe arrival of the party to the Minister for Works and Mines.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 464}</u></p>
<h4>A SIXTH EXPEDITION</h4>
<p>TWO of the documents recently discovered by Mr. Brady among the records of
the Department of Works show that Mulligan, accompanied by Warner, made a sixth
exploration between 21st October, 1875, and 7th March, 1876.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"COOKTOWN, 21st October, 1875.<br>
<br>
"SIR,<br>

the absence of Mr. Reid. I also regret to state that I am unable, through want
of funds, to proceed to Brisbane, as I intended.<br>
<br>
"I have therefore thought it better to accompany Mr. Mulligan on a further

supplying the Government with further valuable information.<br>

<br>
<p>"I have, etc.,<br>
<br></p>
<p>JAMES V. MULLIGAN."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No report of the prospecting trip referred to has ever come under my notice.
It is certain that none was officially published. The "NEW GOLDFIELD" was the
HODGKINSON. A few particulars are given in Heaton's <i>Australian Men of the
Time</i>.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"They [Mulligan's party] then applied for a further
grant of &pound;500 to allow them to prospect the Hodgkinson, a river he found
and named after one of the northern representatives, then in the Legislative
Assembly. Mulligan was refused the request, so he and two others set out with
full supplies necessary at the time, as the Mitchell River, which they had to
cross, was much swollen, and not crossable again for four months, so that they
were during this time cut off from civilisation. A few of their old mates also
came to a branch of the Hodgkinson the same time, and, after being there about
six weeks, came upon them one evening at twilight, and opened fire upon them,
thinking they were blacks, neither party realising the proximity of the other.
After this they became friends and then returned to Cooktown, where they
reported PAYABLE GOLD, March 9, 1876. The Government again gave the party
&pound;1,000 reward."</blockquote>
<p>It is generally understood that the party found by Mulligan on the occasion
referred to by Heaton consisted of Robert Sefton, W. McLeod and Hugh Kennedy.
Terms were arranged whereby</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 465}</u></p>
<p>Mulligan's party and the other party were to merge their claims and share
the reward.</p>
<p>In a list of prospecting parties assisted by the Government, the
Under-Secretary for Mines mentions (Ann. Rept. for 1880) the return of Mulligan
and party to Thornborough from the heads of the JOHNSTON, HERBERT AND BURDEKIN
in 1880. No record of the tour has come under my notice. In the Annual Report
of the Department of Mines for 1881, Mulligan and party's return to
Thornborough in June from another trip is referred to, and they are stated to
have been unsuccessful as regards gold, but to have found tin in several
places. The district traversed is not even indicated.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Mulligan was born in County Down, Ireland, on 13th
February, 1837. He arrived in Melbourne in 1859 and was anxious to join the
exploring expedition of Burke and Wills (1860), but was disappointed. He
afterwards came to New South Wales and spent some time on the Peel River
goldfield; thence went to New England, and there spent about ten years in
store-keeping, inn-keeping, butchering, 'seeking for ijold, etc. He came to
Queensland with the Gympie rush in 1867."<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<p>Since then, till his death at Mount Molloy on 24th August, 1907, his
services were confined to Queensland.</p>
<p>The portrait in this volume was taken a year or two prior to his death.
Unfortunately I have been unable to procure one showing the man as he was in
his prime, and when his name was a household word in Queensland. I met him at
intervals between 1880 and 1906.</p>
<p>The loyalty and trust which Mulligan invariably inspired among the men he
led depended in great measure upon a personal charm of character which made it
a pleasure to be in his company. He had a kindly heart, a gleam of humour and a
quiet persistence :apable of overcoming the most formidable obstacles.</p>

<p>In 1876, a party of fifteen men went out to prospect the Peninsula, and
split up in the neighbourhood of the future TOWNSHIP OF COEN into three
parties, one remaining on the ground. This party, consisting of ROBERT SEFTON,
SAM VERGE, &mdash; WATSON and &mdash; GOODENOUGH, got "ON GOLD" in September,
and made their headquarters at the log hut on LANKELLY CREEK. They visited
COOKTOWN in December, bringing 60 ounces of alluvial gold. In May, 1877, they
returned to the camp, where they remained till December, when they again made
for Cooktown, this time carrying 140 ounces.</p>
<p>A sum of &pound;200 was subscribed in Cooktown, in consideration of which
the prospectors, in February, 1878, marked out a TRACK, along which a "rush"
from Cooktown and the Palmer took place.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The
alluvial gold proved a disappointment, and the field was practically abandoned
by July, when a new rush to Lukinville, on the Palmer, attracted the diggers
then remaining on the field.<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<p>I visited the deserted field in 1879.</p>
<p>In 1880, 300 Chinese left the Palmer for the Coen, but did not reach it, as
they turned back on meeting some of their compatriots returning with
unfavourable reports of the alluvial gold.<b style="color:#603000">[3]</b></p>
<p>As early as 1887, a mine named the WILSON, about 2 miles north-west of the
Coen township, was taken up by a company, who worked it, without conspicuous
success, for three years, employing 40 men.<b style="color:#603000">[4]</b></p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 467}</u></p>
<p>The site of the old alluvial diggings, on the east side of the misnamed Coen
River (which the Lands Department maps now call the SOUTH COEN), lay
untenanted, till in 1892 the field began a new phase of existence as a REEFING
DISTRICT. (Proclaimed 20th August.) (SEE MAP C.) From time to time various
mines came into prominence, but one at least was worked almost continuously for
about twenty-three years. This was the GREAT NORTHERN,<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> which was alluded to in the Annual Report of the
Department of Mines for 1904 as "one of the greatest mines of the State."</p>
<p>The "Enterprise" battery was erected in 1893.</p>
<p>The gold, as it occurs in the Coen reefs, is alloyed in a remarkable degree
with silver. The value per ounce was officially stated in 1904<b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> to be &pound;2 7s.</p>
<p>The population of a goldfield is naturally a fluctuating one. That of the
Coen has been even more subject to variations than less isolated fields, as it
has been a base of operations for prospectors, whose success, or reported
success, in other districts frequently drew heavily on its limited
<i>personnel</i>. Thus, in 1898, a large number of miners left the Coen for the
Klondike reefs and reefs 10 miles to the south of the Coen, and at Mount Croll,
and for alluvial gold on the telegraph line 1 mile north of the Stewart River;
and in 1900 many left for the newly discovered reefs of the Hamilton
Goldfield.<b style="color:#603000">[3]</b></p>
<p>The Wardens' estimates of the population of the Coen are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
1894 304

1912 117
1913 102
</pre>
<p>The great bulk of the output of the Coen reefs has been the product of the
Great Northern. It is stated that from 1893 to 1916, and down to the depth of
500 feet, that mine has yielded 52,000 ounces of gold, valued at &pound;14,400
(&pound;2 4s. per ounce).<b style="color:#603000">[4]</b></p>
<p>Some remarks on the METHODS OF PROSPECTORS, as they apply to exploration,
may appropriately be introduced in this place.</p>

(No. 163 of Geol. Survey Publications).]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Annual Report of the Department of Mines.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) <i>The Hamilton and Coen Goldfields</i>. L. C. Ball, p.

<blockquote>[4) "Wanderer," in <i>North Queensland Register</i>, 14th April,

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 468}</u></p>
<p>Working, in most cases, entirely "on their own," and in others assisted by
the Government or by local associations, the prospectors of the past furnished,
as a rule, very meagre reports, which were "given to the newspapers," to be
referred to in a few paragraphs among the news of the day, or published in full
or in abstract at the discretion of editors.</p>
<p>Generally, when prospectors had received Government assistance, the Annual
Reports of the Department of Mines gave a short statement of their itinerary
and noted their success or failure. With this exception, the records of
prospecting expeditions are only to be found in what is classed as "fugitive
literature" such as literary and scientific workers consider themselves at
liberty to ignore. Nevertheless, I have made it my business to explore as much
of this literature as was accessible to me, and have been rewarded by
discoveries of some value. In this connection I desire to record my
indebtedness to the facilities afforded by the courtesy of the officers of the
Mitchell and Parliamentary Libraries, Sydney, and the Public Library,
Melbourne.</p>
<p>Full allowance must be made for the difficulties of the prospector. He must,
in the first place, surround his wanderings with a certain amount of mystery,
lest some other should reap what he has sown. Should he be fortunate in his
quest, his first care is to secure everything that can be legally acquired by
way of reward claim, but he must manoeuvre to be left alone until he has
satisfied himself that he has really located the best part of his discovery. It
is only then that he is ready to make full disclosure of his success, with the
natural object of claiming the honour of the discovery and the chance of the
substantial bonus which the law allows after a certain number of men have been
settled on a new industry. If only partially successful; if, for example, he
notes the presence of an ore&mdash;say, wolfram, or an ore of tin too low in
price at the time to be payable, he says to himself, "It will keep." Or if he
detects rich alluvial gold in a position where water is unavailable, he marks
it for future exploitation when the season is more favourable. With such
after-thoughts in his mind, he is strongly tempted to withhold any information
which might lead others to reap the benefit of his work, and even to frame his
report so as to throw others off his track. When it is considered, moreover,
that many prospectors trust more to their own bushmanship than to maps, and
content themselves with identifying creeks, or giving names to creeks which may
have been named and charted already, it will be understood that the
contributions of some excellent prospectors are of no great value for
geographical purposes.</p>
<p>Many of the circumstances recorded in connection with the prospecting of the
Peninsula were more or less within my own knowledge, but, whenever it is
possible to do so, I prefer to cite another authority.</p>

<p>Fresh from the work of the Geological Survey of Scotland, I took up the
duties of Government Geologist for Queensland in April, 1877. My headquarters
were at Townsville, but the greater part of my time was necessarily spent in
the field. In 1879, on tne completion of an examination of the coal resources
of the Cooktown district, I made a reconnaissance to the north, leaving
Cooktown on 15th August, locating probably auriferous country on the Starcke
River, visiting the site of the recently rushed Coen Goldfield, which had
already been abandoned, land finding gold (though not in payable quantities) on
the Peach River (S. lat. 13&deg; 42'). Having penetrated to Birthday Mount
(13&deg; 34' S.) on 16th September, I bent my steps southward DV a different
<i>route</i> and returned to Cooktown on 3rd October.</p>
<p>The Ministry of the day came to the conclusion that the auricerous character
of my "furthest north" was worthy of a more searching investigation than
circumstances had permitted to me in i time of extreme drought with my poor
equipment of spent horses. [ was therefore instructed to lead a party of
prospectors to the scene of operations.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 470}</u></p>
<p>On 26th November, 1879, tne combined geological and prospecting parties left
Cooktown. My party consisted of Joseph J. Macdcnald (since deceased), my
stepson James S. Love and Charlie, an aboriginal from Townsville. The
prospectors were James Crosbie, John Layland, George Hume and John Hamil, all
of whom have since joined the majority. By a <i>route</i> further west than my
previous "out" and "home" tracks, we reached the Peach River (13&deg; 27' S.)
on 20th December. The Peach has since proved to be one of the heads of the
Archer River, named by the Brothers Jardine in 1865. Here began a series of
wanderings on the heads of the Archer in the range which I named the McIlwraith
in honour of the then Premier of Queensland. The wet season set in soon
afterwards with unwonted severity and the difficulties and dangers of
travelling caused by bogs and floods were shortly afterwards aggravated by the
starving condition of our horses and the hostility of the natives. Further
north, when the auriferous country had come to an end with the spread of the
Desert Sandstone and other comparatively recent sedimentary formations over the
whole peninsula, it was agreed between the prospectors and myself that it was
better to chance the unknown 2 degrees of latitude lying to the north between
us and Cape York (Somerset) than to face the known danger of crossing several
great rivers in a flooded condition. After many struggles we emerged at
Somerset on 3rd April, 1880. The observations made during the first and second
journeys are detailed in subsequent pages.</p>
<p>The first of my reports to reach the Minister for Mines was dated Temple
Bay, 16th February, 1880, when we came in sight of the Piper Island lightship
(120&deg; 13' S.). This "First Preliminary Report" was taken off by the
lightship's boat on the 18th. The "Second Preliminary Report" was dated
Townsville, 14th April, 1880, and gave a short account of the proceedings of
the party up to its arrival at False Orford Ness (11&deg; 22' S.) on 10th
March. The "Third Preliminary Report" was dated Brisbane, 24th April, 1880, and
brought the "preliminary" narrative up to the arrival at Somerset.</p>
<p>These three preliminary reports were given to the newspapers as soon as they
were received in Brisbane, but were not officially issued till 5th July,
1881,<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> when they were "presented to both Houses
of Parliament" as a blue book entitled "Further Reports on the Progress of the
Gold-Prospecting Expedition in Cape York Peninsula," which contained also my
report on the Wild River Tin Mines dated 27th October, 1880.</p>
<p>Although sufficient justification for the delay in writing my second and
third preliminary reports will be found in the following</p>
<blockquote>[1)I have a cutting of the Temple Bay report of 16th February,
1880, from the <i>Cooktown Courier</i> of 16th April, 1880.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 471}</u></p>
<p>pages, it may be explained that it was due to the prostration following on a
spear wound.</p>
<p>It was only on my return to headquarters at Townsville after a month's sick
leave that I was able to write my full report on the first and second
expeditions. This report, under the title of "Report on Explorations in Cape
York Peninsula, 1879-80," was "Presented to Both Houses" on 14th September,
1881.</p>
<p>The report was accompanied by a map on which I had spent infinite pains in
filling up what had been blanks in all previous maps, with new rivers,
mountains and ranges, to which I had given names. The report was published
without the map. I resigned From the Government service in 1899. At my request,
in 1910, liligent search for the missing map was made in the archives of :he
Mines, Lands, Works and Education Departments, under Drders from their present
heads, but without success. There is evidence that the map was handled by all
of these Departments, and is a matter of fact my topography and names were
adopted at once ind appeared in Government maps issued between the receipt of
the report and its official publication. I am not aware that any question of
"revindication of priority" has ever arisen, but if it had my topography and
nomenclature would hold good.</p>
<p>In what I am compelled to call these slipshod old days, scientific reports
of all kinds were "laid upon the table" at the convenience or caprice of the
Minister controlling the Department concerned, or they might even be
pigeon-holed for years till they were "called for" at the instance of some
impatient Member of Parliament, in my own case, reports and maps were published
in Brisbane after ong delays while I was in the field and generally abroad on
some new exploration, and I never had a chance of revising a proof or of
knowing when or in what form the reports and maps were to be issued. The
reports, as might have been expected, were full of amazing misprints, since, no
matter how long they might have been out of my hands, they had always to be set
up by the compositors of the Government Printing Office in the rush of a
parliaaentary session and with no other revision than that of a "reader" who
was probably suffering from the after-effects of insomnia.</p>
<p>After a few years of such experiences, I entered a vigorous proest, pointing
out that if my services were worth paying for, my eports were worth printing
promptly and printing correctly, and if not&mdash;&mdash;. An improvement
followed this protest, and in course of time, my headquarters having been
removed to Brisbane, secured the right to revise proofs of my own work.</p>
<p>It was obvious to me from the first that my reports on Cape York peninsula
had lost the greater part of their value from the omission of the explanatory
map. The reports themselves have now for some years been out of print, and I
had the idea of proposing to the the Queensland Government that they should be
reprinted,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 472}</u></p>
<p>together with my notes. In the beginning of 1913, some progress had been
made with this editorial task when Mr. James Dick, of Cooktown, sent me proofs
of a pamphlet which he was about to issue, entitled: <i>A Geological and
Prospecting Expedition which filled many Blank Spaces on the Map, Mr. R. L.
Jack, Geologist, and Mr. James Crosbie, Leader, Prospector</i>. It was not till
I had gone over the proofs, correcting them only in so far as statements of
facts were concerned, that I fully realised how misleading my original
narrative must have been, misprinted as it was, and unaccompanied by the
necessary explanatory map. Mr. Dick was a bushman and prospector of great
experience, familiar with the very ground described by myself, and a friendly,
but unbiassed, critic. In spite of all these qualifications, Mr. Dick had so
seriously misunderstood my narrative that it was obvious that a less qualified
reader would fall into even graver errors.</p>
<p>Thereupon I commenced the preparation of a map on which my <i>route</i> was
laid down from material derived from the original field note-books and
sketches, from the field maps used in the two expeditions (kindly lent by the
present Government Geologist, Mr. B. Dunstan) and from the most recent issues
of the Admiralty Charts and the maps of the Department of Lands. The
<i>route</i>, it may be said, was charted in the field, day by day, on an
outline map or "blank," of the coast-line taken from the Admiralty Charts as
they stood in 1879. This involved the fitting of my supposed <i>route</i>, as
laid down on my blanks, to the topography of the modern maps of the Lands
Department. The same process was afterwards applied to the routes of earlier
and later explorers by sea and land.</p>
<p>There follows hereon an annotated reprint of my official reports on the two
expeditions extending (1) from 15th August to 3rd October, 1879, and (2) from
26th November, 1879, to 3rd April, 1880. In this reprint I have made, without
comment, such minor corrections as would have been made had a proof passed
through my hands. Here and there a few words of explanation have been
interpolated: these are enclosed in brackets [...] and initialled. Footnotes
now added for the first time are also initialled.</p>
<p>The "preliminary reports" are not given in the order in which they were
first officially issued, but are interpolated as summary accounts of the
portions of the journey to which they severally refer. My own <i>route</i> and
the routes followed by other explorers were first charted on the "Queensland
Four-Mile Map," and afterwards reduced to an 8-mile scale. I cannot too
strongly insist that the 8-mile maps distinguished as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,
K, L, M, N, O and P, as well as the 16-mile maps Q and R, form an essential
part of the work.</p>
<p>It was not till June, 1919, when Mr. John R. Bradford's report on his
exploration of 1893, preliminary to the selection of a <i>route</i> for the
telegraph line from Fairview, near Cooktown, to Cape</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 473}</u></p>
<p>York, came into my hands through the courtesy of Mr. J. McConachie, Acting
(Federal) Deputy Postmaster-General, Queensland, that the first trace of the
missing map was obtained. Mr. Bradford's report to the Queensland Post and
Telegraph Department was accompanied by a map, in several sheets, on which my
missing map had been faithfully copied, the names and remarks in my handwriting
being traced. Mr. Bradford [who now resides in Brisbane, having retired from
the service in 1909) writes me that on his way north to commence his work he
called on me while his steamer waited in Townsville harbour, ind borrowed my
office copy, which he copied in Cooktown before starting on his overland
journey. Further details will be found in the chapter relating to the Cape York
Telegraph Line. It is interesting to note how closely Mr. Bradford's copy
corresponds with my own replotting of the missing map from my field
noteDooks.</p>
<p>In March, 1920, having got into correspondence with Mr. Prank J. Paterson,
Licensed Surveyor, who was a partner in the irm of contractors for the northern
(Paterson to Mein) section of the line, I was enabled to trace the missing map
to the Mines Department, to which I had sent it in 1880. Before he left
Brisbane in 1884, to start the construction, Mr. Paterson was supplied by the
Department of Mines either with my original map or a copy of it. The original
map was therefore in the possesion of that Department in 1884.</p>

<h5>BY ROBERT LOGAN JACK, GOVERNMENT GEOLOGIST</h5>
<h5>PRESENTED TO BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT BY COMMAND</h5>
<h5>TO THE HONOURABLE THE SECRETARY FOR MINES</h5>
<h5>FIRST EXPEDITION</h5>
<p>In April, 1879, I was Honoured with instructions from you to examine the
Cooktown district with special reference to the existence of coal and to report
generally on the geology of the district.</p>
<p>Having devoted about three months to the coal question,<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> I deemed it advisable to visit some of the outlying
parts of the district</p>
<blockquote>[1) See "Preliminary Reports of the Geological Survey of Northern
Queensland" No. 3, "On the Progress of the Search for Coal in the Cook
District," and No. 4, "Second Report on the Progress of the Search for Coal in
the Cook District" Brisbane by Authority, 1879.]</blockquote>

<p>before the summer should be too far advanced, reserving the work in the
settled parts for the season when the natural grasses of the country might be
expected to prove inadequate to the support of the horses of the party.</p>
<p>The party comprised two white men (J. J. Macdonald and Charles Grainer), two
black boys (Willie and Brusher) and the Leader. In addition to the five horses
required for mounts, five carried provisions, tents, blankets, ammunition and
tools.</p>
<p>The objects I placed before myself in setting out may here be briefly summed
up: To traverse the little-known region north of the Endeavour and east of the
Normanby Rivers and to gain such an idea of its structure as might serve to
throw light on its value as a possibly metalliferous country; to strike the
blazed track leading to the Coen, the site of the brief but vigorous rush of
1878; to examine that locality, and, if practicable, penetrate a short distance
further to the north; and lastly, to note, on the way back to Cooktown, the
geology of the district lying between the Coen and the Palmer Goldfield.</p>
<p>On the 15th August, 1879, I left COOKTOWN [SEE MAP E]<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and joined the rest of the party, who were camped, by
previous arrangement, beside MR. JOHN WILLIAMS' STATION, on one of the heads of
the ENDEAVOUR RIVER (distance 25 miles: CAMP 15). [The so-called "North Branch
of the Endeavour."]</p>
<p>On 16th August we moved northward to the MclvoR RIVER (CAMP 16: distance 21
miles), where we were joined by MR. ALFRED STARCKE, Licensed Surveyor, under
whose guidance we continued our journey to his camp on the MORGAN, distant 3
miles to ENE. (CAMP 17).<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<p>From the starting-point at Cooktown an extensive view is obtained to the
north and west, the valleys of the Endeavour and its tributaries forming a
depressed foreground, which has the effect of throwing into strong relief the
contour of the mountains beyond. No one can fail to be struck by the immense
masses of HORIZONTAL SANDSTONE STRATA which cap the mountains in CONTINUOUS
TABLELANDS at the head of the Endeavour and Oaky and in ISOLATED FRAGMENTS at
CUNNINGHAM'S RANGE, CONNOR'S KNOB and CAPE BEDFORD.<b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> It must be obvious to the most superficial observer
that the horizontal deposits must have been continuous at no very distant date,
even over the area where it is now only represented by fragments standing alone
on pinnacles of slate or granite, and that the southern shores of the waters in
which it was deposited</p>
<blockquote>[1) Cooktown, which has a convenient harbour on the estuary of the
Endeavour River, was founded in 1873, as the port for the Palmer Goldfield. Its
name commemorates the landing of Captain James Cook, in 1770, on what was
destined to become the site of the town. For details of Cook's voyage to
Endeavour Harbour and his stay there (17th June to 4th August, 1770), see
<a href="#ch11">Chapter XI.</a>]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) The consecutive numbers of our camps are here given, as they
were conspicuously cut out on trees and may serve for landmarks for a few
years.]</blockquote>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 477}</u></p>
<p>were formed by the lofty ranges from which the Annan, Normanby and Laura
Rivers take their rise. North of this limit, or ancient I shore, all the
mountains which rise to the height of about 800 feet above the level of the sea
"catch" (to use a graphic mining term) the even bottom of the sandstone, while
from those which do not now attain this altitude, as well as from the valleys,
the deposit has been entirely removed by denudation.</p>
<p>With one notable exception, the sandstone, from the Byerstown Road northward
to the Morgan, rests upon a foundation of nearly vertical strata of alternating
slate, quartzite and greywacke. A thick and valuable bed of LIMESTONE is
crossed by "Coward's Track" between the head of Oaky Creek and Mount Byerley.
[Mount Byerley is in Map G.&mdash;R. L. J.] Should this limestone be traceable
to the south, it may yet serve a useful purpose in defining the horizons of the
accompanying strata. The edges of the slates and other upturned strata bear,
for the most part, north and south. Southward on this line of strike the
stratified rocks are at intervals metamorphosed into, or pierced by, granite
rocks. The auriferous districts of the Upper Normanby, Hodgkinson and Mulgrave
lie nearly in this line.</p>
<p>The exception referred to occurs in the valley of OAKY CREEK, between the
Palmerville and Byerstown Roads. There the sandstone overlies, not the slates
and quartzites, but a great thickness of strata containing <i>Glossopteris</i>,
the characteristic fossil fern of the New South Wales and Bowen River Coal
Formations, and comprising sandstones, black shales, and coal-seams. This
formation has already been described at some length in the two reports above
referred to. The beds dip at high angles to the north-west <i>under</i> the
horizontal sandstone of the "Brothers," which is therefore separated from them
by a violent unconformability. As a great thickness of the coal-bearing strata
dips under the sandstone of the "Brothers" on the east side of that range, and
<i>does not reappear</i> on the west side (where the sandstone rests immej
diately on slates), the coal-bearing strata must be bounded on the west by a
fault which passes beneath, and does not disturb, the horizontal sandstones.
The Glossopteris-bearing beds had been contorted, faulted and denuded prior to
the deposition of the still undisturbed sandstone&mdash;processes implying the
lapse of animmense period of time.</p>
<p>The horizontal sandstone varies in texture from a Jcoarse grit to a fine,
hard, compact rock. The materials are for the most part siliceous, but
occasionally felspathic. Generally white or yellow, they sometimes have a faint
red tinge from the presence of peroxide of iron. Where much iron is present,
nodules of fine hematite are frequently met with. Pebbles of quartz, quartzite,
slate, Lydian stone, greywacke and granite occur near the base of the
formation, forming a few beds of conglomerate.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 478}</u></p>
<p>In the far north of the Cape York Peninsula, as will be hereafter seen, the
upper beds of the formation assume an entirelydifferent aspect.</p>
<p>There are very few shaly beds among the sandstones, On the north side of the
estuary of the Endeavour, however, some shales are seen crowded with plant
<i>d&eacute;bris</i>. Indistinct plant remains have also been met with on
Jessie's Tableland. Thin (&frac14; inch) COAL-SEAMS occur on the North Shore,
near Cooktown, and in Temple Bay.</p>
<p>On 18th August, we left Mr. Starcke's camp, after improving a cutting
through the scrub on the banks of the MORGAN RIVER for the passage of the
pack-horses. This river and the MclvoR are clothed with a luxuriant tropical
SCRUB. Tall, dark trees throw a perennial cool shade over the rapid stream.
Their dense foliage is pierced by no ray of light; but the slender stems of
lofty palms shoot up through the leafy mass and wave their graceful heads above
it. The spaces between the trunks of the larger trees are choked with a tangled
mass of vegetation, including nutmeg trees, canes, plantains, the graceful but
formidable lawyer vine, and the large heart-shaped stinging tree, whose
lightest touch is agonising to man and often fatal to horses.</p>
<p>A period subsequent to the denudation of the valleys in the horizontal
sandstone has been marked by great VOLCANIC ACTIVITY, whose effects are seen in
great masses of BASALT. The basalt has emanated for the most part from VOLCANIC
CENTRES, which occur generally in the form of dome-shaped unwooded eminences
near the heads of the valleys denuded out of the sandstone tableland.
Conspicuous among these are the "SISTERS" at the head of the Endeavour, the
"PIEBALD MOUNTAIN," MOUNT MORGAN, etc. These hills do not possess a crateriform
appearance, but are mere rises marking the sites of the lava-eruptions which
have spread around them when situated on level ground, or escaped in
glacierlike <i>coul&eacute;es</i> down the valleys. The points of eruption
bear, in fact, such relations to the lava flows as the similar foci in Auvergne
bear to the basalt there. <i>Coul&eacute;es</i> of BASALTIC LAVA have flowed
from the <i>foci</i> above referred to down the valleys of the north and south
forks of the Endeavour River, and have radiated out from Mount Morgan and other
centres to the east and north over the flats between the mountains and the sea,
where they form, by their decomposition, a chocolate-coloured soil of great
depth, peculiarly fitted for tropical agriculture and at present supporting
grasses of very unusually fattening qualities.</p>
<p>Where the basalt has decomposed into soil <i>on the spot</i>, it gives rise
to open, well-grassed country, almost bare of trees. But where, on the other
hand, the soil has been <i>redeposited in alluvial flats</i> on the sides of
the river courses, it is usually darker in colour, and covered by the dense
scrubby vegetation already referred to.</p>
<p>The surfaces of the basalt <i>coul&eacute;es</i>, as well as of the
dome-shaped</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 479}</u></p>
<p>centres of eruption, are frequently scoriaceous in a marked degree, forming
spongy masses, light and porous as pumice-stone. In a few places, the basalt of
the <i>coul&eacute;es</i> is columnar, as at the waterfalls in the Endeavour,
between Williams' station and Branigan's. The basalt is of the usual character,
but contains occasional hornblende crystals, and much olivine. It also contains
lievrite (silicate of iron) in geodes.</p>
<p>GATES' LOOKOUT is a volcanic centre of a different character&mdash;ithe
deep-seated stump or "NECK" OF A CRATER, which once discharged showers of ashes
from its mouth. It forms a conspicuous mountain of tuff, and can be seen from
Isabella Creek to cut through the escarpment of a thick bed of white sandstone.
This rock is an agglomerate of volcanic <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, with a certain
rude bedding&mdash;courses of larger alternating with courses of smaller
bombs&mdash;having a dip to the east at about 15 degrees. That the bombs are
mot detached fragments of an already consolidated rock, but have (been
consolidated from a molten mass while whirling through the air, is proved by
the spherical envelope of vesicular basalt which invariably enfolds them. The
interior of the bombs is a mass of iblack and green crystals of augite (?) and
olivine. They range from ian eighth of an inch to a foot in diameter.<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>After skirting the east side of the MORGAN TABLELAND (a [denuded fragment of
the horizontal sandstone) for a distance (of about 4 miles, we ascended a
"bald" (i.e., treeless) <i>mamelon</i> inear its northern extremity. This
<i>mamelon</i> is another of the [volcanic <i>foci</i>. A larger one&mdash;a
low hill, partly scrubby and partly bald&mdash;rose from the flats about 2
miles to the east. From its base extensive volumes of smoke marked the
whereabouts of a num:ber of intending selectors who had left Mr. Starcke's camp
in the morning, and were now burning the grass.</p>
<p>We next passed north-westward by the end of the sandstone cliffs of the
Morgan Tableland, over slate ridges (below the level of the base of the
sandstone) strewn with fragments of white quartz. In about 2 miles to the north
we crossed from the left to the right bank of a stream running south, and about
3 yards wide, which must be a feeder, if not the main head, of the MORGAN. It
was fringed by a belt of scrub, through which we had to cut a passage with
tomahawks. We followed up the right bank of this creek to the north for rather
more than 2 miles, crossing a tributary coming from the hills to the west. At
the end of the 2 miles the creek was found to trend to the west, the valley
presenting a steep wall of sandstone which forbade the further passage of
horses in that direction. We therefore crossed to the left bank in the hope of
finding a passable gap through the sandstone range further to the north. After
skirting the range to the</p>
<blockquote>[1) For further details, see Geol. Map attached to Report by A.
Gibb Maitland, on the Geology of the Cooktown District. Brisbane, by Authority,
1891.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 480}</u></p>
<p>east and south-east for 3 miles, we camped on the left bank of a brook near
the base of the range. (CAMP 18: bloodwood, broad-arrow, J. 18.) The country
passed over in this day's march was all slate, the slates being capped to the
right and left of our course by horizontal beds of sandstone.</p>
<p>About eleven o'clock at night, Macdonald and the two black boys heard one of
the horses neigh suspiciously and (as they believed) they heard a black fellow
among the horses signalling to his companions by a low whistle. On the alarm
being given, we fired a shot in the air to apprise the visitors that we were
armed and on the watch. The night was so dark that a sally would have been
useless. Perhaps the shot had the desired effect, for we found the horses
unhurt in the morning. The blacks in the Endeavour and Mclvor country have a
bad reputation, their weakness for horseflesh rendering them undesirable
neighbours.</p>
<p>On the morning of 19th August, we struck out eastward for a "bald" rise
about 3 miles off&mdash;evidently one of the volcanic centres. We expected to
be able to discover from this rise some gap in the sandstone range, but we were
unable to reach it, having to turn back with one horse lamed and the rest
"cowed" by the attempted passage over what appeared, at first sight, an easy
grassy plain. This turned out to be marshy "devil-devil" country&mdash;probably
a lake in wet weather&mdash;a network of boggy ditches, with the intervening
dry stools of clay covered with coarse rank grass, through which it was very
difficult to push one's way even on foot. I concluded that nothing but very
urgent business would warrant my forcing a passage through this sort of
country. Between the devil-devil and the sand-hills of the coast, the NATIVES
were busy burning the grass.</p>
<p>Having retraced our steps to near the precipitous cliffs of the sandstone
range, we skirted the latter for about 3 miles to the north and 4 to the
west-north-west, when we passed through a gap and dropped down into a fair
valley, about a mile in width, opening out to the north. We camped on the right
bank of a creek of the third magnitude,<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> dry
with the exception of a few water-holes. (CAMP 19: bloodwood, marked broad
arrow, J.19.79.) The valley, although it was not the rich soil and luxuriant
grasses of the Mclvor, has a fair patch of level grassy country about</p>
<p>2 miles in length and a mile broad. [A river in the Starcke Goldfield which
was subsequently opened. Later on, this river was named the "RUNNING STARCKE"
by the diggers. It is not the river named the STARCKE by me.&mdash;R. L.
J.]</p>
<blockquote>[1) Some system of classifying creeks being absolutely necessary, I
divide them into four "magnitudes." The first comes next to a river, while the
fourth is a brook. The magnitude refers to the place where the creek is crossed
or described. A fourth or third magnitude creek may, of course, become a river
if followed down. [I still think the suggestion was a good one, but it was not
adopted by any other describers of new country, xcept J. T. Embley, J. R.
Bradford and James Dick.&mdash;R. L. J.]]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 481}</u></p>
<p>The north-eastward promontory of the sandstone range passed in this day's
march is very conspicuous from the Mclvor and Morgan valleys. The lower beds of
sandstone appear to rest Dn porphyry.</p>
<p>The gap by which we dropped down into the valley where we camped was not
more than 300 feet above the sea-level. It was composed of slate and greywacke,
with some crystalline quartz marked with reddish spots (decomposed pyrites).
For about 3 miles further to the north the slates and greywackes rose into
little hills (forming the right wall of the valley in w r hich we camped), but
not to a sufficient height to "take on" the sandstone, which has been here
entirely denuded.</p>
<p>Having disposed the camp to my satisfaction, I returned to the gap with
Macdonald, who bottomed in a likely gully. The bottom was found to be
decomposed greywacke, and the washdirt included fragments of porphyry,
greywacke, granite, slate and quartz. We found no gold.</p>
<p>After sunset we heard NATIVES talking near the camp, but could not see
them.</p>
<p>August 20. We left Camp 19 at 8 a.m. and crossed the creek at a point, about
a mile to the north-west, where the left wall of the valley dropped down to low
ridges. Here we emerged from the valley and pursued our course to the
north-west for about miles over low spurs of the range slate and conglomeratic
greywacke. These stratified rocks are nearly vertical and strike north and
south. The edge of the sandstone is distant about 5 miles to the south. [About
3 miles, according to modern maps.&mdash;R. L. J.] There is a good deal of
white quartz on the ridges, with crystalline cavities and a little "brownstone"
(decomposed pyrites). We washed some dirt from cavities in the slate, but found
no gold nor even iron sand or garnets.</p>
<p>From the left wall of the valley which we left in the morning, I took a
series of bearings to recognisable points on the coast. I could see several
large inlets of the sea to the north and north-east, and a lagoon situated
about half-way to CAPE FLATTERY. [Cape Flattery was named by Captain Cook, 10th
August, 1770.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>We then held for about 4 miles to the west, at the base of a range (on our
left) composed of conglomeratic slates and pale blue flinty sandstone. The
NATIVES were burning the grass on a large scale about a mile to the north. At
the end of the 4 miles, the range was found to swing round to the north and to
extend in this direction for 6 or 8 miles, and as this lay across our path we
sought for a gap, and found one (about 400 feet above the sea-level) which took
us down into the next valley. The ascent was very trying to the horses, two of
which showed signs of giving in. From the saddle of the gap (slate with a
meridional strike) a good view was obtained to the north and south and a series
of bearings was taken.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 482}</u></p>
<p>To the north we saw fair open country, about a mile in breadth, skirting the
hills. Thence to the coast, however, the land appeared to be
worthless&mdash;salt-water inlets and bare "salt pans" with a fringe of
sand-hills.</p>
<p>On the inland side, the gap overlooked a valley falling to the north-west.
This valley is about a mile wide. We could trace it upward for 5 or 6 miles by
the smoke made by NATIVES who were BURNING THE GRASS&mdash;the <i>alpha</i> and
<i>omega</i> of their simple notion of "doing their duty by the land."</p>
<p>We descended about a mile to the west into the valley and crossed to the
left bank of a creek. This was a deep, clear, running stream 2 or 3 yards in
width, flowing over a bottom of vertical slates, striking north and south. From
the point where we crossed, the creek runs west. We followed down the left bank
for about a mile, when, after rounding some slate spurs, which here come down
to the creek from the sandstone tableland to the south, we found that the creek
was a tributary of a much larger stream coming from the south. This RIVER I
named after MR. ALFRED STARCKE, whose surveying camp was at that moment the
northmost outpost of civilisation in the interior of Queensland. It has a rapid
stream about 10 yards wide. Its bed is somewhat scrubby. A black gin was
surprised beside a fire in the scrub as we crossed the stream. She seemed
astonished, but not much alarmed.</p>
<p>We could see up the valley of the STARCKE RIVER to the south for 8 or 9
miles [6 at most, according to modern maps.&mdash;R. L. J.]. The valley is
nearly flat, with an average breadth of 2 miles of tolerable grazing country,
lightly timbered with box and bloodwood. With the tributary valley it would
form a fair-sized cattle run.</p>
<p>We continued our journey to the westward, keeping the river in sight, on our
right hand, for the first mile or two. Here we crossed a NATIVE TRACK in the
long "sorgham grass," only a few hours old. The travellers' line of march had
been from north to south. Their numbers must have been very
considerable&mdash;I should say hundreds rather than scores&mdash;as the grass
was beaten down as if by the passage of a large mob of cattle. About 4 miles
from the crossing of the river, we camped at sunset on the left bank of a gully
(a tributary of the Starcke), with water-holes and coarse grass. (CAMP 20:
bloodwood, marked broad arrow, J. XX.) We were overjoyed to find this patch of
grass before night set in, as the last 3 miles of travelling had been over the
still smoking embers of the bush fires we had seen in the morning, and we had
begun to fear having to camp without any food for the horses. This would have
been a serious thing in the weak state of some of our horses.</p>
<p>A gin and piccaninny walked leisurely away from the right bank as we
approached the gully. Brusher wanted to take possession of the gin, but I put
my veto on the first proposal to adopt a course</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 483}</u></p>
<p>which has, again and again, been a fruitful cause of TROUBLE BETWEEN WHITES
AND BLACKS.</p>
<p>August 21. On leaving Camp 20, we travelled northward for about 2 miles to a
low range which extends 3 miles further north, is we did not cross the STARCKE,
that river must flow to the north, between the "low range" and the range which
we crossed by the gap on the 20th August. There can be very little doubt that
it enters the sea between Red Point and Murdoch Point. [The smaller "RUNNING
STARCKE" falls into the sea between Murdoch ad Lookout Points. Cook landed at
and named Lookout Point, 10th August, 1770.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>We then struck W. 36&deg; N. (true) for a bold cliff of sandstone capping
the mountains on the left, distant about 6 miles. Our course lay along the
chord of a bay in the sandstone-capped range. The country passed over was
nearly level and timbered with bloodwood and box. with poplar gum and Moreton
Bay ash in the alluvial bottoms. There were no creeks of any importance. One
mile short of the bluff, in crossing some protruding spurs of the range, we
observed a large reef of poor, white, unpromising quartz.</p>
<p>At this place we were under the necessity of ABANDONING to her fate a
piebald MARE, which had become incapable of keeping up with the others. The
black boys had walked by turns since the morning, and the unfortunate beast had
managed to keep up with the rest for a time. Then the empty saddle was found to
be too great a burden, and was packed on another horse. But latterly she was
too weak to go on, even with one man leading her by a halter and a black boy
urging from behind. On weighing the value of our time,the distance we had to
go, and the limited quantity of our rations against the value of the animal, I
had no hesitation in leaving her behind. My first impulse was to shoot her, to
prevent her falling into the hands of the blacks and helping to spread the
taste for horseflesh among the latter, but I let her go, on the forlorn chance
of her recovering, and finding her way back to civilisation.</p>
<p>The sandstone at the bluff rests on granite. I ascended a spur leading up to
the sandstone, and took a series of bearings, There is a belt of good country
at the base of the hill, about 5 miles in breadth. No elevation of any
consequence, except sand-hills, intervenes between the sandstone range and the
coast.</p>
<p>We kept the same course (W. 36&deg; N.) over teatree (<i>melaleuca</i>)
ridges (granite and slate with quartz) for 3 miles further, when we obtained a
view to the south up a large valley intersecting the sandstone tableland. We
then struck magnetic west (W. 6&deg; N., true) and in 1 mile came on a large
creek with numerous sandy channels a running stream 2 or 3 yards wide, and deep
water-holes. The creek [the JEANNIE RIVER of later maps.&mdash;R. L. J.] had
large teatrees growing in its bed, and presented a striking contrast to</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 484}</u></p>
<p>the scrub-matted water-courses to the north of Cooktown. The obvious
explanation was the poverty of the sandy soil.</p>
<p>Camped on the left bank of the creek. (CAMP 21: Moreton Bay ash, broad
arrow, J. 21).</p>
<p>In the course of the day we passed two NATIVE CAMPS in the open country. One
had evidently been abandoned only a few days before; it was merely a ring of
boughs for a breakwind and the usual cooking-holes. The other was of more
substantial bark "gunyahs," supported on pegs.</p>
<p>August 22. We steered magnetic west on leaving Camp 21, for the first mile
and a half over flats with sandy soil, and for an equal distance across teatree
ridges (spurs of the hills forming the left wall of the valley of the creek at
Camp 21). In 3 miles from the camp we were on the saddle of a low gap in the
sandstone wall. The gap showed slates and porphyries strewn with small quartz
fragments. Three miles further west, through similar country, with sandstone
cliffs capping the mountains to the north and south, brought us to the left
bank of a running creek flowing south, with several sandy ridges in its bed; it
must be a tributary of the creek that we left in the morning.</p>
<p>On the same course we travelled for 4 miles further through a poor, desert
country, the bottom being recemented granite and sandstone
<i>d&eacute;bris</i>, giving rise to a soil only capable of supporting stunted
brushwood and poor, wiry grass. When sunset brought with it the necessity for
camping, we managed, after much search, to find two muddy water-holes in a
marshy bottom, and pitched our camp beside them. (CAMP 22: stringybark, broad
arrow,J. 22.)</p>
<p>Another horse had been found early in the day to be on the point of knocking
up, and I reluctantly made up my mind to stay two days at Camp 22 before
attempting to cross the ranges ahead of us. It was a pity that the grass and
water were not of better quality than they were at our enforced
halting-place.</p>
<p>The following morning (23rd August), Macdonald and I walked into the next
valley by a gap in the mountains, below the level of the base of the sandstone.
The ridge we crossed was OH slate, as was also the valley to the west. We
carried prospecting tools, but as we found no water, they were of no use to us.
On my way back to the camp I ascended the sandstone range to the north and had
a long look ahead. After 6 or 8 miles of mountains the country to the west
appeared to be low and gently undulating,, and I congratulated myself that our
difficulties in crossing th4 range were nearly over. I could see the sandstone
ranges extending a long way to the north, to a point which cannot be far from
Cape Melville. Looking back on the line of our last march, the blacks were seen
burning the bush about 3 miles to the east of our camp.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we prospected for some time (without success)</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 485}</u></p>
<p>i a running creek which we found about 2 miles south of our amp, and which
took its rise in the sandstone ranges to the south.</p>
<p>On our return to the camp we were glad to find that the boys had shot a
young kangaroo and two black cockatoos&mdash;a supply which would enable us to
spare the salt beef for two days. A kangaroo dog which accompanied us turned
out quite useless, a mere <i>bouche inutile</i>. The poor dog's worthlessness
was explained afterwards by his falling into the distemper.</p>
<p>August 25. Having previously determined on the best possible crossing of the
range before us, I led straight up to it (N. 24&deg; W., 1 mile). The best was
not very good; it was up a long, grassy spur, leading to the lowest part of the
range, at a height of about 500 feet; the descent on the other side was much
steeper. The horses behaved well. A series of bearings was taken from the
summit.</p>
<p>Having descended into the valley (about a mile from its head), we struck out
for a prominent point of the right wall of the valley, ditant about 3 miles and
bearing W. 14&deg; S. To the south of this point a long valley opened out, and
this I took for the course of the creek. My surprise was great to find that it
was only a tributary valley and that the main stream&mdash;which I named DESERT
CREEK&mdash;escaped westward through a narrow gap into the flat country, which
I had seen from the summit of the ridge. We were therefore fairly launched on
waters flowing to the Normanby River, or into Princess Charlotte Bay, and had
crossed in the morning (without suspecting the fact) the last ridge of the
BACKBONE OF THE CAPE MELVILLE PENINSULA.</p>
<p>We continued down the valley for 1 mile to W. 14&deg; N. and for 3 miles
further to W. 6&deg; N. (the creek having by this time become a running
stream). The latter course brought us to a low sandstone range, which we had to
skirt for 2 miles to S. 4&deg; W. before we could round it and continue our
westward journey.</p>
<p>When we had rounded the point of the sandstone range and resumed our course
(W. 6&deg; N.), we entered at once on a desert. The creek fell away to the
south of our course and the ground we traversed had an almost insensible
southward slope. No more landmarks were visible than if we had been out on the
open ocean, there was no grass but spinifex and not much of that, for the
natives had burned it the day before. The timber was stunted tea tree
(<i>melaleuca</i>), stringybark or messmate, and low bushes of <i>Pandanus</i>,
occasionally thickening into scrub. There was no soil, but only deep white sand
derived from the waste of the Desert Sandstone. There were even no
water-courses&mdash;what represented them were mere strips of sand absolutely
bare of vegetation but not below the general level. After crossing about
8&frac12; miles of this desert, we found water at 5 o'clock&mdash;to my
surprise, for I fully expected to have to make a waterless and, still worse,
an</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 486}</u></p>
<p>almost grassless camp. Beside the water-hole the NATIVES had been
MANUFACTURING SPEARS a few days before. (CAMP 23: box, broad arrow, J. 23.)</p>
<p>August 23. The horses had gone back a good way in the night, owing to the
poorness of the grass, and it was about 9 o'clock before we made a start. In 10
miles (W. 6&deg; N.) through desert country exactly like that of the previous
day&mdash;the last 4 miles rather harder ground, with occasional outcrops of
sandstone and conglomerate&mdash;we came again on Desert Creek,<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> here flowing to the north-west. Having crossed to the
left bank of the creek and continued on our course for about a mile further, we
found some grass and water in a marshy bottom and camped for the night. (CAMP
24: bloodwood, broad arrow, J. 24.) There was a thunderstorm with heavy rain
during the night.</p>
<p>August 27. Having dried our tents, we continued on the same course. In 8
miles we came on two gins carrying a baby&mdash;mother, daughter and grandchild
probably&mdash;the first NATIVES we had seen near enough to speak to. The elder
woman was hideous by nature and was rendered still more so by having her cheeks
daubed with clay. The best that could be said of the younger was that she was
less repulsive. She wore a fringe about 4 inches square, but her mother had no
covering but mud. They were very much scared at first, but soon became very
loquacious. Neither of our black boys understood a word of their language. We
made known by signs our anxiety to find water, and the gins pointed to the
west. As the gins had more luggage than two could carry, they probably had
companions, who may have seen us and hidden themselves. We had the curiosity to
overhaul their swags, but I was careful that the boys should take nothing, They
had a well-made fishing net and line, about a score of long, thin bamboos for
making fish-spears, and a net full of miscellanies, including two old jam-tins,
some sea-shells (for drinking cups) and part of an old tent or fly. The
European articles were probably spoils from the deserted Coen diggings. I was
interested in seeing that the gins had distinctly the instinct of sexual
modesty, as they kept getting behind trees and hiding behind one another during
their parley with us. When we turned to leave, they followed us till we warned
them that we did not desire their company. They seemed pleased at getting
permission to retire, and</p>
<blockquote>[1) In a school map issued by the Department of Public Instruction,
this creek is named "Jack River." The mistake must have arisen from my

the courses of the various! explorers. [The preceding note was added to the MS.
before it was forwarded to the! Minister for Mines in 1880. The name of Jack

A recent correspondence with the SurveyorGeneral, Mr. Allan A. Spowers, has
resulted in that gentleman agreeing to restore thai name Desert Creek to the
creek so named by me, and to apply the name Jack River to I a large branch of
the Normanby River (Lat. 15&deg; S.) on which Hann probably camped on 15th
September, 1872, and which I ran up for a few miles in 1879 (my Camp
28).&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 487}</u></p>
<p>fancy they had in some way got it into their heads that they were bound to
follow us as prisoners of war.</p>
<p>A low, table-topped hill of sandstone now appeared about a mile ahead of us,
to W. 26&deg; N., and I made for it in order to have look out for landmarks. We
had scarcely started when Macdonald Informed me that two of the horses were
getting weak, while a third had fallen a long way behind, and was in a lather
of perspiration and could hardly be pulled and pushed along by Grainer and
Willie on foot. They had taken off his very light pack and put it on another
horse. I was under the impression that the horses must have eaten some
POISONOUS GRASS OR HERB. The superiority of such of the horses as have youth
and breeding on their side comes out conspicuously in such a strait as we were
now in. Not much could be expected from the best of them, however.</p>
<p>The country we had travelled over for three days was nothing but a WOODED
SAHARA. The blacks had just burned what grass it usually bears. Once in 10
miles or so we crossed a wet bottom with a little grass which had escaped the
fire. But for these grassy patches the horses must have died of starvation.</p>
<p>It will be readily understood that I gazed from the hill with feelings of
considerable anxiety for some change in the nature of the country. Westward
(our proposed course) as far as the eye could reach, nothing but low, flat land
was to be seen, and there was nothing to indicate an improvement in the
character of the vegetation. With a heavy heart I admitted that to carry out my
programme had become impossible, and made up my mind that the first thing to be
done was to find water and camp, to save the failing horses; and the second, to
strike the Normanby River or the Coen track and go back to the nearest point of
the Palmer Road, spell the horses, and perhaps buy a few more to replace those
that were unfit to travel.</p>
<p>Turning to the south-west (magnetic), in which direction I hoped to find the
Normanby at its nearest point, we came in 1 mile to a water-hole in a sandy
gully, with a little green picking for the horses. (CAMP 25: Moreton Bay ash,
broad arrow, J. 25.)</p>
<p>August 28. Left Camp 25 at 8 a.m. and kept (magnetic) south-west. In 2 miles
we reached the NORMANBY RIVER&mdash;a significent sheet of deep water a furlong
or more in breadth, flnked by chains of lagoons, with sweet grass and a sort of
four-leaved clover which the starving horses attacked with great relish. Hope
revived, for I could see that a few days' rest and feeding here might be the
salvation of the poor beasts of burden. We camped on a lagoon on the right bank
of the river (CAMP 26). In the afternoon we caught some fish, and the black
boys shot two pelicans, which we ate thankfully.</p>
<p>Grainer had been, in 1878, part of the way to the Coen rush, and described
the blazed track as crossing the Normanby 5 miles</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 488}</u></p>
<p>below Battle Camp and keeping the right bank of the river for 30 miles more,
to what is called the "Lower Crossing." As we had not crossed the track, we had
struck the river below the lower crossing. I therefore determined to run the
Normanby up to the lower crossing, a course which would bring me nearer the
Palmer road should I find it necessary to return.</p>
<p>Half-a-mile above our camp there had been a NATIVE FISHING STATION last wet
season. The mouth of a gully (still retaining a few water-holes) had been
stopped by a fence of stakes and twisted branches. The blacks must have got a
good many large barramundi, judging from the heaps of large scales lying about.
Six dome-shaped gunyahs, 4 feet high and 6 in diameter, were still standing.
They were strongly built of flakes of teatree bark, secured with vines and
teatree bark ropes to a framework of boughs. Every cranny was carefully stopped
up with straw. The access was by a door 14 inches square, stopped up with a
wisp of straw. A heap of ashes lay inside each gunyah, opposite the door. I
thought the buildings were designed for smoking fish, but the boys assured me
that they were only for protection in the season when "bigfellow rain come up."
It is an undeniable fact that Queensland natives can live where white men would
be suffocated.</p>
<p>The next day (August 29), Brusher and Willie having been sent out with a
shot-gun and rifle to get game and report if they saw the Coen track, were
ATTACKED BY NATIVES while eating their lunch, about 5 miles down the river. One
spear (barbed with kangaroo bone) lighted at Willie's feet, and a fishing-spear
(a bamboo lance with four bloodwood prongs), broke in a tree above his head.
The boys saw five natives in all, two of whom they shot dead&mdash;one of them
while in the act of aiming a spear. The rest fled. Such, at least, was the
boys' story, and I faded to shake it in any essential point by a long
cross-examination. They brought home two spears in support of the story. I
regret the circumstance, as I hoped to accomplish my peaceful mission without
bloodshed; but I could not blame the boys for doing what I should have done
myself had I been attacked.</p>
<p>In view of possible retaliation we kept a watch all night. It was clear
moonlight, and it would have been easy for the natives to track the boys to the
camp and treat us to a <i>camisade</i>. I did not doubt our joint ability to
defend ourselves, but what was to prevent the natives wreaking their revenge
(as is their custom) on the horses feeding out of our sight? Brusher insisted
that the blacks would not start in pursuit till they had eaten the last of
their two friends. We were not disturbed, which gives a colour to this theory,
but my mind was not so easy as Brusher's. The boys, who do not usually watch
with a good grace, were on the alert all night, even when "their watch was
below"&mdash;a circumstance which, I think, corroborates their story to some
extent.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 489}</u></p>
<p>August 30. All the horses have much improved at this camp except two of the
packers (Billy and Queensland); Billy, in fact, looks more wretched than ever.
I fancy he has eaten some POISON BUSH.</p>
<p>We <i>left Camp</i> 26 and held our way up the right bank of the Normanby
(S. 16&frac12;&deg; E., true). We soon entered on a low, flat country, and our
path lay across this for 3 miles. In the wet season, when the river overflows,
this flat must stand as a lake for some months. The trees (<i>melaleuca</i> and
Moreton Bay ash) were crusted with fine muddy sediment over our heads as we
rode. The soil was a stiff dry-baked clay. This is evidently the very place
where Hann struck the river when he discovered it in 1872.<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> In a mile and a half more on the same course, over
undulating country, we came to a low ridge from which we could see a sandstone
range about 10 miles to the east. This range was visible from the sandstone
hill I ascended on the 27th.</p>
<p>In 3 miles more, on the same course, we passed a broad swamp on the right,
alive with geese.</p>
<p>Four miles more, over rather flat country, recently burnt, with large
bloodwood and box trees, with recent conglomerate occasionally visible, brought
us again to the Normanby. We camped on some fine new feed between the river and
a chain of lagoons (CAMP 27). Although this camp is higher up the river than
that of the previous day, the river is four times as wide&mdash;a truly
magnificent sheet of water.</p>
<p>August 31. Leaving Camp 27, we continued up the right bank of the Normanby a
broad sheet of deep water flanked by scrubby alluvial flats. Our course lay
ENE. for 1 mile, SE. 1 mile, and E. (magnetic) 1 mile. At this point there are
rapids with a drop of about 6 feet over a recent conglomerate or "cement" bed.
Above the fall the sheet of water is at least a quarter of a mile in breadth.
The banks are lower than below the fall, but except on the marshes and lake
bottoms we passed yesterday there is no sign of the country being subject to
floods. Just above the fall the skeleton of a crocodile was found on the top of
the bank. In 1 mile more (magnetic east) we left the Normanby<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and followed up a branch of the river for 1 mile
further to magnetic east, 4 miles to magnetic south-east, 1 mile east (true),
and 1 mile magnetic north-east. By this time it became evident that we had left
the main river and were following a tributary rising far to the east and
draining the south side of the sandstone mountains which we had lately crossed.
The creek had a rapidly running stream equal in</p>

River."&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 490}</u></p>
<p>volume to the Endeavour River at Webb's Crossing. It had a sandy bed, with
the teatrees and Moreton Bay ash characteristic in this latitude of large
water-courses in poor country. The banks of the creek were choked with
brushwood and very poorly grassed&mdash;a marked contrast to the fertile banks
of the Endeavour. We crossed to the left bank, and found that another river of
equal volume<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> was flowing in the same direction
within a quarter of a mile. We camped between the two (CAMP 28). I learn from
Hann's journal that he made the very same mistake that we did in following this
creek up under the impression that it was the Normanby. The keen eyes of the
black boy saw the place where we left the river, but I was not informed of this
till we had camped.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>September 1. We left Camp 28 early in the morning, and having crossed the
southmost creek ["JACK RIVER"] struck due south. In half a mile we came to a
long lagoon stretching east and west, and after heading it (half a mile east)
continued on our southward course. In 4 miles, across rather barren country,
with bloodwood and ironbark timber, we passed by the east end of another large
lagoon. In a quarter of a mile more a third-magnitude creek was crossed,
running west, and in half a mile more we struck the COEN TRACK. For the last 3
or 4 miles of our journey we met with abundant evidence of the recent passage
of a large number of NATIVES.</p>
<p>After a hurried consultation with Macdonald and Grainer regarding the
condition of the horses and the quantity of our rations and ammunition, it was
agreed that the horses might carry us through, but that we should have to go on
a short allowance of the necessaries of life, trusting to eke out the quantity
with game. The task we set before ourselves was an arduous one, but one and all
cheerfully accepted the risks and privations rather than go back baffled.</p>
<p>The track which we followed from this point to the Coen diggings turned out
to be in places very indistinct. It was difficult to believe that not much more
than a twelvemonth ago two thousand horses had beaten it. A line of trees was
marked, but it was sometimes "a far cry" from one blaze to the next.</p>
<p>In 2 miles NNW., we passed a large lagoon on the left. Five GINS were
surprised here engaged in digging lily-roots on the edge of the lagoon. They
ran away at first, one gin leaving her child behind, but they shortly
approached and jabbered volubly. The women had straight hair. One of them had a
child about three days old, and it was interesting to note that it was marked
with the boiled-lobster tint common among white children of the same</p>

miles east of my Camp 28. Alluvial gold has been worked at its head.&mdash;R.

<p>age. The women stood in line and pointed with their left hands along the
track, reminding me of the witches in "Macbeth." They were understood by the
boys to mean that their men were in that direction, and that we should go
another way to avoid a collision. One gesture of the "weird sisters" surprised
and puzzled us all. All at once each caught hold of her breasts and squirted
milk towards us in copious streams. Perhaps they meant that they were entitled
to our consideration as women and mothers. The party we met before had
distinctly a sense of modesty, but this party had absolutely none; so that I am
still unable to say, from my own observation, whether modesty is an instinct in
the unsophisticated orders of mankind or an acquired habit of mind.</p>
<p>In half a mile more we came on a man cooking at a fire by the side of a
lagoon. He ran away like a deer and hid among the reeds, leaving his all
behind&mdash;some eggs, some roots, an opossum just singed, a spear and wimmera
and some bamboo fishingspears. A snake was roasting on the ashes.</p>
<p>The track kept a general NNW. (magnetic) direction. For the first 2 miles it
wound among lagoons, with fine green picking for horses. At the end of the 2
miles, the NORMANBY came in sight. For the next 4 miles (to the "lower
crossing") we passed through poor bush country parallel with the river. The
trees were frequently crusted with muddy sediment above the blazes, which were
at the height of a man's hand on horseback. This part of the road must be
DEEPLY SUBMERGED DURING THE WET SEASON. The track was very hard to follow, and
we often missed it.</p>
<p>We crossed the river at the "lower crossing" and camped on its left bank,
where there was sweet young grass for the horses. (CAMP 29: bloodwood, J.
1/9/79.) The track crosses the river by a conglomerate bar which dams back a
long reach of deep water. In view of the proximity of natives probably in large
numbers (for we saw many fires among the lagoons)&mdash;we kept watch all
night.</p>
<p>September 2. Leaving Camp 29 (by the track) magnetic west through level
country with pretty good feed&mdash;the grass having been burned about three
weeks before&mdash;in 2 miles we reached a large second-magnitude creek, with a
bottom of recent sandstone, or "cement," said to be the Laura. What are called
the Laura and the Kennedy, on the Coen track, are said to have been traced from
the Palmerville and Cooktown road by parties running them down to the Coen
diggings; otherwise I should have said that the creek now crossed was not half
the size the Laura should have attained after travelling so far. [The
"second-magnitude creek" was, in fact, the KENNEDY RIVER. The Laura falls into
the Normanby, breaking through its left bank, about 15 miles above Camp 29. The
Kennedy falls into the Normanby, breaking through its left bank, about 7 miles
below Camp 29.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>The next 5 miles were over low, level country for the most</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 492}</u></p>
<p>part bare of timber, there being only a few stunted Moreton Bay ash trees
scattered about. Little lagoons are frequent, and abound in native companions
and geese. The whole of this country had been recently burned and carried rich
green grass. We resolved to spell the horses here for two days. Queensland and
Billy were both picking up, and Coen had now little the matter with him. Two
days on these FERTILE PLAINS should set the horses all up for a time. The
country would make a few good cattle runs. The subsoil is a grey, friable loam.
The land is not subject to floods, although most of the open plains must be
swampy, and perhaps covered with a few inches of water in the rainy season.</p>
<p>We camped beside a lagoon where Grainer said game of all sorts abounded at
the time of his former visit. We were less lucky. Brusher managed to bag three
parrots and two teals at the expense of a great deal of ammunition. The fact
that the last of our beef was "on the table" at supper-time gave us a keener
interest in the shooting than that of mere sportsmen. (CAMP 30: Moreton Bay
ash, J. 2/9/79.) I fixed the latitude of this camp at 14&deg; 57' 49" S. This
was the first reliable observation taken, as hitherto the nights had either
been too cloudy to see the stars at their transit, or the moonlight had made
the image reflected in the mercurial horizon indistinct. On the coast side of
the range this mattered little, as I was generally able to determine my
position by bearings to points on the coast.</p>
<p>Just as I had finished my observations, a sudden stampede among the horses
convinced us that the BLACKS were disturbing them. They snorted and capered
about in a state of high excitement and alarm. We sallied out armed, but saw no
enemy, and found the horses unhurt after we had with great difficulty collected
them.</p>
<p>September 3. When the boys were mustering the horses in the morning, they
heard the voices of natives. This rendered it probable that the natives really
had a look at the horses during the night. As we could not afford to lose
another horse, we abandoned our intention of spelling the horses here.</p>
<p>We left Camp 30 at 8 a.m. The track, which is here welldefined, keeps
magnetic west. In one mile the soft-soiled plainand-lagoon country ended and
was replaced by gently rolling, hard-bottomed open forest land strewn with
little pebbles (coated with iron oxide) from the recent conglomerates. The
trees were mostly bloodwood. In half a mile more the loamy soil reappeared,
with small lagoons and a few open plains&mdash;rarely swampy. The grass had
been burned about three weeks before, and there was abundance of short, sweet
feed.</p>
<p>Four miles from the camp we passed a little lagoon on the right hand, with
the ridge-poles and pegs of a tent still standing. Just beyond this lagoon the
track bends to magnetic NW. In 2 miles a large swamp was passed on the left,
with geese in great numbers.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 493}</u></p>
<p>In 1 mile further we passed a tree marked with a broad arrow over 120, on
the right-hand side of the road, by the edge of a chain of lagoons.</p>
<p>In half a mile more Macdonald brought down an EMU with the Snider on a large
open plain. It supplied the camp with fresh meat for three days.</p>
<p>Two miles further we passed a large lagoon on the left. In 2&frac12; miles
more a lagoon abounding in white geese and pelicans was passed on the right
side of the road in a wide open plain.</p>
<p>In 2&frac12; miles we reached the Kennedy River running north and camped on
its right bank. [Grainer said it was called the Kennedy by the travelling
diggers on the Coen rush. It is what now appears on the maps as the "North
Kennedy," but ought to bear the name cf Therrimburi Creek, by which its
principal head is known. It lies west, not north, of the Kennedy River, and
there are "Kennedy Rivers" enough to lead to confusion.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>From the emu plain to the Kennedy [i.e., the so-called "North Kennedy" or
Therrimburi Creek.&mdash;R. L. J.] the country is alternately open forest and
unwooded plains. The timber is well grown, and chiefly consists of bloodwood,
with a sprinkling of box and Moreton Bay ash. The plains are studded with
GIGANTIC white ANT-HILLS, and look like graveyards. The boys killed a large
carpet snake at the camp.</p>
<p>The Kennedy [the so-called "North Kennedy" or Therrimburi Creek.&mdash;R. L.
J.] is a most disappointing river. It is difficult to realise that this
insignificant dribble of water is the river named after the unfortunate
explorer who followed its course five-andthirty years ago. [As a matter of
fact, it is <i>not</i> the same river.&mdash;R. L. J.] It has a single narrow
channel with a rivulet meandering through it, and has no scrub on its banks. A
single large teatree overhangs the right bank and bridges the stream across.
The stream is three times as large 50 miles higher up at the Cooktown and
Palmerville road.</p>
<p>Observations of Vega and Arided made the latitude of this camp 14&deg; 33'
9" S. (CAMP 31, Kennedy River: Moreton Bay ash, J. 3/9/ l879.)</p>
<p>September 4. Left Camp 31, the track still keeping north-west (magnetic). A
quarter of a mile from the Kennedy [Therrimburi Creek.&mdash;R. L. J.] we
crossed an anabranch or tributary nearly as large as the river itself, but
dried up to water-holes. Its junction with the river was visible from the
track.</p>
<p>Two miles from the Kennedy [Therrimburi Creek], we crossed the bed of a
large river, with several channels, running north-northwest, but dried up to
water-holes. This stream has a rocky bottom (recent "cement-conglomerate"). It
has no banks to speak of, its bed being only 3 or 4 feet below the level of the
surrounding country. I fancy this must be the river named the "HANN"</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 494}</u></p>
<p>by MULLIGAN. [It could not have been the Hann River.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In 3&frac12; miles further we crossed a large deep sandy RIVER BED, dried up
to water-holes, with a few palms (Seaforthia) on its banks. In 3 miles more we
crossed another deep sandy RIVER BED (not so large as the last), also dried up
to water-holes. A few palms and Leichhardt trees graced its banks. [Mulligan's
WARNER RIVER, the "STATION CREEK" of the modern 4-mile map. Here I must have
crossed Kennedy's track of 27th September, 1848.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In 4&frac14; miles further we crossed to a large bare creek, with a bottom
of recent sandstone or cement, with large water-holes connected by a narrow
stream, running north-east. [The HANN RIVER (named by MULLIGAN in 1875) below
its junction with Morehead River.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In another mile an isolated mountain (the first landmark seen for some days)
bore N. 39&deg; E. It seemed about 15 miles distant. [The "JANE
TABLELAND,"<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> 22 miles distant.]</p>
<p>Two miles further on we entered on a wide OPEN PLAIN, crab-holed in places.
It must be a swamp in wet weather. It appears to extend north-east and
south-west for at least 10 miles. On our course we crossed it in 5 miles, and
found SALTWATER CREEK at its further boundary. We camped on a chain of lagoons
on the right bank. The water was very muddy, having been recently disturbed by
the digging of lily-roots. (CAMP 32, Saltwater Creek.)</p>
<p>The NATIVES were BURNING THE GRASS all over the open plains. We saw three
gins at the water-holes, but they ran away. The boys started a black fellow
from his lair in the long grass by the lagoon near our camp; he ran away,
leaving behind him a spear and fishing-net. The spear was destroyed by the
boys. [My track from the Hann River to Saltwater Creek was also Kennedy's.
While he was crossing these same plains in October, 1848, the natives were
burning the grass.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>The country passed over on this day's march was poorer than that of the
preceding day, the soil being more sandy; still it was fair second-class
pastoral land. The timber was for the most part bloodwood, with a few box and
ironbark trees: on the low ground pandanus, cabbage tree and tea tree.</p>
<p>From the camp the mountain observed in the early part of the day subtended
an angle of 2 degrees from E. 26&deg; N. to E. 24&deg; N. (true). It has
apparently a capping of sandstone. Its position must be near the bottom of
Princess Charlotte Bay&mdash;probably between the mouths of SALTWATER CREEK and
the [combined] KENNEDY [and NORMANBY.&mdash;R. L. J.].</p>
<blockquote>[1) Kennedy saw the "Jane Tableland," 4th October, 1848. It must
therefore have been on the Coast Chart which he carried. It was named by King
in 1821.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 495}</u></p>
<p>The kangaroo dog killed a bandicoot&mdash;its sole achievement on the
journey.</p>
<p>We kept a watch all night, as we knew that natives were camped near us.</p>
<p>September 5. In the morning, as we were packing up, two BLACKS reconnoitred
us from a distance of about a furlong. Having satisfied their curiosity, they
lighted a fire and made themselves comfortable.</p>
<p>Grainer had, on his previous trip, turned back at Saltwater Creek, having
met there with troops of diggers returning from the Coen with discouraging
reports. We were therefore without any information as to the remainder of our
journey.</p>
<p>SALTWATER CREEK, when we crossed it, was running a strong current of salt
water, the tide being near its ebb. The tide rises about 4 feet at the
crossing. The track runs the right bank up for about a mile. It cost us three
hours' time to pick up the track on the left bank, which is flanked by a double
and sometimes treble chain of deep lagoons. North of the creek the track bore
W. 36&deg; N. (true) through a very gently rising country, with a light sandy
soil supporting a well-grown forest of bloodwood and stringybark and a few
ironbarks. In 3 miles we passed a swamp on the left.</p>
<p>From this point the track bore N. 44&deg; W. (true), through similar
country. In 3 miles we crossed a sandy water-course of the third magnitude.</p>
<p>After 7 miles more of poor, flat, sandy country, mostly timbered with tea
trees and bloodwood, with a few pandanus and cabbage trees, we came to a
fourth-magnitude creek. On running it up for half a mile we found a water-hole,
containing about enough for ourselves and the horses for one night. We camped
on the left bank. Beside the creek we found some OLD CAMPS, and a tree marked
"James Gillige." (CAMP 33: Moreton Bay ash, J. 5/9/79. Latitude 14&deg; 34'
17".)</p>
<p>September 6. We made a late start, the horses having split up in the night
owing to the poor quality of the grass; half of them were found at a large
creek, with plenty of water, to the north-east. There was also plenty of water
higher up the creek on which we were camped. In a quarter of a mile (to
magnetic NW.) we crossed from the right to the left bank of a third-magnitude
creek, with water-holes and OLD CAMPS beside them. The creek on which we camped
last night must fall into this one. In half a mile more we crossed from the
right to the left bank of another thirdmagnitude creek with water in a muddy
hole.</p>
<p>Five miles from the camp we came to a fourth-magnitude creek [a tributary of
the ANNIE RIVER] with cabbage trees, plenty of water and traces of camping. Up
to this point we had crossed poor, flat country, with teatree and bloodwood.
Here it is</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 496}</u></p>
<p>evident from the soil that granite begins to replace the
"sandstone-cement."</p>
<p>In 2 miles, after crossing a large open plain (with a bush fire raging on
our right) we entered a belt of ENORMOUSLY TALL and close STRINGYBARK AND
BLOODWOOD FOREST. The white ants had crusted more than half the trees, up to 20
or 30 feet from the ground, with a red mortar. This and the subdued light which
penetrated the dense and lofty foliage gave a strange sort of sunset effect
even at midday. The trees are so closely grown together that it must be very
difficult to manoeuvre a dray among them. The forest occupies the crown of a
very gentle rise. The soil is reddish, and apparently derived from the
decomposition of a ferruginous schist. The forest was 2 miles across.</p>
<p>Another gentle rise, a mile across, is covered with open forest of bloodwood
and stringybark. At its north-west side we crossed from the right to the left
bank of a large third-magnitude creek with a deep sandy bed (granitic
sand).</p>
<p>A quarter of a mile further on we came to a large second-magnitude creek. It
had a broad sandy bed, partly choked up with teatrees. We ran the creek up for
about half a mile (west) and crossed to the left bank.</p>
<p>After a mile and a half on a course of W. 26&deg; N. (true) through poor
country (teatree and quinine tree bush), we caught sight of some
mountains&mdash;the first we had seen for some days. They subtended an angle of
72 degrees (from W. 36&deg; S. to W. 36&deg; N., true). A mile and a half over
gently undulating poor land timbered with bloodwood and stringybark took us to
a chain of water-holes, on whose right bank we camped. (CAMP 34: gum marked J.
6/9/79.) [HANN crossed this, the ANNIE RIVER, in 1872, between his 35th and
36th camps.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>A pheasant, bandicoot and iguana made up to-day's game list.</p>
<p>This seems to have been a favourite camping-place. We found trees marked
"July 10, 1878"; "R.S., 1878"; and "July 21, 1878, G.H." Latitude 14&deg; 23'
21" S.</p>
<p>September 7. On leaving Camp 34 we followed the track, which bore away W.
36&deg; N. (true) for one mile and W. 28&frac12;&deg; N. (true) for 2 miles,
through open bloodwood and stringybark forest, when we crossed in 2 miles a
fourth-magnitude creek flowing freely (over bars of recent gritty "cement"),
with remains of old camps. [Tributaries of BALCLUTHA CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.]
Mountains were now visible to the south.</p>
<p>In 1 mile more, on the same course, a gentle ascent began, and the "bedrock"
became visible for the first time since we left the sandstone ranges east of
the Normanby&mdash;a very peculiar reddish granite, with tin-white mica and
very little felspar. A change in the timber commenced with the change in the
soil, small ironbarks being mixed with the usual stringybark and bloodwood
trees.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 497}</u></p>
<p>In 2 miles further (to the north-west) the track led up to the summit of a
granite ridge, covered with well-grown bloodwood, stringybark and ironbark
timber, about 200 feet above the level of the plain.</p>
<p>In 1 mile to the north-west, over very easy ridges, we crossed from right to
left bank of a fourth-magnitude creek with considerable water-holes. We found
trees on the left bank marked "W.R.," "C.J.," and "C.N."</p>
<p>In 2 miles more on the same course, with a gradual sinuous ascent, the track
reached a saddle in the range about 600 feet above the level of the plains
which we left in the morning. The rock was a granite, of loosely aggregated
quartz granules, tin-white mica and very little felspar, with outcrops of
gneiss here and there. On the saddle was a tree marked "M.F." On this range the
BLOODWOOD TREES attain an ENORMOUS SIZE; the stringybarks do not enlarge with
the increased altitude; the ironbarks are large, though not numerous.</p>
<p>The track led for half a mile from the saddle north-westward down the right
bank of a gully which it then crossed, and for a mile and three-quarters, with
a very easy descent, to the right bank of a gully falling to the north. Having
run this down a quarter of a mile, the track crossed to the left bank and
continued to the northeast for 1 mile&mdash;the greater part of the way along
the right bank of a deep fourth-magnitude creek with water-holes and the
remains of a camp.</p>
<p>About half a mile to the north-west over an easy ridge, with lofty bloodwood
and stringybark timber, we crossed a fine creek of the second magnitude, with
Leichhardt and teatrees in its sandy bed. This creek has two channels, but
neither yielded a drop of water, though we searched for about a mile up and
down. There can be little doubt that this is what HANN named "BALCLUTHA CREEK"
when he crossed it nearer the sea. [Between his 33rd and 34th camps, 7th
September, 1872.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In 2 miles to N. 39&deg; W. (true), mostly descending through open bloodwood
and stringybark country, we came to a water-course with deep water-holes and
lilies, and the remains of an old camp. [SEE MAP F.] We crossed it and pitched
our tents on the left bank. (CAMP 35: Moreton Bay ash, marked broad arrow, J.
7/9/79. Latitude 14&deg; 16' 12" S.) [Main stream of BALCLUTHA CREEK.&mdash;R.
L. J.]</p>
<p>Three bandicoots and a pheasant furnished a sumptuous dinner.</p>
<p>September 8. The track, continuing to N. 39&deg; W. (true), took us in
2&frac12; miles over level country with a bottom of recent "cement" to a
third-magnitude creek running north-north-east; in 2 miles more, to a
fourth-magnitude creek with water in "cement"; in 1 mile further, to a second,
or third-magnitude creek (dry) with "cement" bars, falling to north-north-east;
and in one mile</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 498}</u></p>
<p>and a quarter further, to a granite knob about 300 feet high, which I
ascended (naming it "View Hill"). A very extensive series of bearings was
obtained from this eminence, and utilised in the construction of the MAP
ACCOMPANYING THIS REPORT. [This knob is named "FOX'S LOOKOUT" on recent
maps.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In half a mile we crossed a creek of the third magnitude with a sandy
bottom&mdash;the forks and ridge-poles of several tents still standing.
["SPRING CREEK" of recent maps.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>The track here altered its course to N. 16&frac12;&deg; W. (true). In 2
miles it crossed a sandy third-magnitude creek with water.</p>
<p>In one mile and a half on the same course we came to a large first-magnitude
creek or river, not less than 60 yards wide, with a goodly stream of water
running to the east. It has several channels, with large Leichhardt trees on
banks and islands. The bottom is granite. One horse laden with flour sank in a
quicksand, and had to be unpacked in a hurry and helped out. This is the river
which HANN named the STEWART. It was the northern limit of his journey.</p>
<p>All the creeks crossed on this day's march, except the one we left in the
morning, fall into the Stewart.</p>
<p>One mile to magnetic north brought us by a very gentle slope to the summit
of a granite ridge, about 150 feet above the river. Another mile N.
16&frac12;&deg; W. (true) took us across a valley, about a mile from its head,
which drains to WSW. into the Stewart, and up to the summit of the ridge
forming the right wall of the valley. From this point (about 500 feet above the
Stewart) another series of bearings was obtained.</p>
<p>The granite of this ridge is very coarse-grained, with large flakes and
crystals of tin-white mica and crystals of orthoclase felspar, sometimes 2
inches in length. The felspar crystals are almost always flecked with mica. A
good deal of white vitreouslooking quartz is scattered about.</p>
<p>Half a mile north took us, by easy zigzags, across the head of another
valley to the crown of another ridge, about 200 feet higher. In half a mile to
N. 39&deg; W., we came to a gully with two water-holes, falling to the
south-west. As there was fine burnt feed here for the horses, we camped on the
right bank of the gully. We prospected up the gully, and got much black sand
but no gold. (CAMP 36: box, broad-arrow, J. 8/9/79. Latitude 14&deg; 5' 20"
S.)</p>
<p>September 9. The track continued to N. 39&deg; W. and brought us in half a
mile to the crown of a tableland of granite with "blows" of quartz. [SEE MAP
C.] The timber is ironbark, bloodwood and small white gum. The track next led
due north for a mile over similar country, with similar timber, when an outcrop
of mica-schist was seen, striking north-north-west.</p>
<p>In a quarter of a mile more, magnetic north-west, View Hill,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 499}</u></p>
<p>and many of the peaks recognisable from that eminence, were sighted and
their bearings taken.</p>
<p>In half a mile on the same course we crossed a creek of the second or third
magnitude, with a granite bottom, and a fair stream of water flowing to the
south. The left bank bore numerous traces of camping, and, besides, the
following inscriptions:</p>
<pre>
               NOTICE
M. FOX.         TAKE     W. STEWART.
July 21, '78.  WRIGHT
                COE
</pre>
<p>The trees were defaced with indecent drawings rudely cut out with
tomahawks&mdash;a sure sign that the artists were getting nothing, and waiting
idly for news from the parties at work at the Coen. [Provisionally] I called
this creek "Notice Creek," as some of the diggers may recognise it from the
gigantic inscriptions above quoted. It is one of the heads of the Stewart
River. [It is the "LITTLE STEWART RIVER" of modern maps.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>We next followed the track W. 28&frac12;&deg; N. (true) for 1 mile up easy
slopes draining into Notice Creek, and for half a mile down (through granite
country) to a second-magnitude creek, with a good body of water flowing slowly
to the south-west. A large "blow" of white quartz runs east and west on the
right bank. Three conical peaks occur down the right bank, within a mile of the
track, while the left wall of the valley is formed of rounded granite
mountains. This creek also is, in all probability, a head of the Stewart
River.</p>
<p>The next 3 miles, on a course of N. 39&deg; W. (true), were chiefly on the
north-east side of a porphyry ridge, and brought us to a thirdmagnitude creek
flowing from the east. In a mile and a half more, in the same direction, across
sharp ridges, with sugar-loaf cones to right and left, we crossed to the right
bank of a third-magnitude creek running in a very confined valley to the
south-west. We followed the right bank down for a quarter of a mile, and found
a temporary yard, some horse tracks (newer than the spring rains), and a railed
grave. It would be impossible to say, without following them down, whether this
and the creek last passed fall into the Stewart, or feed the [South] Coen or
the Lukin [Holroyd] and drain into the Gulf of Carpentaria. [It is "STATION
CREEK," which falls into the STEWART, and on which LALLA ROOKH Station is now
situated.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>We then followed the track in a general direction of W. 28&frac12; N. (true)
for 4 miles through very broken stony country, with a line of conical peaks on
our left. The peaks were twelve in number, and we named them the "TWELVE
APOSTLES." Next, having followed a gully down for a mile to its junction with a
creek of the third magnitude, we crossed from the left to the right bank of
the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 500}</u></p>
<p>latter and travelled for a mile due north, across a patch of wellgrassed,
open country, nearly level a fine site for a township or small station. [The
site is now occupied by the TOWNSHIP OF COEN.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>The path now led us across a third-magnitude creek (SHANTY CREEK) with a
killing yard, and the ruinous remains of a shanty on its further or right bank,
near its junction with the so-called Coen River. We camped here between the
river and the creek (CAMP 37). Latitude of the [South] Coen River Mining Camp,
13&deg; 53' 42" S. (determined by observations of Vega and Arided).</p>
<p>As we approached the site of the old diggings, signal fires broke out on the
Twelve Apostles, in advance of us, in such a manner as to leave no doubt in our
minds that the ABORIGINALS (themselves unseen) were honouring our progress with
their serious attention. Their object could not have been to molest us by
burning the grass, as the valleys had been burned two or three weeks
previously, and afforded abundance of sweet grass, too green to burn.</p>
<p>Brusher shot a small kangaroo, which furnished us with fresh meat for two
days.</p>
<p>In 1876, a party of fifteen went out to PROSPECT THE PENINSULA. They split
up about the [South] Coen into three parties. The party who remained here
(Messrs. Sefton, Verge, Watson and Goodenough) got on GOLD about September,
1876. They returned to Cooktown in December of the same year, with 60 ounces of
gold among them. They returned to the same ground in May, 1877, and stayed till
December, when they came back to Cooktown with 140 ounces. The prospectors, in
consideration of &pound;200 subscribed in Cooktown, marked out the track in
February, 1878, and were followed by a crowd of diggers. The diggings continued
till about July, 1878, when they were abandoned.</p>
<p>The prospectors, and the diggers who followed them to the rush, believed
that they were on the COEN RIVER [of Carstenszoon, 1623], which enters the Gulf
of Carpentaria in 12&deg; 13' S. lat. 5 but, as already mentioned, the camp is
in 13&deg; 53' 42" S. As I then and afterwards followed the river down for
nearly 20 miles to the west, and found several large rivers between it and the
latitude of the Coen, I have no doubt that the river, instead of the COEN, is
the KENDALL CREEK, crossed by the Messrs. Jardine, in 14&deg; S. latitude, on
their famous journey to Cape York in 1864-5.</p>
<p>[My conjecture, as above, proved no less erroneous than that of the
prospectors. Later maps show that the "Coen" of the goldfield, which I propose,
following Mr. J. T. Embley, who has surveyed the river, to call the SOUTH COEN,
falls into the ARCHER RIVER in long. 142&deg; 16' E. Various positions have
been assigned to the river named the Coen by Jan Carstenszoon, Commander of the
"<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" expedition in 1623, and it still appeared
till recently in official maps as falling into the Gulf of Carpentaria in
12&deg; 15' S. lat. A river named the PENNEFATHER appears in that latitude in
the 4-mile map of Cape York Peninsula issued by the Lands Department in 1908.
It had been visited by Flinders in 1802 and mistaken by him for the Coen.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 501}</u></p>
<p>The true position of the DUTCH COEN (which was named in honour of Jan
Pieterszoon Coen, Governor of the Dutch East India Company) is settled by the
publication of Jan Carstenszoon's diary in <i>The Part borne by the Dutch in
the Discovery of Australia, 1606-1765</i>," by Professor J. E. Heeres, LL.D.
London, Luzac &amp; Co., 1899. The Journal gives the latitude 'as 13&deg; 7'
S., i.f. t between Pera Heads and the mouth of the Watson River. There is
nothing in the Diary to indicate that the "Coen Revier" was a water-course of
any importance: all that is recorded of it is that it yielded "salad herbs." An
inlet in 13&deg; 4' S. has been mapped by the Mapoon missionaries, and there is
no reason to doubt that this is the true Dutch Coen.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>The aspect of the site of the rush differed but little at the date of our
visit from that of other abandoned diggings. The first thing to strike the eyes
of one who had travelled more than 250 miles from the nearest civilised
dwelling was, of course, the building which had done duty as public-house and
store&mdash;a rough frame of saplings, with walls and roof of messmate bark,
and with a bar fashioned out of barrel-staves and the timbers of brandy and gin
cases, opening on the verandah. Hundreds of bottles, mammoth heaps of bones and
scores of jam-, butter- and sardine-tins attested that, for a time at least,
good living was the order of the day. A hundred yards off, across a gully,
stood the killing-yard, still in good repair. Two miles up the river was the
PROSPECTORS' HUT, strongly built of squared logs, LOOPHOLED AND
SPEAR-PROOF&mdash;the stronghold in which the four stout hearts held their own
against all the native population of the Peninsula. Here and there a
bough-shed, a few groups of charred tent-pegs or ridge-poles, and occasionally
the frame of a "bunk," were all that remained of the less ambitious dwellings
at the time of our visit.</p>
<p>The last to abandon the place had buried in the shanty about half a ton of
flour, with drapery, crockery, groceries, tools and cooking utensils, partly
with a view of not letting them fall into the hands of the blacks and partly in
the hope of the stores being useful if the place should still turn out well. We
found the whole untouched, but hopelessly damaged by water, the rain from the
roof having found its way in the wet season through the funnels (hollow trees)
provided for ventilation. The very "high" smell of the decaying flour led us
for a time to believe in the proximity of an extensive deposit of fine old
cheese. As we were the last who could possibly benefit by it, we saved all the
flour that we could (about 14 lb.) by drying it in the sun and parching it in
the fryingpan. Thus cured, it was baked into dampers for the dogs, and, as far
as it went, saved our little store.</p>
<p>Considering what prizes the tomahawks, saws, shovels and other iron tools
would have been for the blacks, we were not a little surprised that the cellar
had not been rifled. As a rule, the natives fashion, with infinite pains, such
unconsidered trifles of old iron as shovels, broken pick-heads, scraps of iron
hoops, ship's bolts, telegraph wire, cart-wheel tires and the like into weapons
and implements, with which they perform prodigies in the way of
tree-felling,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 502}</u></p>
<p>etc. In the present instance, besides the buried iron implements, there were
many pick-heads, shovels, etc., lying loose on the ground near the different
camps.</p>
<p>September 10. Spent the day in plotting the <i>route</i> and making skeleton
maps for use during the remainder of the trip, utilising the "bar" as a
drawing-table. Macdonald and Grainer were set to work washing the sand in the
river bed. They got small specks of gold in every dish, but not enough to pay
for a white man's food.</p>
<p>September 11. About 2 miles north of the shanty, the river [the South Coen]
tumbles merrily out of a gorge forming a series of cascades over thick, nearly
vertical beds of greywacke, whose strike is from north to south. The greywacke
beds form the crowns of the hills on both banks of the river, as well as the
most constricted parts of the gorge. In the other parts of the river bed, as
well as on the hills, nothing but granite is seen. The granite has large
roundish grains of quartz, orthoclase felspar in crystals up to 2 inches in
length, and tin-white mica, sometimes occurring in large plates. We prospected
above the gorge, but got no gold.</p>
<p>Above the gorge, the river comes from the east for about half a mile. The
upper part of its course is from north to south, or a little to the east of
north. For 2 miles above the gorge it is flanked by pretty high hills on the
right bank, with comparatively low rolling granite hills on the left bank. We
prospected 2 miles above the gorge and got much magnetic iron sand with fine
"colours" of gold. About 3 miles higher the valley gets very narrow, with
granite "tors" on the right bank.</p>
<p>Below the gorge, a low gap divides the waters of the "Coen" (or Kendall)
from a valley [ROLL CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.] falling northward into the Peach
River. We got colours in the bed of the Kendall (?) below the gorge. On an
alluvial flat, on the right bank of the river, here, was the Two-MiLE CAMP.
Near this camp, a third-magnitude creek, with large water-holes (PANDANUS
CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.], falls into the river. A large white quartz reef crosses
it twice in an east and west direction. Above the lower crossing of the reef, a
patch of alluvium on the left bank has been diligently tested in numerous
shafts. In one of these we got fair "colours," as well as in the creek itself.
A ravine known as the TWO-MILE GULLY falls into the right bank of the creek,
and here the wash has been worked out. It was from this ravine that the
prospectors got the bulk of their GOLD. Their FORTIFIED hut, already referred
to, stands on the right bank of the creek between the ravine and the river.</p>
<p>I ascended the hills behind the hut and found them composed of foliated
brownish mica-schist and quartzite. From the top 1 could see to the NNW. down
the valley [CROLL CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.] above referred to as draining into the
Peach River, to a high</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 503}</u></p>
<p>conical mountain [MOUNT CROLL], apparently about 10 miles off [8 miles,
actually.&mdash;R. L. J.].</p>
<p>A well-beaten horse track was found to lead from the fortified camp through
a low gap to W. 16&frac12;&deg; S. (true). Half a mile from the camp, the track
crosses a quartz reef, 6 or 8 feet wide, running W. 30&deg; N. and traceable
for 100 yards, with iron-stained cavities and interlacing dog-tooth crystals of
quartz along lines of joint. A good deal of picking had been done on this reef,
and "specimens" showing gold had been obtained. The "surface" and alluvium of a
small gully draining the reef had also been worked. We obtained "colours" in
the surface, and from some of the quartz which we broke up we obtained small
"colours" and a little cloud of almost impalpable GOLD DUST.</p>
<p>A quarter of a mile further, a dyke (NNW. to SSE.) of compact silicated
felstone, 4 feet in width, crosses the track. A mile beyond this the track
divides and dies out.</p>
<p>September 12. Prospected up the river with the results related (for the sake
of connection) under date 11th September.</p>
<p>September 13. We followed a track up the right bank of Shanty Creek (ENE.).
For the first mile we had gently rolling country. Then the track ascended by
two steep pinches (granite) to the top of the tableland, after which it went
parallel with the creek (NE.).</p>
<p>Four miles up the creek from its mouth, we crossed a large reef, with red
iron oxide strings and leaders in it. This reef was traceable for some distance
to north and south.</p>
<p>Half a mile higher (after the track has crossed to the left bank), a reef, 4
feet in width, occurs on the left side of the track. It runs north and south
and has a distinct hanging wall on the east side. It contains very good-looking
stone, red and yellow in joints, with crystalline cavities, the faces of the
small crystals stained red with iron oxide.</p>
<p>Half a mile higher, we saw the remains of a CAMP, extending for half a mile
on the right bank of the stream. One dam stands entire A good deal of work has
been done, chiefly in the bed of the creek. There is a good deal of quartz in
the stream, but, to judge by our own success in prospecting, the workings must
have been far from remunerative. The bed of the creek here is divided by bars
of granite into long deep reaches. Long races and flood-races and numerous
toms, cradles, etc., attest the activity of the work.</p>
<p>Nearer the mouth of the same creek, about a mile and a half above the
shanty, a long bar of granite runs diagonally across the creek, and here the
bed of the stream has been sluiced, with small success.</p>
<p>On the crown of the hill between the river and Shanty Creek we found a reef
running north and south. It is rather a double coating of quartz crystals on
the opposite faces of a long joint in the granite. The quartz crystals are dyed
blood-red, and I have</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 504}</u></p>
<p>no doubt that at a greater depth the interspaces are filled with
"brownstone" and pyrites.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the long land carriage from Cooktown, which must
add about a shilling per pound to the price of all the necessaries of life
(except meat), the poor quality of the gold (which had a very large proportion
of silver, and in some cases was actually worth no more than 30s. per ounce),
and lastly, the limited quantity obtainable, I came to the conclusion that the
alluvial diggings of the so-called "Coen" would not employ white men at a
remunerative rate. They might, however, pay Chinese labour.<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> The QUARTZ REEFS, however, MIGHT PAY TO WORK if
machinery were on the spot.</p>
<p>September 14. Having taken stock of our flour, I determined to push out to
the north for two or three days. Leaving our camp (No. 37), we passed the
"Two-Mile Camp," and steered N. 16&frac12;&deg; W. (true). In 2&frac12; miles
we were clear of the valley of the Coen (or Kendall), our travelling being all
through good secondclass pastoral country. The same hollow between the main
range and the isolated mountain mass to the west continued for 2 miles further,
when a long deep valley opened into it from the main range. The creek (CROLL
CREEK) which forms this valley, after emerging from the mountains, falls to the
north-north-west. In 2 miles from the mouth of the lateral valley the hills on
the west die out. I ascended a little hill (white compact quartzite) and saw
clear open country for about 20 miles from NNW. to WNW., when a not very high
range subtended the greater part of that angle.</p>
<p>After 2 miles of travelling along the left bank of the creek, we were
abreast of the conspicuous pinnacle seen from the hill behind the fortified
camp. I named it MOUNT CROLL, after my former colleague, Dr. James Croll, the
distinguished author of Climate and Time.</p>
<p>At Mount Croll we crossed the creek. It was here of the second magnitude,
with a deep broad sandy bottom, divided into two channels. It had, however, but
little water. [The Cape York Telegraph line (constructed 1886) follows our
<i>route</i> from Balclutha Creek to Mount Croll.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In a mile and a half to the north we touched a headland of the main range
(granite). We packed some washdirt from behind a granite bar in a little dry
gully to the next water, but on washing it we got no gold. I ascended the point
and took bearings. The range appears to trend north-north-east. A headland
about 12 miles off lay N. 18&deg; E. A range, about the same distance off,
subtended an angle of from N. 12&deg; E. to N. 10&deg; W.</p>
<p>We struck N. 18&deg; E. by the track. In 1 mile we crossed a little</p>
<blockquote>[1) Since the above was written (in 1880), a large number of
Chinese tried the ground, but were unable to make a living.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 505}</u></p>
<p>dry gully with pegs of two tents standing. This was probably ONE OF SEFTON'S
CAMPS, when he penetrated to the north during his second stay at the "Coen."
The track continued for a mile further to the north-east, when it was no longer
recognisable.</p>
<p>We continued on a course of N. 18&deg; E. In half a mile we entered, and in
1 mile more got through a scrubby thicket of grasstrees (<i>Xanthorraea</i>),
bloodwood, and teatrees, quite bare of grass. One mile more on the same course
brought us to a sandy creek of the third magnitude, with plenty of water, and
which was of more importance after the alarming desert country we had just
left&mdash;green burnt feed along the left bank. [This water-course I named
HORNE CREEK, after my former colleague Mr. (now Dr.) John Horne, of the
Geological Survey of Scotland.&mdash;R. L. J.] We camped on the left bank.
(CAMP 38: bloodwood, broad arrow over J. 14/9/79.) Mount Croll bears S. 13&deg;
W. from this camp.</p>
<p>The first part of the day's journey, that within the "valley" proper, was
very tolerable country, with good grass (recently burnt for the most part). The
trees were mostly bloodwood and box, with a few ironbarks and stringybarks.</p>
<p>The greater part of the day we followed a well-marked horse track (deeply
impressed, as if in rainy weather). In places we lost it, and in one place we
abandoned it, as it went too much east, but we were distinctly on it at the old
camp (see map). At our camp on Home Creek we found tracks of horses feeding,
and signs of prospecting in the bed of the stream. The creek at our camp had a
fair stream of running water 2 yards wide. We prospected the creek, but got no
gold, although there was much magnetic iron sand in every dish. The latitude of
Camp 38 I found to be 13&deg; 45' 47" S.</p>
<p>September 15. On leaving Camp 38 we had hard work to get away from the Home;
first in getting the horses down the steep sandy bluff on the left bank, then
in getting them up the high cliffs of "cement" on the right bank, and lastly in
clearing a deep gully cutting through the cement. The Home has large teatrees
in its bed, but no scrub.</p>
<p>Three miles from the Home, through grass tree, bloodwood timber, and scrub,
we came to a large river which I named the "PEACH," after my former colleague,
Mr. (now Dr.) Benjamin N. Peach, of the Geological Survey of Scotland. The
Peach here has a large body of water a stream of 5 yards wide and I foot deep,
running at the rate of 2 miles an hour to west-north-west. The river strongly
resembles the Morgan, near Cooktown, in its general features, with tall
dark-leaved trees, lofty palms, and gigantic fig trees with their beautiful
fluted roots, nutmeg trees, lawyer vines and canes. [The Peach has since proved
to be one of the heads of the river named the ARCHER by the Brothers Jardine in
1865.&mdash;R.L.J.]</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 506}</u></p>
<p>The bed of the river was gravelly on top, with a fine gritty sand below, to
which we could find no bottom. Anywhere in the fine sand we could get numerous,
but fine, specks of gold in every dish. I regretted exceedingly that time would
not permit of prospecting this river thoroughly, as I surmised that PAYABLE
GOLD MIGHT BE FOUND in places where it was possible to bottom.</p>
<p>We ran the river up for a quarter of a mile, and found rapids running over
granite bars. The granite had small granules of quartz, small orthoclase
felspar crystals, and tin-white mica, and hornblende. Among the bars we got a
little RUBY TIN, but no gold.</p>
<p>We followed up the right bank of the river for 2 miles east-north-east
through desert country&mdash;grasstree, quinine tree, teatree, and spinifex
grass (the latter recently burnt). At the end of the 2 miles we came on pretty
country, with bloodwood, Moreton Bay ash, and oaten-grass. On the left bank
some low granite hills came down to the river. In a mile and a half through
country of this description we crossed a deep sandy tributary [afterwards named
CHRISTMAS CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.] falling into the right bank, and continued our
course up the river. After 2 miles more across gullies and ridges (the grass
still smoking, and bush fires ahead of us, up the valley) we tried the river
again, although we could get no bottom. We found much black sand, but no gold.
The river here has a magnificent fringe of scrub and palms.</p>
<p>We then retraced our steps for 3&frac12; miles and camped in the good
country on the right bank of the (Peach) river. (CAMP 39. Latitude 13&deg; 39"
7". Trees marked: broad arrow, J. 16/9/79, and "Peach R.")</p>
<p>We obtained fine "colours" of GOLD here below granite bars in the river.</p>
<p>After we had camped, I recrossed the river and ascended the low granite
hills on the left bank. I found a wide north-and-south REEF on the top,
underlying to the west at 45 degrees. This reef is seamed with longitudinal
veins of brownstone. On crushing and washing some of this stuff we obtained a
little very fine GOLD DUST.</p>
<p>September 16. Leaving the Peach River, we struck north-west, and in 5 miles
crossed a large, deep, dry, sandy creek between high cement walls, on a granite
bottom, falling south-west [afterwards named BEETLE CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.]. We
prospected the creek, but got no gold. In 3 miles further we came to a deep dry
creek of the third magnitude. In half a mile to the north-west this creek falls
into a creek of the second magnitude, with a thin stream of water in a sandy
bed, coming from the east. I named this IRVINE CREEK [after Mr. Duncan R.
Irvine, a former colleague on the Geological Survey of Scotland, now
deceased.&mdash;R. L. J.].</p>
<p>In 2 miles more, up a gradual slope to the north-west, we reached a blunt
conical hill of granite, about 500 feet above its base,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 507}</u></p>
<p>which I ascended. This was our NORTHMOST POINT, and I named it BIRTHDAY
MOUNT, as I reached it on my birthday. From this point I took a series of
bearings. A range dimly descried to the westward I named the GEIKIE RANGE,
after the Director of the Geological Survey of Scotland [now Sir Archibald
Geikie.&mdash;R. L. J.]. The Peach River could be seen to the north-west,
making its way through a gap in this range.</p>
<p>The whole of the country traversed on this day's journey was very poor, with
scanty spmifex grass (recently burnt) and grasstree and teatree. The NATIVES
were busy burning the country between the Geikie Range and Birthday Mount.</p>
<p>Having now penetrated as far to the north as was prudent, considering the
quantity of rations remaining, we turned our faces HOMEWARD with the intention
of striking the Palmerville and Cooktown road about the bend of the Kennedy. In
2 miles S. 2&deg; W., through teatree and grasstree country, we reached IRVINE
CREEK, and camped on its right bank, where the horses had good feed among
lagoons. We prospected the creek at the camp, but found no gold. (CAMP 40:
trees marked broad arrow, J. 16/9/79, and "Irvine Creek.")</p>
<p>September 17. We found it rather difficult to get away from Irvine Creek,
which had high sandy banks fringed with scrub and a chain of lagoons on both
sides. In 2&frac12; miles S. 2&deg; W. from the creek, we came on tracks of
thirteen horses which had come and gone north and south in wet weather. In
another mile we came to the Peach River, here flowing to the north-west. We
prospected here and found no gold; but there remained in the bottom of each
dish about 2 ounces of a very fine grey sand which, on being examined
afterwards, turned out to be amber-coloured TIN ORE <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> in microscopic grains. Some very large Leichhardt trees
were seen in the scrub here.</p>
<p>In 2 miles more on the same course, we reached CROLL CREEK, running nearly
north, with a wide, shallow, bare bottom, partly of sand and partly of cement.
After crossing it, we kept for half a mile on the same course within sight of
its left bank. As we did not cross HORNE CREEK, it must have fallen into the
Peach between our upper and lower crossings of that river.</p>
<p>Eight miles further, we entered a well-grown forest of stringybark,
bloodwood and ironbark trees, on red soil, rising gently to the range on the
left.</p>
<p>In 2&frac12; miles more we crossed a low watershed and continued our course
by gullies falling to the south, with low stony ridges on which the grass had
been burned. Bush fires were raging within half a mile of our <i>route</i>. It
was now near sunset and our march</p>
<blockquote>[1) Mr. James Dick's <i>Mineral Resources of the Cook District</i>
contains (p. 27) a reference to the "Archer River Tinfield, 40 miles from the
Coen." The distance given would place the tinfield about 10 miles down the
Peach (Archer) River from where I saw tin.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 508}</u></p>
<p>had become a hurried scramble to get water before nightfall. In 3&frac12;
miles from the watershed, the hills receding to our left to form the north wall
of the valley west of the Two-Mile Diggings, we were fortunate enough to find
beautiful green feed and three little water-holes in a gully running south.
Here we camped. When night fell we could hear the sound of running water, and
it turned out that we were only half a mile from the Coen (or Kendall) [the
SOUTH COEN.&mdash;R. L. J.]. (CAMP 41: bloodwood, broad arrow, J. 17/8/79.
Latitude 13&deg; 53' 48" S.)</p>
<p>On this day's march, as far as Croll Creek, the country was a desert, of the
same description as that passed through yesterday. It slightly improved
southward and became more open, with a few bloodwood and stunted ironbark
trees. South of Croll Creek for about 2 miles, there were several unwooded
plains with tolerable grass, but with innumerable little ant-hills among the
roots of the grass. Then there was a relapse into grasstree and spinifex
desert&mdash;hardly so poor as yesterday's, however&mdash;to the beginning of
the forest.</p>
<p>After the ridgy country on the south side of the divide between the Peach
and Kendall [i.e., South Coen] waters was passed, we had about a mile of fair
open bloodwood country.</p>
<p>On the ridges north of the divide there are some outcrops of ferruginous
schist and a good deal of quartz, with one PROMISING REEF.</p>
<p>September 18. In the morning, while the horses were being rounded up and
packed, I went back to the reefs on the ridges. They run generally north and
south and are well defined, but have not much appearance of iron oxide, which
is usually characteristic of auriferous reef. The low country at the base of
the hills is of ferruginous mica-schist. The mountains are granite. I heard a
party of NATIVES chanting among the rocks.</p>
<p>On leaving Camp 41, we steered S. 6&deg; W. (true), and in half a mile came
to the Kendall [SOUTH COEN]. The river here has a bottom of fine-grained
decomposed granite. On prospecting we got fine "colours" of GOLD, much black
sand and many small garnets. On the left bank of the river was a large white
QUART? REEF with red joints and cavities filled with brownstone.</p>
<p>From the Kendall [South Coen] we struck S. 15&deg; W. (true). In the first
mile we passed three large white QUARTZ REEFS striking NW. and SE. Three miles
from the river, over rolling stony country, with ironbark, stringybark and a
few bloodwood trees, we touched some low hills of ferruginous mica-schist on
the left, almost detached from the main range. I ascended one of the hills and
had a look ahead. [LOCHINVAR PROVISIONAL GOLDFIELD must be about 4 miles WSW.
of this hill.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>We now shaped our course to the south [or so I intended and tried to do, but
the Lands Department maps show that the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 509}</u></p>
<p>remainder of the day's travelling must have been south-east.&mdash;R. L.
J.]. The first 2 miles led us over low ridges (spurs of the hills on the left)
of ferruginous mica-schist, with numerous QUARTZ REEFS. The next 3 miles were
of more rolling, white granite country, with a good many reefs. For 2 miles
more we traversed gneiss country. From the hill which I ascended there were no
creeks of any importance, but only dry gullies falling to southsouth-west. The
timber was teatree, bloodwood, and ironbark. The grass was of middling quality,
but it had mostly been burned a day or two before.</p>
<p>The next 4 miles were of soft granite <i>d&eacute;bris</i> in gently rolling
downs, undermined by ants; the grass poor; the timber bloodwood and box. The
mountains on the left recede almost out of sight.</p>
<p>For 1 mile we steered south-east (to avoid a low range to the right) over
stony ridges covered with angular quartz fragments.</p>
<p>In 1 mile further to the south&mdash;just when the march had again become a
race for water&mdash;we found a rather boggy swamp with good grass, and camped.
(CAMP 42: bloodwood, broad arrow; J. 18/9/79. Latitude 14&deg; 5' 18" S.)</p>
<p>Near our camp we passed a recently abandoned cluster of GUNYAHS, twelve or
fifteen in number, each capable of accommodating two men. They were made of
long sheets of bark placed edge to edge over two ridge-poles supported on
forks&mdash;an idea which the NATIVES probably borrowed from the diggers.</p>
<p>September 19. On taking stock of our flour in the morning, I was glad to be
able to increase slightly our daily allowance, in the belief that no great
physical difficulties lay between us and civilisation.</p>
<p>On leaving Camp 42, we steered south-south-east. Within a mile of the camp
we surprised a party of NATIVES&mdash;first, a gin with a child. The gin ran
off with a piercing howl. Another gin and a man made off in a different
direction. Then a man with a gin and a child. The man in running away left his
spear behind. Lastly, two men, who, like the rest, were too shy to be
approached. The party appeared to be travelling in groups of two and three.</p>
<p>Three miles from the camp we crossed a third-magnitude creek running south,
with water-holes in a sandy bed. [One of the heads of the HOLROYD
RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.] In 1 mile more a third-magnitude creek was passed,
running west, with a water-hole beside a granite bluff. In one mile and a half
more we passed between two swamps. [SEE MAP F.] Five miles further we crossed a
fourth-magnitude creek with a chain of deep water-holes. One mile further a
similar creek with a water-hole. [Here we probably crossed HANN'S TRACK of 1872
between his 29th and 30th camps.&mdash;R. L. J.] In 1 mile more, another
fourth-magnitude creek with deep and wide lily water-holes.</p>
<p>In half a mile more we crossed the LUKIN RIVER of Mulligan,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 510}</u></p>
<p>rather a creek of the first magnitude than a river as yet. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> The creek had many dry channels. Its bed was graced
with Leichhardt trees and teatree, but had no scrub. It had scarcely any water,
only a few shallow holes in one of the channels. We prospected a little in the
bed of the river, but got no gold.</p>
<p>A mile and a half from the Lukin we crossed a fourth-magnitude creek (a
bywash of the river), with water. In 2 miles more, across country burned only a
few hours before, we came to a little gully with water in holes in the "cement"
bottom, and green picking for the horses on its banks, and camped. (CAMP 43:
bloodwood, broad arrow, J. 19/9/79. Latitude 14&deg; 21' 11"S.) [This camp
should be about 3 miles east of EBAGOOLA POST OFFICE of the present
day.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>The blacks had neglected to burn the country passed over to-day, north of
the Lukin, but it was poor in the extreme, the grass being mainly spinifex, and
but little of that. The timber was for the most part teatree, bloodwood and
ironbark. The country was gently undulating, the subsoil being composed for the
most part of a granitic "cement." The timber rather improved southward, but the
grass did not.</p>
<p>September 20. Almost immediately after leaving Camp 43, we began to mount a
low range. At the distance of 2 miles from the camp we crossed a
third-magnitude creek with a broad, dry, sandy bed, falling to the south. [RYAN
CREEK, Hamilton Goldfield.&mdash;R. L. J.] Another mile took us up to the crown
of the range, which is about 400 feet above the level of the plains. The range
is of granite, with some unaltered greywacke. There is much quartz scattered
about, with a white and "hungry" look. Large flexible crystals of biotite are
embedded in the quartz.</p>
<p>About 15 miles to the north-west I could see a high range, apparently capped
with horizontal sandstone. [This range was visited on my second journey on 16th
December, 1879.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>For 1 mile further our course lay to the left of, but within a few yards of,
the crown of the range. This low range is composed of very coarse granite with
enormous felspar crystals and crystals of quarts up to 1 cubic inch. The
ironbarks on the ridges are large and strong. There are a few stringybarks and
stunted white gums, but no bloodwood trees. We packed some washdirt to the
nearest water from a dry gully running east, and on washing it obtained some
colours of GOLD.</p>
<p>In half a mile more we were on the top of the range [which here DIVIDES THE
PACIFIC FROM THE GULF WATERS]. The gullies behind flow to the east at first,
and then swing round to the north and north-west. Before us was a tableland
sloping gently to south-south-east.</p>
<blockquote>[1) James V. Mulligan named this river in 1875. It was not then
known to be, as it has since proved, the river named the HOLROYD by the
Brothers Jardine in 1864.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 511}</u></p>
<p>Five miles further (after having passed two gullies with waterholes, falling
to the south), we came to a third-magnitude creek running to the west.
[VIOLETVILLE Post Office is about 3 miles down this creek.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In 3&frac12; miles more we crossed a large river (the KING RIVER of
Mulligan) falling to the south-west. It has a dry sandy bed, divided into four
or five channels, with only a few shallow waterholes. There are several
anabranches or bywashes on both sides.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>On the south side of the King River we found the country much broken up into
ridges, with gullies. Two and a half miles from the King we crossed a
second-magnitude creek, running parallel with the river, with a dry, sandy
bed.</p>
<p>In 2 miles more we arrived, just before sunset, at a small water-hole in a
gully running west, and camped. Unhappily the grass had just been burned, but
we drove the horses back for about half a mile to some rather scanty burnt
feed. (CAMP 44: white gum, broad arrow, J. 20/9/79.) [Near this camp Mulligan's
track (1875) must have crossed Hann's (1872).&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>The whole of this day's travelling was very uninteresting, with the
exception of the low range between the Lukin and the King, as it presented only
a succession of low ridges and unnameable and unmapable gullies. The soil, if
it could be called soil, was of decomposed granitic cement, into which the
horses sank 2 or 3 inches at every step. The grass was poor; the timber was
mostly stringybark and ironbark, with a few bloodwoods; teatrees in the wet
bottoms.</p>
<p>September 21. We travelled 17&frac12; miles south over country very much
like that of yesterday, but on the whole rather more rolling and with fewer
ridges. We camped on a little gully trickling to the east, with a patch of
burnt feed on its left bank. Except this, we did not see a single chartable
water-course the whole day. Five miles back from the camp, we saw some cattle
tracks, and 2 miles from the camp the tracks of two horses going north. (CAMP
45: stringybark, broad arrow, J. 21/9/79. Latitude 14&deg; 48' 45" S.) [We must
have been on the divide between the head of the Coleman River and its
tributary, Dismal Creek. Hann came northward up the Coleman valley in 1872 from
his Camp 26 to Camp 27.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>September 22. We steered SE. from Camp 45, at first over rolling granite
country. In 1 mile we passed a patch of mica-schist, striking NE. and dipping
SE. at a high angle. There were seen here some PROMISING REEFS, striking north
and south, with a good deal of brownstone (decomposed pyrites) in cavities. Two
miles from the camp we crossed a dyke, two or three hundred yards wide, of
dolerite, running north and south through the schist and forming a low hill.
The improvement of the grass on the dolerite soil was</p>
<blockquote>[1) The King River is a tributary of the COLEMAN.&mdash;R. L.
J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 512}</u></p>
<p>sudden and striking. A large white reef of quartz runs through the schist on
the eastern side of the dyke. From the summit of the hill I could see HANN'S
GARNETIFEROUS MOUNTAIN to the southsouth-west.</p>
<p>Three and a half miles from Camp 45, we passed some fine water-holes in a
fourth-magnitude creek running SW. over a bottom of grey granite.</p>
<p>Five miles from the camp, we crossed the COLEMAN RIVER of Hann, here running
south-west, with a dry sandy bed divided into four or five channels. On the
left bank was an outcrop of ferruginous mica-schist and much loose quartz.</p>
<p>A mile beyond the Coleman, on the right bank of a third-magnitude creek
running SW. with plenty of water, we saw a recent NATIVE ENCAMPMENT of very
superior workmanship, with accommodation for about twenty men. The dwellings
were practically tents. Two forks, sunk in the ground, approached each other at
the upper ends like a truncated letter A, and carried two ridge-poles, over
which the roof&mdash;sheets of bark&mdash;was bent. Between the forks two
parallel logs supported sapling joists, on which sheets of bark were laid for
sleeping bunks.</p>
<p>Seven miles from the camp, we passed some enormous and fantastic blocks of
grey granite, and saw a flock of VERY LITTLE BIRDS, with bodies apparently no
larger than butterflies. I could not, however, shoot any. My impression is that
no bird so small is known in Australia. ["Kalkah Old Station," now appearing on
the maps of the Lands Department, must be near this place. It was taken up by
Dickson and Sweetland in 1884.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In 1 mile more, we crossed, first from right to left and then from left to
right bank, a fourth-magnitude creek with large water-holes. [One of the heads
of what is called the MOREHEAD RIVER, named by the Telegraph Construction
Party. We had CROSSED THE WATERSHED from the Gulf to the Pacific
waters.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In 2 miles more, we got a view of some mountains to the southeast,
apparently capped with horizontal sandstone beds. Here we entered on ridgy
country, which we cleared in 2&frac12; miles. There are a few well-defined
QUARTZ REEFS on the ridges.</p>
<p>Our course lay for the next 5 miles over flats which got poorer and poorer
as we advanced. We feared having to make a waterless and grassless camp. Just
before sunset, however, we found a swamp and some burnt feed near it, and
camped. (CAMP 46.) [A tributary of the Morehead River.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>Between the Coleman and the dividing ridge the land is pretty
fair&mdash;gently rolling downs, well watered and well grassed. The
decomposition of the granite on the spot forms a soil of much better quality
than the decomposed granite "cement" does. The prevailing trees are
stringybarks, bloodwoods, a few iron-barks</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 513}</u></p>
<p>and a few white gums. On the ridges of the divide ironbarks predominate.</p>
<p>September 23. On leaving Camp 46, we crossed, in 2&frac12; miles, to the
left bank of a chain of deep, narrow water-holes, running SSE. (a continuation
of the swampy water-course on which our last camp had been pitched). [SEE MAP
E.] The water-holes abounded in fish. From the camp to this point the land was
good, with a fair soil and fine patches of burnt grass on frequently occurring
bottoms. The trees were white gum, stringybark, box and bloodwood, with a few
ironbarks.</p>
<p>In half a mile more we crossed a second-magnitude creek with granite on its
bank and teatrees in its dry bed. Fourteen bark GUNYAHS on the left bank. [A
tributary of the MOREHEAD RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In 4&frac12; miles more, we crossed a dry river bed, with a wide sandy
channel, falling to the NE. This river is wider than the so-called "Coen" or
Kendall [i.e., the "South Coen."&mdash;R. L. J.]. In all probability it is the
same as that known as Saltwater Creek on the road to the Coen diggings. [It is
the main head of the MOREHEAD RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In a mile and a half further, we crossed a little bywash of the river, with
water-holes. In a mile and a half more, we crossed from the right to the left
bank of a third-magnitude creek running NNW. A mile further, we recrossed the
same creek, followed it up for half a mile and again crossed to the left bank,
when we found ourselves among low hills. I ascended one of these and got a good
view ahead. Three miles to the SW. was the bluff of sandstone for which we had
been steering since we crossed the divide on the previous day. Half a mile to
the north lay what seemed to be the northmost cape of the sandstone-capped
mountains. To the SE. there seemed to be low gaps in the sandstone wall and
tolerably clear country.</p>
<p>We then struck SW. (true) for half a mile across low granite country, and
camped on a little gully, with water, running to the north. (CAMP 47:
bloodwood, broad arrow, J. 23/9/79.)</p>
<p>The country traversed this day, as far as (the supposed) Saltwater Creek
[the MOREHEAD RIVER], was level and fairly grassed. Beyond that river the land
was only tolerably grassed and somewhat undulating.</p>
<p>September 24. On leaving Camp 47, we beat about to the north and north-east
for 5&frac12; miles, from cape to cape of the sandstone in the hope of rounding
the latter, as I had intended to map in the boundaries of this formation. I
found, however, that it extended further and further to the north-east, so that
I had to abandon that idea and seek a gap by which to ASCEND TO THE SANDSTONE
TABLELAND. My resolution to adopt this course was amply justified by the
difficulties in the path as well as by the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 514}</u></p>
<p>decreased interest of the geology. The valley we followed up (ESE.) came to
a head in 1 mile, and presented a wall of sandstone about a hundred feet in
height. It took us two hours to ascend this wall, the horses having to be
unpacked and led, one by one, while their loads were carried on our shoulders.
With all our care, one horse missed his footing and rolled down the slope among
the rocks. Strange to say, he was but little hurt.</p>
<p>The sandstone here is highly ferruginous&mdash;a very hard, coarse grit with
ironstone nodules and indistinct plant remains.</p>
<p>We were now on the top of what was named by Hann JESSIE'S TABLELAND. [We
were now on the top of a sandstone tableland. I was, however, in error in
applying the name of Jessie's Tableland to it, as Hann only gave that name to
an isolated sandstone table between two of the heads of the Morehead River and
east of his Camp 24.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In half a mile east-south-east (magnetic), we crossed a valley falling to
the left. After 1 mile more to east-south-east, half a mile south and half a
mile east, we camped in a bottom with long grass, and a chain of holes, with
very hard chalybeate water, falling to the south. A large NONDA TREE, loaded
with ripe fruit, overhung our tents. (CAMP 48. Latitude 15&deg; 8' 18" S.) [On
a head of DEAD HORSE CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>September 25. Leaving Camp 48, we steered south-east (true) for 8 miles,
through well-grown close timber. The country was fairly grassed and closely
timbered with very large stringybarks, ironbarks and nondas. It slopes gently
to the north-east. We crossed no creeks of any consequence, only a few green
"bottoms." The soil was reddish and sandy, as if derived from decomposed
ferruginous sandstone, but not a single stone was seen. At the end of the 8
miles was a gentle rise to the top of a ferruginous conglomerate bed, on which
the timber suddenly changed to stunted teatree and brushwood. Thence to the end
of the day's journey, the country was of the same description as that traversed
for the first 8 miles.</p>
<p>In 5 miles we crossed from the left to the right bank of a fourthmagnitude
creek, with deep water-holes. [HEALY CREEK, a tributary of the HANN
RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>Three and a half miles further, we crossed a creek of the third magnitude,
running like a mill-race to the north-east, 3 yards wide and 18 inches deep. A
cliff of very hard ferruginous sandstone overhung the left bank. I have no
doubt that this is MULLIGAN'S HANN RIVER. [The Cape York TELEGRAPH LINE now
nearly coincides with my course from Camp 48 to the Hann.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In 3&frac12; miles more (with a fire raging on the right all the way), we
crossed a fourth-magnitude creek (a tributary of the Hann), and camped on the
right bank. (CAMP 49: white gum, broad arrow, 26/9/79.) [More probablv a
tributary of THERRIMBURI</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 515}</u></p>
<p>CREEK. "Koolburra" Station, shown on the 4-mile map, should be about 6 miles
east-south-east of Camp 49. KENNEDY'S CAMP of 24th September, 1848, was
probably not far from my Camp 49.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>September 26. We steered south-east (true) from Camp 49, through flat or
gently undulating country, with light-red sandy soil, fairly grassed and with
the same timber as on the previous day. In 3&frac14; miles from the camp, we
crossed a third-magnitude creek running north, with a small stream and large
water-holes. Nine and a half miles from the camp, we crossed a slightly more
pronounced undulation, on which a few small stones (ferruginous sandstone) were
visible.</p>
<p>Nine miles further on, we caught a glimpse of mountains on the left (higher
beds of sandstone or conglomerate). In 2 miles more we passed a third-magnitude
creek running feebly to the north, with deep lily water-holes.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more, we camped on a fourth-magnitude creek, with
water-holes ponded back by ledges of horizontal sandstone. This camp was within
half a mile of the mountains seen from the last creek. This and the creek last
crossed are probably the heads of Mulligan's WARNER CREEK. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> (CAMP 50: broad arrow, J. 26/9/79.)</p>
<p>September 27. We reached the base of the range in a mile and a half from
Camp 50. The range is composed of horizontally bedded gritty sandstone, white
and yellow, with much peroxide of iron, which often segregates in concretionary
masses. At the point where we struck the sandstone range, it was penetrated by
a mass of intrusive pink felstone.</p>
<p>Three miles in a generally south-south-east direction took us through the
sandstone range (ascending about 200 and descending about 300 feet) to a pack
track (the FIRST ROAD FROM COOKTOWN TO THE PALMER) on the left bank of the
KENNEDY RIVER. We followed the track, which led east (true) for a quarter of a
mile, south-east for a quarter of a mile (by lovely reaches of blue water
between conglomerate walls), east-south-east for 2 miles, and northeast for 1
mile. Here the river goes north and the track crosses it and joins the
PALMERVILLE AND COOKTOWN DRAY TRACK on the right bank of the river. At the
crossing the Kennedy has a sandy bed, with a shallow stream running about 5
yards wide.</p>
<p>The conglomerate in the valley of the Kennedy contains pebbles of an older
conglomerate, as well as of quartzite, quartz, greywacke, slate and a few of
granite&mdash;in fact, it has all the appearance of having been derived from
the waste of the underlying auriferous rocks.</p>
<p>The point where we struck the road was the camping-place known as the
"KENNEDY BEND," 96 miles from Cooktown.</p>
<blockquote>[1) A mistake: they were heads of THERRIMBURI CREEK.&mdash;R. L.
J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 516}</u></p>
<p>The road [to Cooktown, which we followed from this point] crosses the flat
top of "Jessie's Tableland" <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> in a general
east-north-east direction to a point 45 miles from Cooktown, where it rounds
the "BATTLE CAMP RANGE." This range rises to about 200 feet above the general
level of the tableland, and is composed of greenish-grey, sometimes reddish,
sandstones. The beds are, to all appearance, part and parcel of the "Desert
Sandstone" series. Mr. Norman Taylor, who accompanied Mr. Hann's expedition as
Geologist, discovered some FOSSILS in the Battle Camp Range, which were
ascribed by Mr. Robert Etheridge, F.R.S., to the genera <i>Hinnites</i> and
<i>Ostrea</i>.</p>
<p>At Battle Camp the BLACKS made a FUTILE STAND against the intrusion of white
men on the FIRST RUSH TO THE PALMER.</p>
<p>From Battle Camp to the crossing of the NORMANBY RIVER (33 miles from
Cooktown), the road keeps a general south-south-east direction. On the left
bank of the Normanby is a mountain mass of grey granite, apparently of later
date than the sandstone.</p>
<p>About 8 miles from the Normanby, in a general south-east direction, the road
drops down the last escarpment of the "Desert Sandstone," which is seen resting
on nearly vertical shales and greywackes. Thence to COOKTOWN, the road
traverses (eastward) highly inclined beds of greywacke, slate and quartzite,
striking north-north-west.</p>
<p>From the foot of the tableland I struck across country to the COAL MINE
which had been opened [on OAKY CREEK, west of Lookout Range] by the energy of
the Cooktown Railway League, and made careful notes and measurements
underground.</p>
<p>I found that the mine had been sunk on the 8-inch seam alluded to in my two
"coal" reports, referred to at the beginning of this narrative. A vertical
shaft, 6 feet 2 inches by 2 feet 6 inches, had been sunk to a depth of 19 feet
through the bottom of the coal. Then a drive, 6 feet 9 inches long, had been
made to the dip, when the bottom of the coal had been cut. The coal was then
followed in an underlie shaft for 14 feet 6 inches. The dip of the coal-seam
averages 33 degrees, or 1 in 1&frac12;. Down the underlie it becomes rather
steeper, reaching 45 degrees in one place.</p>
<p>At the north end of the vertical shaft, the section is as follows&mdash;the
measurements being taken at right angles to the planes of bedding<b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b>:&mdash;</p>
<p>Black shale, with <i>Glossopteris</i>, from surface to roof of coal.</p>
<p>1st Coal. Good; 9 inches at upper side; 14 inches at lower side of shaft;

<p>We reached COOKTOWN on 3rd October (1879).</p>
<h4>AFTERWORD.</h4>
<p>With the exception of the excursion to the coal deposits between The
Brothers and Oaky Creek, the incidents which occurred between the "Kennedy
Bend" and Cooktown were naturally not of sufficient importance to find a place
in an official report, as we travelled mainly along well-known roads.</p>
<p>We had calculated the length of our tether with such accuracy that the last
of our load of edibles was cleared off the table before we went to sleep in our
50th camp. For more than a week we had fared sparingly, but on this occasion we
ate without scruple and without leaving a crumb, happy in the knowledge that
the early hours of the following day would see us on a public road. The start
next morning was all the earlier because there was no need to wait for
breakfast, and soon we had the beaten road beneath our feet and the telegraph
wire from Cooktown to the Palmer above</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 518}</u></p>
<p>our heads. The first man we met was a carrier named DONALD MACKENZIE, who
was driving a small mob of horses. MacKenzie afterwards took up LAKEFIELD
STATION, on what the maps call STATION CREEK, which is what HANN had already
named the WARNER RIVER. MacKenzie was subsequently MURDERED BY BLACKS in his
garden at the station.</p>
<p>About midday, we arrived at the LAURA NATIVE POLICE STATION, where MR. HUGH
FITZGERALD, Sub-Inspector, overwhelmed us with his hospitality. He remarked
that luncheon (breakfast, as far as we were concerned) was just ready to be
served up, but that if we hurried there might be time for a bath. My response
to the hint shows to what depths of unconventionality civilised man may be
reduced by a course of savage living combined with a healthy appetite. It was
to the effect that although I was ragged and dirty, I didn't mind, if he
didn't, but I was also hungry&mdash;and hunger hurt; that, in my opinion,
cleanliness would be mere foppery in the circumstances and that, with his
permission, I would eat first and wash and clothe myself afterwards. And so it
was.</p>
<p>At the LAURA TELEGRAPH STATION, I got into communication with the Mines
Department. After visiting the coal area, the party reached COOKTOWN ON 3rd,
October, 1879.</p>

<h4>(ANNOTATED REPRINT)</h4>
<h5>SECOND EXPEDITION</h5>
<p>On the 15th October, 1879, I received a telegram from the Under-Secretary
for Mines as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Minister for Mines wishes you to hold yourself in
readiness to accompany party starting from Thornborough to prospect York
Peninsula."</blockquote>
<p>To my inquiries regarding the <i>route</i> to be followed and the time of
starting, I received the following reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Brisbane, 17th October, 1879.<br>
<br>
"The prospecting party will start from Cooktown in about a month. Not earlier.
Will prospect in direction and beyond locality lately visited by you. Will be
fitted out for six months."</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 520}</u></p>
<p>On 22nd October, 1879, tne Under-Secretary for Mines telegraphed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Prospecting party in course of formation to start
from Cooktown within month will consist of four white mea, experienced
prospectors, who will be fitted out for six months' trip and will prospect for
four months in localities north indicated by you as most probably auriferous.
If unsuccessful up to that time, will then be allowed to prospect where they
may fancy. Be preparing what you require as outfit and advise this office when
ready."</blockquote>
<p>I reached COOKTOWN on 13th November, and the following instructions arrived
by the same steamer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Department of Mines, Brisbane, 7th November,
1879.<br>
<br>
"<i>In re Prospecting York Peninsula.</i><br>
<br>
"SIR,<br>
<br>
"The prospecting party will be under your direction so far as relates to the
localities that are to be prospected during a period of four months. At the
expiration of that time, if the prospectors do not approve of the directions of
Mr. Jack, they are to be at liberty to proceed by themselves; Mr. Jack and men
to proceed with his geological exploration so long as his supplies, and other
considerations, will permit.<br>
<br>
"JAMES CROSBIE will be the leader of the gold-prospecting party, consisting of
himself, Leeland [LAYLAND], HUME and HAMIL; and, in the event of any difference
of opinion as to their course of proceedings, the instructions of Crosbie are
to be followed <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> by the other three. Crosbie
will keep a diary of proceedings, making an entry therein daily. In the event
of the prospectors parting company with you and your men at the end of the four
months, you will hand over such rations and other necessaries as you can
conveniently spare from your supplies to Crosbie and party, so as to enable
them to remain out prospecting as long as possible.<br>
<br>
"The whole party will supply themselves with rations, &amp;c., for a six
months' trip.<br>
<br>
"Everything supplied by the Government to Crosbie and party, Crosbie as leader
will be held responsible for, and it is to be returned, or satisfactorily
accounted for, to the Police Magistrate or Warden of the district where the
party is broken up.<br>
<br>
"The primary object of the expedition is to discover on the Peninsula an
alluvial goldfield, to which object you will specially devote your knowledge,
at the same time taking every opportunity to make a general geological survey
of the country passed over, without in any way delaying the party in its main
purpose that of prospecting for gold. The time of the party must not be
expended in searching for quartz reefs, although notes should be made of any
auriferous reefs accidentally discovered. The prospecting party, consisting of
Crosbie, Leeland, Hume and Hamil, will be each equally entitled to retain all
gold found by them, the usual reward claims, and any reward payable for gold
discoveries, provided that they each use their best endeavours to secure a
successful issue to the expedition.<br>
<br>
"I have, &amp;c.,<br>
"GEO. L. LUKIN,<br>
"Under-Secretary for Mines.<br>
<br>
"R. L. JACK, ESQUIRE,<br>
"Govt. Geologist,<br>
"Cooktown."</blockquote>
<blockquote>[1) The prospecting party had misread this passage, and till four
months later, when we happened to compare our copies of the instructions, were
under the impression that in case of difference of opinion the instructions of
their leader were to be "foreclosed" by the other three. It is satisfactory to
be able to say that they worked harmoniously together in spite of this
misunderstanding. In my copy, but not in that supplied to the prospectors, the
word "followed" was plain. The prospectors' reading of the word appealed to my
sense of humour. They thought "foreclosed" was "a funny word"; but concluded
that it was official language signifying that their leader's instructions might
be "overruled" or "disregarded" by the majority.&mdash;R. L. J.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 521}</u></p>
<p>The prospectors objected to these instructions, that they appeared to give
me too much power over their movements, and imagined that I might obstinately
keep them prospecting for months in a locality which they might not think good
enough. To their remonstrance they received, by telegraph, the following
reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Brisbane, 18-11-79.<br>
<br>
<p>"Your telegram 14th. Prospectors are not under control of geologist and
leader not subordinate to him. Read instructions again. You have separate
outfit and are entirely independent of Mr. Jack. Mr. Jack takes the opportunity
of party going out to accompany it for the purpose of making geological notes
of the country travelled over and to render any assistance in his power to the
party, but is instructed to make his geological surveys subordinate to the main
object of the expedition, that is the discovery of alluvial goldfield. The only
authority he has over the prospectors is that he shall direct what country
shall be prospected fof the first four months. Consult Mr. Jack and you will
find all matters can be satisfactorily arranged between you.<br>
<br>
"GEO. L. LUKIN."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A copy of the above telegram was sent to me, and I replied on the same
date:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Quite ready for my part to carry out instructions
of 7th instant which fair, reasonable and workable."</blockquote>
<p>On talking the matter over with the prospecting party, we were mutually
satisfied with the arrangement made in the UnderSecretary's last
telegram&mdash;that the localities to be prospected were to be indicated by me
for the first four months, and that the prospectors were to be the sole judges
of how much time should be spent on each. I had no doubt that the prospectors
and myself would agree on the latter point.</p>
<p>When the first intimation of the proposed expedition reached me, I felt it
my duty to represent to you the necessity for a small escort of native
police.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Recent experience leads me to suggest that an
OFFICER OF NATIVE POLICE, with a few troopers, SHOULD ACCOMPANY THE PARTY for
the double purpose of protecting the horses and taking charge of the relations
of the blacks and whites. This would prevent, I believe, the difficulties
likely to arise should the prospectors be compelled to take the law into their
own hands. It would add nothing to the cost of the expedition, as the outfit of
the troopers has already been provided for, and their rations and pay run on
equally whether they are employed in active service or not."</blockquote>
<p>The suggestion was not complied with. [The refusal was conveyed by the
Under-Secretary in decorous official phraseology to which no exception could be
taken. Many years later I learned that the Minister's instructions were to
"tell Mr. Jack that he can find his own black boys if he is afraid to go
without them." The following narrative furnishes abundant evidence that my
suggestion was a reasonable one, and that its adoption would have saved much
trouble. It was, in fact, acted upon by succeeding ministers, who were always
ready to provide police escort for telegraph parties,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 522}</u></p>
<p>surveyors, missionaries, or other travellers who had a reasonable claim. As
my request was refused, I hold myself free of responsibility for what happened
when we were forced to take the law into our own hands.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>My party consisted of JOSEPH J. MACDONALD, JAMES S. LOVE, and CHARLIE, a
Townsville black.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">[Of my party and that of the prospectors, James
Simpson Love and the writer are believed to be the sole survivors. There is
some doubt in the case of Charlie, who was seen in Townsville about 1910, and
whose rumoured death a few years later I have not been able to
authenticate.<br>
<br>
JAMES SIMPSON LOVE, my stepson, was the youngest member of the party. Born in
1863 at Fintry, Stirlingshire, he was left at school when I married his widowed
mother in 1877 and left Scotland for Queensland. An inherited and (as it
appeared to me) almost "uncanny" leaning towards horses led him to follow us to
Queensland in 1879. One of the portraits herewith was taken in 1878. When he
arrived the start of the "second" expedition was imminent, and with a strength
of will which has ever since stood him in good stead, he insisted on joining it
in spite of all opposition, including my own, for I was of opinion that he was
too young for the hardships to be confronted. He proved himself, however,
highly adaptable, and it soon became obvious that the new life was exactly
suited to his bent. During the trip he learned much from the admirable Crosbie,
whose character and attainments endeared him to the whole party. After the
expedition, he drifted into pastoral pursuits through the usual channel of
station life, specialising, later on, in the breeding of horses, mainly of the
type of "Waler" suitable for Indian army remounts. The second portrait herewith
was taken in 1911.<br>
<br>
JAMES CROSBIE was born in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1851. While still a boy,
he joined an elder brother, a sharebroker in Ballarat, Victoria, and engaged in
mining. After a time he migrated to Queensland and took up mining on the
Hodgkinson, and in 1879 ne was selected as the leader of the prospecting party
which I led through the Cape York Peninsula on my "second" expedition. On that
occasion he was admired by all, not only for his cheerful and kindly nature,
but also for his accomplishments. He had cultivated the art, or gift, of
bushmanship until he was the equal of any black tracker. On the faintest
indication of the direction in which his objective lay he would find it in
spite of the absence of landmarks, without the aid of compass or sextant, be
the distance ever so great or the timber ever so thick. On the</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 523}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">march or in camp his resourcefulness was equal to
any occasion. Nothing came amiss to him, from horse-shoeing to the building of
boats or bridges.<br>
<br>
After the expedition, he managed the "Explorer" and other mines on the
Hodgkinson Goldfield.<br>
<br>
In 1892, an old associate, ROBERT SEFTON, one of the prospectors of the COEN,
who had afterwards made a success in the MALAY PENINSULA, induced him to
migrate to the latter field. For a short time he managed a gold mine in the
Peninsula, and represented various Queensland syndicates carrying on business
there and in the Celebes, but the breakdown of his health forced him to return
to Queensland, where he managed the "MOUNT LEYSHON" Gold Mine until his death
on 7th December, 1894. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that during his brief
connection with this mine, he succeeded, in spite of his hopeless illness, by
ingenious devices of his own invention, in reducing mining costs to such an
extent that ore of the grade of 4 dwt. to the ton became payable.<br>
<br>
The photograph herewith was taken in 1891.<br>
<br>
JOHN LAYLAND was a miner on the Hodgkinson when the call came, and was also an
unusually skilful blacksmith. Inclined to be taciturn, he was nevertheless
capable of flashes of caustic wit. He proved indefatigable on the journey and
could be relied on in any emergency or difficulty. After we broke up, he
managed a mine on the LOWER HODGKINSON for some time, and on the outbreak of
the WEST AUSTRALIAN GOLD RUSH he made several journeys overland from Queensland
to the West, where he engaged in prospecting for gold. He was eventually
MURDERED BY THE BLACKS.]</blockquote>
<p>We reached COOKTOWN on 13th November, 1879, and a week was spent in
completing our outfit. Having made arrangements for our stores to be sent by
boat up the ENDEAVOUR RIVER to Barrett's Landing, we camped in Webb's Paddock,
on the left bank of the Endeavour River, 13 miles from Cooktown.</p>
<p>On the 26th November we left Webb's Paddock, and followed the Escort track
(on the north side of CUNNINGHAM'S RANGE) for 8 miles. [SEE MAP E.] The
prospectors had a serious mishap on starting: a pack-saddle being broken, and
Crosbie's "spare" pair of boots lost. One of their pack-horses (a mare) gave a
deal of trouble. Crosbie and Layland had to camp with it, and did not overtake
the rest of the party till the following morning.</p>
<p>November 27. We continued our journey, the Escort track joining the main
Palmer ville Road at the foot of the tableland referred to in the foregoing
report. After 16 miles of travelling, we camped on the left bank of the NORMAN
BY.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 524}</u></p>
<p>November 28. Travelled (22 miles) from the Normanby to the WELCOME
WATER-HOLES. On the way I tried once more to discover the f ossilif erous
locality in the BATTLE CAMP Tableland, with much toil but no success. I climbed
up five separate gullies, one of them being that which was indicated to me by
Mr. A. C. Macmillan&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, the first beyond Battle Camp.</p>
<p>November 29. Welcome Water-holes to LAURA TELEGRAPH STATION (13 miles). The
30th being Sunday, we spelled the horses and wrote letters. Here we got two
kangaroo dogs, one from the native police and one from Mr. H. R. Jones.</p>
<p>December 1. Travelled from the Laura Telegraph Station <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> to a gully 2 miles east of CARTER'S GRAVE (18 miles).
There had been rain here lately and the grass was lovely.</p>
<p>December 2. Came on to the KENNEDY BEND (9 miles) and camped on the left
bank of the river. (Latitude, by observation of Canopus, 15&deg; 34' S.)</p>
<p>December 3. We LEFT THE PALMERVILLE ROAD in the morning and travelled up the
left bank of the river, by an old road, till we had reached the south end of
the sandstone range, about 2 miles south of our return track of the previous
trip (SW. 1 mile, WNW. 2 miles, NW. &frac14; mile, W. &frac14; mile, to the
point where we struck the old road on the previous trip, and 2 miles S. 10&deg;
W. to the end of the range). My intention was that the party should strike the
Peach River at or below the Geikie Range, a course which would take us through
new country to the west of my old track and give us an additional chance of
success, should the Geikie Range prove auriferous.</p>
<p>In 6 miles NW. (true) we crossed a creek of the fourth magnitude, with a
chain of lily-covered water-holes. This, I have no doubt, is the same chain of
"lily water-holes" which we passed 2 miles NW. of Camp 50 on our last homeward
<i>route</i>. [" THERRIMBURI CREEK," of the modern 4-mile map.&mdash;R. L.
J.]</p>
<p>From the lily water-holes we held our course W. 30&deg; N. (true) for 10
miles, and saw no more water till we found some in holes in a narrow bottom
which we had followed down for 2 miles. We camped on the left bank. The night
was too cloudy for observations (CAMP 1). [This appears to have been WANGOW
CREEK, one of the heads of the HANN RIVER. The camp was probably in the
vicinity of KENNEDY'S CAMP of 23rd September, 1848.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>The country traversed this day was soft and sandy and very gently
undulating. The sand was for the most part white, being derived from the
decomposition of white sandstone.</p>
<p>December 4. In half a mile down the hollow on which we had camped, we came
to a deep (but not running) creek of the third magnitude falling to the north,
doubtless the same that we had</p>
<blockquote>[1) There is now a railway from Cooktown to the Laura.&mdash;R. L.
J.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 525}</u></p>
<p>camped beside on 25th September. [This appears, from the 4-mile map, to have
been a branch, or anabranch, of WASJGOW CREEK, and not the creek on which we
camped on 25th September (Camp 49).&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>Three miles further, through rather close brush, we crossed a deep and
narrow sandy creek of the third magnitude running strongly to NE. Three and a
half miles further, a somewhat larger creek was passed. It was running very
strongly, with sandstone ledges, and long, canal-like reaches, and was
difficult to cross.</p>
<p>The last two creeks were so obviously of the same character as MULLIGAN'S
HANK RIVER that I had no doubt of their identity. The river had bifurcated
between the present and the former crossing. (See 25th September, 1879.)</p>
<p>In 7 miles more we camped on a marshy bottom. (CAMP 2: Moreton Bay ash, J.
4D. 79.)</p>
<p>The country traversed to-day was more undulating than that of yesterday, or
than the corresponding stage last trip. It was also, on the whole, less sandy
than yesterday's stage, and a few stones were seen in the soil. The soil was
derived from the decomposition of a red ferruginous sandstone.</p>
<p>December 5. We had hardly started when we got into broken, stony, sandstone
ridges, having a total ascent of about 500 feet (reddish ferruginous sandstone)
intersected by deep gullies. In 5 miles we reached the edge of Jessie's
Tableland <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and had a view ahead on our course.
We could make out some low hills, with a few pinnacles, apparently about the
Coleman.</p>
<p>We found it very puzzling to get down off the tableland, for although we
circled round for some distance, we always found a cliff below us. We hit on a
place at last where we could get down, by leading the horses one by one.</p>
<p>The sandstone rests on granite, large boulders of which dot the valleys like
gigantic ant-hills.</p>
<p>On descending from the tableland we found ourselves in the valley of one of
the heads of Saltwater Creek. [This was an erroneous surmise. The creek is one
of the heads of the MOREHEAD RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.] Our course lay down the
valley for a mile and a half to the NW. (true), and then over level granite
country for 7 miles more to a second-magnitude creek, with two dry channels,
falling to the north (the principal head of Saltwater Creek). [One of the heads
of the MOREHEAD.&mdash;R. L. J.] After much search a little water was found in
a hole, which was deepened and made to serve for the men and horses. (CAMP 3:
poplar gum, J. 5D 79. Latitude, by observation of Canopus, 15&deg; 13' S.)</p>
<p>In the valley below the tableland we passed the bower of a</p>
<blockquote>[1) I had erroneously applied to the whole of the sandstone
tableland the name which Hann had given to a small isolated table east of his
Camp 24.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 526}</u></p>
<p>"bower-bird"&mdash;a rough arcade of hay 2 feet in length and 1 foot high
(almost meeting at the top), with pebbles from the conglomerate, land-shells
and fragments of bleached bone strewn over the bottom of the bower and on the
ground at its two entrances.</p>
<p>December 6. Last night a NATIVE'S TRACK was seen in the bed of the creek. He
had come as far as our water-hole and turned back down the creek.</p>
<p>In the morning four of our horses were missing. They had travelled some
distance, and our start was delayed in consequence. Water-holes were seen in
the creek about a mile below the camp. We found the creek flanked on the left
bank by two bywashes, with water-holes in "cement."</p>
<p>In a mile and a half we crossed a second or third-magnitude creek (another
branch of Saltwater Creek) [really one of the heads of the MOREHEAD
RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.], falling to the NE. Its bed was dry, but a bywash on the
left bank had water-holes in "cement." On the left bank were teatree brush,
pandanus, and grasstree.</p>
<p>Four and a half miles further, a dry third-magnitude creek was crossed,
falling to the north-east [the main head of the MOREHEAD RIVER.&mdash;R. L.
J.]. [SEE MAP F.]</p>
<p>The next stage, of 4&frac12; miles, was well grassed, and well watered by
numerous unnameable and unchartable gullies.</p>
<p>From the tableland to this point the whole of the country had a granite
bottom. Here the granite gave place to mica-schist, gneiss and quartzite, with
a NW. and SE. strike. A good deal of quartz lay scattered about. The change was
marked by the beginning of a tract of low, broken country, not deserving the
name of a range, although it forms the DIVIDE OF THE CAPE YORK PENINSULA. The
ascent amounts to about 300 feet, the summit level being considerably lower
than the sandstone tableland.</p>
<p>Eight miles through this ridgy country (the first three to W. 15&deg; N. and
the last five to W. 30&deg; N., true) brought us to the left bank of a
third-magnitude creek, with water-holes, where we camped. (CAMP 4. Latitude, by
observation of Achernar, 15&deg; 4' S.) [CROSBIE CREEK.]</p>
<p>December 7 (Sunday). Spelling. A short, but heavy, thunderstorm before dawn.
Frightfully warm day. More rain at night.</p>
<p>December 8. A grey HORSE of Crosbie's had got a kick from some of the others
and was UNABLE TO WALK. We agreed to camp for a day or two and give him a
chance, while we prospected the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>December 9. The horse was still unfit to travel. To-day and yesterday a good
deal of PROSPECTING was done in the creek and gullies, but NO GOLD was
obtained. With Macdonald, I followed the creek down for some miles, but saw
nothing of the Coleman, although this creek must be a tributary of the latter.
I named it</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 527}</u></p>
<p>CROSBIE CREEK. [It has since proved to be a tributary of the PHILP RIVER, a
tributary of the Alice, which falls into the Mitchell.]</p>
<p>December 10. We left Camp 4, the lame horse having now somewhat
recovered.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half the schist and gneiss country came to an end, and
granite began. Half a mile further a third-magnitude creek was crossed, running
north-west, with water-holes in granite. We traversed granite country, gently
undulating, for the next 51 miles, when we mounted some ridges of schist and
bluish quartzite. From these ridges a view of the ranges to NW. and NNW. was
obtained. In 5 miles more we reached the COLEMAN RIVER, whose valley had been
parallel to our course (NW.) for the last 2 miles. The bed of the Coleman was
dry, but we found water in lagoons on the left bank, and camped. On the right
bank were ridges of slate, striking NW. (CAMP 5: bloodwood, J. loD. 79.
Latitude, by observation of Achernar, 14&deg;.) [The Coleman River was named by
William Hann on 27th August, 1872, and was further explored by J. V. Mulligan
in 1875.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>December 11. We struck due north from the Coleman. After 3 miles through
level country we crossed some low, grassy ridges of porphyry, timbered with
bloodwood, and shortly afterwards passed a dry second- or third-magnitude
creek, falling to the south-west (towards Dismal Creek). The prospectors tried
this creek, but found NO GOLD. Ferruginous gneiss, greywacke and quartzite (the
latter granular, evidently a not much altered sandstone) were the prevailing
rocks. [Here we must have crossed MULLIGAN'S TRACK of 1875, near his Camp
70.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In 2 miles more, among ridges of schist and slate, striking north and south,
with coincident QUARTZ REEFS, we passed a pinnacle of siliceous greywacke on
our right. The greywacke was traversed by numerous and large north-and-south
REEFS, generally bluishwhite and vitreous. From the reefs I carried away a
quantity of brown ironstone, but on being crushed and washed it yielded NO
GOLD.</p>
<p>The next 3 miles were in ridges of greywacke, slate and quartzites, with
many iron-stained QUARTZ REEFS, which I should have liked to spend some time
among, as they appeared like auriferous reefs.</p>
<p>For 3 miles more we traversed rolling downs of slate, weathering yellow.
Here our course was changed to north-west.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half (rolling downs of slate and greywacke, striking
north-west) we crossed the confluence of two dry creeks of the third magnitude,
falling south-west [DISMAL CREEK]. Our course was here altered to NNW., and in
31 miles (slate and greywacke) we found a little water in a fourth-magnitude
creek falling to the south-west, and camped. (CAMP 6. Cloudy; no
observation.)</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 528}</u></p>
<p>December 12. We held N. 20&deg; W. for a mile and a half, and N. 15&deg; W.
for 3 miles, over rolling downs (ironbark) to a dry fourth-magnitude creek,
which we crossed, left to right bank. We then ran down the right bank of the
creek for 1 mile on the same course, when the creek struck out to the
north-west, and we continued our course (N. 15&deg; W.). An outcrop of
ferruginous micaschist was seen where we left the creek. In half a mile more we
crossed the KING RIVER. It had a large, dry, sandy bed, with several channels,
almost choked up with teatrees. [The KING RIVER, named by Mulligan, 5th
September, 1875, is a tributary of the COLEMAN.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>I ascended a porphyry hill on the right bank and had an extensive view.
There is a range of very high mountains down the valley to the west.</p>
<p>We continued for a mile and a half N. 15&deg; W. over ridges of ferruginous
mica-schist, with low summits of porphyry on the right. For another mile and a
half, on the same course, we kept the crown of a low ridge of ferruginous
mica-schist containing long felspar crystals. A high range lay parallel to our
course about a mile to the right, and a still higher (rocky, apparently
porphyry) 2 miles to the left.</p>
<p>In 1 mile more we camped on the left bank of a fourthmagnitude creek,
falling to WSW. with a little water and good grass. (CAMP 7: gum, J. 12D. 79.
Latitude, by observation of Achernar and Canopus, 14&deg; 34' S.)</p>
<p>December 13. We struck N. 35&deg; W. from Camp 7. In threequarters of a mile
we crossed a fourth-magnitude creek and began to ascend to a high granite
tableland. In a mile and a half on the tableland, where a few QUARTZ REEFS were
observed, we crossed a small boss of dolerite or basalt, on which the sudden
improvement of the grass was very marked. [This is on the southern boundaryline
of the present HAMILTON GOLDFIELD.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In 1 mile further we crossed a fourth-magnitude creek falling to the south,
and observed slates and greywackes on its right bank, striking north-west. The
creek which we left in the morning, and all the others crossed up to this
point, unite to form a tributary of the KING. In 1 mile, zigzagging to the
north-west, we passed through a gap (porphyry) in the divide between the King
and Lukin Rivers.</p>
<p>For 3 miles we descended gently a wide, grassy valley to N. 10&deg; W. with
high ranges of porphyry on the left, and a lower range on the right, and
crossed a creek falling into the left bank of the main creek in the valley. For
a mile and a half N. 6&deg; E. we kept the left bank of the creek, which had a
very winding course, and was fringed with scrub. We found water in the creek
here and camped. (CAMP 8: bloodwood, J. 13D. 79. Latitude, by observation of
Achernar, 14&deg; 28' S.) I named this creek after</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 529}</u></p>
<p>Macdonald. [MULLIGAN'S ROUTE (1875) from his Camp 71 to Camp 74 was about 3
miles east of mine, and he came down to the Lukin River by a branch of
Macdonald Creek.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>December 14. We did not move camp to-day, as the prospectors wished to
examine the country, which they did, but without success. I ascended the range
forming the left wall of the valley; quartzite and greywacke, with intrusive
porphyry, predominate on the hills, while slates and mica-schists occupy the
valley. The right wall of the valley is also composed for the most part of
slates and mica-schists.</p>
<p>December 15. We continued our journey due north down the MACDONALD VALLEY to
its junction with the Lukin [HOLROYD] River (7 miles). The Macdonald has
extensive alluvial flats, with beautiful grass. There are large and numerous
water-holes from our Camp 8 downwards. The soil is reddish, from the
decomposition of ferruginous mica-schist. The Macdonald valley would make a
fine cattle run, as there is fine "country" (in a grazier's sense of the word)
from the source to the mouth of the creek, as well as in several parallel
valleys. [The modern TARA VALE station is about midway between our Camp 8 and
the Holroyd.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>At the mouth of the Macdonald the Lukin [HOLROYD] falls to west-south-west.
We only saw one small water-hole in a wide sandy bed overgrown with teatrees,
and divided into four or five channels.</p>
<p>On crossing the Lukin [HOLROYD], two GINS were surprised. One made her
escape, but the other took to a tree, which she ascended or descended with
astonishing agility, with her hands and the soles of her feet only, as her
fears increased or diminished. She was very suspicious, and apparently very
indignant. She scolded us violently and pointed in the direction in which her
companion had fled, at the same time squeezing her breasts as if to indicate
that she was or might be a mother. She had curly hair, and a front tooth
knocked out. The want of a tooth is said to be a characteristic of the coast
tribes in the north. She had no clothing, but left a dilly-bag with a few roots
at the foot of the tree, together with a long climbing-vine and a tomahawk made
from a pick cut through at the thickest part and hefted with a cleft stick.</p>
<p>[The LUKIN RIVER was so named by Mulligan, 8th September, 1875. It is,
however, the river named the HOLROYD by the Jardine Brothers in 1864, and this
name should be restored to it.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>From the Lukin [HOLROYD] we kept due north for 6 miles, the last three with
hills appearing occasionally on the left. The country was generally flat, with
stringybark and bloodwood. Occasionally we crossed teatree flats with
"graveyard" ant-hills. We crossed two gullies with water. At the last of these
we camped, as a thunderstorm was impending. (CAMP 9. Latitude, by observation
of Achernar, 14&deg; 13' 30" S.)</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 530}</u></p>
<p>December 16. Some of the prospectors' horses having strayed, my party went
on ahead. We steered due north for 3 miles, and north-north-east for 2 miles,
till we reached some ridges from which the sandstone-capped mountains to the
west could be distinctly seen. I wished to visit the sandstone range, to see if
there was any likely country behind it, and waited some time for the
prospectors to come up, having heard Crosbie's stockwhip 2 miles back. They did
not, however, appear, and I moved on, confident that they would follow our
tracks. It turned out otherwise, as they lost the track on the stony ridges
where we changed our course. They kept on the same course, believing that we
would make for it to rejoin them.</p>
<p>Three miles due west brought us to the nearest point of the SANDSTONE HILLS.
They turned out much lower than I anticipated only 200 feet or so above the
level of the plain. Only a thickness of about 50 feet of sandstone was seen.
The sandstone was ferruginous and very hard. It contained little pebbles of
quartz and large ones of slate and quartzite. It appeared to be partly composed
of fine volcanic dust.</p>
<p>A granite mountain, higher than the sandstone range, extended from near our
Camp 9 to the Lukin [Holroyd] River.</p>
<p>From the sandstone range I got a fine view to the north and north-east, but
was unable to see the country to the west.</p>
<p>On descending from the sandstone tableland we struck magnetic north (N.
6&deg; E., true). [SEE MAP C.] In 6 miles [about what is now the northern
boundary of the HAMILTON GOLDFIELD. R. L. J.], we obtained from a low ridge a
good view of the ranges at the Coen diggings. It was getting time to look for a
camp, but water (which had been plentiful up to this point) was not to be had.
We followed a gully from its head for 8 miles down its windings&mdash;say 5
miles&mdash;to the north when we got a little water in a tributary gully. It
was a miserable supply&mdash;a clay puddle swarming with tadpoles and
frog-spawn. It took a good deal of straining through calico to make it fit for
the tea-billy. We named the creek we had followed down TADPOLE CREEK. (CAMP
10.) [LOCHINVAR, the centre of the PROVISIONAL GOLDFIELD of that name, is now
about a mile below our Camp 10.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>The country traversed to-day was all granite, gently undulating, with
siringybark and bloodwood timber, and a few poplar-gums. Occasional "graveyard
flats" studded with meridional ant-hills.</p>
<p>December 17. Charlie having heard the bells of the prospectors' horses last
night, led the party in the direction from which the sound had reached his
quick ears. In one mile east-north-east he came on the prospectors' tracks at
the crossing of a thirdmagnitude creek. We followed the track due north, and in
2 miles arrived at the prospectors' last night's camp on the right bank of the
same creek. In 4 miles north we reached the Coen [i.e., the SOUTH</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 531}</u></p>
<p>COEN], where we found the prospectors camped, and camped beside them on the
right bank. (CAMP n. Cloudy; no observation.)</p>
<p>To-day's stage was all gently rolling country, with ironbarks and
stringybarks.</p>
<p>A sharp thunderstorm and rain at nightfall.</p>
<p>December 18. Accompanied by Macdonald, I crossed the [SOUTH] COEN, which at
our camp ran west-north-west, and struck west. In 2 miles the river again came
round to the line of our course, received a third- or fourth-magnitude creek,
and again flowed to west-north-west.</p>
<p>For 5 miles more, due west, we travelled over nearly level country, when we
struck TADPOLE CREEK, here a large third-, or almost second-magnitude creek. We
followed it up for 5 miles, mainly to the south-east, but winding at times to
the east and even north-east. It had a wide, flat, sandy bed in two or three
channels, crossed at long intervals by bars of granite. We tried the creek in
several places, but got not even "the colour" of gold.</p>
<p>We struck back N. 28&deg; E., and in 3 miles crossed our morning's track in
the gully, 2 miles from Camp 11. We crossed the [SOUTH] COEN at the mouth of
the gully, and got fine "colours" in the bed of the river. Between Tadpole
Creek and the [SOUTH ] COEN we saw many QUARTZ REEFS, but they were white and
unstained by iron oxide, and altogether of an unpromising appearance.</p>
<p>December 19. We left the camp on the [SOUTH] COEN RIVER, Crosbie leaving the
lame horse behind. In 4 miles N. 30&deg; W. we came to a creek of the fourth
magnitude falling west-south-west, with water on a granite bed. We washed three
dishes of stuff here and got "colours" of gold in each. The creek was joined a
little lower down by a similar creek coming from north-north-east.</p>
<p>Three miles N. 30&deg; W., through grass-tree country sloping gently to the
left of our course. Granite with much quartz, some of it iron-stained.</p>
<p>For 2 miles we gradually ascended to the north-west, over well-grassed
ridges of granite with much iron-stained quartz. Hills were seen to right and
left. We prospected in gullies among the ridges, but got no colours.</p>
<p>For 6 miles more, W. 40&deg; N., we traversed gently undulating,
well-grassed country with reddish soil, when we came to a rise showing for the
first time an outcrop of brown and yellow sandstone. [Ascending the Geikie
Range.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In 6 miles more on the same course, across rough, stony, barren sandstone
ridges with sharp gullies and scrubby brushwood, we camped at nightfall on a
gully [a tributary of the Archer River.&mdash;R. L. J.] falling to the north.
(CAMP 12.)</p>
<p>There was a smart thunder-shower while we were travelling through the
well-grassed low country.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 532}</u></p>
<p>December 20. After we had travelled downhill for 3 miles to the north,
granite was seen in a gully. Thence the country rose slightly, and we crossed 5
miles more of sandstone country. Here we entered on rough sandstone ranges. As
the sandstone appeared to extend for many miles to the north and west, we
changed our course to due east.</p>
<p>In 2 miles, mainly downhill, we reached the edge of the sandstone country
and emerged on the underlying granite, which was very coarsely crystalline,
with orthoclase crystals 2 inches in length.</p>
<p>After 1 mile more to the east, we struck east-north-east, and continued for
4 miles, mostly down the left bank of a fourthmagnitude creek, over granite
country with fine green grass and large picturesque boulders, to the PEACH
RIVER, and camped on the left bank.</p>
<p>The river here differs thoroughly in character from what we saw higher up on
the previous journey. It has a diffuse bed with about a dozen channels divided
by teatree ridges. One large stream was flowing freely, only fordable at long
intervals. The bed of the river was plentifully strewn with granite boulders,
and showed bars of the same rock. (CAMP 13: white gum, "Peach, J. XXD. 79."
Latitude, by observation of Achernar, 13&deg; 33' 30" S.)</p>
<p>December 21. Some TORRES STRAIT PIGEONS were seen to-day for the first
time.</p>

<h5>ANNOTATED REPRINT</h5>
<p>DECEMBER 22. In the morning I went to an eminence ("VIEW HILL") <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> on the right bank of the river, 1 mile from Camp 13.
(Quartzite on top striking northnorth-east, ferruginous mica-schist on slopes
and coarse granite at base.) [SEE MAP C.] After Charlie had cleared the</p>
<blockquote>[1) A number of heights are marked "View Hill" on the maps
herewith. These are places from which observations were made or bearings were
taken, and are not necessarily hills of any importance. "View Hill" is not a
proper name.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 534}</u></p>
<p>timber from the hill-top, I made an extensive series of compass
observations. The PEACH [ARCHER] RIVER could be seen for about 15 miles below
the camp, making its way through a gap in the sandstones of the GEIKIE RANGE.
The sandstones of the Geikie Range were seen extending to the north-east and
north. Birthday Mount lay S. 40&deg; E., about 12 miles off. [An
under-estimate; the distance is about 16 miles.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>Macdonald got "colours" [of GOLD] in the bed of the river near the camp,
while the prospectors got "colours" among the slate bars in the river above
View Hill.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I went out with Crosbie and Macdonald. We crossed (in half
a mile) to a creek or river which joins the Peach below the camp, and which we
afterwards named ATTACK CREEK. [See 5th January, 1880.&mdash;R. L. J.] This
creek is nearly as large as the Peach, with a channel equally wide, and with
very high flood marks. It carries a running stream about half the volume of
that of the Peach. In the bed of the creek opposite View Hill (at the junction
of granite with gneiss and bluish micaceous greywacke, striking north and
south), a few fine "colours" [of GOLD] were obtained.</p>
<p>About a mile higher up the creek (to the east), the country changed to
ferruginous mica-schist, slate and greywacke, striking north-east and dipping
generally to the north-west.</p>
<p>We next visited a hill which bore E. 43&deg; S. from View Hill. It was
composed of quartzite, the intervening ground being mostly of slate or schist,
weathering red and yellow.</p>
<p>December 23. Leaving Camp 13 we kept up the left bank of the PEACH RIVER for
2 miles on a south-east course, and crossed to the right bank. (Ferruginous
mica-schist, slate and greywacke.) At the crossing were ENORMOUS HEAPS OF
MUSSEL-SHELLS accumulated by the natives. We then kept the right bank of the
river for 5 miles more on the same course, when we crossed a third-magnitude
creek near its confluence with the river. A little beyond this creek a NATIVE
CAMP was surprised. Two gins and four men ran away, leaving behind them a whole
armoury of spears barbed with iron and kangaroo-bone.</p>
<p>We continued our south-east course for 6 miles more over soft decomposed
granite country, the river lying about 2 miles to our right, and crossed a
running creek of the second-magnitude coming from the east. Some horse tracks
were seen on the right bank of the creek, in all probability belonging to
DONALD LAING'S PARTY, who were known to be out prospecting in the same region.
Love had heard a shot on the 21st while engaged in cooking at our Camp No. 13
on the Peach. From subsequent comparison of dates, there remains no doubt that
Laing's party and ours were within a short distance of each other at this time,
although we did not chance to meet.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 535}</u></p>
<p>From this creek we struck due south and in 2 miles crossed the PEACH, and
camped on good grass on its left bank. The river carried a running stream, but
it was much smaller than at any of the places where we had seen it before. It
was flanked with scrub and palms. <i>Xanthorrhaea</i> on the left bank. (CAMP
14. Latitude, by observation of Achernar, 13&deg; 37' S.) [The PEACH RIVER is
now known to be one of the heads of the river named the ARCHER by the Jardine
Brothers in 1865.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>December 24. In 1 mile south-east, up the left bank, we crossed the river
and struck eastward, passing by the south side of BIRTHDAY MOUNT in 2 miles.
Four miles further we crossed from the right to the left bank of a
third-magnitude creek, coming from the mountains to the north-east (IRVINE
CREEK).</p>
<p>From Irvine Creek we struck south-east. In 2&frac12; miles we saw LAING'S
(?) TRACKS, going north-west. In a mile and a half more we crossed (right to
left bank) a dry fourth-magnitude creek, and, half a mile further, another,
which was afterwards named BEETLE CREEK.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more we crossed a deep palmy creek of the first
magnitude, with large water-holes, and camped on the left bank. We named this
CHRISTMAS CREEK. (CAMP 15: Moreton Bay ash; J., Christmas, 79. Latitude, by
observation of Achernar, 13&deg; 41' S.)</p>
<p>The whole of this day's stage was poor sandy granite country, nearly flat
and poorly grassed. Grasstrees, pandanus, teatree, and small brushwood.</p>
<p>December 25. In company with Mr. Crosbie, I ascended a hill about 1 mile N.
18&deg; E. from the camp and took a series of compass observations. The hill
was of granite, with QUARTZ REEFS containing much decomposed pyrites. We next
visited my OLD CAMP No. 39 of last trip, which is just below the junction of
Christmas Creek with the Peach. The two streams are about half a mile apart at
our present camp. In crossing the Peach here, my horse slipped on a root, and
in plunging knocked me off against a bough and damaged the stock of my rifle. I
was faint and giddy for a short time from the stroke of the bough across my
abdomen, but I was surprised to find that I had sustained no serious
injury.</p>
<p>The prospectors and Macdonald got fine colours [of GOLD] in Christmas
Creek.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I plotted up the <i>route</i> and observations. Crosbie was
out up the valley of the Peach. He fired a shot at a mark, and presently five
signal fires sprang up in various parts of the scrubby hills a circumstance
showing that the ABORIGINALS were watching our movements closely.</p>
<p>December 26. We left Camp 15, and struck east-south-east. In a mile and a
half we arrived at the PEACH RIVER. The valley</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 536}</u></p>
<p>was here very narrow, and choked up with DENSE SCRUB. The prospectors cut a
track, and we crossed to the left bank of the river. We kept the left bank SE.,
ESE. and E. for a mile and a half through scrubby country, when the valley
again narrowed, and we camped on a little open pocket. (CAMP 16.)</p>
<p>Hume got somewhat coarser GOLD here than any yet obtained, but there was
very little wash, the violence of the brawling torrent having carried it all
away.</p>
<p>Crosbie and I went out on foot to spy the nature of the country up the
river. For 2 miles (east-south-east) we kept the bed of the river, which rose
in these 2 miles at least 500 feet. It was a rushing torrent over bare rocks
and among boulders. At the end of the 2 miles the river branched, the two beds
being of about equal size, but the southmost having much the larger stream of
water. We ascended a nearly bare ridge (about 800 feet high) between the two
branches of the river. A quarter of a mile up the river brought us abreast of
one of the most imposing waterfalls in Queensland. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> A sheet of white foaming water dashed down from a large
tributary over the left wall of the valley of the southern branch of the Peach.
There must be a fall of at least 500 feet in a quarter of a mile.</p>
<p>In a quarter of a mile more we reached the summit of the ridge, and could
see to the east for about 2 miles over SCRUBBY MOUNTAINS with a fringe of large
hoop-pines standing up against the sky. This range, forming the DIVIDE OF THE
PENINSULA between the heads of the [South] Coen and the Peach on the one hand,
and the east coast on the other, I named the MC!LWRAITH RANGE, in honour of the
present Premier [afterwards Sir Thomas McIlwraith, now deceased.&mdash;R. L.
J.].</p>
<p>The banks of the river and of all its tributaries were clothed with DENSE
SCRUB, with palms and vines. The latter made travelling very toilsome and even
painful.</p>
<p>Coming home, we crossed the northern branch of the river, and came down the
ridge on the north side to the camp.</p>
<p>The defiles of the river, and almost all the high country crossed on foot,
were composed of a fine-grained grey granite with black mica, and singularly
devoid of reefs. It is evidently not from this quarter that the gold in the
lower reaches of the river has been derived. My firm belief is that it must
come from well back on the tableland, and that only fine light gold has been
able to escape through the gorges into the low country.</p>
<p>December 27. Leaving Camp 16, we got up on the tableland by the spur on the
right bank of the Peach, an ascent of about 800 feet, over open ridges timbered
with box, bloodwood and ironwood, with a few ironbarks. The gullies were
scrubby, with some hoop or Maryborough pines. After a sinuous course for 5
miles in a</p>
<blockquote>[1) I had not then seen the falls of the Barren or
Herbert.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 537}</u></p>
<p>general east-north-east direction, we camped on a ridge on the left Dank of
a gully (with a little water) falling into CHRISTMAS CREEK. [CAMP 17: mahogany
tree, J. 27D. 79.)</p>
<p>About a mile back from the camp some REEFS were seen, containing galena and
iron oxide. They were considered very promising," but yielded NO GOLD on being
crushed and washed.</p>
<p>December 28. The horses were all abroad in the morning, the ank grass at the
camp not being to their liking. One of ours had gone back nearly to Camp 16,
and it was late in the afternoon before the last of Crosbie's was recovered. I
went with Charlie to a mountain (mica-schist, with numerous REEFS on the
eastern slope) between the Peach and Christmas Creek, to see if there was any
practicable <i>route</i> to the east. The only way at all open was to
south-south-east.</p>
<p>December 29. Leaving Hamil and Love in the camp, we went out to the
south-east to try to penetrate to the upper reaches of the Peach&mdash;Crosbie,
Hume and Layland making the attempt by another <i>route</i>. We threaded our
way through openings in the SCRUB for about 4 miles to the right wall of the
valley of the north branch of the Peach (above the defile previously visited).
Here we came on the prospecting party at the further end of a pocket, and as it
was now evident there was only one (if any) way we kept together for the rest
of the excursion. With a good deal of trouble a path was partly cut and partly
found through the scrub sidling down the wall of the valley into an open plain,
which we crossed (quarter of a mile) over to a tributary (a third-magnitude
creek) of the north branch of the Peach, on which we camped. (CAMP 173: J.C.
79.)</p>
<p>The creek, which was running, with a bed full of boulders on are granite
bars, was prospected, but without success.</p>
<p>Crosbie and I went on, over ridges lightly timbered, but flanked by densely
scrubby gullies, about 1 mile southward to the north branch of the Peach River,
above the hill which we had reached on the 26th. We found a strong current
running, apparently quite as large as below the defile, and yet above the
defile it receives both the south branch and the creek with the large
waterfall. The bottom was of granite to which the <i>detritus</i> carried over
it by the current had imparted a fine polish.</p>
<p>From the size of the river here I should not expect to reach its source for
20 miles at least, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and yet its course is so
tortuous, the country so hilly, and all the water-courses, large and small, so
equally clothed with SCRUB, that it was impossible to trace the valley for half
a mile, even from eminences from which an extensive prospect could be obtained.
The river could, as a rule, only be approached by cutting paths through the
scrub&mdash;taking the</p>
<blockquote>[1) The head of the river cannot have been much more than two miles
distant after L&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 538}</u></p>
<p>chances of finding that one had been cutting to the river or only to some
insignificant gully.</p>
<p>Hume and Layland went to the river in the afternoon and prospected; they got
only fine "colours" of GOLD. They reported that where they were, the rocks in
the bed of the river were washed quite clean, and that the current was so rapid
that "quicksilver couldn't stay."</p>
<p>December 30. At 8 o'clock last night heavy rain began to fall, and it
continued till 8 this morning. THE WET SEASON HAD SET IN.</p>
<p>We packed up to continue our course up the river, if practicable. The rain
ceased as we started and held off for the greater part of the day, although the
sky was dull and threatening. We kept beating about to east and south, among
openings in the SCRUB, or cutting our way through it, and succeeded in reaching
the base of a pinecrested range round whose eastern end the river appeared to
come. We found that we were here within the drainage area of the "Falls branch"
of the Peach, on one of its tributaries running about a "sluice-head of water."
We then made for the main river and struck it at a waterfall, which discharged
itself into a huge cauldron, whose edges were alive with FRESH-WATER CRABS.
There appeared to be open country on the right bank, but we were unable to
cross, the bottom being smooth and bare and the banks very steep. We returned
to where we had crossed the river before, and recrossed it, finding that in all
our wanderings we had only succeeded in making half a mile up the river. We
tried to follow the open crests of the hills forming the right wall of the
valley, but in a mile were baffled by the density of the SCRUB and gave up the
attempt.</p>
<p>My hope was that payable gold might be found in the upper reaches of the
river on the tableland, near the supposed source of the GOLD, and where the
torrent was not impetuous enough to sweep away all its own <i>detritus</i>. We
had not yet reached such a place, if it existed. If there be such a place, it
must be beyond the pine-crested range where we stopped short to-day. I
intended, on the return journey, to make another attempt by cutting paths for
the horses in advance from camp to camp, as well as to try the unexplored
country on the King and Lukin [Holroyd] Rivers to the west of our
<i>route</i>.</p>
<p>Most of the country traversed to-day and yesterday was of fine-grained
granite, with some quartz&mdash;not very much, and not much charged with
metallic ores. But there was quartz among the gravel of the river, whereas
there was none in, and but little below, the gorge.</p>
<p>On our return to Camp 17 (about 3 p.m.), we learned that HAMIL AND LOVE had
had a visit of the NATIVES in force about two hours before. Love was baking at
the door of his tent, when he saw twenty or thirty blacks, about loo yards off,
coming up the green slope towards the tents, talking and gesticulating
eagerly,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 539}</u></p>
<p>They probably had seen the bulk of the party leaving the camp yesterday, and
thought that the two men left in charge were out, and had come to plunder. Love
and Hamil fired at them, and pursued them as far as the gully. With
characteristic Scottish <i>sang-froid</i>, Love declared that he would have
followed further but for the johnny-cakes, which he had left on the fire, and
which he could not afford to have burned. Arrived at the green knoll on the
further side of the creek, the natives shouted and danced, especially one tall
fellow, whose "fling" Love very much admired.</p>
<p>We had just finished dinner, when the BLACKS again appeared on the opposite
side of the gully. A tall native got on a green knoll about 600 yards off, and
shouted and defied us with indecent gestures. Charlie and this champion
harangued one another like Greek heroes. The substance of the miall oration
was, according to Charlie (who must have gathered it from his gestures, for he
understood nothing of his speech), that Charlie might come over and join them,
but as for the rest of us they had legions of friends who could come from all
points of the compass and fall upon us. Only the one man kept in view, but from
time to time he turned and addressed a crowd on the crown of the knoll behind
him, and was answered by them in a kind of chorus of encouragement.</p>
<p>Crosbie, judging that the blacks would not have stayed and tried to "bounce"
us unless they were in considerable numbers and meant mischief, put an end to
the conference by firing a long shot at the spokesman, who dodged behind a tree
with extraordinary agility, I believe before the bullet passed him, and
vanished.</p>
<p>In the evening, to satisfy ourselves that the horses were safe for the
night, we visited the knoll and its neighbourhood. We saw nothing of the blacks
except the smoke of their camp fires about 3 miles down Christmas Creek, where
they were welcome to stay as far as we were concerned.</p>
<p>It rained heavily most of the night.</p>
<p>December 31, 1879. Heavy rain all day and night; the party engaged in
horse-shoeing, writing, mending harness and odd jobs.</p>
<p>January 1, 1880. Showery all day.</p>
<p>January 2. We left Camp 17, and retraced our steps by Camps 16 and 15 (8
miles). The PEACH was scarcely swollen; but CHRISTMAS CREEK was running
strongly, so that we were almost aswim at the crossing, where there was only a
shallow water-hole when we crossed before. From Camp 15 we skirted the range
(north 1 mile, and north round to north-east one mile and a half) into a valley
bearing E. 41' S. from BIRTHDAY MOUNT, and went up the valley for 1 mile to the
north-east. We camped on the left bank of a running creek of the fourth
magnitude (BEETLE CREEK), with scrubby banks, figs, palms and vines. (CAMP
18.)</p>
<p>After we had camped, I ascended the hills on the right hand of the valley to
reconnoitre. I went up a scrubby spur to a hill</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 540}</u></p>
<p>about half a mile north-east of the camp, and found that STINGING TREES were
very plentiful. This hill bears 41&deg; E. from MOUNT CROLL. Crosbie joined me
here, he having ascended by another spur. On the way up he disturbed a NATIVE,
who was in the act of lighting a signal fire. We followed the bare grassy crest
of the right wall of the valley of BEETLE CREEK (the sides and bottom being
very scrubby) for a mile to N. 36&deg; E., when we came in sight of Camp 17,
bearing S. 36&deg; E. and about 5 miles distant.</p>
<p>The hills on the right wall of the valley were of granite with black mica
and orthoclase felspar. There were a few REEFS of quartz, and some of mixed
quartz and orthoclase felspar.</p>
<p>We had allowed ourselves to go too far before night overtook us. It was very
difficult to get home in the dark, down the steep slope of the valley, which
was strewn with boulders and dense with scrub, the latter infested with
stinging trees.</p>
<p>There was heavy rain through the night. About supper-time we were suddenly
invaded by a PLAGUE OF SMALL BEETLES, which drowned themselves in the tea,
swarmed the meat and sugar, ate holes in the saddle-cloths and pack-bags, and
crawled over our persons in legions. The nuisance abated somewhat towards the
morning.</p>
<p>January 3. The rain continued till about midday. We packed up and left Camp
18 at half-past two. We had just left, however, when the rain recommenced. We
had a miserable day's travelling, and were in constant fear of flooding or
bogging. We made about 7 miles to NE., N. and NE., round the right wall of the
BEETLE CREEK valley, into the valley of WILSON CREEK. Wilson Creek was flooded
when we crossed it. Luckily the rain stopped just before we camped on Wilson
Creek (although the creek rose higher afterwards) and there was no more during
the night. (CAMP 19.)</p>
<p>January 4 (Sunday). This was a fine "drying" day, which was much needed. I
ascended the mountain on the right wall of the valley. This mountain bears N.
26&deg; E. from Mount Croll.</p>
<p>Troubled by a doubt whether Wilson Creek was not really the main head of
Irvine Creek, I ascended in the evening a hill on the left wall of the valley,
and satisfied myself that IRVINE CREEK came out of another valley between
Wilson Creek and Birthday Mount. BEETLE CREEK and WILSON CREEK are tributaries
of the IRVINE. [Wilson Creek was named after James Grant Wilson, a former
colleague on the Geological Survey of Scotland, since deceased.&mdash;R. L.
J.]</p>
<p>January 5. A dull wet day. Before starting I had to adjust a quarrel between
Macdonald and Love. They were on the worst possible terms for the rest of the
journey. We travelled up the WILSON VALLEY to its head, about 31 miles to east,
north and north-west. About 2 miles from our camp we saw four or five</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 541}</u></p>
<p>BLACKS at a camp beside a scrubby creek. We rode up to the camp, and the
blacks got into the scrub. In the boughs of a tree were two bundles which we
took to be corpses, from their smell and shape. While we w r ere standing here
some more blacks were seen sneaking up to us from behind the camp. We rode
towards them and they fled, only one fellow appearing as if he had a mind to
make a stand. No shots were fired. A quarter of a mile further another camp was
seen to the right, and a few blacks. Love and Charlie rode after them till
recalled. One [of the natives] dropped a spear in his flight.</p>
<p>There was not much of an ascent to the divide between the valley of Wilson
Creek and the next valley; but the travelling became rather difficult among
intricate scrubby gullies, and very disagreeable owing to the rain and fog.
Just about the divide we heard NATIVES howling, apparently from a hill to the
left, although they were hidden from us by a scrub. Crosbie's party, riding a
little ahead of mine, saw some more blacks as they crossed a gully. We were
just approaching this gully, the path being down a "point" towards which the
scrub converged. Charlie had reached the point of convergence of the scrubs.
The pack-horses came next, followed by Macdonald on the left, myself in the
middle, land Love on the right. Without any warning, a shower of SPEARS came at
us from the scrub to the left. One spear must have passed behind Macdonald's
back (he was slightly in advance) land over my horse's neck. It stuck in the
near shoulder of Love's horse (Moonlight), brushing my bridle-wrist on its way.
It was a narrow escape for Love, as a few inches back the spear would have
transfixed his leg. He tried to pull the spear out of his horse's shoulder, but
could not. We dismounted and fired into the scrub, but we never even saw the
enemy, and could only guess at his whereabouts from the angle at which the
spears stuck in the ground. While we were thus engaged the spear dropped out of
Moonlight's shoulder and was lost in the long grass. It was afterwards found
that one of the pack-horses (Poodle) had been grazed on the chest by a spear.
Pursuit would have been useless in the intricate scrub and long grass. We
camped about 2 miles down the gully (ATTACK GULLY) to the north-north-west in
open country. (CAMP 20.) Heavy rain began when we arrived at the camp, and
continued for the rest of the day. Our cartridges were much the worse for the
wet, and were dried with considerable difficulty. We threw the wounded horse
and probed and cut open the wound, but the spear (which could not have been
barbed) had left nothing behind. It had glanced over the shoulder-blade.</p>
<p>January 6. This was a fine morning and w r e packed up and jgot away
comfortably. We followed the gully for about a mile to the north, when it fell
into a creek of the first magnitude (ATTACK CREEK) coming from east-south-east.
For a mile further to the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 542}</u></p>
<p>north, we kept the left bank of the creek, when, on its trending to
west-north-west, we crossed it and continued our journey northward. Attack
Creek is one of the heads of the large creek which falls into the Peach below
our Camp 13. It was a little flooded when we crossed and had rather more water
in it than the Peach at our upper crossing.</p>
<p>For 2&frac12; miles to the north, after crossing Attack Creek, we had very
disagreeable travelling, fearing every minute to be engulfed in boggy
"graveyard flats," till we crossed a creek (SKAE CREEK) flowing to the west,
with scrubby banks. [Named after Harriman M. Skae, a former colleague of the
Geological Survey of Scotland, since deceased.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more to the north we had reached the range which formed
the right wall of the valley of the Skae and Attack Creeks. Here the rain began
to fall heavily, as it continued to do for the rest of the day and most of the
night.</p>
<p>We skirted the range to the north-west for 2 miles, when we crossed a
third-magnitude creek coming out of a deep valley in the hills to the right.
This creek was remarkable for magnificent Leichhardt trees among its scrub
timber.</p>
<p>One mile and a half WNW. from this creek (crossing a fourthmagnitude creek
with quartz boulders in its bed) we came to another point of the range. The
rock here was slate and greywacke with much quartz. We rounded this point (from
north-west to east for 2&frac12; miles) to a fourth-magnitude creek. In 1 mile
more to east-north-east we camped on the right bank of a creek of the fourth
magnitude. (CAMP 21.)</p>
<p>January 7. It rained heavily till it was too late in the day to make a
start. We did our best to clean and dry our harness, stores, clothing and
blankets. In the afternoon I went on foot over the hills to north-east and
south-east of our camp. The hills were of fine-grained granite in the central
axis, and slate and greywacke with much quartz (cavities coated with peroxide
of iron) on the outstanding spurs. When the mist cleared off I was able to take
an extensive series of compass bearings. VIEW HILL near our 13th camp lay due
west.</p>
<p>January 8. We determined to penetrate, and, if possible, to cross, the
MC!LWRAITH RANGE by a valley which we had seen from View Hill, and on whose
waters we were now camped.</p>
<p>We rounded a point of the hills (from NW. to N.) for 1 mile and thereafter
kept a general course of E. 29&deg; N.</p>
<p>In 2 miles we crossed a third-magnitude creek (named the FALLOCH), draining
the north side of a granite mountain which we named BEN LOMOND, as it bore a
strong resemblance to the mountain of that name in the Highlands of Scotland.
CROSBIE got touched with STINGING TREE in the scrub on the north side of the
creek. A lump like a hen's egg rose immediately under his</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 543}</u></p>
<p>arm, and he sickened and streamed with perspiration. By the end of the day,
however, he seemed little the worse. The horse which Layland rode also got
stung, and was very restive for the remainder of the day.</p>
<p>The valley of a larger stream (which we named GEIKIE CREEK) lies a mile or
two to the north of the Falloch and forms the principal head of the stream
falling into the Peach below our 13th camp. The Falloch joins it about 4 miles
below where we crossed it. Skae and Attack Creeks converge to form another
large tributary joining the Geikie about 8 miles below the mouth of the
Falloch.</p>
<p>In 1 mile we crossed a third-magnitude creek in the same valley as the
Falloch.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more we passed to the right of a little granite hill,
which I ascended, and which afforded a magnificent view. I took an extensive
series of bearings. We could see through the gap to the east a number of lofty
tops, which I named the MACROSSAN RANGE [after the Hon. John Macrossan,
Minister for Mines.&mdash;R. L. J.]. Here the rain began to fall heavily.</p>
<p>We went on for 3 miles to the east, and after crossing two creeks of the
fourth magnitude, camped (in the rain) on the right bank of a third&mdash;one
of the heads of GEIKIE CREEK. (CAMP 22.)</p>
<p>January 9. We had rain for the greater part of the day. We got ACROSS THE
DIVIDE [between the Pacific and Gulf waters], travelling, about 10 miles in
all, a little to the south of east. At first we crossed easy grassy ridges,
often treeless, sometimes timbered with stringybark, bloodwood, and <i>Cycas
media</i>.</p>
<p>We had just got on the eastern waters when the PROSPECTING PARTY, who were
riding a little ahead, were mobbed by a troop of NATIVES, whom they attacked
and drove off.</p>
<p>About 2 miles further we had to descend into a deep valley [the valley of
what was named "SWALLOW CREEK," from the name of the mare which was
killed.&mdash;R. L. J.], by a pocket leading down from the top of a spur, but
ending in thick SCRUB. The cutting of this scrub caused a short halt below the
brow of the hill. I cast many an anxious look behind, but grudged to take any
of the wearied horses back up the hill. All at once, without any warning, a
SPEAR came from behind and STUCK deeply in the off flank of the MARE on which I
was riding. She bounded forward, burst the girth, and threw me, scattering my
note-book and maps (which, however, I recovered) among the long grass. The
remainder of a parcel of pumpkin seeds, of which I had dropped a few at every
camp hitherto, was lost.</p>
<p>Love, Charlie and I went back on our tracks in pursuit of the snake-like
enemy; but he had got into the scrub, and further search would have been
useless.</p>
<p>We cut off the spear a few inches above the skin, and got the mare on to the
camp with some difficulty. We had prepared to</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 544}</u></p>
<p>throw her, but she lay down quietly and submitted to have the spear-head cut
out without a struggle. The head was buried four inches deep, and had a bone
barb about an inch and a half long. She appeared in great agony and very sick,
and DIED before morning.</p>
<p>Hearing the natives cooee after we had got into camp, Crosbie, Charlie and I
went back on our track to near the scene of the disaster, and waited for some
time in the hope that they would show themselves, but they did not.</p>
<p>We camped on the left bank of a gully overlooking the valley [of the NISBET
RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.] dividing the MCILWRAITH from the MACROSSAN RANGE. (CAMP
23.) [We probably crossed KENNEDY'S TRACK of November, 1848, before arriving at
our Camp 23.&mdash;R.L.J.]</p>

<h5>ANNOTATED REPRINT</h5>
<p>JANUARY 10. We had packed up to move down (from Camp 23) into the open
country in the Nisbet valley to the east, and were having breakfast, when a
party of BLACKS approached us from the hill behind (on our yesterday's track).
[SiE MAP C.] They had SPEARS in their hands, and shouted and gesticulated. Four
or five of us ran up the hill to meet them. They advanced skilfully in
"skirmishing order," dodging behind trees and rocks and taking advantage of
every bit of cover, but those in the rear exposed themselves freely. We FIRED
at those in the rear, killing one and wounding another. The rest vanished into
the scrub. The one killed had been able to stagger back for about a hundred
yards, into the gully to which we traced him by his blood. He wore a necklace
of pearl-shell. When we had gone back to the camp to finish our packing we
heard</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 546}</u></p>
<p>a loud howling, and on returning to the place found that the body had been
carried away. We heard them afterwards in the scrub holding a sort of wake. By
turns they chanted a harangue in a tone of lamentation, to which the others
answered in chorus. They, no doubt, knew themselves to be secure in the scrub,
where, indeed, it would have been quite useless for us to have followed
them.</p>
<p>We went down into the valley to the east (NISBET CREEK). When we had gone
about a mile, we heard a great hallooing rise from the camp we had left. The
natives had probably found the carcase of the mare. We should have burned the
carcase had time permitted, but as we could not wait till it was consumed, and
as we knew that if we heaped a fire on it the meat would only be roasted by the
time the natives appeared, we had to leave it to them. We also threw away the
worst of our pack-saddles.</p>
<p>We travelled across the valley of Nisbet Creek for about 2 miles in a
general easterly direction. A path had to be cut through the scrub on the bank
of the creek. We made for the northmost of two camp smokes which we had seen
from our last camp. A party of NATIVES were just clearing out from a camp a
quarter of a mile off when we arrived at our destination. Crosbie and Hamil
rode after, but could scarcely get a sight of them. They left a number of
SPEARS behind, which were put in the fire. One of the spears was the ugliest
weapon I ever saw. Its head was a little flattened, and edged with a row of
chips of bottle-glass let into grooves. It was enough to sicken one of savage
warfare. I never saw flattened spear-heads among the Australian natives before,
and I am inclined to think that the spear, or at least the idea, must have been
derived from some of the South Sea Islands. A few hours later we found that the
natives had returned to their camp and carried off the dillybags, nuts, etc. I
was glad to think that their spears&mdash;especially the glass-headed
one&mdash;had been put out of their way. We camped on the site of another
native camp, abandoned in the morning. (CAMP 24.)</p>
<p>Rain began as soon as we had pitched tents. The remainder of the day was
spent in horse-shoeing, drying cartridges, and other odd jobs. [It is
conjectured that on 22nd October, 1848, Kennedy was travelling" between the
hills," <i>viz.</i>, the McIlwraith and Macrossan Ranges. Rations were short
and illness and despondency prevailed among the men, while the horses were
daily becoming weaker.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>January 11. The day kept fine till one o'clock, but it rained heavily for
the rest of the afternoon.</p>
<p>In the morning Crosbie, Hume and Hamil went back to Camp 23, and prospected
in the gully below it. They got "shotty colours" [of GOLD] in an alluvial flat.
On their arrival they took out the pack-saddle from the gully where we had left
it, thinking to take it away to replace one of theirs. They were no distance,
and</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 547}</u></p>
<p>not long away, while prospecting; but on their return they found the saddle
stripped of its cloth and hair and all of its iron, even to the brass-headed
tacks. They found tracks following on ours to near our present camp. Strange to
say, the carcase of the mare was untouched.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon we saw the blacks' camp fires spring up on a gully about
half a mile up the hill to the west of Camp 24. To-day, Charlie descried some
NATIVES crossing from one scrub to another by a bare patch on a hill-side which
commanded an excellent view of our camp. About one o'clock I made them out with
the field-glass, standing in a group of five or six, with spears in their
hands, on another bare spot near the top of the hill, at a distance which we
guessed at about 1,000 yards, looking intently into our camp. They offered a
good mark, and we deemed it justifiable in the circumstances to teach them that
they were not safe even at that distance. Crosbie and I took good aim, and
fired simultaneously. One black, either bolder than the rest, or astonished, or
possibly wounded, stayed a second or two, but the others ran for the nearest
scrub at a breakneck pace. Another dodged back in a few minutes and picked up a
spear which he had left behind in his haste.</p>
<p>I believe that this LONG SHOT had a powerful effect on the mind of the
natives. Even the death of some of their number had not deterred them,
hitherto, from following and annoying us; but from this day forward we saw
nothing more of them for two months, and although we camped for a week within 5
miles of Camp 24, they never even came on our track.</p>
<p>Crosbie and I had designed to ascend the hill where we saw the blacks, after
dinner, to have a view ahead, but the heavy rain and fog which began shortly
after put it out of the question.</p>
<p>January 12. Crosbie and I ascended the hill in the morning. The blacks had
moved their camp. We saw their smoke near the foot of the hill, half a mile to
the south. From the hill-top we saw the sea, apparently only about 5 miles off,
with low forest land intervening between it and the range. No. VIII Island was
visible, its north end bearing E. 34&deg; N., and its south end E. 32&deg; N.
[No. VIII, or Lowrie Island, is in S. lat. 13&deg; 16' 30" and E. long.
143&deg; 36'.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>On coming down, we packed up and resumed our travels. We had heavy rain
while we were on the way, but fortunately it was fair when we pitched our
tents, which we did on an open ridge on the left bank of a creek which I named
HAYS CREEK, about 5 miles in a general north-north-west direction from Camp 24.
Hays Creek (named after Mr. Walter Hays, of Townsville) falls into the sea
opposite No. VIII Island. (CAMP 25.) [Site of the present HAYS CREEK
PROVISIONAL GOLDFIELD, south of which, on the Nisbet Fall, DODD'S REEF has been
worked.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 548}</u></p>
<p>It rained most of the night, Macdonald was ill with fever and
biliousness.</p>
<p>January 13. Light rain and fog till midday. I kept my tent, plotting up the
work. When the fog cleared, Crosbie and I ascended the hill to the east of the
camp to get a view and plan our next move. The hill was of porphyry, or granite
very poor in mica. The prospectors got colours in HAYS CREEK near the camp,
above a waterfall. Hume and Hamil went down the valley of HAYS CREEK TO THE
SEA, crossing a mangrove swamp. There was a long sandy beach. They saw much
ironsand on the beach, but it yielded them no gold. They saw three piles of
DUGONG TUSKS and some pieces of WRECK. Layland went back about 2 miles on our
yesterday's track, to a place where we had noticed some red-stained quartz
reefs, but got no gold.</p>
<p>January 14. Rain and fog. I went up the mountain <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> which bore N. 25&deg; E. from our camp about 3 miles
off, across the Hays Creek valley (which is marked in the Admiralty Chart as an
"opening in the hills"). Between the creek and the mountain is a line of
untimbered green hills running north and south. They are composed for the most
part of granite, with a band of micaceous slate (weathering buff) on the east
side. On the top is a large north-and-south QUARTZ REEF, apparently poor in
iron. A parallel reef on the west side, however, has some "brownstone." The
large reef crosses Hays Creek to the mountain which Crosbie and I ascended
yesterday.</p>
<p>The summit of the mountain is a "knife-edge" ridge, for the most part free
of timber. There is a dense SCRUB on the eastern side only. For some distance
north of the top, however, the scrub overlaps the western slope a little. From
near the top I could see CAPE SIDMOUTH (hilly), and the sandy spit [FRIENDLY
POINT.&mdash;R. L. J.] to the north of the Cape; I had also a view of BEN
LOMOND, and the outstanding end (with the conical knob) of the left wall of the
ATTACK VALLEY. I sketched the rivers falling to the north in the valley
dividing the Macrossan from the McIlwraith Range, their courses being clearly
defined by dark scrub. The principal river, the LOCKHART (so named from my old
friend, Mr. Hugh Lockhart, of Edinburgh; born 1844, died 15th December, 1920),
is skirted by large untimbered plains. CAPE WEYMOUTH was visible occasionally
when the fog lifted.</p>
<blockquote>[1) This mountain is an isolated peak of the Macrossan Range, and
may be known as ADAM PEAK. To a distinguishable section of the Macrossan Range
lying west of Cape Sidmouth, the marine surveyors of H.M.S. "<i>Dart</i>," in
1896-8, gave the name of ADAM RANGE, which I contend must be reduced to ADAM
HEIGHTS, as it forms part of the MACROSSAN RANGE. Indeed, the officers of the
"<i>Dart</i>" and other marine surveyors cut up the Macrossan Range into nine
"Ranges," which must be reduced to "Heights" or "Hills." The Macrossan Range,
which, as a distinct geographical entity, I had named in 1879-80 and denned as
extending from 12&deg; 51' to 13&deg; 39' S. latitude, had been shown on
official maps since 1880, and there was no justification for restricting it to
10 nautical miles, and creating eight other "ranges" out of the
remainder.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 549}</u></p>
<p>The prospectors tried the gullies draining the hill which Crosbie and I
visited yesterday, but got no gold; they then tried some gullies, tributaries
of HAYS CREEK, beside the quartziferous ridges crossed in travelling from Camp
24. They got some fine colours, and one "shotty" grain of GOLD.</p>
<p>January 15. Heavy rain almost all day. Messrs. Hume and Hamil tried the
gullies below the green quartziferous ridges I crossed yesterday, but got only
one fine "colour" of GOLD. In the afternoon Crosbie and I went across to a
creek about 3 miles west of the camp, one of the tributaries of the Lockhart
River, coming from the McIlwraith Range; we found it much larger than we
expected, as it had twice as much water as Hays Creek. We determined to move
camp in this direction as soon as the weather permitted. [This may be what has
since been named CHERRY CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>January 16. It rained most of the night, and almost all day. Moving camp was
out of the question.</p>
<p>January 17. It rained most of the night and to-day, till it was too late to
move camp. The flats which we had to cross were very boggy. It cleared a little
at one time, and we saw the sun for the first time since the 11th. After dinner
I accompanied Messrs. Crosbie and Layland to the creek we had visited the day
before yesterday. [Cherry Creek (?).&mdash;R. L. J.] We tried some crevices
among bars on the left bank near where the creek escapes from the hills, but
got no gold. The bars are of highly micaceous gneiss, with some beds of
micaceous greywacke, and some of Lydian stone. The beds are vertical, and
strike north and south. The creek falls to the north-north-east. During our
stay at Hays Creek immense flocks of TORRES STRAIT PIGEONS left the islands,
and flew inland at daybreak; they flew pretty high, but we managed to shoot
enough for the pot.</p>
<p>The night kept fair, and I even saw a star.</p>
<p>January 18. Left Camp 25. After crossing some boggy flats, with teatree and
grasstree, we struck the creek visited yesterday [CHERRY CREEK (?).&mdash;R. L.
J.] in 3 miles, at a point which bore W. 27 south from the mountain on the
north side of the "opening in the hills." Thereafter we kept a general course
of NNW. In a mile, over grassy ridges, with scrubby gullies, we crossed
obliquely a wide valley with two large third-magnitude creeks. In the last of
these GREYHOUND CREEK a horse of that name fell and wet a fifty-pound bag of
flour; all that was wet was baked the same night, so that there was no loss.
Near Greyhound Creek a GIN AND CHILD were seen. We crossed next some high
ridges of granite, affording a fine view of the MACROSSAN RANGE, but as it was
getting late in the day we dropped down into the valley again, and camped on
the left bank of a gully. A camp fire was seen about half a mile back from our
camp. We travelled</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 550}</u></p>
<p>about 9 miles on a general NNW. course. The day was fine till three o'clock,
but very close and steamy. It rained from three till nine. (CAMP 26.)</p>
<p>January 19. Rain in the morning, and showers and drizzle till midday; warm
and close for rest of the day.</p>
<p>Before leaving Camp 26, Crosbie and I ascended a hill near the camp and took
bearings, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
From NW. end of Macrossan Range, S. 13&deg; W.
From Conical Island ("High Island") in Lloyd Bay,<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> S. 19&frac12;&deg; W.
From east end of headland ("Red Hills" in Admiralty Chart) south of Cape Weymouth, S. 5&deg; W.
From Camp 25, on Hays Creek, N. 30&deg; W.
</pre>
<p>From this hill we had a clear view of the whole course of the LOCKHART RIVER
from its source near Hays Creek to Lloyd Bay (about 25 miles), where it entered
the mangroves, in which we could see large inlets. CAPTAIN MORESBY tried to get
up this river from the sea, but failed, as will be seen by the following
extract from his work<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Wishing to clear up a doubt as to the existence or
non-existence of a river reported at the bottom of Lloyd Bay, we stood in and
anchored near Low Island on the evening of the 15th [January, 1872]. The chart
at this point is marked 'Apparent opening of a large river,' [More recent
editions of the chart have 'Dense mangrove swamps and salt-water
creeks.'&mdash;R. L. J.] and it will be seen by a glance at the map of North
Queensland that a river would be a rich gift of nature here, as affording an
opening into the country and a highway for the transit of agricultural produce.
Navigating Lieutenant Connor and I, in the galley, and Mr. Mourilyan, in the
gig, came to an anchor accordingly off the supposed entrance of the river at 11
p.m. At daybreak we began our search for the river, and explored one salt-water
creek after another, but each was a failure, and led only to entanglement in
the swamp, where clouds of mosquitoes resented our invasion of their holds.
There was NO RIVER. The drainage of a hill range 6 or 7 miles inland had
created a swamp of many miles extent, covered by mangroves, and intersected by
these salt-water creeks, and that was all."</blockquote>

<h5>ANNOTATED REPRINT</h5>
<p>JANUARY 19. On leaving Camp 26, we tried to get back to the western fall of
the MC!LWRAITH RANGE. [SEE MAP C.] We got west for about 5 miles, without
interruption, by tolerably clear ridges, bounded by scrubby gullies. At the end
of the 5 miles we had a view across the valley</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 552}</u></p>
<p>of GREYHOUND CREEK, whose head bends round to the north-west. The creek has
a deep rocky channel, and wide bamboo scrubs. We could see the divide before
us, but could not cross the creek, and, after trying it in three places
(carrying us about a mile to the south), we had to camp on the left bank. (CAMP
27.)</p>
<p>This was a fine night, with struggling moonlight. The sky was quite clear
for a short time. The ground had been so saturated with rain that, when I got
into my hammock, one of the trees to which it was attached came out by the
roots and fell over the tent. Crosbie was still more unfortunate. He was driven
out of one tent by ants, and a tree supporting his tent, when it had been
repitched, came down with him.</p>
<p>January 20. This was a fine day, with only one shower, though dull and
cloudy. Crosbie, Hume, Layland and Charlie went ahead for about 8 miles,
cutting a track through bamboo SCRUBS for about 3 miles. I occupied myself in
constructing working maps from the charts, etc. The night was fine.</p>
<p>January 21. A showery day. We left Camp 27 by the track cut yesterday. After
crossing GREYHOUND CREEK, we crossed a branch of it twice. For 3 miles the path
led through bamboo jungle and SCRUB, in a general west-north-west direction. At
the end of the 3 miles we got on a ridge forming the right wall of a valley,
probably one of the heads of Greyhound Creek. We kept the ridge for 3 miles,
winding with it first west, then round to south, then west again. At the head
of this ridge we were practically on the DIVIDE [between the Pacific and Gulf
waters.&mdash;R. L. J.j, and a marked change took place both geologically and
botanically. The trees were almost all she-oaks. Thick clumps of ferns
(<i>Athyrium</i>) sometimes impeded our progress. The grass (<i>Spinifex</i>)
was very poor. The rock was granular quartzite, with a good deal of reef-quartz
scattered about.</p>
<p>We continued our journey for about 5 miles more <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> across ridgy country, on a general north-west course,
the gullies now falling to the west. We saw some outcrops of ferruginous
micaschist, with a good deal of red-tinged quartz. Layland and Hamil tried a
gully below some quartziferous ridges, but got no gold. On the western fall of
the range the grass gradually improved, and the she-oaks gave place to
stringybarks, woolybutts, bloodwood and apple-gum. We camped on a
third-magnitude creek running south-west, which I named HULL CREEK, after
Professor Edward Hull, <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> F.R.S., Director of the
Geological Survey of Ireland. (CAMP 28.)</p>
<p>We must have mounted about a thousand feet above the level of the sea, and
yet we had evidently crossed one of the lowest gaps in the range.</p>
<blockquote>[1) I must have exaggerated the distances, owing to the
difficulties.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Died 18th October, 1917.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 553}</u></p>
<p>January 22. There was some rain in the night, but the day was fine, warm and
breezy, and we got our things well dried. The day was spent chiefly in
horse-shoeing and prospecting. The prospectors were up the creek for about 3
miles, where it has less fall and the valley is wider than at the camp. The
country is of mica-schist, striking north and south, with numerous REEFS of
white granular quartz along the lines of bedding. No gold was obtained.</p>
<p>I crossed the creek, and went up a spur to a point on the hills bearing W.
14&deg; N. from the camp, and about 2 miles distant, and had a very extensive
view. The sea was visible through four distinct gaps in the MACROSSAN RANGE.
The following bearings, among others, were taken:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
From the sea through the "opening in the hills"
marked on coast chart (Hays Valley)                    W.  2&deg; N.

From north point of the hill marked "1,073" <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> in

From Camp 24 on Nisbet Creek                           W. 42&deg; N.

From Cape Weymouth                                     S. 7&frac12;&deg; W.

From steep grassy SW. end of a wooded hill,
1 mile off, with valley between                        W. 15&deg; N.

From end of left wall of Attack Valley                 N. 30&deg; E.

From View Hill, near Camp 13.                          N. 35&deg; E.
</pre>
<p>The sandstone cliffs of the GEIKIE RANGE could be traced northward to W.
5&deg; N. from the point of observation.</p>
<p>HULL CREEK could be seen emerging from the hills about 3 miles to the
south-west, and could be traced by a belt of scrub, bordered by open plains, to
its junction with the PEACH RIVER below the mouth of GEIKIE CREEK, about 25
miles WSW.</p>
<p>On returning from the hill, I accompanied Mr. Crosbie down HULL CREEK to see
if there was a practicable way for the horses out of the valley. The valley was
found to be extraordinarily steep and narrow, and there was evidently no
passage that way. The creek falls about 50 feet a quarter of a mile below the
camp, and then takes a sudden bend to the east. It was clear that we would have
to go by the hill from which I had come.</p>
<p>January 23. We left Camp 28 and ascended the spur to the point from which I
made the observations yesterday. Thence we sidled down the hill (a descent of
nearly 1,000 feet) to the south-west. We then crossed a fourth-magnitude creek
and touched the south-west end of the wooded hill bearing W. 15&deg; N. from
the hill we had left. From this point we struck west. In half a mile we crossed
a third- or fourth-magnitude creek. This and the creek last referred to join
about 2 miles to the south and fall into HULL CREEK in 1 mile further.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Not on the 1898 Chart.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 554}</u></p>
<p>At the foot of the hills the timber alters its character. The trees are
chiefly stringybark, bloodwood, box, woolybutt and apple-gum, with Moreton Bay
ash in alluvial flats.</p>
<p>We continued to the west for 2&frac12; miles up a gentle rise, well grassed,
to a low divide, whence a view was obtained of the MC!LWRAITH RANGE. Towards
the top of the rise, stringybark and box timber prevail: there were also a few
small ironbarks.</p>
<p>In 2 miles to W. 10&deg; N. a granite hill was passed about 2 miles off to
the left. Half a mile farther we passed close by a second granite hill on the
left. One mile to the north-west of this mountain we camped on the left bank of
a fourth-magnitude creek. [A tributary of the Batavia River.&mdash;R. L. J.]
(CAMP 29. Latitude, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> by observations of Capella
and Canopus, 13&deg; 11' S.) [The BATAVIA RIVER, which falls into the Gulf of
Carpentaria in lat. 12&deg; S., is not mentioned in the Journal of Jan
Carstenszoon, head of the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" expedition, in
1623. The name does not occur in his log, as given by Dr. Heeres, but the inlet
is located and named the Batavia in the "Chart made by the Chief Steersman,
Arend Martenszoon de Leeuw. who took part in the expedition."--R. L. J.]</p>
<p>From the base of the range to the camp, the country traversed was of
macro-crystalline reddish granite. No reef quartz was seen.</p>
<p>'January 24. We struck due north for 2 miles over ridges of coarse reddish
granite, decomposing to a soft soil, well grassed (no reef quartz). In
2&frac12; miles we crossed a third-magnitude creek running W. 30&deg; S. [The
BATAVIA RIVER. PLUTOVILLE, the centre of the "BATAVIA RUSH" of 1909, which
followed a DISCOVERY OF GOLD by an ABORIGINAL nicknamed "PLUTO," must be about
12 miles below my crossing.&mdash;R. L. J.] On crossing it I ascended a hill on
the right bank and took a series of bearings.</p>
<p>In 1 mile N. 25&deg; E. we crossed a spur of the hills on the right. From
this point onward the granite was grey, and finer in grain than that which we
had passed yesterday and to-day. Occasional outcrops of sandy ferruginous
greywacke were seen. Where these occurred, there was generally a good deal of
quartz.</p>
<p>We kept north for a mile and a half along the edge of the hills. The
prospectors tried several gullies here, but got no gold. A mile and a half to
the north, across a level valley (granite), we crossed a fourth-magnitude
creek. In half a mile further, past a spur of the range on the right, we
crossed a creek of the fourth magnitude, and camped on the right bank. The
prospectors tried</p>
<blockquote>[1) For some time back it had been impossible to fix the latitude,
as we rarely saw either sun or stars. This was, however, at the time, not of
much consequence, as we were near the coast, and could make out our position by
compass bearings. BAIRDSVILLE, where alluvial gold was discovered in 1892 by
William Baird, is about 7 miles west of my Camp 29. Baird was killed by the
blacks on the scene of his discovery in 1906.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 555}</u></p>
<p>this creek, but got no gold. (CAMP 30.) [A head of SEFTON CREEK.&mdash;R. L.
].]</p>
<p>In the afternoon I ascended the mountains north of the camp, and took the
bearings of a number of known positions to the south. The whole of this range
is of rocks which have not undergone extreme metamorphism. The commonest is a
sandy mica-schist, and a coarsely granular quartzite comes next. There are also
some sandy slate-rocks and some greywacke. QUARTZ REEFS are very numerous, but
the quartz is not of a promising character. Teatree and she-oak are the
commonest trees on the ridges. The highest hills of the range (seen across a
valley to the north) are almost bare of timber.</p>
<p>January 25. Shoeing horses, etc. In the afternoon Crosbie and I ascended the
bare hills north of the camp, and at a point 3 miles to the east had a view of
CAPE WEYMOUTH, LLOYD BAY and the MACROSSAN RANGE. We saw also to the north a
wide, heathy flat (which afterwards proved to be the valley of the PASCOE)
dividing the MC!LWRAITH RANGE from a range to the north. [The JANET
RANGE.&mdash;R. L. J.] Here we saw for the first time the pitcher plant
(<i>Nepenthes Kennedya</i>), which afterwards became very familiar.</p>
<p>There was heavy rain in the afternoon, with showers at night.</p>
<p>January 26. A dull, showery day. We left Camp 30, and after skirting the
range for 3 miles west, crossed a third-magnitude creek running south-west. In
half a mile more we recrossed the same creek, here running north-north-east,
and a good deal larger than at the upper crossing, having probably received the
creek we left in the morning. In half a mile to the north-west, on a grassy
plot with Moreton Bay ash and box timber, we came on tent-poles and ridges for
eight tents, more than one season old, supposed to be the camp of ROBERT SEFTON
and his party when they left the Coen rush in April, 1878. Here we crossed the
creek again. It flows through a gap in green hills to the west. I named it
SEFTON CREEK. From subsequent correspondence with Mr. Sefton, Mr. Crosbie
ascertained that the former believed it to join the river to the south (the
Peach). [It joins the BAT AVI A RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>We ran to the north for 3 miles up a valley in gently undulating,
well-grassed country, lightly timbered with white gum, Moreton Bay ash and box.
A small water-course, a tributary of Sefton Creek, lay to the left of our
course. A range of green hills, with alternate scrubby and bare patches, formed
the right or western wall of the valley. The bottom of the valley was of grey
granite.</p>
<p>At the head of the valley we crossed a low divide (ferruginous greywacke and
mica-schist, with much white quartz), with grasstree (<i>Xanthorrhaea</i>),
stringybark and bloodwood. [This was the DIVIDE BETWEEN THE PACIFIC AND GuLF
WATERS.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 556}</u></p>
<p>We continued our course to the north through granite country similar to that
on the south side of the divide, but rather more closely timbered. A large
NATIVE CAMP, which had been deserted for about a fortnight, was passed. At the
end of the 4 miles I got on a granite "tor," and saw clear, low country for a
long distance towards CAPE WEYMOUTH.</p>
<p>We struck out in the direction of the Cape (north-east), as I had arranged,
through the kindness of Mr. B. FAHEY, Sub-Collector at Cooktown, to CALL THERE
AND LEAVE LETTERS to be picked up by the Customs cutter on her way to the
lighthouses between Torres Strait and Cooktown. In a mile and a half, through
very poor country, we came to a fourth-magnitude creek flowing to the
north-north-east (a tributary of the PASCOE) in deep soil with very steep and
treacherous banks. There was only one possible crossing. The horse I rode
("Poodle") stumbled and fell, and I had to jump off into a deep pool. The
saddle-pouch in which I carried maps, note-book, etc., was filled with water.
We camped on the right bank. (CAMP 31.) This camp was a very poor one for the
horses: spinifex grass, myall wood and teatree. There were showers during the
night.</p>
<p>January 27. One of Crosbie's HORSES had got POISONED overnight, and when
found in the morning was streaming with perspiration and staggering. It managed
to do that day's journey, however, but was very ill at night cold and unable to
stand.</p>
<p>This was a dull, threatening day, with one very heavy shower. We travelled
for a mile and a half to N. 33&deg; E. over level country with a bottom of fine
white sand, with heath and stunted bushes.</p>
<p>In one mile and a half more to N. 33&deg; E., through dense brushwood SCRUB,
we crossed from the left to the right bank of a deep third-magnitude creek,
running north-west [a branch of the Pascoe River.&mdash;R. L. J.]. The fine
white sandy bottom extended to here. For the rest of the day we traversed
gently undulating country (rising on the whole) with a granitic soil.</p>
<p>Five miles further we crossed a gully, running to the west, with vine and
bamboo scrub. In a mile and a half more we crossed a similar gully and camped.
(CAMP 32.) [Heads of the PASCOE RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>After we had camped, I crossed another scrubby gully and ascended the hills
to the north. The hills were of granite, weathering so as to show in relief
large crystals of orthoclase felspar, quartz in round grains, and black mica. A
good deal of REEF-QUARTZ was lying about. The tops of the hills were SCRUBBY,
and I could only get a view in glimpses from some of the barer spurs. The
northmost peak in the MACROSSAN RANGE bore E. 28&deg; S.; CAPE DIRECTION, E.
2&deg; N.; and the south end of HIGH ISLAND in LLOYD BAY, E. 30&deg; N. I
touched a STINGING TREE with one finger of the left hand in pushing through the
scrub. The pain</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 557}</u></p>
<p>mounted in about twenty minutes to the armpit, and I had intense pain for
three days and could not sleep at night. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>Another of the prospectors' HORSES took violently ill at this camp, with
every symptom of POISONING.</p>
<p>January 28. Heavy rain began about three in the morning, and continued to
fall till midday. The sky cleared somewhat in the afternoon, and I accompanied
Messrs. Crosbie, Hume and Layland to the DIVIDE, which lay about 2 miles to the
east of our camp. At one point we could see HIGH ISLAND, and the sea looked
only 4 or 5 miles distant. The western slope, up to the very divide, is easy
and lightly timbered (chiefly with oaks), but the eastern slope is a steep
escarpment clothed with dense SCRUB. We skirted the escarpment for about 2
miles to the south, and tried to get down in several places, but could neither
see nor get down. We also ran it north till it abutted against the range north
of our camp, which is densely scrubby, except on the spur by which I ascended
yesterday. With one consent we ABANDONED THE ATTEMPT TO REACH CAPE WEYMOUTH,
which could only have been done at a ruinous expense of horseflesh.</p>
<p>The night was fine, but too cloudy for observations of the stars. [I
conjecture, from Carron's narrative, that KENNEDY'S PARTY, after a day's
comparative easy travelling (30th October, 1848) down the Lockhart valley,
failed in the attempt to follow the coast-line of Lloyd Bay northward and went
up the valley of the "small river" (3rd November, 1848) now shown in the Lands
Department maps as falling into the bay east of my 32n camp, and thence crossed
to the Pascoe valley near its mouth.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>January 29. One of the prospectors' horses being still too weak to travel,
we did not move the camp. Crosbie, Hume and I visited the hills to the
north-west, to see what sort of "get-away" there might be in that direction.
(Granite country, with some REEFS of white quartz, with long interlacing
dog-tooth crystals.) We found ourselves looking into the valley of a large
stream running from north to south. On crossing to this stream we found it to
be a deep and rapid third-magnitude creek, with a fringe of bamboo, palm and
vine scrub. The creek, which we afterwards knew as the main head of the PASCOE
RIVER, takes its rise in a range of rugged mountains which occupy the space
from Weymouth Bay to the south end of Lloyd Bay. This mountain mass I named the
JANET RANGE, after my wife.</p>
<p>The creek was flooded, and, where we struck it, was too deep for the
pack-bags to be carried across by the horses without injury</p>
<blockquote>[1) I applied the name "MACROSSAN RANGE" to the whole range between
the LOCKHART RIVER and the Pacific. Parts of it have, however, since been named
the "Adam," "Meston," "Chester," "High" and "Heming" Ranges. They must rank as
"Peaks," "Mounts" or "Heights" forming part of the Macrossan Range. See note,
p. 548.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 558}</u></p>
<p>to their contents. We had made up our minds to unload, and carry the packs
and saddles across on our heads, but we afterwards found a shallower crossing,
to which we cut a track through the scrub. We also blazed a way back to the
camp (E. 15&deg; N., 3 miles).</p>
<p>On our return, the HORSE which last took ill was found DEAD. The stomach and
bowels were found to be much inflamed, the former containing grassy pulp mixed
with blood.</p>
<p>Macdonald prospected in the creek at the camp, but got no gold.</p>
<p>January 30. On leaving Camp 32, the HORSE which had been poisoned at the
previous camp seemed in a dying condition, but it was driven on, on the chance
that it might recover. It was quite crazed, its JAWS firmly LOCKED, with the
mouth askew, and its tongue swollen so that it could eat nothing. It recovered,
but was of no use for the rest of the journey.</p>
<p>When we reached the creek to which we had cut a track yesterday, the flood
had abated considerably, but the crossing was still a matter of some
difficulty.</p>
<p>Two miles to the south-west through stony granite country (without quartz
reefs), we crossed the heads of some gullies, which flowed to the north-east to
join the creek we had crossed. Three miles further to the west we camped (on
the site of a NATIVE ENCAMPMENT) in good grassy country, by the left bank of a
gully falling to the west.</p>
<p>The day was fine, with only one shower. The night was fine but cloudy. (CAMP
33. Latitude, by observation of Canopus, 12&deg; 55' S.)</p>
<p>January 31. Leaving Camp 33, we travelled westward over granite ridges, with
large boulders (no quartz reefs). High granite hills lay to the right, about 2
miles distant. In a mile and a half we crossed a large fourth-magnitude creek,
running south-southwest, with a very rocky (granite) bottom.</p>
<p>Two and a half miles further to the west, towards what appeared to be an
opening for the stream in the valley to the low country in the west, we came
unexpectedly on the right bank of the stream, which had now become a creek of
the first magnitude, or almost a river [PASCOE RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.], and was
in high flood, and running swiftly over a rocky bed of granite, and quite
impassable. We were in doubt as to whether this creek flowed into the Pacific
or the Gulf, and as that question would have to be settled before we could
determine whether or not we should cross (which would have been difficult and
dangerous) we struck north.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half we were on a granite hill on the right wall of the
valley, and enjoyed a magnificent view. The river was seen for some miles of
its course, tumbling to the north-north-west, with many waterfalls. The bottom
was either bare granite or choked with teatrees. On both banks the higher
granite hills were capped by outliers of the horizontal sandstone which covered
the whole of the country to the west. The granite range to the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 559}</u></p>
<p>east rises to much, greater altitudes than the sandstone, and must have been
dry land when the latter was deposited.</p>
<p>In 2&frac12; miles to the north we crossed two forks of a rocky
fourthmagnitude creek running to the south-south-west. In a mile and a half
more we recrossed the western fork and camped. (CAMP 34.)</p>
<p>The day was fine, with only two showers.</p>
<p>February 1. Dull and heavy. Rain, most of the time we were travelling, added
to the discomforts of an otherwise troublesome enough day.</p>
<p>We travelled north-north-east for 2 miles over very rough, stony, granite
hills, most of the time ascending, till we found a third-magnitude creek [CANOE
CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.] in a narrow gorge, tumbling impetuously to the west, and
quite impassable. The creek seemed to rise among the highest summits of the
JANET RANGE, and these looked too formidable. We turned, and made for the low
country down the valley, of which we could sometimes catch a glimpse to the
north-west.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half to the west, along the crown of the left wall of the
valley&mdash;descending for about 1,000 feet&mdash;over very rocky (granite)
and partly scrubby country, we came down into the valley, near the mouth of a
fourth-magnitude creek coming from the south, and draining a very deep valley.
After much search (Crosbie and Layland swimming) we found a passable crossing
of the thirdmagnitude creek [CANOE CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.] about a quarter of a
mile below the mouth of the tributary.</p>
<p>Half a mile to the north-west we cleared a mountain of gneissose granite,
which terminated the right wall of the constricted part of the valley, and the
country lay before us pretty open to the north. In 1 mile to the north we
camped on the right bank of the creek, which was afterwards named CANOE CREEK.
(CAMP 35. Latitude, by observation of Canopus, 12&deg; 49' 30" S.)</p>
<p>After we had camped, I went on to the hills forming the right wall of the
valley, about a mile to the north of the camp, and saw clear open country to N.
10&deg; W. down the valley. Cliffs of HORIZONTAL SANDSTONE were seen to the
west, stretching in everreceding promontories to the south-west toward the
GEIKIE RANGE, with which they are probably connected. Down the valley of Canoe
Creek was a long stretch of low heathy country. In about 5 miles the valley was
joined by another, extending east and west, but I was unable to make out
whether it had its outlet to the south-east or north-west, the promontories of
the JANET RANGE shutting out the view.</p>
<p>Rain most of the night.</p>
<p>February 2. A wet day, and every sign of a week's rain. Considering this
prospect, the flooded state of the creeks, and the boggy nature of the country
ahead, and, moreover, that one of the prospectors' horses was too lame to
travel, having been staked in</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 560}</u></p>
<p>the knee the day we passed Sefton Creek, we busied ourselves in making
ourselves as comfortable as we could in WET-SEASON QUARTERS. Crosbie's party
put up a bark shed to keep their fire in. We put up an old fly for the fire,
and a fly with a table and seats for meals and drawing.</p>
<p>Hume and Hamil, prospecting in beaches on the creek, could get no gold.</p>
<p>Crosbie and I crossed the creek by a teatree, which we were fortunate enough
to find bridging it, and made for a hill on its left bank about 2 miles down,
whence we hoped to get a view to the north-east. We were disappointed, for we
had barely reached the foot of the hill when rain and fog suddenly obscured
everything, and we had to return to the camp. The country on the left bank of
CANOE CREEK was composed of sandstone and conglomerate cement, affording fairly
sound travelling, but covered with HEATH and brushwood SCRUB, through which
horses could only be driven with much difficulty.</p>
<p>Rain all night.</p>
<p>February 3. Heavy rain in the morning. The rest of the day dull and showery.
Drizzling all night.</p>
<p>I went out towards the hill we attempted to visit yesterday, but found the
teatree bridging the creek at least 4 feet under water.</p>
<p>February 4. There was not much rain to-day. In the afternoon, Crosbie, Hume
and I went to the hill on the left bank, the teatree bridge being again
practicable. We saw CANOE CREEK going north for 5 or 6 miles from the hill. A
SANDSTONE TABLELAND lay to the west and north-west, and there was an outlier of
sandstone on the right side of the valley. High granite mountains QANET RANGE)
to the east. The valley was a barren heathy flat, and apparently had its outlet
to the north-east.</p>
<p>February 5. Macdonald and I crossed CANOE CREEK, where we had crossed with
the horses on 31st January, and found the water only about 6 inches higher than
on that occasion. My intention was to penetrate to the west for some distance,
and see what had become of the river we had left on the 30th [the PASCOE
RIVER]. We had hardly got half a mile from Canoe Creek when a perfect deluge of
rain began. After waiting for some time we had to return to the camp, as there
was no sign of improvement; the ground was becoming boggy and the ford would
soon be impassable. The rain continued all day, and got very heavy again at
nightfall. In the afternoon the creek was as high as it had been since we
camped here. The ground was now so soft that it would take three or four dry
days before it could be fit for horses.</p>
<p>February 6. A fine day, occasionally cloudy. The sun very warm.</p>
<p>I went over the hill-tops east of the camp (fine-grained granite) and made
out that the river between Camps 33 and 34 [the PASCOE.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 561}</u></p>
<p>must breach the sandstone range not further north than a gap which lay about
12 miles off to S. 15&deg; W.</p>
<p>To the west the country is for the most part sandstone tableland, sloping
almost insensibly to the west, but presenting steep escarpments, which mark the
outcrop of thick beds, to the east. The edge of a high tableland (which I named
the WILKINSON RANGE, in honour of the Government Geologist for New South Wales)
[C. S. Wilkinson, since deceased.&mdash;R. L. J.], about 25 miles off,
subtended an angle of from W. 10&deg; N. to W. 10&deg; S. The eastern
escarpment of this range must lie about 142&deg; 33' E. longitude, and 12 or 15
miles east of Messrs. Jardines' <i>route</i> northward in 1865; although the
Messrs. Jardine saw nothing approaching the character of a hill till 40 miles
further north. This is easily explained by the fact that they kept on the
western slope of the range, which corresponds with the almost insensible dip of
the strata. [The escarpment named the Wilkinson Range now appears to be that
west of the telegraph line, constructed in 1887, between the Batavia River and
Cox Creek.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>I could see lower sandstone country, dead flat or apparently so, to the
north and south of the Wilkinson Range for about 15 miles.</p>
<p>Down the valley of CANOE CREEK two mountains were seen in a line due north,
one about 6 and the other about 15 miles off. Immediately to the north of the
former the ground falls away to the east, and the creek must go that way, as
there is no other possible outlet for it.</p>
<p>Between the north-west of the two hills and the eastern end of a high, rough
sandstone escarpment about 3 miles further off, and bearing N. 7&deg; W., is
flat, LOW SANDSTONE COUNTRY, extending eastward to the base of the mountains at
FAIR CAPE.</p>
<p>The night was threatening, but there was no rain.</p>
<p>February 7. This was a fine, warm day. The flood having fallen considerably,
we left Camp 35 and crossed to the left bank of CANOE CREEK and continued our
course down the valley to the north. In 3 miles of travelling we passed the
hill to which we had advanced on the 4th. In a mile and a half more, over
dead-flat sandy country timbered with bloodwood, stringybark, and pandanus, we
reached a fourth-magnitude creek running east into Canoe Creek. Here one of my
old pack-horses ("Jimmy"), which had previously bogged in a gully and had to be
unpacked, tumbled back from the bank into the creek and filled the bags
containing my books, maps, instruments and clothes with water. A spur of the
sandstone-capped range on the west comes down to Canoe Creek here (gneiss,
porphyry and slate, with much quartz; the strike of the slates NE. and SW.).
The prospectors tried some gullies, but got no gold.</p>
<p>In half a mile "Jimmy" tripped over a sapling and tumbled over into a gully.
We unpacked him for the third time, and did</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 562}</u></p>
<p>all we could to raise him. We got him on his forelegs twice, but he seemed
incapable of standing on his hind legs. We had to leave him and put his packs
on another horse.</p>
<p>In 2 miles more to the north, over scrubby and heathy "cement" country, we
again touched the left bank of CANOE CREEK. Here coarse white, gritty sandstone
was seen, resting horizontally on vertical conglomeratic slates, which have a
north-east and southwest strike. On the right bank was a cliff, 50 or 60 feet
high, of thin-bedded reddish horizontal sandstones.</p>
<p>We followed the course of the creek for 2 miles to the north-west till we
found it falling into a broad, deep, rapid, flooded river coming from the west.
This must be the same river which had already puzzled us so much. There can be
now no doubt that it is the river, falling into Weymouth Bay, named the PASCOE
by the unfortunate Kennedy. [This was my mistake. The river was named in honour
of Lieutenant Pascoe, who was in command of the detachment of marines which
arrived at Somerset on 25th March, 1863.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>We camped on the point between the Pascoe and Canoe Creek. (CAMP 36.
Latitude, by observation of Canopus, 12&deg; 41' S.) [The present "BOWDEN
MINERAL FIELD" (wolfram, molybdenite and tin) occupies the peninsula between
Canoe Creek and the Pascoe River.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>February 8. Macdonald, Charlie and I went back with a draught horse to do
what we could for "Jimmy." We found him alive and groaning. He had struggled
about his own length up the gully. We laboured with levers and the draught
horse for an hour or more, but could not get him to his feet. We then SHOT HIM.
He was an old friend, and "I could have better spared a better horse." We cut
off his shoes and took away about 80 lb. of meat, the last of our beef having
been boiled in the morning and game having become very scarce. All hands were
busy till nightfall cutting up and curing the meat&mdash;mostly with pepper,
for we had not much salt. We enjoyed the luxury of fresh meat. The "steaks"
tasted well, but were dreadfully tough.</p>
<p>The prospectors had found a hollow tree, and were busy making a BOAT of it,
splitting rails for the ends, etc. Crosbie had been looking out for a crossing
for the horses up the river, but found none practicable.</p>
<p>February 9. In the morning I pasted and touched up the maps damaged by water
on the 6th. The day was very warm, with only one shower in the afternoon. In
the afternoon I measured the river (trigonometrically), and found it 70 yards
wide. The horseflesh was drying in the sun. Crosbie and Charlie crossed Canoe
Creek, and went down the Pascoe for some miles to the north-east.</p>
<p>The BOAT was launched in the afternoon, but was found to leak a good
deal.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 563}</u></p>
<p>February 10. The boat on her trial trip got somewhat injured, and it took
till dinner-time to caulk her with clay, and cover her with canvas pack-covers.
She was then launched, and Crosbie, Layland and Hamil crossed the river to cut
the SCRUB at the landing. Hume and I went up the river to look for a crossing,
being of one mind in caring little for boating. I stripped and tried for fords
in several places, but was carried off my feet every time. At last I ran a near
chance of drowning, being thoroughly exhausted before regaining the bank above
a reach of dangerous rapids. We gave up the attempt and reconciled ourselves to
the boat.</p>
<p>After dinner we got the horses ACROSS CANOE CREEK, which was fordable, and
swam them across THE PASCOE. Macdonald and Charlie rode across on "Brownie" and
"Moonlight." It was very hard to get some of the horses to face Canoe Creek,
"Coen" and "Greyhound" getting quite mad and breaking away into the bush. All
swam the river in gallant style.</p>
<p>The river began to rise while we were getting the horses across, and had
risen 6 inches before we had done. It fell again 7 inches before nightfall.</p>
<p>A few heavy showers fell in the night, but did not last long enough to raise
the river.</p>
<p>February 11. The great "work of getting our loads across the river was
accomplished to-day. We carried the prospectors' things down, and in return
Crosbie and Hamil ferried us and our baggage across. The river and creek were
rising steadily all the time, and had risen 3 feet by two o'clock, when the
last of our things were landed. The ferrying of the last two boat-loads was a
very severe struggle, the force of the current having increased very much with
the rise in the water. Carrying the loads down (about 150 yards) and packing
them up the bank on the north side was hard work, the day being very sultry. In
the afternoon thunderclouds gathered and a few light showers fell.</p>
<p>We camped on the left bank of the Pascoe. (CAMP 37.)</p>

<h5>(SEE MAP B.)</h5>
<p>OUR camp (37) was probably about 15 miles higher up the river than the place
where the unfortunate explorer KENNEDY left the remainder of his party when he
set out, accompanied by his black boy, Jackey-Jackey, and three others, who
perished, to meet his fate at the Escape River, almost within sight of the ship
which was to bring him relief. The hills at FAIR CAPE were doubtless the last
objects that met the eyes of Carron and his companions, as one by one they
sickened and died while waiting for the relief which was to come too late for
all but two of their number. Up the left bank of the river for about 2 miles
the country is of the poorest imaginable description. It is a "cement" of
decomposed sandstone, intersected by gullies, and clothed with HEATH and small
BRUSHWOOD. There is not a blade of grass.</p>
<p>My hands are in a pitiful condition, being lacerated by the scrub, which
seems to be capable of BLOOD-POISONING. They are so painful that I can hardly
sleep at nights, and the flies torment me in the daytime.</p>
<p>February 12. This was a very warm day. We were prepared</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 565}</u></p>
<p>to make a start, but five of the horses were missing, and were not found
till the afternoon. They had left our camp, where the only grass was, and
strayed into wretched brushwood country. One of the prospectors' horses had got
staked in the knee, and had to be operated on. There was one shower in the
afternoon; the night was fine.</p>
<p>February 13. Left Camp 37, and in 1 mile to the north-north-east ("cement"
and HEATH) reached the edge of a high SANDSTONE TABLELAND. For the next 5 miles
to the north we kept on the edge of the tableland, looking down into the valley
of the PASCOE, with the JANET RANGE beyond. The sandstone tableland (to which I
gave the name of the SIR WILLIAM THOMSON RANGE) had a red soil, and was
timbered with stringybark, bloodwood, Xanthorrhoea and pandanus. This tableland
extends from the valley of the Pascoe in longitude 143&deg; 3' E. and latitude
12&deg; 40' S., north-north-eastward to the 12th parallel, and presents a steep
escarpment to the Pacific and a long gradual slope towards the Gulf. [It would
be more accurately described as a "shelf" than as a "range."&mdash;R. L.
J.]</p>
<p>At the end of the 5 miles we descended about 500 feet from the tableland
(half a mile east) to a lower shelf of sandstone. The strata on the tableland
are reddish and cemented with iron. The beds on the lower shelf are yellow and
white&mdash;all gritty and some containing a few pebbles.</p>
<p>In a mile east-north-east we reached a fourth-magnitude creek in a deep
valley. We ran it up for half a mile west-north-west, and crossed. In half a
mile more to the north, across a heathy ridge, we crossed another branch of the
same creek.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half to the north, across the chord of a bay in the SIR
WILLIAM THOMSON RANGE, we camped on a gully near a promontory of the range. The
vegetation was similar to that on the top of the tableland, with the addition
of a few ironbarks and myallwood trees. (CAMP 38.) There was a thunderstorm at
night and no observation was possible.</p>
<p>February 14. A sultry, oppressive day. We travelled 2 miles to the north,
over open sandstone country timbered with stringybark, bloodwood, grasstree,
and pandanus, sloping to the east&mdash;the cliffs of the Sir William Thomson
Range visible about a mile to the west.</p>
<p>Our course next lay 10&deg; E. down the right wall of the deep valley of a
fourth-magnitude creek. There was flat sandstone country on both sides of the
creek, occasionally open, but for the most part covered with HEATH. On the
creek turning nearly due east, we crossed to the left bank. It was running
briskly.</p>
<p>Half a mile more on the same course, across burnt HEATH, we crossed another
fourth-magnitude creek. The two creeks join about a mile down and fall into the
Pascoe.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 566}</u></p>
<p>A mile and a half to the north, through strong HEATH, we reached a gully in
cement. One of the old pack-horses ("Queensland") got bogged in the gully and
had fairly to be dug out with spades. We came back to the right bank (heading
the gully this time), and ran the gully down for a mile to the south-south-east
to its junction with a deep and rapid creek of the third magnitude. Having
found a practicable crossing of the latter, we camped on the right bank. (CAMP
39. Latitude, by observation of Canopus, 12&deg; 34' S.) [HANN CREEK.&mdash;R.
L. ].]</p>
<p>February 15. This was a sultry day. Leaving Camp 39, we touched, in a mile
and a half to the north, some low hills of porphyry and hardened slate, from
which the sandstone had been denuded. Here we had a view (to the north-east) of
the serrated mountains between the mouth of the Pascoe and Temple Bay, which I
named the CARRON RANGE, in commemoration of the tragic circumstances connected
with W. Carron's stay, when Kennedy left him on his last forlorn expedition in
1848.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">[Carron's narrative is the only record of the
expedition extant. He was the Botanist of the party. After a careful perusal of
his story, which was first published by Kemp and Fairfax, Sydney, in 1849, and
which was reprinted (with a few omissions) in <i>The Voyage of H.M.S.
"Rattlesnake,"</i> by John MacGillivray, F.R.G.S., T. &amp; W. Boone, London,
1852, together with Jackey-Jackey's Statement, I have come to the conclusion
that in all probability Kennedy led his party northward near the shore of
Princess Charlotte Bay, up the valley of the Nisbet River through the
McIlwraith and Janet Ranges to the mouth of the Pascoe. It must be remembered,
however, that Carron, who probably had no chart, did not keep the diary of the
expedition, though he kept a private diary, and was sufficiently employed in
his botanical studies, and wrote his story after months of privation, sickness
and utter hopelessness, during which he saw the death of all his companions but
one. His narrative is, therefore, not of much geographical value, and we are
forced to conjecture what an intelligent leader who did not live to tell his
own tale would be most likely to do. Captain Cook named Cape Weymouth and
Weymouth Bay (into which the Pascoe River discharges) on 17th August, 1770.
Kennedy had a sextant, and must have had a chronometer, or at least a very
reliable watch, as his latitudes and longitudes (which he fortunately appears
to have, in some cases, communicated to Carron) are quite as accurate as could
be expected in the circumstances.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p>The timber on the porphyry and slate differed in character from that on the
sandstone. Moreton Bay ash, ironbark, and white gum took the place of
stringybark, bloodwood, grasstree and pandanus.</p>
<p>In half a mile more to the north a boggy flat was crossed, and the sandstone
recommenced, at a lower level than the porphyry, and also (in hills on the
left) at a higher, showing that the appearance of the porphyry and slates was
the result of denudation.</p>
<p>A mile and a half further (HEATH AND BRUSHWOOD) the bottom of the sandstone
again appeared, this time resting on granite. Two miles from the granite we
crossed a HEATHY SWAMP. In 2&frac12; miles further, through HEATHY COUNTRY, we
came on a flooded</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 567}</u></p>
<p>creek of the fourth magnitude, draining the western side of the CARRON
RANGE. After running this creek down for 2 miles to the north, we crossed to
its right bank, and altered our course to N. 15&deg; E. to strike the
south-west angle of TEMPLE BAY, having made arrangements through Mr. B. Fahey
[then Sub-Collector of Customs at Cooktown.&mdash;R. L. J.] to communicate from
the "remarkable red cliffs" with the keeper of the PIPER ISLAND LIGHTSHIP.</p>
<p>After 4 miles of white sandy soil, with stringybark, applegum, bloodwood,
grasstree and pandanus, we reached a SANDSTONE ESCARPMENT facing east and made
a descent of about 200 feet over edges of horizontal strata of gritty and
pebbly sandstone. We camped in a fine grassy bottom among GIGANTIC IRONBARK
TREES. Several EMUS were seen, but we failed to shoot any. (CAMP 40. Latitude,
by observation of Canopus, 12&deg; 23' S.) From a hill behind the camp, which
Crosbie and I ascended, we saw the PIPER ISLAND LIGHTSHIP, bearing E. 38&deg;
N.; HAGGERSTONE ISLAND, bearing N. 33&deg; E.; and BOLT HEAD, bearing N. 8&deg;
E.</p>
<p>[KENNEDY, with JACKEY-JACKEY, COSTIGAN, DUNN and LUFF, on their forlorn
march towards Cape York, probably passed the site of my Camp 40 about 16th
November, 1848.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>February 16. Leaving Camp 40, we ran down the right bank of the gully for 1
mile (N. 15&deg; E.) and crossed. For the rest of the day we kept nearly
parallel to the coast-line, which here trends north and south. On the left bank
of the gully we crossed a porphyry spur of the sandstone-capped hills, and had
a view of the PIPER, FORBES, QUOIN and HAGGERSTONE ISLANDS, and CAPE GRENVILLE.
A mile and a half from the gully (by the edge of a low sandstone rise, fairly
well grassed) we crossed a fourth-magnitude creek, flanked by chains of lagoons
(probably the creek we crossed yesterday). On its banks were heaps of
sea-shells, and extensive remains of old NATIVE CAMPS. [This creek, according
to the 4-mile Lands map, falls into a larger water-course named GLENNIE CREEK,
which shortly afterwards falls into Temple Bay.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>In 3 miles more, partly on the edge of coast flats (sandy, with teatree and
sandalwood scrub, etc.), and partly on the edge of the sandstone rise (red soil
country, well grassed), we camped on the right bank of an insignificant gully.
(CAMP 41.)</p>
<p>From a point near this camp the LIGHTSHIP bore E. 27&deg; N.</p>
<p>After we had settled the camp, Crosbie and I went ahead to see whether it
was possible to reach the "REMARKABLE RED CLIFF" by the coast.</p>
<p>In 1 mile, by low SANDHILLS, we crossed the mouth of a fourth-magnitude
creek. North of the creek was a low promontory of brown sandstone, 10 feet
high, under 20 feet of red cement.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half of low SANDHILLS we crossed the mouth of a third- or
fourth-magnitude creek, with some NATIVE HUTS constructed</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 568}</u></p>
<p>of bark on forks. One of them had two sheets of COPPER SHEATHING on its
roof.</p>
<p>A mile and a half further, with low SANDHILLS to the left, we reached a bare
headland of horizontal sandstone, resting on serpentine, about 100 feet in
height. On rounding the headland we found the WRECK of a large copper-sheathed
brig, with its cargo of cedar logs strewn along the beach. Most of the logs
were branded "L" and some "DH." As the crew of the lightship had never heard of
the wreck, we imagined that it must have taken place before the lightship was
anchored in its present position, which commands a view of the whole bay. On
our return to Cooktown we reported the wreck, and MR. B. FAHEY visited it, and
identified the ship as the "KATE CONNOLLY," which left Cairns for Sydney in
March, 1878, and was never heard of again. The MEMORABLE STORM of the 8th of
that month, when CAIRNS was PARTLY DESTROYED, sufficiently accounted for the
disappearance of the vessel, but its fate had remained a mystery till we
accidentally discovered the wreck. The Captain, it is believed, intended to go
outside the Barrier Reef by the Trinity Opening. The ship was probably drifted
in dark weather (otherwise it must have been seen from the lightship) to its
last resting-place. The crew (seven or eight in number) in all probability
perished at sea. Had they landed in Temple Bay they must have met a horrible
fate at the hands of the blacks. We saw no trace of the habitations of white
men. [A copy of Mr. Fancy's Diary is in my possession.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>Half a mile beyond the wreck we reached BOLT HEAD, a bare promontory which
presents a cliff of about a hundred feet in height to the sea for half a mile.
At the top of the cliffs were about 30 feet of horizontal reddish sandstone
resting unconformably on a blue LIMESTONE with a quasi-schistose structure. The
limestone was at least 100 feet in thickness, and had a dip to the east at 45
degrees. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>For the next mile, through well-grassed country, partly scrubby,</p>
<blockquote>[1) Bolt Head was sighted and named by Captain Cook on 18th August,
1770. He named Temple Bay and Cape Grenville on the day following. It is more
than likely, however, that what now appears on the Admiralty Chart as "Bolt
Head" (in Temple Bay, 12&deg; 15' S.) is not the promontory to which he gave
the name. The "high point that we called Bolt Head, from which the land bears
more westerly" appears to be fairly descriptive of what is now charted as
"Mosquito Point," 12&deg; 20' S. After leaving "Cooktown," in his repaired
ship, the "<i>Endeavour</i>," Captain Cook attempted the passage inside the
Barrier Reef, landing at Point Lookout, but in three days was convinced that
safety lay in getting outside of the "shoals." He cleared the reef to the north
of the Lizard Island on 13th August. On the 15th he again steered west, that he
"might be sure not to over-shoot the passage, if a passage there was, between
this land and New Guinea." The following day he came on the Barrier Reef again,
and, as if by miracle, was drifted through what he called "Providential
Opening" into the smooth water between the Reef and the Mainland. The passage
between New Guinea and Cook's "New South Wales" (Australia) had already been
made by Torres, the Commander of one of the ships of Quiros' Spanish expedition
in September, 1606, but this fact was either not known to Cook, or was doubted
by him. It appears to have been equally unknown to, or ignored by, the
authorities of the Dutch East India Company, as shown by their instructions to
leaders of explorations in and after 1623.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 569}</u></p>
<p>we saw numerous HOOP PINES. Then we crossed the mouths of two creeks of the
fourth magnitude, and reached a bald red cliff of sandstone. This we ascended,
and saw the "Remarkable Red Cliff" (of the chart) still about a mile and a half
ahead, but quite accessible. We made a SMOKE on the headland to apprise the
master of the lightship that we were in the neighbourhood. We returned to the
camp at nightfall and found Macdonald again ill with fever.</p>
<p>February 17. MACDONALD was still VERY ILL. We left Camp 41 and travelled
north by the <i>route</i> described under yesterday's date. Just as we arrived
at the point where we had turned back yesterday, the prospectors, who were
about half a mile ahead, saw and gave chase to some "niggers." When I got up I
found that they had rounded up TWO GINS and some CHILDREN. The gins had wavy,
but not curly, hair. They dropped a three-pronged FISHING-SPEAR barbed with
SAIL NEEDLES, and a FIGHTING OR HUNTING-SPEAR with a bone barb.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more we reached the "REMARKABLE RED CLIFF" (of the
chart) and camped above it on a bald rise, having a patch of SCRUB on the edge
of the cliff and more scrub behind. (CAMP 42.) Firewood and water had to be
carried a long way, but we wished to camp where our tents would be visible from
the ship when lighted up by the morning sun.</p>
<p>Four or five BLACKS made their appearance after we had camped, and held up
something white in their hands; but they vanished on seeing Hume pick up his
rifle.</p>
<p>It appears that the men on the ship saw our tents as soon as they were
pitched, but, of course, we did not know this. When night fell we made a big
fire on the top of the cliff. In less than an hour we were answered by a ROCKET
from the lightship.</p>
<p>February 18. This was a warm day with a few thunder-showers. At daybreak we
saw a boat making for us. The MASTER OF THE LIGHTSHIP (Mr. Tyrell) and two men
reached the bay below our camp at half-past seven. As only one man was left in
the ship they could only stay till half-past ten. They brought us twelve pounds
of tinned BEEF and a pile of NEWSPAPERS and some LETTERS&mdash;all very
acceptable. They had never been ashore, it appeared. They informed us that the
BLACKS had recently SPEARED A MAN in his ship in the bay. I sent off a short
"PRELIMINARY REPORT" to you.</p>
<p>In the afternoon seven BLACKS came up and parleyed outside the camp. Two
acted as spokesmen, while the rest stayed behind. They spoke English at least
as well as the average Cleveland Bay blacks. They had wavy, but not curly,
hair. They brought a bit of turtle-shell and silver bream. Charlie gave them a
bit of his tobacco, with the use of which they seemed familiar. They offered to
exchange fish for tobacco, and we gladly accepted the offer, but warned them to
come without their spears and only two at a time. They spoke of being familiar
with <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> fishers.</p>

<h4>ON THE PROGRESS OF THE GOLD-PROSPECTING EXPEDITION IN CAPE YORK
PENINSULA</h4>
<h4>FIRST PRELIMINARY REPORT</h4>
<p>WE arrived last night at the "REMARKABLE RED CLIFFS," noted on the coast
chart opposite the PIPER ISLAND LIGHTSHIP, and a boat has come off this morning
by which I send this short account of our progress up to this date.</p>
<p>We reached the PEACH RIVER in longitude 142&deg; 50' E. and latitude 13&deg;
23' S., having found "colours" in the gullies from the Coen northward to the
Peach. [SEE MAP C.]</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 571}</u></p>
<p>I led the party to strike the Peach so far west for the purpose of seeing a
range (the Geikie Range) which had been dimly descried on the previous trip and
which, I thought, might possibly be auriferous country. It turned out, however,
to be horizontally bedded "DESERT SANDSTONE," covering over all the possibly
auriferous country in that locality.</p>
<p>This "DESERT SANDSTONE" now appears to occupy a much greater area in the
Peninsula than has been hitherto suspected. Covering all the surface west of
the 143rd meridian FROM THE PEACH RIVER northward TO the south corner of TEMPLE
BAY with a very gentle dip to the west, it reduces the primary and possibly
auriferous country to a very narrow belt along the east coast. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>The prospectors spent ten days on the "upper reaches of the PEACH RIVER," so
far as these were accessible for scrub and precipitous rocks. To our great
disappointment, we found the stream so confined with rocky gorges that scarcely
any washdirt was to be found, the force of the current having washed the rocky
bed of the river quite bare. Where any wash was found it generally yielded
"colours" [of GOLD].</p>
<p>Having crossed the Coast Range, from the head of the Peach River to the
eastern waters, we obtained "colours" in the gullies opposite No. VIII ISLAND.
Since then we have been travelling northward across the heads of tributaries of
the Peach and down the PASCOE RIVER (which rises near the south end of Lloyd
Bay, goes north-westward to the 143rd meridian and north-eastward into Weymouth
Bay). We have not obtained even "colours," however, from No. VIII Island to
Fair Cape, although country of the same character (granite in the mass of the
range, with occasional gneiss, mica-schist and quartzite on its edges) has been
traversed.</p>
<p>The RAINS have made travelling since Christmas very difficult and
disagreeable. We had to CAMP FOR A WEEK opposite No. VIII ISLAND, FOR ANOTHER
WEEK in the latitude of CAPE DIRECTION, and finally, to WAIT AT THE PASCOE
RIVER till Mr. Crosbie's party built a BOAT to carry the packs across.</p>
<p>The NATIVES proved very HOSTILE from the heads of the Peach to a camp near
Cape Sidmouth (about ten days). [SEE MAP B.] They ATTACKED MR. CROSBIE'S PARTY
ONCE AND MINE TWICE while we were travelling in the rain. They threw SPEARS
FROM AMBUSCADES on the edges of the scrubs, on one occasion WOUNDING FATALLY
THE HORSE i WAS RIDING, and on another INFLICTING a severe flesh WOUND ON JAMES
LOVE'S HORSE. They were, however, so far misled afterwards as to leave their
cover and brave us in the open country, when they learned to respect firearms.
We have</p>
<blockquote>[1) In "A Short Account of Travel from Thursday Island along the
Line to the Main Telegraph Station," etc., in the <i>Northern Herald</i> of
21st January, 1916, Mr. James Dick refers to "the furthest north gold discovery
on the mainland," <i>viz.</i>, a reef, yielding 9 dwt. per ton, worked by
Jardine and Crisp, "2 miles from Temple Bay." The exact locality is not given,
but it is probably in the Carron Range.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 572}</u></p>
<p>never seen them since till we camped here; they do not even follow our
track. There is a small party camped near us here, but we apprehend no danger
from them, and we leave to-morrow morning.</p>
<p>We EXPECT TO REACH SOMERSET in about a month, finding out by the way whether
the RICHARDSON RANGE is an exception to the sandstone which we fear will prove
to be the rule north of this.</p>
<p>On the way back it is my intention to prospect the REMAINING POSSIBLY
AURIFEROUS COUNTRY, <i>viz.</i>, that from the south end of Temple Bay to the
south end of Lloyd Bay, which we were unable to reach on account of the rains.
I shall also spend some time on the Peach River in its lowest reaches, where
the washdirt must all have been carried. Naturally, more time would have been
spent there on our way north if we had known how poor the country to the north
was to prove. By the time we return we hope that the question of the value of
the Cape York Peninsula as a possible mining country will be settled once for
all.</p>
<p>The party is in good health, with the exception of Mr. Macdonald, who has
suffered occasionally from attacks of biliousness and fever.</p>

<h5>(SEE MAP B.)</h5>
<p>FEBRUARY 19, 1880. Shoeing horses, etc. The horses did well at this camp
[No. 42], as there was plenty of good short GRASS, and few flies.</p>
<p>I found in the cliff below the camp two COAL SEAMS, each a quarter of an
inch in thickness, in grey argillaceous sandstone,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 574}</u></p>
<p>overlaid by conglomerate with fragments of carbonised wood.</p>
<p>The day was sultry, with thunder-showers in the afternoon.</p>
<p>February 20. We left Camp 42 in the morning, and, after travelling for a
mile to the west, crossed from the left to the right bank of the creek which
falls into the sea south of the "Remarkable Red Cliff." The banks of the creek
were boggy. Some HOOP-PINES were observed in the scrub.</p>
<p>Two miles further to the west we recrossed the creek. The intervening
country was sandy, with teatree and stringybark and occasional patches of
"garrawan "&mdash;SCRUB and HEATH.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards we got on a hard sandy ridge, and had a glimpse of the
coast sand-hills.</p>
<p>After 2 miles more of travelling to the north-west, we crossed a boggy
gully, where some of the horses got stuck. Just before reaching this bog we
observed a place where a recent HURRICANE had rooted up or broken down all the
trees, CLEARING A LANE about two chains in width. The course of the storm had
been from south to north.</p>
<p>One mile and a half more to the west, mostly through low open heath, we had
a view of a remarkable conical sandstone-capped mountain, about 6 miles off to
the south-west.</p>
<p>In 1 mile more, to the north-west, we camped at the head of a HEATHY AND
BOGGY FLAT. (CAMP 43.)</p>
<p>About an hour before we reached the camp there was a thunder-storm, with ten
minutes of HEAVY RAIN, which pelted us like hail.</p>
<p>February 21. We left Camp 43, and, after crossing the bog, kept for half a
mile to WSW. on the south side of a lily lagoon, which proved to be the larger
and outer of two anabranches of a LARGE RIVER, here running to NNE. As it was
impossible to cross the lagoon, which was about 30 yards wide, not to speak of
the river, we retraced our steps and started afresh from half a mile south of
the camp.</p>
<p>We travelled from this point for a mile to WSW. across low open BOG, and for
a mile and a half to ESE., and half a mile to the south, along the edge of a
narrow MARSH choked with pandanus and PITCHER PLANT, when we crossed a
fourth-magnitude creek which falls into the head of the marsh.</p>
<p>In one mile WNW. across low HEATHY COUNTRY, partly sandy and partly BOGGY,
we touched a chain of deep LAGOONS, and skirted them for half a mile to the
SW., when we crossed the stream connecting two of the lagoons (here running due
east, and about equal in volume to a creek of the fourth magnitude).</p>
<p>In 1 mile further to WNW., over sandy country with she-oaks and
stringybarks, we again reached the river [MACMILLAN RIVER.&mdash;R. L. J.]
which had turned us back in the morning. On running</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 575}</u></p>
<p>it up for a mile to the south, some sandstone country was seen for the first
time in the day's journey, and a creek of the second magnitude fell into the
right bank of the river. We ran the former for half a mile to the east, when a
fourth-magnitude creek branched off from it. The country here was low and
LIABLE TO BE FLOODED. A thunder-storm was impending, and the afternoon was far
spent, so that we judged it better to return to the higher ground below the
mouth of the fourth-magnitude creek and camp for the night. (CAMP 44.) There
was a thunder-shower after nightfall.</p>
<p>February 22. The creek rose 18 inches during the night, and fell 6 inches
to-day. The day was very warm. Crosbie, Hamil and Macdonald were engaged in
BUILDING A DUGOUT for crossing the river below the mouth of the
second-magnitude creek. I walked up the latter for 3 miles in the hope of
finding a crossing, but was unsuccessful. Where I left the creek it
bifurcated.</p>
<p>Layland had felled a tree for a bridge across the second-magnitude creek
below our camp. On my return he and I crossed by the tree and traversed the low
country to the river. On running the river up for a mile we felled a tree
across it, but it was submerged for about 9 inches in the middle, and would
only be available for a bridge if the river should fall to that extent.</p>
<p>The BOAT, on being launched in the afternoon, was found to be too small and
unstable for the strong current of the river, and another was commenced; the
two to be lashed together.</p>
<p>There was no rain to-day, or in the night.</p>
<p>February 23. The river had fallen only 2 inches in the night.</p>
<p>The DOUBLE BOAT was finished by eleven o'clock and found to have a high
carrying capacity, so no time was lost in getting the luggage across the river,
and we camped on the left bank. (CAMP 45.)</p>
<p>Getting the horses across proved a difficult and dangerous task. There was
only one place moderately clear of scrub and snags, about a quarter of a mile
above the "ferry," where it was possible for the horses to swim the river.
There was first a long swim from the right bank to a sandy island near the left
bank, but the current was strong, and if the horses got carried by it among the
trees below there was little hope for them. From the upper end of the island a
sandspit connected the island with the left bank, with only a few feet of
swimming, but the bank was boggy.</p>
<p>The prospectors' horses crossed first. All of them reached the island safely
except one young HORSE, "Monkey," which got carried down against a tree and
struggled there till it was exhausted. On being freed at last it struck back
for the right bank, but was caught by the current and DROWNED before our eyes
without our being able to do anything to save it. Then the prospectors' horses
rushed into the channel on the other side of the island before they could be
prevented, and as it was deep and strong, and the bank</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 576}</u></p>
<p>high and soft, they had a very hard struggle to land; but they all did.</p>
<p>When the time for crossing with my horses arrived, we manned the dangerous
trees in the river, and by shouts and gesticulations managed to keep the horses
clear of them, except "Moonlight," who was caught on the same tree that did for
"Monkey," but Crosbie managed to push his head under it. He was swept below,
and with a desperate struggle gained the island.</p>
<p>Considering the strength of the narrow channel between the island and the
left bank, and the boggy state of the bank, I made Charlie lead the horses one
by one along the shallow spit; then the halters were handed to a man on the
bank and the real difficulty with the boggy bank began. "Queensland,"
"Greyhound," "Rose" and "Greenhide" had literally to be dug out and hauled up
the bank by main force. I was much indebted to Crosbie and his party for the
service they rendered here, without which we should certainly have lost some of
the horses.</p>
<p>At our last camp everything which had any perspiration on it was FLY-BLOWN.
Our blankets and stockings were covered with MAGGOTS. At Camp 45, which was in
floodable country, the ground was alive with CATERPILLARS.</p>
<p>The night was cloudy and threatening, but no rain fell.</p>
<p>This LARGE RIVER (which was named the MACMILLAN, after Mr. A. C. Macmillan,
late Engineer of Roads for Northern Queensland), when we first saw it, was
pursuing a course to the north-north-west, among low HEATHY FLATS. Whether it
falls into Temple Bay, Margaret Bay or Shelburne Bay, I had no means of
judging. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> It had, when we saw it, a volume of
water about equal to that of the Clyde at Glasgow, but was evidently in flood.
As its general course was to the north-east while we followed it up, we
concluded that it took its rise far to the south-west, and therefore determined
to cross it. When, however, we reached higher ground on the following day, we
found that the river really took its rise far to the north-west, and followed
closely the base of the escarpment of the SIR WILLIAM THOMSON RANGE to within a
few miles of where we crossed it. Had we kept the left bank for a few miles
further than we did we could have rounded the elbow of the river and got away
easily to north-north-west.</p>
<p>[I conjecture, from Jackey-Jackey's tale, that he, Kennedy, Costigan, Dunn
and Luff must have crossed the Macmillan River where we did, and thereafter
must have kept about 8 miles to the east of our course till they came to the
west coast of Shelburne Bay.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>February 24. On leaving Camp 45, thankful to escape being flooded out (which
must have happened had any large quantity of</p>
<blockquote>[1) According to the 4-Mile Map of the Lands Department (1908), it
falls into Margaret Bay.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 577}</u></p>
<p>rain fallen during the night), we kept for half a mile to the west on an
alluvial flat of the Macmillan. After three-quarters of a mile to WNW. through
sandy country timbered with stringybark and tea trees, with occasional clumps
of brushwood, we passed a LAGOON on the left.</p>
<p>In a quarter of a mile to the north-west we crossed the head of a BOG. For
the next quarter of a mile (west) we kept between a BOG on the left and a SCRUB
on the right. The bog was choked with PITCHER PLANT and a species of
marestail.</p>
<p>After three-quarters of a mile to the north-west through very dense teatree
SCRUB (which had to be cut), we emerged in a PITCHER-PLANT BOG skirting a gully
falling to the south-east.</p>
<p>For 1 mile further to NW. and half a mile to WNW., between a SCRUB (on the
left) and a BOG, we crossed the head of the latter and had a view of the SIR
WILLIAM THOMSON RANGE. A lower sandstone escarpment was seen to our left about
a mile distant.</p>
<p>The next three-quarters of a mile to the north-west were through dense
SCRUB, which had partly to be cut. To this succeeded a mile of open forest
country leading up to sandy spurs of the low range.</p>
<p>We camped on a small gully. There was a difficulty in finding water, but a
HEAVY RAIN began as we camped, and by the time our tents were pitched we could
catch enough for all our needs from the calico. LOVE had great difficulty in
LIGHTING A FIRE in an ANT-HILL. (CAMP 46.)</p>
<p>February 25. There was HEAVY RAIN in the morning, and we did not move camp,
but employed the time in horse-shoeing and other odd jobs. The last of my
shoe-nails were used to-day.</p>
<p>The day cleared about noon, but there were some very heavy showers towards
evening.</p>
<p>I ascended the sandstone range by a spur behind the camp and went along the
edge of the tableland for about a mile to a bald hill, from which a good view
was obtained. FORBES ISLAND lay E. 15&deg; S. The SAND-HILLS were visible as
far north as north-east. The MACMILLAN RIVER appeared to be carried north from
Camp 43 by the sand-hills and sandstone bluffs of the coast, through HEATHY AND
BOGGY FLATS.</p>
<p>The night was dull, with several showers.</p>
<p>February 26. There was rain at sunrise, but the weather cleared before
midday. We left Camp 46, and continued our journey towards Cape York.</p>
<p>For a mile and a half to the north-west we kept close to the edge of the low
sandstone tableland till we reached the hill from which I had taken bearings
yesterday. For the same distance to NNW. we were still near the edge of the
tableland and headed a number of gullies which fell away to the west, probably
into the Macmillan River. Then we ran a creek down from its head,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 578}</u></p>
<p>NNW. three-quarters of a mile, and NW. one mile, till it left our course
westward to join the Macmillan. In 2 miles more, to NNW., we reached the
northern escarpment of the tableland, and after taking a series of bearings
(BIRD ISLAND lay N. 38E.), descended to a lower shelf of the sandstone. When we
had travelled 2 miles to the NW. near the eastern edge of the low tableland, we
crossed a fourth-magnitude creek, with SCRUB and PALMS, falling to the NW. In 1
mile further a similar creek was crossed. Here there was a heavy
thunder-shower.</p>
<p>One mile to the west we camped on a gully falling into the last-mentioned
creek. (CAMP 47. Latitude, by observation of Canopus, 12&deg; 2' 30" S.)</p>
<p>To-day's travelling had been of a better character than any stage on this
side of Attack Creek. The soil has been sandy, and either red or white in
colour, according to the varying composition of the sandstone; the grass
somewhat sparse but fairly good in quality. On the higher tableland the timber
was mostly stringybark and myall, with some box. Vines were plentiful and we
obtained some bunches of good black grapes, almost free of the astringent taste
common to Australian wild fruits. On the lower shelf of the tableland,
bloodwood timber took the place of box. HEATHY FLATS extended from the base of
the sandstone escarpment to the SAND-HILLS of the coast.</p>
<p>February 27. Half a mile north of Camp 47, we crossed a third-magnitude
creek running strongly to ESE. In 2 miles more to the north, over low and
open-timbered country (stringybark and myall) we had CROSSED THE SANDSTONE
TABLELAND and reached the low escarpment which formed its northern edge. The
scarp is indented here with a deep bay, receding about 3 miles to the west.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half to the north, through low heathy country (sandstone
"cement") with GIGANTIC ANT-HILLS and no timber, we reached a creek of the
second or third magnitude, with tea trees and a few palms, falling to the
north-east. The creek was flooded and we had to BRIDGE it by felling a large
teatree and eking it out with saplings and a rope. The packs and saddles were
carried across the creek by the bridge. The horses crossed higher up the creek,
at a place where they could just keep their feet, bare-backed. The passage was
effected without any mishap, but "Queensland" had, as usual on such occasions,
to be hoisted up the boggy bank.</p>
<p>There was RAIN before and after we got into camp and after dark. The creek
rose 6 inches during the night. We camped on the left bank. (CAMP 48.) [A few
miles north-west of this camp was (so far as our observation went) the
northmost point of the escarpment of sandstone which forms the eastern limit of
the tableland which was named the SIR WILLIAM THOMSON RANGE. We had seen the
escarpment, almost without a break, from</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 579}</u></p>
<p>13&deg; 2' to 11&deg; 58' S. latitude. The eastern escarpment of the
sandstone shelf named the RICHARDSON RANGE by the JARDINE BROTHERS lies west of
the northern portion of the Sir William Thomson Range and extends from opposite
the Brothers' Camp 69 to opposite their Camp 75. About 7 miles ESE. of Camp 48
was what Kennedy mistook for Bligh's Pudding Pan Hill, and where Costigan, Dunn
and Luff were left to perish.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>February 28. The morning was fine. In a mile and a half N. 10&deg; W.
through sandy country, poorly grassed, timbered with stringybark, bloodwood,
myall and she-oak, and half a mile to NNW., we reached and ascended the scarp
of the low sandstone tableland which we had left yesterday. The escarpment of
the SIR WILLIAM THOMSON RANGE was visible about 6 miles off to the west.</p>
<p>In 1 mile further, to NNE., a curious bare dome-shaped hill was seen about 3
miles to the west. The timber was grasstree, small box and a few stunted
Banksias, with HEATH.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more to NNW. (the grasstree having disappeared) we
crossed two creeks of the fourth magnitude, running to the east. After half a
mile of HEATH, on the same course, we entered an undulating forest country.
HEAVY RAIN began here.</p>
<p>From this point we traversed poor forest country with THICK UNDERGROWTH,
approaching scrub in places, for 2 miles NNW. and 2 3/4 miles to the N.,
crossing five creeks of the fourth magnitude, falling east. We then entered a
stretch of more elevated open forest country affording a view of the sea. Large
stringybark trees appeared among the timber. After half a mile to the north,
over country of this description, we turned to the west to avoid a SCRUB (in
which CYPRESS PINES were numerous). In a mile and a half to the west we camped
on the right bank of a gully. (CAMP 49.)</p>
<p>All the country traversed to-day was composed of brown gritty sandstone. The
forest country was sandy and the heath stony.</p>
<p>February 29. We left Camp 49, and in half a mile to the NW. passed a SCRUB
and crossed the head of a BOG. For the next mile north we kept the left bank of
a gully draining from the bog through HEATHY BRUSHWOOD.</p>
<p>For a mile more, to NNE., we kept (through HEATH) the edge of a BOG,
apparently continuous with the last. To the left was very thick BRUSHWOOD. For
the next half mile north we kept the left bank of a fourth-magnitude creek,
draining the bog, till the creek fell into a somewhat larger creek coming from
the south-west (HEATH AND BRUSHWOOD). In crossing to the left bank of the
latter creek I lost my pocket compass and had to take Macdonald's. RAIN began
here, and continued till after we had got into camp.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half more to NNW., through HEATH AND BRUSHWOOD, we crossed a
creek of the fourth magnitude, running strongly to the east, over a sandstone
bottom. In a mile further, on the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 580}</u></p>
<p>same course, through heath and brushwood, we crossed a large
fourth-magnitude creek, falling to the east, roaring over a ledge of brown
sandstone.</p>
<p>After a mile of travelling to the north, over low HEATH, we had to cut a
passage through a belt of BRUSHWOOD. In a mile and a half further to the north,
over low open heath, we came to the edge of a DENSE SCRUB. Seeing some hills to
the east, with forest timber, we made for them, in the hope of finding grass
for the horses. The heathy country traversed to-day was utterly DESTITUTE OF
GRASS.</p>
<p>In half a mile (east-north-east) we camped on the left bank of a gully
running to the north-west in a patch of stringybark country, with a little very
coarse and very poor grass&mdash;the WORST CAMP we have had yet. (CAMP 50.)</p>
<p>Before coming into camp, Crosbie spied a BLACK FELLOW cutting down a tree
with an AMERICAN AXE.</p>
<p>Having settled the camp, Crosbie and I ascended the hill to the east. We
found it to be composed of sandstone in horizontal beds. Its eastern side was
banked up with hillocks of BLOWN SAND closely matted with SCRUB. At our feet
lay a circular LAGOON, about a quarter of a mile in diameter, enclosed by
sand-hills. The lagoon had its outlet in a creek which ran first north and then
west, to join the gully on which we were camped.</p>
<p>We could see across SHELBURNE BAY, with sand-hills in the foreground, and
sand-hills on RODNEY POINT. The SAND-HILLS extend inland for about 10 miles,
and reach an elevation of about 300 feet&mdash;circumstances which suggest a
RECENT ELEVATION of the land. Their eastern or seaward slopes are very steep,
and their western sides still steeper. Except where the slope is too steep for
vegetation, they are covered by a DENSE LOW SCRUB like sloe bushes.</p>
<p>We saw the smokes of several CAMP FIRES among the sand-hills. The low-wooded
rocks, named the MACARTHUR ISLANDS, lay due east. To the north-north-east, we
saw the Messrs. Jardines' RICHARDSON RANGE, whose scarp extends to the
south-south-west. It is tolerably distinct, and appears to be covered with
dense black scrub. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> All the intervening country
is bleak and wretched in the extreme&mdash;BOG, HEATH AND BRUSHWOOD. To the
north-east we saw some clumps of HOOP-PINE on the SAND-HILLS.</p>
<p>The night was cloudy, but no rain fell.</p>
<p>March i. One of the prospectors' horses was missing in the morning, and we
made a late start in consequence. RAIN began as we left, and for three hours
some of the heaviest showers of the season aggravated our difficulties with
SCRUBS AND BOGS.</p>
<p>On leaving Camp 50, we followed the creek down for half a mile to the
north-west, when we crossed it, and cut our way for</p>
<blockquote>[1) It is more likely that the Brothers Jardine applied the name to
the ridge, or shelf, of sandstone which they crossed between their Camps 73 and
74.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 581}</u></p>
<p>a quarter of a mile to the north, through DENSE SCRUB, to a deep flooded
fourth-magnitude creek running strongly to the north-east. This we ran down for
a quarter of a mile to the north-east. On crossing it we emerged on
comparatively open stringybark country.</p>
<p>In half a mile to the north the open country gradually became HEATHY, and we
were stopped by a third-magnitude creek running strongly to the
east-north-east, between scrubby banks. Having crossed this, we got on without
interruption for 3 miles to the north, through low open HEATH on a sandy soil
with NO GRASS. At the end of the 3 miles we crossed a third-magnitude creek,
running east, with PALMS and a little open forest country and GRASS on the left
bank.</p>
<p>The next mile, north-north-west, was utterly GRASSLESS, the only vegetation
being LOW HEATH; then we headed a BOG in half a mile to the west.</p>
<p>In a mile to the north we reached a fourth-magnitude creek, with palms
(<i>Seaforthia</i>). The country was improving a little.</p>
<p>In half a mile to the north-west, through open forest country, most of the
way up the right bank of a gully fringed with DENSE SCRUB and PALMS, we crossed
the gully, and reached in a quarter of a mile to the north, a fourth-magnitude
creek running east, with a SCRUB, which we had to cut.</p>
<p>A mile to the north, through forest country, ironbark, nonda and teatree,
with a thick undergrowth of BRUSHWOOD, with little grass but spinifex, we
crossed a gully falling to the east, with a wide belt of scrub on either
bank.</p>
<p>The next half a mile, north-north-west, was through long HEATH. In half a
mile further to the west, over stony ridges with she-oak and wire grass, we
camped on a gully which had some coarse grass on its left bank. (CAMP 51). [I
believe, on the site of the Brothers Jardine's Camp 74.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>I ascended the hill behind the camp with Mr. Crosbie and took a series of
BEARINGS:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
Rodney Point bore E. 36&deg; S.
Macarthur and Bird Island E. 22&deg; S. to E. 26&deg; S.
Hannibal Island E. 10&deg; N. to E. 12&deg; N.
</pre>
<p>No rain fell in the night.</p>
<p>March 2. We left Camp 51. For the first two miles and a half we crossed
numerous gullies, and passed a bare promontory of the RICHARDSON RANGE.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>In a mile to the north we sidled with ease up the scarp of the RICHARDSON
RANGE. 1 "Greenhide" stumbled into a gully. He had carried Charlie till a few
days ago, when he seemed weak, and was accommodated with a light pack. When he
fell into the gully</p>
<blockquote>[1) A shelf of sandstone lower than that which the Brothers Jardine
named the Richardson Range.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 582}</u></p>
<p>he was unpacked, and it took an hour at least to raise him, though the
ground was hard. He either could or would make no effort to help himself. His
pack was put on "Queensland" for the rest of the day. He seemed to be
constipated, but otherwise we could not discover what was the matter with
him.</p>
<p>In 1 mile to the north, on the top of the sandstone hills (RICHARDSON
RANGE),<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> through thick vine, palm and fruit-tree
SCRUB (which had to be cut) we crossed a fourth-magnitude creek running east.
We then coasted a SCRUB for half a mile to west-north-west, when we cut a
passage through it (in the same direction). It proved to be only a narrow
belt.</p>
<p>In a quarter of a mile to the north, through HEATHY COUNTRY, we reached a
fourth-magnitude creek running north-west and fringed with a dense SCRUB, which
had to be cut through.</p>
<p>Half a mile more of open country (to the north) brought us to a boggy
pandanus gully, running north-west. A BRIDGE had to be built over this gully
before we could cross it. [A tributary of the Jardines' McHENRY CREEK.&mdash;R.
L. J.]</p>
<p>Half a mile to the east, half of the distance up a second pandanus gully,
also falling to the north-west, we crossed the gully and were stopped by a
SCRUB (which we had to cut) fringing a gully falling to the south.</p>
<p>One mile to the north, through forest timber, with an UNDERGROWTH OF
BRUSHWOOD, we reached a DENSE SCRUB, through which we had to cut our way.</p>
<p>In half a mile NNE. (down off the tableland, a scarcely noticeable descent
)over HEATH AND BRUSH, we reached a fourth-magnitude creek, running WNW. We
followed it down for a quarter of a mile, and crossed to the right bank.</p>
<p>In 2 miles further NNE. we were pulled up by a SCRUB, and having got water
in a gully, and a little very coarse GRASS, we camped just at nightfall. (CAMP
52.)</p>
<p>"BROWNIE" was tied up close by the site of the cook's tent. When the tents
had been put up and the fire lit, we discovered that "Brownie" had slipped his
head out of the halter and VANISHED. As his packs contained ALL OUR EATABLES,
besides Love's tent and swag, and the night was dark and rainy, our concern may
be imagined. After some earnest searching by all hands he was caught by
Macdonald.</p>
<p>RAIN fell nearly all day; but there was not much during the night.</p>
<p>March 3. The HORSES were all SCATTERED in the morning and it took a long
time to find them. The last of the prospectors' horses was found by Charlie at
two o'clock, but one little mare of mine, named "OLIVE," was still MISSING.
While the horses were being sought for in the morning, I penetrated the SCRUB
to the</p>
<blockquote>[1) See note, p. 581.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 583}</u></p>
<p>north-east for a mile and a half, but found no end to it. It turned out to
be a belt fringing a gully running north-west. I got a very heavy shower on my
way back. Charlie, Macdonald and I sought for "Olive" for two hours more, but
were still unsuccessful. There were innumerable pockets in the scrub, in any
one of which she might be concealed.</p>
<p>When CROSBIE'S HORSES were all found, he PUSHED ON in the hope of finding a
grassy camp, as the horses could not live at the present place.</p>
<p>At three o'clock we packed up and FOLLOWED ON CROSBIE'S TRACKS, resolved, if
we found a fair camp, to spend the next day in searching for "Olive." We all
felt that "Olive," though a weedy little mare, was indispensable to us, as she
always followed the leader like a dog, and formed an invaluable head for the
train of pack-horses.</p>
<p>Following Crosbie's tracks, we kept to the north-west for half a mile on the
edge of the scrub; then for a mile and a half, the first quarter of a mile
through a path cut [by Crosbie's party] in a DENSE SCRUB. Part of the track
coincided with a TRACK CUT one or two seasons ago BY THE NATIVES. The rest of
the distance was half forest, half scrub, with, however, NO GRASS. Here we
crossed to the right bank of a fourth-magnitude creek (flooded) running to the
NW., the head, I believe, of the river which proved the crowning difficulty of
the Messrs. Jardine's eventful journey in 1865. The BROTHERS JARDINE believed
that THE RIVER (to which afterwards THEIR OWN NAME WAS GIVEN) was the ESCAPE
RIVER of Captain King, and followed it down to the north and west for many days
in the daily expectation of rounding its angle and getting away to the north,
till their doubts were set at rest by its falling into the Gulf.</p>
<p>In a quarter of a mile to the north, through SCRUB, we reached a GULLY which
the prospectors had had to BRIDGE over. Here we overtook them, their progress
through such country having been necessarily very slow.</p>
<p>In half a mile more to the NNW., through DENSE SCRUB, in which a lane had to
be cut, we found ourselves in a sort of pocket, in which we camped just as it
was becoming dark. Crosbie and I went out about a mile to the north through
thick scrub, but found no end to it in that direction. Crosbie and Layland then
tried about a mile to WNW., but found only another somewhat open pocket, no
better than that in which we camped. (CAMP 53.)</p>
<p>Water for the billy had to be brought from the gully with the bridge. As the
GRASS was very limited in quantity and poor in quality, and as some of the
horses exhibited symptoms which led us to suspect the presence of a POISONOUS
HERB among the grass at last camp, and as there was no water at the camp, I
judged that there was no chance of the horses being found in the morning,
and</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 584}</u></p>
<p>had them all tied up, with the exception of four of the weakest, which we
hobbled and belled ("Queensland," "Greenhide," "Greyhound" and "Billy").</p>
<p>There were heavy showers during the night.</p>
<p>March 4. It RAINED VERY HEAVILY up to 11 o'clock and the whole day was dull
and threatening.</p>
<p>OUR POSITION had now become VERY SERIOUS. Two courses lay before us. To PUSH
ON was to run the risk of a third night's camp without grass, involving the
loss of all the horses, and leaving us to find our way to Somerset or the sea
coast, with as much of the bare necessaries of life as we could carry on our
backs. On the other hand, IF WE RETRACED OUR STEPS with the view of striking
for the beach in the hope of finding better travelling, we knew that the
nearest grass was at Camp 51, 13 miles off. Whether the horses, weakened by two
nights of starvation, could cover the distance was a matter of doubt.</p>
<p>Crosbie chose the former course, and I the latter, the additional chance
which it offered of finding "Olive" deciding me in its favour. We agreed to
MEET NEAR PUDDING-PAN HILL, between Orford Ness and False Orford Ness.</p>
<p>The DAY proved a very DISASTROUS ONE. Two of the horses that had been
allowed to feed last night knocked up, and had to be abandoned, with, of
course, the chance of recovering them if they lived. First "Greenhide"
(carrying only an empty packsaddle), after having been dug out of a
steep-banked gully into which he had plunged, lay down on the north side of a
boggy gully on the tableland between Camps 51 and 52 and could not be got to
his feet. His saddle was hidden, and the place marked; but just as we were
about to leave him he rose up of his own accord. We got him across the gully
and on for about half a mile, when he lay down again, and this time had to be
LEFT BEHIND. "QUEENSLAND" began to show signs of distress at the place where
"Greenhide" first lay down. In a couple of miles he was bathed in perspiration
and hardly able to walk. We put his very light load on "Ben." In half a mile
more I dismounted and led "Queensland" while Love drove him forward. I hoped,
at least, to get him off the tableland, where he would be among grass, and in a
position to join the other horses at Camp 51, should he recover; but a mile or
so short of the descent he staggered and FELL INTO A GULLY. The best we could
do for him was to drag him into a place where he could not be drowned, and from
which he might rise if he regained sufficient strength to do so.</p>
<p>"GREYHOUND," another of the horses allowed to feed last night, came into
camp BATHED IN PERSPIRATION and exhibiting the same symptoms as
"Queensland."</p>
<p>I have no doubt that, as three out of the four horses allowed to feed at
Camp 53 fell ill on the day's journey, while the horses</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 585}</u></p>
<p>which were tied up suffered from nothing worse than starvation, the former
must have eaten some POISONOUS HERB. We reached Camp 51 at dusk. (CAMP 54.)</p>
<blockquote class="inline">NOTE. The region described in this and the preceding
chapter is a portion of what is now known to many travellers as "THE WET
DESERT." It is far from being a "desert" in the sense of being destitute of
vegetation, but some of its vegetation is poisonous, and very little of it is
fit for the support of horses or cattle. Kennedy (1848) and the Brothers
Jardine (1865) had traversed part of it before the geological and prospecting
parties (1880). Bradford, in his exploration (1883) preliminary to the
construction of the Cape York telegraph line, saw more of it and lost more by
it than any of the previous travellers, and his description (see <a href=
"#ch88">Chapter LXXXVIII</a>) may be regarded as the fullest extant. The
drawbacks of the "desert" have been considerably lessened since the
construction of the line, as the Telegraph Staff are now familiar with the
location of open country and grassy oases.<br>
<br>
The Kennedy expedition, while Carron was with it, barely touched the region of
the so-called "heath" which is the dominant feature of the vegetation of the
Cape York Peninsula north of the Pascoe River. Otherwise, probably Carron, who
was the botanist of the party as well as its chronicler, would have identified
the noxious bush. On Kennedy's "forlorn hope," his and Jackey-Jackey's
<i>route</i> lay mainly through the "heath," which doubtless told on the horses
and contributed to the disaster. Later, the Brothers Jardine found the term
"heath" a sufficiently descriptive working name. I followed their example, but
carried specimens meant for submission to the then Government Botanist, F. M.
BAILEY. These, however, had to be jettisoned because of the growing weakness of
our horses. The bush, new to me, left the impression of being more like the
European wallflower than anything I had seen before.<br>
<br>
From a recent correspondence with MR. C. T. WHITE, Government Botanist of
Queensland, and especially from his letters of 11th June and 5th July, 1920, it
appears almost certain that the so-called "heath" is Gastrolobium grandiflorum,
Bentham, popularly known as "heart-leaf poison bush." In Plants refuted
Poisonous and Injurious to Stock," by F. M. Bailey and P. R. Gordon (Govt.
Printer, Brisbane, 1887), the bush is thus described: "Flowers...resembling the
flower of the garden wallflower...This dangerous shrub is met with in North
Queensland (inland) and North Australia. Others of the genus constitute the
most dangerous poisonbushes of Western Australia."&mdash;R. L. J.</blockquote>

<p>MARCH 5th, 1880. While mustering the horses in the morning, Charlie detected
the footprints of four or five NATIVES, who had followed our northward track
from Camp 51. This circumstance was notable, as we had never been followed
since the 12th of January. Our new followers were probably from the sand-hills
near Camp 50, and unacquainted with the transactions of the Peach and the long
shot in the Nisbet Valley.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 587}</u></p>
<p>Heavy RAIN began before daylight and lasted till ten o'clock. Afterwards the
sun was strong, and Love and I had a busy day repacking and drying rations,
clothes, bedding, and ammunition, and mending harness.</p>
<p>Charlie and Macdonald went back to Camp 52, got "OLIVE'S" TRACKS, and found
and brought her back. "Greenhide" had got up, but had all the symptoms of
POISONING. He was driven for a short distance, but lay down again, and could
not be induced to rise. "Queensland" had also risen, but could only crawl along
a short way "on his hocks."</p>
<p>I ascended a bare promontory on the sandstone hills, half a mile from the
camp, and saw clear low HEATH for 5 miles to the east. There appeared to be
passable travelling (brushwood and low trees) to E. 30&deg; N., in line with a
wooded island (BOYDONG CAYS?).</p>
<p>March 6. The night and morning were fine. RAIN began, however, when we
started to LEAVE CAMP 54, and continued to fall heavily till the afternoon.</p>
<p>We followed our northward track for 2 miles to the point where we began the
ascent of the RICHARDSON RANGE. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>From this point we struck to the north-east, for a promontory which I had
seen yesterday, where I hoped to find grass for the horses, and where I could
make a last effort to save "Queensland" and "Greenhide." "Greyhound" was,
however, already about to give up, and in a quarter of a mile we were stopped
by a dense SCRUB. After penetrating this on foot for some distance, I returned
to the horses, and, taking into consideration the condition of "Greyhound," and
the chance of making but small progress at the best in such weather, we
RETRACED OUR STEPS for three-quarters of a mile to the nearest grass, and
camped 21 miles north of Camp 54. (CAMP 55.)</p>
<p>The rain ceased by two o'clock, and Charlie and I walked to the point we had
made for in the morning. It lay north-east of the camp. We sidled up the range
by the track and then followed the edge of the range round to the promontory, a
distance of about 2 miles. We found that the top of the eastern scarp was the
very DIVIDE OF THE PENINSULA. There was not a single gully to cross. Still
better, there was not a stick of scrub to cut, although the scrub commenced a
few yards back from the top of the escarpment.</p>
<p>A very old NATIVE TRACK led down from the promontory to the low ground to
the east. It seemed practicable to get down by this <i>route</i> to the sea in
about 7 miles, keeping on the divide between two creeks, without encountering
any great extent of scrub.</p>
<p>"Greyhound's" is a very doubtful case, and it is hard to say whether he can
travel another stage. I gave him a large dose of</p>
<blockquote>[1) The tableland which I had mistaken for the Richardson
Range.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 588}</u></p>
<p>antibilious pills, as constipation seemed to be his only complaint
recognisable.</p>
<p>The night was fine.</p>
<p>March 7. To LIGHTEN THE PACKS, we abandoned twenty slippers [cast
horse-shoes.&mdash;R. L. J.], a jar of arsenical soap, a lot of odds and ends
of saddlery designed for mendings, and the pack-saddles of "Greenhide,"
"Queensland" and "Greyhound," as it had become questionable whether any one of
the poor beasts could even "carry his hide" to Somerset. "Greyhound" seems
better to-day.</p>
<p>The day was dull and threatening, but there was only one heavy shower.</p>
<p>Charlie and I visited "Greenhide" and "Queensland." The former was evidently
in a dying condition, and scarcely took any notice of us; he had wasted to a
mere skeleton. His legs were much swollen and he could hardly walk. The skin on
his quarters was cracked and running. He was covered with flies from head to
foot.</p>
<p>"Queensland" seemed a good deal better. We drove him on (and he followed
Charlie's lead quite intelligently, needing but little driving) to a point
below the promontory which Charlie and I visited yesterday, where there was
good grass and plenty of water. At this point we could pick him up on the next
day's stage, and save him at least 2 miles of travelling.</p>
<p>March 8. Leaving Camp 55, we kept the top of the escarpment to the point
where we left "QUEENSLAND." We found him DEAD. He had fallen down about 30
yards from a gully, and struggled down to it to die.</p>
<p>For a mile and a half to the east we travelled through rather thick
"whip-stick" BRUSH to a belt of SCRUB fringing the fourthmagnitude creek which
comes down from the Richardson Range north of where we left it. We found a good
crossing and open country beyond. At the crossing, however, poor "GREYHOUND"
stumbled and FELL BACK. He was rolled over and set on his legs, but as I was
leading him up the bank by the halter, he tumbled back again, and this time
could not be got up. There was no fear of his drowning. We cut away his saddle
(all he was carrying) to give him a chance for life, and LEFT HIM.</p>
<p>In half a mile to the north-east we headed a BOG, and then continued for 2
miles to the east along the edge of a ridge, covered with cypress-pine SCRUB,
till we crossed to the left bank of a fourthmagnitude creek bordered with
PALMS. For 2 miles more to the east we traversed WELL-GRASSED COUNTRY, with
belts of scrub and gullies falling to the south-east. The next 3 miles, through
good grassy country to east-south-east, along the edge of a dense SCRUB
fringing a creek, brought us within sight of the SEA. We could not, however,
get down to the beach, as another scrub turned us a</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 589}</u></p>
<p>mile to the south. Here we camped, as it was now late in the afternoon.
(CAMP 56.)</p>
<p>Just as we came in sight of the sea, Charlie espied a BLACK FELLOW. From
Charlie's signals to me I gathered, as I thought, that he had seen a kangaroo
or emu, and accordingly unslung my rifle and dismounted. Charlie's idea was
that we should simultaneously fire at the black fellow to make sure of him, but
I declined the sport, to Charlie's intense disgust and amazement. The native on
seeing us slipped into the scrub, and presently a hullaballoo arose which
proved the presence of a LARGE NUMBER OF NATIVES, including many women and
children.</p>
<p>The day and night were fine and no rain fell.</p>
<p>March 9. In the morning, as we were packing, the BLACKS showed up. Two of
them&mdash;one especially&mdash;spoke very fair English. We admitted the two to
a parley outside the camp. Afterwards two more joined them, but we insisted
that the remainder should keep at a distance. The spokesman assured us that
there was "plenty fish" and "plenty bechel'm." They hailed us brothers and
insisted on shaking hands. The principal spokesman introduced himself as
CAPTAIN BILLY, and said that he and his men had several canoes and fished
extensively. They expressed themselves anxious to barter fish and turtle for
tobacco, flour, trousers, shirts, tomahawks, and "big fellow money." We
declined the offer at first, and asked them to show us the best way down to the
beach. They guided us down to the sea in about half a mile by a native track.
Billy accompanied us along the beach (his fellows part of the way keeping us in
view from the cliffs above) to a creek of the third magnitude, which bore W.
5&deg; N. from the southmost of the HANNIBAL ISLANDS. In the mouth of the creek
was a very fine large outrigger CANOE. At this creek, which I named after
Captain Billy, the captain left us, professedly for a drink of water, but
evidently for the purpose of joining his friends.</p>
<p>In three-quarters of a mile we crossed the mouth of a fourthmagnitude creek.
The tide was high and the packs just cleared the water.</p>
<p>Shortly after crossing this creek we mounted to the top of the sandstone
cliffs, which here came close to the edge of the sea. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> We had travelled for about a mile when we detected two
NATIVES WITH SPEARS, couched in the grass; we cautioned them and dismissed
them. A large CANOE, containing five or six men, was at the same time seen
paddling inshore. Three or four blacks could be seen coming up behind us armed
with spears. Billy came up shortly and appeared anxious that we should wait for
the men</p>

the charts used by Kennedy and the master of the "<i>Ariel</i>" in 1848, but

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 590}</u></p>
<p>in the canoe, who were likely to have brought some fish, and who were, he
asserted, "all very good men."</p>
<p>On getting down to the beach again, Billy and his friend of the morning came
panting up with some of the canoe's crew. They renewed the offer to bring fish,
and we sent them off promising to give them tobacco if they brought fish, but
repeating the caution that only two were to come, and to come unarmed. Billy
protested his sincerity in the words, "No gammon&mdash;gammon no good."</p>
<p>Half a mile after we had descended to the beach (low sand-hills extending
inland for some distance, with a few patches of mangrove at half-tide) we
reached a third-magnitude creek, whose mouth bore W. 10&deg; N. from the larger
HANNIBAL ISLAND.</p>
<p>For about 4 miles further we kept the beach by low sand-hills which
stretched a long way inland.</p>
<p>After 2 miles more, by low sand-hills on the top of low sandstone shelves,
we rounded a point of the latter, where I thought of camping. Four or five
BLACKS were seen coming up behind WITH SPEARS, and we went back to meet them.
They offered us one fish. Before coming up they had dropped their spears, which
we found. They were not fish-spears&mdash;one of them, with a long iron barb, I
was destined to become better acquainted with before long.</p>
<p>As we had repeatedly warned Billy that he and his companions were not to
bring spears, we could no longer doubt that they meant mischief. We sent them
away for the last time, warning them that we would fire on them if they again
approached, and as the place did not afford a good camp for defence we moved
on.</p>
<p>Two miles farther we rounded a sandstone promontory [HUNTER POINT] and
crossed a somewhat boggy creek of the second or third magnitude, afterwards
named CAMISADE CREEK. The blacks, who probably expected to find us thrown into
disorder by the boggy creek, were now seen coming up behind, about fifteen
strong, armed with spears, evidently with hostile intent. We got as near as we
could (about 150 yards) and fired. Unfortunately we missed them, and the blacks
fled.</p>
<p>We camped on the north side of the creek on an open sand-patch, well grassed
and separated from a scrub by the backwaters of the creek. The camp bore W.
33&deg; S. from HALFWAY ISLAND, and NW. from the outermost island of the
HANNIBAL GROUP. (CAMP 57.)</p>
<p>I have been blamed in some quarters for a want of firmness in not having
shot some of the blacks on the first appearance of TREACHERY; and it is easy to
see that an opportunity of striking terror and inspiring respect occurred when
the two natives were found hidden in the grass. I refrained from taking
advantage of that opportunity, simply in the hope that the affair might be got
over without bloodshed, and from a disinclination to commence</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 591}</u></p>
<p>hostilities which might result in the loss of more of our horses, and we
could spare no more. We had been free of the despicable savage warfare ever
since we left the Nisbet Valley, and I was in the last degree averse to
renewing the strife with a new tribe.</p>
<p>The night was fine and starry. Considering the terms on which we were with
our neighbours, I set a WATCH of two and a half hours per man, the man on duty
to keep the horses together and look after the safety of the camp. Macdonald
and I had finished our watches, and I had turned in for about twenty minutes,
leaving Love on guard. I was dozing off to sleep, when a SPEAR came from the
edge of the scrub on the other side of the water-hole, pierced the fly, and
crashed THROUGH MY NECK above the right shoulder-blade, injuring the deltoid
muscle. I rose on my elbow and reached for my revolver, when a SECOND SPEAR
transfixed the stretcher from which I had just lifted my head. I gave the
alarm, and carried my sheath-knife to Macdonald, and caused him to cut the
flesh (about a quarter of an inch in thickness) above the spear. It would, no
doubt, have been better to have cut the spear and drawn it out, but it was so
firmly fixed by the tension of the surrounding muscles that all my strength was
insufficient to move it. The spear, besides, was of very thick hardwood, and to
have cut it would have taken several minutes. Naturally I expected that the
flight of spears would be followed up by an immediate attack on the camp; and
while I had a spear 8 feet in length dangling across my shoulder I could not
have counted for much in the defence.</p>
<p>CHARLIE, it appears, had HEARD THE BLACKS stealing down into the water-hole
from the scrub. He had tried, as he said, to wake Macdonald, who was sleeping
in the same tent. He probably tried, if at all, very gently. As, however,
Macdonald did not wake, Charlie's heart failed him, and he crept out of the
tent and MADE STRAIGHT FOR SOMERSET. LOVE (who had been rounding up the
horses), hearing the alarm at the camp and seeing a naked black fellow bounding
along the beach, dropped on one knee and FIRED TWO SHOTS at Charlie, which
pulled him up, frightened, but unhurt.</p>
<p>All hands kept watch for the remainder of the night, and a fusilade was kept
up into the scrub. About an hour after the attack, Macdonald saw two of the
blacks at the edge of the scrub, and some shots were fired in the direction,
but I think they did no good. Nero, our dog, got on the tracks of the
assailants, and we heard him captured by them, but he returned in about an
hour.</p>
<p>The SPEAR which struck me was 8 feet in length and an inch in thickness at
the shoulder. The last 2 feet of it were formed of a light grasstree stem
hollowed out at the end for the insertion of the claw of the WIMMERA. It was
BARBED WITH 7 inches of quarterinch IRON ROD, beautifully pointed at both ends.
It had penetrated the side of my neck for 13 inches over the point, and
rested</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 592}</u></p>
<p>with its thickest part buried in the flesh. It made, as may be imagined, an
ugly wound which partially disabled me for the rest of the journey.</p>
<p>The SPEARS which entered my tent PASSED directly OVER LOVE'S STRETCHER, and
must have killed him had he been asleep, as the blacks had been cunning enough
to stand in the water-hole, at a level which enabled them to rake the floors of
the tents with their spears. Charlie had saved himself, as has already been
related. MACDONALD'S tent had THREE SPEARS in it, besides one which had fallen
short outside. His personal safety was owing to the fact that he slept on the
lee-side of a pile of pack-saddles and rations. An idea of the FORCE with which
the spears may be propelled by WIMMERAS may be gathered from the fact that a
spear was found to have PENETRATED A BAG OF RICE, and entered the tin covering
of an oil-bottle, which was broken by the shock.</p>
<p>March 10. It would have been useless to have attempted to follow the blacks,
who could easily have escaped to the islands in their canoes. The condition of
our horses and rations alike made it imperative that we should push on without
the loss of a day, and if possible rejoin the prospectors.</p>
<p>Before leaving the scene of the attack, we broke up and BURNED the
collection of SPEARS which had been thus unexpectedly forced on us. Quite an
armful was picked up round the tents.</p>
<p>Three miles from CAMISADE CREEK we had to wait for three hours at the mouth
of a third-magnitude creek for the fall of the tide. The place bore W. 15&deg;
S. from HALFWAY ISLAND.</p>
<p>In 2 miles further we came on a camp of the PROSPECTORS with their tracks
leading northward from it. In 3 miles more we found them on FALSE ORFORD NESS,
and camped beside them. (CAMP 58.)</p>
<p>To-day's stage was very easy travelling on a narrow strip of moderately hard
sand. Above that was a raised beach 10 or 12 feet high which in places extended
inland for nearly a quarter of a mile. The RAISED BEACH was covered more or
less with hills of BLOWN SAND. North of the creek where we waited for the tide
to fall, the sand-hills abutted on hills of sandstone (bare or heathcovered)
three or four hundred feet in height.</p>
<p>We encountered no rain on our journey, but there had been a heavy shower at
False Orford Ness in the morning. There was heavy rain after dark. The
"<i>Normanby</i>" steamer, from Hongkong, was seen passing south about eight
o'clock. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>The PROSPECTORS had had a very trying time since we parted. Their horses,
which were allowed to feed at Camp 53, were all more</p>

rains, heavy scrub cutting, creeks to bridge, and no feed for the horses. Their

<p>Three SHIPS appeared off Orford Ness about two o'clock, going south. In case
they should come near enough to be hailed, I wrote letters, but the ships
(which turned out to be <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> craft) anchored off
Cairncross Island at sunset, and in the morning were seen outside of Halfway
Island.</p>
<p>FALSE ORFORD NESS is a low promontory of horizontally bedded red sandstone
coming down in a cliff to the sea. The Ness is covered (lightly near the sea)
with BLOWN SAND, which accumulates inland into high sand-hills. These extend
inland for 2 or 3 miles till they abut on a range of heath-clad sandstone
hills.</p>

<h4>SECOND PRELIMINARY REPORT</h4>
<h5>(SEE MAP B.)</h5>
<p>TWO days after the date of my last report [" First Preliminary
Report."&mdash;R. L. J.], the combined prospecting and geological parties left
Temple Bay for the ranges to the west.</p>
<p>Our progress was arrested early on the morning of the 21st February by a
large and deep river running to the north-east, and after vain attempts to
cross it, finding that we were being carried to the south and even to the east
of south by branching tributaries nearly as formidable as the river itself, and
that we were in country which had been lately submerged by frightful floods, of
which the daily heavy rains threatened a speedy repetition, we camped and built
a CANOE for the transport of our saddles and packs. This work was accomplished
in safety on the 23rd. [CAMP 45.] The horses were swum across with much greater
difficulty, owing to the strength of the current, the softness of the banks and
the number of trees in the middle of the river. ONE OF THE HORSES of the
prospecting party was DROWNED. This river, which probably empties itself</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 595}</u></p>
<p>into the north end of Temple Bay, was afterwards found to rise to the
north-west, about the latitude of Young Island. It received the name of the
MACMILLAN. [It falls, according to modern maps, into Margaret Bay, west of Cape
Grenville.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>After an arduous day's travelling, mainly in a north-westerly direction,
through BOGGY COUNTRY, DENSE BRUSHWOOD AND SCRUB, WITHOUT A BLADE OF GRASS, we
camped among the spurs of the range&mdash;easy red-soil ridges with open
timber. We had the satisfaction of being once more high and dry in a place
where the floods could not harm us and where the horses would find plenty to
eat. HEAVY RAIN began before we had completed our camp [CAMP 46], and the next
day&mdash;the 25th&mdash;brought such torrents that we were convinced that had
the crossing of the Macmillan River been postponed for twenty-four hours men
and horses must alike have been swept away.</p>
<p>For the greater part of the two following days we kept, on a course of NNW.,
the edge of a SANDSTONE TABLELAND, which dropped off suddenly on our right
hand. This portion of the range afforded at least better travelling&mdash;an
open-timbered, grassy land&mdash;than any we had enjoyed north of the latitude
of No. VIII Island of the Claremont group. But our satisfaction on this ground
was more than outweighed by our chagrin in finding that the range was composed
solely of the "DESERT SANDSTONE" with which we had already become too familiar
in the Peninsula.</p>
<p>This sandstone has an almost imperceptible dip to the west, and the
escarpments formed by the weathering of the harder beds give rise to the
so-called "range" WHICH DIVIDES THE EASTERN AND WESTERN WATERS of the greater
part of the Peninsula. A few miles west of our course lay the crowning
escarpment of the range; a lower shelf of the sandstone stretched between us
and the SAND-HILLS fringing SHELBURNE BAY; its only vegetation a dreary HEATH,
relieved at intervals by coarse grass on some isolated fragments of the higher
shelf on which we were travelling.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 27th February we left the tableland and struck due
north into the HEATHY COUNTRY, when we found a large creek running north-east
towards Shelburne Bay. A FOOTBRIDGE was improvised by felling an overhanging
teatree and ekeing it out with saplings and a rope. Over this our packs and
saddles were carried on the heads of the party. The horses were got across at a
place a quarter of a mile higher, where they could just keep their feet and no
more. We camped on the left bank. [CAMP 48.] The RAIN which fell during the
subsequent part of the day and following night made us thankful that we had got
over in time.</p>
<p>On the 28th we travelled nearly due north for 11&frac12; miles, over country
partly heathy and stony and partly open-timbered (chiefly stringybark), with
red sandy soil. This brought us [at CAMP 49]</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 596}</u></p>
<p>about 10 miles north of the camp where the MESSRS. JARDINE, in 1865, first
met with the country which they describe as "FRIGHTFULLY BAD" and "FEARFULLY
DIFFICULT," and we began to flatter ourselves that we were to be more fortunate
than they, our course being on the eastern and theirs on the western side of
the escarpment of the RICHARDSON RANGE.</p>
<p>The following day, we picked our way for 8&frac12; miles, in TORRENTS OF
RAIN, as nearly north as the circumstances permitted, down or across the heads
of gullies falling to the north-east. We saw SCARCELY A BLADE OF GRASS in the
day's stage. To avoid the BOGS we had to take to the HEATHY BRUSHWOOD, through
which a path had to be cut for the horses. We camped on a gully in a little
patch of forest country, on very coarse grass&mdash;worse than any that our
horses had yet met with. (CAMP 50.)</p>
<p>Having settled in camp, Mr. Crosbie and I ascended a scrubby sandstone hill
to the east of the camp. We found the east side of the hill masked by ridges of
BLOWN SAND which extended to the coast, a distance of not less then 10 miles.
The MACARTHUR ISLANDS lay due east. To NNE. we could see the RICHARDSON RANGE
[?], its escarpment trending from NNE. to SSW., and apparently covered with
DENSE BLACK SCRUB. The intervening country was bleak and wretched in the
extreme BOG, HEATH and BRUSHWOOD. It required some courage to face the task of
forcing our way through such a land. At our feet lay a dark, circular LAKE,
enclosed among SAND-HILLS: its outlet was traceable for some distance to the
north and north-west, when it fell into a creek running north-east. Mr. Crosbie
had seen one NATIVE during the day, and from the scrubby hill we made out the
smokes of several camp fires among the sand-hills.</p>
<p>On 1st March we travelled 9 3/4 miles, nearly due north. RAIN began as we
left, and for half the day some of the heaviest showers of the wet season
aggravated our difficulties with brushwood, bog and heath. The escarpment of
the RICHARDSON RANGE [?] could sometimes be seen a mile or two to the west.
Several small creeks were crossed draining to the east. We camped at nightfall
on the first grass we had seen since midday, on a spur of the range. (CAMP 51.)
Our <i>route</i> this day probably coincided for the most part with that of the
Brothers Jardine. [It was a few miles east of the Jardines'
<i>route</i>.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>Hoping to find on the tableland better travelling than on the heathy shelf
below, we sidled up the hills on the morning of 2nd March. We were cruelly
disappointed, as it turned out a day of severe toil. We had no sooner reached
the top of the tableland than we had to begin cutting our way through DENSE
SCRUB (cypress pine and vine), and this continued, with little intermission,
for the remainder of the day, the exceptions being narrow steep-banked BOGGY
CREEKS, one of which had to be BRIDGED over. The course</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 597}</u></p>
<p>was mainly north, and the distance travelled about 10 miles. Early in the
day, one of the horses ("Greenhide") showed symptoms of weakness, and blundered
into a gully, from which he was extricated with difficulty. The rain fell
during the greater part of the day. One small creek, about 4 miles north of
Camp 51, ran eastward. The creeks crossed further north made their way to the
north-west, doubtless to join the JARDINE RIVER or its large tributary, the
McHENRY. We camped at nightfall on the edge of a scrub, in which a gully was
found containing a little water. This scrub was afterwards found to fringe a
gully running to the NNW., which we had reason to believe was the very head of
the JARDINE. [CAMP 52.]</p>
<p>It was so nearly dark on our arrival in camp that we could only observe that
the grass was coarse; but it <i>was</i> grass, and the first that we had seen
for some time, the last few miles having been barren heathy country. When the
morning broke (3rd March), the first glance at our surroundings suggested the
thought that we should have much trouble in mustering the horses; and this
surmise proved strictly correct. The last of Mr. Crosbie's horses was found by
two o'clock, and the prospecting party pushed on in the hope of at least
reaching a camp where the horses could live. One valuable mare, "Olive," the
recognised leader of our pack-horses, was still missing. We continued the
search for two hours longer, still without success, and then followed the track
of the prospecting party, resolved to return to seek the lost mare if we could
find a camp, in the meantime, where the other horses would stay. The supposed
head of the Jardine was run down to the NNW. for about 2 miles, when we crossed
to the right bank. The whole day's journey was only about 2 3/4 miles, the
prospectors having had to hew their way through DENSE VINE SCRUB. After we had
joined them night overtook us, in a narrow pocket cumbered with a thick
undergrowth of shrubs and bearing only the coarsest and rankest grass. [CAMP
53.] In spite of the rain, which had fallen heavily at intervals while we were
travelling, water for the billy had to be carried from a gully half a mile back
on the lane which had been cut through the scrub. I pushed on about a mile to
the north by the compass, but found no end to the SCRUB, while Messrs. Crosbie
and Layland penetrated as far to NNW. but found only a pocket similar to that
in which we had to camp.</p>
<p>The CONDITION OF THE HORSES had become very CRITICAL. They had had next to
no grass the previous night. They could have none to-night; and I suspected the
presence of POISONOUS PLANTS among grass such as was to be found there. Should
the horses wander into the scrub it might take days to find them. Another day's
work, followed by a failure to find grass, would relieve us of all further
anxiety regarding the horses, the strength of the poor beasts having already
been greatly reduced by rain and flies. In</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 598}</u></p>
<p>the circumstances I judged it best to TIE THE HORSES UP for the night (with
the exception of the four weakest, <i>viz.</i>, "Queensland," "Greenhide,"
"Billy" and "Greyhound"), and to make, on the following day, a FORCED MARCH
BACK to the last grass that we knew of (at Camp 51), and thence resume the
search for the mare while recruiting the other horses. As this plan would
necessarily involve at least a temporary separation from the prospecting party,
I made for Mr. Crosbie's use a copy of the map between our camp and Somerset.
MR. CROSBIE'S PLAN was to make north for the "grassy flats" about 10 miles
distant, marked on the chart to the west of PUDDING-PAN HILL, and wait there a
few days to recruit his horses. There we might rejoin him, or, at least, pick
up his tracks. It may be mentioned here that, after satisfying himself of the
non-existence of the "grassy flats" in question, he MADE FOR THE COAST near
FALSE ORFORD NESS, where we rejoined him on 10th March.</p>
<p>We started early on 4th March and reached our old camp, 51 [now Camp 54] an
hour before dusk. Charlie detected the TRACKS OF BLACK FELLOWS on ours near the
camp. RAIN fell heavily for the first three or four hours after we made a
start. The DAY proved a very DISASTROUS one. Of the four weak HORSES which I
had allowed to feed, out of sheer pity, the previous night,
two&mdash;"Greenhide" and "Queensland"&mdash;had to be left far behind, being
unable to stand, although frequently hoisted on their feet; a
third&mdash;"Greyhound"&mdash;barely managed to crawl to the camp. All three
had evidently been POISONED, and I was painfully conscious that they had no
strength to come and go on.</p>
<p>Heavy RAIN fell from daybreak till ten o'clock of 5th March. Macdonald and
Charlie succeeded in tracking the strayed mare, and drove "Queensland" and
"Greenhide" a short distance towards the camp. As the morning's rain was
succeeded by a sultry afternoon, I seized the opportunity of drying provisions,
clothing, bedding, ammunition, saddlery, etc., all of which by this time stood
sorely in need of attention. I also spent some time on the edge of the
tableland, anxiously spying out the nearest and clearest access to the coast,
having satisfied myself that the inland <i>route</i> was unprofitable, if not
impracticable. I had also the painful task of deciding which of our impedimenta
we could best spare, as it had become absolutely necessary to LIGHTEN THE LOADS
of the remaining horses.</p>
<p>We left Camp 51 [CAMP 54] the following morning, and had very heavy RAIN
till two o'clock. We followed our previous northerly track for 2 miles, and
left it at the point where we had ascended to the tableland, steering for a
distant point of the hills, whence I thought I had seen a comparatively clear
way to the coast. We found one way barred, however, by an impenetrable SCRUB;
and as the third poisoned horse ("Greyhound") seemed still unable to travel, we
camped early. [CAMP 55.] When the rain</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 599}</u></p>
<p>had cleared up in the afternoon, I went to the point we had been making for
in the morning, and found that it could be reached by easy travelling on the
eastern edge of the tableland.</p>
<p>March 7th was a dull and threatening day, but there was only one heavy
shower. I made a last attempt to save the two horses abandoned on the 4th.
"Greenhide" was found in a dying condition, quite idiotic, worn to a skeleton,
and his skin a network of sores. "Queensland" seemed better, and I left him on
a grassy plot where we could pick him up on the way&mdash;an arrangement which
would save him 2 miles of travelling on the next stage.</p>
<p>On 8th March we left Camp 55 and got along comfortably to where "Queensland"
had been left. The unfortunate animal HAD DIED during the night.</p>
<p>A mile and a half to the east, through rather thick "whipstick" brush,
brought us to a small creek running south-east. A bit of scrub had to be cut,
and the crossing had to be improved a little. Poor "GREYHOUND" stumbled in
getting up out of the water, and, although lifted out, was too weak to stand,
and fell back helpless. We were under the necessity of LEAVING him to his fate.
The LAST WATCH in the party had succumbed on this date to the incessant damp,
and we were for the rest of the journey without means of estimating the
distance travelled, except by a rough guess. The cloudy sky seldom permitted me
to get our position by the stars. Our finger- and toe-nails had become
softened, almost to the consistency of cheese, from being constantly wet. The
Snider and shot-gun ammunition had absorbed moisture to the degree of being
unreliable in any emergency. My WestleyRichards rifle, with its protected lock
and metallic cartridges, could be used in any circumstances.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we camped on FINE GRASS about a quarter of a mile from the
sea. [CAMP 56.] Before coming into camp the black boy's fine eyes detected a
NATIVE, who was looking for sugar-bag. He invited me to shoot him. This would
have been easy enough; but I declined the sport, to Charlie's great
mortification.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th, as we were packing up, a number of NATIVES came
forward, holding up their hands and shouting "White fellow!" Two of them were
permitted to parley outside the camp. They spoke English well, especially one
who called himself "BILLY" and said he was captain of many canoes. Billy said
he had been with <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> fishers, and displayed an intimate
acquaintance with their ways. He offered to bring us fish. The last of our beef
had been eaten more than a month before, and fish would have been a welcome
addition to our rations. We accepted the offer, and bargained to exchange
tobacco for the fish, but insisted that only two were to come to traffic, and
that they should leave their spears behind.</p>
<p>Billy walked beside us for about a mile and a half to the mouth</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 600}</u></p>
<p>of a creek, showing us the track down the cliffs to the sandy beach. In the
mouth of the creek a large canoe was moored. The place bore W. 5&deg; S. from
the northmost of the HANNIBAL ISLANDS. In conversation with "Captain Billy"
regarding his experience among white fellows, Love asked if he had ever seen
WHITE WOMEN. Billy replied in the affirmative, but in terms so gross that the
<i>ipsissima verba</i> were not reported to me till nearly a month had elapsed.
On being pressed as to where and how he had seen the white woman or women, he
lapsed into sulky silence. At first I merely inferred that Billy had seen women
at some fishing-station, but I now strongly suspect that he knows something of
the WHITE WOMAN seen by Captain Pearn at CAPE GRANVILLE about two years ago,
and for whom an unsuccessful search was shortly afterwards made. In connection
with this subject, I may here refer to a discovery which seemed of no
importance at the time, but which may now be regarded in a new light. Mr.
Crosbie and I found, on 16th February, about half a mile south of Bolt Head, in
TEMPLE BAY, the WRECK of a large brig, of colonial build (according to Mr.
Hamil, of the prospecting party), sheathed with copper and muntz metal, with
its cargo of cedar logs strewn on the beach beside it. Most of the timber bore
the brand L, and some of it DH. Our guesses at the age of the wreck varied from
three to eight years. When we met the master of the Piper Island lightship, 3
miles further north, we inquired about the wreck, and his reply, that he had
never heard of it, although the lightship had been there for four years,
confirmed my opinion that the wreck was at least over four years old. That it
was a wreck whose whereabouts nobody knew never occurred to me till I had made
further inquiries at Somerset and Thursday Island. The question arises, What
has become of the crew? A woman may possibly have been on board, and may have
escaped the massacre which doubtless awaited her companions. [Mr. B. Fahey
subsequently identified the wreck as that of the "<i>Kate Connolly</i>" as
already narrated.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>Having crossed the mouth of the creek where the canoe was moored (9th
March), and another similar creek three-quarters of a mile further north the
packs just touching the water in both cases&mdash;we ascended a bare sandstone
headland. Here we detected two BLACKS&mdash;one a hunchback&mdash;planted in
the long grass, with their SPEARS beside them. Four or five were also seen
behind us with SPEARS. Five or six more were seen paddling a large canoe
rapidly towards us. I was strongly inclined to think that we were the objects
of a prearranged attack. As it was, we had the blacks at our mercy, for it
would have been easy to have shot the two men discovered in ambush and to have
emptied the canoes from our vantage-ground on the top of the cliffs; but I
forbore, anxious to avoid a quarrel, if possible. Having warned and threatened
the two spearsmen, we continued our journey. Billy presently overtook</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 601}</u></p>
<p>us and said that he knew the men in the boat, who were "all very good," and
that they would probably have fish if we waited for them. We declined to
wait.</p>
<p>When we had got down once more to the beach, Billy brought up some of the
canoe's men. The offer to bring fish for tobacco was renewed, and we sent the
men off, insisting that only two were to come, and without spears. For the next
6 or 7 miles we saw nothing of the blacks, and we were considering the
suitableness of a rocky headland with a little grass for a camp when five
NATIVES were seen on our track with SPEARS. We took our firearms and advanced
to meet them; four dropped their weapons, which were not fish spears; a fifth
carried his with him to the scrubby sand-hills; three stayed to meet us. They
pretended that the spears were only meant for fishing, but we knew better. They
offered us one small fish, which we refused. We let them clearly understand
this time that we should fire on them if they appeared again on any
pretext.</p>
<p>I may have been in error in letting the treacherous savages go, but shooting
a naked and unarmed man, however justifiable the act may be, is painfully
suggestive of murder to my mind.</p>
<p>We continued to travel northward by the beach towards a grassy flat 2 miles
distant. The BLACKS were now coming on behind, at least fifteen in number,
CARRYING SPEARS, and making no disguise of their intention of falling upon us
whenever they could get us at a disadvantage. It only remained for us to choose
a place where the advantage of the ground would be on our side, and to turn on
them. A broad part of the beach (11&deg; 29' S. latitude) seemed to offer such
a vantage-ground, as our flank could not be attacked from under cover of the
scrubby sand-hills. We found, however, that a large creek with a treacherous
muddy bottom lay between us and the broad patch of sand. The horses got through
with difficulty, and my belief is that the savages were waiting to see us
thrown into confusion at this place. On the left bank we dismounted, and FIRED
ON THE NATIVES, who had begun to run [towards us]. I believe we did no damage,
but we saw no more of the blacks for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>We camped here [CAMP 57] on a grassy flat separated from a scrub by a deep
lagoon a backwater of this creek. The camp bore W. 33&deg; S. from HALFWAY
ISLAND, N.W. from the outer HANNIBAL ISLAND, and W. 4&deg; N. from the eastmost
islet in the BOYDONG CAYS group.</p>
<p>I arranged that the night was to be divided into FOUR WATCHES by the stars.
Macdonald had finished the first, and I the second; Love, who had been sleeping
in the same tent with me, had been on guard for about twenty minutes (about
half-past one o'clock), and was rounding up the horses about 200 yards from the
camp, when suddenly I felt a SPEAR crash THROUGH MY NECK a little above</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 602}</u></p>
<p>the shoulder-blade. To reach me it must have passed over the space where
Love had been sleeping, till he was roused to take his watch. I sat up, and was
in the act of reaching for my revolver, when a SECOND SPEAR pinned the canvas
stretcher from which I had just lifted my head. I fired a shot and called on
all hands to turn out. Macdonald alone responded, the watch being engaged as
already mentioned, and Charlie, having heard the blacks getting into the creek,
had taken to flight. Charlie was met by Love, who naturally took him for one of
our assailants, and brought him to a standstill (unhurt) by two revolver
shots.</p>
<p>I attempted to pull out the SPEAR, which was about 8 feet in length and the
thickest I have ever seen, being nearly an inch in diameter. Its barb (which I
have preserved) was of quarter-inch iron, 7 inches long; and the thickest part
of the spear, about 6 inches beyond the barb, was tightly fixed in my flesh.
Not knowing whether or not we were to have the satisfaction of seeing our
enemies face to face, and resolved to bear my part in their reception if they
should come, after hastily satisfying myself that no important blood-vessel was
involved in the wound, I carried the sheath-knife to Macdonald, and ordered him
to set me free by cutting into the spear through the flesh. [There was no time
for calm deliberation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man!"]<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<p>To cut the spear, which was of very hard wood, might have taken a few
minutes of time, and the integrity of a little bit of flesh might have been
very dearly purchased had the blacks resolutely followed up their attack. After
the rough surgical operation, I felt rather faint for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Random shots were fired across the lagoon into the scrub at intervals during
the night. The tents were struck at once, and I lay down in the open air, while
the rest, including the reclaimed and repentant Charlie, kept vigilant watch.
About an hour after the attack, two blacks were seen crossing a bare patch of
sand, and attracted a volley, but probably they suffered no damage. FOUR SPEARS
were found IN THE TENT which had been OCCUPIED BY MACDONALD AND CHARLIE. One
had gone clean THROUGH a BAG OF RICE, made a hole in the tin case protecting a
bottle of oil, and smashed the bottle. The whole collection of SPEARS was
broken and BURNED.</p>
<p>For some time the wound was very painful. My head had to be laid down for me
when I went to rest, and lifted for me when I wished to get up, and I had to be
lifted into the saddle. The</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 603}</u></p>
<p>shock to the nervous system was greater than I could have believed a healthy
man could have suffered from what was, after all, only a flesh wound.</p>
<p>It would have been quite impracticable for us to follow the blacks in the
condition in which our horses now were, even had we been more numerous. As they
had followed us nearly 10 miles they probably returned to their camps for food
in the morning. They could easily elude us by going out to the islands in their
canoes.</p>
<p>The next morning, 10th March, we travelled to FALSE ORFORD NESS, by the
beach, a distance of 8 miles. About halfway to the Ness we had to wait three
hours for the falling of the tide before we could cross the mouth of a small
creek. At FALSE ORFORD NESS we found the PROSPECTING PARTY and gladly camped
beside them. [CAMP 58.] Mr. Crosbie poulticed and dressed the wound and I am
deeply indebted to the whole party for numberless acts of thoughtful
kindness.</p>
<p>The PROSPECTORS had been less fortunate than we in making the coast. They
had HAD MORE RAIN, and an INCESSANT STRUGGLE WITH SCRUB, HEATH AND BOG. MR.
CROSBIE was suffering martyrdom from EAR-ACHE. The HORSES had SUFFERED
dreadfully FROM WANT OF GRASS. THREE WERE LOST in consequence of the POISON
they had eaten at Camp 53.</p>

<h4>ANNOTATED REPRINT</h4>
<h5>(SEE MAP B.)</h5>
<p>MARCH 13, 1880. Left Camp 58. From FALSE ORFORD NESS to ORFORD NESS low
points of sandstone come down at intervals to the sea. The sandstone is covered
with SAND-HILLS, which extend westward for some distance. About 3 miles from
Orford Ness two BLACK FELLOWS were seen far back on our tracks.</p>
<p>Near Orford Ness we saw the tracks of two TURTLES.</p>
<p>On Orford Ness we found the CAPSTAN OF A SHIP.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 605}</u></p>
<p>In the southern bight of ORFORD BAY we found a large inlet, with four
mouths, among the mangroves. The crossing of the first mouth was
dangerous&mdash;a thin and treacherous crust of sand on stiff black clay. Some
of the horses sank deeply in the clay. "Ross," with my packs, fared worst, and
my MAPS AND NOTE-BOOKS were SUBMERGED. While we were in these straits our ears
were regaled with the howls of a number of NATIVES in the mangroves. At the
next mouth we had to wait an hour for the tide to fall. The next two mouths
presented no difficulty, as the tide was low.</p>
<p>ORFORD BAY has a broad stretch of sandy beach bordered with low SAND-HILLS,
which, apparently, go a long way inland.</p>
<p>About a mile beyond the last mouth of the tidal inlet a large outrigger
CANOE was drawn up on the beach, and seven or eight natives stood about it.
They carried their luggage leisurely into the scrubby sand-hills while we were
crossing the inlet. Crosbie, Layland, Love and Charlie galloped towards three
who remained beside the canoe till they were within a quarter of a mile, when
they disappeared among the sand-hills. In a mile more we sighted seven gins and
a piccaninny coming to meet us, the gins all carrying heavy swags. They retired
into the sand-hills, and came down to the beach again when we had passed. It
was probably the moving of a camp, the men having come by the canoe while the
women carried the luggage overland.</p>
<p>There was only one light shower to-day, but heavy RAIN fell during the
night. We camped on the "RED CLIFFS," in latitude 11&deg; 14' S. (CAMP 59.)
[SEE MAP A.]</p>
<p>ONE OF CROSBIE'S HORSES had to be ABANDONED a mile short of the camp. "Coen"
gave sudden signs of his old complaint, and "Brownie" was getting very
feeble.</p>
<p>March 14. For most of the day we kept on the top of the sandstone cliffs,
having to cut two large SCRUBS behind the first tier of sand-hills above the
"Remarkable Red Cliffs." A fourthmagnitude creek empties into the sea a mile
north of Camp 59, and another midway between the "Remarkable Red Cliffs" and
"No. II Point." The sandstone cliffs become higher to the north. At No. 11
Point they are about 150 feet in height. They are bare, or nearly so, for a
little way back from the sea, but inland they are covered with BLOWN SAND to a
height of about 300 feet above the sea-level. We camped about a mile south of
No. 11 Point. (CAMP 60.)</p>
<p>Heavy RAIN began about midday, and continued till we had got into camp. The
night was threatening, but there was no rain and only a short gale.</p>
<p>March 15. Heavy RAIN began at daybreak and continued with slight
intermission till four o'clock. Travelling was impossible. Gales and a few
showers during the night.</p>
<p>March 16. The morning was fine and breezy, although</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 606}</u></p>
<p>cloudy. On leaving Camp 60 we had good travelling on the top of sandstone
cliffs, nearly 200 feet high, without interruption to the bay south of FLAT
HILL, where we were stopped by the mouth of a large mangrove-skirted creek. The
tide was only about a foot from its highest, and we waited two hours before we
could get across. This creek, which would form a haven for small craft, I named
the HENDERSON [after Mr. J. B. Henderson, the Hydraulic Engineer of
Queensland].</p>
<p>From Henderson Creek northward the cliffs were low, though often
precipitous, and the scrubby sand-hills at times came close to the sea, and we
had difficulty in getting up from and down to the beach when necessary.</p>
<p>We camped opposite an uncharted islet (horizontal sandstone) at a place
bearing S. 26&deg; W. from the south-east end of TERN ISLAND. [CAMP 61.]</p>
<p>The red sandstone at Camps 60 and 61 has an oolitic structure, and is highly
ferruginous. There is evidently a very gentle dip from the Carron Range, so
that as we proceed north we gradually pass over higher beds.</p>
<p>From some high ground near Tern Cliff I saw the north mouth of the ESCAPE
RIVER [lNLET],and some high ground lying N. 20&deg; W., which I took to be FLY
POINT.</p>
<p>March 17. The horses had got so weak that we found it necessary to give them
a day's rest at Camp 61. Crosbie went on to Shadwell Point. SHAD WELL PEAK is a
high sand-hill.</p>
<p>We regaled on oysters, crabs and lobsters while the horses were recruiting.
The day and night were fine, but a few showers fell towards morning.</p>
<p>March 18. We had now kept the beach far enough, as we thought, to be able to
steer a straight course to the west between the Jardine and the Escape Rivers,
for the head of the Kennedy [i.e., lackey Creek, the mouth of which becomes
Kennedy Inlet.&mdash;R. L. J.].</p>
<p>A course of W. 30&deg; N. we imagined would take us clear of the Escape
River. We travelled for 4 miles in that direction on well-grassed soft red
sandy ridges, timbered with bloodwood, box, stringybark and wattle. For a mile
more to the NW. we kept the crest of a white sand-ridge with a lagoon to the
right, and a scrub in a hollow to the left.</p>
<p>For 2 miles W. 10&deg; N., we traversed low, grassy forest country, with
thin belts of scrub running parallel to our course, till we came to a
salt-water creek fringed with mangroves. This creek (a tributary of the Escape
River) was deep and boggy, and though of scarcely more than the fourth
magnitude, bore us for a mile to the south. There the mangroves gave place to
scrub with palms, etc., and the creek becomes a swift-running fresh-water
brook. We crossed it just above its junction with a deep gully, 2 feet wide,
over which</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 607}</u></p>
<p>a substantial BRIDGE had to be built with saplings. "Diver," getting wide of
the bridge, fell into the water, and his packs went down the stream and were
rapidly carried out of sight, and were only recovered after much trouble. A
good deal of sugar and some cartridges were destroyed, the pack-saddle was
broken, and all Hume's clothes and bedding were soaked.</p>
<p>After 2 miles of travelling to W. 10&deg; S. (the first mile through
"flooded country" from which we gladly emerged on well-grassed forest land) we
reached the edge of a BOG, on the further side of which a valley with mangroves
(THE ESCAPE) separated us from a low sandstone tableland. (CAMP 62.) [The scene
of KENNEDY'S DEATH, which took place on or about 5th December, 1848, was
probably between my Camps 62 and 63. COSTIGAN, DUNN and LUFF were left about
igth November, at what Kennedy called PUDDING-PAN HILL, which, however, was not
Bligh's Pudding-Pan Hill, and must have perished after a few days.&mdash;R. L.
J.]</p>
<p>Crosbie penetrated through the BOG and MANGROVES&mdash;a very difficult
task&mdash;and saw the ESCAPE. The river, or rather arm of the sea, was about
half a mile wide, with no perceptible current.</p>
<p>The day was fine, but a little rain fell as we got into camp. The night was
fine.</p>
<p>March 19. As crossing the Escape with horses was simply impossible, there
was no help for it but to run it up till it became a fordable fresh-water
creek.</p>
<p>For 2 miles to SSE., on soft grassy timbered ridges, we kept the mangroves
in sight; then the mangroves disappeared, and we thought the inlet was going to
die off in swamps, one of which, with its gully, we crossed on our course.</p>
<p>In 1 mile further S. 10&deg; E., over stony and grassy timbered ridges
(brown ferruginous sandstone and oolite), just as I thought we were at last rid
of the Escape, we were stopped by a narrow PITCHER-PLANT SWAMP, which forced us
2 miles to the east before we could head it.</p>
<p>In 2&frac12; miles to SSE., by stony ridges capped with SCRUB, and
intersected by heathy and pitcher-plant BOGS, we reached the ESCAPE RIVER, here
a fresh-water creek of the third magnitude. On running it up for half a mile to
the south-east, through SCRUB AND BRUSHWOOD, we found it split up into two
branches. The left branch came from the north-north-east. We ran it up for half
a mile, through BOGGY HEATH, when, finding that it was not fordable, we made
for the nearest grass and camped. (CAMP 63.) The morning was fine, but heavy
RAIN began about midday, and continued to fall till after we had got into camp.
A little rain fell during the night.</p>
<p>March 20. The morning was fine. Heavy RAIN began about midday, and fell for
three hours or so. Crosbie crossed the two branches of the Escape River, and
got away for about 2 miles to</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 608}</u></p>
<p>the west through low heathy country. When he returned, the rain had set in,
and it was too late to move the camp.</p>
<p>March 21. We left Camp 63, and CROSSED the northmost branch, and in half a
mile to the south the southmost branch, of the ESCAPE (a fourth- and
third-magnitude creek respectively). At the latter we had to unpack the horses
and carry the goods across a BRIDGE of saplings while the horses were crossed
about a quarter of a mile higher, just aswim. RAIN began as we were repacking,
and lasted for two hours.</p>
<p>After leaving the Escape we travelled for half a mile to W. 10&deg; S. over
HEATH and PITCHER-PLANT BOGS. For the next half mile to the west we passed over
rather higher ground (oolite), with oaks, pandanus and stringybark, and reached
a fourth-magnitude creek running north&mdash;the last of the Escape waters. In
2 miles to the south we headed the creek. For the first half mile we had to cut
through SCRUB, but the rest was small timber with HEATHY UNDERGROWTH. The rocks
were oolite and sandstone. In the 2 miles we ascended about 250 feet.</p>
<p>For 1 mile to the SW. we kept the crown of the DIVIDE OF THE PENINSULA
(between the ESCAPE and JARDINE waters). For a similar distance we kept to WSW.
down a very gentle grassy slope, thickly timbered with stringybarks, oaks,
nondas, etc., with a SCRUB to the left and a BOG to the right. We camped on the
latter, as it was now near sunset. (CAMP 64.)</p>
<p>No rain fell during the night.</p>
<p>Six days had now elapsed since we left Camp 61, and we were now only 8 miles
to the west, the Escape River having forced us to a course which was totally
unexpected.</p>
<p>March 22. Our next anxiety was to CLEAR THE KENNEDY RIVER [Jackey-Jackey
Creek] above the tidal waters, and with that view we aimed to keep on the heads
of the Jardine waters.</p>
<p>Leaving Camp 64, for 1 mile to WNW., three-quarters of a mile WSW., and
three-quarters of a mile WNW., we kept nearly on the divide; and for a mile and
a half to the NE. we ran up the left bank of a pandanus BOG with a
fourth-magnitude creek, one of the tributaries of the JARDINE RIVER.</p>
<p>In 1 mile further to WNW. we reached the edge of a SCRUB covering the short
steep slope of the eastern fall. We kept the edge of the scrub for a mile
farther to WNW. and camped. (CAMP 65.)</p>
<p>Here, for the first time since we left the neighbourhood of Cooktown, we saw
the tracks and dung of CATTLE.</p>
<p>A heavy shower fell about an hour after we left the camp in the morning. The
afternoon and night were fine.</p>
<p>March 23. There was heavy RAIN at daybreak, and the day was dull and
threatening. We did not move camp, as two of Crosbie's HORSES were KNOCKED UP,
and one of mine ("Poodle")</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 609}</u></p>
<p>was getting very weak. Crosbie and Layland went out to the west about 3
miles.</p>
<p>March 24. There was heavy RAIN before daybreak. On leaving Camp 65, we held
W. 10&deg; N. for 3&frac12; miles, the first 2 miles being through closely
timbered and well-grassed country, just below the divide; the rest HEATHY or
covered with wire grass, with PITCHER-PLANT BOGS falling to the left. One of
these, at 3&frac12; miles from the camp, ran us about a mile to the
north.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> I LEFT "POODLE" at one end of this bog,
and Crosbie had to ABANDON one of his horses ("PADDY") at the other end.</p>
<p>In 2 3/4 miles further, through poor country with oaks and wire grass, we
passed a belt of scrub, and on finding some better grass on the banks of a
boggy gully falling to the south-west, we camped. (CAMP 66.)</p>
<p>March 25. The night was fine till about an hour before daybreak, when RAIN
began. The rain continued with slight intermission till two o'clock. The HORSES
were all SCATTERED: the last of mine was found at nine, but six of Crosbie's
were not found till three o'clock, so that we could not move camp.</p>
<p>March 26. The night was fine and the morning was sunny. Only one shower fell
at midday.</p>
<p>Leaving Camp 66, we kept the DIVIDE for 2 miles to WNW. There was fair
grass, and timber comprising stringybark, bloodwood, myall-wood, and nonda. On
reaching a PITCHER-PLANT BOG, falling to the north (Kennedy [Jackey-Jackey]
waters), we headed it in a quarter of a mile to the west.</p>
<p>For a mile and a half to W. 10&deg; N., we kept the crown of the DIVIDE till
we reached a valley running a little west of north, with high ground beyond
it.</p>
<p>For the next three-quarters of a mile we ran down the right bank of a
fourth-magnitude creek, flanked by a PITCHER-PLANT BOG, till the creek was
joined by a gully coming from the east. We crossed the latter with some
difficulty, and kept the right bank of the joint stream for three-quarters of a
mile to the west, on the summit of a low ridge covered with forest trees.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half to the north-west, gently descending through closely
timbered country (stringybark, bloodwood and myall), fairly well grassed,
Crosbie climbed a high tree on a rise, and saw the mangroves of a branch of the
Kennedy, half a mile to the north. He could see across the Kennedy estuary to
the point of ALBANY ISLAND.</p>
<p>In the hope of heading this branch of the Kennedy [i.e., of Jackey-Jackey
Creek], we altered our course. In three-quarters of a mile we reached a BOG,
fringing a canal-like creek of the</p>
<blockquote>[1) This appears on the Lands Department maps as OLIVE CREEK, so
named after the Mayor of Cooktown.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 610}</u></p>
<p>third magnitude. As it appeared that we should have to bridge this creek,
and the day was getting late, we camped. (CAMP 67.)</p>
<p>After we had camped, I went down the bog, and penetrated through the
mangroves and mud to the salt water. It was running to the north-east, about 40
feet wide and a foot deep. Oysters and other sea-shells were common among the
mangrove roots.</p>
<p>Half a mile below the camp, I heard the creek roaring over rapids, and found
a practicable crossing on a sandstone bar. A very old NATIVE TRACK came up the
right bank of the creek and crossed at the bar. I crossed, and found another
canal-like branch of the creek, in the same flat (not quite so large as that on
which we were camped). This also was passable by a ford on a bar of
sandstone.</p>
<p>March 27. The night was fine. Leaving Camp 67, we crossed the two creeks in
half a mile to the north-west. We were under the impression that the salt-water
creek we had just cleared was the head of the Kennedy River or Inlet, but it
proved to be only a branch.</p>
<p>For 1 mile further to the north-west we travelled on a sound ridge (timbered
with stringybark), by the edge of a bog which fell into the branch of the
Kennedy [or JACKEY-JACKEY CREEK] we had just left. After a time the bog began
to send its waters to the west (although no fall was perceptible to the eye)
into a mangrove swamp with a slow stream.</p>
<p>Perceiving that we were not yet clear of the Kennedy [Jackey-Jackey Creek],
Crosbie and I went for a mile further to the northwest and struck the KENNEDY
INLET [JACKEY-JACKEY CREEK]. It was a sheet of salt water about a quarter of a
mile in width, and running slowly from west to east. Presuming that the inlet
is correctly laid down on the Admiralty chart, this east-and-west reach must be
that which coincides for about a mile with the eleventh parallel of latitude.
The chart shows the river for about 2 miles to the south-west of the east and
west reach, with a note: "2 feet at L.W. Springs. Tide rises about 7 feet. A
boat can proceed 1&frac12; miles higher up, when the R. is lost in swamps." It
was evident that we had still 3&frac12; miles of the salt-water inlet and some
swamps to head before we were clear of the Kennedy.</p>
<p>On returning to the party we altered our course to the southwest. In a mile
we had crossed the bog and emerged on a stringybark ridge; in 2 miles we
crossed the ridge and struck a bog falling to the north. The bog was headed in
half a mile to the south.</p>
<p>In a mile to WSW. we crossed a stringybark ridge, ascending and descending
about 50 feet, and reached a fourth-magnitude creek falling to the west and
flanked by a PITCHER-PLANT AND PANDANUS BOG. We ran down the right bank of the
bog for 1 mile to the west and half a mile to WNW. As, however, the country</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 611}</u></p>
<p>appeared to become less grassy and more heathy as we went on, we retraced
our steps for half a mile and camped. (CAMP 68.)</p>
<p>Cattle-dung was plentiful at this camp. RAIN fell from the start in the
morning till two o'clock. There was also a heavy shower at sunset.</p>
<p>I followed the creek for about a mile down from the camp, till it began to
run to the north-east. Some sea-shells were seen here in a BLACKS' CAMP. This
creek is probably the main head of the KENNEDY. The creek was deep and narrow,
like a canal, and very rapid, but I thought it could be forded in one place if
it should fall a little during the night.</p>
<p>[To avoid the confusion arising from the numerous Kennedy Rivers and Kennedy
Creeks, I retained the name for the estuary or "inlet," but named one of its
principal affluents JACKEY-]ACKEY CREEK, after Kennedy's faithful black boy,
whose heroism deserves an honourable place in history. These alterations were
embodied in the map which accompanied my report when it was originally
presented, but which was not published, and appears to have been lost, though
not before some of its <i>data</i> had been utilised in the compilation of maps
issued by the Lands Department.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>March 28. There was one shower before daybreak.</p>
<p>To-day's living being provided for by yesterday's baking, I divided the rest
of the flour (25 lb.) into FIVE DAYS' RATIONS. We were thus provided for this
and other five days, which we all thought ample time to allow for covering the
30 MILES which now divided us FROM SOMERSET. In the worst case possible, we
were now so near our destination that when our rations ran out we had only to
leave the horses and go on foot for supplies.</p>
<p>Five of the prospectors' HORSES were MISSING in the morning, and were not
found till midday. Crosbie inspected my "possible" crossing, but found it still
impracticable, as the water had rather risen than fallen.</p>
<p>After breakfast Crosbie and I crossed the creek half a mile below the camp,
at a place where it branches into two creeks of the fourth magnitude. We found
practicable crossings of both, and went on to WNW. for a mile, across a
stringybark ridge, to another bog falling into the one we had left. Crosbie got
up a tree here and saw the valley draining to the east.</p>
<p>On the way back, Crosbie was engaged in improving the crossing with the
shovel when a very HEAVY SHOWER came on and speedily made the creek
impassable.</p>
<p>On leaving Camp 68 we built a substantial BRIDGE over the creek below the
junction of its two branches. In 1 mile we reached the bog falling east, and
headed it in a quarter of a mile to the south.</p>
<p>In 2 miles to the north-west and half a mile to the north, with</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 612}</u></p>
<p>a rise of 80 feet, and no great fall, we reached a BOG falling to the
north-west. On running it down for half a mile a tributary valley or bog was
seen to come in from the north, and some high ground could be seen up the
valley. We ran the bog down for about a quarter of a mile further to the west,
and when it turned to the south of west, crossed it. The bog had a broad sheet
of water about 2 feet deep in two channels. It looked very formidable, but
proved easy, as the bottom was sound.</p>
<p>This creek running to the west must be one of the tributaries of the JARDINE
RIVER, and as we passed the Kennedy [Jackey-Jackey] we congratulated ourselves
that there was now nothing to prevent our striking a direct course for
Somerset.</p>
<p>On the right bank of the creek we camped on a stringybark ridge with fair
grass, just at sunset. There were showers while we were pitching the tents.
(CAMP 69.)</p>
<p>March 29. There was RAIN a little before daybreak. The day was dull, but no
rain fell.</p>
<p>Leaving Camp 69, we kept for half a mile to NNE., on the crown of a
well-grassed stringybark ridge, with red soil (derived from sandstone), rising
about 40 feet and falling about 20.</p>
<p>In half a mile to the north-east we crossed a well-grassed valley to a
PANDANUS BOG falling to the west. A scrubby hill, about 200 feet higher,
overlooked the right bank. We ran the BOG up for a quarter of a mile to the
east, and crossed near its head.</p>
<p>In 2 miles to the NE. we crossed a second grassy stringybark ridge with red
soil, and after heading a valley on the left struck a wall of SCRUB, which
forced us for a quarter of a mile to the NW.</p>
<p>For a quarter of a mile to NNE. we kept the crown of a sandstone ridge, and
in half a mile to NE. we dropped down to a gully running west, fringed by a
SCRUB which had to be cut. [This appears to be COWAL CREEK of the Lands
Department Map.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>For 2 miles to the north-east we kept the crown of a dry stony ridge, three
or four hundred feet high, till we reached a gully falling to the east. Here
one of Crosbie's horses ("Pluto") had to be left behind. It was, however,
brought on next morning, and reached Somerset alive.</p>
<p>In 3 miles to the north-east and half a mile to north-west, along stony
red-soil ridges, well grassed and timbered with stringybark and Moreton Bay
ash, we reached a BOG and camped. (CAMP 70.)</p>
<p>The last half of the day's travelling was on the very DIVIDE OF THE
PENINSULA.</p>
<p>When we had camped, I crossed the bog, and found that it fringed a creek of
the third magnitude, running east-north-east. The creek in all probability
falls into the Kennedy Estuary. It was beyond my depth, and it was difficult to
reach it by the bog.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 613}</u></p>
<p>I attempted to reach the creek half a mile further down, but was baffled by
the dense growth of reeds in deep, still water, over a breadth of nearly a
quarter of a mile.</p>
<p>March 30. The whole day was consumed in crossing the BOG, which we did after
travelling for a mile to ENE. on a good, grassy, well-timbered ridge. Where we
crossed, the creek ran east. It was deep and wide, but had a sound bottom.
Tributary bogs came in from the north. We next crossed BOGS AND HEATH for
nearly a mile to east, north-east and west. At the last bog we had very serious
difficulties. The packs had to be carried about a quarter of a mile across
water and rushes, knee deep, the horses standing almost up to their bellies all
the time. RAIN came on in the middle of the operation. Had it continued an
hour, men and horses would probably have been swept down into Newcastle Bay.
Several of the HORSES got BOGGED on being led across with empty saddles. But
for the assistance of the prospectors, "Olive" would never have reached dry
land.</p>
<p>We camped on the edge of a scrub bordering a branch of the swamp. (CAMP
71.)</p>
<p>More RAIN fell after we got into camp.</p>
<p>March 31. The night and day were fine.</p>
<p>After 2 miles of travelling to ENE., over red-soil ridges, occasionally
stony, but well grassed and timbered, Crosbie climbed a tree and saw the
"low-wooded country" (MANGROVES), marked on the chart, BETWEEN the estuaries of
the KENNEDY and ESCAPE RIVERS.</p>
<p>Descending into a valley, we kept for half a mile to WNW. along a belt of
SCRUB, and for half a mile in the same direction to another scrub, which proved
very dense and had to be cut.</p>
<p>In half a mile through SCRUB, down a gentle slope to the NW., we reached a
wet alluvial flat with very long grass. Recent cattle tracks were everywhere
about. One well-beaten track led round the head of the alluvial flat. We
followed it for about a mile from NNW. till it turned to SE., when we left it,
fully convinced that the track did not lead to Somerset.</p>
<p>In half a mile to ENE. we reached the right bank of a fourthmagnitude creek
connecting a chain of water-holes; on running the creek up for a mile to the
north we got hemmed in by scrubs to the left, while the creek to the right was
impassable. We came back for half a mile to the south and camped. (CAMP
72.)</p>
<p>After we had camped I went down to where we had turned off the cattle tracks
and traced them a little further. I found that they crossed the creek within a
quarter of a mile by a good crossing. I found also a good crossing with a hard
gravelly bottom. There were signs that NATIVES had recently been FEASTING ON
BEEF.</p>
<p>There was one heavy shower in the night.</p>
<p>April 1. On crossing the creek near the camp we discovered</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 614}</u></p>
<p>two HUMAN SKELETONS which had been exposed among the branches of fallen
trees. I carried away the skulls and presented them to Baron Maclay, whom I
shortly afterwards met at Thursday Island.</p>
<p>After 2 miles of zigzagging, mainly to the east, we caught sight of TURTLE
ISLAND, bearing E. 15&deg; S.</p>
<p>In half a mile to ENE. we passed a SWAMP on the right. In another mile, to
NE., we passed the remains of an old stockyard and hut&mdash;an out-station on
Mr. Jardine's run called "CHENIUM," about 10 miles from Somerset, as we
afterwards learned. "Chenium" is situated on the right bank of the creek which
we crossed in the morning.</p>
<p>Fully convinced that there must be a recognisable track from the old station
to Somerset, we beat about for some time in search of it. After 3 miles of
zigzag travelling, by cattle tracks of to-day's date, during which we made
about half that distance to the northeast, we reached a swamp and ran to the
north along the edge of it for half a mile, till we were blocked between the
SWAMP and the SCRUB. We came back for half a mile to the south-west and half a
mile to east-south-east till we were again hemmed in between the bog and the
scrub. After some time, however, Crosbie found a track (some years old) leading
to the south-west through the scrub. Following the track we emerged on a white
ridge of BLOWN SAND and got away to the east for a quarter of a mile by the
sand-hill, which wound round the south side of the swamp. The SCRUB, however,
closed over the sand-hill. Crosbie started to clear a way, but desisted on
finding that there was at least a mile of the scrub.</p>
<p>We CAME BACK for half a mile to the south and camped on the edge of a
lagoon. (CAMP 73.)</p>
<p>After we had camped, beginning to comprehend that we might have to reach
Somerset by the beach, I made an excursion to the south-east in the hope of
finding a clear way, but in half a mile was stopped by the closing in of the
SCRUB.</p>
<p>The day was fine and warm.</p>
<p>April 2. While the horses were being mustered in the morning, I went back to
where I had left off yesterday afternoon and penetrated for a quarter of a mile
further through HEATHY SCRUB on sand ridges, and saw from a tree similar scrub
extending for half a mile further, but could not see the sea.</p>
<p>Crosbie followed the creek at "Chenium" up to the north for some distance.
We resolved to make one more attempt to ' reach Somerset by this
<i>route</i>.</p>
<p>Some of the horses had strayed, and we made a late start.</p>
<p>Two miles to the west of the camp we passed the OLD STATION on the left, and
followed the creek up the cattle tracks which sometimes crossed and sometimes
ran in the bed of the creek. In a mile to the north we were hemmed in by a
SCRUB which had</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 615}</u></p>
<p>followed the left bank of the creek. After skirting the scrub for half a
mile to the west till we found that we had penetrated to the end of a "pocket,"
Crosbie and Layland went ahead to look for open country. They penetrated the
scrub for about a mile to NNE. and E. and got away to the east for about half a
mile through open country. When they returned it was too late in the day to cut
the scrub for the questionable advantage of getting away for half a mile to the
east. We followed the creek down (2 miles) and camped at CHENIUM. (CAMP
74.)</p>
<p>Our FLOUR having been EXHAUSTED to-night, I should have pushed on for
Somerset on foot to-morrow, but that the prospectors had a surplus and were
kind enough to share it with us. They gave us seven pannikins, which provided
us with subsistence for a day and a half.</p>
<p>April 3. Resolved to cut our way down to the beach, we left Camp 74, and
passing the site of Camp 73, kept for half a mile down the pocket to the
south-east and a quarter of a mile through the SCRUB in the same direction,
when we passed a SWAMP on the left. In a quarter of a mile to the east we
emerged from the scrub, and crossed a fourth-magnitude creek running to the
southeast, probably the outlet of the bog to the north-east of Chenium.</p>
<p>In a quarter of a mile east through open country we reached a BOG with
mangroves on its further side. When we had run the bog up for a mile to the
north-east, we had to cross from the right to the left bank of the creek of the
fourth magnitude, just above the mangroves. We REACHED THE BEACH in 1 mile to
the east, at a point which bore due west of the black beacon on Z Reef, and
about 7 MILES FROM SOMERSET, which we reached about four o'clock. MR. FRANK
JARDINE made us heartily welcome, and in a few days of good living and cheerful
society we forgot the hardships of our tedious journey.</p>
<p>On the 5th of April I LEFT SOMERSET, accompanied by Love and Charlie, for
THURSDAY ISLAND. The English mail steamer "Bowen" picked us up on the 8th, and
we reached TOWNSVILLE on the 12th. Macdonald was left behind in charge of the
horses. The prospectors also stayed till they should receive instructions from
Brisbane. The PROSPECTORS and MACDONALD left Somerset on the 26th by the
"<i>Corea</i>" with all the horses.</p>
<p>The GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE of the Cape York Peninsula is exceedingly simple.
The backbone or dividing ridge of the Peninsula, which lies close to the
eastern sea-board, consists almost entirely of granite derived from the
metamorphism of slates and greywackes (the equivalents of the auriferous rocks
of the Palmer River). This granite "backbone" rises into lofty mountains in the
McIlwraith, Macrossan, Janet and Carron Ranges. The ranges are generally
flanked by little-altered rocks.</p>
<p>This high ground has formed the shore of the vast sheet of water</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 616}</u></p>
<p>in which the "Desert Sandstone" was deposited. In all probability the
granite stood up as ranges prior to the deposition of the Desert Sandstone by
virtue of its superior hardness to the surrounding unaltered slate and
greywacke rocks. When subsequently a submergence took place, the unaltered
rocks, having been previously denuded into lowlands, were covered over by the
Desert Sandstone. To one travelling northward from the Coleman River, the
sandstone first appears far to the west, but it gradually steals eastward,
lapping round the base of the range till it reaches the eastern sea-board at
Temple Bay.</p>
<p>The sandstone has a very gentle dip to the west and north, away from the
granite&mdash;so gentle that there seems no reason to ascribe it to unequal
upheaval, since the gradual deepening of the bottom on which the sandstone was
deposited, as it receded from the land, is quite sufficient to account for it.
This gentle dip coincides, or nearly coincides, with the fall of the ground
from the ranges to the Gulf, while the Wilkinson, Geikie, Sir William Thomson
and Richardson "Ranges" are the eastern escarpments of massive sandstone beds
[or shelves].</p>
<p>The question of the geological age of the Desert Sandstone, which Daintree
justly characterised as "the most wide-spread sedimentary formation in
Queensland," is a very puzzling one, and much apparently contradictory evidence
has been brought forward on the point. I hope to discuss the whole question
shortly in the pages of a scientific journal. At present I shall only state my
belief that the formation is homotaxial with the European Cretaceous rocks.</p>
<p>There is every reason to believe that the auriferous slates, etc., of the
Palmer district are represented in the Peninsula further north, and may yet
give up their wealth, but they are covered with such a thickness of "Desert
Sandstone" as practically puts them beyond our reach for the present age. The
granitic rocks forming the <i>nuclei</i> of the ranges, especially of the
McIvor and McIlwraith Ranges, are to some extent auriferous, although
apparently not sufficiently so to pay for European labour under the present
conditions. My impression was that the "South Coen" (or Kendall?) and the Peach
could be at least worked with profit by Chinamen. Since the date of our visit
to these rivers, however, the South Coen has been "rushed" by Chinese, who have
returned disappointed, owing, it is said, to the expense of land carriage and
the hostility of the blacks; they never reached the Peach.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted that the Peach was not more exhaustively
prospected. The expedition started at the worst possible time of the year. Only
a very hurried examination had been made when the floods came and rendered
prospecting in the bed of such a river an impossibility. We travelled northward
in the hope of finding payable gold elsewhere, and with the intention</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 617}</u></p>
<p>of trying the Peach again on our return. It turned out, however, that Fair
Cape was the northmost point <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> which offered any
promise of auriferous country, and I felt it my duty to represent to the
Government that that point could be reached from Cooktown at a less expense in
time, money and horseflesh than by recrossing the desert country which had cost
us the lives of so many horses.</p>
<p>The two journeys, whose main incidents have now been related, if they have
not added to the material wealth of the Colony, have, at least, increased our
knowledge of its physical geography, and dispelled much of the mystery which
has hitherto enveloped the geology of the Cape York Peninsula.</p>
<p>I cannot close this narrative without referring gratefully to the assistance
rendered by all my companions. Perseveringly and steadily they gave their whole
energies to the object of their search; and, if they did not succeed in finding
payable gold, it was probably for one or other of two good reasons either it
was not there to find, or the floods of the wet season put it beyond their
reach.</p>

<h4>THE AUTHOR'S EXPLORATIONS, 1879-80, <i>continued</i></h4>
<h4>WITH CROSBIE'S PROSPECTING PARTY</h4>
<h4>"THIRD PRELIMINARY REPORT," A SUMMARY OF EVENTS FROM FALSE ORFORD NESS TO
SOMERSET</h4>
<p>[First officially issued, after having been "Presented to Both Houses," 5th
July, 1881, in <i>Further Reports on the Progress of the Gold-Prospecting
Expedition in Cape York Peninsula</i>&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<h5>RECAPITULATION OF JOURNEY FROM CAMP 58 (13 MARCH) TO SOMERSET (3RD APRIL,
1880). PROJECT OF RETURNING BY LAND ABANDONED.</h5>
<h4>(ANNOTATED REPRINT)</h4>
<h4>THIRD PRELIMINARY REPORT</h4>
<h5>(SEE MAP B.)</h5>
<p>FALSE ORFORD NESS (AMP 58) is an untimbered promontory of horizontal
ferruginous red SANDSTONE, terminating in a cliff of about 50 feet in height.
The sandstone is covered, lightly near the sea, with blown sand, which rises
further inland into HIGH SAND-HILLS. The prospecting and geological parties
spent two days more in recruiting their horses on the good grass and succulent
"pig-weed" of the coast.</p>
<p>On 13th March we travelled by the beach from False Orford Ness to the "RED
CLIFFS" in 11&deg; 12' S. latitude. Between False Orford Ness and ORFORD NESS
proper, low points of sandstone come down at intervals to the sea, but
generally the hills of blown sand begin at high tide mark and extend for miles
inland. BLACKS were seen following on our track at a cautious distance.</p>
<p>In the south bend of ORFORD BAY we found a large salt-water creek, with four
mouths, among mangroves. The eastmost mouth had a thin and treacherous crust of
sand on stiff black clay. Some of the horses were badly bogged, one of them
wetting my maps and papers. Invisible BLACKS were hallooing among the mangroves
while we were engaged in extricating the horses from the mud. At the next mouth
we had to wait for about an hour till the tide,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 619}</u></p>
<p>which had been falling for about an hour previously, had fallen low enough
to allow us to cross. About a mile beyond the last mouth we saw seven or eight
BLACKS who had recently landed from a large CANOE, and met their gins carrying
their luggage overland. Both parties retired into the sand-hills on our
approach.</p>
<p>ORFORD BAY has a broad stretch of sandy beach, bordered with low sand-hills
which extend a long way inland. We camped on the (Low) "RED CLIFFS" of
sandstone marked on the chart in latitude 11&deg; 12' S. (CAMP 59.)</p>
<p>Next day (14th March), as precipitous cliffs frequently overhung the sea, we
had to travel for the most part on the sandstone ledge. Some THICK SCRUBS had
to be cut behind the first tier of sand-hills at the back of the "REMARKABLE
RED CLIFFS." [SEE MAP A.] From this point northward to TURTLE REEF the
sandstone is mostly replaced by a coarse pisolitic rock of sandy-brown
haematite. We camped about a mile south of No. 11 POINT. (CAMP 60.) The next
day (15th March) GALES and heavy RAIN made it impossible to move the camp.</p>
<p>We found good travelling on the 16th March, on the top of high cliffs of
sandstone and pisolite, as far as the bay south of FLAT HILL, where we had to
wait two hours for the fall of the tide at the mouth of a large creek skirted
by mangroves [HENDERSON CREEK]. We camped at night opposite an uncharted
island, on a point bearing S. 26&deg; W. from the south-east end of TERN
ISLAND. (CAMP 61.)</p>
<p>It had now become necessary to leave the coast and strike for the valley of
the Jardine River, with the view of HEADING THE ESCAPE AND KENNEDY. The horses
were indulged with one day's spell before starting. Mr. Crosbie walked to
SHADWELL POINT and saw the ALBANY PASS. Our camp lay about 22 MILES FROM
SOMERSET, and yet we had to make a JOURNEY OF 117 MILES before we could reach
that haven.</p>
<p>On the 18th March we struck inland. The first 4 miles led us WNW. by soft
red-soiled ridges, well timbered with bloodwood, box and stringybark, and well
grassed. Then a ridge of white sand, with a scrub to the left and a lagoon to
the right, carried us a mile to the NW. For 2 miles further (W. 10&deg; N.) we
had low forest country, with narrow belts of scrub, till we came, to our
chagrin, on a small salt-water creek, a branch of the ESCAPE which we had hoped
to head. We had to run the mangrove swamp up for a mile to the SW., when the
salt-water creek was replaced by a deep and narrow fresh-water stream, to whose
left bank we crossed. Shortly afterwards a narrow GULLY had to be substantially
BRIDGED with saplings, but one of the prospectors' horses got off the bridge,
and lightened his burden by DISSOLVING a large quantity of SUGAR, besides
damaging cartridges, clothes, etc.</p>
<p>After 3 miles (W. 10&deg; S.) of well-grassed forest land, we were again
arrested by a MANGROVE SWAMP and camped. (CAMP 62.)</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 620}</u></p>
<p>Mr. Crosbie penetrated this belt of mangroves with much difficulty and saw
the main ESCAPE RIVER [INLET] <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> half a mile in
width, with no perceptible current.</p>
<p>Keeping the mangroves in sight, we ran the inlet up on the following day
(19th March). In 2 miles (S. 10&deg; E.) we saw the last of the mangroves, and
got among the <i>fresh-water</i> heads of the ESCAPE. One narrow creek, flanked
by a PITCHER-PLANT SWAMP, forced us a mile and a half to the east before we
could cross. Rain began here, and continued to fall in torrents for the rest of
the day.</p>
<p>We kept the former course (S. 10&deg; E.), by scrub-capped stony ridges
intersected with pitcher-plant swamps, till we again came on the ESCAPE RIVER,
here running north-north-west. Having followed it up for half a mile through
scrub and brushwood, it bifurcated, and a narrow branch, not fordable, carried
us, through bog and heath, to NNE. After half a mile on this course, we made
for the nearest grass and camped. (CAMP 63.) For two days, in trying to make to
the west, we had only succeeded in describing a horse-shoe bend and it appeared
likely that the flooded branches of the Escape would force us almost to
complete the circle back to our starting-point on the beach.</p>
<p>Next day (20th March) Mr. Crosbie found practicable crossings of the two
branches of the Escape, and got away for about 2 miles west, through low heathy
country, without meeting further obstacles. Heavy rain began to fall and it was
too late to make a start when Mr. Crosbie returned.</p>
<p>Following Mr. Crosbie's tracks of the previous day, we crossed (21st March)
the two branches of the ESCAPE, the packs having to be carried over the larger
branch on a BRIDGE of saplings, while the horses were crossed (just afloat) a
quarter of a mile above. After 2 miles to the west, mostly over bog and heath,
we came to another branch of the Escape, falling north. We ran this creek up to
its head in about 3 miles. For the first half mile a THICK SCRUB had to be cut.
Two miles further to the SW., ACROSS the crown of the DIVIDE, when we were
certain that we were at last on the JARDINE FALL, we camped on the edge of a
swamp. (CAMP 64.)</p>
<p>On 22nd March we started to run the JARDINE VALLEY down till we should be
clear of the Kennedy River or Saltwater Inlet. Early in the day the black boy
detected CATTLE TRACKS and dung only a few months old. We kept the Jardine side
of the divide, which is generally scrubby, and steeper on the eastern than the
western fall. We accomplished 81 miles, for the most part in a WNW. direction,
without meeting any creeks of importance. (CAMP 65.) The next day (23rd March)
we did not move, as there was heavy rain in the morning, and two of the
prospectors' HORSES were on</p>
<blockquote>[1) The Escape River was named by Captain King, R.N. See
<i>Narrative of a Survey of the Tropical and Western Coasts of Australia,
1816-1822</i>. London, Murray, 1827. See 24th July, 1819.&mdash;R. L.

<p>the point of succumbing to the effects of the POISON they had eaten on the
Richardson Range. My own riding horse ("Poodle") had been weak since we came
down to the beach on the 9th March.</p>
<p>On 24th March we ran W. 10&deg; N. for 6 miles; the first 3 miles through
closely timbered grassy country just below the scrubby divide; the second
through heath and wire grass, with pitcher-plant swamps, falling to the south.
One of the latter forced us 2 miles to the north before we could cross it. Here
all uncertainty as to "POODLE'S" FATE was put an end to. He was not expected to
live for more than two days longer, and I had only been riding him occasionally
for some time back. At the swamp I rode for a short stage. Resting my wounded
arm on the stock of the WestleyRichards rifle which was carried on the saddle,
my hand accidentally touched the trigger. The piece must have been cocked just
before, while I was leading the horse through the brushwood. The bullet
shattered the jaw of the unfortunate animal. As he had hardly had a chance of
reaching Somerset alive, even before the accident, his misery was ended by a
second SHOT.</p>
<p>ONE OF MR. CROSBIE'S HORSES, POISONED on the Richardson Range, had also to
be LEFT HERE.</p>
<p>In 5 miles more (W. 10&deg; S.) through poor wire-grass country, with
casuarinas, we found better GRASS, and a boggy gully falling to the south-west,
and camped. (CAMP 66.)</p>
<p>The next day (25th March) we did not move as the horses had strayed, some
not being found till three o'clock. Rain fell heavily from an hour before
daybreak till two in the afternoon.</p>
<p>On 26th March we shaped our course a little north of west. For the first 4
miles we were on the JARDINE side of the divide, but imperceptibly crossed it;
and after running north for threequarters of a mile down the right bank of a
narrow but deep creek, we crossed a tributary gully coming from the east, and
ran the united stream down three-quarters of a mile to the west, still
uncertain whether we were on the Jardine or the Kennedy waters.</p>
<p>In a mile and a half further to the NW., over closely timbered and fairly
grassed country, Mr. Crosbie climbed a high tree, and saw the MANGROVES OF THE
KENNEDY within half a mile to the north. We therefore altered our course to the
SW., and had travelled about three-quarters of a mile when we came to a swamp
fringing a deep canal-like creek running north-north-east, which, it was
thought, we should have to bridge, and we camped. (CAMP 67.) Luckily, however,
a practicable crossing was found about half a mile below the camp, on a
sandstone bar. The mangroves began to appear shortly below the crossing. The
brackish water ran about 40 feet wide and 1 foot deep.</p>
<p>Next morning (27th March} we crossed the creek, and another similar one was
found in the same valley, but was crossed with ease. Believing we had crossed
the head of the Kennedy, we struck</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 622}</u></p>
<p>NW. for a mile, on a stringybark ridge, with a swamp on the left hand
draining into the creek we had last crossed. Keeping on the same course, we
were surprised to find the swamp beginning to fall, without any perceptible
divide, towards a brackish stream, which ran, fringed with mangroves,
sluggishly to the west.</p>
<p>Mr. Crosbie and I, leaving the party behind, advanced about a mile further
to the NW., when we found the main Kennedy River. 1 We struck it at a reach
which seemed about a mile long from east to west. The mangroves made it very
difficult to approach the river, which was about a quarter of a mile in
width.</p>
<p>We had now only one course before us, to run the Kennedy [Jackey-Jackey
Creek] up without going too near it. Our course was again SW., although our
goal lay to the NE. A mile of anxious travelling took us across the swamp,
without mishap, to a stringybark ridge. In 3 miles more (SW.) we came to a
narrow flooded creek with boggy banks, and pitcher plant and pandanus. We ran
it down for a mile and a half to W. and WNW., when the grass gave place to
heath, and we came back for half a mile and camped. (CAMP 68.) About a mile
below the camp the creek was found to turn to the north-east. A few sea-shells
were seen in a NATIVE CAMP, from which we concluded that we were not far from
the head of the tide. The creek would be fordable here provided that it should
fall a little in the night; but that seemed hardly probable, as there had been
rain for the greater part of the day.</p>
<p>March 28th. The prospectors' horses had again scattered and were not found
till near midday. The crossing we had had in view the previous night was found
impracticable, as the creek had risen. Mr. Crosbie succeeded in finding
another. While the horses were being sought for, he and I crossed the creek and
went ahead about a mile to WNW. On the way back he stopped to improve the
crossing, when a very heavy shower came on and in a few minutes swelled the
creek to such an extent that the ford was no longer available. When the horses
were at length brought up all hands set to work, and we had crossed the creek
by a substantial log BRIDGE in less than two hours. With the exception of two
boggy gullies crossed later in the day, this creek turned out to be the LAST OF
THE KENNEDY WATERS which lay on our course. In 5 miles to WNW., just at sunset,
we crossed a sheet of water running to the west, nearly a quarter of a mile
wide and 2 feet deep. Fortunately it had a sand bottom, and we found grass on
the north side, after having seen nothing but heath for the last 2 miles. (CAMP
69.)</p>
<p>March 29. Our supply of FLOUR is visibly COMING TO AN END. Including
to-day's, we have five days' rations of one and a quarter pounds for four
men.</p>
<p>We travelled 11&frac12; miles to-day, mainly NNE., on grassy ridges timbered
with stringybark, and occasionally scrubby. The country</p>
<blockquote>[1) JACKEY-JACKEY CREEK, the principal feeder of KENNEDY
INLET.&mdash;R. L. J.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 623}</u></p>
<p>was composed of ferruginous sandstones, giving rise to a red soil. We
reached an elevation of about 400 FEET above the sea-level, and were evidently
for the greater part of the day following the DIVIDE OF THE PENINSULA. We
camped at sundown on the south side of a swamp. (CAMP 70.)</p>
<p>It took the whole of the 30th March to cross the swamp. A strong stream was
running to the east. Having run it down for a mile, a crossing-place was found;
but OUR DIFFICULTIES were only BEGINNING. A network of tributary SWAMPS still
lay between us and the solid land. In one swamp the horses had to be left for
over an hour nearly up to their girths in water, while the packs were carried
for a quarter of a mile across stagnant water and rushes knee-deep. Rain came
on in the middle of this operation, but did not continue long. If it had, we
should have been fortunate indeed had we managed to reach Newcastle Bay on a
raft. Several of the HORSES GOT BOGGED in crab-holes, on being led over with
empty saddles. But for the timely assistance of Mr. Crosbie's party, the mare
lost on the Richardson Range, and recovered with so much difficulty, would have
stuck fast for the last time. We camped on a grassy ridge on the northern edge
of the bog, about a mile from our last camp; both horses and men more fatigued
than they would have been by 20 miles of ordinary travelling. (CAMP 71.)</p>
<p>March 31st. We thought ourselves at length in a position to make straight
for Somerset, as we were not aware of any further difficulties in our way.
After travelling 2 miles ENE., over sound red-soil ridges, well grassed and
timbered, but occasionally stony, we descended into a valley, and were forced
to WNW. by belts of SCRUB, and had finally to cut through half a mile of dense
scrub on a NW. course. On emerging from the scrub we found a marshy alluvial
flat, with a well-beaten CATTLE TRACK. We followed the latter for nearly a
mile, on a horse-shoe bend from NNW. to NE. and SE. till we arrived at a chain
of LAGOONS, connected by a narrow stream running SSE. We ran this up without
finding a crossing for about a mile, when, getting hemmed in between a scrub
and bog, we came back half a mile and camped in a grassy pocket. (CAMP 72.)</p>
<p>A ford was found near the camp, and we crossed on the morning of 1st April
and got away for 3 miles to the east, zigzagging by cattle tracks, among ridges
with brigalow scrub. We found two NATIVE SKELETONS exposed among the limbs of
fallen trees, one on each side of the creek, together with evidence that a
corroborree on a very large scale had been held in honour of the deceased.</p>
<p>In half a mile further to ENE. we passed a swamp to the right, and in a mile
further (NE.) the remains of an OLD STOCKYARD AND HUT beside a swampy creek,
called in the native language CHENIUM (<i>Pandanus</i>). A mile and a half to
the NE. brought us to a swamp which we could neither cross nor get round. We
tried it to right and left, but were stopped both ways by a scrub on the one
hand</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 624}</u></p>
<p>and the swamp on the other. The east end of the swamp abutted on scrubby
hills of BLOWN SAND. We were obliged to camp in the evening on a lagoon among
the sand-hills, about a mile east of Chenium Stockyard. (CAMP 73.)</p>
<p>2nd April. Some of the horses had strayed in the night, and a late start was
made. The whole day was consumed in a fruitless attempt to clear the swamp
which had baffled us yesterday, by cutting through or rounding the scrub to the
west. We returned to Chenium Stockyard and camped. Our FLOUR being EXHAUSTED,
we borrowed 7 lb. more from the prospectors&mdash;rations for a day and a half.
(CAMP 74.)</p>
<p>3rd April. As we were now far enough north to be clear of the Kennedy and
all its branches, and had not found an inland path to Somerset, we resolved to
cut our way down to the east coast. Starting from Camp 73 we found open country
for about half a mile to south-east. Half a mile further to the east, hewing
our way through the scrub on the sand-hills, we emerged on a bog, whose further
side was skirted with mangroves. The bog had to be run up for about a mile
north-east, when we crossed to the left bank of a narrow creek just above the
mangroves. Another mile east, through scrub and heath, brought us to the BEACH
at a point bearing due west from the beacon on the Z REEF, about 7 miles from
Somerset. About 4 p.m. we REACHED SOMERSET and were hospitably welcomed by MR.
FRANK JARDINE.</p>
<p>Our difficulties were at an end. Our hopes of enriching the Colony by
finding a payable goldfield in the northern part of the Peninsula had,
unhappily, ended long before. A small portion of the Peninsula, which the
severity of the wet season rendered inaccessible for the time being, still
remains to be explored. MR. DONALD LAING, who led a private prospecting party
into the Peninsula in November last, and who has just returned to Cooktown worn
out and ill, entertains hopes of SEFTON CREEK, the northmost point reached by
him (about 13&deg; 10' S. latitude). MR. R. SEFTON and a party of the Coen
pioneers prospected on this creek about two years ago, with but limited
success. I meant to examine it on the way back, had I returned overland, but
taking into consideration what I have since learned of the sterility of the
country between Sefton Creek and Somerset, I have no hesitation in deciding
that it can be reached much better by making a fresh start from
Cooktown&mdash;an economy in time, money and horseflesh.</p>
<p>A detailed account of the geological results of the expedition is in
preparation, and will be accompanied by a map in which the geography of the
Peninsula will be brought up to date.</p>

<p><b>GEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS. HORIZONTAL SANDSTONES OF DIFFERENT AGES IN
CONTACT. EMERGENCE OF PAL&AElig;OZOIC ROCKS FROM BENEATH SANDSTONES AT VARIOUS
POINTS NEAR CAPE YORK. THE EXPEDITION HELPED TO GUIDE LATER
PROSPECTORS.</b></p>
<p>THE "simplicity" of the geological structure of the Cape York Peninsula is
possibly more apparent than real. Subsequent observations, and especially those
made in 1902 by Mr. C. F. V. Jackson, of the Geological Survey, lead me to
suspect that there may be a mixture of sandstones of Carboniferous with others
of Cretaceous age. One bed of horizontal siliceous sandstone is very like
another, and in some instances I may have assumed continuity where there was
only juxtaposition, and faulting may have placed beds of similar composition
and appearance together. The complex structure of "The Brothers" and the
"Little (Kennedy) River," near Cooktown, may be repeated further to the north,
and detailed geological surveying in the future may yet reveal distinctions
unsuspected by me in the year 1880. The fact, however, remains indisputable
that the great bulk of the northern part of the Peninsula is covered by
arenaceous sedimentary rocks, whatever their age may be.</p>
<p>My observations at Cape York ended with the arrival of the party at
Somerset, as my physical condition, following on my wound, imperatively
demanded rest. Otherwise I might have learned that no more than 6 miles to the
west, in the low "Carnegie range," as well as at Cape York, at Peak Point and
in Possession Island, Pal2eozoic rocks, potentially auriferous, emerge from
beneath horizontal sandstones of a later age.</p>
<p>As will appear from subsequent chapters, I am justified in believing that my
reports on the "First" and "Second" Expeditions helped to guide a generation of
hardy and persevering prospectors to discoveries of gold and other metals as
far to the north as Temple Bay. There is no reason to suppose that the record
of progress is closed.</p>

<p>DONALD LAING was already well known as a prospector when I arrived in
Queensland in 1877.</p>
<p>Immediately after my return from the first expedition the Cooktown
Prospecting Association equipped a party consisting of Donald Laing (Leader),
Tom Johnson, W. Small, Charles Turner, Andrew Stewart and "Soldier Jim" (James,
brother of William jack?) to prospect the Peach River and other localities in
which I had reported the presence of gold. The object was to anticipate
Crosbie's Government-aided party. The following account of the trip is abridged
from Laing's report, as published in the <i>Cooktown Courier</i> of loth April,
1880, of which I had fortunately kept a copy, and supplemented by a few notes
in my possession.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"After leaving COOKTOWN on Nov. 13th [1879] we
arrived at BATTLE CAMP on the 21st and left again on the 23rd...[SEE MAP E.]
Crossed the Kennedy; no water beyond; compelled to go right On to SALTWATER
CREEK, Or WARNER CREEK. Here we saw a few BLACKS, but they never interfered
with us, nor we with them. Camped on the north bank of the STEWART RIVER.
Started again and made an old camp on the Coen road; came across MR. JACKS CAMP
[my Camp 36 (I) of 8th September, 1879, on the LITTLE STEWART RIVER.&mdash;R.
L. J.] and pushed on to water...Arrived early next morning (December 4) at the
LOG HUT on the so-called COEN. [SEE MAP C.] [See Jack, 9th September, 1879.]
Spelled the horses a few days, and made a survey for a track to go north; party
and horses all well.<br>
<br>
"We LEFT THE COEN on Monday, late in the afternoon, and made for a small spring
I found the day previous. Next morning, while I was mustering the horses, the
BLACKS appeared near the camp. After loading up, we took our final departure
for further north; course Ni-W. [probably down CROLL CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.]. We
reached, after passing over 16 miles of poor teatree country, a muddy creek;
water</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 627}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">very scarce, hardly enough for ourselves and horses,
but deemed it prudent to stay overnight, as a thick scrub ran close to the
creek.<br>
<br>
<p>"Started next day through poor scrubby country and sandy soil, and arrived
at a large creek, or river, supposed to be either the SINCLAIR or NEW YEAR
CREEK. Kept pushing on till we came across another large creek, supposed to be
KINLOCH CREEK. [Probably BOURNE CREEK. Laing made three bad guesses in his
attempt to identify the creeks named by the Jardine Brothers far to the
west.&mdash;R. L. J.]. Camped on the north bank and prospected it, but found no
colours.<br>
<br>
"Next morning made another start, still steering the same course, and came
across a fine large river, which we took for the ARCHER OR PEACH RIVER.
[Probably near my crossing of the river, south of Camp 40 (I), 16th September,
1879.&mdash;R. L. J.] Prospected it, but could get no gold. Not satisfied with
this trial, ran up the river half a mile to where it was bare. Prospected the
bars, but not a colour. Crossed to the north beach and prospected it, with the
same result. So we packed up tools.<br>
<br>
"About 4 miles north of the Archer, we came across a creek [BEETLE CREEK?R. L.
J.], which we believe empties itself near Pera Head. [Whatever it was, it must
have been a tributary of the Peach.&mdash;R. L. J.] Prospected it, but found no
gold, the bottom being soft.<br>
<br>
"The party here differed with me, some wanting to return to the Coen, believing
this to be the Peach. I contended it must be further north, as I could not see
the slightest indication of auriferous country east, west or south.<br>
<br>
"We pushed on [presumably north.&mdash;R. L. J.] over miserable scrubby
country, until we came to a nice creek of running water, which runs into the
Archer, having seen to the south the low hills described by Mr. Jack [I am at a
loss to identify the low hills referred to.&mdash;R. L. J.], camping on good
feed, distant about 55 miles from the misnamed Coen.<br>
<br></p>
<p>"Started north again over poor broken country, without water, at last
reaching a spring in a hard granite creek, where we camped. We saw no blacks
after leaving the Coen.<br>
<br></p>
<p>"Next morning we made for a low gap that appeared in the range. [On 23rd
December, 1879, my party crossed the tracks of Laing's horses, going up (E. by
S.) the 'second-magnitude creek' referred to in my diary of that date. On the
21st a shot had been heard from our Camp 13 on the Peach, opposite 'View Hill.'
If Laing crossed the gap at the head of the 'second-magnitude creek,' he would
come down into my Irvine Creek. (On the 24th December, 1879, on our second
trip, we again came on LAING'S TRACKS between IRVINE AND BEETLE
CREEKS.)&mdash;R. L. J.]<br>
<br>
"Crossed over granite country, took a good survey and then ran down to a flat;
crossed it and reached a large river or creek, unnamed, which, for the sake of
illustration we will call Sefton River, as we found one of their [Sefton's
party's.&mdash;R. L. J.] old camps there. [<i>Not</i>, of course, the SEFTON
CREEK, a tributary of the Batavia River, which I named on 24th January, 18So,
the name having been suggested by the discovery of an old camp, supposed to be
one of Sefton's. The creek which Laing reached after crossing the gap was
probably my BEETLE CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.]<br>
<br>
"Did not spend much time here, as we intended to run up the creek when we came
back. Crossed over, intending to camp on the north bank, but found the country
had not been burnt, consequently no good feed; so we pushed on, thinking to get
good feed and water under the range, but were disappointed. Had to go over the
DIVIDING RANGE [presumably the divide between Beetle and Christmas Creeks or
the head of the Peach.&mdash;R. L. J.] when we entered into fine-looking
AURIFEROUS COUNTRY, but could not find a drop of water to prospect. We crossed
several beautiful gullies, red soil country with plenty of ironstone, a good
indication for gold. Could not try any of the gullies, for WANT OF WATER. Being
late in the afternoon, we pushed on, running up a low spur until we came to a
little opening. Here a creek appeared to the east. We got down to it, weary and
tired, and found WATER. [Christmas CREEK?&mdash;R. L. J.] Did a little
prospecting that afternoon, and found strong colours of nice GOLD within 200
yards of the junction with another creek. [The head of</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 628}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">the PEACH 1&mdash;R. L. J.] I then ran up the other
creek [the PEACH l&mdash;R. L. J.] for about 3 miles, when it became too steep
to carry gold, unless I ran up till it came to the level again. I got back to
camp at dark. I regret not being able to run up this creek, as I feel confident
that this was the run of the gold belt. I believe it would run up 5 or 6 miles
into dry country. The creek we camped on [BEETLE CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.] carried
as heavy wash as any on the Palmer. It reminded me of the Three-Mile Beach on
the Palmer. Water was very scarce. I reckon we were from 7 to so miles from the
WATERSHED [of the Peninsula.&mdash;R. L. J.]. We camped all day and tried to
get more water, but found none.<br>
<br>
"Started next morning and ran N.IW., thinking to cut Mr. Jack's track, but
could see no sign of it. [We were then south of Laing's party.&mdash;R. L.
J.]<br>
<br>
"We ran on until we reached the fork of a large river, with no name, which we
will call Sullivan River, supposed to run towards Duyfken Point. [One of the
heads of the PEACH RIVER l&mdash;R. L. J.] The feed was poor, and no
indications. Prospected both branches of the fork, but could not get any
colours.<br>
<br>
"This iS AS FAR AS WE WENT. Dense SCRUB to the north. The party, not willing to
go any further, determined to return and prospect the [so-called
Sefton.&mdash;R. L. J.] river before mentioned. I reckon we were about 85 miles
north of the log hut and about 20 miles from the original Coen. Camped. [The
log hut is practically at the 'original Coen' diggings and about 20 miles SW.
of Laing's position. He may have travelled 85 miles.&mdash;R. L. J.]<br>
<br>
"Commenced our RETURN JOURNEY next morning, and arrived at Sefton River, where
the gold was first discovered [i.e., what Laing called the SEFTON RIVER, which
I take to be BEETLE CREEK.&mdash;R. L. J.]. Ran it up, crossed our outward
track until we came to broken country, the ridges coming close to the river.
Here we prospected, and Soldier Jim found COLOURS in the adjoining gullies
south of this river.<br>
<br>
"Next morning, followed it to the eastward till it wheeled right round to the
SE. Followed it on till all of a sudden it turned south into broken country.
Knocked about trying to find a crossing, but could not find one, the bank being
so steep. Had to cut the banks away to get the horses over. This is a
likely-looking country for gold, but we found none. Yet I believe gold will be
found in the vicinity.<br>
<br>
"We then proceeded SE. until late in the afternoon, and lost the good
indication of gold, travelling on without water until we came to the left-hand
branch of the ARCHER, supposed Peach, River. Prospected the creeks running into
it, but found no gold. Prospected the supposed Peach all the afternoon. Got no
gold. By putting the compass on the bank of this river, I found it ran
NW.-SE."</blockquote>
<p>[The party emerged, therefore, on the SE.&mdash;NW. reach of the river which
extends from Birthday Mount to the point where the river breaches the Geikie
Range, and flows west. It is incidentally mentioned that in one portion of
their return journey they "proceeded SE.," but, as this direction would have
brought them to the Pacific coast instead of to the Peach River, the conclusion
is that the course given is erroneous; perhaps the back sight was read instead
of the front, and the actual direction was NW. It will be noted that as soon as
the party got on gold they "pushed on" or "proceeded." Distances, however, are
left for the reader to conjecture, and in the one instance where the direction
is given it is obviously incorrect. I conclude that from the time they left to
the time they returned to the Peach they were mainly on IRVINE and BEETLE
CREEKS, and touched CHRISTMAS CREEK and the upper reaches of the PEACH itself,
but that they never were on the divide of the Peninsula.&mdash;R. L. J.] The
narrative, describing</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 629}</u></p>
<p>another traverse of the Mcllwraith Range, probably between ATTACK and IRVINE
CREEKS, Continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Crossed next morning and ran eastward [They must
have camped on the SW. side of the river.&mdash;R. L. J.] till we could go on
no further for SCRUB. All made country; fine pine trees growing on the highest
ridges, ioo feet high r artistically hung with lawyers, supplejacks, and all
the tormentors known to prospectors. Got through a heavy patch of SCRUB, with
much difficulty, and found OUR OLD TRACKS again. The BLACKS made their
appearance, but did not molest us. Went on a little further, and camped.<br>
<br>
"As soon as I got into the camp, I made for the highest hill, and I could trace
the PEACH RIVER running right into the main ARCHER [i.e., he, correctly,
surmised that the Peach and Archer were the same river.&mdash;R. L. J.]. On
arriving at the camp, we found we had lost our knives and sundries. Messrs.
Small and Turner went in search of them, and were out all night; arrived in the
morning; no success. Saw lots of BLACKS&mdash;fine stalwart men, but they did
not offer to interfere, so we left well alone, they directing us to a gap in
the ridge. Had we fired at them it would have been impossible for us to escape,
as we were hemmed in.<br>
<br>
"Came back about 3 miles and crossed a saddle and got into a flat country.
Still anxious to cut Jack's track, we proceeded eastward, and came across
SEFTON AND PARTY'S LAST CAMP, where we camped. [They must have been all the
time north of the track of my party's first expedition. We did not see this
camp of Sefton's.&mdash;R. L.J.]<br>
<br>
"Started next morning. Kept going cast, until SCRUB became very heavy, through
low, sandy country. Resolved to RETURN and catch the old crossing of the
Archer. Camped.<br>
<br>
"Next morning ran old course, S.&frac14;E., until we came to scrubby point. We
then resolved to run south to strike the Coen, 10 miles down. Crossed the
various rivers mentioned on our outward trip till we arrived back again on the
COEN, just as the WET SEASON SET IN properly. We remained here during the wet.
Thinking the weather had broken up, I resolved to return to Cooktown, leaving
the rations with Messrs. Turner, Small and Soldier Jim, taking only sufficient
to enable Stewart and myself to RETURN TO COOKTOWN. [This was probably on 30th
December, 1879, on which date, as recorded in the diary of my second
expedition, the wet season set in, my party being then at Camp 17A, on a head
of the Peach River, 22 miles NE. of the Coen Township.&mdash;R. L. J.]<br>
<br>
"Thus ended our unsuccessful and unprofitable trip. I was disappointed in my
expectations of the party chosen. We did not pull well together, and were
therefore unable to accomplish what I intended and expected, but it cannot now
be helped. I did my best for the public and myself, and I am the greatest
sufferer.<br>
<br>
"My candid opinion is that a belt of auriferous country exists north of Sefton
River [what he called Sefton River, probably Beetle Creek.&mdash;R. L. J.], and
a party going out in May would probably find a payable field. The country was
too dry when we visited it to do any good. Had there been water we would not
have left. Yet at the same time I would not advise any private party to go out
unless assisted by Government. We considered it unsafe to stay there during the
wet season, as the country was bad enough in dry weather to travel. It is
probable that it Mr. Jack's party comes across that country they will find
payable gold, as they will have plenty of water. [We touched on the country
referred to, and, although we got prospects of GOLD, we were unsuccessful
because the wet season gave us more than enough of water.&mdash;R. L. J.]<br>
<br>
"My experience has taught me that when we started it was the worst possible
time to have chosen, as during the wet the flies were something terrific, we

<blockquote class="inline">keep fires lighted all day for the sake of the
horses, to prevent them tearing themselves to pieces. The howling gusts and
heavy rain, coming from the Gulf of Carpentaria, were something terrible. I
never put in such a miserable time before, and would be sorry to be out there
for another wet season. On my return from the Coen, I had two narrow escapes
from SPEARS, one grazing my shoulder and another dropping between my
legs."</blockquote>

<p>MR. EMBLEY 1 is a Licensed Surveyor, who for many years was attached to the
Queensland Department of Lands. In 1884, he and WILLIAM CLARKE, with three
others, left the Hann River, south of Princess Charlotte Bay, and made a long
journey westward almost to the Gulf of Carpentaria, northward to what is now
known as the Kendall River, north-eastward to the South Coen River and eastward
to the then deserted township at the Coen diggings and to Lalla Rookh
Station.</p>
<p>The expedition covered a great deal of new country, and its geographical
results were valuable because of the survey which Mr. Embley carried on as he
went. He has been good enough to write for my information an account of the
journey, which is given below, and to which I have added some notes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We started from a point on what was then known as
the HANN OR BASALT RIVER, and is now known as the MOREHEAD RIVER,E some time in
May, 1884. [SEE MAP E.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[1) Born at Castlemaine, Victoria, in 1858.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) The start appears to have been made from a point about a mile
below the junction of the river which Mulligan, on his fifth trip in 1875,
named the Hann River, and near Mulligan's Camp 80. The rush to the Coen
alluvial diggings in 1878 had been succeeded by the pastoral occupation of a
good part of the land between the diggings and Cooktown, and the new-corners
knew little of and cared less for the names given to rivers by their early
explorers. The Hann River became the Basalt&mdash;I have often wondered why, as
it is innocent of basalt or any other igneous rock. Mr. Embley explains that at
the crossing of the river by the Cooktown-Lakefield-Coen diggings track there
is a bed of honeycombed sandstone, and as this has been blackened, perhaps by
contact with vegetation and salt water, it may have been mistaken for
basalt.<br>
<br>
In 1886, the construction of the Cape York Telegraph line brought to light the
branch of the Hann which was named the Morehead River, flowing from the
south-west, while the branch flowing from the south was permitted to retain the
name of Hann. The Morehead being the larger of the two branches, is considered
to be the "main" river, and the conjoined Morehead and Hann bears the name of
Morehead down to the salt water at the head of Princess Charlotte Bay. Thus it
has come about that the river named the Hann by Mulligan bears, and must
continue to bear, the <i>de facto</i> name of Morehead, while the name of Hann
is borne by a branch which Mulligan never crossed.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 632}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">Our course was about due west, and after climbing
some low granite ridges we found ourselves on the western fall. [Sea R'IAP F.]
Before we reached the COLEMAN RIVER, the granite country changed to schistose.
This river had a fairly wide sandy bed, with very low banks, and water-holes
far between and small. After running it down for about 6 miles, about south, we
followed it down on a westerly course to a point about 30 miles from the Gulf
(approx. 142&deg; 8' E.). The river was well defined until we reached this
point, but here it began to get very small, the flood waters evidently flowing
in all directions over the flat country. (The same thing happens with the other
Gulf rivers, the Lukin, Edward, Alice, Mitchell, Staten and Red.) The country
bordering the river all the way down was poor, the undulating schistose
formation changing to Desert Sandstone and very flat sandy country, chiefly
timbered with teatree.<br>
<br>
"Nothing particular happened while we ran the river down, except an occasional
brush with the blacks. The BLACKS on the Gulf Coast make very poor provision
against the wet season. They either employ bent sheets of messmate bark or arch
some sheets of teatree bark over a frame formed by a few bent sticks. Their
practice in this respect contrasts strongly with that of the Princess Charlotte
Bay natives, who sleep in well-constructed bee-hive gunyahs, designed to
protect them from mosquitoes. For this latter purpose the Gulf natives
construct a fragile platform, or often two platforms, of sticks forming a sort
of two-story sleeping-place without walls. The lower platform is occupied by
the gin, whose duty it is to keep up the smoke-generating smouldering fire. The
man reposes on the upper platform, reaping the benefit of the smoke but taking
no part in the work.<br>
<br>
"Leaving the COLEMAN, we turned NORTH, passing over the same kind of flat sandy
teatree country until within a mile and a half of the Edward River, when the
country changed to grassy open box flats, with very hard grey soil.<br>
<br>
"The EDWARD RIVER, which I named after my brother Dr. Edward Embley, of
Melbourne, was, where we cut it, about 40 yards wide, with low banks, and
contained some fairly good rocky water-holes, the rock being Desert Sandstone.
It runs from east to west and enters the Gulf, after splitting up, in the low
flat sandy teatree country, into several channels, in about 14&deg; 45'
latitude? We followed it down to the sea and returned to where we first struck
it. The box flats border the river on both sides for a considerable distance,
but before reaching the head of the river the country becomes poor. The head
(approx. 142&deg; 30' E.) is on flat country, in a pebbly
ironstone-conglomerate formation with very little grass and timbered with
quinine bush and teatree.<br>
<br>
"On our way up the river from its mouth, we came across an ironwood tree,
marked J (an old mark), on the bank of a small channel. This may have been one
of the Jardines' midday camps. "It is not uncommon in this region to see a
group of small tree-stumps with the roots uppermost, stuck in the middle of a
swamp and forming a sort of platform. In the neighbourhood of the Edward River
we found the explanation of this singular arrangement. The roots are used for
the support of corpses. On one occasion we saw three, each done up in a
well-tied covering of folds of teatree bark. Presumably the idea is to protect
the relics from dingoes, ants, etc.<br>
<br>
"Continuing north from where we had first struck the Edward, we passed first
across box flats and then over a stretch of sandy country until we came within
a mile of the LUKIN RIVER,2 when grassy box flats were again met with. In the
Lukin we</blockquote>
<blockquote>[1) About three miles north of the Jardine Brothers' Camp 50
(1864).&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) So named by Mulligan in 1875, but it had already been named the
Holroyd River by the Brothers Jardine in 1864.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 633}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">found fine large water-holes, some of which appeared
to be permanent. The channel was in sandstone rock and was about 40 yards in
width, and well defined, but the banks were low.<br>
<br>
"The Lukin country was similar to that of the Edward; box flats to the east and
poor sandy country westwards towards the coast.<br>
<br>
"Away from the rivers in this flat country there is very little chance of
getting any water. Sometimes one has to tap the trees for DRINKING WATER,
particularly on the Lower Alice country. The water from the trees has a
somewhat mawkish taste.<br>
<br>
"The Lukin River drains a large area of country about the main divide, and
after coming down from the range, passes through some fairly well-grassed
country, which extends a few miles on either side, principally on the south.
Lower down, however, the river passes through poor country till it reaches the
box flats previously mentioned. From our camp on the Lukin we made traverses up
the river to the east and down to the west.<br>
<br>
"Continuing our journey northward from where we first struck the Lukin, we
began by crossing box flats bordering the river and then gradually got into low
sand-ridge country, which continued until we reached the KENDALL RIVER.<br>
<br>
"Here the river has a permanent stream of clear water about 3 feet deep between
high banks about 30 yards apart. It was difficult to find an easy crossing, so
we travelled easterly up the stream, passing over very poor country for some
miles till we reached a waterfall with a drop of about 16 feet. In the pool
below the fall the water was so clear that we could distinctly see fishes and
water-snakes swimming about."</blockquote>
<p>[The river to which Mr. Embley gave the name of the Kendall is undoubtedly
the most important water-course of the region in which it occurs. The Jardine
Brothers' <i>route</i> north of the mouth of the Holroyd River was considerably
to the west of his, and he believed that he had identified their "Kendall
Creek." The river named the Kendall by Mr. Embley has become, beyond the
possibility of alteration, the Kendall River, <i>de facto</i>, but I am by no
means satisfied that it is the Jardine Brothers' Kendall Creek, <i>de
jure</i>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1885, Mr. Embley traversed his "Kendall River" down for
about 10 miles (westward) below the point where he had crossed it in 1884.
Between Mr. Embley's work and the Gulf, the continuation of the river is
conjectural, the map showing a dotted line running west-north-west, and I am
informed that the dotted line was so drawn to connect the river with an
indentation of the coast shown on the Admiralty Chart. The chart in question,
it may be remarked, is on a small scale and the indentation is very vague and
sketchy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Brothers Jardine and Richardson, their Surveyor, were
travelling by different <i>routes</i>, in this part of their course, and their
narratives are hard to reconcile. My conscientious analysis of their
narratives, followed by a painstaking plotting of their <i>routes</i>, inclines
me to the theory that Embley's Kendall River must have split up on the coastal
flat, below the westmost point to which he traced it, and is represented by the
Jardines' Thalia Creek" and "Tidal Inlet," while what they called "Kendall
Creek" is what appears on the modern map (Sheet 20D)</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 634}</u></p>
<p>as" Sinclair Creek," some 8 miles north-west of where Mr. Embley saw the
last of the river (at its nearest to the Gulf) towards the end of 1885.</p>
<p>Again, I believe that what the Jardine Brothers called "Sinclair Creek" is
about 12 miles north-east of what is called "Sinclair Creek" on the 4-mile
map.</p>
<p>The historical importance of the location of the Brothers' <i>route</i>
would justify a survey of the Kendall River, de facto, from where Mr. Embley
left off down to the sea, by whatever channel or channels. A survey from the
coast up could not be recommended. It would be very unsatisfactory when dealing
with a coastal plain which is a delta common to numerous anastomosing river
mouths.&mdash; R. L. J.]</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"From the falls on the Kendall River, we travelled
north-easterly across a Desert Sandstone tableland timbered with bloodwood and
teatree and poorly grassed. [SEE MAPS D AND C. It is from this tableland, or
belt of country, that the Kendall gets its generous supply of water, as all the
little creeks in the locality were running strongly, whilst the river channel
to the eastward of the tableland is very dry. The beds of these running or
'spring' creeks consist of a whitish or grey sandstone, and I have noticed in
other parts of the Peninsula that this particular kind of sandstone is
generally associated with, or is the mother rock of, the so-called 'desert'
country, and is full of creeks having a permanent flow of very clear water.<br>
<br>
"After travelling about 54 or 15 miles to the north-east, we reached the
eastern escarpment of the tableland&mdash;a precipitous fall of about 250 feet,
the loose masses of sandstone making the descent very difficult. The
well-grassed valley (of a stream which is a tributary of the Coen) into which
we descended was very welcome on account of the condition of our horses. It was
sparsely timbered with box, gum and mimosa, and the soil was a rich dark
brown.<br>
<br>
"This class of country extends from the point we had now reached to a few miles
north of the Batavia River, or from lat. 14&deg; to lat. 12&deg; 20' (about 1
to miles), with its greatest width of about 50 miles in lat. 13&deg;, and
tapering down towards its northern and southern ends. The area contains patches
of inferior country, principally sandy forest on pebbly conglomerate and ridges
of sandstone. The country has a thick growth of grass, but the&mdash;usually
prolonged&mdash;wet season, followed by heavy dews, causes rankness. The
practice of graziers is to burn the grass early in June, and as the dews
generally last until early in August, a second growth (or 'burnt feed,' as it
is called) is assured. This is good feed for stock until the thunder-storms set
in&mdash; very often in October.<br>
<br>
"We continued our north-easterly course, over good country, and about so miles
from the escarpment struck a recent dray track, which we subsequently learned
was made by MASSY BROTHERS, of LALLA ROOKII, who were then forming an
out-station which they named ROKEBY, situated a few miles westward of where we
cut the track. This out-station is now known as 4 OLD ROKEBY,' the brothers
having formed ANOTHER ROKEBY STATION (now their head station) on the SOUTH CORN
RIVER, about ro miles further north.<br>
<br>
"We were now within a few days' march of good living, and as it was observed
that the dray had returned to the east, we followed its track&mdash;practically
up the COEN RIVER to the then deserted Coen diggings, about 9 miles south-east
of which we reached LALLA ROOKII STATION.<br>

degree of accuracy. Had the incidents been fewer, the task would have been
easier. My work for some years after this trip lay chiefly in the Lower Gulf

<h4>JACK RIVER</h4>
<p>WHAT may be called "The question of the JACK RIVER," arising, to begin with,
out of my "first" (1879) expedition, may be conveniently discussed in
connection with Mr. Embley's surveys of the Princess Charlotte Bay group of
rivers. (SEE MAP E.)</p>
<p>During a brief visit to my headquarters at Townsville on the conclusion of
my "first" trip in the Cape York Peninsula, in October, 1879, I forwarded to
the Mines Department in Brisbane a SKETCH-MAP showing the rivers, creeks, etc.,
traversed by me between what I had named the Starcke River and the Peach
(Archer) River. The map showed also my route and the routes which had been
followed by previous explorers, such as Hann and Mulligan. There was no time to
write a full report of the first trip before I set out on the second.<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> The report on both trips was written in Townsville in
June, 1880, after my return from the second trip, which ended at Somerset on
3rd April, 1880.</p>
<p>While actually engaged in writing the full report, I received from Brisbane
a school map prepared by the Department of Lands for the Department of
Education, embodying the new geographical features which I had sketched, and
the fact is mentioned</p>
<blockquote>[1) The sketch-map was never published, and has apparently been
lost. Recent searches in the Mines, Lands and Education Departments have failed
to discover it.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 637}</u></p>
<p>in a footnote to my diary under the date 26th August, 1879. I was not then
aware that there had also been officially published a new issue of the 16-mile
map of Queensland containing the same data.</p>
<p>After leaving the Starcke River in 1879, I had struck, in lat. 14&deg; 47'
S. and long. 144&deg; 38' E., the head of a creek which I followed down (Camps
22-24) westward to 144&deg; 20' E. Because my horses almost perished for want
on this portion of the journey, I named the water-course "DESERT CREEK." The
name of the creek and the words "Jack's Route" were written on my sketch-map on
parallel lines, and, for some reason which has never been explained, the"
DESERT CREEK '3 was ignored and the creek became the" JACK RIVER" on official
maps. The creek, which must fall into the "Normanby" mouth of the Princess
Charlotte Bay group of rivers, has not yet been surveyed.</p>
<p>The most recent issue of the 4-mile map Sheet 20A (December, 1907) places
ANOTHER "JACK RIVER" at the southern boundary of the pastoral block called
"Jack's Lakes," 11 miles north of my Camp 24, where I last saw Desert Creek. I
have no reason to doubt that the water-course exists, although I have no
personal knowledge of it, and there are no surveyed lines, unless possibly at
the south side of the pastoral block above referred to. It probably runs into
the "Normanby" mouth north of the infall of Desert Creek. I must say, however,
that the name of Jack River is singularly unhappy in this instance.</p>
<p>On 18th August, 1879, north of the Morgan River, I stood at the head of a
valley which, cleaving a sandstone tableland, could be followed westward by the
eye, and which I assumed (as shown in my sketch-map) to be that of a tributary
of the Normanby. The valley lies to the south, while Desert Creek is on the
north of a sandstone tableland, and the two water-courses are roughly about 15
miles apart.</p>
<p>At a later stage on the same journey, my Camp 28 (31st August, 1879) was on
a creek or river which I had followed eastward for 7 miles from its junction
with the Normanby River. Seven miles above my Camp 28 (to ESE.), Hann's Camp 40
had been pitched in 1872 on what was almost certainly the same creek. A
prolongation of the line for a few miles eastward would join this creek with
the valley which I had previously seen from near the Morgan. I drew a dotted
line accordingly, and so it stands on the map to-day. Apparently, the only
surveying on the line is the connection of my Camp 28 with the Normanby River
by Mr. Embley in 1883, when he traversed the Normanby.</p>
<p>Mr. Embley explains that he was shown the position of my camp by DONALD
MACKENZIE, who took up Lakefield Station in 1881, and who was under the
impression that I had followed this creek down from what was later the Starcke
Goldfield. (The impression</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 638}</u></p>
<p>was erroneous: I went from the Starcke to the Normanby via Desert Creek; but
the identification of my Camp 28 was correct.) The river on which my Camp 28
was situated was named by Mr. Embley the JACK RIVER when he located its
junction with the Normanby in 1883. Many years later, within the boundaries of
what had by that time become the Starcke Goldfield, a little alluvial GOLD was
discovered at the head of the river (the miners called it the JACK DIGGINGS)
which I had looked down on 18th August, 1879. If there is to be a JACK RIVER,
the name should belong to this river and to no other. Because of the "diggings"
the name known to the miners could hardly be altered, at any rate. It might
easily prove inconvenient and annoying to have THREE RIVERS of the same name in
the same region.</p>
<p>In 1883 and the early part of 1884, Mr. Embley traversed the Normanby,
Laura, Bizant, Kennedy, North Kennedy and Morehead Rivers, and the creeks on
"Koolburra," also the heads, such as East and West Normanby, Mosman, Little
Laura and St. George. The positions of creeks between the rivers were fixed by
cross-lines, which became run-boundaries.</p>
<p>To be more precise, i.e., to take only what are shown by firm lines on the
4-mile maps, Mr. Embley traversed:&mdash;</p>

to the North Kennedy; and the outfall (lat. 14&deg; 41' S. and long. 144&deg;

<h4>NORTH KENNEDY RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES</h4>
<p>From lat. 15&deg; 2' N. and long. 144&deg; 5' E. via the infall of Station
(Warner's) Creek (lat. 14&deg; 51' S. and long. 144&deg; 6' E.) and the inf all
(lat. 14&deg; 49' S. and long. 144&deg; 5' E.) of the branch whose "outfall"
from the Normanby has already been referred to; to its mouth in Princess
Charlotte Bay (lat. 14&deg; 30' S. and long. 144&deg; 2' E.). (SEE MAP E.) This
mouth, Mr. Embley informs me, is quite a respectable inlet, capable of
accommodating small craft.</p>
<p>The NORTH KENNEDY is the seaward prolongation of THERRIMBURI CREEK (also
surveyed by Mr. Embley), on which a station named Koolburra was taken up by
Henry Jones <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> in 1884. I would suggest the
application of the name Therrimburi to the whole of the water-course from its
source to the Bay. The name North Kennedy is in any case an unhappily chosen
one, as the river lies west, not north of the Kennedy. The elimination of even
one of the numerous and confusing "Kennedy" rivers would in itself be a
gain.</p>
<p>Mr. Embley also surveyed THERRIMBURI CREEK (although he did not know it by
that name) from its head in "Osmer No. 3" block (lat. 15&deg; 32' S. and long.
143&deg; 56' E.) to near the north-east corner of "Koolburra No. 4" block.</p>
<p>STATION CREEK.&mdash;This well-watered creek, or river, was traversed by Mr.
Embley, he informs me, from the southern boundary of "Walwa Plains No. 5" block
(lat. 15&deg; 5' S. and long. 143&deg; 57' E.) to its junction with the
so-called North Kennedy River at Walwa Station. This station was taken up by
Grandison Watson in 1881, but it was afterwards abandoned and the cattle taken
to Merluna Downs. There are several hundreds of creeks in Queensland bearing
the silly name of "Station Creek." In this case, should a really distinctive
name be called for, I suggest the restoration of</p>
<blockquote>[1) The first pastoral holding in this region was taken up by
Donald Mackenzie at Lakefield on the Kennedy River (lat. 14&deg; 55' S.) in
1881. Mackenzie was very friendly to the blacks when he first took up the
station, and consistently protected them from injury by white men. In 1882,
when he was dressing the sore back of a horse, a native sauntered up, chanting
a corroborree air, and speared him through the body. He got over this; but many
years afterwards, when his men were out mustering cattle and he was left alone
in his garden, a party of natives came up suddenly and clubbed him to death.

<p>the name applied to the river by MULLIGAN on his "fifth" trip in 1875, for
there is no room for doubt that this is his WARNER RIVER. Moreover, my study of
Carron's narrative makes it clear that KENNEDY CAME DOWN what Mulligan
afterwards called the WARNER RIVER (Kennedy's camps of 26th, 27th and 30th
September, 1848), and <i>not</i> down what is now known as the Kennedy
River.</p>
<h4>HANN RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES</h4>
<p>The Hann River, as it now appears on the map, has a course from south to
north. (SEE MAP E.) It was named in 1875 by MULLIGAN, who crossed it in lat.
14&deg; 55' S. on his south-easterly course on his "fifth" trip between his
Camp 79 on Saltwater Creek and his Camp 81 on the "North Kennedy." At this
crossing he described the river, which he named the HANN, as "a large river
running to the east of north" with "a great body of water in long reaches."
This was about a mile below the junction of the river with what was afterwards
(1883) named the MOREHEAD RIVER by Bradford, who made the exploration
preliminary to the construction of the Cape York Telegraph line. The Morehead,
having proved to be the longer water-course, has given its name to the combined
water-course down to the salt water, including the very river on which Mulligan
conferred the name of Hann. The river was named after the Hon. Boyd D.
Morehead, who was Postmaster-General in 1883.</p>
<p>The branch coming from the south, to which alone the name of Hann is now
applied, heads some 18 miles west of the well-known "bend of the Kennedy." In
this region, in the course of his survey of the "Koolburra" blocks, Mr. Embley
traversed the upper reaches of the Hann River and its twin branch Wangow Creek
for a distance of about 18 miles from south to north (to the junction of the
creek and river). For the next 12 miles of its northward course, the river is
apparently still unsurveyed, as it is represented in the map by a dotted line.
Three miles below the junction of Wangow Creek, however, on 25th September,
1879, I crossed "a creek of the third magnitude, running like a millrace to the
north-east, 3 yards wide and 18 inches deep," and remarked, "I have no doubt
that this was Mulligan's Hann River." [I had at that time no knowledge of the
larger branch subsequently known as the Morehead.] The "Parish" of this region
is called "Millrace." Three miles north of my crossing of 1879, the Cape York
Telegraph survey (1886) marks the "HANN RIVER" as crossing the line, and so
gives sanction and permanence to the name as applied to this branch. Some 30
miles down the river from the telegraph line, and 19 miles to the north as the
crow flies is Mulligan's crossing of 1875, and here the position of the "Hann"
and its junction with the Morehead have been fixed by Mr. Embley in</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 641}</u></p>
<p>the course of his survey of the "Walwa Plains" blocks. Both above and below
Mulligan's crossing, the Hann traverses swampy inundable country, which in one
place (above Mulligan's crossing) extends to Station Creek (Warner River) 10
miles to the east. In times of flood, the swamp must discharge its superfluous
waters by both the Hann (which is now called the Morehead) and "Station" Creek
(Warner River).</p>
<p>Below Mulligan's crossing, the river appears to spread out into many
channels, some of which (e.g., Sandy Creek) join the "North Kennedy" River to
the east. I crossed these channels in 1879, 10 miles north of Mulligan's
crossing, without being at all sure which was the "main" course of the river.
According to the official conjecture of the Lands Department (dotted line), the
north-westmost channel (known, of course, as the MOREHEAD RIVER) is the most
important, and it falls into the "North Kennedy" in 14&deg; 38' S. lat.</p>
<h4>MOREHEAD RIVER</h4>
<p>This river is the larger branch of the stream which, after the two branches
had come together, Mulligan named the Hann. (SEE MAPS E, F AND G.) The junction
of the two streams has been fixed by Mr. Embley's surveys. Twenty miles above
the junction, to the south-west, its position has been determined by its
crossing of the Cape York Telegraph line. For some 20 miles more up the river
(still south-west) it appears to have been traversed about 1885 by Mr. Embley
(who did not give it a name, and who considered it to be the real Hann River)
in the course of his surveys of Zhapan, Zeredho, Vivanho, Mouro, Neph and
Vibhraj blocks,<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and in this region it has split
up into numerous branches. I had crossed the river twice in 1879 (lat. 15&deg;
5' and Is&deg; 13' S.) without giving it a name.</p>
<p>In charting the <i>route</i> of Hann's expedition of 1872, when he left the
Palmer and went north-westward and northward to the heads of the Coleman and
Lukin (Holroyd), I have come to regard it as almost a certainty that from his
21st camp, 16 miles north-west of Lukinville, on the Palmer River, to his 24th
camp, in lat. 15&deg; 12' S., he practically followed, to the north-west, the
course of the principal head of the Morehead (see Queensland 4-mile Map, Sheets
18C, 20A and 20B). This portion of the river (?), however, is still
unsurveyed.</p>
<h4>BIZANT RIVER</h4>
<p>Midway between the coalescent mouths of the Morehead and Normanby, the
westmost of which is mapped as the North Kennedy</p>
<blockquote>[1) These fantastic names belonged to (Egyptian?) spirits called up
by the table-rapping squatter who first took up the land.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 642}</u></p>
<p>and the eastmost as the Normanby, the Bizant River falls into Princess
Charlotte Bay. (SEE MAP E.) It appears to leak out of the Normanby, via
Ferguson Creek, in 14&deg; 40' S. lat. It follows a general course of NNW. to
the Bay and was carefully charted by Mr. Embley in 1883 in the course of a
survey of a tract of land which had been selected in 1882 by a Brisbane
syndicate for a sugar plantation, but which was abandoned when it was shown by
Mr. Embley's surveys and other evidence to be liable to inundation.</p>
<h4>MARRETT RIVER</h4>
<p>This is the eastmost mouth of the Princess Charlotte Bay group of rivers.
(SEE MAP E.) It was named after Sub-Inspector Marrett, of the Native Police,
who was the first to report its existence. It enters the Bay about 2 miles east
of the "Normanby" mouth. It does not appear to have been surveyed by any
officer of the Lands Department, but it has been sounded, and presumably
charted, by Marine Surveyors for about 8 miles up from the Bay, bringing it up
to 14&deg; 27' S. lat. (see Adm. Chart No. 2922, 1902). Mr. Embley, who has
seen it, understands that it drains the sandstone tablelands at the base of the
Cape Melville Peninsula, and doubts if it has any connection with the Normanby
River even in times of flood.</p>
<p>Saltwater Creek and the Annie River were not surveyed by Mr. Embley, but may
conveniently be referred to in this place, for the sake of preserving
geographical continuity.</p>
<h4>SALTWATER CREEK</h4>
<p>Heads in the Divide of the Peninsula about 6 miles west of Musgrave
Telegraph Station. (SEE MAPS E AND F.) Near the station is a fine hot spring.
The greater part of the course of the creek, which is on the whole ENE., has
been located by the Telegraph survey. The river was crossed by KENNEDY in 1848
(his camp of 6th October) in lat. 14&deg; 40, S., and is described by Carron,
Kennedy's historian, as a salt-water creek among salt lagoons. I crossed it at
the same place in 1879, following on the track of the "Coen" rush of the
previous year. MULLIGAN crossed it in 14&deg; 48' S. on his fifth expedition in
1875 (his Camp 79), describing it as "quite a river." As his report makes no
mention of salt water, it may be taken for granted that his crossing was above
the reach of tidal water.</p>
<h4>ANNIE RIVER</h4>
<p>This river has an approximate east-by-south course from its head (14&deg;
25, S., 43&deg; 27' E.) on the divide of the Peninsula to its confluence with
the "North Kennedy River," within a mile of Princess Charlotte Bay, a distance
of almost 36 miles in a straight</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 643}</u></p>
<p>line. (SEE MAP E.) Except where it crosses the Cape York Telegraph line,
about 6 miles from its source, and at its mouth, it does not appear to have
been charted. It was crossed by KENNEDY (his camp of 9th October, 1848) about
143&deg; 46' E. long., by WILLIAM HANN (between his Camps 35 and 36) in 1872
about 7 miles lower, and by me in 1879 about 21 miles higher. It is believed to
have been named after the wife of Frederick Warner, the surveyor who
accompanied Hann.</p>
<p>At a period by no means remote, geologically speaking, Princess Charlotte
Bay must have extended at least 35 miles further south than it does now, and
each of the rivers known in their upper reaches as the Normanby, Kennedy,
Therrimburi, Hann, Morehead, Saltwater and Annie must have pursued an
independent course to the Bay. The silting up of the "head" of the Bay,
resulting in the creation of a tract of low land barely, and locally, raised
above the level of the ocean by the flood-deposits of the rivers, made it
impossible for the rivers to preserve, in their lower reaches, their
independence. Their mouths spread out over the low land by various channels,
coalescing and anastomosing until they lost their identity and individuality.
Analogous phenomena, on a larger scale, have followed the silting up of the
head of the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>

<h4>STEWART RIVER</h4>
<p>IN 1895-6, Mr. Embley traversed the Stewart River from its head, in 14&deg;
S. lat., near the Coen diggings township, to the point where it falls into the
Pacific Ocean in 14&deg; 4' S. lat., a total distance of about 50 miles. (SEE
MAP C.) At its mouth are PORT STEWART and a reserve for the township of
MOOJEEBA. Kennedy crossed it in 1848, and Hann's furthest north in 1872 was
Claremont Point, about 4 miles north of its mouth.</p>
<p>Mr. Embley also traversed STATION CREEK<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and
on it located LALLA ROOKH STATION, which had been taken up by the brothers Glen
and Charles Massy in 1882. He also ran in 1884 a NE. line, 24 miles in length,
from LALLA ROOKH to ROBERTS POINT On the Pacific Coast, by which he located
BREAKFAST and MASSY CREEKS, falling into the Pacific respectively in 13&deg;
58' and 13&deg; 55' S. lat. He also traversed the coast-line from the mouth of
the Stewart River to the mouth of Massy Creek. On the latter creek, in 1885,
CHARLES MASSY, accompanied by two stockmen, was looking for cattle in a scrub
when he was ambushed by NATIVES and received a SPEAR-WOUND in the body, of
which he died in three days.</p>
<p>From the mouth of Massy Creek, Mr. Embley continued his traverse of the
coast-line as far northward as CAPE SIDMOUTH, halting to survey the lower
reaches of the ROCKY RIVER and the whole length of the CHESTER RIVER, which
drain the ROCKY RIVER GOLDFIELD and reach the Pacific in 13&deg; 47' and
13&deg; 42' S. lat. respectively. Kennedy must have crossed these rivers, near
their mouths, in 1848.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Not the "Station Creek" at Walwa referred to in the preceding
chapter.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 645}</u></p>
<p>North of the Rocky River Goldfield, Mr. Embley traversed the NISBET RIVER
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> for 9 miles up from its mouth in lat. 13&deg;
33' S. Kennedy must have struck this river in 1848 about where Embley left off,
and followed its valley up N. by W. North of what Mr. Embley has mapped, the
river has not been surveyed, except by me when I sketched and named it on loth
January, 1880. From the head of the river to the highest point surveyed by Mr.
Embley, its valley separates the MCILWRAITH and MACROSSAN RANGES.</p>
<h4>LOCKHART RIVER</h4>
<p>The river running northward into Lloyd Bay, whose valley sharply divides the
northern half of the Macrossan Range from the McIlwraith Range, was first seen
and named by me in January, 1880. Not long afterwards, the heads of the river,
especially those draining the McIlwraith Range, were invaded by PROSPECTORS who
found ALLUVIAL GOLD in tributary creeks and gullies which have not yet been
surveyed. The diggers named among others "Cheery," "Surprise" and "Dr. Jack"
Creeks, <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> but these are omitted from the present
map pending their accurate location. SANDALWOOD GETTERS also worked for some
years on the slopes of the McIlwraith Range, taking their spoils down the river
from GIBLET'S LANDING, 8 miles from the mouth, at the head of boat navigation.
(The wood was finally shipped from Thursday Island.)</p>
<p>In 1880, I had seen from a distant height that a portion of the Lockhart
Valley consisted of open grassy plains. These were visited in 1910 by Dickie,
Dick and Sheffield, who considered them good for sugar cane, and a demand arose
for the opening of the land for occupation.</p>
<p>Mr. Embley, under instructions from the Department of Lands, visited the
valley in 1913, traversing the river up to GIBLET'S landing (where he indicated
a site for a reserve) and for about 12 miles beyond the landing, cutting up a
portion of the frontage into agricultural holdings. He was unfavourably
impressed by the quality of the land on the grassy plains, and said so in his
report. It was sour, and grew a rank, unpalatable grass and was a mass of
"devil-devil." When in March, 1914, the allotments were put up for sale by
auction they attracted no bidders.</p>
<p>Just north of the allotments, Mr. Embley sketched the infall and course of a
branch, apparently almost as important as the river itself, and coming down
from the McIlwraith Range. This branch must have been known to prospectors and
sandalwood getters, who had erroneously identified it with my Greyhound</p>
<blockquote>[1) Erroneously spelt "Nesbit" in the 4-mile map as well as in the
Admiralty Chart No. 2921.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) See sketch-map attached to James Dick's Report on a Journey
across the McIlwraith Range by Dickie, Dick and Sheffield, in Queensland
Government Mining Journal of 15th December, 1910.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 646}</u></p>
<p>Creek, which falls in 14 miles higher up the river. The erroneous name Of
GREYHOUND CREEK is applied to the branch in the 1908 and 1915 issues of the
4-mile map (Sheet 20C).</p>
<p>In 1885 Mr. Embley located MOUNT CARTER,<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> a
conspicuous peak in the McIlwraith Range between the Pascoe River and Sefton
Creek. Also "Jack's Nob," a prominent peak on a range between Batavia River and
Sefton Creek. Both of these may be seen conspicuously towering above the main
range from the Lockhart valley.</p>

<h4>ALICE RIVER</h4>
<p>KOOLATAH RUN (Sheet 20B), comprising about 3,000 square miles of country on
the Lower Mitchell River, was taken up for McEacharn and Bell in 1886. (SEE
MAPS F AND H.) The station is on one of the Mitchell's anabranches to which the
first manager, FRANK JOHNSON, gave the name of ALICE, after his wife. In the
course of his survey of the run, Mr. Embley traversed the Alice from its infall
on the northern side of the Mitchell upwards (north-east) for about 22 miles,
and more or less defined its higher course and the courses of numerous
tributaries by fixing the points where they crossed the boundary-lines of
blocks of country. What is understood to be the main channel has been traced up
to the south- east as far as "Cootah No. 9" block (Sheet 18D), a distance of
about 70 miles from its junction with the Mitchell near the station. Its right,
or north-eastern, bank, while in the low delta country, receives many
tributaries <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> coming from the north-east, and
several of these latter (e.g., my CROSBIE CREEK, Sheet 20B) on leaving the low
country can be traced up, by independent valleys,</p>
<blockquote>[1) One of these, which Mulligan named Fahey Creek in 1875, was
arbitrarily renamed Ethel Creek by the owners of Kalkah Station, and bears that
name in recent issues of the 4-mile map.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 648}</u></p>
<p>to sources in the DIVIDE OF THE PENINSULA. On One of these tributaries,
payable GOLD was discovered in 1904 by JOHN DICKIE, who named the stream the
ALICE RIVER, and the field was known for some time as the ALICE GOLDFIELD. When
the mistake was eventually admitted, the name of the field was changed to the
PHILP, and confusion would be avoided if the river were also named the Philp
River.</p>
<p>In 1886, Mr. Embley completed the survey of the LOWER MITCHELL from the inf
all of the Alice River down to the Gulf, incidentally making it possible to
chart a portion of the JARDINE BROTHERS' route of 1864 with some approach to
accuracy.</p>
<h4>COLEMAN RIVER</h4>
<p>In 1886, in the course of surveys of numerous "Kalkah" and "Goathland"
blocks, Mr. Embley accurately fixed the position of the Coleman River, which he
had run down in 1884. (SEE MAP F.)</p>
<h4>EDWARD RIVER</h4>
<p>In the same year, the survey of the "Bathwick" blocks afforded Mr. Embley
the opportunity for fixing the position of the coastward 55 miles of the Edward
River, which he had discovered in 1884 and named after his brother. (SEE MAP
F.) He noted that the river, which flows from east to west midway between the
Coleman and Holroyd (or Lukin), heads in a low tableland of "pebbly ironstone
conglomerate," many miles west of the divide of the Peninsula.</p>
<h4>HOLROYD RIVER</h4>
<p>In 1886-7, in the course of the survey of pastoral blocks known as
"Bathwick," "Euorrii" and "Yarra," Mr. Embley completed the location of the
upper part of the Holroyd (or Lukin) River, which he had traversed in its lower
reaches in 1884. (SEE MAP F.) It rises in the Hamilton Goldfield (discovered
1898-1900, by John Dickie), near the modern township of Ebagoolah. In this
portion it had been crossed by Mulligan in 1875 and by myself in 1879.</p>
<p>In 1895, after running the "Thirty-mile Line" (which, running parallel to
the Gulf coast, was designed to separate land on the west which might be
selected, from land on the east which might be taken up on pastoral leasehold),
Mr. Embley surveyed the Holroyd River down to the Gulf.</p>
<h4>KENDALL RIVER, DE FACTO</h4>
<p>In 1885, in the course of the survey of "Lockton" block, and again in 1895,
when running the "Thirty-mile Line," Mr. Embley</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 649}</u></p>
<p>definitely charted a portion of his Kendall River down to the 142nd meridian
of east latitude. (SEE MAPS F, D AND C.) The question of the identification of
this river with the Jardine Brothers' Kendall Creek is discussed in another
chapter.</p>
<h4>SOUTH COEN RIVER</h4>
<p>As has already been mentioned, the BROTHERS GLEN AND CHARLES MASSY took up
LALLA ROOKH Station, near the head of the Stewart River, which falls into the
Pacific, in 1882. (SEE MAPS C AND D.) Two years later, while still retaining
Lalla Rookh, they established an out-station, which they named ROKEBY, 45 miles
to west-north-west, on waters falling towards the Gulf of Carpentaria. The site
of the station was on a large scrubby creek which runs NNW. into the South Coen
River, but which bears no name on modern maps. This "Rokeby" became "OLD
ROKEBY" when, a few years later, the headquarters of the run were finally
shifted to a site on the South Coen itself, some 10 miles to the north.</p>
<p>In surveying the blocks on Lana Rookh and Rokeby runs and the "St. Albans"
and "Bydowns" blocks in 1884-5, and the necessary comings and goings, Mr.
Embley charted the South Coen River from the township at the then deserted Coen
diggings, north-westward and westward, to its junction with the river which had
been named the ARCHER by the Brothers Jardine in 1865, a distance of about 90
miles. Down to the junction of the two rivers, the Archer has a slightly longer
course than the South Coen and consequently the reach of the river (60 miles)
from the junction to the Gulf is known as the Archer River. Elsewhere I have
explained the reason for calling the "Coen" of the diggers by the name of"
South Coen" to distinguish it from the insignificant water-course in about
13&deg; 4' S. lat., named the COEN REVIER by JAN CARSTENSZOON in 1623</p>
<h4>ARCHER RIVER</h4>
<p>In 1884-5 Mr. Embley not only ran the Archer down westward from the infall
of the South Coen to its outlet in the Gulf of Carpentaria in 13&deg; 20' S.
lat. but also traversed it up eastward, with wheel and compass, to beyond where
it breaches the Gcikie Range, and, passing to the east of the (modern) Cape
York Telegraph line, forms the reach which I named the Peach River <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> in 1879. (SEE MAPS C AND D.) Here he left the Archer
and followed a branch, nearly as large, which I had named Geikie Creek in 1879,
almost to its head in that part of the DIVIDE OF THE PENINSULA which was named
the MCILWRAITH RANGE.</p>
<blockquote>[1) My name (Peach) has, of course, to be abandoned in view of
proof of the identity of the Peach with the Archer.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 650}</u></p>
<p>In this region, viz., the heads of the Archer east of the Geikie Range, I
cannot subscribe to the interpretation put on the known data by the official
version of Sheet 20C, as will be seen by a comparison with the sheet as
officially issued and the sheet herewith. My map of this region, which formed
part of my completed report, was not published with it, which was the fault of
the Department of Mines. But I have been able to reproduce the lost map, AS
GIVEN HEREWITH, from my note-books. It must be clearly understood that the only
mapping in this region was done by myself in 1879-80, by Mr. Embley in 1884-5,
and, to a limited extent, by the Telegraph Construction Party in 1885.</p>
<p>I am indebted to the present Surveyor-General, Mr. Allan A. Spowers, for a
copy of Sheet 20C with all Mr. Ernbley's lines shown in red ink. Taking these
as a basis, I have added my own lines, which are in no instance in conflict
with Mr. Embley's, in the production of the version given herewith in
illustration of Kennedy's travels (1848) and my own (1879-80).</p>
<p>Mr. Embley finds it difficult to believe that keen observers like the Dutch
sailors could possibly miss the opening which forms the mouth of the Archer,
but Carstenszoon's log of May, 1</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 623}</u></p>
, leaves no room for doubt.
<p>At noon of 6th May, the "<i>Pera</i>" (on her northward voyage) was in
13&deg; 29' S. lat. When evening came, the wind had taken an unfavourable turn,
and the ship was anchored. Early on the 7th, the skipper landed, and, as the
result of an attempt to kidnap a native, had a fight with too armed blacks. The
anchor was lifted at noon, the moment the latitude of the anchorage (13&deg;
20' S.) had been ascertained, and the "<i>Pera</i>" continued her northward
voyage.</p>
<p>Now 13&deg; 20' is practically the latitude of the mouth of the combined
Archer and South Coen Rivers, and the landing must have taken place on the
prominent elbow of the shore west of the mouth of the river. The "<i>Pera</i>"
had probably anchored too late the previous evening for good observation, and
in the morning it is likely that the men left on the ship were too much
interested in the proceedings on shore to take any account of the scenery.</p>
<p>On the night of the 7th, the anchorage was in 13&deg; 7' S., as ascertained
while the ship was still at anchor at noon on the following day. Next morning,
Carstenszoon himself landed with the skipper and ten musketeers and did not get
back to the ship till the afternoon. They had had a busy and successful day.
Having observed FOOTPRINTS Of men and dogs, they FOLLOWED THEM TO THE NORTH
till they came on a "revier," which they named the COEN, after the Governor of
the Netherlands India Company. It is not said whether the water was salt or
fresh, nor is mention made of any opening being visible from the sea. From the
course (parallel to the coast-line and only 7 miles from it) now</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 651}</u></p>
<p>known to be taken by the WARD RIVER, it is impossible that the Coen River
can be of any importance as a water-course, and equally impossible that it can
be the river on which the goldfield was subsequently discovered. What was,
however, of importance was that its banks yielded ESCULENT HERBS, which the
sailors gathered and carried back to the boat. To a crew of those days, in
constant dread of scurvy, the herbs were of inestimable value.' On returning to
the boat, they were attacked by the NATIVES, whom they beat off, making one
PRISONER. It was a busy day, and we can only conjecture how far the men
travelled on foot north of the landing in 13&deg; 7', in the time when they
were not gathering herbs, fighting or rowing. When they got back to the
"<i>Pera</i>," her anchor was lifted and she resumed her voyage to the north.
It is easy to recognise, from the log, that in due time they passed PERA HEAD,
With its "watering-place," and crossed ALBATROSS BAY to DUYFKEN POINT.</p>
<p>I regard it as proved beyond question that Carstenszoon's Coen is <i>not</i>
the Coen (South Coen) of the diggings, and that in spite of their powers of
observation, the men of the "<i>Pera</i>" passed the mouth of the Archer
without taking note of it.</p>
<p>South of the Archer, and below the infall of the South Coen, the former
river receives a long west-to-east tributary recognisable as the JARDINE
BROTHERS' KINLOCH CREEK, and the true position of this was fixed by Mr. Embley
in the course of his "Rokeby" and "Meta Downs" surveys (1885-6). North of the
Archer he has traced PICCANINNY CREEK and its tributaries from their sources in
the Geikie Range, across the Telegraph line north and south of MEIN TELEGRAPH
STATION, through PINE CREEK cattle station to its junction with the ARCHER at
the south-western corner of" Meta Downs No. 3" block. A few miles below the
junction the Jardine Brothers crossed the Archer in 1865.</p>
<h4>BATAVIA RIVER</h4>
<p>In 1885-6, in the course of his surveys of the "York Downs" pastoral blocks
and the "Thirty-mile Line," Mr. Embley charted the course of the Batavia River
from its mouth in the estuary, named Port Musgrave, common to it and the Ducie
and Dalhunty Rivers, to a point 6 miles above what subsequently became the
Moreton Telegraph Station, a total distance of about 95 miles. (SEE MAPS B AND
C.) Not long afterwards he found it convenient</p>
<blockquote>[1) The above was written prior to the receipt of a letter, dated
5th February, 1919, from Mr. Nicholas Hey, of the Mapoon Mission. He locates a
small water-course falling into the Gulf in 13&deg; 4' S. lat., which as yet
has no place on official maps, but which it is proposed to call Norman Creek.
THIS IS CARSTENSZOON'S COEN REVIER. Mr. Hey emphatically asserts that there is
no other water-course between Ina Creek and False Pera Head, with the exception
of a small trickle of fresh water (in the wet season only) about a mile south
of False Pera Head. He adds that in all this neighbourhood pigweed is abundant,
and is eaten by the natives.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 652}</u></p>
<p>to make York Downs his headquarters, and owing to this circumstance, he came
to acquire a familiarity with the neighbourhood which led to its being charted
with unusual minuteness. The construction of the Telegraph line, the
delimitation of Police and Aboriginal Reserves (the latter in connection with
the Mapoon Mission, established in 1893) and subsequent co-operation with the
missionaries in exploratory work necessitated such an amount of travelling,
sketching and surveying on Mr. Embley's part that he became the supreme
authority on the geography of the LOWER BATAVIA.</p>
<p>North of the Batavia River and west of the Cape York Telegraph line, an
important tributary which had been named NIMROD CREEK by the Jardine Brothers
in 1865 was located in 1885-6 by Mr. Embley in the course of running lines in
connection with the Police Reserve.</p>
<p>Above the "point 6 miles from Moreton Telegraph Station," a reach of the
river 40 miles in length still remains unsurveyed, but its general course, to
north-north-west, is undoubted. Above this reach, Mr. Embley, in the course of
surveys of "Big River" and "Pine Tree" pastoral holdings, and a
wheel-and-compass survey of the upper part of the river itself, charted the
final 40 miles of the Batavia River south-eastward and eastward to its head on
the DIVIDE OF THE PENINSULA, in the MCILWRAITII RANGE. He also charted SEFTON
CREEK, a tributary which heads in the divide and runs westward a few miles
north of the Batavia, which it joins after a course of about 20 miles. In this
Sefton-Batavia region, Mr. Embley's surveys are of the utmost service in
locating the lines traversed by me in 1880. Here, as well as on the headwaters
of the Archer River, he was assisted in the field by WILLIAM LAKELAND, the
well-known prospector.</p>
<h4>WATSON RIVER</h4>
<p>The Archer and Batavia Rivers rise close together in the McIlwraith Range,
but as they fall to the west in their progress to the Gulf of Carpentaria, they
diverge widely enough to leave room between them for large areas drained by
rivers which fall independently into the Gulf. (SEE MAPS C AND D.) Coming from
south to north, the first of these rivers is the WATSON. One of its principal
heads is named LAGOON CREEK, on which is the MERLUNA DOWNS STATION (lat.
13&deg; 3' S., long. 142&deg; 30' E.&mdash;17 miles west of the Telegraph
line), originally taken up by Watson Brothers in 1888, and now a State-owned
cattle run. From Merluna Downs the Watson River falls on a western course for
26 miles to the boundary of the Aboriginal Reserve (which extends thence to the
coast) and on a south-western course for</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 653}</u></p>
<p>38 miles till it joins the Archer River just before the latter dis- charges
into the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>
<p>On its right or northern side, this river receives an important tributary,
SAY CREEK, 8 miles above the Aboriginal Reserve. The south side receives GUMBOL
CREEK (=Bloodwood in the native language), MERKUNGA CREEK (gum tree) and
KOKIALAII CREEK (Kokialah being the designation of the local tribe of natives).
Mr. Embley had known the upper part of the river since 1886. In 1895, during
one of his periodical visits to York Downs, he ran the river down to its
junction with the Archer. On that occasion he was accompanied by Leo Watson, of
Merluna Downs, after whom the river was named.</p>
<h4>EMBLEY AND HEY RIVERS</h4>
<p>In 1885-6, while surveying the leases applied for in connection with York
Downs, Mr. Embley had become familiar with a creek which he named KURRACOO (box
tree) CREEK. (SEE MAP D.) This creek rises a little north of the head of Say
Creek, and after a course of 20 miles to the north-west, i.e., to the boundary
of the Aboriginal Reserve, becomes navigable by boats for the remainder of its
course (27 miles), west-north-westward, to Albatross Bay.</p>
<p>In September,1895, the REV. NICHOLAS HEY, whose headquarters were at Mapoon,
Port Musgrave, rode out with a gold-digger named Rigby and a black boy, and
"reached in four days YORK DOWNs cattle station, the headquarters of MR.
EMBLEY, a Government Surveyor whom they had resolved to consult. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> The object of the journey was to select a site for an
out-station of the Mapoon Mission. "They were fortunate enough," continues the
historian of Mapoon, "to find Mr. Embley at the cattle station, and he showed
them the utmost hospitality the place could afford." Mr. Embley accompanied the
party for the furtherance of their object, of which he highly approved, having
in view the establishment of a <i>modus vivendi</i> with the native population,
and led them to the north side of the navigable river, where they selected a
site for what is now the out-mission-station of WEIPA.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, the HON. JOHN DOUGLAS, Government Resident at Thursday
Island, steamed in the "<i>Albatross</i>" to what he afterwards named ALBATROSS
BAY and officially named Mr. Embley's "river navigable by boats" the EMBLEY
RIVER.</p>
<p>Eight miles from its mouth, the south side of the Embley River receives the
HEY RIVER, a wide arm of the sea which penetrates the land for about 10 miles
to the south. At its head it receives four or five small fresh-water streams,
as described by Archibald Meston and others.</p>
<p>The navigable portion of the Embley River was surveyed by</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>The Miracle of Mapoon</i>, by Arthur Ward, p.
197.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 654}</u></p>
<p>Mr. Embley in 1897, and he commenced to make use of the waterway, it having
been ascertained that boats could come up from the sea to a point only II miles
from York Downs. The missionaries of Weipa also made free use of the river.</p>
<h4>MISSION RIVER</h4>
<p>YORK DOWNS cattle station is situated on MYALL CREEK, which heads only a few
miles east of Kurracoo Creek, and some 13 miles above (south-south-east of) the
station. (SEE MAPS B AND D.) Mr. Embley had practically mapped it by the end of
1885, while running the eastern and western boundary-lines of "York Downs No. 1
and No. 2" blocks, and had located it again in the same year 11 and 14 miles
below the station in running the boundary between York Downs "Occupation
License" and "Kooloo" block. Here the creek turns from a north-north-westerly
to a practically westerly course, and in 9 miles to the west Mr. Embley again,
in the same year, cut it on the "Thirty-mile Line" (now the march between
Kooloo and the Aboriginal Reserve). Probably the tidal water reaches nearly up
to this boundary. At all events, the river becomes an estuary or arm of the sea
only 13 miles to the west. I have no doubt that long before 1895 Mr. Embley
knew all about its course, although he had only surveyed the portion between
the estuary and the Thirty-mile Line in 1897.</p>
<p>It appears, however, according to the historian of Mapoon, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> that up to 1895, Myall Creek was believed to merge into
the Pennefather River, which enters the Gulf in 12&deg; 15' S. lat., or into
PINE (now NOMENADE) CREEK, which enters the Gulf in 12&deg; 30' S. lat., the
northmost limit of Albatross Bay.</p>
<p>In discussing the site selected for Weipa Station with Hey, Douglas objected
that if the river was really the Pine River, he himself knew, from a visit four
years previously, that the mouth of that river had not water enough even for
small boats. This objection could only be met by a survey of the river below
the proposed site of the out-station.</p>
<p>Hey accordingly chartered a boat and spent a week in exploring the rivers
entering Albatross Bay. Pine Creek was soon ascertained to be a creek of no
importance, coming from the north, and unfit even for small boats. From the
mouth of Pine Creek he coasted the Bay for 10 miles to east-south-east and
found himself at KERR POINT, which was seen to divide two estuaries. Sailing
eastward up the NORTHERN ESTUARY, he had soundings of 15 to 20 feet for the
first 10 miles, and of 12 feet for some distance higher up. "To his surprise,
he recognised it as the CONTINUATION OF MYALL CREEK, on which York Downs
Station stands." I cannot suppose</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>The Miracle of Mapoon</i>, p. 201.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 655}</u></p>
<p>that the fact, new to Hey in 1895, would have been any surprise to Embley,
who by that time had known the river for ten years. "As no white man had even
been up it before," continues Arthur Ward, relating Hey's voyage, "and it was
not on the map, he called it the Mission River." The name was officially
confirmed by Douglas, and so Myall Creek became the MISSION RIVER. As a general
rule, the arbitrary alteration of place-names is to be deprecated, but in the
present instance no great harm can be done by the elimination of one of the far
too numerous "Myall Creeks" from the map of Queensland. Mr. Embley surveyed the
Mission River from the Thirty-mile Line down to Kerr Point in 1897.</p>
<p>Returning to the mouth of the estuary of the Mission River, Hey rounded Kerr
Point and sailed up the EMBLEY RIVER till he recognised the site previously
selected for "Weipa," and also sailed for some further distance up the Hey
River. Douglas again visited the scene of Hey's recent travels and confirmed
the names of the EMBLEY and HEY RIVERS. On this occasion he also named the bay
ALBATROSS BAY. This is still the official name, <i>de facto</i>, and perhaps
must remain so for all time; but the name <i>de jure</i> is VLIEGE BAAIJ (Fly
Bay), which was bestowed by TASMAN in 1644. Lavienne Lodewijk van Asschens
recognised it, on 26th April, 1756, as the bay which Tasman had named.</p>
<p>On 31st May, 1756, Jean Etienne Gonzal named it MOSSEL BAAIJ (Mussel
Bay).</p>
<p>Between the lower reaches of the BATAVIA RIVER and the JARDINE RIVER, near
Cape York, our knowledge of the country is mainly derived from Bradford's
explorations and the surveys made in connection with the construction of the
CAPE YORK TELEGRAPH LINE (1883-6), but Mr. Embley has made important
contributions which deserve to be recorded.</p>
<p>FRANK JARDINE accompanied the Telegraph construction party and by his
knowledge of the Cape York region was able to render them important services.
While travelling with cattle in 1865, north of the Batavia River, until he
reached the head of the Jardine River, the scrub was so thick, the country was
so featureless and the innumerable small creeks were so flooded, that he and
Richardson, his Surveyor, had little idea what became of the creeks as they
fell to the west of his course. The future identification of the creeks to
which he gave the provisional names of South Palm, Rocky, North Palm, Dalhunty,
Skardon, and so forth, was almost impossible. Twenty years later, when the
Telegraph line came to be constructed not far from his course&mdash;in fact,
crossing it at an acute angle&mdash;attempts were made to identify the creeks
which he had named, but it is doubtful, in many instances, if these attempts
were successful. The question is dealt with in the chapters devoted to the
Jardines' explorations.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 656}</u></p>
<p>The names given by the Telegraph survey and the names rightly or wrongly
considered by the Surveyors to be identical with Jardine's original names must,
however, stand, as they have already been sanctioned by long usage.</p>
<h4>DUCIE RIVER</h4>
<p>This is the first river of importance north of the Batavia. (SEE MAP B.) On
a generally westerly course, its heads are crossed by the Telegraph line
between 12&deg; 10' and 11&deg; 52' S. lat., and include what the Jardine
Brothers had originally named the South Palm, Rocky, North Palm (Ducie,
according to Telegraph survey), South Alice and North Alice. Thirty miles west
of the Telegraph line, these heads have come together to form the Ducie River,
which 15 miles further west falls into the estuary of the Batavia River, known
as Port Musgrave.</p>
<p>The river was named in honour of the Earl of Ducie, brother of the Hon.
Matthew Moreton, one of the contractors. It was used in 1884 for the transport
of supplies and material for the construction, the <i>d&eacute;p&ocirc;t</i>,
at the head of boat navigation, being at the point where FRANK JARDINE
afterwards formed his station of BERTIE HAUGH.</p>
<h4>DALHUNTY RIVER, DE FACTO</h4>
<p>According to the Telegraph survey, the Dalhunty River, which falls into the
Port Musgrave estuary, crosses the Telegraph line in 11&deg; 49' S. lat., and
runs WSW. (SEE MAP B.) In one of the chapters dealing with the Jardine
Brothers' exploration of 1864-5, I have given reasons for my belief that the
DALHUNTY RIVER, <i>de facto</i> (of the Telegraph survey), is the Jardines'
SKARDON RIVER, <i>de jure</i>.</p>
<h4>SICARDON RIVER, DE FACTO</h4>
<p>North of the Dalhunty River, the Skardon River, <i>de facto</i> (the Skardon
River of the Telegraph survey) crosses the Telegraph line at the McDonnell
Telegraph Station, and runs west-south-westward to the Gulf of Carpentaria in
lat. 11&deg; 45' S. (SEE MAP B.) Where it crosses the line, Mr. Embley
describes it as having a large deep channel and carrying a large volume of
flood water. I believe it to be, <i>de jure</i>, the CARPENTIER REVIER of
Carstenszoon, who writes, in his diary of the "<i>Pera's</i>" voyage, under
date 11th May, 1623: "We set sail again on a NNE. course along the land. In the
afternoon we sailed past a large river which the men of the '<i>Dulfken</i>'
went up in a boat in 1606, and where one of them was killed by the missiles of
the natives. To this river, which is in 11&deg; 48' lat., we have given the
name of Revier de Carpentier in the new chart." (The latitude is about 3
minutes out, but presumably it was only fixed by the estimated northing after
the latitude had been taken at noon.)</p>

<h4>THE MITCHELL RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES</h4>
<p>ALICE RIVER (MAPS F AND H).&mdash;Mr. Embley's survey of the lower end of
the Alice River, where it falls into the Mitchell near Koolata Station, has
already been referred to. The river is known for 75 miles to the south-west
above its junction with the Mitchell, having beng located at numerous points by
Mr. Embley in 1886-7 in runnien the boundaries of "Koolata," "Dunbar" and
"Coota" pastoral blocks.</p>
<p>PALMER RIVER (MAP H).&mdash;In 1883-4, Mr. Embley surveyed the Palmer River,
as it runs to WSW. for the last 64 miles of its course and finally empties into
the Mitchell River. In this section of its course the Palmer forms the
frontages of "Tharwa," "Strathleven," "Meron Downs" and "Highbury" blocks.</p>
<p>MITCHELL RIVER (MAPS F AND H).&mdash;In 1886-7, Mr. Embley's survey of the
Mitchell River up to the inf all of the Palmer showed the leakage, from the
southern or left side of the main channel, of several smaller channels. Among
these are MAGNIFICENT CREEK, which rejoins the lower Mitchell after an
independent course of 68 miles and itself sends out a branch to the south which
becomes the SCRUTTON RIVER (so named by the JARDINE BROTHERS 111 1864), the
Scrutton falling into the NASSAU RIVER, <i>de facto</i>; and DUNBAR</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 658}</u></p>
<p>CREEK, which runs westward for 75 miles, falling into the Gulf of
Carpentaria in 15&deg; 52' S. lat., its lower part incorrectly known as the
Nassau River (Nassau River, <i>de facto</i>). The whole of the delta country of
the Mitchell has thus been surveyed by Mr. Embley, and the survey is important
if it were only for the precision with which it enables us to chart the travels
of LEICHHARDT and the JARDINE BROTHERS.</p>
<p>For 36 miles up the MITCHELL from the inf all of the Palmer (MAPS H AND G),
the survey of the river was made by MR. W. A. MARKWELL. It shows an interesting
feature, viz., the leakage of the Jardines' MARANIIE CREEK from the south bank
of the Mitchell and its junction, after a course of 72 miles to WSW., with the
STATEN RIVER, <i>de facto</i> (=Nassau River, <i>de jure</i>). Markwell also
surveyed the LYND RIVER (first traversed by Leichhardt) from its source to its
junction with the Mitchell.</p>
<p>In 1886, from a point 14 miles W. by N. of the infall of Leichhardt's Lynd
River, ENIBLEY surveyed the MITCHELL RIVER eastward to its head (Sheets 18D and
18C), a distance of over 240 miles, as well as its great TRIBUTARIES, the
Little Mitchell, St. George, McLeod, Rifle Creek, the Walsh, and the
Hodgkinson. This survey is invaluable, as it enables us to locate a great part
of the wanderings of LEICHHARDT, KENNEDY, the JARDINE BROTHERS, HANN and
MULLIGAN.</p>
<p>MT. Embley next surveyed a portion of the STATEN RIVER, <i>de facto</i>
(MAPS H AND L), and the so-called RED RIVER (Jardines' BYERLEY CREEK) from its
source in the ranges to where it "peters out" on the plains, thus defining an
important section of the Jardine Brothers' route in 1864.</p>
<p>He also surveyed (sEE MAPS M AND N) the upper reaches of most of the RIVERS
falling into the SOUTHERN and SOUTH-WESTERN PART of the GULF OF CARPENTARIA,
his surveys connecting with the marine surveys made by the officers of the
"<i>Beagle</i>" in 1841 and contributing largely to the correct understanding
of the land travels of LEICHHARDT (1845), GREGORY (1856), BURKE AND WILLS
(1861), WALKER (1861), MCKINLAY (1862), LANDSBOROUGH (1862) and NIACDONALD
(1864).</p>
<p>In 1889, he connected, by surveys of run-boundaries, etc., the Nicholson
River and Lawn Hill Creek, both of which water-courses had been surveyed by
Twisden Bedford in 1882. Both of these water-courses, as well as the Gregory
River, have beds which are generally dry until they cross a belt of limestone
country, which, itself almost horizontal, unconformably overlies an older
formation composed mainly of upturned quartzites and fiaggy sandstones. As both
rivers reach the base of the limestone their dry beds are filled with copious
streams, of which, however, only the Gregory continues to flow for a long
distance, Lawn Hill Creek losing its waters on entering into the plains. The
latter, with a small stream,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 659}</u></p>
<p>or generally represented by water-holes, has a northward course, past Lawn
Hill Station (MAP R), till it eventually falls into the Nicholson River (MAP
N). On it, from 7 to 17 miles above (south of) Lawn Hill Station, are many
silver-lead mines. To FRANK HANN, who in the "eighties" owned the station, is
due the credit of his discovery. About 1882 he began to send me samples of the
ores of the district, and it was evident that he was on the track of an
important development. In 1881, on General Feilding's Transcontinental Railway
Expedition, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> I had located copper and manganese
outcrops in the Gregory valley about 40 miles ESE. of Lawn Hill (MAP R), and
was guided by ERNEST HENRY, ALEXANDER MACPHAIL and other pioneers, through the
amazing COPPER BELT extending south-south-eastward from Lawn Hill, via Mount
Oxide, Mount Cuthbert and Cloncurry, to Mount Elliott. It was not till 1908
that I had an opportunity of seeing the Lawn Hill Mines. A RAILWAY now connects
the port of Townsville with Cloncurry, Mount Elliott and Mount Cuthbert, and
but for the interruption of industrial progress effected by the war of 1914-18,
would probably by this time have reached a port on the Gulf, serving the
northern part of the great metalliferous belt, which is at present hampered by
over 500 miles of railway freight, added, in many instances, to a long
camel-back transport.</p>

<p>To facilitate the shipping of live bullocks to Thursday Island, Mr. Embley,
in 1891, took up Thornbury Occupation Licence, near where the Telegraph line
now crosses Black Gin Creek (Sheet 21B). (SEE MAP A.) The Licence of 25 square
miles included RED ISLAND POINT, OD which yards were built. The land is now
held by the Torres Straits Fresh Food and Ice Co., in which Mr. Embley has an
interest. The bullocks were killed and dressed at the Point, and taken by
launch to refrigerating works on Thursday Island.</p>
<p>The homestead at Thornbury was abandoned many years ago and its building
material was removed to Possession Island.</p>
<p>In 1895, in the course of a trigonometrical survey designed to connect
Thursday Island with the mainland, Mr. Embley landed on POSSESSION ISLAND,
where he observed a quartz reef, containing visible GOLD, standing out boldly
from the coral. He traced the reef to the highest point of the island, the
point on which Captain Cook had set up his flagstaff when he formally took
possession of "New South Wales" for Britain in 1770. Mr. Embley and others
worked the reef for some years. The first shaft was sunk where Captain Cook's
flagstaff had been planted. The discovery of gold was made very shortly after
the discovery (in 1894) of REEF GOLD on HORN ISLAND. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> From 1897 to 1901, inclusive, Mr. C. V. Jackson gives
the crushing returns from Possession Island as 3,365 tons for 2,480 ounces of
gold. Up to 30th April, 1896, the crushings from Horn Island totalled 981 tons
for 1,081 ounces 12 dwts.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 661}</u></p>
<p>Had Captain Cook caught sight of the gold which lay beneath his feet when he
landed on Possession Island, could the boldest flight of fancy have ventured to
predict the future history of Australia? If, instead of convicts in the
southern part of the continent, the first settlers had been gold miners pushing
their relentless way from the extreme north and making stepping-stones of one
fresh goldfield after another, along what lines would the occupation of the
island continent have developed?</p>
<p>After 1895, Mr. Embley's pastoral interests more and more occupied his
attention, and in course of time he only undertook occasional commissions from
the Government because other qualified surveyors were temporarily not
available. Still the passion for charting new country never loosed its grip on
him, and he lost no opportunity, as long as he was on the spot, of "filling in"
the geographical features of the Cape York Peninsula. He sold out his interest
in York Downs in 1914, and now resides in Melbourne.</p>

<p><b>A COPY OF JACK'S MISSING MAP GIVEN TO FRANK PATERSON IN 1884. BY MINES

<p>IN the early eighties of last century, Sir Thomas McIlwraith's government
took a very serious view of the commercial and strategic importance of Torres
Strait and of the necessity for telegraphic communication between the Strait
and the capital. An approximate site for the northern terminus of the line was
found on the shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria, within view of Possession
Island, Cook's landing-place. The Post and Telegraph Department commissioned
Mr. John R. Bradford, Inspector of Lines and Mail Route Services, to explore
a</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 663}</u></p>
<p>suitable route commencing, in the south, at the nearest angle of the
Cooktown-Palmerville line. My own recent travels between the two termini had
shown that a Telegraph line was, at least, not impossible, and it may
reasonably be conjectured that my report was taken into consideration before
Mr. Bradford received his instructions.</p>
<p>The Telegraph line, as it was finally constructed, is almost straight, and
the preliminary exploration, the construction and the final surveys have added
so much to our knowledge of the geography of the Peninsula that it can hardly
be regretted that much of it runs through inhospitable and (so far as
horse-feed is concerned) almost desert country. At the same time, better
"going" for the line would probably have been found if more time had been spent
on the preliminaries. If I had to make my journey again, and if my sole object
were to travel from point to point, I should leave the Telegraph line at the
Archer River, hug the western sides of the McIlwraith, Janet and Carron Ranges,
follow the coast-line of Temple Bay, cut off the Cape Grenville triangle and
follow the coast-line of Shelburne Bay, and north of it to the mouth of
Henderson Creek, strike westward along the watershed of the Peninsula (lat.
11&deg; 5' S.) to near the Jardine River, go north and reach the west coast
near Red Island, and follow it to Peak Point. Such a line, had it been taken by
the Telegraph, would have been easier, if longer, than the actual line, and
over better country. Against this is to be set the vulnerability of a Telegraph
line easily attacked from the sea, besides the loss of the knowledge to be
gained, and the facilities afforded, by an inland line.</p>
<p>The exploring party was led by MR. BRADFORD, under whose supervision the
Telegraph line from Cooktown to Palmerville had been constructed in 1874-6. The
team consisted of William Healy (Second in Command), James Cook, William
Macnamara, John Wilson, Jimmy Sam Goon (Chinese) and Johnny (Aboriginal). There
were thirty-six horses (of which thirteen reached Somerset). Each man was armed
with a Martini-Henry carbine and a Colt's revolver, and a fowling-piece was
also carried by Healy.</p>
<p>While in Cooktown making preparations for a start, Mr.. Bradford informs me
that almost all his spare time was employed in copying, from my office copy,
the map which was part of my official report on my two expeditions in the Cape
York Peninsula, and which was not published, for some reason which has never
been explained, and which searches in all possible Departments in Brisbane have
failed to discover. The topography of my map had, however, been embodied in
official maps issued by the Lands Department before my report was officially
issued. Mr. Bradford explains that he called at my office at Townsville in May,
1883, while his steamer lay there on its voyage to Cooktown, and I showed him,
and finally lent him, my office copy of the map. Having</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 664}</u></p>
<p>copied the map, Mr. Bradford, as I had requested him, returned it by the
hand of a member of my family who was at that time on a visit to Cooktown. I
may say that these events, as well as my interview with Mr. Bradford, had faded
from my memory before I began a systematic search for the lost original and my
office copy, and it was not until the receipt of a letter (25th June, 1919)
from Mr. Bradford that I became aware of them. Mr. Bradford furnished such
corroborative details as left no doubt in my mind of the return of the office
copy. I have no doubt, either, that when my office was removed from Townsville
to Brisbane that office copy went with me, along with the whole pile of
manuscripts and maps which had by that time accumulated.</p>
<p>The material received by me (12th June, 1919) from the Deputy
Postmaster-General, Brisbane, consisted of:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">(A) Mr. Bradford's Diary from Cooktown (6th June,
1883) to Somerset (29th August, 1883).<br>
<br>
(B) Blue print (2 miles to an inch) from tracing of southern sheet of First
Section of line, Fairview to Musgrave Telegraph Station (Saltwater Creek). It
shows (1) the line constructed, with mile-posts 1 to 76, (2) Mr. Bradford's
Camps 1 to 5 of 1883, along the line, as subsequently constructed, (3) the
western side of the sandstone tableland between the Hann and Morehead Rivers,
as far as I had sketched it on the return journey of my first trip (1879). The
survey of the line, as constructed, was made by Mr. Healy. (SEE MAP E.)<br>
<br>
(C) Blue print (2 miles to an inch) from tracing of middle sheet of First
Section, Musgrave to Coen Telegraph Station. It shows (1) the line constructed,
with mile-posts 74 to 76, and (2) Mr. Bradford's Camps 7 to 11 (SEE MAPS E, F
AND C), close to the line, as subsequently constructed. The survey of the
constructed line was made by Mr. Healy.<br>
<br>
"(D) Blue print from tracing of northern sheet of First Section, Coen to Mein
Telegraph Station, with mile-posts 141 to 200. It shows (1) my mapping of the
heads of the Peach River as on 1st and 2nd trips of 1879, (2) the line as
constructed, surveyed by Mr. Healy. Mr. Bradford's Camps 12 (Coen) to 17 (Mein)
are not shown, but they have been located from the Diary in the reduction on
Map C (herewith) and none of them are far from the constructed line. (SEE MAP
C.)<br>
<br>
(E) Blue print (2 miles to an inch) from tracing of southern sheet of Second
Section, Mein (south) to Moreton Telegraph Station (north), with mile-posts 167
to 116 (they are numbered from Patterson in the north to Mein in the south). It
shows (1) the Telegraph line, as constructed, (2) my mapping, 1879-80, of
Sefton Creek and the Pascoe River to its mouth, (3) Mr. Bradford's Camp 22.
This camp is a few miles ESE. of the Moreton Telegraph Station. From the Diary
it appears that he crossed the line (subsequently constructed) from west to
east between Camps 18 and 22. I have added Mr. Bradford's route north of his
Camp 22 (SEE MAP B) from data furnished by the Diary, and a tracing (2 miles to
an inch) supplied by the Surveyor-General's Office, presumably taken from Mr.
Bradford's original. (SEE Maps C AND B.)<br>
<br>
(F) Blue print (2 miles to an inch) from tracing of middle sheet of Second
Section, Moreton Telegraph Station in the south (116 miles) to McDonnell
Telegraph Station in the north (60 miles). It shows (1) the Telegraph line, as
constructed, (2) the Pacific coast-line, Temple Bay to Shelburne Bay, taken
from Admiralty Chart, (3) my mapping between the Sir William Thomson Range and
the Pacific (2nd trip, 1880) and (4) Bradford's Camps (1883) 22 TO 32. In the
reduction herewith (MAP B), I have connected these camps by the route line, as
given in the Surveyor-General's tracing, as above. It averages 8 miles to the
east of the constructed line. (SEE MAP B.)</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 665}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">(G) The 2-mile northern sheet of the Second Section
is not among the blue prints supplied to me by the Deputy Postmaster-General.
The Surveyor-General's tracing, however, evidently includes this sheet, and was
no doubt made when the original was extant, or while the first tracing was
still fresh. It extends from 60 miles (McDonnell Telegraph Station) to Zero at
the old Patterson Telegraph Station (for some years the terminus of the line).

This is evidently one of Bradford's original compilations from the map borrowed
from me. It has all my topography from Weymouth Bay to Somerset, and I
recognise my own handwriting, which has been traced. It contains: (1) my route
and camps from Camp 38 (Pascoe River, north of Canoe Creek) north to Somerset,
(2) Bradford's camps and route from Camp 22 (east of Moreton Telegraph Station)
to Camp 49 (Cape York) and Somerset, (3) a line marked "probable course of
line," which, from McDonnell Station to the Jardine River, is about 5 miles
east of the line finally adopted. The latter is not on the map.</blockquote>
<p>It may be observed that Mr. Bradford's copy of my office copy of the map
which was intended to accompany my report written in 1880, and of which it
formed an essential part, is the only copy of that map which has yet been
discovered. Mr. Bradford's copy was "discovered" in 1919, but I had already
redrawn the map from my original note-books, for inclusion in this work. It is
gratifying to note how closely the new plot agrees with the original.</p>
<p>The report is entitled:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"JOURNAL OF CAPE YORK EXPEDITION UNDERTAKEN IN 1883
BY THE POST AND TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENT, J. R. BRADFORD, INSPECTOR OF LINES AND
MAIL ROUTE SERVICES, LEADER."</blockquote>
<p>Having left Cooktown on 6th June, 1883, the party camped at the LAURA
TELEGRAPH STATION from 12th TO 16th June. On the latter date, the camp was
moved to "The Lagoon" on "The Black Soil" (now FAIRVIEW TELEGRAPH STATION), the
point where the new line was to branch off from the existing Cooktown&mdash;
Palmerville line. (SEE MAP E.)</p>
<p>The party left the Lagoon on Monday, ath 7une, and, travelling
north-westward, camped on the 22nd (CAMP 5) near the site of the present
MUSGRAVE TELEGRAPH STATION 011 SALTWATER CREEK. (The constructed line follows
the route closely.) Having crossed, at CAMP 2, what had come to be known as the
"HANN RIVER," another water-course was met with between Camps 3 and 4 and named
the "MOREHEAD RIVER." The two water-courses had become one a few miles to the
north, where Mulligan had crossed and named the Hann River in 1875. The
Morehead is actually the longer head of the river named by Mulligan and ought,
<i>de jure</i>, to bear the name of Hann, but it is now too late to make the
alteration. A tributary of the "Hann" branch was named HEALY CREEK, while a
tributary of Saltwater Creek was named MATVIEFF CREEK, after the Superintendent
of Telegraphs.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 666}</u></p>
<p>Somewhere about Camp 4 or Camp 5, the presence of a POISON PLANT was for the
first time suspected, two of the horses showing symptoms which could not be
explained otherwise. (SEE MAPS E, F AND C.)</p>
<p>Taking a northward course from CAMP 5, the marked tree line to the Coen was
struck on 26th June and followed, via the STEWART RIVER and LALLA ROOKH Station
to the COEN DIGGINGS. The subsequently constructed Telegraph line follows the
route closely.</p>
<p>North of Camp 5, Bradford identified my Camp 35 of 7th September, 1879, my
"View Hill," south of the Stewart River (now known as Fox's LooKouT), my
"NOTICE CREEK" and my "Grave Creek" (more correctly the creek on which I had
observed a grave). Nine days were spent at Lalla Rookh, while beef was
captured, killed and cured. CAMP 12 (8th July) was beside the PROSPECTORS' HUT
at the COEN.</p>
<p>Bradford remarked that the river supposed by the prospectors to be the same
as that named the Coen (by Carstenszoon in 1</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 623}</u></p>
) was not the "true Coen," but merely a head of the JARDINE BROTHERS' ARCHER
RIVER. In this, of course, he was right, as the Dutchman's Coen has a very
short course and nowhere approaches the Telegraph line, but the branch of the
Archer which has its source in the goldfield is almost as long as the Archer
itself, and must have a name. As the goldfield and river have now been too long
known as the Coen to be altered without causing fresh confusion, the Survey
Department has distinguished the river as the SOUTH COEN.
<p>On 9th and 10th July, Bradford travelled NNW., mainly on a ridge between my
CROLL CREEK and a creek to the west of it, which he named BOURNE CREEK, after
the General Inspector of the Post and Telegraph Department. His CAMP 13 was
opposite Mount Croll and his CAMP 14 was where Croll and Bourne Creeks both
fall into the Archer River. It may be remembered that I had provisionally given
the name of PEACH to the ARCHER RIVER, as there was no clue to its identity
with any of the rivers named by the Dutch or the Jardine Brothers. CAMP 15
(11th July) was on the Peach (ARCHER) RIVER On the site Of MY CAMP 13 (2nd
trip, 1879), Bradford having identified it by the marked tree. From Mount Croll
north-north-westward to his CAMP 15, Bradford's route was east of my outward
route on the second trip. Mine was on the top of the Geikie Tableland and his
between that tableland and the Archer River.</p>
<p>The ARCHER RIVER was crossed on 12th July where (as I had observed from the
"View Hill" on Geikie Creek) it makes a breach in the Geikie Tableland. CAMP 17
(13th July) was on Sugar-bag, or SEARY, CREEK, apparently between the site of
the future Mein Telegraph Station and Pine Creek cattle station. From the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 667}</u></p>
<p>Coen to this point, the line, as subsequently constructed, follows
Bradford's track closely, except where he diverged to the west (to CAMP 16)
because the blacks had burned the grass upon which he depended for the
sustenance of his horses.</p>
<p>From MEIN TELEGRAPH STATION, a TELEPHONE LINE is HOVV (1920) being laid to
MERLUNA GOVERNMENT CATTLE STATION, 25 miles to the north-west. It is also the
starting-point of tracks leading to the Nisbet and Hays Creek Provisional
Goldfields, Giblet's Sandalwood Landing on the Lockhart River, Bairdsville and
Plutoville diggings and the Bowden Mineral Field.</p>
<p>From MEIN, the Telegraph line, as constructed, runs about 10 degrees west of
north. Bradford's exploratory track was at times a few miles west of this line,
his CAMP 18 being placed on his map between Merluna and the head of Rocky
Creek. He remarked on this neighbourhood showing "the best country we have seen
since we passed the so-called Coen," and this observation probably led to the
"looking for country" which was followed in 1888 by the occupation of Merluna.
Nevertheless, the condition of the horses supposed to have been poisoned about
CAMP 4 or 5 had by this time become critical and a cause of vexatious
delays.</p>
<p>The necessary data for the exact location of Camps 19, 20 and 21 are not
given by the report. In all probability, the subsequently constructed and
surveyed Telegraph line was crossed from west to east in the neighbourhood of
CAMP 19 (16th July), which was situated on creeks of the "fourth" and "third"
magnitude, and which Bradford conjectures to be heads or branches of the "true
Coen." CAMP 20 was on "a creek of the fourth magnitude, containing large holes
of water." [I take it to have been ROCKY CREEK, a tributary of the Batavia
River.&mdash;R. L. J.] On 18th July, says Bradford,</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We came on the bank of the true Coen River, a wide
stream flowing slowly to the north-west. The banks of this river are high
(perhaps 70 feet) and sound sandy country, no possibility of floods." [This,
which Mr. Bradford took to be the "true Coen River," must have been the
BATAVIA, in its unsurveyed part near the northern edge of Map C.&mdash;R. L.
J.] CAMP 21 was pitched here.</blockquote>
<p>On 19th July, the BATAVIA RIVER was crossed about half a mile below (north
of) Camp 21 "about 200 yards below a waterfall a few feet in height." (SEE MAP
B.) The river was about 10 chains wide, with a sandy bed, and" a good get-in
and get-out."</p>
<p>Here began the bad land, or the WET DESERT, as it is sometimes called. This
region had furnished Kennedy, the Brothers Jardine and myself with some of our
least desirable experiences. I did not think of calling it a "wet desert"
because I traversed it in the height of a bountiful wet season when no place
could fairly be described as wetter than another, but its other objectionable
features, as described by Bradford, are constant and only too</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 668}</u></p>
<p>easily recognisable. Bradford had the bad luck to see even more of it than
any of the previous travellers, and his description may be regarded as the
standard. Writing of the stage of his journey of 19th July, 1883, after the
crossing of the Batavia River, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I steered N. 6&deg; W. In half a mile, over sandy
country,...we came on a narrow gully. Wilson, who was just in advance of me,
tried to cross this gully, but Samson, the horse he was riding, got in a hole
hidden by rushes and weeds and full of water, but not much larger than his
body, though apparently deep enough. There Samson was, with no part of his body
visible but his head. Wilson had a narrow escape, as he was partly under the
horse when he fell. We were detained here for two hours getting the horse out
of the hole. He either could not or would not help himself. The men dug away
the earth all round him and finally hauled him out with ropes."</blockquote>
<p>A mile further N. 6&deg; W. a "creek of the third magnitude" flowing to WSW.
was named ELLIOT CREEK. This creek does not appear on modern maps, but no doubt
it was a tributary of the Batavia River. The WATERSHED OF THE PENINSULA must
have been crossed soon after, on the SIR WILLIAM THOMSON TABLELAND, as CAMP 22
is placed, approximately, in 142&deg; 47' E. long. and 12&deg; 28' S. lat., On
the head of what is now called GLENNIE CREEK.</p>
<p>A mile and a half beyond Elliot Creek, continues Bradford,</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We passed over sandy ridges, in some places so
undermined with ants as to be absolutely dangerous, the horses going suddenly
down to their knees in the sand. These ridges are timbered with bloodwood,
stringybark and ironwood, the spaces between the trees being filled in with
saplings and low undergrowth."</blockquote>
<p>Here the two POISONED HORSES had to be abandoned.</p>
<p>Next day (20th July), the course was nearly north, on the eastern side of
the watershed, CAMP 23 being on the head of a tributary of the Macmillan River.
The country on the Sir William Thomson Range did not improve. "The ridges were
of a reddish sandy soil and were terribly undermined by ants," says Bradford,
"my horse actually sinking on several occasions so deep that his nose touched
the ground," and this sort of travelling made further havoc among the horses.
An ant-hill 20 feet high was noted near the camp.</p>
<p>The journey was resumed on 23rd July, still in a northerly direction. Bogs
and "heather and pandanus swamps" alternated with sandy ridges. Another of the
riding horses had to be dug, and hauled, out of a bog. CAMP 24 was pitched on
what appears to be the principal head of the MACMILLAN RIVER, which had been
followed down for the greater part of the day.</p>
<p>On the 24th and 25th, the travelling, still northward, was of a similar
character. More HORSES showed signs of distress and one had to be ABANDONED.
CAMP 25 was still On tributaries of the Macmillan River, and CAMP 26 was close
to the watershed of the Peninsula. On alighting from his horse at Camp 25,
Bradford had a severe attack Of FEVER AND AGUE.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 669}</u></p>
<p>On 26th July, steering to the west, the WATERSHED OF THE PENINSULA was
recrossed, and CAMP 27 was pitched on one of the heads of the river which Frank
Jardine afterwards named the DUCE, when he was with the Telegraph Construction
party. Another horse was abandoned.</p>
<p>Having learned something from the mistakes of previous travellers in this
region, Bradford had taken the precaution to carry a liberal supply of flour,
and he began at Camp 27 to serve out rations of FLOUR to the starving
HORSES.</p>
<p>From Camp 27 to CAMP 28, the course was again to the north, and in its last
part was almost coincident with the Jardine Brothers' route of 1865 between
their 70th and 71st camps. From Camp 28 to CAMP 29, the course was still north,
and coincident with the Jardine Brothers' route. Both camps were on branches of
what the brothers called the NORTH ALICE CREEK, a tributary of the Ducie River.
The tale of bogs and of horses having to be dug out of treacherous narrow
gullies in." miserable desert country" was repeated on these three stages. Just
after nightfall (28th July), a splash startled the men sitting by the fire at
Camp 29, and a horse, which had been trying to find grass to eat, was found in
a gutter which fitted him so closely that he had to be dug out.</p>
<p>On 29th July, the course was shaped more to the west, in the hope of
escaping from what Bradford called "THE POOREST AND MOST MISERABLE COUNTRY I
HAVE EVER SEEN." Eventually a narrow belt of poor grass was found skirting a
stream of water flowing to the south-west, and CAMP 30 was pitched on it.
Bradford believed the creek to be JARDINES' SKARDON RIVER. Modern maps show
that the SKARDON RIVER, <i>de facto</i> (which I believe to be the CARPENTIER
RIVER, <i>de jure</i>), crosses the Telegraph line at McDonnell Station, 16
miles north of Camp 30. I take the creek at Camp 30 to be the main head of
Jardines' NORTH ALICE RIVER.</p>
<p>From Camp 30 to CAMP 31 (30th July), the course was north, as far as
possible by the supposed Skardon Creek. "For the most part," says Bradford in
describing the view from a small ridge, "there was nothing to be seen but
heather- and scrub-clad ridges in every direction&mdash;a veritable DESERT." He
adds: "These ridges are entirely DESTITUTE OF GRASS. They bear a sort of
heather and a low scrub of oaks, wattles and timbers, the names of which I am
unacquainted with." There were the usual bogs, scrubs and narrow treacherous
streams. At two of the gutters, crossings had to be made, and where this
precaution had not been taken two of the horses came to grief.</p>
<p>On 31st July, Bradford's diary states, regarding the journey northward from
Camp 31:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Followed the creek up to ENE. for one mile; then,
as the creek went due east, I steered NE., gradually coming round to NW. at the
end of half a mile. We were now again on a desolate heath-clad ridge, with
occasional patches of thick low scrub.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 670}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">For another mile I steered NW. over the same sort of
country. I then altered my course to NNW., soon coming on and following down a
small stream falling to NNW. In half a mile we came to a creek of the third,
almost second, magnitude, with a fine stream of water coming from the east and
flowing WSW. This creek I named McDonnell Creek, after the Under-Secretary of
the Post and Telegraph Department."</blockquote>
<p>There can be littledoubt that what Bradford named MCDONNELL CREEK is the
main head of what modern maps name the DALHUNTY RIVER, which I take to be,
<i>de jure</i>, the Jardine Brothers' SKARDON RIVER. It is 13 miles south of
what now appears on the map as McDonnell Creek, which falls into the SKARDON
RIVER, <i>de facto</i> (believed by me to be the CARPENTIER RIVER, <i>de
jure</i>) at the MCDONNELL TELEGRAPH STATION. The misidentification of
Bradford's McDonnell Creek by the party which constructed the line was, no
doubt, responsible for the mistake. They knew from Bradford's report that he
had named a McDonnell Creek in the neighbourhood, and they bestowed the name on
a creek beside what was fixed on as the site of the McDonnell Telegraph
Station.</p>
<p>Bradford crossed his McDonnell Creek, between his Camps 31 and 32, about 4
miles west Of the JARDINE BROTHERS' CAMP 71 (1865) and about 7 miles east of
the Telegraph line which was afterwards constructed.</p>
<p>After this creek had been crossed, Bradford's diary continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I now steered NW. for a quarter of a mile: then
west for another quarter of a mile: then we crossed another tributary gully
from the north. Thick scrub on the banks of the gully. I now steered NW. for a
quarter of a mile over a grass-tree ridge; then NNW. for another quarter over
similar country. We now came on a creek of the fourth magnitude, coming from
the NE. and with dense vine scrub on its banks. We had to cut a track through
the scrub to enable us to cross the creek, first, however, following the creek
up to ENE. for a quarter of a mile. After crossing I steered north, over a
grasstrce ridge, and passing some fairly good bloodwood, if sound. In another
half a mile we came out on the summit of a barren stony heath-clad hill, with
gigantic ant-hills scattered upon it. On distant ridges we could see ant-hills
of all sorts of fantastic shapes. I now followed the crest of the ridge to the
NW. for a quarter of a mile; then NNW. over scrubby hills and gullies. In half
a mile we came on a narrow stream flowing to westward. This place was very
boggy. We had to make a crossing for the horses here. After we had crossed I
still continued NNW. for a quarter of a mile to the top of a ridge. Seeing some
forest country on hills away to the northward, I steered due north. In half a
mile we crossed the crown of another ridge, from which the forest-clad range
could be distinctly seen. In another half a mile to the north we came on a
narrow gutter carrying a stream of water. In crossing this, two of the
pack-horses got bogged, and we had much difficulty in getting them out. Two
hours were spent here. In another quarter of a mile north, we came on a creek
of the fourth magnitude falling to the west (this creek was subsequently named
Cockatoo CREEK, and with a patch of the best GRASS we had seen for days on its
southern bank. As one of the horses (a bay colt) had knocked up on the last
ridge (three-quarters of a mile back) and had to be left there, I camped on
this creek. [What is named Cockatoo Creek by the Telegraph Survey crosses the
line 7 miles north of the McDonnell Station and cannot be Bradford's Cockatoo
Creek.&mdash;R. L. J.] Distance travelled to-day, 7 miles. Country for the most
part a desert&mdash;narrow belts of poor grass on the banks of the larger
creeks. The smaller ones had none&mdash;only heather. Some fair timber on the
banks of the creeks&mdash;bloodwood, ironwood, cypress pine (not much of
this)</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 671}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">and timbers with which I am unacquainted. PLENTY OF
WATER. I have never seen so many streams so close together anywhere else I have
been, Inskip Point perhaps excepted. After we had camped I sent Cook and Wilson
back for the bay colt, which they brought on to camp about 5 p.m. Ironwood
marked B over XXXII."</blockquote>
<p>In consideration of the straits to which the horses had now been reduced,
they were "spelled" at CAMP 32 from 31st July to 6th August. The diary
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Monday, August 6.&mdash;Started from Camp 32 at
10.5 a.m., steered WNW. for half a mile over a sandy ridge, first crossing
COCKATOO CREEK. At the end of the half mile we crossed a small gully containing
water and falling to SW. I now steered NNW. over desert heather ridges with no
timber to speak of. In half a mile we struck a creek of the fourth magnitude,
containing water and falling to WSW. Followed this creek up to ENE. for a
quarter of a mile, and then crossed to the northern bank. Now headed NNW. for
half a mile, gradually ascending to the summit of a ridge--heather, brushwood
and stones. Now went north for a quarter of a mile along the crown of this
ridge, passing to the left of a conspicuous bald hill. Now steered N. 10&deg;
W. for a low opening in the hills. In half a mile, we had to cross one of the
narrow boggy gullies so numerous in this country. All the horses got over
safely (it was only a foot wide) except Samson and Whalebone, both of which
fell in the gutter. We were detained here for two hours, digging these horses
out. Samson is so weak that he could not get on his feet when pulled out,
unassisted. I now steered N. 10&deg; W. again. In 2&frac12; miles of desert
ridges, heather, spinifex, brushwood and scrub, we crossed a narrow boggy
gutter falling NE. and containing a stream of water. I now went north for a
quarter of a mile: then NW. for the same distance: then NNW. for another
quarter: then north for three-quarters of a mile (all desert ridges) to the top
of a ridge: then another half mile to a creek of the fourth magnitude with a
sandstone bottom and a good stream, flowing rapidly to the NE. (This creek was
afterwards named HORNET CREEK.) Samson tumbled into a narrow gutter on the bank
of this creek, and had to be hauled out with a rope. I then followed Hornet
Creek to the NE. for a quarter of a mile, crossing it on a sandstone bar. All
this country is a miserable DESERT, no timber, no grass&mdash;scrub and
heather. After crossing the creek, we steered north for half a mile till I came
on a deep gully falling into the creek. I had to run this gully up for 10
chains to the west before I could cross it: then NNW. for half a mile, and NW.
for a quarter: then north down a gully, for a mile, when we again struck Hornet
Creek, now of the third magnitude and flowing to NNW. We crossed here on a
sandstone ledge, and continued on the same course for a quarter of a mile over
the same sort of desert country. I then steered NNW. along the bank of Hornet
Creek, looking for a place to camp (it was almost sundown). In half a mile we
came to a deep gully containing water, and falling to WNW. In a quarter of a
mile further, we came to a dry rocky (sandstone) gully falling to WNW. In about
up chains further we crossed a rocky creek of the fourth magnitude, falling to
WNW. and containing a rapid stream tumbling over bars of sandstone. In another
1 o chains we came on a deep boggy-banked gully, falling to WSW. and containing
a small stream. It being now dark, and fearing to lose some of the horses in
the scrub (it has been scrub all day to-day), we were forced to camp (CAMP
32A). As there was no grass, and a strong probability of losing some of the
horses in the scrub if they were let go, I had them all tied up all
night."</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to see, on comparing Bradford's description of this day's stage
with that of the Brothers Jardine, when they were between Camps 71 and 73
(1865), getting over the RICHARDSON RANGE, that both parties were on the same
belt of country. The parallel between the two narratives is complete, even to
the</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 672}</u></p>
<p>anathemas so liberally employed. At Bradford's Camp 32, he was about 4 miles
west of the Jardines' track and by the end of the day the tracks had diverged
to about 8 miles. My own track (1880) was about 3 miles east of the Jardines',
while Kennedy's and Jackey-Jackey's (on the "forlorn hope," 1848) was about 2
miles further east.</p>
<p>Bradford's diary continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Tuesday, August 7.&mdash;Started away from last
night's camp at 7.30 a.m. Followed the gully on which we had camped for half a
mile to ENE. through dense brushwood scrubs: then NNW. for half a mile to the
top of a stony scrubby hill: then a quarter of a mile to a gully falling to the
SW. and containing a stream of water. A horse known as Pony knocked up here and
had to be abandoned. We could not stop, as there was no grass, and the horses
had been starving all night. Still continued to NNW. for another quarter of a
mile. When on the summit of a ridge I could see forest timber to the right and,
hoping to find some grass, I made for it. NNE. for half a mile brought us into
the forest, but not into grass. Heather, grasstree and scrub filled all the
interstices between the trees. North for a quarter of a mile. Samson now
knocked up and had to be abandoned, as there was every probability of losing
more horses if I delayed for him. SW. to NW. to N. for half a mile, through
thick brushwood scrub and heather, brought us to the edge of a swamp: no grass,
however. A horse named Olive here showed signs of giving in, streaming with
perspiration, so I sent two of the men to look for grass, while the horses had
a rest for a short time. I now steered NNE. for a mile along the edge of a
swamp. The country became more open, but still the same wretched desert. At the
end of this mile we came on the bank of a river, flowing rapidly to the NW,
with a strong current and a deep stream. This is the MCHENRY RIVER of the
Messrs. Jardine. The men had to make a cutting in the bank before we could
cross the horses. We crossed and camped on the northern bank. All the country
from Camp 32 is of the most wretched description. The SCRUB has almost finished
all our horses. Five of them I daily expect to have to abandon, they are so
poor and weak. They do nothing but carry themselves from camp to camp. Samson
and Pony I cannot send back for, as it knocks too much out of the horses we
have to depend on, perhaps for our lives. RATioNs are getting SHORT also, so I
cannot afford to give them another long spell. No timber whatever suitable for
telegraph purposes on yesterday's and to-day's route. Saw some cypress pine,
but it was miserable stunted stuff. The country we are now camped in is very
poorly grassed.<br>
<br>
"Distance from Camp 32, 15 miles 40 chains.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Healy, who has been out on foot up the river, reports that there is some
very good pine a short distance ENE. of Camp 33.<br>
<br>
"Honeysuckle marked B over XXXIII.<br>
<br>
"Wednesday, August 8.&mdash;Spelling the horses. Healy and I went out on foot
this morning. Very fatiguing work. Only open country on the banks of the river.
Half a mile back from it nothing but scrub, sometimes dense and full of vines,
which made it a very trying job to travel far through it. Cook shoeing some of
the horses. A low waterfall on the river half a mile below the camp. Threw away
a lot of spare horse-shoes and hobbles. Weather showery."</blockquote>
<p>The stages between Camp 33 and Camp 37 were made (9-12th August) on a NW.
course across east-and-west gullies falling into the north-running McHenry
River. The desert character of the country was unchanged, the horses repeating
their unpleasant experiences of bogs, of starvation, of being forced through
cuttings in grassless scrub or brushwood (the latter poisonous), of dropping
into narrow quicksandy gullies, or crossing them by bridges</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 673}</u></p>
<p>improvised by their drivers. CAMP 37 was pitched at the junction of the
McHenry with the Jardine River, nearly 30 miles up the river from where the
Telegraph line now crosses. Here Bradford crossed to the right bank of the
Jardine with the intention of resuming his northward course. (SEE MAP A.) It
is, however, no easy matter to keep a straight course while boring through
scrub, and the party found itself borne unwillingly to the west: it was not
till the 20th August that the low divide between the Jardine River and
Jackey-Jackey Creek was cleared (where the Telegraph line now runs) and CAMP 43
was pitched about 3 miles west of my Camp 68. The country north of the Jardine
River was found to be of the same character as the part of the "desert" already
traversed, and very much as the Brothers Jardine had described the country
south of the river in 1865.</p>
<p>By this time, it was doubtful if any of the horses would live to see
Somerset. Rations for the men were almost exhausted, this anti-climax having
been hastened by the loss of a pack-horse with nearly all the beef. It seemed
as if the last part of the journey would have to be made on foot and on very
short rations.</p>
<p>CAMP 44 (23rd August) lay about 6 miles NW. of Camp 43, on the right bank of
the Jardine River at the inf all of a creek coming from the NE. From a point
near the camp, the GULF OF CARPENTARIA could be seen. CAMP 46 (24th August) was
near the beach, at the mouth of Cowal Creek, its position being fixed by
bearings to islands in the ENDEAVOUR CHANNEL. Here some of the horses had to be
left to recuperate, in the hope that they would be recovered later. CAMP 47 was
opposite RED and ROKO ISLANDS, the latter being by this time occupied by a
PEARL-SHELLING STATION. The locality was considered by Bradford unfit for a
cable terminus, but a more suitable site was found near PEAK POINT.</p>
<p>From this point, Bradford and Healy walked, leading their horses, in two
days, eastward to SOMERSET, where they were hospitably received by FRANK
JARDINE (29thAugust, 1883). The travelling was over better country than had
been seen for many weeks.</p>
<p>Of the original thirty-six HORSES, only thirteen reached Somerset.</p>
<p>Bradford's diary concludes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Saturday, September 1.&mdash;Sent the men, Cook,
Wilson, Macnamara, Jimmy Sam Goon and the black boy Johnny, to Cooktown by the
'<i>Gympie</i>.' Captain Brown, of 'ROKO' fishing station, gave Healy and
myself a passage to Thursday Island in his schooner. We passed the night at
Roko, which is situated between Possession Island and the mainland. On Sunday,
September 2nd, we crossed to Thursday Island. This was an opportunity (quite
unexpected by me) to cross the Straits almost exactly where the cable should
cross, and Captain Brown, living at Roko and having boats pearl fishing all
about the Straits, was the person who could give me the most information about
the soundings, bottom, currents, shortest route, tide, prevailing winds, etc.
We arrived at THURSDAY ISLAND on Sunday evening, September 2nd. I saw Mr. H. M.
Chester and Mr. Wilkie (the Pilot) at Thursday Island, and their advice
coincided with what Captain Brown had told me.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 674}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">"On Wednesday, September 5th. Mr. Healy and I left
for BRISBANE per S.S. '<i>Corea</i>.'<br>
<br>
"Previous to leaving Somerset, Mr. Jardine promised me to recover the saddles,
pack-saddles, etc., planted on August 25th, and he also promised to let me know
when he got them."</blockquote>
<p>As will be seen in the portions of the diary which are quoted in full, Mr.
Bradford carefully noted, on each day's journey, what timber was available for
telegraph poles. It is clear enough, even to an inexpert reader, that an
adequate supply of such timber was more than doubtful. By the time the report
was completed, it had come to be common knowledge that the" life" of cut timber
in the region to be traversed by the line might be set down at little over two
years, owing to the voracity of the WHITE ANTS (termites). In these
circumstances, the Government's decision to erect iron poles throughout was a
wise one.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradford's report was followed, in 1884, by a call for tenders for the
construction of a line connecting Cape York with the then existing
Cooktown-Palmerville Telegraph line at FAIRVIEW, near Laura. LAURA is now
(temporarily, it is hoped) the terminus of a RAILWAY from Cooktown, originally
designed to extend to Maytown.</p>
<p>Through the good offices of Mr. J. Murray, Parliamentary Librarian,
Queensland, and the Hon. James Page, Federal M.P. for Maranoa, the Deputy
Postmaster-General for Queensland has furnished me with the following
authoritative statement, dated 8th March, 1916:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The line is stretched on iron poles supplied by the

<p>The FIRST SECTION (FAIRVIEW TO MEIN) followed Mr. Bradford's route pretty
closely. STATIONS were opened at MUSGRAVE and COEN in 1886. During the
construction, the line was surveyed by Mr. W. Healy, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> Mr. Bradford's Second-in-Command.</p>
<p>The SECOND SECTION was commenced at the northern end, at a point named
PATERSON, which had already been selected by the surveyors of the Lands
Department. The stations on it (from south to north) beyond MEIN are, roughly,
about 60 miles apart, and are named MORETON, MCDONNELL and PATERSON. The last
has now been closed, on the opening of the line to PEAK POINT. Thence, a line,
partly submarine, stretches to GOOD ISLAND, across HORN and THURSDAY ISLANDS.
FRANK JARDINE accompanied the Construction party, taking charge of transport,
assisting in Mr. Frank Paterson's survey as far south as the Ducie River and
giving the contractors the benefit of his local knowledge. He discovered the
DUCE RIVER, which he named after the Earl of Ducie, Mr. Moreton's brother, and
afterwards established BERTIE HAUGH cattle station on this river. The necessity
for water carriage of poles and stores was responsible for a greatly enlarged
knowledge of the courses of the various rivers of the Peninsula. Detachments of
NATIVE POLICE protected the workmen engaged in the construction. One of their
camps was on the then deserted Coen diggings and another on Clayhole Creek,
near Mein. The white officers in charge of the troopers helped materially in
the exploration of the district. For some time, the line and stations had to be
vigilantly guarded against the DEPREDATIONS OF THE NATIVES. McDonnell station
was annoyed for years by systematic pilfering from the potato patch. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<p>The Second Section diverges considerably in parts from Mr. Bradford's route,
and is straighter and shorter, and follows rather better country.</p>
<p>In letters dated 18th February, 1920, Mr. Bradford and Mr. Embley give a few
particulars regarding the second section. The first terminal station was named
after the Hon. Thomas Macdonald Paterson, Postmaster-General. The officer of
the Post and Telegraph Department who supervised the contract was Michael J.
Nolan, <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> and it was part of his duty to lay out
the line.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Died at Toowoomba about 1894.</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Shanahan's "Sidelights," <i>Queenslander</i>, 24th July,

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 676}</u></p>
<p>He surveyed the parts of the line for which Healy and Paterson were not
responsible. On the blue prints furnished by the P. and T. Department (now
administered by the Federal Postmaster-General), the surveys of the existing
line have been laid down on Bradford's maps, showing his route. The route and
line have both been embodied in the 8-mile maps herewith.</p>
<p>The PASTORAL OCCUPATION of the country adjoining the Telegraph line had
progressed northward to Langi cattle station before the construction of the
line was complete. The holdings attached to Langi, Rokeby and Lalla Rookh (SEE
MAP C) had been taken up on account of the markets promised by the Coen
Goldfield. The Brothers Glen and Charles Massy took up LALLA ROOKH, on the
Stewart River, in 1882, and ROKEBY, on the South Coen, in 1884. CHARLES was
KILLED BY THE BLACKS. LANG, on the Archer River, was taken up by Ebenezer Knott
in 1883. Further north, BERTIE HAUGH, On the Ducie River (SEE MAP B), was taken
up by Frank Jardine soon after the completion of the line (say 1888). MEKLUNA,
On the Watson River (SEE MAP C), was occupied by the Watson Brothers in 1888.
One of the brothers (Edwin) was KILLED BY THE BLACKS. YORK DOWNS, on the head
of the Mission River (SEE MAP D), was taken up by Robert Sefton and others in
1885. J. T. Embley, Licensed Surveyor, found it convenient for the work on
which he was then engaged to make the station his headquarters, and
subsequently acquired an interest in it. In 1891, he took up, further to the
north, THORNBURY station, on Black Gin Creek, near Red Island (SEE MAP A).
LOCKERBIE and GALLOWAY STATIONS, near Somerset, were taken up by Frank Jardine
about 1892 and 1895 respectively.</p>
<p>"PINE CREEK" (SEE MAP C), near Mein Telegraph Station, was taken up by
Patrick Fox in 1887, while the line was under construction.</p>
<p>Apart from its primary and obvious use as a Telegraph line, putting the
whole of Australia in touch with the Far&mdash;to Australia the
Near&mdash;East, the line, which is also officially a stock route, has been of
incalculable service to prospectors and others, itself as an infallible guide,
and each of its stations as a <i>point d'appui</i> or city of refuge. The
occupation of the various stations led to a knowledge of all the accessible
"oases" in the desert.</p>
<p>The STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE Of the Cape York TELEGRAPH LINE, if Australia is to
continue to hold and develop the island continent, is self-evident, and there
are many who believe that a RAILWAY LINE is an essential condition of progress.
For his persistent advocacy of this policy, in season and out of season, the
late JAMES DICK, of Cooktown, deserves grateful recognition, although the
scheme has often been derided as visionary, or at best a pious aspiration.</p>
<p>The HON. JOHN DOUGLAS, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> a man of wide views,
who Was once</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Past and Present of Thursday Island and Torres Straits</i>.
Outridge, Brisbane, 1900.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 677}</u></p>
<p>Premier of Queensland, and who was in 1900 Government Resident at Thursday
Island, writing in that year of the transference of the settlement from
Somerset to Thursday Island, observes: "I have often thought that a good deal
was lost when we left Somerset and the mainland...We abandoned...the chance of
a railway, which might have passed through the Peninsula and made our
starting-point for the East, for India, China and even the old country."</p>
<p>European events in 1914-18 have demonstrated the value of STRATEGIC
RAILWAYS, which become trade and mail railways in times of peace, and it is
difficult to imagine a line which could be of greater strategic value to
Australia than one linking Cape York with southern centres of population.</p>
<p>As the completest record of a traverse through the "WET DESERT" while it was
yet in its primeval condition, a very high value attaches to BRADFORD'S REPORT
Of 1883. It seems hardly credible that such a report should not have been
published immediately on its receipt, and that it should have remained for me,
after it had lain for twenty-six years in the pigeon-holes of a Government
Department, to be instrumental in bringing it to light. It is now published
with the permission of the author and the Federal Deputy
Postmaster-General.</p>
<p>From a recent correspondence with FRANK J. PATERSON, and especially from his
letter dated Toowoomba, 1st March, 1820, I am enabled to trace my MISSING MAP.
The original, or a copy of it, was in the Mines Office in 1884, when Mr.
Paterson was furnished with a copy. That gentleman remarks that, owing to the
co-operation of the NATIVE POLICE, the construction party had NO TROUBLE WITH
THE NATIVES. He also mentions that there was a plague of RATS, travelling from
west to cast, while he was camped near Mein. The plague ceased on the
appearance of great numbers of brown SNAKES. He was not in a position to say
whether the snakes exterminated the rats.</p>
<p>After surveying from Paterson to Mein, in 1894 Mr. Frank Paterson (who was a
partner in the firm of Gordon &amp; Moreton) secured a contract for the
erection of the TELEGRAPH STATIONS or "Forts" along the line, and superintended
their construction.</p>
<p>It only remains to be added that Bradford's diary shows that his journey was
not, like my own, made in the wet season, and proves that the wetness of the
"Wet Desert" is its permanent condition, and does not depend on the rainfall of
the moment.</p>

<p>THE demands of Chinese epicures for the toothsome trepang, of the whole
world for buttons, and of wealthy individuals for ropes of pearls, in due time
brought a fleet of "fishers" (very unscientifically so-called) of
<i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> and pearl oysters to the shores of Queensland. In
addition to Australian craft, the schooners, luggers and cutters of eastern
nations descended on the Cape York Peninsula, and the manning of the ships for
the dangerous work soon became an acute problem. The maritime population of
Japan, China, the South Sea Islands and the Malay Archipelago furnished many of
the crews. For a time, while the treasure was still to be obtained at shallow
depths, the labour employed was not necessarily "skilled," but when deep diving
became an essential the skilled labour mostly fell to the Japanese.</p>
<p>For the comparatively unskilled labour required in the early stages of the
industry, a tempting recruiting ground presented</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 679}</u></p>
<p>itself among the aboriginal tribes inhabiting the eastern shores of the Gulf
of Carpentaria. The tribesmen had not yet become sophisticated through contact
with civilised man and there was no Government supervision to interfere with
the freedom of contract. A complete understanding between employer and employed
must have been impossible from the lack of a common language. It was therefore
inevitable that the natives, tempted on board by presents and promises, were at
times inadequately informed of the nature of their duties or the duration of
their term of service. Again, in some instances, women were induced to board
the luggers, having been "sold" by the old men of the tribes for such cheap
considerations as appeal to the cupidity of savages. It was not long before
complaint, friction, violence, sudden death and reprisal began to be heard of.
From time to time parties of prospectors and diggers invaded the Peninsula from
the south, and white men were cruelly slain by the natives.</p>
<p>About the year 1890 the HONOURABLE JOHN DOUGLAS, who was Premier of
Queensland when I arrived in 1877, was Government Resident at Thursday Island.
The relations existing between the natives and their white, or coloured,
employers had for some time given him deep concern, and he had obtained the use
of the steamer "<i>Albatross</i>" for patrol work among the "fishers" and in
the coastal districts. Occasionally parties of native police, under white
inspectors, were landed with the object of inquiry or redress, but on the whole
Mr. Douglas thought the position very unsatisfactory. One of his ideas was the
establishment of a chain of MISSION STATIONS all along the west coast of the
Peninsula, and 1891 found him, together with two Presbyterian clergymen,
Messrs. Hardie and Robinson, looking out for a suitable spot for the first
experiment. The site selected was near CULLEN POINT and just inside of PORT
MUSGRAVE, the land-locked estuary at the mouth of the BATAVIA RIVER. (SEE MAP
B.)</p>
<p>The first mission to the aborigines of the Peninsula was established in 1896
at CAPE BEDFORD, 16 miles north of Cooktown, under charge of the Moravian
Brother, Fleir1. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> (SEE MAP E.) An out-station
is situated 6 miles to the north. The mission is still in operation.</p>
<p>A Lutheran Mission established a station on the BLOMFIELD RIVER, 30 miles
south of Cooktown, in 1887. (SEE MAP G.) It was extant in 1896, when Mr. Meston
wrote his report, but has since been abandoned.</p>
<p>The Church of England established a mission named YARRABAH at CAPE GRAFTON,
near Cairns. (SEE MAP G.) It was opened in 1892 by the late REV. J. B. GRIBBLE
and is now conducted by his son, the REV. ERNEST GRIBBLE.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Report on the Aborigines of Queensland, by Archibald Meston,
Special Commissioner under Instructions from the Government. Brisbane, by
Authority, 1896.</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 680}</u></p>
<p>In 1905, the same Church established a mission, named Trebanaman, on
Trebanaman Creek, one of the mouths of the MITCHELL RIVER, with out-stations
named ANGERAM, KOONGALARA and DAPHNE. (SEE MAP F.) An area of about 500 square
miles has been reserved for this mission. Through the instrumentality of the
missionaries at the Trebanaman base, considerable additions have been made to
the geography of the MITCHELL DELTA, and these have already been referred to
when dealing with the Mitchell. While prospecting for a suitable site for the
first mission station in 1892, Mr. J. B. Gribble and Inspector Roland W.
Garraway, of the Native Police, were attacked by natives at one of their camps
on the Mitchell delta.</p>
<p>The Moravians, under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church of Australia,
established missions at MAPOON (1891), WEIPA (1898) and AURUKUN (1904). (SEE
MAPS B AND D.) In 1914, the Presbyterians established a mission station on
MORNINGTON ISLAND in the Gulf of Carpentaria, off the south-western base of the
Peninsula and near the north-western corner of Queensland.</p>
<p>In something like a quarter of a century, Douglas' idea of dotting the
Queensland shores of the Gulf with mission stations has been fully
realised.</p>
<p>I am not in a position to form any opinion regarding the comparative values
of the mission work done by the various bodies of Christians already mentioned.
In the matter of the EXPLORATION OF THE CAPE YORK PENINSULA, however, the case
is different, and I have no hesitation in asserting that the greatest services
have been rendered by the PRESBYTERIAN MORAVIAN MISSIONARIES. It is only fair,
however, to say that the Church of England improved its comparatively limited
opportunities in the Mitchell delta, and that the Blomfield, Cape Grafton and
Cape Bedford missions were planted in localities which had already become so
well known that few geographical problems remained to be solved.</p>
<p>In the last days of 1864, when the BROTHERS JARDINE made for the backbone of
the Peninsula, far to the east, to avoid the floods which would surely have
overwhelmed them on the setting in of the wet season, had they kept to the west
coast, they missed the mouth of the Archer, and left the west coast country
between the mouths of the Archer and Batavia Rivers unexplored. It was this
tract of country which was destined to be the theatre of operations of the
Moravian Brothers.</p>
<p>The history of their explorations is inextricably mixed up with that of the
mission, which is gathered for the most part from ARTHUR WARD'S "MIRACLE OF
MAPOON." <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The geographical information given in
this book by the brother of the pioneer missionary, Jas. G. Ward, is only a
by-product, but, like many</p>

<p>other by-products, has an unexpected and gratifying value of its own.</p>
<p>A working agreement between the Australian Presbyterian body and the
Moravian Brotherhood had been arrived at as early as 1863, with the result that
several missions to the aborigines were established in the southern portions of
Australia.</p>
<p>NICHOLAS HEY was born in 1862 at Doerrenbach, Bavaria. At the age of
thirteen, when his father died, he assumed the care of the paternal farm, and
kept the home together till his mother died, eleven years later. He then
volunteered for the Moravian Mission, and was accepted and sent to Niesky
training college, where he found a congenial comrade in JAMES GIBSON WARD, an
American, the son of a Moravian missionary in Jamaica. The two friends were
afterwards sent to Ireland and subsequently to Australia. Their arrival in
North Queensland was opportune, as Mr. Douglas was even then maturing his
scheme for the establishment of the first of a chain of mission stations, and
they were entrusted with the initial experiment, which was to be made at Cullen
Point. Mr. and Mrs. Ward and Mr. Hey arrived at Thursday Island in November,
1891, and made arrangements with Mr. Douglas for the establishment of the
mission.</p>
<p>The missionaries first saw "MAPOON," the site at CULLEN POINT, on 28th
November, 1891, when the "<i>Albatross</i>" and the steamer "<i>Dicky</i>"
brought them from Thursday Island, with a white police constable and two native
troopers, four carpenters and the material for the construction of a house.
(SEE MAP B.) There were also on board eight natives of the Batavia district,
who were believed to have been illegally recruited by pearlers, and who were to
be repatriated.</p>
<p>Sir Horace Tozer, Home Secretary, had intimated a GRANT OF THE LAND for the
mission.</p>
<p>After a few days' delay, Ward took the "<i>Albatross</i>" 27 miles up the
BATAVIA RIVER. For some time Mr. Douglas visited Mapoon monthly in the
"<i>Albatross</i>."</p>
<p>By July, 1892, it had become apparent that the headquarters of the mission
had been unhappily chosen as far as horticulture or agriculture was concerned.
Mr. Douglas took Mr. Ward on a cruise in search of a more suitable site, and on
this cruise Ward contracted a fever which was to be his death. They visited the
inlet then erroneously known as the COEN, and which was subsequently named the
PENNEFATHER RIVER (lat. 12&deg; 15' S.), and also PINE CREEK (lat. 12&deg; 30'
S.), now appearing on the map as NOMENADE CREEK, Nomenade being the native
name for pine. (Whoever changed the name had ample justification in the
plethora of Pine Creeks in Queensland.)</p>
<p>Mr. Hey married Mrs. Ward's sister in December, 1892.</p>
<p>About the end of 1893, the mission fell into popular disfavour</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 682}</u></p>
<p>under circumstances connected with the murder of two white pearlers on the"
SCHEARDEN RIVER," <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> the murder being attributed
to the Batavia River tribe. Mr. Douglas had some difficulty in preventing the
launching of a volunteer punitory expedition from Thursday Island. Subsequent
rumours of further murders fanned the agitation. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> On 17th January, 1894, the steamer"<i>Kanahooka</i>"
was wrecked in the Gulf near Normanton, and the heroic conduct of the
missionaries and their black flock, in saving and succouring the survivors,
restored the mission to popular esteem.</p>
<p>From September to December, 1894, Ward and Hey were busy looking for a site
for a second station up the Batavia River, but did not meet with Success. On
3rd January, 1895; WARD DIED of the fever which had attacked him eighteen
months before. His widow left for Brisbane and Mr. and Mrs. Hey were left alone
at Mapoon. Ward's place was taken by Edwin Brown in 1895, and Mrs. Ward
returned to Mapoon to take charge of the mission school.</p>
<p>In September, 1895, HEY, accompanied by a digger named Rigby and two black
boys, rode out from Mapoon in search of a SITE FOR THE SECOND STATION.
Following the Batavia River for 40 miles&mdash;say to 12&deg; 23' S. lat.,
striking south for 12 miles to Myall Creek and following that creek upward,
they reached, in four days, YORK DOWNS CATTLE STATION (long. 142&deg; 19' E.,
lat. 12&deg; 44' S.), 8 miles south-west of the Jardines' Camp 64, of 8th
January, 1865. (SEE MAP D.) Here they found MR. J. T. EMBLEY, Licensed
Surveyor, who was at this time making the station, which was conveniently
situated for his work, his headquarters. It appeared that he had had trouble
with the blacks (who killed his cattle) and was consequently in sympathy with
the mission and its aims. He set out to guide the party to PINE CREEK. They
travelled WSW. via BROWNSTONE CREEK, and they found themselves in course of
time on the south, or left, bank of a tidal river (the EMBLEY). Retracing their
steps till the horses could cross (which must have been near the infall of
Brownstone Creek) to the right bank, they "SELECTED A SITE between two creeks,
and returned to YORK DOWNS." On this site, the WEIPA MISSION STATION now
stands, on the infall of Spring Creek (long. 142&deg; 7' E., lat. 12&deg; 43'
S.). From YORK DOWNS they reached MAPOON, following the BATAVIA RIVER for the
latter part of the journey, and noting by the way a "suitable site" for a
mission station, of which nothing has been heard since.<b style=

<p>It appears that Mr. Embley, who in course of time acquired an interest in
York Downs Station, had reported to Mr. Douglas early in December, 1895, that
he had TAKEN SUPPLIES FOR THE STATION FROM THE WEST COAST in a cutter drawing 3
feet of water by way of a river emptying into the large bay situated between
Duyfken Point and Pera Head.<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Mr. F. C. Urquhart
had seen the mouth of the river six years before. The river was, in fact, the
one on which "WEIPA" was subsequently to be built.</p>
<p>The river (the EMBLEY) on which "Weipa" was to be built was SUPPOSED by Hey
TO BE THE PINE RIVER (NOMENADE CREEK), the existence of the intervening Mission
River being then unknown. Douglas, who arrived at Mapoon shortly afterwards
(say October, 1895), had visited the mouth of the Pine River four years
earlier, and now objected to the proposed new station that if it was really on
that river, the shallow bar would render it inaccessible by water. To solve the
doubt thus raised, HEY chartered a boat and spent a week in exploration, his
first excursion, to the PINE RIVER, confirming Douglas' objection. Thereupon he
took the boat about 10 miles to the south-east, and rounding Andoomajattie
Point, entered the mouth of "a large river with a big native camp near it," and
sailed up the river for 15 or 20 miles.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"To his surprise, he recognised it as the
continuation of the MYALL CREEK on which YORK DOWNS stands, and which was
supposed to run into the PENNEFATHER or COEN RIVER <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> to the north. As no white man had ever been up it
before <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> and it was not on the map, he called it
the Mission River. Sailing down the stream again, and then turning south, he
found an estuary, which soon divided into two rivers. He followed the main
stream, HEY RIVER, first, but finding that it led him too far south, he turned
after following it for about 3 miles. The other proved to be the river on which
he had fixed the site for the new Weipa Station. He reported his discoveries to
Mr. Douglas, who immediately sailed for Mapoon with the Inspector of Police,
and picking up Hey there, went on to view the newly opened up territory...Mr.
Douglas named the BAY into which the rivers flowed after the
'<i>Albatross</i>.' He adopted the name Hey had given to the first, the MISSION
RIVER. The main stream of the two to the south, he called the HEY and the
tributary the EMBLEY." <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b></blockquote>
<p>"Just after the '<i>Albatross</i>' reached MAPOON again," continues Arthur
Ward, "two other gentlemen arrived, who had travelled overland from Cooktown,
inspecting the police and telegraph stations on the way. They had done the last
45 miles in the Mapoon whale-boat, which had been sent up the BATAVIA to meet
them.</p>

to be the "MAIN STREAM" and not the Hey, as the former is navigable by boats
for fifteen or twenty miles, while the latter, as shown on the 4-mile

twelve miles, when it runs out into a number of insignificant
water-courses.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 684}</u></p>
<p>One of the newcomers was MR. FITZGERALD, an Inspector of Police." Mr.
Fitzgerald reported on the Mapoon Mission Station:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"It appeared to me a perfect success&mdash;the
result of common sense, courage and good temper applied to savages...I feel
convinced that under such management the work of civilization will be extended
without the assistance of police. I should think it reasonable to station
another missionary with Mr. Hey, to assist him in his plucky and solitary life.
The work accomplished exceeds anything I have seen in my experience among
natives extending over more than thirty years."</blockquote>
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
<p>"The Government immediately afterwards," says Arthur Ward, "initiated that
policy which has led, step by step, to the creation of an unbroken NATIVE
RESERVE extending from the Batavia to the Archer River, with the missionary as
its administrator, and the prohibition of all recruiting of lugger crews within
that territory." The Reserve was proclaimed in 1904 and extended in 1908, and
comprises an area estimated at 1,345 square miles.</p>
<p>In 1896, on the instructions of Sir Horace Tozer, Home Secretary, MR.
ARCHIBALD MESTON and MR. W. E. PARRY-OKEDEN, Commissioner of Police, visited
the Mapoon Mission to report on the aboriginal question, the former in July and
the latter in October. As a result, in 1897, PARRY-OKEDEN was appointed
PROTECTOR OF THE ABORIGINES and MESTON AND DR. ROTH ASSISTANT PROTECTORS for
the south and north respectively. The offices were, however, only held for a
few years, and the protection of the aborigines has now been added to the
duties of the Inspectors of Police.</p>
<p>The second mission station, at WEIPA, was established in 1898, under the
charge of EDWIN BROWN.</p>
<p>In October, 1891, HEY sailed from Mapoon in the mission lugger "<i>J. G.
Ward</i>," and selected a site for a THIRD STATION, which was named Aurukun,
and was opened by MR. AND MRS. ARTHUR RICHTER and HARRY LOUIS, a Samoan, in
1904. This station is situated on the right, or north, bank of the WATSON RIVER
at the infall of the WARD RIVER. (Lat. 13&deg; 20' S.)</p>
<p>Some further geographical details have been kindly supplied by Mr. Hey, to
whom I applied for information:&mdash;</p>
<p>In 1901, Hey explored the lower reaches of the ARCHER RIVER. He describes
the last 6 miles as "an entanglement of islands and water-courses." Above this,
the river has a deep narrow channel.</p>
<p>In the same year, he discovered and named INA CREEK and the WARD RIVER, both
north of the Watson. In 1895 he named JANIE CREEK, between Mapoon and the
Pennefather River.</p>
<p>In 1914, he entered an inlet which is shown on the 4-mile map of 1908, Sheet
21A, on the north side of Port Musgrave, and found a river which he named the
NAMALATA (Messenger).</p>
<blockquote>[1) I have a great respect for the judgment of Mr. H. Fitzgerald,
whom I have known since 1879.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 685}</u></p>
<p>PORT MUSGRAVE and the lower reaches of the DULIE and BATAVIA RIVERS were
surveyed by Mr. E. A. CULLEN, of the Harbours and Rivers Department, in May,
1887. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> (SEE MAP B.)</p>
<p>The conclusions and recommendations embodied in the reports of Meston and
Parry-Okeden differed widely.</p>
<p>MR. MESTON'S REPORT, which was issued about the middle of October, 1896,
recommended the total abolition of the native police, and the performance of
all police duties, except tracking, by white men. The white police should
cultivate the friendship of the natives, and besides affording them protection,
should try to reconcile hostile tribes. The mission stations and telegraph
offices should be regarded as centres for the distribution of food. Reserves
should be created where certain of the aborigines could be collected to form a
permanent home, and marry and beget children, and live happily, free from all
contact with the white race, except those placed in charge to establish order,
distribute the food supplies and teach them gardening and farming, so as to
make the reserves, as far as possible, self-supporting. <i>Apropos</i> of the
latter proposal, he expressed in the strongest terms the conviction that the
mission stations had been planted in situations unsuitable for cultivation.</p>
<p>Meston claimed to have a very special knowledge of the manners and customs
of the blacks, having been "among them since seven years of age." It was
therefore possible for him "to establish friendship with even the wildest and
most suspicious tribes." He adds, in his report: "Henceforth there would be no
hesitation on my part in going alone and unarmed through all those between whom
and myself a mutual confidence was created. The prevalent mischievous delusion
concerning the supposed 'treachery of the blacks' is the result of complete
ignorance of aboriginal character. 'All war,' according to Carlyle, 'is a
misunderstanding.' Such have been most of the miserable contests between the
black and white races in Australia."</p>
<p>It may be remarked that it cannot be otherwise than difficult to replace the
mutual suspicion and watchfulness of blacks and whites by a complete
understanding of the motives and intentions of the other party. What may have
been possible to a man of Mr. Meston's early experience must be absolutely
impossible to the rank and file of pioneers and prospectors.</p>
<p>MR. PARRY-OKEDEN, Commissioner of Police, who set out On his northern
travels immediately after the issue of Mr. Meston's report, was also well
equipped for the investigation, having already a considerable knowledge of the
natives and understanding some of their dialects. His experience had led him to
the conclusion</p>
<blockquote>[1) Mr. Hey's letter of 15th April, 1915, and Report by Mr. Hugh
Milman, Acting Government Resident at Thursday Island, on Port Musgrave and the
Batavia and Ducie Rivers. Brisbane, by Authority, 1887.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 686}</u></p>
<p>that the wild or "myall" aborigines are "impulsive, fickle, cunning and very
treacherous." "Instance after instance," he observes, "of the blackest
treachery could be given, though, I grant, isolated instances of the most
touching fidelity and even noble forbearance have occurred among them; still,
as a race, like nearly all savages, they are most vilely treacherous. Friendly
relations can only be established by affording equal protection and dealing out
even-handed justice to both races." He remarks, however, that, especially on
the east coast between Cape Grenville and Princess Charlotte Bay, there are few
"wild" blacks who have not come more or less into contact with the white race.
[My own observation, I may say, leads me to the conclusion that they are none
the better for the contact. Beggary, thieving and prostitution are the usual
results of the intercourse, except where it is rigorously supervised by
authority.&mdash;R. L. J.]</p>
<p>Parry-Okeden freely admitted defects in the native police system as it
existed when he came into office. "As the Native Police has been lately
working," he writes, "it has apparently confined its operations to retaliatory
action after the occurrence of outrages, and seems to have dropped all idea of
employing merely deterrent or conciliatory methods; but I intend to change all
that. It is the craving for animal food that urges the blacks to kill cattle,
and I think that in many instances they are not conscious of interfering with
property not belonging to them, but regard cattle roaming in the bush as food
natural, and, as such, their lawful prey; and in many instances there is much
contributory neglect of their stock on the part of the owners. The facilities
thus afforded for gratifying their carnivorous instincts has had considerable
effect in lessening the prevalence of cannibalism."</p>
<p>"As an auxiliary to the work of the police," says Parry-Okeden, "I strongly
advocate the forming of additional mission stations, to be subsidised by the
Government during the continuance of good work, the sites to be carefully
selected and approved of by Government."</p>
<p>Like Meston, Parry-Okeden strongly favoured a policy of cultivating an
understanding with the natives, and judged that in the Native Police was the
readiest machinery for this purpose. He condemned with abhorrence the
instructions issued in 1866 for the guidance of the officers, and still
unrescinded in 1896, although evidently to a great extent tacitly relaxed, to
the effect that they were "to use every exertion to prevent their troopers from
having any communication with the aborigines in their districts," and "at all
times and opportunities to disperse any large assembly of blacks without
unnecessary violence."</p>
<p>While condemning the Native Police system, as then working, as unsuitable to
existing conditions, Parry-Okeden vigorously defended the staff,
remarking:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 687}</u></p>
<p>"The Native Police have had in the past a most difficult duty, and their
officers have borne a heavy burden of responsibility. In the carrying out of
that duty under most adverse conditions, many of them lost their lives, some
have been severely wounded, and others have spent a lifetime of hardship in
protecting life and property and in honestly carrying out, on the very
outskirts of civilisation, the responsible work thrust upon them. Let the
outside squatter, the pioneer and the prospector, whose evidence is really of
value, testify."</p>
<p>His recommendations included the creation of Native Reserves and a
reorganisation of the Native Police Force, with the distinct substitution of a
policy of understanding for that of dispersal.</p>
<p>In 1896-7, when Parry-Okeden visited the Peninsula, the northmost camp of
the Native Police was on Clayhole Creek, a tributary of the Batavia River (lat.
13&deg; 5' S., long. 142&deg; 53' E. See Queensland 4-mile Map, Sheet 20C.) A
POLICE RESERVE, of 840 square miles, further north, was gazetted in 1904. This
reserve is practically a triangle, with its southern base running along the
parallel of 12&deg; 30' S. lat. and thus including a long reach of the Batavia
River, and its northern apex on the Telegraph line in lat. 12&deg; 2' S., its
north-north-east side being the Telegraph line and its north-western side
marching with the Mapoon Mission RESERVE FOR THE ABORIGINES. (See Queensland
4-mile Map, Sheet 21A.)</p>
<p>The importance of the "Aboriginal Question" may be inferred from the number
of the native inhabitants. In 1896, 1'Ieston estimated the number of the
aboriginals north of the 17th parallel at 20,000. I was under the impression
that this was an over-estimate, but the Rev. John Jones, Secretary of the
Church of England Board of Missions, with whom I have discussed the subject,
considers it under the mark, at least at the present day, basing his opinion on
the ground that the Mitchell district alone, in which the mission operates, has
an estimated population of 5,000. In all probability the Mapoon Mission
district has at least as many, and then there is a considerable outside
population to be accounted for. To my inquiry if the numbers were decreasing,
Mr. Jones replied that, on the contrary, he believed they were on the increase,
in consequence of the removal of certain factors which formerly acted as checks
on increase, such as tribal warfare, infanticide, the restriction of marriage
to the old men, and so forth.</p>
<p>I see no reason to doubt that in late years the police and the missionaries
have done good work in the interests of the native population. At all events,
we rarely read nowadays of depredations and murders by the blacks. On the
missions they have learned that starvation need not be feared, as food can
always be obtained in return for a certain amount of work. They are instructed
in some light work, such as agriculture, the care of cattle and domestic
duties. It is not considered wise to confine them too rigorously to what a
modern school of philosophy stigmatises as the slavery</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 688}</u></p>
<p>of wage-earning. It is realised that the aborigine, "though ne'er so tamed,
so cherished and locked up, hath still a wild trick of his ancestry," and that
his nature demands an occasional bout of freedom when the "wanderlust" drives
him forth to revel in the delights of the chase, or, at the proper season, to
enjoy the kindly fruits of the earth, lying in the sun and letting the ripe
nonda drop into his open mouth. He, in his turn, has learned to realise that
man-hunting and cattle-hunting "for the pot" are improper and unprofitable
recreations.</p>
<p>It is not within the scope of this work to settle the "Aboriginal Question,"
but the future of the Australian aborigines may offer problems of its own to
future generations. If it is really the case that the aboriginal population is
increasing, seeing that the reserves have become preserves (as is maintained by
an authority already quoted), it is possible that a number of the original
lords of the soil may yet bear a part in the destinies of the Australian
continent.'</p>
<p>Thus far I had written in 1916. A year later, events took place which
reopened the aboriginal and mission questions, and which, incidentally, shook
my confidence in the conclusions I had previously reached on the subject.</p>
<p>The Presbyterian Mission Station on MORNINGTON ISLAND was established in
1914, when the Rev. Robert Hall, formerly assistant at the Weipa Mission, was
appointed Superintendent. (SEE MAP N.) He was accompanied by his wife, and was
assisted by Mr. Walter Owen, whose wife was also resident on the island. It
appears that the Superintendent acts as a magistrate and is the only civil
authority on the island, and that the missionaries are unarmed. The native
population is estimated at from zoo to 400, and it is believed that the great
majority had at one time or other visited the mission: in fact, the inhabitants
had nearly all taken up their residence in the vicinity. A school had been
established and had twenty-one children on the roll. The natives were at first
employed in clearing the land and getting timber for the mission, and took
kindly enough to a little agriculture on their own account</p>
<blockquote>[1) Mr. Hey, who has recently retired from the Mapoon Mission,
after twenty-eight years' service, assures me that the pure-blooded aboriginal
race of the north is hastening towards inevitable extinction. The future of the
extreme north of Queensland, he considers, lies with a mixed race. This
startling view seems a lame and impotent conclusion, but if there is anything
in it, it raises many difficult questions. For instance, granting that the
mixed race, under capable overseership, can carry on cultivation and other
industries with profit, after how many generations of dilution with white blood
(rarely, at least in the first generation, of the best quality) will its
individual members be fit to be entrusted with the franchise and other duties
and responsibilities of citizenship in a "white Australia "?&mdash;R. L. J.,
16th January, 1920.<br>
<br>
Interviewed for the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> (7th December, 1920), the Rev.
E. R. B. Gribble, Superintendent (1913-20) of the Forrest River Mission,
Western Australia, expressed views agreeing in the main with those of Mr. Hey,
as far as the future of the aborigines is concerned. "The remnant of the race,"
he avers, "is now in the north of the continent, and is doomed to disappear
unless steps are taken to ensure segregation," and he adds that "it is better
to improve their native conditions than to Europeanise them." They can be
uplifted, but he does not claim that they can be brought, in one generation, to
the level of present-day civilisation.&mdash;R, L. J., 9th December
1920.]</blockquote>

<p>as soon as they understood that their produce would be carried to the
Thursday Island market in the mission lugger.</p>
<p>All seemed to be going well when Mr. Hall, on 18th October, 1917, set out on
a tour of inspection, with two black boys and three horses. It is stated that
on the night of 18th-19th, four ABORIGINES, Peter, Myall, Jimmy and Dick,
KILLED MR. HALL when he was asleep. Peter is said to have hacked his head off
with a tomahawk.</p>
<p>On the night of 20th October, MR. OWEN, who was asleep on the mission
verandah, was surprised by a party of eight, said to include Peter, and SHOT
through the right shoulder with a shot-gun (afterwards identified as the one
Mr. Hall had taken with him). In spite of his wound, Mr. Owen grappled with his
assailants and threw two of them off the verandah. Mrs. Owen next appeared upon
the scene, with a gun, whereupon the natives fled. Mr. Owen fainted from loss
of blood, and was attended to by the ladies, who barricaded the house.</p>
<p>On the 21st, Mr. Hall's horse found its way to the mission and an old gin
appeared clad in Mr. Hall's blood-stained singlet. Next day Peter and others
appeared before the house, armed with spears. When the women fired at them they
decamped. Eventually the two ladies and Mr. Owen reached Burketown by the
mission boat on 3rd November. Before they left the island they had sent out
native scouts to inquire into the fate of Mr. Hall.</p>
<p>The police made investigations which resulted in the trial of two parties of
aborigines, before the Supreme Court at Townsville on 6th March, 1918. Peter
pleaded guilty to the murder of Mr. Hall, and was sentenced to death, and the
charge against the three other natives above-named was withdrawn. Peter also
pleaded guilty to the charge of attempting to kill Mr. Owen, and the jury
brought in a verdict of not guilty in the case of seven others charged with the
crime. It is rumoured that Peter's sentence was commuted to deportation to one
of the State cattle stations in the Peninsula.</p>
<p>[The above particulars are mainly taken from the <i>Sydney Morning
Herald</i> of 6th and 7th November, 1917, and 6th March, 1918, and the
<i>Queenslander</i> of 10th November, 1917.]</p>
<p>It is asserted that Peter, a "civilised" native, was mortally offended by
the refusal of Mr. Hall to give him tobacco. Mr. Hall was a conscientious and
uncompromising opponent of the use of tobacco.</p>
<p>It is well known that most of the Torres Strait islands have been overrun by
Papuan tribes, who have gradually ousted the Australian inhabitants. One
important question arising out of the Mornington Island murder is that of the
race responsible for it. On this point I consulted Mr. Hey, whose answer (16th
January, 1920) was that the islanders are pure Australian aborigines,</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 690}</u></p>
<p>but more backward than their brothers of the mainland; for instance, they
have inferior wimmeras and spears without barbs, and, having no canoes, make
their limited voyages astride of floating logs. The Papuan invasion has,
therefore, not yet reached Mornington Island.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
The position of the "Revier" named the COEN by JAN CARSTENSZOON, of the
"<i>Pera</i>," in 1623 has been misunderstood ever since 1802. A marginal note
in Carstenszoon's diary states that the river is in 13&deg; 7' (S.) latitude.
FLINDERS, in the "<i>Investigator</i>" (1802), marked an inlet in 12&deg; 13'
S. lat. as "probably Coen R. of the old charts." In the "eighties" or
"nineties," during the HON. JOHN DOUGLAS'S administration, this inlet was</p>
<p>named the "PENNEFATHER OR COEN RIVER." About 1878, GOLD was found at the
"Coen" DIGGINGS, on the eastern side of the Peninsula, by prospectors who
imagined their river to be that marked on the map of the time as the Coen
River. The river (which should be called the "SOUTH COEN") eventually proved to
be a BRANCH OF THE ARCHER and neither Flinders's Coen nor the genuine and
original Coen of Carstenszoon.</p>
<p>Carstenszoon's diary was unknown to Flinders, but it is the sole
authoritative document concerning the position assigned by him to the Coen, and
it must therefore be studied with care. In my view, undoubtedly the true
reading of the diary is that late in the evening the anchor of the
"<i>Pera</i>" was dropped near the shore. Early in the morning&mdash;but
probably not before daylight&mdash;a boat party landed and, having observed
footprints of men and dogs going north, followed them till they came to a river
where there were ESCULENT HERBS. They fell to, with a will, gathered a load of
the anti-scorbutic treasure and made their way back. Just as they reached the
boat they were AMBUSHED BY NATIVES, who were beaten back with the loss of one
man shot and one taken prisoner. When the boat finally brought the explorers
alongside the "<i>Pera,</i>" the midday observation had just been taken. The
anchorage was in 13&deg; 7' S. latitude. (SEE MAP D.)</p>
<p>All the doings of the shore party took place between dawn and noon. Some
allowance of time must be made for breakfast. Following the tracks of the men
and dogs was a slow process ("This delayed us a considerable time," says
Carstenszoon). The gathering of herbs at the "Coen Revier" no doubt also took
some time, and the return journey to the boat with the load was probably also
slow. Then the fighting and rowing out to the ship must have taken time and the
party were alongside at midday.</p>
<p>Altogether, if the party walked 8 miles (4 north and 4 back) they did well.
Accordingly I thought that the Coen might be 4 miles north, and placed the
"revier" in 13&deg; 4' S. lat. It was evident that no river falling into the
sea in that position could</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 691}</u></p>
<p>have a long course, as the Ward River runs parallel to, and only 7 miles
east of, the coast-line.</p>
<p>Having arrived at these conclusions, I wrote to the Surveyor-General's
Office asking if the coast-line between Pera Head and the mouth of Ina Creek
(12&deg; 55' to 13&deg; 12' S. lat.) had been exhaustively examined for inlets
or water-courses, with the result that I was supplied with a SKETCH-MAP
forwarded by the REV. A. RICHTER, of the Aurukun Mission Station, in 1913. The
latest issue of the 4-mile Sheet 20D (1908) showed nothing between Pera Head
and Ina Creek except the mouth of a small unnamed water-course in 12&deg; 59'
S., and this water-course was shown on Mr. Richter's sketch-map and named
Norman Creek.</p>
<p>I wrote to Mr. Richter (1st November, 1918) asking if he had any further
information on this part of the coast. The reply (5th February, 1919) came from
MR. NICHOLAS HEY, who informed me that Mr. Richter had left the mission in
1913: Mr. Richter's map was compiled from information supplied by Mr. Hey, and
was correct except in two particulars: (1) that the water-course in 12&deg; 59'
cannot be called a creek, but is only a runnel of fresh water during the wet
season; (2) between this runnel and Ina Creek, the only creek is one which
enters the Gulf in 13&deg; 4' S., to which it is proposed to apply the name of
NORMAN CREEK. He adds that pigweed is abundant in the neighbourhood and is
known to and eaten by the natives.</p>
<p>This information finally settles the question of the position of the
"<i>Pera's</i>" COEN RIVER. It has long ago been proved that the "Coen," now
the "South Coen" River of the goldfield, is a tributary or branch of the Archer
River. Flinders's identification of the "<i>Pera's</i>" Coen with the inlet now
known as the Pennefather River is even further astray.</p>
<p>The runnel of fresh water in 12&deg; 59' S. referred to by Mr. Hey must be
the "<i>Pera's</i>" WATERING-PLACE of 9th May, 1623}. It is thus further
described by Mr. Embley in a letter to me dated 10th August, 1916: "The
waterplaets is at Pera Head. These headlands are about 80 feet high in this
locality and consist of soft reddish and whitish sandstone. The red is most
conspicuous as being uppermost and gives rise to the expression 'low reddish
cliffs' (see Admiralty Chart, corrected to 1896, and 4-mile map, 1908). After
the wet season (April and May), small soakages of fresh water may be noticed
oozing out from the base, and it is this which must have given rise to the
waterplaets."</p>
<p>In addition to the Coen River, Mr. Richter's map, as corrected by Mr. Hey,
shows the fresh-water heads of the HEY RIVER, the WARD RIVER and its
tributaries, tributaries of Mr. Emblcy's KOKIALAH CREEK (itself a tributary of
the Watson River) and the numerous salt-water channels at the mouth of the
ARCHER.</p>

ROUTE TO MOUTH OF PASCOE RIVER. EMINENCES IN THE RANGE LOCATED AND
UNWARRANTABLY MAPPED AS "RANGES." THEY SHOULD BE "HEIGHTS" OR "HILLS."</b></p>
<p>IN the year 1880, I found that the portion of the divide to which I had
given the name of the McIlwraith Range had come to an end as a distinct
geographical entity in about 12&deg; 54' south latitude. (SEE MAPS C AND B AND
ADMIRALTY CHART, NO. 2345.) Here we met a number of south-running streams,
which we traced downwards till they conjoined to form an important water-course
which proved, contrary to all expectations, to be the upper reaches of the
PASCOE RIVER, and, as we had followed down its right bank until the river (then
in flood) had become unfordable, we had to build a canoe to ferry our loads
across, to avoid being forced down to the Pacific. This remarkable river rises
in a range of mountains close to the Pacific (Lloyd Bay), runs southward,
westward, northward and eastward for about 75 miles till it finds an outlet
into the same ocean in Weymouth Bay (12&deg; 30' S.). It thus describes a
figure closely resembling the capital letter C. The greater part of the area
circumscribed by the letter is occupied by a mountain mass (comparable to that
of Mount Elliott, near Townsville), to which I gave the name of the JANET
RANGE. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Geographically, it forms an entity and
imperatively demands a name of its own. It belongs entirely to eastern or
Pacific waters. The "GREAT DIVIDE" bears off to the west and north-north-west
between the Pascoe River, which falls into the Pacific, and the Batavia River,
which falls into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Here it takes the form of a sandstone
table- land presenting an escarpment to the cast and a gentle slope to the
west, the actual line of the parting of the waters being therefore almost
coincident with the top of the escarpment. To this portion of the divide I gave
the name of the SIR WILLIAM</p>
<blockquote>[1) After my wife.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 695}</u></p>
<p>THOMSON RANGE, in honour of the leader in science and philosophy who was to
be known later as Lord Kelvin.</p>
<p>As regards the JANET RANGE and its eastern slopes which are washed by the
Pacific Ocean, the progress of marine surveying can be traced with an approach
to accuracy by a careful study of the legend attached to Admiralty Chart, No.
2354, of which two editions may be compared. The first of these issues or
editions <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> is that by which my party travelled
in 1879-80, after I had prepared a skeleton map on which the outline of the
coast, as charted from the sea, was backed by the blank interior which had to
be filled in by land exploration. Kennedy, it will be remembered, had already
marched to his death over part of this very country, but his notes and charts
had perished with him.</p>
<p>The only coastal place-names on this edition (in the region under
consideration) are CAPE WEYMOUTH (Cook, 1770), RESTORATION ISLAND (Bligh, 1789)
and the PASCOE RIVER. Lieutenant Pascoe, who died in Melbourne in February,
1898, and who was a son of Nelson's flag-lieutenant at Trafalgar, <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> commanded H.M.S. "<i>Salamander</i>" when she brought
the marines to Somerset in 1863, <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> and the
Pascoe River may therefore be assumed, on fairly solid grounds, to have been
named after him.</p>
<p>For an explanation of the additional place-names appearing on the coast-line
and within the area occupied by the Janet Range, we have to go to the second
issue of Chart No. 2354. Its title is verbally identical with that of the first
edition up to and including the reference to the "<i>Salamander</i>," with an
addition as in the following footnote. <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b> CAPE
GRIFFITH was, no doubt, named by Lieutenant Pirie, in honour of the late Sir
Samuel Griffith, Chief Justice of Australia, who was Premier of Queensland in
1886, and again in 1890-3. ALBATROSS COVE must have been named by the same
officer after the small steamer employed under the Hon. John Douglas in
patrolling the Gulf and Straits pearl-shell and <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i>
fisheries. (It has already been pointed out how</p>

observations from the sea or from the coast. They may have been guided through
the range, for by this time it was well known to gold prospectors, sandalwood
getters, and tin-miners. It is equally evident that they had before them as a
specific objective the following up of KENNEDY'S steps towards the last
disastrous camp near the mouth of the Pascoe. With the help of the
"<i>Paluma's</i>" charting, it is possible to follow the expedition in this
portion of its course to the scene of the great tragedy, as it has been
depicted by Carron, one of the three survivors, and, because of Kennedy's
death, the sole historian of his expedition. It is greatly to be regretted that
the chart was not accompanied by a narrative.</p>

<h4>MINUTIAE OF MARINE SURVEYS, <i>continued</i></h4>
<h4>H.M.S. "DART" AND THE MACROSSAN RANGE, 1896-8</h4>
<p><b>MACROSSAN RANGE RECOGNISED AS SEPARATE FROM MCILWRAITH RANGE AND NAMED IN
1880. "DART" LOCATES ITS SUMMITS AND NAMES THEM "RANGES."</b></p>
<p>IN the early days of Australian cartography, and on theoretical grounds, the
watershed or dividing line between the rivers flowing towards the Gulf of
Carpentaria and those flowing towards the Pacific was known as the GREAT
DIVIDING RANGE, and sometimes, for the reason that it was generally close to
the Pacific coast, as the COAST RANGE. As exploration progressed, however, it
became obvious that the watershed was frequently, through considerable
stretches of latitude, no range at all, and could only be approximately mapped
on such rare opportunities as were afforded by the drying up of flood-waters
which lay inches deep on downs or plains. Moreover, the line of watershed was
often found to be separated by well-defined low country from distinct
north-and-south ranges to which the term of "coast range" could be applied with
strict propriety, as their eastern slopes dipped into the Pacific and even
their western slopes drained into that ocean.</p>
<p>In 1880, the prospecting party which I was guiding found that a portion of
the Great Divide assumed the character of a mountain mass south of the Coen
Goldfield and extended northward until it was lost to sight in the distance.
This mountain mass I named the MCILwRAITH RANGE. After boring our way through
the jungles which clothed it at the heads of the Archer River, via Geikie
Creek, we found ourselves looking eastward across low country to a range or
sierra, extending from LLOYD BAY (Cape Direction) TO OPPOSITE HAY ISLAND, i.e.,
from 12&deg; 51' to 13&deg; 39' S., which I named the MACROSSAN RANGE. As such
it appeared on the official maps of the Lands Department as soon as my report
(which defined its limits) was received by the Government.</p>
<p>The greater part of the western slope of the Macrossan Range is drained by
the river (running northward into Lloyd Bay), which I named the LOCKHART, which
also drains the eastern slope of a portion of the McIlwraith Range. The central
part of the Macrossan Range is drained on the west by the southward-running</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 699}</u></p>
<p>NISBET RIVER, which takes the drainage of part of the McIlwraith Range on
its right bank, and enters the Pacific at Campbell Point. The southern portion,
about 4 miles long, is drained by a creek, still unnamed, which falls into the
Pacific opposite Hay Island.</p>
<p>The MACROSSAN RANGE is breached by HAYS CREEK and the NISBET RIVER,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> but in spite of this accident it is a
geographical entity distinct from the portion of the "great divide" to which
the name of the McIlwraith Range had been given, and it sends the whole of its
waters to the Pacific. (SEE MAP C AND ADMIRALTY CHART, NO. 2,921.)</p>
<p>In 1896, MR. J. T. EMBLEY, Licensed Surveyor, was at work in this district
on behalf of the Department of Lands. After coming down the Stewart River to
its mouth (14&deg; 4' S.), he travelled along the beach northward to Cape
Sidmouth (13&deg; 25' S.), making, on his way, surveys of the lower portion of
the ROCKY RIVER (13&deg; 46' S.), the whole of the CHESTER RIVER (13&deg; 42'
S.) and the NISBET RIVER from its mouth (13&deg; 33' S.) up to where it begins
to cut through the western wall of the Macrossan Range. The portion of the
range south of the Nisbet River appears for the first time on the 1899 issue
(corrected to October, 1900) of the Admiralty Chart, Sheet 2921, as the EMBLEY
RANGE. Mr. Embley assures me that he is not responsible for the name, which
therefore may be assumed to have been conferred in compliment to him by the
Admiralty surveyors. Three of its peaks are named ROUND MOUNT (1,052 feet),
COLLINS HILL (396 feet) and HOBBS HILL (684 feet).</p>
<p>In 1896-8, this portion of the Pacific coast was surveyed by H.M.S.
"<i>Dart</i>" (an "auxiliary" cruiser), and the result was a new issue of Sheet
2921 of the chart. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<p>There can be no reason to doubt that the officers of the "<i>Dart</i>" made,
in 1896-8, a careful survey of the eastern part of the Macrossan Range,
locating and ascertaining the altitudes (up to 1,660 feet) of no fewer than
seventy points on or near its crest.</p>
<p>Practically two methods of establishing a base-line for triangulation are
open to marine surveyors. The first, which is "rough and ready," but in many
cases is the best that circumstances permit, is to take two assumed or
ascertained positions of their ship as the terminals of the line. The second is
to go ashore and act as land</p>

<p>surveyors do, i.e., to measure a line between two fixed points. The latter
course was probably adopted by the "<i>Dart</i>." Mr. Embley informs me that,
happening to be in the neighbourhood in 1896, he did not meet the men of the
"<i>Dart</i>," but saw two beacons which he took to mark the ends of what would
obviously be a useful base-line.</p>
<p>Following the Macrossan Range from south to north, we have already seen the
portion south of the Nisbet River whittled off and renamed the EMBLEY RANGE. It
must have been felt, however, that some slight recognition was due to the
MACROSSAN RANGE'S priority of sixteen years, and accordingly the name is left
unaltered between 13&deg; 22' and 13&deg; 32' S. (where the range is breached
by the Nisbet River). Eighteen eminences are distinguished in the range thus
restricted, viz., one of 158 feet on the left bank of the Nisbet, one of 194
feet near the mouth of the river, TURREL HILL (578 feet) to the west of the
last mentioned, one of 243 feet further north, WHALE HILL (1,005 feet, 13&deg;
29' S.; 143&deg; 32' E.), one of 705 feet, about 2 miles to the north, PLANT
PEAK (1,602 feet, 13&deg; 27' S., 143&deg; 30' E.), a line of unnamed eminences
1,240, 792, 439, 279, 205 and 202 feet, running ENE. from Plant Peak to Cape
Sidmouth, one of 133 feet, 2 miles north of Plant Peak, CONE PEAK (1,660 feet)
2 miles still further north, and a cluster of adjacent peaks 1,512, 1,631 and
1,334 feet respectively.</p>
<p>North of the last-mentioned peaks, the Macrossan Range from 13&deg; 22' to
Hays Creek becomes the HOWARD RANGE, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> with
peaks of 982, 1,005, 834, 875, 1,031 (HORN HILL), 1,504 (TABLE MOUNTAIN) and
1,351 feet (HANCKLIP PEAK).</p>
<p>Between Hays Creek and 13&deg; 13' S. another joint of the Macrossan Range
is transformed into ADAM RANGE. From south to north, peaks are distinguished
rising to 966, 1,268, 1,343, 1,407, 1,419, 1,391 and 1,430 feet (EVE PEAK). On
the coast, north of the mouth of Hays Creek, is HAYS HILL (142 feet). It was
graceful to remember our first parents when honours were being distributed.</p>
<p>From 13&deg; 13' to 13&deg; 11' S., a further section of the Macrossan Range
becomes the MESTON RANGE, <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> with three peaks of
1,298, 1,331 and 1,338 feet respectively.</p>
<p>The Meston Range is succeeded by the VALLEY HILLS, covering about one minute
of latitude, with three eminences of 879, 900 and 607 feet.</p>
<p>North of the Valley Hills comes the CHESTER RANGE, <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> (13&deg; 10' to 13&deg; 5' S.), with eminences of
1,025, 1,080, 1,098 (CHESTER PEAK), 1,065, 810, 955 and 790 feet.</p>

<p>is designated the HIGH RANGE. On its crest, from south to north, eminences
of 1,610, 1,365, 1,250 and 910 feet are distinguished, and the GRASSY HILLS
(485 feet) lie to the east, close to the coast.</p>
<p>The last portion of the Macrossan Range to receive a distinctive name lies
between 13&deg; and 12&deg; 55' S., and is called HEMING RANGE. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> Its prominent peaks are named BARE HILL (267 feet),
CLEVELAND HILL (about 600 feet), HEMING PEAK (1,020 feet), NORTH PEAK (780
feet) and an unnamed peak (about 800 feet) between the two last.</p>
<p>From North Peak, the continuation of the range north-north-eastward for 5
miles to CAPE DIRECTION (12&deg; 51' S.) is indicated on the chart by a narrow
ridge. A "clump" of 306 feet is shown in 12&deg; 54' S., while the last 2 miles
contain a peak distinguished as DIRECTION HILL (490 feet) and another (unnamed)
of 375 feet.</p>
<p>The only justification, in custom or ethics, for the deliberate cutting up
of a range, 47 miles in length, which had stood on official maps for at least
sixteen years and whose limits had been defined in Parliamentary Papers, into
nine different ranges would be that the new names were bestowed in ignorance of
the name by which the range was already known; but this suggestion is
contradicted by the fact that the original name is allowed to stand on the
chart, although restricted to 10 nautical miles.</p>
<p>I should be the last to deny the right of surveyors to give distinctive
names to eminences which they for the first time chart with accuracy, provided
they have not already been named, but to make NINE RANGES out of a single range
is beyond all reason: even the imprimatur of the Royal Navy cannot alter an
established fact. The original quasi-generic name of MACROSSAN RANGE must stand
for the whole; but segments of the range, although they may contain
distinguishable eminences, have no claim to be recognised by more than
quasi-specific names. Having been improperly named "ranges," they must be
reduced in status to "hills" or "heights." In future maps, the names, from
south to north, should read: EMBLEY, HOWARD, ADAM and MESTON HEIGHTS, VALLEY
HILLS and CHESTER, HIGH AND HEMING HEIGHTS.</p>
<p>It may be taken for granted that MAY and HAZELGROVE REEFS, in Lloyd Bay,
were named respectively after the Lieutenant and Boatswain of the
"<i>Dart</i>."</p>
<p>The legend or title of Sheet 2920 of the Admiralty Chart issued on 24th
November, 1879, <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> shows that the "<i>Dart</i>"
was surveying in 1896 between Cape Weymouth (Restoration Island) and Cape
Direction. [SEE MAPS B AND C AND ADMIRALTY CHARTS, Nos. 2920 (3140) AND 2921.]

<p>on the face of the chart (except, perhaps, May and Hazelgrove Reefs), it may
he conjectured that her activities during this period were confined to

<p>I am tempted to add (although it may be somewhat <i>ultra crepidana</i>)
that the "<i>Dart</i>" was built in 1858 as a yacht for an English nobleman,
and in 1918 was doing service, under Captain I. A. Hathcrfield Newman, as a

<p>WILLIAM BAIRD had been employed in the field by RICHARD DAINTREE, my
predecessor as Government Geologist. He was one of the first to work on the
ETHERIDGE GOLDFIELD. From the Etheridge, he and some others set out on a
prospecting expedition before Hann's party discovered gold on the Palmer. They
turned back at the Mitchell, however, convinced that only country of pastoral
value lay to the north.</p>
<h4>MOUNT ROMEO TIN MINES</h4>
<p>His earliest recorded success in prospecting was his discovery of stream tin
at MOUNT ROMEO (so called after his black boy), on the head of the Annan River,
26 miles south of Cooktown, in January, 1887. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
(SEE MAP G.) The discovery followed that made by ROBERT BAIRD in the scrub at
the head of the ANNAN and BLOMMFIELD RIVERS, and was shortly afterwards
followed by the opening of LODES OF TIN ORE at Lion's Den, Mount Amos, Mount
Browning, Mount Hartley, etc. When I visited Mount Romeo in February, 1887,
there were about 100 men doing well on stream tin. The district is still a
producer of stream and lode tin, although the centre of the former has shifted
to the Blomfield (China Camp). There are extensive hydraulic workings at CHINA
CAMP and preparations on a large scale are being made for DREDGING the lower
reaches of the ANNAN. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>

<h4>BATAVIA RIVER (BAIRDSVILLE) GOLDFIELD</h4>
<p>BAIRD'S PINNACLES, weathered fragments of the sandstone of the GEIKIE
TABLELAND, form a notable landmark for travellers On SEFTON CREEK and the heads
of the BATAVIA RIVER. (SEE MAP C.) Under their shadow, William Baird found
payable alluvial GOLD in RETREAT CREEK in October, 1892, and a goldfield was
proclaimed in the following year. "Although 2,000 ounces of gold were won, the
miners lost the run of gold and soon left the locality. The gold was of very
high value, realising up to &pound;4 4s. 8d. per ounce. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>Warden A. R. Macdonald (afterwards Under-Secretary for Mines) visited the
field in 1892 and reported the presence of 150 men, only a few of whom, within
a limited area, were on good gold. The largest NUGGET he heard of weighed 38
ounces.</p>
<p>In 1892, BAIRD AND INSPECTOR MARRETT, of the Native Police, marked a TRACK
from BAIRDSVILLE to the mouth of HAYS CREEK. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<p>In 1901, WILLIAM MCKEAN and PETER SHIVERS, assisted by Government to a small
extent, made an attempt to rediscover the run of gold at Bairdsville, but did
not find "enough to pay for tucker." They also prospected several reefs, but
without payable results. <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> DICKIE, DICK and
SHEFFIELD spent some time on the same quest in 1910, meeting only with some
prospects which they thought might pay in a wet season. In Dick's sketch-map,
the creek which was the scene of Baird's discovery is named BLACK GIN CREEK,
although it is called RETREAT CREEK in the earliest official notices. The creek
falls into the left, or southern, bank of the BATAVIA RIVER, about 8 miles
north of Bairdsville. Important developments were to take place further down
the Batavia River to the west some years after the abandonment of
Bairdsville.</p>
<p>Although others had left the field, WILLIAM BAIRD stuck to it till 1896,
when he was KILLED BY THE BLACKS, who surprised him while he and two other men
were engaged in digging a trench.</p>
<p>Mr. J. T. Embley, who knew him well, sums him up as a good prospector but a
poor business man. Mount Romeo turned out thousands of pounds worth of tin for
him, and yet he left the field a poor man. Mr. Embley had supplied him and his
party with rations for the trip which led to the gold discovery at Bairdsville.
Baird had with him his black boy Romeo, and two men (not diggers) who went by
the names of Yellow Billy and Frenchy. After he had located "nuggety alluvial
gold," he put on wages men to work it, without supervision. The inevitable
consequence was, says Mr. Embley, that "although he had the best claim on a
very rich little field, my share (which was to be one-fifth) worked out at 4
ounces=&pound;16."</p>

DEATH IN 1920.</b></p>
<p>No prospector since Mulligan has done so much for the Cape York Peninsula as
JOHN DICKIE. Unfortunately, he has written very little, and only a meagre
account of his work can be compiled from his scanty reports and from references
in official publications. I am indebted for some information to an unpublished
article by the late James Dick.</p>
<p>Born about 1848, Dickie followed the avocation of a miner, but the
fascination of exploration gradually came more and more to interrupt the steady
pursuit of his calling. His earnings were always devoted (sometimes with the
addition of Government funds, and sometimes with a limited private "backing")
to prospecting ventures. His discoveries have added considerably to the natural
resources of the State and led some individuals to wealth, but have been of
little material benefit to himself.</p>
<p>Dickie generally prospected alone, and for the most part travelled on foot.
Bushman enough to find his way, he was unfortunately no adept in recording his
experiences and he troubled himself little about maps. Consequently, when he
returned from a trip he had little information to give, although he could, if
necessary, lead others to the scene of his labours. In a few instances he was
accompanied by mates who used maps and whose writings added something to the
sum of geographical knowledge.</p>
<p>His habit of lonely wandering necessarily exposed him to danger from the
BLACKS, with whom, however, he rarely came into bodily collision. In one
instance he owed his escape to a ruse. Travelling from Western Australia to
Queensland, he was making for a gap in a range, when he observed a large number
of natives keeping pace with him on the heights right and left of his course.
When at length he halted after dark near the gap, he hung balls</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 706}</u></p>
<p>of phosphorus to the trees around the camp and exploded two half-plugs of
dynamite. That an ambush had been planned was evident from the number of
spears, dilly-bags, food, etc., which he found next morning just beyond the
gap, and which had been hurriedly abandoned on the "supernatural" alarm. The
date and locality of the adventure are not recorded.</p>
<p>DICKIE and two other well-known prospectors, WILLIAM LAKELAND and WILLIAM
BOWDEN, lay claim to the discovery of WOLFRAM at the PASCOE about 1887. (SEE
MAP C.) Tungstate of iron (which warlike preparations and war itself have since
raised to a high price) was, of course, valueless at that time. Lakeland,
however, gave a sketch and directions to a party of prospectors, G. Brown,
Williamson, Evennett, Enright and Stait, who opened the BOWDEN MINERAL FIELD
(where MOLYBDENITE&mdash;even more in demand than wolfram for warlike
purposes&mdash;and TIN OXIDE occur as well as wolfram) in 1904. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>The first of Dickie's journeys in the Cape York Peninsula to which I am
able, from documentary evidence, to assign a date was undertaken in 1887, when
he was prospecting for tin north of the PASCOE RIVER. (SEE MAP B.) On that
occasion he found CAPTAIN STEPHEN CLARK, with a party of men, "WORKING TIN 6
miles from the mouth of the Pascoe River." <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b>
This seems to indicate a locality in the neighbourhood of "CARRON HILL." Dickie
himself found WOLFRAM in "a range of bald hills" about 8 miles north of the
Pascoe, which would be about "HUXLEY HILL." In the same hills, he says, but
nearer to the coast, there was "payable tin from the roots of the grass
downwards," but it could not be profitably worked for want of water. The "bald
hills," Dickie says in another paragraph, are "about 90 miles in a bee-line
from the Wolfram Camp at the head of the Pascoe River."</p>
<p>The fact that a point 8 miles north of the Pascoe is only 36 miles from the
southern corner of the "Wolfram Camp" (now Bowden Mineral Field) and not more
than 40 miles front the most distant part of the Pascoe River is an example of
Dickie's vague ideas of the distances travelled by him.</p>
<p>"At that time" (1887), Dickie adds, "CAPTAIN THOMSON, of the A.U.S.N.
Company, floated a company to mine for WOLFRAM in an island in Torres Straits
right opposite the bald hills referred to." In no sense could any point in the
Carron range be "fright opposite "an island in Torres Straits except in that,
as Euclid maintained, a straight line may be drawn from any point to any other
point. Dickie's observation may, however, be taken as evidence that wolfram was
known in some island of Torres Strait as early as 1887.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 707}</u></p>
<p>In all probability this (1887) trip of Dickie's is the one of which James
Dick gives further details in the unpublished article already referred to and
in a letter to me dated 24th August, 1915. It appears that Dickie was landed by
CAPTAIN THOMSON at CAPE WEYMOUTH. His equipment consisted of a piece of calico,
a blanket, a gun, a quart pot, tea and sugar and a bag of oatmeal. "Alone and
on foot, he made his way to civilisation, locating tin on the way."</p>
<h4>DISCOVERY OF HAMILTON GOLDFIELD</h4>
<p>DICKIE, who had been prospecting single-handed since 1898, with assistance
from the Government, reported the discovery of ALLUVIAL GOLD on 2nd January,
and REEF GOLD on 27th January, 1900. The new goldfield was "provisionally
"opened on 12th March and "proclaimed" on 13th July.</p>
<p>The present township of EBAGOOLAH is on a plateau about 800 feet above the
sea. (SEE MAP F.) The first "rush," which took place in March, 1889, was to a
camp about a mile north of the township of Ebagoolah, which was surveyed
without delay. Its population for the first year was estimated at 330. A
five-head BATTERY was erected, and by the end of 1900 had crushed 226 tons of
stone for 806 ounces of gold, while alluvial gold amounted to 12,000 ounces. A
ten-head BATTERY from the Coen was installed on the Hamilton in 1901. "The only
conspicuous hills within many miles of the camp," says LIONEL BALL, "are Old
and New Mounts Ryan and Mount Lee-Bryce. New Mount Ryan, which lies south of
the camp, rises to about 1,100 or 1,200 feet above sea-level."</p>
<p>In his report (written in 1901) Ball gives the population of the township at
300 to 400. Thirty lines of REEF were being worked when he wrote. Water was
scarce, the domestic supply being from a well. The ALLUVIAL GOLD was of poor
quality, worth only &pound;2 16s. per ounce, and was partly recovered by
"dry-shaking," the tailings being stacked for further treatment in the wet
season. The heaviest NUGGET (found in CORBETT'S CREEK) was 100 ounces. DICKIE'S
P.C. GULLY is between the old Post Office and the Police Camp. Dickie himself
did not make much out of it, and soon sold out his claim. From one claim on
NUGGETY GULLY, 1,200 ounces of gold were obtained. DUNWICH, JACKSON'S,
PETERSON'S, DICK'S, CORBETT'S and other GULLIES are mentioned by Ball as
prolific sources of alluvial gold, while it lasted. He believed that although
the alluvial gold had already been nearly worked out, the Hamilton would prove
a "permanent" reefing field. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>VIOLETVILLE, another reefing centre in the Hamilton Goldfield,</p>

<p>is about 10 miles S. by E. of Ebagoolah. It was discovered in 1901. James
Dick found it deserted in 1907, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> after
crushings amounting to 560 tons had yielded 1,464 ounces of gold.</p>
<p>YARRADEN, a third reefing centre within the Hamilton Goldfield, is on the
King River about 3 miles south of Violetville. It was opened about 1902 by
Keating. The quartz had at first to be carted 14 miles to Ebagoolah, but
subsequently a battery and cyanide plant were erected by Carless. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> The population was estimated at 100 in 1902.</p>

<p>Dickie contended that at one time the Hamilton field carried over 1,000 men
and that therefore he was entitled to the standing reward of &pound;1,000. He
received &pound;500. <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b></p>
<p>After selling his interest in Ebagoolah, Dickie led a party over country
between the LUKIN (Holroyd) and the COLEMAN. Throughout this region he found
reefs of a character similar to those of Ebagoolah. <b style=
"color:#603000">[4]</b></p>
<p>A report by Dickie dated Ebagoolah, 18th July, 1901, appears in the
Queensland Government Mining Journal, Vol. II, p. 384, under the heading of
"Prospecting in the Gulf Country."</p>

<p>The party LEFT that Native Police camp, PALMERVILLE, On 29th January, 1901.
(SEE MAP G.) First travelling 14 miles NNW., they found GOLD, but not in
payable quantities, in granite country in a creek (ANNIE CREEK 0 falling into
the Palmer. Similar country extended NNE. to the head of the KING RIVER (the
Palmer King, not the Coleman King). The King was run down for 10 miles from its
head, when the course was altered to NW. After Jo miles on this course, the
party traversed, for 12 miles, a "desert," in which there were no
water-courses. The following 6 miles, to the NW., were on granite country with
"plenty of very fine-looking REEFS," running N. and S. and dipping W. No GOLD
was seen in the reefs, but "colours" were got in the surface rubble. This was
probably near the PHILP GOLDFIELD (the so-called Alice).</p>
<p>From this point, Dickie led 20 miles NNW. to what he supposed to be the
Edward River, but which is much more likely to have been POTALLAH CREEK. (SEE
MAP F.) Here, says Dickie, there is a large extent of country with fine-looking
REEFS.</p>
<p>He then traced a belt of "REEFY COUNTRY" 10 miles NW. (probably crossing
CROSBIE CREEK about long. 143&deg; E.) <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and
afterwards led NNE. to "one of the heads of the COLEMAN RIVER." "Along this
route," he says, "there are plenty of REEFS in places, and colours were
obtained both from the reefs and the alluvial." He ran the COLEMAN down for 20
miles (which would bring him to between Camps 62 and 63 of Mulligan's fifth
trip).</p>
<p>Six miles NNW. of the Coleman, Dickie struck a belt of country in which he
got ALLUVIAL GOLD as well as GOLD IN REEFS. There was, however, nothing good
enough to be reported as payable. Here he refers to a report of the preceding
year, when he had been on the same spot.</p>
<p>From this point he went, as he says, NNW. to the SOUTH COEN RIVER, which he
struck about 30 miles below the township. The BLACKS stole his beef and he had
to go to Ebagoolah for a supply. He was detained in one camp for five weeks by
WET WEATIIER.</p>
<p>Thirty miles down the (South) Coen River from the township is the infall of
TADPOLE CREEK. (SEE MAP C.) TO reach that point, Dickie must have travelled N.
by E., and not NNW. His bearings and distances are not given with sufficient
accuracy for charting purposes. One can only be certain of his initial and
terminal points. His route, as laid down on Sheets 18C, 18D, 20B, and 20C, can,
therefore, only be approximately correct.</p>
<h4>DISCOVERY OF PHILP GOLDFIELD</h4>
<p>A letter from Dickie, dated Ebagoolah, 30th June, 1903, is printed in the
Q.G.M.J. for August (p. 428). Evidently referring</p>
<blockquote>[1) Five miles north of Potallah, the OLAM CREEK REEF has since
been worked for gold. <i>Ann. Rep. Mines, 1914</i>, P. 65.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 710}</u></p>
<p>to the so-called Alice (Philp) River, he mentions having got a little gold
in all the gullies, and good prospects in reefs. (SEE MAP F.)</p>
<p>In 1904, Dickie reported PAYABLE GOLD on the so-called Alice River, and the
area was gazetted in 1906 as the Alice Goldfield. It has since come to be known
as the PHILP GOLDFIELD, in honour of Sir Robert Philp, for the reason that it
is only on a tributary of the Alice River, which is itself a tributary of the
Mitchell. The tributary should be named the PHILP RIVER to distinguish it from
the Alice.</p>
<p>In 1904, the mill at Potallah Provisional Goldfield was removed to the
Philp. The following yields from quartz crushings are recorded in the Annual
Reports of the Department of Mines:&mdash;</p>
<center>
<p><img alt="" src="0601141h-images/table-02.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>In a letter quoted in the Q.G.M. Journal of 15th March, 1905, Dickie gives
some particulars of the early crushings on the field.</p>
<p>The Philp Goldfield has yielded a very small amount of ALLUVIAL GOLD. During
the thirteen years of the field's existence, the statistics of the Mines
Department only account for 58 oz. 13 dwt. This is, no doubt, an
under-estimate, as from the geographical position of the place its alluvial
gold would be sold for the most part in Cooktown, Ebagoolah or Coen.</p>
<p>Progressive estimates of the population of the field are given in the Annual
Reports of the Department of Mines:-</p>

<p>Writing on 14th August, 1905, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> to the
Under-Secretary for Mines, Dickie gives a further account of his 1901 TRIP,
with observations added after the opening of the Philp Goldfield. He mentions
that on this goldfield the reefs are all covered with sand and are only exposed
in the beds of water-courses. He also remarks on the ENORMOUS dimensions
attained by STRINGYBARK TREES On the "desert" south of the field.</p>
<h4>DISCOVERY OF ANTIMONY</h4>
<p>About the middle of 1907, Dickie reported the discovery of extensive
deposits of ANTIMONY ORE on the middle head branch of the Alice (<i>read</i>
PHILP) RIVER, about 20 miles from IMOOYA. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<h4>THE McILWRAITH RANGE, LLOYD BAY, HAYS CREEK, ETC.</h4>
<p>Writing from Palmerville under date 30th January, 1909, <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> Dickie describes how, in August, 1907, he and Campbell
left the Mein Telegraph Station and followed the track to the Wolfram Camp
(BOWNEN) on the Pascoe River.</p>
<p>From Bowden, they went to the east side of the "main coast range" (JANET
RANGE). (SEE MAP C.) It would be interesting to know whether they went through
the range, past its northern side by the mouth of the Pascoe and the site of
Kennedy's ill-fated camp, or past its southern side by my track of 1880. They
then travelled so miles (say 35) south to HAYS CREEK. The question arises
whether Dickie, like Dodd, took what is now called Dodd Creek for Hays Creek.
They found GOLD "in all the large creeks &mdash;presumably tributaries of the
Lockhart draining either the McIlwraith or the Macrossan Range. They also saw
numerous reefs, but got no gold in them. At a place 40 (?) miles north of Hays
Creek, by Dickie's reckoning, Campbell (who appears to have been there before)
told Dickie that men had worked gold off and on for some years. At HAYS (DODD?)
CREEK, they found three parties WORKING ALLUVIAL GOLD.</p>
<p>From Hays Creek, they visited some REEFS 7 miles ENE., close to the coast
(near Hays Hill?). One of the reefs had been worked in an open cut. They dollied
stone from reefs and got good prospects of gold.</p>
<p>They then "crossed the range on to the western, or Gulf, watershed, and
travelled north. All the big creeks on the western slope of the range were
found to carry a little gold, and in two places they came across a few men
WORKING ALLUVIAL GOLD." Probably they came down GEIKIE OR ATTACK CREEK to the
low country and then followed the Telegraph line NW. to Mein.</p>
<p>It was evidently from the impressions gained on this tour that</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 712}</u></p>
<p>the traverse by Dickie, Dick and Sheffield, described in another chapter,
was initiated.</p>
<h4>FURTHER EXPLORATIONS</h4>
<p>From a brief reference in the report of Warden J. F. Cherry, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> it appears that Dickie was out prospecting in the
Peninsula in 1909, but no account of this trip has come under my notice.</p>
<p>In 1910, DICKIE, WITH DICK AND SHEFFIELD, made the extensive tour in the
MCILWRAITH RANGE AND LOCKIIART VALLEY which is the subject of another
chapter.</p>
<p>From a letter written by James Dick on 26th May, 1913, I gathered that
Dickie at that date was "OUT BEYOND PLUTOVILLE."</p>
<p>In February, 1914, he was working on the Annan Tinfield.</p>
<p>On 17th April, 1918, with JAMES HARE, of Croydon, he set out from Richmond,
on the Flinders River, with the intention of revisiting a mineral area which he
had discovered some years previously, "300 miles North of Cooktown." <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> After having passed the Woolgar Goldfield, they got
separated and lost, when out in different directions in search of water. (SEE
MAPS P AND R.) Dickie reached a Chinaman's hut on the Gilbert River after two
days' wandering without food. Hare found his way to Gledswood Station at the
head of the Norman.</p>
<p>Dickie died in March, 1920.</p>

<h4>JAMES DICK'S REPORT</h4>
<p>THE MCILWRAITH RANGE, named, traversed and sketched by me in 1879-80, is
still only known to geography through (1) my sketch-map (which appears to have
been seriously misinterpreted by the Survey Office) and (2) the
wheel-and-compass surveys of MR. J. T. EMBLEY, Licensed Surveyor. (SEE MAP C.)
The latter in 1884-5 defined the position and course of Sefton Creek and the
head of the Batavia River and of Geikie Creek, one of the heads of the Archer
River. Between the Batavia River and Geikie Creek, approximately on the
meridian of 143&deg; 16' E. long., a north-and-south line was run from 13&deg;
8' to 13&deg; 22' S. ht., to connect the river with the creek, and a few miles
to the west of this line, some further lines were drawn in connection with the
survey of "Bald Hill" and "Bald Hill, No. 1" pastoral holdings.</p>
<p>My original sketch-map was not published with the official</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 714}</u></p>
<p>report of which it was an essential part, and has apparently been lost
between the various departments through which it passed. I have, however, been
able to reconstruct it, from my field notebooks, and this new compilation, as
given herewith, in the region covered by the McIlwraith Range, differs
materially from the current issue of the official map, Sheet 20C, although it
in no instance conflicts with Mr. Embley's surveyed lines.</p>
<p>In 1910, JOHN DICKIE, JAMES DICK AND ARTHUR H. SHEFFIELD made a tour through
the McIlwraith to the Macrossan Range, with some Government assistance. Dickie,
the leader, so far as I am aware, made no report except the few lines
paraphrased at the end of this chapter. The history of the expedition was
written by Dick in a report dated Cooktown, 12th November, 1910. An abstract of
this report was published in the <i>Queensland Government Mining Journal</i> of
15th December, and was accompanied by a sketch-map on the scale of 8 miles to
an inch, drawn at the Geological Survey Office, Brisbane. Mr. Dick also read a
paper on the subject before the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia,
Queensland Branch, on 1st May, 1911.</p>
<p>Numerous difficulties, arising out of my attempt to follow the expedition on
the map, led to a correspondence with Mr. Dick, and it was seen that the
printed abstract must have omitted some portions of the narrative which were of
importance from a geographical point of view, and that the writer's meaning, in
some cases, had not been fully grasped by the editor. Mr. Dick, to whose
letters of 19th February, 1911, and 5th and 12th May, 1912, I am particularly
indebted, was kind enough to send me the 4-mile map which had accompanied his
report, and which had been returned to him. Through the courtesy of Mr. Henry
Marshall, Under-Secretary for Mines, I have been able to peruse the manuscript
of Mr. Dick's report.</p>
<p>Finally, all the above sources of information having been exhausted, I
borrowed the DIARY which Mr. Dick kept while in the field. From the material
which had thus accumulated in my hands, I have been able to add much useful
information to the map.</p>
<p>The party LEFT COOKTOWN on 8th June , 1910. From the railway terminus at the
Laura they followed either the Telegraph line or roads. Passing Yarraden and
Ebagoolah (Hamilton Goldfield) (MAP F) and the township of Coen (MAP C), they
reached MEIN TELEGRAPH STATION On 27th June.</p>
<p>Leaving MEIN on 1st July, the course taken was E. by N., first crossing a
portion of the GEIKIE SANDSTONE TABLELAND. Near the head of CLAYHOLE CREEK, a
tributary of the Batavia River, the party saw, about 6 miles from Mein, the
remains of a NATIVE POLICE CAMP, which must have dated from about 1887, as it
was erected for the protection of the Telegraph Construction party. FROG HOLLOW
and Fox's CREEK, tributaries of the Batavia River, were</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 715}</u></p>
<p>next crossed, and the BATAVIA RIVER itself was reached (CAMP 15) about 20
miles from Mein. Fox's OLD STATION was on Frog Hollow.</p>
<p>The Batavia was apparently struck only a short distance above the rich
alluvial goldfield of PLUTOVILLE (which was to be discovered in October of the
same year). Above the crossing of the river, a bark hut was seen, the temporary
dwelling of WILLIAM PARTRIDGE, a prospector who, it is mentioned, had, "with
others," a few months previously, got 30 ounces of GOLD in the Batavia.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>In about 2 miles up the river to the east, the infall of Sefton Creek was
seen on the right, or northern, bank. The Sefton was followed up to the NE. for
about 8 miles, where the party must have crossed my track (between Camps 30 and
31) of 26th January, 1880.</p>
<p>The travellers then followed SEFTON CREEK to the east for about 15 miles
until the creek was obviously near its head. The creek was prospected all the
way, but only "fine colours" of GOLD were obtained. Near its head they "came in
sight of JACK'S Nos and MOUNT CARTER," peaks which had been named and located
by Mr. Embley. Dick's description of the view from Mount Carter (which he
ascended on his return journey) proves at least that Mount Carter and my "View
Hill" of 20th January, 1880, are distinct.</p>
<p>GOLD ("colours") was first met with on 5th July, between Camps 17 and 18, in
a creek falling into the Sefton. "Fine colours" were obtained in the SEFTON
itself next day.</p>
<p>Near the head of the Sefton, Dick observed an old tree branded W.L., which
was taken to mark a visit by WILLIAM LAKELAND, prior to his discovery of the
Rocky Goldfield in 1893. (Lakeland assisted Embley in his surveys of
1884-5.)</p>
<p>Owing to the steepness of the rocky slopes and the density of the SCRUB,
Dickie and his party experienced insurmountable difficulty in trying to cross
the backbone of the MCILWRAITH RANGE by the head of the Sefton, which had
turned to the north-west. They were turned back again and again, had to hew
their way through the scrub, and nearly lost their horses, but finally got away
to the south-east and CROSSED THE RANGE 011 14th July. On the same day they
lighted on a fresh horse-track, which they believed to have been made by
PARTRIDGE. They then dropped down into the valley of the LOCKHART RIVER by a
TRACK which had been cut by sandalwood-getters, and which led them, through a
long scrub, over steep and rugged ground, and lastly "over flat pastoral
country and numerous water-courses" north-eastward to a landing, on TIDAL
WATERS, on the left bank of the river, where there was an</p>

light of a statement made by M. W. Shanahan in "With the Cape York Prospecting
Party, being an Account of a Trip from Cape York to the Carron Range, with
various Peninsular Sidelights," in <i>Queenslander</i> of 19th September, 1896.
The statement is that Partridge is "now a semi-millionaire" and making a figure

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 716}</u></p>
<p>old camp and some cases branded "H. Giblet." Here the party camped on the
18th July (CAMP 29). But for the happy accident of striking this track, says
Dick, it might have taken some weeks to get down, and some of the horses might
have been lost. Up to the moment when the salt water was sighted, the leader,
according to Dick, was under the impression that he was still on the headwaters
of the Batavia River.</p>
<p>In descending the range, the party believed that they had identified, and to
some extent followed, the water-course which I had named GREYHOUND CREEK On
18th January, 1880. The creek seen by them was probably at least of equal
importance, but must have been about 16 MILES NORTH OF GREYHOUND CREEK.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that I first saw and named the LOCKHART RIVER On 14th
January, 1880. As early as 1872, however, CAPTAIN (afterwards Admiral) MORESBY
had attempted, with the gig of H.M.S. "<i>Basilisk</i>," to penetrate beyond
the channels among the mangrove swamps at the south end of Lloyd Bay, and had
come, reluctantly, to the conclusion that "there was no river," adding "the
drainage of a hill 6 or 7 miles inland had created a swamp of many miles in
extent, covered by mangroves and intersected by these salt-water creeks, and
that was all." <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>MR. J. T. EMBLEY informs me, in a letter dated 13th June, 1915, that in 1913
he went up the river from its mouth about 8 miles, which was as far as a boat
could go. He describes the river as being, at its mouth and for some distance
up, "a network of channels, with islands, making it very difficult for a
stranger to navigate the correct channel." A "Town RESERVE," of 2,660 acres,
covering the mouth of the river, was gazetted in 1889. Apparently it has not
been surveyed, and Embley's description suggests that it must consist mainly of
salt-water channels and mangrove swamps.</p>
<p>The whole of the MACROSSAN RANGE, SO named by me on 8th January, 1880, and
extending from 12&deg; 55' to 13&deg; 38' S., has since been sketched by marine
surveyors, who have taken the liberty of renaming all but an insignificant
portion of it. According to the legend on the Admiralty Chart, "Claremont Pt.
to C. Direction," this was done by the Officers of H.M.S. Surveying Ship
"<i>Dart</i>" in 1896-7. From north to south, the names, which are copied in
the Lands Department's 4-mile Map of 1908, are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>12&deg; 55' to 13&deg; S.&mdash;Heming Range, Heming Peak, North Peak,
Cleveland Hill.</p>
<p>13&deg; to 13&deg; 5'.&mdash;High Range, High Peak.</p>
<p>13&deg; 5' to 13&deg; 10'.&mdash;Chester Range, Chester Peak.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 717}</u></p>
<p>13&deg; 10' to 13&deg; 12' 30".&mdash;Valley Hills, Meston Range.</p>

given to the whole range, is restricted to this portion, and Cone and Plant
Peaks appear at its northern and southern extremities.</p>
<p>13&deg; 29' to 13&deg; 38'.&mdash;Embley Range, Round Mt., Hobbs Hill,
etc.</p>
<p>The depiction of the whole Macrossan Range, as it appears on the chart, is
an admirable piece of sketching, and the various peaks, ranges and mounts have,
no doubt, been located by triangulation. If these points are correctly located
(which I do not question), they are to be welcomed as useful additions to the
map. There is, however, no justification for paring down the Macrossan Range,
which had appeared as such on official land and geological maps up to the date
of the Admiralty survey. For this reason, the original name of" Macrossan" is
restored to the whole of the range on the map accompanying this volume, and the
other so-called "RANGES" are REDUCED to the <i>status</i> of "HEIGHTS."</p>
<p>The range must obviously have been sketched by the marine surveyors from the
east, and therefore even its most conspicuous eminences would be hard to
identify by observers approaching, like Dickie, Dick and Sheffield, from the
west.</p>
<p>On 19th:July, Dickie's party travelled south for a distance which Dick
estimated at 10 miles&mdash;probably an over-estimate, crossing nine creeks
running eastward to the Lockhart (CAMP 30). Next day they covered an (over-?)
estimated distance of 8 miles, presumably south, and camped (CAMP 31) with NED
JAMES, who, with three black boys and twenty-five horses, were packing
sandalwood for H. Giblet.</p>
<p>On 21st July, 8 (estimated) miles to the south were accomplished through
scrubby country, with the untimbered PLAINS seen by me in 1880 on the east
(CAMP 32). This camp was on what Dick called "DR. JACK CREEK."</p>
<p>On 22nd July, the MCILWRAITH RANGE was skirted for an estimated distance of
6 miles, through scrub and long grass, very trying, says Dick, to the horses
and to the temper of the men.</p>
<p>CAMP 33 was probably On SURPRISE CREEK.</p>
<p>Small progress was made on 23rd July, owing to difficulties with scrub and
long grass. CAMP 34 was near the McIlwraith Range.</p>
<p>On 25th July, the previous day (Sunday) having been employed in burning
grass, etc., a progress of, say, 4 miles was made eastward to the bank of the
LOCKHART RIVER (CAMP 35), CHERRY CREEK having been crossed near Camp 34. Dick's
sketch-map shows "Dr. Jack," "Surprise" and "Cherry Creeks" running
north-easterly from the McIlwraith Range into the Lockhart River.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 718}</u></p>
<p>They can probably be identified from his description, but, considering the
indefiniteness of his mileage, they had better wait for a survey before being
put on the map.</p>
<p>On 26th July, the party crossed from the left to the right bank of the
LOCKHART, and the Leader struck out to the east, saying that he was making for
the McIlwraith Range. This is wellnigh incredible, and can only be explained on
the supposition that he had <i>previously</i> mistaken the Macrossan Range for
the McIlwraith. Not long after they had started to go east, the party came in
sight of the SEA, which must have been visible through the gap made by DODD
CREEK in the Macrossan Range between Meston and Adam Heights. Admitting his
mistake, Dickie turned back and headed to the west. Presently the party found
themselves on a well-beaten TRACK, which they supposed to go from Hays Creek to
Tin (Hull) Creek. The track was followed till it recrossed to the left bank of
the Lockhart, where CAMP 36 was made.</p>
<p>The creek (DODD CREEK) which, in this locality, breaches the MACROSSAN
RANGE, was erroneously taken for Hays Creek, which is further south. Dick says
that Dodd believed this creek to be Hays Creek.</p>
<p>On the 27th, the camp was moved 2 miles east of the Lockhart, to some "bald"
hills seen on the previous day (CAMP 37). The following passage occurs in
Dick's diary of this date:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"In the valley of Hills is a perfect maze of
ravines, gullies, creeks and scrubs, One could easily get bushed...We were
camped near the track from the Sandalwood Landing to Tin Creek."</blockquote>
<p>This, the first mention of the "VALLEY OF HILLS," leads me to think that
Dick believed he had identified DODD CREEK (which he took for Hays Creek) with
the "VALLEY HILLS" vaguely indicated on the Admiralty Chart and the Lands
Department's 4-mile Map. On subsequent dates, this Camp 37 is referred to as
the "Valley of Hills," and sometimes as the "Valley of Green Hills" camp.</p>
<p>The Admiralty Chart bears, in 10&deg; 2' S. lat., the words "Valley Hills,"
which refer either to two hills, of 900 and 879 feet, on the crest of the
Macrossan Range, or to hills in a distant valley seen from the ocean through an
opening between the two peaks referred to&mdash;in other words, to some portion
of the McIlwraith Range. Dick's "Valley of Hills" is evidently not the "Valley
Hills" of the chart.</p>
<p>From Camp 37 as a base, Dickie and Dick prospected the head of the LOCKHART
till 2nd August, tracing GOLD, in the form of "fine colours," for the greater
part of the way. The best place gave three grains of scaly gold to three dishes
of dirt. In one gully they found a SLUICE-Box, a certain proof that others had
been ahead of them and actually WORKING GOLD, and in two other places</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 719}</u></p>
<p>they found OLD WORKINGS. In the last of these places their tests led them to
conclude that the ground was poor, but a "good fossicker might make 3 dwt. a
day for a few months."</p>
<p>Starting from Camp 37 on 3rd August, Dick and Sheffield followed a PATH
which led them down the valley of DODD CREEK to the coast, where they found a
long sandy beach and a LARGE CAMP, with yards and huts, evidently a dep&ocirc;t
for sandalwood. A TRACK led northward from the dep&ocirc;t. They returned to
Camp 37 after dark.</p>
<p>On 4th August, Dick and Sheffield rode out to see if the track from the
sandalwood depot on the coast led to Hays Creek. The "good blazed track,"
however, led them to the NW. until they were satisfied that they were on
western waters, among the heads of Falloch, Geikie or Hull Creek, as they
imagined, but more probably on the head-waters of the Batavia. In many places,
OLD YARDS and CAMPS were observed, showing that this part of the range was
already well known to the sandalwood men. After a long day's ride, the
travellers returned to Camp 37 in the dark.</p>
<p>On 5th August, Dick and Sheffield left the "Green Hills camp (37) in search
of Hays Creek. In a valley between the Lockhart River and the Macrossan Range
they struck a creek which was new to them, as, after coming from the south,
parallel with the Lockhart (which continues to run north till it falls into
Lloyd Bay), it turns east and BREACHES THE MACROSSAN RANGE. They concluded that
the creek was Hays Creek. Shortly afterwards they struck a TRACK running
southward up the valley&mdash;evidently the pack-track leading from Dodd and
Preston's camp to the landing visited on 3rd August. In about 6 miles to the
south, the track brought them to DODD AND PRESTON'S CAMP at their GOLDEN GATE
REEF. The diary states that "Dodd and Preston's mine is situated on the divide
of Hays and Nisbet waters." As, however, Dick took Dodd for Hays Creek, the
sentence should read "on the divide of Dodd and Hays Creeks." The night was
spent at the mining camp, and the reef was visited. There were at the time only
three men at work on the mine, but two visitors were also met; one was
Anderson, the storekeeper from Ebagoolah, and in the other Dick recognised a
shipwrecked mariner, named Coleman, whom he had seen three years before at
Thursday Island.</p>
<p>On 6th August, Dick and Sheffield returned to Camp 37, by the spur dividing
Dodd Creek and the head of the Lockhart, guided by a black boy in the employ of
Anderson and Coleman. The spur showed the outcrops of numerous QUARTZ
REEFS.</p>
<p>Some interesting particulars of the opening of the GOLDEN GATE REEF are
given by Dick in his Geographical Society paper and his diary. It appears that
Dodd and Preston came on foot from the Rocky Goldfield, carrying their tools
and provisions on</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 720}</u></p>
<p>their backs, often hacking their way through the scrub. They had to contend
with two wet seasons before getting any return for their labour. They
transported half a ton of machinery 6 miles from the coast&mdash;and then it
proved useless. They had to hire horses from 100 miles away to pack their first
stone to the coast, charter a boat to carry it to Cooktown, ship the stone from
Cooktown to Townsville and transport it by rail to Charters Towers.</p>
<p>According to the Annual Report of the Department of Mines for 1910, the
GOLDEN GATE REEF was formally "taken up" On 4th October, 1909. Its second
consignment of stone (which Dickie's party met in transit), consisting of
36&frac12; tons, yielded 274.8 ounces of gold, valued at &pound;846, when
treated at Charters Towers. The first trial crushing (2.2 tons) had given 23
ounces, valued at &pound;79 7s.</p>
<p>The NISBET REEFS, discovered in 1896 <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
(presumably by prospectors following the track marked by Baird and Marrett),
are apparently near the head of the Nisbet River, south-east of my Camp 25.
Their port was at the mouth of the Chester River, from which passengers and
goods went by boat to meet the mail steamers at Claremont Island Lightship. By
this time there was a ROAD from the Coen to the mouth of the Chester, and
ABORIGINAL CARRIERS were transporting goods between the Chester and the Rocky
River. WARDEN F. J. CHERRY reported that in 1896 a trial crushing of 85 tons
had yielded 283 ounces of GOLD.</p>
<p>On 8th August, Dickie and Dick set out on an excursion from Camp 37, down
the LOCKHART VALLEY, following the west side of the Macrossan Range, and
burning the grass as they went along. Passing Meston and Chester Heights, they
camped first under the north of the "High Peak Range" of the Admiralty Chart.
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<p>A sandalwood TRACK was seen going north from Giblet's landing on the
Lockhart River (i.e., Camp 29).</p>
<p>On 9th August, the two travellers continued to ride north till they were in
sight of the northern end of Heming Heights, when they turned back. The long
and matted grass was set on fire to facilitate the return journey. The fire at
one time proved a serious menace, and the travellers were obliged to cross the
river hastily to avoid it; whereupon they camped for the night.</p>
<p>On 10th August, recrossing to the right bank of the Lockhart, some miles of
the return journey proved easy travelling over the burnt ground, but further to
the south there was heavy grass, still unburnt, in places. The travellers
passed over "beautiful, naturally drained, alluvial flats, 5 or 6 miles wide
and 10 to 15</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Ann. Rep., Dept. of Mines</i>, for 1896, p.
46.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) In a letter dated 13th July, 1915, Mr. J. T. Embley agrees with
me that it would be difficult to identify from the western side the "peaks" of
the chart, which were surveyed from the east, but says that "High Peak" is a
good landmark: "It towers above all the other points. Possibly from the eastern
side it is merely a high peak on the range, but has its immediate base fronting
on the first country."]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 721}</u></p>
<p>miles long, with a bit of 'devil-devil.'...It ought to be great sugar land."
They reached Camp 37 at night.</p>
<p>The object of this excursion was to see some country which Dick had been
informed at Dodd's camp was considered by Bowden to be" likely "for gold. It
would appear, therefore, that WILLIAM BOWDEN, the well-known prospector, had
already visited this district.</p>
<p>On 12th August, the whole party left Camp 37, which had been their
headquarters since 27th July. They appear to have travelled north-north-west,
as they arrived in an hour at the first of the YARDS which Dick and Sheffield
had visited on 4th August. They travelled altogether an estimated distance of
10 miles, having CROSSED THE DIVIDE to western waters, and camped at noon on a
large creek which they conjectured might be HULL CREEK, but which may have been
one of the heads of the BATAVIA RIVER (CAMP 39).</p>
<p>In 10 miles of travelling W., N., S. and E., on 15th August, the party kept
nearly on the WATERSHED of the Peninsula, finally camping on the eastern, or
Lockhart, fall (CAMP 40). The grass was long, and too wet to burn, and there
was not a gully which could be prospected. Dick remarks on the absence of a
"range on the watershed, and his ideas as to his position were vague. Early in
the day he believed himself to be on the west side of Ben Lomond. He was, in
fact, trying to reconcile his experiences with the imperfect map (the 4-mile
Lands Map) in his hands (on which Attack, Geikie, Falloch and Hull Creeks are
misplaced and Ben Lomond is not shown).</p>
<p>On 16th August, after a short run to the north-east, a thick SCRUB was met
with, into which gullies ran eastward, to join the Lockhart. The edge of the
scrub was followed to the south, and the party found themselves, after an
estimated course of 8 miles, back on their track of 12th August (CAMP 41).
"Fine colours" of GOLD were obtained from gullies near the camp on the 16th and
17th.</p>
<p>On 18th August, Dick and Sheffield went out prospecting towards the
MCILWRAITH RANGE, i.e., towards the divide, crossing deep gullies, thick scrub
and long grass. In several gullies they got "colours" of GOLD. Camped at
nightfall in a grassy pocket (CAMP 42). This camp is marked in the diary
"SURPRISE CREEK CAMP."</p>
<p>In the morning of 19th August, Dick and Sheffield prospected a gully below
the camp and got GOLD in several dishes, some of it in "coarse colours."</p>
<p>While the men were at work prospecting, the dogs sounded an alarm, and two
BLACK BOYS were discovered up a tree. The blacks were unarmed and explained in
English that they had only retired from fear of the dogs. On descending, they
agreed to join the party.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 722}</u></p>
<p>The creek on which Camp 42 was pitched appears to be considerably (say 8
miles) north of the position assigned to "Surprise Creek" by the "Sketch-map
prepared at the Geological Survey Office."</p>
<p>On 20th August, Dick, Sheffield and the two boys returned.to Camp 41, where
Dickie had been left. The latter had been busy prospecting for auriferous
reefs. The following day the party returned to CAMP 37 ("Valley of Hills
Camp").</p>
<p>Accompanied by the two boys, Dick and Sheffield left Camp 37 on 22nd August,
camping the same night on ALBERT CREEK (CAMP 43), and on 23rd On ARTHUR CREEK
(CAMP 44). I am unable to locate these creeks. Albert Creek, which was in a
scrub, gave GOLD which just fell short of being payable. Dick reckoned that "a
good hand might make 2 dwt. a day sluicing." Arthur Creek was reached by
crossing Surprise Creek, and gave about 3 grains of GOLD to 5 dishes: "a man
might make 2 dwt. a day."</p>
<p>On 24th August, led by the boys, Dick and Sheffield made for "the range,"
and ascended a very steep spur and camped, apparently still in the drainage
area of Albert Creek.</p>
<p>ATTAVA CREEK (which I am unable to locate) was prospected on 25th August,
and only gave "colours" of GOLD. The country was scrubby, but a sandalwood
TRACK was found.</p>
<p>On 26th August, via Camps 43 and 44, the party returned to the "VALLEY OF
HILLS CAMP" (NO. 37).</p>
<p>The FLOUR at this main camp was now EXHAUSTED, and the beef was nearly
finished. The black boys, however, supplied the table, to some extent, with
scrub hens and their eggs and a cassowary chicken. Dickie rode to Dodd and
Preston's camp, returning on 28th August with flour. Sheffield and a black boy
started on the 29th for the Mein and returned on 8th September with a load of
rations which had been left at the Telegraph station. DICKIE was out
prospecting for reefs and brought to the camp several specimens Of QUARTZ
SHOWING GOLD.</p>
<p>After Sheffield's return, Dickie and Dick rode out to "some gullies north of
Hays Creek" (i.e., NORTH OF DODD CREEK), "under Adam Range" (Heights). "Got
colours in over half a dozen gullies and in the reefs, but nothing payable."
They also got a "half-grain prospect" in Hays (i.e., DODD) CREEK.</p>
<p>On 13th September, Dick and Sheffield set out, accompanied by the two black
boys. Crossing ridges and deep gullies and cutting through scrubs, they came on
SURPRISE CREEK about 2 miles higher than where they had surprised the boys on
19th August (which was near Camp 42). Here, again, they got "colours" of GOLD,
and they saw a TRACK which the boys informed them had been cut some years ago
by POLICE-SERGEANT WHELAN, who failed to get through, and had to return. The
scrub here was much troubled with the thorny "lawyer vine" and had many
bamboos.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 723}</u></p>
<p>Up to 17th September, various heads of SURPRISE CREEK were prospected.
Several places-were found where the prospects of GOLD were almost payable, or
might have been payable under more favourable conditions. Cutting scrub,
burning grass and the care of the horses&mdash;which had to be tied up in the
day and taken back to grass in the moonlight&mdash;took up a good deal of the
time. The reconnoitring party returned to the "VALLEY OF HILLS CAMP" (NO. 37)
On the 17th.</p>
<p>Dickie went to Dodd's Camp on the 18th and returned on the 19th with 50 lb.
of flour. On the 20th, the party moved out to SURPRISE CREEK (CAMP 50). Before
they left their camp in the morning, a man arrived from the Coen and also two
men from Granite (Hull) Creek on their way to Dodd's Camp. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>On 21st September, the party passed APPEL'S PINNACLES, and crossing PINNACLE
CREEK, camped in a grassy pocket (CAMP 51). The afternoon was spent in cutting
scrub, burning grass and prospecting. A QUARTZ outcrop in a scrub showed galena
and pyrites and also gave "colours" of GOLD. The "nest" of a SCRUB
TURKEY&mdash;a mound of earth and vegetable mould in which a colony of birds
leave their eggs to be hatched by the fermentation of the vegetable
matter&mdash;measured 120 feet in circumference and rose to a height of 12 to
15 feet.</p>
<p>APPEL'S PINNACLES, which Dick regarded as the eastern portal of the
McIlwraith Range, are five in number, rising to a height of over 1,000 feet
above their surroundings. They were named in honour of the Minister for Mines.
In PINNACLE CREEK, which comes from the west and falls into Surprise Creek,
"fine colours" of GOLD were obtained on 22nd September. The party tried to
reach a range to the north, which had been seen from the Pinnacles, but were
turned back by the density of the SCRUB.</p>
<p>From Camp 51, an unsuccessful attempt was made to penetrate the SCRUB to NE.
on 23rd September. Two tributaries of Pinnacle Creek were named HUMBUG and
PUZZLE CREEKS.</p>
<p>In showery weather, the party left Camp 51 on 24th September and struck
north. After traversing good country, with grass two months old, a creek "as
large as the Lockhart" was met with at the same place where it had been crossed
on the outward journey (about 19th July). It came out of the scrub and took a
NNE. Course. Dick called it "DR. JACK CREEK." The camp at the crossing would be
numbered 52.</p>
<p>A very careful study of the diary leads me to place the group of creeks
shown on Dick's map, including CHERRY, SURPRISE and JACK CREEKS&mdash;in all of
which GOLD was met With&mdash;NORTH OF GREYHOUND CREEK, and south of the creek
improperly called by that</p>
<blockquote>[1) The documents at my disposal do not enable me to locate Camps
38 to 49, inclusive.]</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 724}</u></p>
<p>name in the sketch-map drawn at the Geological Survey Office and the 1915
issue of the 4-mile map.</p>
<p>From Camp 52 to Camp 53, northward, "hugging the range all the way, but
rather too close," there was difficult country, but a distance estimated by
Dick at 11 miles was covered. CAMP 53 (26th September) was near the junction of
two boggy and scrubby creeks, tributaries of the Lockhart River.</p>
<p>In this day's diary, Dick records an instance of the ABORIGINAL method of
disposal of the DEAD. The body reposed on the limbs of a tree and beside it
were some spears and wimmeras.</p>
<p>On 27th September, continuing the journey to the north near the range, but
keeping to the low country, CAMP 54 was pitched on the site of Camp 31 of the
outward trip. Good grass for the horses had already replaced the mat of old
grass which had been burned. Some large "buck" reefs of quartz were
observed.</p>
<p>The northward course was pursued for four hours on 28th September, between
the left bank of the LOCKHART RIVER and the MCILWRAITH RANGE. Some of the 4 6
BLADY GRASS which had escaped the fires was 18 FEET HIGH.</p>
<p>On 29th September, the party finally left the Lockhart Valley and the foot
of the MCILWRAITH RANGE was reached in about 21 miles. The ascent to the summit
must have been easy, as it was accomplished in an hour and a half. MOUNT CARTER
was sighted, and CAMP 56 was pitched near the summit of the range.</p>
<p>Near the camp, NED JAMES was again met with, engaged in packing sandalwood
with twenty-five horses. In the course of conversation, he informed the
prospectors that WILLIAM LAKELAND had been out in this neighbourhood and had
got coarse GOLD.</p>
<p>Dickie and Dick prospected a creek (a head of the BATAVIA&mdash; or SEFTON
CREEK?) the following day, but got no gold. They then Climbed MOUNT CARTER,
which was of granite, and which Dick estimated at 2,000 feet high. From the
summit, a creek was seen running NE. into Lloyd Bay, the SEFTON VALLEY lay to
the south and in the north the PASCOE VALLEY was seen falling to the west.
Between the camp and the mountain was a blazed TRACK leading in the direction
of Lloyd Bay.</p>
<p>On 1st October, the party left Camp 56, and, keeping Mount Carter on the
right, coursed SE. and SW., and camped (CAMP 57) on the BATAVIA RIVER. A quartz
outcrop, which had been prospected before, was seen on the way. The party
remained in Camp 57 till 4th October.</p>
<p>On the 2nd, the ubiquitous NED JAMES again turned up, with a party of
blacks. The boys provided the explorers with an emu, a turkey and a hen, which
they had shot.</p>
<p>On 4th October, the party moved on to WSW. and after passing three
SANDALWOOD CAMPS, reached BAIRD'S PINNACLES, where they camped (CAMP 58). The
pinnacles are weathered towers of</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 725}</u></p>
<p>sandstone on the north-eastern corner of the GEIKIE RANGE. Below them, to
the north, lay the BAIRDSVILLE mining centre and the lonely GRAVE Of its
discoverer, WILLIAM BAIRD (1892), who was killed by the blacks in 1896.
CHOCK-A-BLOCK, another gold-mining centre, was visible to the north between the
Batavia and Pascoe Rivers. I am indebted to Dick's sketch-map for the
approximate positions of BAIRDSVILLE, PLUTOVILLE and CHOCK-A-BLOCK. The two
latter have not yet appeared on any map, so far as I am aware, while the latter
is incorrectly placed on the sketch-map drawn to illustrate Dick's report when
it appeared in the Government Mining Journal.</p>
<p>A few months before the Dickie party's visit, WILLIAM PARTRIDGE and others
had Won 30 ounces of GOLD from the Batavia River, and gullies which yielded
PAYABLE GOLD had been worked by GLEESON, WARD, WEISS and EDWARD DOWNS. Downs
had got 60 ounces at Chock-a-Block.</p>
<p>A week was spent by the Dickie party prospecting around BAIRDSVILLE, but
nothing very promising was met with. One of Giblet's boys turned up at the camp
on 7th October, on his way to the Ducie River, with horses. This boy had
information to give respecting the Lockhart, which might have been of some
service had it been given in time.</p>
<p>By this time, the MCILWRAITH RANGE appears to have been thoroughly known to
sandalwood getters, who had marked many tracks across it, between Giblet's
landing on the Lockhart and the Mein Telegraph Station. Many miners and
prospectors also had tracks leading out to the east of Mein in various
directions, including one to Dodd's Golden Gate camp.</p>
<p>It is stated in the <i>Annual Report of the Department of Mines for 1892</i>
that after WILLIAM BAIRD had reported the discovery of payable gold on Retreat
Creek, Batavia River (BAIRDSVILLE), in October of that year, he went,
accompanied by SUB-INSPECTOR MARRETT, to the mouth of HAYS CREEK, MARKING A
TRACK. I assume that Baird and Marrett correctly identified Hays Creek and did
not confuse it with Dodd Creek, as Dodd and Preston and subsequent observers
did.</p>
<p>The Dickie party left BAIRDSVILLE On 12th, reached MEIN On 13th and left for
Cooktown on 15th October. Following the Telegraph line to the south-east, they
camped 25 miles from Mein, where they unsuccessfully prospected some "likely"
country. Dick and Sheffield crossed the GEIKIE TABLELAND (my track of 20th
December, 1879, to Camp 13) on 17th October and visited MAYER AND CLAUSSEN'S
REEF On HORSE CREEK, about 6 miles WNW. of the camp on the Telegraph line where
Dickie remained. Mayer and Claussen were busy erecting a 6-head BATTERY. On the
return of Dick and Sheffield to the camp in the afternoon, they found a note
from Dickie, who had tired of waiting, and had gone on.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 726}</u></p>
<p>DICKIE sent his report from the COCTI. DICK AND SHEFFIELD boarded the train
at the Laura terminus and arrived at COOKTOWN on 1st November, 1910.</p>
<p>A few notes may be culled from the diary to show the condition of the mining
centres south of the Coen.</p>
<p>EBAGOOLAH (Hamilton Goldfield).&mdash;The ADA BATTERY was situated between
Slaughteryard Creek and Ebagoolah. The owner, J. Thompson, was largely
interested in the Caledonia and Hamilton King mines.</p>
<p>VIOLETVILLE (Hamilton Goldfield).&mdash;The camp, or township, is situated
on the principal head of the LUKIN (SO called by Mulligan, although previously
named the HOLROYD by Jardine). The" BIG REEF," on Gold Mount, is described by
Dick as from 5 to 25 feet wide and fully 500 feet in length, supposed to be
worth half an ounce of gold per ton, the gold being valued at &pound;3 per
ounce. The "LUKIN" BATTERY was On water 3 miles from the mine and was owned by
D. Wilson, who had also a mine named the HAIKAI.</p>
<p>An area of 965 square miles was set aside in 1908 as an ABORIGINAL RESERVE.
Commencing at Cape Sidmouth, the boundary-line goes west for 33 miles, north to
Mount Tozer in the Janet Range, and cast to Cape Griffith, thus enclosing the
greater part of the Macrossan Range, a large part of the McIlwraith Range, and
half of the Janet Range, besides the whole of the Lockhart valley and the head
of the Nisbet valley. Considerable portions of this reserve are already
occupied by miners, who, there is no doubt, will require more of it as the
industrial occupation of the country progresses.</p>
<h4>JOHN DICKIE'S REPORT</h4>
<blockquote class="inline">Mr. John Dickie, in a short report supplied to the
Mines Department and dated Coen, 20th October (1910), states that the country
prospected was from the head of the Hays Creek 20 miles northward. The country
he describes as very broken, with creeks and gullies everywhere, all of them
containing a little gold. The golden belt is 8 miles in width. There were reefs
in places right through, and nearly all that were tried contained gold. The
best reefs were found within 5 miles of the camp of Dodd and Preston, on Hays
Creek waters. Little sinking was done on any of the reefs tested, because a
payable reef would be of no use to anyone in this country without a battery.
The reefs were all very "buck"-looking on the surface, but when sunk on to a
short depth they were all found to be heavily mineralised. Mr. Dickie considers
there is no doubt that remunerative reefs can be found throughout this country.
The party, he says, discovered no payable alluvial, but he thinks such will be
found north of the belt, 20 miles by 8 miles, which was prospected on this
occasion. There was a belt of scrub on the dividing range, 7 miles long by 8
miles wide, which was not prospected, but all the creeks and gullies running
out of this scrub on either side of the range carry a little gold. The
formation throughout the 20-mile belt examined, Mr. Dickie describes as granite
with schist in places, and a little diorite all through. He mentions that on
the map which he had, only two heads of the Lockhart are delineated, whereas
there are about twelve large branches and some thirty small creeks all running
into this river. The distance from the northern end of the 20-mile belt of
country examined to the workings on the Rocky Goldfield is 50 miles as the
crow</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 727}</u></p>
<blockquote class="inline">flies, and a little gold is to be found in all the
creeks and gullies right through. The distance to the Pascoe River, where Mr.
Dickie stopped prospecting last year, is 55 miles, and over this country, too,
gold is to be found in places. [<i>Queensland Government Mining Journal</i>,
15th December, 1910, p. 603.]</blockquote>
<p>This chapter may appropriately close with a tribute to the memory of JAMES
DICK.</p>
<p>Dick came from Victoria to Cooktown shortly after the outbreak of the Palmer
Goldfield. In 1876 he was at work in the diggings of Sandy Creek,when his
health failed and he returned to Cooktown. Here he found employment in the
store of the late John Walsh. Later on he started the Little Wonder Store and
selected land on Carroll's Creek. When his family grew old enough to run the
selection, he himself followed his natural bent and went prospecting on every
opportunity. He claimed to have "worked on or visited every field in the Cook
district." A painstaking habit of recording every incident touching the
development of the Cape York Peninsula made him eventually a never-failing
authority on historical questions.</p>
<p>For some years he was a member of the Municipal Council of Cooktown and in
1906 he (unsuccessfully) contested a seat in Parliament. Patriotic and
public-spirited, he devoted himself without stint to the best interests of the
district in which he had cast his lot. He was a voluminous writer, but
unfortunately many of his articles were contributed to journals which had only
a fleeting existence and are inaccessible and practically lost.</p>
<p>A list&mdash;which I am aware is far from complete&mdash;of articles and
pamphlets written by him is given in the appendix. One of them practically
forms the text of this chapter.</p>
<p>Another pamphlet, "A Geological and Prospecting Expedition which filled up
many Blank Spaces," etc., was, in a sense, responsible for the present volume.
In its serial form, as it appeared in the <i>Port Douglas Record</i>, he sent
it to me, with an intimation that he intended to reissue it in a book or
pamphlet. Its perusal brought home to me very acutely what I had long been
conscious of, viz., the injury which had been done by the publication of my
report on the expedition referred to without the accompanying map, which was an
essential part of it. If Dick, a friendly critic and a competent observer, and
familiar with the district, could fall into the mistakes which he did, how
could the general reading public be expected to understand? I begged for and
secured a delay in the issue of the pamphlet until I should have time to
correct it in so far as statements of fact were concerned.</p>
<p>It so happened that when Dick's communication reached me I was already
engaged in the preparation of an annotated reissue of my original official
report (by that time long out of print), with the map which should have
accompanied it on its publication. This task having been accomplished in course
of time, I felt</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 728}</u></p>
<p>that the work was incomplete without a review of the work of previous
explorers by land. Next it seemed that the story should be continued and that
the history of the region should be followed down to the present time. It had
already become evident that the progress of land exploration was intimately
connected with maritime discoveries reaching back to the three-centuries-old
dawn of authentic history; and these also had to be brought under review. While
I was engaged on this task I was in almost constant correspondence with Dick,
who responded with ready courtesy to my demands on his time, and who, out of
his intimate knowledge of actors and details, solved many of my difficulties. I
first met him in Cooktown in 1879, when I was struck by his public spirit and
insight. The only other opportunity of personal contact with him which I
enjoyed was when I spent a week in his company on "The Conglomerate" (Palmer
Goldfield) in 1896. He died in May, 1916. The portrait herewith dates, I
believe, from 1910.</p>

<p><b>PROSPECTING IN PENINSULA SINCE 1876. TOOK PART IN DISCOVERY OF BOWDEN

1893. SMALL RUSH. ALLUVIAL GOLD EXHAUSTED. AURIFEROUS REEFS DISCOVERED. ROCKY

<p>I AM unable to discover a scrap of writing by William Lakeland himself,
although it is well known that he has been one of the earliest and most
assiduous prospectors of the Cape York Peninsula. His best-known achievement is
the DISCOVERY OF THE ROCKY GOLDFIELD.</p>
<p>Explorations in the Peninsula by Lakeland in 1876 are incidentally referred
to by James Dick in his pamphlet entitled <i>A Geological and Prospecting
Expedition which filled many Blank Spaces</i> (1913), but no localities or
results are mentioned. Lakeland was one of the party (the others being William
Bowden and John Dickie) who located WOLFRAM on the BOWDEN MINERAL FIELD between
the PASCOE RIVER and CANOE CREEK, about 1887. Shortly thereafter he left for
Croydon. He was known to have been prospecting in the Peninsula before he
discovered the Rocky Goldfield, and an old tree bearing his initials seen by
the Dickie, Dick and Sheffield party in 1910 near the head of SEFTON CREEK
justifies the conclusion that he visited the MCILWRAITH RANGE.</p>
<p>Lakeland was one of the first on the Batavia River rush (Bairdsville) in
1892.</p>
<p>In 1893 <i>or</i> 1894, he discovered ALLUVIAL GOLD at the ROCKY. With the
assistance of some 300 diggers who rushed to the spot in spite of the
forbidding nature of the country, the alluvial gold was soon exhausted.
Lakeland then searched for and discovered AURIFEROUS REEFS. The field was
proclaimed in 1897. Writing in 1896, Warden F. J. Cherry described the
situation of the reefs as being on Neville Creek, about 2,000 feet above the
sea. (SEE MAP C.) He added that the stone was crushed by a water-power mill
that there were ROADS TO THE COEN AND to the mouth of the CHESTER RIVER; that
supplies were brought by NATIVE CARRIERS from the CHESTER; and that goods and
passengers from the field went by boat from the Chester to join the mail
steamers at CLAREMONT ISLAND LIGHTSHIP. Dick, writing in 1910, states that
Lakeland</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 730}</u></p>
<p>had supported himself and his family by mining and crushing with the
water-wheel mill up to that date. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Lakeland now
resides at the Coen township.</p>
<p>The HAMILTON RIVER (12&deg; 42' S.) and the CLAUDIE RIVER (12&deg; 50' S.),
falling into Lloyd Bay, were both named by Lakeland, the latter after a member
of his family. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<p>A few additional particulars regarding the ROCKY GOLDFIELD have been culled
from the Warden's Annual Reports:&mdash;</p>
<p>1897.&mdash;Alluvial gold nearly exhausted. Nine Chinese were working 7
miles south of Lakeland's camp; 30 European miners working on 5 claims, Brown
and Slattery had a trial crushing which yielded over 13 oz. per ton.</p>
<p>1898.&mdash;To end of this year the total crushings had been 403 tons for
2,117 oz., at over &pound;3 per oz., say &pound;6,351.</p>
<p>1899.&mdash;Crushings for the year, 54&frac12; tons for 297 oz., at &pound;2
17s. 6d. per oz. = &pound;853 17s. 6d.</p>
<p>1900.&mdash;Great drought; only crushing (from Claudie Lakeland mine), 21
tons for 42 oz., say &pound;120.</p>
<p>1901.-48 3/4 tons crushed for 67 oz. 1 dwt., say &pound;200.</p>
<p>1902-5.&mdash;Returns not kept separate from Coen returns. The only return
distinguishable is from the "Leo Lakeland" mine (1905), 4 tons for 24&frac14;
oz., say &pound;72.</p>
<p>1906-8.&mdash;No report.</p>
<p>1909.&mdash;Evennett and party were working the "Diamond King" mine near
Lakeland's mill, which they had hired. Hans Dehn and party worked some
"leaders" and crushed 4 tons for 40 oz.</p>
<p>1910.&mdash;Crushings 56&frac12; tons for 286&frac12; oz., at &pound;3 per
oz. =&pound;847 10s. (This included Dehn's crushing of 1909.)</p>
<p>No further returns are given up to the end of 1914, when the population was
estimated at four.</p>
<p>The value of the total recorded output from reefs approximates &pound;8,443
6s. 6d. The amount of alluvial gold has not been recorded.</p>

<p>WILLIAM BOWDEN, 1892-1901</p>
<p><b>TAKES PART IN DISCOVERY OF BOWDEN MINERAL FIELD. WOLFRAM WORKED. FIELD
PROCLAIMED, 1907. TAKES PART IN DISCOVERY OF ALLUVIAL GOLD ON RUNNING STARCKE
RIVER, 1890. PROSPECTING FOR GOLD ON PHIL? AND MOREHEAD RIVERS, 1901.</b></p>
<p>THE PASCOE RIVER, at the mouth of which the majority of Kennedy's ill-fated
party were left to die, was named in honour of Lieutenant Pascoe, the officer
in command of the Marines who arrived at Somerset in 1863. (SEE MAPS C AND
B.)</p>
<p>The course of the river is somewhat remarkable. It takes its rise among the
highest summits of the Janet Range and courses for 16 miles S. by E. Next it
runs W. by N. for 22 miles, dividing the Janet and McIlwraith Ranges. It then
runs N. for 17 miles till it receives Canoe Creek on its right bank, when it
turns to the NE. and reaches the ocean in 28 miles more. Its mouth is within 16
miles of its head.</p>
<p>The area which was proclaimed in 1907 as the BOWDEN MINERAL FIELD forms the
"peninsula" lying between the Pascoe River and Canoe Creek (the latter named by
me in 1880). To this district came in 1892 the prospectors, WILLIAM BOWDEN,
JOHN DICKIE and WILLIAM LAKELAND, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> who had left
Bairdsville in December in search of gold. Their DISCOVERY OF WOLFRAM at this
date was, unfortunately for them, premature, as the metal, which has since
risen to a high price owing to warlike demands, was then almost unsaleable.
Having failed in the principal object of their search, the party returned to
Bairdsville and eventually left for Croydon. In 1900, "BOWDEN, with two mates,
paid a visit to the locality, but only finding one small lode, it was condemned
as being too small." <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> In 1904 a party of miners
went out from Coen, located a lode and pegged out a prospecting claim. Their
names are given by Dick as WILLIAMSON, EVENNETT, ENRIGHT, STAIT and G. BROWN.
"Six other lodes," says the Warden, "were shortly found," and for a few months
there was quite a lot of activity at this place, with about fifteen or sixteen
miners in the camp. Most of them were obliged to go to Coen for rations,</p>
<blockquote>[1) Dick's <i>Mineral Resources of the Cook District</i>, p. 27,

1911</i>, p. 62.]</blockquote>

<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 732}</u></p>
<p>and packed their WOLFRAM there. A few men went in search of a route, and to
find a port on the coast, but failed. Tenders were called, and the wolfram was
afterwards packed to Port Stewart, a distance of 140 miles. In 1905,
SUB-INSPECTOR ROLAND W. GARRAWAY arrived with his black troopers and found and
marked a TRACK TO LLOYD BAY. For some time after that only about seven men
remained working the field until 1907, when on account of the price of wolfram
rising, a rush set in, and it was not long before about fifty men were on the
field, and in June of that year the FIELD was PROCLAIMED and named after the
discoverer. There was quite a boom in wolfram, and the storekeepers gave
&pound;150 per ton for the ore on the ground and packed it to Lloyd Bay. As the
wet season approached, the majority of the men deserted the place, leaving a
mere handful of men behind them, and from thence to the present time they have
dwindled down to a small number.</p>
<p>"On the discovery of the Batavia River gold, this field was deserted by the
miners for the new rush, so that the production for the year was very small,
being only half a ton. Since September, a few men have gone back." <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<p>From a telegram from the Mining Registrar at Coen, printed in the
<i>Government Mining Journal</i> of November, 1904, we learn that Douglas, a
member of a party which had been mining wolfram at the Stewart River, had
visited Bowen and reported that the Pascoe was navigable for 7 miles by 10-ton
craft.</p>
<p>Bowden himself was for some time, during the active life of the field, the
principal exporter of wolfram.</p>
<p>The wolfram returns from the field are tabulated in the Annual Reports of
the Department of Mines as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In addition to wolfram, the field is a small producer of MOLYBDENITE and TIN
OXIDE.</p>
<p>In 1890, BOWDEN and CAIRNS DISCOVERED GOLD in the valley of the 4 4 RUNNING
STARCKE RIVER." (SEE MAP E.) The alluvial in the gullies at the head of
Diggings Creek supported some 200 men for a period of six months, and a smaller
number for five</p>

<p>years, but the find was never officially reported as payable. Alluvial gold
was discovered by WEBB and party on the lower part of the valley in 1896, and
at once reported to the Warden.'</p>
<p>In 1901, Bowden was prospecting, with Government assistance, and found a
belt of auriferous country on a branch of the Alice (i.e., PHILP) RIVER. (SEE
MAPS F AND E.) His best prospects were 1 dwt. of GOLD to a dish. He also found
"fair prospects" of ALLUVIAL GOLD on heads of the MOREHEAD RIVER.</p>

<p>IT is perhaps less singular than it at first appears that a successful
prospector should be found among the aborigines, when we take into
consideration the highly cultivated powers of observation inherent in the race.
It may be mentioned that Ernest Henry, the discoverer of the Cloncurry
copper-field, availed himself extensively of the services of aborigines whom he
had taught to identify copper ores.</p>
<p>PLUTO, AN ABORIGINAL from the Rockhampton district, had been prospecting for
some time <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> when he found ALLUVIAL GOLD in the
Batavia River, about 5 miles below the infall of Sefton Creek. The discovery
was made in October, 1910, and as soon as it leaked out the place was rushed by
about so diggers from Coen and Ebagoolah. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The
Warden estimated a yield of 2,500 ounces (&pound;3 12s. 6d. per ounce) to the
end of 1911, the LARGEST NUGGET weighing 74 ounces.</p>
<p>Pluto took a white mate, named ANDERSON, presumably to enable him legally to
hold a prospecting claim, from which they got 213 oz. in nuggets weighing 5,
10, 15 and 19 oz. Other claims yielded nuggets of 15, 25, 53, and 73 oz. (the
last may have been the 74-oz. nugget referred to by the warden); in all, to
August, 1911, 1,200 oz. <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> In 1911, E. DOWNS, of
Townsville, got 400 oz. of gold from a gully which now bears his name, about 2
miles west of PLUTOVILLE, and GLEESON, WARD and WEISS also found payable gold
in other gullies. PLUTO also DISCOVERED GOLD at CHOCK-A-BLOCK, 8 miles NNE. of
Plutoville, and from this place Downs</p>

<p>obtained 40 oz. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The total for 1912 is given
at 1,500 oz. (&pound;3 12s. 6d. per ounce) in the Departmental Report.
Forty-seven men were working on the field.</p>
<p>In 1913, Warden Power reported that the population had fallen to twelve or
fifteen, and estimated the output of gold at 859&frac14; oz. The largest NUGGET
found was 121 1/5 oz.; another was 98 oz. and five others ran into double
figures.</p>
<p>Writing on 15th August, 1913, Dick informed me that he had ascertained that
a NUGGET of 112 oz. had recently been found (probably the 121 1/5 oz. nugget
mentioned by the Warden), and that previously others weighing 72, 46, 20, 15,
10, 65 and 33 oz. had been found.</p>
<p>For 1914, the official return of alluvial gold is only 135 3/4 oz., at
&pound;3 10s. per ounce.</p>
<p>In March and April, 1915, the Warden reports a recovery of 176 oz. 12 dwt.
from a gully near DOWNS' GULLY. The greatest part of this appears to have been
a single NUGGET weighing 130 oz. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Later returns
are not available.</p>
<p>A peculiarity of this field is that the gold occurs almost exclusively in
the form of nuggets, with very little which could be described as "fine."</p>
<p>Pluto's death, which occurred at the Coen township in January, 1916, is
recorded by Mr. James Dick, <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> who adds that up
to that date Plutoville had produced gold to the value of more than
&pound;20,000. He mentions that at this time there were twenty miners at
Plutoville and two stores kept by Messrs. Dehn and Sheppard.</p>
<p>In the earlier days of his prospecting, Pluto was indebted for assistance
and equipment to H. WADE RONINSON, <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b>
Officer-in-Charge of the Cape York Telegraph Station for about twenty years
prior to 1917, who had previously been from time to time Telegraph and Post
Master at Mein and other stations on the line. Mr. Robinson could always be
counted on by the prospector not only for material assistance, but also for
gratuitous advice and guidance, rendered doubly valuable by his accumulated
local knowledge. His presence in the Peninsula was an example of the indirect
benefits which resulted from the construction of the Telegraph line. Mr.
Robinson was a native of Norfolk Island and descended from one of the mutineers
of the "<i>Bounty</i>." He died in Sydney late in the year 1917.</p>

<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>THE merest glance at the map is sufficient to impress the observer with the
importance of Torres Strait to Australia and the British Empire. No argument is
required to strengthen the impression.</p>
<p>If Australia's white population were equally distributed throughout, and the
Cape York Peninsula held a share of the people in proportion to her area, one
of the problems of the Empire would be amazingly simplified. No chance of such
a solution is in sight within a reasonable time. The tropical North can only be
populated as it ought to be by the slow process of pressure from an already
sufficiently occupied South. In all probability some generations will have come
and gone before pressure from behind can be expected to operate in this
direction.</p>
<p>If the Cape York Peninsula, almost joining on, as it does, to New Guinea,
were even occupied by a virile indigenous race carrying within itself the seeds
of progress and logically satisfied that its best interests are bound up with
the prosperity of the British Empire, the problem would be met with a
satisfactory, if still a second-best solution. Unhappily no such race is
indigenous, and it is no more possible to import one than it would be to permit
one to settle of its own accord.</p>
<p>The case is indeed far otherwise. This northern land is thinly peopled by a
feeble folk inevitably doomed to vanish from the face of the earth within the
current century. Fair dealing, kindness, philanthropy and Christianity alike
have proved their inability to stay the operation of a natural law, mysterious
and deplorable though the law may be. The most experienced missionary, who has
tried many experiments for the amelioration of the aborigines, during an effort
sustained over a twenty-eight years' residence, goes no further than to claim
that the natives may be taught to a limited extent the advantages of civilised
living, but admits that the teaching is less successful with the pure-blooded
natives than with their half-caste offspring. Logically, it may be assumed as a
corollary that the more the native blood is diluted the better. To any
stud-master or student of eugenics the idea of leaving the future of the North
to a breed tainted at its fountain-head is in the last degree repugnant, and
politically it is full of danger. In</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 737}</u></p>
<p>my opinion, the only course open to us is to guard the strait and wait
patiently for the pressure from behind.</p>
<p>The physiographical condition of the Peninsula must be frankly taken into
account. The northern part of the interior is at present, to all intents, a
desert, with oases. The desert is a desert with characteristics of its own, as
will be pointed out presently. At Fair Cape, however, there begins to emerge
from beneath the desert land a region of what may be called normal country,
rising to the south into mountain ranges which tropical sunshine and a fairly
liberal rainfall combine to clothe with healthy vegetation and often with
luxuriant jungle. Traced southward, the high and healthy land broadens westward
from the Pacific Coast and ultimately surrounds the base of the Peninsula and
the southern shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria. This high land contains mines
of gold, silver, iron, copper and most of the rarer of the so-called "base
metals." The exploitation of these mines will occupy the attention of white men
for some generations at least, while the pastoral occupation of some portions
of the Gulf Coast lands and of the "oases" in the desert may take rank as a
more lasting asset. Even now, the cleared "scrub"(jungle) land on the Pacific
side of the rim of high land, between Cooktown and Mackay, furnishes some of
the richest agricultural areas in the tropics.</p>
<p>On the southern shore of the Gulf, two towns, Burketown and Normanton, have
been created by the necessity for the forwarding of supplies to the good lands
in the background and for the export of their products. Along the 500 miles of
its eastern shore (the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula) the only centres
of population are the aboriginal mission stations conducted by the Church of
England and the Presbyterians and a small establishment of officials at the
northern end of the Telegraph line. On Thursday Island is a town which, in a
sense, guards the straits and the northern "Land's End" of Australia. South of
Cape York there is no settlement of any consequence on the Pacific shore till
Cooktown is reached after a voyage of 430 miles. Inside of the portion of the
Peninsula thus outlined, the little township of Coen and perhaps that of
Ebagoolah may be considered stable settlements, and up the backbone of the
Peninsula runs the Telegraph line with its six stations. South of Cooktown, the
eastern coast-line of the Peninsula shows the towns of Port Douglas, Cairns,
Innisfail, Cardwell and Ingham. The latter marks the southern limit of the
eastern boundary of the Peninsula, as the Peninsula may be defined on strictly
geographical lines. The ring of populous areas is prolonged westward to its
Normanton starting-point along the base of the strictly defined "Peninsula" by
towns of more or less importance at Atherton, Herberton, Irvinebank,
Montalbion, Thornborough, Stannary Hills, Chillagoe, Einasleigh, Forsayth,
Georgetown and Croydon. A still more southerly zone of towns</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 738}</u></p>
<p>extends westward from Townsville on the Pacific coast, through Charters
Towers, Hughenden, Richmond and Cloncurry to Camooweal.</p>
<p>Within the more strictly defined area of the Peninsula, the population
problem still awaits a solution. The first experiment towards its solution is
now being made by the Queensland Government. Its essential principle is the
resumption or repurchase and nationalisation of the leases which cover
practically the whole of the available pastoral land.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine any trade less adapted for communistic management than that
of the grazier or squatter. Hitherto the runs have been held by the pioneers or
their successors, with a limited staff of stockmen, some of whom are of pure
aboriginal blood, although the majority are white. The life of "cattlemen," as
I have seen it again and again over the length and breadth of Queensland,
contains times of the most strenuous exertion such as no human being could
maintain all the year round, and which even an Australian could not maintain
but for the compensation of long spells of leisure. How will it be when the
runs arc worked by associations of men who fix their own wages and hours, who
scorn contracts and declare for day labour only, who demand two Sundays in the
week, a "bank-to-bank" reckoning of time, the abolition of night shifts and
compensation for getting wet? A squatter with whom I argued on these lines
replied lightly that "it has not come to that yet." Not yet, but it may come to
that as the doctrines of the Workers of the factories, plantations, mines and
meatworks gather head, while they press on towards their Utopia of all pay and
no work. I can foresee no end to the State stock-raising experiment but
<i>fiasco</i> and <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>.</p>
<p>I look more hopefully to the discovery of some means of utilising the
"desert" and making it attractive to settlers, in fact, to a demonstration that
the desert is not a desert after all.</p>
<p>A horse, or a rider whose life depends on the ability of his horse to live
on the country, may be forgiven if he labels the interior of the Peninsula a
desert, for there is no grass for the horse. Still, there may be grave doubts
if grass or something equally useful could not be made to grow where scrub,
brushwood and "heath" flourish luxuriantly ("jungle" would be a better word
than "scrub," as the distinction between scrub and brushwood is not popularly
recognised). My impression is that there is no grass between the trees and
scrubs of the jungle," heath "and brushwood simply because the ground is
littered with leaves, which, under the atmospheric conditions prevailing in the
district, become tan. Grass is not likely to grow on a tan track. Is it not at
least possible that the clearing of the present rank vegetation would be
followed by the growth of grass, or that something else of value could be</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 739}</u></p>
<p>planted? What about sago palms? <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> And what
about coco-nut palms? Granting that the Utingu coco-nut plantation, opposite
Possession Island, may be on exceptionally suitable (cleared) scrub land (see
Chapter XLVII), there are thousands of square miles of luxuriant scrub (or
jungle) in the Peninsula, and a still greater area of brushwood and" heath,"
which latter could be inexpensively cleared. The coco-nut palm, so far as I
know, is not fastidious in its demands for a rich soil. Its well-being seems to
depend mainly on climatic conditions. As a matter of fact, these palms have
been planted with success on many of the northern stations as well as in the
clearings surrounding the stations of the Cape York Telegraph line. A friend
who has given much attention to the cultivation of fodder-stuffs suggests that
cleared" wet desert "land might profitably be sown with lucerne to be baled and
exported for the supply of drought-stricken, or at least less favoured
regions.</p>
<p>I have in my mind the instance of the Mallee Scrub, Victoria, which the
clearing of the scrub has transmuted into valuable wheat land, although to all
appearance the soil is little better than sand. There is, in fact, one
difference between the "Mallee Scrub" and what has been popularly named, or
nicknamed, the "wet desert," and it is all in favour of the latter. Even where
there is not much to choose between the light and sandy soils of the two areas,
the northern desert, as its nickname implies, is abundantly watered. It may be
that, with the clearing of the present vegetation, some or all of the
"permanent" running streams will disappear in dry seasons, but I am confident
that even in that case shallow wells would strike water. If so, the conditions
in these northern latitudes would be favourable to the close settlement of a
white agricultural or arboricultural population. But I should not advocate the
initiation of the experiment with day labour. I hope, on the contrary, that it
will one day be made by free men, driven by the force behind and the innate
impulse to explore new fields, and assured that they or their offspring will be
permitted to reap the benefit of their industry and enterprise.</p>

"The Curse of Sago," in <i>The Dutch East</i> (London, 1914), in which the

made from sago cultivation makes for the deterioration of the race and the
depopulation of the region.]</blockquote>
