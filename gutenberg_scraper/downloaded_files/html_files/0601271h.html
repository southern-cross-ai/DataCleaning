<h2>Last Men in London</h2>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Olaf Stapledon</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>THOUGH this is a work of fiction, it does not pretend to be a novel.
It has no hero but Man. Since its purpose is not the characterization
of individual human beings, no effort has been made to endow its few
persons with distinctive personalities. There is no plot, except the
theme of man's struggle in this awkward age to master himself and to
come to terms with the universe. This theme I seek to present by
imagining that a member of a much more developed human species, living
on Neptune two thousand million years hence, enters into our minds to
observe the Terrestrial field through our eyes but with his own
intelligence. Using one of us as a mouthpiece, he contrives to tell us
something of his findings. The shortcomings of his report must be
attributed to the limitations of his Terrestrial instrument.</p>

<p>This book is intelligible without reference to another fantasy,
which I produced two years ago, and called Last and First Men. But
readers of that earlier book will find that Last Men in London is
complementary to it. In both, the same Neptunian being speaks, formerly
to tell the story of man's career between our day and his, now to
describe the spiritual drama which, he tells us, underlies the whole
confused history of our species, and comes to its crisis today. The
present book is supposed to be communicated from a date in Neptunian
history later than the body of the earlier book, but before its
epilogue.</p>

<p>The last section of the chapter on the War, though it makes use to
some extent of personal experience, is none the less fiction.</p>

<p>It will be obvious to many readers that I have been influenced by
the very suggestive work of Mr Gerald Heard. I hope he will forgive me
for distorting some of his ideas for my own purpose.</p>

<p>My thanks are due once more to Mr E. V. Rieu for many valuable
criticisms and suggestions; and to Professor and Mrs L. C. Martin (who
read the untidy manuscript) for condemnation and encouragement without
which the book would have been much worse than it is. Finally I would
thank my wife both for hard labour, and for other help which she is
apparently incapable of appreciating.</p>

<p>Let me remind the reader that henceforth and up to the opening of
the Epilogue the speaker is a Neptunian man of the very remote
future.</p>

<p>W. O. S.<br>
September 1932</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<h4>THE FUTURE'S CONCERN WITH THE PAST</h4>

<p>MEN and women of Earth! Brief Terrestrials, of that moment when the
First Human Species hung in the crest of its attainment, wavelike,
poised for downfall, I a member of the last Human Species, address you
for a second time from an age two thousand million years after your
day, from an age as remotely future to you as the Earth's beginning is
remotely past.</p>

<p>In my earlier communication I told of the huge flux of events
between your day and mine. I told of the rise and fall of many
mankinds, of the spirit's long desolations and brief splendours. I told
how, again and again, after age-long sleep, man woke to see dimly what
he should be doing with himself; how he strove accordingly to master
his world and his own nature; and how, each time, circumstances or his
own ignorance and impotence flung him back into darkness. I told how he
struggled with invaders, and how he was driven from planet to planet,
refashioning himself for each new world. I told, not only of his great
vicissitudes, but also of the many and diverse modes of mind which he
assumed in different epochs. I told how at length, through good fortune
and skilled control, there was fashioned a more glorious mankind, the
Eighteenth Human Species, my own. I hinted as best I might at the great
richness and subtlety, the perfect harmony and felicity, of this last
expression of the human spirit. I told of our discovery that our own
fair planet must soon be destroyed with all the sun's offspring; and of
our exultant acceptance even of this doom. I told of the final
endeavours which the coming end imposes on us.</p>

<p>In this my second communication I shall say little of my own world,
and less of the ages that lie between us. Instead I shall speak mostly
of your world and of yourselves. I shall try to show you yourselves
through the eyes of the Last Men. Of myself and my fellow-workers, I
shall speak, but chiefly as the link between your world and mine, as
pioneering explorers in your world, and secret dwellers in your minds.
I shall tell of the difficulties and dangers of our strange exploration
of ages that to us are past, and of our still stranger influence upon
past minds. But mostly I shall speak of men and women living in Europe
in your twentieth Christian century, and of a great crisis that we
observe in your world, a great opportunity which you tragically fail to
grasp.</p>

<p>In relation to the long drama which I unfolded in my earlier
communication it might well seem that even the most urgent and the most
far-reaching events of your little sphere are utterly trivial. The rise
and fall of your world-moving individuals, the flowering and withering
of your nations, and all their blind, plant-like struggle for
existence, the slow changes and sudden upheavals of your society, the
archaic passions of your religious sects, and quick-changes of your
fashionable thought, all seem, in relation to those aeons of history,
no more than the ineffective gyrations of flotsam of the great river of
humanity, whose direction is determined, not by any such superficial
movements, but by the thrust of its own mass and the configuration of
the terrain.</p>

<p>In the light of the stars what significance is there in such minute
events as the defeat of an army, the issue of a political controversy,
the success or failure of a book, the result of a football match? In
that cold light even the downfall of a species is a matter of little
importance. And the final extinction of man, after his two thousand
million years of precarious blundering, is but the cessation of one
brief tremulous theme in the great music of the cosmos.</p>

<p>Yet minute events have sometimes remarkable consequences. Again and
again this was evident in the great story that I told. And now I am to
describe events some of which, though momentary and minute in relation
to the whole career of man, are yet in relation to yourselves
long-drawn-out and big with destiny. In consequence of these momentary
happenings, so near you, yet so obscure, man's career is fated to he
the Weary succession of disasters and incomplete victories which I
described on an earlier occasion.</p>

<p>But the account of these events, though it is in some sense the main
theme of this book, is not its sole, not even its chief purpose. I
shall say much of your baseness, much of your futility. But all that I
say, if I say it well, and if the mind that I have chosen for my
mouthpiece serves me adequately, shall be kindled with a sense of that
beauty which, in spite of all your follies and treasons, is yours
uniquely. For though the whole career of your species is so confused
and barren, and though, against the background of the rise and fall of
species after species and the destruction of world after world, the
life of any individual among you, even the most glorious, seems so
completely ineffective and insignificant, yet, in the least member of
your or any other species, there lies for the discerning eye a beauty
peculiar not only to that one species but to that one individual.</p>

<p>To us the human dawn is precious for its own sake. And it is as
creatures of the dawn that we regard you, even in your highest
achievement. To us the early human natures and every primitive human
individual have a beauty which we ourselves, in spite of all our
triumphs, have not; the beauty namely of life's first bewildered
venturing upon the wings of the spirit, the beauty of the child with
all its innocent brutishness and cruelty. We understand the past better
than it can understand itself, and love it better than it can love
itself. Seeing it in relation to all things, we see it as it is; and so
we can observe even its follies and treasons with reverence, knowing
that we ourselves would have behaved so, had we been so placed and so
fashioned. The achievements of the past, however precarious and
evanescent, we salute with respect, knowing well that to achieve
anything at all in such circumstances and with such a nature entailed a
faith and fortitude which in those days were miracles. We are therefore
moved by filial piety to observe all the past races of men, and if
possible every single individual life, with careful precision, so that,
before we are destroyed, we may crown those races our equals in glory
though not in achievement. Thus we shall contribute to the cosmos a
beauty which it would otherwise lack, namely the critical yet admiring
love which we bear toward you.</p>

<p>But it is not only as observers that we, who are of man's evening,
are concerned with you, children of the dawn. In my earlier message I
told how the future might actually influence the past, how beings such
as my contemporaries, who have in some degree the freedom of eternity,
may from their footing in eternity, reach into past minds and
contribute to their experience. For whatever is truly eternal is
present equally in all times; and so we, in so far as we are capable of
eternity, are influences present in your age. I said that we seek out
all those points in past history where our help is entailed for the
fulfilment of the past's own nature, and that this work of inspiration
has become one of our main tasks. How this can be, I shall explain more
fully later. Strange it is indeed that we, who are so closely occupied
with the great adventure of racial experience, so closely also with
preparations to face the impending ruin of our world, and with research
for dissemination of a seed of life in remote regions of the galaxy,
should yet also find ourselves under obligation toward the vanished and
unalterable past.</p>

<p>No influence of ours can save your species from destruction. Nothing
could save it but a profound change in your own nature; and that cannot
be. Wandering among you, we move always with fore-knowledge of the doom
which your own imperfection imposes on you. Even if we could, we would
not change it; for it is a theme required in the strange music of the
spheres.</p>

<h2>1 THE WORLD OF THE LAST MEN</h2>

<blockquote>i. HOLIDAY ON NEPTUNE<br>
ii. MEN AND MAN<br>
iii. BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</blockquote>

<h3>i. HOLIDAY ON NEPTUNE</h3>

<p>WHEN I am in your world and your epoch I remember often a certain
lonely place in my own world, and in the time that I call present. It
is a comer where the land juts out into the sea as a confusion of split
rocks, like a herd of monsters crowding into the water. Subterranean
forces acting at this point once buckled the planet's crust into a
mountain; but it was immediately tom and shattered by gravity, that
implacable djin of all great worlds. Nothing is now left of it but
these rocks. On Neptune we have no mountains, and the oceans are
waveless. The stout sphere holds its watery cloak so tightly to it that
even the most violent hurricanes fail to raise more than a ripple.</p>

<p>Scattered among these rocks lies a network of tiny fjords, whose
walls and floors are embossed with variegated life. There you may see
beneath the crystal water all manner of blobs and knobs and brilliant
whorls, all manner of gaudy flowers, that search with their petals, or
rhythmically smack their lips, all manner of clotted sea-weeds, green,
brown, purple or crimson, from whose depths sometimes a claw reaches
after a drowsing sprat, while here and there a worm, fringed with legs,
emerges to explore the sandy sunlit bottom.</p>

<p>Among these rocks and fjords I spent my last day of leisure before
setting out on one of those lengthy explorations of the past which have
made me almost as familiar with your world as with my own. It is my
task to tell you of your own race as it appears through the eyes of the
far future; but first I must help you to reconstruct in imagination
something of the future itself, and of the world from which we regard
you. This I can best achieve by describing, first that day of delight,
spent where the broken mountain sprawls into the sea, and then a more
august event, namely the brief awakening of the Racial Mind, which was
appointed for the exaltation of the explorers upon the eve of their
departure into the obscure recesses of past aeons. Finally I shall tell
you something of my own upbringing and career.</p>

<p>Almost the first moments of that day of recreation afforded me one
of those pictures which haunt the memory ever after. The sun had risen
over a burning ocean. He was not, as you might expect in our remote
world, a small and feeble sun; for between your age and ours a
collision had increased his bulk and splendour to a magnitude somewhat
greater than that with which you are familiar.</p>

<p>Overhead the sky was blue. But for Neptunian eyes its deep azure was
infused with another unique primary colour, which your vision could not
have detected. Toward the sunrise, this tincture of the zenith gave
place to green, gold, fire-red, purple, and yet another of the hues
which elude the primitive eye. Opposite there lay darkness. But low in
the darkness gleamed something which you would have taken for a very
distant snowy horn, whose base was lost in night, though its crest
glowed orange in the morning. A second glance would have revealed it as
too precipitous and too geometrical for any mountain. It was in fact
one of our great public buildings, many scores of miles distant, and
nearly one score in height. In a world where mountains are crushed by
their own weight these towering edifices could not stand, were it not
for their incredibly rigid materials, wherein artificial atoms play the
chief part. The huge crag of masonry now visible was relatively new,
but it could compare in age with the younger of your terrestrial
mountains.</p>

<p>The shadowed sides of its buttresses and gables, and also the
shadowed faces of the near rocks and of every stone, glowed with a
purple bloom, the light from a blinding violet star. This portent we
call the Mad Star. It is a unique heavenly body, whose energies are
being squandered with inconceivable haste, so that it will soon be
burnt out. Meanwhile it is already infecting its neighbours with its
plague. In a few thousand years our own sun will inevitably run amok in
the same manner, and turn all his planets to white-hot gas. But at
present, I mean in the age which I call present, the Mad Star is only a
brilliant feature of our night sky.</p>

<p>On the morning of which I am speaking there lay full length on the
brink of a little cliff, and gazing into the pool beneath her, a woman
of my world. To me she is lovely, exquisite, the very embodiment of
beauty; to you she would seem a strange half-human monster. To me, as
she lay there with her breasts against the rock and one arm reaching
down into the water, her whole form expressed the lightness and
suppleness of a panther. To you she would have seemed unwieldy,
elephantine, and grotesque in every feature. Yet if you were to see her
moving in her own world, you would know, I think, why her name in our
speech is the equivalent of Panther in yours.</p>

<p>If you or any of your kind were to visit our world, and if by
miracle you were to survive for a few moments in our alien atmosphere,
gravity would make it almost impossible for you to support yourselves
at all. But we, since our bones, like our buildings, are formed largely
of artificial atoms, and are far more rigid than steel, since moreover
our muscle cells have been most cunningly designed, can run and jump
with ease. It is true, however, that in spite of our splendid tissues
we have to be more solidly built than the Terrestrials, whose limbs
remind us unpleasantly of insects.</p>

<p>The woman on the rock would certainly have surprised you, for she is
a member of one of our most recent generations, whose skin and flesh
are darkly translucent. Seeing her there, with the sunlight drenching
her limbs, you might have taken her for a statue, cut from some
wine-dark alabaster, or from carbuncle; save that, with every movement
of her arm, sunken gleams of crimson, topaz, and gold-brown rippled the
inner night of her shoulder and flank. Her whole substance, within its
lovely curves and planes, looked scarcely solid, but rather a volume of
obscure flame and smoke poised on the rock. On her head a mass of hair,
flame-like, smoke-like, was a reversion to the primitive in respect of
which she could never decide whether it was a thing for shame or
complacency. It was this pre-historic decoration which first drew me
toward her. In a closer view you would have noticed that on her back
and the outer sides of her limbs the skin's translucency was
complicated by a very faint leopard-like mottling. I also bear that
mottling; but I am of the sort whose flesh is opaque, and my
bronze-green skin is of a texture somewhat harsher than I should
choose. In her, how well I know it, the skin is soft and rich to the
exploring hand.</p>

<p>While I watched her, she raised her face from studying the
water-dwellers, and looked at me, laughing. It was that look which gave
me the brief but strangely significant experience the memory of which
was to refresh me so often in your uncouth world. It was not only that
her face was lit up with merriment and tenderness; but in that fleeting
expression the very spirit of humanity seemed to regard me. I cannot
make you realize the potency of that glance, for the faces of your own
kind afford almost no hint of such illumination. I can only assert that
in our species, facial expression is more developed than in yours. The
facial muscles respond to every changing flicker of experience and
emotion, as pools respond to every breath of wind with a thousand
criss-cross rippling tremors.</p>

<p>The face that now looked at me was unlike terrestrial countenances
both in its subtly alien contours and in its dark translucency, which
half-revealed the underlying paleness of bone. It was like a stirred
and dancing pool of dark but warm-tinted wine, in which the sunlight
revelled. But the eyes were bright jewels capable of many phases from
sapphire to emerald.</p>

<p>Like others of our kind, this girl bore two additional bright eyes
in the back of her head. They sparkled quaintly in the archaic glory of
her hair. Like the rest of us, she had on her crown yet another and
more important organ of vision which we call the astronomical eye.
Normally sunken level with her hair, it could at will be projected
upwards like a squat telescope. The exquisite development of this organ
in her had determined her career. All of us are in a manner
astronomers; but she is an astronomer by profession.</p>

<p>Her whole face, though so brilliantly alive, was unlike any human
type known to readers of this book, since it was so much more animal.
Her nose was broad and feline, but delicately moulded. Her full lips
were subtle at the corners. Her ears moved among her locks like the
ears of a lion.</p>

<p>Grotesque, you say, inhuman! No! Beside this the opaque and sluggish
faces of your proudest beauties are little better than lumps of clay,
or the masks of insects.</p>

<p>But indeed it is impossible for you to see her as I saw her then.
For in that look there seemed to find expression the whole achievement
of our race, and the full knowledge of its impending tragedy. At the
same time there was in it a half-mischievous piety toward the little
simple creatures that she had been watching, and equally, it seemed,
toward the stars and man himself.</p>

<p>Smiling, she now spoke to me; if I may call 'speech' the telepathic
influence which invaded my brain from hers.</p>

<p>That you may understand the significance of her words, I must
explain that in our Neptunian rock-pools there are living things of
three very different stocks. The first is rare. One may encounter in
some sheltered cranny a vague greenish slime. This is the only relic of
primeval Neptunian life, long since outclassed by invaders. The second
stock is by far the commonest throughout our world. Nearly all our
living types are triumphant descendants of the few animals and plants
which men brought, deliberately or by accident, to Neptune from Venus,
nearly a thousand million years before my day, and almost as long after
the age that you call present. Third, there are also, even in these
little fjords, a few descendants of those ancient men themselves. These
very remote cousins of my own human species are, of course,
fantastically degenerate. Most have long ago ceased to be recognizably
human; but in one, whose name in our language you might translate
'Homunculus', nature has achieved a minute and exquisite caricature of
humanity. Two splay feet glue him to the rock. From these rises an
erect and bulbous belly, wearing on its summit an upturned face. The
unpleasantly human mouth keeps opening and shutting. The eyes are mere
wrinkles, the nose a wide double trumpet. The ears, deaf but mobile,
have become two broad waving fans, that direct a current of water
toward the mouth. Beneath each ear is a little wart-like excrescence,
all that is left of the human arm and hand.</p>

<p>One of these degenerate human beings, one of these fallen
descendants of your own kind, had attracted my companion's attention.
Laughing, she said, 'Little Homunculus has got wind of his mate, and he
can't unstick his feet to go after her. What a pilgrimage it will be
for him after a whole month of standing still!'</p>

<p>She looked down again and cried, 'Quick! Come and see! He's loose,
he's moved an inch. He's waddling at breakneck speed. Now he's got her,
and she's willing.' After a pause she exclaimed, 'What a world this
pond is! Like the world that you are to plunge into so soon.'</p>

<p>Then she looked up at the fierce star, and the light in her face
changed and chilled. She became like your Egyptian Sphinx, which looks
across the desert and waits, for something unknown and terrible, but
the appointed end.</p>

<p>Suddenly she laughed, sprang to her feet, ran down the rock-edge to
the sea, and dived. I followed; and the rest of the morning we spent
swimming, either far out in the bay or among the islets and fjords,
chasing each other sometimes through submarine rock-arches, or clinging
to a sunken tussock of weed to watch some drama of the sea-bottom.</p>

<p>At last, when the sun was high, we returned to the grassy place
where we had slept, and took from the pockets of our flying-suits our
meal of rich sun-products. Of these, some had been prepared in the
photosynthesis stations on Jupiter, others came from the colonies on
Uranus; but we ourselves had gathered the delicacies in our own
orchards and gardens.</p>

<p>Having eaten, we lay back on the grass and talked of matters great
and small.</p>

<p>I challenged her: 'This has been the best of all our matings.'
'Yes,' she answered, 'because the shortest? Because after the richest
experience in separation. And perhaps because of the Star.'</p>

<p>'In spite of all your lovers,' I exulted, 'you come back to me. In
spite of your tigers, your bulls, and all your lap-dog lovers, where
you squander yourself.'</p>

<p>'Yes, old python, I come back to you, the richer for that
squandering. And you in spite of all the primroses and violets and
blowsy roses and over-scented lilies that you have plucked and dropped,
you come back to me, after your thousand years of roaming.'</p>

<p>'Again and again I shall come back, if I escape from the
Terrestrials, and if the Star permits.'</p>

<p>Our conversation, let me repeat, was telepathic. If I were to report
all that passed from mind to mind as we lay in the sun that afternoon,
I should fill a book; for telepathic communication is incomparably
swifter and more subtle than vocal speech. We ranged over all manner of
subjects, from the difference between her eyes and mine, which are
crimson, to the awakening of the Racial Mind, which we had experienced
some thousands of years earlier, and were so soon to experience again.
We talked also about the marriage groups to which we severally
belonged, and of our own strange irregular yet seemingly permanent
union outside our respective groups. We talked about the perplexing but
lovely nature of our son, whom she had been allowed to conceive at our
last meeting. We spoke also of her work in one of the great
observatories. With other astronomers she was trying to discover in
some distant region of our galaxy a possible home for the human seed
which, it was hoped, would be scattered among the stars before man's
destruction. We spoke also of the work on which I am engaged as one of
the million specialists who are trying to complete the exploration of
the human past by direct participation in it. Inevitably we spoke also
of the Star, and of the coming destruction of our world; and of how, if
we were both alive in that age we would cling together.</p>

<p>Before sundown we clambered over the rocks and ran inland over the
flower-strewn turf. But at last we returned to our grassy nest; and
after supper, when darkness had fallen, we were moved to sing, together
or each in turn. Sometimes our choice fell upon the latest, wildest,
scintillations of rhythm and melody, sometimes on the old songs of her
nation or mine, sometimes on the crude chants which we explorers had
discovered among the ancient peoples and in extinct worlds. In
particular I taught her a Terrestrial song which I myself had found.
With difficulty we formed the uncouth syllables and caught the lilt.
With difficulty we called up in imagination the dark confusion that
gave it birth, the harshness of man to man, and the yearning for a
better world. Readers of this book may know the song. Old Man River is
its name.</p>

<p>While we were still striving with this archaic melody, the colours
of the sunset gave place to the profound azure which the Neptunian sky
assumes by night for Neptunian eyes. Stars began to appear, first
singly and faintly, then in companies and brightly patterned
constellations. The wide heaven flashed with them. The Milky Way, flung
from horizon to horizon, revealed itself to us, not as a pale
cloud-zone, but as an incredibly multitudinous host of lights. Here and
there our astronomical eyes could detect even those misty points which
are in fact the remote universes. Our singing was now hushed into a
murmuring and wordless chant; for this comparatively simple yet
overwhelmingly significant percept of the night sky commands us all
with a power which might seem to you extravagant. It is, as it were,
the visible epitome of our whole thought and feeling. It has for us
more than the potency of your most venerated religious symbols. It
stirs not only the surface of our being but the ancestral depths, and
yet it is relevant to the most modern ventures of our intellect.</p>

<p>While we were still saluting with our voices and our spirits this
august and never-too-familiar presentation, the Mad Star rose once
more, and scattered its cold steel across the sea. We fell silent,
watching. Its dread effulgence extinguished the constellations.</p>

<p>Whether it was the influence of those barbarian melodies that we had
been savouring, or a mere flaw in my nature, I know not; but suddenly I
heard myself cry out. Hideous! That such a world as ours should be
burnt, wasted such a world of spirit and sweet flesh!'</p>

<p>She looked quickly in my eyes, with amazed laughter thrusting down
dismay. But before she could speak I saw rightly again. 'No!' I said,
not hideous, but terrible. Strange, how our thoughts can slip back for
a moment into the bad old ways, as though we were to lose sight of the
great beauty, and be like the blind spirits of the past.'</p>

<p>And she, 'When the end begins, shall we still see the great beauty?
Shall we see it even in the fire?'</p>

<p>And I, 'Who knows? But we see it now.'</p>

<p>Silently we watched the Star climb with increasing splendour of
violet and ultra-violet illumination. But at last we lay down together
in our sheltered grassy nest, and took intimate delight in one
another.</p>

<p>At dawn we rose. After a short swim, we put on our flying-suits,
those overalls studded with minute sources of sub-atomic energy on the
soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, and the whole front surface
of the body. It is with these that all lesser flights are performed in
our world; and as the action entails much skill and some muscular
exertion, it is a delight in itself. Side by side we climbed the air,
until the coast was like a map beneath us. We headed inland, first over
a wide tract of rock and prairie, marsh and scrub, then over corn and
orchard, sprinkled with innumerable homes. Once we passed near a great
building, whose crystal precipices towered over us with snow on their
cornices. A white cloud covered its upper parts, save for one slender
pinnacle, which tiptoed into the sunlight. Sometimes a flying-boat
would detach itself from the walls or emerge from the cloud. As we
travelled over more densely inhabited regions, sprinkled somewhat more
closely with private houses and cottages, a more numerous swarm of
these flying-boats continually passed over our heads in all directions
from horizon to horizon at so great a speed that they seemed darting
insects. We encountered also many fliers like ourselves. Many we saw
beneath us, moving from house to house across the intervening tillage.
At one point an arm of the sea lay across our route; and there we saw,
entering dock, a five-mile long ether-ship, lately returned from
Jupiter or Uranus with a cargo of foodstuffs. She was a great fish of
stainless metal, studded with windows over her back and flanks. Hidden
under water also there would be windows; for this seemingly marine
monster could rise like cormorant, with a great churning of the ocean,
to find herself within a few minutes surrounded above and below by
stars.</p>

<p>At noon we reached another wild district, and took our meal near a
warren of creatures which I can best describe as Neptunian rabbits. The
form of these furry descendants of an extinct human species was chiefly
determined, as so often with our fauna, by gravity. For support they
use, not only their short thick legs, but also their leathern bellies
and tails. No sooner had we sat down to eat than these mammalian
lizards crowded round us in the hope of titbits, One of them actually
made off with a loaf; but before he could reach his earth I captured
him, and administered such punishment that henceforth the whole tribe
treated us with more respect.</p>

<p>When our meal was over, we took leave of one another. It was a gay,
grave parting; for we knew that we might not meet again for thousands
of years, perhaps not before the sun, infected by the Mad Star, should
already have begun the destruction of our beloved world. When we had
looked in one another's eyes for a long moment, we buckled on our
flying-suits once more; then, in opposite directions, we climbed the
air. By dawn next day we had to be at our appointed stations, far
asunder on the great planet's surface, to participate in the Racial
Awakening, the sublime event to which every adult person on the planet
must needs contribute.</p>

<h3>ii. MEN AND MAN</h3>

<p>When an attempt is to be made to call the Race Mind into being, all
adult persons on the planet seek their allotted places near one or
other of a number of great towers which are scattered throughout the
continents. After a preparatory phase, in which much telepathic
intercourse occurs between individuals and between the group minds of
various orders which now begin to emerge, there comes a supreme moment,
when, if all goes well, every man and woman in the world-wide multitude
of multitudes awakes, as it were, to become the single Mind of the
Race, possessing the million bodies of all men and women as a man's
mind possesses the multitude of his body's cells.</p>

<p>Had you been privileged to watch from the summit of the great needle
of masonry round which I and so many others had gathered on that
morning, you would have seen far below, at the foot of the twenty-mile
high architectural precipice, and stretching to the horizon in every
direction, a featureless grey plain, apparently a desert. Had you then
used a powerful field-glass, you would have discovered that the plain
was in fact minutely stippled with microscopic dots of brown, separated
by almost invisible traces of green. Had you then availed yourself of a
much more powerful telescope, you would have found, with amazement,
that each of these brown dots was in fact a group of persons. The whole
plain would have been revealed as no mere desert, but a prodigious host
of men and women, gathered into little companies between which the
green grass showed. The whole texture of the earth would have appeared
almost like some vegetable tissue seen through the microscope, or the
cellular flesh of Leviathan. Within each cell you might have counted
ninety-six granules, ninety-six minute sub-cellular organs, in fact
ninety-six faces of men and women. Of these small marriage groups which
are the basis of our society, I have spoken elsewhere, and shall say no
more now. Suffice it that you would have found each dot to be not a
face, but a group of faces. Everywhere you would have seen faces turned
towards the tower, and motionless as grains of sand. Yet this host was
one of thousands such, scattered over all the continents.</p>

<p>A still more powerful telescope would have shown that we were all
standing, each with a doffed flying-suit hanging over an arm or
shoulder. As you moved the telescope hither and thither you would have
discovered our great diversity. For though we are all of one species,
it is a species far more variable even than your domestic dog; and our
minds are no less diverse than our bodies. Nearly all of us, you would
have noted, were unclad; but a few were covered with their own velvet
fur. The great majority of the Last Men, however, are hairless, their
skins brown, or gold, or black, or grey, or striped, or mottled. Though
you would recognize our bodies as definitely human, you would at the
same time be startled by the diversity of their forms, and by their
manifold aberrations from what you regard as the true human type. You
would notice in our faces and in the moulding of our limbs a strong
suggestion of animal forms; as though here a horse, there a tiger, and
there some ancient reptile, had been inspired with a human mind in such
a manner that, though now definitely man or woman, it remained
reminiscent of its animal past. You would be revolted by this animal
character of ours. But we, who are so securely human, need not shrink
from being animal too. In you, humanity is precarious; and so, in dread
and in shame, you kill the animal in you. And its slaughter poisons
you.</p>

<p>Your wandering telescope would have revealed us as one and all in
the late spring or full summer of life. Infants had been left behind
for the day in the automatic creches; children were at large in their
own houses; the youths and girls were living their wild romantic lives
in the Land of the Young. And though the average age of the host
gathered below you was many thousands of years, not one of its members
would have appeared to you aged. Senility is unknown among us.</p>

<p>Regarding us in the mass, you would have found it hard to believe
that each human atom beneath you was in reality a unique and highly
developed person, who would judge the immature personality of your Own
species as you judge your half-human progenitors. Careful use of the
telescope, however, would have revealed the light of intense and unique
consciousness in every face. For every member of this great host had
his peculiar and subtle character, his rich memories, his loves and
aims, and his special contribution to our incredibly complex society.
Farmers and gardeners, engineers and architects, chemists and
sub-atomic physicists, biologists, psychologists and eugenists, stood
together with creative artists of many kinds, with astronomers,
philosophers, historians, explorers of the past, teachers, professional
mothers, and many more whose work has no counterpart in your world.
There would be also, beside the more permanent denizens of Neptune, a
sprinkling of ethereal navigators, whose vessels happened to be on the
home-planet, and even a few pioneers from the settlements on Uranus and
Pluto. The ethereal navigators who ply between the planets are our only
transport-workers. Passenger traffic on the home-planet takes place
entirely in private air-boats or flying-suits. Freight travels
automatically in subterranean tubes, some of which, suitably
refrigerated, take direct routes almost through the heart of the
planet. Industry and commerce, such as you know, have no
representatives among us, for in our world there is nothing like your
industrial system. Our industry has neither operatives nor magnates. In
so far as manufacture is a routine process, it is performed by
machinery which needs no human influence but the pressing of a button.
In so far as it involves innovation, it is the work of scientists and
engineers. In so far as it involves organization, it is controlled by
the professional organizers. As for commerce, we have no such thing,
because we have no buying and no selling. Both production and
distribution are regulated by the organizers, working under the Supreme
College of Unity. This is in no sense a governing body, since its work
is purely advisory; but owing to our constant telepathic intercourse,
its recommendations are always sane, and always persuasive.
Consequently, though it has no powers of compulsion, it is the great
co-ordinator of our whole communal life. In the crowd beneath you many
members of this Supreme College would be present; but nothing would
distinguish them from members of the other and equally honourable
professions.</p>

<p>If you had watched us for long enough, you would have noticed, after
some hours of stillness, a shimmering change in the grey plain, a
universal stirring, which occurred at the moment of the awakening of
the Racial Mind throughout the whole population of the planet. The
telescope would have revealed that all the faces, formerly placid, were
suddenly illuminated with an expression of tense concentration and
triumph. For now at last each one of us was in the act of emerging into
the higher self-hood, to find himself the single and all-embracing mind
of a world.</p>

<p>At that moment, I, Man, perceived, not merely the multitudinous
several perceptions of all men and women on the face of the planet, but
the single significance of all those perceptions. Through the feet of
all individuals I grasped my planet, as a man may hold a ball in his
hand. Possessing all the memories of all men and women, not merely as
memory but as direct experience of the present. I perceived the whole
biography of my generation, nay, of my species, as you perceive a
melody, in flux yet all of it 'now'. I perceived the planets whirling
round the sun, and even the fixed stars creeping about the sky like
insects. But also at will I perceived movements within the atoms, and
counted the pulsations of light Waves. I possessed also all the
emotions and desires of all men and women. I observed them inwardly, as
a man may introspect his own delighting and grieving; but I observed
them dispassionately. I was present in the loving of all lovers, and
the adventuring of all who dare. I savoured all victories and defeats,
all imaginings and reasonings. But from all these teeming experiences
of my tiny members I held myself in detachment, turning my attention to
a sphere remote from these, where I, Man, experienced my own grave
desires and fears, and pursued my own high reasoning and contemplation
of what it was that then occupied me, the Mind of the Race, it is
impossible for me, the little individual who is now communicating with
you, to say anything definite. For these experiences lie beyond the
understanding of any individual. But this at least may be said. Waking
into this lofty experience, and looking down upon my individual members
as a man may regard the cells of his flesh, I was impressed far more by
my littleness than by my greatness. For in relation to the whole of
things I saw myself to be a very minute, simple, and helpless being,
doomed to swift destruction by the operation of a stellar event whose
meaning remained unintelligible to me, even upon my new and lofty plain
of understanding. But even the little individual who is now
communicating with you can remember that, when I, Man, faced this doom,
I was in no manner dismayed by it. I accepted it with exultation, as an
evident beauty within the great beauty of the whole. For my whole
experience was transfused and glorified by the perception of that
all-embracing and terrible beauty. Even on that loftier plane of my
being I did but glimpse it; but what I glimpsed I contemplated with an
insight and a rapture impossible in my lowlier mode of being.</p>

<p>Had you remained upon the tower until the following morning, you
would have seen, shortly after sunrise, the whole plain stir again. We
were preparing to go. Presently it would have seemed to you that the
surface of the planet was detaching itself and rising, like dust on a
wind-swept road, or steam from hot water, or like a valley cloud seen
from a mountain-top, and visibly boiling upwards. Higher and higher it
would have risen toward you, presently to resolve itself even for the
naked eye into a vast smoke of individual men and women. Soon you would
have seen them all around you and above you, swimming in the air with
outspread arms, circling, soaring, darkening the sky. After a brief
spell of random and ecstatic flight, they would have been observed
streaming away in all directions to become a mere haze along the
horizon. Looking down, you would now have seen that the grey plain had
turned to green, fading in the distance into blues and purples.</p>

<p>The dispersal of the gatherings does not put an end to the racial
experience. For an indefinite period of months or years each
individual, though he goes his own way, living his own life and
fulfilling his special function in the community, remains none the less
possessed by the race mind. Each perceives, thinks, strives as an
individual; but also he is Man, perceiving racially, and thinking in
manners wholly impossible in the humbler mode of being. As each cell in
a brain lives its own life, yet participates in the experience of the
whole brain, so we. But after a while the great being sleeps again.</p>

<p>After the awakening which I have just described the racial mentality
endured for many years; but one class of individuals had perforce to
refrain from any further participation in it, namely those who were to
engage upon exploration of the past. For this work it is necessary, for
reasons which I shall explain later, to cut off all telepathic
communication with one's fellows, and consequently to leave the
telepathic system in which the Race Mind inheres. Yet it was expressly
to further our work that this particular awakening had been ordained.
It was to strengthen us for our adventures. For my part, as I hastened
first to my home and thence through the upper air in my flying-boat
toward the Arctic, I felt that I had been kindled with an
inextinguishable flame; and that though I must henceforth be exiled
from the lofty experience of the Race Mind, I had acquired a new
fervour and clarity of vision which would enable me to observe your
world with finer insight than on my earlier visits.</p>

<h3>iii. BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h3>

<p>At this point it seems desirable to say a few words about myself, so
that you may have some idea of the kind of being who is communicating
with you, and the angle from which he is regarding you.</p>

<p>I am at present twenty thousand years old according to your
Terrestrial reckoning, and therefore I am still in the spring-time of
my life. My parents were chosen for me. They had long been intimate
with one another, but the call to have a child arose from the knowledge
that there was need of such a being as they together could produce.
Recent improvements in man's powers of entering into past minds,
together with the new urgency for completing the exploration of the
past before our own world should be destroyed, had increased the call
for past-explorers. For such a career I was destined even before I was
conceived; and while I was still in the womb, the eugenists were still
influencing me so as to give me novel powers.</p>

<p>During infancy I remained with my mother. Throughout my life I have
retained a closer intimacy with her than is common in my world; for
with her tenderness and strange innocent ruthlessness she embodies for
me the very spirit of the past and the primitive. And these have
enthralled me always. Not that in your eyes she would have seemed
primitive; but underlying all her reasonableness and sophistication I
detect that savage temperament which, perhaps partly because of my own
extreme sophistication, I so enjoy in others.</p>

<p>I spent my thousand years of childhood in the manner characteristic
of my race. Mostly I lived in a children's residential club. We managed
it with more dash than efficiency; but in intervals between domestic
duties, games, quarrels and sentimental attachments, we managed to lay
the foundations of our education. Even at this early stage my
predisposition toward the primitive and the past was beginning to wake.
While others were making toy ether-ships and model planetary systems, I
was digging for fossils, haunting museums, brooding on ancient
folklore, and writing histories of imaginary past worlds. In all my
recreations and in all my studies this interest was ever apt to
insinuate itself.</p>

<p>My second thousand years was spent, as is customary with us, in the
reserved continent called the Land of the Young. There our young people
sow their wild oats by living as savages and barbarians. During this
phase they are definitely juvenile in disposition. They appreciate only
such barbarian virtues as were admired even by the most primitive human
species. They are capable of loyalty, but only by an uneasy and heroic
victory over self-regard. Their loyalties are never easeful, for they
have not yet developed the self-detachment of the adult. Further, they
care only for the beauties of triumphant individual life. The supernal
beauties of the cosmos, which form the main preoccupation of grown men
and women, are hidden from these young things. Consequently our adult
world lies very largely beyond their comprehension.</p>

<p>For some centuries I gave myself wholly to a 'Red Indian' life,
becoming a master of the bow and arrow, and a really brilliant tracker.
I remember too that I fell in love with a dangerous young Amazon with
golden hair. My first encounter with her was warlike. She escaped, but
left her javelin in my shoulder, and her presence in my heart. Long
afterwards, when we were both in the adult world, I met her again. She
had by now entered upon her career, having been chosen as one of our
professional mothers. Later still, she volunteered to submit to a very
dangerous maternity experiment, and was so shattered by it, that the
eugenists had finally to put her to death.</p>

<p>I had not been many centuries in the Land of the Young before my
master passion began to assert itself. I set about collecting material
for a complete history of that juvenile world. For this end I sampled
every kind of life in every corner of the continent. I also sharpened
my perception, or so I persuaded myself, by intimacy with many
resplendent young women. But long before I had completed my history,
the work began to be interrupted by visits to the adult world.</p>

<p>There is a party in the Land of the Young who preach that the
juvenile world is happier and nobler than the world of the adults. They
send missionaries among those whom they know to be turning from the
primitive, and seek to persuade them to join a small and pathetic band
called the Old Young, who elect to remain in the Land of the Young for
ever. These poor arrested beings become the guardians of tradition and
morality among the nations of the Young. Like the village idiot, they
are despised even while at the same time their sayings are supposed to
be pregnant with mysterious truth. I myself, with my taste for the past
and the primitive, was persuaded to take the vow of this order. But
when I was introduced to one of these bright old things, I was so
depressed that I recanted. It came as a revelation to me that my task
was not actually to become primitive, but to study the primitive. It
was borne in on me that even the past and the primitive can be
understood and loved better by the full-grown mind than by the
primitive itself.</p>

<p>During their last century in the Land of the Young our boys and
girls normally develop beyond the larval stage very rapidly, though not
without severe mental agony. For during this period the mind is in
bitter conflict with itself. It clings to the primitive, but is at the
same time nauseated; it yearns toward the mature, but is at the same
time fearful and reluctant. This profound metamorphosis of body and
mind continues for some centuries even after the young person has
entered the adult world. The simple male or female sexual characters
specialize themselves into one or other of the ninety-six sub-sexes.
Intelligence soars into a new order of proficiency. New centres of the
brain integrate the nervous system so perfectly that henceforth
behaviour will be, without exception, and without serious struggle,
rational; or, as you would say, moral. At the same time the faculty of
telepathic communication appears; and, through the cumulative effect of
constant telepathic intercourse, the mind comes into such exact
understanding and vivid sympathy with other minds, that the diversity
of all serves but to enhance the mental richness of each.</p>

<p>This radical change of nature, which raises the individual in a few
centuries to a new plane of experience, was for me the more torturing
because of my innate hunger for the primitive. This same characteristic
made it difficult for me to reconcile myself to the highly complex
adult sexual life of my species, which is based on the marriage group
of the ninety-six sub-sexes. My group formed itself with unusual
difficulty; but, once constituted, it was maintained without undue
emphasis. Only once in a century or so are we moved to come together,
and live together, and love together; and then only for about a year.
During these periods we take delicate joy in one another, and in
ourselves. And though we remain self-conscious individuals, a single
group-self emerges in us. We spend much of our time rapt in the
perceptions and thoughts which are possible only to the minds of the
sexual groups; brooding especially on the subtleties of personality and
super-personality, and preparing the ground for the recurrent phases of
that far more complex mode of consciousness, the Mind of the Race.
Apart from these occasional periods of group-mentality, each of us
lives an independent life, and is only obscurely conscious of his
group-membership. Nevertheless, much as, after swimming, a freshness
may vaguely cheer the body for the rest of the day, or after sunbathing
a tingling beatitude, so for each of us participation in the group
affords an enhanced vitality which may endure for many decades.</p>

<p>When I had settled into my sexual group, I was about three thousand
years old. My body had attained that youthful maturity which with us is
perennial, and my mind had shed all the follies of the Land of the
Young. I was apprenticed to work which was perfectly suited to my
nature. It was exacting work, for the novel powers with which I was
endowed were as yet imperfectly understood. But my working hours would
have seemed ridiculously short even in your most ardent
trade-unionists. Only for a few years in every century was my mind
actually absent from the contemporary world. Only for a decade or two
would I devote my mornings to formulating the results of my research.
Though inevitably the past, and my study of the past, would be nearly
always in my thoughts, the great bulk of my time was occupied with
other activities. For decade after decade I would merely watch the
manifold operations of our great community, wandering into all
countries, seeking intimacy with all sorts of persons, peering through
microscopes and astronomical instruments, watching the birth of
inventions in other minds, studying the eugenists' plans for new
generations, or the latest improvements in ethereal navigation. Much of
my time was spent in ether-ships, much in the Uranian colonies, much in
the interior of the mine-honeycombed Pluto. Sometimes I would go as a
guest into the Land of the Young to spend years in comparing our own
young things with the primitive races of the past. Occasionally I have
been chiefly concerned for a decade at a time with the appreciation or
practice of some creative art, most often with our supreme art, which I
must reluctantly call 'telepathic verse'. Somewhat as auditory verse
uses sound, this most subtle of all arts uses our direct sensitivity to
ethereal vibrations for the evocation of rhythms and patterns of
sensory images and ideas. Sometimes, on the other hand, I have been
absorbed in some special problem of natural science, and have done
little but follow the experiments of scientific workers. Much of my
time, of course, has been given to cosmology, and much to metaphysics;
for in my world these subjects compel the attention of every man and
woman. Sometimes for a year or so I would do little but rebuild my
house or cultivate my garden; or I would become wholly absorbed in the
invention or construction of some toy for a child friend. Sometimes my
main preoccupation for several years has been intimacy with some woman,
of my own nation or another. It must be confessed that I am more
disposed to this kind of refreshment than most of my fellows. But I do
not regret it. In these many brief lyrical matings of body and mind I
seem to experience in a very special manner that which unites the
developed and the primitive. Now and then, like most of my fellows, I
spend a decade or so in lonely wandering, giving myself wholly to the
sensuous and instinctive life. It was on one of these occasions that I
first met the translucent woman whom I have called Panther. Many have I
loved; but with her, whom I meet only in the wilderness, I have a very
special relation. For whereas my spirit turns ever to the past, hers
turns to the future; and each without the other is an empty thing.</p>

<p>This great freedom and variety of life, and this preponderance of
leisure over work, are characteristic of my world. The engineer, the
chemist, even the agriculturist and the ethereal navigator, spend less
time at their own special tasks than in watching the lives of others.
Indeed it is only by means of this system of mutual observation,
augmented by our constant telepathic intercourse, that we can preserve
that understanding of one another which is the life-blood of our
community. In your world this perfect accord of minds is impossible.
Yet your differences of racial temperament and of acquired bias are as
nothing beside the vast diversity of innate disposition which is at
once our constant danger and our chief strength.</p>

<p>From the time when I had reached full maturity of mind, and had
become expert in my special calling, up to my present age of twenty
thousand Years, my life has been even, though eventful. I have of
course had my difficulties and anxieties, my griefs and my triumphs. I
lost my two closest friends in an ether-ship disaster. Another friend,
younger than myself, has developed in such a strange manner that,
though I do my best to understand him telepathically, I cannot but feel
that he is seriously abnormal, and will sooner or later either come to
grief or achieve some novel splendour. This has been my most serious
anxiety apart from my work.</p>

<p>Work has been by far the most important factor in my life.
Peculiarly gifted by inheritance, I have co-operated with the equally
gifted fellow-workers of my generation to raise the art of past
exploration to a new range of power. My novitiate was spent in studying
one of the earlier Neptunian civilizations. Since then I have acquired
considerable first-hand knowledge of every one of the eighteen human
species. In addition I have specialized in some detail on the Venetian
Flying Men and the Last Terrestrials. But the great bulk of my work has
been done among the First Men, and upon the particular crisis which you
can present.</p>

<p>Apart from the exigencies of my work, two events have produced
profound changes in my life; but they were events of public rather than
private significance, and have affected the whole race with equal
urgency. One was the first occasion on which we awakened into the
racial mentality. The other was the discovery of the Mad Star, and of
the doom of our world. For all of us these two great happenings have
changed a life of serenely victorious enterprise into something more
mysterious, more pregnant, and more tragic.</p>

<h3>i. THE PORTAL TO THE PAST</h3>

<p>IT was with an overwhelming sense of the mystery and formidable
beauty of existence that I hastened, after the racial awakening, toward
that Arctic settlement which we call the Portal to the Past. Travelling
now by flying-boat, I soon reached the icefields; and by noon the great
towers which marked my destination stood like bristles on the horizon.
Already I encountered many other boats and boatless flyers, bound for
the same goal. Presently I arrived, docked my little vessel in her
appointed garage, and entered the great white gate of the particular
tower which concerned me. Greeting some of my colleagues, I passed
through the entrance hall and stepped into one of the many lifts. In a
few moments I had sunk a thousand feet below the ground. I then
proceeded along a lofty and well-lit passage, in the walls of which
were doors, at intervals of a hundred yards. One of these I opened.
Within was a comfortable room, in which were chairs, a table,
cupboards, and a bed. At the far side of the room was a window, opening
from ceiling to ground, and beyond it a delightful sunny garden. How
could this be, you wonder, a thousand feet below ground? Had you walked
out into the garden, you would have seen that in the luminous blue
ceiling there blazed an artificial sun, and you would have felt a
refreshing breeze, which issued from among the bushes.</p>

<p>Behind every one of the doors in the many underground passages you
would have found similar rooms and gardens, varying only in detail
according to the tastes of their occupiers. Such are the apartments
where we explorers of the past undertake our strange adventures. You
ask, why in the Arctic, why underground? Our work demands that the mind
shall be isolated from the contemporary human world; only in a remote
land, and beneath its surface, can we escape the telepathic influence
of the world-population. Our telepathic intercourse is based on the
transmission and reception of ethereal vibrations from brain to
brain.</p>

<p>Normally our powers of reception are kept under strict control, so
that we receive messages only when we will. But, in the peculiar trance
which is our medium for exploring the past, this control fails; so
that, unless the explorer is isolated, his mind is lashed like a pond
in which torrential rain is falling.</p>

<p>When I had entered my room and shut my door, I went out into my
garden and walked up and down for a while, preparing my mind for its
adventure. I then brought out from the room a drawer full of rolls of
microscopically figured tape, which in my world take the place of
books. In normal circumstances these little rolls work by
systematically interrupting the radiation of a special instrument. This
radiation penetrates the brain of the' reader', and is interpreted
telepathically by the telepathic organ of his brain. But since in the
catacombs no radiation other than the normal solar wave-lengths is
permitted, we explorers have to learn actually to read the rolls, with
the aid of a microscope.</p>

<p>I now spent many hours lying on the turf in the sunshine, reading
about the epoch which I was to visit. After a while I re-entered the
room and pressed a button in the wall. A tray appeared, bearing an
appetizing meal. When I had finished this, and dismissed the tray, I
returned to the garden and my studies. For a period equivalent to about
ten days I lived in this manner, studying, meditating, eating
occasionally, but sleeping not at all. Sometimes I would break off my
studies to tend my garden. Frequently I would swim about in the pond
among the bushes. But for the most part I merely browsed on my books or
on my own records of the past. Toward the end of this period of
preparation, I grew desperately sleepy. To keep myself awake, I had to
walk up and down more and more, and my dips in the pond became more
frequent. It was almost time to be gone. I drew my little bed out into
the garden and made it ready to receive me. I pressed another button,
which would make day slowly become night. I took a final dip and a
final walk, then staggered to my bed and lay down in the twilight.</p>

<p>But even yet I must not sleep. Instead, I concentrated my attention
on the recurrent rise and fall of my own breathing, and on the nature
of time. This process I had to maintain for about thirty hours, without
food or sleep or any respite. Toward the end of this period, had you
seen me, you would have said that I was at last falling asleep, and
finally you would have declared me to be in a very profound slumber.
And so in a manner I was, save that a single organ in my brain, usually
dormant, was now intensively active, and preparing to take possession
of my whole body as soon as my brain should have been refreshed by its
deep sleep. After a couple of days of unconsciousness I did indeed
wake, but not to the familiar surroundings.</p>

<p>For months, even years or decades, my body might now remain inert
upon its bed, save for periodic risings to perform its natural
functions of eating, drinking and excretion. Frequently also it would
walk for hours at a time in the garden or bathe in the pond. But these
activities would be carried out in complete abstraction, and had anyone
spoken to me at these times, I should have been unaware. For the higher
centres of my brain were wholly possessed by the past. To anyone
watching me during these routine activities, I should have appeared as
a sleep-walker. At these times, no less than during the long periods of
quiescence on my bed, the observer would have seen that my face, and
sometimes my whole body, was constantly influenced by emotion and
thought. For during the whole trance, of course, my brain would be
experiencing sequences of events in the remote past, and my whole body
would respond to these experiences with my normal emotional reactions.
Thus to the observer I should appear to be asleep and dreaming, save
that my expressions would be far more definite and systematic than
those of a dreamer.</p>

<p>Here I will mention one point of philosophical interest. The
duration of the trance has no relation to the duration of the past
events observed. Thus I might lie in my comfortable prison for a year,
and in that time I might observe many years of past events, or many
thousands of Years, or even the whole span of man's history. The length
of the trance depends only on the complexity of the matter observed. I
might for instance spend a year in observing an immense number of
simultaneous events which took only a few minutes to occur. Or I might
cover the whole life of one individual in far more detail than was
afforded by his own consciousness of his life story. Or I might sweep
through whole epochs, tracing out only some one simple thread of
change. In fact the length of the trance depends simply on the brain's
capacity to assimilate, not upon the actual duration of the events
observed.</p>

<p>When as much material has been gathered as can be conveniently
grasped, the explorer gradually withdraws his attention from the past.
He then sinks into an undisturbed sleep which may last for several
weeks. During this phase his body shows none of that ceaseless
emotional expression which is characteristic of the main trance. It
lies inert, as though stunned. Finally the explorer's attention begins
to concentrate itself again, and to revert once more to his own body
and its surroundings. He wakes, and lies for a while passively
accepting the new visual impressions. He then lives in his apartments
for months or years recording his experiences in rough notes, to be
organized at a later date. Sometimes, when this process is finished, he
chooses to return at once, without respite, to the past for further
data. Sometimes he leaves his room to confer with other workers.
Sometimes he decides to drop his work and return to the contemporary
world for refreshment.</p>

<h3>ii. DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS</h3>

<p>How it comes that at the moment of the onset of the trance the
explorer is freed from the limitations of his own date and place I
cannot tell you. Suffice it that the process involves both a special
organ in the brain and a special technique, which has to be learned
through a long apprenticeship. In that moment of awakening the worker
has seemingly a confused experience of all the great successive epochal
phases of the human spirit, up to his own date. But as the content of
that supreme moment almost wholly escapes his memory as soon as it is
past, it is impossible to say anything definite about it. He seems,
indeed, to see in a flash, as though from another dimension of time,
the whole historical order of events. Of course, he sees them only
schematically. Their vast complexity of detail cannot be grasped in an
instantaneous view. What he experiences can only be described
(unintelligibly I fear) as a summation of all happening, of all
physical, mental and spiritual flux. One is tempted to say also that he
is aware of the human aspect of this flux as a vast slumber of the
spirit, punctuated with moments of watchfulness, a vast stagnation
troubled here and there with tremors of tense activity. Though all this
is seen in an instant, it does not appear static, but alive with real
passage and change.</p>

<p>This sublime moment must not be permitted to endure, for it is
lethal. Immediately the explorer must begin to select that part of the
historical order which he desires to study. To do this he must adopt
the fundamental attitude of mind, or temperamental flavour, which he
knows to be distinctive of the desired period. This process demands
very great skill, and involves a host of uncouth and nerve-racking
experiences. As soon as he begins to succeed in assuming the
appropriate mental attitude, all the periods save that which he has
chosen fade out of his consciousness, and the chosen period becomes
increasingly detailed. He has then to specialize his mental attitude
still further, so as to select a particular phase or group-culture
within his period. And this specialization he may carry further again,
till he has brought himself into the mind of some particular individual
at a particular moment. Having once gained a footing in the individual
mind, he can henceforth follow all its experiences from within; or, if
he prefers, he can remain in one moment of that mind, and study its
microscopic detail.</p>

<p>Such is the essence of our method. First we have to attain the
momentary glimpse of eternity, or, more precisely, to take up for one
instant the point of view of eternity. Then by imagination and sympathy
we have to re-enter the stream of time by assuming the fundamental form
of the minds or the mind that we wish to observe. In this process we
have to work by means of a very delicate 'selectivity', not wholly
unlike that physical selectivity which you exercise when you pick up
ethereal messages on a particular wavelength. But this process of
picking up past minds is far more delicate, since the system of basic
mental patterns is very much more complex than the one-dimensional
series of wave-frequencies.</p>

<p>When our ancestors first acquired the power of 'entering into the
point of view of eternity' they suffered many disasters through
ignorance of its principles. Very many of the earliest explorers
succumbed simply by failing to keep their bodies alive during the
trance. Their sleep turned into death. Others fell into such violent
convulsions that they damaged themselves irreparably, and were
mercifully killed by the superintendents. In other cases the normal
trance lasted indefinitely, the body remaining alive but unresponsive
for millions of years. A section of the catacombs was until recently
filled with these persons, who were looked after by the attendants in
the hope that some day they might wake. But a few thousand years ago it
was decided to do away with some, and use others for experimental
purposes.</p>

<p>Of the early explorers who successfully emerged from 'the point of
view of eternity' into some past epoch, many returned insane. Others,
though sane when they woke, kept falling into the trance again and
again. Others were so embittered by their experiences that they became
plague-spots in the community, and had to be requested to stop their
hearts. Of these, some few refused, and remained at large, doing so
much damage that finally they were put to death. One or two of the
pioneers, and one or two of my contemporaries also, have returned from
the trance with a peculiar kind of insanity, which suggested that they
had actually found their way into the future, and that they still
regarded our contemporary world as an episode in the remote past.
Unfortunately they could give no account of their experiences; but in
one of the earliest cases the recorded ravings seem to refer to the Mad
Star, which did not earn its name until long afterwards.</p>

<p>In the early stages of the work few persons were engaged on it, and
all that they could do was to collect random incidents from the very
recent past. Gradually, however, the technique was greatly improved. It
became possible to inspect almost any sequence of events in the history
of our own species. This could only be done because the basic mental
patterns of all the races of our own species had already been fairly
well worked out by our psychologists and historians. Later, however,
the psychologists began to formulate a vast theoretical system of
possible basic mental patterns; and after some barren experimenting the
explorers finally learned to assume certain of these patterns in the
trance. The result was startling. Not only did they, as was expected,
gain access to many primitive cultures upon Neptune, but also they
began to find themselves sometimes in alien worlds, apparently much
smaller than their familiar planet. The proportions of common things
were all altered. The seas rose into great waves; the lands were often
buckled into huge mountain ranges. The native organisms, though
unfortified by artificial atoms, were able to attain great size and yet
remain slender and agile. And these facts were observed through the
medium of human types the existence of which had never been guessed.
The very planets which these races inhabited could not be identified.
No wonder, since all traces of Earth and Venus had long ago been wiped
out by the solar collision that had driven man to Neptune.</p>

<p>This discovery of Past worlds Was even more exciting to us than the
discovery of America to your own ancestors; for it entailed
incidentally the overthrow of a well-grounded theory, which traced the
evolution of the human race to a primitive Neptunian organism. Interest
in the exploration of the past now greatly increased. The technique was
developed far beyond the dreams of the early explorers. Little by
little the outline of man's whole history on Earth and Venus Was
plotted, and tract after tract of it was elaborated in some detail.</p>

<p>In observing these extinct species, the explorers found traces of
experience very different from their own. Although, of course, the
basic mental pattern or temperamental ground-plan was in every case one
which the explorer himself had been able to conceive, and even in a
manner assume, in order to make contact with these primitive beings at
all, yet when the contact had been made, he seemed to enter into a new
mental world. For instance, he had to deal with minds whose sensory
powers were much more limited than his own. Looking through those
Primitive eyes, he saw things in much less detail than through his own
eyes, so that, though he observed everything with all the precision
that his host's crude vision could afford, yet everything seemed to him
blurred, and out of focus. The colours of objects, too, were diluted
and simplified; for several colours familiar to us are hidden from more
primitive eyes. Consequently the world as seen through those eyes
appears to us at first strangely drab, almost monochromatic, as though
the observer himself had become partially colour-blind. The other
senses also are impoverished. For instance, all touched shapes and
textures seem curiously vague and muffled. The sensations of sexual
intercourse, too, which with us are richly variegated and expressive,
are reduced in the primitive to a nauseating sameness and formlessness.
It is impossible for you to realize the jarring, maddening effects of
this coarseness and emptiness of all the sensory fields, especially to
the inexperienced explorer, who has not yet learned to submit his
spirit generously to the primitive.</p>

<p>In the sphere of thought, we find all the primitive species of man,
however different from one another, equally remote from ourselves. Even
the most advanced members of the most advanced primitive species
inhabit worlds of thought which to us seem naive and grotesque. The
explorer finds himself condemned to cramp the wings of his mind within
the caging of some gimcrack theory or myth, which, if he willed, he
could easily shatter. Even in those rare cases in which the ground-plan
of some edifice of primitive thought happens to be true to the simplest
basic facts of the cosmos, as in your own theory of relativity, the
superstructure which it ought to support is wholly absent. The explorer
thus has the impression that the cosmos, with himself in it, has been
flattened into a two-dimensional map.</p>

<p>In the sphere of desire the explorer has to deal with very
unfamiliar and very jarring kinds of experience. In all human species,
of course, the most fundamental animal desires are much the same, the
desires for safety, food, a mate, and companionship; but the kind of
food, the kind of companionship, and so on, which the primitive human
mind seeks, are often very foreign and distasteful to us. Take the case
of food. Of course the explorer's body, lying in the catacombs on
Neptune, does not, if perchance he is inhabiting some primitive glutton
of the past, suffer dyspepsia; save occasionally, through the influence
of suggestion. But none the less he may experience acute distress, for
his brain is forced to accept sensory complexes of overeating which in
normal life would disgust him. And they disgust him now. Even when
overeating does not occur, the food percepts are often repulsive to our
centres of taste and odour. In the matter of personal beauty, too, the
explorer is at first repelled by the grotesque caricature of humanity
which among primitive species passes for perfection, much as you
yourselves may be repelled by the too-human animality of apes. Often,
when he is following the growth of some primitive love-sentiment in
your epoch, he is nauseated by the adored object, and by the intimacy
in which he is reluctantly entangled. It is much as though a part of
the mind were to watch the other part entrapped into romantic adoration
of a female ape; as if with infinite disgust one were to find himself
pressing against those hairy thighs. But indeed in this matter, as in
others, since it is not mere animality that disgusts, but the failure
to be human, the explorer is far more outraged than if he were
compelled to cohabit with an ape. With familiarity, however, these
repulsions can be surmounted. Just as your disgust of the ape's
approximation to the human is a weakness in you, due to lack of vision
and sympathy, so our tendency to a disgust of your own crude
approximation to the human is a weakness in us, which we have to learn
to transform into a reverent, though often ironical, sympathy. Just as
the surgeon may become accustomed to delving among viscera, and may
even find beauty in them, so the explorer may and must accustom himself
to all these primitive forms, and find beauty in them too. Of course
the beauty which he discovers in the adored yet repulsive ape-woman is
never simply identical with the beauty which delights the adoring
ape-man; for it is a beauty which includes within itself both that
which delights the primitive and that which disgusts the developed
mind.</p>

<p>To all the preoccupations then, and to all the ways of life, and all
the ideals, of the early races, the explorer must react with that
delight which triumphs over contempt and disgust. Of course there is
very much in this sphere which he can whole-heartedly enjoy, since much
in primitive life is the unspoiled behaviour of the animal, and much
also improves upon the animal. But at a very early stage primitive man
begins to torture his own nature into grotesque forms, inadvertently or
by intent; much as, inadvertently, he tortures his domestic animals,
and by intent he turns his pets into freaks and caricatures. This
violation of his own nature increases as he gains power, and reaches
its height in primitive industrial communities such as your own. In
such phases the individual body and spirit become more and more
distorted, impoverished, noisome. The early explorer, studying these
phases, was hard put to it to prevent his overwhelming indignation and
nausea from spoiling his study. He had, of course, to observe it all as
though it were happening to himself, since he observed it through the
suffering minds of its victims. And so he was almost in the position of
a sick doctor, whose spirit must triumph by delighting in the study of
his own disease.</p>

<p>Grotesque sentiments such as the lust of business success or
economic power of any kind, and indeed every purely self-regarding
passion, from that of the social climber to that of the
salvation-seeking ascetic, are experienced by the explorer with
something of that shame which the child, emerging into adolescence, may
feel toward the still-clinging fascination of his outgrown toys, or
with such disgust as the youth may feel when he wakes from some
unworthy sexual infatuation. But this shame and disgust the explorer
must learn to transcend as the surgeon the disgust of blood. Even the
passions of hate and gratuitous cruelty, so widespread in your own and
all other primitive species, he must learn to accept with sympathy, in
spite of his spontaneous revulsion from them and his well-justified
moral condemnation of them.</p>

<p>One great difference between ourselves and most primitive minds is
that, while in us all motives are fully conscious, fully open to
introspection, in them scarcely any of their more complex motives are
ever brought fully to light. Thus when the explorer is following some
train of action in a primitive mind, he very often observes an immense
discrepancy between the mind's own view of its motives and the real
motives which he himself sees to be in fact the source of the activity.
To experience all the daily and hourly perversities of a life-long
complex, to experience them not merely through clinical observation but
in the most intimate manner, puts him to an extremely severe strain. At
every turn his own mind is wrenched by the conflict in the mind that he
is observing. And in him the conflict is wholly conscious and
shattering. Not a few of our early observers became infected by the
disorder which they had been studying, so that when they returned to
their native world they could no longer behave with perfect sanity, and
had to be destroyed.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, the earlier explorers were often desperately
fatigued by the monotony of primitive existence and the sameness of
primitive minds; and also they fell into disgust, an agony of disgust,
with the crudity, insensitivity and folly of the primitive. From the
one point of view it might be said that the Neptunian found himself
condemned to sift the almost identical sand-grains of a desert, and
even to record the minute distinctive features of each grain. From the
other point of view, it was as though he had been banished from the
adult world to the nursery or the jungle, and was actually imprisoned
in the mind of babe or beast. For, once settled in the mind which he
has chosen to study, the explorer is indeed a captive until study calls
him elsewhere. Though he thinks his own thoughts, he perceives only
what the other perceives, and is forced to endure every least
sensation, thought, desire and emotion of the other, be it never so
banal. Like one who feels within his own mind the beginnings of some
mania or obsession which, though he recognizes that it is irrational or
base, he cannot control, so the explorer is doomed to experience
sympathetically all his subject's thinking and desiring, even while he
is nauseated by it. No wonder, then, that many early explorers were
tortured by disgust or ennui.</p>

<p>Long before my time, most of these dangers and irks of exploration
had been greatly reduced. One serious trouble, however, remains, and
has even increased. A great army of workers was of course bred with
special aptitudes for supra-temporal experience, and with special
insight into the primitive types of mind. These new workers were given
also a special enthusiasm and sympathy in respect of the past; and
herein lay their danger. In my day every member of the race has
something of this enthusiasm and sympathy; and we explorers have them
in an extreme degree. So enthralling do we find the past, even in all
its monotony and squalor, that many have succumbed to its spell, and
lost all footing in the present world. Rapt in some great movement of
history, or in some individual life-story, the explorer may lose,
little by little, all memory of the future world of which he is a
native, may in fact cease to be a future mind inspecting a past mind,
and become instead a mere undertone or freakish propensity in the past
mind itself, or in many Past minds. In time even this may vanish, so
that the explorer becomes identical with the explored. If this occurs,
his own body, situated in the future and in Neptune, gradually
disintegrates and dies.</p>

<p>Certain other troubles hamper even the most modern explorers, in
spite of improved technique. The method by which we enter a past epoch
is, as I have said, this process of shaping our minds to the basic
pattern or ground tone of the epoch to be studied. But when the
explorer desires to enter a particular individual, he must try to
assume the complex form or temperament which is distinctive of that
individual; or else he must seize on one unique desire or thought,
which he supposes to be peculiar to that individual at a certain date
of his life. Now this process of mental infection or association does
not necessarily work in his favour. Often, when he is trying to
establish himself in some mind, or even when he has long been
established, some chance association in his own thought-process may
suddenly snatch him away from the object of his study and fling him
into some other mind. Sometimes this other is a contemporary of the
recent object of study; but often it is a mind in some different epoch
or world. When this happens, not only is the study broken short, but
also the explorer may be very seriously damaged. His brain, on Neptune,
suffers such a fundamental and rapid readjustment that it is grievously
jarred and strained, and may never recover. Even if he does not
actually succumb, he may have to take a long holiday for recuperation.
Fortunately, however, it is only the more extravagant dislocations that
are really dangerous. Occasional jolts into minds of the same basic
pattern as the original object of study are more exasperating than
harmful.</p>

<p>Often when the explorer is resident in a particular individual he
encounters through that individual's perception another individual,
who, he thinks, would repay immediate study. He has then to observe
this other carefully through the perceptions of the first, so as to
discover, if possible, some entry into his mind. This may be very
difficult, since one primitive mind's awareness of another is often so
erroneous and biased that the perceptions which would make for true
understanding of the other fail to occur. Moreover there is always the
danger that, when the explorer attempts this 'change of mounts' he may
fall between them, and be flung violently once more into his native
location in time and space. Or again, he may at the critical moment be
snatched by some chance association into some other epoch or world.
Such accidents are of course very damaging, and may prove fatal.</p>

<p>Here I may mention that some minds, scattered up and down the ages,
defeat all attempts to enter them. They are very rare, only one in
millions of millions; but they are such as we should most desire to
enter. Each one of these rare beings has caused the ruin of a great
company of our most able explorers. They must be in some vital respect
alien to us, so that we cannot assume their nature accurately enough to
enter them. Possibly they are themselves subject to an influence future
even to us. Possibly they are possessed and subtly transformed by minds
native to some world in a remote stellar system. Possibly, even, they
are under the direct influence of the cosmical mind, which, we hope,
will awaken in the most remote of all futures.</p>

<p>Explorers of the past incur one other danger which I may mention.
Sometimes the past individual under observation dies suddenly, before
the explorer can foresee the death, and free himself. In many cases, of
course, he knows the date at which the other's death will occur, and
can therefore, having prepared himself for a normal departure, observe
the course of events right up to the moment of death, and yet escape
before it is too late. But sometimes, especially in pioneering in some
unexplored region of history, the explorer is as ignorant of the
immediate future as the observed mind itself.. In such cases a dagger,
a bullet, a flash of lightning, even an unforeseen heart-failure, may
fling him back to his own world with a shattering jerk, which may
irreparably damage his brain, or even kill him outright. Many of the
early observers of your recent European War were caught in this manner.
Resident in the mind of some soldier in action, the observer himself
was annihilated by the shell that destroyed the observed. If burial
were one of our practices, we, like you, might have our war graves of
1914 to 1918, though they would not have been dug till two thousand
million years later. Nor would they be decorated by national emblems.
Nor would they bear the cross.</p>

<h3>iii. INFLUENCING PAST MINDS</h3>

<p>Our power of taking effect on past minds is much more restricted
than our power of passively observing their processes. It is also a
much more recent acquisition. To you it seems impossible; for future
events, you suppose, have no being whatever until their predecessors
have already ceased to exist. I can only repeat that, though future
events have indeed no temporal being until their predecessors have
ceased to exist with temporal being, all events have also eternal
being. This does not mean that time is unreal, but that evanescence is
not the whole truth about the passing of events. Now some minds, such
as ours, which are to some extent capable of taking up the point of
view of eternity, and of experiencing the eternal aspects of past
events in other minds, can also to some extent contribute to the
experience of those minds in the past. Thus when I am observing your
mental processes, my activity of observing is, in one sense, located in
the past. Although it is carried out from the point of view of my own
experience in the future, it enters the past through the eternal side
of past events in your minds. When I act upon your minds, as for
instance in inculcating thoughts and images in the writer of this book,
that activity of mine is located in your age. Yet it is done, so to
speak, from my purchase in the future, and with all my Neptunian
experience in view.</p>

<p>From this rare but important action of the future on the past it
follows that past events, which themselves cause future events, are in
part the product of future events. This may seem unintelligible. But in
fact there is no more mystery in it than in the reciprocal interaction
of two minds that know one another. The one, which owes its form partly
to the other, is itself one factor determining the other's form.</p>

<p>As I said before, the only way in which we can influence a past mind
is by suggesting in that mind some idea or desire, or other mental
event, which is intelligible to a mind of that particular order, and is
capable of being formulated in terms of its own experience. Some minds
are much more receptive than others. The great majority are wholly
impervious to our influence; and, even among those who are not
insensitive, very many are so strictly dominated by their own desires
and prejudices that any thought or valuation which we consider worth
suggesting to them is at once violently rejected.</p>

<p>There are many complications and difficulties in this strange work.
In the first place we may chance to do serious damage to the past mind
by unwise influence, for instance by presenting it with ideas which are
too disturbing to its nature. For though some ideas are so foreign to a
mind that they are simply rejected, others, though alien to the
superficial part of its nature, may be incendiary to the submerged
part, as sparks falling upon tinder. Thus an idea which to the explorer
seems straightforward and harmless may produce in the past mind a
self-discrepant experience both of revelation and of horror; and the
resulting conflict throughout the mind may lead to catastrophe. Or the
idea may so captivate and exalt the unfortunate person that he loses
all sense of proportion, is instigated to some fantastic course of
action, and finally comes into serious collision with his society.</p>

<p>Another difficulty lies in the fact that our influence is not always
voluntary. Thoughts and desires of our own, which we have no intention
of transmitting, may sometimes find their way into the mind under
observation; and their effect may be disastrous. For instance, a sudden
surge of contempt or indignation on the part of an inexperienced
explorer, when he observes his 'host' commit some egregious folly or
meanness, may flood a hitherto complacent mind with bewildering
self-contempt. And this novel experience, coming thus without
preparation, may shatter the whole flimsy structure of the mind by
destroying its carapace of self-pride. Or again, the explorer's own
clear-eyed and ecstatic view of the cosmos, as both tragic and
worshipful, may sear the optimistic faith of a primitive religious
mind, without being able to raise it to the loftier worship.</p>

<p>Our influence, then, upon the past is a very much more precarious
and restricted power than our past-exploration. All that we can do is
to offer to a very small minority of minds some vague hint of a truth
or of a beauty which would otherwise be missed, or some special
precept, or seminal idea, relevant to the mind's particular
circumstances. This may be done either by a constant 'tilting' of the
mind in a certain general direction, or, much more rarely, by
occasional impregnation of the mind with some precise idea or
valuation. In very exceptional cases, which number no more than one in
many thousands of millions, we can subject the individual to a constant
stream of detailed suggestion which he himself can embody in a more or
less faithful report. But here we find ourselves on the horns of a
dilemma. To undergo this detailed suggestion, the individual must be
extremely receptive; but in the main those that are extremely receptive
lack originality, so that, in spite of their detailed receptivity, they
either entirely miss the true spirit of the communication, or fail to
embody it in a manner capable of stirring their fellows. On the other
hand the highly original minds, even when they are also very receptive,
tend deliberately to ignore the detail of the suggestion. Thus they
produce works which, though true to the spirit of the suggestion, are
embodied in manners expressive of their own genius.</p>

<h3>iv. HOVERING OVER TIME</h3>

<p>I must now give you a more precise idea of the strange experiences
which befall the explorer when he is trying to get a footing in some
particular moment of some particular past mind. Each explorer has his
own technique, and each adventure its own vicissitudes; but I shall
tell simply of my own approach to your world and epoch on that occasion
which I have already begun to describe.</p>

<p>Emerging presently from that ineffable moment in which I
participated in the eternal view, I was at the outset conscious of a
vague restlessness, a most poignant yet indefinite yearning, and along
with this a violent and confused agitation of all my senses. Even
though this was not my first excursion into these realms, I was
overwhelmed with the pathos of man's ever-unsatisfied and blindly
fumbling desire, and equally by the tyranny of his rare joys and the
torture of his distresses. At the outset this yearning and this sensory
tumult were, so to speak, all that there was of me; but with an effort
I woke to something more precise. I held the obscure thing away from
me, and looked at it calmly. As I did so, it developed under my very
eyes, the eyes of my mind, into a surge of specific primitive cravings
and passions, which, though I lived them as my own, I also regarded, as
it were, from a great height of aloofness. I was now experiencing the
summed and confused experiences of all mankind. They came to me with
the vagueness of a composite photograph, but also with that sense of
multitude, of innumerable individual uniquenesses, which one may
sometimes catch in listening to the murmur of a great crowd. Yet all
these multitudinous experiences were in a manner mine, and combined
into one experience, like the single deliverance of a man's two eyes. I
was terrified and longed for safety, hungry and lusted for food. I was
enraged against some obscure adversary. I tasted the joy of murder, and
equally the final despair of the victim. I was solitary, and my flesh
burned with sexual potency; outcast, and my mind hungered for
companionship.</p>

<p>Against this vast enduring background of primitive craving I
experienced also momentary gleams of loftier desire, rare and faint as
voices heard above the storm. I felt the longing and the delight of
spiritual intimacy with another mind, the longing and the delight of
truth, the longing and the delight and glory of participation in a
great community, the longing and the delight of faith. I felt also the
terror, the despair, the peace and final ecstasy, which is the way of
true worship. But all these illuminations of the spirit were no more
than stars piercing for a moment the storm-cloud of the primitive.</p>

<p>While I was undergoing all these obscure impulses, tumultuous
messages were also pouring in through all my senses. At first indeed I
received such a medley of impressions that I was aware only of a
nondescript and distressing commotion. But, as I attended to this, the
matter of the various senses began to differentiate itself. Thus at
first I seemed to be subjected to a general pressure all over my body;
but under scrutiny this developed into a profusion of hardnesses and
softnesses, roughnesses and smoothnesses, rotundities and angularities.
I felt the pressure of earth under my feet. I felt myself lying on hard
ground, and then on a kindly bed. With my hands I felt a multitude of
textures, as of stone, tree-trunks, fur, and the incomparable touch of
human flesh, in all its repellent and its enticing modes. I felt also a
vague warmth and chill, which, by attending to them, I could develop
into violent heat and cold, or the bite of fire and frost. Innumerable
pains invaded me. At first they seemed to struggle against a sense of
physical well-being, a tingling healthiness; but soon pain triumphed;
for it had at the outset a compelling poignancy which increased
alarmingly under attention. The whole surface of my body, it seemed,
was tortured; and my internal organs were all gripped in agony. My
brain throbbed and burned, and was stabbed through and through in all
directions. But in truth the brain that was thus tormented was not
mine, nor the bowels mine, nor the skin. The source of my torture lay
in the innumerable bodies of my predecessors. Wrenching my attention
from this horror, I noticed a confusion of tastes, fragrances and
stenches. And along with these there came sounds. A muffled roar, as of
the sea or a distant bombardment, grew as I listened to it into a
crashing and shrieking, which reverberated through my whole body. By a
special act of attention, a straining of the mind's ear, I could
penetrate beyond this uproar, and hear an obscure vocal sound, which,
as I listened, became inarticulate lamentation, flecked here and there
with laughter.</p>

<p>In the field of vision I experienced at first nothing but a vague
brightness above and obscurity below. This was due to the fact that in
most minds of all periods, save those in which indoor life predominates
over outdoor life, daytime-experience contains in the main a light sky
and a darker ground. As soon as I began to attend to the matter of this
vision, it revealed itself as being after all rich with detail. First,
both in the light and in the dark field, there moved unrecognizable
shadowy forms and occasional colours. Then aloft I began to see white
clouds sailing in blue sky, then widespread rain-cloud, then
thunder-cloud, and then in a moment the broad unbroken blue; then
night, obscure, starry, moonlit, and again obscure. Below, I saw
sometimes hills, crags, tree-tops, meadows, bright flowers and plumage,
sometimes breakers on the shore, sometimes huts, mansions in many
styles, or congested towns, sometimes interiors of splendour or
comfortable homeliness or squalor. All these forms kept appearing,
vanishing, reappearing, invading one another and exterminating one
another, like the visions that haunt us between waking and sleeping. I
saw also forms of beasts, and human forms of all the species, from
hairy pithecanthropus, and your own fantastically clothed half-human
kind, to those large and noble beings who were the last Terrestrials,
and the bat-like fliers of Venus, and my own immediate ancestors on
Neptune. I saw limbs writhing in agony, limbs dancing, limbs straining
in toil and sport, fair limbs embracing, limbs grotesque and crippled.
Faces also appeared and vanished, singly or in crowds, faces eager and
disillusioned, faces twisted by pain, or by rapacity, faces
expressionless as pebbles, faces of terror, hate, meanness, faces of
peace and of exultation; child faces, faces of maturity all aglow with
life, faces grey, wrinkled, sagging, old; and faces of the dead,
impassive, sealed against experience.</p>

<p>Along with these visions of humanity, would sometimes come faint
sexual sensations, which, when I attended to them, opened out into a
whole world of amorous experience, of lyrical first matings and
desolate repetitions, of violations, thwarted crises, lonely
makeshifts, of the bland unions of long-tried lovers, of senile
failures, and the whole gamut of perversions.</p>

<p>Intermingled with these purely perceptual visions, there came to me
all manner of experiences of personal relationships. I was flooded with
the lovings and hatings, of all men and women, by their co-operations
and rivalries, by all the modes of leadership, by all c fealties and
servitudes. I became a mother toiling for a son whose thought was not
of her; I became a son held within the soft, strong meshes of his home.
I had a glimpse, as it were both from without and from within their
minds, of myriads of the boys and girls of all the species, opening
their eyes in amazement upon life, knowing neither what they ought to
be doing with it nor even how to wrest from it the simple joys they so
vaguely conceived. I glimpsed likewise the myriads of grown men and
women, with all their hopes thwarted, and their minds desparately
concerned only to keep their bodies alive, or at most their heads above
their fellows. And the old I glimpsed also, with their lives written
indelibly into the great story of worlds. Through their eyes I watched
the young things rising up all around them and beyond them, like birds
that rise and leave their wounded on the ground. It seemed too that I
entered into the minds of the innumerable toilers of all the aeons. I
felt the ache and the leaden weight of their limbs, the sick ache of
their eye-balls, and the hopelessness of their crippled souls. I felt
also the calm of spirit, the strenuous peacefulness, of those few who
are wholly and gladly possessed by their work.</p>

<p>There poured in upon me also all the thoughts and fantasies and
ideals of all men and women in all ages. My mind reeled and staggered
in the tide of them, and was swept to and fro upon the great ocean of
whimsies and dreams, doctrines and theories. With the pre-human beings,
I fashioned imaginatively, step by step, the whole world of perceptual
common sense, that tissue of theories and images, so true and so false,
which to most human beings of all species appears to be the
unquestionable real. I observed, as in my own mind, the flashes of
primeval genius that had gone to the making of that great medley of
fact and fiction. With the ape-men, too, I projected souls into trees
and mountains, storms and stars. And with them also I felt the first
painful birth-throes of true intellect. To trap my prey, to beguile my
mate, or build my shelter, I reasoned, I put two and two together. But
every motion of this reason I distorted with fantasies born of mere
desire, and when this hybrid failed me I blamed reason.</p>

<p>All manner of laborious reasonings and intricate bright myths
flashed across my mind and vanished. In the twinkling of an eye I
savoured cosmology after cosmology, I saw Shiva, Odin, Zeus, Jaweh and
his fair offspring Jesus, and innumerable other god-heads, of wrath and
righteousness, of wisdom, of power, of love, emanations from the minds
of all the races, all the species of man. And with these I tried out a
million sciences and philosophies, amongst which, as yet ever so faint
and remote, like the voices of two bright confident quarrelling
children, that' materialism' and that' spiritism' which resound
throughout your little play-room world. Theories, theories, myriads
upon myriads of them, streamed over me like wind-borne leaves, like the
contents of some titanic paper-factory flung aloft by the storm, like
dust-clouds in the hurricane advance of the mind. Gasping in this vast
whirling aridity, I almost forgot that in every mote of it lay some few
spores of the organic truth, most often parched and dead, but sometimes
living, pregnant, significant.</p>

<h3>v. DESCENT AMONG THE FIRST MEN</h3>

<p>During the whole of this early stage of my adventure I was already
trying to select from the confusion of experiences something which
might serve to bring me nearer to your own particular phase of the
human process. My chief method of directing myself toward your age is,
as I have already said, to assume imaginatively, and as precisely as
possible, first the basic temperamental pattern of your species, and
then the particular form of it which is characteristic of your period,
and of that unique point and moment of individuality which I desire to
study. This work I was already attempting; but it was hampered on this
occasion, and on most others, by the prodigious influx of perceptions,
thoughts and emotions which I have attempted to describe. I was like a
swimmer swept hither and thither by great waves, and scarcely able to
make the particular rocky creek which is his haven.</p>

<p>I had first to conceive, and emotionally assume, the general form of
all primitive human mentality, so as to exclude from my view the whole
of my own species, and also that other, abortive, phase of spiritual
maturity, which took place just before man left the earth. I had to
become in imagination a bewildered limited being, ignorant of its own
nature, ever racked by inner conflicts which eluded its apprehension,
ever yearning to be whole, yet ever carried away by momentary cravings
which were ludicrous even in its own estimation. With patience I was
able to achieve this piece of inner play-acting with such success that
I began to have definite but fleeting glimpses of individuals and
incidents among the primitive kinds of men, now a winged Venerian,
skimming his wild ocean, now a woman of the Third Men, ruddy and lithe,
feeding her beasts, now a scarcely human early inhabitant of Neptune.
These individuals I perceived, of course, through the eyes of some
contemporary; and if ever I troubled to look at 'my own' body during
these experiences, I perceived it to be not my familiar body at all,
but of the same species as the observed individual. Perceiving through
the eyes of past beings, I perceived their bodies as though they were
each in turn my own body.</p>

<p>I had now to select that mode of the primitive which is distinctive
of your own species, a mode characterized by repressed sexuality,
excessive self-regard, and an intelligence which is both rudimentary
and in bondage to unruly cravings. Now though all the races of your
species in all its stages manifest, in spite of their differences, one
unique blend of these factors, yet the process of imaginatively
assuming this mode of mentality is dangerous; for there is another
species, one of our fore-runners on Neptune, which is strangely like
you in this respect. I now found myself, as often before, oscillating
painfully between these two phases of man's career. I saw now the hills
and tall trees of Earth, now the plains and bushes of Neptune. I
assumed now the spidery limbs and jaunty gait of a Terrestrial, now the
elephantine legs, kangaroo arms and grave demeanour of an early
Neptunian. I listened for a moment to Attic disputation, then suddenly
to primitive Neptunian grunts and clicks. It was as though I were
listening-in with a radio set of bad selectivity. Or, to change the
image, I was a storm-tossed buzzard among the hills, beneath me a
dividing range, on either side of it a valley. Into one of these
valleys I purposed to descend, but the wind kept thrusting me back over
the ridge into the other. At one moment I saw beneath me the desired
valley; then, after a vain struggle, the other. At length, however, by
a violent effort of attention I succeeded in concentrating upon your
species and avoiding the other. Gradually the imagery and thought which
flooded in on me came to be entirely derived from the First Men, in one
or other of their phases.</p>

<p>But my experience was still chaotic. I had indeed a strong but vague
apprehension of your species as a historic whole, of its many long
phases of somnolence and its few brief effulgences. And after careful
inspection I detected that sense of cosmical tragedy which overwhelmed,
or, from your point of view, will overwhelm, the more intelligent of
your descendants, when they realize that their species is setting
inevitably into decline. But for the most part I had merely a sickening
confusion of random samples from all your ages. Thus, at one moment I
was an Aurignacian, engraving his cave wall with vivid shapes of deer
and bison, while my fellow hunters peered with admiration through the
smoke. Now I was a Chinese citizen of that Americanized world-state
which lies future to you; and I was speaking in worn and polluted
English to my Soudanese wife. Now I was an Elizabethan dame,
tight-laced and plastered with jewellery. Suddenly I flashed many
thousands of years ahead into that Patagonian civilization which is the
last weary effort of your species. I was a prematurely aged boy,
prostrate in a temple before the grotesque image of Power. Not until
many more of these visions had appeared, and been dismissed, did I find
myself approximately in your age. I was an Indian confronting a topeed,
bare-kneed Englishman. Rage was in my heart, fear, contempt and
subterfuge, and as little understanding of the other as he had of
me.</p>

<p>Fatigued but now more hopeful, I forced myself rigorously into the
mentality which is common to most members of a primitive
industrialistic community. To you this curious mode of experience is so
familiar that you do not suspect its rarity and oddity, though many of
you feel that it is neither wholesome nor inevitable. That you may
realize the violent effort of imagination and emotional control that
was now incumbent on me, I will set down the main features which render
the primitive industrial mentality so difficult for the explorer. To
revert to the image which I have already used, it is as though the
buzzard, having successfully descended into the valley of his choice,
were now to enter the ventilation shaft of an old disused mine, and
were to sink downwards in the dark through fetid air, with scarcely
room to keep his wings outspread. No wonder that he suffers
considerable distress and incurs serious dangers, before he finally
alights amongst the pale and eyeless fauna of the pit. No wonder that
his own eyes take time to accustom themselves to the dim
phosphorescence which is the sole illumination of that world. When the
explorer seeks to establish himself in your society, he has first to
assume that jarred and restless mood which is common to all those whose
habitual environment is alien to their native capacities. In particular
he must imaginatively produce in himself the lifelong strain of
perceiving streets, traffic, and stuffy interiors, instead of the
landscapes which originally moulded his capacities. He must also
reconstruct in himself the unconscious obsession with matter, or rather
with the control of matter by machinery and chemical manipulation. He
must conceive also the mind's unwitting obeisance and self-distrust
before its robot offspring. Further, he must subject his own
free-roaming spirit to the hideous effects of a narrow specialism, both
of body and mind. He must conceive the almost inconceivable ignorance
and groping hate of the being whose life is moulded to one narrow round
of duties and perceptions. Equally he must conceive the profound
unwitting guiltiness of the primitive industrial master, and also of
that idle scum that floats on the surface of all primitive industrial
societies.</p>

<p>Little by little I reproduced in myself this cramped and ungenerous
mode of the mind; and, as I did so, visions of your world came crowding
in upon me with increasing vividness. I became a half-naked woman in a
coal-mine of your Industrial Revolution. I crept on hands and knees
along a low gallery. Tugging at the collar like a beast, I dragged a
truck. The trace passed between my legs. I was whimpering, not from any
present discomfort, but because I had lost a keepsake. This incident
was obviously a century or more too early, but others followed, and
more and more of them were of your period. I had now to seek out a
particular individual among you, and a particular moment of his life.
But in doing so, I nearly suffered catastrophe. On Venus there was
once, or rather from your point of view there will be, an industrial
phase much like your own in certain respects, although the species
which produced it was very different from yours. Into that epoch I was
suddenly flung by I know not what detail of identity. A face which was
obviously not of the First Men, a pale and blinking frog-like face,
with a running sore beneath the left eye and a fantastic hat cocked
backwards, slowly grimaced at me. For one anxious moment I feared that
I should be trapped in that Venerian phase of man, with my mind still
moulded to the mentality of the First Men. But by a desperate effort of
concentration upon the Terrestrial mode of experience I managed to
disengage myself from this dangerous irrelevance. And with one leap I
found myself back again at the desired point of your history.</p>

<h3>vi. IN THE STREETS OF LONDON</h3>

<p>I was in a town. A great red vehicle, roaring and trumpeting, was in
the act of swooping upon me. Leaping out of its track, I ran to the
pavement where two contrary streams of pedestrians brushed past one
another. As the archaic chariot left me, I saw on its flank the English
word 'General', in letters of gold. I had already become familiar with
this device on my previous visit to your world, and I now knew that I
must be in London somewhere between the invention of the motor-omnibus
and the socialization of all such vehicles under a metropolitan
authority. The clothes of the women pedestrians were of the style worn
in 1914. Skirts left the ankle exposed, waists were confined within
broad belts of ribbon, hats were large, and poised high on the crown.
Clearly I had struck the right period, but who was I, or rather who was
my host? I noted with satisfaction that his basic mental pattern fitted
very precisely the mood which I had already myself assumed to take me
to my chosen object of study. Surely this must be the young man whom I
sought. I shall not reveal his name, since with its aid he or his
relatives might recognize the portrait, or the setting, which I must
give in some detail. I shall therefore refer to him simply as Paul. I
had already observed him on an earlier visit, but now I proposed to
follow him through the most critical moment of the career of his
species.</p>

<p>Paul was gravely agitated. I noticed a visual image looming in the
recesses of his mind, an image not open to his own introspection. It
was the face of his pet enemy of childhood days, and it was streaming
with tears and blood. The child Paul had just put an end to this lad's
bullying by defending himself with a table-fork. He now consciously
felt once more (though he knew not why) the horror and guilt that he
had suffered long ago at the sight of his enemy's damaged cheek. The
experience was now accompanied by confused images of khaki, bayonets,
and the theme of a patriotic song. Paul was experiencing, and I
experienced through him, a distressing conflict of blood-loathing and
martial fervour. Evidently I had come upon Paul in the midst of his
great crisis. Like so many of his contemporaries, he was faced with the
necessity of deciding whether he would or would not fight for king and
country and gallant little Belgium. But with Paul the situation was
complicated by the fact that ever since his childhood I had been
tampering with his mind so as to make him more sensitive to the
momentous issues which were at stake.</p>

<p>Had I needed further confirmation that my host was indeed Paul, it
was available. He was now passing a shop which bore a panel of mirror
between its windows. Such mirrors I had often noticed in your cities,
cunning devices for attracting the attention of your amusingly and
fatally self-gratulatory species. My host slackened his pace and gazed
into the mirror. Indeed he actually halted for a moment. I at once
recognized the youthful and anxious face that I had perforce so often
observed in the shaving-glass. But I noticed that its habitual
expression of watchful self-reserve was now intensified with some kind
of suppressed but haunting terror. Neptunian vision detected also,
contrasting with this callow distress, a gleam of contemptuous irony,
new in Paul.</p>

<p>Only for a moment did Paul regard himself. With a blush and an
impatient jerk he turned away, and looked anxiously to see if any one
had been watching him. Immediately, with a deeper blush, he faced the
mirror again, and pretended to be searching for grit, in his eye.
Amongst the crowd of passers-by, two figures were approaching, and
almost upon us. The young man was in khaki. The girl clung to his arm
with demure possessiveness. He did not notice Paul, but she caught
Paul's eyes as he was turning toward the mirror. In the fraction of a
second that elapsed before his eyes could free themselves, he saw that
she dismissed him as no true male, that she thanked God her man was a
soldier, and that she was ready to do her bit by yielding herself
unconditionally to him. Real tears welled in Paul's eyes to wash out
the imaginary grit. I took a hasty glance at the most recent memories
of my host, and saw that, while he had been walking along the Strand
after his lunch he had been subject to several encounters of this sort,
real or imaginary. By now he was badly shaken. He turned down a
side-street, and wandered along the Embankment. Presently he was calmed
by the quietly flowing water, still more, perhaps, by the Obelisk, that
proud ancient captive among Lilliputians. To Paul it seemed
refreshingly indifferent to their ant-wars. Suddenly his peace was
shattered. Half a dozen urchins approached in military formation,
accompanied by martial rhythms on an old tin can. As they passed him,
one of them struck up on a mouth-organ an excruciating but recognizable
version of a catchy song already in vogue among the troops. I felt
Paul's mind rear and plunge beneath me like a startled horse. Many
times he had heard that tune; many columns of troops he had seen, with
full equipment, marching toward the great railway terminus for
entrainment toward the coast. But this commonplace little incident
stirred him more deeply. It filled him with a desperate longing to be
at one with the herd, to forget himself in the herd's emotions, to
sacrifice himself heroically to the herd's gods.</p>

<p>A visual image now flashed into his view, a shop-front converted
into a recruiting office. The window displayed posters to incite the
laggard, 'Your king and country need you', and so on. This image Paul
now greeted with a violent assent. On the heels of that swift mental
gesture there followed a fleeting tactual image of a hand's pressure on
his hand, as though the whole nation were congratulating him on his
decision.</p>

<p>Paul hurried away from the river with an almost swaggering gait. He
took a short cut by back-streets to the recruiting office that he had
so often passed, and as often circumvented so as to avoid' its blatant
reproaches. Street after street he threaded, and in each: succeeding
street his resolution was less secure and his swagger less evident. The
only clear conviction in his mind, was that, whichever course he
finally took, he would regret it, and feel ashamed that he had not
taken the other. His perplexity was the outcome not only of the
objective moral problem as to what course was in fact the right course,
but also of a subjective psychological problem, namely what would his
motives really be if he took this course, and what if he took that.</p>

<p>I myself, observing his mind as he hurried along in dangerous
abstraction among pedestrians and vehicles, was able to detect in him
many motives hidden from his own observation. There is no need to give
a complete inventory of the tangled impulses that were pulling him
hither and thither in his perplexity, but one point must be made clear
because of its significance. Paul's indecision was in fact only
superficial, was indeed illusory. To me, though not to Paul himself, it
was evident that he had resolved on his course a good month earlier,
and that however much he might seem to himself to be vacillating, his
will was already fixed. This curious state of affairs was due to the
fact that his deciding motive was not clearly apprehended; while at the
same time he was very poignantly aware of a conflict between other
motives which were not strictly relevant to the problem at all. Thus,
he dared not enlist, lest his motive should be merely moral cowardice;
he dared not refuse to enlist, lest his motive should be merely
physical cowardice or moral pride. Whatever course he chose would
almost certainly spring from purely selfish motives. In fact although
the decision had indeed really been made long ago, he had ever since
been chafing within his illusory cage of morality and selfishness, like
a captive beast that rubs itself painfully against its bars without
hope of escape.</p>

<p>The same forlorn task was occupying him when at last the recruiting
office leapt into view. It was a comer house, diagonally opposite him.
He stepped off the pavement, dodged the traffic, and was already
half-way across, when his resolution finally vanished.</p>

<p>At the door stood a sergeant with a red, white and blue cockade. He
had already sighted Paul, and was preparing to greet him with
acquisitive geniality. Paul's legs continued to carry him toward the
door, though weakly; but Paul's mind now woke to a surprisingly clear
conviction that, whatever the reason, this thing must not be done. He
reached the pavement. The sergeant stood aside to let him pass. Paul
was almost in the doorway when he suddenly veered and scuttled away.
His conviction vanished, but he continued to hurry along the pavement.
Tears came to his eyes, and he whimpered to himself, 'Coward, Coward';
with which verdict the sergeant doubtless agreed.</p>

<p>But to me, the detached observer, it was evident that though Paul
was on the whole more of a coward than the average, and would have made
a very bad soldier, it was not cowardice that had put him to flight. It
is difficult to describe the determining though deeply hidden motive
which, on this occasion as on others, snatched him away from the
recruiting office. It was a motive present also in the majority of his
contemporaries, though in few was it able to disturb the operation of
more familiar motives. The real determinant of Paul's behaviour was an
obscure intuition, which your psychologists mostly fail to recognize as
a basic and unanalysable factor in your nature. They fail to recognize
it, because in you it is so precarious and so blind. You have no
satisfactory name for it, since few of you are at all clearly aware of
it. Call it, if you will, loyalty to the enterprise of Life on your
planet and among the stars; but realize that, though it is a natural
product of age-long events, and though it cannot express itself at all
unless it is evoked by education, it becomes, at a certain stage of
evolution, a bias as strong and unreasoned as the bias in favour of
food or offspring. Indeed these propensities are but gropings toward
this more general but equally non-rational bias. This it was that in
Paul, partly through my earlier influence, partly through his own
constitution, was strong enough to turn him aside on the threshold of
the recruiting office. This it was that in the majority of Paul's
contemporaries caused, indeed, grave agony of mind, but could not bring
them to refuse war.</p>

<h2>3 THE CHILD PAUL</h2>

<blockquote>i. PAUL AND HIS NEPTUNIAN PARASITE ii. THE CHILD PAUL iii.
EARLY EXPERIMENTS ON PAUL iv. PAUL'S CHANGING WORLD</blockquote>

<h3>i. PAUL AND HIS NEPTUNIAN PARASITE</h3>

<p>WHY do I choose Paul for study? Why do I propose to tell you more of
him than of anyone else in my collection? I have examined in detail at
one time and another an immense number of specimens of your kind, not
only your contemporaries but many others whose date is earlier than
yours, and many who in your day are still to live. I have made myself
familiar with every trait and whim, every minute episode in the minds
of selected individuals from among the Greeks, the Indians, the early
Teutons, the ancient Egyptians, the Chinese of all China's phases, and
also the still unborn Americans and Patagonians. In fact, there is no
race of the First Men that has not yielded me samples; which, as I have
grown intimate with them, have so captivated me with their fantastic
personalities that I have come to regard them not merely as specimens
but, in a manner, as friends. For these beings have yielded me the
secrets of their nature to an extent impossible in normal intercourse;
and yet they have never communicated with me, and for the most part
have never suspected my existence.</p>

<p>If I chose, I could tell you many strange secrets about your famous
characters, for instance about your Queen Elizabeth, who is among my
collection. Through her eyes I have looked not only on the fair face of
Essex, but also on that abnormal formation of her own body which caused
her to be so lonely, so insistent on her womanhood, and withal so
kingly. And I have tasted her bitter rage against fate, her greedy
self-love, her love of England. Leonardo da Vinci also I have
inhabited. It was I that tormented him with a thousand ideas in advance
of his age. It was the enigma of my influence in him that he embodied
in pigment as a smile. Aknahton also I swayed, and in his wife's face
my influence conjured another smile. There are moments in my life on
Neptune when my beloved specimens crowd in upon my memory and overwhelm
me with the infinity of their uniquenesses; when, forgetful of my own
Neptunian personality, I seem to be nothing but the theatre in which
these many play their parts.</p>

<p>If it is incredible to you that I should have millions of these
intimates, remember, not only that the minds of the Last Men are far
more agile and far more capacious than your minds, but also that I have
spent many thousands of years upon the work, and that in most cases a
whole terrestrial lifetime occupies me for no more than a day of my
life on Neptune. Of course even my millions of specimens can afford
only partial knowledge of your kind. But those of my colleagues who
have been working in the same field have worked with no less industry.
No doubt all of us together have studied only a minute fraction of your
species; but at least we have by now sampled every culture, every local
strain, every generation. And your own age, since it is the
turning-point of your history, we have sifted again and again with
special care.</p>

<p>Why then out of all this collection do I choose Paul as the text and
the epitome of what I have to say to you? I choose him because he does
epitomize in his character, his circumstances, and his reaction to my
influence, the spiritual crisis of your age, and indeed the doom of
your species. It would not be true to say that he was an exceptionally
average member of his race. Far from it. Though in a sense typical and
significant, Paul was not average. Indeed both in character and in
circumstance he was rather unusual. Yet he is typical in that he
illustrates very clearly the confused nature of his species, and the
disorder of its world. In Paul's life there appear with an almost naive
simplicity of outline certain phases of spiritual growth, distorted by
the all-pervading blight of his age, nay of his species. In all of you,
from the earliest flint-worker, even to the last survivors of
Patagonia, the conflict between the primitive simian nature and the
genuinely human (or from your point of view the super-human) is present
as a fundamental condition of life. In Paul the old simian nature was
undisguised and insistent, while the new human nature had defined
itself with precision and emphasis. The conflict therefore was
clear.</p>

<p>I pride myself somewhat on the discovery of Paul. My crowning
research upon the mentality of the First Men and on the crisis of their
career demanded a specimen such as I knew would be hard to find. I
cannot tell you at all clearly what was necessary, since you are
ignorant of the principles of my work. But, to repeat, I had to select
an individual both typical and unique, a being of average intelligence,
average abilities, average strength of will, but one in whom the simian
and the distinctively human were both well developed and delicately
balanced. Further, he must be one capable of a degree of
self-consciousness abnormal in your species. Many other more subtle
requirements I must leave unmentioned. In order to discover this unique
creature I had to explore not only your own age but many earlier
generations in search of genetic strains favourable to my
requirements.</p>

<p>In the Seventeenth Century there was a German family which promised
what I wanted; but in them the desirable features were complicated by a
musical sensitivity which in many individuals afforded escape from the
conflict. I noticed, however, that those members of the clan who most
nearly fulfilled my requirements had a subtly characteristic laugh; or
rather that, though they laughed in many different styles, the laughter
of each had a curious fleeting tremor of bewilderment. Armed with this
clue, and certain others more introspective, I continued my search,
until in the England of King Alfred I found a similar and even more
promising strain. This I followed through the generations hither and
thither. One branch of it, the most promising, was exterminated by the
Black Death, another became hopelessly contaminated by interbreeding
with a strain of defectives, a third produced witches in the Sixteenth
Century and mystics in the Seventeenth. Early in the Eighteenth Century
a member of this line married into another stock which I had already
marked out, and produced a number of more scientifically-minded folk.
Throughout the Eighteenth and early Nineteenth Centuries this line
suffered social decline, and proliferated in a swarm of
poverty-stricken households scattered over the industrial north of
England. From one of these sprang Paul's grandmother, who by good
fortune married into yet another of my chosen lines. Paul's father also
was of a stock that had already interested me.</p>

<p>Having now discovered my unique specimen, I first took a hasty
glance at his career, and found to my delight that circumstance was
destined to intensify and clarify in him the characteristics which I
proposed to study. In that first hasty glance I saw also the quite
unmistakable effects of a Neptunian influence, doubtless my own
influence which I had not yet exerted. I then proceeded to make a
thorough investigation of every line of Paul's ancestry, in order that
I might know his nature through and through. Many volumes could be
filled with the results of this inquiry, but here I need not elaborate.
Incidentally I traced the evolution of Paul's physical appearance, of
his nose, eyebrows, hands, and so on. A curious twist of the hair of
his left eyebrow, which was a recessive character, and had not appeared
in any of his more recent ancestors, came in with a French strain in
the Fourteenth Century. A certain scarcely noticeable prominence of the
cheek-bones I traced to a Danish invader of the Eighth Century, and
beyond him through Swedes and Finns into Central Asia. Another
remarkable line of his ancestry, in part responsible for his
intellectual curiosity and certain features of his thumb-print, took me
via a Dutch merchant of the Seventeenth Century, a Rhenish baron of the
Thirteenth, various Swiss herdsmen and Italian farmers to Syracuse, and
so to ancient Greece, where one of Paul's ancestors once handed a cup
to Socrates. But apart from a dozen or so curious threads of this type,
which of course occur in many family trees, Paul's ancestry was the
usual tangle of intercrossing lines; stretching back in manifold
complexity among the Norse, the Low Germans, the Ancient British, and
the Neolithic, and beyond these to the common forefathers of all your
races. It would have been useless to trace Paul's ancestry any further
in detail, since nothing more that was distinctive of Paul himself
remained to be discovered. In the more remote past the genes that were
to produce Paul were ancestral also to the mass of his contemporaries.
This story was already known to me.</p>

<p>I must now tell you what it was that I intended to do with Paul, and
how I carried out my plan. I wished to perform certain delicate
experiments on him and observe his reactions. To some of the readers of
this book the mental vivisection which I had to practise upon Paul may
seem merely brutal. I would remind them first that it was a necessary
part of a very lofty task; second, that Paul himself in his best
moments would have gladly accepted all and more of my torturing
manipulation for the sake of that high enterprise; and lastly that the
final result upon Paul, the individual human being, was a very great
spiritual enrichment.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give you any clear idea of my aim beyond saying
that, having found this uniquely typical yet also exceptionally
self-conscious being, I intended to influence him periodically in such
a manner that he should see his world as far as possible from the
Neptunian point of view. I should then be able to observe in detail the
effect of this vision on his primitive nature. Had he been of the
heroic type, this policy would have turned him into some kind of
prophet or crank. But he was made of milder stuff, and would never
spoil my experiment in that style. Indeed, one effect of my
intermittent manipulation of his experience was to inspire him with a
dread of showing himself to be different from others. Just because he
possessed a whole secret world of his own, and was prone to see the
actual world turn farcical or hideous in the light cast by that other
world, he became increasingly anxious to maintain a secure footing in
the actual world and conform to all the customary modes of behaviour.
For in spite of his Neptunian vision he remained essentially a product
of his own world. But as my influence extended, he was forced to admit
that there was something in him profoundly alien to his environment,
something alien even to himself. At times he feared he was going mad;
at other times he would persuade himself with immense complacency that
he was 'inspired', and that he must indeed be a prophet; but as he was
incapable of any such heroism, this delusion was soon shattered. There
were moments when he threatened to break into two personalities, one
the natural Paul, the other a violent and spasmodic idealist. But I had
chosen him carefully; he was too well integrated actually to succumb to
this easy solution of his conflict. Instead of disintegrating, he
remained one mind, though torn and perplexed.</p>

<p>But as time passed a change came over him. At first he had regarded
his native terrestrial mentality as himself, and the Neptunian
influence as alien, disturbing, irrational, insane. He was fascinated
by it, but he wished to keep it thoroughly suppressed and ineffective.
Later, however, it came to seem a divine enlightenment, sane and
joyous, still alien to himself but most precious. Then at last he began
to try to live according to my influence, and incurred at once the
ridicule and hostility of his own world. With horror he now foreswore
his 'inner light' which had so misled him. He earnestly tried to become
blind to it, and to be like his fellows. But my influence left him no
peace. It found something responsive in him, which, as he matured, was
emboldened to identify itself wholly with the Neptunian point of view.
Little by little he came to think of this Neptunian factor in his mind
as truly 'himself', and the normal Terrestrial as' other', something
like an unruly horse which his true self must somehow break in and
ride. There followed a period of struggle, which ended in despair; for
it became clear that he could not master his Terrestrial nature.
Indeed, it seemed to him that he himself was bound and helpless upon
the back of this uncontrolled animal; or that while his body and his
mundane intelligence went about the world performing all manner of
aimless antics, his essential spirit was imprisoned somewhere in his
head watching all, but almost wholly impotent. This essential spirit
which he regarded as 'himself' was not, of course, merely my influence
in him; it was his own best and most human nature, on which my
influence was able to work. But this best of his was only the
rudimentary best which was characteristic of his species; and though my
influence had endowed it with an immense treasure of imagination, it
remained almost wholly ineffective, as is usual with your kind. Yet
there were times in his life when Paul did succeed in acting in a
manner that was really human, and on these occasions my influence
played a part. Of these crises I shall presently tell.</p>

<h3>ii. THE CHILD PAUL</h3>

<p>I know Paul perhaps better than I know myself. I have been Paul. I
have been Paul throughout his life, and watched him to the very moment
of his death. The more important passages of his life I have
experienced again and again. I know little intimate facts about him,
like the feel of the inside of his mouth. I know the feel of Paul
slightly drunk, Paul sexually excited, and Paul with one of his bad
colds. I know, far better than Paul himself knew it, the obscure tone
of his whole body, when through eating too many muffins, he seemed to
see the world itself turn foul. I know also, and can hold together for
comparison, the feel of Paul the child, Paul the boy, Paul the young
man, stiffening into middle age, and Paul awaiting death in helpless
senility.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is no need for me to tell you all the details that
I know about Paul. I have only to make you realize the main mental
themes or motifs of his life. I need not, for instance, tell you much
about his birth. It was a normal birth. Several times I have examined
the obscure experiences which harassed him during that earliest of his
adventures. For it seemed possible that even then something might have
occurred to contribute to his idiosyncrasies. But neither in his
passage into the outer world nor in his fungoid pre-natal experience
(so difficult for the explorer to penetrate) did I find anything
significant, save what is common to all his kind. In Paul, whose nature
was more sensitive than the average, the shock of exchanging the
elysium of the womb for an alien world was serious, and was accentuated
somewhat by the clumsiness of the physician. But it caused no unusual
damage to his mind, nothing but the common yearning toward a warmer,
cosier, less noxious world, which, in so many of you, favours legends
of a golden age in the past, or of a golden heaven in the future.</p>

<p>One feature of Paul's experience of birth was indeed significant,
and served to confirm my choice of him as a subject of experiment. Like
many others, he did not breathe till a smack made him take breath to
bellow. I experienced, of course, his bewildered fury at the
chastisement. I also experienced his awareness of the cold air that
flooded his lungs, and the shock of glee that came with it. In that
instant a connexion was registered in Paul's mind for ever after, a
connexion between what I may call fate's smiting and the breath of
life. In after years Paul was to know himself a coward, yet in spite of
his cowardice, he was ever to seek in the harshness of fate for the
breath of a new life. Even though, in all his ages, he yearned to creep
back into the warm close peace of the womb, he craved also to absorb
into his blood the atmosphere of a wider world.</p>

<p>I need not describe Paul's arduous self-education in the cot, the
nursery and the garden. Like all organisms he had to learn to cope with
his world. Like all animals he had to grapple with the problems of
perceiving and acting in a world of space and time. Little by little he
learned to observe and to respond to all manner of objects, such as the
rotund and fragrant dairy of his mother's breast, and the less
delectable bottle. He learned the geography of his own body, mapping it
out patiently, unwittingly, day by day, in a surprisingly intricate
system of explorations, discovering that all these complex findings
fell together beautifully in a three-dimensional system of touch and
sight. Many great arts he acquired, first the art of sucking, and of
shifting about in bed, then the art of the rattle. Presently he learned
how to use his whole body as a vehicle to transport him to and fro in a
wider sphere. He mastered the more dangerous arts of crawling and
walking, the art of the bouncing ball, and so on. Meanwhile he had
distinguished the soothing and indignant tones of the human voice.
Also, the intermittent human breasts and arms and laps and voices had
fallen into order to make more or less constant systems, each of which
might be expected to behave in a distinctive manner. Then at last he
discovered that human voices had meanings, and that he himself could
use these noises so as to make the great grown-up creatures do his
bidding.</p>

<p>This power of controlling the movements of adults was one of Paul's
most exciting early triumphs. It was a limited and erratic power. All
too often the great creature refused to obey, or actually turned the
tables and compelled him to do what he did not want to do. Altogether
these adults were a very perplexing fact in Paul's early life. In some
ways they were so necessary and reliable, in others so inconsequent and
even noxious. Of course, Paul did not consciously make these
generalizations, but they were implied in his behaviour. Thus in
certain respects, such as physical care and protection, he trusted the
adult absolutely, but in others he learned to expect nothing but
misunderstanding and ridicule. In yet other respects he himself was so
influenced by the prestige suggestion which these mighty beings brought
to bear on him, that many of their unintelligible admirations and
taboos gradually took root in his own nature. For instance, he
slavishly accepted their views about sex. Very early in his childhood
he had begun to take an interest in those parts of his body which
adults pointedly ignored. He had discovered that a vague pleasure
occurred when these organs were touched. But long before he was told
that it was wicked and dangerous to take any notice of them, he already
profoundly felt that it was so, merely through the awkwardness that
beset adults whenever he referred to them. Had Paul been born a young
baboon or chimpanzee he would at least have escaped the agony of mind
and waste of energy which, as I shall tell later, he, like so many of
his kind, incurred through this too ready acceptance of adult
standards. Meanwhile it was inevitable that, before sex became an
imperious need, Paul should adjust himself to adult standards in this
as in so many other respects. Adults were objects which one had to
learn to cope with, just as one had to learn to cope with dogs and
chairs and fire. Sometimes one failed and suffered for it, but on the
whole one succeeded.</p>

<p>I must not, however, dwell on the process by which Paul gradually
mastered these earliest problems. In all his adventures, I, his
parasite, tasted his success and failure. I suffered all his bumps,
scratches and scaldings. I saw beforehand what was impending. I saw
both that it was inevitable and that with a little more skill it might
have been avoided. Had I chosen, I might have played the mother to him
and saved him from many a disaster, but it was better to let him learn.
During his earliest Years I refrained from any kind of influence, since
it was important that he should develop normally up to a certain
stage.</p>

<p>Little by little Paul's world crystallized into extensive patterns.
No longer a meagre and obscure flux of dream-like forms, it became a
more or less reliable world of 'common sense', a house and garden, with
surrounding continents made up of other houses and gardens, streets and
fields. Gradually also he was able to look backwards not merely into a
confused cloud of pastness but along a brief but orderly vista of
nights and days.</p>

<p>But with this gradual increase of order in his daylight world, Paul
became more and more distressed by that other chaotic world which
swallowed him at night. When the light was put out and he was left
alone in bed, the whole reliable order vanished. Even if he kept his
eyes shut, terrifying shades confronted him with their vague and shifty
forms. He saw animal heads and shoulders, and stealthily moving gorilla
arms. They kept changing from one thing into another thing. They were
unintelligible and therefore terrible.</p>

<p>Still worse, sometimes the seething confusion of shadows would be
dominated by a single staring eye. Paul could not escape it. Wherever
he looked, there it was, watching him. Perhaps it was God's eye, seeing
right through him, coldly noting all his most secret wickedness.
Perhaps God had done away with the world of day because Paul had been
so naughty in it. Perhaps there was nothing now but Paul and God and
the close dark, with one streak of light pretending to be under the
door, to keep up appearances. Somehow the Eye seemed to him both very
wise and very stupid, a vindictive clever thing, that intended to kill
him just by gazing at him, for no reason but that he did not please the
Eye. Sometimes Paul was so terrified that he screamed. Then an
exasperated grown-up would appear and ask what on earth was the matter.
He could never tell, for grown-ups were somehow blind to the night
world, and would think him silly. But to me, Paul's trouble was very
real, and also intelligible. To Paul, though he knew it not, the night
was the womb. When he was very sleepy, it promised rest and peace; but
when he was not sleepy, he regarded it as a well of blackness,
stuffiness, formlessness, negation. It threatened to swallow him back
from the bright orderly extra-uterine world of day, with its
complicated geography, its reliable persons, and its winds that came
with obscure messages from still wider spheres.</p>

<p>Throughout Paul's life this contrast of the day world and the night
world lay at the back of his thinking and feeling, influencing it,
perplexing it. As he grew older, however, the two worlds seemed to
interpenetrate more and more, until at last he found that there was a
day view of everything and a night view also. But which was the true
view? Perhaps the night view of things was in fact just nightmare, a
bad dream. But then perhaps it was the other way round. Perhaps the
whole day universe was just a foolish dream of the eternal foetus
imprisoned in the eternal womb. In early days, of course, Paul never
thought of the problem in this way, but I myself could see how the
obscure movements of his mind were related to the forgotten experience
of birth.</p>

<p>There was one aspect of the night which seemed even to the child
Paul very different from the night which imprisoned him in bed, namely
the starry sky. He seldom saw it, but even a brief glimpse of it would
have lasting effect on him. It gave him a sort of calm elation which
fortified him against the terrors of darkness, and would sometimes even
last into the next day, soothing his troubles and tempering his joys.
This experience, which played an important part in Paul's life, was not
simply a spontaneous outcome of his own nature. It was in part due to
my presence in his mind, though in part also to his native disposition.
Throughout his life, these occasions on which he was able to regard the
night sky had a very considerable effect on me, the imprisoned and
often fatigued observer of all his experience. They afforded me
refreshing glimpses of something common to his world and my own. When I
had become too deeply immersed in the minutiae of Paul's behaviour, and
was beginning to feel your world more real than mine, the sight of the
stars, even through the inefficient eyes of a member of your species,
would recall to me with great vividness the Neptunian plains and dwarf
jungles, the sky-piercing towers and bland inhabitants of my own
far-future world. This vivid recollection would rekindle in me the
still, flame-like ardour which is the spirit of our doomed but
unperturbed community. And the serene emotion which then surged through
me would infect Paul also, lending a tone to his experience, which,
though he could never properly account for it, he came in time to
recognize as in some manner a gift from a source beyond his mundane
nature. I well remember the hush of surprise and gurgle of delight with
which the child Paul first greeted the stars. He was in his mother's
arms. He stretched out his own fat arms and turned his head slowly from
side to side, surveying the heaven. On another occasion, much later,
when he was being brought home from a Christmas party, so tired that he
could hardly walk, a brilliant night sky overpowered him so that he
burst into tears of uncomprehending joy.</p>

<p>As the years advanced, Paul's sense that the starry night was
present even by day became an increasing influence in his life. This
was partly my doing; for I soon found that by giving him visual images
of the night sky in the midst of mundane situations I could help him to
regard the affairs of himself and his companions with Uranian
detachment. There was an early stage in his development when, through
this action of mine, he came to think of the universe as a sandwich
made of the upper and nether night, with, between them, the meat of
day. Below was the horrible darkness and confusion and closeness which
he encountered in his stuffy bedroom. Above was the high mystery of the
stars. Between was the world of familiar things.</p>

<p>This middle world had already spread outwards to become a vague
expanse of countries, embracing somewhere beyond the familiar streets
all kinds of wonders, which were nevertheless definitely day-time
wonders. Somewhere there was India, full of tigers, elephants, jewelled
princes, and jugglers. Elsewhere lay Iceland, all solid ice, with
rivers of fire running down the crystal volcanoes. Then there was
France, where they ate frogs and snails and were terribly polite;
Germany, where they made cheap copies of English toys, and fought
duels; Greece, where they wore no clothes except helmets with
clothes-brushes on them; Egypt, all mummies and crocodiles; Fairyland,
where magic happened more easily than in England. Yet even in England,
magic was not unknown. There was Santa Claus, and dozens of lucky and
unlucky things to be sought and avoided.</p>

<p>Over the whole world of countries hung the sky, a blue or cloudy
ceiling. Here a discrepancy entered into Paul's universe. If you
thought about it from the day-time point of view, you believed that
beyond the sky and the stars there was heaven, full of winged angels in
nightgowns, their eyes always turned upwards. And above them again was
God, whom Paul had somehow come to think of as a huge grown-up,
sprawling from horizon to horizon, and looking down precisely at Paul,
with eyes that saw even his thoughts. Somehow those eyes were the same
as the Eye that stared at him in the nether darkness of his bedroom.
When Paul remembered the Eye by day, he would repeat rapidly, 'Oh God,
I love you, I love you, I love you.'</p>

<p>But if you thought of things from the point of view of the starry
night, God and the angels did not seem to fit in very well. Paul half
believed that they were pictures painted on the ceiling of the day
world.</p>

<p>In time, of course, Paul's day world ceased to be flat, and became a
huge ball. At this stage the universe was more like a dumpling than a
sandwich. Vaguely Paul still conceived the three levels of existence.
The nether night was deep down within the ball of the day world. The
starry night was all around it. On the ball were all the countries
except Fairyland, which was nowhere. Many of the countries were British
Possessions, and red. At school he learned much about England and the
Empire, and became a patriot. The English were--well, English. They had
the greatest empire in the world. They were the only people who played
fair in games, and were kind to animals, and could govern black people,
and fight a losing battle to the end, and rule the seas. And because
they were such fine people, God had hidden a lot of coal and iron under
their country, so that they could use it for ships and engines and for
making thousands of things that other countries were not clever enough
to make for themselves. God had also written the Bible in English,
because it was the best language, and the angels talked it.</p>

<p>Paul's patriotism was largely an affectation. At this time he had a
great longing to be like his fellows, and his fellows made it very
obvious that they were patriotic. Also he found in patriotism a source
of self-gratulation. Somehow or other, through patriotism, the worm
that was the ordinary Paul became one of the lords of the earth. But
there was also another factor at work. He had already begun to feel an
obscure impulse to devote himself to ends beyond private gratification.
Much of this sadly misconceived yearning for lofty ends was expressed
in bragging about his school and vilifying other schools; but the
Empire afforded it a more imposing object.</p>

<h3>iii. EARLY EXPERIMENTS ON PAUL</h3>

<p>Not until Paul was already at school did I begin to exercise a
deliberate influence over him. My aim was to prepare him to attain in
early maturity as complete an insight as possible into the Neptunian
view of Terrestrial affairs. In his early years I seldom influenced
him, but the rare occasions on which I did so had a deep effect on him.
They were designed to intensify his consciousness beyond the normal
limitations of his species. By goading and delicately controlling his
attention I contrived to make him startlingly aware, now and again, of
data which commonly lie beyond the apprehension of the First Men. The
scope of my early work upon him might be described by saying that I
forced him to a more vivid sense of the reality and uniqueness of
perceptual objects, of himself, of others as selves, and also of his
own underlying unity with others, and of his own participation in the
cosmos.</p>

<p>For instance, to deal with the simplest matter first, Paul once
found a curious green pebble. He picked it up and examined it intently,
noting with delight its veining, its smooth curvature, its rigidity. He
turned it about, fingered it, tapped it. Then suddenly I flooded him
with a spate of relevant imagery, visual and tactual, so that he seemed
to encounter in this one pebble the whole splendour of sight, the whole
poignancy of touch. The thing suddenly leapt at him with its unveiled
reality. The change in his experience was as impressive as the change
from imagery to actual perception, from picturing a friend's face to
actually seeing it. It was as though the earlier experience, which at
the time seemed normally vivid, had been after all but a shadowy
imagination of a pebble, compared with the later experience, which was
an actual apprehension of an objective reality. It was over in a
moment. Paul dropped the pebble and collapsed on the grass, holding his
head in his hands. For a moment he thought someone had thrown a pebble
at him and that it had gone right through his head. He opened his eyes.
Everything seemed ordinary again. Then he caught sight of the pebble,
half-hidden under a dandelion leaf. It was just a little round green
thing, but it seemed to look at him meaningly. As they regarded one
another, Paul and the pebble, Paul felt the pebble rushing at him
again. He covered his eyes and sat for a long while thinking of nothing
but his splitting head. He had been rather badly hurt, but also he was
intrigued. The effect was something like his forgotten experience of
birth, a confusion of shock, pain, brilliant novelty, fear of the
unknown, and exhilaration.</p>

<p>Paul spent the next two days in bed with a 'bilious headache'. When
he was recovered, he went in search of his pebble. He picked it up
almost as though it were a live bomb, but though it raised a vivid
memory of the adventure, it gave him no fresh experience.</p>

<p>I repeated this experiment on Paul at rare intervals and in relation
to very diverse objects, such as his precious knife, the tolling of a
bell, a flying hawk, and his own hand. The last entailed a whole week
in bed, for not only had he perceived his hand externally as he had
perceived the pebble, he had also perceived it from within; and
moreover he had been fascinated by his volitional control of it. It was
a little grubby brown hand with black-rimmed nails and many scratches.
He turned it about, bending and straightening the fingers, confidently
willing it to perform various antics, intensely aware of his own fiat,
yet not at all self-conscious in any deeper sense.</p>

<p>Through my influence Paul continued to suffer these experiences
throughout his childhood. He became accustomed to them, and to look
forward to them with mingled dread and zest. At length I judged him
ripe for a different kind of experiment. He had been coveting a minute
bronze dog which belonged to one of his companions. He tried to
persuade the owner to 'swop' it, but in vain. Paul became more and more
obsessed, and finally stole the dog. While he was guiltily playing with
it in his own house I played a trick on him. I gave him an intense and
detailed visual image of his friend rummaging frantically among his
toys for the lost dog. So aggressive did this image become that it
blotted out Paul's actual environment. It had, moreover, the
intensified reality that he had first encountered in the pebble. Paul's
reaction was strange. For a moment he stared at the hallucination,
while hatred welled within him. Then, as soon as the vision had faded,
he rushed into the street and dropped the little bronze figure down a
grid. Henceforth he treated his former friend with shocking spite,
mingled with terror.</p>

<p>I did not attempt to influence Paul's slowly dawning awareness of
self till he was already well advanced in boyhood. One day, after he
had been bathing with his favourite schoolfellow, the two boys, naked,
wet, gleaming in the sunlight, had a friendly wrangle over a towel.
They tugged in opposite directions, shouting and panting. For a moment
they stood still, staring into one another's eyes. Suddenly I
re-kindled in Paul all his past groping realizations of the difference
between himself and the other, all his past obscure awareness of 'me'
and 'you'. I focused, so to speak, the whole vague illumination of this
mass of experience upon the present moment. As formerly the pebble and
his hand, so now his friend and his own being, impinged upon him with
overwhelming reality. It was a reality not alone of visual and tactual
form but also of experiencing. Through my manipulation of his imagery
he seemed to enter imaginatively into the mind of the other, to have
the feel of a different being, in a different body. A fly settled on
the other's neck. Paul felt it tickle, and felt the quick contortion
that sent it away. Through the other's eyes he seemed to see his own
intent face, and his own arms lightly pulling at the towel. He began
murmuring to himself, 'I, Paul; you, Dick; I, Dick; you, Paul.' And
through Dick's eyes he seemed to see his own lips moving. Through
Dick's ears and through his own ears also he heard his own voice. Dick,
meanwhile, had seen the sudden intensity of Paul's expression, and was
alarmed. Paul saw, and vividly experienced, Dick's alarm. They dropped
the towel. Paul reached out a hand and felt Dick's shoulder, as
formerly he had felt the pebble. 'Odd!' he said, 'I've waked up. I do
sometimes. But never quite this way before.' Dick began to question,
but Paul went on, 'I sort-of woke to be really me. Then I was you. And
both of us at once. Did it happen to you too?' Dick shook his head,
very perplexed. Then came the headache. Paul dropped, and lay
whimpering, with his hands over his eyes.</p>

<p>My next experiment was performed during a violent quarrel between
Paul and Dick. Paul had spent a free afternoon making a boat. He was
hollowing it with a gouge borrowed from Dick. Dick arrived to demand
the gouge, which was long overdue, and was needed for hollowing his own
boat. Paul, intent on his work and eager to finish it before tea,
refused to surrender the tool. They wrangled, while Paul carried on his
work. Dick tried to stop him. At this moment I forced on Paul a vivid
apprehension of the other boy, and of his craving to have his tool, and
of his rage against Paul. Paul stopped working. Once more he seemed for
a moment to be Dick, and to see his own ugly scowl through Dick's eyes.
For a moment Paul hung paralysed in a mental conflict. Then suddenly he
jabbed Dick's hand with the gouge. Both boys screamed with Dick's pain.
Paul rushed toward the door, crying, 'Beast, get out of me, you taste
horrid.' Before he reached the door he vomited. Then he fled, yelling.
He carried off the gouge.</p>

<p>This reaction of Paul's was very typical of his species. His brief
insight into the other's point of view merely filled him with
resentment. Typical also was his subsequent remorse, which tortured him
during his period of illness after this experiment. Dick had been
thoroughly frightened. It seemed to him that Paul had gone mad.</p>

<p>In time, however, the friendship was restored, and even deepened;
for Paul now treated Dick with a gentleness and understanding beyond
his years. Occasionally I induced in him the more vivid apprehension of
his friend and himself, but I carefully refrained from doing so when
their interests were violently opposed.</p>

<p>In this way I produced in Paul a self-insight and insight into
others which is very unusual in your species. His rare abnormal
experiences now coloured his whole life, and sowed in him the seed of a
lifelong conflict between the behaviour natural to his kind and the
behaviour which his enhanced insight demanded. When he found himself
forced to choose between the two, he almost always acted in the baser
way, though afterwards he was bitterly remorseful. Once or twice,
however, things turned out differently. I will give one example.</p>

<p>Paul was one of those timid boys who is a constant temptation to the
bully. When any bullying was afoot in which Paul himself was not
involved, he always took care not to interfere. Sometimes he would
actually try to ingratiate himself with the stronger party. One winter
day at school, when Paul and a few others of his form were supposed to
be doing their' preparation', the arch bully of the form began
tormenting a little Jew whom Paul intensely disliked. The smaller boys,
with Paul among them, looked on, applauding now and then with anxious
giggles. I chose this moment for an experiment. With dismay Paul felt
his cursed imagination beginning to work. He tried to bury himself in
his French exercise, but vainly. Do what he would, he could not help
entering imaginatively into 'that beastly little Jew'. Then he started
being not only the Jew but the bully also. He imagined the big lout
feeling the helpless self-disgust which he himself had felt in his one
experiment in the art of bullying. I worked up this imagination till he
really apprehended the mind of the bully far better than the bully
himself. He realized vividly the drowsy, fumbling, vaguely distressed
and frightened life that was going on in that hulk of flesh, and was
disguised even from itself by the pose of braggartism. Suddenly Paul
said aloud in a clear but dreamy voice, 'Chuck it, Williams, you're
hurting yourself.' There was a sudden silence of amazement. Paul,
terrified at his own voice, bowed over his French book. The bully
remarked, 'Your turn next', and then applied himself once more to his
victim, who squealed. Paul rose, crossed the floor, laid a hand on the
bully's shoulder, and was sent crashing into the hearth. He sat for a
moment among the cinders listening to the general laugh. Then slowly he
rose, and slowly surveyed his grinning fellow-mortals. Williams gave an
extra twist to the Jew's arm, and there followed a yell, Paul, saying
quietly, 'Williams, you've got to stop', put his own left hand into the
fire and picked out a large completely redhot coal. Ignoring the pain
and the smell of his burning flesh, he went over to Williams and said,
'Now, clear out or I'll brand you,' Someone tried to seize Paul's arm,
He used his coal with effect, so that the other retired, Then he rushed
at Williams, The bully fled. I felt Paul's eyebrows rise and his lips
twist in a whimsical smile, He stood dreaming for a moment, then
restored the still faintly glowing coal to its place in the fire,
Suddenly he caught sight of the charred and smoking mess that was his
hand. All along he had been aware of the pain, but he had calmly
ignored it. But now that the incident was completed, ignoring was
impossible. His strange exaltation vanished. He gave one sharp scream,
half for pain, half for surprise, and then fainted. Paul's hand
recovered within a few weeks, though of course it remained scarred for
ever. Paul's mind was more deeply affected. He was terrified about
himself. He felt that he had been possessed, and he dreaded being let
in for even worse scrapes in the future. All the same, he was rather
proud of himself, and half-wished he could be like that always.</p>

<h3>iv. PAUL'S CHANGING WORLD</h3>

<p>During his schooldays Paul suffered more than the normal growing
pains, for his mind was shooting upward in response not only to normal
but to abnormal influences. He was outgrowing not only toys and
childish interests; he was outgrowing the world which school life
imposed upon him, Like a crab that has become too big for its shell and
must struggle out of it, Paul was now too big for his world. It had
cracked under the stress of his vital movement, and he was in the act
of issuing from it in a soft vulnerable, but flexible and expansible
covering, which some day would harden into a new and ampler
dwelling-place.</p>

<p>Two conflicting influences dominated him at school, the impulse to
assume the stereotyped' schoolboy' nature and live comfortably in the
schoolboy world, and in opposition to this the impulse to find himself
and to find reality. He strove to live according to the schoolboy
ethic, partly because he genuinely admired it, partly so as to assume
the protective colouring of his surroundings. But he could never
succeed. The forces at work within him were too strong for him. In his
early schooldays Paul never clearly understood that he was trying to
live two inconsistent lives at once. He did not know that, while he was
so earnestly trying to adjust himself to the school universe, he was
also trying to burst that universe apart and grow an entirely new
universe to suit the expanding tissues of his mind.</p>

<p>This growth, or rather this profound metamorphosis, was controlled
by certain experiences which had an enduring effect on him. They were,
so to speak, the centres of reorganization which, little by little,
changed the larval Paul into the adult imago. These seminal experiences
were of two kinds, though he did not clearly distinguish between them.
His attention was arrested, and he was stung into excited admiration by
two widespread facts: by the intricacy and relentlessness of physical
happenings, and also by biological perfection, or at least functional
perfection of every sort.</p>

<p>Paul's sense of the austerity of the physical universe awoke early.
Even in the nursery he had conceived an uncomprehending respect for the
mechanism of natural events. This spontaneous movement of piety toward
'nature' developed not only into a strong scientific interest, but also
into strangely exultant awe, for which there seemed to be no rational
justification.</p>

<p>It was his father who first pointed out to him the crossing
wave-trains of a mountain tarn, and by eloquent description made him
feel that the whole physical world was in some manner a lake rippled by
myriads of such crossing waves, great and small, swift and slow. This
little significant experience took place during a holiday spent on the
Welsh moors. They were standing on a crag overlooking the grey 'llyn'.
They counted five distinct systems of waves, some small and sharp, some
broad and faint. There were also occasional brief 'cat's paws'
complicating the pattern. Father and son went down to the sheltered
side of the lake and contemplated its more peaceful undulations. With a
sense almost of sacrilege, Paul stirred the water with his stick, and
sent ripple after ripple in widening circles. The father said, 'That is
what you are yourself, a stirring up of the water, so that waves spread
across the world. When the stirring stops, there will be no more
ripples.' As they walked away, they discussed light and sound and the
rippled sky, and the sun, great source of ripples. Thus did an
imaginative amateur anticipate in a happy guess the' wave mechanics'
which was to prove the crowning achievement of the physics of the First
Men. Paul was given to understand that even his own body, whatever else
it was, was certainly a turmoil of waves, inconceivably complex but no
less orderly than the waves on the tarn. His apprehension of this novel
information was confused but dramatic. It gave him a sense of the
extreme subtlety and inevitability of existence. That even his own body
should be of this nature seemed to him very strange but also very
beautiful. Almost at the outset, however, he said, 'If my body is all
waves, where do I come in? Do I make the waves, or do the waves make
me?' To this the father answered, with more confidence than lucidity,
'You are the waves. What stirs is God.'</p>

<p>This experience remained with Paul for ever. It became for him the
paradigm of all physical sciences, and at the same time an epitome of
the mystery of life. In his maturity he would often, when he came upon
still water, pause to disturb its serenity. The little act would seem
to him darkly impious yet also creative. He would mutter to himself,
'God stirs the waters.' Sometimes he would take a handful of little
stones and throw them into the pond, one after the other in different
directions. Then he would stand motionless, watching the intersecting
circles spread and fade and die, till at last peace was wholly
restored.</p>

<p>Paul's first view of the moon through his father's modest telescope
was another memorable experience. He had already seen a ship
disappearing below the horizon, and had been told that the earth and
the moon were round. But actually to see the rotund moon, no longer as
a flat white shilling, but as a distant world covered with mountains,
was an experience whose fascination he never outgrew. Throughout his
life he was ready to gaze for ten minutes at a time through telescope
or field-glass at the bright summits and black valleys along the line
between lunar night and day. This vision had a startling power over him
which he himself could not rationally justify. It would flash
mysteriously upon him with bewildering and even devastating effect in
the midst of some schoolboy activity, in the midst of a Latin lesson,
or morning prayers, or a game of cricket, or a smutty story. Under the
influence of this experience he began to devour popular astronomy
books. He looked with new eyes at the first page of the school atlas,
which had hitherto meant nothing to him. Rapidly the school-boy
universe ceased to be the whole real universe, and was reduced to a
very faulty picture of a tiny comer of a universe which teemed with
suns and inhabited worlds. For at this stage he imagined that every
star was attended by a dozen or so populous planets.</p>

<p>He was perplexed to find that most adults, though many of them fully
believed in some such universe, did nothing with the knowledge. That
which to him was so significant was to them either tiresome or
terrifying. Even his father, who had helped him to discover the new
world, did not seem to appreciate it as it deserved. To the father it
did indeed seem wonderful. He called it 'sublime'. But for him it
remained merely a sublime irrelevance. It compelled his attention, and
in a manner his admiration also; but the tone of his voice, when he was
talking of it, suggested a veiled reluctance, almost resentment. He
seemed, in spite of all his scientific interest, to be happier and more
at home in the world of the Iliad or of the 'Faerie Queene '. The son,
on the other hand, though he did his best to appreciate these dream
worlds, was never moved by them. But the stars gave him an intense
exhilaration, which, when he tried to justify it to his father, turned
out to be, or to seem, wholly irrational.</p>

<p>Another overwhelming fact that gradually emerged into the child
Paul's ken, partly through the help of his father, partly through his
own unaided apprehension, was what he came later to call' the aliveness
of all living things '. His boon companion of early days had been a
terrier, with whom he used surreptitiously to share his bread and
butter, bite by bite. Of course he believed that this creature had a
mind much more like his own mind than was actually the case; but also,
by long experience of this animal, he learned to enter into imaginative
sympathy with a mind that was not human. This canine friendship drove
deep into his own mind and heart both a sense of the kinship of all
living things and a sense of their differences. Though Jack could enter
into a romp, he could never be induced to play trains. Nor could he be
persuaded that rabbits were beings like himself, whose lives should be
respected. Paul himself, of course, had to make that discovery; but
even in his earliest fly-tormenting and beetle-crushing phase he was
already making it. Later there came a stage when this mystery of alien
lives was his chief absorption and his chief perplexity. He would watch
ants toiling through the grass-jungle with food for the public store,
or 'talking' to one another as they met on one of their highways, or
fighting to the death in organized battle. Always, of course, he
imputed far too much of human intelligence to these strange beings. But
even when at a much later date he discovered this error, he remained
firm in his sense of their fundamental community with himself. Even
worms, exploring the soil with their blind noses, seemed to him
infinitely more like himself than the soil they devoured. And when one
of them was snapped up by a thrush, Paul suffered an agony of
indecision, debating whether to save the worm or let the bird have its
dinner in peace. When he saw a cat with a mouse, he rushed indignantly
to the rescue; yet somehow, after the event, he fell to wondering if he
had merely been meddlesome.</p>

<p>In short, during this phase of his growth he was overwhelmed with
what some would call a mystical apprehension of the inner being of all
living things, and shocked by their insensitivity to one another, their
essential harmfulness to one another. He was troubled by the fact that
he himself ate meat and wore leather boots, and amazed that even
kind-hearted persons, who doted on their own pets, did likewise without
any hesitation. He was still more distressed by a streak of real sadism
which survived in himself. At one time he used to catch wasps and cut
them in two, so as to observe the strange behaviour of the parts. Worse
still was his reaction to stag-hunting. His rare excursions into the
world of sport did not occur until he was in his last year at school.
They ceased while he was at the University. A well-to-do and much
respected friend of his father sometimes invited Paul to spend part of
the summer holidays at his house in Devon. He taught Paul to ride, and
was determined to make a sportsman of him. When the lad was considered
proficient, he was taken out to follow the hounds. With a sickening
guiltiness, a sickening sense of his own bad horsemanship, with a
sickening blend of adulation and contempt for the rest of the field, he
let himself be bumped over moors and through covers, down lanes and
through villages, till surprisingly he found himself in at the death.
There at last was the stag, chin-deep in a river, or slithering on the
roof of some outhouse in a village street, or more majestically at bay
in the angle of two hedges. Then Paul exulted, even while he sickened
with shame and pity. Why did he do it? he wondered. Why did he stand
there watching the great weary beast mauled by the hounds, while the
huntsmen tried to grab one of its antlers from behind? And when the
knife went home, why did he feel, just for a fraction of a second, a
sudden glee and triumph? Why was he so anxiously self-complacent as he
stood at his horse's head chewing cake and apples, while the stag was
disembowelled and the hounds clamoured for their share? Why did he so
desire to be taken for one of these sporting gentry, these overgrown
schoolboys? These questions remained for Paul unanswered. Clearly his
larval nature was making a desperate effort to reject the more
developed mentality that I was forcing on him. In spite of his
incompetence, he felt toward the sporting English gentleman not merely
respect and envy but a deep kinship. In his revulsion against the
primeval hunter and fighter, and aristocrat, he was divided against
himself. Essentially the same conflict racked him a few years later
when the war forced him to choose once and for all between the two
allegiances. But of course in his war-perplexity, the primitive motive
was reinforced by much that was by no means primitive.</p>

<h2>4 PAUL COMES OF AGE</h2>

<blockquote>i. PAUL AND SEX<br>
ii. PAUL DEVOUT<br>
iii. PAUL FACES THE FACTS</blockquote>

<h3>i. PAUL AND SEX</h3>

<p>I HAVE now to describe Paul's advance from boyhood to early manhood,
which he reached just before the outbreak of the European War. In order
to do this I must tell chiefly of his changing reactions to three facts
in his experience, namely to sex, to personality, and to the immense
impersonal.</p>

<p>As I have already said, Paul discovered early in his childhood that
a very special and delectable experience could be obtained from that
part of his body on which his elders had conferred a most intriguing
mystery. Their dropped voices, their hesitations, their veiled
suggestions and warnings, had long ago roused his curiosity and
prepared him to feel guilt in his new pleasure. Later, during
adolescence, the natural development of his body, combined with the
influence of stories and drawings circulated at school, increased his
itch of experimentation in this field. His own sensitivity, which had
been exaggerated by my influence, made him peculiarly susceptible.</p>

<p>In this new experience Paul found something unique, arresting,
mysteriously significant, yet significant of he knew not what. I
myself, the observer of these disturbing events, can only describe the
character which he seemed to himself to find in them, by calling it an
impression of almost mystical fulfilment, or of communion with some
presence, or being, or power, wholly beyond the grasp of this
intellect. It was as though he had unexpectedly discovered how to reach
down and touch the deep, living heart of reality, and as though this
contact were to quicken him through and through with an exquisite,
though deadly thrill. The experience was all too brief, and after it
came a vague fear. In the very act it seemed to be promising more than
it could ever give. That fleeting contact with the heart of things was
but an earnest, seemingly, of some more profound and lasting
penetration, not yet to be achieved.</p>

<p>Now this attainment and this promise were not wholly illusory. To
minds that have passed far beyond your stage of growth, every sensory
experience whatever may afford this exquisite, inebriating sense of
contact with objective reality. More primitive minds, however, seldom
attain this insight. For them it is only when the sensuous has the
added glamour of rarity, or of sin and sanctity, that it can deliver
its full content. And so the amazed spirit falsely assumes that only
through this one particular sensory window can it reach out and touch
reality. Among you the sexual experience alone has universally this
unique significance and power. For in you, as in the apes, almost alone
among mammals, reproductive potency is constant and excessive. And in
nearly all your cultures the consequent excessive interest in sex has
been thwarted, in most cases very clumsily.</p>

<p>In Paul's case it soon became clear that, unless I intervened, the
mystery and horror with which sex was treated would cause in him an
obsessive fascination. His plight is well enough expressed in a poem
which he wrote at this time, but showed to no one. I should explain
that henceforth he was frequently to indulge in what he regarded as
poetical expression. I shall occasionally quote from his writings to
illustrate his spiritual progress. Note that even at this early stage
he was deserting the forms of verse that were still orthodox. Here is
the poem.</p>

<pre>
SIN&gt;

I have touched filth.
Only with the finger tip I touched it.
inquisitive of the taste of it.
But it creeps.
It has spread over my body a slime.
and into my soul a stupor.
It is a film over the eyes.
blurring the delicate figuring and ethereal hue of things.
It clogs the ears.
The finer tones of truth are muffled from me.
Beauty has turned her back on me.
I have shamed her, I am desolate.
There is no escape from myself.
And in my loneliness,
It was because of my mad loneliness,
I touched again.
I dabbled for a moment in the sweet filth.
and fled back shuddering in the silence.
Presently I shall slink down again and wallow.
for solace in my mad loneliness.
</pre>

<p>One of the most difficult facts for the Neptunian explorer to grasp
about primitive minds is their obsession and their abject guilt and
disgust in respect of bodily appetites. In the constitution of the last
human species the excess energy of these appetites is very largely
sublimated, innately, into the spiritual and intellectual life. On the
other hand, whenever they do demand direct satisfaction, they are
frankly and zestfully gratified. In Paul's species it was the sexual
appetite that caused trouble. Now it did not suit me that Paul should
become tangled inextricably in sex. His whole generation, I knew, was
going to develop along the lines of sex mania, in revulsion from the
prudery of its predecessors. But it was necessary that Paul should
maintain a true balance, so that his spirit's energies should be free
to direct themselves elsewhere.</p>

<p>The method by which I brought peace to Paul's troubled mind was easy
to me, though disturbing to him. Whenever he began to worry himself
with guilty fears, I would force upon his imagination scenes from
another world, in which not sex but nutrition was the deed of supreme
uncleanness and sanctity. Little by little I pieced together in his
mind a considerable knowledge of an early Neptunian species whose
fantastic culture has many points in common with your own. Let me here
tell you briefly of that culture.</p>

<p>On Neptune, then, there once lived, or from your point of view,
there will live, a race of human beings which attained a certain
aflluence and social complexity, but was ever hampered by its morbid
interest in nutrition. By what freakish turns of fortune this state of
affairs was brought about, I need not pause to describe. Suffice it
that physiological changes had produced in this human species an
exaggerated mechanism of hunger. This abnormality saddled all its
members with a craving for food much in excess of biological need; and
from the blundering social repression of this craving there arose a
number of strange taboos and perversions. By the time this Neptunian
species had attained civil life, the function of nutrition had become
as perverse and malignant as the function of reproduction in your own
society. No reference might be made to it in public, save to its
excretory side, which was regarded as a rite of purification. Eating
became a private and vaguely obscene act. While in many social
situations sexual intercourse was a recognized means of expression and
diversion, and even drinking was permitted in the less puritanical
circles so long as it was performed through the nose, eating in the
presence of another person was not tolerated. In every home a special
privy was set aside for eating. This was stocked during the night by
the public food carriers, who constituted the lowest caste of society.
In place of your chastity ideal there arose a fiction that to refrain
from eating was virtuous, and that the most holy persons could live
without eating at all. Even ordinary folk, though pardoned for
occasional indulgence, were supposed to refrain from the filthy act as
far as possible. Repressed nutrition had by now coloured the Whole life
of the race. The mouth occupied in its culture much the same position
as the phallus with you. A vast and subtle symbolism, like that which
in your culture is associated with the sacred and obscene reproductive
act, was generated in this case by the sacred and obscene nutritive
act. Eating became at once a sin and an epitome of the divine power;
for in eating does not the living body gather into itself lifeless
matter to organize it, vitalize it? The mouth was, of course, never
exposed to view. The awful member was concealed behind a little modesty
apron, which was worn below the nose. In prehistoric times the lips had
formed the chief visual stimulus to sexual interest, and like the rump
of the baboon had developed lavish coloration and turgescence. But very
early in the cultural development of the species the modesty apron
became universal. Even when the rest of the body was unclad, this
garment was retained. And just as in your culture the notorious
fig-leaf is vaguely suggestive of that which it conceals, so, in this
Neptunian culture, the conventionally decorated covering of the mouth
came to mimic furtively the dread orifice itself. Owing to the fact
that in polite society no sound might be made which betrayed movement
of the lips, speech became distorted and debased. One curious
consequence of this obscenity of the mouth was the peculiar status of
kissing. Though sexual promiscuity was almost universal, kissing was a
deadly sin, except between man and wife. A kiss, bestowed in privacy
and darkness, was the true consummation of marriage, and was something
infinitely more desirable and more disturbing than the procreative act
itself. All lovers longed to be united in a kiss; or, if they were
innocents, they looked for some unknown fulfilment, which they vaguely
and guiltily felt must be somehow connected with the mouth. Coitus they
regarded merely as an innocent and peculiarly delightful caress; but
the kiss was the dark, exquisite, sacred, mystically significant,
forbidden fruit of all their loving. It was a mutual devouring, the act
in which, symbolically, the lover took the substance of the other
within his or her own system. Through this connexion with romantic love
the kiss gathered to itself all that obscure significance of tender
personal relations, of spiritual communion between highly developed
personalities, which in your world the same romantic love may confer on
coitus. Further, since, like your Trobriand Islanders, the less
sophisticated races of this species were often ignorant of the
connexion between the sexual act and conception, and since, as with
those islanders, sexual intercourse outside the marriage bond often
failed to produce offspring, it was commonly believed in the more
primitive of these Neptunian societies that the true reproductive act
was the kiss. Consequently conception and child-birth came to be
endowed with the same mystery, sanctity, and obscenity as nutrition.
Sex, on the other hand, remained delightfully uncontaminated. These
traditions maintained their power even in civilized societies, which
had long ago realized the truth about parenthood. Children were
carefully instructed in the hygiene of sex, and encouraged to have
blithe sexual relations as soon as they needed that form of expression.
But in respect of nutrition they were left in disastrous ignorance. As
infants they were suckled, but in strict seclusion. Later they were
taken to the food-privy and fed; but they were trained never to mention
food in public and of course never to expose their mouths. Obscure and
terrifying hints were let fall about the disastrous effects of
gustatory self-indulgence. They were told not to go to the privy more
than once a day, and not to stay longer than necessary. From their
companions they gathered much distorted information about eating; and
they were likely to contract diverse kinds of nutritive perversion,
such as chewing stones and earth, biting one another or themselves for
the taste of blood. Often they contracted such a prurient mania of
thumb-sucking, that mouth and thumb would fester. If they escaped these
perversions, it was by means of ignorant licentiousness in the
food-privy. In consequence of this they were prone to contract serious
digestive disorders, which moreover, if discovered, inevitably brought
them into contempt. In either case they incurred a shattering sense of
guilt, and contracted by auto-suggestion many of the symptoms which
rumour attributed to their vice. In maturity they were likely to become
either secret gourmets or puritans.</p>

<p>The effect of introducing Paul to this remote world was beneficial
in more ways than one. Not only did it lead him gradually to regard his
own sexual nature with a new tolerance and a new detachment, so that
his mind was no longer tethered to the stake of sex; it also gave him a
considerable insight into the mentality of his elders, and opened his
eyes precociously to the farcical aspect of his species. Of course, he
did not seriously believe his visions. Or rather, as the alien world
embodied itself with increasing detail in his mind, he could not
entirely disbelieve it, but came to regard it as 'over there', instead
of 'here' like his own world. I had, of course, made him picture the
Neptunian species. He glimpsed its squat stone cities, thronged with
nude and bulky caricatures of his own race. He saw their mouth-aprons,
and their secret vices of nutrition. He saw also their frank sexual
behaviour, and actually from the study of sex in that remote age and
world he learned much about sex in his own race. Not only so, but he
learned his first lesson in that general detachment from the purely
Terrestrial values, which I needed to produce in him. He learned, too,
to scrutinize all prized and all condemned things to discover whether
they were prized or condemned for their own sakes or for some other
reason. For instance, comparing his fantasy world with the normal
world, he saw that sexual activity and nutritive activity were both
valued in both worlds, but that in each world one of these activities
had gathered a purely accidental and farcical significance. On the
other hand, in both worlds, love, the passionate admiration of spirit
for spirit, was a genuine experience which lent something of its glory
here to sex, there to nutrition.</p>

<p>Paul's mysterious life of imagination gave him an understanding of
human nature far beyond his years. Combining with his enhanced
self-consciousness, it made him strangely sympathetic yet strangely
cynical. His companions regarded him as 'queer'. At most times he
behaved as a rather selfish and rather cowardly boy, and he was not
incapable of spite. Yet at any moment, it seemed, he might blaze up
with what to his companions seemed an almost insane generosity and an
entirely self-oblivious courage. At other times he displayed a
disconcerting indifference and remoteness. In the middle of some wild
game he would suddenly 'fade out', play his part perfunctorily or not
at all, and presently be seen watching the action with an interest that
was somehow not the interest of a boy.</p>

<p>During his schooldays Paul was generally in love with some other boy
or with a girl. His erratic temperament prevented the course of true
love from running even as smoothly as it does with normal young human
animals. One day he would be terrifyingly earnest, next day entirely
uninterested, or, worse, interested in the manner of a scientific
observer. One day he would be possessive, touchy, spiteful, the next
day devoted and self-oblivious. Consequently his loves were uneasy,
brief, and in retrospect bitter. The more he was defeated, the more he
longed for a lasting intimacy. The more he longed, the more'
impossible' he became. During the latter part of his school career he
grew increasingly aware of and absorbed in human personality. It came
to seem to him that the only thing of any account in life was the
intimacy of one person with another, in fact with a perfect mate. His
whole attention was given to the task of finding for himself the
perfect mate. Gradually he began to realize that he would never
succeed, and indeed that success was almost impossible. It seemed to
him that human beings were doomed to miss for ever the only goal worth
seeking, and that in their fated striving for it they must ever
lacerate one another.</p>

<p>It was with this conviction that Paul ended his much-prolonged
school career and embarked upon an arts course at the University of
London. He was very unlike the ordinary 'freshman'. Some years older
than the average, cripplingly self-conscious, scholastically backward
and erratic, but equipped with a very unusual stock of random
knowledge, and of insight into human nature, he seemed to his fellows
an amiable but rather tiresome freak.</p>

<p>While he was still at the university Paul met a young woman some
years older than himself, whose image was destined to be a permanent
influence in his mind. From the Terrestrial point of view she was no
doubt a delightful creature, though not a paragon of classical or any
other recognized kind of beauty. Even to the Neptunian eye,
sufficiently fortified by long Terrestrial experience, she was not
without charm. Of course, very little of her was visible. Save for the
face and hands, her whole body was covered and insulted by the
peculiarly grotesque clothing of her period. But in her face there was
something more than the prettiness which attracted the males of her own
species and was a source of a certain winsome complacency in herself.
There was a vitality in it which to me was elusively reminiscent of the
full-blown and fully conscious beauty of women of my own species. In
fact, there was a hint of the more fully human and more frankly animal
spirit, which the Last Men look for in woman and the Last Woman in man.
But in the eyes of her contemporaries, and in her own eyes too, this
pervading characteristic of her face, of her slow free gait, and, as I
was later to discover, of her body also (about which there was
something of the young cart-horse), was but an oddity, a blemish. Now
Paul believed that he was attracted only by her conventional
prettiness. He did not know that my influence had inadvertently brought
him under the spell of a beauty beyond his usual ken, He prided himself
on being able, in spite of his adoration, to point out and ridicule her
imperfections, and even delight in them. He did not know that these
very 'imperfections' of body and mind were the source of her strange
spell over him, He recognized, almost apologetically, that they made
her for him lovelier, more individual, more real, more peculiarly
herself, He did not recognize, though in fact he obscurely felt, that
her peculiarity was not a falling short from, but a transcending of,
Terrestrial beauty. Mentally she was, he felt, exquisitely
complementary to himself, yet basically at one with him. She was able
to appreciate and enrich his inner life of fantasy, which hitherto he
had never revealed to anyone. She flattered him by regarding him as a'
genius', He was well content that she should treat him also as a dear
simpleton whose dreams were impracticable. Above all, he was
strengthened by the knowledge that each had become to the other a most
necessary playmate and helpmeet, and that each had already been
spiritually enriched by the other for ever after.</p>

<p>This girl, whom I will call Katherine, took delight in 'bringing
Paul out of his shell', in helping him to hold his own in social
intercourse. She taught him to dance; and, though the physical contact
made his head swim, he did her credit. They went to many dances, but
the custom of the period forbade them to dance together more than two
or three times in an evening. Dancing was at first their only
opportunity of close contact; for a strange reason. This fundamentally
downright and generous creature had unfortunately been educated in a
puritanical tradition. Through loyalty to her father, for whom, as I
later discovered, she felt a deep affection, she corseted her nature
within the limits of a strict social and moral etiquette. By native
constitution strong both in animal zest and in maternal tenderness, by
upbringing severely conscientious, she had tried to solve the
inevitable conflict between her generous vitality and her moral
severity by kindliness toward others and strictness toward herself.
Maintaining her own puritan conduct, she took vicarious delight in the
peccadilloes of others. It was partly her combination of romantically
puritanical idealism with imaginative sympathy that won Paul's respect.
Her relation with Paul was at first extremely correct. It had to
compensate for the restriction of its physical side by a romantic
efflorescence on the mental side. They found many intellectual and
aesthetic enthusiasms in common. They also inculcated in one another a
common zeal for social service. He swore that in the great cause of
making a better world he would 'wear always the armour of her love' so
that nothing should strike him down. His own love for her would be his
lance. Her beauty would be his inspiration, her sense of beauty his
guiding star. Theirs was a union, they told one another, primarily of
spirit and spirit. The body should fulfil its minor function, in due
season.</p>

<p>It was extremely interesting to see how Paul acted his part during
the first weeks of this intimacy. The detachment from Terrestrial
values which I had been teaching him, at first enabled him to ridicule
and damp down his cravings for a more sexual relationship. Neptunian
fantasies helped him here. But soon they began to work on the other
side also. He came to see the folly and futility of his romance.
Externally he remained for long the tame squire of his beloved; but
inwardly, though often he was a selfless admirer of this lovely human
animal that had confided in him, sometimes he was sheer greedy sex,
chafing within the bonds of decency. At other times, behind his
caresses he was ice-cold, or even disgusted, or just an ironical
observer, correlating events Terrestrial with events Neptunian. But for
long these great inner fluctuations appeared to the beloved only as
slight whimsical changes of mood, to which' with maternal tact she
gladly adjusted herself.</p>

<p>As time passed, however, Paul became more difficult'. Hitherto, in
spite of his moods, he had seemed to the young woman absolutely safe,
absolutely devoted to their common code of decency. His occasional
respectful importunity flattered her without seriously disturbing her.
But now his normal mood began to be penetrated with rather terrifying
moments in which his personality seemed to change to something at once
more cynical and more violent, more remote and more animal. Most
terrifying was the fact that, to her own amazement, she could not feel
disgusted, but only conscientious.</p>

<p>The crisis occurred on a summer evening after a dance. Paul and his
beloved, flushed with exertion and mutual delight and exalted by a
sense of their own daring unconventionality, escaped through the garden
to the bare down that fringed their suburb. Arm in arm they walked,
then seated themselves on the grass to watch the rising moon. After the
usual discreet caresses, Paul extended a reverent hand and stroked her
throat. His finger-tips ventured down to the white expanse of bosom,
revealed by her low-cut evening dress. Surprised less by his boldness
than by her own sudden delight, she caressed the caressing fingers. He
ventured further, feeling his way toward her breasts. Paralysed between
desire and anxiety, she allowed him to explore those warm, secret, holy
excrescences.</p>

<p>This little tactual event, this marvellous, ecstatic new experience,
affected both somewhat violently. For Paul it seemed to constitute an
important new stage in that quest which had so long tormented him, the
quest for reality. It seemed to fulfil, or almost fulfil, at once his
hunger for sexual contact and his yearning for spiritual intimacy. It
had about it a quality of home-coming after long absence, as though he
had been there before in some forgotten existence. It was indeed as
though the starved exile, who had for so long been nourished only on
phantoms, and had lost even the memory of his motherland, were to find
himself back once more in the bosom of reality, bewildered yet
fundamentally at home. In her it roused both sexual warmth and also a
poignant tenderness almost as of mother for babe. She was torn between
a sudden longing to give herself wholly and a sudden alarm at this
unprecedented invasion.</p>

<p>How distressed these two innocents would have been had they known
that a third person was witness of this shocking deed, that another
human being, a man older than Paul by some thousands of years (though
not to be born till long after the earth's destruction) was noting
through Paul's eyes the moonlit eyes and features of the girl, was
himself caressing, though through Paul's hand, the thrilled Terrestrial
breasts, and comparing them with corresponding objects upon Neptune!
All these data, and also Paul's own guilty swooning ecstasy, I observed
with sympathy born of the most intimate acquaintance, but also with
amusement and some impatience, in spite of the detachment and
remoteness of two thousand million years.</p>

<p>Even Paul himself was in a manner a detached spectator of his own
behaviour. He himself was in a manner standing outside himself and
observing these two young courting mammals. This detachment I myself
had induced in him. For already at this time of his life I had trained
him to be the calm spectator of his own reactions in every fervent
experience. In the present case it seemed good to emphasize certain
aspects of the matter for him. I therefore began to influence the
course of his thoughts. As he savoured the experience, he became
increasingly aware of a disturbing and fantastic under-current to his
delicious perceptions. He saw with the mind's eye an early Neptunian
couple engaged upon an act which to them was one of shocking
licentiousness and excruciating delight, but to the Terrestrial eye was
merely ridiculous. This guilty pair stood facing one another, their
mouth-aprons removed. From mouth to crimson mouth there stretched a
curious fruit, not unlike a much-elongated banana. With mobile lips
both he and she were drawing this object into the mouth, and eating it
progressively. They gazed into one another's kindled eyes, their cheeks
aflame. Clearly they were both enrapt in that exquisite sweet horror
which is afforded only by the fruit that is forbidden. Paul watched the
banana shrinking, the faces approaching one another. His own hand,
feeling the responsive breasts, paused, lay inert. The fruit had
vanished. The faces made contact in a long mumbling kiss. The vision
faded. Paul was left with an agonized conflict of the sublime and the
ridiculous, for it was evident to him that in this farcical scene he
had witnessed the exquisite union of two impassioned spirits.</p>

<p>For a moment Paul stayed motionless, wondering whether to an alien
eye he and Katherine would seem any less comic. Almost he decided to
withdraw his hand. But now that I had forced him in the very act of
single-minded zest to take an unsympathetic view, I was able to give
him an exaltation which was secure against ridicule because it included
ridicule. First I let him suffer in a single flash of insight the
stabbing pleasure of those two Neptunians. I then flooded his mind with
a spate of visions, such that he seemed to himself to be witnessing in
a few seconds the whole pageant of amorous adventure. He seemed to see
the earliest mutual devourings of microscopic jellies in the sea, the
far-flung pollination of great trees, slow reptilian embraces, the
aerial copulations of swallows, the rutting of stags, the apes' more
conscious amorousness. He saw human forms, brown, yellow, black or
white, in their first adventurous fondlings, or clipped together. He
saw them now in caves, now in jungle lairs, now in snow huts,
blubber-lit, now in lake dwellings, the water lapping the piles, now in
curtained Tudor four-posters, now in jangling iron bedsteads in slums,
now between fine linen sheets, now among the bushes of public gardens,
furtive, struggling with clothes, now beside moorland tams, the
untrammelled limbs sun-darkened, glossy. Throughout this experience
Paul retained a flavour of the earlier ludicrous scene over the
forbidden fruit; but he gathered also a new sense of the deep, groping
earnestness of sex. And this jerked him into one of his rare moods of
heightened consciousness. The little breast and nipple beneath his hand
suddenly revealed itself to him in a most poignant vision, and at the
same time the individual spirit of the girl (so it seemed) was laid
bare dazzlingly to his own spirit's gaze. He saw, moreover, that she
wanted what he also wanted.</p>

<p>But now the girl, sensing a change in his mood, and feeling that
something ought to be done, first pressed his hand upon her yielding
breast, and then tried to extricate it. Paul felt the soft flesh
crushed between his fingers. Exulting, he gripped, so vigorously that
she gave a little scream. Then suddenly she found herself caught in an
embrace that was altogether too frankly sexual to be tolerated. Yet, to
her own surprise, she yielded to it for a moment, savouring the new
experience. Then it became clear that if she was to preserve any longer
that which a virtuous young lady is supposed to cherish more than life
itself, she must take immediate action. She struggled, expostulated,
then suddenly, greedily, seized Paul's lip between her teeth. The pain
shot through him like lightning. His grip relaxed. They separated.
While he mopped his bleeding mouth, she arranged her clothing, swore
she would never see him again, and then retreated toward the house with
all the dignity she could muster.</p>

<p>But they continued to meet, for each had by now become necessary to
the other. The intimacy deepened. They became 'engaged', though for
financial reasons they had no prospect of marriage. They saw one
another every day. The solid basis of their friendship, their mental
insight into one another and joy in each other's natures, compelled
them to seek one another. But their love was becoming warped by the
longing for that final bodily intimacy which both craved, but she dared
not permit. To the Neptunian observer it was obvious that for both
their sakes she ought to have cut herself away from him once and for
all, or else to have yielded fully to her own desire and his. For the
former course she had no will The initial feminine reluctance, the
desire to preserve herself intact, had long since given place to the no
less feminine hunger to give herself and be merged with her chosen
male. But an irregular union would have been intolerable to her
self-respect. She was a child of her age, and her age was still in
spirit, though not in date, 'nineteenth century'. Though under Paul's
influence she had recently begun to modify her puritanism, and now
liked to think of herself as 'modern' and unconventional, there was a
point beyond which she dared not go.</p>

<p>The months passed. Paul became more and more obsessed. He thought of
nothing but love-making and his own unhappy situation It became
necessary that he should stagnate no longer; for the year 1914 was
approaching, in which he must be fully recovered from all the fevers of
adolescence. I therefore decided to interfere. Two courses were open to
me. Either I could make the girl give herself, or I could remove her.
From the Neptunian point of view the obvious course was to let Paul
have his way, and gain the little treasure of experience that would
thus be added to him. In many ways they would both have benefited. They
would have found new health and vigour of body, and for a while new
peace and vitality of mind. But I knew that, harmless and invigorating
as this culmination would have been for other individuals and in
another society, for these two young Terrestrials it would have brought
disaster. In the first place, they might have inadvertently produced a
new individual of their species; and then both mother and child, and
the young father also, would have been persecuted by the barbarian
society in which they lived. I judged that such an experience would
render Paul unfit for my experiment. It would have tethered his
attention for too long to the personal. Secondly, they would have
suffered a spiritual disaster, for they themselves both accepted the
code which they would have infringed. Had I driven them on to taste
their innocuous, pretty, forbidden fruit, they would soon have become a
burden to one another. With the inevitable cooling of ardour they would
have assumed a false obligation each to the other, and at the same time
they would have lapsed into guilty disgust, recriminations and moral
degradation. This would have side-tracked Paul's attention for too long
a period.</p>

<p>I therefore decided to remove the girl. To do this I had first to
enter her mind and discover how I might conveniently effect my purpose.
Poor child, she would indeed have been overwhelmed with shame and
horror had she known that for several weeks all her most private acts
and secret thoughts were observed by a hidden, an indwelling and a male
spectator. I was, for instance, present one Saturday night while she
lowered her still coltish body into a hot bath, tingling and gasping as
the heat devoured her. I detected her mind's quick backward glance at
Paul's devouring but unfulfilled embraces. I noted also that she let
the hot water flow and the temperature of the bath rise till she was on
the verge of agony, before she finally sat up and turned off the tap. I
was present also at her dreams, in which so often she let Paul have his
way, before she woke and was regretfully thankful it had only been a
dream.</p>

<p>A brief study of her personality sufficed to show just which of the
-young men in her environment would best suit her nature. I turned her
attention in his direction; rather roughly, I fear, for I noticed that
she began to have doubts of her sanity. In self-pride and in compassion
for Paul she clung for a while to the old love, but in vain. She
struggled desperately against her fate, bitterly ashamed of her
impotence and fickleness. But by a kind of inner hypnotism I forced her
to receive into her heart the image of the new love that I had chosen
for her. I made her dwell on his admirable and charming qualities, and
I blinded her to his somewhat grotesque appearance. Very soon I had
made her undertake a vigorous, almost shameless campaign upon him. Much
to his surprise and delight, much to the bewilderment of their mutual
friends, this unassuming but prosperous young merchant found himself
the adored adorer of one who hitherto had treated him merely with calm
kindness. I now filled the bemused young woman with immodest haste for
the wedding. Within a few weeks the pair did actually enter into a
union which, owing to my careful selection, was quite the most
successful marriage of their generation. I bore in mind, however, that
it would later become desirable to bring her once more into relation
with Paul.</p>

<p>While these events were proceeding I was in a sense resident in two
minds at once; for when I had done my work upon the girl, I returned to
Paul at the very instant in which I had left him. Thus I was able to
watch his reactions to the whole drama, and to help him triumph in his
defeat.</p>

<p>When first he had begun to suspect that she was turning away from
him, he plunged into a more determined suit. But I was now very
constantly treating him with visions and meditations of an impersonal
kind, which so drenched his wooing that it became less persuasive than
disturbing. In fact, by philosophical and poetical extravagances he
frightened Katherine into the arms of his rival. When at last he
learned of the marriage, he passed, of course, through a phase of
self-pitying despair; but within a fortnight he was already, through my
influence, no less than through native resilience, beginning to explore
a very different field of experience.</p>

<h3>ii. PAUL DEVOUT</h3>

<p>When Paul had recovered from the first shock of his misfortune, he
emerged to find himself painfully oscillating between two moods. In the
one he strove to protect his wounded soul under a bright new armour of
cynicism. She was just an animal, and her behaviour was the expression
of obscure physiological events. And so, after all, was his own. The
love that he so prized had no intrinsic virtue whatever. In the other
mood, however, he clung to the faith that though this love of his had
foundered, nevertheless love, the mutual insight and worship of one
human person for another, was good in itself, and indeed the supreme
good of life. All other goods, it seemed, 'were either negligible, or
instrumental to this greatest good. He had recently lived for many
weeks on a plane that was formerly beyond him. Now in his loneliness he
began to go over again and again the treasure that he had acquired,
namely his new and overwhelmingly vivid and delightful apprehension of
a particular human being, called Katherine. Bitter as was his
loneliness, this treasure could never be taken from him. And the more
he pored over it, the more he asked himself whether it was exceptional,
or whether it was a fair sample of existence. Hitherto he had
increasingly thought of the universe in terms of mechanical intricacies
and the huge star-sprinkled darkness, or at best in terms of a vital
but impersonal trend of all things toward some goal inconceivable to
man. But now he began to regard all this as mere aridity in which there
was no abiding place for the one superlative excellence, human
personality, love-inspired. It was borne in upon him at last with new
significance that love was' divine '. He began to find a new and lucid
meaning for the brave statement, 'God is Love '. It meant, surely, that
this best of all things known to man was also present in spheres beyond
man's sphere; that human personality and love were not the only nor the
highest forms of personality and love; that Love, with a capital L,
Love which was not merely a relation between persons but somehow itself
a Person, an all-pervading and divine Person, was after all the
governing power of the universe. If this were indeed so, as many
professed to believe, then all human loves must, in spite of temporary
frustration, be secure of eternal fulfilment. Even his love for
Katherine and her no less divine, though now distracted, love for him
must somehow, 'in eternity', have its fruition.</p>

<p>I must not here describe the struggle that took place in Paul's mind
between his cynical and his devotional impulses. It was a fluctuating
battle. Wandering along Gower Street, with his hands in the pockets of
his grey flannel trousers, and half a dozen books under his arm, he
would breathe in cheerfulness with the dilute spring air of London,
till, as he pursued his course round Bedford Square, God was once more
in his heaven. In Charing Cross Road he would stray into the 'Bomb
Shop', and be confronted with new doubts. Walking over the spot where
subsequently Nurse Cavell's monument was to proclaim her courage and
her countrymen's vulgarity, the poor boy would sometimes be infected by
a momentary and unintelligible horror, derived from my own foreseeing
mind. Soon the placid bustle of the great railway station would bring
comfort once more; but on the journey to his southern suburb he would
be flung again into despair by the faces of sheep, cattle, pigs and
monkeys that masked the spirits of his fellow-travellers. Then at last,
walking bare-headed on the suburban down that overhung his home, Paul
might once more, though rather wearily, believe in God.</p>

<p>It seemed to Paul that in his cynical mood he was definitely
smaller, meaner and more abject than when he was once more unfurling on
the battlements of his own heart the banner of his faith in the God of
Love. In many of his contemporaries also much the same fluctuation of
mood was occurring, and to them as to Paul it seemed that the issue lay
between the old faith, however modernized, and the complete abnegation
of human dignity. Yet Paul and his contemporaries were mistaken. It was
not in faith but in utter disillusionment and disgust that the human
spirit had to triumph, if ever it was to triumph at all.</p>

<p>While he was absorbed in his religious perplexity, Paul was
intrigued by a group of fellow-students whose aim it was to solve the
troubles of the modern world by making modern men and women into
sincere Christians. They introduced him to a young priest, whom the
whole group regarded as their spiritual leader. At first this young
man's emphatic hand-grip and earnest gaze roused in Paul nothing but a
new variant of the disgust and suspicion which, long ago, he had felt
toward the ghastly heartiness of the family doctor. He was also
repelled by the fact that the elect secretly referred to their master
as the Archangel. But as he became better acquainted with the priest,
he, like the others, began to fall under his spell. To Paul in his new
phase of reverence for human personality, his new revulsion from
'materialism', this man appeared as a spiritual aristocrat, as one who
could move about the world without being swallowed up by the world,
without so much as dirtying his feet. He was 'other-worldly', not in
the sense that he sought to escape from this world, but that he carried
round with him an atmosphere which was not this world's atmosphere.
Like those water-insects which take down with them into the deep places
a bubble of air for breathing, he took down with him into this world a
celestial ether to maintain his spiritual life.</p>

<p>So it seemed to Paul. But to his Neptunian guest the matter did not
appear in the same light. During Paul's love affair I had of course to
put up with much that was tedious and banal, but I had been constantly
refreshed by the underlying simplicity and sincerity of the amorous
couple. In the new incident, however, I had to watch Paul indulging in
a very tiresome self-deception. He allowed his admiration for the
person of this young priest to obscure his view of the universe. This
aberration was indeed a necessary phase in his growth, a necessary
process in the preparation of the experimental culture upon which I was
to operate. But it was none the less a tiresome phase for the observer.
Not that Paul's new enthusiasm was wholly misguided. Far from it. Even
from the Neptunian point of view, this 'Archangel' was indeed in a
limited sense a spiritual aristocrat, for undoubtedly he was gifted
with a vision and a moral heroism impossible to most of his fellows.
But he was an aristocrat debased by circumstance. He had not been able
to resist an environment which was spiritually plebeian. Though in his
life he faithfully expressed what he called the superhuman humanity of
his God, he almost wholly failed to do justice to another and more
austere feature of his own vision, a feature which indeed he never
dared fully to acknowledge, even to himself, since in terms of his own
religious dogma it appeared starkly as a vision of superhuman
inhumanity.</p>

<p>Paul saw the Archangel often and in many circumstances, in public
meetings, at the homes of his followers, and at the boys' club which
the priest had organized for the young 'rough diamonds' of his dockland
parish. He saw him also at his church services. These impressed Paul in
a perplexing manner. He noted, at first with some misgiving, the
setting in which they took place, the scant and rather smelly
congregation, so uncomprehending, but so obviously devoted to the
person of the priest; the debased Gothic architecture and strident
coloured windows; the music, so historic, so trite, yet to Paul so
moving, the surpliced urchins of the choir, furtively sucking sweets,
the paraphernalia of the altar, brass and velvet; the muffled noise of
traffic in the great thoroughfare outside; and the occasional
interruptions by some ship's steam-whistle as she nosed her way through
the Thames fog toward China or the Argentine. In the midst of all this
stood the tall, white-robed, fair-haired Archangel, intoning with that
restrained yet kindling voice of his, which to Paul in his more devout
mood made the hackneyed words of the service novel, urgent, significant
with a piercing, blinding lucidity. In his rarer cynical mood, however,
the same performance seemed no more meaningful than the ritual phrases
of a parrot.</p>

<p>The Archangel's influence on Paul was partly physical. The younger
man was attracted by the still athletic figure, the delicate firm lips,
the finely cut aquiline nose. They seemed to him to embody ages of
righteousness. In the priest's manner, too, he found a strong
attraction. It soothed him, like a cool hand on the brow. Yet also it
gripped him and shook him into life. But chiefly Paul was impressed by
the man's sublime confidence, almost arrogance, in his own religious
faith and practice, and by his lively bantering affection for the
straying sheep of his flock. Paul's faith was weak. His love of his
fellow-men was more theoretical than practical. But the Archangel,
seemingly, was a real Christian. He practised what he preached. He
really did love his fellows, not merely as savable souls but as unique
individuals. He really did see something peculiar and beautiful in each
person. He accepted others as he found them, and served them with the
same spontaneity as a man serves his own needs. Through him Paul began
at last to feel a real warmth toward his fellow human animals, and in
doing so he felt exultantly that he was definitely rising to an ampler
and more generous life. Because of this he became extremely ready to
receive the metaphysical implications of the Archangel's religion,
which also had been the religion of his own childhood, seldom seriously
contemplated but always absent-mindedly believed.</p>

<p>Paul fancied that he now saw at last, with almost the intuitive
certainty of elementary mathematics, not only that the governing
principle of the universe was love, but that the actual embodiment of
that love was Jesus. Moreover, under the influence of the Arch-angel,
who had been stimulated by Paul's searching questions to make
statements of doubtful orthodoxy, Paul now affirmed that the universe
was celestial through and through, that all things in it, including
Satan, worked together for the perfect expression of love, the perfect
expression of the nature of Jesus. And the nature of Jesus, Paul
learned not from the Bible but from contemplation of the Archangel. For
the Archangel was very obviously sustained from morning till evening by
a sense of the presence of his divine master. All who came near him
were infected with something of this sense. He radiated a conviction of
the ultimate rightness of all things, and at the same time he fired men
with a zeal for putting the apparently wrong things right. Not that he
was a mere stained-glass saint. Paul was proudly, lovingly conscious of
the Archangel's vivid humanity, even of his little weaknesses, which
served greatly to endear him to his admirers. He had, for instance, a
quaint passion for raisins. After a trying day he would eat them by the
handful, almost defiantly. They seemed to have for him the double
attraction of the grape's sacred and profane significance.</p>

<p>Little by little Paul became an earnest Christian. Deep down in his
breast, rather than in his mind, he argued thus, 'Can such a perfect
being as the Archangel be mistaken about God? He is too wise. Can he be
deceiving me? He is too sincere, too loving. If this man says that God
is Love, it is so.' If ever his doubts returned, he would run to the
Archangel to gain strength to abolish them. Once when this had
happened, and the two were talking in the priest's sitting-room, before
a fire that radiated optimism, while the landlady's cat lay asleep on
the hearth-rug, Paul had what he considered a real religious
experience. The Archangel had been patiently throttling Paul's doubts.
'Hang on to this, Paul,' he said, 'Love alone matters. And whatever is
needed in the world for the existence of love is justified. What kind
of a world is it that we actually find around us? I don't mean your
beloved stars and nebulae and your pettifogging laws of nature. No
doubt they are marvellous, and all part of God's house. But they are
only the floor-boards. I mean the human world. What do you find there?
You find Satan still at large. He always was, and always will be, till
time is finished. And why? Because love that has not got to be for ever
fighting is no more love than the unborn babe is a man. And so, Paul,
we must thank God that, of his great love for us, he made Satan to
torment us.' He paused, then continued: 'That's heresy! You see what
happens if one thinks too much about these old problems. Think of
Christ only. Feel his god-head. Can't you feel his presence in this
room now?'</p>

<p>The Archangel raised his hand and looked at Paul as though listening
to angel choirs. For some moments both remained silent. Gradually it
came to seem to Paul that the room was all alive, all aglow, all
a-murmur with a presence. Was it the presence of this man? Yes, but
surely also it was the presence of Jesus. The room? Nay, the universe.
The whole universe, it seemed, was somehow gathered into that room, and
the whole of it was manifestly infused with the divine love. Everything
was warm and bright, tender and true, or else heroically triumphant
over an Evil that was not merely defeated but somehow shown never to
have been really evil at all. To the adoring Paul it seemed that the
very stars and outer universes came flocking into that little room,
like lambs, to be comforted by this Shepherd, this supreme Archangel
Jesus. They brought with them their little troubles, their sore feet
and their stomachaches, and he, with the magic of his love, cured these
little troubles so miraculously that they never had existed at all,
save as occasions for his love. Paul and the universes nestled together
like little white lambs in the bosom of this Love. Once more it seemed
to him that he had made contact with reality, that he had penetrated
this time surely to the very heart of the universe. The experience was
very wonderful, very strange, yet also mysteriously familiar, with the
familiarity of some forgotten existence, an existence so remote that it
seemed entirely outside time. It seemed to Paul that an immense energy
flooded in upon him. He felt in himself the ancient, the longed-for
strength of faith. At last, after all his barren years, he was tense
with a new vitality, fully charged, ready to spend himself in a new
effulgent life.</p>

<p>The smiling, transfigured Archangel laid a hand on Paul's knee. Paul
said, 'At last I feel Jesus.'</p>

<p>Now while Paul and the Archangel were yielding themselves to this
glamorous experience, there was indeed a presence' with them in the
room, though one of a very different nature from that which these two
Terrestrial animals themselves had conjured in their imaginations. It
was the presence of a man who had seen human species after human
species wrest for itself out of chaos some slight amenity and some
precarious faith, only to collapse into misery, into despair, often
into agony. It was the presence of one who himself looked forward to
the impending extinction of Man; who found in this event, and in all
existence, overmastering beauty indeed, but for the love-sick human
individual no consolation. Strange that it was my presence in Paul's
mind, my coldly scrutinizing presence, that had lent actuality to his
sense of union with the God of Love! The exhortation of the priest had
made him notice in himself an obscure feeling which had already on
earlier occasions fleetingly disturbed him with a sense that in Some
way he was 'possessed'. I now found him peering, as it were, into the
recesses of his being in search of the source of this feeling,
believing that what he would see would be the love-gaze of Jesus. Had
he discovered what it was that actually' possessed' him, had he come,
so to speak, face to face with his Neptunian parasite, his vision would
have been shattered, and no doubt he would have taken me for the Devil.
But I was at pains to elude detection. Mentally I held my breath, as it
were, lest any slight movement of my mind should reveal more of me than
that vague' presence' which he had so fantastically misinterpreted.</p>

<p>It was not easy for me to maintain my immobility, for the spectacle
of Paul's fervour stirred me deeply, both toward pity and toward
laughter. For what was it that was happening to him? Apart from the
complication of my presence', which lent a spurious actuality to his
vision, his experience was an epitome of the religious history of the
First Human Species, a pitiable confusion of factors irrelevant to one
another. In the first place Paul, partly through the wealth of cosmic
imagery with which I had already drenched him, had indeed come face to
face with the majesty of the universe. In the second place he had with
Katherine experienced very vividly the great excellence which is called
love. But the Christian tradition, working on him through his revered
priest, had combined with his own desire so as to persuade him to
attribute love to the pitiless universe itself. This confusion was
caused partly by a trick played upon him by his own remote past. For
the strange familiarity and the delicious consolation and peace which
Paul had savoured in this religious moment were after all but an echo
of his own obscure yearning for the tenderness of the breast and the
elysium of the womb.</p>

<p>Henceforth Paul thought of himself as a soldier of Christ. He
undertook a campaign of asceticism and general discipline. For
instance, he made rules to limit his eating. When he succeeded in
keeping them, the only result was that he rose from every meal with a
wolfish craving, and thoughts of food haunted him throughout the day.
He tried sleeping on his bedroom floor, but always before the night was
over he crept guiltily into bed. His self-discipline was always
half-hearted and ineffective, for he had no real faith in its spiritual
efficacy. He did it, not with the earnestness of the God-hungry soul,
but because earnestly religious persons were supposed to do so, and he
wanted to be one of them.</p>

<p>Paul found great satisfaction in doing odd jobs for the Archangel.
He took up work at the boys' club. Unfortunately he soon found that he
was not much good with boys, having few of the attributes which they
admired. He was useless at boxing and billiards, useless at back-chat.
And he had no authority, for in his heart he was frightened of the
boys. But for the Archangel's sake, and also for self-discipline, he
stuck to the club. Finally he took charge of the canteen. He was
cheated over halfpence, and at the end of the evening he basely made up
the losses out of his own pocket. In intervals of selling coffee and
buns be sat behind the counter reading. But this furtive practice
caused him much heart-searching and when the Archangel was about, he
put his book away and tried to be genial with the boys.</p>

<p>Paul succeeded in persuading himself that nearly all his actions
were expressions of his master-motive, to be a soldier of Christ in the
modern world. But as a matter of fact he had many quite independent
interests. He lived a varied and often hilarious life with the little
band of the Archangel's student admirers. He had also several tentative
amorous passages. He worked industriously and with some success. He
read much contemporary literature and some popular science. But all his
scientific thought he censored rigorously for religion's sake.</p>

<p>Paul's religious fervour expressed itself chiefly not in action but
in writing free verse of a quasi-biblical character. He persuaded
himself that he had an 'urge' to produce verbal formulations of his
spiritual experience, that he was' inspired'. But to his parasite it
was clear that what he produced in this phase was not wrung from him by
the intensity of experience. These poems were but literary exercises,
imitative in technique, and seldom vitalized by any original
imagination. The Archangel applauded these effusions because they were
Correct in sentiment, but he regarded them as merely play, not as a
man's work for God. He could not perceive that though they failed they
meant much to Paul. It is worth while to give one example for the light
which it throws on Paul's mind at this time.</p>

MEN

Behold the sons of men.
who sin.
whose hearts are divine!
In selfishness they heap misery on one another;
yet for love they die.
They are blown about like dead leaves;
yet for love they stand firm.
For bread they trample one another.
yet for a dream they die.
Scatter gold among them, and they are beasts;
show them God, and they are sons of God.

<h3>iii. PAUL FACES THE FACTS</h3>

<p>Without my help it might have taken Paul some years to outgrow his
phase of mental obedience and spiritual confusion. But time was
pressing. I needed him to be well-advanced in his next phase at the
close of his university career, so that he might be prepared to meet
the crisis of 1914 in a significant manner. Therefore, when I had
allowed him some months of play in his little Christian nursery, I
began once more to exercise my influence upon him. I infiltrated him
with images of cosmical majesty and horror, with apprehensions of human
weakness and meanness and agony, with doubts and questions intolerable
to his religion.</p>

<p>During the previous two years Paul had come across a number of
distressing facts about the world, but he had contrived to see them in
the rosy light of his religion. These experiences now, through my
influence, began to haunt him. At all times of the day and night he was
now liable to sinister visual and auditory images, either taken intact
from his own past, or reconstructed in still more repugnant forms. It
was as though hitherto he had been wandering in a luxuriant but
volcanic land in which only now and again he had encountered the
blow-holes and sulphurous jets of nether chaos; but now, it seemed, the
whole terrain was heaving, cracking, belching under his feet. Over his
books in his own comfortable suburban home he would be distressed by
visions of the slum-tenement homes that he had visited when he was
working for an 'after-care' committee. And somehow they seemed more
sordid and overcrowded in imagination than in reality. While he was
walking on the down, he would remember with abnormal distinctiveness a
brawl that he had once witnessed in the East End. Bottles were thrown.
A man's face was cut. A woman was knocked over. Her head came against
the kerbs tone with an audible crack, like the collision of bowls on a
green. While he was reading or eating or walking, and especially while
he was lying in bed and not yet asleep, faces would confront him; faces
which, when he had encountered them in actuality, had seemed but opaque
masks, grey, pinched, flabby, or purplish and bloated, but now in
imagination revealed their underlying personalities to him with
harrowing expressiveness. For I permitted him to see them as they would
have appeared to a Neptunian fresh from the world of the Last Men. He
had once been shown over a lunatic asylum. The faces that now haunted
him were, he recognized, faces of sane men and women, yet they reminded
him distressingly of those imbecile faces. Faces of all kinds they
were, young and old, business men, fashionable women, unshaven
labourers, clerks, young bloods, lawyers; all pushing themselves
forward at him, leering, smirking, whimpering, impressing, imploring,
all so intent, so self-important, so blind. Somehow they reminded him
of cheap ornate lamps, rusty, shop-soiled, and never lit. The queer
phrase 'blind lamps' reiterated itself to him on these occasions.
Another image haunted him in connexion with these faces, and seemed to
him to summarize them all and symbolize the condition of his species.
It was an image which I constructed in his mind in detail and with
verisimilitude, and endowed with a sense of familiarity, though in fact
it was not derived from his past but from his future experience during
the war. He seemed to see, lying in mud, a dead mare, already decaying.
From its hindquarters, which were turned towards him, there projected
the hideously comical face of its unborn foal. The first time he
encountered this apparition Paul was at a political meeting. Before him
on the platform sat a company of politicians, city worthies and their
wives. A cabinet minister was perorating. Suddenly Paul saw the foal,
and in a flash recognized its expression in the speaker, in the ladies
and gentlemen on the platform, in the audience. His gorge rose, he
thought he was going to vomit. Stumbling over his neighbour's feet, he
fled out of the hall. Henceforth he was very prone to see the foal, at
lectures, at dances, in church. Even in the Archangel's smile he
sometimes recognized with horror that foetal grin.</p>

<p>Another type of imagery and of thought I also forced on Paul at this
time. I first impelled him to read works of contemporary literature and
science which were discountenanced by the Archangel. Furtively he began
to return to the interests that had been roused in him before he came
to the university, interests in the intricacy of the physical world, in
the types of living things, in the theory of evolution, in the
astronomical immensities. But whereas formerly these things delighted
him, now they terrified him, even while they fascinated. I took care
that they should haunt him with imagery. He had curious sensations as
of sweeping with increasing speed through space, while the stars
streamed past him like harbour lights. Sometimes it seemed to him that
he was dropping into the tumultuous and incandescent vapours of the
sun. Sometimes he glimpsed spinning worlds, parched and airless,
uninhabited, meaningless.</p>

<p>When Paul had been subjected to this violent influence for some
weeks, he began, like many of his contemporaries, to find a kind of
consolation in the theory of evolution, romantically interpreted. It
made worm and ant and man fellow-workers in a great cause. Exactly what
they were all working for, he did not know; nor could he justify his
strong conviction that, though all had achieved something, man was
doing far more than the others, and might yet do infinitely better.
Those thrusting imbecile faces that haunted him, and were the faces of
his fellow-men and himself, those foal faces, were really not men at
all, not what men should be and might be, any more than the grinning
and putrefying foal was a horse. Gallantly Paul now began to convince
himself that the whole universe was striving toward some supreme
expression of life, though blindly in conflict with itself, torturing
itself. He wrote a poem in which man appeared as 'the germ of the
cosmic egg'. Later he tore it up and wrote another in which the cosmic
egg was said to consist entirely of germs, each of which was trying to
devour the others and include their substance in its own expanding
form. In another he declared that God was' the Soul of the World,
striving to wake'. He put great pains into the making of these verses,
and had a sense of vision and achievement such as he had never known
before. One short poem I quote, as it shows clearly the rebirth of my
influence in him and the quickening of his own imagination.</p>

<pre>
EVANESCENCE

As a cloud changes.
so changes the earth.
Coasts and valley.
and the deep-rooted hills
fade.
They last but for a little while;
as cloud-tresses among the rocks.
they vanish.
And as a smile gleams and fades.
so for a very little while.
Life rejoices the earth.
From the beginning fire.
then frost, endless.
And between, the swift smile, Life.
From the beginning fire.
then frost, endless.
and between.
Mind.
</pre>

<p>Paul ventured to show these poems to the Archangel. The young author
was diffident about them, and did not expect them to be taken very
seriously; but the manner in which the Archangel received them was
something of a shock to him. Gently but also emphatically the priest
told him that he was in danger of serious heresy. God could not be the
soul of the world, since he had created the world and would survive the
world. As for the cosmic egg, still more the evanescence of life in the
universe, Paul ought to realize that such bizarre ideas were dangerous,
since they obscured the central fact of religion, namely the direct and
eternal intercourse between God and man. Surely that amazing fact was
far more interesting than these grotesque fancies. Paul was so upset
that he turned actually dizzy and faint. No wonder, for here was the
being whom he respected above all others and even took to be in some
manner divine, condemning ideas which to Paul himself seemed to have
very far-reaching and very beautiful significance.</p>

<p>This experience was the beginning of a long period of
heart-searching in which Paul became increasingly aware of being torn
in two directions, namely, toward the Archangel and toward something
which he could not yet at all clearly see. He began to oscillate
between two moods. One was a mood of interest in personality and the
personal God whom man had rightly or wrongly conceived in his own
image. The other was a mood of revulsion from man and his God, and of
interest in all that vastness within which man is but a tremulous
candle-flame, very soon to be extinguished. He could not integrate
these moods in one. Yet whichever was the mood of the day, he felt
obscurely but strangely that it was incomplete, that somehow the other
was just as necessary, though at the moment he could not feel it. On
the one hand was the Archangel, and Jesus, and all the humbler beauties
of human persons. On the other was the rippled lake, the stars, the
whole vast intricacy of nature. On the one hand was Love, and on the
other the more mysteriously beautiful thing, Fate. And Life, how did
Life relate itself to this profound dichotomy of the spirit? When he
was in what he called the Archangel mood, he could without difficulty
extend his interest so as to regard the story of evolution as the story
of a great crusade of myriads of spirits freely striving to achieve
some glorious end in praise of God, and sacrificing themselves by the
way in myriads of casualties. When he was in the mood of the stars, he
regarded the same great story as one somewhat intricate system of
wave-trains spreading its innumerable undulations in ever-widening,
ever-fading circles on the surface of existence, presently to vanish.
Strange that, so long as he remained in the mood of the stars, this
thought did not outrage him. He accepted it--not with reluctance, but
with joy.</p>

<p>It was while he was still only beginning to discover the existence
of these two moods in himself that Paul had to decide once and for all
what he would do in the world. The Archangel said, 'If your faith is
secure, prepare to become a priest of the one God. If it is not secure,
find some solid practical work to do in the service of man.' Paul's
faith was not secure. On the other hand, he dreaded the thought of
being caught up in the mills of business or industry. And he did
seriously desire to play some part in the great work of salvation. If
it was not for him to turn men's attention to Jesus, at least he might
turn the attention of the young to the many lovely features of
existence. After much agonized hesitation he finally decided that he
must become a teacher. He therefore persuaded his family to let him
take a diploma, hoping that a thorough preparation would do away with
his proved incompetence with boys. At the outbreak of the European War
he was about to take up his first post, in one of the large suburban
secondary schools of the Metropolis.</p>

<p>For some months Paul was engaged on what seemed to him a life and
death struggle in two entirely different spheres. While he was
desperately trying to acquire the art of teaching, he was at the same
time, and increasingly, concerned with an unprecedented fact in his
world, namely, the European War. Presently this fact gave rise to a new
and bewildering personal problem, namely, the problem of his own
conduct in a war-racked world.</p>

<p>At the school he had set out to inspire his pupils with the love of
'culture'. In fact he took the work very seriously. He spent many hours
in preparation and correction, but was always behindhand, and therefore
in class always uncertain. The boys soon found him out, and took
delight in tripping him. He became more and more insecure. On the side
of discipline also he came to grief, though he had excellent theories
on this subject. Discipline, he argued, should be self-imposed, not
imposed by others. Unfortunately such discipline is the most difficult
to inculcate, especially amongst rebellious young animals who have been
brought up on something different. Paul himself had none of that native
and unconscious authority which alone could have ensured success in
such circumstances. The boys soon found that good sport was to be had
by baiting him. He changed his method, and tried to impose order, but
could achieve no more than a partial suppression of disorder. The more
tyrannous his control, the more gleefully did rebellion raise her hydra
heads. Things came to such a pass that one afternoon when the last
class was over, and the boys had stampeded away along the corridor,
Paul, seated upon his dais, dropped his head forward on his chalk-dusty
hands. I felt tears trickle through his fingers on to the desk. The
syllables of a desperate prayer formed themselves in his throat and on
his lips. 'Oh, God, oh, God,' he cried, 'make me different from what I
am.' It seemed to him that he had reached the very rock-bottom of
despair. For this despair was more acutely conscious, more precisely
formulated than any of his earlier despairs. He was a grown man (so he
imagined), and completely incompetent to deal with life. In adolescence
his dread had been that he himself would miss fulfilment, that he
would' get stuck', stranded, and never explore the promised lands of
life. But now he dreaded far more (so he persuaded himself) that he
would never be able to do anything even of the humblest order 'to the
glory of God '. This was now his master motive, to pull his weight, to
do a man's work, to be able to look his fellows in the eyes and say,
'Of course I am nothing out of the common, but you can see that I am
pulling my weight.' He longed to cut adrift and start all over again at
something else. But at what? Outside his little prison there was
nothing but the war. The boys were already skilfully torturing him
about the war. Then why did he not go? He would make a wretched
soldier, but the Government said that every one was needed. Even if he
merely got himself shot, he would have 'done his bit'. And he would be
quit of all this misery.</p>

<p>For some while he continued to lie with his head in one hand, while
the other crumpled the harsh black folds of his gown. To go and be a
soldier. What did it really mean? Military discipline. Doing stupid
things just because you were told to. Pushing bayonets into straw
dummies, and later into live bellies. Feeling those jagged shell
splinters tear through your own flesh and bones. It was all
inconceivably horrible. But apparently it had to be, since Civilization
was in danger. Then surely he must go. And how good to be out of all
this fiasco of teaching. Anything was better than that. How good to
surrender one's conscience into the keeping of the army. That way
surely lay peace of mind. Like surrendering your conscience to the
Church. Give it to a general to look after. Yes, he must not stand
aside any longer from the great spiritual purification and revival that
the Archangel said was coming out of the war. It had begun already. The
war was helping people to get out of themselves, helping them to see
Jesus. The Archangel said so. Yes, he would enlist. Then there would be
nothing to do but to obey, be courageous, relentless. Then all his
troubles would be escaped. Just set your teeth and be a hero. So easy,
compared with this work that was simply beyond him. He looked at his
watch. Late! And he wanted to get his hair cut before catching the
train home. Hurriedly he began to gather up his books.</p>

<p>Then he paused. Once more he bowed over the desk. Must he really
help in their stupid war, their filthy, mad, backward-looking war, that
was wrecking the civilization it was meant to save. It was like saving
a man from death by an operation that was bound to be fatal. People
said war was better than dishonour. But from the world point of view
war was dishonour. Nothing was so base as war. Better far that the
Germans should overrun Belgium, France, England. But no. The Archangel
said this was all wrong. He said Jesus was definitely on our side. What
was the truth about it all, what was the truth? 'Jesus, Jesus, help me,
if you ever help anyone. Why am I alive? What is it all for? Why is
there this terrible world? Why are we all so horrible?' Jesus did not
answer. Paul lay still, his mind almost blank; then he yawned, raised
his head, and rested his chin on his hand. He had no further thoughts.
He gazed vacantly at the chalk-grains on the desk.</p>

<p>At this point I undertook a serious intervention in Paul's mind. As
he gazed at the minute white points of the chalk, I induced him to
regard them as stars in the Milky Way. I then made him blow upon the
desk. The whole galaxy shifted, spread outwards, streamed down the
sloping board; thousands of stars tumbled into the abyss. Paul watched,
fascinated. Then he shuddered arid covered his face with his hands. I
now flooded his astonished mind with images and ideas. In imagination
he still saw the star-dust streaming, whirling. But I made him seize,
with miraculous vision, one out of all the myriad suns, round which
circled infinitesimal planets. One of these planets his piercing eye
regarded minutely. He watched its surface boiling, seething, settling
into oceans and continents. Then with supernaturally penetrative eyes,
he saw in the tidal waters of the ever-fluctuating, drifting continents
the living Scum, our ancestor. He saw it propagate, spread, assume a
thousand forms, invade the oceans and the lands. He saw forests creep
over the plains; and with his magically piercing vision he detected
among the greenery a sparse dust of beasts. Reptiles clambered, ran,
took wing, or reached up to crunch the tree-tops. In a twinkling they
vanished. Then beneath his eyes a finer and more vital dust, the
mammals, was blown into every land. Now the tempo of his vision slowed,
slowed. Man, super-simian, sprinkled the valleys with his hovels, the
lake-shallows with his huts, the hill-tops with his megaliths. He set
fire to the forests, tilled the plains, built cities, temples, palaces,
Nilotic pyramids, Acropolis. Along thread-like imperial roads the
legionaries percolated, like blood corpuscles. Upon a minute hill,
beside a city wall, a minute crowd existed and vanished. Presently
there was a rash of churches, then little smoke-clouds of wars and
revolutions, then a sudden tissue of steel tracks and murky blotches.
And now to Paul's straining eyes there appeared for an instant a little
crooked line stretching across Europe. On either side of this line
wave-trains drifted, infinitely faint, confused, but unmistakable.
Wave-trains of grey, blue, khaki, were seen to advance upon the line
from East and West, recoiling in feebler undulation athwart their own
advancing successors. They vanished. The tempo of the vision
accelerated. Aeons rushed headlong into pastness. The minute continents
deformed themselves. The little sun shrank, faded to a red spark; and
as it did so the little planet became snowy white, a simple
chalk-grain, which presently was lost in obscurity. The sun-spark was
snuffed out. Paul's gaze seized upon another sun. This also was snuffed
out. One by one, thousand by thousand, all the stars were extinguished,
till the whole galaxy had vanished. There was nothing left but
darkness. It seemed to Paul that the dark flooded into his mind, wave
upon wave. In vain he battled against it. The spirit of night had
triumphed. His mind reeled, sickened, sank into unconsciousness. He lay
still, with open eyes unseeing. But though he was now profoundly
tranced, I, who had worked this change in him, still perceived through
all his sense organs. I felt the slight indigestion that had been
aggravating his despond. I felt the constriction of his collar, which
was rather too small for him. Presently I felt a fly walk across his
eyeball. He took no notice. But I, fearing that his trance might break
too soon, caused his hand to drive away the intruder, and soothe the
irritation. Once more he lay still.</p>

<p>When at length Paul emerged from this swoon, he found himself
recalling with strange distinctness the tarn where long ago he had
first watched the intersecting waves. In imagination he watched them
now, progressing, interlacing, fading, reappearing in varying patterns
on every quarter of the lake. On the actual occasion, they had roused
in him little more than intellectual curiosity; but now they had
acquired such grave significance that every briefest flurry, every
ripple, seemed to imprint its form upon his own being. At first he
resisted, though vainly. But soon the insistent rhythms calmed him to
acquiescence. He let them mould him, re-form him, as they willed; and
in this passivity he found peace. Presently he raised his head, sat up,
looked round at the desks, the maps, the grey fields of the windows,
his chalky hands, the clumsy writing of some' exercises' awaiting
correction. All was as before, yet all was now acceptable, strangely
right, even beautiful. Under his breath he whispered 'God! What a fool
I was not to see it long ago!'</p>

<p>He looked at his watch, gathered up his things, and hurried away. In
his step I felt anew buoyancy, in the stream of his thoughts a new and
bracing freshness. Soon, no doubt, he would return to his former
despair, but the memory of this experience would never wholly desert
him.</p>

<p>At this point I left Paul, and returned to my own world. My first
task was to work up the material which I had gathered from Paul and
others, and to make it known to my colleagues. Next I took that holiday
which was described at the outset of this book. I also participated in
the awakening of the Racial Mind. Then at last I came back to Paul,
rediscovering him, not precisely at the date where I had left him, but
a few days later. The good that I had worked in him seemed already to
have disappeared. I found him, as I have already reported, in an agony
of indecision, tortured by little incidents in the streets of
London.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to tell how Paul finally tackled his war
problem. But for the present we must leave him. My concern with him is
incidental to my main theme. He is but an instrument through which I
chose to observe your world, and through which I choose to exhibit your
world to you. He is also a sample of that world. I have shown the
instrument in some detail, and I have displayed the sample; warning you
that, though peculiarly significant, it is not an average sample. You
have seen that Paul, when he came face to face with the war, was
already at grips with certain problems which are in fact the supreme
problems of your age. Let me close this chapter by enumerating them.
There was the problem of 'the flesh' and 'the spirit', the problem of
human personality and evolving Life, the problem-of the divinity of
love and the austerity of fate. It was with these problems already
troubling consciousness or stirring in regions deeper than
consciousness, that all the more developed members of your species
faced the war.</p>

<p>I now pass on to tell you how your war and your reactions to your
war appear to the Last Men.</p>

<h2>5 ORIGINS OF THE EUROPEAN WAR</h2>

<blockquote>i. THE NEPTUNIAN ATTITUDE TO THE WAR<br>
ii. THE PHILOSOPHICAL LEMURS<br>
iii. PREHISTORIC ORIGINS OF THE WAR<br>
iv. THE HISTORICAL PERIOD</blockquote>

<h3>i. THE NEPTUNIAN ATTITUDE TO THE WAR</h3>

<p>IN your Homeric saga the human conflict is observed and swayed by
invisible but mighty presences. The achievement of each hero is the
issue not simply of his own virtue but of the inspiration and
machination of some favouring divinity. The gods and goddesses take
sides, some with the Greeks, others with the Trojans.</p>

<p>In the war which I am to describe, the European War, the War to End
War, which played so great a part in setting your species toward
decline, every turn of events was noted by invisible presences, but
these unseen observers were neither divine nor partisan. As on the
Trojan plains, so on the plains of Flanders, the hills of Picardy and
Champagne and Argonne, Tyrol's wild heights, the bogs and steppes of
Russia, so equally in Arabia, Mesopotamia and Salonika, on the sea and
in the upper air, in fact, wherever war was present or indirectly felt,
there watched invisible and unsuspected presences. These were not gods
and goddesses mentally inferior to the humanity that had created them,
interested in men only to use them for their own petty though celestial
strife; they were actual human minds. They strove not to give victory
to one side or the other; they were concerned only to record and relish
the ineluctable course of events, and to kindle in such of you as were
open to their influence some glimpse of their own high zest.</p>

<p>When first we examined your war, it was not uncommon for us to
observe in that epoch features which, inexplicable at the time,
suggested that some still future influence of our own must be at work
upon them, influences which we had not yet, from the Neptunian point of
view, been able to exert. Thus to take the most striking example, in
our earliest study we had been perplexed by the fact that the Salonika
episode did not develop on the scale that might have been expected.
Later in Neptunian time, we discovered that we ourselves were
responsible. For it now turned out that certain persons in high
military and naval posts were open to our influence. We accordingly
swayed them toward inertia, and thus deliberately prevented a sequence
of events which would have been far more repugnant to us than those
which actually occurred. But such large-scale influence is very seldom
possible. Moreover we have become extremely chary of indulging in it;
for not infrequently we have come later to regret our meddling.</p>

<p>In our world, as I have said elsewhere, the mature individual has
wholly escaped the snares of private egoism. His will is for the racial
good. But his heart may still be tom asunder in respect of conflicts
between loyalty to the spirit of man and piety toward the actual issue
of fate. Even as individuals, but far more clearly as the race mind, we
pass beyond the human loyalty which is the spring of all our action,
and see in the form of the cosmos a beauty superior to any human
triumph.</p>

<p>Now although we regard events in your epoch with complete detachment
from your many archaic aims, we do feel with you in your racial
struggle to become more fully human. When you fail, or when we fail to
help you, we grieve. When we take action in your world, we are often
tom by doubt as to whether we shall in fact improve or mar the fortune
of the race. But in us pity and doubt are tempered by our intuition
that in the highest view the whole, although severe, is excellent. Even
as individuals, we have this conviction of the superlative beauty of
the cosmos. But in the unique racial experience this insight is far
more developed, and has a very curious and beatific effect upon us as
individuals. For, if our memory is to be trusted, the race mind, when
it looks back on the texture of events accomplished in the past, finds
each one of them to be a needed feature in the cosmical beauty. In that
supreme experience, seemingly, man looks upon the cosmos with a new
discerning vision, and would not have any past event to be other than
in fact it is. Thus it seems that, in so far as we ourselves have
influenced the course of events, our influence has indeed contributed
to the cosmical beauty; yet in so far as we have refrained or failed to
achieve what we planned, that inaction and that failure were also for
the best, were contributory to that supernal excellence which is
clearly seen only by the racial mind.</p>

<p>But do not suppose that, since apparently whatever has occurred is
cosmically right, therefore human endeavour is unnecessary. Only by
means of endeavour can the great theme of the cosmos proceed. But also,
by some influence which is not revealed to us, the issue of all human
endeavour is seemingly controlled so that in its failures no less than
in its triumphs it does in fact contribute to the excellent and perfect
form of the Whole. I say 'seemingly'; for even to us it is not clear
that it must be so; although hitherto, the more we have increased in
spiritual stature, the more often and the more clearly have we
experienced instances of its being in fact so.</p>

<p>Let us now revert to your war. It is perhaps needless to say that,
on those rare occasions when we have influenced the course of events in
your war, we have never been concerned merely to give victory to one
side, or to the other; save when, as has sometimes befallen, an unhappy
observer has become so infected by the terrestrial mentality that he
has lost completely his Neptunian integrity and understanding. Such
disasters are rare. For the most part our observers maintain their
sanity and their detachment perfectly. .</p>

<p>You may be tempted to suppose that the great concentration of our
observers in and around the period of your first world war implies that
we are interested in your war for the same reasons as you yourselves
are normally interested in it. In this you would be mistaken. We do
indeed enter into your feelings in regard to the war. No less fully
than you yourselves have felt them, we feel your agony and despair,
your glory and shame; for we have participated in them directly. But
throughout, we have normally preserved our own detachment. Events which
through your minds we have savoured as world-shattering and
God-condemning we have seen also in their wider relations, and
recognized as but microscopic features in the great whole. And so we
have been able to regard your agony and passion with that blend of
sympathy and irony which, upon a lowlier plane, the adult feels towards
the ardours of children in their games, or the grief of children in
their nursery troubles.</p>

<p>The strategy of your generals, for instance, has for us only the
kind of interest which your own psychologists have found in watching
apes baflled by the simplest problems of intelligence. As chimpanzees,
tantalized by fruit which lies beyond their reach, may achieve or miss
insight into the potentialities of sticks, packing-cases or ropes, so
your commanders painfully achieved, or more often missed, insight into
military potentialities which lay all the while patent to every
Neptunian intelligence. Time after time we saw these gilt-edged
commanders frustrated by problems which even your own brighter minds
might well have surmounted. Again and again we saw thousands of lives
destroyed, and hard-won military gains abandoned, through the
stupidity, or even the mere personal conceit, of some single strategist
or tactician. And though this kind of betrayal was the very stuff that
we had come to study, and normally we could regard it with equanimity,
there have been, for all of us, occasions when such lapses have kindled
a certain amused exasperation, or, if we have been too long subjected
to the terrestrial mentality, even a momentary rage.</p>

<p>Your war-time politicians, perhaps more clearly than your generals,
displayed for us the essential weakness of your kind. We are not
greatly interested in the political aspects of your war, save as
expressions of factors in your nature much deeper than politics. In the
antics of your political leaders, even more clearly than in humbler
lives, we saw the insidious, devastating struggle between private
interest, patriotism, and that newer, more difficult allegiance which
serves before all else the race, or the essential spirit that is man.
In the commonalty, public and private interest stood in less dramatic
and less momentous conflict than in those who framed national and
military policy. It might have been expected that those upon whose acts
great issues hung would hold their self-regarding propensity the more
firmly under control, that the vast public import of their conduct
would induce them constantly to scrutinize their motives with
relentless penetration. But no. Decisions which were ostensibly
concerned only with the national good were determined in fact by envy,
jealousy, or pride. Yet in most cases the agent himself, we discovered,
never doubted his own honesty. Similarly, as you yourselves later came
to recognize, policies which were expressed in the language of
cosmopolitan idealism or of religion, were in fact inspired by nothing
but national aggressiveness or fear, or by some even more disreputable
private motive. This being so, the diplomatic history of your war
period interests us not at all as a record of high policy, but solely
as a tangle of psychological data.</p>

<p>With yourselves, interest in your war is often the mere lust of
horror, the fascination of bloodshed and destruction. To us, your
horrors are unimpressive; for, ranging up and down the aeons of human
history, we have observed many more complete and harrowing
devastations. We have seen races, civilized beyond your dreams,
completely annihilated in swift, or again in long-drawn-out, disaster.
We have seen whole populations writhing and shrieking in physical
agony. Your restricted and aseptic mutual slaughter, almost homely and
kindly in comparison with that which lies a few decades ahead of you,
has therefore no horrific interest for us. It has of course the appeal
of every human tragedy; but neither in magnitude nor in intensity of
suffering is it at all remarkable. Through your minds and your flesh we
do, indeed, experience it as unique, world-shattering and
world-condemning. We savour very thoroughly the agony of despair which
oppressed so many of you in the years of war. Imaginatively we contract
our vision within the limits of your war-bound vision, and enter fully
into your consequent world-disgust. Indeed, having entered there, we
are sometimes shocked that you do not feel more deeply. For even the
most sensitive of you is protected from suffering the full agony
appropriate to your own short-sighted world-disgust by the mere crudity
of his nervous organization, and the consequent obtuseness and
callousness of his mentality.</p>

<p>If it was not horror nor yet political or military interest that
caused us to flock in thousands to observe your war, what was it? Was
it perhaps your acts of individual heroism, your self-transcendence in
devotion to a cause? Or was it your rare impulses of generosity toward
the enemy, your groping efforts to escape the obsession of nationalism,
and to feel the unity of man? We have indeed watched respectfully
whatever in your war was truly heroic, devoted. Even when we have been
forced to smile at the ends upon which that heroism was squandered, we
have recognized that in its degree it was indeed heroism, a virtue
which to beings of your stature is precious and difficult. We have also
recorded faithfully every occasion on which any of you has transcended
nationalism. But we cannot agree with you in regarding your heroism as
the very flower of human achievement, or t your generosity and your
timid cosmopolitanism as sublime triumphs of the spirit. In our world
we are accustomed to a completely relentless self-abnegation in all
situations which demand it. Any failure in this respect we attribute to
insanity. And as for cosmopolitanism, to put the interest of one nation
before that of another seems to any member of any of our thousand
Neptunian nations no less preposterous than for a man to favour his
left eye against his right.</p>

<p>If even your heroism is commonplace to us, seeming no more
remarkable than nursery pluck, what is it that we find in your war to
attract our interest? The answer can be simply stated, but its full
significance needs some further development. We came to see your
species face a situation such as it had never hitherto needed to face.
We came to see it fail to grapple with that situation in any manner
which could have saved it from a fatal spiritual poison, or
auto-intoxication. We knew that this failure was inevitable. We had
watched your nature evolve and your world situation develop. We had
watched these two factors cooperate to produce at a certain date a
violent acceleration of world -change, and subsequently a tangle of
problems with which you could not cope. We had observed a neck-and-neck
race between your developing nature and the developing world, which
your nature itself kept stimulating into constant advance. The world
won. We had seen far back in your history the first stirrings of a new
capacity in you, which, given time, might well have so matured as to
master even the kind of world in which you now find yourselves. But
your 'modern' world came too soon. In the century before the war it
developed with increasing acceleration. You had neither the
intelligence nor the moral integrity to cope with your brave new world.
When at last in 1914 accident posed you with a crucial choice, you
chose wrongly. It was inevitable that you should do so. Being such as
you were, you would most certainly choose as you did. But you have only
yourselves to blame, for your choice was a considered expression of
your own essential nature. The newer kind of behaviour, which alone was
really appropriate to the new world-situation, did indeed make here and
there a tentative appearance, and no doubt in very many persons there
was at least some leaning toward that behaviour; but everywhere a
rigorous suppression, both by governmental authority and by the
primitive disposition within each individual mind, prevented the more
courageous and the only sane behaviour from occurring; save here and
there, spasmodically and ineffectively. And so inevitably you took the
first step toward disaster.</p>

<p>This was the drama which we came to watch, and not your horrors or
your heroics or your strategic prowess or your policies. The actors
were the millions of Europeans and Americans. The dramatic conflict
took place at first within each mind. It then became a struggle between
those many in whom the archaic disposition was victorious, and those
few in whom it was defeated. The immediate upshot of your choice was
war; but in that choice you set in motion a sequence of causes and
effects destined to develop throughout your future. During the war
itself we saw your more percipient minds tortured and warped, not only
by physical pain and fear, but by the growing though unacknowledged
conviction that they had acquiesced in a great and irrevocable treason
against the still-slumbering spirit of man; that through blindness or
cowardice or both, they had betrayed that which was the only hope of
the future. Very often, of course, this betrayal was at the same time
itself an heroic transcendence of mere self-regard for the supposed
good of a nation; but it was none the less betrayal of that half-formed
and nobler nature upon which alone depended man's future well-being.
During the war itself the working of this poison this profound and
almost unrecognized shame, was obscured by the urgency of the military
situation. But after the war it acted with ever-increasing effect. This
effect we have observed in detail, and I shall describe it. When I have
told you of the war itself as it appears to us through your eyes, I
shall tell how, after the war, a subtle paralysis and despair fastened
upon your best minds, and percolated throughout your social organism. I
shall tell how both in theory and in affairs you produced a spate of
symptoms which your psychologists would call 'defence-mechanisms',
designed unwittingly to conceal from yourselves the full realization of
your treason and the clear perception of its effects.</p>

<p>That you may appreciate this drama in all its poignancy, I must
first report briefly our findings in respect of the nature and the past
career of your species, and of the delicate balance of forces which
issued inevitably in this betrayal.</p>

<h3>ii. THE PHILOSOPHICAL LEMURS</h3>

<p>Your historians, when they seek to trace the origin of your war,
refer only to events which took place within the previous century. They
single out such accidents as the murder of an archduke, the ambition of
an emperor, the vendetta of two jealous nations, the thrusting growth
of a new empire and the resistance of an old, the incompatibility of
racial cultures, the debasing effects of materialism, or the inevitable
clash of rival economic systems. Each of these factors was in some
sense a cause of your war; but to assert that any of them or all of
them together constituted the essential cause would be scarcely more
profound than to say that the war was brought about by the movement of
the pen that signed the first mobilization order. The Neptunian
observer, though he duly notes these facts, seeks behind them all for
the more general and more profound cause, by virtue of which these
lesser causes were able to take effect. He looks further even than the
birth of the nations of Europe many centuries before the war. He finds
the explanation of your mutual slaughter by regarding it as a crucial
incident in the long-drawn-out spiritual drama of your species.</p>

<p>Our observers have traced by direct inspection all the stages in the
awakening of man out of his ape-like forerunner. Indeed, as our
technique advances we are able to press back our exploration even along
the generations of man's pre-simian ancestors. Our most brilliant
workers have actually succeeded in entering a few isolated individuals
of a much more remote past, when the mammal had not yet emerged from
the reptile. They have savoured the sluggish and hide-bound mentality
that alone was possible to the cold-blooded forefathers of all men and
beasts. They have also savoured by contrast th new warmth and lambent
flicker of experience which was kindled when the first tentative mammal
began living in a chronic fever. But for the understanding of your war
it is unnecessary to go further into the past than the emergence of the
ape from the pre-simian.</p>

<p>Even at that early age we observe two themes of mental growth which
together constitute the vital motif of the career of the first human
species, and the key to your present plight. These themes are the
increasing awareness of the external world, and the more tardily
increasing insight into the nature of the human spirit itself. The
first theme is one of fluctuating but triumphant progress, since it was
but the mental aspect of the intelligent mastery of physical nature
which brought your species to dominance. The second theme depended on
the application of intelligence to another sphere, namely the inner
world of desires and fears. Unlike apprehension of the external, it had
no survival value, and so its progress was halting. Because this inner
wisdom had long ago been outstripped by the outer knowledge, there came
at last your war and all its consequences.</p>

<p>Our observers have studied minutely all the crucial events of this
age-long drama. Searching even among the dark pre-simian minds, we have
singled out in every generation every individual that has been in
advance of his kind in respect either of outward prowess and
apprehension or of inward self-knowledge. As one may extract any
fragments of iron from a heap of rubbish by passing a magnet over its
surface, so we, with our minds set to a slightly higher degree of
practical intelligence or of self-consciousness than that of the
generation under study, have been able to single out from the mass
those rare individuals whose minds were definitely in advance of their
contemporaries. We find, of course, that of these geniuses some few
have succeeded in handing on their achievement to the future, while
many more have been defeated by adverse circumstance.</p>

<p>Roaming among the pre-simian minds, we discovered one surprising
efflorescence of mentality whose tragic story is significant for the
understanding of your own very different fate. Long before the apes
appeared, there was a little great-eyed lemur, more developed than the
minute tarsier which was ultimately to produce ape and man. Like the
tarsier, it was arboreal, and its behaviour was dominated by its
stereoscopic and analytic vision. Like the tarsier also, it was gifted
with a fund of restless curiosity. But unlike the tarsier, it was prone
to spells of quiescence and introversion. Fortune favoured this race.
As the years passed in tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands it
produced large individuals with much larger brains. It passed rapidly
to the anthropoid level of intelligence, and then beyond. Among this
race there was once born an individual who was a genius of his kind,
remarkable both for practical intelligence and for introspection. When
he reached maturity, he discovered how to use a stick to' beat down
fruit that was beyond his reach. So delighted was he with this
innovation, that often, when he had performed the feat, and his less
intelligent fellows were scrambling for the spoils, he would continue
to wave his stick for very joy of the art. He savoured both the
physical event and his own delight in it. Sometimes he would pinch
himself, to get the sharp contrast between his new joy and a familiar
pain. Then he would fall into a profound and excited meditation, if
such I may call his untheorized tasting of his new mental processes.
One evening, while he was thus absorbed, a tree-cat got him.
Fortunately this early philosopher left descendants; and from them
arose, in due course and by means of a series of happy mutations, a
race of large-brained and non-simian creatures whose scanty remains
your geologists have yet to unearth, and catalogue as an offshoot of
the main line of evolution.</p>

<p>These beings have intrigued our explorers more than anything else in
the whole terrestrial field. Their capacity for self-knowledge and
mutual insight sprang from the vagaries of mutation, and was at first
biologically useless. Yet, merely because in this species it was
genetically linked to the practical intelligence which had such great
survival value, it developed; until at last it justified itself in an
event which from the human point of view seems almost miraculous. At an
early stage the new race threatened to break up into a confusion of
warring tribes, each jealously preserving its own fruit groves and
raiding its neighbours. There was wholesale destruction of fruit.
Starvation and mutual slaughter began to tell upon the nerves of this
highly strung race. Population declined. Then it was that the miracle
occurred. A certain remarkable female, the supreme genius of her race,
organized a truce, and a concourse of all the tribes in the trees
around a forest glade. Here, with the help of confederates and a heap
of fruit, she performed an amazing pantomime, which might be called the
forerunner of all sermons and of all propaganda plays. First, by means
of dance and ululation, she put the spectators into an hypnoidal state
of tense observation. She then evoked in them, by mere gesture and
emotive sounds, a fury of tribal passion. At the moment when the
companies in the tree-tops seemed about to fling themselves upon one
another in battle, she suddenly changed the tone of her pantomime. By
sheer histrionic ability she revealed to her bewildered but
comprehending fellows her own agony of revulsion from hate, her own
heart-searching and self-analysis, her own discovery of profound
cravings which had hitherto been ignored. With no medium but the
language of gesture and tone which she had in part to improvise, she
praised love and beauty, she praised pure cognizance and spiritual
peace. The enthralled spectators followed her every movement with
unconscious mimicry. Each one of them recognized in his own heart that
deeper nature which she was expressing. The result was something like a
revivalist meeting, though shorn of the supernatural. In the midst of
it the exhausted prophetess, overwhelmed by the emotional strain,
succumbed to heart-failure, and thus sealed her gospel with death The
whole incident was miraculous enough, but still more amazing was the
issue. Seemingly at one stride, the race passed to a level of
self-knowledge and mutual loyalty which the first human specie: was to
seek in vain, and which therefore it is not possible for me to describe
to you.</p>

<p>At their height these amiable lemurs attained also a crude material
culture. They had wattle dwellings, set in the forks of trees. They
used rough wooden tools, and earthenware vessels, which hung from the
branches like fruit. They even learned to plant trees so as to extend
their forest. They dried their fruits, and stored them in clay-lined
baskets. But to our observers this practical ability was less
interesting than the precocious inner life with which it was linked.
Nature had favoured these animals by setting them in a great luxuriant
island. Their sole enemies, the great cats, they trapped to extinction.
Unlike their cousins on the mainland, the ancestors of ape and man,
these lemurs were neither over-sexed nor over-aggressive. Consequently
their population remained limited in numbers, and united in sentiment.
They rivalled the ants in sociality; but theirs was an intelligent,
self-conscious sociality; whose basis was not blind gregariousness but
mutual insight. When they had attained a very modest standard of
amenity and a stationary social order, their native genius for
self-knowledge and mutual insight combined with their truly aesthetic
relish of acrobatics and of visual perception to open up a whole world
of refined adventures. They developed song and articulate speech,
arboreal dance, and an abstract art based on wicker-work and clay. The
flowers of personality and personal intercourse bloomed throughout the
race. They began to generalize and speculate, in a naive but promising
manner. By meditation and self-discipline they cultivated mystical
experience. It was with amazement, almost with awe, that our earliest
observers felt the minds of these tailed, soft-furred arboreals grope
toward and even surpass the intuitions of your Socrates and your Jesus.
It might be said that these, who flourished millions of years before
the Christian era, were the only truly Christian race that ever
existed. They were in fact a race of spiritual geniuses, a race which,
if only it could have been preserved against the stresses of a savage
world, might well have attained a far lovelier mentality than was ever
to be attained by the First Men.</p>

<p>This could not be. Nothing but rare good fortune had saved them from
extinction throughout the million years of their career. It was by
practical intelligence alone that they had won their position, not by
self-knowledge, which in the early stages of evolution is indeed rather
a hindrance than a help to the battling species. With security and a
stereotyped social condition, their practical versatility declined.
When at last a submarine upheaval turned their island into a peninsula,
the gentle lemurs met their doom. A swarm of the still half-simian
ancestors of man invaded the little paradise. Far less percipient than
the natives, and less truly intelligent, but larger, more powerful,
quarrelsome, and entirely ruthless, these fanged and hirsute brutes
overpowered the lemurs by numbers and weight of muscle; by cunning
also, for they had a well-established repertoire of foxy tricks. The
lemurs had but one weapon, kindliness; and this in the circumstances
was ineffective. Moreover they were by now emotionally refined into
such fastidiousness that at the sight of blood they fainted. If one of
them was caught and slaughtered by the enemy, his horrified companions
would drop like ripe fruit from the trees and break their necks. Within
a decade the race was extinct.</p>

<p>With the defeat of the lemurs at the hands of a hardier and a more
extravert species, it was written in the book of fate that, sooner or
later, a world-situation such as your own must occur, and give rise to
an epoch of world wars such as you are now to suffer. Between the
downfall of the lemurs and your own age there has been a slow, but in
the long run triumphant, advance of practical intelligence. That other
application of intelligence, namely to the inner life, has developed
but spasmodically, as an accidental consequence of the growth of
intelligence in action. And so it has happened that man's motives have
remained throughout the career of your species almost invariably
primitive. Even in your own day, when primitive impulses are
intellectually seen to be inadequate, and you struggle pathetically
toward loftier desires, your hearts remain the hearts of apes, and your
struggle is vain. From the point of view of cosmical perfection, of
course, your struggle is not vain at all. By your gallant effort and by
your fated downfall also, you fulfil your part well and truly within
the drama of existence. But from the point of view of the advancement
of the race your struggle is indeed vain, doomed to failure. The
profound reorganization of the human will, which you now see to be
necessary, cannot be achieved in time to avert disaster. While the
world remained primitive, and man's power over physical nature feeble,
this paucity of the inner life, though in itself deplorable, did not
imperil the survival of the race. But in your day man has gained
considerable power. Not only has he made his world so complex and so
explosive that it threatens to break from the control of his practical
intelligence but further, and more serious, it is now such that the
operation of the old blind motives may destroy it. Nothing could save
you but a far more radical exercise of those capacities of
self-knowledge which in your species have flowered only in rare
circumstances, and in your own feverish epoch are more and more crushed
out by the routine of industrial society.</p>

<h3>iii. PREHISTORIC ORIGINS OF THE WAR</h3>

<p>In its earliest phase, then, and throughout its career, your species
triumphed by means of pertinacity, quarrelsomeness and practical
versatility. Little by little, success has strengthened these
qualities. In the early conflict of many intelligent half-simian
species, one conquered, the most cunning and courageous of all. The
rest vanished. By wit and constancy of purpose the one creature made
himself at last the veritable king of beasts, attacking even the great
flesh-eating cats, till his very smell became dreadful to them. Thus by
extravert intelligence did your ancestors come into their kingdom. For
savouring their own experience they had neither need nor inclination.
They gulped it down, and then sought more. For probing their own hearts
they had no capacity. They could never become clearly aware of
themselves. Since then, the aptitude for self-knowledge, which in your
stock was never great, has not been fostered, save here and there and
in a few periods of your history. There came of course a stage when the
mere growth of intelligence made man realize that his heart was an
unexplored jungle, and forced him to attack it. But this stage came
late, too late: The jungle was by then too dense, too
well-established.</p>

<p>Our observers have inspected everyone of those great strokes of
genius by which man came into his power. We have tasted the surprise
and glee of him who first smashed his enemy's face with a stone, the
triumph of him who first shaped a flint-edge to his liking, of him who
secured fire and used it, of him who improved the floating log into a
boat with paddles, and the rolling log into a wheel, of him who wrought
the first metal tools, of him who made a sail, and so on. We have seen
these inventions attained, forgotten sometimes even by the individual
discoverers, re-invented, again, and again lost and rediscovered, until
at last they became the permanent property of the race. In each case we
have entered the mind of the innovator, and felt his sudden ecstasy of
achievement, his leap into keener being, like the fanned spark's leap
into flame. We have watched him subsequently sink back into the old
dream-like routine mentality, forgetful of past insight. Again and
again, when a primitive man has stared uncomprehendingly at the very
stone with which yesterday he triumphantly cracked the marrow-bones,
our observer, being himself but human, has longed to remind the poor
fool of his past prowess. As the ages advanced, this intelligence, this
power of insight into the potentialities of external objects, evolved
from a rare flicker to a constant flame, an established habit of mind.
It was formerly intermittent, unreliable. It was like the earliest
tools, which were but natural clumsy stones, picked up and used
occasionally, and then forgotten. In time it became like the wrought
and tempered knife, which is kept ever about the person, used at every
turn, used often for mere love of using it, toyed with and applied to
all manner of objects which seem at first without any practical
significance whatever. Sometimes, indeed, as the ages pass, this keen
knife of the mind is even applied to the mind itself. The inventor
notices his own inventive activity, and tries to dissect it. The hungry
man observes his own hunger, the amorous man his own lust. But the
process turns out to be rather bewildering, even painful. Also it
distracts one from the actual business of living. In the early stages
it is therefore shunned.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as the epochs unfold, the mind of man becomes more
capacious, more unified, more active. It is no longer an ephemeral
perception, forgetful of the past, or troubled now and then by a mere
gleam of memory. Increasingly it carries the past forward with it, and
refers to this stored past for light upon the present and the future.
Increasingly every moment of its experience becomes interfused by all
the rest of its experience. Today gains meaning from yesterday. Nothing
can happen to the mind that does not reverberate, faintly or violently,
through its whole nature. Every event is interpreted and valued in
relation to other events. The man's mind becomes increasingly one mind,
not a host of disconnected stupid little minds, awakening one after the
other in response to special stimuli. Or so it tends to become. But in
fact, it remains, in spite of all advances, very far from unified.</p>

<p>Along with this growing art of comprehending things together and
taking more and more into account, comes an increasing discrimination
of the actual differences in the world. Eyes distinguish new delicacies
of shape, new shades of colour, ears detect new modulations of sound,
fingers touch with increasing percipience, manipulate with increasing
skill. Thus, age by age, man's experience of his world becomes richer,
more coherent. Beasts, trees, one's fellows, become ever more
characteristic, recognizable, reckonable. Space enlarges itself, is
measured out in paces, leagues, marches; and time in days, months,
seasons, years, generations. There looms a past before the clan was
founded, a future for grandchildren's grandchildren. Meanwhile things
that were formerly mere' brute facts', shallow, opaque, barren of
significance beyond themselves, reveal unexpected depths of meaning,
become luminous, pregnant, charged with mysterious power. The sun and
moon, darkness, the storm, the seasons, beasts of the chase and hostile
beasts, all gather to themselves out of the past a strange, obscure,
potent significance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile also another, very different, class of objects is at
length gaining precision and significance. The roving curiosity looks
sometimes inward. Intelligence is turned more resolutely than of old
upon the anatomy of the mind itself. The hunter, in ambush for his
prey, is suddenly confronted with his own being. He beholds that
strange thing' himself', with the surprise and awe which he felt when
he encountered for the first time some unfamiliar beast of the forest.
But this time he has no clear apprehension of the mysterious quarry,
only a most tantalizing glimpse, as of a dark form lurking behind the
brushwood. He falls into abstraction. He ruminates his own being. 'I
-am waiting for the stag. I want to kill the stag.' The strain of
stalking himself gives him a kind of vertigo. It even frightens him.
Suddenly he wakes from his novel experience, to find that the physical
quarry that he proposed to ambush has appeared and escaped. He has
missed his dinner. He vows he will never again be bemused in this way.
But on another occasion something similar happens. He is courting his
young love, with the great brown eyes and gentle voice. She is ready to
be taken. But suddenly two strange things loom into his inner vision,
himself and herself, very near to one another, very closely entwined
into one another's minds, yet strange to one another, infinitely
remote. Once more he falls into abstraction, fascinated, perplexed.
'I--she. I--she'. As he sinks into this meditation, she sees his face
change and fade. She seeks to rouse him by winsome tricks, but he
remains for a while abstracted. In sudden fear and resentment she
breaks from him and flies.</p>

<p>Thus, little by little, men and women grope toward a certain
tentative superficial self-knowledge, and knowledge of one another.
And, as they proceed, these strange objects, selves, become charged
with ever-greater significance. Individuals come to prize themselves as
no less gifted creature could ever do. They are proving that they are
mighty selves. And, prizing themselves, they learn at the same time to
prize other selves. Woman, whom man once saw merely as a thing to covet
and embrace and then to ignore, or at most as a vague' other',
agreeable or irksome, now gathers to herself the significance of all
past intercourse, all subtle passages of lust and love and hate, and
reveals herself at last as a spirit, mysterious, potent, tender,
ruthless. So also the man to the woman. Children, once mere objects to
tend, defend, fondle, or, as the mood changed, to spurn, now become
beings in their own right, rightly demanding service, even to the
death. The group, once a vague swarm of fluctuating, discontinuous
phantoms, companionable, quarrelsome, tyrannous, crystallizes at length
into a system of persons. Close around oneself there is discovered a
nucleus of well-tried friends and enemies, each one unique,
incomparable. Over the heads of all, remote, mysterious, the old man of
the tribe, or the tribal mother, or later the king of the whole land,
embodies in his own person the ancient impersonal presence of the
group, and later ascends heavenward as the tribal god, finally to
become the one God of all tribes and all existence.</p>

<p>But long before this apotheosis there begin to appear here and there
among the tribes beings of an intenser self-consciousness and a more
insistent egoism, heroes, violent men for whom nothing is
respect-worthy but their own exultant spirits. The word 'I' is ever on
their lips and in their deeds. Each one of them is poignantly aware of
himself as pitted against a huge, base, reptilian universe; and is
confident that he will master it. Each lives for the mere zest of
mastery. In his triumphant course each is accompanied by a swarm of
jackal followers, not of his own kind, but striving to be of his kind.
With them he smites the established powers, changing man's life for
good or bad, making his mark upon the world, for very lust of
scribbling. At the close of it all he confidently expects translation
into some Valhalla. Often as not, all trace of him vanishes in a
generation, save his name and legend on the lips of bards. If in any
other manner his work lasts, it is more or less an accident. For,
though aware of the superficies of his individuality in a manner
impossible to his fellows, the hero has neither inclination nor time
nor courage to penetrate within it and explore it. He accepts the
bright superficies of himself at its face-value, and cares nothing for
its deeper potentiality. In this respect he is typical of your
kind.</p>

<p>Not only so, but the glamour of the hero has helped to make you what
you now are. The ideal of personal prowess, which he set, though at
first helpful to man's sluggish spirit, became later the curse of your
species. With its facile glory it inveigled your forefathers into
accepting outworn values, puerile aims. Throughout the whole career of
your species the ideal of heroism has dominated you, for good and bad.
In the earliest of all human phases, the almost simian mind of man
could not yet conceive any ideal whatever, but the hero ideal was none
the less already implicit in his behaviour, though unconscious. The
best from which man sprang was already self-regarding, quarrelsome,
resolute; and his hands were skilled for battle. Since then, epoch by
epoch, the glory of innumerable heroes, the spell of innumerable heroic
myths have ground the ideal of heroism into men's hearts so deeply that
it has become impossible for you 'modern' men, in spite of your growing
perception that heroism by itself is futile, to elicit from your hearts
any larger ideal. You pay lip-service to other ideals, to love, and
social loyalty, and religious possession; but you cannot feel them
reverberate in your hearts, as does the ideal of the splendid
all-conquering individual. To this ideal alone your hearts have "been
tuned by age-long hero-worship. No doubt, throughout your career
loyalty has played a part. Y our triumph, such as it is, rests upon the
work of brilliant individuals cooperating in the group's service. But
you have never taken the group to your hearts as you have taken the
hero. You cannot. Your hearts are strung for the simpler music. They
are but one-stringed instruments, incapable of symphonic harmony. Even
your groups, even your modern nations," you must needs personify as
heroic individuals, vying with one, another, brandishing weapons,
trumpeting their glory.</p>

<p>Our observers, wandering through the ages which you call
prehistoric, have watched your kind spread in successive waves into
every habitable corner of your planet, multiplying itself in a thousand
diversities of race, diversities of bodily form, or temperament, of
tradition, of culture. We have seen these waves, as they spread over
the plains and along the coasts and up the valleys, every now and again
crash into one another, obliterate one another, augment one another,
traverse one another. We have seen the generations succeed one another
as the leaves of an evergreen tree. As the leaves of a young tree
differ from the leaves of an old tree, the early generations differ
from the later in bodily and mental configuration. Yet they remain
within the limits of their specific type. And so, inevitably, do you,
spiked leaves of the holly.</p>

<p>We have watched all the stages, gradual or sudden, by which the
common ancestor, crouched, hairy, and pot-bellied, has given place to
the more erect Pithecanthropus, to the still almost simian
Neanderthalian, and at last to the taller and more human progenitor, of
all your races. We have seen the first bare rippled backs, and the
first broad upright brows. We have seen woman's breasts form themselves
out of the old simian dugs. We have watched the gradual crystallization
of your four great racial beauties, white, yellow, brown and black. We
have followed in detail many a minor strand of bodily character, and
the many facial types within each race, which blend and part and blend
again, generation by generation Similarly we have traced, generation by
generation, the infinitely diverse exfoliation of the simian mind into
your four great racial temperaments, and all the subtleties of
disposition inborn in the many stocks within each race.</p>

<p>There came at length a stage in the career of your species when
through the operation of intelligence, men began vaguely to feel that
there was something wrong with their own nature. They had already, here
and there, acquired a superficial self-knowledge and mutual insight.
They had begun to distinguish, though haltingly the lesser and the
somewhat greater goods of the spirit. From mere sex, mere parenthood,
mere gregariousness, they had passed here and there to a kind of love
and a kind of loyalty; but they could not maintain any sure footing on
this higher plane. They were for ever slipping into the old bad ways.
Increasingly they surmised that the purely animal way of life, even
when glorified into heroism, was not the best that men and women could
attain. Yet when they anxiously peered into their chaotic hearts to
discover what was better, they could see nothing clearly, could find no
constant illumination. Our observers, studying your early races, report
that for each race there came a phase, early or late, poignant or
obscure in which there spread a vague but profound restlessness, a
sense of potentialities not exercised, a sense of an insecure new
nature struggling to shape itself, but in the main failing to do more
than confuse the old brute nature. It is of this phase of your career
that I must now speak.</p>

<h3>iv. THE HISTORICAL PERIOD</h3>

<p>The action of the drama accelerates. With ever-increasing speed the
human intelligence masters its world, brings natural forces more and
more under control of the still primitive will, and unwittingly
prepares a new world, a man-made world, which is destined to become in
your day too intricate for the still unfinished intelligence to master,
too precariously balanced to withstand the irresponsible vagaries of a
will that is still in essence simian, though equipped with dangerous
powers. The ape has awakened into a subtler and more potent cunning. He
has attained even a vague perception of what it would be like to be
truly human in mind and heart. Ineffectually, intermittently, he
strives to behave as a true man would behave; and in rare moments he
actually achieves thoughts and actions not unworthy of a man. But for
the most part he remains throughout the history of your species, and in
your own moment of that history, at heart a monkey, though clothed,
housed and armed.</p>

<p>Before we look more closely at your 'modern' world, let us glance at
the hundred centuries preceding it. At the outset we see tribes of
hunters settling down to till the valleys, especially the valleys of
the Nile, the Euphrates, the Indus, the Ganges, the Yangtze. Millennia
pass. Mud huts proliferate along the river-banks, condense into cities,
are overhung by megalithic tombs, temples, palaces. The tribes coalesce
into kingdoms and empires, and produce the first phases of
civilization. Traders score the t continents with their tracks. Little
ships creep around the coasts, and sometimes venture beyond sight of
land. Heroes gather armies and perform mighty evanescent conquests.
Hardy barbarians invade the plains, dominate the empires, and are
absorbed by the conquered. Daily life becomes steadily more secure,
amenable, regular, complex. Triumphantly the intelligent beast finds
new ways to gratify its ancient cravings for food, shelter, safety,
adventure, for self-display, amorousness, and herd-activity. Yet at
heart it remains a beast, disturbed but seldom by an obscure discontent
with its own nature and with the world that it has fashioned around
it.</p>

<p>With the increase of security a few exceptional minds begin to
explore their environment intellectually, and even to probe their own
nature. Increasingly the more awakened individuals become aware of
their own inner chaos, both of understanding and of will. Here and
there, where circumstance is peculiarly favourable to the life of the
spirit, men are almost persistent in their self-searching. In India,
where the physical cravings are insurgent and irresistible as the
jungle, they strive through asceticism to establish the spirit over the
flesh. In Greece they seek harmonious fulfilment of body and mind. For
the sake of this fulfilment they seek the truth. They pass beyond the
rule-of-thumb devices of medicine men, astrologers, builders,
navigators, to make guesses about the inner nature of things, about the
stars, the shape of the earth, the human body and soul, about number,
space, time, and the nature of thinking. Meanwhile in Palestine others
conceive a divine law; and in obeying it they expect a heaven of
eternal bliss.</p>

<p>Then at length appear, here and there along the centuries, here and
there among the peoples, a few supremely penetrating minds. Mostly
their careers are cut short by indifferent fate, or by the vindictive
herd. But three triumph, Gautama, Socrates, Jesus. Seeing with the
mind's eye and feeling with the heart more vividly and more precisely
than their fellows, they look round them at the world, and within them
at their own nature, as none had done before them. It is a strange
world that confronts them, a world of beings superficially like
themselves, yet different. So uncomprehending are their fellows, so
insensitive, so pitifully weak. In rigorous and ceaseless meditation
the three great ones strive to formulate their teeming intuitions in a
few great principles, a few great precepts. They live out their
precepts in their own lives relentlessly. Gautama said: By self-denial,
self-oblivion, seek that annihilation of particular being which is the
way to universal being. Socrates said: Let us fulfil ourselves to the
uttermost by embodying in ourselves, and in the world that is our city,
the true and the good. Jesus said: Love one another; love God; God is
love.</p>

<p>From these three greatest of your kind, these three vital germs
issue three vast ramifications of spiritual influence, three widespread
endemic infections of the minds of men, passing from generation to
generation. The tragedy of your species may be said, to lie in its
complete failure to embody, rather than merely to mimic, the spirit of
these three men. Our observers, as I have already said, have never been
able to establish themselves in any of these three. As the single
racial mind of the Last Men we do indeed, if the obscure recollection
of that experience is to be trusted, savour and even influence them.
But to each individual observer they remain impenetrable. We can,
however, study them through their contemporaries, and have done so,
very minutely. We have seen those great ones face to face, listened to
every word that they have spoken, watched every act they have performed
in the presence of any spectator. Through dying eyes we have observed
Gautama contemplating death. In the mind of the young Plato we have
attended to the quiet ironical voice of Socrates and been confronted by
his disturbing gaze. We have heard Jesus preaching on the mount, with
dark face kindled. We have stood around the cross and heard him cry out
on the God whom he had misconceived.</p>

<p>In such experiences three facts invariably impress us, and fill us
with a sense of the pathos of your kind. We are amazed both at the
unique genius of these men and at the world-imposed limitation of their
genius. We are pressed also by the inability of their fellow-men to
grasp even that part of their vision which found expression. For
neither their immediate fellows nor you, with all your complacent
historical knowledge, can ever understand them. How should you? They
themselves strove in vain to comprehend their own profound, unique,
intuitions, within terms of their world's naive beliefs. But though the
flame burned brightly in their hearts, they could neither understand it
not express it. For neither their conception nor their language was
adequate to such a task.</p>

<p>But even if they could have expressed their vision, they would have
been misunderstood. For each of these three, though sorely cramped and
bewildered by his archaic world, was a veritable man; while his
fellows, like the rest of you, were but half-human apes. And so,
inevitably, these great ones are misinterpreted even by their own
chosen followers. Socrates, who is so much more fortunate in Plato than
Jesus in his disciples and Gautama in his interpreters, is seen by us,
not only to be more profound in intellect than the great Plato, but to
have also a vision, an illumination, perplexing to himself and utterly
incommunicable to any of his associates. The lemurs might have
understood him. The lemurs might have understood Jesus, and Gautama
also. But they, too innocent, could not maintain themselves against the
muscle and cunning of man's progenitors.</p>

<p>It is clear to our observers that in your three great minds there
occurred an identical insight into the nature of man and of the world.
But each interpreted his vision differently, and expressed it
differently in action. And from each a very different influence was
selected by his followers.</p>

<p>We have traced that influence, that spreading ferment in men's
minds. The three proliferations are very diverse. But in the early
stages of each, during the first and even the second generation, there
occurs a new intensity of experience, an increased though still
confused self-knowledge, mutual insight and apprehension of the world.
There is also a gloriously increased pertinacity of the will to be man
rather than ape. Tidal waves of a new enthusiasm now begin to surge
across the peoples, lifting up men's hearts, spreading over the
continents. And, spreading, they fade. They multiply into a thousand
meandering variations. They are deflected hither and thither,
traversing one another again and again.. They confuse, annihilate or
augment one another. In your day there is not a mind anywhere on your
planet which does not pulse, however faintly, to the endlessly
wandering reverberations of your three true men.</p>

<p>But long before your day the character of the influence is changed.
At first it stormfully resounds in the secret places of men's hearts,
and even wrenches their poor ape-hearts into something of the human
form. But in the end the simian nature triumphs. Those crude
instruments, forced for a while to reverberate in response to a music
too subtle and too vast for them, presently relapse into the archaic
mode.</p>

<p>The ape nature corrupts the new, precarious, divinely human will,
turning it into a lofty egoism, a new heroism.</p>

<p>Here, there is heroism of the intellect, loyal only to the
truth-seeking self; there, heroism of the heart, determined to embrace
all men in indiscriminate brotherliness, through mere loyalty to the
love-proud self; there, heroism of the spirit, domineering over the
flesh, proclaiming as the supreme affirmation mere negation.</p>

<p>But there remains a memory, a tradition, a legend, an obscure
yearning in the hearts of men for a way of life that is too difficult
for them. And so there are formed various mighty associations, whose
office is to preserve one aspect or another of the fading illumination.
The Christian and the Buddhist churches spread far and wide their
hierarchies and their monastic orders. Institutions of learning,
schools and universities, are precipitated around the Mediterranean
coasts and over the European lands. Indians, Chinese, Arabs, Latins,
Franks, thus preserve amongst themselves Some smouldering embers. But
the flame is vanished.</p>

<p>Yet now and again, once in a few generations, now in this land, now
in that, the coals break once more into conflagration. There is a
spreading revival of the original ecstasy. Once more, but not for long,
the ape-hearts resound obscurely with counterfeit echoes of an
experience whose true form they cannot support. Once more it seems to
them that they are merged in one another and gathered into God in a
mystic communion, that they have pierced behind appearances to the
eternal truth, that by self-annihilation they have escaped the
limitation of the flesh and individual consciousness, to be gathered
into the absolute being. But once more, though the few attain some
genuine illumination, the many misunderstand, ignore what is essential
and mimic what is accidental; or in frank hostility persecute. Once
more, as the insight fades, the institution flourishes, and takes up
its place in the established order. Once more the ape triumphs over the
man.</p>

<p>Our observers have savoured the minds of the First Men in all these
wave-crests of the spirit, these religious revivals, protestations,
counter-reformations, these fervours of heart-searching, stampedes of
soul-saving, these martyrdoms for an inner light so precious and so
misperceived. Everywhere we detect an identical fact. Vaguely aware of
his own blindness and incoherence, man yearns toward vision and toward
harmony; but he yearns in vain. Vision, indeed, he does now and again
achieve, fleetingly, misleadingly; but harmony never. Here and there
men see obscurely what they should be doing with themselves, but always
their conduct, and their vision also, is distorted by preconceptions
and predilections forced upon them by their ape nature. They are
confused by phantom lures of immortality, of celestial bliss, of
abstract righteousness, of divine love.</p>

<p>Nevertheless men do begin, here and there, to feel stirring within
them, striving for expression, some strange new life of the spirit. Did
they but know, they are in travail for a twin birth. They are troubled
with the first movements of a new piety toward fate and a new loyalty
toward man. Of the first they know as yet almost nothing, for whenever
they experience it, they confuse it with the old complacent love of a
loving God. Of the second, they guess only that they must make the best
of man, must seek to know ever more truly both the world and the self,
must seek to feel ever more delicately, and to will ever more
harmoniously. Obscurely they begin to surmise that the whole active
duty of men is to live for men; and that man must be made one, a spirit
winged perhaps for enterprise unimaginable in their day. But these two
conflicting spirits of cosmical piety and human loyalty remain still
deeply hidden in their hearts; and men can neither see into their
hearts nor bring forth in action what still is hidden. They cannot
obey, they cannot even understand, these two seemingly incompatible
divine commandments of the future. Blindly they seek vision; but the
knowledge that they would have is for power, not piety. And so they are
tricked at every turn by their own cravings. Harmony they seek; but
neither within the individual nor in the race of individuals can they
attain it. Nor can they find harmony with the universe. In each heart
there rages the old conflict between the man and the monkey, and also
the obscure new conflict between cosmical piety and human loyalty. In
the external world, the quarrelsome apes that fought of old for prey,
for mates, for kingship, for hunting-grounds, war now for cornlands,
mines, trade, for national glory or security, for fantasies of
religion. Armies surge hither and thither. Fields and cities are laid
waste; and always in a good cause, whether for some royal master, or
some burgher caste, or some nation, or for the glory of God.</p>

<p>While all this is afoot, something else which is new is beginning to
happen to mankind. The still unrecognized piety toward fate and fact,
and toward the actual course of the world, stirs men to observe the
daily features of the world with new interest. At the same time loyalty
toward man fires them to master the physical world for man's use, and
therefore to understand its working. Some few individuals here and
there, fretted by a recrudescence of that curiosity by which the ape
had triumphed, begin to pry into the behaviour of physical things. They
drop weights from towers, seek new descriptions of planetary motions,
peer at the heavens through lenses, observe the workings of flesh and
blood, put one stuff with another stuff and watch the issue, brood upon
the falling apple, and on the jumping lid of a kettle, devise pistons,
cog-wheels, gears, wheels within wheels. Suddenly man puts together a
mesh of dangerous little fragments of knowledge, and comes into
possession of little dangerous powers. Victoriously, the human ape
assimilates the teeming influx of new facts. Decade by decade he
discovers new features of the intricacy and majesty of the physical
universe. Imagination strains to cope with the very great, the very
little, the very complex, the very swift, the very long-enduring.
Little by little, the familiar universe crumbles away, and a new
stupendous universe forces itself on man's reluctant fascinated
gaze.</p>

<p>Within this new pattern of things man sees himself as among the very
little, the very brief, the very impotent, the wholly mechanical. This
discovery, which fills him with indignation and despair, should have
been a step in his salvation. It should have taught him to value
himself no longer as the immortal, precious, unique child of a God whom
his own mind had created, but henceforth as a thread in the fair web of
the universe, a theme in the great music, and also as one brief
sentient focus of cosmical aspects. But, wholly ignorant of his own
interior being, he still cherishes the belief that he is something
peculiar, distinct from the physical, something uniquely free, vital,
spiritual. And so, when he is forced to regard himself as all of a
piece with his world, he feels himself degraded. All that he knows of
the physical world is shape, movement, resistance, mechanical sequence
of changes. These he takes to be no mere superficies, but the very
essence of the physical. And these abstractions he now applies to
himself, condemning himself as mere 'matter'. If he knew himself as
well as he now begins to know his world, the science of the physical
would not dismay him about his own nature, nor remain itself a science
of mere appearances. But through inveterate self-blindness the First
Men are doomed to misconceive themselves in the light of a physical
nature, which, also through self-blindness, they must misconceive.
Ignorant of their own interior being, they remain ignorant of the
interior being of the world whose gorgeous superficies is now stage by
stage terrifyingly revealed.</p>

<p>When the First Men have already firmly grounded their science of the
physical world, they begin to direct the same objective study upon
their own behaviour. Thus they will acquire in due season a vision of
themselves even more devastating, because more precise. They will see
themselves at last unambiguously as greedy, self-absorbed, vindictive,
timorous apes, cunning and powerful up to a point, yet also incredibly
weak and stupid. This knowledge, could they but pursue it relentlessly
and to the bitter end, should lead them at last up to the locked door
behind which is true self-knowledge. Once there, they should be able by
biological control to produce a generation capable of penetrating that
interior stronghold. Thus should the First Men arrive at last where the
lemurs started, and should proceed to surpass those wise innocents in
every activity of the spirit. But in the book of fate it is written
that this shall not happen. While men are taking the first few halting
steps in the new venture, while they are still debating the course, the
storm breaks upon them. A world situation arises which demands for its
control more intelligence and far more integrity of will than their
half-formed nature can achieve.</p>

<p>While man is becoming less and less confident of his own spiritual
dignity, he acquires more and more power over his physical world, and
sinks further and further into obsession with the material. Steam
drives ships across the oceans without care for winds, drives trains
across the lands, carrying great loads at incredible speeds. Later
comes electricity, and with it the flashing of messages around the
planet on wires or on the ether. The age-old dream of flying is at last
realized by aeroplane and airship. Meanwhile by machinery and chemical
synthesis innumerable materials and utensils are manufactured for
comfort, luxury or power.</p>

<p>What is the upshot? From its germ in Europe a new world spreads,
devouring the old world. Formerly events happening in one region had
seldom any appreciable effect elsewhere. But now, increasingly, each
event in every Part of the world reverberates within all other events.
By means of steam and electricity the human world is becoming one
system. Its regions become interdependent economically, even in a
manner culturally; but not politically, and not socially. The hearts of
men are massed against one another in jealous and mistrustful nations.
And across this, cleavage runs another, the division in all lands
between masters and servants, the economically free and the
economically enslaved. The new world should have been a happy and
glorious world. But it is not. The new powers should have been
organized in service of the human spirit, the one right object of
loyalty. But they are not. The First Men can do almost nothing, with
their powers, but serve the old ape-cravings for private comfort,
safety, self-display and tribal glory.</p>

<p>At the moment of the outbreak of the European War the great majority
of mankind are extremely ignorant not only of their own essential
nature but of the world. They feel no need that man should be made one,
and that all men should cooperate in the supreme racial enterprise.
They take the nations to be the true objects of loyalty, and the social
classes to be natural elements of the nation. But a minority, mostly in
the Western lands, have blindly felt this need of human unity. Their
leaders have formulated it obscurely in one manner or another, often
discrepantly. But few can take it at all seriously, very few can live
for it passionately. In most cases, however bravely they can talk about
it, they cannot act for it. If ever they are put to the test, they shy
away, affirming that nationalism is 'practical', cosmopolitanism but a
remote ideal. Though they see it intellectually, their hearts are not
capable of responding to it. If ever the nation is in danger, their
cosmopolitanism evaporates, and they stand for the nation in the good
old style. Yet intellectually they know that in their modern world this
way leads to disaster.</p>

<p>The story of your species is indeed a tragic story, for it closes
with desolation. Your Part in that story is both to strive and to fail
in a unique opportunity, and so to set the current of history toward
disaster. But think not therefore that your species has occurred in
vain, or that your own individual lives are futile. Whatever any of you
has achieved of good is an excellence in itself and a bright thread
woven into the texture of the cosmos. In spite of your failure it shall
be said of you, had they not striven as they did, the Whole would have
been less fair. And yet also it shall be said, even had they triumphed
and not suffered their disaster, the Whole would have been less
fair.</p>

<h2>6 THE WAR</h2>

iii. EUROPE AT WAR<br>
iv. PAUL IN THE WAR</blockquote>

<h3>i. EUROPE BEFORE THE WAR</h3>

<p>I MUST now describe from the Neptunian point of view that moment in
the career of the First Men which seemed to those who experienced it an
eternity of war.</p>

<p>As the summer of 1914 advanced, our observers crowded in
ever-greater numbers into your world, seeking out among you suitable
minds in which and from which to observe your coming crisis. As a flock
of birds, before settling on a tree, hovers for a. moment while each
individual selects a convenient twig, so we settled upon your race. The
tree knows nothing of its living burden; you were wholly ignorant of
your Neptunian guests.</p>

<p>Long before this great company began to arrive, those of us who,
like myself, are specialists in your epoch had, of course, already been
at work among you, wandering from mind to mind and studying the great
movements of human history which were to 'result in your crisis. But in
1914 an immensely greater company gathered to watch in as much detail
as possible your reaction to the unprecedented events of the next four
years. In spite of this influx, of observers, not every one of you
could be directly studied. But a considerable proportion of the total
European population harboured within themselves Neptunian visitors. We
diligently sought out all those who were significant, not only those in
prominent positions but very many obscure persons who seemed to afford
peculiarly lucid examples of your nature and of the trend of thought
and feeling in your day. Such persons would have been astounded had
they known that they were singled out for study along with generals and
political leaders; but in truth it was in the masses, rather than in
their leaders, that the real drama of the war was taking place. For in
the leaders the poignancy and subtlety of experience was in most cases
reduced by the necessity of pursuing some official policy.</p>

<p>Throughout the summer of 1914, then, a huge anthropological
expedition, organized on Neptune two thousand million years in the
future, was invading your minds in its thousands and its hundreds of
thousands. Yet also (to repeat) at the very same time, in the Neptunian
sense, other and even greater expeditions were at work upon crises of
one or other of the sixteen human species which have their historical
location between the First Men and the Last Men. Thus some were
studying the fall of the noble Second Men in their long struggle with
the cloud-like Martian invaders; others watched the heroic colonization
of Venus by the Fifth Men, the last Terrestrials; others, most
fortunate, wandered among the lyrical minds of the pygmy Flying Men of
Venus, the Seventh species; and many more carried out their devoted
work in the field of man's age-long and tortured struggle to take root
on Neptune; others again studied the later and happier Neptunian races.
But these expeditions I must not now describe, for my concern is with
yourselves. In our work upon the First Men we have concentrated our
main force in your own crucial age.</p>

<p>In every European capital, in every drab provincial town, in every
agricultural district, our observers settled. Had you been gifted with
Neptunian vision, you might have seen, whenever you walked in the
streets of Berlin, Paris, or London, that the crowd was composed of
persons of two kinds. Most of them were uncontaminated members of your
species; but about one in twenty (at least in these metropolitan areas)
would have appeared to you curiously altered. You would have seen in
the expression of their eyes, had you peered closely at them, a fitful
gleam, a faint surprise, verging on bewilderment, a queer inwardness
combined oddly with an increased intensity of observation and interest,
in fact an almost haunted look, which the Neptunian has learned to
recognize in such of you as have been singled out by one of his
colleagues as a convenient observation-point. It is not surprising that
you should manifest some outward symptom when you are thus possessed,
as it were, by an all-pervading mental parasite, whose filaments reach
into every nook and cranny of your minds. Yet so subtle is this
unintentional influence of ours, that the hosts themselves are, as a
rule, completely unaware of it, and even their most intimate friends do
not notice any alteration in them. Only to Neptunians, using the eyes
of other individuals of your species is the 'possessed' look apparent.
Sometimes, of course, we deliberately make our presence felt by some
act of definite influence, and when such influence is frequent, the
host himself may have a sense that he is somehow possessed, or going
mad. But the more passive presence of a Neptunian produces only a
slight increase of the intensity of consciousness, and especially of
self-consciousness.</p>

<p>Conceive then that, before war was declared, Neptunian observers
were busy making themselves acquainted with their chosen hosts. That we
concentrated in greatest number upon the years of the war and the two
decades following, is not to be attributed to any special preference
for the mentality of your Twentieth over your Nineteenth Century. As
between the generations which, through complacent materialism and
sentimentality, brought the war into being, and the generation which,
through moral timidity and lack of faith in the human nature of the
'enemy', allowed itself to be herded into the trenches, and again the
later generations, which, attaining maturity when the war was over,
blamed its predecessors or malicious fate for its own supine laziness
and lack of vision,--as between these three groups of persons we have
no predilection. To us all alike are 'human', in the manner
characteristic of a half-human species. Each is the inevitable product
of its predecessors and its world, yet each is in part responsible for
its own turpitude. This is, I know, a paradox which must remain
insoluble upon your plane of understanding. But to us, there is no
paradox. All your generations appear equally culpable, equally
pitiable. But since, in the war itself and its consequences, the whole
drama of your species finds its climax, it is in the war period and the
decades following it that our observers chiefly congregate.</p>

<p>Very thoroughly the pioneers had already sifted your populations for
significant individuals, so that when the main expedition arrived it
was possible to allocate each new-comer to a suitable host. Most often
(but not always) we set our women observers to study Terrestrial women.
And as far as possible we contrived to arrange matters so that there
should be some kind of temperamental similarity between observer and
observed; for thus, we find, the work proceeds most smoothly and
effectively. Some of us occupied the minds of the politicians on whose
decision so much was to depend, seeking to understand and sympathize
with their ingrained political convictions, sorting out the obscure
tangle of self-interest and public loyalty which was to determine their
behaviour, harking back now and then into their youth or childhood, or
even infancy, to discover the submerged sources of their whims,
delusions and prejudices. Others of us familiarized themselves with the
astounding mixture of honest heart-searching and intricate
self-deception which was the habitual attitude of your religious
leaders to all serious problems, and was so soon to find its most
striking expression in the futility of your churches in the face of
war. Yet others were savouring the insistent itch of military experts
to put their huge lethal toy in action, or the mere boyish braggartism,
a relic of the heroic age, which infected your more romantic
militarists.</p>

<p>In varying degrees of minuteness we have studied your Asquith and
your Grey, your Bethmann-Hollweg, your von B&uuml;low and your
Treitschke, your Hindenburg, your Foch, your Clemenceau and your Lloyd
George. Each of these, though not one of them is intrinsically of
serious interest to us, has called for careful study on account of the
momentous results of his actions. Your Lenin, however, we have studied
in greater detail; many of my colleagues have had occasion to live
through all the phases of that remarkable spirit, in whom, as in no
other, we find a most instructive blend of that which might have saved
your species with that which was bound to destroy it.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have performed curious experiments by introducing into
one mind thoughts and valuations derived from another, as in biological
research the experimenter may introduce blood or portions of tissue
from one organism to another. Thus it has proved instructive to
bewilder statesmen at the council table by momentarily forcing upon
them ideas disruptive of their policies and their most cherished
faiths. For instance, one of my most brilliant young colleagues, fresh
from the revolutionary and exiled Lenin, once contrived, that Asquith,
the legal-minded premier, in the presence of his cabinet, should sink
for a moment into horrified abstraction while a blast of revolutionary
schemes and cravings fell on him like a whirlwind. It was indeed
instructive to observe how, after the attack the ageing statesman
soothed himself by dipping into Carlyle's French Revolution, and by
slightly changing his attitude to the Welsh thorn in his flesh. Of
deeper effects we observed none.</p>

<p>To give another example of this transfusion of thought, Lenin
himself, that man of stainless steel, that future Almighty, was once,
to his own surprise, so flooded with the timid megalomaniac fantasies
of the Czar, that he found himself pitying, even pitifully loving that
imperial half-wit. On another occasion, while he was in the act of
composing a relentless article on the baseness of an archimandrite, my
colleague forced upon him a precise apprehension of the old villain's
mind. He suddenly realized in imagination that this profligate priest
had once yearned toward the supernal beauty, and that even yet his
blind spirit carried out by rote the gesture of prostration before the
great lover, Jesus. This incident had a strange and significant effect
on the revolutionary. Pent-up springs of mercy and piety welled in him.
He experienced, as few Christians have ever experienced, the divinity
of Love. Sitting in his hired room in Paris, with the indictment of the
priest spread out on the table before him, he whom many were yet to
call Anti-Christ, received the divine love into his heart. My young
colleague who was in charge of the experiment reports that his host
accepted the revelation like any Christian saint, and that for an hour
he remained in ecstasy. At the close of that period he whispered in his
Russian speech, 'I come not to bring peace, but a sword', and so once
more took up his pen.</p>

<p>Not only men of action, but leaders of thought, too, our observers
inhabited. In many minds of writers and artists they had detected in
the 'pre-war' age the first stirrings of that disillusionment and
horror which the war climate was later to foster.</p>

<p>Earlier they had seen the English Tennyson, under the influence of
science and a friend's death, face the spectre for a moment, only to
cover his eyes and comfortably pray. Carlyle they had seen praise
action as a drug for doubt. But now, they saw the writings of Thomas
Hardy, formerly neglected, gradually compel men's attention more by
their gloomy verisimilitude, than by their obscure conviction of
cosmical beauty. In each people our observers heard already, in the
midst of the complacency of that age, a whisper of uneasiness, rising
here and there to despair. Already the old gods were failing, and no
new gods appeared to take their place. The universe, it seemed, was a
stupendous machine, grinding for no purpose. Man's mind was but a
little friction upon a minor axle, a casual outcome of natural law. He
dared not even regard himself as the one divine spark in a waste of
brute matter; for he himself was just matter, and his behaviour the
expression of his brute nature. Moreover, Freud had spoken, and ripples
of horror were already spreading across Europe.</p>

<p>But there was Evolution. Our observers watched Bergson and all those
whose faith was given to evolution champion their doctrine of a
biological deity with something of the fervour of the old church
militant. Their gospel touched few hearts. Disillusionment was already
in the air. In laboratories our observers watched great scientists
conduct their crucial experiments, and weave their theories, so subtle,
so wide-sweeping, so devastating, so true on one plane and so
meaningless on another. Again and again we have seen the truth missed
when it was hidden only by a film. Again and again we have watched
promising enterprises run to waste through the influence of some mad
whim or prejudice. In many a study and on many a college lawn we have
noted the turn of argument wherein acute minds first began to stray
down some blind alley, or first tethered themselves to false
assumptions.</p>

<p>But the overwhelming majority of our explorers were concerned with
humbler persons. Our pioneers had flitted from mind to mind among
artisans, factory hands, dock labourers, peasants, private soldiers, in
search of those most significant or most subject to Neptunian
influence, so that the main company should be able to settle promptly
into posts of vantage for their work. If you incline to commiserate
with those of us to whom it was allotted to observe simple minds in
obscure positions, you are under a misconception. The difference
between your mentally richest and your mentally poorest is negligible
to us.</p>

<p>We have sat all day on heaps of road metal in country lanes,
wielding a hammer, and savouring humble thoughts in minds not barren
but not fortune-favoured. In French peasants we have driven sewage
carts over our hectares, estimating the unsown crop, and the cost, and
the sowing. In Prussian military messes we have drunk to 'der Tag'. In
British foc's'les, homeward bound from Yokohama and Kobe, we have
looked back upon Geisha girls; forward to the wife in Canning Town. In
provincial suburbs we have pondered the sententious wisdom of
scavengers, while they: pushed their hand-carts and condescended to
speak with tramps; We have been present with trapped miners, while the
flooding water crept up legs and bodies, or lungs were invaded by
hostile gases. We have listened to doomed men chanting under the roots
of mountains. Some of us, in zeal to observe last acts of piety or
panic, have been destroyed in the destruction of their hosts. In
factories we have spent our Terrestrial years feeding voracious
machines and dreaming impossible triumphs or love idylls. On holidays
we have been borne by the released flood of our fellow-workers along
esplanades and heaths. Over shop-counters in Bond Street and the rue de
Rivoli we have fingered camisoles, stockings, dress pieces. We have
pondered, tone by tone, clich&eacute; by clich&eacute;, the intercourse
of customers and shop-girls. We have jostled around buses and down
subways, and hurried into city offices. In third-class railway
carriages we have read innumerable evening papers through the eyes of
clerks and typists, devouring the murders and the sex, skimming the
politics. In the discreet darkness of picture palaces we have had
forbidden tactual intimacies. In jails we have estimated the
civilization of Europe through the rage of its outcasts. We have
battered impotently on cell doors, counted and recounted the threads of
spider-webs, strained to catch sounds of the world's great tide of
life, which had left us stranded. We have entered into inmates of
lunatic asylums, to gain insight into your mentality by watching its
disintegration. We know also what it is to be segregated as mad by a
world madder than oneself. In public-houses and Bier Stuben we have
escaped for a while from nagging reality through the cheap ecstasy of
inebriation. Or, less forlorn, we have found in the applause of our
companions false consolation for our defeat in life.</p>

<p>More precisely it was our hosts that had all these experiences,
while we, calm scrutinizers, appraised their minds. With the patience
of big-game photographers, who endure tropical heat and drought or
stand up to the neck in marsh for the sake of one snap of the
camera-shutter, we have suffered interminable floods of rhetoric and
infantile philosophy, in the hope of confronting one of those rare
denizens of the mind's jungle, those most vital and significant mental
occurrences, which give insight into the mentality of an alien
species.</p>

<p>We have also suffered vicariously the pains, both maternal and
filial, of many births. We have watched the clean pages of many infant
minds ignorantly scribbled over with indelible fears and loathings, We
have experienced in many young things the same hungers and worships
that we ourselves have known in our own far-future childhood upon
Neptune. But in Terrestrial childhood we find these young healthy lusts
and admirations all poisoned, misdirected, blunderingly thwarted or
sapped, so that again and again we are reminded that the folly of your
generation, as of every generation of your species, is due less to its
innate coarseness of fibre than to the disastrous influence of its
parents and teachers. Could we but, like your Pied Piper, rescue all
your infants from their mothers and fathers, could we but transport
them to Neptune, even with their ineradicable simian impulses and their
inherited distortions of mind and body, could we but keep them from the
contamination of their elders, what a race we could make of them! We
could not indeed bring them further than the threshold of true
humanity, but within their natural limits they might be made generous,
free-minded, zestful, unafraid, Then, if we could but return them to
your planet in the first bloom of maturity, how they would remake your
world! But instead they must remain unfulfilled, like seeds which,
blown into a cave, send forth long pale stems and flaccid leaves,
seeking in vain the light.</p>

<p>The many boys and girls whom we have seen, confident at first that
life held in store for them some as yet unimaginable treasure or some
opportunity of high devotion, already in a few years disillusioned! We
have encountered them at first unsullied, equipped by nature to learn
prowess of body and mind, to advance from triumph to triumph of skilled
and generous living, Then we have seen their bodies hampered,
constricted, poisoned by misguided care, and their spirits even more
seriously maltreated. Though in physical athletics they have often been
patiently trained to habits of free and effective action, in the
athletics of the mind and of the spirit they have acquired a cramped
style and blind tactics, In the great game of life they never learned
to keep their eyes on the ball. For them indeed the ball was invisible.
They hit out stiffly or limply at nothing at all, or at hypnotic
hallucinations, conjured before them by the exhortations of blind
coaches.</p>

<p>Everywhere we have found in the lives of grown men and women a
bewildered futility and resentfulness. The men blamed the women for
their hobbled lives, the women the men for their servitude. The rich
blamed the poor for disloyalty, the poor the rich for tyranny, the
young blamed the old for lack of vision, the old the young for
rebelliousness. And increasingly, even in that age before the war men
and women, rich and poor, old and young, were beginning to suspect that
they were playing their brief game in a madhouse with no rules and a
phantom ball. .</p>

<p>No wonder that in our research among the aged of that time we found
very prevalent a most tragic condition of the spirit. In. numerable old
men and old women, looking back with conscious complacency upon their
achievements, and forward with confidence to their reward in heaven,
were yet haunted in the recesses of their being with a sense that their
lives had been phantasmal, that they had never really lived at all.
Most of them were able on the whole to ignore these deep whispers of
misgiving, or to drown them with vociferous piety; but many of the more
self-conscious old people whom we studied, whether successful business
men or members of the 'professions', socially triumphant old ladies or,
retired matrons of institutions, reviewed their careers with blank
dissatisfaction and a nightmare sense that in their moment of living
they had missed some great drudgery-redeeming good, simply by looking
in the wrong direction. Only those whose lives had been dominated by
concrete misfortune or disappointment, or by the demands of some
all-absorbing heroic ministration, escaped this universal distaste of
all values.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of the First Men as it was revealed to our
observers in their survey of the years before the outbreak of the
European War. Such were the beings that they studied. On the whole they
found themselves forced to be twi-minded about these distressful
creatures. From one point of view, as I have said, they could not but
regard your species as not yet human; a thing incredibly stupid and
insensitive, incredibly distorted and tortured by the fantastic habits,
the rudimentary' culture' which alone distinguished it from the lower
beasts; a thing in some ways further removed from true humanity even
than ox or tiger, because it had strayed further down the wrong path; a
thing incomparably more filthy than the baboon, because, retaining
brutality, it had lost innocence and learned to affect righteousness; a
thing which was squandering the little powers that it had stumbled upon
for ends essentially the same as the ends of monkeys, and in its
frantic grabbing, devouring, voiding, had fouled a whole planet.</p>

<p>But from the other point of view our observers were forced to admit,
at first reluctantly, that this errant and brutal thing had in it the
distinctive essence which is man. Penetrating with difficulty into the
minds of tiger and baboon to compare them with your species, they found
indeed less brutality, but also less divinity; in fact a greater
emptiness. In you they recognized the first blind restlessness of the
spirit, which never troubles the mere beast, and wins its beatitude
only in the full human estate. In you they found the rudimentary
insight of the mind into itself and into others, that insight which lay
beyond the reach of all Terrestrial organisms save Homo Sapiens and the
Philosophical Lemurs, whose far more brilliant achievement man himself
had terminated. In you they found love, though more often hate; in you
philosophy though halting and superstitious; in you worship, though for
the most part directed on unworthy objects.</p>

<p>All this might have been truly said of your species at any time of
its career; but, at the moment which I am now describing, it was
balanced on a still finer knife-edge between beast and man. This was
due not to any change in its nature but to the pressure of
circumstances. Hitherto, though a sensitive minority had been aware
that the aims toward which men commonly strove were for the most part
puerile, the majority were able to pursue these aims in undisturbed
complacency. But in 1914 many forces were combining to shock even minds
of average percipience into a sense of the contemptible insufficiency
of the extant plan of human life, both individual and social. It is
worthwhile to enumerate these forces. First, then, although the nations
and races were still violently opposed to one another in sentiment, the
world was already becoming a single economic system. Each section was
growing more and more dependent on the healthy life of others.
Secondly, though national and racial cultures were still for the most
part mutually unintelligible and repugnant, the seeds of an
all-inclusive world culture were already quickening. Third, the battle
between doctrinal religion and scientific materialism, in which science
had been steadily advancing all along the line, was already beginning
to dissolve and crystallize out in a new alignment. For while the old
religion was beginning to seem not only intellectually incredible but
also spiritually insufficient, the old science was already appearing
not only spiritually arid but intellectually naive. Fourth, man's
increasing awareness of his littleness under the stars was combining
with his first crude apprehension of the cosmical enterprise of Life to
give him a wider horizon, a new humility, and also the first obscure
glimpse of a new aim. Unfortunately in 1914 the effect of these forces
was nowhere profound; and only in certain regions of the Western
Civilization was it at all widespread. It was not strong enough to
prevent the outbreak of war. All it produced was a devastating, though
mostly unacknowledged, suspicion in all the combatants that human
nature had failed.</p>

<h3>ii. EUROPE CHOOSES WAR</h3>

<p>In August 1914 it was said by the more thoughtful among you that a
great war in Europe might well cause the' downfall' of civilization.
They expected that the war would lead at once to complete economic and
social confusion. In this prophecy they were wrong. They underestimated
the recuperative powers of their material civilization. But the war was
to cause a disaster more subtle and profound than any which was
foreseen in 1914. It was to undermine man's confidence in his own
nature. Henceforth your species was to suffer a kind of racial neurosis
blended of guilt, horror, inferiority, and hate. Not only civilization
was to be undermined, but the integrity of a species.</p>

<p>In the fateful days when ultimatums and declarations of war were
being bandied from capital to capital, the population of Europe was
wholly unprepared to take the one line which could have saved it. It
had neither the courage nor the imagination for a general to fight. On
the other hand it could not accept the war innocently, as earlier
generations had accepted wars. Hitherto men had fought with a clear
conscience, however much they might personally loathe the distresses
that war must bring. But, since the last war in Europe, a change had
begun to come over men's minds. Though it was not yet possible for the
masses to reject war, it was no longer possible for them to accept it
without guilt. Few, even of those who suffered no conscious
heart-searching, were wholly immune from that unwitting shame and
embitterment which was the characteristic mood of your war-tortured
populations, and had never occurred at all widely in any earlier
war.</p>

<p>It was extremely interesting to observe within minds of various
types the different reactions of your species to the novel fact of war.
Most were taken completely by surprise. In the manner characteristic of
their species they had lived hitherto without serious thought 'for
matters of public concern. The rivalries of national states might
indeed rouse in them some sentimental interest, but the life of the
race lay almost wholly beyond their grasp. They were fully occupied in
keeping themselves and their families afloat in the maelstrom of
economic individualism. Inevitably their chief concern was private
fulfilment, and its essential means, money. National affairs, racial
affairs, cosmical events, were of interest to them only in their
economic bearing, or at most as occasions of curiosity, wonder or
ridicule. They produced and consumed, bought and sold, played ritual
games with balls, and transported themselves hither and thither in
mechanical vehicles in search of a goal which ever eluded them. They
indulged in illicit sexual intercourse; or with public applause they
married, propagated, launched their children upon the maelstrom. They
put on their best clothes on Sunday, and after church or chapel they
walked in the park. Or, with a sense less of moral guilt than of social
degradation, they spent their Sundays in old clothes and upon congenial
occupations. Almost invariably they applauded the things they had been
taught to revile. Or, if they were' original' and dared to think and
feel spontaneously, they found themselves harassed both by their
fellows and by their own archaic consciences. They then either recanted
or developed into extravagant cranks. But these were few. The
overwhelming majority were enslaved by the custom of the herd.</p>

<p>Such were the beings on whom the fate of the Terrestrial spirit now
depended. Nowhere was there any clear perception of the issues at
stake, nowhere any recognition that the species was faced with the
supreme crisis of its career. Scarcely a man or woman in Europe or
America, still less in the remote East, realized that the great test of
the human animal had come, and come, alas, too soon.</p>

<p>In their reaction to war, Western men and women revealed, themselves
as falling into a few well-marked types, which nevertheless graded into
one another. Indeed, scarcely any individuals could be said to belong
wholly to any one type. In almost all there were traces of every kind
of war sentiment, and in many there was an almost diurnal fluctuation
of mood from one to another. Nevertheless Western Europeans may be
significantly classified according to their most characteristic
attitude to the war as' follows:</p>

<p>First, in every nation there was the incredibly large swarm of'
persons who, in spite of their vociferous patriotism, were at most
tinles incapable of taking the war seriously in any sense except as a
source of possible danger or profit to themselves. Such creatures we
found in all classes, from manual labourers to captains of industry and
respected statesmen. In the armies also we found, many, who had failed
to evade their military obligations. They were of all orders of
intelligence, from the very stupid to the acute; but even the most
brilliant of them lacked the power to see beyond the horizon of
private, or at most family, interest. They were nearly always quite
unconscious of their own deficiency; yet almost with the unwitting
mimicry shown by some insects, they managed to behave, verbally at
least, with impeccable correctness. They were seldom suspected of being
inhuman. Often have we experinlented on these backward animals,
striving to introduce into the mind of some munition-profiteer, some
popular demagogue, some climbing staff-officer, or some abject shirker
in the ranks, glimmers of a self-oblivious view. Most often the
experiment has failed completely; but in some cases we have been
rewarded by a curious spectacle. The little self, outraged by the
incursion of unself-centred fantasies, has called 'morality' or 'duty'
to its assistance. The ambitious general, for instance, troubled for a
moment by the sacrifice of life entailed in some brilliant barren
attack, has told himself that it is necessary, and could not see that
he was caring only for his reputation as a resolute commander.</p>

<p>The second type recorded by our observers was less contemptible, but
almost as backward. These were the persons who, though often strong in
a kind of social sense, innocently accepted war and the martial code.
Their vision was limited to the hero ideal. They saw the war in the
good old way as a supreme opportunity of personal courage and devotion.
It came, they said, to purge men of the selfishness bred of
industrialism and of the softness bred of security. These guiltless
champions of the war might personally behave toward it either with
cowardice or heroism; but they never questioned it. With complete
sincerity they faced it as a god-sent ordeal. For them it was indeed a
religious test, an opportunity to enter into communion with some
obscurely conceived heroic deity. To speak against it was sacrilege;
but a sacrilege so gross and fantastic that it should be regarded as a
sign rather of idiocy than of wickedness. Consequently, though they
condemned pacifism whole-heartedly, there was no vindictiveness in
their condemnation. Again and again our observers, experimenting in
these simple minds, have tried to introduce some doubt, some
apprehension that there might be another side to the matter. But such
doubts as could be introduced appeared to the subject himself as merely
an intellectual exercise, not as a live issue. Such images of brutality
and disgust as were introduced were accepted simply as tests of
fortitude.</p>

<p>Curiously it was among these archaic souls, these happy warriors,
that we sometimes came upon a pellucid kind of religious experience.
Fortunate innocents, they were exempt from the guilt and torture which
wrecked so many of their fellows. For them the issue was a clear issue
between self-regard and loyalty to all that they most cherished. And
those who had the strength to bear themselves throughout according to
their code had the reward of a very sweet and well-deserved beatitude.
We attended many a death-agony that was thus redeemed, especially in
the earliest phase of the war. Many an old regular thus found his rest.
Many a very young subaltern, whose photograph on the parental
mantelpiece truthfully commemorated a bright immaculate boy-soldier,
found in his last moment that peace which passed his simple
understanding. But many more, to whom death came less suddenly or more
brutally, could not attain that bliss. Hundreds, thousands of these
luckless beings, betrayed by their god, we have watched slipping down
into the gulf of death, clutching, screaming, bewildered and indignant,
or utterly dehumanized by pain.</p>

<p>More common than the 'happy warriors' was a third type, namely those
who, having passed in spirit beyond this knightly innocence, still
tried to retain it. These, when the war began, were first shocked and
tom asunder by conflicting motives, by loyalty to the old idea of War
and by the obscure stirrings of something new which they dared not
clearly face. For, in spite of all their regrets and compassion, they
very deeply lusted for war. And because this new thing that disturbed
them ran counter to this lust and to the familiar code, they strove to
ignore it. Or they persuaded themselves that though war was an evil,
this war was a necessary evil. They elaborated all manner of arguments
to convince themselves that their country's cause was the cause of
humanity, or that the War, though tragic, would result in a great moral
purgation. They eagerly accepted every slander against the enemy, for
it was very urgent for these distraught spirits to believe that the
enemy peoples were almost sub-human. Only so could they feel confident
that the War was right, and indulge their martial zeal with a clear
conscience. The pacifists they condemned even more bitterly than the
enemy, for in tormenting the pacifists they seemed to be crushing the
snake in their own hearts.</p>

<p>The fourth type, though not actually a majority in all lands, had
the greatest influence, because in most of the other types the
sentiment of this fourth type was present in some considerable degree.
These were at the outset little stirred by patriotism, and for them war
had but a slight romantic appeal. They thought only of individual lives
and happiness, and nearest their hearts were the lives and happiness of
their fellow-countrymen. Under the influence of the lying propaganda
with which the spirit of each nation was poisoned by its government,
they sincerely believed that the enemy government was in the wrong, and
was carrying out a base policy by brutal measures. But they preserved
their sanity so far as to believe that the enemy peoples were on the
whole not very different from themselves. As individuals the enemy were
'just ordinary decent folk' who, through some lack of resolution, had
been led into a false policy. Consequently (so it was said) the 'group
spirit' of these swarms of harmless enemy individuals was unhealthy. In
the mass they were a danger to civilization, and so at all costs they
must be beaten.</p>

<p>Such was the attitude of most men and many women in both the opposed
groups of peoples. They lacked faith in human nature. And through their
lack of faith in it they betrayed it. They might so easily have risen
up in their millions in all lands to say, 'This war must stop; we will
not fight.' Yet of course, though in a sense so easy, such a refusal
was also utterly impossible to them. Because they were without any
perception of man's true end, because they accepted the world as it
stood and human nature as it seemed, they inevitably missed the great
opportunity, and condemned their species to decline. Pitiable beings,
they brought upon their own heads, and upon the future, deluges of
pain, grief, despair, all through lack of vision, or of courage. They
manned a thousand trenches, endured a thousand days and nights of ennui
or horror, displayed what in your kind is called superb devotion. All
this they did, and all for nothing. They thrust bayonets into one
another's entrails, they suffered nightmares of terror, disgust and
frantic remorse. They were haunted by bloody and filthy memories, and
by prospects of desolation. Those of them who were parents gave up
their sons, those who were women gave up their men, and all for
nothing; or for a hope that was as impossible, as meaningless, as
self-contradictory, as a round square, for the mad hope that war should
end war. They believed that from their agony there must spring anew,
fair world. But in fact through their lack of faith in one another the
whole future of their species was overclouded.</p>

<p>The fifth type that we discovered was actually opposed to the war.
There were many kinds of pacifists. A few were those naive beings who,
loyal to the Christian faith both in the spirit and the letter, simply
accepted the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill', and thought no further.
But the main body of effective pacifists, even of those who gave as
their motive 'religious scruples', were of a very different water. One
and all, though they knew it not were ruled by that imperious, but
still unformulated impulse which I have already noted in the case of
Paul, the impulse of loyalty to the dawning spirit of man. But since
the real spring of their conduct Was still so obscure, they had to
rationalize it in various manners. Many supposed themselves to be moved
simply by the Christian faith. But indeed in these, so our observers
discovered, it was not Christianity that had bred pacifism, but
pacifism that had given Christianity a new significance. Strong in the
intuitive loyalty to the great adventure of the Terrestrial mind, they
interpreted that intuition as loyalty to the Christian God. They
strove, so they said, to love their fellows as Jesus had bidden them,
but also they strove to love Jesus himself even more. And for them
Jesus, though they knew it not, was the divine spirit embodied in their
groping species.</p>

<p>Others there were, upon whom the basis of the same intuition
constructed other rationalizations. Some, believing that they cared
only for the happiness of individuals, declared that the misery of war
must far outweigh all its good effects. They cared nothing for national
honour, nothing for treaty obligations to defend weak peoples, nothing
for the propagation of national culture. These, they said, were mere
phantoms, for which not one life should be sacrificed. Better for the
weak peoples to have their countries occupied peaceably than turned
into a battlefield. Let them be defended not by force but by the
pressure of world-opinion. As for culture, it was worth nothing if it
depended on bayonets and guns. Nothing whatever mattered, so they
affirmed, but the happiness of individuals. Yet all the while these
hedonistic pacifists unwittingly drew the fervour which made them face
tribunals, prison, and in some cases a firing party, not from their
liberal individualism but from that deep and obscure intuition that the
human race was no mere swarm of happy-unhappy individuals, but a vessel
still unfilled, an instrument still roughly fashioned, and some day to
be used for cosmical achievement. For this they went to prison, for
this they resisted the taunts of their own herd-consciences. For this
they died; and because they felt it in their hearts that the Western
peoples must now at last dare to say, each to the other, 'Rather than
make war, we will let you overrun our lands, sequester our goods, sleep
with our wives, educate our children to your way of living. For we are
all equal vessels of the one spirit, we and you.'</p>

<p>Such was the composition of Europe when the war began. There was the
great host of those who regarded it almost solely from the personal
point of view; the smaller company of martial romantics; the
conflict-racked enemy-haters and pacifist-baiters; the swarms of
unimaginative loyal folk, who accepted the war as the only way to
preserve human happiness, but were sorely perplexed by the savagery
that was expected of them; the minute band of those who intuited that
war between modern civilized men was utter folly and sacrilege, than
which there could be no worse alternative.</p>

<p>Of these last the more resolute and the more pugnacious refused
absolutely to have any part in the great madness, and were therefore
persecuted, imprisoned, or even shot. But others, like Paul, less
heroic, less confident of their own opinion, or more sympathetic to the
great public agony, could not bring themselves to stand aside inactive.
They chose therefore to help the wounded, to expose themselves so far
as was permitted, to accept so far as possible on the one hand the
great common agony, and on the other the private loneliness of those
who cannot share the deepest passions of their fellows.</p>

<p>To Neptunian observers these perplexed beings were the most
significant matter for study, for in them the balance between the
archaic and the modern was most delicate. The conflict which in most
had been violently solved, in one way or the other, was in these ever
present and insoluble.</p>

<h3>iii. EUROPE AT WAR</h3>

<p>Viewed from the moon, and with eyes such as yours, your little Great
War would have been invisible, save through a powerful telescope, which
would have revealed it as a minute and intermittent smoky stain on the
dimly green surface of Europe. To the Martians, those intelligent
clouds who in the fullness of time were to invade your planet, it was
unnoticeable. With optical organs much more powerful than any
terrestrial telescope, their astronomers were already observing the
Earth as a promised land seen from Pisgah. But what concerned them was
your atmosphere, your plentiful water, your vegetation. They sometimes
wondered whether the many smears and stipples of cloud which kept
appearing and disappearing in your temperate zones were intelligent
organisms like themselves. But they guessed that it was not so. They
detected normal clouds of vapour, and, much more rarely, clouds of
smoke and dust, which they rightly believed to be of volcanic origin,
The minute traces produced by your war were assumed to be of the latter
type. It did not occur to the Martians that these were artificial
smoke-palls, beneath which the proud denizens of Earth were blundering
through a great, though a fantastic agony.</p>

<p>Even to the average Terrestrial, your little Great War was a minor
and a remote disturbance. A few miles behind the lines one might often
find complete rural peace, marred only by distant muttering. Across the
English Channel men sometimes heard with awe the sound of the guns; but
the widespread sense that the tragedy in France had somehow changed the
spirit of peaceful landscapes in Surrey, Cumberland, or the distant
Hebrides, was but a projection of war-haunted minds. The psychological
reverberations of the war did indeed spread far afield. Few comers of
Europe escaped such serious influences as the removal of their young
men, the rationing of their food, the over-work of their remaining
inhabitants. Throughout the continent there was a sense, illusory but
profound, that war had somehow altered the very constitution of the
universe; or that it had laid bare the sinister depths of existence,
which hitherto had been concealed by the scum, the multi-coloured film,
of Nineteenth-century civilization. But elsewhere, over whole
continents the military operations were known only as a distant marvel,
romantic, magical, scarcely real. Folk tilled and hunted, copulated and
bore children, propitiated the gods of rain and storm, trapped
marauding beasts and sometimes listened incredulously to travellers'
tales of the White Man's War. In more remote parts of the earth, on the
upper reaches of the Amazon, in African jungles, and on the Thibetan
plateau, there were isolated folk who never heard rumour of your war
until after it had ceased.</p>

<p>But to most Europeans it did indeed seem that when the war began the
whole ground-tone of existence was altered. For a few months many clung
to the conviction that this profound change of key was for the good, a
transition from the sordid, though safe, to the heroic, though
tortured. The Germans pressed forward toward Paris, that mythical city
of delight. The French and the British 'gallantly contested every
inch', and at last 'miraculously' they held their own. Stories of
heroism and horror percolated through Europe, stories of the incredible
effects of high-explosive shells, of great buildings collapsing like
card-houses, of men's bodies blown to pieces or mown down in hundreds
by machine-guns. All this was at first accepted as quite in order,
quite as it should be, in the new bewildering heroic universe that had
come into being. Amiable bank-clerks and shop-keepers began to spend
their leisure in learning to be 'frightful' in the sacred cause,
learning to give the right sort of lunge with a bayonet, to stick it
successfully into a belly; learning the right twist to release it. Paul
in those early days had bought a little red manual of military
training, in which he diligently studied the theory of co-operative
slaughter. Here at last, he had told himself, was the grim and heroic
reality, the thing that had always lain behind this solid-seeming but,
in fact, phantasmal 'civilization'. Yet somehow the little book failed
to give him any sense of reality at all. It seemed entirely beside the
mark. This killing was after all a laborious, useless, imbecile
accomplishment, like learning to play the piano with your toes. Yes, it
was a new world that had come into being, and one took some time to get
the feel of it. Many people seemed to Paul to unearth a new self to
cope with it, a simpler, less doubting, more emotional self, a self
that concealed under righteous indignation a terrible glee in the
breakdown of old taboos. Even while they inveighed against the enemy's
rumoured brutality, these beings of the new world seemed to savour it
on the mental palate lingeringly, lustfully. They were trapped
hopelessly, these vengeful ones, trapped by the spirit of the archaic
animal from which the true spirit of man could not free itself. Talking
to such persons, Paul glimpsed images of the half-born foal, which,
through my influence, had so long haunted him.</p>

<p>Gradually the romantic early phase of your war was succeeded by
something very different. It almost seemed that man, in origin arboreal
and subsequently terrestrial, was to end his career as the greatest and
most noxious of burrowing vermin. The armies dug themselves in. They
constructed immensely elongated and complex warrens, and settled down
to a subterranean life of tedium punctuated by horrors formerly
unimagined. It became evident to the combatants, and gradually to the
home populations also, that the war was not going to be what it ought
to have been. It was not a gentlemanly war. It was ruthless in a way
that made the wars of the history books seem temperate. It was a
life-and-death struggle in which rules were an abandoned. And it was
mechanized. The spirit of it was indeed a strange blend of the machine,
with its regularity and large-scale effectiveness, and the brute at
bay. It was an affair of stop-watches, mathematical calculations,
weight and frequency of projectiles, mechanical transport, railway
co-ordination; but also it Was an affair of mud, dust, blood, knives,
even teeth. Everything that happened in it had two sides, a mechanical
and a brutal, at the one end the exquisite designing, making, emplacing
and sighting of the great gun, at the other, the shattering of human
bodies, the agony of human minds. At one end the hum of munition
factories, at the other the corpse-laden mud of No-man's-land, and the
scream of tortured men out on the wire, imploring, inaccessible.
Machinery, that creature of human imagination, had seemingly turned
upon its creator, and was not only tearing up his body, but reducing
his mind to the brute level from which it had emerged. For strange and
disturbing things were now happening in civilized Europe. There were
still of course, plentiful stories of heroism; human nature was said to
be showing itself capable of unexpected devotion and fortitude. But
also there were whispers of something less reputable. The bravest and
most it seemed, might be suddenly converted into panic-stricken cattle,
trampling one another under foot. The most level-headed might suddenly
run mad. The most generous might suddenly indulge in brutality or
meanness. There were stories also of tragic muddle and betrayal of
duty, stories of British shells falling in British trenches, of troops
sent up to certain destruction through a staff-officer's blunder, of
supplies misdirected, of whole forlorn offensives launched for no
reason but to satisfy the pride of some general or politician.</p>

<p>There is no need for me to enlarge upon these matters. They have
been well enough recorded by your own scribes, and are, on the other
hand, of little interest to the Neptunian observers of your great
folly. Though more than ordinarily disastrous, they were but typical of
the blend of organization and chaos, which is the outstanding character
of your whole world-order. The Neptunian, studying that order, is
inevitably reminded of the fortuitous, unplanned organization, and the
blindly apt, but precarious behaviour of an ant colony. But though your
massed stupidity afforded us little interest, we found in the lives of
individual soldiers, and in their diverse adjustments to the war, much
to arrest our attention.</p>

<p>For the majority, adjustment consisted in acquiring the technique of
a new life, in learning to make good use of cover, to contrive some
slight animal comfort for oneself even in the trenches, to make the
best of minute pleasures, savouring them, drop by drop, to live upon
the hope of strawberry jam, or a parcel from home, or a letter in a
well-known hand, or a visit to some woman behind the lines; or, failing
these ecstasies, to make the best of plum jam, of a rum-ration, or of
sex without woman; to 'wangle' small privileges out of the great
military machine, to be expert in 'syst&egrave;me D'; and at the same
time to take deep into one's heart the soldier's morality of faithful
obedience to superiors, faithful loyalty to comrades, and complete
irresponsibility in respect of all things further afield; to live
within the moment and within the visible horizon; to shut the eyes of
the spirit against disgust, and stop the ears of the spirit against
horror, against self-pity, against doubt.</p>

<p>It is true that to many spiritually undeveloped beings the war-life
was a tonic. Many of those who had been nurtured in prosperity, or at
least in ease, who had never faced distress, and never been tortured by
compassion, were now roughly awakened. Generously they gave themselves,
and in the giving they found themselves. But others of their kind were
broken by the ordeal. The awakening came too late, or to natures
incapable of generosity.</p>

<p>But it was not in these, either the made or the marred, that our
observers were interested. We were concerned rather to watch the
adjustments of those in whom there was at work a force alien to the
simple soldier ideal. Many such have I myself inhabited. At the outset
they have gone forth with a sense that the heavens applaud them, that
there was a God whom they were serving, and who would recompense them
for their huge sacrifice with the inestimable prize of his approval.
But, Soon or late, their faith has been destroyed by the ugly facts of
war.</p>

<p>Let me tell of one case, unique, yet typical of thousands on both
sides of the line. From the Terrestrial point of view, the events which
I am about to relate were contemporary with the story of Paul, already
Partially recounted; and they culminated in 1917, when the war was far
advanced, and Paul had already been more than two years in France. But
from the Neptunian point of view my exploration of these events took
place some time before I had made the acquaintance of Paul. The
specimen case that I shall now report is one of my most interesting
treasures. Also, it nearly cost me my life.</p>

<p>He was a young German, a native of Neustadt in the Black Forest, and
he had been trained for the care of trees. His hands were skilled in
tending the baby pines in their crowded nurseries, and in planting them
out in the greater world of the forest. When he wielded the axe or the
saw, the deed was done with precision, and also with a deep sense of
fate. The resinous odour of the forest and of fresh-cut wood, the
ever-present vision of towering shafts and swaying branches, the
occasional glimpse of a deer,--these things he valued lightly while he
was yet with them; but when he was removed from them he longed for
them.</p>

<p>Now this young man, whom I will call Hans, had been selected for
study because, though he became a good soldier, he was more than a good
soldier. During his career as a forester I had found in him a very
unusual feeling for individual trees, and for the massed ranks of the
forest. He could not help regarding them as each one a unique spirit,
living according to the laws of its own being, and striving toward
perfection of life. In his capacity of woodman, tender in nurturing,
relentless in the final execution, he persuaded himself that, though to
the trees themselves the goal seemed to be merely endless enlargement
in girth and stature, he, in his lethal ministration, afforded them in
spite of themselves a nobler destiny, a fuller achievement. Sometimes
when he regarded a score or so of the great felled trunks, laid flank
to flank, with the resin still oozing from their clean-sawn wounds, he
would say to the standing forest, 'Do not pity them, for they have
gloriously attained their destiny.' Then with reverence, almost it
seemed with envy of this beatitude, he would lay his hand on the rough
and tawny skin of some prone giant, in a last salute. For the great
communal being of the forest, reclining so grandly on its many hills,
he had a feeling compounded of benevolence and awe. It was for him a
spirit, one of God's nobler creatures. When it began to be depleted for
the war he was distressed. But even the forest, he admitted, must be
sacrificed for that even nobler forest, the Fatherland.</p>

<p>He was a good son of the Fatherland, and also a good Catholic. They
told him that the English and the French were servants of Satan, who
wanted to harm the Fatherland. He went to the war filled with a sense
of glorious adventure in a great cause. He was very proud of his new
life. He cared for his rifle as he cared for his axe, and became as
deadly a shot as he was precise a sawyer. When he killed his first man,
with a bullet through the forehead, he had that sense of fate, and of
calm almost loving execution, which he had known in felling the beloved
trees in their ripeness. His next man he overcame in savage
hand-to-hand struggle in the dark. For the Fatherland and in defence of
his own life he did it; but there was no joy in it. Little by little he
earned a reputation for coolness and resolution. He volunteered for a
number of dangerous tasks and carried them out with distinction. When
steel helmets were issued, he was proud to wear one. Its noble curves
suggested the mythical heroes of his race. Its weight on his head
crowned him.</p>

<p>At first Hans thought of the war in terms of his forest-born
philosophy. He and his comrades were trees, who sought one destiny but
were to find another, less easeful but more fulfilling to the spirit.
But little by little it began to appear to him that this war, nay this
world, was no well-tended forest but a terrible primeval jungle in
which everything was crippled by everything else, and all things were
useless. He strove to put a way this thought by drugging himself with
war propaganda, or with duties, or with pleasures. But it would not
leave him. So greatly did it disturb him that everything began to seem
changed and sinister to him. Common objects looked at him meaningfully,
tauntingly. Empty tins and trampled cigarette-ends would leer at him
like little devils, deriding him for being trapped. His own hands in
their ordinary actions seemed somehow to reproach him for putting them
to serve the Devil. He had an overwhelming sense of betrayal. But
whether it was that he himself was betrayed, or that he had betrayed
something else, was never quite clear. Emblems of his religion,
encountered in shattered churches or shrines, sometimes reproached him
with his irrevocable treason; sometimes on the other hand they
confessed themselves mere jests perpetrated by the universal diabolic
power which had masqueraded as the God of Love. He began to think about
the men he had killed, and to see them again, especially at night,
especially a French corporal whose face he had smashed with a hand
grenade. His rifle now took on a snake-like coldness in his hands, so
that he shuddered. His helmet pressed on his forehead vindictively.
Over all things there was a kind of darkness, which was the worse
because he knew it was not 'real'. In his ears there began to be a
distant wailing as of wind, which when the great guns roared and
crashed, was yet heard screaming above them.</p>

<p>In fact, Hans was on the way to breakdown. Now Neptunian observers
found amongst you two kinds of breakdown, very different in origin.
Both types are of great interest to us, because the more effectively
integrated minds of our own species afford the psychologist no such
opportunity of study, even under the most severe strain. One type of
Terrestrial disorder, the commoner, was due to the conflict between
primitive biological impulses of self-preservation and the behaviour
imposed by military obligation. The other, which was more interesting
to us, sprang from the conflict between military obligation and the
still unrecognized impulse of loyalty to the striving Terrestrial
spirit. This was the conflict which was most seriously undermining
Hans, though the other also was of course adding to his distress. He
himself lacked the selfknowledge to understand his trouble. He thought
it was simply a trouble of the more primitive kind, and was bitterly
ashamed. He determined not to give way, but to pull himself together.
Both loyalty and self-pride demanded it.</p>

<p>In the case of Hans and a small minority of his fellow-men this
ruinous mental conflict was complicated by another and even less
understood division of the mind, namely by the fundamental and
insoluble problem of your species, the discord between loyalty to the
adventuring spirit of Man and on the other hand the ecstatic admiration
of fate even when tragic. Although deep in his heart Hans was coming to
realize that to fight for the Fatherland or any nation was treason to
Man, and that this war was diabolic, he had also a vivid though
unintelligible apprehension of the whole great hideous tumult as
somehow an expression of super-human, inhuman, beauty. His mind was
therefore tom by a three-cornered conflict, between old tribal loyalty,
the new loyalty to Man, and the zest of tragic existence.</p>

<p>It was with dreadful satisfaction that Hans found himself involved
once more in the centre of a great offensive. I, his indwelling
companion, knew that within the next few days he would meet his death;
but I did not know precisely when it would occur. I had therefore to
prepare myself to leave him by partially reverting my attention to my
own world. But at the same time it was necessary to observe him
closely, for the moments of his life which would be of supreme interest
to me were now at hand. I had also to keep a wary eye upon his
circumstances, lest I should be entangled with him in his death.</p>

<p>All this happened at a time when I had been rather too constantly
engaged on work in your world, and was so soaked in your mentality that
I could not at all easily disengage myself from it. Moreover I found
myself extremely reluctant to do so. Not only was I desirous to follow
Hans through to his last moment, and if possible to afford his tortured
spirit something of the Neptunian serenity, but also I was by now
trapped by an overwhelming affection for your tragic world. It was
therefore both with difficulty and with a strangely violent regret that
I set myself to recapture in imagination the wider horizons and the
crystalline titanic edifices of Neptune, the great limbs and eloquent
features of my own race. My regret alarmed me; for it was a sure sign
that I had stayed in your world much longer than was wholesome. Like
one lost in the snow, who has an overwhelming desire to lie down and
sleep, but knows that if he does he will never rise again, and never
complete his work, so I now realized that a great effort was necessary.
I began to goad myself by thinking of all the precious fruits of my
exploration, which, if I were to succumb, would never be delivered to
my own world.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the hour of the offensive was approaching. From the felt
tone of Hans's body, it was evident that he was going sick; but he
would not admit it to himself. He developed a distressing colic and
diarrhoea, but he clung to his post. He was seized also by a strong
premonition of death, an infection from my own awareness that this was
indeed his last battle. While he and his comrades were awaiting the
order to attack. Hans experienced a sudden increase of mental lucidity.
In desperate haste he reviewed his whole life, his whole experience of
existence. He was terrified at the contrast, not the physical but the
spiritual contrast, between his forest years and the present. Then,
there was a bland rightness about everything. Now, everything, even
generous and gallant action, was somehow evil, tainted by an
all-pervading shame. He said to himself. 'We have simply walked all
together into Hell.'</p>

<p>It was almost the moment of attack. I knew that he would survive the
storming of the enemy first-line trench; for I had previously learned
from a Neptunian colleague, who had already observed this action
through the eyes of another individual, that Hans was to be seen alive
in the trench. Therefore I felt secure enough to watch my man minutely
for a while, and to prepare his mind to meet death with peace, instead
of the rage and despair that had hitherto possessed him. While he was
still waiting inactive, Hans was very near to breaking-point. It seemed
possible that he would not obey the order to advance. But when the word
came, he clambered up with the rest; and as he pounded across the tract
of shell-torn earth and tangled wire, he suddenly blazed up with maniac
hate of the universe and all its denizens. In those moments it mattered
not at all to him whether his bayonet should pierce a blue or a grey
uniform. Nothing mattered, but that he should void the hate that was in
him. I felt a bullet tear one of his ears. He did not notice it. A near
shell killed the man on his right, and half-buried Hans himself. He
picked himself up and stumbled on.</p>

<p>It now became clear that I was far more dangerously entangled in
your world than I had thought; for at this moment, as I watched the
desperate plight of this blind half-human spirit, I found myself
suddenly undermined by doubt of my own Neptunian vision. Here was a
mind blessed neither with the insensitivity of the beast nor with the
all-redeeming vision of my own species, a mind deranged by the horror
and guilt of three years of war, and now overwhelmingly nauseated by
its own being and by the satanic universe which had spawned it only to
devour it, a mind which looked forward to nothing but horror and
annihilation for itself, and futility for its world. It suddenly
appeared to me that a universe in which such torture could occur must
be utterly vile, and that the Neptunian complacency was heartless. This
apostasy I noted with dismay; but by now I was in no mood to withdraw
myself into spiritual safety. More important it seemed to stay with
Hans, and afford him at all costs at least an illusory consolation.</p>

<p>While he was covering the last few paces to the enemy trench, I was
somewhat anxiously engaged in two very different undertakings. The
first was to thrust upon the mind of Hans an image of the forest, which
might serve as the starting-point for a spiritual change. The second,
which I undertook at first with reluctance, was to prepare myself for a
sudden exit from your world. I successfully established in him the
vision of lofty trunks and sombre foliage. As he plunged into the
trench with his bayonet in the neck of an enemy, this image took
possession of the deeper region of his mind. I then began to think more
conscientiously of my own safety, and to steady myself in earnest for
the leap to Neptune. I pictured my own far future body, lying asleep in
my subterranean garden. I dwelt upon the translucent features of the
woman called Panther. I reminded myself of the Mad Star and of the
supreme disaster which we, the Last Men, await undismayed.
Contemplating this the last scene of the tragedy of Man, I began once
more to see your little war in its true proportions. Presently the
cramped and unwholesome feel of the young German's body began to fade
from me. The racket of battle, the tumbled and bleeding human forms,
began to seem as a dream when one is all but wakened, a dream of being
entangled in the insensate feuds of wild animals.</p>

<p>But now something happened which recalled my attention wholly to
your sphere. A savage tussle was taking place in the trench, and the
invaders were becoming masters of the situation. Hans, however, was
playing no part in the fight. He was standing aside watching it, as
though it were a dog-fight. In his mind was a vast confusion, caused by
a sudden enlightenment. Not only had the forest-image started a change
in him, but also he had been infected by my own reversion to the
Neptunian mentality, so that in those moments he too experienced a kind
of awakening. Suddenly he flung away his rifle and rushed with a huge
laugh into the melee. Seizing one of his countrymen by the collar and
the seat of the trousers, he tugged him away, crying, 'No more
brawling.' An officer, seeing that Hans was out of his mind and causing
trouble, shot him through the head.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had caught sight of the muzzle of the weapon out of
the comer of Hans's eye. Desperately, with a wild leap of the mind, I
disengaged myself from your world.</p>

<p>I awoke to find myself in bed in my garden. I could not remember
what had happened, but I had a violent pain in my head, and several of
my colleagues were standing round me. They had heard me scream, they
said, and had come running to my assistance. A few minutes later,
apparently, I lost consciousness again and fell into convulsions. I
remember nothing further tin six weeks later, when I awoke to find
myself in the tree-girt hospital where shattered explorers are nursed
back to health.</p>

<h3>iv. PAUL IN THE WAR</h3>

<p>While I was studying Hans, I was of course also, in the very same
span of Terrestrial duration, resident in Paul. Yet from the Neptunian
point of view, let me repeat, my operations upon Hans took place before
I had even discovered Paul. Consequently while I was in Hans I knew
nothing about Paul and my work upon him, but while I was in Paul I
remembered my experiences in Hans. This fact, as I shall tell in due
season, had in one respect a curious effect on Paul.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I must revert to Paul's career at the point where I. first
introduced him into this survey. It will be remembered that he was
suffering an agony of indecision about the war, that he hurried to a
recruiting office, and then fled away from it. We left him slinking
through the streets of London.</p>

<p>During the next few days Paul was frequently troubled by his waking
nightmare, the mare that was dead, with her strangled foal. Sometimes
it seemed to him that he himself was the foal, unable to free himself
from the restriction of an outgrown mentality. Sometimes the whole
human race was the foal. Sometimes on the other hand, the foal was just
his unborn martial self, throttled by his most unmartial past.</p>

<p>A few days later Paul heard of a curious semi-religious ambulance
organization, which, while professing pacifism, undertook voluntary
succour of the wounded at the front. It was controlled and largely
manned by a certain old-established and much-respected religious sect
which adhered strictly to the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill', and to
its own unique tradition of good works and quietism. Some members of
this sect preached a rigorous pacifism which very soon brought them
into conflict with authority; but others, who tempered pacifism with a
craving to take some part in the great public ordeal, created this
anomalous organization, whose spirit was an amazing blend of the
religious, the military, the pacific, the purely adventurous, and the
cynical. This 'Ambulance Unit' lasted throughout the war. It was formed
in the first instance as an outlet for the adventurousness of the
younger sectarians, who very naturally chafed at their exclusion from
the tremendous adventure and agony of their contemporaries. Throughout
its career it contained many such, normal young men eager for ardours
and endeavours, who, though they had no very serious pacifist
convictions, remained loyal to the tradition of their fathers, and
refused to bear arms. Others there were, both within and without the
sectarian fold, who, though they profoundly felt that to make war in
modern Europe under any circumstances whatever was treason against
something more sacred than nationalism, had yet not the heart to wash
their hands of the world's distresses.</p>

<p>Such were the pioneers of this strange organization; but as time
passed it gathered to itself a very diverse swarm of persons who were
driven from their civil occupations either by public opinion or their
own consciences, or finally by legal compulsion. A few, very few, were
narrow-hearted beings whose chief motive was simply to avoid what they
regarded as the spiritual defilement of a soldier's work. There was
also a sprinkling of artists and intellectuals whose main concern was
neither religion nor pacifism, but the adventures of the mind in novel
circumstances. Among those who were admitted into the Unit after
conscription had been introduced into England, some were serious
pacifists who had been loyal to their civilian duties as long as
possible; and a few, whose pacifism was only skin deep, chose the Unit
as the line of least resistance, simply because they had no stomach
either for the trenches or for prison.</p>

<p>To the military authorities this fantastic organization was a minute
and negligible excrescence on the military machine. The dignitaries of
the armies, if ever they came across it at all, regarded it at first as
something to be kept at arm's length until it had been brought under
proper military control. It was a God-sent butt for ridicule. On the
other hand it proved to have its uses; and often it earned a kind of
incredulous respect, even affection.</p>

<p>To Neptunian observers this uncomfortable medley of cranks and
commonplace individuals appeared, surprising as it may seem, as one of
the most interesting phenomena of your whole war. It was not the mere
pacifism of these beings that concerned us, for at home and later in
the prisons there were pacifists more logical and more heroic. What
interested us was the heart-searching bewilderment of minds which could
not find harmony either with the great mass of their warring fellows or
with the more relentless pacifists. We are interested too in the
reactions which these unclassified beings aroused in any ordinary
persons who happened to come across them. For they were neither fish,
flesh, fowl, nor good red herring. They claimed to be pacifists, but
obviously they were 'helping to win the war' by releasing others for
more arduous military duties. Surely, then, they were either fools or
shirkers. Surely, said the martial-minded, they ought all to be in the
trenches, or put in prison, or, better still, shot. But others, the
majority, gave them a contemptuous toleration.</p>

<p>To Paul it seemed that by joining this body he would be both taking
part in the war and registering his protest against it. In fact, as he
ruefully admitted, he would both have his cake and eat it. But what
else could he do? He was convinced at last that some mysterious thing
inside him would always prevent him from enlisting. But if he could not
fight, neither must he shirk. That he was moved at all by the will to
avoid the extremity of danger and agony he did not admit; for he
pictured himself as a stretcher-bearer rescuing the wounded under fire,
or as a motor-ambulance driver trundling his car where the fight was
hottest. So little did he yet know of 'modern' warfare.</p>

<p>Paul joined the Unit. With surprise and with shame-faced delight, he
learned that he must dress as a British officer, though with certain
distinguishing signs. On his left arm he must wear a red-cross
brassard, stamped with a kind of postage mark. His hat also bore a red
cross on a huge white square. Neptunian observers have been much
indebted to this uniform. Nothing could have better symbolized the
mental discord of Paul and his like. Nothing could have been more
nicely calculated to intensify that discord. One side of Paul clung to
the delusion that since he was to be dressed as an officer he must be
after all, in spirit, a member of that gallant fraternity. The other
side of him recognized that this could not be. He became in fact an
object of ridicule, sometimes of indignant scorn. Wherever he went, he
felt people wondering what on earth he was, and how he dared to
caricature his betters. Pacifists, on the other hand, raised their
eyebrows at his military colouring. One day while he was still
painfully conscious of his uniform, he met Katherine in the street. Her
husband was already in the trenches. She gazed at Paul for a moment in
amazement, suppressed a smile, was smitten by Paul's distress, and
became blunderingly tactful.</p>

<p>In France Paul was less conscious of his uniform. There were others
of his kind, and anyhow no one seemed to mind. Moreover he had work to
do. Having had some slight acquaintance with a motor-bicycle, he was
set to help in the repair of broken-down cars at the headquarters of
the Unit. A few weeks later he became an orderly on a motor ambulance.
He made innumerable journeys between the advanced stations and the
hospitals, working entirely for the French army. For the first time he
dealt with the wounded, with sitting-cases mostly cheerful at their
release, and stretcher-cases in all phases of distress and weakness.
Paul was at first deeply disturbed by compassion for these
much-bandaged blue-clad figures, many of whom moaned and lamented at
every jerk of the car. He was also bitterly ashamed before them,
because he was whole and full of life. Yet there was another part of
him which reacted in a less orthodox manner, and one which Paul himself
at first regarded as disreputable, even Satanic. It was almost like the
glee of the scientist watching a successful experiment, or of the
artist apprehending some high, intricate, inevitable form. Paul tried
hard not to feel in this way, or not to know that he felt so. But he
could not help it; and he was abashed at his own brutality. It was I
who caused this feeling in him, I, working upon his own rudimentary
impulses. He need not have been ashamed.</p>

<p>In these days the main concern of Paul's life, apart from the
overwhelming wounded themselves, was to get to the end of each journey
without a mishap, and to escape night work. There was also an
increasing sense that, after all, this was not good enough, not the
sort of thing he wanted for his conscience' sake. Occasionally he saw a
shell burst in the sand-dunes, or knock off the corner of a house. But
as for stretcher-bearing in the front line, there was not to be
anything of the sort. None of the armies were going to let
irresponsible volunteers do work which demanded strict military
discipline. One day, however, a gay young member of the party was
killed by a shell. Paul found himself torn between regret for the dead
boy and selfish satisfaction that, after all, this work was not
entirely sheltered.</p>

<p>The weeks and months passed, weeks made up of sultry day-driving and
pitch-black night-driving, of blood-stained blankets, packs, overcoats,
of occasional alarms, of letters written and received, of bathes in the
sea, not far from the steel entanglements which crossed the beach at
the end of the line. Then there were talks, talks with those who shared
the dilemma of Paul himself, and talks with the utterly different
beings who accepted the war with a shrug; laborious, joking
conversations with innumerable poilus, and still more laborious smutty
jests, sometimes with Algerians and Moroccans.</p>

<p>Some months after the beginning of his war career, Paul, who had
learnt to drive, was put in charge of a motor ambulance on a new
convoy, which was to go far away south to a part of the line beyond the
British front. His companions, some forty in all, constituted a fair
sample of the Unit. There were sons of rich and religious
manufacturers, and there were very small traders. There were printer's
apprentices, social workers, mechanics, students, clerks, teachers,
shop assistants, artists. There were devout sectarians, less devout
sectarians, and those who in revulsion from piety were at pains to
shock the devout with cynicism and ribaldry. There were careless young
Irishmen seeking adventure without 'military discipline. There were
kindly and earnest products of sectarian schools, and others who had
emerged from the same schools with a no less earnest, no less kindly,
frivolity. There were grizzled men who secretly cared nothing for
pacifism, but sought the quickest way of seeing the spectacle of war.
Here I may mention, too, the colourless but useful creature whom I have
chosen as my mouthpiece for communicating with you. He has served me
well in the past for the recounting of events in which he played no
part; but now that it is necessary to dwell for a moment on microscopic
occurrences of which he himself was a witness, I find him less
manageable. It is not always possible to prevent him from dwelling
unduly on the insignificant hardships and dangers in which he
participated. Such were the companions of Paul, the unique being whom I
had so carefully prepared for this experience.</p>

<p>With a sense that at last the test was coming, the Convoy lumbered
south. It left behind it all traces of the British Army, which it so
envied, respected, and obscurely feared. Presently it found itself
established in a town beside an old royal hunting forest. And there for
months it stayed, finding much hard work, but none of the ardours which
it sought. In time even the work decreased, to a steady routine. In the
earliest and more disorderly phase of the war the pioneers of this
'Ambulance Unit' had found ample opportunity to show that pacifism was
not incompatible with courage and endurance; and even now, other
Convoys of the Unit, it was said, were being of real use, and suffering
real danger and hardship. But this Convoy, it seemed, was fated to
idleness. There grew up a general restlessness, a tendency to quarrel
over nothing, a disposition to walk violently along the geometrically
ruled 'all&eacute;es' of that prim forest. Paul conceived a sentimental
passion for the forest. He withdrew as far as possible from his
companions, and tried to think of himself as some kind of a fawn
trapped into a human way of life. He found a deep satisfaction in
sleeping on a stretcher under the stars and branches. I contrived that
the forest should increasingly take possession of him, for I wished to
perform a minor experiment on him. Reconstructing in my own mind the
personality of Hans, who was at this time sniping Frenchmen further
down the line, I brought Paul also under the young forester's
influence. Paul began to feel toward this neat French forest almost as
Hans toward his grander German one. He spent all his spare time in it,
laying bare his spirit, so he thought, to the presence of the trees. He
began to write verses again, in his own groping technique. Here is one
of them.</p>

<p>After some months of futility, the Convoy became so restless that
its leaders persuaded the army authorities to give it a change.
Henceforth it was to be attached permanently to one of the divisions of
the French army. Once more the dark-green vehicles, plastered with red
and white emblems of mercy, lumbered through France in search of a
dreaded and a longed-for goal. The Convoy joined its Division in 'Lousy
Champagne', whose barren hills were now snowclad. This was during the
Great Cold. The bread crystallized, the ration wine froze. The
radiators of the cars, boiling at the top, froze at the bottom. At
night Paul, shivering in his sleeping-bag under a pile of blankets in
his canvas-sided car, thought of the trenches and was abashed.</p>

<p>The weeks rolled by. In quiet times Paul and his friends played
rugger with the Division, or walked over the down-like hills which were
already beginning to stipple themselves with flowers. It grew warm,
hot. They bathed in the stream, their white bodies rejoicing in freedom
from stiff military clothes. On one of these occasions Paul, dozing
naked in the sun before his dip, dreamed about my seaside holiday with
the woman, Panther. This dream had an interesting effect on him. He
woke with a sense of the shadowy unreality of all Terrestrial events
beyond the immediate reach of his senses; but the bright meadow, the
willow-shaded stream, the delicious aliveness of his own sun-kindled
body, had gained from his dream a more intense reality, an added
spiritual significance. He thought of Katherine, whose breasts at least
he had known. His flesh stirred. In sudden exasperation at his own
futility and the world's perversity, he dived.</p>

<p>Sometimes the young Englishmen went into the little town behind the
lines to take wine or coffee, omelettes or gauffres; or to talk to the
daughter of the patron. By the cynics it was maliciously suggested that
this grey-eyed Athene had relations other than conventional with
certain members of the Convoy. But to the devout this horror was
incredible. Paul at least confessed to himself that he would have
gladly lain with her, for he was hungry for woman, and she found her
way into his dreams. But, however she treated others, to Paul she
remained sweetly unapproachable. His failure with her intensified his
discontent with the whole life of the Convoy. He wanted to prove
himself a man, to have a share in the world's burden, even if the world
was a fool to bear it. To the Neptunian it was very interesting to
observe in the Convoy this growing obsession with the need to vindicate
pacifism by physical courage. At this time some who had hot blood and
little care for pacifism went home to join the fighting forces. Others
went home not to enlist but to go to prison for their pacifism, New
hands came from headquarters to replenish the Convoy. Now that
conscription was in force there was no lack of personnel.</p>

<p>Paul himself, whenever he went home on leave, had thoughts of
joining the army. But he knew that these thoughts sprang only from his
loneliness in a land intent on war, not from conviction of duty. On
leave he was always cowed. He felt himself an outcast. He felt the
women flaunting their soldiers at him. And the soldiers, though they
let him alone, put him to shame. People at home judged him according to
their own natures, as an impossible idealist, a fool, or a common
shirker. All arguments closed with the same formula, 'But we must
fight, to keep the Germans out.' When Paul dared to say 'Would it
really matter so very much if they came?' he was silenced by stories of
atrocities which in his heart he could not believe.</p>

<p>Once when he was on leave he met the Archangel, who was now an army
chaplain, and had been wounded. They dined together at a railway
restaurant among officers and women. Paul, homeward bound, was shabby.
His tunic had a torn pocket, mended clumsily by his own hands. Those
hands, which he had scrubbed till they seemed unusually clean, now
turned out after all to be ingrained with engine oil; and his nails
were ragged. He felt as though, for his ungentlemanly conduct in
refusing to fight, he had been degraded from his own social class. This
sense of loss of caste was intensified by the fact that he was wearing
a closed collar; for since conscription had come in, the Unit had been
made to give up the secretly cherished open collar of the officer's
tunic. The Archangel was friendly, sympathetic even. Yet in his very
sympathy, so at least it seemed to Paul, condemnation was implied. Over
coffee Paul suddenly asked, not without malice, 'What would Jesus have
done?' While the priest was looking at the tablecloth for an answer,
Paul, to his own horror, said in a clear loud voice, 'Jesus would have
shot the politicians and the war lords and started a European
revolution.' There was a silence in the restaurant. The pained
Archangel murmured, 'Strange talk from a pacifist, isn't it?' Then at
last quite suddenly Paul's pacifism defined itself in his mind, assumed
a precise and limiting outline. To the Archangel he said, not too loud,
but with conviction, 'To fight for one's nation against other nations
in a world insane with nationalism, is an offence against the spirit,
like fighting for a religious sect in a world insane with sectarianism.
But to fight for revolution and a new world-order might become
necessary.' Paul was surprised at himself for making this statement.
How it would grieve his pacifist friends! Was it true, he wondered. One
conviction at least became clear in his mind. Whatever was needed to
bring about a right world-order was itself right. But national wars
could never do this, and were utterly wrong. Perhaps the only thing
that could bring about a right world-order was not violence but a very
great change in the hearts of ordinary people. But could that change
ever occur? Somehow, it must.</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts that occupied Paul during the pause that
followed the Archangel's protest.</p>

<p>It was always with mingled despair and relief that Paul went back
from leave. On leave he was haunted by the foal-image. When he was in
the war area he felt there was some life in the creature yet; it was
struggling though doomed. But at home it seemed already dead, mere
horsemeat, never to be the friend of Man.</p>

<p>Life on the familiar sector was in the main too humdrum to be very
repugnant. Sometimes for a day or two there would be activity. The
roads would be seriously shelled, and the loaded cars would have to run
the gauntlet. It was unpleasant, even nerve-racking, but it was soon
over. And always one knew that this was but child's play, not the real
thing. During one of these minor disturbances, while Paul was returning
to the front with an empty car, and shells were dropping close around
him, he saw a figure lying at the road-side, its head badly smashed.
Obviously the man was dead, so Paul drove on. But the next car stopped
to pick him up, and he was still alive. For months Paul was haunted by
that incident, going over it again and again in an agony of shame. It
became to him the nadir of his existence. It increased his ludicrous
obsession over physical courage.</p>

<p>The Division liked its 'Section Sanitaire Anglaise'. It had come to
regard these strayed English no longer with suspicion, but with
affection tempered by incredulity. It excused their pacifism as one
might excuse a Mohammedan for not eating pork. No doubt in both cases
there was some equally remote and fantastic historical explanation. To
Frenchmen it was apparently inconceivable that anyone should take
pacifism seriously unless it happened to be an element of his religious
orthodoxy. For Frenchmen themselves, so the Convoy had long ago
discovered, the only serious religion was France, the only orthodoxy
uncompromising loyalty to France. If anyone suggested that some policy
beneficial to France might not be acceptable to other peoples, these
amiable, lucid, but strangely unimaginative Latin children would no
doubt charmingly express regret, but would also point out that if the
policy was necessary for France, they must support it. The
extermination of wild animals by the march of civilization is to be
regretted, but no sane man would suggest that civilization should be
restricted in order to save them. As to pacifism, anyhow, it was no
more practicable in Europe than in the jungle. Thus talked the
considerate and very gallant officers of the Division, so
respect-worthy in sky-blue and gold. Thus talked the amiable poilus, so
devoted to their distant families and the land they should be tilling.
And, indeed, all that the troops said about pacifism was true. They and
their like made it impossible. Once more, the foal.</p>

<p>One Frenchman indeed did show some understanding of these English
cranks. He was one of the two priests attached to the Division. His
colleague, a red-bearded lover of wine, wore military uniform, and was
a hearty friend of the troops; but M. l'Abb&eacute; himself wore his
black cassock, tramped the whole sector with his finger in a little
volume of St. Thomas, and was revered. He would talk long with the
English over meals in dug-outs, for he was interested in their sect and
their ideas. Of their pacifism he would repeat, 'Ah, mes chers
messieurs, si tout le monde pouvait sentir comme vous!' One day he was
caught by a shell, which broke his leg. Members of the Convoy visited
him in hospital, where his clean body was making a quick recovery.
Then, through some muddle over a change of staff, he was neglected, and
died. In the commemorative address given by his colleague, the abbot's
death was laid to the account of the God-hating enemy. To Paul it
seemed to be due to more complex causes.</p>

<p>In most Frenchmen's eyes the pacifism of these English merely gave
an added and farcical piquancy to a body that had already earned
respect for its efficiency. For these pacifists were extremely
Conscientious in their work, as is indeed to be expected where
consciences suffer from chronic irritation. The Division also admired,
and politely ridiculed, the extravagant cleanliness of the Convoy. In
quiet times the paintwork of its cars was sleek with paraffin. Lamps,
fittings, even crank-cases were kept bright with metal polish. Some of
the members grumbled, but all acquiesced. Thus did the Convoy pay
tribute to the great British Army, which in spite of antimilitarism it
so faithfully admired.</p>

<p>Cleanliness did not interfere with efficiency. What the Convoy
undertook to do, it invariably did. On the other hand, from the
Division's point of view, the conscientiousness of these English
sometimes went too far, as when they flatly refused to transport rifles
and ammunition to the front in their red-cross cars. The General was
indignant, and threatened to get rid of this pack of lunatics. But an
artist member of the Convoy was at that time painting his portrait, so
the matter was dropped.</p>

<p>By now this little speck of Englishmen in an ocean of Latins had
acquired a strong group-spirit. Though internally it was generally at
loggerheads with itself, all its jarring elements were in accord in
maintaining the prestige of the Convoy. H anyone indulged in some minor
lapse, public opinion was emphatically against him. On the other hand,
if the officers of the Convoy sought to introduce customs which to the
rank and file seemed unnecessary or obnoxious, the cry of 'militarism'
was raised; and the long-suffering officers, though they had behind
them the whole power of the British and French armies, patiently argued
the matter out with the rebels. Punishment was unknown in the
Convoy.</p>

<p>This little group of two score persons was ever in a state of
internal strain, either between the officers and the rest, or between,
one clique and another. Thus the earnestly devout would outrage the
earnestly frivolous by organizing religious meetings. The frivolous
would conscientiously get mildly drunk on ration wine. The earnestly
philistine talked sex and sport, motors and war, to maintain their
integrity against the earnestly intellectual, who talked art, politics,
pacifism, and what they thought was philosophy. Yet all alike, or
nearly all, received something from the strange corporate being of the
Convoy. All were intensely conscious of their nationality, and of the
need to impress these foreigners with British excellence. Yet all were
outcasts from their nation, and deeply ashamed; even though also they
consciously despised nationalism, and vehemently prophesied
cosmopolitanism.</p>

<p>At last the test came. The Division moved to a part of the line
beside the Montagne de Rheims. On the way the Convoy was caught up in a
continuous stream of traffic making for the front, a stream of troops,
guns, limbers, troops, motor-lorries, tanks, troops, ambulance
sections. There was indescribable congestion, long waits, snail
progress. Ahead a ceaseless roar of guns. On this journey I found in
Paul a ludicrous blend of thankfulness and fright. His body was
continuously in a state of suppressed tremor. Now and then he fetched a
huge sigh, which he carefully turned into a yawn, lest his companion
should guess that he was not looking forward to this offensive with the
enthusiasm affected by all true members of the Convoy. Paul kept saying
to himself, 'This is the real thing, this is reality.' But sometimes
what he said was, 'Reality? It's just a bloody farce.'</p>

<p>The Convoy reached its destination and took over its duties. For a
few days there was normal work, save that the roads were fairly
steadily shelled. One shell Paul had reason to remember. He was in the
courtyard that served the Convoy as a parking-ground. A score of blue
figures tramped past the gateway singing, exchanging pleasantries with
the English. They marched on, and disappeared behind the wall. Then
there was a shattering explosion, followed by dead silence. The English
rushed out into the road. There lay the twenty blue figures, one of
them slowly moving the stump of an arm. Blood trickled down the camber
of the road, licking up the dust. It flowed along the gutters. Paul and
his mates got stretchers and carried away those who were not dead,
shouting instructions to one another, for the shelling continued.
During this operation Paul had one of those strange fits of heightened
percipience which my influence sometimes brought upon him. Everything
seemed to be stamped upon his senses with a novel and exquisite
sharpness, the limpness of the unconscious bodies that he lifted, a
blood-stained letter protruding from a torn pocket, a steel helmet
lying in the road, with a fragment of someone's scalp in it, bloody and
lousy. Paul's legs were trembling with fright and nausea, while the
compassionate part of him insisted that these unhappy fellow mortals
must be succoured. For some might live. That letter might yet after all
be answered. It seemed to Paul now imperative that this poilu and his
maraine should communicate once more. Yet at the same time that deep
mysterious alien part of him, which he was gradually coming to accept
and even value, laughed delicately, laughed as one may laugh with
tenderness at the delicious gaucherie of a child.</p>

<p>It seemed to say to the other Paul, and to the stricken men also,
'You dear, stupid children, to hurt yourselves like this, and to be so
upset about it! Babes will be babes; and monkeys, monkeys.'</p>

<p>When Paul was off duty he went up into the forest-clad mountains and
looked down at the line of dense smoke which marked the front, overhung
at regular intervals by the two rows of captive balloons, stretching
indefinitely into the south-east. An enemy 'plane, harassed at first by
white points of shrapnel, attacked a French balloon, which burst into
flame. A scarcely visible parachute sank earthward from it. Paul went
further into the forest. Here there was a kind of peace in spite of the
roaring guns. Under my influence the spirit of Hans came on him again,
so that he had a perplexing sense that, in the presence of his brothers
the trees, he was brought mysteriously into touch also with his
brothers the enemy.</p>

<p>The offensive began. Henceforth there was continuous work, with rare
meals and no sleep. French and German wounded came flooding in.
Hundreds who could find no place in the cars had to stagger all the way
down to the chateau where the gaily-clad doctors grew more and more
flustered. Slowly, uncertainly, these walking wounded swarmed along the
road, their blue and their grey clothes sometimes indistinguishable for
dust and blood. The roads now began to be impossible with shell-holes,
and choked with wreckage. At one time Paul, hurrying along under
shell-fire with a full load of sorrowing creatures shaken together in
his reeling car, found himself behind a galloping artillery wagon. At
the cross-roads, where some one, for reasons unknown, had propped a
dead sergeant against the sign-post, a shell fell on the front of the
wagon. The two men and one of the rear horses were killed. Its fellow
floundered with broken legs, then died. The leaders stampeded. The road
was now completely blocked. French and English dragged the dead horses
and the limber to the ditch, tugging frantically at harness and
splintered wood, while the wounded in the waiting cars, supposing
themselves deserted under fire, cried out for help.</p>

<p>At night things were worse. Cars slipped into ditches, plunged into
shell-holes. Paul, with a full load of stretcher-cases, almost drove
off a broken bridge into the river. All the cars were damaged by
shell-fire. Some were put out of action. One, going up empty to the
front, suddenly found itself in a covey of bursting shells. The driver
and orderly tumbled hurriedly into a ditch, and a shell burst on the
driving-seat. The petrol went up in a huge column of flame' and soon
nothing remained of the car, but scrap iron and pools of aluminium on
the road. Later, a line of tanks, going up, met a line of ambulances,
coming down, where there was no room to pass. Confusion and
altercations. A tank was hit; once more a column of flame, dwarfing the
other, afforded a beacon for enemy guns.</p>

<p>Two or three days and nights of this kind of thing severely strained
the Convoy. One or two members had already been wounded, and others had
been badly shaken. Nerves developed here and there. Some one began to
behave oddly, wandering about delivering meaningless messages. He was
taken away. Paul himself was in a queer state; for his head was
splitting, his mouth foul, his limbs curiously stiff and heavy. His
stomach seemed to have collapsed. Worse, his driving was becoming
erratic, and he sometimes said things he did not intend to say. He was
continuously scared, and also scared of being found out by his calmer
colleagues. His bogy, the foal, began to haunt him again. Somehow it
was all mixed up with another vision, a bloodstained letter protruding
from a torn pocket; and with yet another, a cow so flattened in the mud
by the wheels of lorries and the feet of troops that nothing of it
remained three-dimensional except its head in the gutter, and one
broken horn. The thought that, after all, this ambulance life was mere
child's play compared with what was afoot elsewhere, hurt him so badly
that inwardly he whined. For if things grew much worse than this he
would certainly crack; and yet 'this' was nothing. Superficially he had
maintained thus far something like the appearance of calm. He even
contrived an occasional stammering joke. But inwardly he was by now
going faint with terror. And this welling terror was beginning to spoil
his affected calm. People were beginning to look at him anxiously. Paul
found himself reviewing his case in this manner once while he was
crouching in a ditch waiting for a lull in the shelling, and for a load
of wounded. Yes, inwardly he was by now not far from cracking.</p>

<p>Yet more inwardly still, so he remarked to himself, he was quite
calm. That was the odd part of it all. His silly body, or animal
nature, as he put it, might very well crack, or run away howling, and
yet he, Paul, would have no part in it. He, Paul, the rider of this
quivering animal, was unperturbed, interested, amused. The beast might
run away with him or throw him. It was proving a rather worthless sort
of beast, and he had his work cut out to force it to the jumps. He
would damned well master it if he could; but if he could not, well, it
was all in the game, the extremely interesting game of being a human
thing, half god, half beast. He knew quite well it didn't seriously
matter if he was killed, or even if he was horribly wounded. It didn't
really matter even if he cracked, though he must hang on if he could.
He had a strange conviction, there in the ditch, that whichever did
happen would be just the right thing; that even if he cracked, it would
somehow be part of the' music of the spheres'. Even the foal unborn was
part of the music. Even this war, this bloody awful farce, was part of
the music. If you couldn't be anything but a vibrating, a tortured
string in the orchestra, you didn't like it. But if you had ears to
listen, it was--great. These wounded--if only they could somehow hear,
even through their own pain, the music of the spheres! If he himself
were to be caught by the next shell, would he still keep hold of the
music? Not he! He would be a mere tortured animal. Well, what matter?
The music would still be there, even if he could not hear it, even if
no man heard it. That was nonsense. Yet profoundly he knew that it was
true.</p>

<p>Presently, for no apparent reason, the sector quietened down. The
offensive, it seemed, had been a failure. The advance, which was to
have swept the Germans out of France, never began. The Division,
moreover, was in a state of mutiny, sensing mismanagement, declaring
that thousands of lives had been lightly thrown away. It was withdrawn.
The Convoy travelled with it into a flowery region far behind the
lines. Tin hats were discarded.</p>

<p>Then occurred a little incident very significant to the Neptunian
observer. The Convoy, having borne itself well, was cited in the orders
of the Corps d' Arm&eacute;e. It was therefore entitled to have the
Croix de Guerre painted on its cars. The artists undertook this task.
The bronze cross, with its red and green ribbon, was earned also by
certain individual members of the Convoy. Should they accept it, should
they wear the ribbon? To refuse would be insulting to the French army.
But that pacifists should display military decorations was too
ridiculous. There was some debate, but the thing was done. Thus did
these pacifists, hypnotized for so long by the prestige and glamour of
the military, bring themselves to devour the crumbs of glory that fell
from the master's table.</p>

<p>There is no need to dwell upon the subsequent adventures of this
war-scarred and war-decorated group of pacifists. The being whose brain
I use in communicating with you would gladly tell of them in detail,
for in his memory they have a false glamour and significance. But
already I have allowed him too much rein. The life of his Convoy is
indeed significant to the student of your species; but the events on
which he seeks to dwell are minute with an even more microscopic
minuteness than the Great War, which to the Neptunian observer,
searching for your War through past ages, is so easily to be
overlooked. The significance of the war itself, lies partly in its
fatal results, partly in that it reveals so clearly the limits of a
half-developed mind. The importance of the ulto-microscopic events that
I have allowed my instrument to enlarge upon in this section, is that
they show how, even in the less conventional minds of your race, the
archaic impulses caused devastating perplexity.</p>

<p>When the Convoy had rested, it wandered from sector to sector, till
at last it found itself once more near the vine-clad and forest-crowned
Mountain of Rheims, and once more destined for a great offensive. Once
more the din of the troops, guns, lorries. Once more tom-up roads,
smashed cars, night-driving in blurred and suffocating gas-masks. Once
more the in-flooding wounded, and now and again a member of the little
group itself wounded or killed. This time the offensive went on and on.
Car after car was put out of action. Half the personnel were laid low,
some by gas, some seemingly by bad water.</p>

<p>One day, as Paul was turning his car round before loading, a shell
caught his companion, who was directing him from the road. This was a
lad with whom Paul had often worked, and often amicably wrangled about
art and life, a boy full of promise, and of the will to make his mark.
Now, he lay crumpled on the road. Paul and others rushed to him. The
lower part of his body had been terribly smashed, but he was still
conscious. His eyes turned to Paul, and his lips moved. Paul bent to
listen, and seemed to hear a faint gasping reiteration of one phrase,
'Won't die yet.' With difficulty they got the boy on to a stretcher,
his face twisted with added pain.. As they carried him away, he stirred
feebly, then suddenly went limp, his head rolling loosely with the
motion of the bearers. An arm slipped off the stretcher, and dangled.
They put him down again and bent over him. A French broncardier, who
was helping, stood up with a shrug and a sigh. 'C'est
d&eacute;j&agrave; fini,' he said. Looking down at the smooth face, he
added, 'Qui, mon pauvre, c'est fini. Mort pour la patrie! Ah, les sales
Boches!'</p>

<p>Paul gazed at the tanned bloodless features, the curiously changed
eyes, the sagging mouth. This was the moment for me to undertake an
operation which I had long contemplated. Bringing all my strength to
bear on Paul I lashed him into a degree of self-consciousness and
other-consciousness which I had not hitherto produced in him. With this
heightened sensitivity, he was overwhelmed by vivid apprehension of the
life that had been cut short, the intricacy and delicate organization
of the spirit which he had known so well, and had now seen
extinguished, with all its young ambitions, fears, admirations, loves,
all its little whims and lusts and laughters. The experience came on
him in a flash, so that he let slip a quick sharp scream of surprise
and compassion. He stared fascinated at a smear of blood on the cheek,
seeing as it were right through the present death-mask into the boy's
whole living past, retaining it in one imaginative grasp, as music may
be retained in the mind's ear after it has been interrupted; may still
be heard, gathering strength, proliferating, and suddenly broken across
with the breaking of the instrument. Paul heard, indeed, what the boy
himself did not hear, the terrible snap and silence of the end. This
was but the first stage of my operation on Paul. I also contrived that,
with his hypersensitive vision, he should seem to see, beyond this one
dead boy, the countless hosts of the prematurely dead, not the dead of
your war only, but of all the ages, the whole massed horror of young
and vital spirits snuffed out before their time. Paul's mind reeled and
collapsed; but not before he had glimpsed in all this horror a
brilliant, and insupportable, an inhuman, beauty. The operation had
been completed, and in due season I should observe the results. He
fell, and was carried away in one of the ambulances.</p>

<p>In a few days, however, he recovered, and was able to take part in a
new phase of the war, the advance of the Allies. It was a swarming
advance along unspeakable roads, over pontoon bridges, through burning
villages.</p>

<p>During this final advance Paul one day perceived in a field by the
road the mare and unborn foal whose image had so long haunted him. The
unexpected but all too familiar sight shocked him deeply. Volume by
volume it corresponded with his image, but there was an added stench.
How came it, he wondered, that for years he had 'remembered' this thing
before ever he had seen It?</p>

<p>One symbolical aspect of his foal was still hidden from him. When at
last the armistice came, so longed for, so incredible, Paul did not yet
know that the peace ensuing on the world's four years' travail was to
be the peace, not of accomplished birth but of strangulation.</p>

<p>The following curious poem, which Paul devised shortly before the
end of the war, expresses his sense of the futility and pettiness of
all human activity.</p>

<pre>

<h2>7 AFTER THE WAR</h2>

<blockquote>i. THE NEW HOPE ii. PAUL GATHERS UP THE THREADS iii. PAUL
COMES TO TERMS WITH WOMAN iv. LONDON AND THE SPIRIT</blockquote>

<h3>i. THE NEW HOPE</h3>

<p>YOUR little Great War reached its ignominious end. During the four
years of misery and waste, the short-lived combatants felt that the war
area, fringed with the remote and insubstantial lands of peace, was the
whole of space, and that time itself was but the endless Duration of
the War. But to Neptunian observers, ranging over the considerable span
occupied by human history, the events of those four years appeared but
as an instantaneous flicker of pain in the still embryonic life of Man.
The full-grown Spirit of Man, the Race Mind of the Eighteenth Human
Species may be said to use the great company of individual Neptunian
observers as a kind of psychical and supra-temporal microscope for the
study of its own prenatal career. Peering down that strange instrument,
it searches upon the slide for the little point of life which is to
become in due season Man himself. The thing is discovered. It is seen
to reach that stage of its history when for the first time it begins to
master its little Terrestrial environment. Then is to be detected by
the quick eye of mature Man the faint and instantaneous flicker, your
Great War. Henceforth the minute creature slowly retracts its
adventuring pseudopodia, enters into itself, shrinks, and lapses into a
state of suspended animation, until at last, after some ten million
years, it is ripe for its second phase of adventure, wholly forgetful
of its first. It becomes, in fact, the Second Human Species.</p>

<p>When your Great War ended, it seemed to the soldiers of all the
nations that a new and happier age had dawned. The veterans prepared to
take up once more the threads that war had cut; the young prepared for
the beginning of real life. All alike looked forward to security, to
freedom from military discipline, to the amusements of civilized
society, to woman. Those who had been long under restraint found it
almost incredible that they would soon be able to go wherever they
pleased without seeking permission, that they would be able to lie in
bed in the morning, that they might wear civilian clothes, that they
would never again be under the eye of a sergeant, or a captain, or some
more exalted officer, and never again take part in an offensive.</p>

<p>For the majority these anticipations were enough. If they could but
secure a livelihood, capture some charming and adoring woman, keep a
family in comfort, enjoy life, or return to some engrossing work, they
would be happy. And a grateful country would surely see to it that they
were at least thus rewarded for their years of heroism.</p>

<p>But there were many who demanded of the peace something more than
personal contentment. They demanded, and indeed confidently looked for,
the beginnings of a better world. The universe, which during the war
years, had been progressively revealed as more and more diabolical, was
now transfused with a new hope, a new or a refurbished divinity. The
armies of the Allies had been fighting for justice and for democracy;
or so at least they had been told. They had won. Justice and democracy
would henceforth flourish everywhere. On the other hand the armies of
the Central Powers had believed that they had been fighting for the
Fatherland or for Culture. They had been beaten; but after a gallant
fight, and because their starved and exhausted peoples could no longer
support them. To those hard-pressed peoples the end of war came not
indeed as a bright dawn, as to the Allies, but none the less as the end
of unspeakable things, and with the promise of a new day. Henceforth
there would at least be food. The pinched and ailing children of
Central Europe, whom the Allies had so successfully, so heroically
stricken by their blockade, might now perhaps be nursed into precarious
health. The beaten nations, trusting to the high-sounding protestations
of the victors, not only surrendered, but appealed for help in the
desperate task of re-establishing society. President Wilson prophesied
a new world, a Brotherhood of Nations, and pronounced his Fourteen
Points. Henceforth there would be no more wars, because this last and
most bitter war had expunged militarism from the hearts of all the
peoples; and had made all men feel, as never before, the difference
between the things that were essential and the things that were trivial
in the life of mankind What mattered (men now vehemently asserted) was
the fellowship of man, Christian charity, the co-operation of all men
in the making of a happier world. The war had occurred because the
fundamental kindliness of the peoples towards one another had been
poisoned by the diplomats. Henceforth the peoples would come into
direct contact with one another. The old diplomacy must go.</p>

<p>These sentiments were tactfully applauded by the diplomats of all
nations, and were embalmed, suitably trimmed and tempered, in a new
charter of human brotherhood, the Peace Treaty of Versailles.</p>

<p>To Neptunian observers, estimating the deepest and most obscure
mental reactions of thousands of demobilized soldiers and of the
civilian populations that welcomed them, it was clear that the First
Human Species had not yet begun to realize the extent of the disaster
which it had brought upon itself. All the belligerent peoples were, of
course, war-weary. It was natural that after the four years of strain
they should experience a serious lassitude, that after responding so
magnificently (as was said) to the call for sacrifice, they should be
more than usually prone to take the easy course. But our observers,
comparing minutely the minds of 1914 with the same minds of 1918, noted
a widespread, subtle, and in the main unconscious change. Not a few
minds, indeed, had been completely shattered by the experience of those
four years, succumbing either to the conflict between personal fear and
tribal loyalty or to that rarer conflict between tribal loyalty and the
groping loyalty to Man. But also, even in the great mass of men, who
had escaped this obvious ruin, there had occurred a general coarsening
and softening of the mental fibre, such that they were henceforth poor
stuff for the making of a new world.</p>

<p>The slight but gravely significant lassitude which we now observed
in all the Western peoples had its roots not merely in fatigue, but in
self-distrust and disillusionment. At first obscured by the new hope
which peace had gendered, this profound moral disheartenment was
destined to increase, not dwindle, as the years advanced. In those
early months of peace scarcely any man was aware of it, but to our
observers it was evident as a faint odour of corruption in almost every
mind. It was the universal though unacknowledged sense of war-guilt,
the sense that the high moral and patriotic fervours of 1914 had
somehow obscured a deeper and more serious issue. Western Man had
blundered into a grave act of treason against the spirit that had but
recently and precariously been conceived in him. Few could see that it
was so; and yet in almost every mind we found an all-pervading shame,
unwitting but most hurtful. Knowing not that they did so, all men
blamed themselves and their fellow-men for a treason which they did not
know they had committed, against a spirit that was almost completely
beyond their ken. Neptunian observers did not blame them. For these
unhappy primitives had but acted according to their lights. They could
not know that another and a purer light had been eclipsed in them
before they could recognize it.</p>

<p>In many thousands of minds we have watched this subtle guilt at
work. Sometimes it expressed itself as a touchy conscientiousness in
familiar moral issues, combined with a laxity in matters less
stereotyped. Sometimes it became a tendency to blame others unduly, or
to mortify the self. More often it gave rise to a lazy cynicism, a
comfortable contempt of human nature, and disgust with all existence.
Its issue was a widespread, slight loosening of responsibility, both
toward society and toward particular individuals. Western men were to
be henceforth on the whole less trustworthy, less firm with themselves,
less workmanlike, less rigorous in abstract thought, less fastidious in
all spheres, more avid of pleasure, more prone to heartlessness, to
brutality, to murder. And, when, later, it began to be realized that
this deterioration had taken place, the realization itself, by
suggestion, increased the deterioration.</p>

<p>But the effects of the war were by no means wholly bad. In the great
majority of minds observed by Neptunians after the war, there was
detected a very interesting conflict between the forces of decay and
the forces of rebirth. The hope of a new world was not entirely
ungrounded. The war had stripped men of many hampering illusions; and,
for those that had eyes to see, it had underlined in blood the things
that really mattered. For the most clear-sighted it was henceforth
evident that only two things mattered, the daily happiness of
individual human beings and the advancement of the human spirit in its
gallant cosmical adventure. To the great majority of those who took
serious interest in public affairs the happiness of men and women
throughout the world became henceforth the one goal of social action.
Only a few admitted that the supreme care of all the peoples should be
the adventure of the Terrestrial spirit. Because so few recognized this
cosmical aspect of human endeavour, even the obvious goal of
world-happiness became unrealizable. For if happiness alone is the
goal, one man's happiness is as good as another's, and no one will feel
obligation to make the supreme sacrifice. But if the true goal is of
another order, those who recognize it may gladly die for it.</p>

<p>In the Western World, during the decades that followed the war we
encountered far and wide among the hearts of men the beginnings of a
true rebirth, an emphatic rejection of the outworn ideals of conduct
and of world policy, and a desperate quest for something better,
something to fire men's imaginations and command their allegiance even
to the death; something above suspicion, above ridicule, above
criticism. Far and wide, among many peoples, the new ideal began to
stir for birth, but men's spirits had been subtly poisoned by the war.
What should have become a world-wide religious experience beside which
all earlier revivals would have seemed mere tentative and ineffectual
gropings, became only a revolutionary social policy, became in fact the
wholly admirable but unfinished ideal of a happy world. The muscles
which should have thrust the new creature into the light were flaccid.
The birth was checked. The young thing, half-born, struggled for a
while, then died, assuming the fixed grin of Paul's nightmare foal.</p>

<p>In Russia alone, and only for a few decades, did there seem to be
the possibility of complete rebirth. In that great people of mixed
Western and Eastern temperament the poison of war had not worked so
disastrously. The great mass of Russians had not regarded the war as
their war, but as the war of their archaic government. And as the
suffering bred of war increased beyond the limit of endurance, they
rose and overthrew their government. The revolutionists who heroically
accomplished this change were troubled by no war-shame, for the blood
which they shed was truly split in the birth throes of a new world.
They were indeed fighting for the spirit, though they would have
laughed indignantly had they been told so. For to them 'spirit' was but
an invention of the oppressors, and 'matter' alone was real. They
fought, so they believed, for-the free physiological functioning of
human animals. They fought, that is, for the fulfilling of whatever
capacities those animals might discover in themselves. And in fighting
thus they fought unwittingly for the human spirit in its cosmical
adventure. When their fight was won, and they had come into power, they
began to discipline their people to lead a world-wide crusade. Each
man, they said, must regard himself as but an instrument of something
greater than himself, must live for that something, and if necessary
die for it. This devotion that they preached and practised was indeed
the very breath of the spirit within them. Little by little a new hope,
a new pride, a new energy, spread among the Russian people. Little by
little they fashioned for themselves a new community, such as had never
before occurred on the planet. And because they allowed no one to hold
power through riches, they became the horror of the Western World.</p>

<p>To the thousands of our observers stationed in Russian minds it was
evident even at the outset that this promise of new birth would never
be fulfilled. The ardour of revolution and the devotion of
community-building could not suffice alone for ever. There must come a
time when the revolution was won, the main structure of the new
community completed, when the goal of a happy world, though not in fact
attained, would no longer fire men, no longer suffice as the
'something' for which they would gladly live or die; when the spirit so
obscurely conceived in men would need more nourishment than social
loyalty. Then the only hope of the world would be that Russian men and
women should look more closely into their hearts, and discover there
the cosmical and spiritual significance of human life, which their
creed denied. But this could not be. In few of them did we find a
capacity for insight strong enough to apprehend what man is, and what
the world, and the exquisite relation of them. And being without that
vision, they would have nothing to strengthen them against the
infection of the decaying Western civilization. Feared and hated by
their neighbours, they themselves would succumb to nationalistic fear
and hate. Craving material power for their defence, they would betray
themselves for power, security, prosperity.</p>

<p>In short, the new hope which the European War had occasioned,
especially in Russia, was destined, sooner or later, to be destroyed by
the virus which war itself had generated in the guilty Western peoples.
While that new hope, still quick and bright, was travelling hither and
thither over Asia like a smouldering fire, this dank effluence also was
spreading, damping the fibre of men's hearts with disillusionment about
human nature and the universe. And so, that which should have become a
world-wide spiritual conflagration was doomed never to achieve more
than revolutionary propaganda, and smoke.</p>

<h3>ii. PAUL GATHERS UP THE THREADS</h3>

<p>It is my task to show your world in its 'post-war' phase as it
seemed to one of your own kind who had been infected with something of
the Neptunian mood. First, however, I must recall how Paul faced his
own private 'post-war' problems, and emerged at last as a perfected
instrument for my purpose.</p>

<p>Crossing the Channel for the last time in uniform, Paul looked
behind and forward with mixed feelings. Behind lay the dead, with their
thousands upon thousands of wooden crosses; and also (for Paul's
imagination) the wounded, grey, blue and khaki, bloody, with splintered
bones. Behind, but indelible, lay all that horror, that waste, that
idiocy; yet also behind lay, as he was forced to admit to himself, an
exquisite, an inhuman, an indefensible, an intolerable beauty. Forward
lay life, and a new hope. Yet looking toward the future he felt
misgivings both for himself and for the world. For himself he feared,
because he had no part in the common emotion of his fellow-countrymen,
in the thankfulness that the war had been nobly won. For the world he
feared, because of a growing sense that man's circumstances were
rapidly passing beyond man's control. They demanded more intelligence
and more integrity than he possessed.</p>

<p>Thus Paul on his homeward journey could not conjure in himself the
pure thankfulness of his fellows. Yet, looking behind and forward, with
the wind chanting in his ears and the salt spray on his lips, he
savoured zestfully the bitter and taunting taste of existence.
Comparing his present self with the self of his first war-time
crossing, he smiled at the poor half-conscious thing that he had been,
and said, at least, I have come awake.' Then he thought again of those
thousands under the crosses, who would not wake ever. He remembered the
boy whom he had known so well, and had watched dying; who should have
wakened so splendidly. And then once more he savoured that mysterious,
indefensible beauty which he had seen emerge in all this horror.</p>

<p>I chose this moment of comparatively deep self-consciousness and
world-consciousness to force upon Paul with a new clarity the problem
with which I intended henceforth to haunt him. This task was made
easier by the circumstances of the voyage. The sea was boisterous. Paul
greatly enjoyed a boisterous sea and the plunging of a ship, but his
pleasure was complicated by a feeling of sea-sickness. He fought
against his nausea and against its depressing influence. He wanted to
go on enjoying the wind and the spray and the motion and the
white-veined sea, but he could not. Presently, however, he very
heartily vomited; and then once more he could enjoy things, and even
think about the world. His thinking was coloured both by his nausea and
by his zest in the salt air. Resolutely blowing his nose, meditatively
wiping his mouth, he continued to lean on the rail and watch the
desecrated but all-unsullied waves. He formulated his problem to
himself, 'How can things be so wrong, so meaningless, so filthy; and
yet also so right, so overwhelmingly significant, so exquisite?' How
wrong things were, and how exquisite, neither Paul nor any man had yet
fully discovered. But the problem was formulated. I promised myself
that I should watch with minute attention the efforts of this specially
treated member of your kind to come to terms with the universe.</p>

<p>Paul returned to his native suburb, and was welcomed into the bosom
of the home. It was good to be at home. For a while he was content to
enjoy the prospect of an endless leave, lazing in flannel trousers and
an old tweed coat. At home, where he was not expected to explain
himself, he was at peace; but elsewhere, even when he was dressed as
others, he felt an alien. He attributed his sense of isolation to his
pacifism, not knowing how far opinion had moved since the beginning of
the war. This loneliness of his was in fact due much more to my
clarifying influence in him, to his having been as it were impregnated
with seminal ideas gendered in another species and another world. He
found his mind working differently from other minds, yet he could not
detect where the difference lay. This distressed him. He hated to be
different. He longed to become an indistinguishable member of the herd,
of his own social class. He began to take great pains to dress
correctly, and to use the slang of the moment. He tried to play bridge,
but could never keep awake. He tried to play golf, but his muscles
seemed to play tricks on him at the critical moment. The truth was that
he did not really want to do these things at all. He wanted to do 'the
done thing'.</p>

<p>There was another trouble. He had not been at home more than a
fortnight before he realized with distress that his relations with his
parents were not what they had been. In the old days he used to say, 'I
have been lucky in my choice of parents. Of course they don't really
know me very well, but they understand as much as is necessary. They
are both endlessly kind, sympathetic; helpful, and they have the sense
to leave me alone.' Now, he began to see that in the old days they
really had understood him far more than he supposed, but that the thing
that he had since become was incomprehensible to them. Even at the
beginning of the war they had lost touch with him over his pacifism;
accepting it thankfully as a means of saving him from the trenches, but
never taking it seriously. Now, they were more out of touch than ever.
It seemed to him that they were living in a kind of mental Flat Land,
without acquaintance with the third dimension. They were so sensible,
so kind, so anxious to be tolerant. He could see eye to eye with them
in so many things, in all those respects in which Flat Land was in
accord with Solid Land. But every now and then intercourse would break
down. They would argue with him patiently for a while in vain; then
fall silent, regarding him with an expression in which he seemed to
see, blended together, love, pity and horror. He would then shrug his
shoulders, and wonder whether in earlier times the gulf between the
generations had ever been so wide. They, for their part, sadly told one
another that his war experience (or was it his pacifism?) had so
twisted his mind that he was 'not quite, not absolutely, sane'.</p>

<p>After a few weeks Paul went back to his old post in the big suburban
secondary school. He was surprised that they took him, in spite of his
pacifism and his incompetence. Later he discovered that his father knew
the Chairman of the Council. Ought he to resign? Probably, but he would
not. He was by now well established as one of the less brilliant but
not impossible members of the staff; and though the work never came
easily to him, it was no longer the torture that it had formerly been.
He was older, and less easily flustered. And he must have money. After
all, he found, he rather liked boys, so long as he could keep on the
right side of them. If you got wrong with them, they were hell; but if
you kept right, they were much more tolerable than most adults. The
work was respectable useful work. Indeed, it was in a way the most
important of all work, if it was done properly. Moreover, it was the
only work he could do. And he must have money; not much, but enough to
make him independent.</p>

<p>His aim at this time was to live an easy and uneventful life. He
told himself that he did want to pull his weight, but he was not
prepared to overstrain himself. He must have time to enjoy himself. He
proposed to enjoy himself in two ways, and both together. He wanted to
win his spurs in the endless tournament of sex; for his virginity
filled him with self-doubt, and disturbed his judgements about life. At
the same time he promised himself a good deal of what he called
'intellectual sight-seeing' or 'spiritual touring'. Comfortably, if not
with a first-class ticket, at least with a second-class one, he would
explore all the well-exploited travel-routes of all the continents of
the mind. Sometimes he might even venture into the untracked wild, but
not dangerously. Never again, if he could help it, would he lose touch
with civilization, with the comfortable mental structure of his
fellows, as he had done through pacifism. Thus did this war-weary young
Terrestrial propose. Much of his plan suited my purpose admirably, but
by no means the whole of it.</p>

<p>So Paul settled down to teach history, geography, English and
'scripture'. He taught whatever he was told to teach, and for mere
pity's sake, he made the stuff as palatable as he could. On the whole
the boys liked him. He seemed to regard the business much as they did
themselves, as a tiresome necessary grind, which must be done
efficiently but might be alleviated by jokes and stories. Even
discipline, formerly such a trouble to Paul, now seemed to work
automatically. This was partly because he did not worry about it,
having outgrown the notion that he must preserve his 'dignity', and
partly because in the critical first days of his new school career I
influenced his mood and his bearing so that he gave an impression of
friendliness combined with careless firmness. Paul himself was
surprised and thankful that the self-discipline of his classes relieved
him of a dreadful burden. He used to say to visitors, in front of the
class, 'You see, we have not a dictator, but a chairman.' All the same,
he secretly took credit for his achievement.</p>

<p>By thus helping Paul to establish himself in a tolerable routine, I
enabled him to keep his mind free and sensitive for other matters. The
boys themselves knew that there was another side to him. Occasionally
in class the lesson would go astray completely, and he would talk
astoundingly about things interesting to himself, things outside the
curriculum, and sometimes of very doubtful orthodoxy. He would dwell
upon the age and number of the stars, the localization of functions in
the brain, the abstractness of science and mathematics, the kinds of
insanity, the truth about Soviet Russia, the theatre and the cinema,
the cellular structure of the body, the supposed electronic structure
of the atom, death and old age, cosmopolitanism, sun-bathing, the crawl
stroke, Samuel Butler, coitus and the birth of babies. To these floods
of language the boys reacted according to their diverse natures. The
stupid slipped thankfully into torpor, the industrious revised their
home-work. The shrewd masticated whatever in the harangue seemed to
have a practical value, and spat out the rest. The intellectually
curious listened aloofly. The main mass fluctuated between amusement,
enthusiastic support, and boredom. A few sensitive ones took Paul as
their prophet. After these outbursts Paul became unusually reticent and
cautious. Sometimes he even told the boys they' had better forget it
all' because he was' a bit mad then'. He was obviously anxious that
rumour of his wildness should not go beyond the class-room door. The
sense of secrecy appealed to the boys. Whatever their diverse opinions
of the stuff, all could enjoy a conspiracy. Paul's own class began to
regard itself as something between a band of disciples (or even
prophets), a secret revolutionary society, and a pirate crew.</p>

<h3>iii. PAUL COMES TO TERMS WITH WOMAN</h3>

<p>For some months Paul was so busy becoming an efficient school-master
that he had little time for those' other matters' which I required him
to undertake. But when he had established his technique and could look
around him, he began to ask himself, 'What next?' His intention was to
see life safely, to observe all its varieties and nuances, to read it
in comfort as one might enjoy a novel of passion and agony without
being upset by it. What was the field to be covered? There was woman.
Until he had explored that field he could never give his attention to
others. There was art, literature, music. There was science. There was
the intricate spectacle of the universe, including the little
peep-show, man. There were certain philosophical questions which had
formed themselves in his mind without producing their answers. There
was religion. Was there anything in it at all? But here, as also in the
sphere of woman, one must be careful. One might so easily find oneself
too deeply entangled. For the post-war Paul, entanglement, becoming
part of the drama instead of a spectator, was to be avoided at all
costs. But could he avoid it? Could he preserve in all circumstances
this new snug aloofness, which had come to him with the end of war's
long torment of pity and shame and indignation? He knew very well that
there were strange forces in him which might wreck his plans. He must
be very careful, but the risk must be taken. His sheer curiosity, and
his cold passion for savouring the drama of the world, must be
satisfied.</p>

<p>Paul now began to lead a double life. In school-hours he tried to be
the correct schoolmaster, and save for his lapses he succeeded. Out of
school he inspected the universe. With cold judgement he decided that
the first aspect of the universe to be inspected was woman. But how?
There was Katherine. She alone, he felt, could be for him the perfect
mate. But she was obviously happy with her returned soldier and her two
children. He met her now and again. She was gentle with him, and
distressingly anxious that he should like her husband. Strangely
enough, he did like the man, as a man. He was intellectually
unexciting, but he had an interested and open mind, and could readily
be enticed out of Flat Land. Paul, however, disliked the sense that
Katherine wanted to hold the two of them in one embrace. No, he must
look elsewhere for woman, for the woman that was to show him the deep
cosmical significance of womanhood.</p>

<p>The girls of his suburb were no good. In his thwarted, virginal
state, they often stirred him, but he could not get anywhere with them.
He lacked the right touch. Sometimes he would take one of them on the
river or to a dance, or to the pictures, but nothing came of it. They
found him queer, a little ridiculous, sometimes alarming. When he
should have been audacious, he was diffident. His voice went husky and
his hand trembled. When he should have been gentle, he was rough. With
one of them, indeed, he got so far as to realize that to go further
would be disastrous; for though she was a 'dear' she was dull.
Moreover, she would expect to be married. And for marriage he had
neither means nor inclination.</p>

<p>Of course there were prostitutes. They would sell him something that
he wanted. But he wanted much more than they could sell. He wanted,
along with full physical union, that depth of intimacy which he had
known with Katherine. Once in Paris while he was coming home on leave,
a girl in the street had said to him 'Venez faire l'amour avec moi',
and he had stopped. But there was something about her, some trace of a
repugnance long since outworn, that made his cherished maleness
contemptible in his own eyes. He hurried away, telling himself she was
too unattractive. Henceforth all prostitutes reminded him of her. They
made him dislike himself.</p>

<p>What other hope was there for him? He once found himself alone with
a little dusky creature in a railway carriage. She reminded him of a
marmoset. Might he smoke, he asked. Certainly. Would she smoke too?
Well, yes, since there was no one else there. They talked about the
cinema. They arranged to meet again. He took her to a dance, and to
picture shows, and for walks. She told him she was unhappy at home.
Things advanced to such an extent that one day he put a protecting arm
round her, with his hand under her breast; and he kissed her. She began
to trust him, rely on him. Suddenly he felt an utter cad, and
determined to give her up. But when he said he would never see her
again, she wept like a child and clung to him. He told her what a beast
he was, and how he had intended merely to get what he wanted from her,
and take no responsibility. As for marrying her, he was not the
marrying sort. She said she didn't care. She didn't want marriage, she
wanted him, just now and again. Yet somehow he couldn't do it. Was it
fear of the consequences? No, not fear, shame. She was only a child,
after all, and he found himself feeling responsible for her. Damn it,
why couldn't he go through with it? It wouldn't hurt her really. It
would all be experience. But he couldn't do it. Yet he had not the
heart to keep away from her. Hell! Then why not marry her and go
through with it that way? No, that would be certain hell for both of
them. The affair began to get on his nerves. His teaching was affected;
for in class he was haunted by images of the little marmoset, of her
great wide black eyes, or of the feel of her hair on his cheek.
Obviously he must put an end to it all. He wrote her a strange muddled
letter, saying he loved her too much to go on, or too little; that in
fact he did not really love her at all, and she must make the best of
it; that he was desperately in love with her and would be miserable for
ever without her; that the upshot anyhow was that he could never see
her again. He kept to his resolve. In spite of a number of beseeching
letters, he never saw her or wrote to her again.</p>

<p>Paul thanked his stars he had escaped from that trap. But his
problem remained completely unsolved. How was he to come to terms with
this huge factor in the universe, woman? For in his present state he
could not but regard sex as something fundamental to the universe. He
was desperate. He could not keep his mind off woman. Every train of
thought brought him to the same dead end, woman, and how he was to cope
with her. He spent hours wandering in the streets of the metropolis,
watching all the slender figures, the silken ankles, the faces. Even in
his present thwarted and obsessed mood, in which every well-formed girl
seemed to him desirable, his interest was in part disinterested,
impersonal. Behind his personal problem lay the universal problem. What
was the cosmical significance of this perennial effloresence of
femininity, this host of 'other' beings, ranging from the commonplace
to the exquisite? Many of them were just female animals, some so
brutish as to stir him little more than a bitch baboon; some though
merely animal, were animals of his kind, and they roused in him a
frankly animal but none the less divine desire. So at least he told
himself. Many, on the other hand, he felt were more than animal, and
the worse for it. They were the marred and vulgar products of a vulgar
civilization. But many also, so it seemed to him, were divinely human
and more than human. They eloquently manifested the woman-spirit, the
female mode of the cosmic spirit. They had but to move a hand or turn
the head or lean ever so slightly, ever so tenderly toward a lover, and
Paul was smitten with a hushed, a religious, wonder. What was the
meaning of it all? The man-spirit in himself, he said, demanded
communion with one of these divine manifestations. The thing must be
done. It was a sacred trust that he must fulfil. But how?</p>

<p>He made the acquaintance of a young actress whom he had often
admired from the auditorium. He took her out a good deal. He spent more
money on her than he could afford. But this relationship, like the
other, came to nothing. It developed into a kind of brother-sister
affection, though spiced with a sexual piquancy. Whenever he tried to
bring in a more sensual element, she was distressed, and he was torn
between resentment and self-reproach.</p>

<p>There were others. But nothing came of any of them, except a
ceaseless expenditure on dance tickets, theatre tickets, chocolates,
suppers, gifts. There was also a more ruinous and no less barren,
expense of spirit, and a perennial sense of frustration. The girls that
he really cared for he was afraid of hurting. Of course, he might marry
one of them, if he could find one willing. But he felt sure he would be
a bad husband, that he would be sick to death of the relationship
within a month. And anyhow he could not afford a wife. On the other
hand, the girls toward whom he felt no responsibility, he feared for
his own sake, lest they should entangle him. Meanwhile he was becoming
more and more entangled in his own obsession. The intellectual touring
which he had proposed for himself, and was even now, in a desultory
manner, undertaking, was becoming a labour instead of a delight,
because he could not free his mind from woman. In bed at night he would
writhe and mutter self-pityingly, 'God, give me a woman!'</p>

<p>At last he decided to go with a prostitute. On the way with her he
was like a starved dog ready to eat anything. But when he was alone
with her, it suddenly came over him with a flood of shame and
self-ridicule, that here was a girl, at bottom a 'good sort' too, who
did not want him at all, and yet had to put up with him. It must be
like having to make your living by hiring out your tooth-brush to
strangers. How she must despise him! His hunger vanished. She tried to
rouse him, using well-practised arts. But it was no good. He saw
himself through her eyes. He felt his own body as she would feel it,
clinging, repugnant. Stammering that he was ill, he put down his money,
and fled.</p>

<p>From the point of view of my work with Paul the situation was very
unsatisfactory. It was time to free his mind for the wider life that I
required of him. I decided that the most thorough cure could be
obtained only by means of Katherine, who was by now a superb young wife
and mother. I therefore entered her once more, and found that by a
careful use of my most delicate arts I might persuade her to serve my
purpose. Five years of exceptionally happy marriage had deepened her
spirit and enlarged her outlook. The colt had grown into a noble mare,
the anxious young suburban miss into a mature and zestful woman, whose
mind was surprisingly untrammelled. I found her still comfortably in
love with the husband that I had given her, and the constant friend of
her children. But also I found, on deeper inspection, a core of
peaceful aloofness, of detachment from all the joys and anxieties of
her busy life; of detachment, as yet unwitting, even from the moral
conventions which hitherto she had had no cause to question. I found,
too, a lively interest in her renewed acquaintance with Paul She saw
clearly that he was in distress, that he was 'sexually dead-ended '.
Such was the phrase she used to describe Paul's condition to her
husband. She felt responsible for his trouble. Also, before I began to
work on her, she had already recognized in herself a tender echo of her
old love for Paul. But without my help she would never have taken the
course toward which I now began to lead her. For long she brooded over
Paul and his trouble and her own new restlessness. Little by little I
made her see that Paul would be for ever thwarted unless she let
herself be taken. I also forced her to admit to herself that she wanted
him to take her. At first she saw the situation conventionally, and was
terrified lest Paul should ruin all her happiness. For a while she
shunned him. But Paul himself was being drawn irresistibly under her
spell; and when at last she forbade him to come near her, he was so
downcast and so acquiescent, that she shed tears for him. He duly kept
away, and she increasingly wanted him.</p>

<p>But presently, looking into her own heart with my help, she realized
a great and comforting truth about herself, and another truth about
Paul. She did not want him forever, but only for sometimes. For ever,
she wanted her husband, with whom she had already woven an intricate
and lovely pattern of life, not yet completed, scarcely more than
begun. But with Paul also she had begun to weave a pattern long ago;
and now she would complete it, not as was first intended, but in
another and less intricate style. It would re-vitalize her, enrich her,
give her a new bloom and fragrance for her husband's taking. And Paul,
she knew, would find new life. With all the art at her command she
would be woman for him, and crown his manhood, and set him free from
his crippling obsession, free to do all the fine things which in old
days he had talked of doing. For this was the truth that she had
realized about Paul, that he also had another life to lead, independent
of her, that for him, too, their union must be not an end but a
refreshment.</p>

<p>But what about her husband? If only he could be made to feel that
there was no danger of his losing her, or of his ceasing to be
spiritually her husband, he ought surely to see the sanity of her
madness. The thought of talking to him about it all made her recognize
how mad she really was, how wicked, too. But somehow the recognition
did not dismay her, for I kept her plied with clear thoughts and frank
desires, which somehow robbed the conventions of their sanctity.</p>

<p>Katherine I had dealt with successfully. But there remained the more
difficult task of persuading her husband, Richard. I had at the outset
chosen him carefully; but now, when I took up my position in his mind,
I was more interested in my experiment than hopeful of its success. It
would have been easy to infatuate him with some woman, and so render
him indifferent to his wife's conduct. But if tolerance had to rest
merely, on indifference, this marriage, in which I took some pride,
would have been spoiled. I had decided, moreover, that Richard's
predicament would afford me the opportunity of a crucial piece of
research upon your species. I was curious to know whether it would be
possible so to influence him that he should regard the whole matter
with Neptunian sanity.</p>

<p>I took some pains to prepare him, leading his mind to ruminate in
unfamiliar fields. I did nothing to dim in any way his desire for his
wife; on the contrary, I produced in him a very detailed and exquisite
apprehension of her. And when at last she found courage to tell him of
her plan, I used all my skill to give him full imaginative insight into
her love for Paul and her different love for himself. It was very
interesting to watch his reaction. For a few minutes he sat gazing at
his wife in silence. Then he said that of course she must do what
seemed best to her, but he asked her to give him time to think. For a
whole day he acted to himself the part of the devoted and discarded
husband, biting through a pipe-stem in the course of his tortured
meditations. He conceived a dozen plans for preventing the disaster,
and dismissed them all. Already on the second day, however, he saw the
situation more calmly, even with something like Neptunian detachment;
and on the third he recognized with my help that it did not concern him
at all in any serious manner how Katherine should spend her holiday,
provided that she should come back to him gladly, and with enhanced
vitality.</p>

<p>Paul and Katherine took a tent and went off together for three
weeks. They pitched beside a little bay on the rocky and seal-haunted
coast of Pembroke. In this choice they had been unwittingly influenced
by me. Thoughts of my recent (and remotely future) holiday on a
Neptunian coast infected them with a desire for rocks and the sea. In
this holiday of theirs I myself found real refreshment. Through the
primitive mind of Paul I rejoiced in the primitive body and primitive
spirit of Katherine.</p>

<p>She was already well practised in the art of love, at least in the
unsubtle Terrestrial mode. Paul was a novice. But now he surprised
himself, and Katherine also, by the fire, the assurance, the
gentleness, the sweet banter of his wooing. Well might he, for I who am
not inexperienced even according to Neptunian standards, prompted him
at every turn of his dalliance. Not only was I determined, for my
work's sake, to afford these two children full enrichment of one
another, but also I myself, by now so well adapted to the Terrestrial
sphere, was deeply stirred by this 'almost woman', this doe of a
half-human species. Her real beauty, interwoven with the reptilian
clumsiness of an immature type, smote me with a savage delight of the
flesh, and yet also with a vast remoteness which issued in grave
tenderness and reverence.</p>

<p>They lay long in the mornings, with the sun pouring in at the open
end of the tent. They swam together in the bay, pretending to be seals.
They cooked and washed up, and shopped in the neighbouring village.
They scrambled over the rocks and the heather. And they made love. In
the night, and also naked on the sunlit beach, they drank one another
in through eye and ear and tactile flesh. Of many things they spoke
together, sitting in the evening in the opening of the tent. One night
there was a storm. The tent was blown down, and their bedding was wet.
They dressed under the floundering canvas, and having made things
secure, for the rest of the night they walked in the rain, reeling with
sleep. Next day they repaired the tent, spread out their blankets in
the sun, and on the sunny grass they lay down to sleep. Paul murmured,
'We could have been man and wife so well.' But Katherine roused herself
to say, 'No, no! Richard has me for keeps, and you for sometimes. I
should hate you for a husband, you'd be too tiring, and probably no
good with children. Paul, if I have a baby, it will count as
Richard's.'</p>

<p>For three weeks Paul basked in intimacy with the bland Katherine.
This, then, was woman, this intricacy of lovely volumes and movements,
of lovely resistances and yieldings, of play, laughter and quietness.
She was just animal made perfect, and as such she was unfathomable
spirit at once utterly dependable and utterly incalculable, mysterious.
Paul knew, even in his present huge content, that there was much more
of woman than was revealed to him, more which could only be known
through long intimacy, in fact in the stress and long-suffering and
intricate concrescence of marriage. This, Richard had, but he himself
had not, perhaps would never have. The thought saddened him; but it did
not bite into him poisonously, as his virginity had done.
Fundamentally, he was to be henceforth in respect of woman at peace.
Her beauties would no longer taunt him and waylay him and tether him.
Henceforth he would have strength of her, not weakness.</p>

<p>In these expectations Paul was justified. His retarded spirit,
starved hitherto of women, now burgeoned. I could detect in him day by
day, almost hour by hour, new buds and growing points of sensitivity,
of percipience, hitherto suppressed by the long winter of his
frustration. Even during the rapturous holiday itself, when his whole
interest was centred on the one being and on his love play with her, he
was at the same time exfoliating into a new and vital cognizance of
more remote spheres. On their last day he wrote this poem:</p>

<pre>
Last night.
walking on the heath.
she and I.
alive.
condescended toward the stars.
For then we knew
quite surely
that all the pother of the universe
was but a prelude to that summer night
and our uniting.
and all the ages to come
but a cadence
after our loving.
Nestled down into the heather.
we laughed.
and took joy of one another.
justifying the cosmic enterprise for ever
by the moments of our caressing.
while the simple stars
watched
unseeing.
Thus lovers, nations, worlds, nay galaxies.
conceive themselves the crest of all that is.
</pre>

<h3>iv. LONDON AND THE SPIRIT</h3>

<p>Paul spent the last fortnight of his summer holiday at home,
preparing for the next term, and feeling the influence of Katherine
spread deeply into his being. When he returned to work, he found that
he looked about him with fresh interest. Walking in the streets of
London, he now saw something besides stray flowers of femininity adrift
on the stream of mere humanity. He saw the stream itself, to which,
after all, the women were not alien but integral. And just as woman had
been a challenge to him, so now the great human flood was a challenge
to him, something which he must come to terms with, comprehend.</p>

<p>The time had come for me to attempt my most delicate piece of work
on Paul, the experiment which was to lead me to a more inward and
sympathetic apprehension of your kind than anything that had hitherto
been possible; the deep and subtle manipulation which incidentally
would give Paul a treasure of experience beyond the normal reach of the
first Men. It was my aim to complete in him the propaedeutic influence
with which I had occasionally disturbed him in childhood. I therefore
set about to induce in him such an awakened state that he should see in
all things, and with some constancy, the dazzling intensity of being,
the depth beyond depth of significance, which even in childhood he had
glimpsed, though rarely. With this heightened percipience he must
assess his own mature and deeper self and the far wider and more
fearsome world which he now inhabited. Then should I be able to observe
how far and with what idiosyncrasies the mentality of your kind, thus
aided, could endure the truth and praise it.</p>

<p>It was chiefly in the streets and in the class-room that Paul found
his challenge, but also, as had ever been the case with him, under the
stars. Their frosty glance had now for him a more cruel, a more
wounding significance than formerly, a significance which drew
poignancy not only from echoes of the street, and the class-room, and
from the sunned flesh of Katherine, but also from the war.</p>

<p>Paul had promised himself that when he had come to terms with woman
he would devote his leisure to that intellectual touring in which he
had never yet been able seriously to indulge. But even now, it seemed,
he was not to carry out his plan, or at least not with the comfort and
safety which he desired. What was meant to be a tour of well-marked and
well-guided routes of the mind, threatened to become in fact a
desperate adventure in lonely altitudes of the spirit. It was as though
by some inner compulsion he were enticed to travel not through but
above all the mental cities and dominions, not on foot but in the air;
as though he who had no skill for flight were to find himself
perilously exploring the currents and whirlpools, the invisible cliffs
and chasms, of an element far other than the earth; which, however, now
displayed to his miraculous vision a detailed inwardness opaque to the
pedestrian observer.</p>

<p>Even in the class-room, expounding to reluctant urchins the
structure of sentences, the provisions of Magna Carta, the products of
South America, Paul constantly struggled for balance in that remote
ethereal sphere. Sometimes he would even fall into complete
abstraction, gazing with disconcerting intensity at some boy or other,
while the particular juvenile spirit took form in his imagination,
conjured by my skill. He would begin by probing behind the defensive
eyes into the vast tangled order of blood-vessels and nerve fibres. He
would seem to watch the drift of blood corpuscles, the very movements
of atoms from molecule to molecule. He would narrow his eyes in
breathless search for he knew not what. Then suddenly, not out there
but somehow in the depth of his own being, the immature somnolent
spirit of the child would confront him. He would intimately savour
those little lusts and fears, those little joys and unwilling efforts,
all those quick eager movements of a life whose very earnestness was
but the earnestness of a dream. With the boy's hand in the boy's pocket
he would finger pennies and sixpences, or a precious knife or toy. He
would look into all the crannies of that mind, noting here a promise to
be fulfilled, there a blank insensitivity, here some passion
unexpressed and festering. Rapt in this contemplation, he would fall
blind to everything but this unique particular being, this featured
monad. Or he would hold it up in contrast with himself, as one might
hold for comparison in the palm of the hand two little crystals, or in
the field of the telescope a double star. Sometimes it would seem to
him that the boy and himself were indeed two great spheres of light
hugely present to one another, yet held eternally distinct from one
another by the movement, the swing, of their diverse individualities.
Then, like a memory from some forgotten life, there would come to him
the thought, 'This is just Jackson Minor, a boy whom I must teach.' And
then, 'Teach what'!' And the answer, more apt than explicit, 'Teach to
put forth an ever brighter effulgence of the spirit.'</p>

<p>While Paul was thus rapt, some movement would recall the class to
him, and he would realize with a kind of eager terror that not only one
but many of these huge presences were in the room with him. It was as
though by some miracle a company of majestic and angelic beings was
crowded upon this pin-point floor. And yet he knew that they were just
a bunch of lads, just a collection of young and ephemeral human
animals, who almost in the twinkle of a star would become black-coated
citizens, parents, grandparents and discreetly laid-out corpses.
Between then and now, what would they do'! What were they for'! They
would do geography and scripture, they would make money or fail to make
money, they would take young women to the pictures, they would do the
done thing, and say the said thing. Then one day they would realize
that they were growing old. Some of them would scream that they had not
yet begun to live, others would shrug and drift heavily gravewards. So
it would be, but why?</p>

<p>In the lunch hour, or when the school day was over, or in the
evening when he was waiting to go to some show, he would let himself
glide on the street flood to watch the faces, the action, to speculate
on the significance of this gesture and that.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would walk unperturbed through street after street,
carelessly turning the pages of the great picture book, dwelling
lightly for a moment on this or that, on this comicality or elegance,
on that figure of defeat or of complacency. Straying up Regent Street,
he would amuse himself by sorting out the natives from the provincial
visitors, and the foreign nationals from one another. He would surmise
whether that painted duchess knew how desolate she looked, or that
Lancashire holiday-maker how conscious that he was a stranger here, or
whether the sweeper, with slouch hat and broom, felt, as he looked,
more real than the rest. Odours would assail him: odour of dust and
horse-dung, odour of exhaust fumes, rubber and tar, odour of cosmetics
precariously triumphing over female sweat. Sounds would assail him:
footsteps, leather-hard and rubber-soft, the hum and roar of motors,
the expostulation of their horns; voices also of human animals, some
oddly revealing, others a mere mask of sound, a carapace of standard
tone, revealing nothing. Above all, forms and colours would assail him
with their depths of significance. Well-tailored young women, discreet
of glance; others more blowsy, not so discreet. Young men, vacantly
correct, or betraying in some movement of the hand or restlessness of
the eye an undercurrent of self-doubt. Old men, daughter-attended,
tremblingly holding around their withered flesh the toga of seniority,
bath-wrap-wise. Women of a past decade, backward leaning for weight of
bosom, bullock-eyed, uncomprehending, backward straining under the
impending pole-axe. After the smooth drift of Regent Street, he would
find himself in the rapids of Oxford Street, buffeted, whirled hither
and thither by successive vortices of humanity, of tweed-clad men, and
women of artificial silk, of children toffee-smeared, of parents
piloting their families, of messenger boys, soldiers, sailors, Indian
students, and everywhere the constant flood of indistinguishable
humanity, neither rich nor poor, neither beautiful nor ugly, neither
happy nor sad, but restless, obscurely anxious, like a dog shivering
before a dying fire.</p>

<p>At some point or other of his easeful wandering a change would
probably happen to Paul. He would suddenly feel himself oppressed and
borne down by the on-coming flood of his fellows. He would realize that
he himself was but one indistinguishable drop in this huge continuum;
that everything most unique and characteristic in him he had from It;
that nothing whatever was himself, not even this craving for discrete
existence; that the contours of his body and his mind had no more
originality than one ripple in a wave-train. But with a violent
movement of self-affirmation he would inwardly cry out, 'I am I, and
not another.' Then in a flash he would feel his reality, and believe
himself to be a substantial spirit, and eternal. For a moment all these
others would seem to him but as moving pictures in the panorama of his
own all-embracing self. But almost immediately some passing voice-tone
in the crowd, some passing gesture, would stab him, shame him into
realization of others. It would be as in the class-room. He would be
overwhelmed not by the featureless drops of an ocean, but by a great
company of unique and diverse spirits. Behind each on-coming pair of
eyes he would glimpse a whole universe, intricate as his own, but
different; similar in its basic order, but different in detail, and
permeated through and through by a different mood, a different
ground-tone or timbre. Each of them was like a ship forging toward him,
moving beside him and beyond, and trailing a great spreading wake of
past life, past intercourse with the world. He himself, it seemed, was
tossed like a cork upon the inter-crossing trains of many past careers.
Looking at them one by one as they came upon him, he seemed to see with
his miraculous vision the teeming experiences of each mind, as with a
telescope one may see on the decks of a passing liner a great company
of men and women, suddenly made real and intimate, though inaccessible.
The ship's bow rises to the slow waves, and droops, in sad reiteration,
as she thrusts her way forward, oxlike, obedient to some will above her
but not of her. And so, seemingly, those wayfarers blindly thrust
forward on their courses, hand-to-mouth fulfilment of their mechanism,
ignorant of the helmsman's touch, the owner's instructions. Here,
bearing down upon him, would appear perhaps a tall woman with nose like
a liner's stem, and fo'c'sle brows. Then perhaps an old gentleman with
the white wave of his moustache curling under his prow. Then a rakish
young girl. Then a bulky freighter. Thus Paul would entertain himself
with fantasies, till sooner or later a bleak familiar thought would
strike him. Each of these vessels of the spirit (this was the phrase he
used) had indeed a helmsman, keeping her to some course or other; had
even a master, who worked out the details of navigation and set the
course; but of owner's instructions he was in most cases completely
ignorant. And so these many ships ploughed hither and thither on the
high seas vainly, not fulfilling, but forlornly seeking, instructions.
And because the mechanism of these vessels was not of insensitive steel
but of desires and loathings, passions and admirations, Paul was filled
with a great pity for them, and for himself as one of them, a pity for
their half-awakened state between awareness and unawareness.</p>

<p>After such experiences in the heart of the city, Paul, in the train
for his southern suburb, would already change his mood. Even while the
train crossed the river the alteration would come. He would note,
perhaps, the sunset reflected in the water. Though so unfashionable, it
was after all alluring. The barges and tugs, jewelled with port and
starboard and mast-head lights, the vague and cliffy rank of buildings,
the trailing smoke, all these the sunset dignified. Of course it was
nothing but a flutter of ether waves and shifting atoms, glorified by
sentimental associations. Yet it compelled attention and an irrational
worship. Sometimes Paul withdrew himself from it into his evening
paper, resentful of this insidious romanticism. Sometimes he yielded to
it, excusing himself in the name of Whitehead.</p>

<p>If it was a night-time crossing, with the dim stars beyond the smoke
and glow of London, Paul would experience that tremor of recognition,
of unreasoning expectation, which through my influence the stars had
ever given him, and now gave him again, tinctured with a new dread, a
new solemnity.</p>

<p>And when at last he was at home, and, as was his custom, walking for
a few minutes on the Down before going to bed, he would feel, if it
were a jewelled night, the overwhelming presence of the Cosmos. It was
on these occasions that I could most completely master him, and even
lift him precariously to the Neptunian plane. First he would have a
powerful apprehension of the earth's rotundity, of the continents and
oceans spreading beneath him and meeting under his feet. Then would I,
using my best skill on the many keyboards of his brain, conjure in him
a compelling perception of physical immensity, of the immensity first
of the galactic universe, with its intermingling streams of stars, its
gulfs of darkness; and then the huger immensity of the whole cosmos.
With the eye of imagination he would perceive the scores, the millions,
of other universes, drifting outwards in all directions like the
fire-spray of a rocket. Then, fastening his attention once more on the
stray atom earth, he would seem to see it forging through time,
trailing its long wake of aeons, thrusting forward into its vaster, its
more tempestuous future. I would let him glimpse that future. I would
pour into the overflowing cup of his mind a torrent of visions. He
would conceive and sensuously experience (as it were tropical rain
descending on his bare head) the age-long but not everlasting downpour
of human generations. Strange human-inhuman faces would glimmer before
him and vanish. By a simple device I made these glimpsed beings
intimate to him; for I permitted him ever and again to see in them
something of Katherine, though mysteriously transposed. And in the
strange aspirations, strange fears, strange modes of the spirit that
would impose themselves upon his tortured but exultant mind I took care
that he should feel the strange intimate remoteness that he knew in
Katherine. With my best art I would sometimes thrash the strings of his
mind to echoes of man's last, most glorious achievement. And here again
I would kindle this high theme with Katherine. Along with all this
richness and splendour of human efflorescence I established in him an
enduring emotional certainty that in the end is downfall and agony,
then silence. This he had felt already as implicit in the nature of his
own species, his own movement of the symphony; but now through my
influence he knew with an absolute conviction that such must be the end
also of all things human.</p>

<p>Often he would cry out against this fate, inwardly screaming like a
child dropped from supporting arms. But little by little, as the months
and years passed over him, he learned to accept this issue, to accept
it at least in the deepest solitude of his own being, but not always to
conduct himself in the world according to the final discipline of this
acceptance.</p>

<p>At last there came a night when Paul, striding alone through the
rough grass of the Down, facing the Pole Star and the far glow of
London, wakened to a much clearer insight. One of Katherine's children
had recently been knocked over by a car and seriously hurt. Paul saw
Katherine for a few moments after the accident. With shock he saw her,
for she was changed. Her mouth had withered. Her eyes looked at him
like the eyes of some animal drowning in a well. It was upon the
evening of that day that Paul took this most memorable of all his walks
upon the Down. I plied him, as so often before, with images of cosmical
pain and grief, and over all of them he saw the changed face of
Katherine. Suddenly the horror, the cruelty of existence burst upon him
with a new and insupportable violence, so that he cried out, stumbled,
and fell. It seemed to him in his agony of compassion that if only the
pain of the world were his own pain it might become endurable; but it
was the pain of others, and therefore he could never master it with
that strange joy which he knew was sometimes his. If all pain could be
made his own only, he could surely grasp it firmly and put it in its
place in the exquisite pattern of things. Yet could he? He remembered
that mostly he was a coward, that he could not endure pain even as well
as others, that it undermined him, and left him abject. But sometimes
he had indeed been able to accept its very painfulness with a strange,
quiet joy.</p>

<p>He thought of a thing to do. He would have a careful look at this
thing, pain. And so, sitting up in the grass, he took out his
pocket-knife, opened the big blade, and forced the point through the
palm of his left hand. Looking fixedly at the Pole Star, he twisted the
blade about, while the warm blood spread over his hand and trickled on
to the grass. With the first shock his body had leapt, and now it
writhed. The muscles of his face twisted, he set his teeth lest he
should scream. His forehead was wet and cold, and faintness surged over
him; but still he looked at Polaris, and moved the knife.</p>

<p>Beneath the Star spread the glow of London, a pale glory
over-arching the many lives. On his moist face, the wind. In his hand,
grasped in the palm of his hand, the thing, pain. In his mind's eye the
face of Katherine, symbol of all compassion. And, surging through him,
induced by my power in him, apprehensions of cosmical austerity.</p>

<p>Then it was that Paul experienced the illumination which was
henceforth to rule his life. In a sudden blaze of insight he saw more
deeply into his own nature and the world's than had ever before been
possible to him. While the vision lasted, he sat quietly on the grass
staunching his wounded hand and contemplating in turn the many facets
of his new experience. Lest he should afterwards fail to recapture what
was now so exquisitely clear, he put his findings into words, which
however seemed incapable of expressing more than the surrounding glow
of his experience, leaving the bright central truth unspoken.</p>

<p>'This pain in my hand', he said, 'is painful because of the
interruption that has been caused in the harmonious living of my flesh.
All pain is hateful in that it is an interruption, a discord, an
infringement of some theme of living, whether lowly or exalted. This
pain in my hand, which is an infringement of my body's lowly living, is
not, it so happens, an infringement also of my spirit. No. Entering
into my spirit, this pain is a feature of beauty. My spirit? What do I
really mean by that? There is first I, the minded body, or the embodied
mind; and there is also my spirit. What is it? Surely it is no
substantial thing. It is the music rather, which I, the instrument, may
produce, and may also appreciate. My glory is, not to preserve myself,
but to create upon the strings of myself the music that is spirit, in
whatever degree of excellence I may; and to appreciate the music in
myself and others, and in the massed splendours of the cosmos, with
whatever insight I can muster. Formerly I was dismayed by the knowledge
that pain's evil was intrinsic to pain. But now I see clearly that
though this is so, though pain's evil to the pain-blinded creature is
an absolute fact in the universe, yet the very evil itself may have a
place in the music which spirit is. There is no music without the
torture of the strings. Even the over-straining, the slow wearing out,
the sudden shattering of instruments may be demanded for the full
harmony of this dread music. Nay, more. In this high music of the
spheres, even the heartless betrayals, the mean insufficiencies of
will, common to all human instruments, unwittingly contribute by their
very foulness to the intolerable, the inhuman, beauty of the
music.'</p>

<p>By now Paul, having bound up his hand, having wiped his knife and
put it away, had risen to his feet, and was walking towards home with
trembling knees, pursuing his argument.</p>

<p>'To make the music that spirit is, that, I now see, is the end for
which all living things exist, from the humblest to the most exalted.
In two ways they make it: gloriously, Purposefully, in their loyal
strivings, but also shamefully, unwittingly, in their betrayals.
Without Satan, with God only, how poor a universe, how trite a music!
Purposefully to contribute to the music that spirit is, this is the
great beatitude. It is permitted only to the elect. But the damned
also, even they, contribute, though unwittingly. Purposefully to
contribute upon the strings of one's own being, and also to respond
with ecstasy to the great cosmic theme inflooding from all other
instruments, this is indeed the sum of duty, and of beatitude. Though
in my own conduct I were to betray the music which is spirit, and in my
own heart dishonour it, yet seemingly it is not in reality sullied; for
it dare avail itself alike of Christ and Judas. Yet must I not betray
it, not dishonour it. Yet if I do, it will not be sullied. Mystery!
Purposefully to make the music that spirit is, and to delight in it!
The delighting and suffering of all minded beings are within the music.
Even this very profound, very still delight, this ecstasy, with which I
now contemplate my hand's pain and Katherine's distress and the long
effort and agony of the worlds, this also is a contribution to the
music which it contemplates. Why am I thus chosen? I do not know. But
it is irrelevant that this instrument rather than that should sound
this theme and not another, create this ecstasy and not that agony.
What matters is the music, that it should unfold itself through the
ages, and be fulfilled in whatever end is fitting, and crowned with
admiration, worship. But if it should never be rightly fulfilled, and
never meetly crowned? I have indeed a very clear conviction that over
the head of time the whole music of the cosmos is all the while a
fulfilled perfection, the eternal outcome of the past, the present and
the future. But if I am mistaken? Then if it is not perfected, it is at
least very excellent. For this much my eyes have seen.'</p>

<p>He was now coming down the slope toward the street lamps and lighted
windows. On the other side of the little valley the water-tower of the
lunatic asylum rose black against the sky. He stood for a while. At
that moment a faint sound came to him from across the valley. Was it a
cat? Or had a dog been run over? Or was it a human sound between
laughter and horror? To Paul it came as the asylum's comment on his
meditation. Or was it the comment of the whole modern age? For a while,
he kept silent, then said aloud, 'Yes, you may be right. Perhaps it is
I that am mad. But if so this madness is better than sanity. Better,
and more sane.'</p>

himself.</p>

THE RESEARCH iv. PAUL SETTLES DOWN</blockquote>

<h3>i. PAUL UNDERTAKES HIS TASK</h3>

<p>WITH this spiritual achievement solidly accomplished, Paul was ready
to observe London and the world with new eyes. In fact he was now well
fitted to carry out the main work that I had purposed for him. He
himself would have been content simply to carry on his teaching with
new vitality and conscientiousness, and for the rest to pursue with
deeper understanding his leisurely tour of the countries of the mind.
But he was soon to discover that more was demanded of him, and that he
who had so lately learned the lesson of quietness, must now embark on a
life more active, more resolute, than anything that he had formerly
attempted.</p>

<p>His new purpose dawned on him slowly, and as it became clear to him
and formidable, he both lusted in it and feared it. His final and
precise apprehension of it flashed upon him as he was waiting on the
top of a stationary and throbbing motor-omnibus outside the great
railway terminus of Cannon Street, watching the streams of bowlered or
soft-hatted business men, hurrying to their offices. There surged
through him suddenly a violent hunger, or was it a sacred call, to
apprehend precisely and with understanding the whole phenomenon of the
modern world, to see it in relation to his recent vision, to discover
its deeper significance. So insistent was this new craving that he had
to restrain himself from descending there and then into the street to
ask each of the crowd in turn what he was really doing with his life,
and why.</p>

<p>Paul was frightened by the violence of his own desire, and by its
quality of freakishness, even of insanity. He pulled himself together
and argued against it. It would interfere with his own work, and with
his peace of mind. He was not fitted for any such world-study.
Moreover, he ought not to give up his life to merely apprehending; he
must do, must serve. However well he should understand, the world would
be none the better.</p>

<p>As the days passed, however, this new craving took firmer hold of
him. He felt it growing into an irresistible, an insane obsession. So
violently did he strive to exorcize it, that he was threatened with
breakdown. Clearly, if he were forced to pursue my purpose against this
desperate reluctance, he would pursue it ill. I therefore decided that,
in order to gain his willing co-operation, I must attempt to give him a
frank and precise explanation of my relations with him. This would be a
difficult undertaking, and one which would have been impossible to
carry out on any but a carefully selected and prepared individual.</p>

<p>One night, as Paul was lying in bed, I constructed in his
imagination a detailed image of myself as I should have appeared to his
eyes. He saw me as a great grey human monolith, snake-eyed. I then
spoke to him, through his own imagination. I explained that I was a
human being of the remote future, living upon Neptune, and that it was
my task to study the Terrestrial ages of Man. For this work, I said, I
had chosen him as my instrument. If necessary I could by an inner
compulsion force him to work for me, but the work would fare better if
he would enter into it willingly. I explained that, by helping me to
render something of Terrestrial history into the consciousness of my
own species, which, I said, was mentally far more advanced than his
own, he would be serving not only me but his own kind.</p>

<p>Next morning Paul recalled the night's experience with amazement,
but dismissed it as a dream. On succeeding nights I influenced him
again, giving him more detail of my world and my power over himself. I
referred him, moreover, to two books. One of these, already published,
was An Experiment with Time, by J. W. Dunne, This work, I told him,
though to the Neptunian mind it was philosophically naive, might help
him to understand the incursion of future events into the present. The
other book, which would be called Last and First Men, had yet to
appear.</p>

<p>When Paul encountered the first of these books, he was profoundly
disturbed, and still more so when, some months later, he read the other
in manuscript. He now became convinced of the reality of my intercourse
with him. For a while he was terrified and revolted at the knowledge
that another human mind had access to his every thought, and could even
induce him to think and desire as it was not in his own nature to think
and desire. That his character should be largely the product of another
mind seemed to him at first an intolerable violation of his privacy,
nay, of his identity. I had therefore to remind him, patiently and
night by night, that even apart from my power over him he was an
expression of influences other than himself, that whatever was
distinctive of him was not truly his at all. 'You forget', I said,
'that your nature is the product of an infinite mesh of causes; of
evolution, of the hither-thither turmoil of human history, and finally
of your parents, of Katherine, of the war, and of your boys. Will you
then rebel because yet another influence, hitherto unsuspected, is
discovered to have part in you, an influence, too, which has very
greatly increased your spiritual stature? If so, your recent
illumination on the Down was less deep than it should have been. You
have not realized in your heart that the bare private individuality is
a negligible thing, that what is glorious or base is the form which
circumstance imposes on it. I myself am in the same case with you. I am
the product of a vast web of circumstance, and my mind is probably open
to the critical inspection and even the influence of I know not what
beings superior to myself. Compared with you I am indeed of a higher
order of mentality, but no credit is due to me for this greater
richness and significance of my nature. As well might the concluding
chord of a symphony take credit for the significance poured into it by
all its predecessors. There is of course in both of us, and in all men,
and all living things, and all sub-vital beings, the one universal
miracle of spontaneous doing, which is the essential life of all
existence. Through the aid or the limitation of circumstance some may
do much, others little. What matter which of us does which? All the
tones of the music are needed for the music's perfection. And it is the
music alone that matters, not the glorification of this instrument or
that.'</p>

<p>In a few days Paul was reconciled to his fate to such an extent that
he began eagerly to debate with himself how he should gratify the new
passion which hitherto he had only with difficulty restrained. The
fervour with which he embarked on his task combined the lusty hunger of
an appetite with the exaltation of a sacred duty.</p>

<p>I further prepared him by making him realize that his recent
experience on the Down was the vital spark lacking to all typical
modern thought, the missing and all-relevant word without which its
jumble of verbiage could never make sense, the still small voice which
alone, working in each heart, could ever bring peace to the modern
world. Paul knew, of course, that this experience of his was by no
means unique. Other ages had more profoundly entered into it. Even in
his own age it sometimes occurred. But it had played little part in the
common life of the mind; the few who had known it had nearly always
withdrawn into their inner fortress. Disengaging themselves from the
dross which confuses modern thought, they had at the same time
unwittingly rejected a treasure which had never before come within
man's reach. Contenting themselves with vain repetitions of old truths,
they were deaf to the new truth which was as yet but stammeringly
expressing itself in men's minds. They could see very clearly the
central error of the modern spirit, namely, the belief that reality is
wholly included in the world of sense. Revolting from this folly, they
erroneously declared this world a phantom and a snare, and naively
conceived that in their ecstasy the soul, escaping from illusion, found
herself at last untrammelled and immortal. I was at pains to make Paul
see unmistakably that, for those who have entered superficially into
the life of the spirit, this is the most insidious, the most lethal of
all snares.</p>

<p>On the day after his illumination upon the Down, Paul had told
himself that he had escaped from the foundering vessel of himself. The
swarms of his fellow men and women all over the world could do nothing
but labour incessantly from wave to wave of the maelstrom, pausing only
now and then on some crest to look around them and realize that they
were ploughing a waste of waters; and that one and all must sink. Paul
saw them tormented by self-prizing; though also more nobly tortured and
exalted by personal love, and by the intensified pain of watching the
beloved's pain. This it was, indeed, that chiefly dignified them above
the beasts. But this also it was that tethered them to the waste of
waters, like foundering may-flies. Their interest was almost wholly
personal, either in self-regard, or hate, or love; but increasingly
they saw that in the waste of existence there could be no lasting home
for personal spirits anywhere, and so no permanency of comfort for
anyone's beloved. Each of them, and each beloved, must settle heavily
down into old age, like leaky vessels. If only they could have sunk in
battle array fighting for some great cause! But their sailing orders
had not come through to them, or had been so mutilated that they found
no clear direction.</p>

<p>Thus Paul had figured things out on the day after his illumination.
By some miracle he himself, seemingly, had escaped from the foundering
vessel of himself. He had escaped simply by a leap of the imagination,
a soaring flight into the upper air; whence, selfless, he could watch
the shipwreck of himself and all selves with a strange, still
compassion, but without revolt. Yet subsequently, under my continued
influence, he saw that this image was false and dangerous. He had not
escaped. No self could escape. And now at last he realized that escape
was not desirable. For he had seen something of the beauty for which
all selves, if they could but see it, would suffer gladly, and gladly
be annihilated.</p>

<p>Paul now once more turned his attention to the world that it was his
task to observe. Suddenly a truth, which he had long vaguely known, but
had never before clearly stated to himself, became both clear and
urgent. At last he saw the situation of his species unambiguously from
the cosmical point of view. He saw what it was that he and his
contemporaries should be doing with their world. Fate had given them an
opportunity which had been withheld from every early age. They had
stumbled on the power of controlling the destiny of the human race.
They had already gained some mastery over physical nature, and a far
greater mastery was seemingly in store for them. Already their world
had become one world, as it had never been before. Moreover, they must
some day learn how to remake human nature itself, for good or for ill.
If they could begin to outgrow their limitations of will, if they could
feel beyond their self-regard, their tribal jealousies and their
constant puerile obsessions, then they could begin not only to
construct a Utopia of happy individuals, but to make of their planet a
single and most potent instrument of the spirit, capable of music
hitherto unconceived.</p>

<p>What humanity should do with itself in the far future, no one could
tell; but one conviction now stood out with certainty in Paul's mind,
namely, that over all the trivial and inconsistent purposes that kept
the tribes of men in conflict with one another, there was one purpose
which should be the supreme and inviolate purpose of all men today,
namely, to evoke in every extant human being the fullest possible
aliveness, and to enable all men to work; together harmoniously for the
making of a nobler, a more alive human nature.</p>

<p>Some such purpose as this was obscurely dawning in many minds
throughout the Western and even the Eastern world. But though they were
many, they were a minute proportion of the whole; and their vision was
unclear, their will unsure. Opposed to them were many violent powers,
and the dead-weight of custom, not only in the world but in themselves
also. What chance was there that these few groping minds would wrench
the great world into a new way of living? Paul now with eager interest,
nay with passion, with awe, with grim zest, took up his task of
watching and assessing the intense little drama of your age.</p>

<p>Lest he should lose sight of the wider bearings of that drama, Paul
first meditated on the cosmical significance of human endeavour, which
now for the first time was beginning to be tentatively apprehended by
man himself. The immediate outcome of his meditation was this poem:</p>

<pre>
Is man a disease
that the blood of a senile star
cannot resist?
And when the constellations regard us.
is it fear, disgust, horror.
(at a plague-stricken brother
derelict from beauty).
that stares yonder
so sharply?
Gas the stars are.
They regard us not.
they judge us not.
they care for nothing.
We are alone in the hollow sky.
Then ours, though out of reach, those trinkets.
withheld.
unspoiled;
ours the sleeping and uncommanded genii
of those old lamps;
ours by right of mentality;
by right of agony.
by right of long heart-searching.
by right of all we must do with them
when our day comes.
when we have outlived our childishness.
when we have outgrown
the recurrent insanity of senility.
Then surely at last man.
and not bickering monkeys.
shall occupy the universe.
</pre>

<h3>ii. THE RESEARCH</h3>

<p>Paul now devoted all his leisure to his great exploration. He began
tentatively, by reading much modern literature, and talking politics
and philosophy with his friends. Both these occupations were of course
familiar to him; but whereas formerly they had been pursued in the
spirit of the tourist, a rather bewildered tourist, now they were
carried out with passion and an assurance which to Paul himself seemed
miraculous. This beginning led him on to make a careful study of the
mentality of the whole teaching profession, both in schools and
universities; and this in turn developed into a wide and profound
research into all manner of mental types and occupations from
road-menders to cabinet ministers. With my constant help, and to his
own surprise, the silent and retiring young schoolmaster, who had
always been so painfully conscious of the barrier between himself and
his kind, began actively to seek out whatever contacts promised to be
significant for his task. With amazement he discovered in himself a
talent for devising inoffensive methods of making acquaintance with all
sorts of persons whom he needed for his collection. Indeed, he pursued
his work very much in the spirit of a collector in love with his
specimens, and eager to discover by wealth of instances the laws of
their being. If one day he happened to conceive that such and such a
well-known personage or humble neighbour could give him light, he would
be tormented by a violent, almost sexual, craving to meet the chosen
one, and would leave no stone unturned until he had achieved his
end.</p>

<p>Under my influence he also developed a captivating power of social
intercourse, which, however, would only come into action in special
circumstances. In the ordinary trivial social occasions he remained as
a rule clumsy, diffident and tiresome; but in any situation which was
relevant to his task, he seemed to come alive, to be a different
person, and one that he thoroughly delighted to be. It was not merely
that he discovered a gift of conversation. Sometimes he would say
almost nothing. But what he did say would have a startling effect on
his hearer, drawing him out, compelling him to get a clear view of his
own work and aims, forcing him to unburden himself in a confession,
such that at the close of it he would perhaps declare, 'Yes, that is
really how I face the world, though till today I hardly thought of it
that way.' Sometimes, however, Paul himself would be almost voluble,
commenting with a strangely modest assurance on the other's function;
Often he would find himself assuming for the occasion an appropriate
personality, a mask peculiarly suited to appear intelligent and
sympathetic to this particular man or woman. Paul was sometimes shocked
at the insincerity of this histrionic behaviour; though he pursued it,
for the sake of its extraordinary effectiveness. And indeed it was not
really insincere, for it was but the natural result of his new and
intense imaginative insight into other minds. Sometimes when he was in
the presence of two very different individuals whom he had previously
encountered apart, he would be hard put to it to assume for each the
right mask without rousing the other's indignation. Thus, to give a
rather crude example of this kind of predicament, having on Monday won
the confidence of a member of the Communist Party, and on Tuesday the
benevolence of a British Patriot, he happened on Wednesday to come upon
them both together in violent altercation. Both at first greeted him as
an ally, but before he fled he had been reviled by each in turn.</p>

<p>One curious limitation of Paul's talent he found very distressing.
Brilliant as he was at evoking in others a clearer consciousness of
their own deeper thoughts and desires, he was incapable of impressing
them with his own ideas. Strong in his own recent spiritual
experiences, and in his increasing grasp of the contemporary world, he
yet failed completely to express himself on these subjects. This was
but natural, for he was no genius, still less a prophet; and, save in
the office in which I needed him and inspired him, he remained
inarticulate. This incapacity disturbed him increasingly as the months
and years passed. For increasingly he became convinced that the modern
world was heading toward a huge disaster, and that nothing could save
it but the awakening of the mass of men into a new mood and greater
insight. More and more clearly he saw in his own meditations just what
this awakening must be. Yet he could never make it clear to others, for
as soon as he tried to express himself, he fell stammering or mute. The
trouble lay partly in his incompetence, but partly also in the fact
that through my help he had seen both sides of a truth which to his
fellows was almost never revealed thus in the solid. Paul's
interlocutor, therefore, was sure to be blind either to one or to the
other aspect of Paul's central conviction; either to his sense of
obligation in the heroic and cosmically urgent enterprise of man upon
his planet, or to his seemingly inconsistent perception of the
finished, the inhuman, beauty of the cosmos.</p>

<p>Most painfully when he was with members of the 'intelligentsia' did
his mental paralysis seize him. He made contact with many writers and
artists. Each of these brilliant beings he treated at first with
doglike respect, believing that at last he had come into the presence
of one who had broken into new truth. But somehow he never went very
far with any of them. For a while he delighted them, because he
stimulated them to apprehend their own vision with a new clarity. But
since their visions were not as a rule very profound, they and he soon
saw all there was to see in them. At this point Paul's talent
invariably disappeared, and henceforth they thought him dull,
bourgeois, not worth knowing. He could no longer hold their attention.
He had not the necessary flow of personal tittle-tattle to carry him
through when deeper interests flagged. On the other hand, if ever he
dared to tell them his own views, he merely made a fool of himself, and
was treated either with kindly ridicule or with inattention. Thus,
though he came to know his way about the intellectual life of London,
he was never taken into any circle or school. Most circles had at one
time or other tolerated him on their fringes; yet he remained unknown,
for no one ever bothered to mention him to anyone else. Thus it
happened that he was always apart, always able to look on without
pledging his faith to any creed, his intellect to any theory. Every
creed, every theory, he secretly tested and sooner or later rejected in
the light of his own recent illumination. In this manner Paul served my
purpose admirably. As a tissue-section, to be studied under the
microscope, may be stained to bring out details of structure that would
otherwise have remained invisible, so Paul, whom I had treated with a
tincture of Neptunian vision, revealed in exquisite detail the
primitive organs of his mind, some of which took the stain and others
not. Obviously it is impossible to reveal the whole issue of the
experiment to readers of this book, since they themselves suffer from
Paul's limitations.</p>

<p>Throughout these crowded years Paul still carried on his daily work
at the school, though inevitably as his attention became more and more
occupied, his teaching suffered. All his free time, all his holidays,
he now spent on his task of exploration. It was a strange life, so rich
in human intercourse, and yet so lonely; for he dared not tell anyone
of the real purpose of his activities, of their Neptunian aspect, lest
he should bethought insane. To his friends he appeared to have been
bitten by some queer bug of curiosity, which, they said, had filled him
with a quite aimless mania for inquiry, and was ruining his work.</p>

<p>To aid his project he undertook a number of enterprises, none of
which he did well, since at heart he regarded them only as means of the
pursuit of his secret purpose. He worked for a political party,
lectured to classes organized by the Workers' Educational Association,
collaborated in a social survey of a poor district. Also he haunted
certain public-houses, attended revivalist meetings, became intimate
with burglars, swindlers, and one or two uncaught murderers, who, he
found, were extremely thankful for the opportunity of unburdening
themselves under the spell of his mysteriously aloof sympathy and
understanding. He made contact with many prostitutes and keepers of
brothels. He respectfully explored the minds of homosexuals, and others
whose hungers did not conform to the lusts of their fellows. He found
his way into many chambers of suffering, and was present at many
death-beds. He was welcomed in mining villages, and in slum tenements.
He discussed revolution in the homes of artisans. Equally he was
received in the houses of bank managers, of ship-owners, of great
industrial employers. He conferred with bishops, and also with the
dignitaries of science, but no less eagerly with vagabonds; over stolen
delicacies, seated behind hedges. Part of one summer he spent as a dock
labourer, and part of another as a harvest hand in the West of England.
He travelled steerage on an emigrant ship, and worked his passage on a
tramp steamer along the Baltic coasts. He made a brief but crowded
pilgrimage to Russia, and came home a Communist, with a difference. He
tramped and bicycled in Western Europe; and in England he made contact
with many visitors from the East. Yet also he found time to keep
abreast of contemporary literature, to haunt studios, to discuss
epistemology and ethics with bright young Cambridge philosophers.</p>

<p>In all this work he found that he was constantly and sometimes
sternly guided by an inner power, which, though I never again openly
communicated with him, he knew to spring from me. Thus he was endowed
with an infallible gift of selection and of detective inquiry. Through
my help he covered in a few years the whole field of modern life, yet
he never wasted his strength on vain explorations. With the precision
of a hawk he descended upon the significant individual, the significant
movement; and with a hawk's assurance he neglected the irrelevant.
Sometimes his own impulses would run counter to my guidance. Then he
would find himself directed by a mysterious, an inner and hypnotic,
impulsion, either to give up what he had planned to do, or to embark on
some adventure for which his own nature had no inclination.</p>

<p>Month by month, year by year, there took shape in Paul's mind a new
and lucid image of his world, an image at once terrible and exquisite,
tragic and farcical. It is difficult to give an idea of this new vision
of Paul's, for its power depended largely on the immense intricacy and
diversity of his recent experience; on his sense of the hosts of
individuals swarming upon the planet, here sparsely scattered, there
congested into great clusters and lumps of humanity, here
machine-ridden, there ground into the earth from which they sucked
their scanty livelihood. Speaking in ten thousand mutually
incomprehensible dialects, living in manners reprehensible or ludicrous
to one another, thinking by concepts unintelligible to one another,
they worshipped in modes repugnant to one another. This new sense of
the mere bulk and variety of men was deepened in Paul's mind by his
enhanced apprehension of individuality in himself and others, his awed
realization that each single unit in all these earth-devastating locust
armies carried about with it a whole cognized universe, was the
plangent instrument of an intense and self-important theme of mind. For
Paul had by now learned very thoroughly to perceive the reality of all
human beings and of the world with that penetrating insight which I had
first elicited from him in childhood. On the other hand, since he was
never wholly forgetful of the stars, the shock between his sense of
human littleness in the cosmos and his new sense of man's physical bulk
and spiritual intensity increased his wonder. Thus in spite of his
perception of the indefeasible reality of everyday things, he had also
an overwhelming conviction that the whole fabric of common experience,
nay the whole agreed universe of human and biological and astronomical
fact, though real, concealed some vaster reality.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that throughout his exploration Paul was
jealously mindful of my presence within him, and that his sense of an
ulterior, a concealed, reality, was derived partly from the knowledge
that within himself, or above himself, there was concealed a more
exalted being. He knew that I was ever behind his eyes, ever attentive
in his ears, ever pondering and sifting the currents of his brain. Yet,
save when I swayed him with unaccountable cravings and reluctances, my
presence was wholly unperceived.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that I used Paul in two manners, both as a
transparent instrument of observation, and as a sample of your
mentality. I was interested not only in the external facts which he
recorded, but in his reaction to them, in the contrast between his
appraisement of them and my own. That contrast I may express by saying
that whereas I myself regarded the Terrestrial sphere primarily with
detachment, though with detachment which held within itself a passion
of imaginative sympathy, Paul regarded all things primarily from the
human point of view, though he was able also by a continuous effort to
maintain himself upon the loftier plane. For me it was a triumph of
imagination that I could enter so fully into your remote and fantastic
world. For Paul it was a triumph that in spite of his fervent humanity,
his compassion and indignation, he could now regard his world with
celestial aloofness. Thus the two of us together were like two
different musical instruments playing against one another in two
different tempos to produce a single intricacy of rhythm.</p>

<p>To the Neptunian intelligence, however, there was a slightly
nauseating pathos even in Paul's most chastened enthusiasm. Only
through the secret and ironical influence of my presence within him
could he avoid taking the fate of his world too much to heart. The mind
that has but lately received a commanding revelation which exalts it
above the pettiness of daily life is very prone to a certain
extravagance, a certain farcical pomp, in its devotion. The Neptunian
mind, on the other hand, born into the faith and needing no sententious
conversion, was sometimes impelled by Paul's solemnity to wonder
whether even the final tragedy of man on Neptune called most for grief
or for laughter.</p>

<h3>iii. FRUITS OF THE RESEARCH</h3>

<p>Paul had already made it clear in his own mind what the human aim
should be. Man should be striving into ever-increasing richness of
personality. He should be preparing his planet and his many races of
persons to embody the great theme of spirit which was as yet so dimly,
so reluctantly, conceived. In fact man should be preparing to fulfil
his office as a centre in which the cosmos might rejoice in itself, and
whence it might exfoliate into ever more brilliant being. Paul found
also in his heart a conviction, calm, though humanly reluctant, that in
the end must come downfall; and that though man must strive with all
his strength and constancy of purpose, he must yet continually create
in his heart the peace, the acceptance, the cold bright star of
cognizance which if we name it we misname.</p>

<p>In his exploration Paul sought to discover what progress man was
making in this twofold venture. He found a world in which, far from
perceiving the cosmical aspect of humanity, men were for the most part
insensitive even to the purely human aspect, the need to make a world
of full-blown and joyful human individuals. Men lived together in close
proximity, yet with scarcely more knowledge of one another than jungle
trees, which blindly jostle and choke, each striving only to raise its
head above its neighbours. Beings with so little perception of their
fellows had but a vague apprehension of the human forest as a whole,
and almost none of its potentialities. Some confused and dreamlike
awareness of man's cosmical function no doubt there was. As a very
faint breeze, it spread among the waiting tree-tops. But what was to
come of it?</p>

<p>In such a world there was one kind of work which seemed to Paul, not
indeed the most important, for many operations were equally important,
but the most directly productive work of all, namely, education. Among
the teachers, as in all walks of life, Paul found that, though some
were indeed pioneers of the new world-order, many were almost entirely
blind to the deeper meaning of their task. Even those few who had eyes
to see could do but little. Their pupils had at all costs to be fitted
for life in a world careless of the spirit, careless of the true ends
of living, and thoughtful only for the means. They must be equipped for
the economic struggle. They must become good business men, good
engineers and chemists, good typists and secretaries, good
husband-catchers, even if the process prevented them irrevocably from
becoming fully alive human beings. And so the population of the Western
world was made up for the most part of strange thwarted creatures,
skilled in this or that economic activity, but blind to the hope and
the plight of the human race. For them the sum of duty was to play the
economic game shrewdly and according to rule, to keep their wives in
comfort and respectability, their husbands well fed and contented, to
make their offspring into quick and relentless little gladiators for
the arena of world-prices. One and all they ignored that the arena was
not merely the market or the stock exchange, but the sand-multitudinous
waste of stars.</p>

<p>Of the innumerable constructors, the engineers, architects,
chemists, many were using their powers merely for gladiatorial victory.
Even those who were sincere workers had but the vaguest notion of their
function in the world. For them it was enough to serve faithfully some
imposing individual, some firm, or at best some national State. They
conceived the goal of corporate human endeavour in terms of comfort,
efficiency, and power, in terms of manufactures, oil, electricity,
sewage disposal, town-planning, aeroplanes and big guns. When they were
not at work, they killed time by motor-touring, the cinema, games,
domesticity or sexual adventures. Now and then they registered a
political vote, without having any serious knowledge of the matters at
stake. Yet within the limits of their own work they truly lived; their
creative minds were zestfully obedient to the laws of the materials in
which they worked, to the strength and elasticity of metals, the forms
of cantilevers, the affinities of atoms.</p>

<p>Of much the same mentality, though dealing with a different
material, were the doctors and surgeons; for whom men and women were
precariously adjusted machines, walking bags of intestines, boxes of
telephone nerves, chemical factories liable to go wrong at any minute,
fields for exploration and fee-making, possible seats of pain, the
great evil, and of death, which, though often preferable, was never to
be encouraged. They were familiar equally with death, and birth,
conception and contraception, and all the basic agonies and pities.
They protected themselves against the intolerable dead-weight of human
suffering, sometimes by callousness of imagination, sometimes by drink
or sport or private felicity, sometimes by myths of compensation in
eternity. A few faced the bleak truth unflinchingly yet also with
unquenched compassion. But nearly all, though loyal to the militant
life in human bodies, were too hard pressed to be familiar with the
uncouth exploratory ventures of human minds. And so, through very
loyalty to life, they were for the most part blind to the other, the
supernal, beauty.</p>

<p>Even more insulated, those very different servants of human
vitality, the agriculturists, whose minds were fashioned to the soil
they worked on, lived richly within the limits of their work, yet were
but obscurely, delusively, conscious of the world beyond their acres.
In the straightness of their furrows, and the fullness of their crops,
in their sleek bulls and stallions, they knew the joy of the maker; and
they knew beauty. But what else had they? They had to thrust and heave
from morning till night. They had to feed their beasts. Brooding over
their crops, dreading floods and droughts, they had not time for the
world. Yet they enviously despised the town-dwellers. They censured all
newfangled ways, they condescended to teach their sons the lore of
their grandfathers, and they guarded their daughters as prize heifers.
They put on black clothes for chapel, to pray for good weather. They
believed themselves the essential roots of the State. They measured
national greatness in terms of wheat and yeoman muscle. The younger
ones, town-infected with their motor-bicycles, their wireless, their
artificial silks, their political views, their new-fangled morals,
revolted against enslavement to the soil. Both young and old alike were
vaguely unquiet, disorientated, sensing even in their fields the
futility of existence.</p>

<p>Most typical of your isolation from one another were the seamen,
who, imprisoned nine parts of their lives in a heaving box of steel,
looked out complainingly upon a world of oceans and coasts. They
despised the landsmen, but they were ever in search of a shore job.
Monastic, by turns celibate and polygamous, they were childlike in
their unworldly innocence, brutelike in their mental blindness, godlike
(to Paul's estimation) in their patience and courage. They loved the
flag as no landsman could love it. They were exclusively British (or
German or what not) but loyal also to the universal brotherhood of the
sea (or disloyal), and faithful to the owners (or unfaithful). Day
after day they toiled, shirked, slandered, threatened one another with
knives; but in face of the typhoon they could discover amongst
themselves a deep, an inviolable communion. They measured all persons
by seamanship, crew-discipline, and all things by seaworthiness and
ship-shapeliness. They took the stars for signposts and timepieces, and
on Sundays for the lamps of angels. Contemptuous of democracy, innocent
of communism, careless of evolution, they ignored that the liquid
beneath their keels was but a film between the solid earth and the
void, but a passing phenomenon between the volcanic confusion of
yesterday and the all-gripping ice-fields of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Seemingly very different, yet at bottom the same, was the case of
the industrial workers of all occupations and ranks, whose dreams
echoed with the roar of machinery. For the mass of them, work was but a
slavery, and the height of bliss was to be well paid in idleness. They
loudly despised the wealthy, yet in their hearts they desired only to
mimic them, to display expensive pleasures, to have powers of swift
locomotion. What else could they look for, with their stunted minds?
Many were unemployed, and spiritually dying of mere futility. Some,
dole-shamed, fought for self-esteem, cursing the world that had no use
for them; others, dole-contented, were eager to plunder the society
that had outlawed them. But many there were among the industrial
workers who waited only to be wrought and disciplined to become the
storm troops of a new order. Many there were who earnestly willed to
make a new world and not merely to destroy an old one. But what world?
Who could seize this half-fashioned instrument, temper it, and use it?
Who had both the courage and the cunning to do so? Seemingly only those
who had been themselves so tempered and hardened by persecution that
they could not conceive any final beatitude for man beyond
regimentation in a proletarian or a fascist State.</p>

<p>Certainly the politicians could never seize that weapon. They
climbed by their tongues; and when they reached the tree-top, they
could do nothing but chatter like squirrels, while the storm cracked
the branches, and the roots parted.</p>

<p>The journalists? Was it they who could fertilize the waiting seed of
the new world? Little seekers after copy, they made their living by the
sale of habit-forming drugs. They had their loyalties, like the rest of
men; but they trusted that in preserving the tradition of the Press, or
in serving some great journal, they served well enough. They ignored
that in the main their journals spread poison, lies, the mentality of
society's baser parts. They made sex obscene, war noble, and patriotism
the height of virtue. A few there were of another kind, who sought to
bring to light what the authorities would keep dark, whose aim it was
to make men think by offering them sugared pills of wisdom, spiced
problems of state-craft, peepshows of remote lands and lives, glimpses
of the whole of things. They were indeed possible trumpeters of a new
order, though not world-builders. But they were few and hobbled, for at
every turn they must please or go under. And the thought which they so
devotedly spread was of necessity over-simplified and vulgarized, to
suit the spirit of the times.</p>

<p>The civil servants, could they remake the world? Wrought and
tempered to a great tradition of loyalty, they were devoted only to the
smooth-running and just-functioning and minor improvement of the social
machine.</p>

<p>The social workers, so formidable with eye-witnessed facts, so
indignant with the machine, so kindly-firm with 'cases', so loyal to
the social gospel, and to the fulfilling of personality, so
contemptuous of cosmical irrelevances, and morally outraged by those
who, even in a foundering world, have an eye for beauty! They had their
part to play, but they were repairers, physicians, not procreators of a
new world.</p>

<p>The religious folk, who should have been society's red
blood-corpuscles, transfusing their spiritual treasure into all its
tissues, had settled down to become a huge proliferating parasite.
Mostly of the middle class, they projected their business interests
into another world by regular payments of premiums on an eternal-life
assurance policy; or they compensated for this world's unkindness by
conceiving themselves each as the sole beloved in the arms of Jesus, or
at least as a life member in the very select celestial club. But some,
teased by a half-seen vision, by a conviction of majesty, of beauty
they knew not whereabouts nor of what kind, were persuaded to explain
their bewildered ecstasy by ancient myths and fantasies. For the sake
of their bright, featureless, guiding star, they believed what was no
longer credible and desired what it was now base to desire.</p>

<p>The scientists, so pious toward physical facts, so arch-priestly to
their fellow-men, were indeed a noble army of miners after truths; but
they were imprisoned in deep galleries, isolated even from each other
in their thousand saps. Daily they opened up new veins of the precious
metal; and sent the bright ingots aloft, to be mortised into the golden
temple of knowledge, with its great thronged halls of physics,
astronomy and chemistry, biology and psychology; or to be put to
commercial use, whether for the increase of happiness, or for killing,
or for spiritual debasement, or to be instrumental in one way or
another to the achievement of pure cognizance. Two kinds of scientists
Paul found. Some were but eyeless cave-reptiles, or moles who came
reluctantly into the upper world, nosing across men's path, concealing
their bewilderment under dust-clouds of pronouncements. Some, though
innocent of philosophy, ventured to set up metaphysical edifices, in
which they repeated all the structural defects of the old systems, or
were sent toppling by the dizzying of their own unschooled desires,
whether for the supremacy of mind, or for the immortality of the
individual. The public, tricked by the same unschooled desires,
applauded their acrobatic feats, and was blind to their disaster.
Others, more cautious, knew that all scientific knowledge was of
numbers only, yet that with the incantation of numbers new worlds might
be made. They were preparing to take charge of mankind, to make the
planet into a single well-planned estate, and to re-orientate human
nature. But what kind of a world would they desire to make, whose
knowledge was only of numbers?</p>

<p>But the philosophers themselves were scarcely more helpful. Some
still hoped to reach up to reality (which the scientists had missed) by
tiptoeing on a precarious scaffold of words. Others, preening their
intellectual consciences, abjured all such adventures. They were
content merely to melt down and remodel the truth ingots of the
scientists, and to build them together upon the high, the
ever-unfinished tower of the golden temple; Some were so in love with
particularity that they ignored the universal, others so impressed by
the unity of all things that they overlooked discreteness. Yet
doubtless by exchange of findings and by mutual devastation they were
year by year approaching, corporately, irresistibly, but
asymptotically, toward a central truth; which lay ever at hand, yet
infinitely remote, because eternally beyond the comprehension of
half-human minds. For, like their fellows, the philosophers of the
species had a blind spot in the centre of the mind's vision, so that
what they looked at directly they could never see. Like archaeologists
who lovingly study and classify the script of a forgotten language but
have found no key to its meaning, the philosophers were wise chiefly in
knowing that whoever claims to interpret the rigmarole of half-human
experience is either a fool or a charlatan.</p>

<p>There were the artists, despisers of the mere analytical
intelligence. What hope lay with them? Microcosmic creators, for whom
love and hate and life itself were but the matter of art, in their view
the whole meaning of human existence seemed to lie solely in the
apprehension of forms intrinsically 'significant', and in the
embodiment of visions without irrelevance. Athletes of the spirit, by
the very intensity of their single aesthetic achievement they were
prone to cut themselves off from the still-living, though desperately
imperilled world.</p>

<p>There were others, artists and half-artists, who were leaders of
thought in Paul's day, publicists, novelists, playwrights, even poets.
Some still preached the Utopia of individuals, the private man's heaven
on earth, ignorant that this ideal had lost its spell, that it must be
sought not as an end but as a means, that it must borrow fervour from
some deeper fire. Some affirmed, pontifically or with the licence of a
jester, that all human endeavour expresses unwittingly the urge of some
cryptic, evolving, deity, which tries out this and that organic form,
this and that human purpose, in pursuit of an end hidden even from
itself. Some, ridiculing all superstition, declared existence to be
nothing but electrons, protons, ethereal undulations, and
superstitiously asserted that cognisance, passion and will are
identical with certain electrical disturbances in nerve fibres or
muscles. Some, zestfully proclaiming the futility of the cosmos and the
impotence of man, cherished their own calm or heroic emotions, and
deployed their cloak of fortitude and flowing rhetoric, mannequins even
on the steps of the scaffold. Some, whose sole care was to avoid the
taunt of credulity, and the taunt of emotionalism, fastidiously,
elegantly, shook off from their fingers the dust of belief, the
uncleanness of enthusiasm. Some, because reason (jockeyed and
overpressed by so many riders) had failed to take her fences, condemned
her as a jade fit only for the knackers; and led out in her stead a
dark horse, a gift horse whose mouth must not be inspected, a wooden
horse, bellyful of trouble. Some, gleefully discovering that the hated
righteousness of their fathers drew its fervour from disreputable and
unacknowledged cravings, preached therefore that primeval lusts alone
directed all human activities. Some, because their puritan mothers
dared not receive the revelation of the senses, themselves wallowed in
the sacred wine till their minds drowned. Some were so tangled in the
love of mother, and the discord of mother and mate, that they received
from woman not nourishment, not strength, but a sweet and torturing
poison, without which they could not live, by which their minds were
corroded. Some, exquisitely discriminating the myriad flavours and
perfumes of experience, cared only to refine the palate to the
precision of a wine-taster; but registered all their subtle
apprehensions with a desolate or with a defiant conviction of futility,
a sense of some huge omission in the nature of things or in man's
percipience. Some cognized their modern world but as flotsam gyrating
on the cosmical flux, a film or ordure in which men and women swam
spluttering, among disintegrated cigarette-ends, clattering cans,
banana skins, toffee papers, and other disused sheathings. For them
filth was the more excruciating by reason of their intuitions of purity
violated, of austerity desecrated. Others there were, no less
excruciated, who nevertheless by natatory prowess reached the mud-flats
of old doctrine, whereat last they thankfully reclined, 'wrapped in the
old miasmal mist', and surrounded by the rising tide.</p>

<p>What was the upshot of Paul's whole exploration? For me there issued
in my own mind the pure, the delighted cognizance, both of Paul's world
and of Paul himself, the appraising organ that I had chosen. For Paul
the upshot was a sense of horror and of exaltation, a sense that he was
participating in a torrent of momentous happenings whose final issue he
could but vaguely guess, but whose immediate direction was toward
ruin.</p>

<p>He saw clearly that man, the most successful of all Terrestrial
animals, who had mastered all rivals and taken the whole planet as his
hunting-ground, could not master himself, could not even decide what to
do with himself. All over the West man was visibly in decline. The
great wave of European energy, which gave him mastery over nature,
which carried the European peoples into every continent, which lent
them for a while unprecedented intellectual vision and moral
sensitivity, now visibly failed. And what had come of it? The Black
Country and its counterpart in all Western lands, mechanized life,
rival imperialisms, aerial bombardment, poison gas; for the mind, a
deep and deadly self-disgust, a numbing and unacknowledged shame, a
sense of huge opportunities missed, of a unique trust betrayed, and
therewith a vast resentment against earlier generations, against human
nature, against fate, against the universe. What more? An attempt to
cover up guilt and futility by mechanical triumphs, business hustle,
and the sound of a hundred million gramophones and radio-sets.</p>

<p>Paul asked himself 'How has all this happened?' And he answered,
'Because we cannot look into our minds and see what really affords
lasting satisfaction, and what is merely reputed to do so; because our
individuality is a dimensionless point, because our personalities are
but masks with nothing behind them. But in the East, where they say man
is less superficial, what is happening? There, presumably, men have
seen truths which the West has missed, But they stared at their truths
till they fell into a hypnotic trance which lasted for centuries. They
made it an excuse for shunning the world and all its claims, for
gratifying themselves in private beatitude. And now, when at the hands
of the West the world is forced on them irresistibly, they fall into
the very same errors that they condemn in us. And the Russians?
Socially they are the hope of the world. But have they as individual
beings any more reality, any more percipience, than the rest of
us?'</p>

<p>Over this despair, this disgust of human futility, Paul triumphed by
taking both a longer and a wider view.</p>

<p>'We shall win through,' he told himself. 'We must. Little by little,
year by year, aeon by aeon, and in spite of long dark ages, man will
master himself, will gain deeper insight, will make a better world. And
if not man, then surely some other will in the end fulfil his office as
the cosmical eye and heart and hand. If in our little moment he is in
regression, what matter? The great music must not always be triumphant
music. There are other songs beside the songs of victory. And all songs
must find their singers.'</p>

<p>Shortly after the final meditation in which he summed up the whole
issue of his inquiry, Paul wrote a poem in which he made it clear to
himself, though with a certain bitterness, that he cared more for the
music which is spirit than for the human or any other instrument. In
the final couplet there appears the self-conscious disillusionment
which is characteristic of your age.</p>

<pre>
If man encounter

If mind more able.

noose this colt and break him
to be a beast of draught and burden

<h3>iv. PAUL SETTLES DOWN</h3>

<p>Paul had by now almost fulfilled the task that I had demanded of
him. Not only had he collected for me an immense store of facts about
the crisis of his species, facts the significance of which he himself
often entirely failed to see, but also in his own experience he had
already afforded me a very precise insight into the capacity of his
kind. He had shown me, through years of inner turmoil, the aspirations
and reluctances of a primitive being haunted by visions from a higher
sphere. In particular he had shown me the limits of your intelligence
and of your will. There were innumerable problems which Paul even with
my patient help could never understand. There were austerities of
beauty which even with my most earnest illumination he could not
admire. But one test at least Paul had triumphantly passed. He had
shown that it was possible for the average mentality of the First Men,
under careful tuition, to apprehend without any doubt whatever the two
supreme and seemingly discordant offices of the individual mind,
namely, loyalty to man and worship of fate. To the Last Men these
offices are displayed as organic to one another; but to the First Men,
they are for ever discrepant. Paul's intellect at least saw this
discrepancy, and refused to be put off with false solutions of the
problem. For the rest though he so clearly recognized that all human
purposes should be subordinated to these two supreme ends, he himself,
like the rest of his kind, was but a frail vessel.</p>

<p>Since I had no further use for Paul as a visual and auditory
instrument through which to examine your world, I now ceased to trouble
him with the insatiable lust of inquiry which had mastered him since
the conclusion of the war. Hitherto he had pursued his task
indefatigably, but now his energy began to flag. This was due partly to
the withdrawal of my stimulation, partly to the fact that his
uncapacious brain was already charged to the full and could bear no
more, partly also to the long physical strain of the double life which
he had led. For Paul had indeed been wearing himself out. Katherine,
with whom he still spent an occasional week, had declared that he was
withering before his time, that his arms and legs were sticks and his
ribs an old rat-trap. Privately she had noted also that his embraces
had lost their vigour. She had urged him to 'take things easy for a
while'. And now at last he discovered that he had in fact neither the
energy nor the inclination to pursue the old racketing way of life.</p>

<p>I made it clear to him that I required no more work of him, but that
I should continue to be with him to observe the movements of his mind
during his normal career. For, though I had no further use for him as
an exploratory instrument, it was my intention to watch the way in
which his Neptunian tincture would influence him in middle age and
senility. At this juncture Paul displayed rather interestingly the
weakness of his kind by futile rebellion, and an attempt to pursue a
heroic career for which he was unsuited. I must not dwell upon this
incident, but it may be briefly recorded for the light which it throws
upon your nature. He had already, it will be remembered, become
convinced that his race was heading for a huge disaster, from which
nothing could save it but an impossible change of heart, of native
capacity. In spite of the current 'world-economic crisis', he had no
serious expectation of a sudden catastrophe; but he had come to believe
in a long-drawn-out spiritual decline, masked by a revival of material
prosperity. He looked forward to centuries, perhaps millennia, of
stagnation, in which the half-awakened mind of man would have sunk back
once more into stupor. But he saw this phase as but a momentary episode
in the life of the planet. And he saw the little huge tragedy of the
modern world as, after all, acceptable, a feature of cosmical beauty.
He knew, moreover, not clearly but yet with conviction, that he himself
had played some small part in apprehending the drama of his age for the
cognizance of the mature and final human mind. He knew also that
without my continuous support he had no outstanding ability. Yet,
though fundamentally he had accepted all this, and was indeed
profoundly at peace, he could not express this acceptance and this
peace in conduct. He could not bring himself to participate in the
tragedy without making efforts to avert it, efforts which he knew must
be futile, because in the first place he himself was not made of the
stuff of prophets, and because in the second place the nature of his
species was inadequate. Though he knew it was so, an irrational fury of
partisanship now seized him. Instead of continuing the work which he
could do tolerably well, instead of striving by his school-teaching to
elicit in certain young minds an enhanced percipience and delight, he
must needs take it upon himself to become the prophet of a new social
and spiritual order.</p>

<p>It is no part of my purpose to tell in detail how Paul, after
earnestly seeking excuses for a project which he knew to be ridiculous,
gave up his post in the school; how he devoted himself to writing and
speaking, in fact to preaching the new truth that he supposed himself
to possess; how he tried to gather round him a group of collaborators,
whom secretly he regarded as disciples; how he made contact once more
with his old acquaintance the author of Last and First Men, hailed that
timid and comfort-loving creature as a fellow-prophet, and was hastily
dismissed for a lunatic; how, subsequently, his literary products
proved even to himself their inability to find their way into print,
and his efforts at vocal prophecy earned him the reputation of a crank
and a bore; how he tried to persuade the Communists that he knew their
mind better than they did themselves; how he was expelled from the
Communist Party as an incorrigible bourgeois; how the communistically
inclined editor of a well-known literary journal, who at first hoped to
bring Paul within his own circle, was soon very thankful to get rid of
him; how after several disorderly scenes in Hyde Park, Paul was
eventually marched off by the police, from whose care he finally
escaped only to take up his abode in the Lunatic Asylum near his
suburban home; how after some months of enforced meditation he was at
last released, thoroughly cured of his disease; how, finally, but not
until many far-reaching wires had been pulled in his interest, he was
re-established in his old school. These facts I record chiefly so that
I may also record another. Throughout this fantastic phase of his life,
Paul remained inwardly the calm, the compassionately amused spectator
of his own madness.</p>

<p>Of his subsequent career I need only say that within a year he had
settled himself firmly into harness once more, with the determination
never again to see the inside of a lunatic asylum. He became indeed an
admirable schoolmaster of the more advanced and sympathetic type, bent
upon reform, but cautious. In consequence of my influence during his
youth he was now able to earn a reputation for daring ideas, yet also
for patience, tact and extreme conscientiousness. In due season he
married, begat children, became a head master, and introduced
far-reaching novelties into his school, in respect of curriculum,
teaching methods, and dress. From the point of view of readers of this
book, the tense of this last sentence should have been future, for up
to the date of publication, Paul remains a bachelor, Nevertheless I
have already observed his future career, and can report that, when the
time comes for him to retire, he will look back on his work with
thankfulness and modest pride; that, having earlier determined to
commit suicide soon after his retirement, he will change his mind and
allow himself a year or two to re-assess his life and his world in the
mellow light of a peaceful old age; that during this period he will
afford me much further knowledge of the senescent phase of your
individuality, with its strange blend of wisdom and puerility, its
increased potentiality of insight, progressively thwarted by neural
decay; that when there is no further reason for him to remain alive,
Paul will no longer have the resolution to kill himself, and will be
trapped in the quagmire of senility.</p>

iv. EPILOGUE BY THE TERRESTRIAL AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK</blockquote>

<h3>i. SUBMERGED SUPERMEN</h3>

<p>I HAVE been describing a situation in which, had the intelligence
and the integrity of average men and women been slightly more robust,
your world might have passed almost at a leap from chaos to
organization, from incipient dissolution to a new order of vitality.
Many minds were clearly aware that they were puppets in a huge and
tragic farce, though none were able to put an end to it. I have now to
tell of a different and much less imposing pattern of events, which was
enacted in your midst without revealing its significance to any man. In
this case disaster was brought about, not by any lack of native
intelligence or of native integrity, but by the action of a savage
environment on minds too gifted for your world.</p>

<p>While our observers were watching the forlorn efforts of your
species to cope with problems beyond its powers, they detected also in
many regions of your planet the promise of a new and more human
species. The tragic fate of these more brilliant beings is amongst the
most remarkable incidents in the whole history of Man. Here it is
impossible to do more than outline this amazing story.</p>

<p>Throughout the career of your species, biological forces have now
and then thrown up individuals in whom there was some promise of a
higher type. Nearly always this promise was frustrated simply by the
physiological instability of the new mutation. The new brain forms were
associated either with actual distortions of body, or at best with
normal structures which were inadequate to bear the novel strain.
During the great ferment of industrial revolution in Europe and
America, these biological mutations became much more numerous. Thus was
afforded a serious possibility of the emergence somewhere or other of a
type which should combine superior mentality with a physique capable of
supporting the new cerebral organs.</p>

<p>When the earliest phase of industrialism was passed and conditions
had improved somewhat, it became less difficult for abnormal beings to
preserve themselves. The growth of humanitarianism, moreover, tended to
foster these crippled supernormals along with the subnormals for whom
they were invariably mistaken. Toward the end of the Nineteenth and the
beginning of the Twentieth Centuries, we found here and there in the
cities and industrial areas of the Western World, and later in
industrial Asia, many hundreds of these individuals. They were of
diverse biological constitution, but similar in respect of the factors
which, with good fortune, should produce supernormal intelligence and
supernormal integrity. Many of them, however, were tormented by gross
bodily malformation; some, though more or less like their fellows in
general anatomy, were no less hampered by biochemical maladjustments;
some, though otherwise normal, were crippled by excessive weight of
brain. But a few, sprung from stock of exceptionally tough fibre and
ample proportions, were able to support and nourish their not
excessively large heads without undue strain, at least in favourable
conditions.</p>

<p>Now it might have been expected that these individuals, potentially
far more brilliant than the most gifted of the normal kind, would have
risen very rapidly to positions of power; and that, at the same time,
they would have successfully established their type by propagation.
Within a few generations, surely, they would have completely dominated
the earlier and inferior species. But this was not to be. Even among
the very small minority who combined mental superiority with bodily
health, circumstance was fatally and ironically hostile. With regard to
propagation, to take the simpler matter first, most of these superior
beings, even those who were healthy and sexually potent, were strongly
repellent to normal members of the opposite sex. They did not conform
to any recognized pattern of sexual beauty. They were neither of the
classical nor of the negroid nor of the mongolian styles, which alone
were favoured by the 'cinema'. Indeed they were definitely grotesque.
Their heads, in most cases, looked too big for their bodies, and they
were apt to have bull necks. In many of them, moreover, there was a
disturbing uncouthness of facial expression, which to the normal eye
seemed sometimes insane, sometimes infantile, sometimes diabolic.
Consequently it was almost impossible for them to find mates.</p>

<p>More interesting to our observers was the failure of these
potentially superior beings to assert themselves in a world of
inferiors. Though they were biologically very diverse, springing in
fact from entirely independent mutations, these beings were alike in
one respect, namely their very prolonged childhood and adolescence. The
new and more complex brain organization could not develop successfully
unless it was associated with an abnormally slow rate of growth.
Therefore such of these beings as were able to survive were always
'backward' not only in appearance, but in some respects, mentally also.
Thus a boy of ten years would look like a child of six; and mentally,
though in some respects already more developed than his parents, he
would seem to them to be hopelessly incompetent. Judged by similar
standards, the normal human child would appear hopelessly backward in
comparison with the baby ape, although in reality he would be far more
intelligent and promising. Similarly, these superior children were
invariably considered by their parents and guardians as distressingly
inferior.</p>

<p>This backwardness of the new individual was due, not solely to the
slowness of physiological growth, but also to the fact that with more
delicate percipience he found in the experiences of childhood far more
to delight and intrigue him than the normal child could gather. These
beings remained so long in the phase of perceptual and motor
experimentation, and later so long in the phase of play, partly because
for them these fields were so crowded with interest. Similarly, when at
length they attained adolescence, the dawn of self-consciousness and
other-consciousness was for them so brilliant and overwhelming that
they had inevitably to take many years to adjust themselves to it.</p>

<p>So great was this seeming backwardness that they were often regarded
by their elders, and by their own generation also, not merely as
inferior, but as seriously deficient. Often they were actually treated
as insane. Thus in spite of their superiority they grew up with a
devastating sense of their own incapacity, which increased as they
became increasingly aware of the difference between themselves and
others. This illusion of inferiority was aggravated by their slow
sexual development; for at twenty they were sexually equivalent to a
normal child of thirteen. But, it may be asked, if these beings were
really so brilliant, how could they be so deceived about themselves?
The answer is given partly by their serious physiological backwardness,
but partly also by the overwhelming prestige of the inferior culture
into which they were born. At thirty they had still the immaturity of
the normal youth of eighteen; and finding a fundamental discrepancy
between their own way of thinking and the thought of the whole world,
they were forced to conclude that the world was right. It must be
remembered, moreover, that they were isolated individuals, that no one
of them would be likely ever to come across another of his kind.
Further, owing to the precarious balance of their vital economy, they
were all short-lived. Hardly any survived beyond forty-five, the age at
which they should have been upon the brink of mental maturity.</p>

<p>One characteristic of their childhood was, as I said, a seeming
backwardness of interest, which was taken to be a symptom of mental
limitation. Now with the passage of years this limitation seemed to
become more pronounced. At an age when the normal young man would be
dominated by the will to make his mark in the world by eclipsing his
fellows, these strange beings seemed quite incapable of 'taking
themselves seriously'. At school and college they could never be
induced to apply themselves resolutely to matters which concerned only
private advancement. While admitting that for the community's sake it
was necessary that individuals should' look after themselves', so as
not to be a burden, they could never be made to see the importance of
personal triumph over others in the great game of life, the great
gladiatorial display of personal prowess, which was ever the main
preoccupation of the First Men. Consequently they could never conjure
up the necessary forcefulness, the relentlessness, the singleminded
pushfulness which alone can advance a man. Their minds, it seemed, were
so limited that they could not form a really effective sentiment of
self-regard.</p>

<p>There were other respects in which the interest of these beings
seemed to be pitiably limited. Even those few who enjoyed physical
health and delighted in bodily activity, could never be persuaded to
concentrate their attention earnestly upon athletics, still less to
give up all their leisure to the pursuit of the ball. To the
football-playing and football-watching population these lonely beings
seemed almost criminally lax. Further, while enjoying occasionally the
spectacle of a horse race, they could raise no interest whatever in
betting. Blood sports they heartily loathed, yet without hate of those
who practised them; for they had no blood lust secretly at work within
themselves. They seemed also to be incapable of appreciating military
glory and national prestige. Though in some ways extremely social, they
could not pin their loyalty to one particular group rather than
another. Moral sensitivity, too, seemed either absent or so distorted
as to be unrecognizable. Not only did they break the sabbath without
shame, even in districts where sabbatarianism was unquestioned, but
also in respect of sex they were a source of grave offence; for they
seemed wholly incapable of feeling that sex was unclean. Both in word
and act they were shameless. Nothing but their sexual unattractiveness
restricted their licentious tendencies. Persuasion was entirely
ineffective, calling from them only a spate of arguments which, though
of course fantastic, were very difficult to refute. Compulsion alone
could restrain them; but unfortunately, though these beings were so
lacking in self-pride and personal rivalry, any attempt to prevent them
from behaving as seemed good to them was apt to call forth a fanatical
resistance, in pursuance of which they would readily suffer even the
extremes of agony without flinching. This capacity for diabolic heroism
was almost the only character that earned them any respect from their
fellows; but since it was generally used in service of ends which their
neighbours could not appreciate, respect was outweighed by ridicule or
indignation. Only when this heroism was exercised to succour some
suffering fellow-mortal could the normal mind fully appreciate it.
Sometimes they would perform acts of superb gallantry to rescue people
from fire, from drowning, from maltreatment. But on another occasion
the very individual who had formerly gone to almost certain death to
rescue a fellow-citizen or a child, might refuse even a slight risk
when some popular or important personage was in danger. The former hero
would scoff at all appeals, merely remarking that he was worth more
than the other, and must not risk his life for an inferior being.</p>

<p>Though capable of earnest devotion, these god-forsaken creatures
were thought to be too deficient to appreciate religion. In church they
showed no more percipience than a cat or dog. Attempts by parents and
guardians to make them feel the fundamental religious truths merely
puzzled or bored them. Yet Neptunian observers, stationed in these
sorely perplexed but sensitive young minds, found them often violently
disturbed and exalted by the two fundamental religious experiences,
namely by militant love of all living things and by the calm fervour of
resignation. Far more than the normal species, and in spite of their
own racked bodies, they were able to relish the spectacle of human
existence.</p>

<p>Most of them, both male and female, showed a very lively curiosity,
which in one or two cases was successfully directed towards a
scientific training. Generally, however, they made no headway at all in
science, because at the outset of their studies they could not see the
validity of the assumptions and method of the sciences. One or two of
them did, indeed, have the enterprise to go through with their
training, acquiring with remarkable ease an immense mass of facts,
arguments and theories. But they proved incapable of making use of
their knowledge. They seemed to regard all their scientific work as a
game that had little to do with reality, a rather childish game of
skill in which the arbitrary rules failed to develop the true spirit of
the game with rigorous consistency. Moreover, the further they explored
the corpus of any science, the more frivolously they regarded it, being
apparently unable to appreciate the subtleties of specialized technique
and theory. Not only in science, but in all intellectual spheres, they
were, in fact, constantly hampered by a lucidity of insight which
seemed to the normal mind merely obtuseness. In philosophy, for
instance, whither their natural curiosity often led them, they could
not make head or tail even of principles agreed upon or unconsciously
assumed by all schools alike. Their teachers were invariably forced to
condemn them as entirely without metaphysical sense; save in one
respect, for it was often noticed that they were capable of remarkable
insight into the errors of theories with which their teachers
themselves disagreed. The truth was that at the base of every
intellectual edifice these beings found assumptions which they could
not accept, or in which they could find no clear meaning; while
throughout the structure they encountered arguments in which they could
not see a logical connexion.</p>

<p>There was one sphere in which several of these beings did earnestly
try to make themselves felt, namely in politics and social improvement.
But here they were even more ineffective than elsewhere. They could
never see the importance of the accepted political aims or the validity
of the recognized party maxims. When politicians demonstrated the
inevitable results of this policy or that, these unhappy misfits could
only deplore their own stupidity in not being able to follow the
argument. When they themselves confessed how they would deal with some
problem or other, they were either cursed for their lack of true
feeling or derided for their childish idealism. In either case they
were charged with being ignorant of human nature; and this charge was,
in a manner, just, for they had seldom any conception of the gulf
between themselves and the members of the older species.</p>

<p>I have been speaking of those few who were educated so far as to be
able to take thought for matters of theoretical interest or public
concern. But the great majority never attained this level. Those who
were born into comfortable circumstances generally came into conflict
with the taboos of their society, and were ostracized; so that they
sank into the underworld. Those also who were born into poor families
were frequently outlawed by their fellows; and being entirely unfit to
make their way in the huge dog-fight of industrialism, they nearly
always subsided into the humblest occupations. They became
dock-labourers, charwomen, agricultural labourers, clerks of the lowest
order, very small shop-keepers, and especially vagrants. It was
remarkable that they received on the whole more sympathy and
understanding in the lower than in the higher reaches of society. This
was because in the simpler, less sophisticated, manner of life their
native intelligence and integrity did not come into obvious conflict
with the proud but crude culture of more 'educated' folk. Indeed, those
whose lot fell among the 'lower' classes of society were generally
treated by their peers with a strange blend of contempt and respect.
Though they were regarded as ineffective cranks or freaks, as children
whose development had somehow been arrested, as 'daft', 'fey',
'mental', they were also credited with an odd kind of impracticable
wisdom that was too good for this world. Not only so, but even in
practical matters their advice was often sought; for they seemed to
combine a divine innocence and self-disregard with a shrewdness, a
cunning, which, though it was never used for self-advancement, struck
the normal mind as diabolic.</p>

<p>The kind of life into which these abortive supermen gravitated most
frequently was a life of wandering and contemplation. Often they became
tramps, drifting from one big town to another, trekking through
agricultural districts, tinkering, sharpening scissors, mending
crockery, poaching, stealing, breaking stones, harvesting. A few became
postmen, others drivers of motor vans or buses; but though, whatever
their occupations, they worked with incredible efficiency, seldom could
they remain for long in posts which entailed subordination to members
of the normal species. The women were more unfortunate than the men,
for vagrancy was less easily practised by women. Some became
seamstresses. A few, protected by sexual unattractiveness, faced the
difficulties and dangers of the road. Others, blessed with more or less
normal looks, chose prostitution as the least repugnant way of earning
a livelihood.</p>

<p>Our observers, whenever they studied these unfulfilled
approximations to a new species, found invariably a mental pattern
definitely far superior to the normal, but also one which was much less
developed than that of the Second Men, whose career was destined to
begin some ten million years after your day. These superior
contemporaries of yours had indeed, for beings whose heads were not
much larger than your own, remarkable intelligence. They were
remarkable also in respect of the organization and unity of their
minds. Where the normal personality, torn by conflicts of desire and
loyalty, would split into two or more incomplete systems imperfectly
related to one another, these preserved their integrity, and chose that
action which did in fact offer the greatest good possible in the
circumstances. They were almost entirely without selfishness, for they
had a capacity for self-insight definitely more penetrating than that
of the normal species. Like the Second Men, they had also an innate
interest in the higher mental activities, a craving for intellectual
exercise and aesthetic delight no less imperious than the simple needs
for food and drink. But unfortunately, since they were isolated
individuals overwhelmed in childhood by a world of inferior calibre,
they were unable to satisfy these cravings wholesomely. They were like
potential athletes trained from birth to use certain muscles in
grotesque and cramping actions, and the rest of their bodies not at
all. Thus they never developed their powers, and were haunted by a
sense of falsity and futility in all their mental life. They were
beings, moreover, in whom we found a vigorous and lucid innate loyalty
toward the supreme adventure of the awakening spirit in man, and in the
cosmos. They were very ready to regard themselves and others as
vessels, instruments of a great corporate endeavour. But,
unfortunately, in their terrible spiritual isolation from their
neighbours, they could never whole-heartedly give themselves to the
communal life. In spite of the contempt with which they were treated,
in spite of their own confusion of mind, those of them who survived
beyond the age of twenty-five or thirty could not but observe that the
minds of their fellow-men were woven upon a different pattern from
their own, a pattern at once cruder and more confused, less intricate
yet more discrepant. Moreover, they soon found reason to suspect that
they themselves alone had the cause of the spirit at heart, and that
the rest of the world was frivolous. Each of them was like an isolated
human child brought up by apes in the jungle. When at last he had begun
to realize the gulf between himself and others, he realized also that
he had been damaged past repair by his simian upbringing. In these
circumstances he would, as a rule, content himself with a life of
personal kindliness and humour, which was ever rooted in the strength
of his own unshakable ecstasy of contemplation.</p>

<h3>ii. PAUL AND HUMPTY</h3>

<p>It so happened that one of these rare beings was sent by his parents
to the school where Paul was head master. In appearance he was a great
lout rather like a grotesque child of eight seen through a
magnifying-glass. His thick neck and immense, almost bald head, was
very repulsive to the normal eye. Only the hinder part of his head bore
hair, which was sparse, wiry, and in colour like grey sand. The bare
and lumpy dome of his cranium overhung two pale brown eyes, so large
that they seemed to occupy the whole middle region of his face. Beneath
an inconspicuous nose was a huge and clear-cut mouth. So small was the
lower jaw that the chin, though well moulded, seemed but another nose
under the great lips. The head was held erect in the attitude of one
supporting a pitcher on his crown. This carriage gave to the face a
farcical dignity which the alert and cautious eyes rendered at times
malignant. The thick-set body and great restless hands made women
shudder.</p>

<p>No wonder that this unfortunate child, who received the nickname
Humpty, was persecuted by his schoolfellows. In class his laziness was
relieved now and then by fits of activity, and by uncouth remarks which
roused derision among the boys, but which to Paul were sometimes very
disturbing. The form master at first reported that Humpty was stupid
and incorrigibly indolent; but later it appeared that he was
perpetually active either in remote meditations or in observing and
criticizing everything save the work in hand. Puzzled by the lad's
seeming alternation between stupidity and brilliance, Paul contrived to
give the whole class a series of intelligence tests. Humpty's
performance defeated analysis. Some of the simplest tests floored him,
yet some of those' intended for 'superior adults' he solved without
hesitation. Inquiring into the failures in the low-grade tests, Paul
found that they were always due to some subtle ambiguity in the
problem. The psychologists were not intelligent enough to test this
unique boy.</p>

<p>Paul tried to win Humpty's confidence. He took him out to tea, and
walked with him occasionally at week-ends. Paul had long been in the
habit of taking parties of boys into the country and on the river, and
in the summer he organized camping holidays and trips on the Continent.
At first he had hoped to fit Humpty into this communal activity, but
very soon he realized that nothing could be done with the strange
creature in the presence of his contemporaries. He therefore devoted
some time to treating the boy separately. Humpty was at first hostile,
then politely reticent. When he found that Paul (with my aid) realized
the gulf that lay between him and his fellows, he became cautiously
well-disposed.</p>

<p>Conversation was at first extremely difficult. Paul's old gift of
adopting a persona suited to his companions was now invaluable, but
failed to produce the sudden and easy intimacy which he desired. The
trouble was that Humpty did not belong to any known type. It was
impossible to get in touch with him on the assumption that he was a
normal adolescent; yet in spite of his infantile traits he could not be
successfully treated as a child, for in some ways his interests were
already those of an adult. On the other hand, Paul's well-tried policy
of speaking to his boys 'as man to man' was in this case unsuccessful,
because Humpty seemed to be without the normal craving to be a member
of the adult fraternity. With patience, however, and with a sense that
he was exploring a mentality more remote than anything he had
discovered in earlier adventures. Paul plotted out some of the main
landmarks of Humpty's nature. Gradually an important principle emerged
in this study. In so far as Humpty was infantile, his attention was
arrested by aspects of infantile experience which the normal child
would miss. Sometimes, for instance, before a swim he would lie naked
on the bank twiddling his toes for a solid quarter of an hour, like a
baby in its cot, untouched by Paul's bright talk, or his suggestions
that it was time to take the plunge. This conduct filled Paul with
despair, till he discovered that what fascinated the boy was the
difference between his control of his toes and his control of his
fingers. Moreover, Paul had reason to suspect that there was some other
more recondite aspect of the situation, which either could not be
expressed in the English language, or was too subtle for Paul's
apprehension.</p>

<p>When Paul first made the acquaintance of Humpty, he found the boy in
a state of morbid diffidence punctuated now and then by flashes of
contempt for his fellows. But under the influence of Paul's sympathy
and insight Humpty began to realize that he was not, after all, merely
an inferior being. As his mind developed, and as he came to understand
that he was made on a different pattern from his fellows, it was borne
in on him that in many ways he was superior, that he was basically more
intelligent, more capable of coherent behaviour, less beset by
atavistic impulses, and above all that there were certain aspects of
his experience (in some cases the most delectable) to which none but
the most sensitive of his fellow human beings had any access
whatever.</p>

<p>A year after his first contact with Humpty, Paul began to feel that
the tables had been turned, that he who had formerly played the part of
the superior was being forced step by step to yield precedence. The
change began one day when Paul had been trying to rouse Humpty to work
harder at school by appealing to his competitive self-regard. When the
sermon was over, the boy looked at him with a wonder tinged with
dismay. Then he gave out a single bark of laughter, and said, 'But why
on earth should I want to beat Johnson Minor and the rest?' This was
not a very remarkable question, but coming from Humpty it seemed to
have a peculiar significance. And Paul felt that somehow in his error
of tactics he had displayed a gross vulgarity of feeling.</p>

<p>Somewhat later Paul discovered with dismay that he had been quite
seriously asking Humpty's advice about certain matters of school
policy. It was his custom to ask his boys for advice, so as to give
them a sense of responsibility; but this time he was perturbed to find
that he actually wanted the advice, and intended to use it. By now
Humpty had sized up the mentality of his fellow-mortals very shrewdly;
and in spheres of which he had experience, such as the school, he
displayed a cold and often a cynical intelligence.</p>

<p>After another year had passed, the indolent. Humpty surprised Paul
by settling down to work, and making up for lost ground so successfully
that he soon became the school's most brilliant, but most difficult,
pupil. He gave his teachers the impression that in all his work he was
but playing a game, or that he was learning the mental tricks of the
human race without believing in them or approving of them. It was
impossible to avoid thinking of him as a naturalist in the jungle
studying the mentality of apes. After six months his fame as a prodigy
of scholarship had spread over the whole country. This change in Humpty
gratified Paul, but there was another change which was both
incomprehensible and distressing. Hitherto he had seemed to Paul to be
dangerously lacking in self-regard. Amongst the boys his generosity
over toys, sweets and money had caused him to be mercilessly plundered,
while in his work it was inveterate carelessness of self (so Paul
thought) that had made him so ineffective. But now, along with his
fever of work he developed a propensity for sacrificing the pleasure or
well-being of others to his own interests. In most respects he retained
his normal and unselfish nature though tinged with a contemptuousness
that made him cast favours about him as one might fling refuse to the
dogs; but in matters in which he felt a serious concern he was now a
relentless self-seeker. It took Paul some months to discover the cause
of this extraordinary change, and of the boy's increasing reticence and
frigidity. At last, however, Humpty, during a walk on Leith Hill,
announced that he would take his head master into his confidence,
because he must have the help of some intelligent adult. Paul was then
given a lengthy account of the boy's conclusions about himself, about
the world which he had the misfortune to inhabit, and about his future.
Paul had a sense that the tables had indeed been turned with a
vengeance, and that the grotesque youth was treating him with the
confident superiority with which normally a grown man condescends
toward a child; while the head master himself involuntarily adopted the
respectfulness of one of his own prefects receiving instructions. Yet
according to all sane standards Humpty's plans were preposterous.</p>

<p>After careful psychological and biological inquiry, so Humpty said,
he had discovered that he was profoundly different from the normal
human being, and indeed very superior in mental calibre. Unfortunately
his nature had been seriously distorted by his barbarous upbringing,
'Though', he added, 'you yourself have certainly treated me with
sympathy, and with as much comprehension as can be expected of your
kind. Indeed it is to you I owe it that I was not completely ruined
during my adolescent phase.' Having made this contemptuous
acknowledgement, the formidable boy declared that, in spite of Paul's
care, he was probably by now too much damaged to win through in the
enterprise which he must attempt. However, he would triumph or die
fighting. Here Paul unwisely interrupted to say how glad he was that
Humpty was at last determined to show his ability, and that undoubtedly
he would make a mark in the world whatever career he chose. The boy
stood still and faced his head master, gazing at him with a quizzing
expression under which Paul found it hard to preserve his
self-respect.</p>

<p>Presently Humpty remarked, with all the assurance and quietness of
one who says he must buy cigarettes, or change his clothes, 'What I
must do is to make a new world. I am not sure yet whether I shall have
to destroy it and produce another.' Paul, with immense relief, burst
into laughter. But the other said only, 'I thought you had more
intelligence. In fact I know you have. Think! I mean what I say.' With
dismay Paul realized that Humpty did mean what he said; and with
bewilderment he realized further that something in his own mind
applauded. However, he reminded himself that this would-be builder of
worlds was merely an eccentric boy; and he set himself to persuade
Humpty that he was making a fool of himself, that no single individual,
no matter how superior, could achieve such a task. The boy replied,
'What you say is sound common sense, the kind of sense by which your
species has hitherto triumphed. But an alien mentality such as mine can
see very clearly that common sense is also your undoing, and that, as a
species, you have neither the intelligence nor the virtue to save
yourselves in your present plight. A superior mind may perhaps be able
to discipline you, or to afford you a merciful extinction. With regard
to myself, you are right that I shall almost certainly fail. Your world
is not easy to move, or to destroy; and I have been terribly mutilated
by early contact with an insensitive, a brutish, species. But I must
make the attempt. And for a few years I shall need your help. Think the
matter over for a few weeks, and you will see that I am right, and that
unless you would betray your own highest ideals you must henceforth
subordinate everything else to my service.'</p>

<p>Once more Paul earnestly protested against this folly; but to humour
the lad he listened during the rest of the walk to his amazing plans.
First, Humpty declared he would assimilate all the cultures of the
human race. He was convinced that this would not take him long; for,
having discovered his own superiority, he had also gained unique
insight into the weakness and the limited but solid achievement of the
best human minds. Having made himself the master of all man's wisdom,
he would proceed to correct it by his own finer percipience and
intelligence. Much that he would thus produce would be beyond the
comprehension of his fellows, but he would publish simplified versions
of all his work, based on his thorough knowledge of the inferior
mentality. When this preliminary, easy, and purely theoretical, task
was completed, he would set about the practical reform of the world. He
was confident that by the time he had reached maturity, his superior
tact and the unique power of his personality would enable him to deal
with normal individuals much as a shepherd deals with his sheep; but he
did not disguise from himself the fact that he would have to cope not
only with sheep but with wolves, and that very grave difficulties would
arise when the time came to break down the great atavistic
organizations and vested interests of the world. This task, he
admitted, would need all his skill, and would probably defeat him.
Meanwhile, however, he would have taken steps to produce other
individuals of superior type. Possibly, if his sexual development
turned out normally, some of these would be his own offspring. Possibly
he would have encountered other unique beings scattered up and down the
world. Possibly he would be able to use his finer understanding of
biology and physiology to produce superior men and women from normal
ova. Anyhow, by one means or another, if the worst came to the worst,
and the normal species proved incorrigible, he would found a small
colony of supermen in some remote part of the world. This would become
the germ of a new human species and a new world-order. Little by little
it would gain control of the whole planet, and would either exterminate
the inferior species, or more probably domesticate such members of the
subhuman hordes as it required for its own uses.</p>

<p>At the close of this announcement of policy Humpty paused, then
began again in a voice which betrayed an unexpected hesitation and
distress. 'This programme,' he said, 'sounds to you fantastic, but it
should be possible to one of my powers in a world of inferiors. I am no
paragon. There should some day be minds incomparably finer than mine.
Yet even I, if my health can stand the strain, should prove fit for the
task, but for the severe mutilation which I have already received at
the hands of your species. Till now I have never told you of my most
serious trouble. I must bring myself to lay bare my secret, since you
must help me to make myself whole for the work which I am to do.'</p>

<p>Humpty now told Paul that his sufferings during childhood had filled
him with a violent hate of whatever passed as morality amongst his
fellows. Things had come to such a pitch that, whenever any conduct
seemed likely to earn general approval, he conceived an irresistible
desire to take the opposite course. In his recent burst of hard work,
for instance, public commendation had almost forced him to plunge back
into indolence. Only by reminding himself that the real aim of his work
was to destroy the so-called morality of the inferior species could he
keep himself in hand. His increasing contempt for the well-being of
others, though it found its excuse in his self-dedication to a great
duty, drew its vigour from the sense that he was earning the
condemnation of his fellows. There was also a more serious, or at least
more dramatic, way in which his revulsion from the stink of moralism
threatened to undo him. He was sometimes seized with an ungovernable,
an insane, impulse to violate public decency in whatever manner would
seem at the time most outrageous. He himself was sexually backward, but
the awe and shame with which his elders regarded sex had in early days
intimidated him; and when at last he came to realize the folly and
abject superstitiousness of his countrymen in this matter, he conceived
a violent craving to shock them.</p>

<p>Having forced himself to broach the subject, Humpty was carried away
by his passion. He poured out on the bewildered head master a torrent
of grotesque and mostly obscene fantasies ranging, from schoolboy smut
to acts of brutal sexual aggression. Of the most horrible of these
gruesome titbits he said, after a hushed, almost it seemed a reverent,
laugh, 'That ought to be done on the island in Piccadilly Circus, if
you could catch the right woman there, one of those who look like
princesses. But could I do it before they got at me?'</p>

<p>Paul felt with relief that leadership had once more come into his
hands. He reasoned with the unhappy boy, and promised to help him.
Subsequently he took Humpty to a psycho-analyst who had often dealt
successfully with difficult cases in the school. But this time the
expert was defeated. It was impossible to cure Humpty by bringing to
life his unconscious cravings, for in this strange mind everything was
fully conscious. Humpty knew himself through and through. Suggestion
and hypnotism proved equally impossible. After a few meetings the
analyst began to be ill at ease, for Humpty was taking a malicious
pleasure in forcing him step by step to a most unflattering
self-knowledge. Not only did the unhappy man begin to realize that his
skill was mostly blind guesswork, and that his wisdom left out of
account far more than it embraced, but also to his horror he discovered
that he was dominated by secret desires and loyalties of a religious
type which he had never had the courage to recognize. When Humpty
appeared for the fifteenth meeting he was told that the analyst was
missing. Later it turned out that the distracted man had suffered a
religious conversion, and had fled away into solitude to meditate. Like
so many of his profession, he was at bottom a simple soul; and when he
found in himself needs that could be satisfied by religion but not by
the doctrines of Freud, he could discover nothing better to do than to
leap from the frying-pan of one orthodoxy into the fire of another.
Within a few weeks he had joined a monastic order, and was studying the
psychological principles of St Thomas.</p>

<p>The crippled mind of Humpty seemed now to go from bad to worse. The
more clearly he realized the damage that had been inflicted on him in
childhood, the more he succumbed to hatred, not of his fellow-men, but
of their false righteousness.</p>

<p>In sane periods he told himself that his passion was fantastic; that
when the mood was on him he lusted merely to violate and smash, and
would harm what was precious no less than what was contemptible; that
his obsession was ruining his mind, and making him unfit for his great
task; that he must not let himself be dragged down to the level of the
unhappy and unseeing beasts who surrounded him.</p>

<p>Paul, watching from day to day the desperate struggle of his
prot&eacute;g&eacute;, was overawed by the sense of a momentous
biological tragedy. For he could not but surmise that, if this lonely
and potent being had not been mutilated, he might indeed have founded a
new mankind. Humpty had already fallen into several minor scrapes, from
which Paul had with difficulty extricated him. The head master now
lived in dread of the final catastrophe which would ruin Humpty and
incidentally disgrace the school. But the school was, after all, spared
the extreme disaster. One morning Paul received a letter in which
Humpty declared that, realizing that he was defeated, and that at any
moment he might do grievous harm to some innocent person, he had
decided to die. It was his last wish that his body should be given to a
certain world-famous neurologist for dissection. Inquiry proved that
Humpty had indeed ceased to live, though the cause of his death was
never determined. Needless to say, though he had always been the black
sheep of his family, his parents secured for him a decent Christian
burial.</p>

<p>Thus ended one of Nature's blundering attempts to improve upon her
first, experimental, humanity. One other superior and much more
fortunate individual was destined almost to succeed in the task that
Humpty had merely imagined. Of this other, of the utopian colony which
he founded, and of its destruction by a jealous world, I may tell on
another occasion.</p>

<h3>iii. BACK TO NEPTUNE</h3>

<p>My task is almost completed. My mind is stored with an immense
treasure, which I have gathered, bee-like, in your world, and with
which I must now return to the great and fair hive whence I came. The
other side of my task also is drawing to a close. I have almost
finished this my second message to my own remote ancestors, the First
Men.</p>

<p>Very soon I shall be free to leave your world of sorrow and vain
hope, of horror and of promise unfulfilled. Presently I shall return to
an age long after the destruction of your planet, and not long before
the more tragic destruction of my own more delectable world. Only with
difficulty and danger can the explorer, after close work in the past,
revert once more to his own world. With difficulty and reluctance also,
I shall now begin to put off your mental pattern from my mind, as one
may put off a mask. As the grown man who has been long with children,
living in their games, grieving with them in their childish sorrows, is
tom with regret when at last he must leave them, and half-persuades
himself that their nature and their ways are better than his own, so I
now with reluctance leave your world, with its childish, its so easily
to be avoided yet utterly inescapable, its farcical and yet most
tragic, disaster. But even as, when at last the grown man is once more
at grips with the world of men, his childishness falls from him, so,
when I earnestly revert in imagination to my own world, my assumed
primitiveness falls from me.</p>

<p>It is time to recall myself to myself. I have been dwelling in your
little world, not as one of you, but in order that I might bring to the
racial mind of the Last Men matter for delighting cognizance; in order,
also, that your world may find its crown of glory, not indeed in the
way that was hoped, but in being exquisitely savoured, life by life,
event by event, in the racial mind of the Last Men.</p>

<p>I recall myself to myself. The great world to which I am native has
long ago outgrown the myths, the toys, the bogies of your infant world.
There, one lives without the fear of death and pain, though there one
dies and suffers. There, one knows no lust to triumph over other men,
no fear of being enslaved. There one loves without craving to possess,
worships without thought of salvation, contemplates without pride of
spirit. There one is free as none in your world is free, yet obedient
as none of you is obedient.</p>

<p>I recall myself to myself. The most lovely community of which I am a
member, the most excellently fulfilled Spirit of Man, within which my
mind is organic, must very soon be destroyed. The madness of the Sun is
already hideously at work upon my world. There lies before my
contemporaries an age of incalculable horror and disintegration. From
that horror we must not escape by means of the racial suicide which
alone could save us; for our two supreme acts of piety are not yet
accomplished. We have not yet succeeded in impregnating the remote
regions of this galaxy with the seed of a new mankind. We have not yet
completed our devoted survey of the past. Therefore we may not yet put
an end to ourselves. We must be loyal to the past and to the
future.</p>

<p>I recall myself to myself. Presently I shall wake in my Arctic and
subterranean garden. Once more I shall see with precision and with full
colour through my own eyes, not through the obscuring organs of the
First Men. I shall recognize the familiar forms of Neptunian leaves and
flowers, swaying in the subterranean breeze. I shall feel the large
easefulness of my own body. I shall yawn and stretch and rise. I shall
swim luxuriously in my pool. I shall enter my apartment and ring for
food. Then, before I see any of my colleagues, I shall begin to review
my exploration; I shall record it, and critically edit it. For now at
last I shall have recovered full Neptunian mentality. I shall see with
new insight not only your world but my own self as I was during my long
immersion in your world. Probably I shall smile at my recent
earth-infected thoughts and feelings. I shall smile when I remember
this book, this strange hybrid sprung from the intercourse of a purely
Terrestrial mind and a Neptunian mind, earth-infected. I shall know
that, even when I most strained the understanding of my poor
collaborator, I was not really giving him the full wisdom of the Last
Men, but something far less profound, something that was already
earth-dimmed, already three-parts Terrestrial even at its source in my
own mind.</p>

<p>With a great thankfulness I shall recognize my own complete
reversion to lucidity. With a new awe and zest I shall lay myself open
once more to the inflooding richness and subtlety of my well-loved
world.</p>

<p>After many weeks of labour I shall have completed my report, and
then I shall leave my apartment and meet many of my colleagues, to
exchange findings with them.</p>

<p>But, since in the Catacombs telepathic intercourse may not occur, we
shall soon travel south to live together for a while in a great crystal
pylon where we may pursue our collaboration telepathically. And when we
have made of our combined findings a single, living, apprehension of
your species, we shall broadcast our great treasure telepathically over
the whole world; so that all the million million minds of our fellows
may be enriched by it, so that when the time comes for the next
awakening of the single mind of the race, that great spirit also, which
is not other than each of us fully awakened, may avail itself of our
findings, for its meditation and ecstasy.</p>

<p>When all this is done I shall call up telepathically the ever dear
companion of my holidays, with whom, before my last exploration, I
played and slept, where the broken mountain lies spread out into the
sea. There once more we shall meet and play, watching the populations
of the rock pools, and the risings and settings of the Mad Star. There
once more we shall wander over the turfy hillocks and swim, seal-like,
in the bay, and make for ourselves nests in the long grass, where we
may lie together in the night. There perhaps I shall tell her how, in
another world, seemingly in another universe, I myself, striving in the
numb, the half-human flesh of Paul, lay with the half-human Katherine.
There we shall contemplate the strange beauties of the past and of the
dread future. There we shall savour lingeringly the present.</p>

<p>When our holiday is over I shall return with her to her place of
work, where they prepare for the spreading of the seed. And when she
has shown me how the task is progressing, I shall go wandering about
the world for a very long time, absorbing its intricate beauty,
watching its many and diverse operations, having intercourse with the
great population of my intimate friends, playing my part in the life of
my marriage group, visiting the Land of the Young, voyaging in
ether-ships among the planets, wandering alone in the wild places of
the home planet, idling or meditating in my garden or working among my
fruit trees, or watching the most distant universes from some great
observatory, or studying with the help of astronomers the slow but
fatal progress of the sun's disease.</p>

<p>It may be that before it is time for me to go once more into the
past, there will occur again a supreme awakening of the racial mind. It
may be that after the unique day of the awakening I shall for a long
time move about the world entranced like my fellows, rapt in the
ineffable experiences of the single Spirit of Man, contemplating
perhaps at last the supernal entities which it is man's chief glory to
strive to worship. Sooner or later, however, I shall return once more
to my work in the past, either to the First Men or to some other
primitive species. I shall bring back with me more treasure of living
history, and deliver it into the world of the Last Men. And again I
shall play, and again I shall participate in the rich life of my world,
and again I shall return to the past. And so on for I know not how many
times.</p>

<p>But each time, when I leave the present for the past, there will
have been a change in my world, a slight deterioration, sometimes
perhaps imperceptible. The climate will have grown hotter and more
unwholesome. The inescapable rays of the mad sun will have done more
harm to eyes and brains. Society will perhaps no longer be perfect,
rational conduct no longer invariable, telepathy perhaps already
difficult; and very probably the racial mentality will have already
become impossible. But also the exploration of the past will be
advancing toward completion, though with increasing difficulty; and the
dissemination of the seed of life will be at last begun.</p>

<p>The Last Men can look forward without dismay to the inevitable
deterioration of all that they cherish most, to the death of their fair
community, and to the extinction of the human spirit. We have only one
desire, namely that our two tasks may be accomplished; and that happily
they may be accomplished before our deterioration is so far advanced as
to make us incapable of choosing to put an end to ourselves when at
last we are free to do so. For the thought is somewhat repugnant to us
that we should slowly sink into barbarism, into the sub-human, into
blind and whimpering agony, that the last of Man should be a whine.</p>

<p>This may well happen, but even by such a prospect we are not
seriously dismayed. If it does occur, it will doubtless seem
intolerable to our degraded spirits. But today, we are fully possessed
of ourselves. Even as individuals, even apart from the exaltation of
racial mentality, we can accept with resignation, nay with a surprising
fervour of appreciation, even the moral downfall of our world. For we
have gone far. We have drunk deeply of beauty. And to the spirit that
has drunk deeply of the grave beauty of the cosmos, even the ultimate
horror is acceptable.</p>

<h3>iv. EPILOGUE BY THE TERRESTRIAL AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK</h3>

<p>Readers of my earlier book, Last and First Men, may remember that it
closed with an epilogue which my Neptunian controller claimed to have
transmitted to me from a date in Neptunian history many thousands of
years after the communication of the body of the book. The present book
was obviously originated at a Neptunian date shortly after the
transmission of the main part of the earlier book, but very long before
its epilogue. Now I have reason to believe that at some date long after
the communication of that former epilogue itself, my controller
attempted to give me an epilogue to the present volume, but that owing
to the serious disintegration of the most delicate brain tracts of the
Last Men, and the gradual break-up of their world society, the result
has been extremely confused and fragmentary.</p>

<p>I shall now attempt to piece together the random thoughts and
passions, and occasional definite statements, which have come into my
mind seemingly from my Neptunian controller. By supplementing them with
a careful use of my own imagination, I shall try to construct a picture
of the state of affairs on Neptune when the disaster was already far
advanced.</p>

<p>From the vague flood of intimations that has come through to me I
gather that the hope of disseminating a seed of life abroad among the
stars, before the disaster should have extinguished man's powers, was
not fulfilled. The dissemination had indeed actually been begun, when
it was discovered that the vital seed was all the while being destroyed
in the process of scattering. This trouble, and other unexpected
difficulties, which occurred seemingly at some date after the
communicating of the earlier epilogue, not merely delayed the
enterprise, but even led to its abandonment for some thousands of
years. Then some new discovery in psychophysics raised a hope of
achieving the Dissemination by an entirely new method. A vast new
enterprise was therefore set on foot; but was seriously hampered by the
increasingly cruel climate, the steady deterioration of mental calibre,
the ceaseless national wars and civil confusion. It would seem, though
the inference is by no means certain, that at the date of this final
and intermittent communication, the Dissemination had already ceased
for ever; whether because it had been successfully accomplished or
because it was no longer physically possible, or because the will to
pursue it had already been broken, I cannot ascertain. Probably the
work was now beyond the powers of a degenerate and disorganized
world-community.</p>

<p>The other great task which the doomed population had undertaken to
complete before its final downfall, the Exploration of the Human Past,
seems to have been in a manner finished, though in less detail than was
originally planned. Several communications suggest that such workers as
remained able and willing to enter into the past were trying to
concentrate their failing powers on certain critical points of Man's
career, so as to reconstruct at least these moments in full minuteness.
But as the racial mode of mentality had already become impossible, and
as the individual explorers had evidently very seriously deteriorated,
it seems clear that such data as were still being collected would never
be incorporated in the single racial consciousness, in the aesthetic
apprehension of the Cosmos by the fully awakened Spirit of Man. In fact
the continuation of the work of exploring the past seems to have become
as automatic and irrational as the aimless researches of some of our
Terrestrial historians.</p>

<p>In the epilogue to the earlier book it was reported that, as the
higher and more recent brain-tracts were corroded by the fury of
ultra-violet solar radiation, the surviving members of the community
suffered a harrowing struggle between their nobler and their baser
natures, a struggle which issued inevitably in the defeat of all that
was most excellent in them. At the date of the epilogue to the present
book, the race seems to have been reduced to a remnant of distraught
and almost sub-human beings clustering round the South Pole, which, one
may suppose, was the only region of the planet still capable of
supporting human existence at all. The life of this remnant must have
been completely aimless and abject. It apparently consisted of
half-hearted agriculture, occasional hunting expeditions against the
wild creatures that had been driven south by the heat, and frequent
predatory raids of neighbouring groups to capture one another's food
and women.</p>

<p>The population was evidently obsessed by the terror of death, of
starvation, and above all of insanity. The death-rate must have been
very high, but there was also a huge birthrate. Conception was no
longer controlled. Invalid children seem to have composed a large
proportion of the population. Parenthood and sex evidently bulked very
largely in the popular mind. There were wild sexual orgies, which
apparently had acquired some religious significance; and there was a
vast ritual of superstitious taboos, most of which seem to have been
intended to purify the soul and prepare it for eternal life. Apparently
some divinity, referred to as the God of Man, was expected to destroy
the world by fire, but to snatch into eternal bliss those who had kept
all the taboos. His Younger Brother, it seems, had already appeared on
Neptune, but had been killed by his enemies. This legend should,
perhaps, be connected in some way or other with the superior being who,
in the epilogue to the previous book is referred to as 'this younger
brother of ours'.</p>

<p>Not every one succumbed to these superstitions. My controller
himself rejected them, and retained a pathetic loyalty to the ancient
wisdom, some shreds of which he now and then remembered. But I have
reason to believe that very often his memory of them was but a verbal
formula, without insight.</p>

<p>Clearly, for those who, like my controller, had kept alive in
themselves something of the former purpose of the race, there was now
no longer any reason to refrain from racial suicide. The two
enterprises for which euthanasia had been postponed could no longer be
usefully continued. But the unhappy members of what had once been the
noblest of all human communities had no longer the courage or the
common sense to destroy themselves. Those who accepted the popular
superstitions declared that the God had forbidden men to seek death
before their time. Those who rejected the doctrine of salvation
persuaded themselves that they refrained from suicide because to flee
was cowardly.</p>

<p>At this point I will report a verbal fragment of communication which
is typical of most that I have received, and seems to bear out many of
the foregoing inferences.</p>

<p>'Vain to live. Yet Life insists. Work insists. Too many thousands of
men, of women, of crawling children with eyes festering. Too little
food. Blue sun piercing the deep cloud-zone, parching the fields. Child
meat in the flesh pots. Eat the mad, who come to grief. The many mad.
Mad men with knives. Mad women with smiles, with skull-faces. (And I
remember beauty.) Too many labours and fears. Too hot. Hateful
proximity of men hot. Love one another? With sweat between! Love best
in the water, the cooling water, that makes the body lighter. The
pools, the rains, the house-uprooting storms, the everlasting cloud,
blinding purple. God will come soon, they say it. To burn the world, to
take away his friends. The God-dream. Too good, too cheap. Radiation
the one God, all pervading, cruel. To die quickly, to sleep and not
wake! But life insists, work insists. Vain work insists. Yet why? The
old far days, Godless, beautiful. The glorious world. The fair world of
men and women and of the single awareness. Eye of the cosmos. Heart of
the cosmos. Cunning hand. Then, we faced all things gaily. Even this
corruption, when we foresaw it, we called "a fair end to the brief
music that is man". This! The strings all awry, screaming out of tune,
a fair end!'</p>

<p>This passage is typical, though more coherent than most. There are
others more striking, but so repugnant to the taste of my
contemporaries that I dare not repeat them, passages describing the
prevailing brutishness of sexual relations in a population that had
already so far degenerated that neither sex could interest the other
save in the crudest manner. This impoverishment of sexual life was due
to the fact that physical health and beauty had been undermined, that
apprehension of the more delicate, aesthetic and spiritual aspects of
experience had become almost impossible, that the realization of other
individuals as living personalities was very uncommon. Nearly all
behaviour was the impulsive behaviour of beasts, though of beasts in
whose nature were incorporated many tricks derived from a forgotten
humanity.</p>

<p>Some men and women there still were who had not permanently sunk to
this brutish level. Several communications make it clear that, although
the culture and the actual mental capacity of the Last Men were by now
so degenerate, some few, a scattered and dwindling aristocracy, were
still capable, at least intermittently, of personal love, and even of
perplexed loyalty to certain ideals of conduct. The evidence for this
lies in such passages as the following, which with its fleeting
recovery of the earlier intelligence, and its bewildered groping after
a forgotten ecstasy, affords perhaps the right conclusion to this
book.</p>

<p>'She lies motionless in the shallow water. The waves, fingering, the
hot sand, recoil steaming. Her flesh, translucent formerly, now is
filmed and grey, blind like her filmed eyes. We have taken of each
other very deeply. The heat tricks us sometimes into intolerance each
of the other's unyouthful body, unpliant mind; yet each is the other's
needed air for breathing. We have ranged in our work very far apart,
she into the astronomical spaces, I into the pre-historical times. But
now we will remain together until the end. There is nothing more for us
to do but to remember, to tolerate, to find strength together, to keep
the spirit clear so long as may be. The many aeons of man! The many
million, million selves; ephemeridae, each to itself, the universe's
one quick point, the crux of all cosmical endeavour. And all defeated!
The single, the very seldom achieved, spirit! We two, now so confused,
participated once in man's clearest elucidation. It is forgotten. It
leaves only a darkness, deepened by blind recollection of past light.
Soon, a greater darkness! Man, a moth sucked into a furnace, vanishes;
and then the furnace also, since it is but a spark islanded in the
wide, the everlasting darkness. If there is a meaning, it is no human
meaning. Yet one thing in all this welter stands apart, unassailable,
fair, the blind recollection of past light.'</p>
