<hr>
<br>
  <p class="first">DR. DANIEL SCOTT, his dark and brilliant eyes alight with
  the fire of enthusiasm, paused at last and stared out over the city, or that
  portion of it visible from the office windows of Herman Bach&mdash;the Dr.
  Herman Bach of Grand Mercy Hospital. There was a moment of silence; the old
  man smiled a little indulgently, a little wistfully, at the face of the
  youthful biochemist.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Dan," he said. "So it occurred to you that getting well of a
  disease or injury is merely a form of adaptation&mdash;then what?"</p>

  <p>"Then," flashed the other, "I began to look for the most adaptive of
  living organisms. And what are they? Insects! Insects, of course. Cut off a
  wing, and it grows back. Cut off a head, stick it to the headless body of
  another of the same species, and that grows back on. And what's the secret of
  their great adaptability?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Bach shrugged. "What is?"</p>

  <p>Scott was suddenly gloomy. "I'm not sure," he muttered. "It's glandular,
  of course&mdash;a matter of hormones." He brightened again. "But I'm off the
  track. So then I looked around for the most adaptive insect. And which is
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Ants?" suggested Dr. Bach. "Bees? Termites?"</p>

  <p>"Bah! They're the most highly evolved, not the most adaptable. No; there's
  one insect that is known to produce a higher percentage of mutants than any
  other, more freaks, more biological sports. The one Morgan used in his
  experiments on the effect of hard X-rays on heredity&mdash;the fruit fly, the
  ordinary fruit fly. Remember? They have reddish eyes, but under X-rays they
  produced white-eyed offspring&mdash;and that was a true mutation, because the
  white eyes bred true! Acquired characteristics can't be inherited, but these
  were. Therefore&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know," interrupted Dr. Bach.</p>

  <p>Scott caught his breath. "So I used fruit flies," he resumed. "I putrefied
  their bodies, injected a cow, and got a serum at last, after weeks of
  clarifying with albumen, evaporating <i>in vacuo</i>, rectifying with&mdash;
  But you're not interested in the technique. I got a serum. I tried it on
  tubercular guinea pigs, and"&mdash;he paused dramatically&mdash;"it cured!
  They adapted themselves to the tubercle bacillus. I tried it on a rabid dog.
  He adapted. I tried it on a cat with a broken spine. That knit. And now, I'm
  asking you for the chance to try it on a human being!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Bach frowned. "You're not ready," he grunted. "You're not ready by two
  years. Try it on an anthropoid. Then try it on yourself. I can't risk a human
  life in an experiment that's as raw as this."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I haven't got anything that needs curing, and as for an
  anthropoid, you get the board to allow funds to buy an ape&mdash;if you can.
  I've tried."</p>

  <p>"Take it up with the Stoneman Foundation, then."</p>

  <p>"And have Grand Mercy lose the credit? Listen, Dr. Bach, I'm asking for
  just one chance&mdash;a charity case&mdash;anything."</p>

  <p>"Charity cases are human beings." The old man scowled down at his hands.
  "See here, Dan. I shouldn't even offer this much, because it's against all
  medical ethics, but if I find a hopeless case&mdash;utterly hopeless, you
  understand&mdash;where the patient himself consents, I'll do it. And that's
  the final word."</p>

  <p>Scott groaned. "And try to find a case like that. If the patient's
  conscious, you think there's hope, and if he isn't how can he consent? That
  settles it!"</p>

  <p>But it didn't. Less than a week later Scott looked suddenly up at the
  annunciator in the corner of his tiny laboratory. "Dr. Scott," it rasped.
  "Dr. Scott. Dr. Scott. To Dr. Bach's office."</p>

  <p>He finished his titration, noted the figures, and hurried out. The old man
  was pacing the floor nervously as Scott entered.</p>

  <p>"I've got your case, Dan," he muttered. "It's against all ethics&mdash;
  yet I'll be damned if I can see how you can do this one any harm. But you'd
  better hurry. Come on&mdash;isolation ward."</p>

  <p>They hurried. In the tiny cubical room Scott stared appalled. "A girl!" he
  muttered.</p>

  <p>She could never have been other than drab and plain, but lying there with
  the pallor of death already on her cheeks, she had an appearance of somber
  sweetness. Yet that was all the charm she could ever have possessed; her
  dark, cropped, oily hair was unkempt and stringy, her features flat and
  unattractive. She breathed with an almost inaudible rasp, and her eyes were
  dosed.</p>

  <p>"Do you," asked Scott, "consider this a test? She's all but dead now."</p>

  <p>Dr. Bach nodded. "Tuberculosis," he said, "final stage. Her lungs are
  hemorrhaging&mdash;a matter of hours."</p>

  <p>The girl coughed; flecks of blood appeared on her pallid lips. She opened
  dull, watery blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"So!" said Bach, "conscious, eh? This is Dr. Scott. Dan, this is&mdash;
  uh"&mdash;he peered at the card at the foot of the bed&mdash;"Miss
  &mdash;uh&mdash;Kyra Zelas. Dr. Scott has an injection, Miss Zelas. As I
  warned you, it probably won't help, but I can't see how it can hurt. Are you
  willing?"</p>

  <p>She spoke in faint, gurgling tones. "Sure, I'm through anyway. What's the
  odds?"</p>

  <p>"All right. Got the hypo, Dan?" Bach took the tube of water-clear serum.
  "Any particular point of injection? No? Give me the cubital, then."</p>

  <p>He thrust the needle into the girl's arm. Dan noted that she did not even
  wince at the bite of the steel point, but lay stoical and passive as thirty
  cc. of liquid flowed into her veins. She coughed again, then closed her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Come out of here," ordered Bach gruffly, as they moved into the hall,
  "I'm damned if I like this. I feel like a dirty dog."</p>

  <p>He seemed to feel less canine, however, the following day. "That Zelas
  case is still alive," he reported to Scott. "If I dared trust my eyes, I'd
  say she's improved a little. A very little. I'd still call it hopeless."</p>

  <p>But the following day Scott found himself seated in his office with a
  puzzled expression in his old gray eyes. "Zelas is better," he muttered. "No
  question of it. But you keep your head, Dan. Such miracles have happened
  before, and without serums. You wait until we've had her under long
  observation."</p>

  <p>By the end of the week it became evident that the observation was not to
  be long. Kyra Zelas flourished under their gaze like some swift-blooming
  tropical weed. Queerly, she lost none of her pallor, but flesh softened the
  angular features, and a trace of light grew in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"The spots on her lungs are going," muttered Bach. "She's stopped
  coughing, and there's no sign of bugs in her culture. But the queerest thing,
  Dan&mdash;and I can't figure it out, either&mdash;is the way she reacts to
  abrasions and skin punctures. Yesterday I took a blood specimen for a
  Wasserman, and&mdash;this sounds utterly mad&mdash;the puncture closed almost
  before I had a c.c.! Closed and healed!"</p>

  <p>And in another week, "Dan, I can't see any reason for keeping Kyra here.
  She's well. Yet I want her where we can keep her under observation. There's a
  queer mystery about this serum of yours. And besides, I hate to turn her out
  to the sort of life that brought her here."</p>

  <p>"What did she do?"</p>

  <p>"Sewed. Piece work in some sweatshop, when she could work at all. Drab,
  ugly, uneducated girl, but there's something appealing about her. She adapts
  quickly."</p>

  <p>Scott gave him a strange look. "Yes," he said, "she adapts quickly."</p>

  <p>"So," resumed Bach, "it occurred to me that she could stay at my place. We
  could keep her under observation, you see, and she could help the
  housekeeper. I'm interested&mdash;damn' interested. I think I'll offer her
  the chance."</p>

  <p>Scott was present when Dr. Bach made his suggestion. The girl Kyra smiled.
  "Sure," she said. Her pallid, plain face lighted up. "Thanks."</p>

  <p>Bach gave her the address. "Mrs. Getz will let you in. Don't do anything
  this afternoon. In fact, it might not hurt you to simply walk in the park for
  a few hours."</p>

  <p>Scott watched the girl as she walked down the hall toward the elevator.
  She had filled out, but she was still spare to the point of emaciation, and
  her worn black suit hung on her as if it were on a frame of sticks. As she
  disappeared, he moved thoughtfully about his duties, and a quarter hour later
  descended to his laboratory.</p>

  <p>On the first floor, turmoil met him. Two officers were carrying in the
  body of a nondescript old man, whose head was a bloody ruin. There was a
  babble of excited voices, and he saw a crowd on the steps outside.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" he called. "Accident?"</p>

  <p>"Accident!" snapped an officer. "Murder, you mean. Woman steps up to this
  old guy, picks a hefty stone from the park border, slugs him, and takes his
  wallet. Just like that!"</p>

  <p>Scott peered out of the window. The Black Maria was backing toward a crowd
  on the park side of the street.</p>

  <p>A pair of hulking policemen flanked a thin figure in black, thrusting it
  toward the doors of the vehicle. Scott gasped. It was Kyra Zelas!</p>

  <p>A week later Dr. Bach stared into the dark fireplace of his living room.
  "It's not our business," he repeated. "My God!" blazed Scott. "Not our
  business! How do we know we're not responsible? How do we know that our
  injection didn't unsettle her mind? Glands can do that; look at Mongoloid
  idiots and cretins. Our stuff was glandular. Maybe we drove her crazy!"</p>

  <p>"All right," said Bach. "Listen. We'll attend the trial tomorrow, and if
  it looks bad for her, we'll get hold of her lawyer and let him put us on the
  stand. We'll testify that she's just been released after a long and dangerous
  illness, and may not be fully responsible. That's entirely true."</p>

  <p>Mid-morning of the next day found them hunched tensely on benches in the
  crowded courtroom. The prosecution was opening; three witnesses testified to
  the event.</p>

  <p>"This old guy buys peanuts for the pigeons. Yeah, I sell 'em to him every
  day&mdash;or did. So this time he hasn't any change, and he pulls out his
  wallet, and I see it's stuffed with bills. And one minute later I see the
  dame pick up the rock and conk him. Then she grabs the dough&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Describe her, please."</p>

  <p>"She's skinny, and dressed in black. She ain't no beauty, neither.
  Brownish hair, dark eyes, I don't know whether dark-blue or brown."</p>

  <p>"Your witness!" snapped the prosecutor.</p>

  <p>A young and nervous individual&mdash;appointed by the court, the paper
  said&mdash;rose. "You say," he squeaked, "that the assailant had brown hair
  and dark eyes?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah."</p>

  <p>"Will the defendant please rise?"</p>

  <p>Her back was toward Scott and Bach as Kyra Zelas arose, but Scott
  stiffened. Something strangely different about her appearance; surely her
  worn black suit no longer hung so loosely about her. What he could see of her
  figure seemed&mdash;well, magnificent.</p>

  <p>"Take off your hat, Miss Zelas," squeaked the attorney.</p>

  <p>Scott gasped. Radiant as aluminum glowed the mass of hair she
  revealed!</p>

  <p>"I submit, your honor, that this defendant does not possess dark hair,
  nor, if you will observe, dark eyes. It is, I suppose, conceivable that she
  could somehow have bleached her hair while in custody, and I therefore"
  &mdash;he brandished a pair of scissors&mdash;"submit a lock to be tested by
  any chemist the court appoints. The pigmentation is entirely natural. And as
  for her eyes&mdash;does my esteemed opponent suggest that they, too, are
  bleached?"</p>

  <p>He swung on the gaping witness. "Is this lady the one you claim to have
  seen committing the crime?"</p>

  <p>The man goggled. "Uh&mdash;I can't&mdash;say."</p>

  <p>"Is she?"</p>

  <p>"N-no!"</p>

  <p>The speaker smiled. "That's all. Will you take the stand, Miss Zelas?"</p>

  <p>The girl moved lithe as a panther. Slowly she turned, facing the court.
  Scott's brain whirled, and his fingers dug into Bach's arm. Silver-eyed,
  aluminum-haired, alabaster pale, the girl on the stand was beyond doubt the
  most beautiful woman he had ever seen!</p>

  <p>The attorney was speaking again. "Tell the court in your own words what
  happened, Miss Zelas."</p>

  <p>Quite casually the girl crossed her trim ankles and began to speak. Her
  voice was low, resonant, and thrilling; Scott had to fight to keep his
  attention on the sense of her words rather than the sound.</p>

  <p>"I had just left Grand Mercy Hospital," she said, "where I had been ill
  for some months. I had crossed the park when suddenly a woman in black rushed
  at me, thrust an empty wallet into my hands, and vanished. A moment later I
  was surrounded by a screaming crowd, and&mdash;well, that's all."</p>

  <p>"An empty wallet, you say?" asked the defense lawyer. "What of the money
  found in your own bag, which my eminent colleague believes stolen?"</p>

  <p>"It was mine," said the girl, "about seven hundred dollars."</p>

  <p>Bach hissed, "That's a lie! She had two dollars and thirty-three cents on
  her when we took her in."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean you think she's the same Kyra Zelas we had at the hospital?"
  gasped Scott.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I don't know anything, but if I ever touch that damned
  serum of yours&mdash;Look! Look, Dan!" This last was a tense whisper.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Her hair! When the sun strikes it!"</p>

  <p>Scott peered more closely. A vagrant ray of noon sunlight filtered through
  a high window, and now and again the swaying of a shade permitted it to touch
  the metallic radiance of the girl's hair. Scott stared and saw; slightly but
  unmistakable, whenever the light touched that glowing aureole, her hair
  darkened from bright aluminum to golden blond!</p>

  <p>Something clicked in his brain. There was a clue somewhere&mdash;if he
  could but find it. The pieces of the puzzle were there, but they were
  woefully hard to fit together. The girl in the hospital and her reaction to
  incisions; this girl and her reaction to light.</p>

  <p>"I've got to see her," he whispered. "There's something I have to find
  &mdash;Listen!"</p>

  <p>The speaker was orating. "And we ask the dismissal of the whole case, your
  honor, on the grounds that the prosecution has utterly failed even to
  identify the defendant."</p>

  <p>The judge's gavel crashed. For a moment his aging eyes rested on the girl
  with the silver eyes and, incredible hair, then: "Case dismissed!" he
  snapped. "Jury discharged!"</p>

  <p>There was a tumult of voices. Flashlights shot instantaneous sheets of
  lightning. The girl on the witness stand rose with perfect poise, smiled with
  lovely, innocent lips, and moved away. Scott waited until she passed close at
  hand then:</p>

  <p>"Miss Zelas!" he called.</p>

  <p>She paused. Her strange silver eyes lighted with unmistakable recognition.
  "Dr. Scott!" said the voice of tinkling metal. "And Dr. Bach!"</p>

  <p>She was, then. She was the same girl. This was the drab sloven of the
  isolation ward, this weirdly beautiful creature of exotic coloring. Staring,
  Scott could trace now the very identity of her features, but changed as by a
  miracle.</p>

  <p>He pushed through the mob of photographers, press men, and curiosity
  seekers. "Have you a place to stay?" he asked. "Dr. Bach's offer still
  stands."</p>

  <p>She smiled. "I am very grateful," she murmured, and then, to the crowd of
  reporters. "The doctor is an old friend of mine." She was completely at ease,
  unruffled, poised.</p>

  <p>Something caught Scott's eye, and he purchased a paper, glancing quickly
  at the photograph, the one taken at the moment the girl had removed her hat.
  He started; her hair showed raven black! There was a comment below the
  picture, too, to the effect that "her striking hair photographs much darker
  than it appears to the eye."</p>

  <p>He frowned. "This way," he said to the girl, then goggled in surprise
  again. For in the broad light of noon her complexion was no longer the white
  of alabaster; it was creamy tan, the skin of one exposed to long hours of
  sunlight; her eyes were deep violet, and her hair&mdash;that tiny wisp
  unconcealed by her hat&mdash;was as black as the basalt columns of hell!</p>

  <p>Kyra had insisted on stopping to purchase a substitute for the worn black
  suit, and had ended by acquiring an entire outfit. She sat now curled in the
  deep davenport before the fireplace in Dr. Bach's library, sheathed in silken
  black from her white throat to the tiny black pumps on her feet. She was
  almost unearthly in her weird beauty, with her aluminum hair, silver eyes,
  and marble-pale skin against the jet silk covering.</p>

  <p>She gazed innocently at Scott. "But why shouldn't I?" she asked. "The
  court returned my money; I can buy what I please with it."</p>

  <p>"Your money?" he muttered. "You had less than three dollars when you left
  the hospital."</p>

  <p>"But this is mine now."</p>

  <p>"Kyra," he said abruptly, "where did you get that money?"</p>

  <p>Her face was saintlike in its purity. "From the old man."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you did murder him!"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course I did."</p>

  <p>He choked. "My Lord!" he gasped. "Don't you realize we'll have to
  tell?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, smiling, gently from one to the other of them. "No,
  Dan. You won't tell, for it wouldn't do any good. I can't be tried twice for
  the same crime. Not in America."</p>

  <p>"But why, Kyra? Why did you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would you have me resume the life that sent me into your hands? I needed
  money; money was there; I took it."</p>

  <p>"But murder!"</p>

  <p>"It was the most direct way."</p>

  <p>"Not if you happened to be punished for it," he returned grimly.</p>

  <p>"But I wasn't," she reminded him gently.</p>

  <p>He groaned. "Kyra," he said, shifting the subject suddenly, "why do your
  eyes and skin and hair darken in sunlight or when exposed to flashlight?"</p>

  <p>She smiled. "Do they?" she asked. "I hadn't noticed." She yawned,
  stretched her arms above her head and her slim legs before her. "I think I
  shall sleep now," she announced. She swept her magnificent eyes over them,
  rose, and disappeared into the room Dr. Bach had given her&mdash;his own.</p>

  <p>Scott faced the older man, his features working in emotion. "Do you see?"
  he hissed. "Good Lord, do you see?"</p>

  <p>"Do you, Dan?"</p>

  <p>"Part of it. Part of it, anyway."</p>

  <p>"And I see part as well."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Scott, "here it is as I see it. That serum&mdash;that
  accursed serum of mine&mdash;has somehow accentuated this girl's adaptability
  to an impossible degree. What is it that differentiates life from non-living
  matter? Two things, irritation and adaptation. Life adapts itself to its
  environment, and the greater the adaptability, the more successful the
  organism.</p>

  <p>"Now," he proceeded, "all human beings show a very considerable
  adaptivity. When we expose ourselves to sunlight, our skin shows pigmentation
  &mdash;we tan. That's adaptation to an environment containing sunlight. When
  a man loses his right hand, he learns to use his left. That's another
  adaptation. When a person's skin is punctured, it heals and rebuilds, and
  that's another angle of the same thing. Sunny regions produce dark-skinned,
  dark-haired people; northern lands produce blonds&mdash;and that's adaptation
  again.</p>

  <p>"So what's happened to Kyra Zelas, by some mad twist I don't understand,
  is that her adaptive powers have been increased to an extreme. She adapts
  instantly to her environment; when sun strikes her, she tans at once, and in
  shade she fades immediately. In sunlight her hair and eyes are those of a
  tropical race; in shadow, those of a Northerner. And&mdash;good Lord, I see
  it now&mdash;when she was faced with danger there in the courtroom, faced by
  a jury and judge who were men, she adapted to that! She met that danger, not
  only by changed appearance, but by a beauty so great, that she couldn't have
  been convicted!" He paused. "But how? How?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps medicine can tell how," said Bach. "Undoubtedly man is the
  creature of his glands. The differences between races&mdash;white, red,
  black, yellow&mdash;is doubtless glandular. And perhaps the most effective
  agent of adaptation is the human brain and neural system, which in itself is
  controlled partly by a little greasy mass on the floor of the brain's third
  ventricle, before the cerebellum, and supposed by the ancients to be the seat
  of the soul.</p>

  <p>"I mean, of course, the pineal gland. I suspect that what your serum
  contains is the long-sought hormone <i>pinealin</i>, and that it has caused
  hypertrophy of Kyra's pineal gland. And Dan, do you realize that if her
  adaptability is perfect, she's not only invincible, but invulnerable?"</p>

  <p>"That's true!" gulped Scott. "Why, she couldn't be electrocuted, because
  she'd adapt instantly to an environment containing an electric current, and
  she couldn't be killed by a shot, because she'd adapt to that as quickly as
  to your needle pricks. And poison&mdash;but there must be a limit
  somewhere!"</p>

  <p>"There doubtless is," observed Bach. "I hardly believe she could adapt
  herself to an environment containing a fifty-ton locomotive passing over her
  body. And yet there's an important point we haven't considered. Adaptation
  itself is of two kinds."</p>

  <p>"Two kinds?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. One kind is biological; the other, human. Naturally a biochemist
  like you would deal only with the first, and equally naturally a brain
  surgeon like me has to consider the second as well. Biological adaptation is
  what all life&mdash;plant, animal, and human&mdash;possesses, and it is
  merely conforming to one's environment. A chameleon, for instance, shows much
  the same ability as Kyra herself, and so, in lesser degree, does the arctic
  fox, white in winter, brown in summer; or the snowshoe rabbit, for that
  matter, or the weasel. All life conforms to its environment to a great
  extent, because if it doesn't, it dies. But human life does more."</p>

  <p>"More?"</p>

  <p>"Much more. Human adaptation is not only conformity to environment, but
  also the actual changing of environment to fit human needs! The first cave
  man who left his cave to build a grass hut changed his environment, and so,
  in exactly the same sense, did Steinmetz, Edison, and as far as that goes,
  Julius Caesar and Napoleon. In fact, Dan, all human invention, genius, and
  military leadership boils down to that one fact&mdash;changing the
  environment instead of conforming to it."</p>

  <p>He paused, then continued, "Now we know that Kyra possesses the biological
  adaptivity. Her hair and eyes prove that. But what if she possesses the other
  to the same degree? If she does, God knows what the result will be. We can
  only watch to see what direction she takes&mdash;watch and hope."</p>

  <p>"But I don't see," muttered Scott, "how that could be glandular."</p>

  <p>"Anything can be glandular. In a mutant&mdash;and Kyra's as much a mutant
  as your white-eyed fruit flies&mdash;anything is possible." He frowned
  reflectively. "If I dared phrase a philosophical interpretation, I'd say that
  Kyra&mdash;perhaps&mdash;represents a stage in human evolution. A mutation.
  If one ventured to believe that, then de Vries and Weissman are
  justified."</p>

  <p>"The mutation theory of evolution, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly. You see, Dan, while it is very obvious from fossil remains that
  evolution occurred, yet it is very easy to prove it couldn't possibly have
  occurred!"</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it couldn't have occurred slowly, as Darwin believed, for many
  reasons. Take the eye, for instance. He thought that very gradually, over
  thousands of generations, some sea creature developed a spot on its skin that
  was sensitive to light, and that this gave it an advantage over its blind
  fellows. Therefore its kind survived and others perished. But see here. If
  this eye developed slowly, why did the very first ones, the ones that
  couldn't yet see, have any better chance than the others? And take a wing.
  What good is a wing until you can fly with it? Just because a jumping lizard
  had a tiny fold of skin between foreleg and breast wouldn't mean that that
  lizard could survive where others died. What kept the wing developing to a
  point where it could actually have value?"</p>

  <p>"What did?"</p>

  <p>"De Vries and Weissman say nothing did. They answer that evolution must
  have progressed in jumps, so that when the eye appeared, it was already
  efficient enough to have survival value, and likewise the wing. Those jumps
  they named mutations. And in that sense, Dan, Kyra's a mutation, a jump from
  the human to&mdash;something else. Perhaps the superhuman."</p>

  <p>Scott shook his head in perplexity. He was thoroughly puzzled, completely
  baffled, and more than a little unnerved. In a few moments more he bade Bach
  good night, wandered home, and lay for hours in sleepless thought.</p>

  <p>The next day Bach managed a leave of absence for both of them from Grand
  Mercy, and Scott moved in. This was in part simply out of his fascinated
  interest in the case of Kyra Zelas, but in part it was altruistic. She had
  confessedly murdered one man; it occurred to Scott that she might with no
  more compunction murder Dr. Bach, and he meant to be at hand to prevent
  it.</p>

  <p>He had been in her company no more than a few hours before Bach's words on
  evolution and mutations took on new meaning. It was not only Kyra's
  chameleon-like coloring, nor her strangely pure and saintlike features, nor
  even her incredible beauty. There was something more; he could not at once
  identify it, but decidedly the girl Kyra was not quite human.</p>

  <p>The event that impressed this on him occurred in the late afternoon. Bach
  was away somewhere on personal business, and Scott had been questioning the
  girl about her own impressions of her experience.</p>

  <p>"But don't you know you've changed?" he asked. "Can't you see the
  difference in yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Not I. It is the world that has changed."</p>

  <p>"But your hair was black. Now it's light as ashes."</p>

  <p>"Was it?" she asked. "Is it?"</p>

  <p>He groaned in exasperation. "Kyra," he said, "you must know something
  about yourself."</p>

  <p>Her exquisite eyes turned their silver on him. "I do," she said. "I know
  that what I want is mine, and"&mdash;her pure lips smiled&mdash;"I think I
  want you, Dan."</p>

  <p>It seemed to him, that she changed at that moment. Her beauty was not
  quite as it had been, but somehow more wildly intoxicating than before. He
  realized what it meant; her environment now contained a man she loved, or
  thought she loved, and she was adapting to that, too. She was becoming
  &mdash;he shivered slightly&mdash;irresistible!</p>

  <p>Bach must have realized the situation, but he said nothing. As for Scott,
  it was sheer torture, for he realized only too well that the girl he loved
  was a freak, a biological sport, and worse than that, a cold murderess and a
  creature not exactly human. Yet for the next several days things went
  smoothly. Kyra slipped easily into the routine; she was ever a willing
  subject for their inquiries and investigations.</p>

  <p>Then Scott had an idea. He produced one of the guinea pigs that he had
  injected, and they found that the creature evinced the same reaction as Kyra
  to cuts. They killed the thing by literally cutting it in half with an ax,
  and Bach examined its brain.</p>

  <p>"Right!" he said at last. "It's hypertrophy of the pineal." He stared
  intently at Scott. "Suppose," he said, "that we could reach Kyra's pineal and
  correct the hypertrophy. Do you suppose that might return her to normal?"</p>

  <p>Scott suppressed a pang of fear. "But why? She can't do any harm as long
  as we guard her here. Why do we have to gamble with her life like that?"</p>

  <p>Bach laughed shortly. "For the first time in my life I'm glad I'm an old
  man," he said. "Don't you see we have to do something? She's a menace. She's
  dangerous. Heaven only knows how dangerous. We'll have to try."</p>

  <p>Scott groaned and assented. An hour later, under the pretext of
  experiment, he watched the old man inject five grains of morphia into the
  girl's arm, watched her frown and blink&mdash;and adjust. The drug was
  powerless.</p>

  <p>It was at night that Bach got his next idea. "Ethyl chloride!" he
  whispered. "The instantaneous anesthetic. Perhaps she can't adjust to lack of
  oxygen. We'll try."</p>

  <p>Kyra was asleep. Silently, carefully, the two crept in, and Scott stared
  down in utter fascination at the weird beauty of her features, paler than
  ever in the faint light of midnight. Carefully, so carefully, Bach held the
  cone above her sleeping face, drop by drop he poured the volatile,
  sweet-scented liquid into it. Minutes passed.</p>

  <p>"That should anesthetize an elephant," he whispered at last, and jammed
  the cone full upon her face.</p>

  <p>She awoke. Fingers like slim steel rods closed on his wrist, forcing his
  hand away. Scott seized the cone, and her hand clutched his wrist as well,
  and he felt the strength of her grasp.</p>

  <p>"Stupid," she said quietly, sitting erect. "This is quite useless&mdash;
  look!"</p>

  <p>She snatched a paper knife from the table beside the bed. She bared her
  pale throat to the moonlight, and then, suddenly, drove the knife to its hilt
  into her bosom!</p>

  <p>Scott gulped in horror as she withdrew it. A single spot of blood showed
  on her flesh, she wiped it away, and displayed her skin, pale, unscarred,
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>"Go away," she said softly, and they departed.</p>

  <p>The next day she made no reference to the incident. Scott and Bach spent a
  worried morning in the laboratory, doing no work, but simply talking. It was
  a mistake, for when they returned to the library, she was gone, having,
  according to Mrs. Getz, simply strolled out of the door and away. A hectic
  and hasty search of the adjacent blocks brought no sign of her.</p>

  <p>At dusk she was back, pausing hatless in the doorway to permit Scott, who
  was there alone, to watch the miraculous change as she passed from sunset to
  chamber, and her hair faded from mahogany to aluminum.</p>

  <p>"Hello," she said smiling. "I killed a child."</p>

  <p>"What? My Lord, Kyra!"</p>

  <p>"It was an accident. Surely you don't feel that I should be punished for
  an accident, Dan, do you?"</p>

  <p>He was staring in utter horror. "How&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I decided to walk a bit. After a block or two, it occurred to me that
  I should like to ride. There was a car parked there with the keys in it, and
  the driver was talking on the sidewalk, so I slipped in, started it, and
  drove away. Naturally I drove rather fast, since he was shouting, and at the
  second corner I hit a little boy."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;you didn't stop?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. I drove around the corner, turned another corner or two,
  and then parked the car and walked back. The boy was gone, but the crowd was
  still there. Not one of them noticed me." She smiled her saintlike smile.
  "We're quite safe. They can't possibly trace me."</p>

  <p>Scott dropped his head on his hands and groaned. "I don't know what to
  do!" he muttered. "Kyra, you're going to have to report this to the
  police."</p>

  <p>"But it was an accident," she said gently, her luminous silver eyes
  pityingly on Scott.</p>

  <p>"No matter. You'll have to."</p>

  <p>She placed her white hand on his head. "Perhaps tomorrow," she said. "Dan,
  I have learned something. What one needs in this world is power. As long as
  there are people in the world with more power than I, I run afoul of them.
  They keep trying to punish me with their laws&mdash;and why? Their laws are
  not for me. They cannot punish me."</p>

  <p>He did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Therefore," she said softly, "tomorrow I go out of here to seek power. I
  will be more powerful than any laws."</p>

  <p>That shocked him to action. "Kyra!" he cried. "You're not to try to leave
  here again." He gripped her shoulders. "Promise me! Swear that you'll not
  step beyond that door without me!"</p>

  <p>"Why, if you wish," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"But swear it! Swear it by everything sacred!"</p>

  <p>Her silver eyes looked steadily into his from a face like that of a marble
  angel. "I swear it," she murmured. "By anything you name, I swear it,
  Dan."</p>

  <p>And in the morning she was gone, taking what cash and bills had been in
  Scott's wallet, and in Bach's as well. And, they discovered later, in Mrs.
  Getz's also.</p>

  <p>"But if you could have seen her!" muttered Scott. "She looked straight
  into my eyes and promised, and her face was pure as a madonna's. I can't
  believe she was lying."</p>

  <p>"The lie as an adaptive mechanism," said Bach, "deserves more attention
  than it has received. Probably the original liars are those plants and
  animals that use protective mimicry&mdash;harmless snakes imitating poisonous
  ones, stingless flies that look like bees. Those are living lies."</p>

  <p>"But she couldn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She has, however. What you've told me about her desire for power is proof
  enough. She's entered the second adaptive phase&mdash;that of adapting her
  environment to herself instead of herself to her environment. How far will
  her madness&mdash;or her genius&mdash;carry her? There is very little
  difference between the two, Dan. And what is left now for us to do but
  watch?"</p>

  <p>"Watch? How? Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"Unless I'm badly mistaken, watching her will be easy once she begins to
  achieve. Wherever she is, I think we&mdash;and the rest of the world
  &mdash;will know of it soon enough."</p>

  <p>But weeks dropped away without sign of Kyra Zelas. Scott and Bach returned
  to their duties at Grand Mercy, and down in his laboratory the biochemist
  disposed grimly of the remains of three guinea pigs, a cat, and a dog, whose
  killing had been an exhausting and sickening task. In the crematory as well
  went a tube of water-clear serum.</p>

  <p>Then one day the annunciator summoned him to Bach's office, where he found
  the old man hunched over a copy of the <i>Post Record</i>.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" he said, indicating a political gossip column called "Whirls
  of Washington."</p>

  <p>Scott read, "And the surprise of the evening was the <i>soi-
  disant</i>confirmed bachelor of the cabinet, upright John Callan, who
  fluttered none other than the gorgeous Kyra Zelas, the lady who affects a
  dark wig by day and a white by night. Some of us remember her as the
  acquittee of a murder trial."</p>

  <p>Scott looked up. "Callan, eh? Secretary of the treasury, no less! When she
  said power she meant power, apparently."</p>

  <p>"But will she stop there?" mused Bach gloomily. "I have a premonition that
  she's just beginning."</p>

  <p>"Well, actually, how far can a woman go?"</p>

  <p>The old man looked at him. "A woman? This is Kyra Zelas, Dan. Don't set
  your limits yet. There will be more of her."</p>

  <p>Bach was right. Her name began to appear with increasing frequency, first
  in social connections, then with veiled references to secret intrigues and
  influences.</p>

  <p>Thus: "Whom do the press boys mean by the tenth cabineteer?" Or later:
  "Why not a secretary of personal relations? She has the powers; give her the
  name." And still later: "One has to go back to Egypt for another instance of
  a country whose exchequer was run by a woman. And Cleopatra busted that
  one."</p>

  <p>Scott grinned a little ruefully to himself as he realized that the thrusts
  were becoming more indirect, as if the press itself were beginning to grow
  cautious. It was a sign of increasing power, for nowhere are people as
  sensitive to such trends as among the Washington correspondents. Kyra's
  appearance in the public prints began to be more largely restrained to purely
  social affairs, and usually in connection with John Callan, the
  forty-five-year-old bachelor secretary of the treasury.</p>

  <p>Waking or sleeping, Scott never for a moment quite forgot her, for there
  was something mystical about her, whether she were mad or a woman of genius,
  whether freak or superwoman. The only thing he did forget was a thin girl
  with drab features and greasy black hair who had lain on a pallet in the
  isolation ward and coughed up flecks of blood.</p>

  <p>It was no surprise to either Scott or Dr. Bach to return one evening to
  Bach's residence for a few hours' conversation, and find there, seated as
  comfortably as if she had never left it, Kyra Zelas. Outwardly she had
  changed but little; Scott gazed once more in fascination on her incredible
  hair and wide, innocent silver eyes. She was smoking a cigarette, and she
  exhaled a long, blue plume of smoke and smiled up at him.</p>

  <p>He hardened himself. "Nice of you to honor us," he said coldly. "What's
  the reason for this visit? Did you run out of money?"</p>

  <p>"Money? Of course not. How could I run out of money?"</p>

  <p>"You couldn't, not as long as you replenished your funds the way you did
  when you left."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that!" she said contemptuously. She opened her hand bag, indicating a
  green mass of bills. "I'll give that back, Dan. How much was it?"</p>

  <p>"To hell with the money!" he blazed. "What hurts me is the way you lied.
  Staring into my eyes as innocent as a baby, and lying all the time!"</p>

  <p>"Was I?" she asked. "I won't lie to you again, Dan. I promise."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you," he said bitterly. "Tell us what you're doing here,
  then."</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see you. I haven't forgotten what I said to you, Dan." With
  the words she seemed to grow more beautiful than ever, and this time
  poignantly wistful as well.</p>

  <p>"And have you," asked Bach suddenly, "abandoned your idea of power?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I want power?" she rejoined innocently, flashing her
  magnificent eyes to him.</p>

  <p>"But you said," began Scott impatiently, "that you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did I?" There was a ghost of a smile on her perfect lips. "I won't lie to
  you, Dan," she went on, laughing a little. "If I want power, it is mine for
  the taking&mdash;more power than you dream."</p>

  <p>"Through John Callan?" he rasped.</p>

  <p>"He offers a simple way," she said impassively. "Suppose, for instance,
  that in a day or so he were to issue a statement&mdash;a supremely insulting
  statement&mdash;about the war debts. The administration couldn't afford to
  reprimand him openly, because most of the voters feel that a supremely
  insulting statement is called for. And if it were insulting enough &mdash;and
  I assure you it would be&mdash;you would see the animosity of Europe directed
  westward.</p>

  <p>"Now, if the statement were one that no national government could ignore
  and yet keep its dignity in the eyes of its people, it would provoke counter-
  insults. And there are three nations&mdash;you know their names as well as
  I&mdash;who await only such a diversion of interest. Don't you see?" She
  frowned.</p>

  <p>"How stupid you both are!" she murmured, and then, stretching her glorious
  figure and yawning, "I wonder what sort of empress I would make. A good one,
  doubtless."</p>

  <p>But Scott was aghast. "Kyra, do you mean you'd urge Callan into such a
  colossal blunder as that?"</p>

  <p>"Urge him!" she echoed contemptuously. "I'd force him."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean you'd do it?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't said so," she smiled. She yawned again, and snapped her
  cigarette into the dark fireplace. "I'll stay here a day or two," she added
  pleasantly, rising. "Good night."</p>

  <p>Scott faced Dr. Bach as she vanished into the old man's chamber. "Damn
  her!" he grated, his lips white. "If I believed she meant all of that
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'd better believe it," said Bach.</p>

  <p>"Empress, eh! Empress of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of the world, perhaps. You can't set limits to madness or genius."</p>

  <p>"We've got to stop her!"</p>

  <p>"How? We can't keep her locked up here. In the first place, she'd
  doubtless develop strength enough in her wrists to break the locks on the
  doors, and if she didn't, all she'd need to do is shout for help from a
  window."</p>

  <p>"We can have her adjudged insane!" flared Scott. "We can have her locked
  up where she can't break out or call for help."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we could. We could if we could get her committed by the Sanity
  Commission. And if we got her before them, what chance do you think we'd
  have?"</p>

  <p>"All right, then," said Scott grimly, "we're going to have to find her
  weakness. Her adaptability can't be infinite. She's immune to drugs and
  immune to wounds, but she can't be above the fundamental laws of biology.
  What we have to do is to find the law we need."</p>

  <p>"You find it then," said Bach gloomily.</p>

  <p>"But we've got to do something. At least we can warn people&mdash;" He
  broke off, realizing the utter absurdity of the idea.</p>

  <p>"Warn people!" scoffed Bach. "Against what? We'd be the ones to go before
  the Sanity Commission then. Callan would ignore us with dignity, and Kyra
  would laugh her pretty little laugh of contempt, and that would be that."</p>

  <p>Scott shrugged helplessly. "I'm staying here to-night," he said. "At least
  we can talk to her again tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"If she's still here," remarked Bach ironically.</p>

  <p>But she was. She came out as Scott was reading the morning papers alone in
  the library, and sat silently opposite him, garbed in black silk lounging
  pajamas against which her alabaster skin and incredible hair glowed in
  startling contrast. He watched skin and hair turn faintly golden as the
  morning sun lightened the chamber. Somehow it angered him that she should be
  so beautiful and at the same time deadly with an inhuman deadliness.</p>

  <p>He spoke first. "You haven't committed any murders since our last meeting,
  I hope." He said it spitefully, viciously.</p>

  <p>She was quite indifferent. "Why should I? It has not been necessary."</p>

  <p>"You know, Kyra," he said evenly, "that you ought to be killed."</p>

  <p>"But not by you, Dan. You love me."</p>

  <p>He said nothing. The fact was too obvious to deny.</p>

  <p>"Dan," she said softly, "if you only had my courage, there is no height we
  might not reach together. No height&mdash;if you had the courage to try. That
  is why I came back here, but&mdash;" She shrugged. "I go back to Washington
  tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Later in the day Scott got Bach alone. "She's going tomorrow!" he said
  tensely. "Whatever we can do has to be done to-night."</p>

  <p>The old man gestured helplessly. "What can we do? Can you think of any law
  that limits adaptability?"</p>

  <p>"No, but&mdash;" He paused suddenly. "By Heaven!" he cried. "I can! I've
  got it!"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"The law! A fundamental biological law that must be Kyra's weakness!"</p>

  <p>"But what?"</p>

  <p>"This! No organism can live in its own waste products! Its own waste is
  poison to any living thing!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen. Carbon dioxide is a human waste product. Kyra can't adapt to an
  atmosphere of carbon dioxide!"</p>

  <p>Bach stared. "By Heaven!" he cried. "But even if you're right, how
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. You can get a couple of cylinders of carbonic acid gas
  from Grand Mercy. Can you think of any way of getting the gas into her
  room?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;this is an old house. There's a hole from her room to the one
  I'm using, where the radiator connection goes through. It's not tight; we
  could get a rubber tube past the pipe."</p>

  <p>"Good!"</p>

  <p>"But the windows! She'll have the windows open." "Never mind that," said
  Scott. "See that they're soaped so they'll close easily, that's all."</p>

  <p>"But even if it works, what good&mdash;Dan! You don't mean to kill
  her?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I&mdash;couldn't," he whispered. "But once she's
  helpless, once she's overcome&mdash;if she is&mdash;you'll operate. That
  operation on the pineal you suggested before. And may Heaven forgive me!"</p>

  <p>Scott suffered the tortures of the damned that evening. Kyra was, if
  possible, lovelier than ever, and for the first time she seemed to exert
  herself to be charming. Her conversation was literally brilliant; she
  sparkled, and over and over Scott found himself so fascinated that the
  thought of the treachery he planned was an excruciating pain. It seemed
  almost a blasphemy to attempt violence against one whose outward appearance
  was so pure, so innocent, so saintlike.</p>

  <p>"But she isn't quite&mdash;human!" he told himself. "She's not an angel
  but a female demon, a&mdash;what were they called?&mdash;an incubus!"</p>

  <p>Despite himself, when at last Kyra yawned luxuriously and dropped her
  dainty feet to the floor to depart, he pleaded for a few moments more.</p>

  <p>"But it's early," he said, "and tomorrow you leave."</p>

  <p>"I will return, Dan. This is not the end for us."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," he muttered miserably, watching the door of her room as it
  clicked shut.</p>

  <p>He gazed at Bach. The older man, after a moment's silence, whispered, "It
  is likely that she sleeps almost at once. That's also a matter of
  adaptability."</p>

  <p>In tense silence they watched the thin line of light below the closed
  door. Scott started violently when, after a brief interval, her shadow
  crossed it and it disappeared with a faint click.</p>

  <p>"Now, then," he said grimly. "Let's get it over."</p>

  <p>He followed Bach into the adjacent room. There, cold and metallic, stood
  the gray cylinders of compressed gas. He watched as the old man attached a
  length of tubing, ran it to the opening around the steam pipe, and began to
  pack the remaining space with wet cotton.</p>

  <p>Scott turned to his own task. He moved quietly into the library. With
  utmost stealth he tried the door of Kyra's room; it was unlocked as he had
  known it would be, for the girl was supremely confident of her own
  invulnerability.</p>

  <p>For a long moment he gazed across at the mass of radiant silver hair on
  her pillow, then, very cautiously, he placed a tiny candle on the chair by
  the window, so that it should be at about the level of the bed, lighted it
  with a snap of his cigarette lighter, withdrew the door key, and
  departed.</p>

  <p>He locked the door on the outside, and set about stuffing the crack below
  it with cotton. It was far from airtight, but that mattered little, he mused,
  since one had to allow for the escape of the replaced atmosphere.</p>

  <p>He returned to Bach's room. "Give me a minute," he whispered. "Then turn
  it on."</p>

  <p>He stepped to a window. Outside was a two-foot ledge of stone, and he
  crept to this precarious perch. He was visible from the street below, but not
  markedly noticeable, for he was directly above an areaway between Bach's
  house and its neighbor. He prayed fervently that he might escape
  attention.</p>

  <p>He crept along the ledge. The two windows of Kyra's chamber were wide, but
  Bach had done his work. They slid downward, without a creak, and he pressed
  close against the glass to peer in.</p>

  <p>Across the room glowed the faint and steady flame of his little taper.
  Close beside him, within a short arm's length had no pane intervened, lay
  Kyra, quite visible in the dusk. She lay on her back, with one arm thrown
  above her unbelievable hair, and she had drawn only a single sheet over her.
  He could watch her breathing, quiet, calm, peaceful.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if a long time passed. He fancied at last that he could hear
  the gentle hiss of gas from Bach's window, but he knew that that must be
  fancy. In the chamber he watched there was no sign of anything unusual; the
  glorious Kyra slept as she did everything else&mdash;easily, quietly, and
  confidently.</p>

  <p>Then there was a sign. The little candle flame, burning steadily in the
  draughtless air, flickered suddenly. He watched it, certain now that its
  color was changing. Again it flickered, flared for a moment, then died. A red
  spark glowed on the wick for a bare instant, then that was gone.</p>

  <p>The candle flame was smothered. That meant a concentration of eight or ten
  per cent of carbon dioxide in the room's temperature&mdash;far too high to
  support ordinary life. Yet Kyra was living. Except that her quiet breathing
  seemed to have deepened, she gave not even a sign of inconvenience. She had
  adapted to the decreased oxygen supply.</p>

  <p>But there must be limits to her powers. He blinked into the darkness.
  Surely&mdash;surely her breathing was quickening. He was positive now; her
  breast rose and fell in convulsive gasps, and somewhere in his turbulent mind
  the scientist in him recorded the fact.</p>

  <p>"Cheyne-Stokes breathing," he muttered. In a moment the violence of it
  would waken her.</p>

  <p>It did. Suddenly the silver eyes started open. She brushed her hand across
  her mouth, then clutched at her throat. Aware instantly of danger, she thrust
  herself erect, and her bare legs flashed as she pushed herself from the bed.
  But she must have been dazed, for she turned first to the door.</p>

  <p>He saw the unsteadiness in her movements. She twisted the doorknob, tugged
  frantically, then whirled toward the window. He could see her swaying as she
  staggered through the vitiated air, but she reached it. Her face was close to
  his, but he doubted if she saw him, for her eyes were wide and frightened,
  and her mouth and throat were straining violently for breath. She raised her
  hand to smash the pane; the blow landed, but weakly, and the window shook but
  did not shatter.</p>

  <p>Again her arm rose, but that blow was never delivered. For a moment she
  stood poised, swaying slowly, then her magnificent eyes misted and closed,
  she dropped to her knees, and at last collapsed limply on the floor.</p>

  <p>Scott waited a long, torturing moment, then thrust up the window. The rush
  of lifeless air sent him whirling dizzily on his dangerous perch, and he
  clutched the casement. Then a slow breeze moved between the buildings, and
  his head cleared.</p>

  <p>He stepped gingerly into the chamber. It was stifling, but near the open
  window he could breathe. He kicked thrice against Bach's wall.</p>

  <p>The hiss of gas ceased. He gathered Kyra's form in his arms, waited until
  he heard the key turn, then dashed across the room and into the library.</p>

  <p>Bach stared as if fascinated at the pure features of the girl. "A goddess
  overcome," he said. "There is something sinful about our part in this."</p>

  <p>"Be quick!" snapped Scott. "She's unconscious, not anesthetized. God knows
  how quickly she'll readjust."</p>

  <p>But she had not yet recovered when Scott laid her on the operating table
  in Bach's office, and drew the straps about her arms and body and slim bare
  legs. He looked down on her still, white face and bright hair, and he felt
  his heart contract with pain to see them darken ever so faintly and
  beautifully under the brilliant operating light, rich in actinic rays.</p>

  <p>"You were right," he whispered to the unhearing girl. "Had I your courage
  there is nothing we might not have attained together."</p>

  <p>Bach spoke brusquely. "Nasal?" he asked. "Or shall I trephine her?"</p>

  <p>"Nasal."</p>

  <p>"But I should like a chance to observe the pineal gland. This case is
  unique, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nasal!" blazed Scott. "I won't have her scarred!"</p>

  <p>Bach sighed and began. Scott, despite his long hospital experience, found
  himself quite unable to watch this operation; he passed the old man his
  instruments as needed, but kept his eyes averted from the girl's passive and
  lovely face.</p>

  <p>"So!" said Bach at last. "It is done." For the first time he himself had a
  moment's leisure to survey Kyra's features.</p>

  <p>Bach started violently. Gone was the exquisite aluminum hair, replaced by
  the stringy, dark, and oily locks of the girl in the hospital! He pried open
  her eye, silver no longer, but pallid blue. Of all her loveliness, there
  remained&mdash;what? A trace, perhaps; a trace in the saintlike purity of her
  pale face, and in the molding of her features. But a flame had died; she was
  a goddess no longer, but a mortal&mdash;a human being. The superwoman had
  become no more than a suffering girl.</p>

  <p>An ejaculation had almost burst from his lips when Scott's voice stopped
  him.</p>

  <p>"How beautiful she is!" he whispered. Bach stared. He realized suddenly
  that Scott was not seeing her as she was, but as she once had been. To his
  eyes, colored by love, she was still Kyra the magnificent.</p>
