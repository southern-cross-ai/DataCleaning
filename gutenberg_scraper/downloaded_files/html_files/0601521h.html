  <h2><a id="ch01"
     name="ch01">1.</a> &mdash; A DIFFICULT PROJECT</h2>

  <p class="first">"We've got to win that reward, Roger, or close up shop."</p>

  <p>Ted Dustin, youthful president and general manager of Theodore Dustin,
  Inc., reached mechanically for his tobacco pouch, filled his black briar, and
  sighed.</p>

  <p>Roger Sanders, assistant to the president, deposited his sheaf of papers
  on his desk, closed the door to the private office, and sat down in the chair
  facing his superior.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I mean," replied Dustin, flicking his lighter with his thumb, "that in
  order to prepare the projectile for launching, we've spent every cent we had,
  and borrowed a lot besides. Theodore Dustin, Inc., is flat broke, and the
  plant is mortgaged from roof to drains. If we don't win that reward our
  creditors will be picking our bones in thirty days."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dustin." A female voice, apparently issuing from empty air, spoke his
  name. He turned to the radiovisiphone, a plain looking disc resting on a
  small pedestal at his elbow. It was wireless, and contained no buttons,
  levers or controls of any kind.</p>

  <p>"Yes." As he spoke, the picture of his information clerk flashed on the
  disc. The word "Yes" had completed the connection.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Evans of the 'Globe' would like to know if you are ready to interview
  the representatives of the press."</p>

  <p>"Any other reporters waiting?"</p>

  <p>"There are twenty-seven in the reception room. Mr. Evans says you told
  them all to come at once."</p>

  <p>"I did," replied Dustin. "Send them up in five minutes. Off."</p>

  <p>When he spoke the word "Off," the picture disappeared, the connection
  having been broken by this word uttered alone with sharp emphasis.</p>

  <p>While Roger went out for chairs, he rose and walked to the window. For
  some time he stood there, gazing at the smokeless, chimney-less factories
  beneath him. During twenty of the thirty years of his life, or until 1954,
  there had been chimneys on these factories. Combustion&mdash;the burning of
  coal and oil&mdash;had been necessary to keep their wheels turning.</p>

  <p>But Dustin had changed all this by his invention which economically
  captured and stored the energy of the sun, converting it into electricity for
  light, heat and power, and putting manufacturing on a newer, cleaner basis.
  Now, at the age of thirty, he had lived to see his sun power units in almost
  universal use.</p>

  <p>The money derived from this he had immediately diverted to research and
  experiment with a still mightier objective in view&mdash;to harness the power
  of the atom. On the eve of success he found his funds nearly dissipated, and
  therefore spent his last few dollars in the building of an emplacement, a
  gun, and a projectile, for the purpose of winning the million dollar reward
  offered by the Associated Governments of the Earth to the man who could first
  succeed in touching the moon with a finger of terrestrial matter.</p>

  <p>He turned from the window as Roger ushered in a group of eager, expectant
  reporters, and said:</p>

  <p>"Take seats, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>Twenty-eight chairs creaked. Twenty-eight automatic interview recorders
  were quickly swung forward on their shoulder straps and adjusted. Then there
  was a tense moment of silence.</p>

  <p>Ted cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"You fellows know," he said, "that science, having conquered the air, now
  wants to conquer interplanetary space. The first logical step is the shortest
  one. The nearest heavenly body being our moon, and that being far enough away
  to present a pretty tough problem, the princely reward of a million dollars
  has been offered the man who will first send a projectile or vehicle across
  this space and prove it to the satisfaction of the Associated Governments of
  the Earth.</p>

  <p>"Through some mysterious channel of communication, known only to you
  reporters, you found out that I had entered the race. Naturally I have, up
  until now, kept my plans a secret from the public and my competitors. But
  that's all over with, now. The gun, which was constructed according to my
  specifications by the American Ordnance Corporation, has a bore of seven feet
  and a length of three hundred and fifty. Despite the fact that it will be
  reinforced to more than four times the proportionate thickness of the most
  powerful guns built today, my estimates show that it will be destroyed when
  the projectile is fired. It was shipped to Daphne Major, one of the smaller
  of the Galapagos Islands near the equator, on March 10th. My projectile,
  which was manufactured in my own factory, was shipped today, fully assembled
  and crated, in an International Air Freighter.</p>

  <p>"I've calculated that March 20th will be the most favorable day for firing
  my projectile, as it will be the day when the moon, in its endless race with
  our planet around the sun, will cross the path of the earth. The projectile
  will be timed and fired to overcome the forward speed and gravity pull of the
  earth, travel in the arc imparted to it by the earth's axial rotation, and
  wait for the moon at precisely the right point in space, according to my
  calculations. Its principle will greatly resemble that of the floating mines
  dropped by minelayers in the World War of forty years ago.</p>

  <p>"The force which will send the projectile out into space is one which I
  have, after countless experiments, succeeded in liberating and, to some
  extent, directing. It's the terrific force locked in the atom.</p>

  <p>"The motions of the projectile, after it has left the earth, will be
  automatically controlled and corrected by my latest invention, the atomotor,
  a mechanism which separates electrons from protons and utilizes the terrific
  repulsive force of protons toward protons and electrons toward electrons,
  permitting them to escape through specially constructed cylinders after they
  have imparted their energy to the cylinder heads and thence to the
  projectile. These cylinders are pointed in all directions, thus making it
  possible for the automatic course-corrector to control the motions of the
  projectile.</p>

  <p>"The projectile will be protected at the base by a firing plate of easily
  melted metal, which will be destroyed before it leaves the earth's
  atmosphere. It will also be protected by six outer layers of reinforced
  asbestos with braced vacuum spaces between them.</p>

  <p>"In the head of the projectile is a charge of explosive which will be set
  off by contact with any solid object. This powerful explosive will, when
  ignited, emit a lurid flash of light that will be easily visible if it
  strikes the dark side of the moon, and also a thick cloud of black,
  non-luminous smoke that will spread over a circle a hundred miles in diameter
  will be readily discernible if it strikes the light side.</p>

  <p>"On tomorrow, the sixteenth, I leave for Daphne Major for the purpose of
  loading and pointing the gun."</p>

  <p>"That's all there is to the story, fellows, until after the gun is
  fired."</p>

  <p>Roger opened the door, and the reporters, after wishing the young inventor
  success, filed out.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch02"
     name="ch02">2.</a> &mdash; LAUNCHED</h2>

  <p class="first">On the morning of March 16th, Dustin and Sanders set out for
  the Galapagos in the former's swift Blettendorf super-electroplane, which was
  capable of a speed of eight hundred miles an hour. They arrived about noon
  and worked assiduously, with the result that the gun was loaded and ready for
  the Herculean task of lowering it into the emplacement by night.</p>

  <p>On the seventeenth it was pointed according to the calculations of the
  young inventor, and on the eighteenth was braced in place by hundreds of tons
  of special, fast-setting, reinforced concrete.</p>

  <p>On the nineteenth the U.S. Aerial Battleship Hawaii arrived with a group
  of trained observers, representing the Associated Governments of the Earth.
  She was equipped with high power telescopes, spectroscopes, and photographic
  apparatus, all to be used by or under the direction of this assembly of
  picked scientists.</p>

  <p>Busy as he was in getting his men and equipment loaded and away from the
  danger zone, Dustin was compelled to hold a reception for his distinguished
  visitors, show them the gun and its emplacement, and answer a thousand
  questions. Sanders, however, assumed the burdens of the executive to such
  good purpose that before the scientists had boarded the Hawaii to be taken to
  their point of observation and there await the zero hour, he had everything
  loaded and off the island.</p>

  <p>All that night, and up until one thirty on the twentieth, the inventor
  busied himself connecting the automatic firing apparatus and seeing that it
  was in perfect order.</p>

  <p>By that time, Dustin, Sanders and Bevans, the pilot, were the only humans
  left in the archipelago. After a cold lunch and a final tour of inspection,
  each man made ready to play his part.</p>

  <p>It was estimated that the moon would cross the path of the earth at 6
  hours, 53 minutes and 13 seconds past noon, central standard time. This
  brought the firing time to 2 hours, 32 minutes and 22 seconds past noon, or
  approximately 2:30 P.M.</p>

  <p>Promptly at 2:20, Bevans started the helicopter blades and rising above
  the rim of the crater headed northwest toward the point on the equator, 97
  1/2 degrees west longitude, which it was thought would be most favorable for
  observation, and to which the scientists had gone the evening before. This
  was less than a forty minute run for the powerful super-electroplane.</p>

  <p>As they hurtled along, Ted glanced, from time to time, at the chronometer.
  At 2:30 he hastily unslung his binoculars, opened the rear window and trained
  them in the direction of Daphne Major.</p>

  <p>"Can't see the island from here, can you?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly. It's a good two hundred and fifty miles back and we couldn't
  possibly rise high enough to bring it to our horizon line."</p>

  <p>"Then what do you expect to see?"</p>

  <p>"Some sign of the explosion, possibly. Take a look for yourself."</p>

  <p>While Roger trained his own binoculars rearward, Ted called up to
  Bevans:</p>

  <p>"Start the smoke trail at 2:35," he ordered, "and watch for aerial waves.
  We may be in for a good shaking up."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir."</p>

  <p>At 2:32, Ted and Roger sat with bated breath, their binoculars directed
  toward the archipelago, listening intently while the chronometer ticked off
  the seconds.</p>

  <p>The zero hour arrived and for two seconds thereafter the anxious watchers
  saw nothing. Then, with amazing suddenness, a gray, mushroom-shaped cloud
  spread skyward above the horizon. Just above it, a thin pencil of smoke was
  barely discernible through the glasses, pointing straight toward the
  zenith.</p>

  <p>"Hurray! She's off!" shouted Roger.</p>

  <p>Ted did not answer. His face grew suddenly grave.</p>

  <p>"Why, what's the matter?" asked Roger. "Isn't everything all right?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we've started something we didn't consider in our
  calculations," he replied. "Do you see that black cloud forcing its way
  upward through the gray one?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And the band of yellow immediately beneath it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"A volcanic eruption," replied Ted. "Daphne Major, you will remember, was
  the crater of an extinct volcano. We've blown off the top, and outraged
  Mother Earth is doing the rest. Appears like a terrific eruption from here,
  too. And look: There's a reply from the heavens. See those flashes in the
  clouds? A thunder storm has formed in the upper regions."</p>

  <p>At this moment thick, black smoke began belching from the rear of the
  electroplane, and their view to the rear was obscured.</p>

  <p>"Full speed ahead, Bevans," shouted Ted. "Give her all you've got. We're
  due for a heavy squall in less than five minutes."</p>

  <p>Shortly thereafter, signs of terrific agitation in the atmosphere were
  registered in the rear of the smoke trail.</p>

  <p>"Ascend at an angle of 45 degrees," ordered Ted. "We'll ride with the
  gale."</p>

  <p>Scarcely had he spoken ere the plane received such a shock that both Ted
  and Roger were thrown to the floor. It was accompanied by a continuous roar
  as of a thousand thunderclaps let loose at once, echoing and re-echoing with
  seemingly undiminished intensity for several minutes.</p>

  <p>Rising with difficulty, for the ship careened frightfully, Ted dragged
  himself to the rear window and looked out. Their smoke trail had been
  completely dissipated, and once more he had a clear view toward the rear. Two
  things he noted, almost simultaneously&mdash;a mountainous; white-crested
  wall of water swiftly overtaking them on the surface of the Pacific, and just
  above it a swirling, tumbling mass of clouds, black beneath and silvery white
  above, with vivid flashes of forked lightning playing between them. He
  shouted up the speaking tube:</p>

  <p>"Higher, Bevans. Use your helicopters, man, or we're lost!"</p>

  <p>There was a jerk and a roar as Bevans hastily threw the helicopters into
  gear, then a rapid upward movement that glued them to the floor until their
  bodies had gained momentum.</p>

  <p>Quick though he had been in carrying out orders, the pilot was not quick
  enough for the forces of Nature. As if incensed at this puny attempt of man
  to conquer her, she seized the frail craft in the grasp of her powerful winds
  and played with it as if it had been a feather. At the first impact, Ted saw
  Roger strike his head on the edge of the refrigerator and slump to the floor.
  He tried to go to him, but found this impossible. The craft dipped dizzily,
  spun like a top, and rolled end over end. Gripping the doorknob, unable to
  help his fallen companion, he found his feet sometimes in midair, sometimes
  on the wall, and sometimes on the very ceiling. There was an unending glare
  of lightning and a continuous roar of thunder. Rain, sleet, and ice pellets
  alternately beat in through the unclosed rear window.</p>

  <p>The craft steadied a bit for an instant, and Ted succeeded in seizing
  Roger's ankle. Dragging the limp form of his companion toward him, he passed
  his arm beneath the slender body and held it as best he could, meanwhile
  keeping a tight grip on the doorknob. Though the storm continued outside,
  Bevans seemed to be getting the plane under control once more, for it rocked
  less and less as time went on.</p>

  <p>Presently, too, the lightning flashes appeared farther apart, and the
  intervening darkness grew steadily lighter.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was able to release his grip on the doorknob, Ted gently
  lowered his assistant to the floor of the disordered cabin. Switching on the
  light, he made a hasty examination of the gash in the pale forehead and
  found, to his relief, that there was no skull fracture. After carefully
  dressing it from the contents of the emergency kit, he placed a pillow
  beneath the head of the still unconscious Roger, and made his way to the rear
  window. At a glance, he saw that they had risen above the electrical storm,
  but were still beneath a dense cloud stratum that shut off the sunlight like
  a blanket. He shouted up to the pilot:</p>

  <p>"All right, Bevans?"</p>

  <p>"Sound as a dollar, sir."</p>

  <p>"Good. Keep those helicopters going and see if we can get up into the
  sunlight."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>Roger moaned feebly, then opened his eyes as Ted bent over him.</p>

  <p>"Wh-what happened?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You were knocked out. Nothing dangerous. Be all right soon. Want
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"Cigarette."</p>

  <p>"Sure thing. Here."</p>

  <p>Ted placed it between the ashen lips and fired it with his atomic
  lighter.</p>

  <p>"Lie still for a while," he counseled. "I'm going to try to make some
  observations if we can ever get above these confounded clouds."</p>

  <p>It was some time before the welcome flash of sunlight appeared. After
  making his observations, Ted calculated that they had been driven more than
  three hundred miles southwest of their course by the storm. When the plane
  was once more headed toward the point where they hoped to find the Hawaii, he
  descended the stairway to see what he could do for Roger. He found him in one
  of the cabin chairs, curiously examining a film of dust that had formed on
  the map-table.</p>

  <p>"Where do you suppose that came from?" he asked, poking it with his
  finger.</p>

  <p>"Volcanic ash," replied Dustin. "Sometimes travels clear around the world,
  so we needn't be surprised to find it here after that huge upheaval. How's
  the head feeling now, old man?"</p>

  <p>"Better, thanks."</p>

  <p>"Good. We'll just have time for a cold snack before we board the
  Hawaii."</p>

  <p>As soon as they had eaten, Ted took food up to the pilot and steered the
  ship while he ate.</p>

  <p>"Nearly there, aren't we, sir?" asked Bevans, after he had swallowed the
  last morsel.</p>

  <p>"Almost. I'll give you the signal to descend, from the cabin. We're going
  to need our searchlight, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>Once more in the cabin, Ted consulted his instruments. Presently he gave
  the order to descend. In a moment they were plunged into deep gloom which the
  mighty searchlights failed to penetrate for more than fifty feet in any
  direction.</p>

  <p>"We'll never find them this way," said Ted. "Try the radio, Roger, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>Sanders sat down in front of the powerful instrument and turned the
  dials.</p>

  <p>"She's dead," he announced. "That electrical storm must have burned out
  something."</p>

  <p>"Here. You keep watch while I see what's wrong," replied Ted.</p>

  <p>It only took the inventor a moment to find the trouble.</p>

  <p>"Burned out every tube," he said, "and I forgot to bring a spare set.
  We'll just have to keep cruising around, I guess, and hope for luck. A nice
  mess we've gotten into."</p>

  <p>"For my part I'm thankful to be alive, radio or no radio," said Roger.</p>

  <p>"Righto, but I'll certainly be disappointed if I can't be aboard the
  Hawaii with those official observers when the projectile strikes the moon. We
  may be able to see it with our binoculars, but I doubt it."</p>

  <p>As they cruised about in ever widening circles, the time slipped away, but
  there was no sign of the Hawaii. Presently, when the chronometer showed 6:20
  Ted gave up the search and ordered Bevans to hurry back to the designated
  observation point. They barely reached it at 6:50, and another minute was
  consumed in rising above the highest cloud stratum.</p>

  <p>The sun had set and the half-illumined orb of the moon was just above the
  western horizon. Both men trained their binoculars on it simultaneously. Came
  6:53 and they waited tensely for the thirteenth second, at which instant the
  projectile was calculated to strike.</p>

  <p>The thirteenth second came and went without incident. The fourteenth
  &mdash;and then&mdash;directly in the center of the celestial target things
  happened. Both men simultaneously saw a tiny light flash for an instant
  across the dark side of the moon's sunrise line, while a small black spot
  slowly grew in size on the sunlit side of the line.</p>

  <p>"Hurray! She hit dead center!" shouted Roger.</p>

  <p>Ted watched the black spot in silence for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Seems to have landed plumb in the middle of the crater, Hipparchus,"
  replied Ted. "Thought I had miscalculated the time, for an instant, but I see
  the reason now. We saw the flash just 1.25 seconds after it took place
  because it takes light that long to travel from the moon to the earth."</p>

  <p>The black spot faded perceptibly. In a minute more it had disappeared
  completely.</p>

  <p>"There goes our evidence," said Ted. "I hope they saw it while it
  lasted."</p>

  <p>He called up through the speaking tube:</p>

  <p>"Back to Chicago, Bevans."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch03"
     name="ch03">3.</a> &mdash; STARTLING RESULTS</h2>

  <p class="first">When Dustin reached his office in Chicago, he found a terse
  radiogram from the commander of the U.S. Aerial Battleship, Alaska, awaiting
  him.</p>

  <p>Just found the Hawaii, wrecked on surface of Pacific with radio out of
  commission. Official observers unable to see moon on account of clouds. Am
  towing the Hawaii to San Francisco. J. C. Farrell, Commander, U.S.A.B.
  Alaska.</p>

  <p>He read it in silence, then handed it to Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Does this mean that we lose, Ted?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It means," replied Ted gamely trying to disguise the quiver of
  disappointment in his voice, "that Theodore Dustin, Inc., will be sold for
  the benefit of creditors&mdash;lock, stock and barrel, within the next thirty
  days."</p>

  <p>During the days that followed, Ted and Roger were kept busy putting the
  affairs of the company in order, preparatory to turning it over to its
  creditors. At the final moment their attorney bad secured them an extra
  thirty day extension, but this, after all, was only a prolonging of the
  agony.</p>

  <p>A Russian manufacturer had made the highest bid for the plant and patents,
  and sorrow prevailed in the entire organization when it was announced that
  the creditors would, in all probability, accept the bid.</p>

  <p>The indignant official observers had, as Ted had predicted, unanimously
  declared against even a probability that his projectile had struck the moon.
  True, an unofficial observer in Guatemala had reported seeing a flash and a
  dark cloud near the crater Herschel at the appointed time, but this statement
  was unsupported from other quarters and, therefore, of no value to Ted's
  claims.</p>

  <p>The eruption and storm had made it impossible for the South American
  observatories to view the moon at all at that time, while all other
  observatories so situated as to have even slight opportunity for a glimpse at
  the proper moment, reported exceptionally cloudy weather.</p>

  <p>On the morning of May 5th, Dustin sat moodily in his private office,
  surrounded by a thick cloud of blue smoke from his black briar, when Sanders
  burst into the room waving a newspaper which he thrust beneath the eyes of
  his employer.</p>

  <p>"Can you beat this, Ted?" he asked. "They say your projectile came back to
  the earth and nearly destroyed London!" Ted read the screaming headline, and
  gasped.</p>

  <p class="headline">TERRIFIC EXPLOSION NEAR LONDON!<br>
  MAY BE DUSTIN PROJECTILE RETURNED TO EARTH</p>

  <p class="newspaper">At four thirty this morning a huge missile fell into the
  Thames River near Gravesend. It exploded with terrible force, killing more
  than fourteen hundred people, and injuring thousands. The shock of the
  explosion was felt all over the British Isles as well as on continental
  Europe, and was registered by seismographs all over the world.</p>

  <p>Scientists have calculated that the projectile fired by the inventor,
  Theodore Dustin, would return to the earth in thirty days, but they now
  believe it must have traveled in a larger orbit than they estimated, and that
  this is the missile of Dustin returning later than predicted.</p>

  <p>Ted pushed the paper aside wearily.</p>

  <p>"The 'I told you so' boys are at it again, Roger," he said. "They make me
  sick. In order to prove a pet theory, they're trying to make a wholesale
  murderer of me in the eyes of the world. I'm weary of it all."</p>

  <p>Then a voice suddenly issued from the radiovisiphone. It was the
  operator.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dustin." "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Station WNB-437 announces that it is about to broadcast important
  international news. Shall I tune it in for you?"</p>

  <p>"Please."</p>

  <p>A picture instantly flashed on the disc of the radiovisiphone&mdash;the
  announcer for the World News Broadcasters, standing in the station at
  Washington, D.C. He held a paper in one hand, and a watch in the other,
  evidently waiting for the exact second to begin his announcement. Presently
  he cleared his throat and looked up.</p>

  <p>"We have just received a communication from Paris, France," he announced.
  "A projectile similar to that which fell in the Thames near Gravesend has
  fallen into the heart of Paris. The city is in ruins and there has been a
  terrific loss of life, unestimated at this time. This shock, like the one
  which came a few hours ago, has been recorded by seismographs all over the
  world. Scientists who hold that the previous explosion was caused by the
  Dustin projectile have issued no statements regarding this one. No one we
  have consulted can offer any explanation of this singular and terrible
  occurrence."</p>

  <p>The announcer paused, then turned to receive a new sheet of paper from a
  messenger.</p>

  <p>"The situation with regard to these projectiles is becoming more serious
  every minute," he said. "I have here a radio message from New York City. A
  third missile has just fallen into New York Harbor, sinking or destroying all
  shipping in the vicinity, killing and maiming thousands of people, and
  shattering glass in the windows for miles around. Two Broadway skyscrapers
  are reported to have toppled to the street, adding to the shambles as panic-
  stricken people scurrying for shelter were crushed in the ruins."</p>

  <p>Again the announcer paused to receive a new sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>"A message from Professor Fowler of the Yerkes Observatory states that he
  was looking at the moon this morning between the hours of one and four
  o'clock, and that during that period he saw five distinct and quite brilliant
  flashes of light in the region of the crater, Ptolemy. He has just learned of
  the explosions at London, Paris and New York, and thinks that they may have
  some connection with what he saw on the moon early this morning. It is his
  theory that the moon is suffering from a bombardment similar to that which
  the earth is undergoing."</p>

  <p>The picture of the announcer suddenly disappeared from the disc and that
  of Dustin's operator appeared.</p>

  <p>"I had to tune out WNB-437, sir," she apologized. "The President of the
  United States is calling."</p>

  <p>"Tune him in," replied Dustin.</p>

  <p>Instantly there flashed on the disc the familiar countenance of President
  Whitmore. He looked worried, and his voice trembled slightly as he asked:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dustin, have you any explanation of the calamities that have
  overtaken the world in the last few hours?"</p>

  <p>"I have no facts for you at present, Mr. President," replied Dustin, "but
  I have a theory."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?"</p>

  <p>"It is my belief that the moon is bombarding the earth. She reached an
  advantageous firing position last night, and Professor Fowler saw five
  flashes between one and four o'clock this morning. According to my theory she
  left five huge interplanetary mines in the path of the earth and we have
  already run afoul of three of them. Moreover, they were aimed and timed with
  such accuracy that one of our chief cities has been destroyed and two more
  came near to meeting the same fate."</p>

  <p>"You have stated that your projectile struck the moon. Do you believe that
  our satellite is inhabited, and that the explosions we have experienced were
  mines or missiles, fired in reprisal by the lunar inhabitants?"</p>

  <p>"That is my belief, Mr. President."</p>

  <p>"Then, Mr. Dustin, you are jointly responsible with the Associated
  Governments of the Earth for this horrible and unexpected catastrophe, and we
  shall look to you to see that the bombardment is stopped."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I am without funds, and my company is to be
  taken from me by my creditors in a few days."</p>

  <p>"This, Mr. Dustin," replied the President, "is an international emergency,
  and must be met with every ounce of power at our command. We need
  you&mdash;the world needs you and your organization. Draw on the government
  for such funds as you require at once, and I will issue an order on the
  treasury for sufficient funds to satisfy every one of your creditors.</p>

  <p>"At present I can only promise you the cooperation of our own government,
  but I am calling a meeting of the Associated Governments today, and I feel
  sure they will be with us. Do all you can, as quickly as you can, and spare
  no expense to carry the thing through as swiftly as possible."</p>

  <p>"I'll do my best, Mr. President," replied Ted.</p>

  <p>The picture of the President faded from the disc, and Roger rose from his
  seat, his face aglow with enthusiasm for this new undertaking.</p>

  <p>"Atta boy, Ted!" he said. "When do we start? And how?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch04"
     name="ch04">4.</a> &mdash; MOON PEOPLE</h2>

  <p class="first">On the following day the factory of Theodore Dustin, Inc.,
  hummed with an activity it had not known for weeks.</p>

  <p>The fact that Ted's prediction regarding the other two missiles from the
  moon had come true shortly after he had uttered them, solidified public
  confidence in him to a degree even greater than that he had enjoyed before
  the firing of his own projectile and his subsequent condemnation by the
  official observers.</p>

  <p>The last two missiles to strike the earth had apparently not been aimed so
  accurately as the others, but the intent of those who fired them had been
  just as evident, for one had plumped into the middle of Lake Michigan, not
  far from Chicago, and the other had alighted in the Tyrrhenian Sea near Rome,
  both causing tidal waves and some damage to shipping, but without the large
  number of fatalities which attended the falls of the others.</p>

  <p>There were people, of course, who condemned Ted for having fired his
  projectile to the moon and thus having brought about the bombardment in
  reprisal&mdash;a bombardment which, for all they knew, might take place every
  month at the time the moon was in a favorable firing position.</p>

  <p>None there were, however, who condemned the youthful scientist so
  thoroughly as he condemned himself. Not that he spent his time, or any part
  of it, in self-reproach. There was, in fact, no time for anything but work,
  with the busy program he had set for himself and his men.</p>

  <p>Two major projects, both being carried on at once, claimed every minute of
  his waking time. One was the building of a gigantic radio station, with which
  he hoped to get into communication with the inhabitants of the moon. The
  other, the construction of an interplanetary vehicle driven by atomotors, in
  which he hoped to reach the moon in person. The radio, he expected to have
  ready for service in two weeks, but the vehicle, because the manufacture of
  many of its delicate and intricate parts could only be entrusted to a few of
  his best men, would take six weeks to complete at the very least.</p>

  <p>During the first three days and nights he worked without sleep. Then
  outraged nature asserted itself, and he was compelled to rest. From then
  until the day of the completion of the radio station, he put himself on a
  sleep ration of four hours a day.</p>

  <p>On May 19th, just two weeks after the projectiles from the moon had struck
  the earth, and nearly two months from the day Dustin's projectile had
  exploded on the moon, there was a large and august assemblage in the general
  office of Theodore Dustin, Inc.</p>

  <p>Forty of the world's leading linguists, representing every race and color
  on the globe, talked excitedly in a multiplicity of tongues. Nor were modern
  languages solely represented, for there was a small group of men whose life
  studies had been the forgotten languages of the past-men who had wrested from
  crypts, pyramids, monuments, caves, and the ruins of ancient cities, temples
  and fortresses, the secrets of the speech of the ancients.</p>

  <p>Nor were these all. A still smaller group consisted of the greatest men of
  science, sent by the leading nations of the earth.</p>

  <p>From time to time, they glanced expectantly at the door of Dustin's
  private office.</p>

  <p>Presently the door opened and Dustin stepped out, accompanied by President
  Whitmore of the United States.</p>

  <p>Instantly the buzz of conversation ceased, as Ted held his hand aloft for
  silence.</p>

  <p>"We are ready, gentlemen," he announced. "Follow me to the elevators."</p>

  <p>Three trips of the elevators landed everyone on the roof. In the center
  was a building containing the sending and receiving apparatus. Overhead were
  stretched the wires of the gigantic aerial.</p>

  <p>Ted conducted his party to the doorway of the building and into a small
  auditorium with seats and desks arranged in a semicircle. Here Sanders met
  them and assisted Ted in showing each man to the desk which had been provided
  for him.</p>

  <p>When all were seated, Ted and Roger pulled back two sliding doors which
  disclosed a small stage and a radiovisiphone with a disc ten feet in
  diameter, which faced the gathering.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. President," said Ted, "if you will do us the honor of pressing
  the button on the desk before you, you will close the circuit of the set
  through which we hope to establish communication with the inhabitants of the
  moon. The zero hour has arrived. In accordance with the orders of the
  Associated Governments of the Earth, every broadcasting station in the world
  has ceased to function."</p>

  <p>The President smiled and pressed the button. A terrific crackling roar
  from the radiovisiphone followed his action.</p>

  <p>Ted speedily adjusted a set of dials on the desk before him, and the roar
  subsided. Then he stepped before the radiovisiphone.</p>

  <p>"People of the Moon," he said, "we know not in what language to address
  you, so we are about to speak to you in all the known languages of the earth.
  Our mission is one of peace&mdash;our purpose to make apology for having
  wronged you&mdash;a people of whom we know nothing, and whose very existence
  we did not suspect. Will you answer us, People of the Moon?"</p>

  <p>The young inventor evidently did not expect a reply&mdash;not so soon, at
  least. He turned, and beckoned to the German linguist to take his place. It
  was his purpose to have the speech repeated in each language in turn. About
  to step down from the platform, he was startled by sudden cries of amazement
  from the men facing him.</p>

  <p>"Look, Ted! Look quickly, behind you!" he heard Roger shout.</p>

  <p>As he faced the radiovisiphone once more, it was his turn to gasp in
  astonishment not unmingled with awe, for revealed in the pellucid depths of
  the ten foot disk, and apparently not five feet from him, stood a
  woman&mdash;a glorious vision of feminine beauty that held him entranced.</p>

  <p>She was not large&mdash;a scant five feet in height, he judged&mdash; but
  there was a certain dignity in her bearing which somehow made her appear
  taller. The golden glory that was her hair, dressed in a style new and
  strange to the inventor, was held by a band of platinum-like metal powdered
  with glistening jewels. Her clothing, if judged by earthly standards, was not
  clothing at all. Gleaming meshes of white metal, woven closely together,
  formed a light, shimmering garment that covered though it revealed the lines
  of her shapely breasts, slender waist, and lissome hips, leaving arms,
  shoulders and legs bare. A jeweled dagger hung from a chain-like belt about
  her waist, and a huge ruby blazed on the index finger of her left hand. On
  her feet were sandals, apparently constructed from the white metal.</p>

  <p>Behind the young lady whose appearance had so amazed the distinguished
  gathering of scientists, stood two men, each well over six feet tall. They
  appeared to be guards, for each leaned on the hilt of a huge, broad-bladed,
  scimitar-like weapon that reached from the floor to the level of his breast,
  and both wore shining plate armor and helmets of strange design.</p>

  <p>The girl smiled, revealing at the same time, a set of small, even white
  teeth, and a most adorable pair of dimples. Then she spoke. Ted stood like
  one bewitched, listening to the clear, flute-like tones, but Roger had the
  presence of mind to turn on the recorder.</p>

  <p>She had not spoken more than a dozen words, however, when the image in the
  disc blurred and her voice was drowned by a confusion of discordant
  sounds.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" asked the President of the United States, anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Another station cutting in, damn it!" replied Ted, frantically turning
  his wave-trap dial with one hand and the selector dials with the other.</p>

  <p>While he labored with the dials an image seemed slowly to be forming in
  the disc, taking the place of the one which had just disappeared. For a time,
  two voices were heard, one unmistakably that of the girl, growing fainter and
  fainter, the other, the coarse tones of a man, constantly increasing in
  intensity.</p>

  <p>As the new image cleared, it proved to be that of a man of remarkable
  dimensions-with a body that was almost globular, to which were attached
  incongruously slender arms and legs. Although he could not have been more
  than five feet tall, his round head was nearly twice as large as that of the
  average earth man of six feet. His nose was fiat, and his eyes slanted toward
  his temples above exceptionally prominent cheek bones. As he spoke in
  sing-song monosyllables, he disclosed rat-like teeth, set far apart, and
  wobbled a long, thin moustache, the two ends of which drooped from the
  corners of his mouth to his breast.</p>

  <p>On his head was a tall pointed helmet of gleaming yellow metal, built up
  in tiers like a pagoda and ending in a sharp spike. His body was encased in
  scale-like armor of the same yellow metal, and his breast was crossed by two
  purple sashes, fastened at their intersection by a golden medallion on which
  was emblazoned a scarlet dragon. From one of these depended a sword with a
  small, round guard, and a hilt nearly a foot in length, and from the other, a
  weapon which slightly resembled an automatic pistol. Behind him stood a
  semicircle of smaller beings of similar rotund shape, whose helmets were
  shorter and of copper-colored metal, as were their suits of armor. They wore
  brown sashes and copper medallions emblazoned with green dragons, and in
  addition to weapons similar to those of the larger man, carried tall poles
  surmounted by sharp discs that slightly resembled buzzsaws with exceptionally
  long teeth.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the girl had created a stir in the room, but when these
  grotesque creatures became plainly visible on the disc, animated whispers
  turned to an uproar, and Ted was forced to call for silence.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had the confusion abated, ere an aged Chinese doctor arose and
  came up beside Ted.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Dr. Wu?" asked the young scientist, his hands busy with the
  dials. "Can you understand him?"</p>

  <p>"A word, here and there, seems intelligible&mdash;something like the
  language of my revered ancestors."</p>

  <p>At sight of Dr. Wu, the speaker in the disc paused and nodded. It was as
  if he had recognized someone racially akin to him. The doctor bowed and
  smiled in return, and said something in a monosyllabic tongue. Its phonetic
  similarity to that which had come from the globular being was striking, as
  was the fact that there was a slight facial resemblance between Dr. Wu and
  the lunar speaker.</p>

  <p>The Lunite pursed his lips and knit his brows as if endeavoring to
  understand. He turned to the semicircle of men behind him. They all appeared
  puzzled. Then he dispatched one of them, who disappeared from the disc, and
  facing Dr. Wu once more, uttered a short sentence.</p>

  <p>It was the doctor's turn to knit his brows and shake his head. Again he
  essayed speech with the armored man. Apparently he was not understood. The
  process was repeated several more times with the same result. It seemed that
  the two were on the verge of understanding each other, yet could not quite
  make themselves intelligible.</p>

  <p>Then the man who had disappeared from the disc a few minutes before
  reappeared with another, a bent figure who hung on his arm for support. His
  face was wrinkled and toothless, his sparse moustache was gray, and his limbs
  were more spindly than those of the others. Instead of armor he wore a
  garment of quilted black cloth over his emaciated form.</p>

  <p>The man in the gold armor looked at Dr. Wu, then pointed to the old man
  and uttered a few words. The doctor nodded, and addressed him. The old fellow
  pondered for a moment, then shook his head. Again Dr. Wu spoke to him. He
  shook his head once more, and reaching beneath his robe, drew forth a scroll
  and writing brush. After rapidly tracing a number of characters on the
  scroll, he held it up. The writing bore a striking resemblance to
  Chinese.</p>

  <p>Seizing Ted's sleeve, the doctor spoke excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Is the photo-recorder on?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Good. I believe I can translate that writing, given time."</p>

  <p>Facing the old man in the disc, Dr. Wu again nodded and smiled. Then he
  pointed skyward and said:</p>

  <p>"T'ien."</p>

  <p>The old man nodded, smiled, and repeated excitedly: "T'ien! T'ien!" then
  bowed as if in devotion.</p>

  <p>The doctor also made the devotional obeisance and said:</p>

  <p>"Shang Ti."</p>

  <p>The old man shook his head, signifying that he could not understand. Then
  he pointed to the man in the golden armor, and said:</p>

  <p>"P'an-ku."</p>

  <p>"P'an-ku!" repeated the doctor with a look of astonishment on his face,
  and made obeisance to the golden one.</p>

  <p>That individual, with a look of annoyance, suddenly turned on the old man
  and released a volley of monosyllables. The old fellow groveled before him
  and shook his head.</p>

  <p>Then he of the golden armor made a sign with his hand, whereupon the disc
  suddenly became blank.</p>

  <p>"Guess the interview is over," said Ted, shutting off the radio. "Now how
  can we find out what it was all about?"</p>

  <p>"I can explain the last three words," said Dr. Wu. "'T'ien,' is the oldest
  word in our language which has the meaning of 'The Heavens' or 'God.' This
  word was understood. 'Shang Ti,' a later word for 'God' was unintelligible.
  The old man pointed to the one who was evidently the ruler, and said:
  'P'an-ku.' According to our traditions, 'P'an-ku was the first human being,
  corresponding to the 'Adam' of your Bible."</p>

  <p>"From which one might deduce," said Ted, "that the people we have just
  interviewed are remotely related to your earliest ancestors." "So it seems.
  If you will let me have the phonetic and written records, and a fast
  electroplane, I believe that by consulting our ancient writings I may be able
  to render a translation in a few days." "Splendid!" replied Ted. "Both will
  be ready within an hour."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch05"
     name="ch05">5.</a> &mdash; THE ULTIMATUM OF P'AN-KU</h2>

  <p class="first">Three days later Ted received a radiogram from Peiping,
  reading as follows:</p>

  <p class="letter">Honorable Sir: I avail myself of the privilege of
  submitting below the result of my poor efforts at deciphering the written
  characters of the Moon People. The spoken language was, with the exception of
  a few scattered words which cannot be put together to make sense, wholly
  unintelligible to me.<br>
  <br>
  Here follows my sorry translation: Why have you destroyed Ur? You, the people
  of Du Gong have thrown to us, the Imperial Government of P'an-ku, mightiest
  emperor of Ma Gong, the tcha-tsi (meaning unknown to translator) of war. We
  are greater and wiser than you, and can crush you with ease.<br>
  <br>
  You have demonstrated that you are not fit to govern yourselves-that you are
  a menace to the people of the great Lord Sun, his eight apostles and their
  children. The Imperial Government of P'an-ku will send a viceroy to rule over
  you. Submit, and you will live happily, the subjects of P'an-ku. Resist, and
  you will be destroyed.<br>
  <br>
  In my humble and unworthy opinion, the word, "tcha-tsi," means either some
  instrument of war or perhaps a challenge to war, and has the same symbolical
  significance as does the gauntlet in English.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Wu.</p>

  <p>The contents of this message were immediately transmitted to the President
  of the United States, and he lost no time in calling a council of the
  Associated Governments of the Earth by radiovisiphone. Ted Dustin was a party
  to the conference, and assisted in drafting a placatory note to P'an-ku. The
  note, which was sent to Dr. Wu for translation into the Lunite language, was
  as follows:</p>

  <p>To the Imperial Government of P'an-ku: Greeting: The Associated
  Governments of the Earth regret the destruction of Ur, and are willing to do
  all in their power to make amends.</p>

  <p>The destruction was unintentional, as the Associated Governments of the
  Earth were unaware that Ma Gong was inhabited.</p>

  <p>The Associated Governments of the Earth make full apology for having
  wronged the people of Ur, and stand willing to pay a reasonable indemnity in
  treasure, food, raw materials, or manufactured products, but are united in
  the purpose to resist and retaliate for any attempt at conquest.</p>

  <p>After the note had been drafted and dispatched it was unanimously decided
  at the meeting that Ted was entitled to the million dollar reward, there
  being now no longer any doubt that his projectile had struck the moon. The
  treasurer of the association was, accordingly, ordered to pay him that
  amount.</p>

  <p>It was late in the evening when Ted called Roger into his private
  office.</p>

  <p>"Get that translation from Dr. Wu, yet?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I had it painted in large white letters on a black placard and
  mounted on an easel in front of the big disc."</p>

  <p>"Good. We'll go up now. Everything will be ordered off the air in five
  minutes, and we'll try to get it through."</p>

  <p>They took the elevator to the tower room, where the linguists, scientists,
  and representatives of the associated powers were assembled as before.
  President Whitmore was not present, however, because of urgent business in
  Washington. His place was taken by the Secretary of State. Dr. Wu, who was
  also unable to be present, was represented by Dr. Fang, a Chinese scholar of
  almost equal repute.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock, the zero hour, Ted promptly pressed the button and began
  manipulating the dials.</p>

  <p>This time he was instantly rewarded by the appearance of the dazzlingly
  beautiful girl who had faded from his vision on the occasion of his last
  attempt at communication. She was attended by two armed guards as before, and
  in addition by a bent, gray-bearded man who wore a richly embroidered robe of
  dark blue, and sandals.</p>

  <p>Both glanced at the writing on the placard which Ted held up. Eagerly
  watching their faces, he saw that they registered amazement and horror.
  Wondering what there could be about this pacific message to cause such a
  reaction, he called Dr. Fang and asked him to write the query: "What is
  wrong?"</p>

  <p>The doctor, a thin, rat-faced Manchu, came forward, but said he did not
  know the symbols for the words.</p>

  <p>The girl, meanwhile, had a scroll and writing brush brought forward by a
  female attendant. The latter held the scroll aloft so its surface was fully
  visible, and the girl began rapidly writing two sets of characters thereon.
  One set was similar to those which had been used in the previous
  communication. The other was totally unlike it and bore no resemblance to any
  known earthly characters. Her purpose, however, was quite evident. The two
  sets of characters were written in alternating perpendicular line side by
  side, in order that the former language might be used as a key to the
  latter.</p>

  <p>Quick to grasp her idea, Ted called for the photo-record of the message
  from the Imperial Government of P'an-ku. Beside it, he wrote the English
  translation, using Roman capital letters for the sake of simplicity. Then
  beside the placarded note to the Government of P'an-ku, he wrote the original
  of that note, also in Roman capitals. In addition, he pointed out and
  distinctly pronounced the English words, one by one.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded, smiled, and pointed questioningly at him.</p>

  <p>"Ted Dustin," he said.</p>

  <p>She pointed to herself and said:</p>

  <p>"Maza an Ma Gong."</p>

  <p>He repeated the name after her, and pointed to the scroll she had written.
  She was pronouncing and pointing out each word when she was suddenly crowded
  out as before by the appearance of P'an-ku and his attendants.</p>

  <p>The rotund and imperious P'an-ku read the message on the placard, then
  turned to the old man who stood beside him and smiled. Ted thought there was
  a trace of a sneer in his smile. He ordered the old fellow to write his
  reply, then turned and stalked majestically out of the range of vision. The
  old man held his message aloft for a few moments as if fully aware that it
  was being recorded. Then he let his arm fall to his side, and the disc became
  blank.</p>

  <p>After supplying Dr. Fang with a set of photo-records of the messages, and
  dispatching another to Dr. Wu, Ted and Roger went to the private office of
  the former for a conference.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," said Ted, after he had his briar going, "that there's
  something putrid in Denmark. Did you notice the expression of horror on the
  faces of the girl and the gray-bearded man when they read our messages?"</p>

  <p>"Queer, wasn't it?" replied Roger. "Must have been something in that
  message that was quite a shock to them. Wonder what it could have been."</p>

  <p>"That's precisely what I've been wondering&mdash;and it has led to a
  rather unpleasant thought. I wouldn't mention it to anyone in the world but
  you &mdash;not at present, anyhow but it looks to me as if Dr. Wu may have
  double crossed us."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"By writing a message of his own in the place of the one we asked him to
  translate for us."</p>

  <p>"But what message of his own could he possibly have written?"</p>

  <p>"That," said Ted, "is what I propose to try to find out just as soon as I
  possibly can. Just before we came up here I sent Bevans to Peiping in the
  800. He has orders to bring Professor Ederson back with him. We can bank on
  the professor to shoot square, and it's quite possible that he can check up
  on Wu's message. At any rate, he's probably the best versed white man in the
  world on the ancient writings of China and Tibet. Has made a life-time study
  of them, I'm told."</p>

  <p>"What about the learned Manchu, Dr. Fang?"</p>

  <p>"I think he was bluffing. If there's mischief afoot, you can safely bet
  he's in on it, and knows how to play his part. He's not so ignorant as he
  pretends to be. Did you notice the expression on the face of the man in the
  golden armor? He smiled when he read our message, but the smile was half a
  sneer."</p>

  <p>"It was a mean smile, all right," agreed Roger. "More like the snarl of an
  animal than the smile of a human being."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather have a person frown at me than smile that way," said Ted.</p>

  <p>Shortly after midnight a radiogram from Professor Fowler of the Yerkes
  Observatory arrived. He stated that he had seen five flashes on the moon,
  coming from the region of the lunar crater Stadius.</p>

  <p>In the wee, small hours of the morning, Chicago was shaken by a terrific
  detonation.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch06"
     name="ch06">6.</a> &mdash; TREACHERY</h2>

  <p class="first">It was after five o'clock when all the reports were in. Five
  projectiles, larger than the former, and each destructive over a fifty mile
  radius, had struck the earth. The one which had so shaken Chicago had struck
  at Rochelle, Illinois, completely destroying that city and spreading death
  and destruction up to the very suburbs of Chicago on one side and across the
  Mississippi into Iowa on the other.</p>

  <p>The second projectile had demolished Cincinnati, Covington and surrounding
  cities and hamlets with terrific loss of life. The third had struck squarely
  in the center of Birmingham, England, destroying, killing and maiming as far
  as Stafford, Shrewsbury, Ludlow, Worcester and Rugby. The fourth, alighting
  in the harbor of Tunis, had sunk and destroyed shipping, and created a tidal
  wave which had drowned many people on shore. The fifth had laid waste to
  Quito, Ecuador and the surrounding territory.</p>

  <p>At five thirty, a report from Peiping stated that Khobr and nearby towns
  had been destroyed or suffered terrific casualties from a sixth
  projectile.</p>

  <p>Leaving Roger in charge, Ted promptly took a super-electroplane to
  Washington. While he was closeted that morning in conference with the
  President, fifty aerial fleets of army engineers left the Capital, flying in
  various directions, but with their destinations kept secret.</p>

  <p>During the day, representatives of various nations were called into the
  conference. Each representative, as he left the President's office, was seen
  to speed away in a fast electroplane. Not one representative of a Mongoloid
  Asiatic nation was asked into conference.</p>

  <p>After a busy day, Ted rushed back to his office where he found Roger up to
  his eyebrows in work, endeavoring to placate his wife for his tardiness to
  dinner, over his wrist radiophone.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Leah," he was saying. "I simply can't get away now. I'm trying to
  manage things alone, you know, and hello! Ted's here now. Be home, toot
  sweet, honey. Bye bye."</p>

  <p>"You married men&mdash;" began Ted.</p>

  <p>"Have got it all over you single ones in many ways," interrupted Roger.
  "Get things going in Washington?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty well. I've organized our defense force, and have warned every
  nation that we have reason to believe is friendly. Before the moon gets into
  favorable firing position again we'll have enough powerful magnetic poles set
  up to take care of the United States, and if the other countries keep on
  their toes they'll be ready, too."</p>

  <p>"How do you know the poles will work?"</p>

  <p>"Fragments of the lunar projectiles show that they contain large
  quantities of steel. We've divided the country into fifty zones, in each of
  which a powerful electro-magnet will be erected. Having erected these in the
  least populated districts of each zone, and warned the inhabitants to leave
  the danger area, our sole remaining problem is to make them powerful enough
  to attract the projectiles, which we can easily do with the resources at our
  command. Our power plants will be far enough from the magnetic poles to keep
  them from injury, and as soon as one pole is destroyed another can be quickly
  erected."</p>

  <p>"You sure have some head on you, Ted. What about the Mongoloid Asiatics?
  Find out anything?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing definite. For the present we're sitting tight and saying nothing.
  Professor Ederson will, no doubt, be able to check up on them. If they
  haven't double crossed us there will still be plenty of time to explain my
  plan of defense to them."</p>

  <p>Professor Ederson did not arrive until late the following afternoon. Roger
  met him on the roof, and immediately escorted him to Ted's private office. He
  was a little, wizened man, with a grizzled Van Dyke, a thin, aquiline nose,
  and huge, thick-Tensed glasses which gave him an owl-like expression.</p>

  <p>"I've been studying the translation of Dr. Wu while Bevans, your admirable
  pilot, conducted me here," said the professor when greetings were over. "It
  seems to me to be quite accurate."</p>

  <p>"What about the message he wrote for me?" asked Ted.</p>

  <p>"I cannot, for the life of me, understand why you sent so belligerent a
  message," replied the professor.</p>

  <p>"Belligerent? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Ted quickly produced an English copy of the message which he has asked Dr.
  Wu to translate into the Lunite language for him.</p>

  <p>"Why," said the professor, scanning it in surprise, "this is nothing like
  the message I have translated."</p>

  <p>"Let me have your translation," requested Ted.</p>

  <p>The professor produced a sheaf of papers from his inside coat pocket,
  selected one, and handed it to Ted.</p>

  <p>The latter read it aloud:</p>

  <p>To the Imperial Government of P'an-ku: Greeting:</p>

  <p>The Associated Governments of the Earth have found cause for much mirth in
  the note of the Imperial Government of P'an-ku.</p>

  <p>It is the intention of the Associated Governments of the Earth to quickly
  and completely destroy Ma Gong (The Moon) if its inhabitants refuse to submit
  to the viceroys which the Associated Governments of the Earth are preparing
  to send to rule over them.</p>

  <p>The Imperial Government of P'an-ku has complained of the destruction of
  Ur. This is only a minute sample of the destruction which will be wrought on
  Ma Gong if there are any further acts of hostility on the part of the
  Imperial Government of P'an-ku.</p>

  <p>"Whew!" exclaimed Roger. "No wonder the girl and the old man looked
  horrified."</p>

  <p>"And it's no wonder the imperious and belligerent P'an-ku sneered," said
  Ted. "Looks as if we're in for it, sure enough, now."</p>

  <p>"What about having Professor Ederson fix up a new note, right away,
  explaining everything and trying to patch things up?" asked Roger.</p>

  <p>"We'll try it," replied Ted, "but I can't bring myself to feel very
  sanguine as to the result."</p>

  <p>"Before we draft the note," said the professor, "there are two things I
  should like to bring to your attention. First, a gigantic radio station has
  been set up in Peiping. Second, despite the fact that China reported the
  destruction of Khobr and nearby towns, I flew over Khobr and vicinity and
  could see no sign that there had been a disturbance there of any kind."</p>

  <p>"Professor Fowler only saw five flashes, all of which were accounted for,"
  said Ted. "The destruction of Khobr would have meant a sixth projectile,
  which left the moon without a telltale flash. As always, two and two continue
  to make four. There can only be one reason why Dr. Wu miswrote our pacific
  message-only one reason why the government of China lied about Khobr."</p>

  <p>"And the reason?" asked the professor.</p>

  <p>"A secret alliance projected-perhaps even perfected by now&mdash; between
  the Chinese royalists and the Imperial Government of P'an-ku."</p>

  <p>"Precisely my theory," said Professor Ederson. "The Chinese and racially
  allied peoples revere their ancestors to the point of actual worship. Small
  wonder, then, if they should have reverence for the living representative of
  their supposed first earthly ancestor, P'an-ku, and cast their lot with him
  and his people. Why man, the thing was inevitable."</p>

  <p>"And terrible to contemplate," said Ted, dejectedly. "A united world could
  have fought off a dozen moons, but a divided world will have a slim chance.
  And the whole damnable affair is my fault."</p>

  <p>"Millions of sparks fall harmlessly, but here and there one starts a huge
  conflagration," said the professor. "No earthly being could have foreseen the
  far-reaching effect of your apparently harmless spark, and you certainly are
  not morally responsible."</p>

  <p>"I hold myself so," said Ted, "and it would be a small thing to me, could
  I but forfeit my own life to end the conflict. I have a plan, but I may not
  speak of it yet."</p>

  <p>"I hope you are not contemplating any foolhardy personal risks," said the
  professor. "The world needs you more than any other living man, at present.
  We have thousands of scientists, but only one Ted Dustin."</p>

  <p>"Who has proven himself the greatest calamity yet born to the earth,"
  replied Ted. "But let's prepare that message."</p>

  <p>A half hour elapsed before a message, satisfactory to all, had been
  drafted for the Imperial Government of P'an-ku. It took the professor an hour
  more to put it in the language of the Lunites. Then the air was cleared, and
  the three men went aloft to the gigantic radio tower.</p>

  <p>While the professor held the message on a placard, Ted worked at the dials
  and Roger managed the recorder.</p>

  <p>Their first efforts were rewarded by the faint sound of a woman's voice
  and a dim vision of the beautiful girl seen on two previous occasions. Almost
  as soon as it began to appear, the image was blotted from the disc, and from
  then on until early morning, when the three tired men relinquished their
  unsuccessful attempt, they were rewarded only by blackness and a faint
  rumbling sound which greatly resembled distant thunder.</p>

  <p>"Looks as if P'an-ku bad severed diplomatic relations," said Roger, rising
  from his seat at the recorder and stretching his cramped limbs.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you are right," replied the professor, leaning his placard
  against a chair.</p>

  <p>"We'll try again, and keep on trying," said Ted. "The Lunites should be
  amenable to reason if we can get the message through."</p>

  <p>Try they did, the following night, and each night thereafter for nearly
  two weeks. The results were only darkness, and the distant thunderous
  rumbling. Even the image of the girl had failed to appear for so much as a
  fraction of a second.</p>

  <p>When the efforts of the last night had proved unavailing, Ted threw off
  the switch and rose with a look of grim determination.</p>

  <p>"We must face the facts," he said. "War is inevitable unless P'an-ku can
  be reached and influenced by a specific message. It will take two more weeks
  at the very least, to complete our large interplanetary vehicle. By that time
  the war will undoubtedly be in full progress."</p>

  <p>"What do you propose to do about it?" asked the professor.</p>

  <p>"I will take the message in person," replied Ted.</p>

  <p>"How?" chorused his two surprised companions in unison.</p>

  <p>"Come with me and I'll show you, but you must preserve absolute
  secrecy."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch07"
     name="ch07">7.</a>A PERILOUS JOURNEY</h2>

  <p class="first">Ted led Roger and the professor through a side door, and out
  onto the roof, which was illuminated by the silvery glory of the moon. A
  watchman challenged them, then saluted respectfully as he recognized his
  employer.</p>

  <p>As they passed the hangars of Ted's fleet of electroplanes, more watchmen
  challenged and saluted.</p>

  <p>Beyond this, they came to a square shed of steel, the heavy metal door of
  which Ted unlocked with a key taken from his pocket. As his two companions
  entered he closed the door after them, then pressed a light switch.</p>

  <p>"Here is my secret," he said. "Isn't she a little beauty?"</p>

  <p>"I'll say she is!" exclaimed Roger, looking admiringly at a craft of
  silver gray metal about sixteen feet in length, gracefully shaped, and decked
  over like an Esquimauan kayak, but with a centrally located turret which
  projected above and below the hull. This turret was of glass braced with the
  same silver-gray metal which formed the hull, and within it could be seen a
  bewildering array of buttons and levers which fronted a revolving upholstered
  seat. Projecting from the upper half of the turret, pointing fore, aft, and
  to each side, were four tubes, each of which ended in a glass lens. The lower
  turret was similarly equipped. The hull itself was provided with four
  searchlights, set to sweep in all directions.</p>

  <p>Ted opened a heavily-gasketed door in the side of the upper turret, and
  said:</p>

  <p>"Look her over if you want to, while I put on my driving suit."</p>

  <p>"You've been keeping something from me, Ted," said Roger reproachfully
  while he and the professor admired the snug interior of the craft.</p>

  <p>The young inventor laughed, as he opened a drawer and produced there-from
  a costume and helmet greatly resembling those worn by deep sea divers.</p>

  <p>"Wanted to surprise you," he said, stepping into the one-piece suit and
  screwing down the clamps which closed the front. "Besides, you had too much
  on your mind as it was."</p>

  <p>"But what is the purpose of the thing?" asked the professor, still peering
  into the interior. "You don't mean to tell me this craft will fly without
  planes, rudder or propeller."</p>

  <p>"I think so," replied Ted, "although if it does, this will be its maiden
  flight."</p>

  <p>"But how?" persisted the professor.</p>

  <p>"Atomotor," said Ted, shortly, attaching his helmet to an affair which
  slightly resembled a knapsack. "It will fly in the same manner as my
  projectile flew to the moon, but more slowly, because I don't dare give it
  the terrific start imparted to my projectile."</p>

  <p>"Hardly," smiled Roger. "It would be burned to a cinder. How far are you
  going tonight?"</p>

  <p>"Don't know exactly;" replied Ted, "but if luck is with me I hope to land
  on the moon before the middle of this week."</p>

  <p>"What!" gasped Roger. "You expect to go to the moon alone and
  unarmed?"</p>

  <p>"Alone," grinned Ted, "but not unarmed." He had donned the helmet and
  opened a glass slide in front for conversational purposes. After adjusting
  the straps of the thing which resembled a knapsack, he took a belt from the
  drawer and buckled it about his waist. Attached to the belt were two holsters
  from which pistol-like handles projected.</p>

  <p>"Do you expect to defend yourself against super-intelligences as seem to
  exist on the moon, with a couple of pistols?" asked the professor.</p>

  <p>"Hardly," replied Ted. "The things you think are pistols are not pistols
  at all, but pistol degravitors. They operate on the same principle as the
  eight degravitors on my craft, but on a smaller scale."</p>

  <p>"You mean those eight tubes sticking out of the turret?" asked Roger.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," replied Ted.</p>

  <p>"What deadly substance do they shoot?"</p>

  <p>"They don't shoot," Ted answered with a smile. "They radiate&mdash;and
  when their rays strike matter it disintegrates."</p>

  <p>"But how&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can only take a minute to explain, as time is pressing," replied Ted,
  "but I'll give you a demonstration very shortly. All matter is composed of
  atoms which are, in turn, composed of protons and electrons, always in
  motion, the latter whirling around the former as the planets whirl around the
  sun. The force, therefore, which holds them in their orbits is analogous to
  the force of gravity, hence I have applied the word until a better one can be
  found. When I press the firing button of the degravitor, it immediately
  releases two sets of invisible rays, cathode and anode, both of which when
  properly pointed, strike the same object at the same time, but at slightly
  different angles. The positively charged protons are instantly torn from
  their atoms by the cathode rays, while the negatively charged electrons are
  taken up by the anode rays. As the two types of rays diverge, they are torn
  apart, and the matter which they form immediately disintegrates and
  disappears."</p>

  <p>"Remarkable!" exclaimed the professor.</p>

  <p>"Good head!" said Roger. "But how on earth did you manage to make all
  these things without my knowing it?"</p>

  <p>"Easily," replied Ted. "I had the parts made separately in the shop and
  assembled them here, myself. The hull is supposed to be the fuselage of a new
  type of electroplane, to which the wings have not yet been attached. The
  atomotor is assumed to be a model. I fitted it into the hull, myself. As for
  the degravitors, I had the parts made, assembled them, and fitted the larger
  ones into the turret, working nights in this room.</p>

  <p>"I might add that I have put through an order for ten thousand of the
  small and a hundred thousand of the large degravitors. Directions for
  assembling and firing them are in the safe, and you, Roger, will see to it
  that our soldiers and combat planes are equipped with them as soon as
  possible.</p>

  <p>"But enough of explanations. I must go. If I do not return, you, Roger,
  will know where to find all of my plans, including those for the degravitors.
  Use them, and arrange for the defense as best you can, without me."</p>

  <p>He entered the turret and switched on a tiny, inner light.</p>

  <p>"I have your valuable translations, professor," said Ted, "and hope that I
  may be able to use them to advantage. Goodbye."</p>

  <p>"Goodbye, and good luck," echoed both men as he closed the front of his
  helmet and slammed and fastened the door of the turret.</p>

  <p>They watched him as he slowly elevated the upper forward degravitor. When
  he pressed the button no visible rays shot forth, but in the metal roof
  toward which it was aimed there suddenly appeared a clean cut hole which was
  rapidly widened by circumscribing it with the degravitor rays. The metal did
  not glow as if burned away, but simply disappeared with a quick,
  scintillating flash wherever the rays touched it.</p>

  <p>When the hole had been enlarged sufficiently, Ted waved a last adieu. Then
  his craft rose gracefully, hung for a moment at a point about a thousand feet
  above the roof, and disappeared with a burst of terrific speed, traveling in
  a direction which might be reckoned about 80 degrees to the east of the moon
  in the plane of the ecliptic.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch08"
     name="ch08">8.</a> &mdash; DEATH RAYS</h2>

  <p class="first">A week elapsed, after the departure of the young inventor,
  with no word from Ted. During this time, Roger, busy with the duties of the
  chief executive, ate and slept in the office of his employer.</p>

  <p>Professor Ederson had meanwhile tried nightly to get into communication
  with the Lunites, but without success.</p>

  <p>It was on this, the seventh night, that a terrific storm struck Chicago.
  Unable to sleep because of the howling wind and terrific peals of thunder,
  Roger switched on the lights and was about to step to the window when his
  name was called from the disc of the radiovisiphone.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sanders."</p>

  <p>He hurried to the instrument and saw the face of the night operator.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"The President of the United States is calling Mr. Dustin. What shall I
  do?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dustin is not in," said Roger, who had shared the secret of his
  employer's absence only with Professor Ederson. "Let me talk to him."</p>

  <p>In an instant the face of President Whitmore appeared on the disc. To his
  intense surprise, Roger noticed that he wore a fur cap and a great fur coat
  with the collar turned up. That he was in an intensely cold place was
  indicated by the visibility of his breath as he spoke and exhaled.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. Dustin?" were his first words on seeing Roger instead of the
  man he had called.</p>

  <p>"He is not here," replied Roger. "As his assistant, can I be of service to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"You have not answered my question," persisted the President. "Where is
  Mr. Dustin?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I promised not to tell," answered Roger. "He left here a week ago
  in the interests of our country and our allies."</p>

  <p>The President frowned.</p>

  <p>"You forget, Mr. Sanders," he said, "that this is a war emergency, that
  the country is on a military basis, and that I am Mr. Dustin's superior
  officer as well as yours. I demand to know where he is."</p>

  <p>Roger was nonplussed. He had told everyone that Ted had gone away on
  business for the country, leaving them to assume what they pleased in the
  matter. People had, of course, assumed that he had gone to some other city,
  and would be back shortly. But the President was within his. rights in
  demanding to know where he was. Ted, himself, would not have had the right to
  refuse this demand.</p>

  <p>"He left for the moon a week ago," said Roger, "and I have heard nothing
  from him since."</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>The President appeared dumfounded.</p>

  <p>"How did he go? Who went with him?"</p>

  <p>"He went alone in a small interplanetary vehicle of his own invention,
  knowing that the war would be in full swing before his larger vehicle could
  be completed.</p>

  <p>"Well I'll be damned!" exploded the President. "This is a pretty how d'ye
  do. Gone just when we need him most."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," answered Roger, "but he hoped to be able to stop the war by
  this trip. If there's anything I can do-"</p>

  <p>"Maybe there is," said the President, with forced calmness. "Perhaps you
  can explain some things that I had hoped he could explain. For instance, what
  is the cause of this intensely cold weather in the middle of the summer, and
  why does the moonlight appear green?"</p>

  <p>"We can't see the moon from here," replied Roger, "and it's not cold.
  There is a terrific storm raging, plenty of lightning rain and wind, but no
  cold."</p>

  <p>"A devastating cold wave has spread over this part of the country,
  affecting Washington and Baltimore, and extending as far south as Richmond,"
  said the President. "The Potomac is frozen solid, and although we have our
  heating plants going to the utmost capacity, it is impossible to keep warm.
  Thousands of people, caught unexpectedly, have perished from the intense
  cold. My thermometer here in the White House registers 10 degrees above zero.
  Outside, I am told the thermometers have dropped under 60 degrees below zero,
  Fahrenheit."</p>

  <p>"And you say the moon looks green?"</p>

  <p>"As green as grass. The country is bathed in a weird, green light at this
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Must be some connection," mused Roger, "I mean between the green light
  and the intense cold localized around Washington. Wish Mr. Dustin were
  here."</p>

  <p>"But he isn't," snapped the President, "so see what you can find out, and
  report back, either by radiovisiphone or in person at your earliest
  convenience. Off!"</p>

  <p>As the face of the President disappeared from the disc, Roger slumped down
  in his chair and lighted a cigarette. What should he do? What could he
  do?</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said, listlessly.</p>

  <p>Professor Ederson entered.</p>

  <p>"No use to try to use the radio tonight," he said. "With the unknown
  interference we have been getting lately and this storm, it would be useless
  to try to communicate with the moon. I had our operator notify all stations
  that we wouldn't attempt it tonight."</p>

  <p>"Hear about the cold snap in the east?" asked Roger.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Got it on the small set just before I came down. Terrible thing,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"And about the green moonlight?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Some new wrinkle of the Lunites, I fancy. They are clever and
  resourceful and, for all we know, a thousand years ahead of us in scientific
  knowledge."</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose it is?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. An observation might be made from here, seeing that this
  part of the country is unaffected, if it were not for the raging storm. But
  it would be suicidal to go up in an electroplane just now."</p>

  <p>"If I thought there were anything to be learned, I'd go up," said Roger,
  "danger or no danger."</p>

  <p>"I mentioned it only as a possibility," replied the professor. "The
  probability is, that if you did learn anything, it would be of no material
  value, even if you were to be so extremely fortunate as to get back alive
  with it"</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," replied Roger, "I'm going up, just on the strength of that
  possibility."</p>

  <p>"Don't be an utter fool," warned the professor, but Roger was already
  calling Bevans.</p>

  <p>"Have the Blettendorf 800 ready in five minutes," he said. "I'll be up in
  a jiffy."</p>

  <p>He dressed rapidly while the professor remonstrated with him.</p>

  <p>"No use," said Roger, "I'm going."</p>

  <p>"Very well," replied the professor. "If you must go I'll go with you.
  Perhaps the two of us can bring back some information of value&mdash;if we
  get back."</p>

  <p>They took the elevator to the top, stepped out on the roof, and battled
  their way through the driving rain, in which there was beginning to be a hint
  of sleet, to the electroplane. Eight men held it, just outside the hangar,
  while Bevans, in the pilot's seat, tested the motor.</p>

  <p>The two men entered and took their seats. Then Roger gave the order to
  ascend. Came a roar from the helicopter blades, and they were off.</p>

  <p>As they rose above the skyscrapers of Chicago, their craft tossing and
  careening like a leaf in a gale, Roger took two parcels from beneath the
  seat, one of which he handed to the professor.</p>

  <p>"Folding parachutes," he said. "Bevans is wearing one. Watch how I strap
  mine on, and do likewise. We may need them."</p>

  <p>The wind swept them out over Lake Michigan&mdash;then they plunged into a
  swirling, blinding snowstorm, and everything below, even the powerful guide-
  lights of Chicago's great landing fields, vanished.</p>

  <p>With propeller and helicopter blades roaring, Bevans drove the plane
  higher and higher, until they at length emerged above the seething, moon-
  silvered clouds.</p>

  <p>"No green moonlight here," said the professor.</p>

  <p>"But look&mdash;look to the southeast!" exclaimed Roger.</p>

  <p>The professor looked, and saw a green band of light, wide at the bottom,
  but narrowing as it extended upward straight toward the gibbous moon.</p>

  <p>"The moon looks green from Washington," said the professor, "because the
  inhabitants had to look through the green lights to see it."</p>

  <p>Roger shouted an order through the speaking tube.</p>

  <p>"Hover."</p>

  <p>As the big plane, now riding in comparatively calm air, hung smoothly
  suspended by its helicopter blades, he turned a pair of powerful binoculars
  on the moon. He focused them, looked for a moment longer, then handed them to
  the professor.</p>

  <p>"It's coming from the ring-mountain, Copernicus," he said. "Looks as if a
  beam from an enormous green searchlight were coming directly from the center
  of the crater."</p>

  <p>"So it is," said the professor, after a careful scrutiny. "From the very
  center of the crater."</p>

  <p>Then, before he had lowered the glasses, the green light winked out. So
  sudden was the transformation, and so calm and natural did the moon appear,
  that it seemed to both observers that the thing had not really been&mdash;
  that it was a figment of their imaginations.</p>

  <p>Came a call from Bevans:</p>

  <p>"Three strange craft on the starboard quarter, sir. They seem to be coming
  this way."</p>

  <p>The professor trained the binoculars in the direction indicated.</p>

  <p>"My word, what odd looking craft," he exclaimed. "They are globular in
  form&mdash;globes, to each of which two whirling discs are attached."</p>

  <p>"An International Patrol Plane is coming from the port quarter," called
  Bevans. "It's signaling the three strange craft, but they do not respond.
  They are running without lights."</p>

  <p>"Ascend," called Roger, "and turn off all lights."</p>

  <p>There was an answering roar as the Blettendorf shot upward.</p>

  <p>"Too late for that," said the professor. "We must have been seen."</p>

  <p>As the two men watched the one sided aerial parley below, they saw two
  more Patrol Planes emerge from the upper cloud stratum and take places behind
  the first.</p>

  <p>"That makes the numbers even, at least," said Roger.</p>

  <p>The two squadrons drew together without sign or signal from the strange
  craft, until the two leaders were within two thousand feet of each other.
  Then a narrow green ray suddenly shot out from the foremost globe, striking
  the first patrol plane. For a moment the plane seemed to shrink-to draw
  together as if crushed in from all sides. Then it crumbled asunder, and the
  pieces fell into the swirling clouds beneath.</p>

  <p>The forward turret guns of the two remaining planes immediately went into
  action, concentrating their fire on the foremost globe, but with no apparent
  effect. Green rays shot out from the two other globes simultaneously, and the
  planes shared the fate of their leader.</p>

  <p>Then a green ray from the first globe sailed upward.</p>

  <p>"Jump!" shouted Roger. "It's our only chance. They'll find us in a
  minute."</p>

  <p>The professor tore the door open and jumped first. His parachute opened
  just as Roger leaped after him followed by Bevans.</p>

  <p>Roger could not see upward because of the parachute spread above him, but
  fragments of the shattered Blettendorf began falling around him before he had
  dropped far, and he was thankful that they had leaped in time.</p>

  <p>Looking downward to see how it fared with the professor, he saw to his
  horror that the linguist was falling directly onto one of the globes.</p>

  <p>Then he shot past the same globe himself, heard the hum of its rapidly
  whirling discs, and dropped into the enveloping grayness of the raging storm
  clouds beneath.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch09"
     name="ch09">9.</a>A VICIOUS PLANT</h2>

  <p class="first">On leaving the metal shed which had housed his one-man
  vehicle, Ted Dustin hovered for a moment to get his bearings&mdash;then shot
  away from the earth at such speed that his exterior thermometer registered a
  terrific heat from the shell of his craft before five seconds had elapsed.
  Forced to slacken his speed because of the danger of crippling his machine,
  he proceeded at a more leisurely pace until his instruments told him he was
  entirely out of the earth's atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Once assured of this, he set his meteoroid detector&mdash;an extremely
  sensitive magnetic instrument which registered the approach of all meteoric
  masses, automatically repelling the smaller ones by blasts from the exhaust
  of the atomotor, and driving the craft away from those of greater mass. He
  next set his automatic course corrector, which was designed to throw the
  machine back on its course after each forced deviation. Then he set the motor
  for full speed ahead.</p>

  <p>To his surprise and satisfaction he found, on glancing at the magnetic
  speedometer, that the little untested motor was driving the craft almost
  twice as fast as he had anticipated. He would thus, barring accidents, be
  able to reach the moon in a day and a half instead of the three days he had
  previously allowed himself for the undertaking. This necessitated the setting
  of a new course, as he would otherwise have arrived at the moon's path just a
  day and a half ahead of that satellite.</p>

  <p>Having made his calculations and adjusted his instruments accordingly, he
  opened his visor, swallowed a concentrated food pellet, drank a cup of hot
  coffee from the thermos tank, and lighted his black briar. Finding the cabin
  uncomfortably cold with his visor open, he drew up an extra set of glass
  panels all around and turned on his atomic heater. Then he studied the
  translations of the professor, hoping that he might thus learn enough of the
  Lunite writing to form a basis for intelligent communication.</p>

  <p>When the first hour had elapsed he looked back at the earth, which
  appeared as an enormous, semi-luminous globe set in a black sky, its seas and
  continents faintly defined by the light of the full moon. The disc of the sun
  remained hidden behind the earth, but other heavenly bodies were far brighter
  in appearance, shining from this black sky, than he had ever seen them appear
  from on earth.</p>

  <p>As the hours passed and the apparent size of the earth grew less while
  that of the moon grew correspondingly greater, he was surprised at not having
  encountered a single meteor. Presently, after about twelve hours of travel,
  one caused the craft to swerve, and he noticed with satisfaction that the
  automatic course corrector functioned perfectly.</p>

  <p>He swallowed another food pellet, sipped his coffee, and tried to sleep,
  but despite the fact that he had trained himself to take rest or go without
  it as the occasion required, he found sleep out of the question. The
  excitement of his thrilling race with the earth's satellite was too much for
  that. He could scarcely bear to close his eyes for a moment, for looking and
  wondering.</p>

  <p>Before he realized it, twenty-four hours had slipped by. The shrinking
  shape of the earth was now on his left&mdash;the silver disc of the moon,
  with craters, hills and valleys, was now plainly visible to the naked eye, on
  his right. He was traveling with his keel in the plane of the ecliptic. As he
  progressed, the prow leaned more and more toward the moon's north pole.</p>

  <p>The last twelve hours were packed with wonders, thrills, and dangers.
  Previously he had encountered only a relatively few meteoroids. Now, he found
  they traveled in swarms in and near the neutral gravity point between moon
  and earth. His craft swerved this way and that&mdash;dropped&mdash;or shot
  suddenly upward, as huge masses of meteoric matter hurtled dangerously near
  it. He caught fleeting glimpses of these desultory travelers, some of them
  almost perfectly spherical, others jagged lumps of rock and metal&mdash;grim
  remnants of some planetary or planetoidal tragedy of the past.</p>

  <p>With the neutral gravity point well past and the moon directly beneath his
  keel, the danger from meteoroids was considerably lessened. The delays were
  more than compensated for by the increasing pull of the moon itself.</p>

  <p>His goal almost realized, Ted's next problem was to decide where to land.
  Copernicus, plainly visible to the north east with its brilliant yellow ray
  system, and Tycho, to the south, with its still more dazzling white rays
  branching out in all directions, were the two most conspicuous objects on the
  lunar landscape.</p>

  <p>Although his purpose was to find the belligerent ruler, P'an-ku, his only
  hint as to his whereabouts was the probability that the crater, Hipparchus,
  was somewhere within the limits of that worthy's empire, which might be as
  extensive as the moon itself, or confined to a relatively small area. The
  thing to do, he decided, was to land at Hipparchus and investigate.</p>

  <p>As he approached the great ring-mountain, Ted saw no signs of life. The
  damage wrought by his projectile, however, was evident&mdash;for in the
  center of the huge, enclosed plain, gaped a jagged black hole fully five
  miles in diameter, while the interior of the crater was strewn with jagged
  rock debris, some of the larger fragments the size of a terrestrial city
  block. Of the city of Ur, mentioned in the radio message, he saw no sign
  whatever. Greatly puzzled, he slowly circled the crater, then crossed the rim
  and set out in a widening spiral, flying only a few thousand feet above the
  ground, looking for some sign of a human being or habitation.</p>

  <p>Although there had been no sign of vegetation in the enormous crater which
  had been laid waste by his projectile, Ted now began to notice signs of lunar
  forests and meadows. Flying slowly at an altitude of two hundred feet, he
  passed over level areas covered with velvety stretches of gray vegetation
  that resembled mosses and lichens, and over hills and valleys clothed with
  forests of weird, grotesque growths.</p>

  <p>There were fungi shaped like saucers, umbrellas, cones, spearheads, and
  even upraised hands, all rusty black in color. There were black stalks, fully
  fifty feet in height, topped by five-pointed purple stars, huge gray pear-
  shaped growths from which there curled sinuous branches that resembled the
  tentacles of cuttle fish, and black trees, some of which were a hundred feet
  in height, with branches that unrolled like the leaves of sword-ferns.</p>

  <p>Disposed to view some of these wonders at closer range, Ted lowered his
  craft to the ground. A glance at his exterior thermometer showed the outside
  temperature to be 210 degrees above zero, Fahrenheit, almost the boiling
  point of water at sea level on earth! He accordingly closed his visor and
  turned on the valve of his insulated compressed air tank before opening the
  door of his turret. Slamming this quickly behind him, he stepped down from
  his craft, sinking ankle deep in the soft, gray moss that coated the forest
  floor.</p>

  <p>As the suit he wore protected him from either extreme heat or cold he was
  able to maintain a normal body temperature, but the comparatively slight
  gravitational pull of the earth's satellite gave him an uncanny freedom of
  motion. His first incautious step shot him ten feet in the air and landed
  him, with startling suddenness, face downward in a tangle of black creepers
  fully twenty feet from where he had started. Instinctively he scrambled erect
  and was as suddenly precipitated on his back at a distance of fifteen feet in
  the opposite direction. This time he arose slowly, stepped forward with great
  care, and found himself able to progress after a somewhat jerky fashion.</p>

  <p>Having thus, to a degree, mastered the art of walking on the moon, he took
  the opportunity to observe the queer vegetation around him. To his intense
  surprise, he saw that it was growing visibly! Although the rates of growth
  varied in different plants, he could see that all were swelling and
  elongating with amazing rapidity. Watching an umbrella shaped fungus which
  was on a level with his eyes, he calculated that it was growing taller at the
  rate of a foot an hour! The black, fern-like branches of a great tree
  unrolled and enlarged before his eyes. Spore pods beneath the leaves, swelled
  and burst, scattering tiny dust-like particles which floated about, or
  settled on the surrounding vegetation, rocks and soil. A tall, black and gray
  fungus opened its gills, releasing a cloud of silver spores that glittered in
  the sunlight like mica dust.</p>

  <p>Ted was attracted by the movements of the tentacles of an octopus-like
  plant a short distance ahead of him, and walked toward it. They writhed and
  twisted like the snaky locks of a Medusa, yet the roots which held the pear-
  shaped trunk showed the vegetable nature of the monstrosity. Prompted by a
  rash curiosity, he had no sooner arrived beside the grotesque anomaly than he
  grasped one of the slithering branches, expecting, from its slimy appearance,
  to find it soft and yielding. To his surprise and dismay it suddenly coiled
  around his forearm with a grip as firm and unyielding as the loops of a steel
  cable. He was jerked off his feet, straight toward a black, horny lipped
  opening of triangular shape, which yawned at the top of the pear-shaped
  body.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, he reached with his free hand for his pistol degravitor,
  but too late. A score or more of tough, unyielding tentacles bound his arms
  to his sides and circled his body with such force that his bones would have
  been instantly crushed and his flesh reduced to pulp had it not been for the
  metal plates of his protective armor. Even these creaked, and seemed about to
  give way, as he was drawn, head downward, into the yawning, spike-toothed
  opening.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">10.</a> &mdash; ABDUCTION</h2>

  <p class="first">As he plunged into the awful death trap, Ted noticed that,
  for a moment, the sun was darkened above him and there was a sound which
  resembled the whistling of giant pinions. Then came the click of enormous
  teeth against the armor which covered his thighs, and blackness.</p>

  <p>The powerful tentacles had released their hold on his arms and the upper
  part of his body, but their place was instantly supplanted by the walls of
  the huge, vegetable craw which exerted even greater pressure. He wondered if
  the digestive juices of the plant would be corrosive enough to quickly
  penetrate his protective suit, or if a long, lingering death awaited
  him&mdash;a death which, even though the suit held, was bound to come as soon
  as his supply of air gave out.</p>

  <p>Hanging there in stygian solitude, unable to move a finger, Ted was
  suddenly startled at sight of a brilliant ray of red light which cut the
  darkness near his face. It blinded him temporarily, but when he could use his
  eyes once more he was astonished to see that the lower wall of his vegetable
  tomb had practically disappeared, while the bright, red ray, flashing
  intermittently, consumed the blackened edges still further with puffs of
  smoke and flame.</p>

  <p>Here, he judged, was some human agency. Here was hope of rescue, for the
  red ray, thus far, had not touched him. He could now move his head and
  shoulders, but dared not do so for fear of intercepting the red ray with
  disastrous results. The ray ate its way slowly upward beside one of his arms.
  It was free. A moment, and the other was loosed. Then the jaws relaxed their
  hold on his thighs and he slid down into the charred, jelly-like remains of
  the oval body, of which now only half the wall was standing. Two arms were
  slipped beneath his own, helping him to rise. Then he turned and faced his
  rescuer.</p>

  <p>Prepared as he was for almost any sight, Ted gasped in amazement when he
  beheld the person who had saved his life, for standing before him in a suit
  of soft, clinging white fur resembling astrakhan, her head encased in a
  helmet of bell-shaped glass, was the gloriously beautiful girl he had seen in
  the disc of the radiovisiphone&mdash;the girl who had called herself "Maza an
  Ma Gong." In her right hand was a short, tubular instrument which greatly
  resembled a flashlight, and which he judged was the weapon that had compassed
  his freedom.</p>

  <p>As he could not speak to her he was trying to think of a way to express
  his gratitude for his unexpected rescue while she smiled encouragingly, when
  he suddenly noticed a most fearful creature behind her. It resembled nothing
  living that he had ever seen or heard of, but was strikingly like pictures he
  had seen of winged dragons&mdash;pictures he had always previously imagined
  were due solely to the imagination of medieval artists.</p>

  <p>Believing the girl in dire peril, he whipped out both pistol degravitors
  and was about to destroy the beast when she struck down his weapons with a
  look of alarm. Then, beckoning the thing with her hand she stood, unafraid,
  while the hideous creature stretched forth its scrawny, scaly neck and laid
  its ugly, armor-plated muzzle on her shoulder. She fondled it for a moment,
  scratching its horny nose while it closed its eyes and laid back its short
  ears as if greatly pleased by these attentions. Then she pushed the head away
  and turned once more to the amazed young scientist.</p>

  <p>As she stood there beside him he noticed for the first time that what he
  had taken for a plume, resembling an aigrette and protruding through the top
  of her glass helmet was, in reality, a group of fine, metallic radio
  antennae. The small set which they operated was evidently attached just
  beneath them&mdash; shaped like and no larger than his own wrist
  radiophone.</p>

  <p>He wished that he had had the foresight to attach a similar contrivance to
  his own outfit, but since he had not, he found it necessary to resort to more
  primitive means for making himself heard.</p>

  <p>Taking the girl lightly by the shoulders, and thereby eliciting a look of
  startled surprise from her, he bent over and placed the glass of his helmet
  against hers, an expedient which had been much in use among deep sea divers
  for making themselves intelligible to each other before the advent of under
  water radio sets.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Maza an Ma Gong, for saving my life," he said.</p>

  <p>She smiled 'and replied:</p>

  <p>"Di tcha-tsi, Ted Dustin."</p>

  <p>Recalling that "tcha-tsi" had something to do with a challenge to war, he
  was somewhat puzzled, yet her attitude was quite peaceful. She continued to
  smile, and pointed toward the great hulking beast behind her.</p>

  <p>"Nak-kar," she said, then pointed to herself and continued: "Uma nak-
  kar."</p>

  <p>The beast, at this moment, lowered its head to crop some moss, and let its
  wings, which had been folded across its back, droop slightly, displaying a
  most comfortable looking, highbacked seat strapped to its back. He judged,
  therefore, that the lady was telling him this was her palfrey-truly a most
  hideous one.</p>

  <p>He led her to the spot where he had cached his interplanetary vehicle,
  while the great beast lumbered meekly after her, pointed to the craft and,
  with his helmet against hers, said:</p>

  <p>"Ship." Then, pointing to himself: "My ship."</p>

  <p>When she seemed not to understand, he said: "Uma nak-kar."</p>

  <p>She nodded understandingly, and both laughed.</p>

  <p>He opened the door and helped her into the small cab. Then stepping in
  himself and sharing the revolving seat with her, he closed it and took her
  for a short ride above the trees&mdash;or the growths which answered for
  trees on that weird landscape. She was as excited as a child, and clapped her
  hands with glee as they soared, and did several stunts, finally landing as
  lightly as a feather.</p>

  <p>As he helped her from the cab she stood on tiptoes so her helmet touched
  his, and said: "Uma nak-kari na Ultu." As she spoke she pointed first to her
  mount, then toward the east. Then: "Ted Dustin nak-kari na Ultu."</p>

  <p>Although he did not know the meaning of all her words, he felt that he
  understood what she wanted. She seemed to take it for granted that he did,
  for springing lightly into her saddle she struck the shoulder of the great
  winged monster with her gloved palm, whereupon it ran, sprawling clumsily for
  fifty feet or so with wings outspread, then took to the air in which it
  seemed quite at home and flapped lazily eastward.</p>

  <p>He hurried to his vehicle as he did not want to lose sight of her,
  entered, closed the door, and pressed the starter lever. To his surprise and
  alarm it did not respond. He pressed it again with the same negative result.
  Then he remembered that he had carelessly left the door open for several
  minutes. The interior of the cab had thus been exposed to the terrific heat
  of the lunar surface. Unscrewing the top of the starter he instantly saw the
  cause of his trouble. A connection, on which he had hastily used wax instead
  of solder and tape, had melted breaking the circuit. Several minutes elapsed
  before he could make the temporary repair, using his temperature equalizer,
  meanwhile, to cool the cab.</p>

  <p>Once more he pressed the starter, the atomotor responded, and he rose high
  in the air in order that he might quickly locate the girl and her strange
  steed. He saw her instantly, about a mile east of his position. Her mount, he
  noticed, was flapping forward with greater speed than before, and high above
  it was a globe circled by two transverse belts, and to which were fastened
  two whirling discs, oppositely placed. Suddenly the globe swooped downward
  like a falcon on its prey.</p>

  <p>As he darted forward he saw a tiny red ray shoot upward from the hand of
  the girl. It struck one of the belts of the descending craft, and sparks and
  smoke flew out from the spot. Then a green ray shot out from the globe,
  crossing the red ray. At the point where they crossed both rays disappeared
  and the sparks and smoke from the craft ceased. Then another green ray
  flashed out from the globe, striking one of the wings of the monster. The
  wing seemed to shrivel&mdash;then broke in pieces, and the beast fell,
  fluttering wildly with its remaining wing until it crashed with its rider
  into a tall forest of black-stemmed purple star plants.</p>

  <p>While he watched this unequal battle, which lasted only a few seconds, Ted
  had been hurtling forward at terrific speed. Just as the girl fell, he shot
  between her and the attacking globe, narrowly missing one of the green rays
  which still extended downward. Bringing his vehicle about, he trained his
  forward degravitor on the descending globe and pressed the button.</p>

  <p>Although no visible ray leaped out, the effect on the globe was readily
  apparent, for it flashed where it had struck, then gaped wide as the
  degravitor rays cut a tunnel through it.</p>

  <p>A green ray instantly flashed back in retaliation, striking Ted's prow and
  breaking it into fragments. His craft then did a nose dive which he was
  powerless to prevent, the forward exhaust pipes of the atomotor having been
  cut away. It buried itself in a cluster of the huge purple star plants, so
  thick that they shut out the light of day.</p>

  <p>As he had not strapped himself to his seat, Ted landed on his instrument
  board when the craft struck, and laid there for several moments in a semi-
  stupor, the breath knocked from his body. Presently, his breath returning in
  short gasps, he found himself able to rise and force the door part way open.
  A black stem of one of the star-like plants blocked it, but he cut this away
  at the base with his pistol degravitor, waited until it crashed among its
  fellows, and then stepped out to freedom, this time remembering to close the
  door after him.</p>

  <p>After leaping to the ground, he looked about him, trying to orient himself
  in the darkness. Here and there faint glimmers of light showed between black
  trunks, but there was nothing to give him even a hint of directions. He
  started for the light spot directly ahead of him as it looked the brightest
  and probably issued from the largest open space.</p>

  <p>Treading noiselessly over the soft gray moss which grew between the
  closely packed black trunks, he presently reached the clearing from which the
  light had issued. It was but a small opening in the forest, and it seemed to
  him that something more than chance had directed his footsteps as he saw the
  girl standing at bay with her red ray projector in her hand before a short,
  round-bodied individual clad in yellow fur and wearing a glass and copper
  helmet shaped, at the top, like a pagoda.</p>

  <p>The two were fencing, but not with blades of steel. They fenced with
  something infinitely more destructive, for as the girl sought to reach her
  antagonist with the red ray he warded it off with a green ray from a small
  projector which he held in his hand, and in turn, menaced her with his weapon
  while she parried with the red ray.</p>

  <p>Near her lay the remains of her huge mount, now a mere hulk of flesh, with
  head, neck and one wing gone.</p>

  <p>Drawing a pistol degravitor, Ted leveled it at the wielder of the green
  ray and pulled the trigger. It was aimed at his head, which instantly
  disappeared, the torso slipping to the ground with the green ray projector
  still clasped in the lifeless hand. The ray struck the base of a giant star-
  tree, which shriveled at the bottom, then crashed to the ground. Another and
  another instantly shared its fate, falling only a second or two apart, but in
  these Ted was not interested.</p>

  <p>He was about to disclose himself to the astonished girl when two long,
  lean arms clad in yellow fur suddenly reached out from the clump of fern like
  growths behind her and jerked her backward. Her red ray winked once, then
  went out, and Ted leaped forward to her assistance. He managed to follow by
  means of the trail of trampled and broken vegetation left by her abductors.
  Presently he reached another clearing just in time to see her hustled aboard
  the globe which had attacked her some time before, by two yellow-clad
  Lunites.</p>

  <p>The globe, he now saw, was of yellow metal. The two transverse belts he
  had seen from a distance proved to be combination ladders and bridges. A man
  could walk around the one which happened to be horizontal, or climb the one
  which happened to be vertical, using the supporting bars of the railing for
  ladder rounds.</p>

  <p>Projecting from the two points where these belts crossed were shaft
  housings, on the end of each of which were the discs he had previously
  noticed. The faces of both discs resembled brightly polished mirrors, one
  convex, the other concave.</p>

  <p>Just above and below the lines traced by the bridges were rows of diamond
  shaped, glassed openings which he judged answered as port holes. There was a
  diamond shaped door on the side of the craft nearest him, and it was into
  this that the girl was thrust by her two captors, while Ted stood helpless,
  unable to use his weapons for fear of harming her.</p>

  <p>One of the men closed the door after them. Then both discs started
  whirling. The craft began to rise, and Ted bounded forward, just in time to
  grasp a round of one of the ladders as it cleared the ground. Climbing
  quickly up beneath the whirling concave disc, he stepped onto the bridge and
  crouched there, to be out of sight from the port holes and to plan his next
  move.</p>

  <p>There were only two ways for him to enter the craft. He must either cut a
  hole with his pistol degravitor or go in through the hole which he had cut
  with his large degravitor before his craft fell. This hole was high up in the
  shell of the globe and could only be reached by climbing the belt ladder,
  then sliding down the smooth shell until the hole was reached. It was a
  hazardous undertaking in more ways than one, with scant hope of success.
  First, he stood little chance of being able to climb the ladder without being
  seen from one of the ports. That he had reached his present position
  undetected was little short of a miracle.</p>

  <p>Then, should he be able to reach the proper position unseen, sliding down
  the shell was a most uncertain and perilous thing to do. There was nothing to
  cling to, and the chances were ten to one that he would miss the hole he was
  striving to reach.</p>

  <p>But assuming that he should reach the hole, there was every probability
  still against him. Undoubtedly, a dozen green ray projectors would instantly
  be turned on him, ending his career without accomplishing his purpose.</p>

  <p>True, he might cut his way into the craft with his pistol degravitor, but
  this would endanger the girl. For all he knew, she might, at that very
  moment, be separated from him only by the shell of the craft which he had
  thought of cutting, and an inch or two of air. She might be at any point in
  the craft through which he should elect to cut his way.</p>

  <p>Looking through the bars of the railing, he saw that they were sailing
  swiftly over the very spot where he had come near to losing his life to the
  flesh-eating plant only a short time before, and were headed eastward. A
  moment more and they passed over the rugged rim of the great ring-mountain,
  Hipparchus. The craft dipped as they passed over the barren, debris-strewn
  inner plain. Were they headed for the destroyed city of Ur? And would others
  of their kind be there to meet them? If so, he must act quickly.</p>

  <p>Abandoning all caution, he sprang up the ladder. He expected, at every
  step, that a green ray would shoot out from one of the port holes and destroy
  him, and was surprised when he found himself sitting on top of the craft,
  alive and unharmed. On his right, about ten feet below him, was the hole
  through which his degravitor ray had come out. On his left, approximately
  eighteen feet below him, was the hole where it had entered, cutting a
  slanting tunnel through the globe. Just above this hole was a jagged streak
  of partly cut metal caused by his quick, unconscious elevation of the
  degravitor gun just before his craft fell. This streak reached almost to
  where he clung to the ladder, and looked as if it might afford a means of
  descent. It was, at least, less slippery than the smooth, coppery sides of
  the globe, the metal having been honeycombed in the path of the ray as if
  eaten by acid.</p>

  <p>Stretching himself prone, Ted sought and found holds for his gloved
  fingers in the pitted metal and began the descent, head first. He had covered
  a third of the distance when he suddenly noticed a dark wall looming beside
  him. Looking around, he saw that the craft had plunged into the great black
  hole which had been torn in the crater floor of Hipparchus by his
  interplanetary projectile.</p>

  <p>As the wall hurtled past him he caught glimpses here and there of tunnel-
  like openings, some quite large, all partly choked with debris. There came
  the realization that he must act quickly, as a landing would probably be made
  here, so he turned resolutely to his task of reaching the hole.</p>

  <p>His fingers had barely gripped the edge of the opening by which he
  expected to enter, when the globe slowed down and came to an abrupt stop. He
  slipped from his position, but caught one arm over the edge of the opening
  and managed to keep from falling. Quickly drawing himself up, he crawled
  inside the craft. He was in a small upper chamber lighted by the diamond
  shaped port holes above. It had been abandoned.</p>

  <p>On the floor lay the partly destroyed bodies which had been struck by his
  degravitor ray. He found a trap door and opening it, discovered a ladder
  which led to a room below. He judged, from the array of levers and buttons,
  that it was the pilot's room, but found it also untenanted. Opening a diamond
  shaped door in the rear of this room, he suddenly came upon a score of
  Lunites who were passing, single file, out of a side door. All were armed
  with their deadly ray projectors, but they were as much taken by surprise as
  he. Drawing both pistol degravitors with lightning quickness, he raked the
  line from both ends toward the middle before a single green ray projector
  could be brought to bear on him.</p>

  <p>One Lunite only, quicker than the others, escaped by leaping through the
  door. The others fell, a huddled heap of human remains.</p>

  <p>Quickly bounding to the door, Ted stepped out on the bridge, then ducked
  just in time to avoid a green flash. Aiming through the bars of the railing
  he destroyed the man who had projected it.</p>

  <p>The craft had landed before the explosion-scarred remains of an immense
  edifice, the portico of which was supported by gigantic human figures cut
  from brown stone. In lieu of steps leading into the building there was an
  inclined ramp, the beautiful tile pattern of which showed here and there
  between heaps and fragments of debris.</p>

  <p>Hurrying up this ramp were three figures, and he saw that the one in the
  center who was being dragged forward by the others, was Maza an Ma Gong. Not
  daring to use his weapons for fear of striking the girl, he leaped from the
  bridge to the ground, then started out in pursuit just as the three
  disappeared inside the building.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">11.</a> &mdash; THE CAVERNS OF THE MOON</h2>

  <p class="first">It only took Ted a moment to reach the huge diamond shaped
  door through which the girl and her two abductors had disappeared, but when
  he entered it there was no one in sight.</p>

  <p>He found himself in an immense room, the ceiling of which was supported by
  carved figures scarcely less colossal than the ones which held up the
  portico. They represented huge, bandy-legged, round-bodied Lunites, with
  enormous heads and scrawny arms. The walls were shelved clear to the top, and
  the shelves were piled high with thousands of metal cylinders, varying in
  their diameters from two to about eight inches, but uniformly about fifteen
  inches in length. A few ornate ladders, the gilded sides of which represented
  lean-bodied dragons, stood against the walls, but many had fallen to the
  floor as had a number of the cylinders.</p>

  <p>Great cracks and breaches here and there in the walls showed the
  devastating effects of the explosion of his projectile, as did a considerable
  quantity of fallen plaster&mdash;and stone.</p>

  <p>The place was lighted by an indirect yellow radiance which came from the
  tops of the heads of the colossi, and was reflected by the glossy
  ceiling.</p>

  <p>Sprawled and huddled here and there on the floor were a great number of
  bodies of fallen Lunites. They were surrounded by great swarms of insects,
  and he judged from the appearance of those nearest him that they were in an
  advanced state of putrefaction. As he glanced around, he saw a huge gray
  creature, rat-like in appearance, but as large as a full grown Shetland pony,
  dart through one of the breaches in the wall, seize a body, and quickly carry
  it back whence it had come.</p>

  <p>The bodies, he noticed, were clothed in loose-fitting garments which
  slightly resembled pajamas, and the massive heads were not covered with glass
  helmets as had been those of the Lunites in the spherical craft he had just
  quitted. Evidently these were the bodies of a few of the people of Ur who had
  been slain by the explosion of his projectile.</p>

  <p>Ted gave slight heed to all these sights as he looked this way and that in
  the hope of seeing Maza an Ma Gong and her abductors. That they could not
  have traversed the length of the great hall in so short a time was obvious.
  They might, however, have been able to slip through the nearest breach in the
  wall before he reached the doorway.</p>

  <p>As he bounded forward to investigate this possibility, his path led him
  past one of the colossi. Without warning, a deadly green ray suddenly flashed
  from behind one of the gigantic limbs. As it struck the helmet of the young
  scientist he instinctively pointed and fired a pistol degravitor in the
  direction whence it had come. There was a flash of brilliant green light, a
  terrific pain in his head, and he crashed to the floor, the glass of his
  helmet tinkling on the hard tiles. Then came oblivion.</p>

  <p>How long he lay unconscious on the floor of the huge, subterranean
  building, Ted had no means of estimating. He awoke with a dull headache and
  the feeling that something was crushing him-bearing down on his body and
  limbs with terrific force.</p>

  <p>Raising his head to investigate, he cut his chin on the jagged remnant of
  his shattered glass visor before he was able to see what was lying across him
  &mdash;a number of pieces of what appeared to be broken plaster. After
  considerable effort he managed to work his arms free and unscrew the now
  useless collar of his helmet, with its menacing glass fragments.</p>

  <p>The air of the place, he noticed, was fairly cool and practically as dense
  as the atmosphere of the earth&mdash;a condition far different from that on
  the surface of the moon, where the atmosphere was extremely tenuous and the
  heat of the lunar mid-day far too great for the existence of unprotected men.
  It was good, he thought, to be able to breathe outside a glass helmet once
  more, even though the air was laden with unpleasant charnel odors.</p>

  <p>Five minutes of exhausting labor freed his body and lower limbs from the
  heavy fragments which pinned them to the floor. When he rose to survey the
  scene the cause of the fall of plaster was immediately apparent. His
  degravitator ray, fired in the direction from which the green ray, which bad
  destroyed the top of his helmet, bad come, had cut away the base of the
  supporting colossus behind which his assailant had been concealed, and this
  had crashed to the floor, carrying with it a considerable portion of the
  plastered ceiling which it had supported.</p>

  <p>Beside a leg of the image he saw the remains of a Lunite, partly destroyed
  by his degravitor ray&mdash;probably his attacker. Beneath the leg was the
  crushed, dead body of another Lunite, but of Maza an Ma Gong he saw no sign.
  Had she escaped, leaving him for dead beneath the heap of plaster? Or did her
  slender body lie crushed and bleeding under the fallen statue?</p>

  <p>Filled with apprehension, he walked clear around the prostrate image
  without seeing a sign of her whom he sought. Then he was startled to hear his
  name called: "Ted Dustin. Ted Dustin." It was the voice of Maza, and seemed
  to issue from the colossus. He leaped astride the giant body, seeking some
  hollow which might explain the enigma, but it was not until he had stepped
  out on one of the huge thighs that he saw the girl. She was imprisoned on the
  floor in the hollow between the two enormous knees.</p>

  <p>Drawing a pistol degravitor, he found it but the work of a moment to cut
  away enough of one of the huge legs to free the girl.</p>

  <p>The fact that she was unhurt, he judged little short of miraculous, but
  whether it was due to chance or to her own dexterity he had no means of
  finding out. She had the front of her helmet open, and he noticed that the
  antennae of her miniature radiophone were smashed.</p>

  <p>As soon as she was free she picked up a green ray projector which one of
  the Lunites had dropped, and started for the door, beckoning him to follow.
  They had barely reached the ramp when Ted heard a great clatter behind them
  and the sound of running feet. Turning, he saw a horde of armed men rushing
  through an archway in the rear of the building. Instead of glass helmets and
  furry clothing, these men wore metal helmets and plate armor, and carried, in
  addition to their ray projectors, long swords, and spears with heads like
  long- toothed buzz saws.</p>

  <p>With his degravitors leveled in two lethal arcs, Ted cut down the foremost
  ranks of the attackers and gave the others pause. Evidently they were
  dumfounded at the sight of weapons that fired invisible rays. While they
  hesitated he caught up his companion, and turning, bounded down the tiled
  ramp with mighty fifty foot leaps that amazed them still more, crossed a
  circular plaza over which were scattered indiscriminately, rock debris,
  fallen and broken statuary, and dead bodies, many of which were partly
  devoured, and dodged in among the remains of a fallen colossus.</p>

  <p>The clank of arms and accoutrements became increasingly audible, and Ted
  turned to see if any of their pursuers were in sight. At that moment his foot
  encountered empty air, and he fell, dragging his companion with him, into a
  steeply slanting tunnel which was about four feet in diameter at the
  mouth.</p>

  <p>Sliding and tumbling, the two at length brought up against the wall of a
  transverse passageway which slanted downward to their left.</p>

  <p>A shout and the clatter of weapons from the ground above brought Ted
  quickly to his feet. Helping his companion to arise, he took her hand and the
  two hurried down the inclined ramp. They had not covered more than a hundred
  feet before the way grew dark and the tunnel tortuous, so they were forced to
  proceed with the utmost caution. They felt their way along in the inky
  blackness for some time. Presently all sounds save those of their own
  footsteps ceased. Then Ted was suddenly and temporarily blinded by a glare of
  light. When his eyes had become accustomed to it, he saw that it came from a
  small lens fastened in his companion's helmet just above her forehead.
  Evidently she had not turned it on before for the sake of caution.</p>

  <p>Then it was the girl who became the leader in their flight. As they
  encountered a labyrinth of passageways, she would turn now to the right, now
  to the left, always following the ramps which slanted downward, and Ted saw
  her glance from time to time at queer Lunite symbols painted on the walls,
  which evidently marked the way.</p>

  <p>Presently she switched off her light, and Ted noticed that there was a
  strange, phosphorescent luminescence in the passageway ahead of them. Its
  source became apparent when they suddenly emerged from the end of the tunnel
  into a wide lane which wound through a thick grove of tall straight plants
  that appeared to Ted like gigantic shoots of asparagus painted with
  phosphorus. They varied from a thickness of six inches to well over three
  feet at the base, and some of the tallest towered fully seventy feet into the
  air. The light they gave off was quite as brilliant as the full moon appears
  from the earth, and was reflected by myriads of gleaming, white stalactites
  depending from an arched vault far above them. Stalagmites, also, gleamed
  here and there among the shining plants, and the lane or road which they were
  following was evidently made from the same white material crushed into small
  fragments and rolled smooth.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the girl grasped Ted's arm, and pulling him in among the tall,
  luminous trunks, secreted herself behind one of the larger ones and motioned
  him to do likewise.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had he followed her example, ere there came to his ears a
  cracking, rumbling sound. Then, from around the bend in the lane, there
  waddled a huge, hulking creature of most fearsome aspect. Ted had seen
  pictures of wingless Chinese dragons, and this ugly vision, now less than
  fifty feet from him, was one of those pictures immensely magnified&mdash;for
  it was as tall as a camel and three times as long. Just in front of its spiny
  crest and behind its relatively small ears, a round bodied Lunite was perched
  on its massive head. Luminous vapor issued from its nostrils at intervals of
  a few seconds, and the myriad scales that covered its long, twisting body, as
  well as its thousands of sharp dorsal spines, reflected the phosphorescent
  light of the forest that bordered the lane.</p>

  <p>This ugly monster straddled a long pole with its four bowed legs, the
  front end of which was attached to a U shaped collar that circled its scaly
  neck, and the rear end of which was fastened to a long chain of creaking,
  bumping carts, fastened together by hooks and rings. Each of these carts
  traveled on two large rollers in lieu of wheels, and contained many metal
  cylinders which jolted and banged together as the vehicle lumbered along.</p>

  <p>Walking beside the cart on each side was a long row of Lunites clad in
  sandals and coarse, loose fitting tunics that reached to the knees. The long
  black hair of these workmen was twisted up in a pointed, pagoda-like effect
  on top of the head. Each man carried a two handled metal urn, a short tube
  pointed at one end like a quill, and a small mallet.</p>

  <p>Behind the first dragon came two others, similarly harnessed and attended,
  and Ted, noticing that the last dragon snatched from time to time at the
  shoots of the luminous plants which grew by the roadside, munching each
  phosphorescent mouthful with apparent relish, saw the reason these creatures
  appeared to breathe fire. It was some time later that he learned this was a
  crew of sap gatherers, returning with a supply of cylinders filled with the
  luminous fluid with which the Lunite chemists made the yellow, light-emitting
  liquid which, suspended in transparent containers, lighted their underground
  cities.</p>

  <p>When the cavalcade had passed out of sight down the road the girl motioned
  him to rise, and together they resumed their flight. They passed many
  cross-lanes in the luminous forest, unmolested. Then the one on which they
  were traveling carne to an end.</p>

  <p>The cultivated area now gave way to an immense tangle of luminous and non-
  luminous plants of various hues and shades&mdash;a tremendous hodge podge of
  winding creepers, low fungi of every conceivable shape, and tall trunks,
  jointed, smooth, and spiny-some topped like mushrooms, spears, stars or
  globes, others with long waving fronts like palms or ferns.</p>

  <p>Most of the non-luminous plants were white, although some were gray or
  black. Here and there among the common phosphorescent types of luminous
  plants were scattered groups and individuals which gave off red, green, pink,
  violet or yellow light. Some of them emitted two or three shades of one
  color, or even several colors of light. The whole scene was a vast, weird,
  fairyland of color and shade-at once, beautiful and forbidding.</p>

  <p>Into this tangle the girl plunged without the slightest hesitation. Ted
  followed, a pistol degravitor in his hand ready for instant action.</p>

  <p>As they progressed further and further into this subterranean wilderness
  the fauna of the place became more and more in evidence, indicating to Ted
  that, if one might judge from the conduct of the wild things, they were
  gradually receding from the haunts of man.</p>

  <p>From the shadows many pairs of burning eyes glared out at them. Small
  animals, sensing their approach, scurried hastily from their pathway.
  Featherless birds, or winged reptiles&mdash;Ted did not know which to call
  them&mdash;flitted among the branches above their heads. Larger ones, some of
  them appearing huge enough to have flown off with elephants, soared far up
  near the vaulted roof or flapped lazily back and forth above the tree-tops,
  evidently in search of prey. Some of them had luminous body areas which
  gleamed dully as they flew, but flashed from time to time from crests,
  throats, or wing- tips like the display of a swarm of fireflies magnified ten
  thousand fold.</p>

  <p>There were luminous insects and worms, also, of various shades&mdash; and
  luminous serpents coiled on boles and branches, some of them flashing crests
  or tail-tips when disturbed as if to warn an intruder of their dangerous
  presence.</p>

  <p>The air was filled with a cacophonous medley of roars, bellows, croaks,
  shrieks, growls and hisses, sometimes interspersed with more melodious
  warbling, whistling or bell-like tones.</p>

  <p>At times huge monsters, most of them dragon-like dinosaurs, crashed
  fearlessly through the jungle, pausing now and again to crop herbage or
  devour huge mouthfuls of luminous fungus, and exhaling great clouds of
  phosphorescent vapor that hung like wraiths in the still air above their
  enormous heads.</p>

  <p>And everywhere was a dank, musty odor as if mold and matches had been
  mixed with stagnant water and brewed in a cauldron over a slow fire.</p>

  <p>Presently they emerged from the jungle into a broad savanna of white,
  jointed grass with luminous tips, that reached to Ted's shoulders. They
  walked side by side, now, and Ted noticed that the girl often glanced at a
  small instrument clamped on her wrist-evidently a compass.</p>

  <p>For a moment his attention was distracted by a pair of enormous creatures,
  each well over fifty feet in height, browsing leisurely not more than a
  quarter of a mile to his right. Then a fearful thing happened.</p>

  <p>Ted's first intimation of it was the whistle of giant pinions just behind
  him. Then something struck the back of his head, knocking him flat on his
  face.</p>

  <p>He scrambled to his feet and quickly brought up his pistol degravitor as
  he saw the girl, already far above the ground, struggling in the talons of a
  mighty flying reptile. His finger trembled on the trigger yet he did not pull
  it, for there suddenly came to him the realization that to destroy the
  monster would be to as surely kill the girl. A fall from that great height
  would have crushed her frail body to a pulp.</p>

  <p>The creature flew with terrific speed, and in a moment, had disappeared
  from view with its prey.</p>

  <p>Dejectedly, Ted holstered his degravitor. His downward glance fell on the
  green ray projector which the girl had carried&mdash;evidently knocked from
  her hand by the swoop of her captor.</p>

  <p>He was about to pick it up, when suddenly far off in the dim mistiness
  toward which she had been carried, he saw a brilliant, star-like light,
  moving rapidly. It was unlike the phosphorescent gleam of the light carrying
  flyers, and he instantly recognized its import. Maza had lighted her
  brilliant head lamp in a last, desperate effort to guide him to her
  rescue.</p>

  <p>With mighty bounds which, on earth, would have been phenomenal, but on the
  moon were quite normal leaps for his earth-trained muscles, he set out in
  swift pursuit.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">12.</a> &mdash; AERIAL BATTLE</h2>

  <p class="first">As Roger Sanders plunged downward from the sky, the
  fragments of Ted's shattered Blettendorf dropping around him, the three
  strange globes that had wrought such swift destruction with their green rays
  in so short a time, disappeared from view in a blinding whirl of cloud and
  snow. His parachute was whipped about by the force of the wind until he
  feared the lashings would be torn loose, but they held, and he presently
  landed, waist deep, in a snow drift.</p>

  <p>He was floundering about, endeavoring to extricate himself from the
  clutches of the wet, sticky mess, when suddenly he heard his name called:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sanders."</p>

  <p>He answered, and a moment later a figure shuffled toward him and helped
  him from the drift. It was Bevans.</p>

  <p>"Didn't fall in as deeply as you, sir," he said. "Landed in the middle of
  the road, while you went in the ditch. I've been walking along, calling your
  name in the hope of locating you."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice where the professor fell?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. He leaped before I did, and I saw him fall on the bridge of
  that strange globe. He tried to jump off again, but one of those
  diamond-shaped port holes opened, and he was dragged inside. I suppose they
  slaughtered him. A horrible ending for one of the greatest minds of the
  century."</p>

  <p>"Awful," replied Roger. "Ted will be broken up when he hears it&mdash;
  that is if he lives to hear it. But we can't help things any by crying about
  them. Any idea where we are?"</p>

  <p>"I should say we're somewhere in Indiana, sir, and not far from a flying
  field. Have you noticed the flashes of light and dark in the snow above us at
  regular intervals? Must be from a beacon."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's see if we can find out."</p>

  <p>Guided by the dimly seen flashes, the two at length found themselves at
  the airdrome of the South Bend Flying Field a government training station for
  student aviators since the advent of planes equipped to rise or descend
  vertically, and the consequent ability of experienced pilots to land "on a
  dime":</p>

  <p>Ridding themselves of a considerable weight of sticky snow by brushing
  each other, they entered the building, where a watchman, with a huge, foul-
  smelling cob pipe in his mouth, was playing a game of solitaire.</p>

  <p>Spying a radiovisiphone, Roger was hurrying toward it to make his report
  while Bevans explained things to the watchman, when the figure of a man in
  military uniform suddenly appeared in the disc. He read from a sheet of paper
  held in his hand:</p>

  <p>M. O. 318,246</p>

  <p>Three flying globes sighted by U. S. S. P's 347, 1098 and 221. 347
  destroyed by strange green ray from one of the globes. 1098 and 221 shelling
  them without apparent effect when their radios were silenced. All combat
  planes in Zone 36 are ordered to report, fully manned, to division
  headquarters, and stand by for orders.</p>

  <p>General J. Q. Marshall.</p>

  <p>"Oh, boy! There'll be some scrap, now!" said Roger, "but I'm afraid our
  planes won't stand much chance against those green rays. I'd like to be in on
  it, though."</p>

  <p>"I, too, sir," said Bevans.</p>

  <p>Roger rapidly whirled the dials of the radiovisiphone, presently obtaining
  direct communication with President Whitmore, to whom he made his report. He
  was ordered back to Chicago at once, a plane being requisitioned from the
  flying field for the purpose.</p>

  <p>As he and Bevans were about to take off they noticed six combat planes,
  manned and waiting orders. These rose only a few seconds after they did.</p>

  <p>The air was now much warmer, the snow having been replaced by a faint
  drizzle of rain. This, too, subsided before they had flown half way to their
  destination, but a heavy fog, following the swift melting of the snow, made
  the visibility exceedingly low.</p>

  <p>Despite this handicap, however, the skillful Bevans landed his plane
  neatly on the roof of the Dustin Building, turning it over to another of
  Ted's pilots to be returned immediately to the flying field.</p>

  <p>The cold weather had passed as quickly as it had come, and this fact added
  to the evidence that it had been directly produced by the giant green ray
  from the moon.</p>

  <p>Back in his office, Roger quickly communicated with his wife by wrist
  radiophone&mdash;then waded into the mass of work which had accumulated
  during his absence. According to the shop reports the great interplanetary
  vehicle would soon be ready for launching. But fully as important as this, he
  found that ten thousand pistol degravitors and a thousand large degravitors
  for use on combat planes were completed and ready to be loaded with the
  special anode-cathode ray batteries in process in another division. Turning
  to the report of the superintendent of the battery division, he found that a
  hundred of the large and five hundred of the small batteries were ready for
  use.</p>

  <p>Going to the safe, he took out the directions for assembling and firing
  which Ted had left, and after giving them a careful reading, ordered ten of
  the large and a hundred of the small weapons and an equal number of suitable
  anode- cathode batteries sent up to his office.</p>

  <p>Morning came before he had completed his work of assembling them. Then,
  carrying a large and a small degravitor to the roof, he tested them on the
  remains of Ted's metal hangar and found that they worked satisfactorily.</p>

  <p>Hurrying back to his office he set the safety catch on every weapon =then
  ordered them packed and loaded into one of Ted's freight-carrying
  electroplanes. And hour later, with Bevans as pilot, he was on his way to
  Washington.</p>

  <p>As he neared the capital he used his binoculars on the surrounding
  territory, and noticed the havoc wrought by the green rays. At points where
  the effects of the rays had ended, rivers and creeks were blocked by ice
  gorges, overflowing the surrounding territory. The vegetation was wilted and
  lifeless, as if blighted by a heavy frost. In the villages and towns, Red
  Cross workers were going from house to house, relieving the sufferings of the
  survivors, followed by undertakers' cars and large trucks, loaded with the
  canvas-wrapped remains of those who would suffer no more.</p>

  <p>On his arrival at the Capitol he sought and gained an immediate interview
  with the President.</p>

  <p>The chief executive of the country looked up from the stack of papers on
  his desk as Roger entered, and greeted him with:</p>

  <p>"Now, what the devil are you doing here? I thought I ordered you back to
  Chicago last night. Who is going to look after your plant and radio station
  with both you and Dustin away?"</p>

  <p>"Important business," replied Roger. "I'll be leaving for Chicago again
  within the hour, but I've something to show you that, for the present, I
  don't dare make public over the air."</p>

  <p>"What about your code? Afraid someone will figure them out?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all, but this is something you will have to be shown. I have some
  new weapons invented by Mr. Dustin, a few of which have been manufactured in
  his plant under my direction during his absence&mdash;weapons with which I
  believe we can successfully combat the green rays of the moon men."</p>

  <p>"Where are they?"</p>

  <p>"In one of our freight carriers, now on the roof of the Lincoln Hotel
  under guard."</p>

  <p>Without waiting to hear more, President Whitmore seized his hat and
  said:</p>

  <p>"We'll have a look at them right now."</p>

  <p>On the way out he gave orders that Secretary of War Jamison and General
  Marshall meet him on the roof of the Lincoln in fifteen minutes. Once out of
  the Capitol, they were quickly transported to the hotel roof in the
  President's private helicopter limousine.</p>

  <p>Roger brought out one of the pistol degravitors, unwrapped it, and
  explained its use to the chief executive. Then he had an old propeller blade
  suspended on a wire, and proceeded to demolish it before the eyes of the
  astonished President.</p>

  <p>At this moment Secretary Jamison and General Marshall arrived, and another
  old blade was disintegrated for their benefit.</p>

  <p>Secretary Jamison, a newly appointed civilian, showed wonder and
  amazement, but General Marshall seemed unconvinced.</p>

  <p>"What is the effective range of this weapon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The theoretical range of this one," replied Roger, "as worked out by Mr.
  Dustin, is one mile. In other words, it is supposed to completely
  disintegrate any known matter of any possible hardness or tensile strength,
  up to that distance. Beyond that distance, however, it would be deadly to man
  or animals, even though it should not completely destroy their bodies, up to
  a distance of perhaps two miles. I have with me, also, weapons constructed on
  the same principle, but much larger, with a theoretical range of twenty-five
  miles."</p>

  <p>"Have the weapons been tested at the ranges you name?"</p>

  <p>"Not to my knowledge, but when Mr. Dustin figures something out it is
  usually right."</p>

  <p>"I would respectfully suggest, Mr. President," said the General, stiffly,
  "that they be so tested."</p>

  <p>"And I was about to suggest the same thing," rejoined Roger.</p>

  <p>"We'll make the tests at once," decided the President. "While the General
  is arranging for the aerial targets you may get out one of the larger
  weapons, Mr. Sanders."</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes later, Roger and the President were hovering on the shore
  of Chesapeake Bay in the latter's helicopter limousine. Several hundred feet
  above the General and the Secretary of War hovered in a government plane,
  while one of their men directed the four aerial targets, miniature helicopter
  planes controlled by radio.</p>

  <p>When one of them had flown a distance of a mile out over the bay the
  General signaled Roger who promptly brought it down with his pistol
  degravitor. A second, placed two miles away, presently crumpled and fell,
  although it withstood about five minutes' exposure to the rays of the small
  weapon at that distance.</p>

  <p>Then Roger mounted his large degravitor on a tripod, and with the
  assistance of his powerful field glasses, brought down one of the targets
  which meanwhile bad been stationed at a distance of twenty-five miles up the
  bay. The fourth target, placed thirty-five miles away, which was as far as he
  could see it with his glasses, suffered a similar fate after only a few
  seconds exposure to the rays.</p>

  <p>"Marvelous!" commented the President, as they winged their way back to the
  Capitol. "How many of these degravitors are ready for use?"</p>

  <p>"I brought ten of the large and a hundred of the small ones with me,"
  replied Roger. "Within the week I can send you ninety more of the large and
  four hundred of the small."</p>

  <p>"And how fast can you turn them out after that?"</p>

  <p>"We are equipped to turn out five hundred small and one hundred large a
  week. If more are required we can enlarge our capacity at any time."</p>

  <p>"Let the order stand on the weekly basis you mention, then," said the
  President as they got out of the limousine, "unless I send you word to
  increase it."</p>

  <p>They returned once more to the President's office, where he was
  immediately signaled by the radiovisiphone operator.</p>

  <p>"World News Broadcasters on the air will announce important tidings from
  China in one minute. Shall I tune them in, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the President, seating himself at his desk and watching the
  disc.</p>

  <p>A picture of the World News Announcer quickly flashed on the screen, and
  he stood looking at them for a moment, holding his chronometer in one hand
  and a sheet of paper in the other. Then he said:</p>

  <p>"Our correspondent in Peiping announces that the three strange globes from
  the moon, which destroyed three scout planes with their green rays last night
  and then disappeared, arrived in Peiping this morning.</p>

  <p>"A dozen of the queer, round-bodied men immediately went into conference
  with the Chinese president and his cabinet. As soon, however, as the odd
  visitors had been described to the Chinese people, and, of course, seen by
  many of them, and it became generally known that the government purposed
  submitting to the rule of the moon government and assisting the lunar emperor
  to conquer the earth, a revolution was fomented and the Capitol attacked.</p>

  <p>"The Chinese president and the members of his cabinet were all slain in
  the battle that followed, as were the twelve moon men closeted with them.
  After laying waste the greater part of the city, and killing hundreds of
  thousands with their green rays, the globes then departed, flying eastward.
  They were last sighted flying high over southern Japan with terrific speed,
  apparently bound for the United States.</p>

  <p>"General Fu Yen, the revolutionary leader and new provisional president,
  announces his intention to stand by the other nations of the world in the war
  with the moon, and will shortly send official messages to the other powers to
  that effect. It is believed that he is supported in this decision by at least
  ninety percent of the Chinese people.</p>

  <p>"One of his first official acts was to place Dr. Fang, the Manchu, under
  arrest as an instigator of the plot to sell out the nation to the moon
  monarch, Dr. Wu, his co-conspirator, having been slain with the former
  president and cabinet members during the attack on the Capitol."</p>

  <p>"Interesting, and vastly relieving, if true," commented the President, "so
  far as the Chinese are concerned. But we still have those flying globes to
  contend with. They are on their way over here now, and nobody knows how fast
  they can travel. I think you brought out the new weapons in the nick of time,
  Mr. Sanders. Would you care to direct a combat squadron sent out to meet our
  belligerent visitors?"</p>

  <p>"I'd be delighted with the honor," replied Roger.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Hurry over and get your weapons unlimbered. I'll have ten
  expert gunners over at the hotel roof in as many minutes, and while you are
  explaining the weapons to them, five combat planes will be made ready."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, Roger, with the help of Bevans, was hastily unloading
  the large degravitors from the freighter, when an air alarm siren sounded
  below them, followed by another and another until the city was in an
  uproar.</p>

  <p>In a moment a fleet of combat planes left the ground and headed westward.
  Using his glasses, Roger saw the reason. The three huge lunar globes which
  had, only a few minutes before, been reported on the way to the United
  States, were flying swiftly toward the Capitol, raking the ground beneath
  them with their deadly green rays, more than a dozen of which shone from each
  globe&mdash;and occasionally destroying aircraft that approached them.</p>

  <p>Standing on the hotel roof beside Ted's aerial freighter was the
  helicopter limousine of the President. Its chauffeur was idly leaning against
  a wing, watching the fast disappearing squadron which had just risen.</p>

  <p>"Quick, Bevans!" said Roger. "It's you and me for it! Grab those controls
  and I'll bring a degravitor!"</p>

  <p>They rose, a moment later, with helicopters roaring, while the President's
  pilot, who had lost his prop and his balance, scrambled to his feet and gaped
  after them. The plane was a swift one, and in a few minutes Bevans had
  brought it close behind the aerial squadron.</p>

  <p>"Straight up, now," ordered Roger, "and make it snappy."</p>

  <p>As they began their assent the battle started with the rattle of machine
  guns and the boom of rapid fire turret guns. Then the globes, apparently
  unharmed by the gunfire, began systematically wiping out the defense squadron
  with their green rays. One by one, huge combat planes were crumpling and
  crashing to the ground, when Roger brought his degravitor to bear on the
  foremost globe. His invisible ray cut a round hole about four feet in
  diameter clear through the center of the lunar vehicle, with no apparent
  effect on its progress or lethal ray projectors. But be had only to lower,
  then slightly elevate his weapon, and the globe was divided as neatly as a
  knife divides an apple, both halves crashing instantly to the ground.</p>

  <p>Swinging his degravitor into line on another globe, Roger proceeded to
  halve it as he had the first, but before he could turn it on the third globe,
  the latter, its commander apparently fearing the fate of the first two,
  elevated its forward disc and shot straight up into the air with such
  appalling speed that it disappeared completely in a moment.</p>

  <p>Roger clapped his binoculars to his eyes, but even they failed to reveal
  the swiftly flying globe.</p>

  <p>"No use to follow that bird, Bevans," he said. "He's well on his way to
  the moon by this time. Let's go and have a look at the ones we brought
  down."</p>

  <p>They descended, but a half dozen of the government combat planes were
  ahead of them, and the men were dragging the bodies of stunned and dead
  Lunites from the wrecks when they arrived. Forty dazed prisoners, most of
  whom had fractured limbs, were taken from the wrecks, and twenty-six
  bodies.</p>

  <p>Roger's great fear was that he might find the body of Professor Ederson in
  the wrecks, but there was no sign of it. Either he had been completely
  destroyed by the degravitor rays, or was in the globe which had escaped.</p>

  <p>Only thirty of the squadron of fifty combat planes which had flown out to
  meet the foe accompanied Roger back to the Capitol. The others, together with
  their crews, had been utterly destroyed by the green rays.</p>

  <p>Back in the President's office, Roger received the commendation of the
  chief executive with a deprecatory shrug.</p>

  <p>"It was nothing," he said. "Easier than breaking clay pigeons with a trap
  gun."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe the General will ask for any more demonstrations," smiled
  the President. "From now on, he'll be crying night and day for
  degravitors."</p>

  <p>At this moment the President's radiovisiphone operator appeared in the
  disc and said:</p>

  <p>"Chicago is calling Mr. Sanders, Sir."</p>

  <p>"Tune them in," said the President.</p>

  <p>There instantly appeared in the disc, the face of Ted's day operator, Miss
  Whitley.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stanley, in charge of the big radiovisiphone, thinks the moon people
  are trying to get in touch with us," she said.</p>

  <p>"Tell him to hold them, if he can, until we can silence all broadcasting
  stations," replied Roger. "Then connect me with him."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">13.</a> &mdash; FLYING REPTILES</h2>

  <p class="first">Despite the mighty bounds with which Ted Dustin pursued the
  hideous flying reptile which was carrying off Maza of the Moon, the star-like
  gleam of her head lamp quickly grew more dim, showing that he was being
  rapidly outdistanced.</p>

  <p>Presently it twinkled and went out, but he continued his pace, unabated,
  in the same direction.</p>

  <p>As he hurried on, huge herbivorous dinosaurs, disturbed at their feeding,
  raised their massive heads from time to time to contemptuously snort fiery
  vapor at the queer and insignificant creature that bounded past them. Mighty
  reptilian carnivores, their bloody feasts interrupted, were more hostile,
  snarling or roaring hideously when he passed close to them, but he paid no
  heed to either.</p>

  <p>Once his path was barred by a great, quill covered creature resembling a
  tiger, with the exception of the tail, which was a short, thick,
  spine-covered stub. It was larger than a draft horse, and presented a most
  fearsome appearance. With gleaming tusks bared, and sickle-like claws
  unsheathed, it sprang for him.</p>

  <p>He halted, digging his toes into the ground for an instant to stop his
  forward momentum&mdash;then leaped backward, alighting fully fifty feet
  behind the spot on which he had stood. Before the creature could spring again
  he brought both pistol degravitors into play, and although the invisible
  beams played for but a moment across the huge breast of the beast, it was as
  if a giant scythe had suddenly cut through it, dividing the dorsal part of
  the body from the ventral. The claws and belly, apparently impelled by
  something akin to reflex action, leaped weakly forward, but the head and
  upper part of the body slipped off and fell to the ground behind them.</p>

  <p>Without pausing to view the unusual sight of four massive legs wobbling
  disjointedly about carrying a great, sagging belly, Ted again pressed
  forward.</p>

  <p>Presently the character of the country he was crossing changed. At first
  the shimmering, undulating surface of the savanna was broken by occasional
  outcroppings of white stone, mostly conical in form, but as he progressed,
  the vegetation grew more and more sparse until it disappeared altogether. He
  was in a forest of white columns, cones and pyramids&mdash;mighty stalagmites
  that dwarfed to insignificance anything of which he had ever heard or read,
  reaching up ward toward equally huge stalactites, depending from the vaulted
  roof above. The ground beneath his feet was completely covered by rock
  fragments, varying in bulk from mere white powder to huge boulders weighing
  thousands of tons evidently the remains of both stalactites and stalagmites
  dislodged by seismic disturbances.</p>

  <p>His pace was slackened by these constant obstructions, and by the fact
  that the light gradually diminished in intensity as he drew away from the
  luminous vegetation. As he penetrated further and further into the deepening
  gloom that shrouded the ghostly columns there came to him the conviction that
  his quest was well nigh hopeless. There came, also, in the dark moment, the
  realization that the girl he had known for so short a time had come to mean
  far more to him than a mere companion in adventure&mdash;that if she were
  dead, life would have little to offer him.</p>

  <p>Tired and dejected, he sat down on a boulder to rest and to think.
  Automatically he reached in his pocket for his black briar. As he did so, a
  tiny pebble suddenly fell at his feet. Several more followed as he quickly
  glanced upward.</p>

  <p>Just behind him the huge stump of a broken stalagmite, fully a hundred
  feet in diameter and forty feet to where it had been cracked off, reared its
  shattered head. Turning his gaze toward it, he saw the tip of a huge pinion
  brushing back and forth across the edge as if its owner were engaged in a
  struggle. But most important of all, he noticed that the end of the wing as
  well as the broken edges of the stalagmite were bathed in a white radiance
  which differed in color and appearance from the phosphorescent luminosity of
  the lunar flora and fauna. Was it from the head lamp of Maza?</p>

  <p>Bounding to his feet, he looked in vain for a place to climb the
  stalactite. Then, remembering the advantage his earthly muscles gave him, he
  backed up for a few paces, took a running start, and sprang into the air.</p>

  <p>He had hoped to be able to catch hold of the rim of the broken top, but to
  his surprise, he passed completely over it, alighting in a cup-like
  depression about twenty feet in diameter which housed two of the homeliest
  looking creatures on which he had ever set eyes. They were scrawny, long
  legged, goggle eyed caricatures of the flying reptile which had carried off
  his companion some time before. Standing on the edge of the rim, dangling the
  girl by one leg in its huge mandibles and balancing itself with outspread
  wings, was the reptile itself, apparently trying to feed her to its young.
  That they had been unable, thus far, to do more than strip some of the wool
  from her armor, was evinced by the condition of their saw-edged bills, which
  both were shaking for the evident purpose of trying to rid them of the
  annoying fuzz.</p>

  <p>All this, Ted saw at a glance, and no sooner saw than he acted. Whipping
  out a degravitor, he completely severed the great, arched neck of the reptile
  with a single sweep of its deadly ray-then caught the girl in his arms as she
  fell headlong, and was himself knocked to the floor by the falling, hissing
  head of the monster, while its giant body fluttered and toppled backward to
  crash to the ground a moment later. Partly stunned though he was by the blow
  from that huge head, he quickly dispatched the two hideous young ones with
  his degravitors&mdash;then turned his attention to the girl who lay across
  his lap.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were closed and her head hung limply against the side of her
  glass helmet. Quickly opening her visor, he chafed her cheeks and forehead
  and blew on her eyelids, the faint flutter of which presently notified him
  that her consciousness was returning.</p>

  <p>"Ted&mdash;Ted Dustin," she murmured, and snuggled more closely to
  him.</p>

  <p>He held her thus for a few moments, his heart beats registering an
  acceleration that could not possibly have been due to his recent exertions.
  Then she opened her great blue eyes, looked up into his, and said:</p>

  <p>"Kari na Ultu."</p>

  <p>This, he interpreted to mean: "Go to Ultu," so he, not having sufficient
  lunar vocabulary to ask her in what direction, managed to convey his question
  by signs.</p>

  <p>She sat up, looked at the instrument strapped to her wrist for a moment,
  then pointed in the direction in which they had been traveling.</p>

  <p>"Ultu," she said.</p>

  <p>For answer, he rose, still holding her in his arms, walked to the edge of
  the stalagmite, and stepped off, alighting at the end of the forty foot fall
  with no more of a jar than a similar step from a height of seven feet would
  have caused on earth.</p>

  <p>Her little exclamation of alarm as they fell was changed to a cry of
  surprise and delight when she saw they had reached the ground unhurt. Then
  she signed that she wished to be put down.</p>

  <p>He gently lowered her to her feet, and together they pressed on into the
  deepening gloom&mdash;their way now made easier by the light of the girl's
  head lamp, reflected with many weird effects by the spectral white
  columns.</p>

  <p>For many miles they traveled through murk so black that it seemed almost
  to have solidity, their range of vision limited to the small area lighted by
  Maza's head lamp. Then a faint phosphorescent twilight tempered the thick
  darkness, and scattered tufts of luminous vegetation led into a mighty,
  tangled jungle, as well lighted by its own flora as the first one they had
  crossed.</p>

  <p>Before they entered it, Ted unholstered one of his degravitors and,
  handing it to his companion, showed her how to fire it by pressing the
  trigger. She tested it, first on a clump of luminous toadstools and then on a
  small flying reptile, and he was delighted to see that her marksmanship was
  excellent, due, no doubt, to her proficiency with a red ray projector.</p>

  <p>Then she extinguished her head lamp, and together they plunged into the
  riotous medley of sound and color, of strange smells and stranger sights that
  constituted a lunar subterranean forest.</p>

  <p>After more than an hour of travel through the jungle without molestation
  from any of its queer creatures, they arrived at the bank of a swiftly
  flowing stream about sixty feet across.</p>

  <p>The girl took a small drinking cup from a pocket of her armor, dipped it
  in the stream, and offered it to Ted, but he gallantly shook his head,
  indicating that she should drink first. She did so, sipping the water slowly
  as if it had been the last glass of some priceless wine of rare and ancient
  vintage. Ted filled his canteen in the meanwhile, and drank a deep draught,
  finding the water slightly alkaline, but quite palatable.</p>

  <p>Having drunk her water, Maza opened two clasps which loosed her glass
  helmet, and lifted it from her head. Then she sat down on a low toadstool and
  began a minute examination of the fine wires on the crest which constituted
  the antennae of her radio set. She worked with them for some time, her white
  brow often wrinkled in puzzlement, but presently gave up with a shrug of
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>Then Ted, who had been watching her intently, took the helmet from her
  hands and closely examined the broken head-set himself. His knowledge of
  radio, combined with his extraordinary inventive genius, stood him in such
  good stead that it was not long before he had located the source of the
  trouble.</p>

  <p>While he set rapidly to work to repair the damage with tools from his
  pocket kit, his companion gathered some dried and broken ribs of tree fronds
  that had fallen nearby and ignited them with a tiny red ray from a small
  lighter she carried. Then, taking Ted's hunting knife from its sheath, she
  cut several slabs from a pear shaped mushroom that grew near the water's
  edge, spitted them on a green frond, and grilled them over the fire.</p>

  <p>By the time Ted had finished his work of repairing her small radio set,
  she had spread the top of a toadstool with large flat leaves in lieu of a
  table cover, and placed thereon tastily grilled slabs of mushrooms, together
  with several varieties of small fruits which grew in abundance all around
  them.</p>

  <p>Returning her helmet to her, Ted showed his admiration of her lunar
  woodcraft and culinary skill by seating himself opposite her and heartily
  falling to. The mushroom slabs were delicious, and the odd fruits
  exceptionally palatable.</p>

  <p>When they had finished, Maza pressed the signal button connected to her
  head set, there was an answering voice, and she immediately began a
  conversation which lasted several minutes, but which Ted was, of course,
  unable to understand. Once he saw her glance at the instrument on her wrist,
  and judged that she was telling someone their location. Presently she ceased
  talking, walked to a bed of moss beneath some long, overhanging fronds, and
  lay down as if to sleep, motioning Ted to do likewise.</p>

  <p>Tired as he was, Ted could not bring himself to even think of closing his
  eyes in so insecure a spot, so he sat down on the moss beside her,
  unholstered his degravitor, and patting it, indicated that he would guard her
  while she slept. She closed her eyes without protest, and presently the
  regular rise and fall of her small, shapely bosom indicated that she was
  asleep.</p>

  <p>For several hours Ted amused himself by watching the strange creatures of
  the earth, air and water. Giant saurians, with necks gracefully arched,
  paddled lazily past, sometimes darting their heads with lightning like
  rapidity into the water, and usually bringing up fish or small amphibians in
  their powerful jaws. Small flying reptiles, soaring low, sometimes descended
  to the surface of the water, sometimes dived beneath it, triumphantly
  emerging with living, wriggling food morsels which they usually swallowed as
  they flew, with little or no mastication.</p>

  <p>But tired nature gradually asserted itself, and Ted finally caught himself
  nodding. He shook himself awake, but eventually nodded again, and thinking to
  close his eyes for but a moment, slept.</p>

  <p>His awakening, he knew not how long thereafter, was rude and startling,
  for a warrior clad in glittering silver armor was kneeling on his chest,
  holding the point of a keen sword to his throat while two others, similarly
  accoutered, held his arms against the ground. His first thought was for the
  safety of his girl companion, but a glance showed him that she was completely
  surrounded by a ring of the armored soldiers.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">14.</a>A NOTE OF APPEAL</h2>

  <p class="first">Having leaped from Ted's Blettendorf ahead of his
  companions, Professor Ederson was unable to see what had become of Roger and
  Bevans, for his parachute opened almost instantly, shutting out his view
  above.</p>

  <p>What he did see, however, filled him with apprehension and horror, for he
  was falling directly onto one of the huge globes that had wrought such havoc
  with the Blettendorf and with the government patrol planes.</p>

  <p>In vain, he endeavored to sway his body to one side as he hurtled downward
  toward the enemy craft. There was a sudden shock as he struck the curved
  bridge&mdash;then his parachute bellied out to a horizontal position. Badly
  shaken though he was, he tried to rise and leap over the railing, but at this
  moment a diamond shaped door opened, and a rotund figure clad in yellow fur
  and wearing a pagoda shaped helmet with a glass visor raised, leaped upon
  him. With a short, curved knife, his assailant slashed the ropes which bound
  him to his parachute&mdash;then dragged him inside the globe, slamming a door
  after him.</p>

  <p>Despite his feeble struggles, for he had been weakened by the shock of his
  fall, his captor bound his wrists behind him and jerked him to his feet. Then
  he pushed him roughly along a narrow hall&mdash;opened a diamond shaped door,
  and flung him into a tiny cell. The door clanged behind him as he fell,
  bruised and half stunned, to the metal floor, and he was left alone in
  stuffy, inky darkness.</p>

  <p>How long he lay in the black hole, suffering from a dozen bruises and the
  pain of his tightly bound wrists, the professor had no means of knowing, for
  his luminous chronometer was on his left wrist, and his hands were tied
  behind him.</p>

  <p>He judged, however, that he had spent slightly more than an hour in the
  stuffy room when the door opened. He was jerked to his feet by the fellow who
  had captured him, and led down a narrow passageway into a commodious cabin
  where an extremely portly Lunite, whose pagoda-like helmet was taller than
  that of his fellows, sat cross-legged on a raised dais, examining a scroll
  which lay on a small, diamond-shaped table before him.</p>

  <p>He looked up as the professor was dragged before him, disclosing a puffy,
  rotund countenance decorated by a long, thin moustache that drooped below the
  lowest fold of his enormous triple chin. His little, slanting eyes glittered
  triumphantly as they took in the figure of the professor.</p>

  <p>"You have done well, Lin Ching&mdash;even better than I thought," he said,
  "for this is the worm who tried to communicate with our great lord, P'an- ku,
  after all diplomatic relations had been severed with Du Gong. I recognize him
  from the picture flashed on our screens when he tried to send a message to
  which we refused to respond. He is evidently a linguist&mdash;perhaps can
  even speak with us."</p>

  <p>"If this be true, I will begin by teaching him manners," said Lin Ching.
  "Make obeisance, low and miserable creature of Du Gong, to the mighty Kwan
  Tsu Khan, commander in chief of the Imperial Navy of P'an-ku."</p>

  <p>"I am an Am-Er-I-Khan, myself," replied the professor slowly, in order
  that he might properly use the unaccustomed language, "and make obeisance to
  none but the great God of my fathers."</p>

  <p>The fat Kwan Tsu Khan rubbed his chubby hands together and actually
  beamed.</p>

  <p>"Better and better, Lin Ching," he said "You have captured a great as well
  as a wise man." He turned to the professor. "How did you learn our language,
  Am-Er-I-Khan?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"By studying the modern speech and ancient manuscripts of the descendants
  of that P'an-ku who, thousands of years ago, journeyed from your world to
  mine," replied the professor.</p>

  <p>"Bring a cushion for the Khan from Du Gong, and cut his bonds," ordered
  Kwan Tsu Khan. "Then retire outside the door, that we may hold private
  converse."</p>

  <p>Lin Ching drew his sharp knife and severed the bonds which held the
  professor's numbed wrists behind his back. Then he brought a great, thick
  cushion which he placed on the floor behind his captive, and assisted him to
  sit down. After a deep obeisance toward the dais, he retired to the
  passageway, closing the diamond-shaped door after him.</p>

  <p>"Now, Am-Er-I-Khan," said Kwan Tsu Khan, "just how much do you know about
  the history of that great and worshipful P'an-ku who journeyed to your world
  so long ago? And what can you tell me of his descendants?"</p>

  <p>"I have only conjectured that such a person existed and traveled to our
  world," replied the professor, chafing his numbed wrists. "Even his
  descendants, who are today numerous as the celestial stars, refer to him only
  as the first man, their first ancestor. It was by combining the statements in
  your message to us with the traditions of the descendants of P'an-ku and
  noting the easily recognized racial resemblance as well as the philological
  similarity, that I formed my theory."</p>

  <p>"Your conjecture," said Kwan Tsu Khan, "must be correct, for our most
  ancient records tell of the journey of one of the mightiest of our P'an-kus
  to Du Gong, after our terrific battle with Lu Gong had vitiated our surface
  atmosphere to such an extent that life on Ma Gong was impossible except in
  the deepest caves. But nothing was ever heard from P'an-ku thereafter, and it
  was thought that he lost his life in the attempt to reach Du Gong."</p>

  <p>"That is interesting," answered the professor. "I understand that you
  refer to your world as Ma Gong, and to mine as Du Gong, but may I ask what Lu
  Gong is?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Lu Gong is the world which circles the great Lord Sun in an orbit
  just outside that of Du Gong&mdash;the world which appears red to your
  watchers of the sky."</p>

  <p>"Then Lu Gong is the world we call Mars," said the professor. "And you
  have a tradition of a war with Mars?"</p>

  <p>"We have more than a tradition. Our world carries the scars of that war,
  and will carry them to eternity."</p>

  <p>"I should be interested in hearing about it."</p>

  <p>"Very well, but I can only review it briefly, as time presses. Many
  thousands of years ago our world was a planet with its own orbit, which was
  midway between that of your world and Lu Gong, or Mars, as you call it. It
  rotated on its axis, even as do your planet and Lu Gong, and its days and
  nights were shorter and its years longer than your own are today.</p>

  <p>"For millions of years my people had inhabited and dominated Ma Gong
  &mdash;developing a high civilization, and scientists who had explored the
  infinitely small and the infinitely great. Our interplanetary vehicles had
  traveled to and explored the other worlds that served the Great Lord Sun, as
  well as their numerous satellites, and on some of these we found human
  beings, but on none but Lu Gong did we find beings with a culture that even
  approached our own.</p>

  <p>"Soon a regular freight and passenger line was in service between Ma Gong
  and Lu Gong, and we traded and visited with that accursed race of slim, white
  beings in all friendliness. Then they sent a colony of their pale people to
  live on Ma Gong, and we sent a colony of our own people to settle on Lu Gong.
  From the start these white colonists made trouble. Presently blood was shed,
  reprisals followed, and things went so far that war was eventually declared
  between the two worlds&mdash;a war which wiped out the people of Lu Gong, and
  most of the people of Ma Gong&mdash;destroying also, the culture of a million
  years on our world.</p>

  <p>"The terrific weapons which the people of Lu Gong used were huge clusters
  of meteoroids which they hurled at us, after condensing them in
  interplanetary space by bringing into play certain magnetic lines of force
  which they were able to control. The face of our world still bears the
  hideous dents where these clusters fell. Many wiped out millions of helpless
  people, destroying the work of centuries. The interplanetary fleets, battling
  with their rays&mdash; ours green, those of Lu Gong red&mdash;practically
  destroyed each other.</p>

  <p>"Our people were unable to condense and hurl meteoric matter as the people
  of Lu Gong did, but they were not lacking in scientific knowledge, and the
  great P'an-ku who ruled them at the time set up great ray projectors clear
  around our world, several of which were constantly trained on the enemy
  planet. The purpose of these rays was to destroy the atmosphere of Lu Gong,
  dissipating it into interplanetary space, and eventually stifling all the
  inhabitants of that world.</p>

  <p>"The worst drawback to this method of warfare was that it slowly vitiated
  our own atmosphere where the beams passed through it, and thus constituted a
  system of slow suicide.</p>

  <p>"No quarter was asked, and there was none given on either side. Meanwhile
  our scientists, who had succeeded experimentally in slightly perturbing the
  motion of our world around the sun, asked permission of P'an-ku to construct
  a huge electro-magnetic power plant with which they might control the motion
  of Ma Gong at will, and thus dodge the huge missiles of Lu Gong which were
  daily wiping out our cities and decimating our population. He granted them
  permission, and they soon increased the number of their power units to such a
  degree that they were ready to try to control the orbit of Ma Gong.</p>

  <p>"The units worked, and the plan was to move Ma Gong behind your world,
  where it would be shielded from the bombardment of meteoric clusters. This
  was accomplished, but when the proper place had been reached, the scientists
  came in contact with terrific magnetic forces on which they had not
  counted&mdash; their power units were incapacitated, and they found
  themselves not only bound to the Great Lord Sun, but to your world as well.
  Ma Gong's axial rotation was affected, so it eventually became as you now
  observe it. Its orbit, after it settled down, was much as it is today, so
  that it was now behind your world, now racing ahead on an outer curve, now
  lagging behind on an inner one, only to be caught up at a certain point and
  jerked forward once more to repeat the whole process.</p>

  <p>"The bombardment from Lu Gong continued until both worlds were nearly
  without people to carry on the battle. P'an-ku, himself, was slain when the
  imperial city was destroyed by a meteoric cluster. The atmosphere of Ma Gong
  became so thin that the few people who remained alive did so because they
  retreated into the great inner caverns where what remained of the atmosphere
  had flown like water flows&mdash;toward the source of gravitational pull.</p>

  <p>"The operators of the great ray projectors finally died at their posts for
  want of air. The bombardment from Lu Gong gradually waned as its inhabitants
  succumbed to the power of our ray projectors, until it ceased altogether.</p>

  <p>"Only a few hundreds of our people were left alive in the great caverns,
  and there was not among them one scientist for the scientists had all died in
  defense of our world. So far as scientific knowledge went, the race was thus
  set back for thousands of years. The simple people who had fled to the caves-
  for the most part agriculturalists and tradesmen-knew not how to construct an
  interplanetary vehicle, a green ray projector, an atmosphere disintegrator,
  or any of the thousands of useful but intricate devices formerly made by this
  desire to live and, if possible, perpetuate his race and his imperial
  line."</p>

  <p>"But what of the white race which now inhabits Ma Gong?" asked the
  professor. "Whence did they come?"</p>

  <p>"About twelve hundred years after the great war," said Kwan Tsu Khan, "a
  party of our ancestors who were exploring the surface of our world, met a
  party of white people, descendants of the Lu Gong colonists they afterward
  learned, who had fled to the inner caverns during the great war. They, too,
  had invented heat proof, cold proof suits and concentrated air tanks which
  enabled them to travel on the crust of our world. A parley was started, but
  because of the great hatred between the two races, a quarrel quickly became a
  battle, and only a few of the explorers from either side returned to tell
  their stories to their respective countrymen.</p>

  <p>"This started a war between the two races once more, and my people were
  conquered because, while the enemy had succeeded in manufacturing their red
  ray projectors, our scientists had been unable, thus far, to reproduce the
  green ray projectors of their ancestors. For hundreds of years thereafter the
  heirs of P'an-ku ruled only as viceroys for the emperors of the white race.
  This lasted until half a century ago, when our people were freed by a
  magnanimous and peace loving ruler of the white people named Mazo Khan. The
  languages of the two races were, meanwhile, fused into one, which is now the
  universal speech of Ma Gong.</p>

  <p>"Our scientists had been quietly at work for centuries, endeavoring to
  regain the secret of the green ray, as well as to reconstruct interplanetary
  vehicles as efficient as those of their ancestors. When they were set free by
  the magnanimous Mazo Khan work went on with redoubled vigor and, as you see,
  we now have both.</p>

  <p>"The present ruler of the white race, who still calls herself 'Maza of Ma
  Gong,' the hereditary title of the supreme ruler of Ma Gong, is the
  granddaughter of the man who set us free, and even though she may desire to
  once more enslave us, she cannot do so because we now have the green ray and
  the interplanetary vehicles.</p>

  <p>"We, on our part, could enslave her and her people only the scientists.
  They were forced to begin with simpler things and gradually build a new
  civilization and a new school of scientists.</p>

  <p>"Even the libraries, which would have been of inestimable value to them,
  were on the airless surface of Ma Gong where they could not be reached, and
  most of these had been destroyed by the meteoric clusters projected from Lu
  Gong. The others succumbed to age and the incessant battering of planetesimal
  particles which followed the destruction of our atmosphere, before they could
  be reached.</p>

  <p>"The eldest son of P'an-ku, who became P'an-ku at the death of his father,
  had been commander in chief of our interplanetary war fleets, and had been
  taken prisoner by the ruler of Lu Gong. He had left a wife with child, and
  she fled with the few hundreds who were the progenitors of our present race
  into the great caverns of our world. There a male child was born to her, and
  as he was the eldest son of that P'an-ku who never came back to us, he was
  the hereditary ruler of my people, and his descendants have directed their
  destinies ever since.</p>

  <p>"Nearly a thousand years after the great war, our ancestors, who bad
  multiplied in numbers and increased in knowledge, were able to construct
  suits in which they could explore the surface of our world, breathing air
  which was concentrated in tanks they carried with them. While searching the
  ruins of the ancient capital of P'an-ku, they came upon a metal cylinder
  which contained a message left there by his eldest son a thousand years
  before. It stated that he had escaped from Lu Gong, as there were none left
  alive there to detain him, and had come to Ma Gong in his one man space
  flyer, only to find his world destitute of people and untenable because of
  its lack of atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"He stated that he was leaving for Du Gong&mdash;that world inhabited, in
  those days, by strange monsters and savage peoples, and that he would never
  have deserted Ma Gong had he found but a single one of his subjects alive,
  but that he could no longer stay in a dead world when there was a chance that
  he might find life and an empire in a live one. In closing, he implored the
  Great Lord Sun to pardon him for by a terrific loss of life on both sides, so
  we prefer to leave her unmolested as long as she does not bother us, and
  extend our conquests along lines of less resistance for the present. Of
  course we must conquer her people eventually, for there cannot be two rulers
  of Ma Gong, but the time is not yet ripe.</p>

  <p>"The arrested motion of the vehicle tells me that we are now at our
  destination, so I must leave the globe for a while. If you will give me your
  word that you will not attempt to escape I will permit you the freedom of my
  ship."</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" asked the professor.</p>

  <p>"We are in the capital city of the descendants of that P'an-ku who visited
  your world many thousands of years ago. I am to meet some of his descendants
  in conference."</p>

  <p>"I will give you my word not to try to escape," said the professor.</p>

  <p>"Very well. So long as you stay on the ship you will be unmolested."</p>

  <p>He pressed a button in the wall behind him, and Lin Ching instantly opened
  the door.</p>

  <p>"You will permit the wise Khan, Am-Er-I, the freedom of the ship, Lin
  Ching," he said, "but you will see that he is either recaptured or killed if
  he attempts to leave it."</p>

  <p>"Lin Ching hears, and Lin Ching obeys," replied that individual, bowing
  the professor out of the room.</p>

  <p>The professor strolled around the ship, examining its interior with
  considerable interest. Then he opened one of the diamond-shaped doors, and
  stepped out onto the bridge-instantly recognizing a section of Peiping with
  which he was familiar. He saw that the other two flying globes hovered near
  the one he was on and that several Lunites were descending each of the
  swaying ladders which hung down from the interplanetary vehicles.</p>

  <p>He was gazing idly down at the crowd which milled in the street below him,
  when he suddenly spied a familiar face looking curiously up at him. A smile
  of recognition crossed the face of the Chinaman in the crowd beneath, but the
  professor instantly made a gesture of caution and then indicated that he
  wanted his friend to wait below him.</p>

  <p>Hastily jerking pencil and notebook from his pocket, the professor quickly
  wrote a short note in Chinese characters. It was addressed to General Fu Yen,
  its contents as follows:</p>

  <p class="letter">"I am a prisoner on a lunar globe, and have given my word
  of honor that I will not try to escape while here. I have not, however, made
  any promise that I will not write notes to my friends.<br>
  <br>
  "My captors are now negotiating with your government for the purpose of
  finally signing the agreement which will make your people the subjects of a
  round-bodied monarch who calls himself P'an-ku, and rules a race which
  inhabits the moon.<br>
  <br>
  "Your people have fought and bled for freedom and a voice in their
  government. Are they going to renounce all this now? You, and you only, my
  friend, can save them. Act quickly if you would not be too late.<br>
  <br>
  "Sincerely, Geo. Ederson."</p>

  <p>Crumpling the note into a ball, the professor called softly to the man
  below, who instantly took off his large helmet and held it upside down. Into
  this wide, inverted bowl, the professor dropped the note.</p>

  <p>"For Fu Yen," he called, softly.</p>

  <p>The Chinaman nodded, pocketed the note, replaced his hat on his head, and
  moved away, a part of the crowd.</p>

  <p>Then, with unexpected suddenness, vise-like fingers closed on the neck of
  the professor, and he was shaken like a rat.</p>

  <p>"Worm," grated a voice in his ear. "Tell me what you tossed to that person
  in the crowd, or by the Great Lord Sun, you shall not live to say aught
  else."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">15.</a> &mdash; MOON TRAVEL</h2>

  <p class="first">Awakened with each of his arms pinned to the ground by an
  armored warrior and the sword of a third who knelt on his chest menacing his
  throat, Ted blinked dazedly and wondered if he was indeed awake, or only
  dreaming.</p>

  <p>Then he heard the voice of Maza utter a sharp command.</p>

  <p>The three warriors instantly released him and stood at attention as he
  rose unsteadily to his feet. Evidently these were her own soldiers who had
  mistaken him for an enemy. Their white skins and non-Mongoloid features
  showed that they were not of the race of P'an-ku.</p>

  <p>At a second command from the girl the men filed down to the water's edge,
  where a long, low craft constructed of white metal, was moored. It was
  fashioned in the shape of a flying dragon like the one he had seen the girl
  riding some time before, the metallic wings held upward with edges closing at
  the top to make a fantastic roof for the cabin. As it was without rudder,
  oars or paddles, Ted was puzzled as to its means of locomotion.</p>

  <p>Beckoning him to follow, the girl leaped lightly aboard. As the earth man
  stepped in after her, one of the warriors pushed off and another, seated in
  the prow before a small keyboard, pressed several buttons with his fingers.
  There was a roar from the rear of the craft and it shot backward into
  midstream. The helmsman pressed another row of buttons and the boat started
  down stream with a louder roar and a terrific burst of speed.</p>

  <p>Making his way astern, Ted saw that the boat was both propelled and
  steered by two sets of three jointed pipes each, which extended from the back
  of the boat under water. Something, either highly compressed air or some
  other gas, rushed out of each pipe as the correct button was touched by the
  operator, and the wake, as a result, was a mass of seething bubbles. To turn
  right or left the helmsman had only to shut off the set of pipes on the side
  toward which he wished to go. To reverse the boat, he but needed to press
  buttons which bent the flexible jointed ends of the pipes downward and toward
  the front, thus reversing the direction of the pressure.</p>

  <p>Going forward once more, Ted crouched by the side of the girl and watched
  the queer lunar scenery hurtle past them. The boat, he judged, must be making
  at least a hundred miles an hour, so his glimpses of the queer, subterranean
  flora and fauna were but cursory. The phosphorescent vegetation with its
  eerie luminosity persisted as league after league of the winding stream was
  left behind them. Gigantic flying reptiles sometimes darted downward at the
  boat, but invariably underestimated its great speed, striking the water from
  one to two hundred feet behind it, then rising to flap lazily and disgustedly
  away in search of other less elusive quarry.</p>

  <p>After they had traveled in this manner for nearly six hours the helmsman
  suddenly reversed his power, bringing the craft to a stop before two huge,
  heavily barred gates which extended from the bottom of the stream to the
  surface of a great arch of masonry that marked the beginning of a tunnel.</p>

  <p>A warrior in the stern then struck a gong three times, and the gates
  slowly swung back, whereupon the boat entered the tunnel, which was lighted
  from above by a soft, phosphorescent radiance that emanated from
  hemispherical dome lights placed at regular intervals. Armored guards with
  long spears in their hands, and swords and ray projectors strapped to their
  belts, stood on each side of the gateway before small block houses. Ted
  noticed that they reversed their spears and bent the knee as the boat
  passed&mdash;evidently the military obeisance to their ruler.</p>

  <p>Three more gates, similarly guarded, were opened for them at distances of
  about a quarter of a mile apart along the tunnel. Then Ted saw, a short
  distance ahead, a fifth gate through which a flood of bright light poured.
  This gate, too, opened in response to three strokes of the gong, and the boat
  emerged into an open stream once more.</p>

  <p>A few buildings of white stone dotted the banks of the stream, which
  appeared to be under cultivation. Each of the buildings was surmounted by an
  enormous metal contrivance supported by a shaft that projected upward from
  the center of the roof, and was shaped like an umbrella turned inside out.
  That these were for the purpose of capturing and in some way utilizing the
  sun's energy, Ted did not doubt.</p>

  <p>Noticing that all were tilted at precisely the same angle, he glanced
  upward to note the position of the sun, only to meet with a new surprise, for
  the entire valley into which they had come, nearly ten miles in width at this
  point, was roofed over with a vault of glass, fitted in large frames and
  braced with elaborately constructed metal arches. The nearer walls of the
  valley rose, sheer and rugged, for about two miles. The farther walls were
  shrouded in blue mist that made them barely discernible.</p>

  <p>Presently the boat stopped at a dock which projected out over the water
  from the side of a large building surmounted by a tall, round tower. Four
  taut cables, stretching from a row of similar towers about a mile to the
  left, passed through a great arched opening near the top of the tower,
  continuing through a row of towers, the first of which was about a mile to
  the right.</p>

  <p>Two attendants saluted with bent knees and bowed heads, then held the boat
  while Maza and Ted stepped out.</p>

  <p>They entered a building and passed through a large, arched room where a
  number of men, women and children bent the knee as Maza passed. A few of the
  men wore armor and carried weapons, but the greater number appeared to be
  civilians. Among these, the men wore brightly colored sleeveless cloth
  jackets that reached to their thighs and were belted about the waist, and
  which included nearly all the colors of the rainbow. They were bare armed and
  bare legged, and many were bare footed, although a few wore coarse sandals of
  plaited grass held by strands of grass rope.</p>

  <p>The women were uniformly attired in white, clinging garments of
  translucent material that half revealed, half concealed their forms, and Ted
  was struck by this contrast to earthly customs where women dress brightly and
  men usually wear somber colors.</p>

  <p>The very small children romped about quite naked. Those a little older
  wore breech clouts, and the larger imitated their elders according to their
  sexes.</p>

  <p>Having crossed this room, Maza and Ted entered a lift which quickly
  whisked them to the place near the top of the tower which he had previously
  noticed, and through which the four cables were stretched. Suspended on
  overhead wheels from one of these cables was a bullet-shaped car of white
  metal with transparent panels in the sides and a sliding door near the
  center, which had apparently been held awaiting their coming.</p>

  <p>An attendant closed the door after them as they stepped in and sank into
  luxuriously cushioned seats. Then the vehicle started smoothly, accelerating
  rapidly until Ted computed that they were going at least four hundred miles
  an hour.</p>

  <p>As hour after hour slipped by and their speed continued unabated, Ted
  wondered at the great length of the valley. He consulted his wrist compass
  and noticed that they were traveling toward the southeast. The valley
  appeared quite uniform in width, and although there were a few wooded areas
  was, for the most part, apparently under cultivation. Most of the farms were
  irrigated by small ditches which branched out from a broad canal that
  extended down the center of the valley, and was fed from time to time, by
  streams which flowed through tunnels in the rocky walls on either side. Men
  and women were at work in the fields, some using farm machinery of unknown
  motive power, some assisted by dragon-like draft animals, and others using
  only hand tools.</p>

  <p>Noticing that Ted was apparently trying to compute the distance and
  direction they had traveled, his companion took a rolled parchment from a
  pocket in the wall. It proved to be a map of the moon. She spread it out
  before them and pointed to the longest known lunar ray&mdash;the one which
  extends from the crater, Tycho, near the bottom of the southeast quadrant of
  the moon, curves across the southwest and northwest quadrants, and ends near
  the north pole in the Mare Frigoris.</p>

  <p>With the pink tip of her dainty forefinger she indicated their start at
  the crater Hipparchus, their underground trip to the glassed over crack or
  valley in the moon's surface which terrestrial astronomers had always
  referred to as "one of the rays of Tycho," and the distance they had traveled
  since they entered the cable railway. She then pointed to Tycho and said:
  "Ultu."</p>

  <p>Ted understood from this that Tycho or "Ultu" was their destination, and
  was probably a subterranean lunar city. As Ultu was the center of the most
  extensive ray system on the moon, Ted assumed that it was probably the
  capital of one of the most populous nations.</p>

  <p>When they had finished with the map, Ted took a note book and pencil from
  his pocket and wrote some of the Lunite words he had learned from the
  translation of Professor Ederson. The girl helped him to construct and
  pronounce sentences, indicating meanings by signs and by drawing pictures.
  Then Ted, in turn, helped his fair companion with her English. Thus the time
  was passed pleasantly until their arrival in Ultu.</p>

  <p>When they reached the great central station, from which cable railways
  radiated in all directions, and Maza stepped out of the car, her easy
  camaraderie disappeared, and Ted saw her on her dignity as a royal
  princess.</p>

  <p>Evidently the news of her escape from capture at the hands of P'an-ku had
  become the common property of all of her subjects, as the huge terminal was
  crowded with people and the city streets around it were so choked with human
  beings that all traffic had been suspended. Two files of soldiers held open a
  lane for her as she walked down from the landing platform to where a number
  of gorgeously decked individuals who sparkled with jewels, some in shining
  armor and others in civilian attire, waited to greet her with bent knees and
  what Ted took to be fervent exclamations of joy at her deliverance. These
  were evidently the great civil and military dignitaries of her realm.</p>

  <p>Behind the lines of soldiers, the common people were equally
  demonstrative. Many of the men as well as the women, wept for joy. It was
  plain to be seen that the young ruler was as popular as she was
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>Until they had reached the great arched opening which led to the street,
  Ted had walked behind Maza in company with two of her most magnificently
  attired nobles. When they reached this point, however, she took his arm and
  holding one hand aloft, addressed the people. To the surprise of Ted, they
  all burst into loud cheering when she had finished, and the great nobles
  crowded around him, jostling each other for the honor of kissing his hand. It
  was evident that he had been given quite favorable mention for his part in
  her rescue from the soldiers of P'an-ku and the flying reptile.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the steps a carriage magnificently decked in silver and
  crimson and drawn by two wingless dragons awaited the Princess. She kept
  Ted's arm, and together they descended the stairs. He assisted her&mdash;into
  the carriage, but hesitated to enter until she took his hand and drew him in
  after her.</p>

  <p>A path was instantly cleared for them by the soldiers, and the two great
  reptiles that had appeared so huge and awkward started away at a fast
  clip.</p>

  <p>A few minutes ride took them to the imperial palace&mdash;an imposing
  building of shining black stone set in white metal in lieu of mortar.</p>

  <p>Here Ted's companion turned him over to a pompous appearing chamberlain
  who conducted him to a sumptuous private suite. A young, but well trained
  valet assisted him to remove his armor and drew a bath for him. After a
  refreshing bath and a shave, he was given a suit of shimmering golden yellow
  fabric trimmed with black binding, of a style worn by the nobles of the
  court. Then his attendant strapped comfortable, soft soled sandals on his
  feet, and buckled his belt containing his degravitors and pocket pouch, about
  his waist.</p>

  <p>Presently the pompous chamberlain appeared at the door and beckoned to
  him. He followed the officer, who led him through a maze of hallways into a
  large, arched throne room, where Maza, attired in the gleaming white metal in
  which he had first seen her with his radiovisiphone&mdash;her golden hair
  held by a band of platinum-like metal powdered with glistening jewels&mdash;
  presided on a throne of scarlet and silver that was raised on a dais at one
  end of the room.</p>

  <p>Standing at respectful attention on either side of the throne were her
  guards, men and women attendants, and notables both civil and military.</p>

  <p>As he advanced beside the chamberlain, Ted noticed a familiar figure
  standing at the left near the foot of the throne&mdash;a venerable graybeard
  who wore a richly embroidered robe of dark blue. He instantly recognized him
  as the old man who had been with the princess when he had tried, for the
  second time, to communicate with the moon by radiovisiphone.</p>

  <p>The court officer, having conducted him before the throne, bowed low and
  withdrew.</p>

  <p>Although gracious and smiling, Maza was dignified, as befitted a royal
  princess at a formal audience. With such English words as she could muster,
  she introduced Ted to all the notables in turn, each of whom bowed low as his
  name was pronounced. The last one to be presented was the venerable
  graybeard.</p>

  <p>"Ted Dustin, greatest scientist of Du Gong," she said "give di tcha-tsi to
  Vanible Khan, greatest scientist of Ma Gong."</p>

  <p>"Di tcha-tsi," said Ted, uttering this unintelligible word of greeting
  because it seemed the thing to do.</p>

  <p>"Di tcha-tsi na mu," replied the great Lunite, bowing profoundly.</p>

  <p>"Vanible Khan, you will instruct Ted Dustin in our language, then report
  to me," commanded Maza.</p>

  <p>Making profound obeisance, the old man motioned Ted to follow him, and
  they departed. In the suite which had been assigned to him, Ted began his
  lessons that day. His slight knowledge of the Lunite language and Vanible
  Khan's slight knowledge of English helped them greatly at the start. He
  learned that "di tcha-tsi" meant "no challenge" or "peace" and "na mu" was
  translated "to you."</p>

  <p>For two days the two scientists pursued their linguistic studies, stopping
  only to eat and sleep. Each found the other such an apt pupil that they
  progressed with amazing rapidity. Toward the end of the second day, Vanible
  Khan said:</p>

  <p>"Come with me. I have something to show you."</p>

  <p>Together they went to the palace courtyard, where two flying dragons were
  saddled and ready for them.</p>

  <p>"To direct your mount," said Vanible Khan, "simply use our words for the
  right or left, up or down, or straight. The beast will proceed
  accordingly."</p>

  <p>Both men mounted.</p>

  <p>"Up," commanded Vanible Khan. "Up," shouted Ted, and both beasts after
  running forward for a short distance with outspread wings, took to the
  air.</p>

  <p>They presently alighted before a large building near the outskirts of the
  city, and leaving their mounts in charge of an attendant, entered a great,
  arched doorway.</p>

  <p>Ted found himself in one of the largest factories he had ever seen.
  Hundreds of bullet shaped cars of a kind he had ridden in with Maza on his
  trip to Ultu were here being manufactured or repaired by thousands of busy
  workers.</p>

  <p>He cried out in pleased surprise when he suddenly spied his own
  interplanetary vehicle. Evidently it had been brought in by the order of
  Maza, and had just arrived, for workmen were removing chains by which it had
  been carried.</p>

  <p>"We have many skilled mechanics here," said Vanible Khan. "If your flier
  can be repaired, you have but to command us."</p>

  <p>"Summon a headman," said Ted, "and I will show him what to do."</p>

  <p>While the chief mechanic was being brought, Ted quickly took pad and
  pencil from his belt pouch and drew diagrams of the missing parts. Under his
  and Ted's joint direction, with linguistic assistance when necessary, from
  Vanible Khan, the wreckage of the prow was cut away and orders were put
  through for the missing parts.</p>

  <p>"In two days your flier will be ready," said the chief mechanic, when he
  departed.</p>

  <p>Two days later, when Ted, in company with Vanible Khan, called at the
  factory, he entered the cab, and closing it, flew about under the great
  arched roof of the factory. The motor and controls worked perfectly.
  Delighted, he returned to the assembling floor, invited his fellow scientist
  into the cab, and darting out of the large doorway, flew with him to the roof
  of the palace in a few seconds.</p>

  <p>They had scarcely alighted from the craft when a messenger hurried
  breathlessly up to them, and bowed low.</p>

  <p>"Her Imperial Majesty summons your lordships to the observation room, at
  once," he said. "The people of Du Gong are in deadly peril."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">16.</a> &mdash; TED ATTACKS</h2>

  <p class="first">Ted and his companion, Vanible Khan, hurried down a maze of
  stairways and hallways until they arrived in a large, square room, the walls
  of which were divided into panels. On each panel was a moving picture which
  seemed to shine through from the rear. An operator sat at a switchboard in
  the center of the room, pressing various buttons on the instrument before him
  from time to time.</p>

  <p>Maza was there with two of her gigantic guards, and several of her oldest
  counselors. She pointed to one of the panels as they entered.</p>

  <p>"P'an-ku is attacking your people with a terrible weapon, Ted Dustin," she
  said. "Look."</p>

  <p>He looked at the panel she indicated, and saw as through a powerful
  telescope, a side view of the great lunar crater which he had learned to
  recognize as Copernicus. Shooting upward from the center of the crater was a
  bright band of green light.</p>

  <p>"Now look at this picture," continued Maza, pointing to another panel.</p>

  <p>He looked, and saw a telescopic view of the earth. Despite the many storm
  areas which hid outlines of land and water, he made out the shape of North
  America, and saw that Washington and the territory surrounding it were in an
  immense spot of green light.</p>

  <p>"What can those rays do at that distance?" he asked Vanible Khan.</p>

  <p>"That," replied the lunar scientist, thoughtfully stroking his long white
  beard, "depends wholly on the power of the ray projector which P'an-ku is
  employing. If powerful enough, the green rays will contract and destroy all
  matter which they come in contact. When nearly spent, they still have the
  power to remove much of the heat from everything they touch. I should say,
  off hand, that the area they reach at present is intensely cold&mdash;perhaps
  even uninhabitable for human beings."</p>

  <p>Ted turned suddenly to Maza.</p>

  <p>"May I have a glass helmet and a suit of insulated armor?" he asked. "My
  own suit is useless until I can fit a new helmet to it."</p>

  <p>"You may, of course. Put where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"To destroy that green ray projector."</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand of my nak-kar cavalry will fly with you," she said.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind to offer help," he replied, "but I prefer to go alone.
  This is my war and my people are being killed."</p>

  <p>"You refuse?" He could see that she was nettled.</p>

  <p>"I decline with sincere thanks, if you please. Time is precious, and in my
  vehicle I can reach the projector before your flying beasts are well on the
  way, thereby saving many lives which otherwise might be sacrificed by
  delay."</p>

  <p>"Very well. It is your war now, because I have not yet officially declared
  war on P'an-ku. I will do so immediately. Then, if we cannot be allies, I
  will fight him in my way and you in yours."</p>

  <p>She turned to one of the armored nobles who stood nearby.</p>

  <p>"See that Ted Dustin is outfitted for surface flying at once," she
  commanded.</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes later. Ted stood on the roof of the place attired in the
  bell-like glass helmet and white, wooly, insulated armor of Maza's people. He
  fidgeted impatiently while a great nak-kar was being saddled in order that
  its rider might guide him up through one of the huge and tortuous air shafts
  which led from the subterranean city of Ultu to the ringed plain of Tycho
  above.</p>

  <p>At his side stood Vanible Khan, stroking his long white beard and coolly
  supervising the preparations. When the flying dragon was saddled and its
  rider seated, the old scientist placed his hand on Ted's shoulder, and
  said:</p>

  <p>"You are taking desperate chances, boy. It is doubtful if you will ever
  get near enough to the projector to destroy it, but if you do you will almost
  certainly be killed. I bid you farewell, and my prayers and those of our
  people go with you."</p>

  <p>"I realize the chances and thank you for your good wishes. Goodbye,"
  replied Ted, closing his visor, and turning to climb into his craft.</p>

  <p>Just as he placed his foot on the lower step a hand was laid on his arm.
  He turned and saw Maza, flushed and panting from the exertion of hurriedly
  climbing to the roof. As he turned and looked down into her eyes he saw they
  were flashing with anger.</p>

  <p>She reached up and raised his visor with dainty, pink-tipped fingers.</p>

  <p>"How dare you leave me, Ted Dustin, without saying farewell," she said.
  "Why you might n-never come back."</p>

  <p>A tear rolled down her velvety cheek, and she shook her fluffy head to
  dislodge it.</p>

  <p>He started to bend over&mdash;to kiss her hand. Her eyes softened
  &mdash;drew him to the beautiful upturned face. Before he knew what had
  happened, he was kissing her, and she was returning his kiss with closed
  eyes, her arms around his neck, her small, lithe body close to his.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he released her, leaped into the cab, and signaled the nak-kar
  rider that he was ready. He elevated his craft slowly while the great dragon
  clumsily lumbered forward with wings outspread&mdash;took to the air, and
  circled upward toward a dark opening above.</p>

  <p>Although the flying reptile moved swiftly through the maze of passageways
  and caverns, evidently of volcanic origin, which led upward, it seemed to Ted
  that their progress was exceedingly slow. The nak-kar rider kept his bright
  head lamp lighted until they reached the surface, where it was no longer
  necessary. Then, with a wave of his hand, he indicated a vertical band of
  green light which emerged from the northeastern horizon, and made a circle of
  green light on the face of the earth.</p>

  <p>With an answering wave of farewell, Ted seized the controls and gave the
  Lunite such an exhibition of speed as must have commanded his awe and
  wonder.</p>

  <p>Flying high above the moon's surface in the tenuous lunar atmosphere, he
  traveled at a speed far surpassing that of the bullet cars which the Lunites
  used in traversing the glazed ray-valleys. As he progressed toward Copernicus
  he noticed that the valleys which radiated from Tycho grew fewer and further
  apart, and that there were other glazed valleys coming down from the north.
  While the former had appeared a glistening white in the sunlight, these
  latter were yellowish in appearance, evidently due to the fact that they were
  roofed with amber instead of clear glass. The great green ray, the projector
  of which it was his purpose to destroy, gave him the exact location of
  Copernicus and showed him that these yellow ray-valleys ramified from that
  place.</p>

  <p>He was less than a hundred miles from his objective when the spherical
  bulk of a lunar flying globe suddenly loomed ahead. A deadly green ray
  instantly shot toward him, but Ted was now ready to profit by his first
  experience with the war globes of P'an-ku.</p>

  <p>Instead of continuing on his course, he suddenly dropped for a thousand
  feet, and while manipulating his atomotor with his left hand brought a
  degravitor gun into play with his right. His aim was true, and the forward
  revolving disc of the flying Globe flashed and disappeared when struck by the
  invisible rays. The globe instantly made a half turn and commenced a swift
  nose dive groundward. Before the aft disc could be reversed, Ted aimed his
  degravitor at this, also, destroying it instantly. A half dozen green rays
  shot out from various parts of the globe, flashing like the spokes of a giant
  wheel as the craft hurtled to the ground&mdash;then disappeared as a lurid
  explosion announced the destruction of the ship.</p>

  <p>Fearing that, having been seen by the aerial patrol, his presence had been
  announced by radio, Ted decided to attack at once. He therefore aimed his
  craft as if it had been a projectile, in a curved trajectory which would
  carry him at a height of about ten miles over the huge rim of Copernicus, and
  downward toward the central source of light. With both forward degravitors
  turned on and the atomotor running at the maximum speed possible in the
  presence of the tenuous atmospheric gases, the craft instantly became a
  terrific missile of destruction.</p>

  <p>So swiftly did it fly that the view of the rugged, crater-pitted landscape
  beneath became blurred, despite the great size and sharp detail of the major
  formations.</p>

  <p>Ted spotted his objective before he was above the great outer ring of
  Copernicus. It was the tallest of the five great central mountain peaks which
  project upward from the floor of the crater. The great green ray which was
  trained on the earth was coming directly from the tip of this peak, and the
  entire crater of the mighty ring mountain was bathed in a weird green light,
  evidently reflections of the ray from the glistening walls and peaks.</p>

  <p>In a moment Ted was directly over the southwest rim of the huge crater.
  Instantly, he pointed his craft downward, and the invisible rays of the two
  forward degravitors struck the peak of the tallest inner mountain&mdash;still
  more than thirty miles away. Even at that distance the telltale flash from
  the mountain top told him that his aim was true. Then, with degravitors set
  rigidly in position, he dived straight for his target.</p>

  <p>From one of the pits beneath, a green ray of ordinary dimensions suddenly
  burst forth. Others flashed out, searching the sky for the marauder who had
  dared this attack on the mighty ray projector of P'an-ku. But Ted was flying
  so swiftly and his craft was so high in the air and so small that it was not
  easy for the Lunites to locate him. At the moment they only knew of his
  presence because the tip of the mountain peak which surrounded their green
  ray projector was rapidly melting away under the attack of his invisible
  rays.</p>

  <p>As he progressed toward the central peak, Ted noticed that the searching
  green rays grew thicker and thicker. Suddenly one sheared away the stern of
  his craft, and with it the rear atomotor outlets. The crippled vehicle was
  carried forward for a few seconds by its own momentum, but gradually
  succumbing to the insistent pull of gravity it deviated from its
  course&mdash;wobbled unsteadily, and began to fall groundward.</p>

  <p>Releasing his now useless atomotor controls, Ted concentrated his
  attention on the two forward degravitors. As his ship fell, wobbling this way
  and that, he kept his two ray guns steadily pointed at the mountain top from
  which the great green ray emerged. His craft was falling with terrific speed
  when he had the satisfaction of seeing the green ray wink out, and the
  section of the mountain top containing what was left of the projecting
  machinery, topple over, hurtle down the mountainside in an avalanche of
  debris, and crash to the ground in an enormous cloud of dust and smoke.</p>

  <p>But he had not noticed his own proximity to the crater floor. There came a
  sudden shock that smashed the keel of his craft like an egg shell-then
  oblivion.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch174"
     name="ch174">17.</a> &mdash; ALLIANCE</h2>

  <p class="first">Standing before the big radiovisiphone of the President of
  the United States, in Washington, Roger Sanders waited impatiently for the
  silencing of all terrestrial stations that he might be tuned in with Ted
  Dustin's powerful superstation which was to relay a message from the
  moon.</p>

  <p>Presently the signal: "All clear," came through, and Roger, looking into
  the disc of the President's instrument, saw, as if reflected in a mirror, the
  huge disc of Ted's radiovisiphone with the operator seated before it
  manipulating the dials.</p>

  <p>Indistinct figures appeared a number of times in the pellucid depths of
  the great disc, and there were a few unintelligible sounds. Then it suddenly
  cleared, and Roger and President Whitmore were dazzled, as before, by the
  appearance of the beautiful Maza with two armored guards and the aged
  scientist, Vanible Khan.</p>

  <p>To the surprise of both, Vanible Khan addressed them in English.</p>

  <p>"Despite the powerful interference waves broadcasted by P'an-ku, we have
  at last succeeded in breaking through," he said. "Do I address friends of Ted
  Dustin?"</p>

  <p>"You are speaking to his superior, President Whitmore of the United States
  of America, and also to his assistant, Roger Sanders," replied Roger.</p>

  <p>"That is indeed fortunate," said the old scientist, smiling. "I am Vanible
  Khan, chief scientist of Ma Gong, and speak for Her Imperial Majesty, Maza an
  Ma Gong. She bids me inform you that Ted Dustin left Ultu, her capital, which
  is situated beneath the crater which you on Du Gong call 'Tycho,' two
  revolutions off your planet ago. He went with the avowed intention of
  destroying the projector of the great green ray which was turned on your
  world. It appears that he has succeeded in destroying the ray, but as he has
  not returned we assume that he has either been killed or captured.</p>

  <p>"The ray, as you are no doubt aware, was projected from a central peak of
  the ring mountain which you call Copernicus. Beneath this mountain is the
  capital city of P'an-ku, which is called Peilong.</p>

  <p>"Since the departure of Ted Dustin, Her Majesty has declared war on P'an-
  ku. Tonight she will personally conduct a mighty army which will march on
  Peilong through the subterranean forests. She has not thought it wise to use
  her nak-kars&mdash;the flying beasts which can live for nine of your days
  without air-because of their slowness and inefficiency compared to P'an-ku's
  flying globes.</p>

  <p>"She intends to attack Peilong in five of your days. If you, the friends
  of Ted Dustin, have a way to simultaneously strike from above, it is possible
  that we may save him or avenge his death, and subdue P'an-ku, thus bringing
  about peace between the peoples of Du Gong and the yellow race of Ma
  Gong.</p>

  <p>"Her Majesty awaits your answer."</p>

  <p>"I have a way," replied Roger, half turning toward the President as he
  spoke. "The powerful interplanetary battleship we are building will be ready
  in four days. With your permission I will then leave for the moon, and will
  attack Peilong in conjunction with the army of Her Majesty."</p>

  <p>"But what of the flying globes of P'an-ku?" asked the President. "He may
  have hundreds of them, in which case your task will be hopeless, and we'll
  have nobody left to run the Dustin factory."</p>

  <p>"The factory can run under the directions of our superintendents whether
  Ted and I are present or not," replied Roger, "and there will be no let-down
  in production if we never return, as long as money and materials are
  supplied. As for flying globes, if P'an-ku has thousands of them, I will
  still be glad to go, counting it a small sacrifice to risk my life in this
  mighty battleship when Ted has braved the same dangers in his tiny, one-man
  flier."</p>

  <p>"Go then, with my best wishes for a glorious victory and a safe return,"
  replied the President. "If it were not for the demands of the nation which
  especially require my presence in this crisis, I should like to go with
  you."</p>

  <p>"You may tell Her Majesty," said Roger, addressing Vanible Khan, "that I
  will attack P'an-ku from above in five days."</p>

  <p>Maza evidently understood his reply, for she smiled and spoke for the
  first time during the interview.</p>

  <p>"In five days, then, Roger Sanders, I will meet you in the imperial palace
  at Peilong, and may we be in time to save Ted Dustin."</p>

  <p>The disc suddenly became blank, and Roger, after bidding farewell to
  President Whitmore, hurried away to his electroplane, which Bevans had ready
  for the trip to Chicago.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">18.</a> &mdash; TORTURE CHAMBERS</h2>

  <p class="first">Professor Ederson was small but wiry, and it took him but a
  moment to squirm from the grasp of the Lunite who had seized him from behind
  after he dropped a note addressed to General Fu Yen from the bridge of the
  flying globe. Turning, he beheld Lin Ching, his features contorted with rage.
  He whipped out a sword, and in his great anger would surely have beheaded the
  professor then and there, bad not Kwan Tsu Khan appeared on the scene and
  seized his sword arm from behind.</p>

  <p>"What's this, Lin Ching?" he asked. "Has the prisoner attempted to escape,
  that you threaten his life?"</p>

  <p>"Worse than that, my lord Kwan Tsu Khan," replied Lin Ching. "The
  miserable worm just dropped something to someone in the crowd and refuses to
  tell me what it was."</p>

  <p>"I refused nothing," cut in the professor. "This man came up behind me
  and, seizing me by the neck, shook me. As I dislike being shaken, I twisted
  from his grasp."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps then, you will tell me what it was that you dropped to the person
  in the crowd." said Kwan Tsu Khan.</p>

  <p>"To be sure," replied the professor. "I dropped a note, written to a
  friend of mine who lives here."</p>

  <p>"And what did the note say?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied the professor, "is strictly my business."</p>

  <p>"I will make it my business to find out when I have more time," said Kwan
  Tsu Khan with his suave smile. "In the meantime, Lin Ching, put the prisoner
  where he can send no more notes. I go, now, to confer with our allies."</p>

  <p>Lin Ching bowed and grinned. Then he pointed with his sword to the
  diamond-shaped door behind him.</p>

  <p>"Enter, Am-Er-I-Khan," he commanded, "and follow the passageway until I
  bid you halt."</p>

  <p>The professor did as he was told, and was eventually stopped before a door
  near the opposite side of the globe.</p>

  <p>Taking a bunch of keys from his belt pouch, Lin Ching unlocked the door,
  then bade his prisoner enter.</p>

  <p>The savant found himself in a small, windowless room, faintly illuminated
  by a tiny dome light overhead. In the center of the room was a chair,
  suspended on powerful coil springs. Other springs connected it to the floor,
  and still others to the walls on four sides.</p>

  <p>"Be seated," ordered Lin Ching.</p>

  <p>No sooner had the professor seated himself in the chair than his captor
  proceeded to strap him down securely. His hands were so fastened to the arms
  of the chair that he was unable to reach the fastenings of the straps which
  held his body, legs and feet.</p>

  <p>Having completed his work, Lin Ching stood back with arms akimbo and
  grinned.</p>

  <p>"His lordship will make you glad to talk when he returns," he said. "In
  the meantime I wish you pleasant and profound meditations."</p>

  <p>With that, he stepped out and closed and locked the door. A moment later
  the dome light snapped off, and the savant was left, alone and helpless, in
  total darkness.</p>

  <p>How long he hung there in his suspended chair in complete silence the
  professor had no means of knowing. Suddenly, however, sounds came to him
  which indicated that projectiles of some sort were striking the outer shell
  of the craft. Despite his predicament, he smiled to himself in the darkness,
  for this was, he felt sure, the reply of his friend, General Fu Yen to his
  hastily written note.</p>

  <p>He felt the craft dart suddenly upward a short time thereafter, and was
  thankful for the coiled springs which surrounded his chair. Had they not been
  there to absorb the shock, he would have been badly injured if not killed
  outright by so sudden a movement of the globe.</p>

  <p>For some time he could sense the quick movements of the craft hither and
  thither, while projectiles rattled intermittently against its armor. Then it
  settled down to a swift sustained flight and the bombardment ceased.</p>

  <p>The even flight was maintained for several hours. Then projectiles rattled
  once more against the shell of the craft. This second bombardment lasted for
  perhaps five minutes. Then the globe shot suddenly upward with such terrific
  speed that, protected though he was by the coiled springs, the professor lost
  consciousness.</p>

  <p>When he regained his senses once more, the savant was being unstrapped
  from his chair by Lin Ching. Another Lunite was holding a bottle of some
  pungent smelling liquid beneath his nostrils. The sharp fumes smarted them,
  and he jerked his head back to escape the pain, whereupon Lin Ching
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"So you flinch at the smell of sarvadine, ah, Am-Er-I-Khan? It will be a
  pleasure to watch you when the real torture begins."</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" asked the professor, noticing that the motion of the globe
  had ceased.</p>

  <p>"In Peilong, the capitol city of His Imperial Majesty, P'an-ku," replied
  Lin Ching.</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" exclaimed the professor, whereupon Lin Ching, dumfounded,
  prodded him with his sword and ordered him to get out into the passageway and
  keep moving.</p>

  <p>At his first step he bumped his head on the ceiling, then fell to the
  floor in a heap. Convinced that he was indeed on the moon, by this
  demonstration of the lessened gravity pull, he carefully got up, and made his
  way forward with a peculiar, toddling gait that seemed to amuse his
  captors.</p>

  <p>As he emerged from the diamond-shaped doorway in the shell of the craft,
  he saw that the great globe had settled into a circular depression in the
  level floor of a great dock made to contain its lower half. All around him
  similar depressions were occupied by craft of exactly the same size and type.
  It seemed that P'an-ku had a quite formidable armada.</p>

  <p>Standing on the dock with several other round bodied Lunites was Kwan Tsu
  Khan, his face bandaged and one arm in a sling. With him there also stood
  another, slender of figure, whom the professor instantly recognized.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Wu!" he exclaimed in surprise. "How did you get here?"</p>

  <p>"I had the honor of being your fellow passenger, professor," replied the
  Chinaman, bowing slightly.</p>

  <p>"Come! Over the railing, worm!" grated Lin Ching, with another prod of his
  sword.</p>

  <p>The professor quickly vaulted the railing, alighting on the dock.</p>

  <p>"You will feed the Am-Er-I-Khan, Lin Ching," commanded Kwan Tsu Khan,
  after the latter had followed his prisoner over the railing. "I will send for
  him later." Then he turned and walked away, chatting amiably with Dr. Wu,
  while the other Lunites followed at a respectful distance behind.</p>

  <p>The savant was conducted off the docks, which were lighted by globes
  suspended from the arched ends of gracefully constructed lamp posts. He could
  not determine the nature of the light, which was yellow in color, and seemed
  to come from a liquid with which the globes were filled. Far above him, he
  caught glimpses of the rugged top of the great arched cavern in which the
  lunar city was situated, particularly at points where white stalactites
  reflected the light from the globes below.</p>

  <p>After leaving the docks, he threaded many narrow and crooked streets. The
  houses, which were set closely together, were mostly octagonal or cylindrical
  in shape, and the popular fashion in doors and windows seemed to be the
  diamond shape-one hinge only at the left corner of the diamond, and one catch
  at the right. The roofs were sharply pointed, and were either of yellow metal
  or heavy stone. He wondered why roofs should be needed at all in an
  underground city, and especially roofs of such heavy construction, until he
  saw a fragment of a stalactite fall on one of the metal roofs and glance off,
  alighting in the street not far from a group of round bodied Lunites.</p>

  <p>The lighting system in the city was the same as at the docks&mdash;
  endless rows of suspended globes containing a substance which radiated yellow
  light.</p>

  <p>Presently the professor and his captor emerged from the narrow streets and
  entered a broad open park, or plaza, planted with luminous trees and shrubs
  of variegated forms and hues. Standing in the center of this park was a huge
  building, octagonal in shape, and crowned with a narrower, pagoda-like
  structure, the point of which reached nearly to the pendant stalactites on
  the arched vault above. The lower part of the building was of red stone, but
  the upper part was of burnished yellow metal surrounded by rings of yellow
  globes and reflecting their light with such brilliance as to light up a
  considerable portion of the city as well as the upper reaches of the
  cavern.</p>

  <p>The professor was hustled into a door at the ground level of this
  building, and down a spiral ramp into a dimly lighted room where a number of
  men, some of the round bodied yellow race, and others of the white lunar
  race, were chained by collars around their necks to rings in the wall. He was
  promptly clapped into a vacant place, and a burly jailer whose touch was far
  from gentle, snapped and locked a metal collar around his neck.</p>

  <p>"You will feed this contemptible maggot," said Lin Ching to the jailer.
  "Then report to me."</p>

  <p>The burly fellow saluted, and Lin Ching withdrew. Presently the jailer
  went out and returned with a bowl and a cup which he set before the
  professor. The bowl contained some chunks of stewed fungus of a leathery
  texture though not unpleasant flavor, and the cup, water with a slightly
  alkaline taste.</p>

  <p>The savant was both hungry and thirsty, and disposed of his meager rations
  with gusto before Lin Ching came to him.</p>

  <p>"Now, O pestilent spawn of a grub," said Lin Ching, seizing the
  professor's neck chain which the jailer had unfastened from the wall, and
  giving it a vicious jerk, "we will learn the fate of one who defies the
  servants of the mighty P'an-ku."</p>

  <p>After being dragged up the spiral ramp and half choked from the pressure
  of his metal collar, Professor Ederson was hustled through a maze of hallways
  and passageways to a place where Kwan Tsu Khan stood before a great, diamond-
  shaped doorway, guarded by two armored warriors who carried spears with heads
  like long-toothed buzz saws, while from the belt of each there depended a
  sword on the left and a ray-projector on the right.</p>

  <p>The Khan waited until a brilliantly robed major-domo bade him enter
  &mdash;then took the prisoner's chain from the hands of Lin Ching and led him
  into a large, brilliantly lighted audience chamber, the walls of which were
  magnificently decorated with gaudily colored bas-reliefs of hunting and
  battle scenes in which the round-bodied moon men and strange animals and
  dragons figured conspicuously.</p>

  <p>Seated on a massive cushioned throne, placed on a raised platform at the
  far end of the room, his great round belly cradled between his spindly knees,
  was P'an-ku, ruler of the yellow skinned moon men. Standing to the right and
  left of the dais were guards, richly clad courtiers, and liveried
  attendants.</p>

  <p>The Khan slowly led his prisoner to a place before the throne. Then,
  dropping to his knees, he pressed his forehead and the palms of his hands to
  the floor.</p>

  <p>"Rise, Kwan Tsu Khan," said P'an-ku. "What have you here?"</p>

  <p>"I have brought you the first captive of war from Du Gong, O Lord of the
  Universe," replied Kwan Tsu Khan.</p>

  <p>"You are slightly in error, Kwan Tsu Khan," replied P'an-ku, twisting one
  end of his drooping moustache, and leering. "You have brought the second
  prisoner of war from Du Gong. The first is already chained in our deepest
  dungeon for such time as we care to keep him there, while devising a
  lingering death suitable to his case."</p>

  <p>"A prisoner from Du Gong? Your humble servant craves indulgence, for he
  fails to understand, O King of the Age."</p>

  <p>"It does not matter," replied P'an-ku. "We will attend to the prisoner
  before us. Your report can wait, although I observe that you have been
  wounded, and that two of the other observer globes have not returned. Let us
  dispose of this prisoner, first. Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"The miserable microbe, who calls himself Am-Er-I-Khan, fell on the bridge
  of our globe from a ship of Du Gong which we destroyed, and was taken captive
  by one of my men. When we had reached the capital of the land of the
  descendants of your illustrious ancestor, he dropped a message to someone in
  the crowd below the craft. Shortly thereafter, when we were in conference
  with the powers of that land, a revolt broke out in which eleven of our men
  were slain. Your humble slave barely escaped with his life, having been left
  for dead.</p>

  <p>"A man of that land who remains loyal to Your Majesty, and who calls
  himself 'Dr. Wu,' was also left for dead, but being less badly wounded than
  your servant, assisted him in getting back to the craft. After taking
  vengeance on the revolting city, we departed for the other side of Du Gong,
  where-"</p>

  <p>"That part of your story can wait, Kwan Tsu Khan," interrupted P'an-ku. "I
  take it that you suspect this Am-Er-I-Khan of having fomented the revolution
  in the land of our former allies."</p>

  <p>"Your wisdom, O Sole Vicar of the Great Lord Sun, is as brilliant and as
  penetrating as His rays."</p>

  <p>P'an-ku glared down at the professor.</p>

  <p>"What have you to say for yourself, Am-Er-I-Khan?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," replied the professor.</p>

  <p>"You see, O Light of Knowledge, this vile father of many crawling maggots
  admits his guilt."</p>

  <p>"I see," replied P'an-ku. "Ho, Tzien Khan. Take the prisoner to the
  torture rooms and give him the death of the many water drops."</p>

  <p>The Lunite designated as Tzien Khan stepped forth and took the professor's
  chain from the hand of Kwan Tsu Khan. Although the grizzled hairs of his
  long, stringy moustache and the many wrinkles of his parchment like
  countenance betokened great age, he seemed sprightly and quite muscular. His
  sadistic grin, as he jerked the prisoner away to execute the order of the
  monarch, revealed a single, fanglike tooth in the upper jaw, and but two
  below.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his sentence, Professor Ederson had expected the slow,
  torturing death of having water dripped on his forehead. He was surprised,
  therefore, when he learned the true nature of the Lunite death of the many
  water drops.</p>

  <p>After being led through a large room filled with many instruments of
  torture, and resonant with the shrieks of the victims of the wrath of
  P'an-ku, he was conducted to a small anteroom where two men, under the
  direction of Tzien Khan, removed his metal collar and seated him in a heavy
  metal chair which was bolted to the floor. These two men, as well as the
  others whose work it was to torture the prisoners, had their faces hideously
  painted with rings and lines of red and blue pigment.</p>

  <p>When they had the professor strapped securely in the chair, they measured
  his head. Then they went out, and presently returned with a metal helmet with
  a ring in the top. The helmet fitted his skull almost as tightly as if it had
  been made to order for him, and a metal chin piece which was fastened beneath
  the ears on either side was fitted in place and secured. A metal cable with
  hooks on each end was next passed through two stout pulleys suspended from
  the ceiling, one of which was directly above his head and the other about
  three feet in front of it.</p>

  <p>One end of the cable was hooked through the ring in his helmet. Then one
  of the men lifted a large, cylindrical vessel with a funnel-like opening and
  basket-like handle at the top, and hooked it on the other end.</p>

  <p>This done, Tzien Khan turned a valve, and a drop of water fell into the
  vessel. Noting its fall he watched a small instrument, evidently a
  chronometer, which he took from his belt pouch, until a second had fallen.
  For some time he continued to adjust the valve, until the falling drops
  seemed timed to his liking. Then he dismissed his two attendants and turned
  to the professor with his cruel, toothless grin.</p>

  <p>"Farewell, O spawn of a slimy worm," he said. "In your slow and painful
  passing, meditate on the folly of opposing your puny will to that of the Lord
  of the Universe."</p>

  <p>The professor was unable to make a reply, even had he desired to do so,
  for the weight of the vessel had pulled the helmet and chin piece so high
  that speech was impossible. The cords of his neck began to pain him sharply,
  and he tried to think of something which would take his mind off the
  pain.</p>

  <p>With the aid of his wrist watch, he calculated that the water was dripping
  into the container at the rate of a drop every minute. A dram an hour. Three
  ounces in a day. How much weight could the cords and muscles withstand? How
  long had he to live?</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">19.</a> &mdash; DUNGEONS OF DARKNESS</h2>

  <p class="first">Ted Dustin's first glimmer of returning consciousness after
  his space flier had crashed with him in the crater of Copernicus, was a
  queer, swinging sensation.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes and saw the broad shoulders of an armored warrior, on
  one of which rested a pole. The other end of the pole was carried by another
  warrior behind, and he was swinging in a net, each end of which was fastened
  to the pole. Two more warriors armed with long spears with heads that
  resembled long-toothed buzz saws, and with swords and ray projectors belted
  about their waists, walked on either side. He could hear the clanking armor
  of many more behind. An officer, in gaudy armor, walked ahead.</p>

  <p>The young scientist saw that he was being carried through a beautiful
  garden of luminous trees, shrubs and plants, toward a tall, hexagonal
  building crowned with a pagoda-like structure of yellow metal, brilliantly
  lighted.</p>

  <p>Presently the column came to a halt before a broad flight of steps leading
  up to a great diamond-shaped door. Standing on the lower step, surrounded by
  his courtiers, slaves and attendants, he recognized the huge rotund figure of
  P'an-ku.</p>

  <p>At a command from the leader he was lowered to the ground. Then the two
  men who had been carrying him seized him on each side, and jerking him erect,
  dragged him before the monarch.</p>

  <p>"O, Vicar of the Great Lord Sun," intoned the officer. "I bring you alive,
  the presuming parasite from Du Gong who destroyed the experimental ray
  projector."</p>

  <p>"By the sacred bones of my worshipful ancestors!" exclaimed P'an-ku,
  peering down at the prisoner over his puffy cheeks, and twisting his long,
  stringy moustache. "If Dr. Wu sent us the correct description, it is none
  other than the upstart who' calls himself a scientist, Ted Dustin."</p>

  <p>"And if I mistake not," replied Ted, smiling, "you are P'an-ku, the master
  of bombast who calls himself 'Lord of the Universe.'"</p>

  <p>"O, slimy worm and wriggling maggot of Du Gong," grated P'an-ku. "Think
  you that you have performed a great service for your people by destroying my
  experimental ray projector? Know then, that I am building, and will have
  completed in less than five of your days, a projector with ten times its
  power. You could have destroyed it as easily as the other, but you have
  merely saved me the effort of dismantling the smaller projector."</p>

  <p>"Everything in its turn," replied Ted, feigning a complacency he did not
  feel.</p>

  <p>"As to your death," continued P'an-ku, closely watching his prisoner for
  signs of fear, "I will ponder over it. It was you who destroyed Ur&mdash;you
  who defied me-you who thought to break my power by destroying a small
  experimental projector. I must have leisure to devise a punishment befitting
  your crimes."</p>

  <p>He turned to the officer who had brought up the prisoner, saying:</p>

  <p>"Away with him, to the dungeons of eternal darkness."</p>

  <p>Ted was hustled away to a small side entrance on the ground level of the
  palace, along a hallway, through a torture chamber where victims shrieked
  their anguish and hideously painted torturers laughed at their agonies, then
  down a spiral ramp dimly lighted by small globes of luminous yellow liquid,
  which appeared almost endless, so deeply did it penetrate the damp rock.</p>

  <p>Presently, when it seemed to the young scientist that he must be at least
  a mile beneath the palace, the two men who were dragging him halted at a
  sharp command from the officer who led the way.</p>

  <p>The officer then lighted a head lamp on the front of his pagoda-like
  helmet, and plunged into a dark hole in the wall, followed by the two
  warriors with their prisoner.</p>

  <p>They were in a hand-hewn cavern, roughly circular in form. Cut in the wall
  at irregular intervals were the openings of passageways which led away from
  the cavern in all directions. The officer led the way into one of these
  passageways which was filled with a horrible, sickening stench that became
  stronger as they advanced.</p>

  <p>Presently the passageway widened, and the cause of the foul odors became
  apparent, as Ted saw, leaning against the back of a niche cut in the wall at
  the right, a bloated, festering corpse, chained by the neck to a ring in the
  wall in such a manner that had the person been living he would neither have
  been able to stand erect nor lie down.</p>

  <p>In niches on both sides of the passageway there now came into view more
  corpses in all stages of decay from cadavers of the freshly dead to mere
  skeletons. The floors of ail the niches were littered with human bones, as
  was the passageway itself, but the warriors stepped over them or kicked them
  out of the way without notice.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, from the gloom ahead, there came a horrible, blood-curdling
  shriek, followed by peal after peal of demoniac laughter.</p>

  <p>"Aiee-yah! Ha! Ha! Ha! Aiee-yah! Men and light! Light and life! Darkness
  and death! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!"</p>

  <p>"Shen Ho still lives in body," whispered one of the soldiers to the other,
  "but his mind is dead."</p>

  <p>"A mighty mind while it lived," replied the other. "No puny intellect
  could have given us back the green ray of our ancestors."</p>

  <p>"Yet none but a fool would dare oppose P'an-ku, Lord of the Universe,"
  countered the first.</p>

  <p>"All wise men are fools in some things," was the reply.</p>

  <p>A moment later Ted saw the madman, squatting in his filthy niche and
  combing his stringy gray beard with bony, clawlike fingers. A few dirty
  shreds of clothing still clung to his wasted body&mdash;clothing which had
  evidently been made from the richest of materials of the kind worn by great
  nobles.</p>

  <p>"Aiee!" he shrieked. "Another victim of the darkness!"</p>

  <p>The officer had stopped, and was peering into the niche opposite that of
  the madman. A skeleton, on which there hung a few unclean rags that had once
  been clothing, half leaned against the wall, the white skull nesting in the
  metal collar which hung at the end of the short, stout chain fastened to the
  wall.</p>

  <p>"This one will do," he said, and entering, kicked the moulding bones into
  a corner with one foot while he shook the chain to dislodge the skull from
  the collar.</p>

  <p>With a key taken from his belt pouch, the officer unlocked the heavy
  collar and sprung it open. Then, while the two warriors held the prisoner in
  position, he snapped it on his neck, locked it, and replaced the key in his
  belt pouch.</p>

  <p>"I leave you in distinguished company, O wise fool of Du Gong," said the
  officer. "Dead men who have been doughty warriors and mighty Khans, and a
  madman who was once the mightiest and wisest of all khans. Farewell."</p>

  <p>Ted, who was now chained so he could neither stand erect nor lie down,
  squatted on his haunches among the bones of his filthy den, and watched the
  light from the head lamp of the departing officer grow more dim, until it
  finally disappeared and he was left in complete blackness.</p>

  <p>Then he reached back to open his suit of insulating armor, which fastened
  in the back with an arrangement somewhat resembling a terrestrial zipper.
  With this armor off it would be an easy matter for him to get rid of his
  collar and chain, and he would have a fighting chance for his life, as his
  two pistol degravitors were underneath the armor and over the court suit he
  had been wearing when he had suddenly decided to attack the green ray
  projector in his flier.</p>

  <p>To his consternation, however, the fastening would not budge. Like its
  terrestrial cousin the zipper, it worked beautifully when in good order, but
  when jammed it proved ten times as stubborn. Evidently it had been bent out
  of shape when his ship crashed with him in the crater. He worked futilely at
  it for more than two hours, then gave up the attempt as hopeless.</p>

  <p>Presently a new idea occurred to him, and he began picking and pulling at
  the fuzzy exterior of his armor on his right side. If he could only make a
  hole big enough to get his hand on the pistol degravitor that pressed against
  his thigh the rest would be easy. But the armor proved as baffling as its
  fastenings, for interwoven with its tough fibers were tiny metal wires of
  extraordinary strength. He was still picking hopelessly at these wires when
  the madman in the cell across from him, who had been quiet up to this time,
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, white man?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Surprised at the calm tones of this perfectly sane question, Ted
  replied:</p>

  <p>"Men call me Ted Dustin."</p>

  <p>"A peculiar name," mused Shen Ho. "From what part of Ma Gong do you
  come?"</p>

  <p>"I am from Du Gong," replied Ted.</p>

  <p>"From Du Gong! Are you mad, or can it be that I am as mad as I have
  pretended to be? If you are from Du Gong how did you get here?"</p>

  <p>"In my space flier," answered Ted.</p>

  <p>"You are a scientist?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I, too, am a scientist. I rediscovered the secret of the green ray of our
  ancestors, after it had been lost for thousands of years. It was my idea to
  use the ray for defense, but P'an-ku decided to use it for conquest. I
  objected. That is why I am here&mdash;have been here for more than a year. He
  would have killed me long ago by torture had it not been that he thought he
  might want to use my brain for his benefit later. As I have nothing left to
  live for, I feign madness in the presence of the guards, hoping that my
  execution will be ordered and I may be released from this horrible existence
  &mdash;this living death. Why has P'an-ku sent you here?"</p>

  <p>"I am his prisoner of war," replied Ted, and recounted all that had
  happened from the time he had fired his projectile at the moon. It was a
  relief to have someone to talk to there in the stinking darkness.</p>

  <p>"Many strange things can happen in a year," said Shen Ho, when Ted had
  finished his story. "And to think, he has used not only my invention, but the
  inventions of my two younger brothers for a war of conquest. My brother Wen
  Ho, who is five years younger than I, invented the flying globe. My brother,
  Fen Ho, who is seven years my junior, was the inventor of the powerful
  explosive projectiles and firing mechanism. We of the house of Ho spent our
  lives and our talents on these inventions in order that our people might have
  adequate defensive weapons and live in peace forever. But P'an-ku thought
  differently about these things, and his word is law."</p>

  <p>"Did he jail your brothers, also?" asked Ted.</p>

  <p>"They were condemned to these dungeons at the same time as I," replied
  Shen Ho, "but we were all chained in separate passageways. I know not whether
  they are living or dead."</p>

  <p>"If you found an opportunity to escape, what would you do?" asked Ted.</p>

  <p>"First I would search for my brothers and attempt to rescue them or assure
  myself that they had perished. This accomplished, I would seek P'an- ku."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"And then, the Lord Sun willing, P'an-ku should die."</p>

  <p>"I have the means of escape at hand, yet cannot reach them." said Ted,
  explaining the nature and position of his two pistol degravitors. "If I could
  but get my hand on one of these weapons, I could destroy our fetters. Then we
  could help each other."</p>

  <p>For some time Shen Ho was silent. Then he suddenly exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"I have a way."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"By persistent rubbing, human teeth will sever that wire."</p>

  <p>"But I can't bite my own hip," replied Ted. "That's out."</p>

  <p>"There are several skulls in your cell," said Shen Ho, "and in the jaws
  are teeth."</p>

  <p>"Right!" exclaimed Ted. "We have a saying on Du Gong that two heads are
  better than one."</p>

  <p>"And you will find," replied Shen Ho, "that if the first set of teeth
  wears out, two or three skulls are better than one. When and if you run out
  of skulls I have plenty more over here."</p>

  <p>After groping about in the darkness for some time, Ted finally secured a
  skull, tore the jaw bone loose, and began sawing at the armor over his right
  hip. It was slow work. The wires were tougher by far than he had thought
  possible, and as Shen Ho had predicted, the teeth in the jaw bone he used
  were being ground away. When he had worn them down to the bone after many
  hours of patient labor, he discarded the lower jaw and went to work with the
  upper set of teeth. These, also, were nearly worn away with but slight effect
  on the armor, when a light suddenly appeared far down the passageway.</p>

  <p>"It is a slave with our food and drink," whispered Shen Ho. "Cease your
  labors until he has gone. I will feign madness, as usual."</p>

  <p>Ted laid the skull on the floor and sat down with his back against the
  wall, while Shen Ho laughed and shrieked until the whole cavern resounded
  with his weird cries.</p>

  <p>The slave, a yellow, round-bodied Lunite who wore a light strapped to his
  forehead, a long, loose shirt of some coarse material, and straw sandals, set
  a bowl of stewed fungus and a large cup of water before each prisoner.
  Although he was without appetite in his ill-smelling surroundings, Ted choked
  down the fungus and drank the water, not knowing how soon he might again be
  offered food and drink.</p>

  <p>When the prisoners had finished their frugal meal the slave took the bowls
  and cups and departed, leaving them in total darkness once more.</p>

  <p>Ted picked up a skull, the position of which he had marked while eating
  his meal, tore off the jaw bone, and resumed work on the armor. When he felt
  sure the slave was out of earshot, he asked Shen Ho how often food and drink
  were served.</p>

  <p>"The slave comes once in a rotation of your world," replied Shen Ho. "Our
  world moves so slowly on its axis that we use the rotation of yours to mark
  our measurement of time. We have our chronometers, of course, but your world
  is the great chronometer in the sky by which our own are guided and
  corrected. I had a small timepiece when I was brought here, but it ceased to
  function long ago and I gave it to a slave as a bribe for some few morsels of
  better food than is sent here regularly. A short time thereafter, that slave
  was chained in the niche you now occupy. He cursed me when he told me he had
  been caught with my chronometer and forced to confess his defection. Being
  quite superstitious, he died from terror in a short time, and it was his
  skeleton that was kicked into the corner by the guard and his skull that was
  shaken out of the collar to make a place for you..."</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Four times, thereafter, the slave came with food, thus marking the passage
  of five earth days in all. Ted had used up all the available teeth in his own
  niche, and was working with the upper set of the last skull which Shen Ho had
  been able to produce and toss over to him, but although he had cut through
  many wires in his armor, he was still unable to reach his degravitor.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a light, brighter than the headlamp of the slave, appeared at the
  entrance of the passage way. The clank of arms and the footsteps of mailed
  warriors resounded through the cavern.</p>

  <p>"Where have they hidden this miserable worm from Du Gong?" asked a
  voice.</p>

  <p>"The officer said he was far back in the passageway, excellency," answered
  another.</p>

  <p>"I know that first voice," whispered Shen Ho. "It is the cruel Tzien, who
  is Khan of the Torture Chambers. With him are four of his painted tortures.
  Work fast, Ted Dustin, or you are doomed."</p>

  <p>Ted scraped frantically at the remaining wires which kept him from
  reaching his degravitor. Several snapped, and he attempted to insert his
  hand, but the opening was still too small.</p>

  <p>"Hurry!" called Shen Ho. "They are almost here!"</p>

  <p>Gripping the skull in both hands, Ted scraped in frenzied haste while the
  footfalls and clanking armor grew louder. More wires snapped, yet he could
  not get his hand in the opening.</p>

  <p>Before he could move, Tzien Khan, with his cruel features contorted in a
  grin of sadistic delight, stepped into view followed by four of his brawny,
  hideously painted torturers. Then Shen Ho howled and laughed, and muttered of
  light and life, and of darkness and death.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">20.</a> &mdash; TRAPPED</h2>

  <p class="first">P'an-ku, iris hands clasped about his ample equatorial
  region, leaned back in his luxuriously cushioned throne and listlessly
  contemplated the humped figure of his major domo who, with palms and forehead
  pressed to the floor before the dais, awaited permission to speak.</p>

  <p>"Now what low person disturbs our meditations?" demanded P'an-ku.</p>

  <p>"O, worshipful Lord of the Universe," replied the major domo, "Kai Lo,
  Khan of Scouts, begs leave to impart tidings."</p>

  <p>"Admit him," said P'an-ku. Then he turned to Dr. Wu, who stood at the
  right of the throne, having advanced himself in the graces of the monarch he
  regarded almost as a god, and said: "I presume he will tell me that the white
  Princess is about to storm the city. I knew this five days ago when my spies
  in Ultu informed me of her pact with the worm of Du Gong who called himself
  Roger Sanders."</p>

  <p>Kai Lo Khan, a short individual with an oval body and thin, crafty
  features, entered and prostrated himself before the throne.</p>

  <p>"Speak," commanded P'an-ku.</p>

  <p>"O, Paragon of Wisdom and Fountain of All Authority," said Kai Lo Khan,
  "the army of the Princess Maza is surrounding the city. With her are a
  hundred thousand nak-kar cavalry and five hundred thousand foot."</p>

  <p>"Dolt!" thundered P'an-ku. "I knew all this was to be five days ago, and
  am prepared."</p>

  <p>"But Majesty, that is not all. She has sent a party to the western gate of
  the city under a banner of truce."</p>

  <p>"Ah! She would parley. Go then to the gate and take her message."</p>

  <p>Again prostrating himself, Kai Lo Khan hastily departed.</p>

  <p>Not more than twenty minutes elapsed before he returned and made
  obeisance.</p>

  <p>"I have brought the message of the Princess, O Vicar of the Sun," said he,
  producing a scroll.</p>

  <p>"Read it," commanded P'an-ku.</p>

  <p>Kai Lo Khan unrolled the scroll, cleared his throat, and read:</p>

  <p>Her Imperial Majesty, Maza an Ma Gong to His Royal Highness, P'an-ku an
  Peilong.</p>

  <p>Greeting: Surrender the person of Ted Dustin, living and unharmed, and
  Peilong will be spared. Refuse, and my army will destroy it utterly.</p>

  <p>Maza an Ma Gong.</p>

  <p>"Tell her," thundered P'an-ku, "that Ted Dustin will this day be made to
  suffer the death of the hot oil. Tell her further, that we are prepared for
  her attack, and that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardon, O just and mighty Dictator of the Universe!" It was Dr. Wu who
  had interrupted. The courtiers looked at him in amazement, apparently
  expecting P'an-ku to have him executed for his temerity, but he continued.
  "May your worthless slave from Du Gong suggest a plan?"</p>

  <p>"Speak," replied P'an-ku.</p>

  <p>"Would it please Your Majesty to have the white Princess as a
  prisoner?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing would suit me better," replied P'an-ku. "Tzien Khan, here, could
  very quickly persuade her to become my queen, could you not, my Khan of the
  Torture Chambers?"</p>

  <p>"Assuredly, O King of the Age, if she should be so foolish as to need such
  persuasion," replied Tzien Khan with a bow.</p>

  <p>"After which," continued P'an-ku, "with her armies and her wealth at my
  disposal, I could quickly bring both Du Gong and Lu Gong under my undisputed
  sway. But what is your plan, Dr. Wu?"</p>

  <p>"It is apparent from her message," said the wily doctor, "that the
  Princess loves this Ted Dustin. If the prisoner, therefore, or someone
  purporting to be the prisoner, were sent out, she would not overlook an
  opportunity for speech with him."</p>

  <p>"Very likely," replied P'an-ku.</p>

  <p>"I suggest therefore," continued the crafty doctor, "that you dress one of
  your white prisoners who is about the size of Ted Dustin in a suit of
  insulating armor and glass helmet of the kind worn by the people of Ultu.
  Send a note to the Princess stating that you will constitute Ted Dustin your
  messenger for a peace parley at a point half way between the western gate and
  the front line of her army, stipulating that she be accompanied by not more
  than ten unmounted men, and that a like number will accompany Ted Dustin.</p>

  <p>"Men can be posted at suitable points along the wall with green ray
  projectors to lay down a barrage at a prearranged signal. This will prevent
  her from getting back to her army, or prevent the army from reaching her. In
  the meantime, her guard can easily be destroyed and the Princess taken
  prisoner."</p>

  <p>"What think you of this plan, Kai Lo Khan?" asked P'an-ku.</p>

  <p>"It sounds feasible, O Bright and Shining Cousin of the Sun," replied the
  Khan of Scouts, cautiously.</p>

  <p>"And you, Tzien Khan?"</p>

  <p>"I believe it would work, O Lord of Worlds," replied the Khan of
  Torturers.</p>

  <p>"We will try it," decided P'an-ku. "You, Tzien Khan, will take one of the
  Ultuan prisoners who resembles Ted Dustin in physical proportions and dress
  him in a suit of the armor we took when we captured a troop of the surface
  scouts of the white princess.</p>

  <p>"You, Kai Lo Khan, will go to Chu Yan, Khan of my army, inform him of our
  plans, and see that he has men with ray projectors suitably posted on the
  walls and ten men ready to accompany the prisoner to the meeting place. I
  will send a messenger with a note to the Princess, at once.</p>

  <p>"And, Tzien Khan. When you have prepared a prisoner to represent the young
  scientist of Du Gong, you may take Ted Dustin from the dungeons of eternal
  darkness to the torture chambers, and there inflict on him the death of the
  hot oil. I had thought to delay his death and prolong his torture
  indefinitely, but with the prospect of the honor of a visit from the fair
  Princess who foolishly believes she loves him, it will be better to put him
  permanently out of her reach at once.</p>

  <p>"Now go, both of you."</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Seated on the back of her great, fighting nak-kar in one of the glades of
  the luminous forest which surrounded the city of Peilong, Maza waited
  impatiently for P'an-ku reply to her message. She wore a suit and helmet of
  shining white armor, and a sword and red ray projector depended from the belt
  which encircled her slender waist. Beside her, similarly armored and mounted,
  was the aged Vanible Khan.</p>

  <p>Ranged before her were line after line of her foot soldiers, and more,
  steadily coming up from the rear, were being hurried into place by their
  officers as the army encircled the city. Her nak-kar cavalry had deployed for
  attack, and the huge supply wagons, drawn by great, lumbering, wingless
  dragons, were rumbling into position.</p>

  <p>"P'an-ku ponders long over his reply, Your Majesty," said Vanible
  Khan.</p>

  <p>"It may be that he does not intend to make one," replied Maza. "He seems,
  however, to have respected my banner of truce."</p>

  <p>"I would not rest too strongly on the belief that Ted Dustin is alive,"
  said Vanible Khan. "If he escaped the green rays of the defenders when he
  attacked the great projector it would be amazing, but if P'an-ku were to
  capture him and spare his life it would indeed be astounding."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, I shall go on believing him alive until I have proof to the
  contrary," answered Maza. "I seem to feel it, here." She pressed her hand
  over her heart.</p>

  <p>Sailing gracefully over the treetops, a nak-kar alighted in the glade. Its
  rider dismounted, rushed to where Maza sat in her saddle, made obeisance, and
  presented a scroll.</p>

  <p>"A message from P'an-ku," he announced.</p>

  <p>The Princess eagerly seized and unrolled the missive, hastily scanning its
  contents.</p>

  <p>"He lives! Ted Dustin lives!"</p>

  <p>"And will P'an-ku surrender him without a struggle?" asked Vanible
  Khan.</p>

  <p>"I will read the message," she replied.</p>

  <p>His Imperial Majesty, P'an-ku an Ma Gong to Du Gong to Her Royal Highness,
  Maza an Ulta.</p>

  <p>If you care to meet him in person, Ted Dustin will tell you tire terms I
  propose. He will advance half way to your front lines, accompanied by ten of
  my guards, who will slay him at the first sign of treachery. Meet him there,
  on foot, with ten of your unmounted warriors, and perhaps a satisfactory
  settlement can be arranged.</p>

  <p>P'an-ku an Ma Gong to Du Gong.</p>

  <p>"The ruler of Peilong assumes mighty titles since he has acquired the
  green ray and the fighting globe," said Vanible Khan. "Emperor of Ma Gong and
  Du Gong, indeed! He will soon have the other planets, their satellites, and
  the Lord Sun under his domination, if words can do the trick. And he
  insultingly addressed Your Majesty as 'Ruler of Ulta,' ignoring your greater
  title."</p>

  <p>"I will overlook that for the present&mdash;to save Ted Dustin," replied
  Maza.</p>

  <p>"But, Your Majesty," remonstrated the aged scientist. "Don't you see that
  this bloated monster is setting a trap for you&mdash;a trap baited with the
  man you love?"</p>

  <p>"Trap or no trap," said Maza, "I am going."</p>

  <p>"Majesty, I implore you not to go. For the sake of Ulta&mdash;for the sake
  of the millions of subjects who love you-"</p>

  <p>"Enough!" she said. "The terms are fair enough&mdash;a trap well nigh
  impossible. I will be accompanied by ten of my warriors, who can, if need be,
  account for the ten accompanying Ted Dustin. I will be within plain sight and
  ray-range of the advance guard of my army. They will be instructed to protect
  me with a ray barrage at the slightest sign of trickery."</p>

  <p>'But, Majesty-"</p>

  <p>"Not another word. I leave my army in your care until my return. If I do
  not come back&mdash;if I am killed or captured&mdash;attack the city at once,
  and continue the fight until Peilong is utterly destroyed. Goodbye, my worthy
  Khan and lifelong friend."</p>

  <p>Grief stricken, Vanible Khan bowed his head in farewell obeisance, while
  tears trickled down his furrowed cheeks. When he raised his tear-dimmed eyes
  the nak-kar with his beloved young ruler was disappearing over the
  treetops.</p>

  <p>Alighting just behind the front line of her troops Maza dismounted, tossed
  her reins to a soldier, and addressed a young officer who ran quickly to her
  side and made obeisance.</p>

  <p>"Pick me ten of your bravest soldiers at once," she said. "They will go
  with me for a parley midway between my front line and the city gate. Instruct
  the men in the front line to be ready to throw a ray barrage around me at the
  least indication of treachery."</p>

  <p>She watched the gate while the young officer selected the men who were to
  go with her. One by one they took up a position in a line behind her.</p>

  <p>Presently the gate opened, and she saw a man the size and build of Ted
  Dustin emerge there-from, followed by ten of P'an-ku's soldiers. She had last
  seen Ted attired in one of the insulated suits with glass helmet which her
  people wore for surface travel, and this man was so attired. Her heart leaped
  with joy, and as she went out expecting to meet the man she loved, followed
  by her ten soldiers, there was not the slightest doubt in her mind that this
  was really Ted Dustin.</p>

  <p>As she drew nearer to the man who was coming toward her, Maza felt that
  there was something about him which was not just as it should be. What is it?
  Ah, his gait. He did not walk with long, easy strides like those of the earth
  man, whose muscles, accustomed to a greater gravity pull, involuntarily
  carried him much further at each step than the stride of the most athletic of
  moon men. Besides, if he felt as she did, he would hurry to meet her, in
  which case she knew the mighty bounds through space of which he was
  capable.</p>

  <p>For a moment she paused, doubting. Then came the thought that Ted might be
  adapting his stride to suit that of his captors&mdash;might indeed be
  compelled to do so. Furthermore, the size, build and attire were correct.</p>

  <p>When within fifty feet of the man she strained her eyes to see his face in
  the glass helmet. The light from the luminous forest was quite dim at this
  point, and the yellow lights from the city were more of a hindrance than a
  help as they shone in her eyes from behind him without lighting his face.</p>

  <p>A distance of twenty feet was reached, and it seemed that if she could not
  recognize the man he, with the light in his favor, should be able to
  recognize her.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he called out:</p>

  <p>"Retreat Majesty, quickly! It is a trap!"</p>

  <p>The voice and face she recognized simultaneously. The man was one of her
  nak-kar scout officers she had believed slain in a battle with the flying
  globes.</p>

  <p>Instantly a green ray from the projector of one of the warriors behind him
  cut him down.</p>

  <p>Maza whipped out her own red ray projector and the man who had flashed his
  green ray disappeared in a sudden burst of flame. Not a second elapsed before
  her men were drawing their ray projectors, but the nine remaining warriors of
  P'an-ku were already on guard. The battle commenced with fencing, deadly as
  it was beautiful&mdash;green rays against red, red against green.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a barrage of green leaped out from the city walls and a
  barrage of red flashed out from the front rank of Maza's army. Where the rays
  met they neutralized each other, but enough green rays got through to form a
  triangle past which Maza and her little party could not retreat, while a
  similar triangle of red rays made it possible for the warriors of P'an-ku to
  retreat.</p>

  <p>One of Maza's men fell, crumpled to nothingness by a green ray, but as he
  fell he took with him his opponent in a brilliant flash of light. Then a ray
  from the wall, swinging unexpectedly into the little group, cut down three of
  the white warriors. This left seven red rays, counting Maza's, against eight
  green rays. With the odds in their favor, the yellow men redoubled their
  attack. The whites fought back furiously, and in a moment both parties were
  wiped out with the exceptions of Maza and one of P'an-ku's warriors.</p>

  <p>At ray-fencing, the Princess was the equal of any trained soldier in her
  army, but her opponent, she found, was the most skillful she had ever
  encountered. His tactics, however, were purely defensive except as he tried
  to destroy her projector. Evidently his orders had been to bring her in
  alive. He would feint, swinging his ray as if he meant to strike her down,
  but never in a direct line with her body. Noticing this, she resolved to
  stake everything on one long chance. Accordingly, she held her projector away
  from her&mdash;a tempting bait. He swung for the lure, leaving his guard open
  for but an instant. But in that instant her red ray struck him full in the
  chest, and he was no more.</p>

  <p>While this duel was in progress Maza's men were rushing to her rescue from
  behind. And P'an-ku's men were pouring out of the city gate to meet them. She
  was alone in the center of a terrific battle, unable to move more than twenty
  feet in any direction because of the double ray barrage which surrounded
  her.</p>

  <p>Through the network of rays encompassing her, she saw a detachment of her
  nak-kar cavalry flying swiftly above the heads of her foot soldiers, the
  riders aiming their ray projectors at the men on the walls and pouring
  through the gate. Here and there great sections of the wall disappeared in
  bursts of smoke as the red rays cut through the green barrage.</p>

  <p>Although the flying cavalry was doing terrific execution, its casualties
  were exceedingly heavy. Soon a number of the great beasts were riderless, but
  more were struck down by the green rays, nak-kars and riders falling together
  on the heads of the soldiers below. These and the fragments of rock and huge
  stalactites which fell from the roof of the cavern far overhead whenever
  green or red rays were accidentally directed too vertically, constituted
  almost as much of a menace as the rays themselves.</p>

  <p>When the first flying detachment was wiped out, a second flew into the
  breach, and the fighting became doubly furious.</p>

  <p>With the assistance of her flying warriors, the foot soldiers were gaining
  ground when a score of huge flying globes suddenly sailed out from over the
  city walls. They flew in a V shaped formation, with green rays ten times as
  powerful as those used by the soldiers, shining from their diamond-shaped
  port holes.</p>

  <p>The nak-kar cavalry fought bravely, but unavailingly as this solid wall of
  deadly green light approached. In less than ten minutes the entire detachment
  was wiped out. The globes then suddenly descended groundward, their rays
  forming a solid, impenetrable wall, and cutting off the red barrage rays
  which had formerly shielded Maza.</p>

  <p>Another globe then shot out from over the gate, and before she was aware
  of its purpose, had dropped a huge net around the Princess which knocked her
  red ray projector from her hand and entangled her in its meshes. She was
  drawn swiftly up to the bridge and dragged through one of the diamond-shaped
  openings while the globe sped swiftly back over the gate. Then, while two
  warriors held her, an officer whose face was bandaged and whose left arm hung
  in a sling, took her sword from her and cut the meshes of the net.</p>

  <p>With a scarcely perceptible jar, the globe alighted on the ground before a
  huge building which she instantly recognized from its pictures and
  descriptions as the palace of P'an-ku. The bridge of the globe leaned against
  a jutting balcony which was almost on a level with it.</p>

  <p>Stepping out of the door, the officer vaulted the railing, alighting on
  the balcony, and ordered the two soldiers to follow him with the
  prisoner.</p>

  <p>Maza was lifted over the railing and hurried along a corridor which led to
  a great diamond-shaped door on each side of which two armed guards were
  posted.</p>

  <p>A major domo announced in a loud voice: "Her Royal Highness, Maza an
  Ultu," and the Princess marched into the throne room between her two
  guards.</p>

  <p>The officer who had captured her advanced and made profound obeisance.</p>

  <p>"Well done, Kwan Tsu Khan," said P'an-ku. "Take a place of honor, here on
  my right hand, and we will speak of your reward later."</p>

  <p>The officer bowed his thanks and took a position beside Dr. Wu at the
  right of the throne. Then P'an-ku raised his hand and the two guards brought
  the prisoner before the throne, after which each prostrated himself before
  the monarch and stepped back twenty paces.</p>

  <p>Standing there alone in the middle of the floor, surrounded by enemies,
  Maza looked up unflinchingly into the gloating eyes of the porcine monster on
  the throne.</p>

  <p>P'an-ku rose ponderously and bowed&mdash;a ceremony due visiting
  royalty.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to Peilong, Princess of Ultu," he said. "We are deeply grateful
  for the honor of this unexpected visit."</p>

  <p>"What have you done with Ted Dustin, treacherous monster?" she
  demanded.</p>

  <p>P'an-ku smiled evilly, while he deliberately consulted his
  chronometer.</p>

  <p>"By this time," he said, "the worm of Du Gong who calls himself a
  scientist is undoubtedly dead&mdash;that is unless his white skin is so tough
  as to be impervious to boiling oil."</p>

  <p>The face of the Princess turned deathly pale. She swayed, and would have
  fallen to the floor had not the two guards behind her bounded forward and
  caught her by the arms.</p>

  <p>In a moment, however, she recovered her poise and shook herself free.</p>

  <p>"You have ordered the death of Ted Dustin," she said, "but in so doing you
  have pronounced the doom of Peilong and certified your own death warrant.
  When my army has finished with Peilong and with you, the dynasty of the P'an-
  kus will have ended forever. My grandfather made the mistake of granting your
  father freedom, and I am paying for his error, but the warriors of Ultu will
  take full vengeance."</p>

  <p>P'an-ku rose, and laughed sneeringly.</p>

  <p>"Your army will not long survive your lover," he said. "As for Ultu, a
  hundred of my globes left their hangars long before your clumsy attack on
  Peilong commenced, with commands to either capture or destroy the city. With
  their superior weapons and armament they cannot fail.</p>

  <p>"You are hopelessly beaten, O Princess, yet I am not the savage and
  relentless victor you seem to think me. True, I am a conqueror, and
  conquerors must be ruthless with their enemies. In the conquest of Ma Gong I
  have only begun to extend my domination. Next will come Du Gong, then Lu
  Gong, and finally all the inhabited and inhabitable planets that circle the
  great Lord Sun. I will be the greatest conqueror of all time-not merely a
  conqueror of nations, but a conqueror of worlds.</p>

  <p>"But with all this, I have a kind and generous heart. I could take
  vengeance on you, order your torture and death, or make you my slave, yet so
  magnanimously am I disposed toward you that I offer you the honor of becoming
  my queen&mdash;of ruling with me, the mightiest empire that has ever come
  under the control of one man."</p>

  <p>"And thus," replied Maza, scornfully, "heap insult upon injury. Give me
  death&mdash;by torture if you will, in preference to that."</p>

  <p>"You speak hastily," said P'an-ku, apparently unperturbed, "and in the
  heat of anger. Like most women you are temperamental. But I do not demand
  your answer now. You shall have time to think it over. And in the meantime, I
  have something to show you that will make you forget the relatively
  insignificant conquest of your people. Come with me and I will show you, even
  at this moment, the beginning of my conquest of a world."</p>

  <p>He signed to the two guards, who closed in on each side of the Princess
  once more. She was then compelled to follow P'an-ku out of the throne room
  and down a hallway which led to a large, bullet-shaped elevator. Into this
  they stepped, and were shot swiftly upward.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">21.</a> &mdash; EARTH'S OFFENSIVE</h2>

  <p class="first">With Bevans at the helm and Roger Sanders in command, the
  mighty interplanetary battleship which was the child of Ted Dustin's fertile
  brain, took off from Chicago just four days after Roger's radio conversation
  with Maza, and one day before his appointment with her in Peilong.</p>

  <p>Buildings, housetops and thoroughfares were packed with millions of people
  with every conceivable eye-aid from opera glasses to telescopes, tensely
  awaiting the departure of the "Luna"&mdash;for such she had been
  christened.</p>

  <p>She was only two hundred feet in length-smaller than the mighty aerial
  battleships of the United States Navy. But despite her relative smallness,
  she could easily have wiped out, in a few minutes, the entire fleet of a
  hundred great aerial battleships which formed a cordon around Ted's plant, to
  see her off, and to fire parting salvoes. The air about this mighty fleet
  swarmed with every conceivable type of air craft from the small helicopter
  taxicabs to huge passenger ships.</p>

  <p>Escorted by this stupendous array of air craft, the Luna soared gracefully
  upward to a height of ten miles-the utmost distance to which any of the other
  craft could follow her-then shot toward the zenith which such speed that in
  less than a minute she was lost to the view of the beholders.</p>

  <p>Built for warfare of a type never previously contemplated by men of earth,
  she was a marvel of mechanical perfection and offensive and defensive
  efficiency. Her powerful atomotor could send her through space at a speed far
  greater than that attained by any of the planets in circling the sun&mdash;a
  speed so swift that no human eye could follow her movements.</p>

  <p>She had two sets of degravitors&mdash;one for offensive and the other for
  defensive purposes. Each of the four central turrets above deck mounted four
  cannon-like degravitors that would disintegrate the toughest steel up to a
  distance of twenty-five thousand miles, and other substances at lesser or
  greater distances according to their various cohesive powers. The two end
  turrets, fore and aft, each mounted six degravitors of the same size and
  power as the others, and midway between keel and rail each side of the craft
  bristled with twelve more of these potent projectors of destruction, which
  were in movable, ball-in-socket mounts, capable of being pointed in any
  direction.</p>

  <p>The defensive degravitors were much smaller and shorter than those to be
  used for offense, and instead of being pointed at the ends had short barrels
  and flaring blunderbuss-like muzzles. Instead of projecting their anode and
  cathode rays in nearly parallel lines, these weapons shot them out at widely
  diverging angles&mdash;scattered them so much that, placed as they were,
  their various rays united to form an invisible screen about the craft,
  impervious either to matter, light rays, or energy rays. When they were
  turned on the craft could have passed through a rapidly moving planetoid or
  even a planet without great shock, or danger either from heat, cold, or
  gravitational force. Sunlight, when striking them, was neither reflected nor
  absorbed, but converted into a white, innocuous luminescence, electrically
  and magnetically neutral, yet visible and transparent&mdash;a physical
  paradox that seemed like a ghost of real light.</p>

  <p>With these rays turned on, projectiles fired at the craft would be
  disintegrated before they could reach it. Concentrated rays of either
  contraction or dispersion, cold or hot, would be rendered harmless, even
  though they might be admitted in the form of mild, ghostly light.</p>

  <p>Sitting in the control cabin in the front of the craft, Roger watched the
  earth swiftly receding while Bevans, seated before a bewildering array of
  levers and buttons sent the craft hurtling swiftly toward the moon. The thick
  glass panels afforded a view upward, downward, straight ahead, and to either
  side, and mirrors connected with periscopes gave a clear view to the
  rear.</p>

  <p>"This baby sure can step," remarked Roger, glancing at his speedometer.
  "Thirty-five miles per second on the head at this instant."</p>

  <p>"She can that, sir," replied Bevans, "and I haven't opened her up all the
  way, either."</p>

  <p>"A hundred and twenty-six thousand miles per hour." calculated Roger, "and
  still accelerating. Why man, we'll be there in a couple of hours at this
  rate&mdash;a day ahead of time! It's all right, though. We can hide out in
  some crater, do a little exploring, get accustomed to the lunar gravity and
  have target practice with the degravitors. We'll need it if P'an-ku sends a
  bunch of those fighting globes of his after us."</p>

  <p>Presently Roger looked out the forward window, then said:</p>

  <p>"We're getting pretty close to the moon, now. Start easing her down while
  I decide on a landing place. Better not go too close to Copernicus today. Too
  near the scene of activities. We might get into a scrap before our allies get
  there. On the other hand, if we land at Tycho we may be mistaken for enemies
  and have to fight Maza's guards. I think the wise thing to do will be to land
  on the central peak of the crater Pitatus. It's sort of in line between Tycho
  and Copernicus, and far enough from the latter so we would not be involved in
  a battle before we're ready. We can keep a sharp lookout, and duck down into
  that deep valley between Pitatus and Hesiodus if we don't care to fight an
  approaching enemy."</p>

  <p>Bevans, who had memorized the outstanding features of the moon, instantly
  pointed the craft toward Pitatus while he gradually slowed her headway with
  blasts from the forward exhaust arms of the atomotor.</p>

  <p>In less than two hours after they left Chicago, they landed in a slight
  depression on the sharp central peak of Pitatus.</p>

  <p>The rest of the day was spent in degravitor practice, and in preparation
  for the morrow's battle. So far as light was concerned, the night was exactly
  like the day, nevertheless, officers and crew took their turns at sleeping
  and watching.</p>

  <p>It was nearly noon of the next day by their earthly chronometers when
  Roger, who was about to give orders for the flight to Copernicus, was
  startled by a call from a lookout in one of the turrets. The voice of the man
  came from a small electric speaker at his elbow.</p>

  <p>"A big fleet of globes coming from the northeast, sir."</p>

  <p>Roger took up his binoculars and trained them toward the northeast.</p>

  <p>"Must be at least a hundred of them," he said to Bevans, "and they're
  coming at quite a lively clip. Too late to try and dodge out of sight now. I
  think the best plan is to keep perfectly still. Moving objects catch the eye
  much quicker than stationary ones."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe they'll notice us here, at all, sir," answered</p>

  <p>Bevans, using his own glasses. "Looks as if they are going to pass right
  over the center of Hesiodus, in which case they'll miss us by about
  forty-five miles."</p>

  <p>The globes were traveling with such speed that it took but a minute for
  them to confirm Bevans' assertion, which they did, almost to a mile,
  continuing on toward the southwest.</p>

  <p>"Wonder what they're up to," mused Roger. "They seem to be heading
  straight toward Tycho. Why, it's plain as day. They're sneaking over to
  attack Maza's capital from above ground while she's attacking theirs from
  below. Mighty clever of old P'an-ku. Well, here's where our little Luna gets
  busy."</p>

  <p>He gave a few brief orders, and the Luna gently rose from her resting
  place and set out after the menacing fleet. As soon as he got near enough to
  Tycho to use his binoculars, Roger saw that the battle was already in
  progress. Red rays were flashing out at the invaders from the crater walls
  and central peaks, and nak-kar riders swarmed upward from the underground
  shafts like bees from a hive. The raiders had formed in a huge circle sixty
  miles in diameter, just outside the crater rim, and were pouring their
  powerful green rays in on the defenders with deadly effect. Roger saw two of
  the globes burst into flames and fall, but during that time more than a score
  of the stationary rays were put out of business, and hundreds of nak-kar
  riders were wiped out.</p>

  <p>The fleet of P'an-ku was easily slated for a quick victory before the Luna
  suddenly entered the lists. Then the degravitors went into action, and the
  menacing globes began dropping right and left, emitting lurid flashes of
  light where the invisible rays struck them. Before a green ray could even be
  trained toward the Luna half of the magnificent war fleet of P'an-ku had been
  destroyed. Then the green rays carne thick and fast, but Roger did not mind
  them, for his degravitor barrage made them as harmless as sunlight.</p>

  <p>Not more than a dozen of the globes remained when the commander of the
  fleet evidently discovered that his rays could not harm the strange craft
  from earth, and that his only chance for safety would be in flight. These
  remaining globes shot swiftly upward&mdash;so swiftly that it was difficult
  for the eye to note their progress, but the Luna was after them in an
  instant, and kept them well in range while her marksmen used the degravitors
  with deadly effect. Soon but one lone globe remained. It seemed to have an
  especially clever helmsman, who dodged hither and thither with such speed and
  in such unexpected ways that he had been able to elude the Luna's gunners. He
  suddenly set out in a zigzag course toward Copernicus, with the Luna in swift
  pursuit. A degravitor ray brought him down inside the crater just after he
  had crossed the rim and was ready to drop to safety.</p>

  <p>Bevans was unable to instantly check the forward flight of the Luna, and
  her momentum carried her ten miles past the crater rim and only a little over
  fifteen miles from the nearest central peak. Hundreds of powerful green rays
  instantly flashed up at the invader, and giant globes swarmed upward from the
  yawning mouths of mighty shafts, to attack. The globes were cut down by
  Roger's marksmen almost as fast as they emerged, and the green rays did no
  damage.</p>

  <p>Then there suddenly flashed from the second peak of the central group, a
  mighty green ray so powerful it would easily have made a thousand of the
  smaller defensive rays. It was pointed straight upward at the earth hanging
  in the heavens above them, and the spot where it struck&mdash;apparently some
  five hundred miles in diameter, plainly showed as a great greenish-white area
  in the Pacific Ocean when, a moment later, the ray winked out.</p>

  <p>The operators evidently had stopped for a moment to note its effect
  &mdash;perhaps to send a radio message to earth demanding instant surrender
  or threatening annihilation.</p>

  <p>"Turn the degravitors on the peak of that mountain," ordered Roger. "The
  globes can wait. We'll get them later."</p>

  <p>Before his instructions could be carried out it seemed that the ray
  operator had anticipated them, for the huge green ray flashed out once more,
  but this time it did not strike the earth. Instead, its powerful, deadly
  green light enveloped the Luna.</p>

  <p>Although the earth-craft was insulated against the cold of absolute zero,
  and was, in addition, protected by her aura of degravitor rays, she could not
  help feeling the tremendous power of the terrific de-energizing rays. In an
  instant her interior temperature, which had been kept comfortably warm at 70
  degrees Fahrenheit, dropped to the freezing point and rapidly went lower.</p>

  <p>"Up," ordered Roger, and Bevans shot the craft upward, temporarily
  escaping the paralyzing effect of the great ray. But the projector could be
  turned swiftly, and in a moment it was trained on them again. It was now the
  turn of the Luna to do some zig-zagging and dodging. As for her offensive
  tactics, Roger found that his degravitor rays were rendered harmless when in
  conflict with the rays from the great projector, and only took effect at
  times when they could, for a moment, elude the huge green beam which came
  from the mountain top.</p>

  <p>"We can't keep this up," said Roger, as the cabin grew colder and colder.
  "Try diving toward the base of the mountain, then up beneath the projector. I
  don't believe it can be pointed towards its own base, and P'an-ku will
  destroy his own city if he points it downward too far."</p>

  <p>Bevans instantly dropped the craft to within a hundred feet of the crater
  floor, then shot toward the base of the peak on which the ray was mounted.
  The mighty green ray followed them down so far it clipped a great valley
  through the crater wall behind them, but it could go no further.</p>

  <p>"Now!" said Roger, "Let them have it!"</p>

  <p>The degravitors were instantly trained on the mountain peak while the
  craft shot swiftly upward.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">22.</a> &mdash; THE FALL OF PEILONG</h2>

  <p class="first">With Tzien Khan and his four painted torturers confronting
  him in his dungeon cell, Ted Dustin tried frantically to reach his pistol
  degravitor through the hole he had scraped in his insulating armor, but his
  efforts were of no avail. The hole was too small. He quickly dropped his hand
  to his side in order that his attempt to reach the weapon might not be
  detected.</p>

  <p>Tzien Khan took a key from his belt pouch, and said:</p>

  <p>"Bend down your head, O spawn of a maggot, that I may remove your collar.
  And if you have a god, pray to him, for you have but a short time to
  live."</p>

  <p>Ted bent over as directed, and as he did so he heard a tearing sound that
  filled his heart with hope. While Tzien Khan fumbled with his collar lock his
  hand stole to his right hip and confirmed his hopes. The act of stooping over
  had completed the work of the past few days, and his fingers closed over the
  butt of his degravitor.</p>

  <p>As the collar dropped from about his neck, Tzien Khan ordered him to
  straighten up. He obeyed, but as he did so, whipped out his degravitor,
  pressed the trigger, and swung it in a narrow arc. The Khan and his four
  torturers were wiped out before one of them had an opportunity to use a
  weapon.</p>

  <p>"Well done, Ted Dustin!" called Shen Ho from the opposite cell. "I had
  given you up for dead."</p>

  <p>With the aid of his degravitor, Ted quickly got rid of his clumsy suit of
  insulating armor and appeared before the astonished Shen Ho in the rich
  garments of black and gold he had worn in Maza's court. Then he released his
  fellow prisoner by the simple expedient of flashing the degravitor rays for
  an instant on the collar lock.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was freed from his metal collar, Shen Ho armed himself with
  the weapons of Tzien Khan, belting the richly jeweled sword and ray projector
  about his waist. Then he took the weapons of the others, made them into a
  bundle bound together with one of the belts, and strapping the head lamp of
  Tzien Khan to his forehead, said:</p>

  <p>"Come, Ted Dustin. Help me release my brothers, and I will help you find,
  and, if the great Lord Sun wills, to slay the cruel tyrant who disgraces the
  great name of P'an-ku."</p>

  <p>"If you will help me to find and destroy the big green ray he is going to
  use against the earth I'll go anywhere with you," answered Ted.</p>

  <p>"That I promise to do, also, or give my life in the attempt," replied Shen
  Ho as they hurried along the passageway.</p>

  <p>When they arrived in the circular room at the base of the spiral ramp,
  Shen Ho turned into the first passageway at his right. Other than bones and
  dead bodies, he found only four half dead wretches, none of whom he
  recognized.</p>

  <p>Hurrying out of this passageway, he entered the next, and to his delight
  found Fen Ho, his youngest brother, alive and able to travel. After the young
  inventor of the projectiles and firing mechanism had been released and armed,
  the three men hurried out to the central room and back to the other
  passageways, one at a time, to search for Wen Ho. They found the inventor of
  the flying globe in the last passageway, sick, and barely able to talk. Shen
  Ho took a small phial of medicine from the belt pouch of Tzien Khan, a little
  of which he dropped on his brother's tongue. Fen Ho, meanwhile, busied
  himself with cutting the collar from his brother's neck with his green ray
  projector, and belting a sword and projector about his waist.</p>

  <p>The medicine, it appeared, had marvelous stimulating qualities, for Wen Ho
  quickly recovered his strength, and not only was able to travel with sword
  and projector belted to him, but insisted on carrying one of the long spears
  with a buzz saw-like head, which the torturers of Tzien Khan had dropped, and
  which Shen Ho had brought in his bundle.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Shen Ho, "we must pass through the torture chambers in order
  to get to the upper rooms of the palace. Every man must have his weapons
  ready as the torturers of Tzien Khan are armed, and quick to draw."</p>

  <p>Ted, with a degravitor in each hand, now insisted on taking the lead as
  they mounted the spiral ramp. On the way up, he met a guard, whose head
  instantly vanished from the man's neck before a leveled degravitor, and whose
  weapons were appropriated by the Ho brothers.</p>

  <p>Shen Ho extinguished his head lamp, now no longer necessary because of the
  yellow rays from small globes of luminous liquid, and enjoined absolute
  silence. As they mounted higher, however, this precaution was made
  unnecessary by the agonized shrieks of the tortured victims above them.</p>

  <p>When they reached the door of the torture chamber, Ted, with both
  degravitors ready for action, led a quick rush into the room. Twenty painted
  torturers, taken by surprise, reached for their weapons, but not one reached
  in time. Then Ted and Fen Ho plunged into the series of smaller chambers on
  the right, while Shen Ho and Wen Ho took those on the left.</p>

  <p>One after another, painted torturers went down before the degravitors of
  Ted or the green ray projectors of Fen Ho. Presently they reached the last
  chamber of the series and found no torturer present. It was occupied by but
  one victim, and Ted cried out in surprise as he recognized him.</p>

  <p>"Professor Ederson!" he exclaimed, "and I thought you safe in
  Chicago!"</p>

  <p>A flash of his degravitor cut the heavy cable which held the cylinder of
  water that was straining the professor's neck cords, and it crashed to the
  floor. Then, while Fen Ho swiftly released the savant's hands and feet, Ted
  removed the helmet and chin clamp.</p>

  <p>The professor attempted to speak, but his voice failed him, and he
  suddenly fainted, toppling into the arms of his young friend.</p>

  <p>"I'll carry him to the main torture chamber," said Ted. "You find Shen Ho
  and get that little bottle of medicine that revived Wen Ho. It may work on my
  friend."</p>

  <p>"It will," replied Fen Ho, speeding away.</p>

  <p>When Ted reached the central chamber with the slight form of the professor
  drooping in his arms, he found the three Ho brothers awaiting him.</p>

  <p>"Every torturer has been slain," said Shen Ho as he dropped some medicine
  on the tongue of the professor, "and no alarm has been given as yet, but we
  must work swiftly."</p>

  <p>The professor regained consciousness and the power of speech with
  remarkable speed, while Fen Ho and Wen Ho busied themselves with releasing
  such torture victims as were not yet mortally injured and mercifully
  dispatching the others. These men were armed with the weapons of the
  torturers and instructed to hold the chambers against all comers.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Ted," said the professor, "and these friends of yours for
  saving my life. I had reached the end of my rope both literally and
  figuratively. A few more drops of water in that cylinder would have snapped
  my cervical vertebrae."</p>

  <p>Ted introduced the three brothers to his old friend, and in a few moments
  the professor declared himself able not only to walk unaided, but to bear
  weapons. He declined one of the pistol degravitors when it was proffered him,
  but took a green ray projector, sword, and buzz-saw spear.</p>

  <p>"Now for that big projector of P'an-ku's," said Ted.</p>

  <p>"It will be in the second peak," answered Shen Ho. "Follow me, and I'll
  get you there in the shortest possible time."</p>

  <p>He led them along a narrow, winding passageway in which two palace
  attendants were met and summarily dispatched, to the base of a cylindrical
  shaft in which there was a diamond-shaped door. Shen Ho pulled once, then
  twice, then once again, on a tasseled cord that hung down from the center
  door, and the clang of a gong within answered each pull. Then there was a
  humming sound from behind the door, and it slid upward, revealing the
  interior of a large, bullet-shaped car with a lone operator who was attired
  in armor of brown metal and wore a sword and ray projector in his belt.</p>

  <p>No sooner did he see the five men in the passageway, than he reached for
  the control lever with one hand and his ray projector with the other. He had
  no chance to use either, however, for Wen Ho, anticipating this, swiftly
  thrust with his buzz-saw spear for the neck of the operator. As he thrust, he
  pressed a button in the side of the shaft which started the blade whirling
  and Ted, for the first time, saw the terrible efficiency of this weapon, the
  teeth of which cut through the armor plate as if it had been cheese,
  instantly shearing the head of the guard from his body.</p>

  <p>Then body and head were tossed from the car, and the five men, with Shen
  Ho at the controls, shot upward.</p>

  <p>Through the small diamond-shaped windows of the car, Ted saw that they
  presently shot above the roof of the palace, swiftly climbing a slender cable
  which extended up into the stalactite covered vault above. Just beyond the
  distant city walls, in every direction, he could see the flashing of green
  and red rays which told him that Maza was attacking the city, though he did
  not suspect that she had been taken prisoner.</p>

  <p>The car continued to travel upward on the slender cable until it entered
  an enormous, cone-shaped shaft more than a mile in diameter at the base, and
  slanting upward toward a glassed in opening at the top which was about five
  hundred feet across, and admitted a considerable amount of light to which
  there was a queer, greenish cast.</p>

  <p>Shen Ho, also looking upward, said:</p>

  <p>"See, Ted Dustin. Already they are using the great ray against your
  world."</p>

  <p>"I hope and pray that we will be able to prevent them from using it much
  longer," replied Ted.</p>

  <p>"Amen," said the professor fervently.</p>

  <p>Although the car was traveling upward in the shaft, which was plainly a
  volcanic crater, at a terrific rate of speed, Ted chafed impatiently until
  Shen Ho moved the control lever, gradually bringing it to a stop. He moved
  another lever and the diamond-shaped door slid upward, revealing a railed
  landing platform fastened to the side of the crater.</p>

  <p>Ted was the first to step out, and as he did so, he saw a party of people
  not more than fifty feet away on the same platform. Instantly he recognized
  the slender figure of Maza, still in her shining armor, being dragged along
  between two burly warriors while P'an-ku walked ahead. They had just stepped
  out of a car similar to the one in which he and his companions had come up,
  and P'an-ku, one foot on a winding stairway which led up into the rock, was
  saying:</p>

  <p>"So now, little white Princess, I will show you the conquest of a world,
  after which you will perhaps not think so ill of me as a prospective husband.
  At the head of these stairs is my&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He did not finish the sentence, for Ted, at this instant, blasted the
  heads from both the warriors who held Maza, with his degravitors, and the
  sound of their armored bodies clattering to the floor interrupted him.</p>

  <p>He whirled, whipping out a green ray projector, but before he could level
  it, Ted had destroyed it with a flash from one of his degravitors. He could
  as easily have destroyed his arch enemy then and there, but preferred to take
  him prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" he commanded, "or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sentence remained unfinished, for P'an-ku, with an alacrity which was
  astounding for one of his weight and years, had suddenly turned and darted up
  the winding stairway, disappearing beyond a curve in the wall.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the professor and the three Ho brothers had stepped out
  on the platform and were gazing at Ted, the Princess, and the two fallen
  warriors in an effort to understand just what had taken place.</p>

  <p>"Guard the Princess," Ted called to them. "I'm going after P'an-ku."</p>

  <p>With one terrific leap he landed at the foot of the stairway, then bounded
  up taking ten steps at a time with ease, momentarily expecting to overtake
  the yellow monarch around each curve. But P'an-ku had had a good start, and
  evidently was climbing with a speed far greater than that of which he
  appeared capable.</p>

  <p>At length Ted sighted him, climbing a metal ladder which led upward from a
  platform at the head of the stairway to a room above which was filled with an
  intricate array of machinery worked by more than a score of armed men and
  guarded by an equal number. Just above it the giant green ray flashed out
  horizontally.</p>

  <p>This time it was no part of Ted's intention to waste words on P'an-ku.
  Deliberately he raised a degravitor and sighted for the bullet head of the
  monarch.</p>

  <p>But before he could press the trigger there was a blinding flash of light,
  and the monarch, ladder, men, machinery and projector&mdash;all disappeared
  from view as completely as if they had never existed. Then there hove into
  view the prow of a flying vessel on which was inscribed the word "Luna," and
  Ted shouted for joy, waving frantically at two figures in the control cabin
  whom he recognized as Roger and Bevans.</p>

  <p>The air where he stood was being rapidly vitiated by its sudden contact
  with the tenuous atmosphere of the outer surface, but Ted stayed long enough
  to gesture toward the glazed top of the shaft, patted his degravitor, and
  then pointed one finger downward. Roger nodded as if he understood, and the
  Luna started for the glazed opening. Then the young scientist, gasping for
  breath, plunged down the stairway to the platform where Maza, the professor,
  and the Ho brothers awaited him.</p>

  <p>The Luna had already cut through the glazed top when he arrived, and was
  descending toward the little group on the platform. She drew alongside,
  opened a door and admitted them before there was any notable change in the
  quality of the air.</p>

  <p>In the happy reunion that followed, Ted, with his arm around his radiant
  little Princess, presented each of his friends in turn. Then he said:</p>

  <p>"We still have work to do. The army of the Princess is storming the city
  and, I'm afraid, fighting a losing battle against the globes of P'an-ku."</p>

  <p>"We can settle those globes in short order," replied Roger. "After 'em,
  Bevans! You should have seen what we did to the fleet sent against Ultu."</p>

  <p>"What did you do to them?"</p>

  <p>"Cleaned 'em out to the last globe," replied Roger.</p>

  <p>"Then you saved my city!" exclaimed Maza. "How can I thank you?"</p>

  <p>"Don't thank me," replied Roger, "thank Ted. Besides, he's in a better
  position to collect a reward than I am. Excuse me, please, while I direct the
  degravitor fire."</p>

  <p>Protected by her degravitor barrage, the Luna first descended to a
  position just above the great docks of P'an-ku, where she made short work of
  the reserve fleet. Then she rose and circled the city, safe from the menace
  of either red or green rays, leveling the walls with her keel degravitors
  while the gunners in the turrets picked off the globes.</p>

  <p>Quickly recognizing a friend in the strange and seemingly indestructible
  craft, the hosts of Ultu cheered, and went into the battle with redoubled
  vigor. In less than twenty minutes after the Luna had come on the scene, the
  last globe was destroyed and the city was in the hands of Maza's army.</p>

  <p>The Luna stopped in the palace courtyard for several hours, during which
  time Maza proclaimed Shen Ho Viceroy of Peilong&mdash;then proceeded to Ultu,
  where Ted and his Princess were married in regal magnificence, according to
  the ancient rites and customs of Maza's people.</p>
