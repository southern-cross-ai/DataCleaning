  <h2><a id="ch01"
     name="ch01">1.</a> &mdash; THE THEFT OF VERNIA</h2>

  <p class="first">Perhaps the furniture and decorations of the personal
  apartment of Robert Grandon would have appeared bizarre to earthly eyes. Its
  paneled walls were hung with strange weapons and still stranger trophies of
  the battlefield and chase&mdash;prized treasures of a soldier and a hunter.
  Skins of marmelots, fiercest cats of the Zorovian fern forests, and
  tremendous bear-like monsters known as ramphs, magnificent specimens all,
  were flung on the floor. Cloud-filtered sunlight entered through two immense
  windows that reached from floor to ceiling, opening on a private balcony
  which overlooked the palace gardens.</p>

  <p>A marmelot, carved from red wood and supporting a round top of polished
  crystal formed a table in the center of the room. Around it, in chairs carved
  in the representation of kneeling giants holding scarlet cushions which
  formed both seats and backs, were four men.</p>

  <p>"The power of the Huitsen must be broken, and broken forever," cried
  Aardven, brawny, bull-necked ruler of Adonijar. And he banged his huge fist
  on the table for emphasis, causing the kova cups to dance and rattle.</p>

  <p>Robert Grandon, former Chicago clubman who had fought his way to the
  throne of Reabon, mightiest empire of Venus, grimly nodded his assent, as did
  his two other guests, Ad, ruler of Tyrhana, and Zinlo, ruler of Olba. For the
  sake of privacy and comfort, he had dispensed with the rigid formality of the
  throne room, and received them in his own drawing room.</p>

  <p>Ad of Tyrhana stroked his square-cut, jet black beard meditatively. Then
  he turned to Grandon. I fear we have disturbed you at a most inopportune
  time. A man about to start on a honeymoon should not be annoyed with affairs
  of state. It was only after we learned of the latest outrage perpetrated by
  the yellow pirates, that Aardvan and I, who were awaiting Zinlo's return to
  Olba, decided to hurry here in one of his swift airships.</p>

  <p>"When he heard that one of my ships of war, crippled by a storm and half
  sinking, was set upon by these yellow fiends, part of its crew massacred and
  the rest carried off prisoners, and my daughter Narine taken to I know not
  what fate, we felt that something must be done, and done quickly."</p>

  <p>"And I heartily agree with you," said Grandon. "The imperial navy of
  Reabon is at your disposal. Do you have any plan of action to suggest?"</p>

  <p>"I felt sure you would come in with us," said Ad, "especially after my
  talk with Zinlo this morning. As I have intimated previously, we must make
  our plans in secret, and carry them out as unobtrusively as possible. The
  Huitsenni have spies everywhere. They have the treasure to hire the vile
  traitors among our people who will sell their honor for personal gains, but
  because of their peculiar physical characteristics they can do no
  eavesdropping among us themselves.".</p>

  <p>"We should have two main objectives: to sink or capture every pirate ship
  that sails the seas of Zorovia, and to find and take the secret port of
  Huitsen. It is a port of missing ships and treasure, of slaves who were once
  citizens of our own and other lands, a port of peril to every man, woman, and
  child on this planet."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea where to look for this hidden port?" asked Grandon.</p>

  <p>"We have no definite knowledge of its location, but the belief that it
  lies to the south has arisen from the fact that pirate fleets, leaving a
  scene of pillage, have almost invariably been observed to sail
  southward."</p>

  <p>"I believe my flyers can locate it," said Zinlo, toying with his kova
  cup.</p>

  <p>"It's a big world," boomed the gruff Aardvan, "and it will take a deal of
  flying, sailing, and marching to explore it all."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Mernerum will help us," suggested Ad.</p>

  <p>"I take it," replied Grandon, "that you are unaware of the strained, or
  rather severed relations between Mernerum and Reabon. This morning I ordered
  diplomatic relations severed with Zanaloth of Mernerum, because of his
  affront to my wife when she passed through his dominions some time ago."</p>

  <p>"We can do well enough without that dissolute, old rake," said Zinlo. "But
  we're keeping you from that honeymoon trip, Grandon. I understand that your
  expedition was ready to march when Ad and Aardvan arrived."</p>

  <p>"We'll give it up," Grandon assured them. "I'm sure Vernia won't mind for
  such, a worthy cause."</p>

  <p>"See here," Ad protested. We don't want any such sacrifice. Allow us to
  take a few of your ships for the present, and perhaps some warriors and
  munitions in case a landing party is required. Go on your honeymoon. Later,
  when we've discovered the port of peril, we'll notify you, and let you in at
  the kill."</p>

  <p>"But your daughter has been stolen. Every man on this planet, worthy of
  the name, should be willing to assist in the search."</p>

  <p>Ad sighed deeply, musingly. "Alas," he replied, "I fear all search for her
  will be vain. She has been gone for so long now that I can only hope to
  avenge her. But, of course, I, her father, shall continue to search." He
  arose, and continued: "My friends and allies, we have imposed long enough on
  this patient, young bridegroom. I'm sure you will all agree with me when I
  say that we don't want his help until after the honeymoon. Let him lend us a
  few ships and men now, and we'll call on him later."</p>

  <p>"Those are precisely my sentiments," roared the deep-voiced Aardvan, also
  rising.</p>

  <p>"And mine," echoed Zinlo. "And so, Grandon, we'll go down and join the
  group outside that's waiting to see you off. By the way, where are you
  bound?"</p>

  <p>"It was a toss-up whether to go to the wild mountain fastness of Uxpo, or
  enjoy the bathing, fishing, and boating of the Azpok coast. But the seashore
  won, and we chose a camping-place on a wild and unfrequented part of the
  coast."</p>

  <p>"Splendid! We'll see you outside."</p>

  <p>A half-hour later, speeded by an immense multitude that had lined the
  streets of Reabon to see them off, Grandon and his young bride, Vernia,
  Princess of Reabon, stepped into the waiting, one-wheeled motor vehicle, and
  with their guard of Fighting Traveks, left for the coast.</p>

  <p>In the imperial tent of scarlet silk, decked with cloth-of-gold insignia
  and edged with golden fringe, Grandon opened his eyes as the first faint
  dawnlight appeared, for he had planned an early morning fishing-trip. He
  arose and dressed silently, so as not to disturb the slumber of his bride,
  but she heard the slight clank of his sword as he was about to step through
  the doorway, and wakened.</p>

  <p>"Bob."</p>

  <p>He turned as she softly pronounced the name by which he had been known to
  his friends on Earth, the name he had taught her to call him and which he
  loved to hear her say with her quaint, Reabonian accent.</p>

  <p>With three steps he was at her bedside. She smiled up at him the pink and
  white oval of her face framed in the wealth of golden ringlets that all but
  concealed her silken pillow. Then she held up both arms.</p>

  <p>"Would you leave without kissing me good-bye?" she asked
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>Contritely, he knelt beside the bed and took her in his arms.</p>

  <p>"I did not wish to disturb your morning sleep my dear," he said, and
  added: "I was only going out for a little while&mdash;to have a try at a
  killer-norgal. I'm told they bite best at daybreak."</p>

  <p>She took his face between her palms, drew it down to hers, and their lips
  met.</p>

  <p>"Never leave me," she said, "without first kissing me good-bye. Who knows
  how long any separation may be? Even though we may expect to be parted for
  but a few moments, the hand of Providence may intervene and separate us for a
  long time&mdash;perhaps for eternity."</p>

  <p>He buried his face in the soft curve of her neck as she ran her fingers
  through his black curls. Nor did he dream, as he held her thus for a few
  moments, how soon the dire prophecy in her words was to be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>"Ill be back in a jiffy," he said, as he stood erect a few moments
  later.</p>

  <p>She watched him, love and pride in her eyes, as he strode through the
  door. Handsome, strong, and gentle, he was an emperor&mdash;every inch of
  him.</p>

  <p>Throwing a shimmering wrap of scarlet material around her, she went to the
  door of her tent to watch him depart. Two guards saluted stiffly as she
  appeared. They were members of a company of Grandon's crack troops, the
  Fighting Traveks from Uxpo. Each was armed with a tork, a rapid fire weapon
  that shot needle-like glass projectiles, a scarbo a cutting and thrusting
  weapon with a basket hilt and a blade curved like that of a scimitar, and a
  long-bladed spear.</p>

  <p>Vernia watched him for a few moments as he stood beside his small fishing-
  boat in earnest conversation with Huba, mojak or captain of the company of
  Traveks who were guarding the camp. Six men stood on each side of the little
  craft, holding it's nose into the breakers. In the prow of the boat was
  Kantar the Gunner, carefully shielding his mattork&mdash;a weapon resembling
  a tork, but of considerably heavier caliber and longer range, and mounted on
  a tripod &mdash;from the spray that was breaking over the bow, by holding a
  waterproof silk cover over it.</p>

  <p>The rest of the crew consisted of six oarsmen, a man who had charge of the
  sail, and another who held the tiller.</p>

  <p>Having finished his conversation with Huba, Grandon leaped into the craft
  and the twelve men who were standing in the water launched her. When they
  reached water up to their necks, they let go, and the rowers plied their oars
  vigorously. Presently the sail went up, and the little boat tacked into the
  breeze which was just lively enough to stir the fog that hung low over the
  surface of the Azpok.</p>

  <p>The princess watched the boat until the mists had swallowed it up, then
  turned and re-entered her tent. But scarcely, it seemed, had she crept once
  more beneath her warm covers, and closed her eyes in sleep, before there
  sounded outside the crack of a mattork, the shouts of men, and the clank of
  weapons, followed by a fusillade of shots that told her the camp was being
  attacked by a considerable body of armed men.</p>

  <p>Jumping out of bed, Vernia called to the guard outside.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked. "What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Pirates, Your Majesty!" replied the guard excitedly. "We are attacked by
  the raiders of the coast."</p>

  <p>She dressed as swiftly as possible, buckling the jeweled belt which held
  her small tork and scarbo around her slender waist. Meanwhile, the sounds of
  fighting drew closer and closer to the scarlet tent.</p>

  <p>As soon as she was dressed, Vernia drew her scarbo and stepped fearlessly
  from the tent. Descended from a thousand fighting Torrogos, or Emperors, of
  Reabon, she was fully as brave as her mighty husband, even though she lacked
  his strength and skill in swordsmanship. With flashing eyes she surveyed the
  scene before her. Tugging at their anchors, less than a quarter of a mile
  from land, were a score of vessels which she instantly recognized from
  pictures she had seen as the ships of the dreaded yellow pirates, the scourge
  of the Azpok Ocean. Their peculiar sails branching out on either side of the
  mast like the wings of bats instantly identified them. And coming rapidly
  shoreward were no less than fifty boats loaded with armed men, each mounting
  a mattork in the bow. But this was not all, for converging on the camp from
  both sides and the rear was an immense horde of yelling, shooting pirates.
  Already, more than a third of the Fighting Traveks had fallen, and the tork
  and mattork fire from all directions was rapidly decimating the ranks of
  those who remained.</p>

  <p>A dozen of the boats were sent down by Huba's mattork gunners before the
  landing-party reached the shore. As their prows grounded, the remaining
  pirates leaped out and charged the camp, and it was the signal for a general
  advance from all directions.</p>

  <p>The camp had been guarded by two hundred men, but by the time of the
  charge, a scant forty remained. They formed a hollow square around the
  Princess, and met the shock of the attack with a resistance worthy of the
  traditions of the Fighting Traveks, though it was obvious from the beginning
  that there could be but one outcome.</p>

  <p>In the hand-to-hand fighting that followed there was no report of tork or
  mattork&mdash;only the clash of blades, the war-cries of the fighters, the
  groans of the wounded, and the shrieks of the dying. Vernia and Huba fought
  bravely with the others, time and again leaping into the gaps left by fallen
  men until the line could be closed. But they were waging a hopeless fight,
  and presently only the Princess and the mojak were left, fighting back to
  back. The latter, battling three adversaries at once, was suddenly cut down
  by a blow from one of the pirates, and Vernia was left alone. When a man
  leaped in from behind, pinioning her arms, her weapons were quickly taken
  from her.</p>

  <p>The looting of the camp was already in progress as she was dragged kicking
  and struggling, into one of the pirate boats. Everything in the camp was
  seized in the way of booty except the bodies of the fallen Traveks, and even
  these were stripped of their clothing, weapons, and accouterments. The
  pirates also took with them all of their own dead and wounded.</p>

  <p>Rowed to the largest of the looters' vessels, Vernia was carried aboard
  and taken before an officer whose insignia proclaimed him romojak, or
  commander, of the fleet. Like most of the members of his race, he was short,
  scarcely taller than the Princess herself, but with an exceptionally long
  body and arms. His round, yellow face was seamed and wrinkled, and his
  equally round eyes, wide open and staring, were without irises. The pupils
  were perpendicular slits that opened and closed like those of felines. His
  short nose resembled the tip of a pig's snout, and there were no teeth in the
  chinless mouth beneath it, from the corners of which drooled saliva reddened
  by the juice of the kerra, the spores of a narcotic, fungoid growth chewed
  almost incessantly by the yellow pirates. Nor was there a sign of beard,
  eyebrows, or hair on the face or head, the skin of his body being covered
  with a greasy exudation, evidently nature's protection for these totally
  hairless people. Judged by the standards of his hairless, toothless race, he
  was probably not unhandsome. But to Vernia, facing him as his prisoner, he
  was a monstrosity.</p>

  <p>"I presume you are the Torroga of Reabon," he said in Patoa, with the
  peculiar pronunciation that a lack of teeth induces.</p>

  <p>"You have already presumed too much," replied Vernia, spiritedly. "For
  this day's work, I can promise you the annihilation of the Yellow
  Pirates."</p>

  <p>The gums of the romojak showed in a toothless grin. He expectorated a red
  stream of kerra juice, then turned to a short, bow-legged, pot-bellied mojak
  who stood beside him.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear that, San Thoy?" he mouthed sneeringly. "I, Thid Yet, Romojak
  of the navies of Huitsen, have presumed too much!"</p>

  <p>The mojak duplicated his kerra-stained grin.</p>

  <p>"The Huitsenni never presume too much," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Well said, San Thoy," approved the romojak. Then he addressed Vernia once
  more. "Your Majesty, the Huitsenni presume often, but never too much. Have
  they ever been beaten in battle? Has one of them ever been led to your court,
  a prisoner? Have their cities ever been found by pursuing battle fleets? Your
  Majesty is aware that history can answer but one word to these questions, and
  that word is: `No'."</p>

  <p>"There is only one reason why it must be so answered," replied Vernia.
  "Cowardice. You never attack unless your overwhelming numbers assure you of
  victory. For this reason you never lose battles or prisoners. Your cities
  have not been found because you are adepts at flight from an enemy. In this
  there is nothing of which to be proud."</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty calls it `cowardice'," said Thid Yet, "but we of the
  Huitsenni have a better word. We call it `cleverness'. However, I am not here
  to bandy words with you, nor dispute terms. You are my prisoner, captured not
  for myself, but for another. If you are reasonably docile and do not attempt
  to escape, you will be treated with gentleness and courtesy. If not&mdash;
  whatever misfortune befalls will be upon your own head." He turned to the
  greasy, pot-bellied mojak beside him. "Take her to her cabin, San Thoy."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch02"
     name="ch02">2.</a> &mdash; GRANDON PURSUES</h2>

  <p class="first">Far out into the morning mists that shrouded the surface of
  the blue-gray Azpok, Grandon sailed in search of the largest and most
  ferocious of all Zorovian game fish&mdash;the killer-norgal. Fishing for the
  norgal was royal sport indeed, and fraught with great danger to the
  fisherman. Hunting a full-grown man-eating tiger with a lariat could be no
  more dangerous, and as often as not, the man who lacked skill fell a prey to
  the fish.</p>

  <p>Grandon had never seen a killer-norgal, and so when he felt a sharp tug at
  his trolling-line, and a magnificent specimen broke water, leaping high in
  the air and shaking its head to dislodge the hook, he had one of the greatest
  thrills that had ever come to him, intrepid adventurer though he was. Its
  body, covered with glistening blue scales and bristling with sharp spines,
  was about twenty-five feet in length. Its enormous jaws, when distended,
  revealed row upon row of sharp, back-curved teeth in a maw large enough to
  take in a dozen men at a single snap.</p>

  <p>Kantar the Gunner jerked the oily cover from his mattork, but before be
  could bring it to bear on the huge fish, it dived out of sight.</p>

  <p>Grandon kept a taut line on his quarry while the crew skillfully
  maneuvered the little craft to follow its eccentric and exceedingly swift
  motions as it dragged the boat farther and farther out to sea. After more
  than an hour of this, the struggles of the monster became slower, indicating
  that it was beginning to tire. During this time, it did not once expose
  itself to the deadly aim of the watchful Kantar.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, without warning, the line slackened, and although Grandon reeled
  in with all his might, he was unable to pull it taut. He thought at first
  that the fish had become unhooked, but the flash of a dorsal fin, for a
  moment visible above the waves and coming swiftly towards the boat, showed
  him the true situation. Kantar's mattork spoke, and the fin disappeared, but
  it was not evident whether he had registered a hit.</p>

  <p>One of the older sailors, an experienced norgal fisherman, said:</p>

  <p>"Beware, Majesty. The killer is about to strike."</p>

  <p>Dropping his tackle, Grandon seized an eighteen foot lance which lay along
  the gunwale beside him, and poised it expectantly. He had not long to wait,
  for the enormous jaws suddenly emerged from the water not ten feet from him.
  He plunged the keen point down the cavernous maw, and Kantar's mattork spoke
  again and again, while the mighty jaws ground the thick shaft of tough serali
  wood into splinters. Hurling the useless butt from him, Grandon whipped out
  his sword, but he sheathed it again as the great spiny body turned over and
  floated belly up after a few convulsive flops. The blood which poured out
  through one of the gills showed that the lance point had found the heart, and
  several round holes through the head attested the marksmanship of Kantar.</p>

  <p>The sailors were making the prize fast, chattering and laughing all the
  while, when the keen-eared Kantar suddenly cried: "Listen, I hear
  shooting!"</p>

  <p>Every voice was instantly hushed, and there came, distinctly now, the
  sounds of a terrific bombardment from the north.</p>

  <p>"The camp is attacked," cried an old sailor.</p>

  <p>"To the oars," ordered Grandon, "and crowd all the sail on at once. Cut
  that fish loose. We must get there as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>The huge, spiny carcass was cast adrift, and sails and oars were speedily
  put into use. Yet, it seemed to Grandon that the swift little boat, which
  fairly leaped over the waves under this double propulsion moved with
  snail-like slowness.</p>

  <p>Before they had gotten half-way back to camp, the sounds of firing ceased,
  and Grandon, goaded by horrible fears for Vernia's safety, fumed and fretted
  at the inability to make better speed or see through the mists that made
  about two hundred yards the limit of visibility.</p>

  <p>But when the prow of the little boat grounded on the beach, and leaping
  out, Grandon discovered the bloody shambles that had been his camp, strewn
  with the naked bodies of his Traveks his grief and anger knew no bounds.</p>

  <p>"All dead," he said to Kantar, who stood respectfully beside him. "My
  noble Traveks slaughtered, and Vernia stolen. Who can have done this horrid
  deed? And what motive? Reabon is at peace with all nations. The camp was not
  rich in loot."</p>

  <p>"There is Zanaloth of Mernerum," replied Kantar. "You have severed
  diplomatic relations with him. Perhaps this is his answer."</p>

  <p>"If Zanaloth has done this," said Grandon, "he shall have war, and that
  speedily&mdash;such a war as this planet has never seen. I will wipe Mernerum
  off the face of the globe, nor will Zanaloth live long to gloat over his evil
  deeds. But it cannot be Zanaloth. The fact that he once affronted the
  Princess of Reabon when she passed through his country made it imperative
  that I sever diplomatic relations until full apology had been made. I might
  have declared war, but did not. Zanaloth should be thankful for this, as the
  armies of Reabon could crush a dozen Mernerums."</p>

  <p>Walking among his dead Traveks and sorrowfully murmuring the names of
  those he recognized, Grandon presently found his mojak.</p>

  <p>"My faithful friend," he said, sadly. "Huba, comrade of many a battle and
  bivouac." He knelt and laid his hand on the blood-smeared brow of the young
  officer. "Why, his head is warm!" he exclaimed. "Perhaps a spark of life
  remains! Fetch water and a flask of kova, quickly, Kantar."</p>

  <p>The gunner sped away to the boat from which he brought back a flask of the
  aromatic and stimulating kova from the provision basket and a bailing-scoop
  of sea-water.</p>

  <p>There was a huge gash in the fallen mojak's scalp, and the entire upper
  part of his face was covered with blood. With hands as gentle as those of a
  woman, Grandon bathed away the blood. Then, as the eyelids of his friend
  flickered, he raised the head and held the flask of kova to the mouth,
  forcing a small quantity of the liquid between the clenched teeth.</p>

  <p>Huba swallowed convulsively, opened his eyes, and looked at Grandon with
  dull wonder in his gaze.</p>

  <p>"You, Majesty!" he said weakly. "I thought I had been taken to the bosom
  of Thorth."</p>

  <p>"You came near it," replied Grandon, "but the scarbo cut was a glancing
  one. Where is my wife?"</p>

  <p>"The cursed Huitsenni attacked the camp," answered Huba. "My valiant
  Traveks fought well, but were cut down to the last man. Her Majesty fought
  with us. When all had been killed around us, she and I fought the greasy
  yellow horde, back to back. Then I was cut down, and knew no more. What a
  brave little thing she is!" He sank back, exhausted.</p>

  <p>"Then those yellow fiends have her," said Grandon. "Their spies have
  worked swiftly it seems, and they were swift at reprisal. Where have they
  taken her? How can I follow?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," replied Huba, "nor do I believe anyone does, other than
  the pirates themselves. They raid the coasts or attack merchant or fishing
  ships, then disappear. As they always attack with immensely superior forces,
  they are never defeated. They always carry away their own dead and wounded,
  and take care that none of their victims are left alive to tell of their
  dastardly work. But a few times, men who have been left for dead have
  revived, even as I was revived, and thus some description of them and their
  deeds has, from time to time, reached civilization. Fleets of the great
  nations have scoured the seas, looking for their ships and their strongholds,
  but have found neither. Like the winds of heaven, no one knows whence they
  come or where they go."</p>

  <p>"I'll find Vernia if I have to search every inch of this planet," said
  Grandon.</p>

  <p>"One thing only I recall, which may be of assistance, Majesty," said Huba.
  "Unfortunately I was unable to see the pirates leave, but every intended
  victim who has ever escaped them has reported that they sail southward."</p>

  <p>Grandon turned to the mojo of the boat crew.</p>

  <p>"Remove all but two pairs of oars," he said, "and prepare to push off. I
  will sail southward. One man, only, will I take with me. Who would be the
  man?"</p>

  <p>From the wounded Huba to the last of the seamen, all volunteered. After
  some deliberation, Grandon selected Kantar the Gunner as his companion.</p>

  <p>"You will be needed in Reabon," he told Huba. "Go at once to the capital.
  Tell Vordeen to mobilize the army and double the coast guard and the guard on
  the Mernerum border. Tell him, also, to divide our war fleet into such sized
  squadrons as he deems advisable and assign patrol zones to each squadron so
  that no part of the Azpok Ocean nor any of its shore line will be left
  unsearched. Have these patrol fleets search every ship encountered, except
  those of Tyrhana, Adonijar and Olba. Farewell."</p>

  <p>The seamen echoed Huba's cry of: "Farewell, Majesty," as Grandon leaped
  into the boat and seized the tiller. Kantar, already at the oars, struck out
  savagely as soon as the men who shoved them off had got beyond their depth,
  and a little later, the two raised the sail and tacked into the breeze, which
  had grown considerably stronger. The fog, too, was rising so that visibility
  became almost normal.</p>

  <p>For most of the morning they zig-zagged southward; but presently the wind
  veered around, eliminating the necessity for tacking, and greatly
  accelerating their progress.</p>

  <p>At noon each took a turn at the tiller, while the other ate his frugal
  lunch of dried mushrooms and smoked frella meat washed down with drafts of
  kova.</p>

  <p>Kantar had just finished his lunch, and was closing the watertight
  container when with an exclamation of surprise, he suddenly leaned over the
  gunwale and scooped something from the surface of the water with his hand. It
  was an empty half of a spore pod, red inside and black outside.</p>

  <p>"What have you there?" asked Grandon.</p>

  <p>"A kerra pod," replied the gunner.</p>

  <p>"And what, pray, is that?"</p>

  <p>"The kerra, Majesty," replied the gunner, "is chewed almost universally by
  the toothless yellow pirates. Where there are kerra spore pods, one may be
  sure the Huitsenni have been. It is said that they are never willingly
  without a supply of this habit-forming narcotic, which they constantly mumble
  except when eating or sleeping. I think from the finding of this kerra pod,
  that we are on the right trail&mdash;that the Huitsenni have passed this way
  not so long ago."</p>

  <p>"And do you think there is a possibility of our overtaking them
  today?"</p>

  <p>"I believe, Sire, that there is. This little boat is one of the fleetest
  on the Azpok&mdash;and much swifter than the large ships of war used by the
  pirates in their raids. They had not long been away from camp when we
  arrived, so I look for their appearance on the horizon some time this
  afternoon if they consistently follow their southward course."</p>

  <p>That afternoon, Grandon constantly strained his eyes toward the south, but
  saw only such marine monsters of the Azpok as rose to the top from time to
  time, or flew above the surface. There was a great variety of web-winged
  reptiles of diverse shapes and colors, some as small as sea-gulls, and other
  kinds and species up to the enormous ormf, whose wingspread was fully fifty
  feet from tip to tip, and whose great, saw-toothed beak with a pelican-like
  pouch beneath it was large enough to take in a full-grown man at a single
  snap. There was also a great profusion of large, white birds with hooked
  bills and red-tipped wings which, like the flying reptiles, dipped to the
  surface of the water from time to time for their prey, or dived beneath it,
  emerging therefrom with squirming, wriggling fish or other marine inhabitants
  in their beaks.</p>

  <p>One huge ormf circled above the little craft for several hours, and Kantar
  prepared to use his mattork in case of attack. But the monster evidently
  decided that the creatures in the boat were too dangerous for it to assail,
  and soared lazily away.</p>

  <p>Although they did not sight the ships of the pirates that afternoon,
  Grandon was encouraged by seeing, from time to time, empty kerra pods on the
  water, which indicated that they were on the right trail.</p>

  <p>"The ships of the accursed Huitsenni," said Kantar as darkness fell, "must
  be swifter than I thought, or we should have sighted them before this."</p>

  <p>Scarcely had he spoken when a sparkle of dancing lights appeared just
  above the southern horizon.</p>

  <p>"I see lights to the south," said Grandon. "What are they?"</p>

  <p>"The ships of Huitsen," replied Kantar, excitedly. "Those are their mast
  lights. We will overtake them shortly, now."</p>

  <p>"And can you tell which is the flagship?" asked Grandon. "It will probably
  be on the ship of the leader that Her Majesty is confined."</p>

  <p>"I will be able to tell which is the flagship when we get closer," replied
  Kantar, "by her lights."</p>

  <p>"Good. As soon as you can do so, steer for the flagship. Make no noise,
  and perhaps we can get aboard without being seen. If we can do
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His speech was suddenly interrupted by a terrific shock, as the little
  boat, traveling through the inky darkness in which naught was visible except
  the dancing mast lights of the pirates, suddenly rammed a huge, solid object,
  throwing both men into the bottom of the boat.</p>

  <p>The impact was followed by a terrific roar, and the front end of the
  fishing boat was lifted out of the water as easily as if it had been a
  floating chip, while Grandon and Kantar unable to see what they had struck,
  clung to such solid objects as they could grasp and breathlessly awaited the
  next move of the unseen monster.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch03"
     name="ch03">3.</a> &mdash; THE CUNNING OF SAN THOY</h2>

  <p class="first">As San Thoy led Vernia to the cabin which had been assigned
  to her, his great round eyes, with their cat-like pupils, appraised her in a
  manner which made her fearful.</p>

  <p>"Beauteous white princess," he said, when they were out of earshot of Thid
  Yet and the group of pirates surrounding him, "you are surrounded by enemies,
  yet San Thoy would be your friend."</p>

  <p>Weighing his look and words for a moment, Vernia asked:</p>

  <p>"Just what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>The slit pupils of his eyes narrowed, and this did not escape the
  observation of the Princess as he replied:</p>

  <p>"I mean what I say, Majesty, in all sincerity. For the great respect and
  admiration I bear his Majesty, your husband, I would befriend you."</p>

  <p>"You know my husband?"</p>

  <p>"Only through the echoes of his mighty exploits, which have penetrated
  even to Huitsen," he replied. "But one brave man admires another, and feels a
  certain kinship with him. For his sake as well as for your own, I would be of
  assistance to you."</p>

  <p>"In what way?"</p>

  <p>"If you will give me your full trust and co-operation, I can help you to
  escape. If not, you will shortly be sold into slavery to a human monster
  whose mistreatment of the women who fall into his lascivious clutches has
  made him notorious throughout the length and breadth of Zorovia."</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"I am under orders not to divulge his name, but we of the Huitsenni were
  offered an enormous sum in treasure and slaves for your safe delivery to him.
  It was for this reason and no other that our Rogo decided to brave the anger
  of that mighty fighter, your husband, and send a fleet to capture you at the
  wild and lonely spot where the spies of this licentious potentate had
  ascertained that you were but indifferently guarded."</p>

  <p>"It seems strange that this dissolute monarch, whose name I believe I can
  guess, did not send his own ruffians instead of employing the Huitsenni,"
  said Vernia.</p>

  <p>"He feared the power of Reabon," replied San Thoy. "Any evidence which his
  own men might have left as to their presence on Reabonian soil would have led
  to war and the inevitable dissolution of his empire. For who can stand
  against the mighty hosts of Reabon? But who could criticize his perfectly
  legal action were he to buy a beautiful white slave-girl from the Huitsenni?
  And even though she should maintain that she were the Torroga of Reabon, what
  weight has the word of a slave? A thousand beautiful slave-girls might make
  the same assertion for their own advantage and advancement, and he would be
  legally privileged to disbelieve them. The man who ordered your capture,
  Majesty, is as clever as he is lecherous."</p>

  <p>Vernia, who was familiar with the international laws of Venus, knew full
  well that no man could be held responsible under those laws for purchasing a
  slave. She knew, also, that it would be difficult to establish the fact in an
  international court that he was cognizant of the identity of that slave,
  whose word would have no legal weight, and could be doubted by him with
  impunity.</p>

  <p>"Just what," she asked, "is your price?"</p>

  <p>"My price is but a trifle," he responded. "In fact, it is scarcely worth
  mentioning."</p>

  <p>"Name it."</p>

  <p>"I should prefer to rescue you first."</p>

  <p>They were standing before the door to the cabin to which he had led her,
  and which he had not yet unlocked. Suddenly both saw Thid Yet, Romojak of the
  fleet rounding a curve in the deck and coming toward them.</p>

  <p>Quickly unlocking the door, San Thoy said:</p>

  <p>"The Romojak comes. Go into your cabin, and I will call later."</p>

  <p>Vernia stepped into a tiny cabin which contained a sleeping shelf that
  projected from the wall like the nest of a cave swallow, a small table, and a
  stool, both fastened to the floor. A ewer and a small bowl for washing were
  set in a niche in the wall.</p>

  <p>As the door closed and the lock clicked behind her, she heard the
  approaching Thid Yet say:</p>

  <p>"By what devious route did you take the prisoner to her cabin, San Thoy,
  that she but entered it?"</p>

  <p>"I stood and talked to her for a moment, to cheer her," replied San Thoy
  humbly.</p>

  <p>"To cheer her? Hal So this little beauty has aroused your libidinous
  fancy! But it was to be expected. Understand me, once and for all, San Thoy.
  This is no common slave-girl. Her ransom is the price of a mighty empire, and
  she must be delivered unharmed. Let me but suspect you, and you shall die
  &mdash;very slowly and very painfully&mdash;mojak though you be."</p>

  <p>"You misapprehend, Excellency," protested San Thoy. "Because I have spent
  my hard earned treasure for a few slaves in the past, I pray you misjudge not
  my intentions toward this one. I was moved to pity for her, that was
  all."</p>

  <p>"You pity? Pah! Into your cabin with you, and lay our course that we may
  reach Huitsen as soon as possible. And do not forget my warning."</p>

  <p>A moment later, Vernia heard the door of the cabin which was next to hers,
  slam with unnecessary violence, and after laving her face and hands with
  scented water from the ewer, she lay down on her sleeping-shelf to rest, and
  to overcome the giddiness which the rocking of the ship was beginning to
  induce. But bad as were the qualms of seasickness, they were as nothing as
  compared to her mental anguish, for she felt that only a miracle could save
  her. Although she had never been deceived by San Thoy's protestations of
  friendship, she had been half ready to believe that an offer of treasure
  might win his help. But the words of the Romojak had thoroughly dissipated
  even that slim hope.</p>

  <p>Late that afternoon, San Thoy himself brought her food and a bowl of kova.
  Because of her sea-sickness she could not eat the food, but she drank the
  hot, steaming kova. Shortly thereafter, she began to feel unaccountably
  drowsy, and soon fell into a deep sleep.</p>

  <p>When she awakened, Vernia felt the craft beneath her lurching and pitching
  violently. She put out a hand for the light switch, but there was none.
  Instead, her hand encountered the wet gunwale of a small boat, in the bottom
  of which she was lying. She sat up, and the salt spray sprinkled her face.
  Far away, she saw a number of mast lights twinkling in the darkness. A short
  bulky figure loomed up before her.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she asked in terror. "Where are you taking me?"</p>

  <p>"Have no fear, Majesty" mouthed the figure. "It is San Thoy that has
  rescued you."</p>

  <p>"You drugged me."</p>

  <p>"For your own sake, Majesty. You might otherwise have made an outcry when
  I came to carry you off, thus arousing the ship and defeating your
  rescue."</p>

  <p>"And you will take me back to Reabon at once?"</p>

  <p>"In the morning. Tonight we must seek shelter. The surface of the Azpok
  swarms with fierce and mighty monsters, which by day seek their dark lairs in
  the ocean's depths. Night travel in a small boat is extremely dangerous.
  Hark! I hear the breakers now. The island is not far off."</p>

  <p>Steering entirely by the sounds that came to him&mdash;for nothing was
  visible in the pitchy blackness&mdash;San Thoy brought the little sailboat
  through booming breakers which evidently covered a bar or sunken reef, and
  into comparatively calm water. It was not long after that the keel rasped on
  a gravelly shore.</p>

  <p>Leaping into the shallow water, the pirate dragged the boat high up on the
  beach. Then he furled the sail, and taking Vernia by the hand said:</p>

  <p>"Come. I will take you to a place where you may spend the night safely. In
  the morning, I will call for you and take you to Reabon."</p>

  <p>"You will be well rewarded," replied Vernia. "I will double the ransom
  which was offered for me and add to it a thousand kantols of land, and purple
  of a nobleman for life."</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty is generous," said San Thoy, "but then I have cut myself off
  from my own people, property, and position, in order to effect your
  rescue."</p>

  <p>He led her up a narrow winding path, where leaves, dripping with the night
  dew, brushed her face and body. Presently they came to a small clearing.</p>

  <p>San Thoy fumbled with a latch for a moment, and then opened a door. He
  released Vernia's hand, and struck a light with the small flame maker which
  he carried. When he had lighted a torch that hung from a bracket on the wall,
  Vernia saw that they were in a tiny cabin which contained a sleeping shelf, a
  crude table, three chairs, some utensils, and a place for cooking beside
  which fuel was piled.</p>

  <p>"I will light the fire for you, that you may dry your clothing," said San
  Thoy. "Then I will brew kova."</p>

  <p>Vernia seated herself on one of the chairs, and watched the broad, greasy
  back of the pirate as he squatted before the fire. When he had it blazing
  brightly, he took a kettle and went outside for water. Returning, he dropped
  in some kova roots which he found on a shelf beside the fireplace, and soon
  had it boiling. As Vernia watched, she wondered if his intentions were as
  magnanimous as he pretended, or if he were as perfidious as the words of his
  commander implied. So far, his impassive features had betrayed nothing. Only
  time would tell.</p>

  <p>Presently, he placed a chair before the fire for her, that she might dry
  her clothes, and poured her a bowl of steaming kova. While she slowly sipped
  the hot, stimulating beverage, he tossed off bowl after bowl until the pot
  was empty and another had been set to brewing. She noticed that with each
  bowl, the slits in his round eyes became more bestial. San Thoy was
  drunk.</p>

  <p>When the second pot of kova was ready, the pirate offered to refill
  Vernia's bowl, but she declined. He leered a little as he refilled his own,
  and it was not long before the second had gone the way of the first. Then San
  Thoy extracted a kerra pod from his belt pouch, and, breaking it open,
  emptied the red contents into his toothless mouth.</p>

  <p>For a while he mumbled the drug, expectorating thin streams of scarlet
  juice into the fire from time to time, and muttering drunkenly to himself as
  they hissed among the hot embers.</p>

  <p>Presently he arose, and unclasping a belt which held his tork, scarbo, and
  knife, hung it on a peg on the wall. Then he stretched his arms and yawned
  hideously, the red juice trickling from the corners of his flabby mouth, and
  staining his greasy chin.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said thickly, "it is time to retire. May your humble servant
  assist you to disrobe?"</p>

  <p>With this he lurched unsteadily toward her.</p>

  <p>Panic stricken, Vernia jumped up and placed the chair between herself and
  the advancing pirate.</p>

  <p>"Back!" she said. "Go back! Don't you dare touch me!"</p>

  <p>"There, there," he said, still advancing. "Do not be frightened. I will
  not hurt you."</p>

  <p>Only the chair and two feet of space separated them now. Suddenly seizing
  the chair, he hurled it to one side and flung out both arms to grasp her. She
  leaped back, and his arms embraced empty air. But now she was cornered. She
  looked longingly at the weapons hanging on the peg, but between her and them
  was San Thoy.</p>

  <p>Half crouching, arms spread, he advanced toward her. Suddenly he sprang
  like a beast of prey. Then like crushing bands of steel his greasy arms
  encircled her. His grinning, lecherous features were close to hers, leering
  down at her.</p>

  <p>"Little she-marmelot!" he said. "Think you that you can resist San Thoy,
  who has subdued a thousand slave-girls?"</p>

  <p>She struggled desperately, striking and clawing at the bestial face,
  squirming and kicking with all her strength, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>With a laugh of exultation, he picked her up, and carrying her to the
  sleeping shelf, flung her down upon it.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch04"
     name="ch04">4.</a> &mdash; A TREACHEROUS SHOAL</h2>

  <p class="first">The monster with which Grandon's fishing boat had collided
  in the darkness was evidently not of the belligerent type, for it submerged,
  nearly swamping them, before they attained an even keel.</p>

  <p>But they were not yet out of danger. Kantar the Gunner suddenly called to
  Grandon that the boat had sprung a leak as a result of the collision, and was
  filling rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Then steer for the ship in the center of the squadron, and let us hope
  that it's the flagship," said Grandon. "I'll row and bail. It's our only
  chance."</p>

  <p>With the strong strokes of Grandon assisting the sail of the swift little
  vessel, they were able to gain rapidly on the ship which was at the apex of
  the wedge-shaped squadron. As they drew near it, Kantar called:</p>

  <p>"It is the flagship, Majesty."</p>

  <p>"Good. Preserve absolute silence from now on," replied Grandon. "If
  possible, we must get aboard her without being detected."</p>

  <p>Presently they came close enough to hear the sounds of conversation and
  people moving about. Yet, their boat went unnoticed because the mast lights
  of the flagship cast little illumination in their direction. The powerful
  searchlight beams of the ship were directed ahead, as were those of the ships
  which flanked it on either side.</p>

  <p>And they came up under the stern of the pirate vessel without attracting
  attention. By this time their boat was half-filled with water, and despite
  Grandon's bailing was likely to sink at any moment.</p>

  <p>Hanging from two pulleys high above them were the two chains with which
  the rudder was turned from the steersman's cabin in the front of the
  ship.</p>

  <p>"You climb one chain," directed Grandon, "while I go up the other. We are
  of nearly the same weight, so if we climb at the same time each will
  counterbalance the other, and the steersman may not notice anything
  amiss."</p>

  <p>Leaping out onto the rudder, Grandon seized the chain on the side opposite
  them. At the same moment, Kantar grasped the chain next to the boat, and the
  two went up, hand over hand. Just as Kantar left the little boat, the
  gunwales went under, and before they had gotten half-way up the chains her
  masthead disappeared from view. They had reached the flagship just in
  time.</p>

  <p>Together the two men went over the railing, each drawing his scarbo as he
  did so. A single watchman stood between them, but before he had time even to
  touch a weapon, a thrust from one side and a cut from the other, laid him
  low.</p>

  <p>The two heaved the body overboard.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Grandon grimly, "we'll search the ship."</p>

  <p>But scarcely had the words left his mouth when there was a cry from the
  masthead.</p>

  <p>"Enemies on board! Two tall strangers on the after deck. They have slain
  the guard."</p>

  <p>The lookout leveled his tork at them, and a bullet splintered the deck
  between them. He continued to fire, but fortunately the light was not good.
  The two men quickly found a temporary refuge by dodging into an empty rear
  cabin.</p>

  <p>"This is a trap," said Grandon. "We can't remain here."</p>

  <p>"And yet it would make a good place to take a stand," replied Kantar.</p>

  <p>But the decision was not left to them, for the door suddenly burst open,
  and a yellow pirate leaped in, yelling like a demon. In one hand he grasped a
  long, heavy knife, and in the other a scarbo which he sought to use.</p>

  <p>Grandon quickly silenced him with a thrust to the throat, but his place
  was immediately taken by two more. Others pressed behind, eager for a chance
  at the intruders.</p>

  <p>Grandon and Kantar, however, were a pair difficult to best with blades of
  any sort, and it was not long before the floor in front of them was piled
  high with bodies of their foes. But suddenly a voice called an order from
  without, and the men, in the thick of the battle, turned and withdrew without
  a sound, leaving the two alone in the room.</p>

  <p>As Kantar turned with a questioning look in his eyes, Grandon saw a small
  glass globe hurled into the room. Crashing against the wall behind them, it
  shattered into a thousand tiny fragments. In a moment, Grandon was conscious
  of an intensely acrid odor. The room whirled. Kantar slid to the floor. The
  room whirled. Then blackness.</p>

  <p>The effects of the gas in the tiny globe were evidently but momentary, for
  when Grandon once more recovered his senses he was being lifted from the
  cabin floor by two pirates. The dead bodies of their yellow opponents had
  been removed, and Kantar was being led out of the room, without his weapons,
  and with his hands tied behind his back. Grandon moved his arms, and found
  them securely fastened.</p>

  <p>An officer in the uniform of a mojak ordered them brought forward and into
  a large cabin at the front of the ship. An officer whose uniform proclaimed
  him Romojak of the fleet was seated at a table, sipping kova.</p>

  <p>"Whom have we here, San Thoy?" asked the Romojak, as the two prisoners
  were brought before him. "It appears that we have captured a royal prisoner,
  if the taller one rightfully wears the scarlet."</p>

  <p>"He does, Excellency," replied San Thoy, "for I recognize him from his
  description as Grandon of Terra, Torrogo of Reabon."</p>

  <p>"Small wonder, then, that our warriors were mowed down like frella grass
  at harvest," said the Romojak. "Few men can face him with a scarbo and live!"
  He arose and bowed to Grandon. "I am honored, Your Majesty," he said, "by
  your unexpected visit to my humble ship. Now that you are here, I trust that
  you and your warrior will remain as our guests."</p>

  <p>"Who are you, you yellow knave?" demanded Grandon, "and what have you done
  with the Torroga of Reabon?"</p>

  <p>The Romojak returned his haughty look.</p>

  <p>"I am Thid Yet, Romojak of the Fleets of Huitsen," he answered with
  exaggerated deference, "and Your Imperial Majesty, of the Torroga of Reabon,
  I know absolutely nothing. If you seek her here, you have been misinformed as
  to her whereabouts."</p>

  <p>"I see that you are as skilled in the art of lying as in that of
  abduction," said Grandon. "But listen to me. You Huitsenni have gone
  unpunished for many generations. You shall not escape this time. Whereas
  Huitsen is now an unsavory word, when the fleets of Reabon have done, it will
  be but a stinking memory&mdash;except on one condition."</p>

  <p>"Your threats do not impress me but," said Thid Yet, "I will inquire the
  condition out of courtesy.</p>

  <p>"That you immediately place my wife, my warrior, and myself safely back on
  Reabonian soil."</p>

  <p>"I can only repeat," said Thid Yet, "that I know nothing whatever of the
  whereabouts of your wife. As for placing you and your soldier safely back
  upon Reabonian soil, we shall be delighted to do this for you. This, however,
  would entail some expense and no slight danger to us, and as you came aboard
  our ship unbidden, we feel that it is only fair that we should be reimbursed
  to the slight extent of, say, a hundred thousand white slaves, young and
  strong, and a million keds of gold."</p>

  <p>"What! You asked the price of an empire to set us ashore," exclaimed
  Kantar, "and a hundred thousand slaves besides?"</p>

  <p>"One does not set a Torrogo of Reabon ashore every day," replied Thid Yet
  with a toothless grin.</p>

  <p>"Set my wife ashore with us, unharmed, and I will pay you two million keds
  of gold," said Grandon. "The second million is in lieu of the hundred
  thousand slaves, a commodity in which I do not care to traffic."</p>

  <p>Thid Yet grinned again.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I shall have to ask you to be our guests for an indefinite
  period of time. Show them to the guest chambers, San Thoy."</p>

  <p>Grandon and Kantar were hustled out of the cabin, and along the deck to a
  hatchway leading into the hold. Down this they were lowered like freight, and
  each was seized by a grinning yellow buccaneer.</p>

  <p>"To the guest chambers," ordered San Thoy, and strolled away.</p>

  <p>The two new guards hustled the prisoners along a dimly lighted passageway,
  threw them with their hands still bound behind them, into a small,
  evil-smelling room, and closed and bolted the door after them.</p>

  <p>Flung violently into the room, Grandon's head collided with one of the
  stalwart ribs which braced the ship's sides, dazing him momentarily. He was
  brought back to full consciousness by Kantar calling to him.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt Majesty?"</p>

  <p>"A bit dazed," replied Grandon, "but I'll be all right in a moment. And
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Only bruised a little."</p>

  <p>"Then come over here and let me see if I can loose your bonds. We must get
  out some way and search the ship."</p>

  <p>Soon the two men were seated on the damp, filthy floor, back to back, and
  Grandon was working desperately at the bonds which held Kantar's wrists.
  Opening the tight knots which the yellow sailors had tied would have been no
  easy task even with his eyes to guide him and his hands free. But he worked
  patiently, doggedly, until at length a knot was opened. Soon a second
  yielded, and Kantar, with an exclamation of relief, chafed his numbed wrists
  for a moment, then swiftly began the task of releasing Grandon's hands. This
  took less time, as the gunner could work with his hands in front of him.</p>

  <p>When Grandon had restored the circulation to his wrists, he tried the
  door. It was of thick planking, and bolted so tightly that he could not budge
  it, but the planks, after having been fastened together, had evidently shrunk
  a little, as there were narrow cracks between them and on each side between
  door and frame.</p>

  <p>Kantar examined the lock, and said:</p>

  <p>"If I only had a knife I could lift that bolt and open the door."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," replied Grandon, "we have no knife, nor have we anything
  which will answer for one. It is possible, however, that we can get the guard
  to open the door."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"By pretending that one of us is killing the other. Dead prisoners are of
  no use to the Huitsenni. Let us first make believe that we are quarreling.
  You will lie on the floor with your hands behind you as if they were still
  bound. First we will quarrel, then you will thump on the floor with your
  hands and shout that you are being kicked to death. Let us try it."</p>

  <p>Kantar accordingly took his place on the floor, while Grandon stood where
  he would be behind the door when it was opened, and looked out into the
  hallway. As soon as the guard approached, he raised his voice and began
  abusing Kantar with choice Patoan epithets, accusing him of having gotten him
  into the scrape, and threatening to kill him then and there.</p>

  <p>Kantar replied, apparently pleading for clemency, and Grandon saw the
  guard pause outside and listen with a broad grin on his face. But when Kantar
  began thumping on the floor with the palm of his hand and shouting that he
  was being killed, the expression on the guard's face grew serious, and he
  quickly opened the door.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had he stepped inside when Grandon sprang. Seizing him from
  behind with a strangle hold, he jerked the guard backward, shutting off his
  wind. At the same time, Kantar stood up and quietly deprived him of his
  weapons.</p>

  <p>"Close the door, Kantar, until we talk to this fellow," said Grandon.</p>

  <p>"Now," said the Earthman, when the gunner had complied, "we want to know
  where her Majesty of Reabon is imprisoned. If you go with us quietly and show
  us the place, you will live. If not, you will die. Nod your head if you
  agree."</p>

  <p>The guard, whose voice was completely shut off, nodded weakly, and Grandon
  loosened the hold on his throat, permitting him to breathe once more.</p>

  <p>"Give me the scarbo, Kantar," said Grandon, "and retain the tork and knife
  for yourself. Keep a good hold on the fellow's harness, and do not hesitate
  to use your knife if he makes one move to betray us."</p>

  <p>"In such an event I will use it with great pleasure, Majesty," said Kantar
  grimly.</p>

  <p>Carefully opening the door, Grandon peered out. There was no one in the
  hallway.</p>

  <p>"Where is the other guard?" he asked their captive.</p>

  <p>"He patrols the forward corridor, Majesty," replied the guard
  respectfully. "It is connected with this one by two smaller corridors that
  branch around the central hatchway. He does not come into this corridor
  except at my call."</p>

  <p>"Good. Then lead us to the Princess by the safest route. And remember, if
  we are discovered through fault of yours, you die."</p>

  <p>Thus admonished, the thoroughly cowed guard led them to a ladder which
  descended into the corridor from the side, and with Kantar gripping his
  harness with one hand and his keen knife with the other, softly ascended.
  They came on deck near the stern and quietly made their way forward, keeping
  in the shadow of the cabins in order not to be observed by the lookout at the
  masthead.</p>

  <p>They had covered about half the distance to the forward cabin for which
  they were headed, when Grandon suddenly noticed a short, thick-set individual
  who had apparently just emerged from one of the cabins, carrying a bundle in
  his arms and hurrying toward one of the four small boats slung on this side
  of the craft.</p>

  <p>After placing the bundle, which was nearly as long as himself, in the
  boat, the fellow, whom Grandon now recognized as San Thoy, climbed in himself
  and rapidly lowered the little craft to the water by means of the two ropes
  which passed through pulleys suspended on davits. He and his two companions
  flattened themselves against the cabin wall until the small boat had
  disappeared from view over the rail&mdash;then went forward once more.</p>

  <p>Presently their conductor stopped before a door and whispered:</p>

  <p>"This is her cabin."</p>

  <p>While Kantar watched their guide, Grandon tried the cabin door, and
  finding it unlocked, stepped inside. By the rays of the tiny overhead light
  which illuminated the little room, he could see at a glance that it was
  deserted. His brow clouded, and it would have gone ill with the yellow man
  who had led him to this cabin had he not noticed something on the floor which
  glinted in the light. He picked it up, and recognized it instantly as one of
  the jewels from Vernia's coiffure.</p>

  <p>Stepping out of the cabin once more, he seize the guard's shoulder in a
  grip of iron.</p>

  <p>"She is not here," he said, sternly, and raised his scarbo as if he were
  about to lay the fellow's head open.</p>

  <p>"Spare me, Majesty," implored the yellow man. "This was her cabin. I swear
  it."</p>

  <p>"Then how do you explain her absence: Speak quickly if you would
  live?"</p>

  <p>"I see it all, Majesty," said the guard suddenly. "We are too late!"</p>

  <p>"Too late? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty saw San Thoy with the bundle&mdash;San Thoy the debauched
  &mdash;who spends all his earnings for beautiful slave girls. He would dare
  much to possess the most beautiful woman of Zorovia."</p>

  <p>"Then we will follow San Thoy," said Grandon, "and you will go with us.
  Perhaps you can give us an idea where he has gone. To the nearest boat,
  Kantar, and use your tork if the lookout sees us."</p>

  <p>"He will not see us, Majesty," said the guard. "Of that I am sure, as San
  Thoy must have seen to it that he is either drugged or dead&mdash;probably
  the latter."</p>

  <p>True to the prediction of the yellow guard, there was no alarm from the
  masthead, nor from any other part of the ship as they lowered the boat to the
  water and cast off. It was equipped with a small sail, which they raised as
  soon as the fleet was far enough away to make it improbable that it would be
  observed.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Grandon, "which way do you think San Thoy sailed?"</p>

  <p>"I can not be sure," replied the guard, "But the nearest land is the
  Island of the Valkars. It has a small cove, accessible in a small boat, where
  the Huitsenni often stop for fresh water, and where hey have erected a small
  but strong shelter into which they may retire if surprised by a large force
  of the terrible inhabitants of the place. It may be that he has gone to this
  shelter for the night, intending to embark for some safer place
  tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Can you guide us to it?"</p>

  <p>"I can but try, Majesty. I am no navigator like San Thoy, who can probably
  win safely across the shoals into the cove without even the aid of a light.
  But the island is a large one, and I know the general direction. If I steer
  properly we should reach some part of its rugged coast in a short time."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Kantar, grimly, "see that you steer properly if you would
  live to see tomorrow's light."</p>

  <p>The mast lights of the fleet were twinkling faintly in the distance as the
  yellow man took the tiller, and swinging it around set his course. After
  taking the precaution of securing his prisoner's ankles with a piece of rope,
  Kantar sat down a short distance ahead of him and managed to sail, while
  Grandon kept watch in the front of the craft.</p>

  <p>They had not traveled far before the boom of breakers sounded ahead.</p>

  <p>"There is the Island of the Valkars," said the prisoner, "But I know not
  how to find the cove. If we should try to land anywhere else we would be
  almost certain either to be dashed to pieces on the rugged shore or sunk by
  the jagged teeth of one of the many hidden reefs which circle the island. If
  we do land in safety, we may be set upon in the darkness by the Valkars, and
  carried away to be devoured."</p>

  <p>"What are these Valkars?" asked Grandon.</p>

  <p>"I, who have sailed every ocean of Zorovia, have never seen creatures more
  horrible." said the yellow man. Endowed with human intelligence, they
  manufacture and use weapons and implements of metal, yet they are not human,
  nor even mammalian. They are amphibians. Twice we fought them off when we
  landed for water. I was a member of the landing party. Although we
  outnumbered them each time, we lost several men in each engagement. Some were
  torn to pieces and devoured before our eyes. Others of our slain and wounded
  were carried away.</p>

  <p>"But that was not all. After our ship had left the island following the
  first engagement with the Valkars, those of our men who had been stabbed,
  cut, bitten, or scratched in the battle, though ever so slightly, began dying
  horrible deaths. Our mojak, who was wiser than most, had one of our Valkar
  prisoners slain, and according to an ancient custom, ordered every man who
  had received so much as a scratch to either drink a drop of its blood or eat
  a mouthful of its flesh. The men who complied with this order in time lived,
  but we did not know the reason until later.</p>

  <p>"We took two captured Valkars to Huitsen, where they were examined by our
  most learned scientists. They found that these creatures secrete a venom from
  glands in their mouths, and before going into battle, smear their weapons and
  claws with it. In their blood, however, is a substance, a small quantity of
  which counteracts the effect of the venom. Because they were venomous, they
  apparently thought we were, also, and it was evidently for that reason that
  some of our men were torn to pieces on the battlefield and their fragments
  distributed among and devoured by our enemies."</p>

  <p>While they were talking, Grandon had been straining his eyes into the
  darkness before them. Suddenly he exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"I see a light dead ahead!"</p>

  <p>"Then I have steered better than I could have hoped," said the yellow
  pirate, "for it must be the light from the cabin in the cove. We will be
  there shortly if we can pass through the shoals unscathed."</p>

  <p>He set his course dead ahead, asking Grandon to watch the light and direct
  him, as he was unable to see it from the stern on account of the sail. This
  Grandon did, and was greatly mystified as he watched, for although the light
  had seemed to be not more than a mile away when he first saw it, and they
  continued to sail swiftly toward it, it did not increase in brightness or
  apparent nearness. It seemed to have an unnatural, phosphorescent gleam,
  also, that would scarcely be expected to come from a cabin light.</p>

  <p>The breakers roared louder and louder as they progressed. Suddenly their
  hull glanced from a submerged rock, scraped a second, and smashed, head on,
  into a third. There was a rendering crash as the little craft swung half
  around, buffeted by the waves for a moment before a huge roller engulfed
  her.</p>

  <p>Just beyond the treacherous shoal, two men struggled desperately in the
  boiling, seething water, in an effort to reach the shore. But the third had
  gone down, never to rise again.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch05"
     name="ch05">5.</a> &mdash; THE TOAD PEOPLE</h2>

  <p class="first">Panting heavily from his exertions, San Thoy leaned
  gloatingly over Vernia, lying where he had thrown her on the sleeping shelf.
  But his look of exultation suddenly turned to one of amazement. She had drawn
  back her feet and planted the heel in his solar plexus with such force that
  he staggered back across the little cabin, gasping for breath, until tripped
  by a chair and thrown to the floor.</p>

  <p>She did not wait to see what he would do, but sprang to her feet and
  dashed out of the cabin. But San Thoy was unusually agile for a man of his
  rotund build, and she had not taken ten steps beyond the door of the cabin
  before he was up and after her.</p>

  <p>Bounding off into the darkness with no sense of direction, and no thought
  in mind save that of escaping the pursuer from whose clutches she had just
  broken, Vernia suddenly became conscious of many pairs of gleaming eyes.
  Reflecting the light from the open door, they seemed to be looking at her
  from the surrounding darkness.</p>

  <p>With a little scream of terror, she halted in her tracks, and San Thoy,
  uttering a cry of triumph, leaped forward to recapture her. But a keen barbed
  hook on the end of a long pole suddenly shot out from the darkness at his
  right, and as it pierced his shoulder, his shout of triumph became an
  agonized shriek. It jerked him backward, so that his feet flew from under him
  and he sat down with considerable violence.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a heavy body came hurtling through the air and landed on
  two webbed feet in front of Vernia. It was about the height of a large man,
  and stood erect on two bowed legs with its toes turned so far outward that
  the two feet, with the heels together, were almost in line. The body was
  thick and heavy, and covered with scales in front. On the back and sides
  these scales were interspersed with huge bumps, which were also in evidence
  on the backs of the upper and lower limbs and on the head. The mouth was an
  enormous slit which reached nearly from ear to ear, armed with saw-like
  ridges of jaw bone in lieu of teeth. The eyes were large and set in bony
  sockets that protruded above the cheek bones. Like the feet, the hands were
  webbed and armed with sharp claws.</p>

  <p>Thus the creature which stood before Vernia might have been nothing more
  than a very large and ferocious looking toad. But the fact that it carried
  weapons&mdash;a pole with a hook on the end like that which had impaled San
  Thoy, and a mace with a curved bill which hung by a thong from its wrist
  &mdash;and that it wore a belt in which a large knife was thrust, made it
  evident that this was no common toad. It was infinitely more formidable and
  terrible than a creature with the mind as well as the body of a toad could
  have been. Its use of weapons was evidence of an intelligence which was at
  least equal to that of the most primitive men.</p>

  <p>The creature uttered a hoarse croaking cry, and threw a cold scaly arm
  around Vernia's waist, slinging her over its shoulder with an ease that
  bespoke enormous strength. After struggling desperately for a moment, she
  realized the futility of attempting to pit her strength against that of the
  monster, and lay still.</p>

  <p>As if it had been a signal or a call, the sound made by her captor brought
  a score of the creatures circling around them, all armed like the first. The
  beast that had captured San Thoy unhooked him without any attention to his
  cries of anguish, and threw him, writhing and moaning, over its warty
  shoulder. Then the entire group, led by Vernia's captor, marched away.</p>

  <p>As it was pitch dark after they left the vicinity of the lighted cabin,
  Vernia was unable to see where they were going. She judged, however, from the
  movements of her captor, that they were traversing some exceedingly rugged
  country. Presently, this gave way to marshy lowlands through which the toad
  men leaped and splashed, then to firmer ground covered with tall, coarse
  grass that brushed against Vernia as she was carried through it.</p>

  <p>When the coming of the dawn made it possible for her to see, she found
  herself in the midst of a city of low, moss-covered mounds. In each of these
  mounds, a hole on the ground level, about three feet in diameter, served as a
  doorway, and from most of the doorways the huge inquiring eyes of the
  inhabitants peeped cautiously out at the prisoners as they were being brought
  in.</p>

  <p>Many of the other creatures which were moving about the place paused to
  stare at Vernia, as if they had never seen any one of her race before. San
  Thoy, it appeared, was of a race which they had previously seen. At least he
  did not attract nearly so much attention.</p>

  <p>A shallow, sluggish stream with muddy bottom meandered through the center
  of the village, and seated on its banks or partly submerged in its leisurely
  flowing water, a number of the creatures dozed languidly.</p>

  <p>The adult creatures on the bank and in the water, Vernia noticed, were all
  females&mdash;smaller than the males, and if possible more hideous. But
  hopping and crawling around them, and swimming in the muddy water, were
  hundreds of youngsters, apparently newly hatched, and none over eight inches
  tall.</p>

  <p>Her captor chancing to walk quite near the bank with her, Vernia saw, with
  some surprise, that the placidly dozing females were there for a purpose that
  of hatching their young; for she saw one of the large lumps on the back of
  the nearest female burst open, and an infant, after tumbling out into the
  mud, made straight for the water and dove in. Its mother paid no attention
  whatever to the incident, nor did she so much as turn to look at her
  offspring. Several other lumps on her back had already burst open, and she
  was waiting for the rest to do the same.</p>

  <p>Presently her captor left the bank of the stream, and after threading many
  pathways between the numerous mounds, stopped before a mound which was much
  larger than any of the others and appeared to be in the very heart of the
  city. It had a number of entrances but her captor chose the largest, and
  stopping, walked through it into a large, domelike room which was lighted by
  a peculiar, phosphorescent radiance that gave everything a ghastly greenish
  tint. This peculiar light came from immense writhing glow-worms suspended on
  chains overhead. The air of the place was filled with a musty stench, similar
  to that which Vernia had noticed outside, but here so strong as to be almost
  overpowering.</p>

  <p>Her captor swung her down from his warty shoulders, and set her on her
  feet. Then she was whirled around to face a creature much more repulsive
  looking than the one that had captured her. It was squatting on the slimy cap
  of a gray toadstool set against the rear wall, staring at her with its
  goggling, gold-rimmed eyes. Its scaly hide draped its body in wrinkled folds,
  and there was about it a look of dried-up emaciation, as if it were very old
  and partly mummified.</p>

  <p>One taloned hand held a huge mace with a curved bill. The other toyed with
  the hilt of a long, curved knife that hung from a massive chain girdling the
  monster's middle.</p>

  <p>On either side of the fungoid throne occupied by the hideous creature was
  a yellow man of Huitsen, standing with folded arms in the attitude of a
  slave. These two pirates, captives of the toad people and evidently in
  attendance to the repulsive thing which seemed to be in authority, were quite
  filthy, and clothed in a few tattered rags which had once been garments. Both
  leered at the beautiful captive with their cat-like eyes, and grinned
  toothlessly.</p>

  <p>After staring at her for fully five minutes, the squat monster on the
  toadstool rolled its gold rimmed eyes toward the yellow man who stood at its
  right, and emitted a rapid succession of hoarse, booming croaks.</p>

  <p>Much to Vernia's surprise the man replied in a human approximation of the
  same sounds&mdash;evidently the language of the toad people. Then he
  addressed Vernia. "His Majesty wishes to know your name, and whence you
  came," he said in Patoa.</p>

  <p>Vernia raised her eyebrows: "His Majesty! Do you refer to that croaking
  monster?"</p>

  <p>"I refer to Grunk, Rogo of the Valkars. On this island his wish is law. It
  will be wise for you to answer his question."</p>

  <p>"Tell him that I am Vernia, Torroga of Reabon," she directed, "and that he
  will be richly rewarded if I am returned, unharmed, to my people."</p>

  <p>For several minutes the toad ruler and the yellow man carried on a
  croaking conversation. Then the latter addressed Vernia once more.</p>

  <p>"His Majesty knows nothing of rewards, nor is he concerned with them,"
  said he. "It was difficult for me to convey the idea to him in the Valkar
  language, and even then it did not impress him. He is interested in you for
  one reason, and that is because you are the first human female his warriors
  have ever captured. A number of the Huitsenni, who stop at this island for
  fresh water, have been captured and enslaved from time to time by the toad
  people. As we are more skillful than they in mining and smelting metals and
  the manufacture of weapons, tools, chains, and ornaments, they set us at
  these tasks. They recognize, also that some of us have superior cunning, I,
  Hui Sen, and my brother, Lui Sen, are retained for that reason as counsellors
  for the rogo. We try to do our work well, for as long as we prove useful we
  will be kept alive. But if our work displeases Grunk, we will either be
  killed and eaten by the Valkars or fed to Sistabez."</p>

  <p>"And who is Sistabez?"</p>

  <p>"The deity of the Toad People. They think him a god, though he is only a
  snake&mdash;an immense serpent who must be at least a thousand years old, for
  he has outlived many generation of Valkars. As far back as Valkar tradition
  goes, Sistabez has lived in his cave in the mountainside, emerging at regular
  intervals when hungry. At such times living sacrifices are fed to him in
  order to keep him from raiding the village, which he has done several times
  when sacrifices were not brought promptly.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes he devours but one victim. At other times he is not satisfied
  with less than three or four. When he is seen emerging from his cave, guards
  sound the alarm, and a victim is chained to a stake in his path. A second
  victim is chained farther down the pathway, and a third still farther. He may
  devour only the first, or perhaps the first and second, but sometimes he
  comes on and devours the third. If he turns back to his cave then, all is
  well. If not, a fourth victim is chained in his pathway. Never has he been
  known to devour more than four victims at one meal, but woe be to the Valkars
  if he becomes angry, for then he will wantonly slay hundreds before returning
  to his lair."</p>

  <p>Once more, Hui Sen turned and deferentially addressed Grunk in the
  croaking language. For some time the Rogo of the Valkars made no reply, but
  continued to stare at Vernia with his round, gold-rimmed eyes. Then,
  apparently having come to some decision, he croaked an order to the yellow
  slave.</p>

  <p>"His Majesty," said Hui Sen, "has decided to retain you alive that you may
  serve the purpose for which females were created, and thus multiply the
  number of his slaves. Later, he will make some mental tests among the slaves,
  to determine who shall be your mate."</p>

  <p>Up to this moment, Vernia had desired to live, hoping in the face of
  despair that she might some day be restored to Grandon. But as the
  significance of Hui Sen's words sank into her brain, her one desire was for
  speedy death. The hilt of her captor's knife projected invitingly before her.
  Suddenly turning, she whipped it from the sheath and drew it back to plunge
  it into her bosom. But Lui Sen, standing beside the throne, while less
  talkative than his brother, was more observing, and the first to perceive her
  intention. With a cat-like spring he alighted in front of her, seized her
  wrist, and wrenched the knife from her grasp. Then the Rogo croaked an order,
  and Vernia's captor dragged her out of the hut.</p>

  <p>She was led through the village of moss covered mounds, toward a large
  mound in the midst of an extensive enclosure, surrounded by a paling of metal
  bars and guarded by armed Valkars. After exchanging croaks with her
  conductor, one of the guards opened a gate and she was pushed into the
  enclosure. Here, several hundred Huitsenni slaves were at work, forging,
  sharpening, and polishing weapons for their batrachian masters under the
  supervision of armed Valkar overseers. The forges were hollowed stones in
  which were beds of live coals. The bellows were the lungs of huge Valkars,
  who blew through reed tubes which entered holes in the bottoms of the forges.
  The anvils were large, rounded stones, at which the yellow workers squatted
  as they hammered out hooks, mace heads, and knife blades.</p>

  <p>The place was a bedlam&mdash;the clanking of metal, the roar of flames,
  the croaks of the overseers, and the chatter of the slaves. The floor of the
  enclosure was littered with filth and everywhere spattered with red kerra
  juice. The Valkars, though they did not use the narcotic themselves evidently
  believed that it made their human slaves more efficient, and kept them well
  supplied with the pods containing the red spores, which they mumbled from
  morning to night, and spat unbelievable quantities of reddened saliva all
  about them.</p>

  <p>Other workers were sharpening the knife blades, hook points and barbs, and
  mace bills, with rough stones, and still others were polishing them with
  sand. The metal parts then went to the assemblers, where the knives and maces
  were fitted with wooden handles, and the hooks with long shafts.</p>

  <p>Sickened by the squalor of the place and overwhelmed with horror at
  thought of the fate which Grunk, Rogo of the Valkars, planned for her, Vernia
  shrank back against the bars of the enclosure. The yellow ex-pirates seemed
  fully aware of Grunk's intentions with regard to her, and raised lascivious
  eyes from their work to drink in her beauty, the while they bandied coarse
  jests, and speculated as to who would be the lucky slave to draw this prize
  of feminine pulchritude for whom mighty emperors had contended in vain.</p>

  <p>Quite near her, a group of Huitsenni was assembling knives, tossing them
  into a central pile when finished. With one of these in her possession, she
  could swiftly defeat the purpose of Grunk. It was only a few steps to the
  pile. Would they divine her purpose?</p>

  <p>She decided that a circuitous route would be the least likely to make them
  suspicious. So she set off first in the opposite direction, pausing to watch
  various groups of workers as if greatly interested in what they were doing.
  The coarse jokes of each group subsided as she drew near each in turn. They
  were more than a little awed by the imminence of the Torroga of Reabon. And
  there were a number of egotistical creatures among them who strove to impress
  her with attempts at dignity and gentle bearing.</p>

  <p>Last of all, she approached the group of workers surrounding the rapidly
  mounting pile of knives. Casually, she picked up one of the finished weapons
  as if to examine it. With a swift movement, she raised it aloft, poised above
  her breast.</p>

  <p>A greasy yellow hand reached over her shoulder&mdash;seized her wrist and
  shook the knife from her grasp. Then a coarse laugh grated in her ear.</p>

  <p>She spun around to face the filthy and ragged Hui Sen. Evidently he had
  been stealthily following her for some time.</p>

  <p>"Come," he grinned toothlessly, retaining a tight grip on her wrist. "From
  now on you belong to me, for I am the Rogo's choice."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch06"
     name="ch06">6.</a> &mdash; THE DECEPTIVE LIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">As Grandon struggled in the seething water, he strove to
  look about him for some sign of Kantar the Gunner. But save for that
  phosphorescent luminescence which had lured them onto the rocks, all was
  blackness.</p>

  <p>"Kantar!" he shouted. "Kantar! Where are you?"</p>

  <p>A big roller caught him unawares. Part of it he inhaled. Strangling and
  choking, he endeavored to rid his tortured lungs of the smarting brine. All
  the time he was being carried swiftly toward that deceptive phosphorescence.
  The roar of the breakers grew deafening. He realized, then, that if Kantar
  had been within fifty feet of him when he shouted, he probably would not have
  heard his cry.</p>

  <p>Presently his hands struck a sloping ledge of sharp coral. He drew himself
  up onto it, and stood erect. But a giant comber knocked him flat, cutting his
  hands, face, and body on the jagged coral. After that he crawled forward
  painfully. At length the coral was replaced by rugged bits of stone, and
  finally by a sharply slanting beach where jointed sawtoothed reeds grew among
  outcroppings of volcanic rock. For some time he rested on a slab of water-
  worn lava, panting heavily from his exertions. His cuts and scratches were
  rendered doubly painful by the salt water.</p>

  <p>Presently he stood up. The phosphorescent light was not more than five
  hundred feet away, and it seemed to be slowly moving toward him in a rather
  erratic fashion. It lit up the waving reeds and brackish pools with a pale
  greenish white luminescence. As he watched, it stopped behind a clump of tall
  reeds.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, between himself and the light he saw a human form sloshing
  through the pools. There was something familiar about the bedraggled figure,
  and he recognized the gunner.</p>

  <p>"Kantar!" he shouted, running forward.</p>

  <p>The figure splashed onward, unable to hear him because of the roar of the
  breakers. At a distance of a few feet he again shouted: "Kantar!" at the top
  of his voice.</p>

  <p>The gunner turned.</p>

  <p>"Majesty!" he exclaimed. "I had thought you drowned with that yellow
  pirate. Praise Thorth, you are alive!"</p>

  <p>"We must find that but of the Huitsenni, quickly," said Grandon as he came
  up. "Have you any idea where to look for it?"</p>

  <p>"Our guide said there would be a light," replied Kantar. "I was about to
  investigate this one."</p>

  <p>"I saw it moving a moment ago," said Grandon. "I doubt that the cabin
  would be built in a salt marsh, or that a light in it would move about as
  this one has. Perhaps it is a light carried by one of the creatures the
  pirates called 'Valkars.' But it will do no harm to investigate."</p>

  <p>Cautiously they crept forward through the marsh, bending down below the
  level of the waving reeds so that they would not be seen. Presently Kantar
  laid a hand on Grandon's, arm, and exclaimed: "I see it, Majesty! Why, it's
  an enormous worm!"</p>

  <p>Looking through the place where the gunner had parted the reeds, the
  Earthman saw a fat, grub-like creature about five feet in length. Its entire
  body glowed with a greenish white light. Leisurely it moved among the reeds,
  browsing on the water plants that grew in the bottoms of the brackish
  pools.</p>

  <p>Disturbed at its feeding by the sound, the creature reared its luminous
  head and spied them. Arching its neck, it gnashed its mandibles
  threateningly.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if that thing would shine as brightly dead as alive," said
  Grandon. "If so, it would be useful to us."</p>

  <p>For answer, Kantar elevated the muzzle of his tork, and pressing the
  firing button, deftly sprayed a line of the needlelike projectiles across the
  luminous throat.</p>

  <p>Cut off as cleanly as if by a sword blade in the hands of an expert, the
  head fell from the body, which immediately began writhing and thrashing about
  in the rushes and shallow water.</p>

  <p>"Neatly done, Gunner," commented Grandon. "Why the thing appears to be
  shining more than ever! Now for a couple of torches."</p>

  <p>So saying, he whipped out his scarbo, and advancing to where the headless
  thing squirmed and floundered in the reeds, cut off two sections, each about
  a foot in length. Then, with two sharpened reeds which the thrust into the
  sections for handles, he made a pair of torches, each of which was capable of
  lighting up the terrain for at least fifty feet in every direction.</p>

  <p>Grandon passed one torch to Kantar, and holding the other above his head,
  set off along the shore line in the hope of coming upon the cabin which their
  yellow prisoner bad described, and where he believed they would find Vernia
  in the power of the unscrupulous San Thoy. But though they traveled as
  swiftly as the rugged character of the shore line would permit for the rest
  of the night, morning dawned without their having reached their
  objective.</p>

  <p>With his scarbo, Grandon speared a large, spiny fish, left by the ebbing
  tide in a small pool. They cooked a portion of it over a fire of dry reeds
  ignited by Grandon's flame maker. It was tough, bony, and rather tasteless,
  but a welcome meal, nevertheless, to the two hungry men.</p>

  <p>As soon as they had breakfast, they set off once more along the shore
  line. Shortly thereafter, the character of the terrain underwent a decided
  change. The ground sloped upward, and instead of marsh behind them, there was
  now a belt of fern forest. And the flat beach gave way to rugged rock ledges,
  then towering cliffs, clothed to their very edges with tree ferns, bush
  ferns, and many creeping and climbing varieties, as well as a few species of
  cycads and other primitive types. Here there grew in abundance the large
  Zorovian water ferns, the ribs of which contain water, clear, cold, and sweet
  as any that may be found on Venus. They paused, and broke off enough fronds
  to assuage their thirst and fill their canteens. Then they pressed
  onward.</p>

  <p>Soon they came, quite unexpectedly, upon a small natural harbor. The
  entrance was a narrow channel which zigzagged between tall cliffs, and the
  little inland bay, protected from wind and waves by this natural barrier, was
  as smooth as glass.</p>

  <p>"This must be the cove described by our prisoner," said Grandon,
  excitedly. "The cabin should not be far off."</p>

  <p>"I see it, Majesty," cried sharp-eyed gunner, "over near the center of the
  bay. It's partly hidden by the tree ferns."</p>

  <p>"Sure enough! Come on."</p>

  <p>Grandon led the way at so swift a pace now, that the tired gunner was
  sorely put to it to keep up with him. As they neared the cabin, the sight of
  the small boat which had been left there by San Thoy caused Grandon to hurry
  faster than ever, for he now felt positive that he should find Vernia and her
  captor in the cabin. But within less than a hundred feet of the cabin, he
  stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>"We must approach with caution, Gunner," he said. "The yellow beast is
  probably armed with a tork, and it wouldn't be healthy for us if he saw or
  heard us coming. Better go in from two different directions, too, so if he
  gets one of us the other will have a chance at him."</p>

  <p>They separated accordingly, and circling the cabin, crept cautiously up to
  it from opposite directions. The first to reach the front of the little
  building, Grandon saw the door standing wide open. With drawn scarbo, he
  leaped through, then stopped in amazement, for a single glance around the
  room told him that it was deserted.</p>

  <p>The gunner was only a few steps behind Grandon.</p>

  <p>"Gone?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"So it seems. But where?"</p>

  <p>Hanging on a peg at one side of the room was a belt containing a scarbo,
  tork, and knife. Grandon's shoulder struck the hanging scarbo, and it clanked
  against the tork.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he exclaimed, lifting the belt from the peg. "Why, these
  are the weapons of San Thoy! His name is engraved on the belt buckle in
  Patoan characters."</p>

  <p>"I judge that he would not willingly have left without them."</p>

  <p>"No, not willingly."</p>

  <p>"Then who could have carried them off, and what has become of Her Majesty,
  your wife?"</p>

  <p>"Who but the Valkars, those toad-like monsters that our prisoner
  described. We must find the trail. I'll take San Thoy's weapons and give the
  other scarbo to you. Then we'll both be fully armed."</p>

  <p>Soon Grandon, who had learned his woodcraft from the Fighting Traveks, his
  fierce mountaineer subjects of Uxpo, and learned it well, discovered blood
  spots about a hundred feet from the door of the hut. And in the soft leaf
  mold were the small footprints of a woman, the large prints of a man, and the
  still larger tracks of webbed and clawed feet. Kantar who was born and bred
  in the mountain fastnesses of Uxpo, read the signs as quickly as did the
  Earthman.</p>

  <p>"She ran out here to escape the yellow pirate," he said.</p>

  <p>"And both were carried off by the Valkars," finished Grandon. "Blood was
  spilled. I trust that it was not hers."</p>

  <p>"It starts at the point where San Thoy was lifted off his feet."</p>

  <p>"True enough. Let us hope for the best. And now to the trail."</p>

  <p>It was not difficult for the two trained woodsmen to follow the well-
  marked trail of the toad people. It led them through the belt of thick fern
  forest that fringed the shore, and across a range of rugged and sparsely
  wooded hills, into a gloomy and treacherous swamp. Here Grandon, at almost
  the first step, sank into a quagmire up to his chin. It would speedily have
  closed over his head, had not Kantar been there to extend a helping hand.
  Even then, it was with the greatest difficulty that the gunner succeeded in
  drawing him out of the clinging, sticky mess.</p>

  <p>After this misadventure, Grandon took more care where he stepped, quickly
  learning that a piece of ground which was safe for a web-footed Valkar might
  be extremely perilous for a man. He chafed at the delay occasioned by the
  necessity of testing each bit of soil before stepping on it, but was
  constrained by the obvious verity that if he did not travel with caution his
  travels would soon be terminated.</p>

  <p>Nor was the treacherous footing the sole menace the swamp held for the
  two. They were constantly compelled to be on the lookout for venomous snakes
  which crawled across their pathway, and tremendous whistling serpents that
  dangled from tree limbs, waiting for unsuspecting victims on which to drop,
  then crush the life out of them with their immense muscular coils. In
  addition, they were compelled to avoid the huge saurians which made the
  morass their habitation. Some of these were herbivores, and harmless unless
  disturbed, but others, the mighty carnivores which fed on these and any other
  smaller bits of flesh that came their way, would make short work of them if
  they suspected this pair of tender, two-legged animals was crossing their
  feeding ground. Annoying, too, were the constant attacks of biting and
  stinging insect pests which buzzed in thick clouds about them.</p>

  <p>Both men heaved a sigh of relief when they presently reached higher arid
  drier ground, for though the tall grass through which the path wound might
  harbor even more dangerous enemies than they had seen in the swamp, they were
  at least sure of their footing, and soon left the bulk of their insect
  tormentors behind.</p>

  <p>They had traveled about a mile into this grassy savanna, when Grandon
  suddenly caught his companion by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Quiet!" he said. "I hear something coming!"</p>

  <p>Unmistakably there came to the ears of both the sound of someone or
  something speeding through the tall grass, then a shriek of pain or terror,
  and a hoarse booming croak.</p>

  <p>"Come on," cried Grandon. "It sounds like a human being attacked by some
  fierce beast."</p>

  <p>They had only taken a few steps in the direction of the sounds when there
  hove into view, running for his life, a short, bandy-legged yellow man.
  Although Grandon and Kantar had never seen a Valkar, both instantly
  identified the hideous, warty creature which followed in swift pursuit, from
  the description their former prisoner had given them. It was rapidly
  shortening the distance between itself and its shrieking quarry, and the long
  pole it carried, tipped with a barbed hook, was extended to transfix its
  victim.</p>

  <p>Kantar elevated the muzzle of his tork.</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot," warned Grandon. "The sound may betray us, and bring a horde
  of these creatures. You grab the yellow man, and I'll take the Valkar."</p>

  <p>Whipping out his scarbo, the Earthman accordingly crouched in the grass at
  one side of the part, while Kantar, similarly armed, concealed himself on the
  other side.</p>

  <p>Just as he came opposite them, the fugitive was caught by the barbed hook.
  He uttered an agonized shriek as it pierced his arm. But before his pursuer
  could jerk him backward, Kantar's scarbo had cut through the shaft. And
  Grandon, blade in hand, had leaped at the Valkar.</p>

  <p>Although he was taken by surprise, the toad man was remarkably quick.
  Dropping his useless shaft, he snatched his long knife from his belt, and
  raised it to parry the cut which Grandon aimed at his head. It turned the
  blade of the scarbo so that, in descending it only cut a small slice from the
  scaly shoulder. At the same instant, with lightning quickness, he struck the
  Earthman with the mace in his left hand.</p>

  <p>The blow took Grandon by surprise, and the hooked bill bit into his right
  shoulder, which he had instinctively raised to protect his face, inflicting a
  painful wound. With a croak of triumph the monster jerked the Earthman toward
  him, intent on finishing him with the knife. But at that instant, Grandon
  drew back his lowered scarbo, then thrust upward with all his might. The
  blade, driven with terrific force, entered the silver-gray throat, and
  passing upward through the head, came out between the bulging eyes. With a
  hoarse death croak, the Valkar sank to the ground, kicking convulsively.</p>

  <p>Kantar came running up, dragging his yellow prisoner, from whose arm he
  had extracted the barbed hook.</p>

  <p>"Why, you are bleeding, Majesty!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Only a flesh wound," replied Grandon. "I'll be all right." The gunner
  twisted the small cup from the top of his kova flask, and held it to the
  bleeding throat of the dying Valkar. In an instant it was filled with blood.
  He stood up and proffered the cup to Grandon.</p>

  <p>"You must drink this quickly, Majesty," he said, "or your wound may prove
  fatal."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?" demanded the Earthman. "Have you gone
  crazy?"</p>

  <p>"Drink quickly, I beg of you. It is the only antidote for the venom with
  which these monsters smear their weapons."</p>

  <p>"Right. I had forgotten what our prisoner told us." He took the proffered
  cup, and with a wry face, drained it. The wounded yellow man whose wrist
  Kantar was holding, had meanwhile crouched down, and was lapping at the
  bleeding throat of the Valkar.</p>

  <p>"Let me bind your wound, Majesty," said the gunner.</p>

  <p>"No. It is not large, and will close itself. Meanwhile let us examine the
  prisoner." He glared at the diminutive yellow man, who now stood with bowed
  head, his wrist still clutched by Kantar. "Are you San Thoy?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, Majesty," replied the prisoner, who, noting the scarlet of Grandon's
  attire was aware that he stood before royalty. "San Thoy is a great mojak,
  while I, as your Majesty may see by the remains of my raiment, am only a
  common sailor."</p>

  <p>Your name, sailor."</p>

  <p>"So Lan, Majesty, late of the ship, Sagana, of the Imperial Navy of
  Huitsen. I was captured by the Valkars three endirs ago with a dozen of my
  mates when we were sent ashore for fresh water. Today I escaped from the
  prison compound, but this Valkar hunter saw me, and would have slain me or
  taken me back a prisoner had not you come up."</p>

  <p>"Saw you ought of San Thoy?"</p>

  <p>"He, and a beautiful white princess, who some say was Vernia of Reabon,
  were brought in prisoners this morning."</p>

  <p>"Where are they now?"</p>

  <p>"The white princess was brought to the slave compound shortly before I
  made my escape. It was the attention she attracted, both from the slaves and
  the Valkars, which made it possible for me to get away undetected."</p>

  <p>"And what do these Valkars intend to do with her? Hold her for
  ransom?"</p>

  <p>No, Majesty. They care nothing for money, or any other things of great
  worth. But I heard that Grunk, their Rogo, who has never before captured a
  human female, planned to keep her for the purpose of breeding a race of
  slaves."</p>

  <p>"Enough! Lead us at once to this compound. Perform your task faithfully,
  take me to a spot where I can set eyes on my wife, and you will be permitted
  to escape again. But remember, one sign of treachery, and you die."</p>

  <p>"Your wife! Then you are the famed Grandon of Terra, the hero from the
  planet Mignor, who won the most beautiful woman on Zorovia!" He dropped to
  his knees, and with both hands extended, palms downward, pressed his forehead
  to the ground. "I do homage to so mighty a swordsman and so famed a ruler,"
  he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Up, and cease this mummery, or by the bones of Thorth, I'll split your
  head, and go on without a guide. Vernia of Reabon will take her own life
  rather than submit to the dictates of this reptilian rogo. As it is, we may
  be too late."</p>

  <p>The pirate scrambled hastily to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I'll guide you, Majesty, and quickly," he promised, "but we must circle
  the Valkar village to reach the compound. Otherwise we should not be
  permitted to go far."</p>

  <p>He set off at once through the tall, rustling grass, with Grandon, scarbo
  in hand, just behind him, and Kantar bringing up the rear. After a short walk
  Grandon heard, only a little way ahead of them, the chatter of human
  conversation and the croaking of Valkars, punctuated by the sharp clanking of
  metal.</p>

  <p>So Lan turned. "The compound is just ahead," he whispered. "Those are the
  sounds made by the metal workers and their overseers."</p>

  <p>The three crept cautiously forward now. So Lan, parting the grass, pointed
  to an enclosure by a paling of metal bars, in the center of which was a
  large, moss-covered mound.</p>

  <p>Grandon's heart gave a great bound as he saw Vernia standing beside a pile
  of knives. Then he cried out in anguish, and would have leaped forward had
  not Kantar detained him, as he saw her snatch the knife and attempt to plunge
  it into her bosom. But it was instantly shaken from her grasp by one of the
  yellow slaves who had grasped her wrist. Fortunately, Grandon's involuntary
  cry had not been heard over that bedlam of sound, and so the three men still
  crouched there, undetected.</p>

  <p>"What are we to do now Majesty?" asked Kantar.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Gunner. Let me think&mdash;let me plan. A sudden rush and a
  shower of tork bullets might be best. And yet, it might mean the death of
  Vernia. We must try to think of a better scheme."</p>

  <p>He turned to the yellow man who still crouched in the grass beside him.
  "You may go now, So Lan. You have earned your freedom."</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty has saved the life of So Lan," replied the pirate, "and he
  is not ungrateful. Permit him to remain near you, that he may be of
  assistance in the rescue of Her Majesty, your wife."</p>

  <p>"How? You are unarmed. But wait. Perhaps we can use you, for you could
  pass unnoticed among the slaves where one of us would be instantly
  detected."</p>

  <p>"I but await Your Majesty's commands," replied So Lan, bowing low.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch07"
     name="ch07">7.</a> &mdash; HUMAN SACRIFICE</h2>

  <p class="first">Vernia strove to wrench her arm free, but she was helpless
  in the grip of the filthy and ragged Hui Sen. He grinned the hideous,
  toothless grin of the Huitsenni, and pushed a fresh quid of kerra spores into
  his cheek as he dragged her toward the gate.</p>

  <p>"Where are you taking me?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"First to the burrow of His Majesty, Grunk, Rogo of the Valkars, that he
  may give you his commands in person. Then, if he does not change his mind,
  which he sometimes does, but which I hope will not be the case in this
  instance, I will take you to my own burrow."</p>

  <p>"Suppose that I should offer you the wealth and position of a prince
  &mdash;make you rich and powerful beyond your fondest dreams. Would you help
  me to escape?"</p>

  <p>That would be impossible, Majesty. I am not so strong a swimmer that I
  could reach your country from here, and the Valkars would not give us time to
  build a boat."</p>

  <p>"But there is a small sailboat, provisioned and ready, in the harbor where
  your boats stop for fresh water. If we could reach it and get away by night,
  surely you are enough of a navigator to sail it to Reabon. And what I
  promise, I will perform."</p>

  <p>"We will speak of this later, Majesty," replied Hui Sen. "Just now I must
  take you before the Rogo." He entered into a short, croaking conversation
  with the Valkar guard at the gate, who then swung it open, permitting them to
  pass.</p>

  <p>As they threaded their way between the moss-covered mounds toward the
  burrow of Grunk, Hui Sen looked cautiously about him as if fearful of being
  overheard, then said: "I cannot deny, Majesty, that the station and wealth of
  a prince would be a great temptation to me, for I have lived in squalor these
  many years. And while living thus, my only solace has been in dreams of
  splendor and power. But the risk would be tremendous. To pass the Valkar
  guards would not be easy. To cross the swamp without a Valkar guide would be
  next to impossible. Were it not for that swamp, my people would long ago have
  exterminated the Valkars. There is also the possibility that the boat might
  not be there, in which event the Valkars would be sure to find us, and I, at
  least, would be horribly punished. Added to these, and by far not the least
  of the considerations, would be the fact that I should lose you as my
  mate."</p>

  <p>"On that score, at least, you may set yourself at rest," said Vernia.
  "Does the hahoe take the mate of the marmelot, or the awoo the mate of the
  ramph? Grandon of Terra is my mate, and sooner or later he will find this
  island, wipe the Valkars from the face of the planet, and all with them who
  have offered me indignity."</p>

  <p>"Grandon of Terra will not find this place," said Hui Sen, confidently.
  "You cannot frighten me with his name, mighty as I know it to be."</p>

  <p>"You will remember, also," continued Vernia, "that the mate of the
  marmelot is not without claws. I promise you that, if you offer me any
  indignity, I will slay you at the first opportunity, and myself, also.
  Sleeping or waking, your life will never be safe, if you drag me off to your
  stinking burrow."</p>

  <p>"That I know you would do," replied Hui Sen, seemingly impressed, "for the
  women of Reabon were ever jealous of their honor. Night and day, I would
  always be on my guard, unless, perchance, you should learn to love me."</p>

  <p>"Love you? Why, you greasy yellow beast! You unspeakable filth! Sooner
  would I love a warty Valkar." This was said with flashing eyes, and an
  imperious mien that humbled the yellow man.</p>

  <p>"I mean no offense, Majesty," he whined. "Even a worm may look at a star
  with the hope that, inaccessible as it seems, it shines favorably upon him.
  But here we are at the burrow of the Rogo."</p>

  <p>They were about to enter when Hui Sen halted and cocked his head to one
  side at the sound of a distant ululation, long drawn out, and exceedingly
  mournful.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" asked Vernia.</p>

  <p>"The cry of the guards," replied Hui Sen. "Sistabez, the great serpent,
  has come out of his cave."</p>

  <p>The howling grew in volume as thousands of Valkar throats all over the
  village took it up. At this instant, Grunk, Rogo of the Valkars, emerged from
  his burrow, accompanied by Lui Sen and his two immense Valkar guards, both of
  which, with their noses elevated and their mouths open from ear to ear, were
  howling lustily. The din had now grown so loud that speech was impossible,
  but Grunk, after staring fixedly at Vernia and Hui Sen for a moment with his
  great, gold-rimmed eyes, made a sign that they should follow him, and strode
  off between the moss-covered mounds toward the place from which the howling
  had first come. Judging from the mob of Valkars, male and female, old and
  young which was heading in the same direction, it was evident that the entire
  village had turned out.</p>

  <p>The hurrying, jostling crowd respectfully made way for the Rogo and his
  party, and they soon reached the edge of the village. Here a narrow path led
  up a rugged hillside, strewn with boulders and sparsely dotted with
  low-growing shrubs. At intervals of about a hundred feet along this path,
  heavy iron stakes had been driven into the ground.</p>

  <p>To the farthest of these stakes, a luckless yellow slave had already been
  fastened. Another was being secured to the next stake, and two guards were
  marching a third up to the next.</p>

  <p>Suddenly every voice was hushed, and Vernia saw an enormous and hideous
  head round a curve in the rugged hillside. It was about ten feet in length,
  and six in width at its broadest point tapering down to a square muzzle about
  two feet across. This massive head was reared on a thick neck fully four feet
  in diameter, to a height of about twenty feet above the ground. Behind it
  trailed a tremendous length of sinuous body. In color it was muddy green
  above, and the under scales were a greenish lemon-yellow.</p>

  <p>Languidly, unhurriedly, the monster glided down the path, surveying the
  immense crowd of Valkars and yellow slaves before it with apparent
  indifference. Presently, as it came to the first slave that had been bound in
  its path, it paused, and leisurely arched its neck. The other two slaves had,
  meanwhile, been tethered and left to their fate. All three unfortunates
  struggled desperately, and cried out for mercy, but as the serpent poised
  over the first wretch, he ceased his struggles and importunities.</p>

  <p>There was a quick, downward dart of that massive head, so swift that the
  eye could scarcely follow, and a single shriek from the victim as the immense
  jaws closed upon him, breaking his bonds like cobwebs. Then a significant
  lump slid down the serpent's throat to disappear in its tremendous coils.</p>

  <p>Leisurely the snake crawled forward once more, seized and swallowed its
  next shrieking victim. It paused for a moment, but as it moved on toward the
  third victim, a fourth was quickly chained in its path.</p>

  <p>"Sistabez is hungry today," Hui Sen said to Vernia.</p>

  <p>The snake swallowed the third victim, and continued on toward the
  fourth.</p>

  <p>"He is very hungry," said Hui Sen.</p>

  <p>As it moved forward this time, the serpent's red forked tongue darted from
  its mouth, appearing and disappearing with the rapidity of lightning.</p>

  <p>"He grows angry," cried Hui Sen, in alarm.</p>

  <p>At this instant, Grunk turned and croaked something to two guards, who
  came toward Vernia.</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" she asked Hui Sen.</p>

  <p>"He said," replied that worthy, "that Sistabez was angry because he had
  withheld the fair white prisoner from him. He ordered the guards to tie you
  to the fifth stake."</p>

  <p>With a sudden wrench, Vernia freed her wrist from the grasp of the yellow
  man, than turned to flee. But before she had taken ten steps the Valkar
  guards had her. The fourth victim shrieked his last as she was dragged to the
  stake and securely bound. The two guards retreated precipitately as the
  serpent advanced, this time traveling more swiftly than before, its tongue
  flashing like red forked lightning.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch08"
     name="ch08">8.</a> &mdash; THE WRATH OF THE SERPENT</h2>

  <p class="first">CROUCHING IN THE grass near the slave compound with Kantar
  and So Lan, Grandon saw the yellow slave who had prevented Vernia from taking
  her own life, lead her through the gate.</p>

  <p>"Where is he taking her?" he asked So Lan.</p>

  <p>"They walk toward the burrow of Grunk," replied So Lan. "I think she will
  be taken before the Rogo of the Valkars."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"Grunk will probably decide which of the slaves is to take her to his
  burrow."</p>

  <p>"I believe so, Majesty. No alarm has been sounded, so I take it that I
  have not yet been missed. The Valkar that was pursuing me was a hunter I had
  encountered at some distance from the village."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Suppose you&mdash;but wait! What is that howling sound?"</p>

  <p>"The guards are warning the Valkars that Sistabez, the great serpent, has
  awakened, and is emerging from his den. No need to go into the village now,
  for everyone will attend the sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"Sistabez?"</p>

  <p>"A huge snake worshipped by the Valkars as a god. When he comes forth,
  they chain slaves in his pathway, in order that he may not raid the village.
  Naturally they value their own lives above those of their prisoners."</p>

  <p>"And Vernia is a prisoner! Can you get us quickly to this place of
  sacrifice?"</p>

  <p>"We will have to circle the village, Majesty. It will take quite a
  while."</p>

  <p>Then hurry."</p>

  <p>"This way." So Lan dashed off through the tall grass with Grandon and
  Kantar at his heels.</p>

  <p>Before they had gone far, it was obvious to Grandon that the Valkars would
  reach the place of sacrifice long before they would. Fuming at the delay, he
  kept urging the little yellow man to his best paces, but though he was
  willing enough, his short legs would not carry him nearly so fast as the two
  impatient white men could travel.</p>

  <p>The howling from the village was deafening for some time, but to Grandon's
  surprise, it suddenly ceased altogether.</p>

  <p>"Sistabez has reached the place of sacrifice," panted So Lan. "The Valkars
  always quit their howling when he is ready to take his first victim."</p>

  <p>Grandon, who could restrain his impatience no longer, now thrust his
  puffing and nearly exhausted guide out of the way, and dashed forward at top
  speed. He needed no guide a moment later, for the shriek of the snake's first
  victim rang in his ears. Closely followed by Kantar, he bounded straight
  toward that sound. A short time later he heard, much closer, the cry of the
  second victim, then, still closer, the third, and finally the fourth.</p>

  <p>A moment later, he bounded out into the open space at the base of the
  hill, in front of which the Valkars had assembled. Vernia had just been bound
  to the stake, and the two Valkars who had tied her were fleeing for their
  lives as the great serpent advanced toward her.</p>

  <p>"Try to keep the crowd back, Gunner," he shouted to Kantar as he whipped
  out his scarbo and sprinted for the stake. The two Valkars who had bound
  Vernia tried to stop him, but he elevated the muzzle of his tork, and sprayed
  them with needle-like bullets. One of them fell, gasping and kicking his last
  for Grandon had loaded the weapon with a clip of projectiles he had found in
  the belt pouch of San Thoy, which contained enough poison to kill a dozen
  men. He dispatched the other toad man with his scarbo.</p>

  <p>A few swift strides carried him to Vernia's side, and two strokes of his
  scarbo freed her. She was so overcome by the ordeal through which she had
  just passed that she swooned, and would have fallen, had not Grandon sheathed
  his scarbo and caught her up in his arms.</p>

  <p>All this took place in less than a minute, and during this time the tork
  of the gunner had been popping to good purpose as attested by the ring of
  fallen Valkars which had been bold enough to rush him. Now, as Grandon dashed
  back into the tall grass with Vernia in his arms, Kantar ran behind him to
  cover his retreat.</p>

  <p>The serpent, meanwhile, had not shown any interest in these proceedings,
  but had crawled on past the stake to seize and swallow the two Valkars that
  still lay kicking on the ground.</p>

  <p>"What kind of bullets are you using?" Grandon asked the gunner, as they
  plunged into the grass.</p>

  <p>"Deadly," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Put in a clip of solid bullets for a moment," directed Grandon, "and give
  the big snake a half dozen or so in the neck."</p>

  <p>Kantar chuckled as he swiftly carried out the Earthman's instructions. "A
  good idea, Majesty," he said. "It will give the ugly toads something to do
  besides chasing us."</p>

  <p>Kantar was the best marksman in the Reabonian army, either with a tork or
  mattork, and it was child's play for him to quickly place the bullets as he
  had been directed. The effect on the huge serpent was instantaneous. With its
  forked tongue playing so rapidly that the eye could scarcely follow, and an
  angry hissing sound that was almost like the roar of steam escaping from a
  locomotive, it coiled and struck again and again into the closely packed
  crowd of Valkars, a tremendous living engine of destruction. Before, it had
  only been satisfying its hunger. Now it was taking swift and horrible toll of
  those creatures which it believed responsible for its hurts.</p>

  <p>With his own tork, Grandon, meanwhile, shot down a score of Valkars that
  had followed them, giving the gunner time to reload with the deadly
  projectiles. As they hurried forward once more, they were joined by So Lan,
  who had armed himself with a hook, mace, and knife taken from one of the
  fallen Valkars.</p>

  <p>"Take care not to scratch yourself or anyone else with those weapons,"
  warned Kantar, as they trotted through the grass. "We have no Valkar blood
  for an antidote, now.</p>

  <p>"I have seen to that," replied So Lan. He raised the flap of his belt
  pouch, and disclosed a slice of still quivering flesh. "This will serve all
  of us if need arise."</p>

  <p>It was evident that the Valkars were well occupied with their own
  troubles, as none appeared to molest them for some time. They soon found the
  path which led from the village to the swamp, and had followed this for about
  a mile, when Vernia, still in her husband's arms, recovered consciousness,
  and demanded to be set on her feet.</p>

  <p>"I can carry you all the way to the boat, if need be," Grandon
  protested.</p>

  <p>"No, Bob. You must save your strength, for we will have need of it. I can
  walk as well as any of you, now. Besides, your hands must be free to grasp
  your weapons. The Valkars may catch up with us at any time."</p>

  <p>"I rather think they're pretty well occupied with their own troubles,
  right now. But try it for a while if you must. I can carry you again if you
  tire."</p>

  <p>They set off at a fast walk, but had not gone far when Kantar, who was at
  the rear, softly called: "Majesty."</p>

  <p>Grandon turned. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Something following us. I see the grass waving."</p>

  <p>"We'll make a stand," Grandon decided, "and give them a warm reception if
  they're Valkars."</p>

  <p>A moment later, a short yellow man appeared in the pathway. He was
  followed by five more. Grandon recognized the leader as San Thoy, and
  whipping out his scarbo, advanced toward him, ignoring the others.</p>

  <p>"So," he thundered, "you are the yellow filth who abducted my wife!"</p>

  <p>San Thoy cringed, then dropped to his knees with right hand extended palm
  downward, as Grandon towered above him with upraised scarbo.</p>

  <p>"No, no, Majesty! Spare me! There is a misunderstanding! I tried to rescue
  Her Majesty. We stopped at the cabin to wait for daylight, that I might take
  her to the Reabonian coast."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Then you did not with your unwelcome advances, drive her forth into
  the night to be captured by the Valkars?" turned to Kantar. "Lend this
  rakehell of Huitsen your blade, Gunner, that I may settle accounts with
  him."</p>

  <p>San Thoy quaked with fear.</p>

  <p>"But I am no swordsman, Majesty," he whined, "to oppose the mightiest
  blade on Zorovia. It would be murder. Besides, as Thorth is my witness, I do
  not recall offering any affront to her Gracious Majesty. My head became so
  addled with kova that I did not know I had been wounded and captured by the
  Valkars until this morning."</p>

  <p>"I perceive," said Grandon, contemptuously, "that you are a liar and a
  coward as well as a rogue. What shall I do with the vermin Gunner?"</p>

  <p>"Strike off his head, sire, and leave his foul remains to the jungle
  scavengers."</p>

  <p>"Right. It is the least that he deserves."</p>

  <p>San Thoy cringed, expecting the death blow as Grandon raised his blade.
  But it did not fall, for at this moment Vernia caught his arm.</p>

  <p>"Please, Bob, I can't let you do it," she said. "Spare him for my
  sake."</p>

  <p>"It is for your sake that I would put an end to him," replied Grandon. "To
  permit him to live after&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please. Remember Tholto, the marshman. You would have slain him for a
  similar offense, but spared him because I requested it. And he afterward
  saved my honor when I was in the power of Zanaloth of Mernerum. Later, he
  saved both our lives."</p>

  <p>"True," replied Grandon, "But this vile creature is no more like Tholto
  than a Valkar is like me. Yet, because it is your request, I can not do
  otherwise than spare him." He spurned the groveling San Thoy with his foot.
  "Get up," he commanded, "and remember that you are indebted to the Torroga of
  Reabon for your worthless life."</p>

  <p>"Then may we accompany Your Majesties through the swamp to the coast?"
  asked one of the escaped slaves who had come up with San Thoy. "We could not
  find the way, unaided, and we are not armed against the monsters we should be
  sure to encounter."</p>

  <p>"We are not anxious for such company," replied Grandon, "but you may
  follow behind us."</p>

  <p>They set off once more, Grandon leading, closely followed by Vernia, So
  Lan, and Kantar. At a respectful distance behind tramped San Thoy and his
  Band.</p>

  <p>A short march took them to the treacherous swamp, where Grandon was able
  to make much better time than on his previous trip through it, by
  backtracking in his own footsteps. But their progress was slow at best, and
  it was not long before there came an imploring cry from San Thoy.</p>

  <p>"The Valkars are coming! Give us aid! Save us!"</p>

  <p>"They don't deserve it," said Grandon, "but after all, they are human
  beings, and unarmed and in danger. Bring your comrades forward, San Thoy," he
  called, "and you, Gunner, guard the rear. If you can't handle things, let me
  know, and I'll come back with you."</p>

  <p>Kantar stood aside until San Thoy and his comrades had time to close in
  behind So Lan. Then he fell in behind the last man, and as they marched
  forward, glanced back from time to time to note the proximity of the enemy.
  He soon saw that the Valkars were gaining rapidly on them, and also that they
  were not keeping to the trail, but were spreading out in a crescent shaped
  line, evidently with the intention of surrounding them. After communicating
  this intelligence to Grandon, he began picking off with his tork such Valkars
  as came dangerously close.</p>

  <p>Presently, when the dull-witted Valkars began to realize that to expose
  themselves to the gunner's deadly aim meant sure death, they took advantage
  of cover. This slowed them a bit, but still their pace was swifter than that
  of Grandon's party, as their webbed feet gave them considerable advantage in
  traveling over the swampy ground. Soon the two horns of their crescent caught
  up with Grandon, who began using his tork as frequently as Kantar, though
  with not quite such deadly precision. With sword or scarbo he had not met his
  equal on all Zorovia, but there was only one Kantar the Gunner, and Grandon,
  though an excellent shot, bowed to his uncanny skill with the weapon.</p>

  <p>Between the two of them, Grandon and Kantar managed to keep their enemies
  at bay until they reached the more solid footing of the sparsely wooded
  hills. But in the meantime, the horns of the crescent had closed in front of
  them. On the firmer ground, however, their speed exceeded that of the
  Valkars, and since they no longer feared those behind them, but only those in
  front and at the sides, he changed his formation, massing the non-combatants
  in the center, while he and the gunner ranged on each side.</p>

  <p>Only a few of the Valkars had succeeded in getting ahead of them, and
  these succumbed to the marksmanship of the two men. Then Grandon ordered a
  swift charge across the hill that confronted them, and beyond which was the
  thick fern forest that fringed the bay. When he reached the brow of the hill,
  he glanced back and saw that several hundred Valkars had already emerged from
  the swamp, while at least a thousand swarmed through the muck and water
  behind them. But the sight of this vast force did not dismay him, for he knew
  that his party could easily outrun them on the firm ground that lay ahead,
  and that they would have ample time to launch the little boat which San Thoy
  had moored near the cabin.</p>

  <p>They dashed down the rugged hillside, and plunged into the fern forest,
  just as the front lines of their pursuers swept over the brow of the hill.
  But Grandon had scarcely taken fifty steps into the forest shadows, when a
  heavy body fell on his back from the branches above, knocking him to the
  ground. It was quickly followed by a half dozen more, and though the Earthman
  managed to struggle to his feet, his arms were pinioned behind him, and his
  weapons taken away. He had led his party directly into an ambush of yellow
  pirates. Kantar, he observed, had been served in like manner.</p>

  <p>Suddenly then, as if by magic, a whole army of Huitsenni appeared,
  stepping from behind tree trunks, bushes, and rocks, and dropping from the
  dense tangle of branches overhead. The little party was completely surrounded
  and hopelessly outnumbered.</p>

  <p>Waddling toward them through the ranks of the pirates, who respectfully
  made way for him, Grandon now recognized Thid Yet, Romojak of the Navies of
  Huitsen.</p>

  <p>Thid Yet expectorated a red stream of kerra juice, and grinned
  toothlessly, as he bowed before Grandon and Vernia.</p>

  <p>"I am gratified that we arrived in time to save Your Majesties from the
  Valkars," he said. "Guest chambers have been prepared for you and your
  warrior aboard my flagship." His eyes next fell on the cowering San Thoy.
  "So, traitor, we meet again. I doubt not that His Majesty of Huitsen will
  contrive exquisite tortures for you when he has heard the story of your
  perfidy. Seize him, men." His glance next fell on So Lan and the other
  unarmed yellow men who formed the balance of the party. "Who are you?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"We are from various crews, Excellency, sent ashore for water, and
  captured in engagements with the Valkars, who held us as dives," replied So
  Lan.</p>

  <p>"So? Then report to my mojo who will assign you to new berths."</p>

  <p>At this moment, one of Thid Yet's aids ran up to announce that the Valkars
  were attacking in force.</p>

  <p>"Tell the mattork crews to make a stand at the edge of the woods and mow
  them down without mercy," commanded Thid Yet. "These warty monsters need a
  lesson, and now is the time to read them one they will not soon forget."</p>

  <p>As they marched toward the harbor, Grandon heard the rattle of mattork
  fire, which continued for several minutes. Then it suddenly stopped, and he
  concluded that the Valkars, seeing that they had run into an ambush, bad
  retreated. This he afterward learned was really the case.</p>

  <p>They found the beach lined with the small boats of the Huitsenni, while
  the pirate fleet rode at anchor less than a quarter of a mile from the
  entrance to the cove. Grandon, Vernia, Kantar, and San Thoy were rowed to the
  flagship in the boat of Thid Yet. Back on the deck of the vessel once more,
  the Romojak gave swift orders.</p>

  <p>"Return Her Majesty of Reabon to her former quarters, and keep her door
  constantly guarded," he told his mojo. "His Majesty, here, together with his
  warrior and our treacherous mojak, will have to be put in irons, and confined
  below decks. And keep two armed guards constantly before their door. They
  escaped too easily the last time."</p>

  <p>Vernia was led away to her cabin, and the three men were fitted with thick
  metal collars, to which heavy chains were attached, linking them together.
  Then they were lowered down a hatchway, and marched along a corridor, to be
  thrust into a small and exceedingly filthy room. The door of heavy serali
  planks was barred, and Grandon heard two guards take their places before
  it.</p>

  <p>Soon the anchors were hoisted and the sails unfurled. With the flagship in
  the lead, the fleet once more sailed southward.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch09"
     name="ch09">9.</a> &mdash; THE SECRET GATE</h2>

  <p class="first">The room in which Grandon, Kantar, and San Thoy had been
  confined on the pirate ship was immediately below the deck, hence free from
  the bilge water which swished in the hold below, though not far from the
  offensive odor which arose from it. Light filtered down to them through the
  loosely fitted deck planking, and also shone through several small holes,
  each about two inches in diameter, which were bored high up in the ship's
  side, evidently to serve as loopholes through which torks might be fired. But
  they also acted, to some extent, as ventilators, making it possible for the
  prisoners to breathe the fresh sea air by pressing their noses to them, and
  admitting enough light to partly dispel the cheerless gloom of the humid and
  stuffy interior.</p>

  <p>The chains with which the three men were fastened together by their metal
  collars, were about five feet in length, the gunner being in the middle, and
  Grandon and San Thoy at either end. After they had sniffed the fresh air for
  some time, the three sat down, as if by mutual consent, resting their backs
  against the rough wall.</p>

  <p>"Well, Gunner, it looks as if Thid Yet has us in a tight place this time,"
  said Grandon.</p>

  <p>"We have been in tighter, Majesty," replied Kantar.</p>

  <p>"True. But this arrangement presents a rather knotty problem. In the first
  place, there are two guards outside the door now instead of one. In the
  second place, the wily Romojak has chained us to that carrion," indicating
  San Thoy, "who will surely make an outcry if we attempt an escape. Of course
  we can throttle him, or dash his brains out against the wall, but it would be
  difficult to slay him so quietly that the guards outside the door would not
  hear, and at least suspect something amiss."</p>

  <p>San Thoy shifted his quid of kerra spores and spat through a crack.</p>

  <p>"May I remind Your Majesty," he said, "that I am as anxious to escape from
  Thid Yet as you? I am to be slain by slow torture upon my arrival in
  Huitsen."</p>

  <p>"True," replied Grandon. "Perhaps you will be worthy of our confidence on
  that score, if on no other."</p>

  <p>At this moment one of the guards opened the door to admit a menial from
  the galley. This greasy and profusely perspiring individual carried a tray on
  which were three large eating bowls and three smaller drinking bowls. These
  he set before the prisoners, and hastily withdrew, as if fearful that they
  might attack him.</p>

  <p>When the door had closed behind him, San Thoy quickly rolled up his red
  quid and stuck it to the back of his left hand. Then with his right he dipped
  into his eating bowl, feeding greedily and from time to time taking copious
  drafts from his drinking bowl to wash down the food which he could only
  mumble.</p>

  <p>Grandon examined the mixture in the bowl before him. It smelled savory
  enough, and upon tasting it, he found that it was a mixture of flaked fish
  and chopped mushrooms, stewed together in a sauce that was highly spiced and
  quite peppery. His drinking bowl contained freshly brewed kova, slightly
  weak, but palatable.</p>

  <p>"Not bad for prison fare," he commented to the gunner, who he noticed had
  begun to make good progress with his meal.</p>

  <p>"It's the one good thing about these yellow vermin which I am willing to
  concede. They can certainly cook," replied Kantar.</p>

  <p>"We are fortunate in being imprisoned with royalty," said San Thoy,
  smacking his lips. "We should not otherwise be so well fed." His meal over,
  he deftly flipped the red quid from the back of his left hand into his
  toothless mouth, and resumed his mumbling.</p>

  <p>For many days the three men were kept in their stuffy prison. They were
  fed three times a day, but otherwise saw nothing of their captors. By peering
  through the loopholes they could amuse themselves in the daytime by watching
  such birds, fish, and reptiles as came within their line of vision.</p>

  <p>During this period, however, they had not been idle in attempting to find
  some way of escape. It was the gunner whose ingenuity devised the means for
  the first step in this direction. Although he had been disarmed, he had not
  been deprived of his small packet of tools, commonly carried by every man of
  his profession, which were for the purpose of taking apart and assembling
  mattorks that some times jammed or failed in other ways to work properly and
  smoothly. These tools, like those used by terrestrial watchmakers, were small
  and fine, as the mechanisms on which they were used were extremely
  delicate.</p>

  <p>He began on the lock which held Grandon's metal collar around his neck.
  The task seemed hopeless at first, for the Huitsenni were skilled in the
  fabrication of such things as fetters, weapons, and instruments of torture.
  But after many days of patient work, he eventually had the satisfaction of
  springing the clasp, making it possible for the Earthman to remove his collar
  by simply bending it back on the hinge. Grandon then worked on the gunner's
  collar under his direction, and not being mechanically inclined, took
  considerable time in achieving the same favor for his henchman.</p>

  <p>This done, Grandon suggested that the gunner open the lock on San Thoy's
  collar. The task did not please him, but he was too well trained a soldier to
  quarrel with the orders of his sovereign, and so carried out his distasteful
  duty without a murmur.</p>

  <p>They had got this far with their plans for escape, and were considering
  what their next move should be, when Kantar, who had been standing with his
  eye to a loophole, suddenly informed the Earthman that he saw land.</p>

  <p>Grandon leaped to a hole beside him, and peered out. He saw that the ship
  was entering what appeared to be the narrow channel of a fjord. The rugged
  cliffs, sparsely clad in places with stunted conifers, towered to a
  tremendous height above the placid water, which calmly reflected their
  beetling frowns. Sharp commands and the creaking of pulleys were heard above
  them as the sails were lowered. Then oars rattled, and splashed into the
  water, thrust through the rowing holes beneath them.</p>

  <p>San Thoy had told Grandon and Kantar that Huitsen, the capital city of the
  Huitsenni, could be reached from the sea only by way of a hidden passage
  through towering cliffs. If he had spoken truth, then this was the beginning
  of that passageway, and the time left to them for freeing themselves and
  Vernia, and attempting to escape, was short indeed. The pirate himself
  confirmed this a moment later, as he too sprang up to peer through a
  loophole.</p>

  <p>"This is the way to the secret gate," he said. "Watch, and you will see
  how it is opened."</p>

  <p>Grandon's first thought was that they must immediately attempt escape, for
  once in the notorious port of peril, this would undoubtedly prove impossible.
  Yet a rash attempt now seemed equally hopeless. He had counted on darkness as
  an ally, but it was yet mid-afternoon, and the probability was that the fleet
  would dock ere the black, moonless night of Venus should descend. He had
  expected to strike that very evening, when the cook's helper would bring them
  their repast. Leaving San Thoy to deal with the helper, he and the gunner had
  planned to spring upon the two guards who stood outside the door. Could the
  deed have been accomplished without great noise, the rest would not have been
  impracticable; for under cover of darkness it would have been possible to
  rescue Vernia from her cabin, steal a boat, and be off.</p>

  <p>But now, it seemed, they must make new plans.</p>

  <p>"How soon will we dock, San Thoy?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"In a very short time now, Majesty," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Before dark?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, long before."</p>

  <p>Grandon pondered for a moment. Then he spoke to Kantar. "We'll have to
  think up a new scheme, Gunner. And when the time comes, we'll have to think
  fast."</p>

  <p>"I will look for a sign from you when the time does come," replied
  Kantar.</p>

  <p>"And I, also, Majesty," echoed San Thoy. Then he exclaimed: "See! They are
  opening the secret entrance!"</p>

  <p>The channel had narrowed now, so much that it seemed the ship's oars would
  be shattered against the jagged cliffs. And straight ahead was what appeared
  to be a solid wall of rock, barring their further progress. Astounded,
  Grandon saw that a crooked crack extending medially from top to bottom was
  slowly widening as the two halves of the wall ahead, each of which must have
  weighed thousands of tons, moved apart and slid into the cliffs on each
  side.</p>

  <p>The ship nosed through the opening and into a dark cavern. The lights
  flashed on, and revealed a stalactite-festooned ceiling over head, while the
  peaks of white stalagmites, projecting above the surface of the water, made
  it obvious that the floor of the cave had not always been flooded. Save for
  the gong which timed the strokes of the rowers, and the splashing of the
  oars, the place was as quiet as a tomb, its placid waters gleaming
  mirror-like ahead of the ship, and rippling in the spreading wake like molten
  jet shot with silver reflections.</p>

  <p>Presently daylight appeared ahead, and the ship's lights were turned off.
  A moment later they emerged through a high, arched opening into a canal. The
  straight banks were lined with masonry, evidently to prevent the salt water
  from seeping through and spoiling the crops of edible mushrooms, food ferns,
  and kerra ferns which were cultivated in orderly fields on either side. Those
  who worked in these fields, San Thoy said, were slaves who represented most
  of the races and nationalities of Zorovia, some captured in coastal raids,
  but most taken from ships that had fallen prey to the yellow pirates.</p>

  <p>Swiftly propelled by the lusty strokes of the rowers, and again aided by
  the bat-wing sails, which had been unfolded as soon as the cave mouth was
  left behind, the ship glided into a circular land-locked harbor, lined with
  docks built of serali wood and set on pilings of the same tough material.</p>

  <p>Behind the docks were warehouses of white stone, and beyond these, at the
  far side, Grandon could see the conical roofs and upper structures of what
  appeared to be a large and populous city, principally composed of odd, hive-
  shaped buildings unlike anything he had ever seen or heard of, either on
  Earth or Venus.</p>

  <p>Thousands of queer, bat-winged craft of the pirates were moored at the
  docks, and many more rode at anchor in the harbor. There were also a large
  number of merchant and fishing ships captured by the Huitsenni, and brought
  in as prizes. Some of these were undergoing alterations being fitted with the
  bat-wing sails, and otherwise converted for the use of the yellow men.</p>

  <p>Still peering through his loophole, Grandon saw that the flagship was
  nearing the dock. Soon the long oars beneath him were drawn in, and ropes
  were cast to waiting Huitsenni, who made them fast.</p>

  <p>From almost directly above Grandon's head, a gangplank was lowered
  striking the dock with a heavy thud. Down the plank walked Thid Yet, Romojak
  of the Navies of Huitsen, escorting Vernia. The princess looked deathly pale,
  but showed no other sign of fear. With her head held proudly erect, and
  graceful carriage, she showed only disdain for her squat, greasy captor,
  slouching along beside her. Behind them strode a guard of six pirates, drawn
  scarbos in their hands.</p>

  <p>A great lumbering one-wheeled vehicle, its cab supported on an inner
  idling-wheel at its center, rumbled up to the dock. These vehicles were
  common everywhere on Zorovia, but the beasts that drew this one were not.
  Hitched, one before and one behind the great wheel, they were larger than
  Norman Horses, covered with long white curly hair of silky texture, and each
  armed with three twisted horns, one curving forward from the tip of the nose,
  and the other two arching above the eyes. Their ankles, also were armed with
  sharp bony spurs, projecting toward the front on the forelegs, and toward the
  back on the hind legs. Their hoofs were split into three sections, each of
  which was armed with a claw.</p>

  <p>Thid Yet assisted Vernia to enter the vehicle, then clambered up after.
  The drivers shouted to their beasts, and the huge wheel lumbered away.</p>

  <p>"Where are they taking her?" Grandon asked San Thoy.</p>

  <p>"To the palace, no doubt," the yellow man replied, "where we, too, will be
  taken shortly."</p>

  <p>"If my plan works I'll go to the palace, but not as a prisoner," Grandon
  told his two companions. "We will attain at least temporary liberty if you
  throw off your collars when I raise my right hand, then follow me."</p>

  <p>Grandon saw the loot from his camp, and the weapons and accouterments of
  his Fighting Traveks, carried ashore. Then the door of their prison was flung
  open, and a self-important mojo, accompanied by four guards, all carrying
  their scarbos in their hands, ordered them out.</p>

  <p>They were ushered up a companionway, and on reaching the deck, were forced
  into a line of yellow men who, laden with their loot, were hurrying
  ashore.</p>

  <p>They had reached the center of the swaying gangplank when Grandon suddenly
  raised his right hand. Simultaneously, the three prisoners threw off the
  collars which their captors had, up until then, believed to be locked. Before
  they could act, the Earthman had turned and dived into the water beneath,
  swiftly followed by his two companions.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">10.</a> &mdash; THE PORT OF PERIL</h2>

  <p class="first">Confined in the identical cabin from which she had shortly
  before been stolen by San Thoy, Vernia hoped against hope that Grandon would
  find some way to rescue her. But as the pirates sailed southward, day after
  day, and no word of any kind came from him hope began to fade.</p>

  <p>Day and night, two armed guards were kept constantly before her door, the
  only exit from her cabin. At first she attempted to question them, but they
  would not answer. Then she tried quizzing the slave who brought her meals. He
  was ready enough to converse about her desires in the way of food, but when
  she tried interrogating him about Grandon or about their destination, he
  always professed ignorance.</p>

  <p>Thus was her mind burdened with double anxiety&mdash;for fear that Grandon
  might be tortured or slain, and the certainly that each day was bringing her
  nearer to the lascivious monster who had bribed the Huitsenni to capture her.
  Although no mention of his name had passed the lips of any of the pirates in
  her presence she was positive that the instigator of the plot was none other
  than the pleasure-bloated tyrant, Zanaloth, Torrogo of Mernerum-Zanaloth, at
  the mere mention of whose name comely maidens would shudder, whose scarlet
  suite was notorious throughout all Zorovia, and whose subjects with
  sweethearts, sisters, daughters, or wives of more than ordinary beauty lived
  in constant dread that their loved ones might be summoned to the seraglio of
  the tyrant.</p>

  <p>Her days she spent in gazing out through the small window of her cabin,
  her nights in restless turning and tossing upon her sleeping shelf. But a day
  came when the shutter of her window was closed so that she could not see out.
  Her cabin door, also, was locked. Evidently, she thought, something was about
  to take place on or near the ship which the Huitsenni did not wish her to
  see. A short time later she heard the noises of the bat-wing sails being
  lowered and the oars shipped.</p>

  <p>For some time she heard only the sound of commands and the splashing of
  oars. Presently the oars were unshipped, and there was the grating shock of
  the vessel grinding its side against some solid object. Then came the tramp
  of many feet on the deck.</p>

  <p>Shortly thereafter, her door was unlocked and flung open. Thid Yet stood
  before her. "Come," he said. "We have arrived in Huitsen."</p>

  <p>In Huitsen! Then the reason for the closed shutter and locked door was
  apparent. They had not let her see the concealed entrance to this hidden lair
  of the yellow pirates because she would not be expected to remain here
  permanently&mdash;because she was to be sold into slavery outside the domains
  of the Huitsenni.</p>

  <p>She stepped out of the cabin. There was nothing else for her to do. Thid
  Yet led her toward the gangplank, and a guard of six pirates fell in behind
  them. She glanced around, hoping to catch sight of Grandon or Kantar.
  Concealing, as best she could, her disappointment at not seeing them, she
  walked across the plank with her captor.</p>

  <p>The one-wheeled cart was no novelty to Vernia. She had seen many like it
  in her own country. But the fearsome, three-horned white beasts that were
  hitched to it were creatures she had never seen or heard of before.</p>

  <p>"Zandars," said Thid Yet, noting her look of surprise. "They make strong
  beasts of burden and admirable chargers for our warriors to ride. We get them
  from the White Ibbits who inhabit the Mountains of Eternal Snow, far to the
  south. Let me help you."</p>

  <p>The Romojak climbed in with her, and the heavy vehicle trundled away. The
  six guards trotted beside it, three on a side.</p>

  <p>Traversing a narrow passageway between two stone warehouses, they emerged
  on a broad thoroughfare of heavy serali planking like that of which the dock
  was constructed. The hoofs of the zandars echoed hollowly as from a bridge,
  and the large single wheel of the cart made a sound much like the continuous
  rolling of thunder. This thoroughfare, like those which crossed it at various
  intervals, was lined with tall, hive-shaped buildings with oval windows and
  doorways. Like the warehouses, these buildings were of stone.</p>

  <p>Yellow children, all of them naked and bald-headed scampered from in front
  of the vehicle and then paused to stare at them with their queer, cat-like
  eyes. Bald housewives, unclad save for short leathern aprons which depended
  from their ample waists, paused in their work to gaze at them through oval
  windows or from the doorsteps of their conical houses. Beside each doorstep,
  Vernia noticed that a hole had been cut in the planking, and many of the
  women held lines which hung down into these holes. She could not imagine what
  they were doing until one female suddenly jerked up a flopping, silvery
  scaled fish. She judged from this and the hollow sound of the planking that
  this section of the city was built over the inland sea.</p>

  <p>There were few men about at this time of day, but those lolled against the
  houses or squatted on the doorsteps, squinting apathetically up at the
  passing vehicle. The entire hairless, toothless population, male and female
  from the tiniest child playing naked in the street to the oldest crone
  fishing beside her doorstep, mumbled kerra spores and expectorated enormous
  quantities of the red juice.</p>

  <p>The vehicle rapidly drew near to a towering structure which would have
  made a hundred of any of the lesser buildings around it. Like them, however,
  it was hive-shaped, and built of stone.</p>

  <p>They rumbled through an immense oval doorway and halted. Thid Yet
  clambered down, and assisted Vernia to alight. They were in an enclosed court
  onto which several oval doors opened. Each doorway was guarded by two
  soldiers.</p>

  <p>"This is the palace of Yin Yin, Rogo of Huitsen," said Thid</p>

  <p>Yet. "He has commanded that you be brought into his presence before we
  take you to our rendezvous with Zan&mdash;" He checked himself abruptly, and
  a look of vexation crossed his greasy features, as if he had unthinkingly
  mentioned some forbidden thing.</p>

  <p>"Whether you finish the name or leave it unspoken does not matter," said
  Vernia. "I have known all along that the man who offered your Rogo such a
  fabulous sum for me that he dared the wrath of the mighty fighter who is my
  husband, and the power of unbeaten Reabon, to abduct me, could be none other
  than Zanaloth of Mernerum."</p>

  <p>"After all, what does it matter, Zanaloth or another? You will know soon
  enough in any event. But come. His Majesty is expecting you, and may grow
  impatient."</p>

  <p>Thid Yet conducted her through the nearest doorway, the six pirates
  falling in behind them, and the two guards saluting the Romojak as they
  entered. It led onto a gently sloping ramp which spiraled upward. The ramp
  was paved with black stone dotted with golden studs, which prevented the
  sandals of climbers from slipping as they ascended. At intervals of about
  fifty feet on either side were set ornate golden vessels, half filled with
  sand. Even had Thid Yet not utilized these freely on their way up, Vernia
  would have recognized their purpose by the fact that the sand was stained
  with spots of kerra juice.</p>

  <p>After a considerable climb they came to a level passageway which led them
  to a large oval doorway hung with scarlet curtains and guarded by two yellow
  warriors. The guards saluted smartly at sight of the Romojak with his
  prisoner, and drew back the scarlet hangings.</p>

  <p>Vernia was ushered into a circular room about two hundred feet in
  diameter, and so tremendously high that it had the appearance of a shaft,
  rather than a room. Its walls were of iridescent crystal blocks which
  reflected in many lovely hues the light that entered through four immense
  oval windows set in the top of the conical dome. At intervals of about
  fifteen feet it was circled by narrow balconies, the grille work of which was
  plated with gold and powdered with sparkling jewels. Behind the balconies
  many oval doorways led to apartments on the various levels. On these
  balconies were seated several hundred women and children, evidently members
  of the royal household. The floor was a single immense mirror which reflected
  every detail so clearly and faithfully that when Vernia looked down, it
  seemed that she was standing over a shaft of a depth equal to the height of
  the one which towered above her.</p>

  <p>Vernia was led to the center of this magnificent hall where a circular
  divan, cut from a single block of clear crystal, supported a scarlet cushion
  at a height of about four feet above the floor. Squatting, crossed-legged, in
  the middle of this cushion was an extremely corpulent yellow man, who, except
  for the scarlet cincture about his loins, was clad entirely in jewelry jewels
  blazed from the rings which all but concealed his pudgy fingers and toes, and
  flashed from his golden anklets, bracelets, armlets, and necklaces. Two
  immense diamonds stretched the lobes of his ears almost to his shoulders, and
  a large ruby sparkled on each of his broad nostrils. His bald head was the
  only unadorned part of his anatomy, but shone as brightly as if it, too, had
  been burnished by the royal lapidary.</p>

  <p>Behind the throne stood two muscular guards, each leaning on a huge, two
  handed scarbo that reached from the floor to his chin. And back of these in a
  semi-circle were ranged purple-clad nobles and courtiers, beside each of
  which stood a jar of sand. At each side of the throne stood six slave-girls.
  Two held golden, jewel-encrusted cuspidors which the one at the right or the
  left extended, depending on which way the monarch turned his head when he
  wished to expectorate. Other girls bore the trays of newly opened kerra pods,
  ready for chewing, and still others, jeweled cups and pots of kova which were
  kept hot by small aromatic oil-burning lamps burning beneath them. And a
  young girl, scarcely more than half-grown, held a bundle of scarlet napkins,
  with one of which she wiped the royal chins from time to time&mdash;there
  were four of them&mdash;then passed the soiled cloths to an attendant.</p>

  <p>As Thid Yet came before the throne with his beautiful prisoner, he bowed
  low with right hand extended palm downward, the universal Zorovian salute to
  royalty. Then he humbly waited for the ruler to speak.</p>

  <p>Vernia however, remained proudly erect, returning the appraising look of
  the creature on the throne with one of withering disdain.</p>

  <p>Yin Yin Rogo of Huitsen, spat into the jeweled cuspidor tendered by the
  girl at his right, submitted to having his multiple chins wiped, and then
  turned his cat-like eyes on his Romojak.</p>

  <p>"Are you positive that this slender beauty, just budded into womanhood, is
  the Torroga of Reabon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am positive, Majesty," the Romojak replied. "She answers every
  description, and wears the scarlet and insignia of her imperial house."</p>

  <p>Yin Yin turned to a purple-clad noble who stood near at hand.</p>

  <p>"Fetch the painting," he commanded.</p>

  <p>The man sped away, and vanished through one of the numerous doorways to
  return a moment later followed by two slaves who bore a life size portrait of
  Vernia. She instantly recognized it as having been taken from one of her war
  vessels, all of which carried such paintings before which every sailor and
  officers bowed each morning in token of his loyalty and submission to his
  imperial ruler.</p>

  <p>Yin Yin ordered the painting set up a little to one side then gazed
  alternately at the portrait and the living original who stood before him, for
  some time.</p>

  <p>Presently he said: "It is indeed Vernia of Reabon, for she is, if
  anything, more beautiful than her picture. You have done well, Thid Yet. For
  this we reward you with a thousand kantols of land and a thousand keds of
  gold. We are just."</p>

  <p>"Yin Yin, Rogo of Huitsen, is the fountainhead of justice," intoned the
  courtiers.</p>

  <p>"May it please Your Majesty, I also captured her husband, the mighty
  fighter known as 'Grandon of Terra'," said Thid Yet proudly.</p>

  <p>"So I have heard," replied the monarch. "For this deed we reward you with
  a hundred strong slaves to work your land. We are just."</p>

  <p>"Yin Yin, Rogo of Huitsen, is the living source of justice," chorused the
  courtiers.</p>

  <p>"I have heard, also," continued Yin Yin, "that Grandon of Terra has
  escaped."</p>

  <p>Thid Yet looked dumfounded, but at this news Vernia's heart gave a great
  leap of joy.</p>

  <p>"He escaped," the Rogo went on, "before he reached the dock. Hence you,
  and you alone, are responsible. For this carelessness we commend you to the
  expert offices of our headsman." One of the guards behind the throne here
  shouldered his great, two handed scarbo, and stepped forward, but the Rogo
  held up his hand. "Wait, Ez Bin," he commanded. "Be not so impetuous." He
  turned again to Thid Yet. "If you bring me not Grandon of Terra before ten
  days have passed, then submit your neck to Ez Bin. We are just but we are
  merciful."</p>

  <p>"Both just and merciful is Yin Yin, Rogo of Huitsen," cried the
  courtiers.</p>

  <p>The monarch moved a finger. Ez Bin returned to his post. He moved another
  finger. Two of the six guards who had followed Thid Yet and Vernia stepped up
  beside the Romojak. Then the three bowed low before the throne with right
  hands extended palms downward, and wheeling, left the room.</p>

  <p>Yin Yin, meanwhile, refreshed himself with a cup of steaming kova, and
  stuffed his mouth with fresh kerra spores. He mumbled them for some time in
  silence, ogling Vernia the while, then spat, and said: "We do not wonder that
  a certain torrogo, who shall be nameless, offered us the price of an empire
  for you. You are more than worth it."</p>

  <p>"I care not for your compliments, you yellow filth," retorted Vernia
  spiritedly.</p>

  <p>"Nor we for your insults, my little beauty," replied Yin</p>

  <p>Yin. "You are now but a chattel, a rather spirited chattel to be sure, a
  regular she-marmelot of a chattel, but we like you that way. We have subdued
  many such."</p>

  <p>"To your everlasting dishonor, and their endless shame."</p>

  <p>Yin Yin grinned. "That is a point on which you will find many who will
  disagree with you. We will not argue it. We never argue, for argument with us
  is always futile. It would be unfair for us to argue." He turned to the noble
  who had brought him the picture. "Let me see our contract with&mdash;with
  this nameless torrogo," he commanded.</p>

  <p>"Name Zanaloth of Mernerum, or keep him nameless. It is all one to me,"
  said Vernia.</p>

  <p>"Who told you that?" he asked, sharply.</p>

  <p>"You could never guess, and I shall never tell you," replied Vernia,
  defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Ali well. It doesn't matter. You will know soon enough." He took a scroll
  which the noble extended to him, and perused it for some time. "Hum. It is as
  I thought. This contract says we shall meet him before the harbor of the
  Island of the Valkars, one ship of his and one of ours, on the morning of the
  fourteenth day of the ninth endir in the four thousand and tenth year of
  Thorth. He will have, on the day previous, landed the slaves and treasure on
  the island, where the fear of the Valkars will prevent the former attempting
  to escape beyond the lines of the few guards who will be left to defend
  them.</p>

  <p>"When our commander has satisfied himself that the slaves and treasure
  agreed upon have been left on the island, he will deliver to the Torrogo of
  Mernerum, or his agent, the person of Her Imperial Majesty, Vernia of
  Reabon.</p>

  <p>"It does not say `unharmed', nor is there anything in this contract to
  prevent our taking this Vernia of Reabon to be our handmaiden until such time
  as it may be necessary for her to sail for the rendezvous with Zanaloth."</p>

  <p>He moved a finger, and two of the four guards who stood behind Vernia
  stepped up beside her.</p>

  <p>"Take her to the seraglio," he commanded, "and tell Ufa to prepare her
  this night for the royal visit; for it may be that we will honor her with the
  light of our presence. We are generous."</p>

  <p>"His Majesty, Yin Yin, Rogo of Huitsen, is most generous," chorused the
  courtiers, as Vernia her heart sinking within her, was led away.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">11.</a> &mdash; THE SEA RATS</h2>

  <p class="first">As soon As Grandon's hands struck water, after he had dived
  from the gangplank, he turned them so that his momentum carried him
  underneath the dock. A moment later, his head bobbed to the surface, and he
  had the satisfaction of seeing that Kantar and San Thoy had followed his
  example, as both came up quite near him. From above came the rattle of tork
  fire, the bullets cutting into the water where the three fugitives had
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"You know this place," Grandon said to the yellow man. "Where can we
  hide?"</p>

  <p>"First we must get behind the warehouse," replied San Thoy. "Follow
  me."</p>

  <p>He struck out, and despite his portliness, proved to be an excellent
  swimmer. Grandon later learned that this was a racial and not an individual
  characteristic, as all Huitsenni, being reared on the water, swam fully as
  well as they walked, if not a shade better. Just now, however, he was sorely
  put to it to keep pace with the rotund pirate, while Kantar, the slowest of
  the three, trailed behind them.</p>

  <p>San Thoy swiftly led them through a dark and narrow passage between two
  stone walls&mdash;the foundations of two warehouses. Above him, Grandon could
  hear shouts, curses, commands, and men running on the planking.</p>

  <p>Once through the passage, the pirate waited for the others to come up with
  him. Here it was so murky that Grandon could barely see the faces of his
  companions.</p>

  <p>"They will send boats and fast swimmers," whispered San Thoy, "but if we
  are quiet, it may be that we can elude them. It will soon be dark, and the
  darkness will be our ally. Follow closely behind me, and do not splash or
  talk."</p>

  <p>Once more they set off, with the pirate in the lead. They were in a
  wilderness of posts, the piling that supported the planking of the street
  level, which was about fifteen feet above their heads. The rows of piles were
  broken at intervals of about fifty feet by the circular foundations of
  houses. Many of the fishing holes in front of these dwellings were open,
  admitting considerable daylight. And Grandon noticed that boats were moored
  in front of all of them, while deeply notched poles projecting down through
  the holes formed ladders by which they could be reached from above.</p>

  <p>San Thoy, however, avoided the fronts of the houses with their fishing
  holes, and followed the lanes at the backs of the buildings, where it was so
  dark that objects were visible for only a few feet in any direction.</p>

  <p>They had not gone far when it became obvious that a concerted pursuit had
  begun. Armed Huitsenni everywhere were swarming down the notched poles into
  the boats. Soon they were rowing about in all directions, flashing their
  lights, poking their oars into dark corners, and sending swimmers with knives
  gripped in their toothless gums, to explore the narrow places where the boats
  could not enter.</p>

  <p>At first, it was not so difficult for San Thoy to avoid the searchers, but
  as they became more numerous his cunning was put more and more to the test.
  Time and again the three fugitives were compelled to hide behind pilings
  while boatloads of searchers passed within a few feet of them. Although he
  had no opportunity to question him, Grandon judged that he was making for
  some definite hiding place, because, despite the many twists and turns to
  which he was forced by their pursuers, he continued to lead his companions
  always in the same general direction.</p>

  <p>Presently, however, the three came to a place where it seemed that they
  would be able to advance no farther. Completely surrounded by the man
  hunters, and likely to be spied at any moment, they took refuge in the dark
  shadows of a cluster of piling. Lights flashed all about them, and when the
  beams came uncomfortably close, they submerged until they had passed.</p>

  <p>One by one, however, the boats gradually drew off, until but one remained.
  It contained two pirates, naked save for leather breech clouts. One of them,
  having flashed his light among the piles, nudged his companion and said
  something that Grandon and the two with him were unable to hear. But his
  actions were eloquent of his meaning, for the next moment he and his fellow,
  with long knives gripped in their mouths, slid into the water, and silently
  swam toward the place of refuge occupied by the fugitives.</p>

  <p>So quietly had the pirates entered the water, and so noiselessly were they
  approaching the clump of piling, that had it not been for their light, which
  shown from the prow of the boat, the fugitives would not have been aware of
  their coming. As it was, they were warned, but it seemed that there was
  little they could do, as not one of them was armed. To stand and fight seemed
  foolhardy, and to attempt to escape, worse than useless, for by shouting, the
  two man-hunters could quickly draw hundreds of their companions to cut off
  their escape.</p>

  <p>In this dilemma, Grandon, as was his wont, thought swiftly and acted with
  celerity. As he saw it, there was but one way out, and if that failed they
  were doomed. Accordingly, he whispered rapid instructions to his two
  companions and they took their places.</p>

  <p>As the two pirates stealthily approached the clump of piles, they suddenly
  saw, directly in the path of the light from their boat, the face of San Thoy.
  He gave one frightened look at them, and turned, swimming rapidly in the
  opposite direction. With grunts of satisfaction, the two swimmers struck out
  after him, naturally taking the shortest and most direct route, which lay
  between two large posts about five feet apart. Their cat-like eyes gleamed
  with excitement of the chase. But just as they reached the space between the
  two large posts, two white arms shot out from behind them, and jerked the
  long knives from their mouths. Two keen blades flashed aloft, and swiftly
  descended. Two greasy corpses slipped from sight into the black depths.</p>

  <p>Grandon and Kantar, treading water, thrust the blades into their belts as
  San Thoy returned, grinning broadly.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, "we can travel by boat."</p>

  <p>The three fugitives quickly clambered aboard. The two six-pronged fishing
  spears lay along the gunwale, and in back of the boat was a pile of nets.</p>

  <p>Beneath these, Grandon and Kantar crept. San Thoy removed his insignia
  which proclaimed him a mojak of the Royal Navy, stripping himself down to his
  breech-clout. Then, looking much like one of the fishermen of Huitsen, he
  rowed away.</p>

  <p>Grandon lay in the bottom of the boat beside Kantar, covered by nets which
  were eloquently redolent of recent contact with defunct fish, for what he
  judged to be about half an hour. Then San Thoy stopped, secured the boat to a
  pile, and lifting the nets, said: "Come. Follow me, and make no noise."</p>

  <p>He let himself quietly into the water, and the two followed him. Grandon
  saw that they were not far from the rear of one of the conical houses, and
  that several other boats were moored nearby.</p>

  <p>San Thoy led them to a point directly behind the house, and only a few
  feet from its circular stone walls. Then he said: "Grasp my belt, breathe
  deeply, and prepare to submerge."</p>

  <p>With Grandon on one side and Kantar on the other, he then dived. Opening
  his eyes under water, 'Grandon saw a light glimmering some distance below
  them. They swam straight toward it. Soon they were in front of an oval door
  of thick glass framed with metal, and looking into a small chamber, beyond
  which was another similar door through which the light streamed. San Thoy
  seized a knocker which hung behind the door, and struck it three times. A
  face appeared, framed in the oval door beyond&mdash;the face of a yellow man.
  San Thoy signaled to him with one hand, whereupon he pulled a lever, and the
  door before them opened. Swiftly they were carried in by a sudden rush of
  water, and the door closed behind them. Now they were in a narrow chamber,
  completely filled with water. Grandon was growing air-hungry, desperately so,
  and he saw from Kanar's expression that he was in like case. But San Thoy did
  not appear in the least discommoded by holding his breath for so long.</p>

  <p>The man behind the second door scrutinized the three for a moment, then
  exchanged several more signs with San Thoy, and pulled a second lever. At
  this, panels in the walls on both sides of them slid back, revealing a large
  screened opening, and the water receded so swiftly that both Grandon and
  Kantar, taken unawares, sprawled on the floor. They sprang to their feet,
  thankfully inhaling great lungfuls of the moist air. Then the inner door
  opened, and the man who stood beside it bade them enter.</p>

  <p>They stepped inside, and as the guard closed the door after them, San Thoy
  addressed him.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, warder and brother Chispok. Are the brothers in secret
  session?"</p>

  <p>"They are in secret session, O mojak of the brotherhood," replied the
  yellow man.</p>

  <p>Grandon was astounded to hear these two Huitsenni addressing each other as
  brother Chispoks; for he knew that a chispok was a large, scaly rodent
  inhabiting the sea shore or salt marshes, and spending a considerable share
  of its time in the water, literally a rat of the sea. It was a hideous
  creature, closely resembling its land cousin, the chipsa, and its name was
  formed from the two words, "chispa" and "pok", the latter word meaning "the
  sea". Thus were formed the names "Azpok", or "Sea of Az," and "Ropok", or
  "Sea of Ro". To be called a chispa or a chispok in Reabon, or almost any
  other civilized country of Zorovia, was a deadly insult. But here were two
  men saluting each other as brother Chispoks, without offense.</p>

  <p>San Thoy continued his conversation with the guard.</p>

  <p>"I have brought two recruits for our just and sacred cause, who came from
  the far land of Reabon," said San Thoy. "Your name, brother warder?"</p>

  <p>"Fo San, brother mojak."</p>

  <p>"And I am San Thoy. These are Grandon of Terra, Rogo of Uxpo and Torrogo
  of Reabon; and Kantar the Gunner, a citizen of Uxpo."</p>

  <p>Fo San, apparently noting Grandon's sodden and bedraggled scarlet cincture
  for the first time, bowed low with right hand extended palm downward.</p>

  <p>"The humble warder of the Chispoks salutes Your Majesty, the glory of
  whose deeds of valor has penetrated even to this remote corner of the world,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>Grandon returned the salute, and he and the gunner were invited to seat
  themselves.</p>

  <p>"According to the rules of the order, you must await me here," said San
  Thoy. "I will go and speak to the romojak of the order. I am mojak of a lodge
  at the other end of the city. In the meantime, refreshments will be brought
  to you."</p>

  <p>He walked to an oval metal door at the other end of the chamber, and gave
  three sharp raps. It swung open, and before it closed behind him, Grandon
  heard him exchange greetings with a yellow man on the other side.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, a boy came in, carrying a tray on which were bowls of
  steaming kova, grilled fish, and stewed mushrooms. Grandon and Kantar did
  full justice to the refreshments. While they sat there, eating and drinking,
  two members of the order were admitted to the chamber, and passed through
  into the room beyond.</p>

  <p>Shortly after they had eaten and drunk their fill, San Thoy returned.</p>

  <p>"I have spoken to Han Lay, Romojak of the order," he said, "and he and the
  brethren of this lodge have consented to admit you to our order, or, if you
  are unwilling to become members of the Chispoks, to permit you to depart in
  peace as you came."</p>

  <p>"What are the requirements?" asked Grandon.</p>

  <p>"You are to do all in your power to assist in the overthrow of the present
  regime in Huitsen," said San Thoy. "You are further to make solemn oath that
  you will render assistance to any brother Chispok in danger, even as you
  would have him render assistance unto you."</p>

  <p>"I can see no objections to these requirements," replied Grandon. "In
  fact, I rather like the idea of assisting to overthrow the present regime,
  which certainly has not conducted itself in a friendly manner toward me. What
  say you, Gunner?"</p>

  <p>"I would gladly become a Chispok, or even a sneaking hahoe, did Your
  Majesty recommend it," replied Kantar.</p>

  <p>"Then lead on," Grandon told San Thoy. "The sooner we can become Chispoks,
  and get down to the real business at hand, the better."</p>

  <p>Once more San Thoy gave three sharp raps at the door. It was flung open by
  a bowing yellow man, and they found themselves in a short, narrow hallway. At
  the other end of this, a second door opened at the same signal, and they
  entered a circular room about twenty-five feet in diameter. Squatting on low
  stone benches around the wall were about sixty Huitsenni. A man, older and
  more corpulent than the others, sat cross-legged on a dais in the center of
  the room. San Thoy conducted his two companions before this individual,
  introducing Grandon and Kantar as he had in the antechamber, to Han Lay,
  remojak of the lodge.</p>

  <p>Han Lay rose, and bowed low, before Grandon with right hand extended palm
  downward.</p>

  <p>"The order of Chispoks is supremely honored," he said, "in that Your
  Imperial and Illustrious Majesty has consented to become one of us. We labor
  in a cause just now, which we have reason to believe is your own, and feel
  that with so mighty a fighter and so sagacious a general on our side, our
  cause is all but won."</p>

  <p>"May I inquire to what cause you refer," asked Grandon, "and why you
  consider your cause my own?"</p>

  <p>"We Chispoks have spies everywhere," replied Han Lay. "We are at present,
  endeavoring to overthrow Yin Yin, Rogo of Huitsen. Our spies inform us that
  he has not only kidnapped Her Majesty, your wife, for the purpose of selling
  her into slavery, but that, during the time she is to be kept in this city,
  he intends forcing her into his own seraglio."</p>

  <p>"What!" Grandon's face went deathly pale, and upon his features there came
  a look which made even the brave Kantar feel anxious. Only twice before had
  he seen that look on the face of the Earthman, and each time enemies had
  fallen before his flashing blade like frella grass at harvest.</p>

  <p>"If you will but take me within sight of this filthy beast you call Yin
  Yin," said Grandon, "I will pierce his putrid heart, even though a thousand
  guardsmen surround him."</p>

  <p>Han Lay grinned.</p>

  <p>"That, Your Majesty, is precisely what we intend that you shall do," he
  said. "The Rogo of Huitsen is so strongly guarded that none of our assassins
  has been able to reach him, but we have every faith in your ability. When you
  have sworn the oaths of our order, the brothers will conduct you to the
  palace. Others will smuggle you into a chamber where, sooner or later, you
  will meet Yin Yin, face to face.</p>

  <p>"Administer the oath quickly, then," replied Grandon, "that I may be on my
  way."</p>

  <p>Kneeling, and with their right hands extended, palms downward, toward a
  small image of Thorth, which Han Lay held up before them, Grandon and Kantar
  swore the secret and terrible oath of the Chispoks.</p>

  <p>The oath concluded, they arose, and the brethren crowded around them to
  extend fraternal greetings. But at this moment there came a sudden and
  unexpected interruption. One of the metal doors was thrown violently open,
  and a mojak with scarbo in hand and tork elevated to cover the group, burst
  into the room, followed by a horde of armed warriors.</p>

  <p>The Chispoks were unarmed, save for their knives, hence at the mercy of
  the fully armed invaders, all of whom had torks and scarbos.</p>

  <p>"You are all under arrest for treason against His Majesty, Yin Yin of
  Huitsen," proclaimed the mojak. "Throw down your knives and advance, one at a
  time, to have your wrists bound. Resist, and you are dead men."</p>

  <p>Grandon noticed that Han Lay was edging toward a metal rod which projected
  through the floor of the dais. A moment later he stepped on it. There
  followed a sudden roar of rushing waters, which, in a brief instant engulfed
  both the Chispoks and the Rogo's men, and filled the room to the ceiling.
  Choking and strangling, Grandon was swept off his feet. Then his head
  collided with something hard and metallic, and he lost consciousness.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">12.</a> &mdash; IN THE SERAGLIO</h2>

  <p class="first">After the two guards led Vernia from the presence of Yin
  Yin, they conducted her through a series of hallways to a spiral ramp, which
  they forced her to climb to a height of what she judged to be about six
  stories above the floor level of the throne room. Here, after threading
  several more hallways, they came to a metal door, on either side of which
  stood a tall, thin yellow man leaning on an immense scarbo. These were the
  first thin Huitsenni she had ever seen, and the sight astounded her, for she
  had believed that all of them, both men and women, were short and
  corpulent.</p>

  <p>As Vernia and her two guards came to a stop before the door, one of those
  who stood beside it tapped on its metal surface with the hilt of his huge
  scarbo. It was instantly flung open, and a yellow man, taller than those who
  stood beside the door, and so aged that his face was a network of wrinkles,
  stood before them. He wore the purple cincture, showing that he was of the
  nobility, and his accouterments blazed with jewels. Seeing that Vernia wore
  the scarlet of royalty, he bowed low with right hand extended palm downward.
  Then he addressed the guard on her left.</p>

  <p>"Whom have we here, and what are the commands?"</p>

  <p>"O, Ho Sen, Lord of the Seraglio, this is Vernia, Torroga of Reabon. It is
  the command of His Majesty that Ufa be instructed to prepare her this night
  for the royal visit, for it may be that our gracious sovereign will honor her
  with the light of his presence."</p>

  <p>"His Majesty is merciful, just and generous, and we delight to do his
  bidding," responded Ho Sen. Then he clapped his hands, and two more tall,
  slender Huitsenni came forward. They took the place of the two warriors who
  stood beside her, and the latter turned and marched off down the hall.</p>

  <p>"Enter, Your Majesty," Ho Sen invited with a ceremonious bow. The
  strangely angular creatures at Vernia's sides seized her arms to drag her
  forward. But she shook them off and entered, herself. There was nothing else
  to do. Then the metal door clanged shut behind her.</p>

  <p>Ho Sen led the way across this room through another oval entrance, and
  down a hallway into an immense chamber two stories in height, and shaped like
  a crescent the far end of which was visible from where they stood. On the
  inner side of the crescent, numerous doors led out to little balconies which
  evidently overlooked the throne room, for Vernia could see the iridescent
  crystal walls of the immense shaft beyond. On the outer side of the crescent
  other doors led to sleeping apartments.</p>

  <p>In the immense room were gathered no less than a thousand girls and young
  women. Among them were represented all the races of Zorovia with which Vernia
  was familiar, and several of which she had never heard. It was notable, too,
  that every girl, judged by the standards of her race, was beautiful.</p>

  <p>Save for the tall, lean guards who stood at the doorways, and at regular
  intervals around the walls, there were no men present, and Vernia was
  beginning to suspect that even these were not men. Young slave girls padded
  softly about on the thick rugs, carrying trays of sweetmeats, pots and tiny
  bowls of kova, jars and bottles of cosmetics, combs, brushes, bangles, and
  such other feminine odds and ends as the pampered inmates of the seraglio
  required. Birds sang in gold and crystal cages that swung from the ceiling,
  and fountains splashed musically into limpid pools in which swam curious,
  brilliantly colored fish of many shapes and hues. In lieu of flowers, for
  such things are unknown on Zorovia, there were potted fungi of ornate shapes
  and rich shades, which filled the air with sweet, heavy perfume. These fungi,
  Vernia afterward learned, had been brought to their present state of
  perfection through careful selective breeding and crossing by hundreds of
  generations of skilled botanists. There were also many rare and beautiful
  varieties of ferns, cycads, and jointed grasses.</p>

  <p>Many of the inmates lolled about on low divans, chatting, sipping kova,
  and nibbling at sweetmeats. Others were having their hair combed, their nails
  polished, or cosmetics applied by slave girls. A few were stringing beads or
  doing embroidery work, and the remainder strolled about the place or gathered
  in little groups, laughing and talking.</p>

  <p>With a pompous dignity which showed that he took considerable pride in the
  grave responsibility reposed in him by the Rogo, Ho Sen picked his way among
  the divans, ottomans, fountains, potted plants, and concubines, while Vernia,
  following with her two guards, felt as if on parade. It was plain to her that
  she was immediately the center toward which all eyes gravitated, as well as
  the subject of many remarks and discussions. The various members of this
  assorted aggregation of feminine pulchritude showed different reactions as
  Vernia, who was far more beautiful than any of them, passed. Some gazed in
  open admiration, some cast lowering glances that plainly denoted jealousy,
  others appeared coldly indifferent, and a small remainder, evidently mindful
  of the fate intended for her, looked sympathetic. Accustomed to being stared
  at, she passed among them with easy grace and quiet dignity, ignoring them as
  completely as if they had been so many articles of furniture. But she could
  not help overhearing what some of them said. Many exclaimed at her beauty.
  Others, the jealous ones, made spiteful remarks. And she heard one girl say:
  "Another princess, and as great a beauty as the first It seems that the Rogo
  has lately spread his nets for naught but royalty."</p>

  <p>Having passed about half way around the crescent, Ho Sen led Vernia into a
  private suite, where a young girl sat having her hair done by an old and
  extremely ugly yellow woman. The girl, she noticed, wore the scarlet of
  royalty. She was small, shapely, black-haired and brown-eyed.</p>

  <p>Ho Sen addressed the old woman.</p>

  <p>"I bring another great lady for your ministrations, Ufa. She is Vernia,
  Torroga of Reabon. It is the will of His Majesty that she be prepared for the
  royal visit this night."</p>

  <p>The old trot grinned. "We all love and obey our generous and gracious
  sovereign," she replied, "and Ufa will exert herself to the utmost that this
  damsel may be pleasing to his Majesty's eyes; though, in truth, her natural
  beauty makes the task an easy one."</p>

  <p>Ho Sen went out, closing the door after him.</p>

  <p>The old hag grinned hideously at Vernia.</p>

  <p>"Be seated, my pretty one," she said, "until I have finished with my
  little white bird."</p>

  <p>Vernia seated herself on a nearby divan, and a young slave girl brought
  her a steaming pot of kova and a tiny golden drinking bowl, which she placed
  near her on a small taboret. The girl who was having her hair done smiled and
  spoke to her.</p>

  <p>"I am Narine of Tyrhana, Your Majesty," she said, "and, like you, a
  prisoner here. Shall we be friends? I've heard so much about your remarkable
  adventures, and your gallant husband, Grandon of Terra, that I feel as if I
  almost know you."</p>

  <p>Vernia returned her friendly smile. "I who am friendless in this place,"
  she replied, "would welcome the chance to acquire almost any friend, but in
  any case, I should be, glad for the friendship of the daughter of Ad of
  Tyrhana, comrade of my father on many of his adventurous hunting excursions,
  his staunch ally when seven great nations combined and sought to break the
  naval power of Reabon, and now the ally of my husband. You are the
  Torrogina?"</p>

  <p>"No, I am but the Torrogini. My elder sister, Loralie, is the Crown
  Princess. Perhaps you have heard of her engagement to Zinlo, Torrogo of
  Olba."</p>

  <p>"I have. He visited Grandon of Terra a short time ago, and told us about
  their romance, but he did not mention that she was the Torrogina. You know
  they both traveled to this planet from Mignor at the same time, Grandon
  alighting in Uxpo, and Zinlo, who on Mignor was known as Harry Thorne, in
  Olba. But tell me, how do you happen to be here? Can it be that some
  lascivious torrogo has offered the price of an empire for your
  abduction?"</p>

  <p>"I think not, as I expect to be sold into slavery today to the Rogo of the
  White Ibbits a race of hairy barbarians who inhabit the Mountains of Eternal
  Snow near the south pole. It seems that Yin Yin buys large quantities of
  zandars from this savage chieftain, and that the latter has a weakness for
  comely virgins. Yin Yin has kept me here, unharmed, for the past ten days,
  for the sole reason that he believes I will bring him a tremendous price in
  zandars from this antarctic ruler.</p>

  <p>"But you asked how I happened to be here. About an endir ago I left
  Tyrhana in one of my father's battleships to visit my cousin, Tinia, daughter
  of Aardvan of Adonijar. Three days out, a tremendous storm came up, carrying
  our masts and sails and more than half the crew overboard, destroying the
  steering apparatus and nearly filling the hold with water. In this helpless
  condition we drifted for many days. Then we sighted a fleet of pirate
  vessels. After a brief skirmish with the few warriors who were left behind on
  our ship, they boarded us and took all who remained alive prisoners. I was
  brought here, either to be sold or impressed into the seraglio of Yin Yin. He
  has seen fit to offer me to the barbarian for a fabulous number of zandars. I
  have sought to bribe Yin Yin to return me to my father, but he would not.
  Perhaps I can bribe the hairy chieftain. If not, why then I will die by my
  own hand, for the women of Tyrhana have ever preferred death to
  dishonor."</p>

  <p>Vernia, in her turn, related what had befallen her since her capture by
  the Huitsenni.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Ufa finished with Narine's coiffure. Then she conducted
  Vernia into a magnificent bath of black and yellow marble where she bathed in
  scented water, and was massaged with aromatic oils by two slave girls under
  the supervision of the efficient Ufa. After this, another slave girl brought
  splendid garments suited to her rank, and helped her to dress.</p>

  <p>Back in the boudoir, Vernia had her hair done by Ufa.</p>

  <p>Presently Narine came in, and slave girls brought their evening meal. The
  repast was a sumptuous one, consisting of nearly a hundred tastily prepared
  dishes, from which they chose what they wanted. The napery was of scarlet
  silk, each piece embroidered with the coat of arms of the Rogo of Huitsen,
  and the service was of gold, similarly decked.</p>

  <p>After they had dined, Ufa led them to another, larger room, the reception
  room of the suite, where a slave girl served them with kova. Then she
  departed, leaving them to their own devices.</p>

  <p>With Ufa and the other slaves about, Vernia had kept the thought which was
  uppermost in her mind, escape, entirely out of the conversation. But now that
  she and Princess Narine were alone, she hoped that the Tyrhanian princess,
  having been in Huitsen for some time, might have acquired some knowledge
  which they could turn to their purpose.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think," she said, as Narine filled her jeweled cup with
  steaming kova, "that you, with the wealth of Tyrhana behind you, could find
  someone in this palace, who, for a promise of vast riches, would smuggle us
  away in a small boat? Once at sea, we should be almost certain to encounter
  one of the many ships that must, by now, be searching for both of us."</p>

  <p>Narine sipped her kova thoughtfully. "I have tried that," she replied,
  "and everywhere met with rebuffs. Every person I have tried to bribe has
  informed against me, and Yin Yin lost no time in letting me know that I was
  only wasting my breath."</p>

  <p>"Can it be," asked Vernia, "that these people so love their tyrannous Rogo
  that not one of them would betray him for the wealth of an empire?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," Narine replied "I believe that every subject, from the
  most exalted noble to the lowest slave, fears and hates him. Yet no man dares
  speak his mind, for fear his fellow is a spy, or will turn informer to
  further his own ends."</p>

  <p>"What of the man who has charge of the seraglio? Ho Sen, I believed they
  called him."</p>

  <p>"The man, did you say?" Narine smiled. "Ho Sen is no man, but like these
  other angular creatures who stand about leaning on huge scarbos, is but a
  eunuch."</p>

  <p>"A eunuch wearing the purple? That is strange. And I noticed that none of
  them were short and fat like the Huitsenni, although otherwise resembling
  them."</p>

  <p>"They are all sons of slave women, mostly of the white races, so Ufa told
  me," Narine replied. "Some of them, I understand, are Yin Yin's own sons. Ho
  Sen is Yin Yin's uncle, though the Rogo does not acknowledge the
  relationship, and was granted the purple by Yin Yin's grandfather. He has
  been Lord of the Seraglio for three generations of royalty."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! And does he love these yellow rulers who are the cause of his
  affliction and that of his fellows, so well that he could not be bribed to
  serve us?"</p>

  <p>"I doubt that he loves his master any more than the others, yet I could
  not bribe him. I tried the first day I was brought here."</p>

  <p>"Then there is no way we can help ourselves?"</p>

  <p>"There is but one," replied Narine. "It is a desperate way, to be put into
  practice only as a last resort. But it is efficient. Look."</p>

  <p>She twisted a blood-red jewel from a ring on her finger, and Vernia saw a
  few white crystals reposing in a tiny hollow beneath it.</p>

  <p>"One of these crystals dissolved on the tongue brings death, sudden, sure,
  and painless," Narine told her. Then as she returned the jewel to its place,
  she said: "Yin Yin is careful to keep all weapons out of the seraglio with
  the exception of huge scarbos carried by the eunuchs. If he but knew the
  secret of this ring, then would my last hope indeed be gone."</p>

  <p>"I, too, have managed to preserve the means to a quick way out, if worse
  comes to worst." Vernia drew a small, keen knife from beneath her garments
  and held it up. "This is from the belt of one of the guards who brought me to
  the seraglio. I managed to transfer it to these clothes after my bath, but it
  was difficult with the old hag and the slave girls watching."</p>

  <p>Scarcely had she spoken, when there was a slight rustle of the hangings
  behind her. Then a fat, heavily jeweled hand reached over her shoulder and
  snatched the knife from her, and Yin Yin himself with a wheezy chuckle,
  waddled into the room. Still chuckling, and before she could prevent him, he
  seized Narine's slender wrist, and twisted the ring with the blood-red jewel
  from her finger. Then he dropped both articles into his belt pouch, poured
  himself a cup of kova, and sat down heavily.</p>

  <p>"My, me!" he whispered, grinning toothlessly. "What desperate characters
  we have been entertaining unawares! Poison! Weapons! Bribery! I'm surprised.
  I'm astounded. I'm shocked."</p>

  <p>He tossed off his kova and refilled the jeweled cup.</p>

  <p>Narine said nothing, but there was a look of horror in her brown eyes.</p>

  <p>Vernia, calm mistress of emotions, regarded him with regal hauteur. "I
  perceive," she said, addressing Narine, "that the Rogo of Huitsen has a
  multitude of low occupations. Not content with being a mere thief, robber,
  and defiler of womanhood, he is also that most contemptible of creatures, a
  spy."</p>

  <p>Yin Yin set down his cup with a grunt of surprise, and his cat-like eyes
  narrowed. "Have a care, slave, how you speak of your master," he snarled, "or
  he may decide to have you whipped."</p>

  <p>Still looking at Narine, Vernia replied. "Observe, Your Highness, how
  manly and chivalrous is the Rogo of Huitsen. Ah, what a different song he
  will sing when Grandon of Terra has him by the throat! He has a throat, I am
  sure, though it is concealed beneath his multiplicity of chins."</p>

  <p>"It may be, Your Majesty," replied Narine, taking the cue, "that he has a
  throat but is ashamed of it."</p>

  <p>"Or what is more likely, Your Highness," Vernia responded, "he is afraid
  some honest man will slit it."</p>

  <p>Yin Yin, arrayed in all his finery, had come to play the lover. But the
  most ardent wooer can seldom withstand ridicule, and if he be short-tempered
  and accustomed to having his every wish regarded as law, it is more likely
  that anger will quickly crowd the gentler passions from his bosom. Knowing
  this, Vernia had deliberately set out to bait him. It was evident, at first,
  that she had succeeded even beyond her expectations, for the bloated face of
  the monarch grew livid. A greenish glitter came to his cat-like eyes, and he
  muttered horrible threats. But Yin Yin, although gross and sensual, was a
  master of intrigue and an adept in cunning. And not many moments elapsed
  before he saw through the ruse. Suddenly he ceased his muttering and began
  laughing uproariously&mdash;laughing until the tears coursed down his puffy
  cheeks. After all, was he not complete master of the situation? And mere
  words, no matter what their burden, could not injure him.</p>

  <p>With a pudgy finger he wiped the tears from his cheeks. Then he gulped
  down his kova replaced the cup on the taboret, and shook that same fat finger
  at Vernia.</p>

  <p>"Bones of Thorth, but you will be the death of me yet with your subtle
  humor," he wheezed. "A wittier pair of young ladies I have not seen in many a
  year&mdash;I who see thousands yearly, who come and go with the seasons."</p>

  <p>From that moment on, he retained his good humor, nor could they with their
  keenest sallies or deepest insults penetrate the armor of jollity which he
  had assumed. A greasy, pleasure-bloated, jewel-bedizened monstrosity, he sat
  there, chuckling, boasting, and drinking cup after cup of steaming kova until
  the pot was empty and a slave girl was summoned with more.</p>

  <p>The girl had just departed when there was the thunder of many hoofs on the
  planking of the street below. Yin Yin, with a maudlin smirk, addressed
  Narine. "If the Torrogini of Tyrhana will look over the balcony," he said,
  "it is possible that she will catch a glimpse of her future master. My ears
  tell me that Heg, Rogo of the Ibbits, has arrived with his savage riders, and
  ten thousand zandars for which I have offered to forego the pleasure of
  taming that little she-marmelot, the daughter of Ad of Tyrhana."</p>

  <p>Both girls rushed to the nearest window, and stepping out on the balcony
  peered over. In the courtyard below them was an immense concourse of riders,
  mounted on zandars, wearing cloaks and hoods of zandar skins, and carrying
  long lances in their hands. But such lances! Each had about fifteen feet of
  stout wooden shaft, and a spiral head about two feet in length, connected to
  a globular metal knob. Vernia, herself a leader of warriors, was puzzled as
  to how these strange lances could be used, as it appeared that the spiral
  heads, instead of penetrating deeply when thrust at an enemy, would only
  spring back at the arm that drove them. The riders also carried scarbos and
  knives, but she saw no torks or evidence of firearms of any kind.</p>

  <p>The faces and bodies of the riders were so muffled in their hoods and
  cloaks as to be invisible from above. The majority kept to their saddles, but
  about twenty of them dismounted and entered the palace. And looking out
  beyond the courtyard, Vernia saw by the light of the street lamps that an
  entire street, reaching from the palace to one of the city gates, was filled
  by an immense herd of milling, bellowing zandars, kept in formation by
  mounted Ibbits who prodded the recalcitrant beasts with the butts of their
  queer, spiral-pointed lances.</p>

  <p>Turning away from the balcony, the two girls re-entered the room. Yin Yin,
  now evidently well under the influence of the kova he had consumed, was
  mumbling kerra spores and expectorating the red juice into one of the sand
  jars. His multiple chins stood much in need of the attentions of the royal
  chin-wiper, but he seemed too far gone in drink to notice this detail. He
  looked up suddenly as three sharp raps sounded at a side door.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, thickly.</p>

  <p>Ho Sen, Lord of the Seraglio, entered, and bowed low with right hand
  extended palm downward.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty," he said, "Heg, Rogo of the Ibbits, has arrived, and awaits
  your pleasure at the outer door of the seraglio."</p>

  <p>"Send him here by way of the single corridor, and see that two eunuchs
  attend him to this door," Yin Yin commanded. "There let him wait within call.
  It may be that this barbarian, when confronted with so much beauty at one
  time, will become difficult to manage."</p>

  <p>"I hasten to obey," replied Ho Sen, with another bow and departed.</p>

  <p>A few moments later the same door opened, and there entered a being who
  elicited from Vernia an involuntary gasp of amazement. With his hood of
  zandar thrown back and his great cloak of the same material caught at his
  shoulders, Heg, Rogo of the Ibbits, was a most remarkable sight. He was tall,
  towering head and shoulders above Yin Yin, and symmetrically built so far as
  human standards go, with the exception of his arms, which were not only
  tremendously muscled, but as long as those of an ape. His features, too, were
  regular, and his teeth even and white. Save for his scarlet cincture, and the
  gold and jewel studded straps which supported his knife and scarbo, he wore
  no clothing beneath his cloak, nor did he appear to need any. For his entire
  body, from head to foot, not excepting his whole face, was covered with
  short, white fur.</p>

  <p>Yin Yin rose, as is the universal custom in Zorovia when royalty receives
  royalty, and the two exchanged salutations with right hands extended palms
  downward. Then he ceremoniously presented the savage chieftain to "Her
  Imperial Majesty, Vernia, Torroga of Reabon," and "Her Imperial Highness,
  Narine, Torrogini of Tyrhana," Neither Vernia nor Narine acknowledged the
  introduction, but this seemed to make no difference to the two rulers, who
  promptly seated themselves beside the taboret.</p>

  <p>Yin Yin poured kova for himself and his guest, and they drank. Then he
  said: "Well, Heg, have you brought the zandars?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, Yin Yin," was the reply. "Ten thousand of the most powerful and
  spirited beasts in my rogat are even now pawing the planks of your city in
  charge of my best herdsmen."</p>

  <p>"You are satisfied with the bargain?"</p>

  <p>Heg looked at Narine appraisingly. She shuddered under his gaze, but this
  did not seem to impress him. He had evidently seen many other maidens
  similarly frightened.</p>

  <p>"I am quite satisfied, Yin Yin," he answered. "Come, look at the splendid
  zandars I have brought you, and see if you can find it in your heart to tell
  me that you are not pleased."</p>

  <p>He rose, and led the way to the balcony, Yin Yin waddling after him.</p>

  <p>"What think you of those beasts?" he asked. "And all for one little slave
  girl."</p>

  <p>Yin Yin rubbed his pudgy hands together as the two turned away from the
  balcony and stepped back into the room. "They are indeed fine animals," he
  admitted, "and I declare myself satisfied, but speak not disparagingly of the
  little slave girl. Remember, she is the daughter of a mighty torrogo, and it
  cost me many men and much treasure to bring her here. Moreover, she has
  beauty far above the average."</p>

  <p>"What of this other?" asked Heg, as they sat down once more beside the
  kova. "She also has great beauty, and I would buy her from you. In fact, each
  of these reaches the pinnacle of beauty for her type, the one brunette and
  the other blonde."</p>

  <p>"Your r taste in feminine charms is admirable," said Yin Yin, "as well it
  may be, seeing the number of famous beauties you have had from me. But you
  have always stipulated maids, and she of the golden curls is the bride of a
  torrogo, as you may have surmised from her title."</p>

  <p>"Maid or matron, I care not. For beauty such as hers, I will break my
  rule. Ten thousand zandars more will be yours magnificent as those I have
  brought you, in exchange for the golden-haired one."</p>

  <p>"Nay, Heg. She is not for sale. All the zandars in your rogat, or all the
  countless millions that roam the antarctic wastes could not buy her, for she
  has already been sold for the value of a dozen kingdoms. It but remains for
  me to deliver her and collect my price."</p>

  <p>But Heg was not easily turned from his purpose. Having seen Vernia, he
  meant to have her, arguing, threatening, pleading, and gradually increasing
  his offers, while the two drank cup after cup and pot after pot of kova. He
  at length avowed his willingness to fill all the streets of Huitsen, packed
  solidly to the doorways, with zandars, if Yin Yin would only sell him this
  delectable bit of femininity that, as he expressed it, he might turn at will
  from the dark beauty of the one to the blonde glory of the other.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the two girls, who had retired to a corner of the room,
  whispered together.</p>

  <p>"Never in my wildest fancies," said Vernia "did I ever dream that I should
  become the subject of such haggling as this&mdash;to be sold, offered for
  sale, or bidden for, like a beast of burden."</p>

  <p>"It all seems like a wild nightmare too horrible to be real," replied
  Narine. "Think of it! I have been sold by a greasy rodent to a fur-covered
  savage&mdash;I the daughter of Ad of Tyrhana! Oh that I had kept the secret
  of the ring intact! Now I fear that death will come too late to save my
  honor."</p>

  <p>"My deepest regret is that I, too, betrayed my secret by displaying my
  knife. I could at least have had the pleasure of sheathing it in the foul
  heart of Yin Yin before employing it to still for ever the beating of my own.
  I have but one hope on which to lean and that is a slender one. Grandon of
  Terra is free somewhere in this city, or was when I last heard of him. Though
  he and Kantar the Gunner, his friend and warrior, were unarmed, they may have
  found a way to obtain weapons. If so, it will take more guards than Yin Yin
  possesses to keep them from the palace, for they must know that I have been
  brought here."</p>

  <p>"It is indeed a slender hope," sighed Narine; "for even though your
  gallant husband could win his way to this place, there would be no way out.
  It would be but a death trap for all of us."</p>

  <p>"In that case," Vernia replied, "I should die contented, for there would
  be hordes of enemies to accompany us into the great beyond and stand before
  the judgment throne of Thorth."</p>

  <p>As the two Rogos reached an advanced state of inebriation, their haggling
  became louder and louder, until it appeared that a quarrel was imminent.
  Suddenly, the hand of the savage chieftain flew to the hilt of his scarbo,
  and he sprang to his feet, overturning a taboret. "Sell me this fair-haired
  beauty, and name your own price," he shouted, "but sell her to me you shall
  or by the blood of Thorth I'll slay you and take her for nothing."</p>

  <p>Yin Yin looked at him in drunken wonderment for a moment, as if he could
  not believe his own eyes. Then he clapped his hands. Instantly the door
  through which the hairy one had come, flew open, and two eunuchs ran into the
  room, bared blades in their hands.</p>

  <p>At this, Heg's bravado instantly subsided. Letting his furry hand drop
  from his hilt, he said: "What's this? You call the guard? I did but jest, my
  friend." "Your jest as you call it, has gone far enough," wheezed Yin Yin.
  "We will, however, let it pass as such, and so end the conference. Take your
  slave girl and be gone, for the torroga of Reabon and I would be alone." He
  turned his cat-like eyes on Vernia, and leered drunkenly. "Wouldn't we, my
  pretty?"</p>

  <p>"It grows late, and I must indeed be going," replied Heg. Striding across
  the room, he suddenly seized Narine's wrist and jerked her to her feet. She
  screamed, and attempted to free her arm from his brutal grasp, but he only
  laughed at her struggles. "Come, my little beauty," he said, dragging her
  across the room. "We have outworn our welcome."</p>

  <p>One of the eunuchs held the door open, and the other stood aside from them
  to pass out. Yin Yin, a kerra-stained grin on his porcine features, rose
  ponderously, and waddled unsteadily toward Vernia, drunkenly oblivious to her
  expression of fear and loathing.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">13.</a> &mdash; GRANDON MEETS THE ROGO</h2>

  <p class="first">After Grandon struck his head and lost consciousness in the
  water-filled lodge room of the Chispoks, his senses returned slowly. At first
  it seemed that he was in a vast hall&mdash;that a gigantic figure was bending
  over him, shouting something which he could hear only as a faint sound in the
  distance, and that other immense figures were moving about the room.</p>

  <p>But gradually, as he became more rational, the room and everything in it
  assumed their proper proportions. He saw that he was lying on a sleeping
  shelf in a room much smaller than that in which he had lost consciousness,
  and that the supposed giant was Kantar the Gunner, leaning over him. The
  other occupants of the room were Han Lay, San Thoy, and a half dozen
  Chispoks.</p>

  <p>"Speak to me, Majesty," Kantar was saying. "Only let me know that you
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm all right, Gunner. Let me up." With the astounded and delighted
  Kantar's arm beneath his shoulders, he sat up. His head swam dizzily, but
  gradually it cleared. "Where are we?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Han Lay, who had hurried to his bedside as soon as he saw him sit up,
  bowed and said: "Perhaps I can explain better than the warrior, Your Majesty.
  You recall that we were attacked by the Rogo's soldiers in the lodge
  room?"</p>

  <p>"I remember that, and the flood afterward. Then I must have struck my head
  for all went black."</p>

  <p>"I tried to help you," continued Han Lay, "but as you were not expecting
  the sudden rush of waters you were swept off your feet and carried away
  before I could reach you. Your head collided with the end of a doorway. All
  the Chispoks, of course, knew how to get out, for we had rehearsed it many
  times. San Thoy helped your warrior to escape through the secret door, and I
  dragged you out the same way. The last man out closed it."</p>

  <p>"Then the Rogo's warriors did not escape?"</p>

  <p>"Not one man. But of course it was necessary for us to destroy the
  building, for there will be an investigation, and we have other buildings
  similarly equipped. All this was prepared for in advance. The pulling of a
  lever in this house set off a tremendous charge of explosive which blew the
  place to atoms. We brought you here to my home, in my boat."</p>

  <p>Grandon stood up to test the strength of his legs. Although the dizziness
  assailed him for a second time, he was able to stay on his feet.</p>

  <p>"Permit me to thank you for saving my life," he said. "It may be that some
  day I shall find a way to repay you."</p>

  <p>"You can best repay me by carrying out the plans we outlined before you
  took the oath of our fraternity."</p>

  <p>"I'll gladly do that, and more," replied Grandon. "Give me my
  instructions, and let me start."</p>

  <p>"You will have little to do until the brothers who will smuggle you into
  the palace bring you face to face with Yin Yin. If you succeed in slaying him
  and rescuing Her Majesty, your wife, the Chispoks will not only guarantee to
  help you escape from the palace by the way you entered, but will further
  promise to conduct you out of Huitsen and place you aboard a seaworthy craft
  on the Azpok, with provisions and water sufficient to last you until you
  reach the shores of your own land. Is this agreeable?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," Grandon replied. "But I would be fair with you as you have
  been with us. What of the secret way into Huitsen which I and my warrior now
  know? Would you expect us to keep this secret from the rest of Zorovia, in
  spite of the relentless raids and acts of outlawry which will no doubt
  continue to be perpetrated by your people?"</p>

  <p>"We have provided against that, also," replied Han Lay, "for we are aware
  that any one of the twelve great nations of Zorovia, knowing where we are,
  could easily wipe out Huitsen. However, permit me to point out that, even
  though you saw the secret passageway and how it was operated, you were not
  navigating the ship; hence you have no idea just where it is. You saw that
  the entrance was through a fjord, but there are countless thousands of fjords
  on this coast, many of which look like this one. All we will need to do will
  be to blindfold you and those who are to go with you until you are at sea and
  out of sight of land. The brothers will then direct you how to sail to reach
  your own country, but you will not be able to find our particular fjord again
  in many years of careful searching, unless it be by accident or unusual good
  luck.</p>

  <p>"I might say, further, that in the event of the Chispoks succeeding to the
  point of taking over the government, piracy will be stopped, peace treaties
  will be signed with all the great nations of Zorovia, and Huitsen will be
  thrown open to the ships of the world. It was for this principle that the
  Chispoks were organized. The Huitsenni have been pirates for countless
  generations. Once our nation was as great and powerful as any on Zorovia, but
  now we are among the least of powers. Why? The Chispoks hold that commerce
  has made other nations greater than our own. By the very nature of our
  livelihood we are debarred from peaceful trading, or commerce of any kind
  with the exception of an occasional kidnapping for some lascivious ruler,
  infrequent ransom money for wealthy or influential people captured on the
  high seas and the little we can get for our plunder in trade and goods from
  these shady and grasping merchants who run the double risk of dealing with
  us&mdash;first because they fear we may betray them, and second because they
  may be apprehended and punished by their own people. Naturally they exact
  exorbitant profits, and our illgotten plunder never brings us a tenth of its
  real worth in exchange.</p>

  <p>"The Chispoks are sick of piracy, of this secret slinking from the sight
  of other nations as the hahoe slinks from the path of the mighty marmelot. We
  are weary of the constant bloodshed which is a part of our trade. And it is
  our ambition to place Huitsen on a peaceful footing with all Zorovia, to turn
  our pirate vessels into merchantmen, to have our people received with
  friendship and good will whenever they set foot on a foreign shore."</p>

  <p>"A worthy ambition, and I'll do all I can to further it," said
  Grandon.</p>

  <p>"Good. And now do you feel strong enough to leave for the palace?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly."</p>

  <p>Han Lay led Grandon and Kantar to his private arsenal, from which each
  selected a scarbo, knife tork and ammunition. When both were armed he walked
  with them to the door, and said: "The six brothers here will take you to the
  palace. They have instructions, and you may trust them implicitly."</p>

  <p>Looking out, Grandon saw that the six Chispoks, attired as fishermen, were
  standing in a semicircle, which screened the door and the fishing hole beside
  it, from view.</p>

  <p>"Crouch behind the men and descend the ladder," Han Lay said. "There are
  two boats moored. Each of you is to get into one and wrap himself in a
  fishing net. Farewell, and may Thorth guide and keep you."</p>

  <p>Grandon did as directed, and Kantar followed close behind him. Scarcely
  had they established themselves in the boats, when three pseudo-fishermen
  descended into each, and rowed away.</p>

  <p>Lying in the bottom of the boat, looking up through the meshes of the net,
  Grandon could see but little. The light from the street lamps shone faintly
  through the interstices in the planking above his head, and by means of it he
  could barely make out the outlines of piling and the foundations of the
  buildings they passed. At times the rowers saluted, and were saluted by the
  crews of other small fishing boats, but otherwise they maintained unbroken
  silence.</p>

  <p>Presently Grandon saw an immense stone foundation looming ahead of them
  and stretching to the right and left farther than he could see, in so wide an
  arc that he knew it must be the base of some tremendous building. Then the
  prow of the boat in which he rode slid up on a low dock. A moment later he
  heard another prow grind up beside it. Then one of the pseudo-fishermen
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, thalput of the royal kitchens"</p>

  <p>"Greetings, fishermen," was the reply. Have you brought the fish, as
  ordered?"</p>

  <p>"The fish are here in the nets."</p>

  <p>"Then bring them and follow me."</p>

  <p>Still wrapped in the net, Grandon was swung up to the shoulders of the
  three men, who walked across a low dock and entered a large oval door. After
  following a dimly lighted passageway for some distance, they suddenly turned
  aside into a narrow doorway. A moment later, the other three strode in after
  them, and the door was softly closed. Grandon was set on his feet, and the
  folds of the net were unwound from his body. As soon as Kantar was similarly
  freed, the six fishermen took their nets and departed, closing the door after
  them.</p>

  <p>They were in a tiny room, faintly lighted by a single dim bulb that shone
  from the center of the ceiling. The place had metal walls and was bare of
  furniture. No outlet was visible save the door through which they had come.
  But he who had been addressed as the kitchen thalput, pressed one of a row of
  studs, whereupon a panel slid back, revealing the bottom of a narrow spiral
  stairway, as dimly lighted as the room in which they stood.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," he whispered, "and make no sound. Take care that your weapons
  do not clink against the walls."</p>

  <p>As soon as Grandon and Kantar had stepped inside, the thalput pressed a
  stud, and the panel closed behind them. Then he led the way up the spiral
  stairway. At intervals of about fifteen feet thereafter, they passed sliding
  panels, above each of which was fastened a dim bulb. When they had reached
  the ninth panel, the thalput stopped before it. He pressed a stud, and the
  panel slid back, revealing a dark opening behind scarlet hangings. From
  behind these came the sound of spirited haggling. The thalput pressed a lower
  stud, and the panel slid back once more without a sound, shutting off the
  noise of voices beyond. Then he addressed Grandon:</p>

  <p>"In yonder room," he said, "you will find Her Majesty, your wife, the Rogo
  of Huitsen, and the Rogo of the Ibbits. I gather from the conversation that
  the savage chieftain is trying to persuade Yin Yin to sell your wife to him.
  I leave you here to lay your plans as may seem best to you. If you succeed,
  you will find me at the foot of the steps, and the boats and fishermen will
  be ready to convey you hence: Farewell, brother Chispoks, and may Thorth
  guide your scarbos! Death to the tyrant!"</p>

  <p>As the thalput began his descent of the stair, Grandon said: "My plans are
  made, Gunner, and I want you to carry out your part as ordered, without
  giving heed to what may follow. I will go in and engage those two drunken
  rogos in combat. It will be your part to rescue my wife while I am so doing.
  My positive instructions to you are that, no matter what odds I may have to
  fight, no matter if you see me fall and at the mercy of my enemies, you must
  not join in the fight. Instead bend every effort toward rescuing Her Majesty.
  Convey her down the stairway as soon as possible, and do not wait for me.
  Take one of the boats, and be off immediately, to the place of refuge which
  the Chispoks have prepared for us. If I live I will follow. If not, our chief
  object will have been accomplished&mdash;the rescue of my wife; and you will
  do your best to get her safely back to Reabon. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. But to see Your Majesty go down and not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What! I was under the impression that a soldier was with me."</p>

  <p>"But, Majesty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A soldier obeys orders implicitly."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Majesty."</p>

  <p>"You will so obey."</p>

  <p>"I will so obey, Majesty."</p>

  <p>"Good. Wait here until you hear the clash of blades. Then enter, and carry
  out your instructions to the letter."</p>

  <p>"To the letter, Majesty."</p>

  <p>Grandon pressed the upper stud and the panel slid open. A woman's scream
  and a man's voice saying: "Come my little beauty, we have outworn our
  welcome," spurred him to instant action. Leaping through the panel, he flung
  the scarlet hangings wide, and stepped into the room, bared blade in
  hand.</p>

  <p>At a glance, he saw that he would have four swordsmen to contend with
  instead of two. One eunuch held a door open while another stood opposite him.
  A tall hairy fellow with a white fur cloak was dragging a pretty, brown-eyed
  girl toward the door. And the fat, greasy Rogo of Huitsen was waddling toward
  Vernia, grinning drunkenly.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Grandon, Vernia cried: "Bob! My dearest I knew you would
  come!"</p>

  <p>Yin Yin turned and whipped out his scarbo. Heg, Rogo of the Ibbits,
  dropped the arm of the brown-eyed girl, and also drew his blade, leaping
  toward Grandon. The two eunuchs caught up their heavy weapons and followed.
  There was a clash of steel on steel. Yin Yin parried once and struck once.
  Then his head flew from his shoulders, thudded to the floor, and rolled
  beneath the divan. For an instant the headless body stood there, blood
  spouting from the neck as from a fountain. Then it collapsed, a quivering
  mound of flabby flesh.</p>

  <p>Grandon turned to face three blades. The brown-eyed princess, meanwhile,
  had run across the room to stand beside Vernia. Instead of waiting on guard,
  the Earthman attacked with a brilliant display of that swordsmanship which
  had made him famous throughout all Zorovia. Before his fierce onslaught, the
  three gave way. His blade seemed to be everywhere at once, flashing with the
  speed of lightning.</p>

  <p>Heg was disarmed, almost with the second slash he made at Grandon, his
  weapon flying behind a divan. But he leaped nimbly back, then drawing his
  knife, strove to encircle the Earthman, evidently for the purpose of knifing
  him in the back. Grandon guessed his intention, but was now so beset by the
  two eunuchs with their long, two-handed scarbos, that he could give the hairy
  chieftain but scant attention. Once when he thought the savage Rogo was just
  behind him, he slashed back for an instant with his scarbo, but the blade
  encountered only empty air, and he came near having his head split open by
  the nearest eunuch. He stepped aside just in time, and as the heavy blade
  crashed to the floor, its wielder received a thrust in the throat and
  followed his master into the great beyond. With this fellow out of the way,
  Grandon quickly disposed of the other with a leg cut followed by a swift neck
  blow that sent the head of the slave to keep company with that of the
  master.</p>

  <p>Whirling to face his furry enemy, Grandon was astounded to see that save
  for himself and three corpses, the room was deserted. He instantly came to
  the conclusion that Kantar had rescued both Vernia and the strange,
  black-haired princess. But what he wondered had become of this furry fellow
  from the antarctic? Puzzled, he was about to return to the panel opening when
  he heard a cry&mdash;the voice of Vernia.</p>

  <p>"Bob! The window! Quickly!"</p>

  <p>He leaped through the window, and peered over the balcony railing. Below
  him he saw the hairy chieftain dropping with ape-like agility from balcony to
  balcony, using one arm to swing himself down and holding Vernia with the
  other. The courtyard below was packed with furry warriors mounted on zandars.
  One saddled beast was being led to a point just under the lowest balcony.</p>

  <p>Sheathing his bloody scarbo, and unmindful of the dizzy height, Grandon
  swung himself over the railing, and began dropping from balcony to balcony.
  But before he was half way down, the furry rogo was in the saddle, with
  Vernia, wrapped in a zandar cloak and swung across the bow. He gave a few
  swift orders, then galloped off. With the exception of one man, the entire
  cavalcade followed him. That man sat his mount beneath the lowest balcony,
  evidently left there to slay Grandon, for his long lance with its queer,
  corkscrew head was slightly pointed at the spot where the Earthman would
  shortly alight.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">14.</a> &mdash; KANTAR'S BLUNDER</h2>

  <p class="first">Although Kantar, as soon as he followed Grandon through the
  panel opening, saw that his sovereign was beset by overwhelming odds, and
  would have liked nothing better than to join in the swordplay, he was
  constrained by the strict orders which the Earthman had given him. His part
  was to get Vernia out of the palace as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>Peering through the narrow slit between two hangings, he saw the headless
  yellow body with a scarlet cincture, which identified it as that of Yin Yin.
  Only a few inches in front of him he noticed a jeweled hand and a slim, white
  arm. It did not occur to him that there could be any woman other than Vernia
  in the room. But the thought did come to him that she would surely refuse to
  leave Grandon&mdash;that if he should urge her to go she would undoubtedly
  countermand the positive instructions which had been given to him. He decided
  to carry her off, and explain afterward.</p>

  <p>He thought he could tell precisely where she stood by the position of her
  hand and arm, and acted accordingly. Suddenly jerking the silken hanging from
  the bar on which it was draped, he wrapped it around the slender figure, and
  turning, plunged through the panel opening. Then, carrying his precious
  burden in his arms, he dashed down the winding stairway. Muffled sounds of
  terror came from the bundle but he spoke reassuringly: "Be not afraid,
  Majesty. It is I, Kantar the Gunner. His Majesty ordered me to carry you
  hence quickly. Friends are waiting to help us out of the city."</p>

  <p>The cries and struggles subsided and Kantar quickly reached the bottom of
  the stairway. Here he found the thalput waiting as he had promised.</p>

  <p>"Is Yin Yin dead?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"His head and body just parted company," replied Kantar. "Thorth be
  praised! The tyrant is no morel And his Majesty of Reabon?"</p>

  <p>"Still fighting when I left. He ordered me to proceed without him, and
  said that on no account should I wait for him, but should take Her Majesty
  away from here at once."</p>

  <p>"That scarcely comports with our plans, but he has earned the right to be
  obeyed by all Chispoks. And I'll be on the lookout to help him if he comes
  later. Follow me."</p>

  <p>He opened the panel which led into the small metal-walled room, and there
  stood the six pseudo-fishermen with their nets. Swiftly they wrapped a net
  around Kantar's bundle, and another around the gunner. Then shouldering their
  burdens as before, they filed out into the passageway, the thalput at their
  heels.</p>

  <p>Kantar heard someone coming, and wondered how the two full nets passing
  out of the palace would be explained. But the thalput was equal to the
  occasion.</p>

  <p>"Take your stale fish and feed them to the ormfs," he cried in a loud
  voice, "and the next time you try to force such trash on the thalput of the
  royal kitchen, I'll see that His Majesty learns of it."</p>

  <p>A moment later the two bundles were lowered into the boats, the rowers
  took their places, and the thalput pushed them off. For some time Kantar lay
  there looking up at the monotonous scenery of planking, piling, and stone
  foundations. They traversed a narrow passage between two stone walls, and
  shortly thereafter shot out under the sky. The gunner recognized the harbor
  of Huitsen.</p>

  <p>A few strokes of the oars took them alongside an anchored boat about
  twenty-five feet long. It had a small, low cabin, and was fitted with two
  bat-wing sails. The two bundles were passed up to a stocky yellow man, who
  carried them, one at a time, into the cabin.</p>

  <p>A dim light illuminated the little room, and as Kantar looked up at the
  man who deposited him there, he recognized San Thoy.</p>

  <p>"Both of you must stay wrapped like this for some time," said the former
  mojak. "Where is Grandon of Terra?"</p>

  <p>"Dead or alive, I know not," replied Kantar. "But he slew Yin Yin, and by
  his command I left him there, still fighting, to bring Her Majesty here."</p>

  <p>"The fact that he slew Yin Yin places me doubly in his debt," said San
  Thoy. "We will wait here for him a while, but we must start in time to get
  out under cover of darkness, or I fear we shall not get on without him."</p>

  <p>"I trust that you and Her Majesty will make yourselves as comfortable as
  possible while I go to keep watch on the deck. Under no circumstances must
  you make a noise or uncover yourselves. Yin Yin's warriors may board us at
  any time, and were they to discover our secret we should all die."</p>

  <p>He went outside, and remained for some time in low conversation with the
  six men. Presently Kantar heard another boat come alongside, and scarcely
  dared to breath for fear it contained warriors.</p>

  <p>There was the sound of some one coming up over the side, and whispering.
  Then San Thoy came into the cabin.</p>

  <p>"It is useless to wait longer," he said. "A brother just came to inform us
  that Grandon of Terra is believed to have been carried off by the Ibbits;
  whether dead or alive, they know not. We will start."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure that we will be carrying out his wishes by doing so," replied
  Kantar.</p>

  <p>San Thoy went out on deck, and issued a few commands. The bat-wing sails
  were unfurled and the anchor hoisted. To accelerate their progress, for the
  wind was not strong here in the harbor, the men used oars, while San Thoy
  went forward to operate the steering device, which was shaped like an
  eight-pointed star with a knob on each point and suspended horizontally above
  the compass. The two rowboats in which the men had come were towed
  behind.</p>

  <p>Presently Kantar knew by the disappearance of the breeze and the faint
  echoes which followed every sound, that they had entered the subterranean
  lake. A little later he heard a voice which seemed to come from above
  him.</p>

  <p>"Ho, there. Who goes?"</p>

  <p>"Gar Zin, the fisherman," replied San Thoy, "to catch a killer-norgal for
  the royal table."</p>

  <p>"A moment, Gar Zin. It seems your voice has altered considerably. I'll
  just descend and have a closer look at you."</p>

  <p>"As you please, Excellency," San Thoy replied with studied carelessness.
  "We'll have a bowl of kova in my cabin." He clapped his hands. "Ho, Lin Fan.
  Prepare kova in the cabin at once for His Excellency, Yin Fu, Guardian of the
  Gate."</p>

  <p>One of the men hurried into the cabin. Peering through the meshes of his
  net, Kantar saw the man enter. But he did not approach the small fish-oil
  stove that was fastened to one wall. Instead, he crouched beside the door, a
  knife gleaming in his hand.</p>

  <p>From outside came the squeak of pulleys and the thud of feet on the deck.
  Evidently some one had been lowered to the boat from a station high above
  it.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to my humble ship, Excellency," said San Thoy.</p>

  <p>"Umph. It is as I thought. You are not Gar Zin, my old friend. Who are
  you, and what are you up to?"</p>

  <p>San Thoy assumed a confidential tone. "Shh! Not so loud, Excellency.
  Private business for his Majesty. Come into the cabin and we'll discuss it
  over a bowl of kova."</p>

  <p>"I'll come into the cabin, right enough, but I want none of your kova.
  Lead on."</p>

  <p>After you, Excellency."</p>

  <p>"I said, lead on!" There was the sound of a scarbo being whipped from its
  sheath. "I'll keep this point at your back, and at the first sign of
  treachery, you die."</p>

  <p>"As you wish, Excellency." San Thoy's tone was exceedingly humble.</p>

  <p>Peering through the meshes, Kantar saw San Thoy enter the cabin, followed
  by a large yellow man who wore the purple cloak and shining helmet of conical
  shape. In his hand he carried a scarbo, the point of which was directed at
  San Thoy's back.</p>

  <p>Just as Yin Fu stepped through the door San Thoy threw himself face
  downward on the floor. At the same moment, a knife flashed from beside the
  door, and the guardian of the gate collapsed with a grunt of anguish.</p>

  <p>San Thoy leaped to his feet. For a moment he bent and held his hand over
  the heart of the fallen noble. Then he removed the purple cloak and helmet,
  and donned them. Going out on deck, he shouted in excellent imitation Yin
  Fu's voice: "It's all right, warriors. Open the gate. I'm going out with my
  old friend, Gar Zin, to drink a bowl or two with him, and have a try at
  norgal. Look well to your tasks until I return."</p>

  <p>There followed a whirring of hidden machinery, and a sliding sound as of
  stone over metal. Then the rowers bent to their oars. San Thoy, meanwhile,
  discarded the helmet and cloak in the cabin, and hurried out to take his
  place on the steermen's seat. Soon the boat began rocking with considerable
  violence. Shortly thereafter the rowers ceased their efforts, and Kantar knew
  that they were now afloat on the' open Azpok, and plunging forward under the
  impetus of a stiff breeze.</p>

  <p>Presently San Thoy gave the steersman's seat to another, and entered the
  cabin. "We'll have to put out the light for awhile," he said. "They will use
  a glass on us from the shore, and we don't want them to know in which
  direction we are going. At least you will not have to stay trussed up in
  these nets any longer, and I can dispose of that," pointing to the corpse of
  Yin Fu. He looked around the cabin for a moment as if to fix the location of
  everything in his mind. Then he put out the light, and the gunner heard him
  dragging his grisly burden out of the cabin, heard a splash, and knew that
  the remains of Yin Fu had gone to feed the denizens of the Azpok.</p>

  <p>Kantar quickly rolled out of his net, and went over to where his precious
  bundle lay. "If you don't mind, I'll help you out of this, Your Majesty," he
  said. "I'm sure you will be more comfortable."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I shall," was the reply. "You have been very kind."</p>

  <p>The gunner was startled at the sound of the voice. It did not sound like
  that of Vernia. But he thought she might have taken cold from this unwonted
  exposure. Then, too, her voice would sound differently, muffled in the
  hanging.</p>

  <p>"You have been very brave Majesty," he replied, as he unwound the net.
  "Perhaps this silk around you will add to your comfort. The breeze is
  chill."</p>

  <p>He adjusted the silken drape around the shapely shoulders. A soft hand
  touched his and thrilled him unaccountably. It gave him rather a guilty
  feeling, that thrill, but he could no more help it than he could help
  breathing.</p>

  <p>"Ho, Gunner. Can you help me with the boat? The crew is leaving."</p>

  <p>"Coming, San Thoy," was the reply. He felt his way to the door in the
  pitch blackness, then stepped out on deck. Outside it was fully as dark as in
  the cabin. Nothing whatever was visible except the occasional glint of a star
  through a rent in the ever-present cloud envelope.</p>

  <p>A hand was laid on his arm. "Let me guide you," said San Thoy, whose cat-
  like pupils enabled him to see by the faint flashes of starlight. "Sit here,
  so, and take these ropes in your hands. Now pull the right or left rope, or
  both, as I may direct. I will steer.</p>

  <p>"Where are the brothers?" asked Kantar.</p>

  <p>"They were leaving when I called you. They will reach the two boats, and
  return to Huitsen by a roundabout way known only to the Chispoks."</p>

  <p>"I trust that they will not lose their lives for this night's work."</p>

  <p>"There is little danger. Their part in the affair is not known. Also it is
  possible that the Chispoks may be in power when they return."</p>

  <p>"But what of you?"</p>

  <p>"I will accompany you back to Reabon. In Huitsen I am a fugitive, but in
  your country I feel that I shall be welcome after this night's work. Later,
  if and when the Chispoks assume control of Huitsen, I shall return."</p>

  <p>"No one will be more welcome," replied the gunner, "unless it be Grandon
  of Terra himself."</p>

  <p>They sailed on and on into the moonless Zorovian night, and Kantar, who
  was aware of the almost uncanny skill with which the Huitsenni navigated
  their boats, did not doubt that they were heading in the right direction.</p>

  <p>Presently San Thoy said: "We could have a light now, as we are out of
  sight from shore, But it is scarcely worth while, as morning will soon
  dawn."</p>

  <p>A few moments later a faint blood-orange tint marked the outlines of the
  eastern horizon, swiftly followed by the full blaze of cloud-filtered morning
  light.</p>

  <p>"There are provisions and kova in the cabin," said San Thoy. "Perhaps you
  will prepare breakfast for Her Majesty. It is best that I continue to steer
  for yet a while. The breeze is quite steady now, so you may lash the
  ropes."</p>

  <p>"If my nose doesn't deceive me," replied the gunner, who was closer to the
  cabin than San Thoy, "breakfast is already being prepared. However, I'll go
  and assist."</p>

  <p>Making the two ropes fast, he got up and went to the cabin. Pausing to
  make obeisance to his Torroga, he gasped in sudden astonishment at sight of a
  slender, dark-haired girl bending over the fish-oil burner, from the top of
  which came the fragrant aroma of brewing kova and the savory odor of a well-
  seasoned meat and mushroom stew. As the morning was chill, the girl still
  wore the silken curtain draped around her, concealing her garments but not
  the graceful lines of her slim body.</p>

  <p>"Bones of Thorth!" he exclaimed. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>She looked up, her face slightly flushed by the heat from the stove, and
  Kantar gasped again; for never, he thought, had he seen a face so beautiful.
  At first her eyes flashed imperiously, almost angrily, at the abruptness and
  bluntness of his question. But suddenly the icy look melted, was replaced by
  a winning smile.</p>

  <p>"My name is Narine," she replied. "And you, I believe, are Kantar the
  Gunner."</p>

  <p>Kantar's wonder deepened. For a moment he was wholly under the spell of
  those big brown eyes. Then he remembered his duty&mdash;the trust with which
  his sovereign had charged him.</p>

  <p>"Where is Her Majesty of Reabon?" he asked. "And how did you get on this
  boat?"</p>

  <p>"Her Majesty," replied Narine, "was watching the brilliant swordplay of
  her valiant husband when I last saw her. As for your other question, who
  should know more about how I got here than you, who brought me?"</p>

  <p>"I brought you!" His heart sank. "Then I have failed in my trust."</p>

  <p>Instantly she saw the look of dejection on his face, and answered with one
  of sympathy.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said. "I see now that there has been a dreadful mistake.
  Would that I had known this when you seized me there in the seraglio! Her
  Majesty had mentioned your name to me. We had planned to escape together. But
  naturally I did not know His Majesty's plans&mdash;or yours. When you told me
  your name and asked me to be quiet I believed that it was your intention to
  rescue me&mdash;that Grandon of Terra would look out for his own."</p>

  <p>"So he would, ordinarily;" replied Kantar. "But he was sorely beset. My
  orders were to bring away his wife; to stay out of the fight for that sole
  purpose, no matter how the odds went against him. And I brought you!"</p>

  <p>"I'm terribly sorry&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Sorry! You should have known. Didn't I address you as `Your Majesty'? Did
  not that tell you whom I believed I was carrying?"</p>

  <p>"Truly it did not. I thought you had taken me for a torroga instead of
  &mdash;that is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I take you for a torroga?" He laughed mirthlessly. "You, a mere slip of a
  girl?"</p>

  <p>"I'm eighteen," she retorted.</p>

  <p>"So? And what of it? I would never take you for a torroga."</p>

  <p>For a moment the shadow of a smile hovered on her features. But it only
  angered him the more. He had made a mistake, a most horrible mistake which he
  felt that Grandon, if still alive, could never pardon&mdash;a mistake,
  moreover, for which he felt positive he could never forgive himself. A
  thousand fears assailed him. Torturing pictures flashed through his mind.
  Grandon dead, his head adorned a pike before the Ibbit palace, or if alive, a
  slave of the savage chieftain from the Mountains of Eternal Snow. Vernia the
  plaything of this barbarous rogo, or, if she had been left in the seraglio,
  of Yin Yin's successor! For a moment he struggled to master his unreasoning
  anger against this girl who had been the unwitting cause of his failure to
  keep trust. Then he said: "From what country do you hail?"</p>

  <p>"From Tyrhana," she replied. "Won't you sit down at the table and let me
  serve you?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," he answered. "I'll admit that I'm hungry, thirsty, and
  weary."</p>

  <p>She set food and drink before him. He sipped his kova. "You brew an
  excellent bowl," he told her, and tasting his stew: "This food is not half
  bad."</p>

  <p>She smiled. "The Tyrhanians are a maritime people," she replied, "and
  should know how to prepare seamen's rations.</p>

  <p>"I forgot," he said. "San Thoy must be hungry. Ill take food and drink to
  him before I begin."</p>

  <p>"No, let me. I've been resting all night, and I'll confess that I tasted
  the stew and the kova." She set the things on a tray and went out, while the
  gunner addressed himself to his provender. Presently she returned, poured
  herself a bowl of kova, and took a helping of stew. Then she sat down
  opposite him.</p>

  <p>"A lovely morning." she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Is it?" he replied, absently. "I've been thinking about you, wondering
  what I'm going to do with you."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You see I haven't time to take you all the way to Tyrhana. I must go
  back to Huitsen, to do what I can to help their Majesties of Reabon, if
  indeed they are not beyond all human help."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I could get you some assistance from Tyrhana. You see," she
  suggested, "my father&mdash;that is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No use," he replied. "Tyrhana is on the opposite side of the world. By
  the time we went there and returned&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But Tyrhana has great fleets, even now, scouring every sea on the globe
  in search of&mdash;a lost princess."</p>

  <p>"A lost princess!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Some time ago the Torrogini set sail in one of her father's
  battleships. She has not been heard from since. Naturally, the Torrogo, who
  loves his daughters beyond all else is bending every effort to find her."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," replied Kantar. "But the chances are much against our meeting
  any of his ships on the broad Azpok."</p>

  <p>"You forget," reminded Narine, "that Tyrhana has the mightiest navy on all
  Zorovia."</p>

  <p>"Reabon has a navy second only to that of Tyrhana," replied Kantar, "and
  her ships are now scouring the Azpok; Yet I do not place much reliance on the
  chance of meeting any of them. Besides&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by a shout from San Thoy. "Gunner. Bring the glass. I
  believe we are pursued."</p>

  <p>Kantar snatched the spy-glass from the rack behind him, and hurried out on
  deck. He saw a ship coming from the southwest, and a sail looming above the
  southeast horizon. Quickly focusing the glass on the sail, he saw a lookout
  at the masthead, his glass trained directly on them. A glimpse at the other
  ship was sufficient to show him that they were being chased from this
  quarter. Even as he looked, two mattork crews were going into action on the
  forward deck. A moment later, a shell screamed overhead, and another exploded
  in the water about two hundred feet behind them.</p>

  <p>"Poor marksmanship," he commented coolly. "But I suppose they'll get the
  range presently. Would that I had a mattork with which to reply!"</p>

  <p>"We have two," said San Thoy, "one fore and one aft. Pull up the ring in
  the after-deck."</p>

  <p>Kantar hurried back and did as requested. The square of the deck to which
  the ring was attached came up and tilted forward. It was plated beneath with
  metal, forming a bullet-proof shield. And behind this shield there appeared a
  shiny new mattork mounted on its tripod, with cases for the projectile clips
  and gas clips.</p>

  <p>Quickly the gunner opened the breech, inserting a gas clip and a shell
  clip marked "explosive." There were other shell clips marked "solid," but for
  the present, he ignored these. Closing the breech, he knelt, and taking
  careful aim, pressed the firing button. One of the mattork crews on the
  approaching ship disappeared a moment later, as if by magic.</p>

  <p>The shells from the other mattork, as well as from the heavier turret
  mattorks of the pursuing craft, were screaming around them in vast numbers,
  and kicking up tremendous geysers in the sea on all sides. He heard a voice
  at his side: "May I help you?" Turning, he looked in the wistful brown eyes
  of Narine. She did not appear to realize their danger, for there was no trace
  of fear in her expression. "I can hand you the clips."</p>

  <p>"Get back into the cabin, you little fool!" he told her. Not waiting to
  see if she would obey, he once more turned his attention to the enemy. A
  second well-placed shot wiped out the other mattork crew, and he noted with
  grim satisfaction that no more came out on the deck. Perhaps the pirates
  realized now with whom they had to deal. The heavier turret mattorks, though
  their projectiles could do incalculably greater damage, could not be aimed
  nearly so accurately as the lighter deck weapons such as he used.</p>

  <p>By this time the other pirate ship was in full view. Evidently its
  commander had seen what happened on the other vessel, for he ordered out only
  one deck mattork crew. The gunner quickly obliterated it, and had the
  satisfaction of seeing that this commander, also, was wise enough to use only
  his turret mattorks thereafter.</p>

  <p>"Splendid shooting." Again he heard that voice behind him.</p>

  <p>He turned savagely. "I thought I told you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Very well. I'll go. You needn't glare at me so. Besides, if one of those
  big shells should strike us, the cabin would be no safer than the deck. I'll
  go forward and talk to San Thoy, who can't be more disagreeable."</p>

  <p>Kantar removed the clip of explosive shells and inserted one of solid
  shot. He would try to let some water into these ships. That would slow them
  up. He took aim, and held his finger on the firing button. The weapon poured
  forth a steady stream of projectiles. When the clip was empty, he inserted
  another, and riddled the other ship below the water line. The enemy shells
  were screaming closer, and in larger numbers. Only one shell, he knew,
  properly placed, would completely destroy their little craft.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he heard their own forward mattork go into action. Looking back
  over the low roof of the cabin, he saw that San Thoy was still steering. Then
  he knew that Narine was operating that mattork. Moreover, she was using
  explosive shells, and had scored several hits.</p>

  <p>Having punctured both ships below their water lines, Kantar decided to try
  to cripple their masts. Accordingly he reloaded, this time with explosive
  shells. As he bent to his task, his hands worked almost mechanically. He was
  thinking, not of their danger, not even of Grandon and Vernia. Strange to
  say, the thought that dominated his mind at the moment was, that Narine was
  very beautiful.</p>

  <p>He was suddenly recalled to stark reality as a solid projectile struck
  their own mast, carrying it overboard, and leaving them at the mercy of their
  pursuers.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">15.</a> &mdash; BEASTS OF THE ANTARCTIC</h2>

  <p class="first">Although he plainly saw the Ibbit warrior left to slay him
  by the savage chieftain who had abducted Vernia, Grandon continued to drop
  swiftly from balcony to balcony as if contemptuous of his furry enemy. As his
  feet struck the lowest balcony, the long lance with its corkscrew head was
  thrust at him, and he now saw its purpose and how deadly it could be, for the
  warrior pulled a small lever like a trigger, as he thrust, and the head
  whirled so rapidly that its outlines blurred.</p>

  <p>He leaped lightly aside just in time to avoid that whirling deadly point.
  Then before the Ibbit could draw it back for a second thrust, he whipped out
  his scarbo, and extending the point, dived straight over the railing at his
  enemy.</p>

  <p>Taken completely by surprise at this daring and desperate move of the
  Earthman, the furry fighter tried to dodge the swiftly descending point. But
  he moved too late. With the full weight of Grandon behind it, the blade of
  the scarbo was driven through his body up to the hilt, and he lunged out of
  the saddle.</p>

  <p>Grandon and the corpse of his would-be slayer struck the ground together.
  Withdrawing his scarbo, the Earthman sprang to his feet. To his
  consternation, he saw that the blade had been snapped off about ten inches
  from the hilt. Then he noticed that his 'fallen foe wore a scarbo, and
  quickly appropriated it. He also took his huge cloak and hood of zandar fur,
  his long fur boots and gauntlets, and his lance.</p>

  <p>By this time Heg, Rogo of the Ibbits and his warriors, were half-way to
  the city gate. Grandon knew that the only possible way to catch them would be
  for him to mount and ride the strange and formidable looking beast whose
  rider he had just slain. The creature was evidently well trained; for despite
  the fight which had brought it a change of masters, it kept its place beneath
  the balcony, complacently chewing its cud.</p>

  <p>On Earth Grandon had been accounted a good rider, but here were beast and
  equipment both of which were new to him. The savage-looking mount was
  saddled, but wore neither bridle nor halter. He had no idea how it could be
  guided, started, or stopped, but there was nothing for him except to climb
  into the saddle and investigate: This he did.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," he said, in Patoa. Without moving, the beast continued its
  contented cud-chewing. Instinctively, he dug his heels into its sides as if
  he had worn spurs. So suddenly that he was almost unseated, the zandar sprang
  forward. But it was going in the wrong direction. How to turn it was the next
  problem. He tried slapping its neck, first on one side, then on the other,
  without effect. Then he tried pressing alternately with the right and left
  knees with no result. Baffled, he grasped the creature's mane, determined to
  spring from the saddle and follow the Ibbits on foot. Instantly the beast
  slowed down and stopped.</p>

  <p>If he could only find out how to turn the creature! Once more he dug his
  heels into its sides and the animal sprang forward. He heard someone shout,
  and turned to see who it was. A group of Huitsenni had discovered the dead
  Ibbit beneath the balcony. But when he turned, he advanced his right foot and
  drew back his left. Instantly the zandar whirled to the left. Quickly he
  returned his feet to the normal position, whereupon the beast settled down to
  a straight course. He advanced his left foot and drew back his right, and the
  zandar turned to the right. Now able to guide his strange mount, he set off
  in swift pursuit of the Ibbits.</p>

  <p>The hoofs of his speeding zandar beat a rumbling tattoo on the planking of
  the broad street, and he dug his heels into its sides to urge it to greater
  efforts. The Ibbits, he observed, had been stopped at the city gate. The
  mojak of the guard was evidently suspicious because of their abrupt
  departure.</p>

  <p>Grandon wondered if the body of Yin Yin had been discovered. Probably not,
  he thought, as the room in which he had been slain was segregated from the
  others; and of those who had witnessed his death, there had been none left
  alive to carry the news. It would be discovered eventually, of course. But in
  the meantime, the Ibbits might be well away from the city.</p>

  <p>He was about a quarter of a mile from the party of Ibbits he was striving
  to catch when he saw the gates thrown open. A moment later, the boom of a
  mattork sounded from the direction of the palace, and a shell screamed over
  his head. Then he knew that the body of Yin Yin had been discovered. The
  firing of the mattork was evidently a signal to the mojak of the guard, who
  threw a party of his warriors in front of the Ibbits and tried to close the
  gates.</p>

  <p>Instantly, the Ibbits couched their long lances, and charged. There was a
  popping of tork fire from the thin line of guards, but they were swept away
  like straw before a gale. Some were trampled underfoot, some were gored by
  the horns of the charging beasts, and the rest impaled and swung off their
  feet on the long lances, to be thrown over the head of the first-line riders
  and trampled beneath the hoofs of the cavalcade that followed.</p>

  <p>In his anxiety to catch that charging column, Grandon dug his heels into
  the ribs of his mount with all his might. But the beast, evidently traveling
  at its utmost speed already, did not respond in any way except to grunt
  angrily.</p>

  <p>He arrived at the gate about a hundred yards behind the last Ibbit in the
  column, in a hail of mattork shells from the palace. A single man barred his
  way&mdash;the mojak. Evidently all the others had been slain.</p>

  <p>Elevating the muzzle of his tork, the officer sent a bullet uncomfortably
  close to Grandon's ear. Couching his lance, he pulled back the lever, and the
  corkscrew head began revolving with terrific speed. It struck the mojak in
  the middle, and instantly drilled through him, up to the knob. Not knowing
  how to release his weapon from the body, Grandon dropped it, and stooping
  from the saddle, caught up another which was lying beside a dead Ibbit. With
  this he experimented as he hurried forward to join the furry savages. He
  found that when the lever was pulled back, the head revolved clockwise,
  literally screwing itself into its victim. When the lever was perpendicular
  to the shaft, it stopped, but when it was pushed forward, the head
  immediately revolved in a counter-clockwise direction, thus swiftly
  unscrewing itself from anything in which it might be embedded. This explained
  how the Ibbits were able to impale their victims and then hurl them over
  their heads without losing their lances.</p>

  <p>The last faint glow from the city lights was disappearing as Grandon
  caught up with the rear guard of the Ibbits. Now, at intervals of about fifty
  feet in the column, riders lighted torches. Muffled up as he was, however,
  with the hood throwing his features into shadow, Grandon did not fear
  recognition unless the sound of his voice or his accent should make someone
  suspicious. Suddenly a rider beside him turned and put him to the test: "Did
  you slay the strange warrior?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Grandon pretended to be seized with a fit of coughing. Then, in the
  rasping tones of a man whose vocal cords have not yet recovered from such an
  attack, he replied: "I ran him through the heart. He will trouble us no
  more."</p>

  <p>"Good!" exclaimed the rider, evidently unsuspicious. "His Majesty was
  worried about that fellow. He feared that he would find a way to follow, and
  come upon him by stealth. You will be well rewarded."</p>

  <p>Grandon smiled to himself, and made no further comment. Far up hear the
  front of the column he saw a rider carrying a fur-covered bundle which he
  believed to be Vernia. But he did not deem it advisable to ride too near the
  Rogo just yet. There might be questions to answer, and he felt sure that,
  sooner or later, his voice would betray him unless he could manage to keep
  from speaking.</p>

  <p>Presently they entered a belt of tall trees, primitive conifers, where the
  trail began to slant sharply upward. Here the beasts slowed down to a walk,
  though they did not seem greatly inconvenienced by the steepness of the
  ascent.</p>

  <p>As they climbed higher and higher, the air kept growing colder, until
  Grandon, who had been uncomfortably warm in his furs when on the low ground,
  was now thankful for them. Soon he noticed that the ground was powdered with
  a white substance. It was snow, the first he had seen on Venus. Also, he
  began to be aware of furtive, slinking forms flitting among the tree trunks,
  trotting beside the cavalcade. Their eyes glowed weirdly green in the
  torchlight, but it was some time before he could make out what they were.
  Then one, bolder than the rest, approached to within fifty feet of the
  riders, and he got a good look at it. It was a white awoo. Some time later he
  caught sight of a white marmelot, tearing at the carcass of some beast it had
  slain. And he began to wonder if all creatures, here in the Zorovian
  antarctic, were white.</p>

  <p>The snow grew deeper as they advanced, and the trees more stunted.
  Presently they crossed a narrow ridge and filed out onto level ground&mdash;a
  snow-covered plateau, its bleak surface swept by a bitterly cold wind laden
  with powdered ice particles that pricked the skin like needles. Here, despite
  the deep snow, the zandars made good progress. This was their natural
  habitat, and they were equipped for it. Their broad, three-toed feet kept
  them from sinking deeply, and with their thick, silky coats, Grandon judged
  that they were more comfortable than in the lower, warmer country.</p>

  <p>All through the night, the shaggy beasts kept up their tireless pace. But
  when morning dawned, the cavalcade halted in a little clump of stunted trees
  that afforded some protection from the wind, for rest and refreshment.</p>

  <p>The zandars, with their saddles still on them, were turned loose to shift
  for themselves. Grandon saw them eagerly devouring a species of purple moss
  that grew on top of the snow and sent long, thread-like roots to the soil,
  far below. They also browsed on such aromatic shoots as they were able to
  reach on the lower branches of the trees.</p>

  <p>Soon the Ibbits had a fire crackling. Then two huge pots were set upon it
  and snow was shoveled into them to melt. As soon as sufficient water was thus
  obtained, strips of frozen meat were dropped into the larger of the two pots,
  and chopped kova roots into the smaller. Vernia was placed near the fire. The
  rogo sat near her, endeavoring to engage her in conversation, but without
  success. On the other side of the fire the warriors sprawled in a semicircle,
  chatting, laughing, and eagerly watching the operations of two of their
  number who were acting as cooks.</p>

  <p>With the coming of the dawn, Grandon had been especially careful to keep
  his hood pulled forward, so that his features would not be noticed. Now, as
  he sat among the warriors, he kept his head bowed as an additional
  precaution.</p>

  <p>Presently the two cooks went among the men, serving the stewed meat and
  steaming bowls of kova. Grandon found the meat tough and rather tasteless,
  but welcome, nevertheless, after his long ride. The kova was well brewed, and
  refreshing.</p>

  <p>After they had eaten and drunk, the warriors stretched out in the snow to
  sleep. Grandon, perforce, followed their example for fear of becoming
  conspicuous, but managed to turn his head so that he could watch Vernia and
  the Rogo. The chieftain, after unsuccessfully urging his fair prisoner to get
  some rest, lay down himself. As soon as it appeared that he was asleep,
  Grandon drew back his hood, then raised one arm to attract the attention of
  Vernia, who sat staring moodily into the fire. Her eyes attracted by the
  motion of the arm, she glanced toward him, then smothered an exclamation of
  surprise and pleasure. Instantly he whipped the hood back over his face and
  lowered his arm.</p>

  <p>Now, seeing that she was covertly watching him, he began slowly rolling
  away from the others, and motioned to her to edge away from beside the fire
  at the same time. He hoped that if they could get away from the sleepers with
  sufficient stealth they could catch two of the grazing zandars, and put a
  considerable distance between themselves and the Ibbits before the ruse would
  be discovered.</p>

  <p>But his plans were suddenly upset by an agonized bellowing from one of the
  zandars, followed by a tremendous hissing sound which brought every warrior
  to his feet. Grandon sprang erect with the others, and saw a monster with a
  gigantic, lizard-like body to which was attached a scaly serpentine neck and
  head, biting immense mouthfuls of flesh from the zandar it had just struck
  down, and which it was holding beneath one huge front claw. Save for its
  color &mdash;for its body was completely covered by gleaming white
  scales&mdash;it might have been a silticum&mdash;one of those dangerous
  lizards he had first encountered in the fern forests of Reabon.</p>

  <p>"A posilticum! A posilticum!" shouted the warriors. Catching up their
  spiral-pointed spears, they charged the monster.</p>

  <p>Like the others, Grandon caught up his lance, and was about to join them
  in their attack on the monster, when another idea suddenly came to him. He
  noticed that the Rogo of the Ibbits, although he had sprung to his feet, had
  not moved from his place beside Vernia. The chieftain noticed his hesitation
  at the same time, and cried: "What! Does a warrior of mine fear a posilticum?
  Go at once with the others, or stay to receive your Rogo's blade."</p>

  <p>Nothing could have suited Grandon better. Flinging down his lance, he
  whipped out his scarbo and leaped across the dying embers of the fire. The
  chieftain was evidently a good scarboman as Ibbits go, for it appeared that
  he thought to make short work of Grandon as he struck out with his own blade.
  It was a cut for the head, which the Earthman parried. Countering with the
  same stroke, he found the blade of the Rogo there to meet his. Leaping back
  to avoid a horizontal blow at the neck, he suddenly changed from the
  well-established Zorovian practice of using the scarbo as a cutting weapon,
  and presented his point, lunging for the breast of the barbarian.</p>

  <p>Heg was not prepared for this innovation. Nor had he time to come on guard
  after the terrific slash he had directed at Grandon's neck. The Earthman's
  blade tore through his heart, and he toppled backward, dead.</p>

  <p>A quick glance around showed Grandon that his duel with the furry Rogo had
  not been observed by the others, all of whom were skipping about the
  posilticum, lunging at it with their spiral lances, and leaping back to avoid
  the darting of its huge and terrible head. The noise they made the hissing of
  the posilticum, the bellowing of frightened zandars, and the shouts of the
  Ibbits, had drowned all sound of the clashing scarbos.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Grandon, cleaning and sheathing his blade and catching up his
  lance. "Now is our chance."</p>

  <p>Hand in hand, he and Vernia ran to where a group of frightened zandars
  cowered together as if for mutual protection. He helped her to mount one of
  the shaggy beasts, and gave her swift instructions for riding it. Then he
  leaped to the back of another, and they were off.</p>

  <p>As soon as they left the shelter of the trees, the cold wind and stinging
  snow particles buffeted them unmercifully. They had not been gone more than a
  few minutes when a terrific blizzard swept down on them. Grandon laid their
  course in the direction he judged to be northwest, intending to circle
  Huitsen and make for the shore of the Azpok. He believed that a half-day's
  ride would take them to the edge of the plateau, and that by descending for a
  few miles they could find relief from the cold and snow.</p>

  <p>But they rode more than a half-day without seeing any sign of the slope
  for which they were searching. Then a steep cliff, the summit of which was
  invisible in the whirling cloud of snowflakes, suddenly loomed ahead. They
  rode up to its base, and, skirting it for some distance, came at length to a
  dark opening in the rock, half closed by a snow drift. By this time, the
  zandars, which had traveled nearly all night and half the day with only an
  hour's rest, began to balk, and Grandon judged that it was best to permit
  them to rest, and at the same time take advantage of this natural
  shelter.</p>

  <p>He accordingly dismounted, and leaving Vernia to watch the two beasts, cut
  a path through the snow into the cave with the aid of the whirling spiral
  point of his lance. Then, lighting his small flame-maker, and keeping the
  lance in readiness for an attack by a possible unseen enemy, he explored the
  place. He found himself in a room about twenty feet wide and fifty feet long,
  evidently chiseled from the rock by some prehistoric race, as it had the
  appearance of having been untenanted for ages. Mixed with the dust and litter
  of the ages, which strewed the floor, were a few partly calcined bones and
  some fragments of pottery, which showed that the primitives who had once
  lived here were acquainted with the use of fire.</p>

  <p>Having satisfied himself that the place was untenanted, Grandon went back
  for Vernia and the two beasts. The zandars seemed glad for this shelter from
  the storm, and lay down immediately, to rest and chew their ends.</p>

  <p>Gathering some bits of dried wood from the debris on the floor, Grandon
  made a small cooking fire near the entrance. As he had no large pots, he
  grilled some of the frozen meat from the saddlebags over the coals, and they
  made kova in the two copper drinking bowls which were part of the equipment
  in the saddlebags of the Ibbits.</p>

  <p>Having eaten and drunk, they snuggled themselves in their furs, and it was
  not long before both, weary with the long ordeal through which they had
  passed, were asleep.</p>

  <p>Vernia was the first to waken. She made two discoveries in rapid
  succession&mdash;first that a new day had dawned, and second that their
  mounts were not in the cave.</p>

  <p>"Bob!" she cried. "The zandars are gone!"</p>

  <p>He sat up and yawned. "Yes dear, Oh, the zandars. They've probably gone
  out to get their breakfast. I'll go and round them up."</p>

  <p>"I'll help you."</p>

  <p>"No, you'd better stay here where it's safe and warm."</p>

  <p>"But I'll be all right, Bob. I have my furs."</p>

  <p>Together they went outside, after Grandon did a little preliminary
  shoveling with his lance. The storm had passed, succeeded by a calm, bitter
  cold that was even more penetrating than the wind of the day before.</p>

  <p>"No tracks," said Grandon. "They must have left before the blizzard was
  over. Looks as if we're in for it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bob, what will we do?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing to do but strike out on foot, if we can't find them. But we may
  as well have a look around first. You wait here, and I'll follow the cliff
  toward the south for a little way. I noticed quite a bit of purple moss
  growing there yesterday, and those beasts may have remembered, and gone back
  for it."</p>

  <p>"Just in case they went the other way, I'll take a look in that
  direction," said Vernia.</p>

  <p>"Better wait here. It will be safer."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why. I won't go far, and I feel the need of a tramp before
  breakfast. Besides, the beasts may have gone toward the north, in which case
  we will save time by searching in both directions at once. Go ahead, and
  don't worry about me."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you must. But don't go far, and don't be long."</p>

  <p>She watched him for a moment as he strode off along the cliff, then turned
  and started in the opposite direction. She had gone only a short distance
  when her attention was attracted by what looked like the prickly segment of a
  species of Zorovian cactus projecting from behind a bend in the wall.</p>

  <p>Puzzled, she walked forward to investigate, but scarcely had she rounded
  the bend, ere an immense white monster with eight bristly white legs ending
  in green claws, and a long, jointed tail, darted out and seized her with a
  pair of huge green chelae, much like the pincers of a lobster. It was one of
  these that she had mistaken for a segment of cactus. Running swiftly
  backward, it carried her into a large cave.</p>

  <p>Through the center of the cave, from side to side, was stretched an
  immense web of rope-thick strands, coated with a gleaming, sticky-looking
  substance. And suspended in one corner of this hung one of the zandars.
  Beside the helpless beast was a ball about ten feet in diameter, woven of the
  same gleaming strands. The other zandar hung in a similar meshwork, near the
  center of the web.</p>

  <p>So suddenly had it happened that Vernia had time to utter but one
  smothered scream of terror as she was dragged into the cave. Nor could she
  make any move to defend herself. The huge chelae held her like the jaws of a
  vise, their coarse, spiny hairs piercing her flesh through the heavy cloak
  she wore.</p>

  <p>Holding her thus, the monster stopped, and standing on four legs, used the
  other four to draw a sticky white cord from beneath its abdomen and swiftly
  weave it around her, until she was scarcely able to move a finger. Then it
  ran up the web to the corner where the zandar hung beside the white ball and
  fastened her next to the helpless beast.</p>

  <p>Having shaken the web several times to make sure that she was fastened
  securely, the gigantic strid, or spinner-scorpion, for such she recognized it
  to be, returned to the zandar near the center, and settled down over it to
  feed. As the wretched beast made no outcry, it was evident that it had either
  been paralyzed by the terrible telson, the poisonous sting at the end of the
  jointed tail, or slain by the immense chelae.</p>

  <p>For some time, Vernia watched the monster at its bloody feast. Then her
  attention was attracted by a rustling sound quite near her. She turned, and
  saw that it came from the white ball beside which she was suspended.</p>

  <p>Presently there was a sound as of tearing fabric. A hole appeared in the
  ball, and out of it came a pair of wiggling, hairy chelae, small replicas of
  those of the mother scorpion. They were followed by an armored head in which
  were set three pairs of glowing eyes, blinking dully out at the world for the
  first time. It was then that Vernia realized what was in store for her. The
  monster had suspended both her and the zandar beside its cocoon as food for
  her young when they should break through the shell.</p>

  <p>Even as this horrible realization came to her, the first young strid
  forced its way through the opening, and came ambling across the web toward
  her on its eight hairy legs.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">16.</a> &mdash; ZINLO OF OLBA</h2>

  <p class="first">With its mast shot away, the little sailboat in which rode
  Kantar the Gunner, Narine of Tyrhana, and San Thoy of Huitsen, would not
  respond to the rudder, but came about and drifted broadside to the waves,
  rocking precariously while mattork shells exploded all around it. The two
  pursuing pirate ships now bore down on the helpless boat.</p>

  <p>Despite the increased difficulty of aiming his weapon, occasioned by the
  erratic plunging of the little craft, the skillful gunner succeeded in
  shattering a few spars and damaging the rigging of one of their pursuers with
  his explosive bullets. But as the two ships drew closer, he ceased firing,
  knowing that in surrender now lay their only hope of life. Abandoning his
  weapon, he hurried forward, where he found Narine still endeavoring to manage
  the other mattork.</p>

  <p>"Stop shooting," he said, "or the pirates will blow us to pieces. They are
  bound to hit us when they get a little closer."</p>

  <p>"I hope they do," she replied as she fired another shot, which, on account
  of the rocking of the boat, went wide of the mark. "To me death is preferable
  to falling again into their hands."</p>

  <p>As if in answer to her wish, a shell struck them aft, the next moment,
  completely demolishing the stern. Kantar and Narine were both hurled against
  the cabin by the force of the concussion, and San Thoy shot from his
  steersman's seat to a point on the deck quite near them. The hold filled
  almost instantly, and the boat plunged beneath the waves.</p>

  <p>As they went down, Kantar seized Narine's wrist. A moment later they came
  up, struggling and sputtering in the water.</p>

  <p>"Let me go," she demanded, as soon as she could get her breath. "I can
  take care of myself."</p>

  <p>The gunner relinquished her wrist, and grinning maliciously, said: "Well,
  you had your wish. I hope you are enjoying the consequences."</p>

  <p>Without replying, she turned and swam for a bit of wreckage larger than
  the others that bobbed around them. It had once been part of the after deck.
  Kantar looked around for San Thoy, and seeing him clinging to a heavy beam
  which could easily support him in the water, he leisurely followed Narine.
  The pirate ship ceased firing, and one of them was now only three hundred
  yards distant.</p>

  <p>Swimming up beside the girl's bit of wreckage, Kantar rested an arm upon
  it.</p>

  <p>"May I share this luxurious float with you?" he asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>"If you will try to be agreeable," she answered. "But one more word of
  sarcasm, and I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll what?"</p>

  <p>"Duck you."</p>

  <p>"Try it."</p>

  <p>She did, forcing his head, unresisting, under water. She held it there
  until she considered that his punishment had been sufficient, then removed
  her hand. But he didn't come up. Instead, his face remained under water, and
  he floated limply there beside the wreckage. She pulled his hair, but got no
  response. Alarmed, she moved closer, and lifted his head from the water.</p>

  <p>The gunner, who had been shamming, peered at her beneath lowered lids
  &mdash;saw the consternation in her pretty face&mdash;saw her red lips so
  close to his. A maddening desire from them overcome him.</p>

  <p>"Kantar!" she cried. "Oh, what have I done?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he swept her to him, crushed her lips to his.</p>

  <p>She trembled there in his embrace for a moment, then broke from him, her
  face scarlet.</p>

  <p>"You would dare!" she exclaimed. "Oh, you beast! You are worse than the
  Huitsenni, none of whom has ventured to so affront me."</p>

  <p>"Narine," he pleaded, "I love you. I must tell you this before I go to my
  death at the hands of those yellow pirates, for they will surely slay me
  after what I have done. Your lips drew me&mdash;twin lodestones I could not
  resist. If you cannot return my love, can you at least forgive me?"</p>

  <p>Her look softened. "The pirates have lowered a boat," she said, "so I must
  put maidenly modesty aside and answer you briefly and truthfully. I do love
  you, my brave gunner. I have loved you from the moment I first saw you, there
  in the cabin of the little fishing boat. But even had I hope of life and
  freedom, I could never marry you."</p>

  <p>"There is another man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. My father. He would never consent."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he could be brought to reason."</p>

  <p>"Impossible. You see my older sister disappointed him in his plans for a
  matrimonial alliance, and fell in love, but he will not be turned again from
  his purpose. Her disappointed lover has agreed to solace himself with me. My
  father will not give in so easily a second time.</p>

  <p>"But all this talk is futile. We are once more in the power of the
  Huitsenni, and only they may decide our fate. Here is the boat. Farewell, my
  gunner, and may Thorth guide and keep you."</p>

  <p>"Ill never give you up," he cried.</p>

  <p>Yellow hands seized them, dragged them into the boat. Then Kantar suddenly
  saw what he had no opportunity to see before. When the boat had gone down,
  Narine's improvised cloak had floated from her. Later, all but her head,
  arms, and shoulders had been under water. But now he observed that she wore
  scarlet of royalty, and on the golden breast shields he saw the insignia of
  an imperial princess of Tyrhana. All the hopes which her words had aroused
  died in his heart. For Kantar was but a common soldier. His father had been
  an officer in the Uxponian army, but without even the purple of nobility.</p>

  <p>Narine saw the despair in his eyes, and guessed his thoughts. She smiled a
  little wistful smile.</p>

  <p>"I understand now," said the gunner. Then he resolutely turned his head
  away, and meekly permitted his captors to bind his wrists. A moment later,
  San Thoy also was dragged out of the water.</p>

  <p>Swiftly the rowers propelled the boat back to the ship. The prisoners were
  hoisted aboard. Narine was hurried away by the mojak of the vessel. And with
  kicks and cuffs, Kantar and San Thoy, bound hand and foot, were thrown into
  an evil-smelling room in the hold, quite similar to the one in which they had
  been confined with Grandon when first taken to Huitsen. Immediately Kantar
  set about trying to loose the bonds of his companion.</p>

  <p>But his tedious labors were suddenly interrupted by an explosion which
  tore a hole in the planking above their heads. There followed the rapid
  booming of mattorks, the screaming of projectiles, and the almost continuous
  bursting of shells.</p>

  <p>"Our captors must have found new victims," said Kantar, springing to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Judging by the number of shells which are striking this ship, I would say
  that they are more likely to become the victims," replied San Thoy, also
  getting to his feet.</p>

  <p>Both men hopped to the side of the boat&mdash;they could not walk because
  of their bound feet&mdash;and peered through the loopholes.</p>

  <p>"Bones of Thorth!" exclaimed San Thoy. "There are ships floating in the
  air!"</p>

  <p>Looking out, Kantar saw a fleet of aerial battleships. They were shaped
  like duck-boats, surmounted by heavy transparent turrets mounting heavy
  mattorks, and flew without wings, rudders or propellers.</p>

  <p>"They are Olban airships," he said. "I once saw a fleet of them in
  Reabon."</p>

  <p>"Never before have I seen or heard of such marvelous craft above the
  Azpok," said San Thoy.</p>

  <p>"It's strange that they should be here. I wonder&mdash;ah! I have it.
  Zinlo, Torrogo of Olba, is fiance of Loralie, the Torrogina of Tyrhana.
  Naturally he would, on being advised of the disappearance of her younger
  sister, assist in the search for her. And just as naturally, he would attack
  the ships of the Huitsenni, who are enemies to all Zorovia, wherever he
  should find them."</p>

  <p>For several minutes the bombardment became more intense, and Kantar was
  much concerned for Narine's safety. Then a huge shadow darkened the waters
  before them, the bombardment ceased, and there was the noise of grappling
  hooks scraping across the splintered decks. These sounds were succeeded by
  the tramping of many feet above them, the clashing of arms intermingled with
  the spitting of tork fire, and a medley of shouts, groans, and shrieks.</p>

  <p>"The Olbans have boarded us," said Kantar. "I trust they arrive in time to
  save Narine."</p>

  <p>The fighting was soon over. And presently the gunner heard the tramp of
  warriors, evidently searching the ship, passing their door. "Ho, Olbans," he
  called, "open the door."</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" a voice asked, cautiously.</p>

  <p>"A warrior of Reabon and a fellow prisoner," he replied.</p>

  <p>The door was unbolted and flung open. Three Olban warriors, with the
  muzzles of their torks elevated, peered in, while a fourth flashed a light
  about the room. Seeing the two bound men, they entered and quickly released
  them.</p>

  <p>"Have they found the princess?" Kantar inquired, rubbing his numbed
  wrists. "Is she safe?"</p>

  <p>"What princess?" asked the soldier who had removed his bonds. "We know
  naught of a princess."</p>

  <p>"Why, Narine, Torrogini of Tyrhana," replied the gunner. "She was captured
  and brought aboard with us."</p>

  <p>"Ha! It is as His Majesty suspected," cried another soldier. "From a
  distance we saw them sink a small boat, and later lower a boat to bring away
  three people from the wreckage. Yet their mojak has stoutly denied that he
  had prisoners aboard. Come. The Torrogo must hear of this at once."</p>

  <p>With the four Olbans, they hurried to the deck. A group of Huitsenni
  prisoners huddled, weaponless, in the stern, under the watchful eyes of
  several guards. Warriors were heaving the bodies of the slain overboard and
  Olban surgeons were tending the wounded, both friend and foe. Attached to the
  side of the vessel by hooks and chains was an immense aerial battleship with
  twelve gun turrets. A set of collapsible aluminum stairs led from an open
  door in one of these turrets to the deck of the ship. On the opposite side,
  another aerial battleship was similarly fastened. A fleet of a dozen more
  airships floated overhead, and Kantar saw that the other pirate ship had also
  been boarded by the crews of two aerial battleships, and its men subdued.</p>

  <p>They hurried forward. On the foredeck stood a handsome young man of about
  the gunner's own age, whom Kantar instantly recognized as Zinlo, Torrogo of
  Olba. He was clad in scarlet apparel, gold-trimmed and glittering with
  precious stones. On his feet were sandals of soft frella hide, and his
  scarlet, turban-shaped headpiece was decked with gold fringe and set with a
  huge ruby that blazed above the center of his forehead. Beside him stood an
  equally youthful soldier, whose insignia proclaimed him Romojak of the Aerial
  Navies of Olba.</p>

  <p>On his knees before the young Torrogo was the mojak of the vessel. As
  Kantar came up with the others he was saying: "I swear to you, Majesty, by
  the beard and body of Thorth, by all I hold sacred, that I have no prisoners,
  white or yellow, on board."</p>

  <p>"So. You persist in your falsehood." Zinlo frowned at the yellow man who
  groveled before him. Then his eyes fell on Kantar and San Thoy.</p>

  <p>"Whom have we here?" he asked one of the warriors who had released
  them.</p>

  <p>The mojak looked around, and seeing who stood behind him, turned a pale,
  sickly yellow.</p>

  <p>"They are two prisoners we found in a room below the deck, Your Majesty,"
  replied the warrior.</p>

  <p>Kantar made obeisance, with right hand extended palm downward.</p>

  <p>"I am Kantar the Gunner, of Reabon, Your Majesty," he said, "and my
  companion is San Thoy, a former mojak in the navy of Huitsen. If you don't
  mind, I would prefer to tell you our story after Her Imperial Highness has
  been found."</p>

  <p>"Her Imperial Highness?"</p>

  <p>"I refer Your Majesty, to Narine, Torrogini of Tyrhana."</p>

  <p>"Hal" Zinlo suddenly whipped out his scarbo and presented its point to the
  breast of the frightened mojak. "Now, you yellow hahoe, we have caught you
  lying. Either you will tell us, this instant, where the Princess is
  concealed, or I will slay you, and if need be, tear this ship apart to find
  her."</p>

  <p>"Mercy, Majesty! Have mercy!" quavered the mojak. "I will show you."</p>

  <p>Rising, and backing away from the royal presence, he stooped and seized a
  ring in the deck. Pulling this, he lifted a trap door from which a short
  ladder led down into a small cabin. Lying on the sleeping shelf of the cabin
  was Narine, gagged, and bound hand and foot.</p>

  <p>Disdaining the ladder, Kantar dropped into the cabin, closely followed by
  the young Torrogo. Together they quickly unbound the princess and removed her
  gag. She was limp, and apparently lifeless.</p>

  <p>"Narine! Narine!" For the moment Kantar, who knelt beside the sleeping
  shelf, forgot the presence of Zinlo of Olba&mdash;forgot that the girl before
  him was an imperial princess.</p>

  <p>Narine opened her eyes and saw Kantar bending over her. But Zinlo she did
  not see. Her right arm went around the gunner's neck&mdash;her hand caressed
  his sandy hair. "I'm just a little faint, my gunner. That gag made breathing
  difficult. I could not have lasted much longer."</p>

  <p>He caught up her left hand, lying limply beside her, and covered it with
  kisses. "I'm glad, so glad, we came in time."</p>

  <p>"My lips, Gunner. Have they lost their allure so quickly?" She drew his
  face down to hers.</p>

  <p>Zinlo raised a quizzical eyebrow. Then, with a fierce gesture, he waved
  off the gaping warriors who were peering down at them.</p>

  <p>"I heard explosions&mdash;men fighting on the decks. Tell me what
  happened," said Narine, a moment later.</p>

  <p>"His Imperial Majesty, Zinlo of Olba, rescued us," replied Kantar,
  suddenly remembering the presence of the Torrogo, and blushing furiously in
  consequence.</p>

  <p>"What!" Narine sat up quickly, then seeing Zinlo, turned to face him, her
  shapely legs dangling from the sleeping shelf.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty!" she cried in consternation. "I did not know you were
  here."</p>

  <p>She rose and made the customary obeisance.</p>

  <p>"I surmised as much, Your Highness," smiled Zinlo. Then he took her
  extended hand, and kneeling, raised it to his lips. "Shall we adjourn to more
  comfortable quarters?"</p>

  <p>"Let's. I've always wanted to ride in one of your Olban airships. What of
  my father and sister?"</p>

  <p>"Both well, but almost frantic with worry on account of you."</p>

  <p>When they reached the deck, the young romojak, who had been standing
  beside Zinlo when Kantar first saw him, came up and saluted.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Lotar?" asked Zinlo.</p>

  <p>"We have disposed of all prisoners in accordance with Your Majesty's
  commands," replied the romojak. "There remains, however, the yellow man we
  found imprisoned with this warrior of Reabon."</p>

  <p>"Take him aboard the flagship," said Zinlo, "and see that he has every
  comfort."</p>

  <p>Lotar saluted and withdrew. Then the three climbed the aluminum stairs,
  and after passing through a narrow hallway, entered the luxurious saloon of
  Zinlo's flagship. The young Torrogo placed cushioned chairs for both of them,
  and summoned a slave. "Bring us kova," he commanded.</p>

  <p>He drew up a chair and sat down. Then he noticed that Kantar, conforming
  to the usages of the court, had not seated himself because he was in the
  presence of royalty. "Sit, Gunner," he said. "We will have no formality
  here."</p>

  <p>This was a command, and Kantar, whose feeling of embarrassment had only
  slightly lessened since the incident in the cabin, took the chair which had
  been placed for him.</p>

  <p>The slave bustled in with kova, and Zinlo himself served his guests in
  tiny bowls of gold lined with mother of pearl.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, "as soon as my Romojak comes aboard, we'll fly to the
  flagship of Ad of Tyrhana. But in the meantime, Your Highness, suppose you
  tell me what you have been doing these many days."</p>

  <p>"My father's flagship!" exclaimed Narine. "Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Only a little way from here," replied Zinlo, "and Loralie is with him.
  But let's hear that story."</p>

  <p>Swiftly, Narine sketched for him the story of her adventures&mdash;the
  storm, her capture by the Huitsenni, her sale to Heg and rescue by Kantar,
  and their escape with the aid of San Thoy.</p>

  <p>Zinlo frowned. "These yellow pirates must be wiped out," he said "and
  there is no better time than now to do it. But what of my friend Grandon and
  his beautiful bride?" he asked Kantar. "Do you think they were both carried
  off by the white-furred barbarians?"</p>

  <p>"I think it probable," replied Kantar, "that her Majesty was carried off
  by Heg. It is possible that the Ibbits also took Grandon prisoner, but I
  think it more probable that he found some way to follow the savages, in an
  effort to rescue his bride."</p>

  <p>"I'll send a squadron after them," said Zinlo. "As I judge from what Her
  Highness just told me that the capital of the furry Rogo is five days journey
  from Huitsen, my swift airships can easily overtake them before they reach
  their destination."</p>

  <p>At this moment, Lotar came in and saluted.</p>

  <p>"To the flagship of Ad of Tyrhana," commanded Zinlo. "Signal the fleet to
  attend us. You have placed the prize crews aboard the two pirate
  vessels?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Majesty." He saluted and withdrew.</p>

  <p>A moment later the ship rose smoothly and swiftly to a height of about two
  thousand feet, then shot away toward the west at a tremendous speed. Kantar,
  who had never ridden in one of these craft before, but had heard that the
  swiftest ones were capable of traveling at the speed with which the planet
  revolved on its axis at the equator&mdash;approximately a thousand miles an
  hour&mdash;nevertheless marveled at the speed with which the ocean appeared
  to move beneath them as he watched through one of the side windows. Sailing
  on the waves of the Azpok, he now saw 'six large battle fleets, all within a
  few miles of the spot where their little craft had been sunk by the
  Huitsenni.</p>

  <p>The airship reached a point over the flagship of one of these fleets and
  swiftly descended.</p>

  <p>Narine placed a hand on Zinlo's arm. "You won't tell my father?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"About what?" Zinlo appeared puzzled.</p>

  <p>She looked tenderly at Kantar. "About us. We know it is hopeless, our
  love, and have agreed to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Try to forget," suggested Zinlo.</p>

  <p>"You're so helpful, my brother to be. But there in the cabin, for the
  moment, love mastered us."</p>

  <p>"I understand, perfectly," said the young Torrogo.</p>

  <p>"Of course. You and Loralie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>"But my father will not be moved from his purpose again. I know him well
  enough for that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know. What has been done before can be done again. Perhaps I
  can do something."</p>

  <p>"You are so kind. Now I know why Loralie just can't help loving you. But
  for the present at least, you will say nothing?"</p>

  <p>"In that cabin, I was deaf, dumb, and blind, as were my warriors who
  happened to be peering down at us. But here we are at the flagship."</p>

  <p>Kantar heard the clank of chains and the thud of grappling irons. Then
  Zinlo rose, and they followed him down the ladder to the deck of an immense
  battleship which flew the flag of Ad, Torrogo of Tyrhana.</p>

  <p>Just as they reached the deck, the gunner saw two people emerge from one
  of the cabins&mdash;a tall, straight, athletic-appearing man about forty
  years of age, with a square-cut, jet-black beard, and a girl who closely
  resembled Narine, though she appeared a trifle more mature. Both wore the
  scarlet of royalty, and Kantar knew that they must be Ad of Tyrhana and his
  daughter, Loralie.</p>

  <p>Narine ran into the open arms of her father, then embraced her sister. All
  three shed tears of joy, and Kantar, whose own eyes were overflowing, saw
  that Zinlo was in like case.</p>

  <p>The gunner was presented, and all were ushered into Ad's sumptuous cabin
  where the customary kova was served.</p>

  <p>After Narine had related the story of her adventures, Kantar was pressed
  to tell his, and those of Grandon and Vernia with which he was
  acquainted.</p>

  <p>When the gunner had finished, Ad echoed the previously expressed sentiment
  of Zinlo. "We must wipe out the Huitsenni," he declared. "But first we must
  try to rescue their Majesties of Reabon."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to send a squadron after the Ibbits," said Zinlo.</p>

  <p>"But suppose Grandon and his bride are still in Huitsen."</p>

  <p>"I believe we can ascertain whether or not they are there," said
  Kantar.</p>

  <p>"How?" asked Ad.</p>

  <p>"The Chispoks. There must be some members among the pirates you have
  captured. Land some of them near the city under cover of darkness. Let them
  investigate, and report back to you."</p>

  <p>"A splendid idea," said Zinlo. "And I would suggest a further plan.
  Suppose we form an alliance with the Chispoks, overthrow the present regime,
  if indeed they have not done so already, and put them in power. That would be
  better than indiscriminately wiping out the entire yellow race, all of whom
  are certainly not responsible for the piratical outrages of Yin Yin's men.
  The port of Huitsen could then be opened for peaceful trade with all Zorovia,
  and if the Huitsenni should ever again develop piratical leanings, we would
  know how to stop them."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure the alliance can be arranged, Your Majesty," said Kantar.
  "Suppose we send for San Thoy."</p>

  <p>Zinlo called a servant. "Tell my romojak to bring San Thoy, the yellow
  man, here," he directed.</p>

  <p>In a few moments Lotar came in, accompanied by San Thoy. Kantar presented
  the former mojak of the navy of Huitsen to the assemblage. Then Zinlo
  addressed Lotar. Briefly he told him why they suspected that Grandon and
  Vernia might be traveling southward with a party of Ibbits, and gave him his
  instructions: "Dispatch six ships," he commanded, "with orders to fly high
  above Huitsen, deep enough in the first cloud stratum so they will not be
  seen from the city. Then; when they have their bearings, let them spread out,
  and fly southward until they come to a column of furry white savages riding
  on three-horned beasts. If Grandon of Terra and his bride are with this
  party, they must rescue them as best they can, and bring them here at
  once."</p>

  <p>Lotar saluted. "I hasten to carry out Your Majesty's commands," he
  replied, and hurried out.</p>

  <p>As soon as Lotar had gone, San Thoy was quizzed about a possible alliance
  with the Chispoks. He not only felt positive that he could arrange this, but
  stated that he had received secret signs from several of the yellow sailors
  on board the vessel which he had been rescued, which proved to him that they
  were members of the brotherhood. After a short conference, he was dispatched
  in one of Zinlo's airships to visit both captured pirate vessels, and cull
  the Chispoks from among the prisoners.</p>

  <p>"What of our allies?" Zinlo asked Ad, after San Thoy had departed. "Shall
  we let them help in the assault on Huitsen?"</p>

  <p>Ad stroked his black beard thoughtfully. "Hum. Let's see. We have two
  squadrons here, of our own. Lying near by are two from Adonijar, and a little
  farther away, two from Reabon."</p>

  <p>"In addition to their battleships, the Reabonians have two score
  transports, and as many munition ships, with a large army and munitions and
  equipment for a land offensive," said Zinlo.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of that," said Ad. "How or where could they land their
  army?"</p>

  <p>"The Chispoks know a secret way," said Kantar. "San Thoy or one of his
  fellows could guide them."</p>

  <p>"Splendid. We can now plan a united offensive. The Reabonians will
  disembark at night, and guided by the Chispoks, will march on Huitsen,
  prepared for an offensive tomorrow at an hour we shall set. You, Zinlo will
  mass your aerial battleships above the city to join in the attack at the same
  time, and to convey signals from one force to another. Meanwhile, the
  battleships of Tyrhana, Adonijar, and Reabon must find some way to get
  through the secret entrance."</p>

  <p>"I've thought of a plan for that, also, Your Majesty," said Kantar.</p>

  <p>"Good. Let me hear it, my boy."</p>

  <p>And so Kantar related to them a plan he had conceived on the spur of the
  moment, whereby he believed they could not only get the gates opened for
  them, but keep them open for the entrance of the battle fleets of the three
  great nations.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">17.</a> &mdash; THE DEATH SENTENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">Some time after Grandon and Vernia separated at the mouth of
  the cave to look for their riding-beasts which had disappeared, and which
  they believed had strayed in search of food, there came faintly to the ears
  of the Earthman a sound that caused him to stop, whirl around, and listen
  intently. So slight was the sound that he could not quite make it out, yet it
  had a quality which made him suspicious that Vernia had called him. Though he
  strained his ears to catch a possible repetition, none was audible.</p>

  <p>Alarmed, he retraced his steps as swiftly as possible, but the soft, newly
  fallen snow retarded his progress considerably. Fuming impatiently at the
  delay, he floundered past the mouth of the cave in which they had passed the
  night, and anxiously took up Vernia's trail, shouting her name as he went.
  But there was no reply.</p>

  <p>The tracks led him close to the irregular base of the cliff, and as
  Grandon stumbled around a bend, he saw the same sight which Vernia had beheld
  only a short time before, and which had led to her entrapment&mdash;a bristly
  white and green object curving outward from behind a projection, which looked
  like a segment of Zorovian cactus. Like her, he thought it part of some
  antarctic plant, and proceeded incautiously toward it. He came to a sudden
  pause, however, and presented the spiral point of his lance, as the apparent
  segment resolved itself into one of the chelae of an immense white scorpion,
  which shot out from behind the projection, and charged swiftly toward
  him.</p>

  <p>Pointing his lance, Grandon pulled back the lever which set the spiral
  head to whirling. Fearlessly, and without swerving or endeavoring to evade
  the weapon, the monster sprang at the Earthman with its immense pincers
  extended to seize him. Right in the thorax the lance point struck, and bored
  in up to the knob. Grandon was thrown backward by the impact of that charge,
  but by diverting the butt of his lance downward and plunging it through the
  snow until it struck frozen ground beneath, was able to hold the scorpion
  away from him.</p>

  <p>Then still clinging to the shaft with his left hand, he drew his scarbo
  with his right, and struck at the nearest chela. It was quite tough and
  horny, and the blade did not bite more than half-way through it. Clenching
  his teeth, he struck again with all his strength, and this time succeeded in
  severing it near the middle. Having mastered the art of it, he was able to
  cut off the other claw at the fist joint with two sharp blows.</p>

  <p>But no sooner had these menaces been removed than he was threatened with
  another, even more dangerous. With lightning swiftness, the monster suddenly
  elevated its long, jointed tail, and stabbed at him with the terrible telson
  with which the tip was armed.</p>

  <p>Avoiding the deadly thrust of the poison sting by leaning sideways,
  Grandon hacked at the thing with his scarbo. To his surprise, it was quite
  brittle, and broke off with the first blow.</p>

  <p>Although the monster was now unable to injure him except at very close
  quarters, it was not without resource. It suddenly reached beneath its
  abdomen with its foremost pair of hairy legs, and drawing there&mdash;from a
  section of gleaming, sticky web as thick as a rope, it cast the loop about
  him and dragged him forward. He clung to the lance-shaft with all his might,
  and succeeded in severing the sticky loop with a stroke of his scarbo. Not so
  a second loop, however, which it unexpectedly flung around him, breaking his
  hold on the shaft, as it jerked him toward its ugly gaping mandibles with his
  right arm bound to his side.</p>

  <p>He had previously refrained from using his tork for fear the sound would
  bring enemies but in this extremity he elevated the muzzle, depressed the
  firing-button, and sent a stream of bullets straight into the gaping jaws.
  With muffled detonations the projectiles exploded in the huge, armored body.
  A half-dozen of them sufficed to blow the hard-shelled cephalothorax to bits,
  and reduced the segmented abdomen to a shapeless quivering mass.</p>

  <p>Quickly shifting his scarbo to his left hand, Grandon cut himself free of
  the sticky loop that encumbered him. Then, perceiving the yawning cave mouth,
  and suspecting that it was here that Vernia had been taken, he rushed inside.
  Despite their wrappings, he was able to identify the two zandars, one hanging
  in the center of the huge web, the other at the edge beside a large spherical
  cocoon. But what was the smaller object beside the cocoon? His heart stood
  still as he recognized the slender form of Vernia, and saw that a young
  scorpion, which had evidently just emerged from the cocoon, was crawling
  toward her.</p>

  <p>Although the newly hatched monster was not more than six feet from Vernia,
  and he could not shoot without endangering her, he knew that there was
  nothing else to do. Accordingly, he brought his tork to bear on the hairy
  youngster, and fired. There was a muffled explosion, and the menace was
  removed. But now he saw another pair of chelae emerging from the cocoon.
  Again he fired, and the second young scorpion was blown to bits. He watched
  for a moment, but as no more appeared, decided that the other eggs had not
  yet hatched, and set about trying to find a way to climb to where Vernia was
  suspended.</p>

  <p>The stickiness of the web made this almost impossible, until he thought to
  utilize the dust and debris which littered the door. Catching this up in
  double handfuls, he flung it against the section of the web which he wished
  to climb, and found, as he hoped, that it prevented the adhesive surface of
  the strands from clinging to his hands and feet.</p>

  <p>Swiftly he climbed up to Vernia, cut the surrounding strands, and as
  swiftly descended to the floor with his burden. With his knife he quickly
  slit open the wrappings and found his wife, limp, and apparently lifeless. He
  opened her great fur cloak, and the sight of several scratches on her white
  skin engendered the fear that she had been poisoned by the venom of the
  monster. But when he held his ear to her breast, he was relieved to hear her
  heart beating.</p>

  <p>With a handful of snow taken from the cave mouth, be touched her temples.
  The cold shock revived her. She looked about wildly for a moment; then,
  recognizing Grandon, she relaxed contentedly in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt dear?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Only a few scratches, Bob," she replied. "It was the fright that made me
  swoon. When I saw that young strid coming toward me, as I hung there
  helpless, and realized that its purpose was to devour me, I fainted. Let me
  rest for a little while, and I'll be ready to walk."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you won't need to walk," said Grandon. "One zandar appears to be
  alive. I'll see if I can cut it down."</p>

  <p>Utilizing the dust as he had done before, Grandon succeeded in making a
  path up the web for himself to where the zandar bung beside the immense
  cocoon. With his scarbo, he first cut the heavy, rope-like strands above it.
  Then, as the great bulk of the beast swung downward, he cut the cross strands
  in succession, and with each cut, the zandar descended a little further. When
  at last the beast was on the floor, it was still helpless because of the
  thorough manner in which it had been trussed: But its heaving flanks showed
  that it was still very much alive, and not a little frightened by the
  experience it had just gone through. Employing his knife, Grandon quickly cut
  the strands which held it, and it struggled to its feet, trembling and
  panting heavily.</p>

  <p>"It seems unhurt," said Vernia, who had recovered from her faintness and
  come over to watch the proceedings.</p>

  <p>"Its legs are sound, at any rate," replied Grandon.</p>

  <p>The beast followed them docilely enough through the mouth of the cave.
  Then, after helping Vernia into the saddle Grandon returned for a moment, to
  apply his flame-maker to the bottom of the web. It caught fire with a roar,
  and be plunged out of the cave followed by a billowing cloud of black, oily
  smoke.</p>

  <p>"That will do for the rest of the ugly brood," he said as he came up
  beside Vernia.</p>

  <p>He was about to mount behind her, when he suddenly saw, riding swiftly
  toward them, a large band of warriors mounted on zandars. They were not
  Ibbits, as he could see at a glance, but Huitsenni, and had evidently heard
  his tork fire and come to investigate. Instantly the riders deployed in a
  wide semi-circle, cutting off all possibility of escape across the snow. As
  they could not climb the sheer face of the cliff behind them, nor retire into
  the cave, which was now belching great clouds of acrid smoke, they remained
  where they were, Vernia still in the saddle, and Grandon beside her.</p>

  <p>Had he been alone, Grandon would have resisted desperately, but he knew
  that if he should use his tork the enemy would retaliate in kind, and Vernia
  might be injured or slain. A moment more, and he was looking into the mouths
  of fully a hundred torks leveled at him by a closely packed semicircle of
  riders. Then the mojak in command ordered a halt, and called out to Grandon:
  "Surrender, in the name of the Rogo of Huitsen, or we fire."</p>

  <p>Seeing that resistance was useless, Grandon unbuckled the belt which
  contained his weapons, and flung it on the snow in front of him. Then he
  clasped his hands behind his head in token of surrender.</p>

  <p>At the order of the mojak, two men descended and swiftly bound him, hand
  and foot. Then he was slung across the saddle-bow of one of the riders as if
  he had been a sack of grain, and the cavalcade rode away. Vernia was not
  bound, but was permitted to retain her place in the saddle with a guard on
  each side of her.</p>

  <p>Several hours later, it seemed to Grandon that all of Huitsen had turned
  out to stare at the two prisoners that their riders were bringing in, so
  dense were the crowds along the streets. Their captors took them straight to
  the palace, where they were deprived of their Ibbit furs, which were not
  needed here in the warm lowlands. Then the mojak, quite obviously proud of
  his success, led them to the throne room, each guarded by two of his
  warriors.</p>

  <p>Up to the time they were ushered into that vast room, Grandon had
  entertained the hope that one of the Chispoks had succeeded Yin Yin, but his
  hopes were dashed as he recognized the individual who squatted in the center
  of the crystal throne. It was the bestial Thid Yet, former Romojak of the
  Navies of Huitsen. Like his predecessor, he was surrounded by numerous
  attendants and nobles, and his gross body was loaded with flashing jewels.
  The porcine monarch grinned toothlessly as they were brought before him.</p>

  <p>"It is apparent that our men have persuaded Your Majesties to avail
  yourselves once more of our cordial if humble hospitality," he said. "We are
  honored."</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty's warriors have persuasive ways," replied Grandon. "Perhaps,
  now that you are Rogo, we can persuade you to permit us to depart to our own
  torrogat, where duty calls us."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," replied Thid Yet, dipping his thumb into a spore pod which one
  of the former slave girls of Yin Yin presented and thrusting the red spores
  into his fat cheek. "Just what is your proposition?"</p>

  <p>"Say, a million keds of gold."</p>

  <p>"Humph! We are offered more for Her Majesty alone."</p>

  <p>"Two million."</p>

  <p>"Not enough."</p>

  <p>"Three&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait," interrupted Thid Yet. "You but waste your breath. Her Majesty will
  remain here as was previously arranged, until it is time to take her to the
  rendezvous. Though she has been deprived of the pleasure of Yin Yin's
  company, we trust that we will make a satisfactory substitute."</p>

  <p>"Why you&mdash;!" Grandon would have sprung at the throat of the man on
  the throne had he not been seized by the guards.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Majesty. Permit me to finish. We are grieved that we can not
  entirely comply with your request, yet we will in part fulfill it."</p>

  <p>"In part?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. We will permit you to leave, but not for your own country. Although
  you left no witnesses we have considerable evidence that it was you who
  beheaded our just and generous predecessor. We also remember that it was due
  to you that we nearly lost our own head. So we will allow you to leave&mdash;
  will, in fact, speed you on your way, for it would be dangerous to have you
  near us. But instead of sending you to your own torrogat, we will dispatch
  you to the Kingdom of Thorth."</p>

  <p>Thorth being the Kingdom of Heaven, he beckoned to one of the two brawny
  guards who stood behind the throne&mdash;their immense two-handed scarbos
  much in evidence. "Come, Ez Bin. Clip me the head from this fine fellow, and
  see that you cut it cleanly, as I would retain it for a souvenir."</p>

  <p>Swinging the heavy scarbo to his shoulder, the headsman marched forward.
  Grandon was quickly forced to his knees by his two guards. Ez Bin took a
  position beside him, tested the keenness of his blade with his thumb, and
  carefully measured the distance and position of Grandon's neck, closing one
  eye and squinting the other. Then, with the swift assurance of an expert, he
  raised his blade.</p>

  <p>Vernia, who had been watching the scene, too horrified even to utter a
  sound, covered her eyes with her hands. Then she suddenly went limp in the
  hands of her two guards.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">18.</a> &mdash; THE ALLIES ATTACK</h2>

  <p class="first">In the flagship of Zinlo of Olba rode Kantar the Gunner and
  Narine, looking down at the city of Huitsen through several feet of the
  lowest cloud stratum. The ship was flying in this stratum that it might
  remain invisible to the Huitsenni in the streets below, yet be able to keep
  watch. The offensive which the allies had planned the day before was now
  scheduled to take place.</p>

  <p>Ten thousand of Reabon's brave warriors, guided by the Chispoks that San
  Thoy had selected, were converging on the city in an immense semicircle, and
  five thousand more, a contingent of Reabonian artillery, had their mattorks
  ready to make breaches in the walls and lay a barrage in front of the
  infantry as soon as the charge should commence or the enemy discover their
  presence.</p>

  <p>Zinlo, who had been looking over the scene with his glass, said: "I wonder
  what has become of San Thoy and the two pirate vessels he was so positive he
  could bring through the gate. I see no sign of them in the canal. And our
  fleets still ride at anchor outside, waiting for our signal."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we should fly down and investigate," suggested Narine.</p>

  <p>"Hardly," replied Kantar. "They would be sure to see us and precipitate a
  battle before we are ready."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to do but wait," said Zinlo, impatiently.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, San Thoy, standing in the commander's cabin of the foremost of
  the two ships which had been converted to the purpose of the allies, its crew
  augmented by a band of Reabonian warriors who kept out of sight below decks,
  and which was just then entering the fjord which led to Huitsen, was issuing
  swift orders to the mojak of the vessel. "Put three men on each oar," he
  commanded. "The steel bar which we are to drop between the stone gates to
  prevent their closing after us, is dragging on the bottom."</p>

  <p>"Can we not raise it a trifle?" asked the mojak.</p>

  <p>"No, idiot. The guardians are already watching us. To touch those chains
  now would make them suspicious. Do as I say, and quickly, for the time for
  the offensive is almost at hand."</p>

  <p>Under the added propulsion of the extra rowers, the boat moved slowly
  forward, dragging the heavy steel bar which the smiths of the fleet of Reabon
  had forged especially for this occasion by working all the previous night.
  Behind it came the second pirate ship, manned like the first by Chispoks
  culled from the two crews and a concealed contingent of Reabonian warriors.
  Its mojak, puzzled by the slow progress of the ship ahead, ordered his rowers
  to back water and wait until a suitable distance should be established
  between the two ships.</p>

  <p>As San Thoy's vessel approached the massive stone gates, they did not
  open. Instead, there came a hail from one of the guardians.</p>

  <p>"What ails you? Why do you move so slowly?</p>

  <p>"We were crippled in a battle with the Reabonian fleet," replied San Thoy.
  "Our hold is filling with water. Let us through quickly or we will sink and
  block the channel."</p>

  <p>There was some delay. Evidently the guardians were not entirely satisfied
  with San Thoy's explanation. The mojak knew that they were being subjected to
  minute scrutiny from above.</p>

  <p>"Fools!" he cried, at length. "Open the gate or the channel will be closed
  to all our ships. We are sinking rapidly. Besides, the enemy follows closely.
  Would you have them find us here?"</p>

  <p>Evidently his words, or the fact that their rigging and upper works were
  damaged by shell-fire, decided the guardian's, for the gates slowly slid
  apart.</p>

  <p>San Thoy snapped an order to the rowers. "Pull, men, with all your
  might."</p>

  <p>The channel was quite shallow here, and the bar dragged heavily, but the
  men worked with a will. Soon the boat was half through the gateway. "Now,"
  commanded San Thoy, "let go the bar."</p>

  <p>The chains were released, and struck the water with a loud splash.</p>

  <p>"Ho, sailors. What was that you dropped?" one of the guards shouted from
  above.</p>

  <p>Freed from the heavy drag of the bar, the ship shot forward under the
  exertion of the rowers. At the same time, its mattorks were trained on the
  grotto above, where the guards manipulated the machinery that worked the
  gates and kept watch for ships. Without replying to the question of the
  guard, the Chispoks opened fire.</p>

  <p>The guards were sheltered behind a wall of stone, and in addition, were
  armed with mattorks. These instantly went into action, replying to the guns
  of San Thoy's ship and riddling her upper works with shells.</p>

  <p>The second ship had, meanwhile, come up more slowly. Warriors clung to her
  masts and rigging. As she came halfway through the gate, she dropped anchor.
  The men in the rigging flung grappling-hooks up over the walls, and swarmed
  up the ropes. Many were hurled back, but enough succeeded in getting over to
  quickly conquer the guards. Then a mojo with twenty men took charge of the
  gate, and the two ships passed on through the immense black cavern.</p>

  <p>Swiftly San Thoy ran to the foredeck of his craft. With an immense brush
  and a can of red pigment, he painted the word "open" in Patoa, so it could be
  seen from the air. A moment later his craft nosed out into the canal. He
  dropped anchor about five hundred feet from the mouth of the cave and waited.
  Presently the other ship came up and anchored beside him.</p>

  <p>A mojak with a company of warriors, whose duty it was to patrol the canal
  bank, came hurrying up and hailed him. "What was that firing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We were pursued by the Reabonians," San Thoy replied. "They nearly had
  us. We just got through the gates in time."</p>

  <p>"But did they not see the gates? Perhaps the secret way is not known to
  them."</p>

  <p>Perhaps, agreed San Thoy.</p>

  <p>"You have lied to me," accused the mojak. "That firing was inside the
  cave."</p>

  <p>"Go and see for yourself," suggested San Thoy.</p>

  <p>"I will. Let me take a boat."</p>

  <p>"Not you. You are too uncivil."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll take one by force."</p>

  <p>"Try it." San Thoy waved his hand, and fully two-score mattorks were
  trained on the mojak and his warriors. At this, the officer turned and
  whispered to a fat mojo who stood beside him. The fellow evidently counseled
  retreat, for they turned and marched away, leaving only a dozen men to watch
  the ships.</p>

  <p>"They go to warn the city," said San Thoy's mojo.</p>

  <p>"What odds?" replied San Thoy. "The mojak will order an investigation. A
  body of troops will be mobilized and marched back here. By that time our
  allies will have arrived, and the Reabonian army will be storming the city.
  Zinlo must have seen our signal, long since, and notified the fleets of
  Reabon, Tyrhana, and Adonijar."</p>

  <p>Zinlo, in his aerial battleship, had ordered his commander to soar to the
  southeast of the city of Huitsen. They were hovering just above the ship
  canal. Kantar and Narine were watching the landscape below through one of the
  keel windows.</p>

  <p>"Look!" cried Narine. "A ship is coming out of the cave."</p>

  <p>Zinlo, who had been consulting with Lotar, seized his glasses and leveled
  them on the ship.</p>

  <p>"It's San Thoy," he announced, "and the way is open. To the flagship of
  Ad, Lotar."</p>

  <p>The ship shot forward with a tremendous burst of speed. In less than a
  minute it was far out over the Azpok, where the ships of the allies waited.
  The foremost of these was the flagship of Ad of Tyrhana.</p>

  <p>With a swiftness that made Kantar's ears ring, the airship dropped. It
  came to a stop beside Ad's flagship as lightly as if it had fallen into a bed
  of thistledown.</p>

  <p>Zinlo opened a side door. Not twenty feet from him, Ad stood on the
  foredeck of his fighting-craft.</p>

  <p>"The way is open," announced the Prince of Olba.</p>

  <p>"Good! I'll see you in the palace of Huitsen," replied Ad. Then he waved
  his hand to a sailor, who instantly ran a pennant to the masthead. Almost
  immediately, similar flags were hoisted by the other ships, showing that they
  had caught the signal. Then the sails were unfurled, and with the assistance
  of a swift landward breeze, the allied flotillas rapidly made their way
  toward the secret entrance to Huitsen.</p>

  <p>Once more the flagship of Zinlo darted back above the city, this time just
  over the lowest cloud stratum. Here the air fleet of Olba hovered, waiting
  orders. The Torrogo's signal man stood forth on the deck just in front of the
  forward turret. In his right hand he held an immense red disk, and in his
  left, a yellow. He began making motions with one, then the other, then both,
  repeating them in numerous combinations which were evidently understood by
  the mojaks of the other battleships, as they immediately moved from their
  places and formed an immense circle which corresponded to the circumference
  of the city beneath. There they hovered, awaiting further orders.</p>

  <p>Zinlo's own ship dropped once more into the lowest cloud stratum, high
  enough to be out of sight, but low enough so that he could watch
  developments. Presently another ship dropped down beside him. He opened a
  side door, and the commander of the ship did likewise.</p>

  <p>"What news?" asked Zinlo.</p>

  <p>"We caught up with the column of Ibbits, Your Majesty," replied the mojak.
  "Their Majesties of Reabon were not with them. The officer in command swore
  that Grandon of Terra had slain their Rogo and ridden away with his wife. He
  said they would have followed, but a blizzard obliterated the trail, so they
  decided to continue southward, bearing the body of their Rogo."</p>

  <p>"Then what did you do?"</p>

  <p>"We circled the snowy plain in all directions, and presently found a
  trail. From the tracks and kerra juice which spattered the snow, we knew it
  was the trail of a party of Huitsenni, mounted on zandars. It led us to the
  mouth of a cave, before which an enormous white strid lay dead. Inside the
  cave we found the smoldering remains of a web, the charred carcasses of three
  young strids, and a number of charred eggs.</p>

  <p>"On coming out, however, we noticed and followed another trail, which led
  from a near-by cave. It was the trail of a man and woman. They had not
  returned to the cave from which they had come, neither were their remains in
  the cave of the strid; so we judged they had been captured by the party of
  mounted Huitsenni. The fact that the return trail of the yellow men led
  straight back to the city confirmed our belief."</p>

  <p>"You have done well," said Zinlo. "Now take your squadron and get into the
  formation above. I'll signal you when to descend." He closed the door.</p>

  <p>Kantar, who had been listening to the conversation, said: "Your Majesty, I
  have a favor to ask."</p>

  <p>"Name it," replied Zinlo. "You will deserve any favor within my power to
  confer."</p>

  <p>"I would be set on one of the balconies of the palace of Huitsen, with two
  men to assist me."</p>

  <p>"Impossible," replied Zinlo. "Our plans would be betrayed, and we would
  lose every advantage which a surprise attack would bring us."</p>

  <p>"I am convinced, Majesty," said Kantar, "that their Majesties of Reabon
  are prisoners in the palace. Grandon of Terra slew Yin Yin, Rogo of Huitsen.
  Under the circumstances, Yin Yin's successor can do no less than order his
  execution. Perhaps he has already done so, in which event I shall be too
  late. But I would be there to prevent it, if I can."</p>

  <p>"What could three men do?"</p>

  <p>"If I could reach one of the inner balconies that overlook the throne room
  with a man or two to guard my back and a tork in my hands, I could do
  much."</p>

  <p>"You are right, Gunner. A tork in your hands is worth a hundred in the
  hands of ordinary men. And, after all, we're more anxious to save Grandon and
  Vernia than to take the city." He called to Lotar. "Send me two warriors.
  Then you will drop suddenly beside one of the outer balconies of the palace.
  As soon as the warriors have disembarked, you will swiftly return to this
  position."</p>

  <p>"I hear and obey," replied Lotar.</p>

  <p>Zinlo's orders were swiftly carried out.</p>

  <p>Kantar bent over Narine's hand, but she snatched it free, and threw her
  arms around his neck.</p>

  <p>"It may be that you go to your death, my brave gunner," she cried. "Hold
  me tight. Tell me again that you love me."</p>

  <p>Zinlo halted the two warriors in the doorway. Then he coughed
  discreetly.</p>

  <p>"We have arrived at the palace, Gunner. Come quickly, or we shall be shot
  down."</p>

  <p>A side door was flung open. Her eyes sparkling with love and pride, Narine
  watched Kantar and the two warriors leap to the balcony. Then the door was
  closed, and before a single enemy mattork could be trained on it, the ship
  shot aloft and disappeared into the clouds.</p>

  <p>Hovering there in the lower cloud stratum, Zinlo kept his glasses focused
  on the canal. Presently he cried: "There is Ads flagship. Another follows,
  and another. It is time for the offensive."</p>

  <p>He turned and gave swift orders to Lotar. The flagship rose above the
  first cloud stratum where the fleet waited, still in circular formation. The
  signal man flashed his red and yellow disks. Then Zinlo's ship took a place
  in the circle and began spiraling downward. Behind it followed the entire air
  fleet.</p>

  <p>As soon as the flagship was through the lower cloud stratum, its keel
  mattorks went into action. The mattorks of the fleet instantly followed suit.
  There was a burst of flame from the ground beneath them as the Reabonian
  artillery opened fire, and great breaches began appearing in the city
  walls.</p>

  <p>Then a long shout went up, and the long line of Reabonian infantry, which
  had been waiting in hiding, sprang forward, the light glinting from the
  barrels of its torks, and from its scarbos and long-bladed spears.</p>

  <p>The ship canal was now filled with enemy vessels, following one another in
  close formation. Entering the landlocked harbor were the two captured pirate
  vessels&mdash;the first commanded by San Thoy.</p>

  <p>The vessels which were anchored in the harbor immediately opened fire,
  concentrating on these two ships. San Thoy's vessel was riddled by
  shell-fire, and began to sink rapidly. He instantly ran it up beside an
  anchored vessel, and leading his mixed crew of white and yellow warriors,
  boarded the new craft. Only a few sailors were aboard, and these were quickly
  cut down.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the mighty flagship of Ad of Tyrhana had nosed into the
  harbor. The withering blasts from its heavy mattorks literally blew some of
  the smaller pirate craft out of the water, and wrought havoc with the larger
  vessels.</p>

  <p>It was closely followed by the huge flagships of Reabon and Adonijar,
  whose powerful mattorks were equally efficient. And close on the heels of
  these, crowded the battleships of the allied fleet.</p>

  <p>One by one, every pirate vessel that offered resistance was sunk or
  captured. Soon the allies were in complete command of the harbor. This
  accomplished, they landed warriors under cover of a heavy barrage, took the
  docks and warehouses with virtually no resistance, and marched into the
  city.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the Reabonian infantry was meeting with desperate
  resistance around the city walls. Time and again, Grandon's brave warriors
  charged into the breaches made by their artillery, only to be hurled back by
  the desperate defenders.</p>

  <p>Presently, however, a contingent of fighting Traveks, Grandon's fierce
  warriors from the mountain fastnesses of Uxpo, broke through and charged
  straight for the palace.</p>

  <p>The commander of the Huitsenni had anticipated just such an emergency, and
  was prepared to meet it. Mounted on zandars, firing their torks and
  brandishing their heavy scarbos, a yelling horde of reserves thundered
  straight at the charging Traveks.</p>

  <p>The Uxponian mountaineers in the first line instantly knelt and presented
  their long-bladed spears, while their comrades immediately behind them fired
  over their heads at the swiftly approaching enemy. The two forces met with a
  terrific shock in which tough spear-shafts were splintered, scarbos flashed,
  and torks spat incessantly. In an instant the first line was a bloody
  shambles of dead and wounded men and zandars. At this point, wave after wave
  met, until the pile of dead, inextricably mingled with wounded men and maimed
  and struggling beasts, was so high that neither side could advance, both
  using it as a rampart over which to fire their torks.</p>

  <p>The Reabonians, however, fighting shoulder to shoulder with their Uxponian
  brothers on either side, had quickly widened the breach made by the Traveks.
  Now they too, charged into the city, soon enveloping the mounted Huitsenni
  until all chance of retreat for the yellow cavalry was lost. Seeing that
  further resistance was hopeless, they threw down their arms, and clasped
  their hands behind their heads in token of surrender.</p>

  <p>Leaving a few of their comrades to guard the prisoners and aid the wounded
  the Traveks again charged forward with the Reabonians, helping to drive the
  yellow infantry toward the palace. "For Grandon and Vernia!" they shouted.
  "Down with Huitsen!"</p>

  <p>From beyond the palace, a tremendous cheer answered them, as the allied
  warriors from the battleships drove the Huitsenni back.</p>

  <p>While his keel mattorks kept up a continuous bombardment of the yellow
  army beneath, Zinlo watched these beginnings of victory with satisfaction.
  Then he suddenly saw that for which he had been waiting. Out from those
  buildings surrounding and closest to the palace, and from the fishing holes
  in the vicinity, there appeared a swarm of Huitsenni, armed and dressed like
  the others, with the exception that each man wore a white scarf knotted
  around his neck and thrown over his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Part of this new force charged straight for the palace, and the remainder
  formed a great skirmish line to cut off the approach of the retreating
  Huitsenni.</p>

  <p>"It's the Chispoks!" cried Zinlo. "To the palace, Lotar."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">19.</a> &mdash; THE DUEL</h2>

  <p class="first">Back in the throne room of Thid Yet, Rogo of Huitsen,
  Grandon, who had been forced to his knees by his two burly guards awaited the
  stroke of Ez Bin, the headsman. He saw the huge blade flash upward, and
  nerved himself for a mighty effort. As the two handed scarbo descended, he
  flung himself backward carrying both guards with him. The heavy blade crashed
  to the polished glass door, and many tiny cracks radiated from the point
  where it had struck.</p>

  <p>Grandon instantly flung his right arm forward once more. The guard who
  clung to it tripped over the blade of Ez Bin, and losing his hold, fell on
  his face before the throne. His right arm now free, Grandon snatched the
  scarbo which depended from the belt of the other guard, and ran him
  through.</p>

  <p>At this, one of Vernia's guards sprang forward and struck at Grandon with
  his scarbo. The Earthman side-stepped the blow and countered with a slash to
  the head that stretched his opponent on the floor. In the meantime, Ez Bin
  had recovered his weapon, and made a terrific swing at Grandon's neck.
  Dodging beneath the blade, the Earthman stabbed upward and thrust him through
  the throat. Then, before anyone could stop him, he sprang straight for the
  monarch who squatted on the throne.</p>

  <p>With screams of terror, the slave girls scattered. But Thid Yet whipped
  out his scarbo and leaped to his feet. He had not been Rogo long enough to
  become fat and flabby like Yin Yin from easy living, nor was he a coward, but
  despite his great girth, a trained fighting man in the peak of condition, and
  the veteran of many hand-to-hand encounters which had made him the most
  feared duelist in Huitsen.</p>

  <p>"Stand back," he shouted to the nobles and soldiers who had begun to crowd
  around. "Stand back and watch your Rogo carve the heart from this white-
  skinned slave who dares to attack the throne of Huitsen."</p>

  <p>To the courtiers of Huitsen their ruler's word was absolutely law; so they
  fell back and made room for the two combatants. Nor were any of them worried
  as to the outcome. Thid Yet had not time to select any favorites from among
  those who stood about his throne, which he had seized with the assistance of
  the navy faction, nor had he, as yet, conferred any honors or, promotions. If
  he were slain, another would take his place, probably no better or no worse,
  and Grandon could easily be dealt with.</p>

  <p>It was evident, as Thid Yet sprang forward to meet the Earthman, that
  despite Grandon's reputation as a swordsman, he was positive he could easily
  best him&mdash;that it would be an opportunity to add to his laurels and
  convince the Huitsenni beyond all doubt that they were ruled by a brave
  man.</p>

  <p>As their blades clashed, and Grandon felt the strength of his wrist and
  met the lightning speed of his attack, he knew he had an opponent worthy of
  his steel and that the outcome was indeed doubtful. Blood was drawn on both
  sides at the very start. First Thid Yet's point raked Grandon's cheek cutting
  a deep gash. Then the Earthman countered with a swift head cut. The Rogo
  parried in time to save his head, but not his ear, which was shorn off by the
  blow.</p>

  <p>The spectators cried out in delighted amazement at the swift and brilliant
  sword-play that followed. Trained from infancy in the use of the scarbo,
  these men of Huitsen knew that they were witnessing a duel the like of which
  they might never see again were they to live a dozen lifetimes. One after
  another, Grandon tried all the tricks he had learned from his old fencing
  master, Le Blanc, and from the numerous scarbo experts he had encountered.
  But thrust or cut as he would, the darting blade of Thid Yet was there to
  meet his, and to counter with a lightning slash or a swift riposte. Time and
  again Grandon received wounds which might have been fatal had he not
  succeeded in parrying them or springing back just in time. And for every
  wound he received, the yellow Rogo was dealt two, though he was equally
  successful in avoiding a fatal injury.</p>

  <p>Bathed in blood and perspiration, the two contestants fought back and
  forth over an area that had become slippery with their own gore. Grandon's
  sword arm began to ache. His head swam dizzily. Loss of blood was beginning
  to sap his strength. He wondered how Thid Yet, who appeared to be losing more
  blood than he, could stand the terrific exertion. And wondering, he began to
  conserve his strength, to fight a defensive rather than an offensive battle,
  and to wait.</p>

  <p>Presently the Earthman felt the arm of his adversary begin to weaken.
  Still he fought cautiously, reserving his strength for a final effort&mdash;
  waiting. Suddenly Thid Yet extended his weapon in a vicious but clumsy thrust
  at Grandon's left breast. With a quick parry, and a narrow moulinet ending in
  a swift, drawing cut, the Earthman brought his keen blade down on his
  opponent's extended wrist, shearing through muscle and bone. The scarbo of
  the Rogo clattered to the floor, his severed hand still clinging to the
  grip.</p>

  <p>Thid Yet uttered a grunt of surprise and pain and stared at his spurting
  wrist for a moment as if he could not believe what he saw. Then he clamped
  the fingers of his left hand just behind the stump to stay the bleeding, and
  staggered backward, collapsed against the base of his throne.</p>

  <p>In the uproar that followed, Grandon leaped back to where Vernia, who had
  recovered consciousness shortly after the duel commenced and watched it with
  bated breath, stood in the custody of her remaining guard. The fellow reached
  for his scarbo, but not quickly enough. He died with the blade half out of
  the scabbard and Grandon's point through his heart. With his left arm around
  his wife's slender waist, Grandon waved his bloody scarbo, menacing the
  nobles and warriors who were crowding around him.</p>

  <p>One elevated his tork, but before he could use it, there was a report from
  an upper balcony, and he pitched forward on his face. A voice rang out from
  above them. "Back, all of you, and lay down your arms. The first to menace
  Their Majesties dies."</p>

  <p>Looking up, Grandon saw Kantar standing on a balcony, his tork muzzle
  pointed over the railing. Behind him, two Olban warriors guarded the
  door.</p>

  <p>A number of the nobles had rushed to Thid Yet's assistance. Two of them
  helped him to the throne, while a third tightly bound his wrist with a strip
  of silk torn from his own cloak. The cat-like eyes of the Rogo glittered with
  hatred.</p>

  <p>"Shoot them," he groaned. "Slay them all."</p>

  <p>A noble reached for his tork, followed by two more. But as swiftly as they
  went for their weapons, the tork of the gunner spoke. One after another they
  sank to the floor. The lesson was not lost on the others. Most of them
  quickly complied with Kantar's request by opening their belts and letting
  their weapons drop to the floor. Then they clasped their hands behind their
  heads in token of surrender. A few guards who had rushed in from the outer
  corridors to learn the cause of the disturbance, quickly followed their
  example.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" cried Thid Yet. "Is my entire court to be captured by a
  single marksman?" He reached for his own tork. Then a bullet drilled him
  neatly between the eyes and he slumped forward, dead.</p>

  <p>This settled the matter for those who had hesitated to obey the commands
  of the sharp-shooting gunner. They all dropped their weapons and clasped
  their hands behind their heads.</p>

  <p>Leaving one of his companions to cover the group while the other still
  watched the door, Kantar dropped from balcony to balcony until he reached the
  floor. Scarcely had his feet touched its mirrored surface when a terrific
  bombardment commenced outside. He ran over to where Grandon and Vernia stood,
  and made obeisance.</p>

  <p>"What's all the shooting about outside?" asked Grandon.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty's warriors are attacking the city," replied Kantar, "under
  cover of a barrage from the artillery. The air fleet of Olba is also
  bombarding the city, as are the ships of Reabon, Tyrhana, and Adonijar, which
  are now fighting their way into the harbor and coming up the canal."</p>

  <p>"But you! Where did you come from with these Olban warriors? Did you drop
  from the sky?"</p>

  <p>"In truth, I did, Majesty. Zinlo of Olba, at my request, dropped me on one
  of the outer balconies of the palace with these two warriors. His airship was
  not fired upon, as it came and went so suddenly that the Huitsenni had no
  time to train their heavy mattorks on it. I hoped to find you here, as a
  squadron sent to follow the party of Ibbits with whom Your Majesties were
  supposed to be traveling, returned to report that you were not with them. I
  feared that your lives would be put in jeopardy by the attack, and so came
  before the assault. By arguing with our scarbos, we convinced several yellow
  guards who barred our way that we had important business with the Rogo of
  Huitsen. Then we came to the inner balcony."</p>

  <p>"You came in the nick of time, Gunner," said Grandon, "and I'm eternally
  grateful. Now, let's get out of here."</p>

  <p>The gunner signaled to the Olban warrior on the balcony. He called to his
  companion, and the two dropped from balcony to balcony under the protection
  of the watchful gunner's tork, until they reached the floor.</p>

  <p>"What shall we do with these prisoners, Majesty?" asked Kantar, indicating
  the group of disarmed nobles, officers, and slaves who still stood with their
  hands clasped behind their heads.</p>

  <p>Grandon thought for a moment. "We'll take them with us," he decided. "It
  is the only way. Let the two Olban warriors bind their hands behind their
  backs."</p>

  <p>While the members of the group were being bound with strips torn from
  their own clothing, Grandon selected a tork and ammunition belt from the pile
  of weapons. He also exchanged his nicked and bloody scarbo for a jewel-hilted
  weapon which had belonged to one of the nobles. Vernia also armed herself,
  and the two assisted Kantar to keep watch on the balconies and doorways. But
  it soon appeared that there was no need for this. Evidently the thunder of
  the conflict outside had prevented the palace inmates from taking any
  interest in what went on in the throne room.</p>

  <p>As soon as the prisoners had been bound, Grandon divided them into two
  groups, one to march before them, and one behind. Then, with Grandon and
  Kantar covering the group that marched before and the two Olbans walking
  backward with their torks trained on those who came behind, they passed out
  into the corridor which led to the main gate.</p>

  <p>They had scarcely moved twenty feet along this corridor, when a
  considerable body of Huitsenni, wearing white scarves around their necks,
  poured in from a side corridor. Grandon instantly elevated his tork, but
  Kantar, recognizing the white scarves as the symbol previously agreed upon,
  stayed his hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot, Majesty," he said. "These are friends." He called to the
  advancing warriors. "Ho, Chispoks. We are brothers and allies. Relieve us of
  these prisoners."</p>

  <p>"Gladly, brothers. We were sent by Han Lay to rescue you, and assist in
  taking the palace but you have evidently been able to take care of
  yourselves."</p>

  <p>"Is the palace taken?" Grandon asked the mojak of the band.</p>

  <p>The officer bowed low. "No, Majesty. But it soon will be. Already a
  thousand of the brotherhood have come in through the boat entrances, and they
  are fighting their way to the top. Five thousand more are storming the gates
  on the street level, and the rest stand ready to cut off the retreating army
  of Thid Yet."</p>

  <p>Then my soldiers have broken through?"</p>

  <p>"They have, Majesty, and drive the army of the false Rogo before them like
  frightened frellas, while the warriors from the ships close in from the other
  side."</p>

  <p>"The false Rogo is now a dead Rogo," Grandon told him. "But where is Han
  Lay?"</p>

  <p>"He was to lead the charge on the palace gate, so it is there he will be
  if he has not fallen."</p>

  <p>"Then let us charge through from the inside. It will make victory swifter
  and easier."</p>

  <p>"But most of my men are fighting on the upper floors."</p>

  <p>"Never mind. Can you spare twenty?"</p>

  <p>"Assuredly. Fifty."</p>

  <p>"Splendid! I will lead them." He turned to the two Olbans, who, relieved
  of their prisoners, awaited orders. "Guard Her Majesty well," he commanded.
  Then to Kantar. "Come, Gunner."</p>

  <p>Followed by the fifty men whom the mojak had detailed to accompany them,
  Grandon and Kantar led the charge through the entrance, and straight into the
  melee where the palace guards strove with the Chispoks at the gate. For some
  minutes the guards, beset from both sides, offered halfhearted resistance.
  Then one by one they threw down their weapons and clasped their hands behind
  their heads. The attacking Chispoks surged in, with Han Lay at their
  head.</p>

  <p>"I rejoice to find you alive, Majesty," said Han Lay, rendering the royal
  salute to Grandon.</p>

  <p>"And I, you, Your Majesty soon to be," replied Grandon, returning his
  salute.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a string of aerial battleships dropped down from the sky and
  circled the palace. Swiftly their mattorks silenced the weapons of those who
  fired at them. Then they sailed up to the balconies at the various levels,
  and Olban warriors poured down their aluminum stairways into the palace. The
  leading airship settled beside the palace gate. The steps dropped and down
  them came Zinlo and Narine.</p>

  <p>Grandon and Zinlo saluted each other in the Zorovian fashion, then puzzled
  those who stood around them by enthusiastically shaking hands, a purely
  earthly demonstration which was unknown on Venus.</p>

  <p>"I see that you are in at the kill, in spite of the fact that we couldn't
  notify you," said Zinlo.</p>

  <p>"Decidedly," replied Grandon. "Where are Ad and Aardvan?"</p>

  <p>"Coming. They have just accepted the surrender of the Romojak of Huitsen,
  and will be here in a moment."</p>

  <p>Grandon presented Han Lay to Zinlo and Narine. Then Vernia came out,
  accompanied by her two Olban guards, and to her he was also presented.</p>

  <p>A moment later, three men strode up to the palace gate, a half-dozen
  warriors making way for them through the vast multitude that had gathered
  there. They were Ad of Tyrhana, Aardvan of Adonijar, and San Thoy. Grandon
  held a short conference with his allies. Then, accompanied by Han Lay, he
  mounted to the top step of the aluminum stairs which led to Zinlo's flagship.
  It was a position from which he could command a view of the entire crowd, and
  be seen by them.</p>

  <p>"People of Huitsen," he shouted. "First of all, I want to tell you, and I
  speak on behalf of my allies as well as myself, that we are not here to exact
  tributes or reparations, nor to gloat over a prostrate foe. On the contrary,
  we wish to establish friendly relations with the people of Huitsen&mdash;
  relations that will last through the years. The officer and renowned warrior
  who stands here beside me is willing to meet the conditions which will best
  foster these relations, namely, an abolition of piracy, the freeing of all
  slaves who have been acquired by buccaneering and coastal raids, and the
  entry of Huitsen into peaceful commerce with the other nations of this
  planet.</p>

  <p>"Being in full accord with these policies, we will withdraw our warriors
  as soon as a treaty is concluded with him, if you will acclaim him your Rogo.
  What is your pleasure?"</p>

  <p>"Han Lay for Rogo," shouted a warrior, and the shout was taken up by a
  thousand throats.</p>

  <p>Presently Grandon held up his hand for silence. When the clamor had
  ceased, he said: "Have you any other candidates to propose?"</p>

  <p>No one spoke. He waited for a moment. "Then acclaim him," he cried.</p>

  <p>"Hail Han Lay, Rogo of Huitsen!" roared the crowd, as with one voice.</p>

  <p>When the shouting had subsided to a murmur, Grandon turned to Han Lay, and
  said: "I have a suggestion, Your Majesty. There is one who, though he has his
  little weaknesses, has been largely instrumental in the consummation of this
  glorious victory. I refer to San Thoy, and recommend that he be suitably
  rewarded."</p>

  <p>The new Rogo beckoned to San Thoy, who came and made obeisance before
  him.</p>

  <p>"Rise, San Thoy, Romojak of the Navies of Huitsen," said Han Lay.</p>

  <p>Then he and Grandon descended the ladder, and amid the cheering of the
  populace, the royal group, attended by their officers and guards, went into
  the palace.</p>

  <p>As they entered, Han Lay, who was walking beside Grandon, said: "What of
  this lascivious Rogo who was the cause of Her Majesty's abduction? Can we be
  of assistance in bringing him to justice?"</p>

  <p>"You can, decidedly," replied Grandon. "I had already thought of a plan. I
  should like to borrow one of your largest vessels complete with officers and
  crew, with San Thoy in command. Also if you can furnish me with a sculptor
  who can make a life-like image of one who will pose for him, say in wax, or
  some such material, I shall be able to complete my plans without great
  difficulty."</p>

  <p>"These are but trifles," protested Han Lay. "A ship will be put at your
  disposal immediately, and within the hour a dozen such sculptors as you
  require will await your pleasure."</p>

  <p>"Excellent! As soon as I have had these scratches dressed, I'll explain my
  plan to you."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">20.</a> &mdash; RETRIBUTION AND REWARD</h2>

  <p class="first">Ten days had elapsed since the fall of Huitsen. On the day
  following their victory, the ships and warriors of the allies had sailed
  away. Only a part of the Olban air fleet remained, while Grandon, Vernia,
  Zinlo, Loralie, Kantar, and Narine stayed at the palace as the guests of the
  new Rogo. Now Han Lay stood on the palace steps, surrounded by his nobles and
  officers, to bid his friends farewell.</p>

  <p>Zinlo's flagship had descended to the ground, and two of its aluminum
  staircases had been lowered. Up one of these a number of Huitsenni struggled
  with two heavy, coffin-like chests, and passed them to the waiting
  Olbans.</p>

  <p>Farewells were said, and, one by one, Han Lay's guests mounted the other
  stairway. The stairs were raised, the doors were closed, and the mighty
  airship shot skyward, while the people cheered and the palace mattorks
  thundered a farewell salute.</p>

  <p>At an elevation of about two thousand feet, the flagship darted seaward,
  followed by the fleet, which had been hovering above the palace.</p>

  <p>Installed in his luxurious cabin, Zinlo's guests sipped kova and chatted
  gayly. Having seen to their comforts, the Torrogo of Olba climbed to the
  forward turret to note their progress.</p>

  <p>Presently Grandon joined him. "Are you sure we can catch San Thoy before
  he reaches the rendezvous," he asked.</p>

  <p>"Positive,". Zinlo replied. "We have already covered half the
  distance."</p>

  <p>"Marvelous! How fast will these things go, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"Earth distance and time, about a thousand miles an hour. In Olba, the
  speed is reckoned in rotations of the planet at its equator, or fractions
  thereof. Our smallest and slowest ships make at least a quarter of a
  rotation. This one can easily do a rotation."</p>

  <p>"I thought the shoreline of Huitsen receded pretty fast, but I didn't know
  it was quite that speedy. Look! We're passing over a fleet, now."</p>

  <p>"That's Ad of Tyrhana, ready to attack Zanaloth from the south. See that
  fleet over to the west? That's Aardvan spoiling for a fight. Your own ships
  are over at your right, and the fleet that set sail from Reabon under your
  orders should be within twenty-five miles of the north coast of the Island of
  the Valkars by now."</p>

  <p>"Why, there's San Thoy's ship, already."</p>

  <p>"Right. We'll ascend and do a little scouting before we drop you off."</p>

  <p>He gave several swift orders to his Romojak. Then the entire fleet of
  aircraft shot skyward, and entered the lowest cloud stratum.</p>

  <p>Looking down through the thin veil of vapor, Grandon presently descried an
  island, the Island of the Valkars. Anchored off its tiny harbor was a single
  battleship, flying the flag of Mernerum. But behind a jutting promontory,
  only a little way off, fully fifty big battleships lurked.</p>

  <p>"It's just as you thought," said Zinlo, at sight of the concealed ships.
  "Either Zanaloth was afraid of treachery on the part of the Huitsenni, or he
  intended treachery toward them. He came prepared for trouble, in any
  event."</p>

  <p>They cruised toward the north a few minutes longer, and Grandon saw
  another fleet, consisting of fully a hundred splendid battleships, the pride
  of Reabon's navy, sailing toward the island. Zinlo saw them, too, and
  immediately gave orders to turn back.</p>

  <p>"All is ready," he said. "Now, if you still insist, I'll put you on San
  Thoy's ship, but I can't for the life of me see the sense of it. We've got
  them bottled up, anyway, and it won't be much of a job to lick them."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why I insist on carrying out my plan," replied Grandon.
  "It's the only way I can make sure of meeting my worst enemy face to
  face."</p>

  <p>"I see. You want the pleasure of killing him, yourself. Well I don't blame
  you."</p>

  <p>They paused, at this moment, above the bat-winged vessel which Han Lay had
  lent to Grandon, and Zinlo gave orders for them to descend.</p>

  <p>Lightly the airship dropped beside the vessel. Grappling-irons were tossed
  aboard, and the two stairways let down. Grandon bade his friends good-bye,
  and took Vernia in his arms. She clung to him at the door&mdash;begged him
  not to go.</p>

  <p>"You are putting your head in the mouth of a marmelot," she said. "Why not
  capture him first, then deal with him afterward? I'm afraid for you."</p>

  <p>"And I," replied Grandon, "am afraid he might otherwise escape me. This
  way, he will not."</p>

  <p>As he descended the ladder, San Thoy stood on the deck to greet him,
  mumbling kerra spores and grinning toothlessly. In the meantime, the two
  casket-like chests which had been brought in the airship were lowered to the
  deck of the vessel. The stairs were drawn up and the grappling irons cast
  off.</p>

  <p>Grandon waved farewell to his friends, and entered the cabin of the bowing
  San Thoy.</p>

  <p>Zanaloth, dissolute Torrogo of Mernerum, sat at the gold-topped table in
  the luxurious cabin of his flagship, sipping kova. Oglo, Romojak of the
  Imperial Navy, stood at attention, awaiting his pleasure.</p>

  <p>Presently the dissipated Torrogo turned his bloated countenance toward his
  chief naval officer, and said: "The time is nearly at hand, Oglo. Are you
  positive that everything is ready?"</p>

  <p>"Positive, Your Majesty. A thousand warriors are concealed in the hold,
  awaiting instructions. Our fleet lurks in readiness to come to us under full
  sail at the boom of the first mattork."</p>

  <p>Zanaloth emptied his kova bowl and smacked his thick, sensuous lips. "Very
  good. Very good, indeed. If the pirates come in a single ship, as we agreed,
  we can capture it. If they mean treachery, and have other vessels standing by
  to attack us, they will be easily taken care of by our battle fleet.</p>

  <p>"Now let us review your instructions, so there will be no mistakes. As
  soon as the pirates display the royal prisoner, we will request that she be
  brought aboard our vessel. They, on their side, will no doubt insist that the
  gold be transferred to their ship. We will agree to this, and begin
  transferring the gold. But as soon as the Princess of Reabon is safely inside
  this cabin, I will enter in and close the door. That will be your signal to
  attack. Let the warriors take the place of the gold-passers and charge into
  the other ship. See that you have plenty of grappling irons aboard her, so
  she cannot slip away from us. And don't forget to go into action immediately
  with the mattorks, so the battle fleet will know they are to start at
  once."</p>

  <p>"To hear Your Majesty is to obey," replied Oglo.</p>

  <p>"And remember. Every man aboard the pirate vessel must die. If need be, we
  will sink their ship, but first we must try to get back what gold has been
  taken aboard her. As for the slaves we are supposed to have put ashore for
  them, the pirates will not live to look for them. We will have both the girl
  and the gold, and the Rogo of Huitsen will perhaps guess that he has been
  beaten at his own game, but he will have no proof."</p>

  <p>"I will not forget Majesty."</p>

  <p>"If your head fails you in this, I promise it will no longer remain on
  your shoulders to trouble you. Go, now, and watch for that ship."</p>

  <p>Oglo made profound obeisance, and withdrew.</p>

  <p>Zanaloth fidgeted impatiently. Presently he quaffed another bowl of kova
  and getting ponderously to his feet, paced the floor.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the door was flung open, and Oglo, bowing on the threshold
  announced breathlessly: "A sail, Majesty! A pirate sail!"</p>

  <p>Zanaloth grunted. "So! They come to the rendezvous at last."</p>

  <p>He squeezed his ample girth through the doorway, and walked forward, Oglo
  following at a respectful distance. Then he took the glass which his romojak
  obsequiously proffered, and focused it on the approaching vessel. Traveling
  under full sail before a stiff breeze, it was making considerable speed.</p>

  <p>"Bones of Thorth!" he exclaimed. "We must save that splendid ship, if
  possible. It flies over the water like an ormf. A few alterations, and it
  will never be recognized."</p>

  <p>As if its commander had no suspicion of treachery, the pirate ship sailed
  swiftly up to them, hove to, and dropped its anchors. An officer came out of
  a cabin, wearing the uniform of a romojak, and Zanaloth hailed him.</p>

  <p>"Are you Thid Yet, Romojak of Huitsen," he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I am San Thoy, Romojak of Huitsen," was the reply. "Thid Yet is dead,
  and I have come to keep the rendezvous in his place."</p>

  <p>"You have brought the royal slave-girl?"</p>

  <p>"We have, Your Majesty. And what of the gold?"</p>

  <p>"We stand ready to deliver it to you. But first let me see the royal
  prisoner."</p>

  <p>"What of the slaves you were to place on the island for us?"</p>

  <p>"They are there, under guard, awaiting your pleasure. But let us see your
  prisoner."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Majesty."</p>

  <p>San Thoy went into a cabin, and remained for several minutes. Then he came
  out, alone. "She has fainted, Your Majesty. Will you not come aboard and see
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Hal What's this? Perhaps you have not brought her, after all."</p>

  <p>"Well then, if you doubt my word, I'll have her carried out, so you may
  view her."</p>

  <p>He raised his hand, and a mojak entered the cabin. He came out in a
  moment, followed by four Huitsenni, who bore a litter on which reposed the
  golden-haired, richly clad figure of a young woman.</p>

  <p>Zanaloth stared until he was watery-eyed. Then he focused his glass on the
  recumbent figure and stared again.</p>

  <p>"By the blood and body of Thorth!" he exclaimed to Oglo. "It is she. It
  must be. For nowhere on Zorovia is there beauty such as hers." To San Thoy he
  called: "I am satisfied. Let us draw the ships together with grappling irons.
  My men are ready to unload the gold."</p>

  <p>Irons were quickly hurled from ship to ship, and the chains, drawn taut by
  hand-turned winches, gradually drew the two vessels together. This achieved
  gang-planks were dropped across, fore and aft, and Zanaloth's men began
  carrying bars of gold to the pirate ship from the after hold, to be checked,
  weighed, and received by members of the yellow crew.</p>

  <p>For some time Zanaloth and San Thoy chatted across the rails. Then the
  latter said: "Nearly half the gold is unloaded. Shall we convey Her Majesty
  to the quarters you have provided for her?"</p>

  <p>This was precisely what Zanaloth wanted, but he did not wish to appear too
  eager. "At your convenience," he replied. "The cabin behind me has been
  prepared for her."</p>

  <p>San Thoy signaled to the officer who stood near the recumbent figure. The
  officer gave a command, and four Huitsenni took up the litter, while four
  more came out from the cabin and fell in behind them with a heavy, ornate
  chest about seven feet in length.</p>

  <p>"What is in that chest?" asked Zanaloth, suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"A few of Her Majesty's belongings," replied San Thoy. "Mostly wearing
  apparel and ornaments."</p>

  <p>San Thoy himself crossed the gang-plank ahead of the others.</p>

  <p>"This cabin?" he asked, indicating the door of Zanaloth's cabin.</p>

  <p>"That is right. Just leave her in there, and I'll call the ship's doctor
  to attend her in a moment."</p>

  <p>Zanaloth drank in the beauty of the recumbent girlish form as it was borne
  past him. "How still she is!" he thought. "Perhaps she is dead, and they have
  tricked me." But a searching look at the red lips and pink cheeks reassured
  him. "No corpse could have such bloom of life and health as this," he
  reasoned.</p>

  <p>Under the supervision of their officer, the eight men placed the litter
  and the large chest in the cabin. Then they retired.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me," said Zanaloth, formally, "if I go to examine the
  merchandise I have purchased at so high a price."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly," replied San Thoy. "I will, in the meantime, take a closer
  look at the gold with which it was purchased." He bowed low, with right hand
  extended palm downward, and turning, crossed the plank to his own ship.</p>

  <p>Zanaloth watched his broad back with a supercilious sneer, until he had
  reached his own vessel. Then, with a significant glance at Oglo, he swung on
  his heel, and entering his cabin, slammed the door shut behind him. The boom
  of a mattork outside, instantly followed his action. It was succeeded by
  shouts, commands, shrieks, and groans, mingled with the popping of torks, the
  clash of blades, the scurrying feet on deck, and the rumble of mattorks. He
  smiled cunningly as he thought of the splendid prize which his concealed
  warriors would take so easily, and of the very slight expense at which he had
  been to secure the golden-haired beauty who lay at his mercy on the `litter
  before him.</p>

  <p>He crossed the room, and kneeling, touched a rosy cheek. Then he drew back
  his hand with a sharp exclamation of surprise. The face was as hard and cold
  as if it had been hewn from marble.</p>

  <p>A heavy hand fell on his shoulder and closed with a grip that made him
  wince. He was jerked to his feet, and spun around to face a tall, handsome
  stranger, who wore the scarlet of royalty and the insignia of the imperial
  house of Reabon.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;who are you?" he stammered, his trembling voice barely audible
  above the din of battle outside.</p>

  <p>"I am Grandon of Terra, Torrogo of Reabon, and husband of her whom you
  would have wronged&mdash;whose graven image you just now profaned by the
  touch of your filthy hand."</p>

  <p>Behind Grandon, the ornate chest under which the four Huitsenni had
  staggered stood with the lid thrown back, empty. Zanaloth's gaze roved from
  this to the door, as he realized the manner in which Grandon had gained
  access to his cabin. He leaped for the door, but found it locked. Grandon
  reached in his belt-pouch and held up the key.</p>

  <p>"Wha-what do you want?" asked Zanaloth.</p>

  <p>"I have come for your head," replied the Earthman, whipping out his
  scarbo. "On guard, if you have the manhood left to defend it."</p>

  <p>With trembling fingers, Zanaloth drew his own scarbo. In his youth he had
  been accounted an excellent scarboman. But that day was long past. Years of
  dissipation and luxurious living had made him short of breath and flabby of
  muscle. And he knew that there were few, if any, of the most expert duelists
  on Zorovia who could meet Grandon of Terra, scarbo in hand, and live to boast
  of it. Only a trick, a sudden, unexpected move, might save him. He came on
  guard, but before the blades had touched, lowered his point.</p>

  <p>"You may choose between&mdash;" Grandon began. But just then Zanaloth
  raised his weapon and lunged at his opponent's unprotected body. Grandon had
  no time to parry this vicious and cowardly thrust. Barely in time to avert
  disaster, he hurled himself to one side, so that the point only grazed him.
  Zanaloth automatically recovered his stance as Grandon now attacked. For a
  moment, it seemed to the Mernerumite that the blade of his opponent had
  wrapped itself around his own. Then his weapon was twisted from his grasp,
  and flew through the air alight in a corner of the cabin. Zanaloth started
  back, his eyes wide with terror, as the point of the Earthman plunged
  straight for his breast. But Grandon stopped the thrust, and contented
  himself with merely touching his antagonist.</p>

  <p>The din of battle had increased outside, but neither man heeded it.</p>

  <p>"I suggest that you pick up your scarbo," said Grandon, "and that
  hereafter you keep a tighter grip on it."</p>

  <p>Furtively watching his generous opponent, Zanaloth slunk to the corner and
  recovered his weapon. He knew that he could not hope to win this fight, that
  death had him marked for its own. Great beads of sweat standing out on his
  forehead betrayed the fear that gripped his craven heart.</p>

  <p>At his left side, as at Grandon's, there hung a jeweled, gold-plated tork.
  Suddenly he lowered his left hand, gripped the weapon, and was about to press
  the firing-button when a projectile struck his wrist, numbing it, and
  paralyzing his fingers. With incredible swiftness, Grandon had again
  forestalled him.</p>

  <p>Seeing that he had rendered the Mernerumite's tork hand useless, Grandon
  lowered his own weapon. "Since you can no longer fight with the tork," he
  said, politely, "perhaps we had best resume with the scarbo." He advanced,
  and once more their blades met. "I advise you," continued Grandon,
  mechanically cutting, thrusting, and parrying, "to guard well your head, as I
  have promised it to the Rogo of Huitsen. A little gift to recompense him for
  the loss of much gold and many slaves. But then the head of a Torrogo is a
  rare and truly royal gift, even if its intrinsic worth is trifling."</p>

  <p>Zanaloth said nothing. He was fighting with all his strength, yet the
  Earthman was only playing with him. Suddenly Grandon's blade flashed in a
  swift moulinet, touched the Mernerumite's neck, and was withdrawn, without so
  much as drawing blood. But to Grandon's surprise, his antagonist dropped his
  weapon and sank to the floor, limp, and apparently lifeless.</p>

  <p>For some time the Earthman stood there, waiting, suspecting a trick. But
  as his opponent continued motionless, he bent and felt a flabby wrist, then
  held his hand over the heart. There was no pulse. Zanaloth of Mernerum was
  dead, not slain by the scarbo, but by a weapon that is often more deadly,
  that always tortures before it kills&mdash;fear.</p>

  <p>Grandon rose to his feet and sheathed his bloodless blade. Then, taking
  the key from his belt pouch, he opened the cabin door and stepped out on
  deck. San Thoy was waiting there to greet him. The fighting had ceased, and
  the Huitsenni worked side by side with his own Fighting Traveks who had been
  concealed in the hold of their ship. They were tossing the corpses of the
  slain Mernerumites overboard, tending the wounded, and guarding the
  prisoners.</p>

  <p>A large aerial battleship dropped beside them. Grappling-irons were cast
  aboard, and an aluminum stairway was lowered. Zinlo stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"The battle fleet of Mernerum has surrendered," he said. "Coming
  aboard?"</p>

  <p>"Immediately," replied Grandon. With one foot on the stairway, he turned
  to San Thoy. "Good-bye, my friend," he said. "Come and visit me in Reabon.
  Oh, by the way! You will find the gift I promised Han Lay on the floor of
  Zanaloth's cabin. Present it to him with my compliments."</p>

  <p>San Thoy bowed low, and grinned toothlessly, as Grandon mounted the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>The next day, Grandon sat at the crystal-topped table in the drawing-room
  of his private apartments in the imperial palace of Reabon.</p>

  <p>Bonal, his torrango, or prime minister, appeared in the doorway and made
  obeisance. "The messenger has arrived from Mernerum, Your Majesty," he
  announced.</p>

  <p>"I'll receive him here," replied Grandon. "And by the way, Bonal, ask
  Zinlo of Olba to come in now. I want him to be present at the interview."</p>

  <p>A few moments later, Bonal announced: "His Imperial Majesty, Zinlo of
  Olba, and Mojak Sed of the staff of Orthad, Supreme Romojak of Reabon."</p>

  <p>Zinlo entered, followed by a young Reabonian officer. The Torroga of Olba
  took a seat at the table, and the democratic Grandon invited the young
  officer also to be seated, knowing it would not offend his equally democratic
  guest.</p>

  <p>"You bring a message from Orthad?" Grandon asked.</p>

  <p>"I do, Majesty. He bids me inform you that we took Mernerum with ease. The
  people were sick of the tyrannous Zanaloth, and most of them actually
  welcomed us. We were delayed only by the difficulties which arise in moving
  so large an army. The fighting was but desultory, and there were few
  casualties."</p>

  <p>"What was the attitude of the nobles and officials?"</p>

  <p>"They begged that Mernerum be annexed to Reabon, or if this should not
  comport with Your Majesty's wishes, that you name a competent Torrogo to rule
  them. So as soon as Kantar the Gunner arrived in the Olban airship, His
  Excellency named him Torrogo, in accordance with Your Majesty's commands. He
  was later acclaimed by the nobles, warriors, and people without a dissenting
  voice.</p>

  <p>"What of the other ceremony?"</p>

  <p>"It has been performed, Majesty. And Her Majesty invites all to attend the
  feast which will be held this evening."</p>

  <p>"Did you bring with you a messenger from the new Torroga?"</p>

  <p>"I did, Your Majesty. He awaits your permission to present his missive to
  Ad of Tyrhana."</p>

  <p>"Good. You may go now. And send this messenger to me."</p>

  <p>The mojak arose, and making the customary obeisance, withdrew.</p>

  <p>"Thus far," Grandon told Zinlo, "our plot has worked out. It remains to be
  seen how Ad of Tyrhana will take the news." He called a guard. "Have Bonal
  usher in Their Majesties of Tyrhana and Adonijar," he commanded.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you how Ad will take it," said Zinlo. "He'll take it as a
  marmelot takes a slap on the nose. But it was the only thing to do."</p>

  <p>A moment later, Ad and Aardvan were ushered in by Bonal. A slave brought
  kova, and the four Torrogos were chatting merrily over their bowls when Bonal
  announced: "A messenger from Her Imperial Majesty for the Torrogo of
  Tyrhana."</p>

  <p>"What's this?" exclaimed Ad. "I didn't know Zanaloth left a widow. And why
  should she send a messenger to me?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps an interview with the messenger will explain," rumbled the deep
  voice of Aardvan.</p>

  <p>"True. Show him in, Bonal."</p>

  <p>The messenger, who wore the uniform of a mojak of the Imperial Guards of
  Mernerum, made obeisance to all four of the rulers. His puzzled look showed
  that he did not know which one to address.</p>

  <p>"I am the Torrogo of Tyrhana," said Ad. "I believe your message is for
  me."</p>

  <p>"It is, Your Majesty." The mojak took a small scroll from his belt pouch
  and handed it to Ad. "From Her Imperial Majesty, the Torroga of Mernerum," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Ad broke the seal and unrolled the missive. First he looked puzzled, then
  astounded, then fiercely angry. His face purpled and his brow contracted.
  "Blood of Thorth!" he exploded. "Narine has eloped with that young upstart of
  a gunner, and married him!"</p>

  <p>"She could have done worse," soothed Grandon. "The gunner is now Torrogo
  of Mernerum."</p>

  <p>"The little she-marmelot! The traitor! The ungrateful child! I'll disown
  her! I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut," said Aardvan. "I think she has made a splendid match."</p>

  <p>"But what of Gadrimel? What of our pact that my daughter and your son
  should wed?"</p>

  <p>"I don't like to mention this," replied Aardvan, "but Gadrimel picked up a
  slave-girl in Huitsen and brought her here with him. Zena, I believe he
  called her, an ex-concubine of Yin Yin's. I told him to get rid of her, and
  last night they both disappeared. Later, I learned that they had gone for a
  cruise in one of my ships."</p>

  <p>"Um," grunted Ad, non-committally.</p>

  <p>"So you see," continued Aardvan, "their marriage would have been
  impossible, anyway. Besides, we need no marriage to comment the firm
  friendship between us. And think, you will now have as an additional ally the
  wealthy and powerful Torrogo of Mernerum, your son-in-law."</p>

  <p>"That's right, Your Majesty," said Zinlo. "Forgive the child, and let's
  pile into one of my ships and attend the wedding feast tonight, all of
  us."</p>

  <p>"What! You, too? This has all the earmarks of a conspiracy," said Ad.</p>

  <p>Grandon filled the kova bowls all around, then took up his own, and said:
  "My friends, let us drink to the health and happiness of the charming young
  bride and the lucky bridegroom."</p>

  <p>Zinlo and Aardvan drained their bowls.</p>

  <p>Ad hesitated for a moment, then caught up his own bowl and emptied it with
  apparent gusto. "Our work is done," he said. "The power of the pirates is
  broken, and the port of peril is no more. Let us on to the wedding
  feast."</p>
