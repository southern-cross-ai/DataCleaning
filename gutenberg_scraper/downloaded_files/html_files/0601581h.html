FROM seven o'clock in the evening until half past, that is to say
for the half-hour preceding dinner, the Grand Hall of the Hotel
Occidental, throughout the season, is practically a lounge, and
is crowded with the most fashionable folk wintering in Cairo. The
evening I am anxious to describe was certainly no exception to
the rule. At the foot of the fine marble staircase&mdash;the
pride of its owner&mdash;a well-known member of the French
Ministry was chatting with an English Duchess whose pretty, but
somewhat delicate, daughter was flirting mildly with one of the
Sirdar's Bimbashis, on leave from the Soudan. On the right-hand
lounge of the Hall an Italian Countess, whose antecedents were as
doubtful as her diamonds, was apparently listening to a story a
handsome Greek attaché was telling her; in reality, however, she
was endeavouring to catch scraps of a conversation being carried
on, a few feet away, between a witty Russian and an equally
clever daughter of the United States. Almost every nationality
was represented there, but unfortunately for our prestige, the
majority were English. The scene was a brilliant one, and the
sprinkling of military and diplomatic uniforms (there was a
Reception at the Khedivial Palace later) lent an additional touch
of colour to the picture. Taken altogether, and regarded from a
political point of view, the gathering had a significance of its
own.</p>

<p>At the end of the Hall, near the large glass doors, a
handsome, elderly lady, with grey hair, was conversing with one
of the leading English doctors of the place&mdash;a grey-haired,
clever-looking man, who possessed the happy faculty of being able
to impress everyone with whom he talked with the idea that he
infinitely preferred his or her society to that of any other
member of the world's population. They were discussing the
question of the most suitable clothing for a Nile voyage, and as
the lady's daughter, who was seated next her, had been conversant
with her mother's ideas on the subject ever since their first
visit to Egypt (as indeed had been the Doctor), she preferred to
lie back on the divan and watch the people about her. She had
large, dark, contemplative eyes. Like her mother she took life
seriously, but in a somewhat different fashion.</p>

<p>One who has been bracketed third in the Mathematical Tripos
can scarcely be expected to bestow very much thought on the
comparative merits of Jger, as opposed to dresses of the Common
or Garden flannel. From this, however, it must not be inferred
that she was in any way a blue stocking, that is, of course, in
the vulgar acceptation of the word. She was thorough in all she
undertook, and for the reason that mathematics interested her
very much the same way that Wagner, chess, and, shall we say,
croquet, interest other people, she made it her hobby, and it
must be confessed she certainly succeeded in it. At other times
she rode, drove, played tennis and hockey, and looked upon her
world with calm, observant eyes that were more disposed to find
good than evil in it. Contradictions that we are, even to
ourselves, it was only those who knew her intimately, and they
were few and far between, who realised that, under that
apparently sober, matter-of-fact personality, there existed a
strong leaning towards the mysterious, or, more properly
speaking, the occult. Possibly she herself would have been the
first to deny this&mdash;but that I am right in my surmise this
story will surely be sufficient proof.</p>

<p>Mrs Westmoreland and her daughter had left their comfortable
Yorkshire home in September, and, after a little dawdling on the
Continent, had reached Cairo in November&mdash;the best month to
arrive, in my opinion, for then the rush has not set in, the
hotel servants have not had sufficient time to become weary of
their duties, and what is better still, all the best rooms have
not been bespoken. It was now the middle of December, and the
fashionable caravanserai, upon which they had for many years
bestowed their patronage, was crowded from roof to cellar. Every
day people were being turned away, and the manager's continual
lament was that he had not another hundred rooms wherein to place
more guests. He was a Swiss, and for that reason regarded
hotel-keeping in the light of a profession.</p>

<p>On this particular evening Mrs Westmoreland and her daughter
Cecilia had arranged to dine with Dr Forsyth&mdash;that is to
say, they were to eat their meal at his table in order that they
might meet a man of whom they had heard much, but whose
acquaintance they had not as yet made.</p>

<p>The individual in question was a certain Professor
Constanides&mdash;reputed one of the most advanced Egyptologists,
and the author of several well-known works. Mrs Westmoreland was
not of an exacting nature, and so long as she dined in agreeable
company did not trouble herself very much whether it was with an
English earl or a distinguished foreign savant.</p>

<p>'It really does not matter, my dear,' she was wont to observe
to her daughter. 'So long as the cooking is good and the wine
above reproach, there is absolutely nothing to choose between
them. A Prime Minister and a country vicar are, after all, only
men. Feed them well and they'll lie down and purr like tame cats.
They don't want conversation.' From this it will be seen that Mrs
Westmoreland was well acquainted with her world. Whether Miss
Cecilia shared her opinions is another matter. At any rate, she
had been looking forward for nearly a fortnight to meeting
Constanides, who was popularly supposed to possess an
extraordinary intuitive knowledge&mdash;instinct, perhaps, it
should be called&mdash;concerning the localities of tombs of th
Pharaohs of the Eleventh, Twelfth and Thirteenth Dynasties.</p>

<p>'I am afraid Constanides is going to be late,' said the
Doctor, who had consulted his watch more than once. 'I hope, in
that case, as his friend and your host, you will permit me to
offer you my apologies.'</p>

<p>The Doctor at no time objected to the sound of his own voice,
and on this occasion he was even less inclined to do so. Mrs
Westmoreland was a widow with an ample income, and Cecilia, he
felt sure, would marry ere long.</p>

<p>'He has still three minutes in which to put in an appearance,'
observed that young lady, quietly.</p>

<p>And then she added in the same tone, 'Perhaps we ought to be
thankful if he comes at all.'</p>

<p>Both Mrs Westmoreland and her friend the Doctor regarded her
with mildly reproachful eyes.</p>

<p>The former could not understand anyone refusing a dinner such
as she felt sure the Doctor had arranged for them; while the
latter found it impossible to imagine a man who would dare to
disappoint the famous Dr Forsyth, who, having failed in Harley
Street, was nevertheless coining a fortune in the land of the
Pharaohs.</p>

<p>'My good friend Constanides will not disappoint us, I feel
sure,' he said, consulting his watch for the fourth time.
'Possibly I am a little fast, at any rate I have never known him
to be unpunctual. A remarkable&mdash;a very remarkable man is
Constanides. I cannot remember ever to have met another like him.
And such a scholar!'</p>

<p>Having thus bestowed his approval upon him the worthy Doctor
pulled down his cuffs, straightened his tie, adjusted his
pince-nez in his best professional manner, and looked round the
hall as if searching for someone bold enough to contradict the
assertion he had just made.</p>

<p>'You have, of course, read his Mythological Egypt,' observed
Miss Cecilia, demurely, speaking as if the matter were beyond
doubt.</p>

<p>The Doctor looked a little confused.</p>

<p>'Ahem! Well, let me see,' he stammered, trying to find a way
out of the difficulty. 'Well, to tell the truth, my dear young
lady, I'm not quite sure that I have studied that particular
work. As a matter of fact, you see, I have so little leisure at
my disposal for any reading that is not intimately connected with
my profession. That, of course, must necessarily come before
everything else.'</p>

<p>Miss Cecilia's mouth twitched as if she were endeavouring to
keep back a smile. At the same moment the glass doors of the
vestibule opened and a man entered. So remarkable was he that
everyone turned to look at him&mdash;a fact which did not appear
to disconcert him in the least.</p>

<p>He was tall, well shaped, and carried himself with the air of
one accustomed to command. His face was oval, his eyes large and
set somewhat wide apart. It was only when they were directed
fairly at one that one became aware of the power they possessed.
The cheek bones were a trifle high, and the forehead possibly
retreated towards the jet-black hair more than is customary in
Greeks. He wore neither beard nor moustache, thus enabling one to
see the wide, firm mouth, the compression of the lips which spoke
for the determination of their possessor. Those who had an eye
for such things noted the fact that he was faultlessly dressed,
while Miss Cecilia, who had the precious gift of observation
largely developed, noted that, with the exception of a single
ring and a magnificent pearl stud, the latter strangely set, he
wore no jewellery of any sort. He looked about him for Dr
Forsyth, and, when he had located him, hastened forward. 'My dear
friend,' he said in English, which he spoke with scarcely a trace
of foreign accent, 'I must crave your pardon a thousand times if
I have kept you waiting.' 'On the contrary,' replied the Doctor,
effusively, 'you are punctuality itself. Permit me to have the
pleasure&mdash;the very great pleasure&mdash;of introducing you
to my friends, Mrs Westmoreland and her daughter, Miss Cecilia,
of whom you have often heard me speak.' Professor Constanides
bowed and expressed the pleasure he experienced in making their
acquaintance. Though she could not have told you why, Miss
Cecilia found herself undergoing very much the same sensation as
she had done when she had passed up the Throne Room at her
presentation. A moment later the gong sounded, and, with much
rustling of skirts and fluttering of fans, a general movement was
made towards the dining-room.</p>

<p>As host, Dr Forsyth gave his arm to Mrs Westmoreland,
Constanides following with Miss Cecilia. The latter was conscious
of a vague feeling of irritation; she admired the man and his
work, but she wished his name had been anything rather than what
it was. (It should be here remarked that the last Constanides she
had encountered had swindled her abominably in the matter of a
turquoise brooch, and in consequence the name had been an offence
to her ever since.) Dr Forsyth's table was situated at the
further end, in the window, and from it a good view of the room
could be obtained. The scene was an animated one, and one of the
party, at least, I fancy, will never forget it&mdash;try how she
may.</p>

<p>During the first two or three courses the conversation was
practically limited to Cecilia and Constanides; the Doctor and
Mrs Westmoreland being too busy to waste time on idle
chatter.</p>

<p>Later, they became more amenable to the discipline of the
table&mdash;or, in other words, they found time to pay attention
to their neighbours.</p>

<p>Since then I have often wondered with what feelings Cecilia
looks back upon that evening. In order, perhaps, to punish me for
my curiosity, she has admitted to me since that she had never
known, up to that time, what it was to converse with a really
clever man. I submitted to the humiliation for the reason that we
are, if not lovers, at least old friends, and, after all, Mrs
Westmoreland's cook is one in a thousand.</p>

<p>From that evening forward, scarcely a day passed in which
Constanides did not enjoy some portion of Miss Westmoreland's
society. They met at the polo ground, drove in the Gezireh,
shopped in the Muski, or listened to the band, over afternoon
tea, on the balcony of Shepheard's Hotel. Constanides was always
unobtrusive, always picturesque and invariably interesting. What
was more to the point, he never failed to command attention
whenever or wherever he might appear. In the Native Quarter he
was apparently better known than in the European. Cecilia noticed
that there he was treated with a deference such as one would only
expect to be shown to a king. She marvelled, but said nothing.
Personally, I can only wonder that her mother did not caution her
before it was too late. Surely she must have seen how dangerous
the intimacy was likely to become. It was old Colonel Bettenham
who sounded the first note of warning. In some fashion or another
he was connected with the Westmorelands, and therefore had more
or less right to speak his mind.</p>

<p>'Who the man is, I am not in a position to say,' he remarked
to the mother; 'but if I were in your place I should be very
careful. Cairo at this time of year is full of adventurers.'</p>

<p>'But, my dear Colonel,' answered Mrs Westmoreland, 'you surely
do not mean to insinuate that the Professor is an adventurer. He
was introduced to us by Dr Forsyth, and he has written so many
clever books.'</p>

<p>'Books, my dear madam, are not everything,' the other replied
judicially, and with that fine impartiality which marks a man who
does not read. 'As a matter of fact I am bound to confess that
Phipps&mdash;one of my captains&mdash;wrote a novel some years
ago, but only one. The mess pointed out to him that it wasn't
good form, don't you know, so he never tried the experiment
again. But as for this man, Constanides, as they call him, I
should certainly be more than careful.' I have been told since
that this conversation worried poor Mrs Westmoreland more than
she cared to admit, even to herself. To a very large extent she,
like her daughter, had fallen under the spell of the Professor's
fascination. Had she been asked, point blank, she would doubtless
have declared that she preferred the Greek to the
Englishman&mdash;though, of course, it would have seemed flat
heresy to say so. And yet&mdash;well, doubtless you can
understand what I mean without my explaining further. I am
inclined to believe that I was the first to notice that there was
serious trouble brewing. I could see a strained look in the
girl's eyes for which I found if difficult to account. Then the
truth dawned upon me, and I am ashamed to say that I began to
watch her systematically. We have few secrets from each other
now, and she has told me a good deal of what happened during that
extraordinary time&mdash;for extraordinary it certainly was.
Perhaps none of us realised what a unique drama we were
watching&mdash;one of the strangest, I am tempted to believe,
that this world of ours has ever seen. Christmas was just past
and the New Year was fairly under way when the beginning of the
end came. I think by that time even Mrs Westmoreland had arrived
at some sort of knowledge of the case. But it was then too late
to interfere. I am as sure that Cecilia was not in love with
Constanides as I am of anything. She was merely fascinated by
him, and to a degree that, happily for the peace of the world, is
as rare as the reason for it is perplexing. To be precise, it was
on Tuesday, January the 3rd, that the crisis came. On the evening
of that day, accompanied by her daughter and escorted by Dr
Forsyth, Mrs Westmoreland attended a reception at the palace of a
certain Pasha, whose name I am obviously compelled to keep to
myself. For the purposes of my story it is sufficient, however,
that he is a man who prides himself on being up-to-date in most
things, and for that and other reasons invitations to his
receptions are eagerly sought after. In his drawing-room one may
meet some of the most distinguished men in Europe, and on
occasion it is even possible to obtain an insight into certain
political intrigues that, to put it mildly, afford one an
opportunity of reflecting on the instability of mundane affairs
and of politics in particular.</p>

<p>The evening was well advanced before Constanides made his
appearance. When he did, it was observed that he was more than
usually quiet. Later, Cecilia permitted him to conduct her into
the balcony, whence, since it was a perfect moonlight night, a
fine view of the Nile could be obtained. Exactly what he said to
her I have never been able to discover; I have, however, her
mother's assurance that she was visibly agitated when she
rejoined her. As a matter of fact, they returned to the hotel
almost immediately, when Cecilia, pleading weariness, retired to
her room.</p>

<p>And now this is the part of the story you will find as
difficult to believe as I did. Yet I have indisputable evidence
that it is true. It was nearly midnight and the large hotel was
enjoying the only quiet it knows in the twenty-four hours. I have
just said that Cecilia had retired, but in making that assertion
I am not telling the exact truth, for though she had bade mother
'Goodnight' and had gone to her room, it was not to rest.
Regardless of the cold night air she had thrown open the window,
and was standing looking out into the moonlit street. Of what she
was thinking I do not know, nor can she remember. For my own
part, however, I incline to the belief that she was in a
semi-hypnotic condition and that for the time being her mind
was a blank.</p>

<p>From this point I will let Cecilia tell the story herself.</p>

<p>How long I stood at the window I cannot say; it may have been
only five minutes, it might have been an hour. Then, suddenly, an
extraordinary thing happened. I knew that it was imprudent, I was
aware that it was even wrong, but an overwhelming craving to go
out seized me. I felt as if the house were stifling me and that
if I did not get out into the cool night air, and within a few
minutes, I should die. Stranger still, I felt no desire to battle
with the temptation. It was as if a will infinitely stronger than
my own was dominating me and that I was powerless to resist.
Scarcely conscious of what I was doing I changed my dress, and
then, throwing on a cloak, switched off the electric light and
stepped out into the corridor. The white-robed Arab servants were
lying about on the floor as is their custom; they were all
asleep. On the thick carpet of the great staircase my steps made
no sound. The hall was in semi-darkness and the watchman must
have been absent on his rounds, for there was no one there to spy
upon me. Passing through the vestibule I turned the key of the
front door. Still success attended me, for the lock shot back
with scarcely a sound and I found myself in the street. Even then
I had no thought of the folly of this escapade. I was merely
conscious of the mysterious power that was dragging me on.
Without hesitation I turned to the right and hastened along the
pavement, faster I think than I had ever walked in my life. Under
the trees it was comparatively dark, but out in the roadway it
was well-nigh as bright as day. Once a carriage passed me and I
could hear its occupants, who were French, conversing
merrily&mdash;otherwise I seemed to have the city to myself.
Later I heard a muezzin chanting his call to prayer from the
minaret of some mosque in the neighbourhood, the cry being taken
up and repeated from other mosques. Then at the corner of a
street I stopped as if in obedience to a command. I can recall
the fact that I was trembling, but for what reason I could not
tell. I say this to show that while I was incapable of returning
to the hotel, or of exercising my normal will power, I still
possessed the faculty of observation.</p>

<p>I had scarcely reached the corner referred to, which, as a
matter of fact, I believe I should recognise if I saw it again,
when the door of a house opened and a man emerged. It was
Professor Constanides, but his appearance at such a place and at
such an hour, like everything else that happened that night, did
not strike me as being in any way extraordinary.</p>

<p>'You have obeyed me,' he said by way of greeting. 'That is
well. Now let us be going&mdash;the hour is late.'</p>

<p>As he said it there came the rattle of wheels and a carriage
drove swiftly round the corner and pulled up before us. My
companion helped me into it and took his place beside me. Even
then, unheard-of as my action was, I had no thought of
resisting.</p>

<p>'What does it mean?' I asked. 'Oh, tell me what it means? Why
am I here?'</p>

<p>'You will soon know,' was his reply, and his voice took a tone
I had never noticed in it before. We had driven some considerable
distance, in fact, I believe we had crossed the river, before
either of us spoke again.</p>

<p>'Think,' said my companion, 'and tell me whether you can
remember ever having driven with me before?'</p>

<p>'We have driven together many times lately,' I replied.
'Yesterday to the polo, and the day before to the Pyramids.'</p>

<p>'Think again,' he said, and as he did so he placed his hand on
mine. It was as cold as ice.</p>

<p>However, I only shook my head.</p>

<p>'I cannot remember,' I answered, and yet I seemed to be dimly
conscious of something that was too intangible to be a
recollection. He uttered a little sigh and once more we were
silent. The horses must have been good ones for they whirled us
along at a fast pace. I did not take much interest in the route
we followed, but at last something attracted my attention and I
knew that we were on the road to Gizeh. A few moments later the
famous Museum, once the palace of the ex-Khedive Ismail, came
into view. Almost immediately the carriage pulled up in the
shadow of the Lebbek trees and my companion begged me to alight.
I did so, whereupon he said something, in what I can only suppose
was Arabic, to his coachman, who whipped up his horses and drove
swiftly away.</p>

<p>'Come,' he said, in the same tone of command as before, and
then led the way towards the gates of the old palace. Dominated
as my will was by his I could still notice how beautiful the
building looked in the moonlight. In the daytime it presents a
faded and unsubstantial appearance, but now, with its Oriental
tracery, it was almost fairylike. The Professor halted at the
gates and unlocked them. How he had admitted us, I cannot say. It
suffices that, almost before I was aware of it, we had passed
through the garden and were ascending the steps to the main
entrance. The doors behind us, we entered the first room. It is
only another point in this extraordinary adventure when I declare
that even now I was not afraid; and yet to find oneself in such a
place and at such an hour at any other time would probably have
driven me beside myself with terror.</p>

<p>The moonlight streamed in upon us, revealing the ancient
monuments and the other indescribable memorials of those long-dead
ages. Once more my conductor uttered his command and we went
on through the second room, passed the Skekh-El-Beled and the
Seated Scribe. Room after room we traversed, and to do so it
seemed to me that we ascended stairs innumerable. At last we came
to one in which Constanides paused. It contained numerous mummy
cases and was lighted by a skylight through which the rays of the
moon streamed in. We were standing before one which I remembered
to have remarked on the occasion of our last visit. I could
distinguish the paintings upon it distinctly. Professor
Constanides, with the deftness which showed his familiarity with
the work, removed the lid and revealed to me the swathed-up
figure within. The face was uncovered and was strangely
well-preserved. I gazed down on it, and as I did so a sensation
that I had never known before passed over me. My body seemed to
be shrinking, my blood to be turning to ice.</p>

<p>For the first time I endeavoured to exert myself, to tear
myself from the bonds that were holding me. But it was in vain. I
was sinking&mdash;sinking&mdash;sinking&mdash;into I knew not
what. Then the voice of the man who had brought me to the place
sounded in my ears as if he were speaking from a long way off.
After that a great light burst upon me, and it was as if I were
walking in a dream; yet I knew it was too real, too true to life
to be a mere creation of my fancy.</p>

<p>It was night and the heavens were studded with stars. In the
distance a great army was encamped and at intervals the calls of
the sentries reached me. Somehow I seemed to feel no wonderment
at my position. Even my dress caused me no surprise. To my left,
as I looked towards the river, was a large tent, before which
armed men paced continually. I looked about me as if I expected
to see someone, but there was no one.</p>

<p>'It is for the last time,' I told myself. 'Come what may, it
shall be the last time!'</p>

<p>Still I waited, and as I did so I could hear the night wind
sighing through the rushes on the river's bank. From the tent
near me&mdash;for Usirtasen, son of Amenemhait&mdash;was then
fighting against the Libyans and was commanding his army in
person&mdash;came the sound of revelry. The air blew cold from
the desert and I shivered, for I was but thinly clad. Then I hid
myself in the shadow of a great rock that was near at hand.
Presently I caught the sound of a footstep, and there came into
view a tall man, walking carefully, as though he had no desire
that the sentries on guard before the Royal tent should become
aware of his presence in the neighbourhood. As I saw him I moved
from where I was standing to meet him. He was none other than
Sinfihit&mdash;younger son of Amenemhait and brother of
Usirtasen&mdash;who was at that moment conferring with his
generals in the tent.</p>

<p>I can see him now as he came towards me, tall, handsome, and
defiant in his bearing as a man should be. He walked with the
assured step of one who has been a soldier and trained to warlike
exercises from his youth up. For a moment I regretted the news I
had to tell him&mdash;but only for a moment. I could hear the
voice of Usirtasen in the tent, and after that I had no thought
for anyone else.</p>

<p>'Is it thou, Nofrit?' he asked as soon as he saw me.</p>

<p>'It is I!' I replied. 'You are late, Sinfihit. You tarry too
long over the wine cups.'</p>

<p>'You wrong me, Nofrit,' he answered, with all the fierceness
for which he was celebrated. 'I have drunk no wine this night.
Had I not been kept by the Captain of the Guard I should have
been here sooner. Thou art not angry with me, Nofrit?'</p>

<p>'Nay, that were presumption on my part, my lord,' I answered.
'Art thou not the King's son, Sinfihit?'</p>

<p>'And by the Holy Ones I swear that it were better for me if I
were not,' he replied. 'Usirtasen, my brother, takes all and I am
but the jackal that gathers up the scraps wheresoever he may find
them.' He paused for a moment. 'However, all goes well with our
plot. Let me but have time and I will yet be ruler of this land
and of all the Land of Khem beside.' He drew himself up to his
full height and looked towards the sleeping camp. It was well
known that between the brothers there was but little love, and
still less trust.</p>

<p>'Peace, peace,' I whispered, fearing lest his words might be
overheard. 'You must not talk so, my lord. Should you by chance
be heard you know what the punishment would be!'</p>

<p>He laughed a short and bitter laugh. He was well aware that
Usirtasen would show him no mercy. It was not the first time he
had been suspected, and he was playing a desperate game. He came
a step closer to me and took my hand in his. I would have
withdrawn it&mdash;but he gave me no opportunity. Never was a man
more in earnest than he was then.</p>

<p>'Nofrit,' he said, and I could feel his breath upon my cheek,
'what is my answer to be? The time for talking is past; now we
must act. As thou knowest, I prefer deeds to words, and to-morrow
my brother Usirtasen shall learn that I am as powerful as
he.'</p>

<p>Knowing what I knew I could have laughed him to scorn for his
boastful speech. The time, however, was not yet ripe, so I held
my peace. He was plotting against his brother, whom I loved, and
it was his desire that I should help him. That, however, I would
not do. 'Listen,' he said, drawing even closer to me, and
speaking in a voice that showed me plainly how much in earnest he
was, 'thou knowest how much I love thee. Thou knowest that there
is nought I would not do for thee or for thy sake. Be but
faithful to me now and there is nothing thou shalt ask in vain of
me hereafter. All is prepared, and ere the moon is gone I shall
be Pharaoh and reign beside Amenemhait, my father.' 'Are you so
sure that your plans will not miscarry?' I asked, with what was
almost a sneer at his recklessness&mdash;for recklessness it
surely was to think that he could induce an army that had been
admittedly successful to swerve in its allegiance to the general
who had won its battles for it, and to desert in the face of the
enemy. Moreover, I knew that he was wrong in believing that his
father cared more for him than for Usirtasen, who had done so
much for the kingdom, and who was beloved by high and low alike.
But it was not in Sinfihit's nature to look upon the dark side of
things. He had complete confidence in himself and in his power to
bring his conspiracy against his father and brother to a
successful issue. He revealed to me his plans, and, bold though
they were, I could see that it was impossible that they could
succeed. And in the event of his failing, what mercy could he
hope to receive? I knew Usirtasen too well to think that he would
show any. With all the eloquence I could command I implored him
to abandon the attempt, or at least to delay it for a time. He
seized my wrist and pulled me to him, peering fiercely into my
face.</p>

<p>'Art playing me false?' he asked. 'If it is so it were better
that you should drown yourself in yonder river. Betray me and
nothing shall save you&mdash;not even Pharaoh himself.'</p>

<p>That he meant what he said I felt convinced. The man was
desperate; he was staking all he had in the world upon the issue
of his venture. I can say with truth that it was not my fault
that we had been drawn together, and yet on this night of all
others it seemed as if there were nothing left for me but to side
with him or to bring about his downfall.</p>

<p>'Nofrit,' he said, after a short pause, 'is it nothing,
thinkest thou, to be the wife of a Pharaoh? Is it not worth
striving for, particularly when it can be so easily
accomplished?'</p>

<p>I knew, however, that he was deluding himself with false
hopes. What he had in his mind could never come to pass. I was
like dry grass between two fires. All that was required was one
small spark to bring about a conflagration in which I should be
consumed.</p>

<p>'Harken to me, Nofrit,' he continued. 'You have means of
learning Usirtasen's plans. Send me word to-morrow as to what is
in his mind and the rest will be easy. Your reward shall be
greater than you dream of.'</p>

<p>Though I had no intention of doing what he asked, I knew that
in his present humour it would be little short of madness to
thwart him. I therefore temporised with him, and allowed him to
suppose that I would do as he wished, and then, bidding him
good-night, I sped away towards the hut where I was lodged. I
had not been there many minutes when a messenger came to me from
Usirtasen, summoning me to his presence. Though I could not
understand what it meant I hastened to obey.</p>

<p>On arrival there I found him surrounded by the chief officers
of his army. One glance at his face was sufficient to tell me
that he was violently angry with someone, and I had the best of
reasons for believing that that someone was myself. Alas! it was
as I had expected.</p>

<p>Sinfihit's plot had been discovered; he had been followed and
watched, and my meeting with him that evening was known. I
protested my innocence in vain. The evidence was too strong
against me.</p>

<p>'Speak, girl, and tell what thou knowest,' said Usirtasen, in
a voice I had never heard him use before. 'It is the only way by
which thou canst save thyself. Look to it that thy story tallies
with the tales of others!'</p>

<p>I trembled in every limb as I answered the questions he put to
me. It was plain that he no longer trusted me, and that the
favour I had once found in his eyes was gone, never to return.
'It is well,' he said when I had finished my story. 'And now we
will see thy partner&mdash;the man who would have put
me&mdash;the Pharaoh who is to be&mdash;to the sword had I not
been warned in time.'</p>

<p>He made a sign to one of the officers who stood by, whereupon
the latter left the tent, to return a few moments later with
Sinfihit.</p>

<p>'Hail, brother!' said Usirtasen, mockingly, as he leaned back
in his chair and looked at him through half-shut eyes. 'You
tarried but a short time over the wine cup this night. I fear it
pleased thee but little. Forgive me; on another occasion better
shall be found for thee lest thou shouldst deem us lacking in our
hospitality.'</p>

<p>'There were matters that needed my attention and I could not
stay,' Sinfihit replied, looking his brother in the face. 'Thou
wouldst not have me neglect my duties.'</p>

<p>'Nay! nay! Maybe they were matters that concerned our personal
safety?' Usirtasen continued, still with the same gentleness.
'Maybe you heard that there were those in our army who were not
well disposed towards us? Give me their names, my brother, that
due punishment may be meted out to them.'</p>

<p>Before Sinfihit could reply, Usirtasen had sprung to his
feet.</p>

<p>'Dog!' he cried, 'darest thou prate to me of matters of
importance when thou knowest thou hast been plotting against me
and my father's throne. I have doubted thee these many months and
now all is made clear. By the Gods, the Holy Ones, I swear that
thou shalt die for this ere cock-crow.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Sinfihit became aware of my
presence. A little cry escaped him, and his face told me as
plainly as any words could speak that he believed that I had
betrayed him. He was about to speak, probably to denounce me,
when the sound of voices reached us from outside.</p>

<p>Usirtasen bade the guards to ascertain what it meant, and
presently a messenger entered the tent.</p>

<p>He was travel-stained and weary. Advancing towards where
Usirtasen was seated, he knelt before him.</p>

<p>'Hail, Pharaoh,' he said. 'I come to thee from the Palace of
Titoui.'</p>

<p>An anxious expression came over Usirtasen's face as he heard
this. I also detected beads of perspiration on the brow of
Sinfihit. A moment latter it was known to us that Amenemhait was
dead, and, therefore, Usirtasen reigned in his stead. The news
was so sudden, and the consequences so vast, that it was
impossible to realise quite what it meant. I looked across at
Sinfihit and his eyes met mine. He seemed to be making up his
mind about something. Then with lightning speed he sprang upon
me; a dagger gleamed in the air; I felt as if a hot iron had been
thrust into my breast, and after that I remember no more.</p>

<p>As I felt myself falling I seemed to wake from my
dream&mdash;if dream it were&mdash;to find myself standing in the
Museum by the mummy case, and with Professor Constanides by my
side.</p>

<p>'You have seen,' he said. 'You have looked back across the
centuries to that day when, as Nofrit, I believed you had
betrayed me, and killed you. After that I escaped from the camp
and fled into Kaduma. There I died; but it was decreed that my
soul should never know peace till we had met again and you had
forgiven me. I have waited all these years, and see&mdash;we meet
at last.'</p>

<p>Strange to say, even then the situation did not strike me as
being in any way improbable. Yet now, when I see it set down in
black and white, I find myself wondering that I dare to ask
anyone in their sober senses to believe it to be true. Was I in
truth that same Nofrit who, four thousand years before, had been
killed by Sinfihit, son of Amenemhait, because he believed that I
had betrayed him? It seemed incredible, and yet, if it were a
creation of my imagination, what did the dream mean? I fear it is
a riddle of which I shall probably never know the answer. My
failure to reply to his question seemed to cause him pain.</p>

<p>'Nofrit,' he said, and his voice shook with emotion, 'think
what your forgiveness means to me. Without it I am lost both here
and hereafter.'</p>

<p>His voice was low and pleading and his face in the moonlight
was like that of a man who knew the uttermost depths of
despair.</p>

<p>'Forgive&mdash;forgive,' he cried again, holding out his hands
to me. 'If you do not, I must go back to the sufferings which
have been my portion since I did the deed which wrought my
ruin.'</p>

<p>I felt myself trembling like a leaf.</p>

<p>'If it is as you say, though I cannot believe it, I forgive
you freely,' I answered, in a voice that I scarcely recognised as
my own.</p>

<p>For some moments he was silent, then he knelt before me and
took my hand, which he raised to his lips. After that, rising, he
laid his head upon the breast of the mummy before which we were
standing. Looking down at it he addressed it thus:</p>

<p>'Rest, Sinfihit, son of Amenemhait&mdash;for that which was
foretold for thee is now accomplished, and the punishment which
was decreed is at an end. Henceforth thou mayest sleep in
peace.'</p>

<p>After that he replaced the lid of the coffin, and when this
was done he turned to me.</p>

<p>'Let us be going,' he said, and we went together through the
rooms by the way we had come.</p>

<p>Together we left the building and passed through the gardens
out into the road beyond. There we found the carriage waiting for
us, and we took our places in it. Once more the horses sped along
the silent road, carrying us swiftly back to Cairo. During the
drive not a word was spoken by either of us. The only desire I
had left was to get back to the hotel and lay my aching head upon
my pillow. We crossed the bridge and entered the city. What the
time was I had no idea, but I was conscious that the wind blew
chill as if in anticipation of the dawn. At the same corner
whence we had started, the coachman stopped his horses and I
alighted, after which he drove away as if he had received his
orders before-hand.</p>

<p>'Will you permit me to walk with you as far as your hotel?'
said Constanides, with his customary politeness.</p>

<p>I tried to say something in reply, but my voice failed me. I
would much rather have been alone, but as he would not allow this
we set off together. At the corner of the street in which the
hotel is situated we stopped.</p>

<p>'Here we must part,' he said. Then, after a pause, he added,
'And for ever. From this moment I shall never see your face
again.'</p>

<p>'You are leaving Cairo?' was the only thing I could say.</p>

<p>'Yes, I am leaving Cairo,' he replied with peculiar emphasis.
'My errand here is accomplished. You need have no fear that I
shall ever trouble you again.'</p>

<p>'I have no fear,' I answered, though I am afraid it was only a
half truth.</p>

<p>He looked earnestly into my face.</p>

<p>'Nofrit,' he said, 'for, say what you will, you are the Nofrit
I would have made my Queen and have loved beyond all other women,
never again will it be permitted you to look into the past as you
did to-night. Had things been ordained otherwise we might have
done great things together, but the gods willed that it should
not be. Let it rest therefore. And now&mdash;farewell! To-night I
go to the rest for which I have so long been seeking.'</p>

<p>Without another word he turned and left me. Then I went on to
the hotel. How it came about I cannot say, but the door was open
and I passed quickly in. Once more, to my joy, I found the
watchman was absent from the hall. Trembling lest anyone might
see me, I sped up the stairs and along the corridor, where the
servants lay sleeping just as I had left them, and so to my room.
Everything was exactly as I had left it, and there was nothing to
show that my absence had been suspected. Again I went to the
window, and, in a feeling of extraordinary agitation, looked out.
Already there were signs of dawn in the sky. I sat down and tried
to think over all that had happened to me that evening,
endeavouring to convince myself, in the face of indisputable
evidence, that it was not real and that I had only dreamt it. Yet
it would not do! At last, worn out, I retired to rest. As a rule
I sleep soundly; it is scarcely, however, a matter for wonderment
that I did not do so on this occasion.</p>

<p>Hour after hour I tumbled and
tossed&mdash;thinking&mdash;thinking&mdash;thinking. When I rose
and looked into the glass I scarcely recognised myself. Indeed,
my mother commented on my fagged appearance when we met at the
breakfast table.</p>

<p>'My dear child, you look as if you had been up all night,' she
said, and little did she guess, as she nibbled her toast, that
there was a considerable amount of truth in her remark.</p>

<p>Later she went shopping with a lady staying in the hotel,
while I went to my room to lie down.</p>

<p>When we met again at lunch it was easy to see that she had
some news of importance to communicate.</p>

<p>'My dear Cecilia,' she said, 'I have just seen Dr Forsyth, and
he has given me a terrible shock.</p>

<p>I don't want to frighten you, my girl, but have you heard that
Professor Constanides was found dead in bed this morning? It is a
most terrible affair! He must have died during the night!'</p>

<p>I am not going to pretend that I had any reply ready to offer
her at that moment.</p>
