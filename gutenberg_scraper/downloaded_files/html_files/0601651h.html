<p class="first">JOEL BRILL slapped shut the book he had been
scanning, and gave vent to his dissatisfaction in language more
appropriate for the deck of a whaling ship than for the library of
the exclusive Corinthian Club. Buckley, seated in an alcove nearby,
grinned quietly. Buckley looked more like a college professor than
a detective, and perhaps it was less because of a studious nature
than a desire to play the part he looked, that caused him to loaf
around the library of the Corinthian.</p>

<p>"It must be something unusual to drag you out of your lair at
this time of the day," he remarked. "This is the first time I ever
saw you in the evening. I thought you spent your evenings secluded
in your rooms, pouring over musty tomes in the interests of that
museum you're connected with."</p>

<p>"I do, ordinarily." Brill looked as little like a scientist as
Buckley looked like a dick. He was squarely built, with thick
shoulders and the jaw and fists of a prizefighter; low browed, with
a mane of tousled black hair contrasting with his cold blue
eyes.</p>

<p>"You've been shoving your nose into books here since six
o'clock," asserted Buckley.</p>

<p>"I've been trying to get some information for the directors of
the museum," answered Brill. "Look!" He pointed an accusing finger
at the rows of lavishly bound volumes. "Books till it would sicken
a dog&mdash;and not a blasted one can tell me the reason for a
certain ceremonial dance practiced by a certain tribe on the West
African Coast."</p>

<p>"A lot of the members have knocked around a bit," suggested
Buckley. "Why not ask them?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to." Brill took down a phone from its hook.</p>

<p>"There's John Galt&mdash;" began Buckley.</p>

<p>"Too hard to locate. He flits about like a mosquito with the St.
Vitus. I'll try Jim Reynolds." He twirled the dial.</p>

<p>"Thought you'd done some exploring in the tropics yourself,"
remarked Buckley.</p>

<p>"Not worthy of the name. I hung around that God-forsaken Hell
hole of the West African Coast for a few months until I came down
with malaria&mdash;Hello!"</p>

<p>A suave voice, too perfectly accented, came along the wire.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that you, Yut Wuen? I want to speak to Mr.
Reynolds."</p>

<p>Polite surprise tinged the meticulous tone.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Reynolds went out in response to your call an hour
ago, Mr. Brill."</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded Brill. "Went where?"</p>

<p>"Why, surely you remember, Mr. Brill." A faint uneasiness seemed
to edge the Chinaman's voice. "At about nine o'clock you called,
and I answered the phone. You said you wished to speak to Mr.
Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds talked to you, then told me to have his car
brought around to the side entrance. He said that you had requested
him to meet you at the cottage on White Lake shore."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Brill. "This is the first time I've phoned
Reynolds for weeks! You've mistaken somebody else for me."</p>

<p>There was no reply, but a polite stubbornness seemed to flow
over the wire. Brill replaced the phone and turned to Buckley, who
was leaning forward with aroused interest.</p>

<p>"Something fishy here," scowled Brill. "Yut Wuen, Jim's Chinese
servant, said <i>I</i> called, an hour ago, and Jim went out to
meet me. Buckley, you've been here all evening. <i>Did</i> I call
up anybody? I'm so infernally absent-minded&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you didn't," emphatically answered the detective. "I've
been sitting right here close to the phone ever since six o'clock.
Nobody's used it. And you haven't left the library during that
time. I'm so accustomed to spying on people, I do it
unconsciously."</p>

<p>"Well, say," said Brill, uneasily, "suppose you and I drive over
to White Lake. If this is a joke, Jim may be over there waiting for
me to show up."</p>

<p>As the city lights fell behind them, and houses gave way to
clumps of trees and bushes, velvet black in the star-light, Buckley
said: "Do you think Yut Wuen made a mistake?"</p>

<p>"What else could it be?" answered Brill, irritably.</p>

<p>"Somebody might have been playing a joke, as you suggested. Why
should anybody impersonate you to Reynolds?"</p>

<p>"How should I know? But I'm about the only acquaintance he'd
bestir himself for, at this time of night. He's reserved,
suspicious of people. Hasn't many friends. I happen to be one of
the few."</p>

<p>"Something of a traveler, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"There's no corner of the world with which he isn't
familiar."</p>

<p>"How'd he make his money?" Buckley asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>"I've never asked him. But he has plenty of it."</p>

<p>The clumps on each side of the road grew denser, and scattered
pinpoints of light that marked isolated farm houses faded out
behind them. The road tilted gradually as they climbed higher and
higher into the wild hill region which, an hour's drive from the
city, locked the broad crystalline sheet of silver that men called
White Lake. Now ahead of them a glint shivered among the trees, and
topping a wooded crest, they saw the lake spread out below them,
reflecting the stars in myriad flecks of silver. The road meandered
along the curving shore.</p>

<p>"Where's Reynolds' lodge?" inquired Buckley.</p>

<p>Brill pointed. "See that thick clump of shadows, within a few
yards of the water's edge? It's the only cottage on this side of
the lake. The others are three or four miles away. None of them
occupied, this time of the year. There's a car drawn up in front of
the cottage."</p>

<p>"No light in the shack," grunted Buckley, pulling up beside the
long low roadster that stood before the narrow stoop. The building
reared dark and silent before them, blocked against the rippling
silver sheen behind it.</p>

<p>"Hey, Jim!" called Brill. "Jim Reynolds!"</p>

<p>No answer. Only a vague echo shuddering down from the blackly
wooded hills.</p>

<p>"Devil of a place at night," muttered Buckley, peering at the
dense shadows that bordered the lake. "We might be a thousand miles
from civilization."</p>

<p>Brill slid out of the car. "Reynolds must be here&mdash;unless
he's gone for a midnight boat ride."</p>

<p>Their steps echoed loudly and emptily on the tiny stoop. Brill
banged the door and shouted. Somewhere back in the woods a night
bird lifted a drowsy note. There was no other answer.</p>

<p>Buckley shook the door. It was locked from the inside.</p>

<p>"I don't like this," he growled. "Car in front of the
cottage&mdash;door locked on the inside&mdash;nobody answering it.
I believe I'll break the door in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No need." Brill fumbled in his pocket. "I'll use my key."</p>

<p>"How comes it you have a key to Reynolds' shack?" demanded
Buckley.</p>

<p>"It was his own idea. I spent some time with him up here last
summer, and he insisted on giving me a key, so I could use the
cottage any time I wanted to. Turn on your flash, will you? I can't
find the lock. All right, I've got it. Hey, Jim! Are you here?"</p>

<p>Buckley's flash played over chairs and card tables, coming to
rest on a closed door in the opposite wall. They entered and
Buckley heard Brill fumbling about with an arm elevated. A faint
click followed and Brill swore.</p>

<p>"The juice is off. There's a line running out from town to
supply the cottage owners with electricity, but it must be dead. As
long as we're in here, let's go through the house. Reynolds may be
sleeping somewhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off with a sharp intake of breath. Buckley had opened
the door that led to the bedroom. His flash played on the
interior&mdash;on a broken chair, a smashed table&mdash;a crumpled
shape that lay in the midst of a dark widening pool.</p>

<p>"Good God, it's Reynolds!"</p>

<p>Buckley's gun glinted in his hand as he played the flash around
the room, sifting the shadows for lurking shapes of menace; it
rested on a bolted rear door; rested longer on an open window, the
screen of which hung in tatters.</p>

<p>"We've got to have more light," he grunted. "Where's the switch?
Maybe a fuse has blown."</p>

<p>"Outside, near that window." Stumblingly Brill led the way out
of the house and around to the window. Buckley flashed his light,
grunted.</p>

<p>"The switch has been pulled!" He pushed it back in place, and
light flooded the cottage. The light streaming through the windows
seemed to emphasize the blackness of the whispering woods around
them. Buckley glared into the shadows, seemed to shiver. Brill had
not spoken; he shook as with ague.</p>

<p>Back in the house they bent over the man who lay in the middle
of the red- splashed floor.</p>

<p>Jim Reynolds had been a stocky, strongly built man of middle
age. His skin was brown and weather-beaten, hinting of tropic suns.
His features were masked with blood; his head lolled back,
disclosing an awful wound beneath his chin.</p>

<p>"His throat's been cut!" stammered Brill. Buckley shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Not cut&mdash;torn. Good God, it looks like a big cat had
ripped him."</p>

<p>The whole throat had literally been torn out; muscles, arteries,
windpipe and the great jugular vein had been severed; the bones of
the vertebrae showed beneath.</p>

<p>"He's so bloody I wouldn't have recognized him," muttered the
detective. "How did you know him so quickly? The instant we saw
him, you cried out that it was Reynolds."</p>

<p>"I recognized his garments and his build," answered the other.
"But what in God's name killed him?"</p>

<p>Buckley straightened and looked about. "Where does that door
lead to?"</p>

<p>"To the kitchen; but it's locked on this side."</p>

<p>"And the outer door of the front room was locked on the inside,"
muttered Buckley. "Doesn't take a genius to see how the murderer
got in&mdash;and he&mdash;or <i>it</i>&mdash;went out the same
way."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, <i>it</i>?"</p>

<p>"Does that look like the work of a human being?" Buckley pointed
to the dead man's mangled throat. Brill winced.</p>

<p>"I've seen black boys mauled by the big cats on the West
Coast&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And whatever tore Reynolds' gullet out, tore that window
screen. It wasn't cut with a knife."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose a panther from the hills&mdash;" began
Brill.</p>

<p>"A panther smart enough to throw the electric switch before he
slid through the window?" scoffed Buckley.</p>

<p>"We don't know the killer threw the switch."</p>

<p>"Was Reynolds fooling around in the dark, then? No; when I
pushed the switch back in place, the light came on in here. That
shows it had been on; the button hadn't been pushed back. Whoever
killed Reynolds had a reason for wanting to work in the dark. Maybe
this was it!" The detective indicated, with a square-shod toe, a
stubby chunk of blue steel that lay not far from the body.</p>

<p>"From what I hear about Reynolds, he was quick enough on the
trigger." Buckley slipped on a glove, carefully lifted the
revolver, and scanned the chamber. His gaze, roving about the room
again, halted at the window, and with a single long stride, he
reached it and bent over the sill.</p>

<p>"One shot's been fired from this gun. The bullet's in the window
sill. At least, one bullet is, and it's logical to suppose it's the
one from the empty chamber of Reynolds' gun. Here's the way I
reconstruct the crime: <i>something</i> sneaked up to the shack,
threw the switch, and came busting through the window. Reynolds
shot once in the dark and missed, and then the killer got in his
work. I'll take this gun to headquarters; don't expect to find any
fingerprints except Reynolds', however. We'll examine the light
switch, too, though maybe my dumb pawing erased any fingerprints
that might have been there. Say, it's a good thing you have an
iron-clad alibi."</p>

<p>Brill started violently. "What the Hell do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, there's the Chinaman to swear you called Reynolds to his
death."</p>

<p>"Why the devil should I do such a thing?" hotly demanded the
scientist.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Buckley, "I know you were in the library of the
club all evening. That's an unshakable alibi&mdash;I suppose."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Brill was tired as he locked the door of his garage and turned
toward the house which rose dark and silent among the trees. He
found himself wishing that his sister, with whom he was staying,
had not left town for the weekend with her husband and children.
Dark empty houses were vaguely repellent to him after the
happenings of the night before.</p>

<p>He sighed wearily as he trudged toward the house, under the
dense shadows of the trees that lined the driveway. It had been a
morbid, and harrying day. Tag ends of thoughts and worries flitted
through his mind. Uneasily he remembered Buckley's cryptic remark:
"Either Yut Wuen is lying about that telephone call, or&mdash;" The
detective had left the sentence unfinished, casting a glance at
Brill that was as inscrutable as his speech. Nobody believed the
Chinaman was deliberately lying. His devotion to his master was
well known&mdash;a devotion shared by the other servants of the
dead man. Police suspicion had failed to connect them in any way
with the crime. Apparently none of them had left Reynolds' town
house during the day or the night of the murder. Nor had the
murder-cottage given up any clues. No tracks had been found on the
hard earth, no fingerprints on the gun other than the dead man's
nor any except Buckley's on the light switch. If Buckley had had
any luck in trying to trace the mysterious phone call, he had not
divulged anything.</p>

<p>Brill remembered, with a twinge of nervousness, the way in which
they had looked at him, those inscrutable Orientals. Their features
had been immobile, but in their dark eyes had gleamed suspicion and
a threat. He had seen it in the eyes of Yut Wuen, the stocky yellow
man; of Ali, the Egyptian, a lean, sinewy statue of bronze; of
Jugra Singh, the tall, broad shouldered, turbaned Sikh. They had
not spoken their thoughts; but their eyes had followed him, hot and
burning, like beasts of prey.</p>

<p>Brill turned from the meandering driveway to cut across the
lawn. As he passed under the black shadow of the trees, something
sudden, clinging and smothering, enveloped his head, and steely
arms locked fiercely about him. His reaction was as instinctive and
violent as that of a trapped leopard. He exploded into a galvanized
burst of frantic action, a bucking heave that tore the stifling
cloak from his head, and freed his arms from the arms that pinioned
him. But another pair of arms hung like grim Fate to his legs, and
figures surged in on him from the darkness. He could not tell the
nature of his assailants; they were like denser, moving shadows in
the blackness.</p>

<p>Staggering, fighting for balance, he lashed out blindly, felt
the jolt of a solid hit shoot up his arm, and saw one of the
shadows sway and pitch backward. His other arm was caught in a
savage grasp and twisted up behind his back so violently that he
felt as if the tendons were being ripped from their roots. Hot
breath hissed in his ear, and bending his head forward, he jerked
it backward again with all the power of his thick neck muscles. He
felt the back of his skull crash into something softer&mdash;a
man's face. There was a groan, and the crippling grip on his
imprisoned arm relaxed. With a desperate wrench he tore away, but
the arms that clung to his legs tripped him. He pitched headlong,
spreading his arms to break his fall, and even before his fingers
touched the ground, something exploded in his brain, showering a
suddenly starless night of blackness with red sparks that were
engulfed abruptly in formless oblivion.</p>

<p>Joel Brill's first conscious thought was that he was being
tossed about in an open boat on a stormy sea. Then as his dazed
mind cleared, he realized that he was lying in an automobile which
was speeding along an uneven road. His head throbbed; he was bound
hand and foot, and blanketed in some kind of a cloak. He could see
nothing; could hear nothing but the purr of the racing motor.
Bewilderment clouded his mind as be sought for a clue to the
identity of the kidnappers. Then a sudden suspicion brought out the
cold sweat on his skin.</p>

<p>The car lurched to a halt. Powerful hands lifted him, cloak and
all, and he felt himself being carried over a short stretch of
level ground, and apparently up a step or so. A key grated in a
lock, a door rasped on its hinges. Those carrying him advanced;
there was a click, and light shone through the folds of the cloth
over Brill's head. He felt himself being lowered onto what felt
like a bed. Then the cloth was ripped away, and he blinked in the
glare of the light. A cold premonitory shudder passed over him.</p>

<p>He was lying on the bed in the room in which James Reynolds had
died. And about him stood, arms folded, three grim and silent
shapes: Yut Wuen, Ali the Egyptian, and Jugra Singh. There was
dried blood on the Chinaman's yellow face, and his lip was cut. A
dark blue bruise showed on Jugra Singh's jaw.</p>

<p>"The <i>sahib</i> awakes," said the Sikh, in his perfect
English.</p>

<p>"What the devil's the idea, Jugra?" demanded Brill, trying to
struggle to a sitting posture. "What do you mean by this? Take
these ropes off me&mdash;" His voice trailed away, a shaky
resonance of futility as he read the meaning in the hot dark eyes
that regarded him.</p>

<p>"In this room our master met his doom," said Ali.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> called him forth," said Yut Wuen.</p>

<p>"But I didn't!" raged Brill, jerking wildly at the cords which
cut into his flesh. "Damn it, I knew nothing about it!"</p>

<p>"Your voice came over the wire and our master followed it to his
death," said Jugra Singh.</p>

<p>A panic of helplessness swept over Joel Brill. He felt like a
man beating at an insurmountable wall&mdash;the wall of inexorable
Oriental fatalism, of conviction unchangeable. If even Buckley
believed that somehow he, Joel Brill, was connected with Reynolds'
death, how was he to convince these immutable Orientals? He fought
down an impulse to hysteria.</p>

<p>"The detective, Buckley, was with me all evening," he said, in a
voice unnatural from his efforts at control. "He has told you that
he did not see me touch a phone; nor did I leave his sight. I could
not have killed my friend, your master, because while he was being
killed, I was either in the library of the Corinthian Club, or
driving from there with Buckley."</p>

<p>"How it was done, we do not know," answered the Sikh,
tranquilly. "The ways of the <i>sahibs</i> are beyond us. But we
<i>know</i> that somehow, in some manner, you caused our master's
death. And we have brought you here to expiate your crime."</p>

<p>"You mean to murder me?" demanded Brill, his flesh crawling.</p>

<p>"If a <i>sahib</i> judge sentenced you, and a <i>sahib</i>
hangman dropped you through a black trap, white men would call it
execution. So it is execution we work upon you, not murder."</p>

<p>Brill opened his mouth, then closed it, realizing the utter
futility of argument. The whole affair was like a fantastic
nightmare from which he would presently awaken.</p>

<p>Ali came forward with something, the sight of which shook Brill
with a nameless foreboding. It was a wire cage, in which a great
gaunt rat squealed and bit at the wires. Yut Wuen laid upon a card
table a copper bowl, furnished with a slot on each side of the rim,
to one of which was made fast a long leather strap. Brill turned
suddenly sick.</p>

<p>"These are the tools of execution, <i>sahib</i>," said Jugra
Singh, somberly. "That bowl shall be laid on your naked belly, the
strap drawn about your body and made fast so that the bowl shall
not slip. Inside the bowl the rat will be imprisoned. He is
ravenous with hunger, wild with fear and rage. For a while he will
only run about the bowl, treading on your flesh. But with irons hot
from the fire, we shall gradually heat the bowl, until, driven by
pain, the rat begins to gnaw his way <i>out</i>. He can not gnaw
through copper; he can gnaw through flesh&mdash;through flesh and
muscles and intestines and bones, <i>sahib</i>."</p>

<p>Brill wet his lips three times before he found voice to
speak.</p>

<p>"You'll hang for this!" he gasped, in a voice he did not himself
recognize.</p>

<p>"If it be the will of Allah," assented Ali calmly. "This is your
fate; what ours is, no man can say. It is the will of Allah that
you die with a rat in your bowels. If it is Allah's will, we shall
die on the gallows. Only Allah knows."</p>

<p>Brill made no reply. Some vestige of pride still remained to
him. He set his jaw hard, feeling that if he opened his mouth to
speak, to reason, to argue, he would collapse into shameful shrieks
and entreaties. One was useless as the other, against the abysmal
fatalism of the Orient.</p>

<p>Ali set the cage with its grisly Occupant on the table beside
the copper bowl&mdash;without warning the light went out.</p>

<p>In the darkness Brill's heart began to pound suffocatingly. The
Orientals stood still, patiently, expecting the light to come on
again. But Brill instinctively felt that the stage was set for some
drama darker and more hideous than that which menaced him. Silence
reigned; somewhere off in the woods a night bird lifted a drowsy
note. There was a faint scratching sound, somewhere&mdash;</p>

<p>"The electric torch," muttered a ghostly voice which Brill
recognized as Jugra Singh's. "I laid it on the card table.
Wait!"</p>

<p>He heard the Sikh fumbling in the dark; but he was watching the
window, a square of dim, star-flecked sky blocked out of blackness.
And as Brill watched, he saw something dark and bulky rear up in
that square. Etched against the stars he saw a misshapen head,
vague monstrous shoulders.</p>

<p>A scream sounded from inside the room, the crash of a wildly
thrown missile. On the instant there was a scrambling sound, and
the object blotted out the square of starlight, then vanished from
it. <i>It was inside the room.</i></p>

<p>Brill, lying frozen in his cords, heard all Hell and bedlam
break loose in that dark room. Screams, shouts, strident cries of
agony mingled with the smashing of furniture, the impact of blows,
and a hideous, worrying, tearing sound that made Brill's flesh
crawl. Once the battling pack staggered past the window, but Brill
made out only a dim writhing of limbs, the pale glint of steel, and
the terrible blaze of a pair of eyes he knew belonged to none of
his three captors.</p>

<p>Somewhere a man was moaning horribly, his gasps growing weaker
and weaker. There was a last convulsion of movement, the groaning
impact of a heavy body; then the starlight in the window was for an
instant blotted out again, and silence reigned once more in the
cottage on the lake shore; silence broken only by the death gasps
in the dark, and the labored panting of a wounded man.</p>

<p>Brill heard some one stumbling and floundering in the darkness,
and it was from this one that the racking, panting was emanating. A
circle of light flashed on, and in it Brill saw the blood-smeared
face of Jugra Singh.</p>

<p>The light wandered erratically away, dancing crazily about the
walls. Brill heard the Sikh blundering across the room, moving like
a drunken man, or like one wounded unto death. The flash shone full
in the scientist's face, blinding him. Fingers tugged awkwardly at
his cords, a knife edge was dragged across them, slicing skin as
well as hemp.</p>

<p>Jugra Singh sank to the floor. The flash thumped beside him and
went out. Brill groped for him, found his shoulder. The cloth was
soaked with what Brill knew was blood.</p>

<p>"You spoke truth, <i>sahib</i>," the Sikh whispered. "How the
call came in the likeness of your voice, I do not know. But I know,
now, what slew Reynolds, <i>sahib</i>. After all these
years&mdash;but they never forget, though the broad sea lies
between. Beware! The fiend may return. The gold&mdash;the gold was
cursed&mdash;I told Reynolds, <i>sahib</i>&mdash;had he heeded me,
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sudden welling of blood drowned the laboring voice. Under
Brill's hand the great body stiffened and twisted in a brief
convulsion, then went limp.</p>

<p>Groping on the floor, the scientist failed to find the
flashlight. He groped along the wall, found the switch and flooded
the cottage with light.</p>

<p>Turning back into the room, a stifled cry escaped his lips.</p>

<p>Jugra Singh lay slumped near the bed; huddled in a corner was
Yut Wuen, his yellow hands, palms upturned, limp on the floor at
his sides; Ali sprawled face down in the middle of the room. All
three were dead. Throats, breasts and bellies were slashed to
ribbons; their garments were in strips, and among the rags hung
bloody tatters of flesh. Yut Wuen had been disemboweled, and the
gaping wounds of the others were like those of sheep after a
mountain lion has ranged through the fold.</p>

<p>A blackjack still stuck in Yut Wuen's belt. Ali's dead hand
clutched a knife, but it was unstained. Death had struck them
before they could use their weapons. But on the floor near Jugra
Singh lay a great curved dagger, and it was red to the hilt. Bloody
stains led across the floor and up over the window sill. Brill
found the flash, snapped it on, and leaned out the window, playing
the white beam on the ground outside. Dark, irregular splotches
showed, leading off toward the dense woods.</p>

<p>With the flash in one hand and the Sikh's knife in the other,
Brill followed those stains. At the edge of the trees he came upon
a track, and the short hairs lifted on his scalp. A foot, planted
in a pool of blood, had limned its imprint in crimson on the hard
loam. And the foot, bare and splay, was that of a human.</p>

<p>That print upset vague theories of a feline or anthropoid
killer, stirred nebulous thoughts at the back of his mind&mdash;dim
and awful race memories of semi-human ghouls, of werewolves who
walked like men and slew like beasts.</p>

<p>A low groan brought him to a halt, his flesh crawling. Under the
black trees in the silence, that sound was pregnant with grisly
probabilities. Gripping the knife firmly, he flashed the beam ahead
of him. The thin light wavered, then focused on a black heap that
was not part of the forest.</p>

<p>Brill bent over the figure and stood transfixed, transported
back across the years and across the world to another wilder,
grimmer woodland.</p>

<p>It was a naked black man that lay at his feet, his glassy eyes
reflecting the waning light. His legs were short, bowed and
gnarled, his arms long, his shoulders abnormally broad, his shaven
head set plump between them without visible neck. That head was
hideously malformed; the forehead projected almost into a peek,
while the back of the skull was unnaturally flattened. White paint
banded face, shoulders and breast. But it was at the creature's
fingers which Brill looked longest. At first glance they seemed
monstrously deformed. Then he saw that those hands were furnished
with long curving steel hooks, sharp-pointed, and keen-edged on the
concave side. To each finger one of these barbarous weapons was
made fast, and those fingers, like the hooks clotted and smeared
with blood, twitched exactly as the talons of a leopard twitch.</p>

<p>A light step brought him round. His dimming light played on a
tall figure, and Brill mumbled: "John Galt!" in no great surprise.
He was so numbed by bewilderment that the strangeness of the man's
presence did not occur to him.</p>

<p>"What in God's name is this?" demanded the tall explorer, taking
the light from Brill's hand and directing it on the mangled shape.
"What in Heaven's name is that?"</p>

<p>"A black nightmare from Africa!" Brill found his tongue at last,
and speech came in a rush. "An Egbo! A leopard man! I learned of
them when I was on the West Coast. He belongs to a native cult
which worships the leopard. They take a male infant and subject his
head to pressure, to make it deformed; and he is brought up to
believe that the spirit of a leopard inhabits his body. He does the
bidding of the cult's head, which mainly consists of executing the
enemies of the cult. He is, in effect, a human leopard!"</p>

<p>"What's he doing here?" demanded Galt, in seeming
incredulity.</p>

<p>"God knows. But he must have been the thing that killed
Reynolds. He killed Reynolds' three servants tonight&mdash;would
have killed me, too, I suppose, but Jugra Singh wounded him, and he
evidently dragged himself away like a wild beast to die in the
jungle&mdash;"</p>

<p>Galt seemed curiously uninterested in Brill's stammering
narrative.</p>

<p>"Sure he's dead?" he muttered, bending closer to flash the light
into the hideous face. The illumination was dim; the battery was
swiftly burning out.</p>

<p>As Brill was about to speak, the painted face was briefly
convulsed. The glazed eyes gleamed as with a last surge of life. A
clawed hand stirred, lifted feebly up toward Galt. A few gutturals
seeped through the blubbery lips; the fingers writhed weakly,
slipped from the iron talons, which the black man lifted, as if
trying to hand them to Galt. Then he shuddered, sank back and lay
still. He had been stabbed under the heart, and only a beast-like
vitality had carried him so far.</p>

<p>Galt straightened and faced Brill, turning the light on him. A
beat of silence cut between them, in which the atmosphere was
electric with tension.</p>

<p>"You understand the Ekoi dialect?" It was more an assertion than
a question.</p>

<p>Brill's heart was pounding, a new bewilderment vying with a
rising wrath. "Yes," he answered shortly.</p>

<p>"What did that fool say?" softly asked Galt.</p>

<p>Brill set his teeth and stubbornly took the plunge reason cried
out against. "He said," he replied between his teeth, "'Master,
take my tools to the tribe, and tell them of our vengeance; they
will give you what I promised you.'"</p>

<p>Even as he ground out the words, his powerful body crouched, his
nerves taut for the grapple. But before he could move, the black
muzzle of an automatic trained on his belly.</p>

<p>"Too bad you had to understand that death-bed confession,
Brill," said Galt, coolly. "I don't want to kill you. I've kept
blood off <i>my</i> hands so far through this affair. Listen,
you're a poor man, like most scientists&mdash;how'd you consider
cutting in on a fortune? Wouldn't that be preferable to getting a
slug through your guts and being planted alongside those
yellow-bellied stiffs down in Reynolds' shack for them to get the
blame?"</p>

<p>"No man wants to die," answered Brill, his gaze fixed on the
light in Galt's hand&mdash;the glow which was rapidly turning
redder and dimmer.</p>

<p>"Good!" snapped Galt. "I'll give you the low down. Reynolds got
his money in the Kameroons&mdash;stole gold from the Ekoi, which
they had stored in the ju-ju hut; he killed a priest of the Egbo
cult in getting away. Jugra Singh was with him. But they didn't get
all the gold. And after that the Ekoi took good care to guard it so
nobody could steal what was left.</p>

<p>"I knew this fellow, Guja, when I was in Africa. I was after the
Ekoi gold then, but I never had a chance to locate it. I met Guja a
few months ago, again. He'd been exiled from his tribe for some
crime, had wandered to the Coast and been picked up with some more
natives who were brought to America for exhibition in the World's
Fair.</p>

<p>"Guja was mad to get back to his people, and he spilled the
whole story of the gold. Told me that if he could kill Reynolds,
his tribe would forgive him. He knew that Reynolds was somewhere in
America, but he was helpless as a child to find him. I offered to
arrange his meeting with the gold-thief, if Guja would agree to
give me some of the gold his tribe hoarded.</p>

<p>"He swore by the skull of the great leopard. I brought him
secretly into these hills, and hid him up yonder in a shack the
existence of which nobody suspects. It took me a wretched time to
teach him just what he was to do&mdash;he'd no more brains than an
ape. Night after night I went through the thing with him, until he
learned the procedure: to watch in the hills until he saw a light
flash in Reynolds' shack. Then steal down there, jerk the switch
&mdash;and kill. These leopard men can see like cats at night.</p>

<p>"I called Reynolds up myself; it wasn't hard to imitate your
voice. I used to do impersonations in vaudeville. While Guja was
tearing the life out of Reynolds, I was dining at a well-known
night club, in full sight of all.</p>

<p>"I came here tonight to smuggle him out of the country. But his
blood- lust must have betrayed him. When he saw the light flash on
in the cottage again, it must have started a train of associations
that led him once more to the cottage, to kill whoever he found
there. I saw the tag-end of the business &mdash;saw him stagger
away from the shack, and then you follow him.</p>

<p>"Now then, I've shot the works. Nobody knows I'm mixed up in
this business, but you. Will you keep your mouth shut and take a
share of the Ekoi gold?"</p>

<p>The glow went out. In the sudden darkness, Brill, his pent-up
feelings exploding at last, yelled: "Damn you, no! You murdering
dog!" and sprang aside. The pistol cracked, an orange jet sliced
the darkness, and the bullet fanned Brill's ear as he threw the
heavy knife blindly. He heard it rattle futilely through the
bushes, and stood frozen with the realization that he had lost his
desperate gamble.</p>

<p>But even as he braced himself against the tearing impact of the
bullet he expected, a sudden beam drilled the blackness,
illuminating the convulsed features of John Galt.</p>

<p>"Don't move, Galt; I've got the drop on you."</p>

<p>It was the voice of Buckley. With a snarl, Galt took as
desperate a chance as Brill had taken. He wheeled toward the source
of the light, snapping down his automatic. But even as he did so,
the detective's .45 crashed, and outlined against the brief glare,
Galt swayed and fell like a tall tree struck by lightning.</p>

<p>"Dead?" asked the scientist, mechanically.</p>

<p>"Bullet tore through his forearm and smashed his shoulder,"
grunted Buckley. "Just knocked out temporarily. He'll live to
decorate the gallows."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you heard&mdash;?" Brill stuttered.</p>

<p>"Everything. I was just coming around the bend of the lake shore
and saw a light in Reynolds' cottage, then your flash bobbing among
the trees. I came sneaking through the bushes just in time to hear
you give your translation of the nigger's dying words. I've been
prowling around this lake all night."</p>

<p>"You suspected Galt all the time?"</p>

<p>The detective grinned wryly.</p>

<p>"I ought to say yes, and establish myself as a super sleuth. But
the fact is, I suspected <i>you</i> all the time. That's why I came
up here tonight&mdash;trying to figure out your connection with the
murder. That alibi of yours was so iron-clad it looked phony to me.
I had a sneaking suspicion that I'd bumped into a master-mind
trying to put over the 'perfect crime.' I apologize! I've been
reading too many detective stories lately!"</p>
