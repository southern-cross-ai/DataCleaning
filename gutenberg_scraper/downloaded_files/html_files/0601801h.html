<p style="text-indent:0">FEAR? Your pardon, <i>Messieurs</i>, but
the meaning of fear you do not know. No, I hold to my statement.
You are soldiers, adventurers. You have known the charges of
regiments of dragoons, the frenzy of wind-lashed seas. But fear,
real hair-raising, horror-crawling fear, you have not known. I
myself have known such fear; but until the legions of darkness
swirl from hell's gate and the world flames to ruin, will never
such fear again be known to men.</p>

<p>Hark, I will tell you the tale; for it was many years ago and
half across the world; and none of you will ever see the man of
whom I tell you, or seeing, know.</p>

<p>Return, then, with me across the years to a day when I; a
reckless young cavalier, stepped from the small boat that had
landed me from the ship floating in the harbor, cursed the mud that
littered the crude wharf, and strode up the landing toward the
castle, in answer to the invitation of an old friend, Dom Vincente
da Lusto.</p>

<p>Dom Vincente was a strange, far-sighted man&mdash;a strong man,
one who saw visions beyond the ken of his time. In his veins,
perhaps, ran the blood of those old Phoenicians who, the priests
tell us, ruled the seas and built cities in far lands, in the dim
ages. His plan of fortune was strange and yet successful; few men
would have thought of it; fewer could have succeeded. For his
estate was upon the western coast of that dark, mystic continent,
that baffler of explorers&mdash;Africa.</p>

<p>There by a small bay had he cleared away the sullen jungle,
built his castle and his storehouses, and with ruthless hand had he
wrested the riches of the land. Four ships he had: three smaller
craft and one great galleon. These plied between his domains and
the cities of Spain, Portugal, France, and even England, laden with
rare woods, ivory, slaves; the thousand strange riches that Dom
Vincente had gained by trade and by conquest.</p>

<p>Aye, a wild venture, a wilder commerce. And yet might he have
shaped an empire from the dark land, had it not been for the
rat-faced Carlos, his nephew&mdash;but I run ahead of my tale.</p>

<p>Look, <i>Messieurs</i>, I draw a map on the table, thus, with
finger dipped in wine. Here lay the small, shallow harbor, and here
the wide wharves. A landing ran thus, up the slight slope with
hutlike warehouses on each side, and here it stopped at a wide,
shallow moat. Over it went a narrow drawbridge and then one was
confronted with a high palisade of logs set in the ground. This
extended entirely around the castle. The castle itself was built on
the model of another, earlier age; being more for strength than
beauty. Built of stone brought from a great distance; years of
labor and a thousand Negroes toiling beneath the lash had reared
its walls, and now, completed, it offered an almost impregnable
appearance. Such was the&mdash;intention of its builders, for
Barbary pirates ranged the coasts, and the horror of a native
uprising lurked ever near.</p>

<p>A space of about a half-mile on every side of the castle was
kept cleared away and roads had been built through the marshy land.
All this had required an immense amount of labor, but manpower was
plentiful. A present to a chief, and he furnished all that was
needed. And Portuguese know how to make men work!</p>

<p>Less than three hundred yards to the east of the castle ran a
wide, shallow river, which emptied into the harbor. The name has
entirely slipped my mind. It was a heathenish title and I could
never lay my tongue to it.</p>

<p>I found that I was not the only friend invited to the castle. It
seems that once a year or some such matter, Dom Vincente brought a
host of jolly companions to his lonely estate and made merry for
some weeks, to make up for the work and solitude of the rest of the
year.</p>

<p>In fact, it was nearly night, and a great banquet was in
progress when I entered. I was acclaimed with great delight,
greeted boisterously by friends and introduced to such strangers as
were there.</p>

<p>Entirely too weary to take much part in the revelry, I ate,
drank quietly, listened to the toasts and songs, and studied the
feasters.</p>

<p>Dom Vincente, of course, I knew, as I had been intimate with him
for years; also his pretty niece, Ysabel, who was one reason I had
accepted his invitation to come to that stinking wilderness. Her
second cousin, Carlos, I knew and disliked&mdash;a sly, mincing
fellow with a face like a mink's. Then there was my old friend,
Luigi Verenza, an Italian; and his flirt of a sister, Marcita,
making eyes at the men as usual. Then there was a short, stocky
German who called himself Baron von Schiller; and Jean Desmarte, an
out-at-the-elbows nobleman of Gascony; and Don Florenzo de Seville,
a lean, dark, silent man, who called himself a Spaniard and wore a
rapier nearly as long as himself.</p>

<p>There were others, men and women, but it was long ago and all
their names and faces I do not remember.</p>

<p>But there was one man whose face somehow drew my gaze as an
alchemist's magnet draws steel. He was a leanly built man of
slightly more than medium height, dressed plainly, almost
austerely, and he wore a sword almost as long as the
Spaniard's.</p>

<p>But it was neither his clothes nor his sword which attracted my
attention. It was his face. A refined, high-bred face, it was
furrowed deep with lines that gave it a weary, haggard expression.
Tiny scars flecked jaw and forehead as if torn by savage claws; I
could have sworn the narrow gray eyes had a fleeting, haunted look
in their expression at times.</p>

<p>I leaned over to that flirt, Marcita, and asked the name of the
man, as it had slipped my mind that we had been introduced.</p>

<p>"De Montour, from Normandy," she answered. "A strange man. I
don't think I like him."</p>

<p>"Then he resists your snares, my little enchantress?" I
murmured; long friendship making me as immune from her anger as
from her wiles. But she chose not to be angry and answered coyly,
glancing from under demurely lowered lashes.</p>

<p>I watched de Montour much, feeling somehow a strange
fascination. He ate lightly, drank much, seldom spoke, and then
only to answer questions.</p>

<p>Presently, toasts making the rounds, I noticed his companions
urging him to rise and give a health. At first he refused, then
rose, upon their repeated urgings, and stood silent for a moment,
goblet raised. He seemed to dominate, to overawe the group of
revelers. Then with a mocking, savage laugh, he lifted the goblet
above his head.</p>

<p>"To Solomon," he exclaimed, "who bound all devils! And thrice
cursed be he for that some escaped!"</p>

<p>A toast and a curse in one! It was drunk silently, and with many
sidelong, doubting glances.</p>

<p>That night I retired early, weary of the long sea voyage and my
head spinning from the strength of the wine,&mdash;of which Dom
Vincente kept such great stores.</p>

<p>My room was near the top of the castle and looked out toward the
forests of the south and the river. The room was furnished in
crude, barbaric splendor, as was all the rest of the castle.</p>

<p>Going to the window, I gazed out at the arquebusier pacing the
castle grounds just inside the palisade; at the cleared space lying
unsightly and barren in the moonlight; at the forest beyond; at the
silent river.</p>

<p>From the native quarters close to the river bank came the weird
twanging of some rude lute, sounding a barbaric melody.</p>

<p>In the dark shadows of the forest some uncanny nightbird lifted
a mocking voice. A thousand minor notes sounded&mdash;birds, and
beasts, and the devil knows what else! Some great jungle cat began
a hair-lifting yowling. I shrugged my shoulders and turned from the
windows. Surely devils lurked in those somber depths.</p>

<p>There came a knock at my door and I opened it, to admit de
Montour.</p>

<p>He strode to the window and gazed at the moon, which rode
resplendent and glorious.</p>

<p>"The moon is almost full, is it not, <i>Monsieur</i>?" he
remarked, turning to me. I nodded, and I could have sworn that he
shuddered.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, <i>Monsieur</i>. I will not annoy you further." He
turned to go, but at the door turned and retraced his steps.</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur</i>," he almost whispered, with a fierce intensity,
"whatever you do, be sure you bar and bolt your door tonight!"</p>

<p>Then he was gone, leaving me to stare after him
bewilderedly.</p>

<p>I dozed off to sleep, the distant shouts of the revelers in my
ears, and though I was weary, or perhaps because of it, I slept
lightly. While I never really awoke until morning, sounds and
noises seemed to drift to me through my veil of slumber, and once
it seemed that something was prying and shoving against the bolted
door.</p>

<p>As is to be supposed, most of the guests were in a beastly humor
the following day and remained in their rooms most of the morning
or else straggled down late. Besides Dom Vincente there were really
only three of the masculine members sober: de Montour; the
Spaniard, de Seville (as he called himself); and myself. The
Spaniard never touched wine, and though de Montour consumed
incredible quantities of it, it never affected him in any way.</p>

<p>The ladies greeted us most graciously.</p>

<p>"S'truth, <i>Signor</i>," remarked that minx Marcita, giving me
her hand with a gracious air that was like to make me snicker, "I
am glad to see there are gentlemen among us who care more for our
company than for the wine cup; for most of them are most
surprisingly befuddled this morning."</p>

<p>Then with a most outrageous turning of her wondrous eyes,
"Methinks someone was too drunk to be discreet last night&mdash;or
not drunk enough. For unless my poor senses deceive me much,
someone came fumbling at my door late in the night."</p>

<p>"Ha!" I exclaimed in quick anger, "some&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"No. Hush." She glanced about as if to see that we were alone,
then: "Is it not strange that Signor de Montour, before he retired
last night, instructed me to fasten my door firmly?"</p>

<p>"Strange," I murmured, but did not tell her that he had told me
the same thing.</p>

<p>"And is it not strange, Pierre, that though Signor de Montour
left the banquet hall even before you did, yet he has the
appearance of one who has been up all night?"</p>

<p>I shrugged. A woman's fancies are often strange.</p>

<p>"Tonight," she said roguishly, "I will leave my door unbolted
and see whom I catch."</p>

<p>"You will do no such thing."</p>

<p>She showed her little teeth in a contemptuous smile and
displayed a small, wicked dagger.</p>

<p>"Listen, imp. De Montour gave me the same warning he did you.
Whatever he knew, whoever prowled the halls last night, the object
was more apt murder than amorous adventure. Keep you your doors
bolted. The lady Ysabel shares your room, does she not?"</p>

<p>"Not she. And I send my woman to the slave quarters at night,"
she murmured, gazing mischievously at me from beneath drooping
eyelids.</p>

<p>"One would think you a girl of no character from your talk," I
told her, with the frankness of youth and of long friendship. "Walk
with care, young lady, else I tell your brother to spank you."</p>

<p>And I walked away to pay my respects to Ysabel. The Portuguese
girl was the very opposite of Marcita, being a shy, modest young
thing, not so beautiful as the Italian, but exquisitely pretty in
an appealing, almost childish air. I once had thoughts&mdash;Hi ho!
To be young and foolish!</p>

<p>Your pardon, <i>Messieurs</i>. An old man's mind wanders. It was
of de Montour that I meant to tell you&mdash;de Montour and Dom
Vincente's mink-faced cousin.</p>

<p>A band of armed natives were thronged about the gates, kept at a
distance by the Portuguese soldiers. Among them were some score of
young men and women all naked, chained neck to neck. Slaves they
were, captured by some warlike tribe and brought for sale. Dom
Vincente looked them over personally.</p>

<p>Followed a long haggling and bartering, of which I quickly
wearied and turned away, wondering that a man of Dom Vincente's
rank could so demean himself as to stoop to trade.</p>

<p>But I strolled back when one of the natives of the village
nearby came up and interrupted the sale with a long harangue to Dom
Vincente.</p>

<p>While they talked de Montour came up, and presently Dom Vincente
turned to us and said, "One of the woodcutters of the village was
torn to pieces by a leopard or some such beast last night. A strong
young man and unmarried."</p>

<p>"A leopard? Did they, see it?" suddenly asked de Montour, and
when Dom Vincente said no, that it came and went in the night, de
Montour lifted a trembling hand and drew it across his forehead, as
if to brush away cold sweat.</p>

<p>"Look you, Pierre," quoth Dom Vincente, "I have here a slave
who, wonder of wonders, desires to be your man. Though the devil
only knows why."</p>

<p>He led up a slim young Jakri, a mere youth, whose main asset
seemed a merry grin.</p>

<p>"He is yours," said Dom Vincente. "He is goodly trained and will
make a fine servant. And look ye, a slave is of an advantage over a
servant, for all he requires is food and a loincloth or so with a
touch of the whip to keep him in his place."</p>

<p>It was not long before. I learned why Gola wished to be "my
man," choosing me among all the rest. It was because of my hair.
Like many dandies of that day, I wore it long and curled, the
strands falling to my shoulders. As it happened, I was the only man
of the party who so wore my hair, and Gola would sit and gaze at it
in silent admiration for hours at a time, or until, growing nervous
under his unblinking scrutiny, I would boot him forth.</p>

<p>It was that night that a brooding animosity, hardly apparent,
between Baron von Schiller and Jean Desmarie broke out into a
flame.</p>

<p>As usual, a woman was the cause. Marcita carried on a most
outrageous flirtation with both of them.</p>

<p>That was not wise. Desmarte was a wild young fool. Von Schiller
was a lustful beast. But when, <i>Messieurs</i>, did woman ever use
wisdom?</p>

<p>Their hate flamed to a murderous fury when the German sought to
kiss Marcita.</p>

<p>Swords were clashing in an instant. But before Dom Vincente
could thunder a command to halt, Luigi was between the combatants,
and had beaten their swords down, hurling them back viciously.</p>

<p>"<i>Signori</i>," said he softly, but with a fierce intensity,
"is it the part of high-bred <i>signori</i> to fight over my
sister? Ha, by the toenails of Satan, for the toss of a coin I
would call you both out! You, Marcita, go to your chamber,
instantly, nor leave until I give you permission."</p>

<p>And she went, for, independent though she was, none cared to
face the slim, effeminate-appearing youth when a tigerish snarl
curled his lips, a murderous gleam lightened his dark eyes.</p>

<p>Apologies were made, but from the glances the two rivals threw
at each other, we knew that the quarrel was not forgotten and would
blaze forth again at the slightest pretext.</p>

<p>Late that night I woke suddenly with a strange, eerie feeling of
horror. Why, I could not say. I rose, saw that the door was firmly
bolted, and seeing Gola asleep on the floor, kicked him awake
irritably.</p>

<p>And just as he got up, hastily, rubbing himself, the silence was
broken by a wild scream, a scream that rang through the castle and
brought a startled shout from the arquebusier pacing the palisade;
a scream from the mouth of a girl, frenzied with terror.</p>

<p>Gola squawked and dived behind the divan. I jerked the door open
and raced down the dark corridor. Dashing down a winding stair, I
caromed into someone at the bottom and we tumbled headlong.</p>

<p>He gasped something and I recognized the voice of Jean Desmarte.
I hauled him to his feet, and raced along, he following; the
screams had ceased, but the whole castle was in an uproar, voices
shouting, the clank of weapons, lights flashing up, Dom Vincente's
voice shouting for the soldiers, the noise of armed men rushing
through the rooms and falling over each other. With all the
confusion, Desmarte, the Spaniard, and I reached Marcita's room
just as Luigi darted inside and snatched his sister into his
arms.</p>

<p>Others rushed in, carrying lights and weapons, shouting,
demanding to know what was occurring.</p>

<p>The girl lay quietly in her brother's arms, her dark hair loose
and rippling over her shoulders, her dainty night-garments torn to
shreds and exposing her lovely body. Long scratches showed upon her
arms, breasts and shoulders.</p>

<p>Presently, she opened her eyes, shuddered, then shrieked wildly
and clung frantically to Luigi, begging him not to let something
take her.</p>

<p>"The door!" she whimpered. "I left it unbarred. And
<i>something</i> crept into my room through the darkness. I struck
at it with my dagger and it hurled me to the floor, tearing,
tearing at me. Then I fainted."</p>

<p>"Where is von Schiller?" asked the Spaniard, a fierce glint in
his dark eyes. Every man glanced at his neighbor. All the guests
were there except the German. I noted de Montour gazing at the
terrified girl, his face more haggard than usual. And I thought it
strange that he wore no weapon.</p>

<p>"Aye, von Schiller!" exclaimed Desmarte fiercely. And half of us
followed Dom Vincente out into the corridor. We began a vengeful
search through the castle, and in a small, dark hallway we found
von Schiller. On his face he lay, in a crimson, ever-widening
stain.</p>

<p>"This is the work of some native!" exclaimed Desmarte, face
aghast.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," bellowed Dom Vincente. "No native from the outside
could pass the soldiers. All slaves, von Schiller's among them,
were barred and bolted in the slave quarters, except Gola, who
sleeps in Pierre's room, and Ysabel's woman."</p>

<p>"But who else could have done this deed?" exclaimed Desmarte in
a fury.</p>

<p>"You!" I said abruptly; "else why ran you so swiftly away from
the room of Marcita?"</p>

<p>"Curse you, you lie!" he shouted, and his swift-drawn sword
leaped for my breast; but quick as he was, the Spaniard was
quicker. Desmarte's rapier clattered against the wall and Desmarte
stood like a statue, the Spaniard's motionless point just touching
his throat.</p>

<p>"Bind him," said the Spaniard without passion.</p>

<p>"Put down your blade, Don Florenzo," commanded Dom Vincente,
striding forward and dominating the scene. "Signor Desmarte, you
are one of my best friends, but I am the only law here and duty
must be done. Give your word that you will not seek to escape."</p>

<p>"I give it," replied the Gascon calmly. "I acted hastily. I
apologize. I was not intentionally running away, but the halls and
corridors of this cursed castle confuse me."</p>

<p>Of us all, probably but one man believed him.</p>

<p>"<i>Messieurs</i>!" De Montour stepped forward. "This youth is
not guilty. Turn the German over."</p>

<p>Two soldiers did as he asked. De Montour shuddered, pointing.
The rest of us glanced once, then recoiled in horror.</p>

<p>"Could man have done that thing?"</p>

<p>"With a dagger&mdash;" began someone.</p>

<p>"No dagger makes wounds like that," said the Spaniard. "The
German was torn to pieces by the talons of some frightful
beast."</p>

<p>We glanced about us, half expecting some hideous monster to leap
upon us from the shadows.</p>

<p>We searched that castle; every foot, every inch of it. And we
found no trace of any beast.</p>

<p>Dawn was breaking when I returned to my room, to find that Gola
had barred himself in; and it took me nearly a half-hour to
convince him to let me in.</p>

<p>Having smacked him soundly and berated him for his cowardice, I
told him what had taken place, as he could understand French and
could speak a weird mixture which he proudly called French.</p>

<p>His mouth gaped and only the whites of his eyes showed as the
tale reached its climax.</p>

<p>"Ju ju!" he whispered fearsomely. "Fetish man!"</p>

<p>Suddenly an idea came to me. I had heard vague tales, little
more than hints of legends, of the devilish leopard cult that
existed on the West Coast. No white man had ever seen one of its
votaries, but Dom Vincente had told us tales of beast-men,
disguised in skins of leopards, who stole through the midnight
jungle and slew and devoured. A ghastly thrill traveled up and down
my spine, and in an instant I had Gola in a grasp which made him
yell.</p>

<p>"Was that a leopard-man?" I hissed, shaking him viciously.</p>

<p>"Massa, massa!" he gasped. "Me good boy! Ju ju man get! More
besser no tell!"</p>

<p>"You'll tell me!" I gritted, renewing my endeavors, until, his
hands waving feeble protests, he promised to tell me what he
knew.</p>

<p>"No leopard-man!" he whispered, and his eyes grew big with
supernatural fear. "Moon, he full, woodcutter find, him heap
clawed. Find 'nother woodcutter. Big Massa (Dom Vincente) say,
'leopard.' No leopard. But leopard-man, he come to kill.
<i>Something kill leopard-man</i>! Heap claw! Hai, hai! Moon full
again. Something come in, lonely hut; claw um woman, claw um
pick'nin. Man find um claw up. Big Massa say 'leopard.' Full moon
again, and woodcutter find, heap clawed. Now come in castle. No
leopard. <i>But always footmarks of a man.</i>"</p>

<p>I gave a startled, incredulous exclamation.</p>

<p>It was true, Gola averred. Always the footprints of a man led
away from the scene of the murder. Then why did the natives not
tell the Big Massa that he might hunt down the fiend? Here Gola
assumed a crafty expression and whispered in my ear, "<i>The
footprints were of a man who wore shoes!</i>"</p>

<p>Even assuming that Gola was lying, I felt a thrill of
unexplainable horror. Who, then, did the natives believe was doing
these frightful murders?</p>

<p>And he answered: Dom Vincente!</p>

<p>By this time, <i>Messieurs</i>, my mind was in a whirl.</p>

<p>What was the meaning of all this? Who slew the German and sought
to ravish Marcita? And as I reviewed the crime, it appeared to me
that murder rather than rape was the object of the attack.</p>

<p>Why did de Montour warn us, and then appear to have knowledge of
the crime, telling us that Desmarte was innocent and then proving
it?</p>

<p>It was all beyond me.</p>

<p>The tale of the slaughter got among the natives, in spite of all
we could do, and they appeared restless and nervous, and thrice
that day Dom Vincente had a black lashed for insolence. A brooding
atmosphere pervaded the castle.</p>

<p>I considered going to Dom Vincente with Gola's tale, but decided
to wait awhile.</p>

<p>The women kept their chambers that day, the men were restless
and moody. Dom Vincente announced that the sentries would be
doubled and some would patrol the corridors of the castle itself. I
found myself musing cynically that if Gola's suspicions were true,
sentries would be of little good.</p>

<p>I am not, <i>Messieurs</i>, a man to brook such a situation with
patience. And I was young then. So as we drank before retiring, I
flung my goblet on the table and angrily announced that in spite of
man, beast or devil, I slept that night with doors flung wide. And
I tramped angrily to my chamber.</p>

<p>Again, as on the first night, de Montour came. And his face was
as a man who has looked into the gaping gates of hell.</p>

<p>"I have come," he said, "to ask you&mdash;nay, <i>Monsieur</i>,
to implore you to reconsider your rash determination."</p>

<p>I shook my head impatiently.</p>

<p>"You are resolved? Yes? Then I ask you do to this for me, that
after I enter my chamber, you will bolt my doors from the
outside."</p>

<p>I did as he asked, and then made my way back to my chamber, my
mind in a maze of wonderment. I had sent Gola to the slave
quarters, and I laid rapier and dagger close at hand. Nor did I go
to bed, but crouched in a great chair, in the darkness. Then I had
much ado to keep from sleeping. To keep myself awake, I fell to
musing on the strange words of de Montour. He seemed to be laboring
under great excitement; his eyes hinted of ghastly mysteries known
to him alone. And yet his face was not that of a wicked man.</p>

<p>Suddenly the notion took me to go to his chamber and talk with
him.</p>

<p>Walking those dark passages was a shuddersome task, but
eventually I stood before de Montour's door. I called softly.
Silence. I reached out a hand and felt splintered fragments of
wood. Hastily I struck flint and steel which I carried, and the
flaming tinder showed the great oaken door sagging on its mighty
hinges; showed a door smashed and splintered from the inside. And
the chamber of de Montour was unoccupied.</p>

<p>Some instinct prompted me to hurry back to my room, swiftly but
silently, shoeless feet treading softly. And as I neared the door,
I was aware of something in the darkness before me. Something which
crept in from a side corridor and glided stealthily along.</p>

<p>In a wild panic of fear I leaped, striking wildly and aimlessly
in the darkness. My clenched fist encountered a human head, and
something went down with a crash. Again I struck a light; a man lay
senseless on the floor, and he was de Montour.</p>

<p>I thrust a candle into a niche in the wall, and just then de
Montour's eyes opened and he rose uncertainly.</p>

<p>"You!" I exclaimed, hardly knowing what I said. "You, of all
men!"</p>

<p>He merely nodded.</p>

<p>"You killed von Schiller?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I recoiled with a gasp of horror.</p>

<p>"Listen." He raised his hand. "Take your rapier and run me
through. No man will touch you."</p>

<p>"No," I exclaimed. "I can not."</p>

<p>"Then, quick," he said hurriedly, "get into your chamber and
bolt the door. Haste! It will return!"</p>

<p>"What will return?" I asked, with a thrill of horror. "If it
will harm me, it will harm you. Come into the chamber with me."</p>

<p>"No, no!" he fairly shrieked, springing back from my
outstretched arm. "Haste, haste! It left me for an instant, but it
will return." Then in a low-pitched voice of indescribable horror:
"It is returning. <i>It is here now!</i>"</p>

<p>And I felt a <i>something</i>, a formless, shapeless presence
near. A thing of frightfulness.</p>

<p>De Montour was standing, legs braced, arms thrown back, fists
clenched. The muscles bulged beneath his skin, his eyes widened and
narrowed, the veins stood out upon his forehead as if in great
physical effort. As I looked, to my horror, out of nothing, a
shapeless, nameless <i>something</i> took vague form! Like a shadow
it moved upon de Montour.</p>

<p>It was hovering about him! Good God, it was merging, becoming
one with the man!</p>

<p>De Montour swayed; a great gasp escaped him. The dim thing
vanished. De Montour wavered. Then he turned toward me, and may God
grant that I never look on a face like that again!</p>

<p>It was a hideous, a bestial face. The eyes gleamed with a
frightful ferocity; the snarling lips were drawn back from gleaming
teeth, which to my startled gaze appeared more like bestial fangs
than human teeth.</p>

<p>Silently the <i>thing</i> (I can not call it a human) slunk
toward me. Gasping with horror I sprang back and through the door,
just as the <i>thing</i> launched itself through the air, with a
sinuous motion which even then made me think of a leaping wolf. I
slammed the door, holding it against the frightful <i>thing</i>
which hurled itself again and again against it.</p>

<p>Finally it desisted and I heard it slink stealthily off down the
corridor. Faint and exhausted I sat down, waiting, listening.
Through the open window wafted the breeze, bearing all the scents
of Africa, the spicy and the foul. From the native village came the
sound of a native drum. Other drums answered farther up the river
and back in the bush. Then from somewhere in the jungle, horridly
incongruous, sounded the long, high-pitched call of a timber wolf.
My soul revolted.</p>

<p>Dawn brought a tale of terrified villagers, of a Negro woman
torn by some fiend of the night, barely escaping. And to de Montour
I went.</p>

<p>On the way I met Dom Vincente. He was perplexed and angry.</p>

<p>"Some hellish thing is at work in this castle," he said. "Last
night, though I have said naught of it to anyone, something leaped
upon the back of one of the arquebusiers, tore the leather jerkin
from his shoulders and pursued him to the barbican. More, someone
locked de Montour into his room last night, and he was forced to
smash the door to get out."</p>

<p>He strode on, muttering to himself, and I proceeded down the
stairs, more puzzled than ever.</p>

<p>De Montour sat upon a stool, gazing out the window. An
indescribable air of weariness was about him.</p>

<p>His long hair was uncombed and tousled, his garments were
tattered. With a shudder I saw faint crimson stains upon his hands,
and noted that the nails were torn and broken.</p>

<p>He looked up as I came in, and waved me to a seat. His face was
worn and haggard, but was that of a man.</p>

<p>After a moment's silence, he spoke.</p>

<p>"I will tell you my strange tale. Never before has it passed my
lips, and why I tell you, knowing that you will not believe me, I
can not say."</p>

<p>And then I listened to what was surely the wildest, the most
fantastic, the weirdest tale ever heard by man.</p>

<p>"Years ago," said de Montour, "I was upon a military mission in
northern France. Alone, I was forced to pass through the
fiend-haunted woodlands of Villefere. In those frightful forests I
was beset by an inhuman, a ghastly <i>thing</i>&mdash;a werewolf.
Beneath a midnight moon we fought, and slew it. Now this is the
truth: that if a werewolf is slain in the half-form of a man, its
ghost will haunt its slayer through eternity. But if it is slain as
a wolf, hell gapes to receive it. The true werewolf is not (as many
think) a man who may take the form of a wolf, <i>but a wolf who
takes the form of a man!</i></p>

<p>"Now listen, my friend, and I will tell you of the wisdom, the
hellish knowledge that is mine, gained through many a frightful
deed, imparted to me amid the ghastly shadows of midnight forests
where fiends and half-beasts roamed.</p>

<p>"In the beginning, the world was strange, misshapen. Grotesque
beasts wandered through its jungles. Driven from another world,
ancient demons and fiends came in great numbers and settled upon
this newer, younger world. Long the forces of good and evil
warred.</p>

<p>"A strange beast, known as man, wandered among the other beasts,
and since good or bad must have a concrete form ere either
accomplishes its desire, the spirits of good entered man. The
fiends entered other beasts, reptiles and birds; and long and
fiercely waged the age-old battle. But man conquered. The great
dragons and serpents were slain and with them the demons. Finally,
Solomon, wise beyond the ken of man, made great war upon them, and
by virtue of his wisdom, slew, seized and bound. But there were
some which were the fiercest, the boldest, and though Solomon drove
them out he could not conquer them. Those had taken the form of
wolves. As the ages passed, wolf and demon became merged. No longer
could the fiend leave the body of the wolf at will. In many
instances, the savagery of the wolf overcame the subtlety of the
demon and enslaved him, so the wolf became again only a beast, a
fierce, cunning beast, but merely a beast. But of the werewolves,
there are many, even yet."</p>

<p>"And during the time of the full moon, the wolf may take the
form, or the half-form of a man. When the moon hovers at her
zenith, however, the wolf-spirit again takes ascendency and the
werewolf becomes a true wolf once more. But if it is slain in the
form of a man, then the spirit is free to haunt its slayer through
the ages."</p>

<p>"Harken now. I had thought to have slain the <i>thing</i> after
it had changed to its true shape. But I slew it an instant too
soon. The moon, though it approached the zenith, had not yet
reached it, nor had the <i>thing</i> taken on fully the
wolf-form."</p>

<p>"Of this I knew nothing and went my way. But when the next time
approached for the full moon, I began to be aware of a strange,
malicious influence. An atmosphere of horror hovered in the air and
I was aware of inexplicable, uncanny impulses.</p>

<p>"One night in a small village in the center of a great forest,
the influence came upon me with full power. It was night, and the
moon, nearly full, was rising over the forest. And between the moon
and me, I saw, floating in the upper air, ghostly and barely
discernible, <i>the outline of a wolf's head!</i></p>

<p>"I remember little of what happened thereafter. I remember,
dimly, clambering into the silent street, remember struggling,
resisting briefly, vainly, and the rest is a crimson maze, until I
came to myself the next morning and found my garments and hands
caked and stained crimson; and heard the horrified chattering of
the villagers, telling of a pair of clandestine lovers, slaughtered
in a ghastly manner, scarcely outside the village, torn to pieces
as if by wild beasts, as if by wolves.</p>

<p>"From that village I fled aghast, but I fled not alone. In the
day I could not feel the drive of my fearful captor, but when night
fell and the moon rose, I ranged the silent forest, a frightful
<i>thing</i>, a slayer of humans, a fiend in a man's body.</p>

<p>"God, the battles I have fought! But always it overcame me and
drove me ravening after some new victim. But after the moon had
passed its fullness, the <i>thing's</i> power over me ceased
suddenly. Nor did it return until three nights before the moon was
full again.</p>

<p>"Since then I have roamed the world&mdash;fleeing, fleeing,
seeking to escape. Always the <i>thing</i> follows, taking
possession of my body when the moon is full. Gods, the frightful
deeds I have done!</p>

<p>"I would have slain myself long ago, but I dare not. For the
soul of a suicide is accurst, and my soul would be forever hunted
through the flames of hell. And harken, most frightful of all, my
slain body would for ever roam the earth, moved and inhabited by
the soul of the werewolf! Can any thought be more ghastly?</p>

<p>"And I seem immune to the weapons of man. Swords have pierced
me, daggers have hacked me. I am covered with scars. Yet never have
they struck me down. In Germany they bound and led me to the block.
There would I have willingly placed my head, but the <i>thing</i>
came upon me, and breaking my bonds, I slew and fled. Up and down
the world I have wandered, leaving horror and slaughter in my
trail. Chains, cells can not hold me. The <i>thing</i> is fastened
to me through all eternity.</p>

<p>"In desperation I accepted Dom Vincente's invitation, for look
you, none knows of my frightful double life, since no one could
recognize me in the clutch of the demon; and few, seeing me, live
to tell of it.</p>

<p>"My hands are red, my soul doomed to everlasting flames, my mind
is torn with remorse for my crimes. And yet I can do nothing to
help myself. Surely, Pierre, no man ever knew the hell that I have
known.</p>

<p>"Yes, I slew von Schiller, and I sought, to destroy the girl
Marcita. Why I did not, I can not say, for I have slain both women
and men.</p>

<p>"Now, if you will, take your sword and slay me, and with my last
breath I will give you the good God's blessing. No?</p>

<p>"You know now my tale and you see before you a man,
fiend-haunted for all eternity."</p>

<p>My mind was spinning with wonderment as I left the room of de
Montour. What to do, I knew not. It seemed likely that he would yet
murder us all, and yet I could not bring myself to tell Dom
Vincente all. From the bottom of my soul I pitied de Montour.</p>

<p>So I kept my peace, and in the days that followed I made
occasion to seek him out and converse with him. A real friendship
sprang up between us.</p>

<p>About this time that black devil, Gola, began to wear an air of
suppressed excitement, as if he knew something he wished
desperately to tell, but would not or else dared not.</p>

<p>So the days passed in feasting, drinking and hunting, until one
night de Montour came to my chamber and pointed silently at the
moon which was just rising.</p>

<p>"Look ye," he said, "I have a plan. I will give it out that I am
going into the jungle for hunting and will go forth, apparently for
several days. But at night I will return to the castle, and you
must lock me into the dungeon which is used as a storeroom."</p>

<p>This we did, and I managed to slip down twice a day and carry
food and drink to my friend. He insisted on remaining in the
dungeon even in the day, for though the fiend had never exerted its
influence over him in the daytime, and he believed it powerless
then, yet he would take no chances.</p>

<p>It was during this time that I began to notice that Dom
Vincente's mink-faced cousin, Carlos, was forcing his attentions
upon Ysabel, who was his second cousin, and who seemed to resent
those attentions.</p>

<p>Myself, I would have challenged him for a duel for the toss of a
coin, for I despised him, but it was really none of my affair.
However, it seemed that Ysabel feared him.</p>

<p>My friend Luigi, by the way, had become enamored of the dainty
Portuguese girl, and was making swift love to her daily.</p>

<p>And de Montour sat in his cell and reviewed his ghastly deeds
until he battered the bars with his bare hands.</p>

<p>And Don Florenzo wandered about the castle grounds like a dour
Mephistopheles.</p>

<p>And the other guests rode and quarreled and drank.</p>

<p>And Gola slithered about, eyeing me if always on the point of
imparting momentous information. What wonder if my nerves became
rasped to the shrieking point?</p>

<p>Each day the natives grew surlier and more and more sullen and
intractable.</p>

<p>One night, not long before the full of the moon, I entered the
dungeon where de Montour sat.</p>

<p>He looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"You dare much, coming to me in the night."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders, seating myself.</p>

<p>A small barred window let in the night scents and sounds of
Africa.</p>

<p>"Hark to the native drums," I said. "For the past week they have
sounded almost incessantly."</p>

<p>De Montour assented.</p>

<p>"The natives are restless. Methinks 'tis deviltry they are
planning. Have you noticed that Carlos is much among them?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, "but 'tis like there will be a break between
him and Luigi. Luigi is paying court to Ysabel."</p>

<p>So we talked, when suddenly de Montour became silent and moody,
answering only in monosyllables.</p>

<p>The moon rose and peered in at the barred windows. De Montour's
face was illuminated by its beams.</p>

<p>And then the hand of horror grasped me. On the wall behind de
Montour appeared a shadow, a shadow clearly defined of a <i>wolf's
head</i>!</p>

<p>At the same instant de Montour felt its influence. With a shriek
he bounded from his stool.</p>

<p>He pointed fiercely, and as with trembling hands I slammed and
bolted the door behind me, I felt him hurl his weight against it.
As I fled up the stairway I heard a wild raving and battering at
the iron-bound door. But with all the werewolf's might the great
door held.</p>

<p>As I entered my room, Gola dashed in and gasped out the tale he
had been keeping for days.</p>

<p>I listened, incredulously, and then dashed forth to find Dom
Vincente.</p>

<p>I was told that Carlos had asked him to accompany him to the
village to arrange a sale of slaves.</p>

<p>My informer was Don Florenzo of Seville, and when I gave him a
brief outline of Gola's tale; he accompanied me.</p>

<p>Together we dashed through the castle gate, flinging a word to
the guards, and down the landing toward the village.</p>

<p>Dom Vincente, Dom Vincente, walk with care, keep sword loosened
in its sheath! Fool, fool, to walk in the night with Carlos, the
traitor!</p>

<p>They were nearing the village when we caught up with them. "Dom
Vincente!" I exclaimed; "return instantly to the castle. Carlos is
selling you into the hands of the natives! Gola has told me that he
lusts for your wealth and for Ysabel! A terrified native babbled to
him of booted footprints near the places where the woodcutters were
murdered, and Carlos has made the blacks believe that the slayer
was you! Tonight the natives were to rise and slay every man in the
castle except Carlos! Do you not believe me, Dom Vincente?"</p>

<p>"Is this the truth, Carlos?" asked Dom Vincente, in
amazement.</p>

<p>Carlos laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>"The fool speaks truth," he said, "but it accomplishes you
nothing. Ho!"</p>

<p>He shouted as he leaped for Dom Vincente. Steel flashed in the
moonlight and the Spaniard's sword was through Carlos ere he could
move.</p>

<p>And the shadows rose about us. Then it was back to back, sword
and dagger, three men against a hundred. Spears flashed, and a
fiendish yell went up from savage throats. I spitted three natives
in as many thrusts and then went down from a stunning swing from a
warclub, and an instant later Dom Vincente fell upon me, with a
spear in one arm and another through the leg. Don Florenzo was
standing above us, sword leaping like a live thing, when a charge
of the arquebusiers swept the river bank clear and we were borne
into the castle.</p>

<p>The black hordes came with a rush, spears flashing like a wave
of steel, a thunderous roar of savagery going up to the skies.</p>

<p>Time and again they swept up the slopes, bounding the moat,
until they were swarming over the palisades. And time and again the
fire of the hundred-odd defenders hurled them back.</p>

<p>They had set fire to the plundered warehouses, and their light
vied with the light of the moon. Just across the river there was a
larger storehouse, and about this hordes of the natives gathered,
tearing it apart for plunder.</p>

<p>"Would that they would drop a torch upon it," said Dom Vincente,
"for naught is stored therein save some thousand pounds of
gunpowder. I dared not store the treacherous stuff this side of the
river. All the tribes of the river and coast have gathered for our
slaughter and all my ships are upon the seas. We may hold out
awhile, but eventually they will swarm the palisade and put us to
the slaughter."</p>

<p>I hastened to the dungeon wherein de Montour sat. Outside the
door I called to him and he bade me enter in voice which told me
the fiend had left him for an instant.</p>

<p>"The blacks have risen," I told him.</p>

<p>"I guessed as much. How goes the battle?"</p>

<p>I gave him the details of the betrayal and the fight, and
mentioned the powder-house across the river. He sprang to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Now by my hag-ridden soul!" he exclaimed. "I will fling the
dice once more with hell! Swift, let me out of the castle! I will
essay to swim the river and set off yon powder!"</p>

<p>"It is insanity!" I exclaimed. "A thousand blacks lurk between
the palisades and the river, and thrice that number beyond! The
river itself swarms with crocodiles!"</p>

<p>"I will attempt it!" he answered, a great light in his face. "If
I can reach it, some thousand natives will lighten the siege; if I
am slain, then my soul is free and mayhap will gain some
forgiveness for that I gave my life to atone for my crimes."</p>

<p>Then, "Haste," he exclaimed, "for the demon is returning!
Already I feel his influence! Haste ye!"</p>

<p>For the castle gates we sped, and as de Montour ran he gasped as
a man in a terrific battle.</p>

<p>At the gate he pitched headlong, then rose, to spring through
it. Wild yells greeted him from the natives.</p>

<p>The arquebusiers shouted curses at him and at me. Peering down
from the top of the palisades I saw him turn from side to side
uncertainly. A score of natives were rushing recklessly forward,
spears raised.</p>

<p>Then the eerie wolf-yell rose to the skies, and de Montour
bounded forward. Aghast, the natives paused, and before a man of
them could move he was among them. Wild shrieks, not of rage, but
of terror.</p>

<p>In amazement the arquebusiers held their fire.</p>

<p>Straight through the group of blacks de Montour charged, and
when they broke and fled, three of them fled not.</p>

<p>A dozen steps de Montour took in pursuit; then stopped
stock-still. A moment he stood so while spears flew about him, then
turned and ran swiftly in the direction of the river.</p>

<p>A few steps from the river another band of blacks barred his
way. In the flaming light of the burning houses the scene was
clearly illuminated. A thrown spear tore through de Montour's
shoulder. Without pausing in his stride he tore it forth and drove
it through a native, leaping over his body to get among the
others.</p>

<p>They could not face the fiend-driven white man. With shrieks
they fled, and de Montour, bounding upon the back of one, brought
him down.</p>

<p>Then he rose, staggered and sprang to the river bank. An instant
he paused there and then vanished in the shadows.</p>

<p>"Name of the devil!" gasped Dom Vincente at my shoulder. "What
manner of man is that? Was that de Montour?"</p>

<p>I nodded. The wild yells of the natives rose above the crackle
of the arquebus fire. They were massed thick about the great
warehouse across the river.</p>

<p>"They plan a great rush," said Dom Vincente. "They will swarm
clear over the palisade, methinks. Ha!"</p>

<p>A crash that seemed to rip the skies apart! A burst of flame
that mounted to the stars! The castle rocked with the explosion.
Then silence, as the smoke, drifting away, showed only a great
crater where the warehouse had stood.</p>

<p>I could tell of how Dom Vincente led a charge, crippled as he
was, out of the castle gate and, down the slope, to fall upon the
terrified blacks who had escaped the explosion. I could tell of the
slaughter, of the victory and the pursuit of the fleeing
natives.</p>

<p>I could tell, too, <i>Messieurs</i>, of how I became separated
from the band and of how I wandered far into the jungle, unable to
find my way back to the coast.</p>

<p>I could tell how I was captured by a wandering band of slave
raiders, and of how I escaped. But such is not my intention. In
itself it would make a long tale; and it is of de Montour that I am
speaking.</p>

<p>I thought much of the things that had passed and wondered if
indeed de Montour reached the storehouse to blow it to the skies or
whether it was but the deed of chance.</p>

<p>That a man could swim that reptile-swarming river, fiend-driven
though he was, seemed impossible. And if he blew up the storehouse,
he must have gone up with it.</p>

<p>So one night I pushed my way wearily through the jungle and
sighted the coast, and close to the shore a small, tumbledown hut
of thatch. To it I went, thinking to sleep therein if insects and
reptiles would allow.</p>

<p>I entered the doorway and then stopped short. Upon a makeshift
stool sat a man. He looked up as I entered and the rays of the moon
fell across his face.</p>

<p>I started back with a ghastly thrill of horror. <i>It was de
Montour, and the moon was full!</i></p>

<p>Then as I stood, unable to flee, he rose and came toward me. And
his face, though haggard as of a man who has looked into hell, was
the face of a sane man.</p>

<p>"Come in, my friend," he said, and there was a great peace in
his voice. "Come in and fear me not. The fiend has left me
forever."</p>

<p>"But tell me, how conquered you?" I exclaimed as I grasped his
hand.</p>

<p>"I fought a frightful battle, as I ran to the river," he
answered, "for the fiend had me in its grasp and drove me to fall
upon the natives. But for the first, time my soul and mind gained
ascendency for an instant, an instant just long enough to hold me
to my purpose. And I believe the good saints came to my aid, for I
was giving my life to save life.</p>

<p>"I leaped into the river and swam, and in an instant the
crocodiles were swarming about me.</p>

<p>"Again in the clutch of the fiend I fought them, there in the
river. Then suddenly the <i>thing</i> left me.</p>

<p>"I climbed from the river and fired the warehouse. The explosion
hurled me hundreds of feet, and for days I wandered witless through
the jungle."</p>

<p>"But the full moon came, and came again, and I felt not the
influence of the fiend.</p>

<p>"I am free, free!" And a wondrous note of exultation, nay,
<i>exaltation</i>, thrilled his words:</p>

<p>"My soul is free. Incredible as it seems, the demon lies drowned
upon the bed of the river, or else inhabits the body of one of the
savage reptiles that swim the ways of the Niger."</p>
