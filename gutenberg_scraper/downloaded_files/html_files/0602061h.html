<p class="first">"CAN these bones live?"</p>

<p>Could anything be more dead, more mute and inexpressive
to the inexpert eye than the ochreous fragments of bone
and the fractured lumps of flint that constitute the first
traces of something human in the world? We see them in the
museum cases, sorted out in accordance with principles we
do not understand, labelled with strange names. Chellean,
Mousterian, Solutrian and the like, taken mostly from the
places Chelles, La Moustier, Solutre, and so forth where
the first specimens were found. Most of us stare through
the glass at them, wonder vaguely for a moment at that
half-savage, half-animal past of our race, and pass on.
"Primitive man," we say. "Flint implements. The mammoth
used to chase him." Few of us realize yet how much the
subtle indefatigable cross-examination of the scientific
worker has been extracting from the evidence of these rusty
and obstinate witnesses during the last few years.</p>

<p>One of the most startling results of this recent work
is the gradual realisation that great quantities of these
flint implements and some of the earlier fragments of bone
that used to be ascribed to humanity are the vestiges of
creatures, very manlike in many respects, but not, strictly
speaking, belonging to the human species. Scientific men
call these vanished races man (<i>Homo</i>), just as they call
lions and tigers cats (<i>Felis</i>), but there are the soundest
reasons for believing that these earlier so-called men
were not of our blood, not our ancestors, but a strange
and vanished animal, like us, akin to us, but different
from us, as the mammoth was like, and akin to, and yet
different from, the elephant. Flint and bone implements
are found in deposits of very considerable antiquity; some
in our museums may be a million years old or more, but the
traces of really human creatures, mentally and anatomically
like ourselves, do not go back much earlier than twenty
or thirty thousand years ago. True men appeared in Europe
then, and we do not know whence they came. These other
tool-using, fire-making animals, the things that were like
men and yet were not men, passed away before the faces of
the true men.</p>

<p>Scientific authorities already distinguish four species
of these pseudo-men, and it is probable that we shall learn
from time to time of other species. One strange breed
made the implements called Chellean. These are chiefly
sole-shaped blades of stone found in deposits of perhaps
300,000 or 400,000 years ago. Chellean implements are to
be seen in any great museum. They are huge implements,
<i>four or five times as big as those made by any known race
of true men</i>, and they are not ill made. Certainly some
creature with an intelligent brain made them. Big clumsy
hands must have gripped and used these rocky chunks. But
so far only one small fragment of a skeleton of this age
has been found, a very massive chinless lower jawbone, with
teeth rather <i>more</i> specialised than those of men to-day.
We can only guess what strange foreshadowing of the human
form once ate with that jaw, and struck at its enemies with
those big but not unhandy flint blades. It may have been a
tremendous fellow, probably much bigger in the body than
a man. It may have been able to take bears by the scruff
and the sabre-toothed lion by the throat. We do not know.
We have just these great stone blades and that bit of a
massive jaw and&mdash;the liberty to wonder.</p>

<p>Most fascinating riddle of all these riddles of the ages
of ice and hardship, before the coming of the true men, is
the riddle of the Mousterian men, because they were perhaps
still living in the world when the true men came wandering
into Europe. They lived much later than those unknown
Chellean giants. They lived thirty or forty thousand years
ago&mdash;a yesterday compared with the Chellean time.
These Mousterians are also called Neandertalers. Until
quite recently it was supposed that they were true men
like ourselves. But now we begin to realise that they were
different, so different that it is impossible that they can
be very close relations of ours. They walked or shambled
along with a peculiar slouch, they could not turn their
heads up to the sky, and their teeth were very different
from those of true men. One oddity about them is that in
one or two points they were less like apes than we are. The
dog tooth, the third tooth from the middle, which is so big
in the gorilla, and which in man is pointed and still quite
distinct from the other teeth, is not distinct at all in
the Neandertaler. He had a very even row of teeth, and his
cheek teeth also were very unlike ours, and less like the
apes' than ours. He had more face and less brow than true
men, but that is not because he had a lesser brain; his
brain was as big as a modern man's but it was different,
bigger behind and smaller in front, so that probably he
thought and behaved differently from us. Perhaps he had a
better memory and less reasoning power than real men, or
perhaps he had more nervous energy and less intelligence.
He had no chin, and the way his jawbones come together
below make it very doubtful if he could have used any such
sounds in speech as we employ. Probably he did not talk at
all. He could not hold a pin between his finger and thumb.
The more we learn about this beast-man the stranger he
becomes to us and the less like the Australoid savage he
was once supposed to be.</p>

<p>And as we realise the want of any close relationship
between this ugly, strong, ungainly, manlike animal and
mankind, the less likely it becomes that he had a naked
skin and hair like ours and the more probable that he
was different and perhaps bristly or hairy in some queer
inhuman fashion like the hairy elephant and the woolly
rhinoceros who were his contemporaries. Like them he lived
in a bleak land on the edge of the snows and glaciers that
were even then receding northward. Hairy or grisly, with a
big face like a mask, great brow ridges and no forehead,
clutching an enormous flint, and running like a baboon with
his head forward and not, like a man, with his head up, he
must have been a fearsome creature for our forefathers to
come upon.</p>

<p>Almost certainly they met, these grisly men and the true
men. The true man must have come into the habitat of the
Neandertaler, and the two must have met and fought. Some
day we may come upon the evidences of this warfare.</p>

<p>Western Europe, which is the only part of the world
that has yet been searched with any thoroughness for the
remains of early men, was slowly growing warmer age by
age; the glaciers that had once covered half the continent
were receding, and wide stretches of summer pasture and
thin woods of pine and birch were spreading slowly over
the once icy land. South Europe then was like northern
Labrador to-day. A few hardy beasts held out amidst the
snows; the bears hibernated. With the spring grass and
foliage came great herds of reindeer, wild horses, mammoth,
elephant, and rhinoceros, drifting northward from the
slopes of the great warm valley that is now filled up with
water&mdash;the Mediterranean Sea. It was in those days
before the ocean waters broke into the Mediterranean that
the swallows and a multitude of other birds acquired the
habit of coming north, a habit that nowadays impels them to
brave the passage of the perilous seas that flow over and
hide the lost secrets of the ancient Mediterranean valleys.
The grisly men rejoiced at the return of life, came out of
the caves in which they had lurked during the winter, and
took their toll of the beasts.</p>

<p>These grisly men must have been almost solitary
creatures.</p>

<p>The winter food was too scanty for communities. A male
may have gone with a female or so; perhaps they parted in
the winter and came together in the summer; when his sons
grew big enough to annoy him, the grisly man killed them or
drove them off. If he killed them he may have eaten them.
If they escaped him they may have returned to kill him. The
grisly folk may have had long unreasoning memories and very
set purposes.</p>

<p>The true men came into Europe, we know not whence,
out of the South. When they appeared in Europe their
hands were as clever as ours; they could draw pictures we
still admire, they could paint and carve; the implements
they made were smaller than the Mousterian ones, far
smaller than the Chellean, but better made and more
various. They wore no clothes worth speaking of, but they
painted themselves and probably they talked. And they
came in little bands. They were already more social than
the Neandertaler; they had laws and self-restraints;
their minds had travelled a long way along that path of
adaptation and self-suppression which has led to the
intricate mind of man to-day with its concealed wishes, its
confusions, and laughter and the fantasies and reveries and
dreams. They were already held together, these men, and
kept in order by the strange limitations of tabu.</p>

<p>They were still savages, very prone to violence and
convulsive in their lusts and desires; but to the best of
their poor ability they obeyed laws and customs already
immemorably ancient, and they feared the penalties of
wrong-doing. We can understand something of what was going
on in their minds, those of us who can remember the fears,
desires, fancies and superstitions of our childhood. Their
moral struggles were ours&mdash;in cruder forms. They
were our kind. But the grisly folk we cannot begin to
understand. We cannot conceive in our different minds the
strange ideas that chased one another through those queerly
shaped brains. As well might we try to dream and feel as a
gorilla dreams and feels.</p>

<p>We can understand how the true men drifted northward
from the lost lands of the Mediterranean valley into the
high Spanish valleys and the south and centre of France,
and so on to what is now England&mdash;for there was no
Channel then between England and France&mdash;and eastward
to the Rhineland and over the broad wilderness which is now
the North Sea, and the German plain. They would leave the
snowy wilderness of the Alps, far higher then and covered
with great glaciers, away on their right. These people
drifted northward for the very good reason that their
kind was multiplying and food diminishing. They would be
oppressed by feuds and wars. They had no settled homes;
they were accustomed to drift with the seasons, every now
and then some band would be pushed by hunger and fear a
little farther northward into the unknown.</p>

<p>We can imagine the appearance of a little group of these
wanderers, our ancestors, coming over some grassy crest
into these northern lands. The time would be late spring or
early summer, and they would probably be following up some
grazing beasts, a reindeer herd or horses.</p>

<p>By a score of different means our anthropologists have
been able to reconstruct the particulars of the appearance
and habits of these early pilgrim fathers of mankind.</p>

<p>They would not be a very numerous band, because if they
were there would be no reason why they should have been
driven northward out of their former roving grounds. Two
or three older men of thirty or so, eight or ten women
and girls with a few young children, a few lads between
fourteen and twenty, might make up the whole community.
They would be a brownish brown-eyed people with wavy
dark hair; the fairness of the European and the straight
blue-black hair of the Chinaman had still to be evolved
in the world. The older men would probably lead the band,
the women and children would keep apart from the youths
and men, fenced off by complex and definite tabus from any
close companionship. The leaders would be tracking the
herd they were following. Tracking was then the supreme
accomplishment of mankind. By signs and traces that would
be invisible to any modern civilised eye, they would be
reading the story of the previous day's trek of the herd of
sturdy little horses ahead of them. They would be so expert
that they would go on from one fault sign to another with
as little delay as a dog who follows a scent.</p>

<p>The horses they were following were only a little way
ahead&mdash;so the trackers read the signs&mdash;they were
numerous and nothing had alarmed them. They were grazing
and moving only very slowly. There were no traces of wild
dog or other animals to stampede them. Some elephants were
also going north, and twice our human tribe had crossed the
spoor of woolly rhinoceros roaming westward.</p>

<p>The tribe travelled light. They were mainly naked, but
all of them were painted with white and black and red and
yellow ochre. At this distance of time it is difficult to
see whether they were tattooed. Probably they were not.
The babies and small children were carried by the women on
their backs in slings or bags made of animal skins, and
perhaps some or all of them wore mantles and loin bands
of skin and had pouches and belts of leather. The men had
stone-pointed spears, and carried sharpened flints in their
hands.</p>

<p>There was no Old Man who was lord and master and father
of this particular crowd. Weeks ago the Old Man had been
charged and trampled to a jelly by a great bull in the
swamp far away. Then two of the girls had been waylaid
and carried off by the young men of another larger tribe.
It was because of these losses that this remnant was now
seeking new hunting grounds.</p>

<p>The landscape that spread before the eyes of this little
band as they crested the hills was a bleaker, more desolate
and altogether unkempt version of the landscape of western
Europe to-day. About them was a grassy down athwart which a
peewit flew with its melancholy cry. Before them stretched
a great valley ridged with transverse purple hills over
which the April cloud-shadows chased one another. Pinewoods
and black heather showed where these hills became sandy,
and the valleys were full of brown brushwood, and down
their undrained troughs ran a bright green band of peaty
swamps and long pools of weedy water. In the valley
thickets many beasts lurked unseen, and where the winding
streams had cut into the soil there were cliffs and caves.
Far away along the northern slopes of the ridge that were
now revealed, the wild ponies were to be seen grazing.</p>

<p>At a sign from the two leaders the little straggle of
menfolk halted, and a woman who had been chattering in
subdued tones to a little girl became silent. The brothers
surveyed the wide prospect earnestly.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" said one abruptly and pointed.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" cried his brother.</p>

<p>The eyes of the whole tribe swung round to the pointing
finger.</p>

<p>The group became one rigid stare.</p>

<p>Every soul of them stood still, astonishment had turned
them into a tense group of statuettes.</p>

<p>Far away down the slope with his body in profile and his
head turned towards them, frozen by an equal amazement,
stood a hunched grey figure, bigger but shorter than a man.
He had been creeping up behind a fold in the ground to peer
at the ponies, and suddenly he had turned his eyes and seen
the tribe. His head projected like a baboon's. In his hand
he carried what seemed to the menfolk a great rock.</p>

<p>For a little while this animal scrutiny held discoverers
and discovered motionless. Then some of the women and
children began to stir and line out to see the strange
creature better. "Man!" said an old crone of forty.
"<i>Man!</i>" At the movement of the women the grisly man
turned, ran clumsily for a score of yards or so towards
a thicket of birch and budding thorn. Then he halted
again for a moment to look at the newcomers, waved an arm
strangely, and then dashed into cover.</p>

<p>The shadows of the thicket swallowed him up, and by
hiding him seemed to make him enormous. It identified
itself with him, and watched them with his eyes. Its
tree stems became long silvery limbs, and a fallen trunk
crouched and stared.</p>

<p>It was still early in the morning, and the leaders of
the tribe had hoped to come up with the wild ponies as the
day advanced and perhaps cut one off and drive it into
difficulties among the bushes and swampy places below, and
wound it and follow it up and kill it. Then they would have
made a feast, and somewhere down in the valley they would
have found water and dry bracken for litter and a fire
before night. It had seemed a pleasant and hopeful morning
to them until this moment. Now they were disconcerted. This
grey figure was as if the sunny morning had suddenly made a
horrible and inexplicable grimace.</p>

<p>The whole expedition stood gazing for a time, and then
the two leaders exchanged a few words. Waugh, the elder,
pointed. Click, his brother, nodded his head. They would
go on, but instead of slanting down the slopes towards the
thickets they would keep round the ridge.</p>

<p>"Come," said Waugh, and the little band began to move
again. But now it marched in silence. When presently a
little boy began a question his mother silenced him by a
threat. Everybody kept glancing at the thickets below.</p>

<p>Presently a girl cried out sharply and pointed. All
started and stopped short.</p>

<p>There was the grisly thing again. It was running across
an open space, running almost on all fours, in joltering
leaps. It was hunchbacked and very big and low, a grey
hairy wolf-like monster. At times its long arms nearly
touched the ground. It was nearer than it had been before.
It vanished amidst the bushes again. It seemed to throw
itself down among some red dead bracken....</p>

<p>Waugh and Click took counsel.</p>

<p>A mile away was the head of the valley where the
thickets had their beginning. Beyond stretched the woldy
hills, bare of cover. The horses were grazing up towards
the sun, and away to the north the backs of a herd of
woolly rhinoceros were now visible on a crest&mdash;just
the ridges of their backs showing like a string of black
beads.</p>

<p>If the tribe struck across those grassy spaces, then the
lurking prowler would have either to stay behind or come
into the open. If he came into the open the dozen youths
and men of the tribe would know how to deal with him.</p>

<p>So they struck across the grass. The little band worked
round to the head of the valley, and there the menfolk
stayed at the crest while the women and children pushed on
ahead across the open.</p>

<p>For a time the watchers remained motionless, and then
Waugh was moved to gestures of defiance. Click was not to
be outdone. There were shouts at the hidden watcher, and
then one lad, who was something of a clown, after certain
grimaces and unpleasant gestures, obliged with an excellent
imitation of the grey thing's lumbering run. At that scare
gave place to hilarity.</p>

<p>In those days laughter was a social embrace. Men could
laugh, but there was no laughter in the grisly pre-man who
watched and wondered in the shadow. He marvelled. The men
rolled about and guffawed and slapped their thighs and one
another. Tears ran down their faces.</p>

<p>Never a sign came from the thickets.</p>

<p>"Yahah," said the menfolk. "Yahah! Bzzzz. Yahah!
Yah!"</p>

<p>They forgot altogether how frightened they had been.</p>

<p>And when Waugh thought the women and children had gone
on a sufficient distance, he gave the word for the men to
follow them.</p>

<p>In such fashion it was that men, our ancestors, had
their first glimpse of the pre-men of the wilderness of
western Europe....</p>

<p>The two breeds were soon to come to closer quarters.</p>

<p>The newcomers were pushing their way into the country of
these grisly men. Presently came other glimpses of lurking
semi-human shapes and grey forms that ran in the twilight.
In the morning Click found long narrow footprints round the
camp....</p>

<p>Then one day one of the children, eating those little
green thorn-buds that rustic English children speak of
as bread and cheese, ventured too far from the others.
There was a squeal and a scuffle and a thud, and something
grey and hairy made off through the thickets carrying its
victim, with Waugh and three of the younger men in hot
pursuit. They chased the enemy into a dark gully, very much
overgrown. This time it was not a solitary Neandertaler
they had to deal with. Out of the bushes a big male came at
them to cover the retreat of his mate, and hurled a rock
that bowled over the youth it hit like a nine-pin, so that
thereafter he limped always. But Waugh with his throwing
spear got the grey monster in the shoulder, and he halted
snarling.</p>

<p>No further sound came from the stolen child.</p>

<p>The female showed herself for a moment up the gully,
snarling, bloodstained, and horrible, and the menfolk stood
about afraid to continue their pursuit, and yet not caring
to desist from it. One of them was already hobbling off
with his hand to his knee.</p>

<p>How did that first fight go?</p>

<p>Perhaps it went against the men of our race. Perhaps
the big Neandertaler male, his mane and beard bristling
horribly, came down the gully with a thunderous roar, with
a great rock in either hand. We do not know whether he
threw those big discs of flint or whether he smote with
them. Perhaps it was then that Waugh was killed in the act
of running away. Perhaps it was bleak disaster then for the
little tribe. Short of two of its members it presently made
off over the hills as fast as it could go, keeping together
for safety, and leaving the wounded youth far behind to
limp along its tracks in lonely terror.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that he got back to the tribe at
last&mdash;after nightmare hours.</p>

<p>Now that Waugh had gone, Click would become Old Man,
and he made the tribe camp that night and build their fire
on the high ridges among the heather far away from the
thickets in which the grisly folk might be lurking.</p>

<p>The grisly folk thought we knew not how about the
menfolk, and the men thought about the grisly folk in
such ways as we can understand; they imagined how their
enemies might act in this fashion or that, and schemed to
circumvent them. It may have been Click who had the first
dim idea of getting at the gorge in which the Neandertalers
had their lair, from above. For as we have said, the
Neandertaler did not look up. Then the menfolk could roll a
great rock upon him or pelt him with burning brands and set
the dry bracken alight.</p>

<p>One likes to think of a victory for the human side. This
Click we have conjured up had run in panic from the first
onset of the grisly male, but as he brooded by the fire
that night, he heard again in imagination the cry of the
lost girl, and he was filled with rage. In his sleep the
grisly male came to him and Click fought in his dreams and
started awake stiff with fury. There was a fascination for
him in that gorge in which Waugh had been killed. He was
compelled to go back and look again for the grisly beasts,
to waylay them in their tracks, and watch them from an
ambush. He perceived that the Neandertalers could not climb
as easily as the menfolk could climb, nor hear so quickly,
nor dodge with the same unexpectedness. These grisly men
were to be dealt with as the bears were dealt with, the
bears before whom you run and scatter, and then come at
again from behind.</p>

<p>But one may doubt if the first human group to come into
the grisly land was clever enough to solve the problems of
the new warfare. Maybe they turned southward again to the
gentler regions from which they had come, and were killed
by or mingled with their own brethren again. Maybe they
perished altogether in that new land of the grisly folk
into which they had intruded. Yet the truth may be that
they even held their own and increased. If they died there
were others of their kind to follow them and achieve a
better fate.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of a nightmare age for the
little children of the human tribe. They knew they were
watched.</p>

<p>Their steps were dogged. The legends of ogres and
man-eating giants that haunt the childhood of the world may
descend to us from those ancient days of fear. And for the
Neandertalers it was the beginning of an incessant war that
could end only in extermination.</p>

<p>The Neandertalers, albeit not so erect and tall as men,
were the heavier, stronger creatures, but they were stupid,
and they went alone or in twos and threes; the menfolk
were swifter, quicker-witted, and more social&mdash;when
they fought they fought in combination. They lined out and
surrounded and pestered and pelted their antagonists from
every side. They fought the men of that grisly race as dogs
might fight a bear. They shouted to one another what each
should do, and the Neandertaler had no speech; he did not
understand. They moved too quickly for him and fought too
cunningly.</p>

<p>Many and obstinate were the duels and battles these two
sorts of men fought for this world in that bleak age of
the windy steppes, thirty or forty thousand years ago. The
two races were intolerable to each other. They both wanted
the caves and the banks by the rivers where the big flints
were got. They fought over the dead mammoths that had been
bogged in the marshes, and over the reindeer stags that had
been killed in the rutting season. When a human tribe found
signs of the grisly folk near their cave and squatting
place, they had perforce to track them down and kill them;
their own safety and the safety of their little ones was
only to be secured by that killing. The Neandertalers
thought the little children of men fair game and pleasant
eating.</p>

<p>How long the grisly folk lived on in that chill world
of pines and silver birch between the steppes and the
glaciers, after the true menfolk came, we do not know.
For ages they may have held out, growing more cunning and
dangerous as they became rare. The true men hunted them
down by their spoor and by their tracks, and watched for
the smoke of their fires, and made food scarce for them.</p>

<p>Great Paladins arose in that forgotten world, men who
stood forth and smote the grey man-beast face to face
and slew him. They made long spears of wood, hardened by
fire at the tips; they raised shields of skin against his
mighty blows. They struck at him with stones on cords,
and slung them at him with slings. And it was not simply
men who withstood the grisly beast but women. They stood
over their children; they stood by their men against this
eerie thing that was like and yet not like mankind. Unless
the <i>savants</i> read all the signs awry, it was the women
who were the makers of the larger tribes into which human
families were already growing in those ancient times. It
was the woman's subtle, love-guided wits which protected
her sons from the fierce anger of the Old Man, and taught
them to avoid his jealousy and wrath, and persuaded him to
tolerate them and so have their help against the grisly
enemy. It was woman, says Atkinson, in the beginning of
things human, who taught the primary tabus, that a son must
go aside out of the way of his stepmother, and get himself
a wife from another tribe, so as to keep the peace within
the family. She came between the fratricides, and was the
first peacemaker. Human societies in their beginnings
were her work, done against the greater solitariness, the
lonely fierceness of the adult male. Through her, men
learnt the primary co-operation of sonship and brotherhood.
The grisly folk had not learnt even the rudest elements
of co-operation, and mankind had already spelt out the
alphabet of a unity that may some day comprehend the whole
earth. The menfolk kept together by the dozen and by the
score. By ones and twos and threes therefore the grisly
folk were beset and slain, until there were no more of them
left in the world.</p>

<p>Generation after generation, age after age, that long
struggle for existence went on between these men who were
not quite men and the men, our ancestors, who came out of
the south into western Europe. Thousands of fights and
hunts, sudden murders and headlong escapes there were
amidst the caves and thickets of that chill and windy world
between the last age of glaciers and our own warmer time.
Until at length the last poor grisly was brought to bay and
faced the spears of his pursuers in anger and despair.</p>

<p>What leapings of the heart were there not throughout
that long warfare! What moments of terror and triumph!
What acts of devotion and desperate wonders of courage!
And the strain of the victors was our strain; we are
lineally identical with those sun-brown painted beings
who ran and fought and helped one another, the blood in
our veins glowed in those fights and chilled in those
fears of the forgotten past. For it was forgotten. Except
perhaps for some vague terrors in our dreaming life and
for some lurking element of tradition in the legends and
warnings of the nursery, it has gone altogether out of the
memory of our race. But nothing is ever completely lost.
Seventy or eighty years ago a few curious <i>savants</i> began
to suspect that there were hidden memories in certain big
chipped flints and scraps of bone they found in ancient
gravels. Much more recently others have begun to find hints
of remote strange experiences in the dreams and odd kinks
in modern minds. By degrees these dry bones begin to live
again.</p>

<p>This restoration of the past is one of the most
astonishing adventures of the human mind. As humanity
follows the gropings of scientific men among these ancient
vestiges, it is like a man who turns over the yellow pages
of some long-forgotten diary, some engagement book of his
adolescence. His dead youth lives again. Once more the old
excitements stir him, the old happiness returns. But the
old passions that once burnt, only warm him now, and the
old fears and distresses signify nothing.</p>

<p>A day may come when these recovered memories may grow
as if we in our own persons had been there and shared the
thrill and the fear of those primordial days; a day may
come when the great beasts of the past will leap to life
again in our imaginations, when we shall walk again in
vanished scenes, stretch painted limbs we thought were
dust, and feel again the sunshine of a million years
ago.</p>
