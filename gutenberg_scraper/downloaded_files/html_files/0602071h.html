<h1>The Thames Valley Catastrophe</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Grant Allen</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>It can scarcely be necessary for me to mention, I suppose, at this
time of day, that I was one of the earliest and fullest observers of
the sad series of events which finally brought about the transference
of the seat of Government of these islands from London to Manchester.
Nor need I allude here to the conspicuous position which my narrative
naturally occupies in the Blue-book on the Thames Valley Catastrophe
(vol. ii., part vii), ordered by Parliament in its preliminary
Session under the new regime at Birmingham. But I think it also
incumbent upon me, for the benefit of posterity, to supplement that
necessarily dry and formal statement by a more circumstantial account
of my personal adventures during the terrible period.</p>

<p>I am aware, of course, that my poor little story can possess
little interest for our contemporaries, wearied out as they are with
details of the disaster, and surfeited with tedious scientific
discussions as to its origin and nature. But in after years, I
venture to believe, when the crowning calamity of the nineteenth
century has grown picturesque and, so to speak, ivy-clad, by reason
of its remoteness (like the Great Plague or the Great Fire of London
with ourselves), the world may possibly desire to hear how this
unparalleled convulsion affected the feelings and fortunes of a
single family in the middle rank of life, and in a part of London
neither squalid nor fashionable.</p>

<p>It is such personal touches of human nature that give reality to
history, which without them must become, as a great writer has finely
said, nothing more than an old almanac. I shall not apologize,
therefore, for being frankly egoistic and domestic in my
reminiscences of that appalling day: for I know that those who desire
to seek scientific information on the subject will look for it, not
in vain, in the eight bulky volumes of the recent Blue-book. I shall
concern myself here with the great event merely as it appeared to
myself, a Government servant of the second grade, and in its
relations to my own wife, my home, and my children.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 21st of August, in the memorable year of the
calamity, I happened to be at Cookham, a pleasant and pretty village
which then occupied the western bank of the Thames just below the
spot where the Look-out Tower of the Earthquake and Eruption
Department now dominates the whole wide plain of the Glassy Rock
Desert. In place of the black lake of basalt which young people see
nowadays winding its solid bays in and out among the grassy downs,
most men still living can well remember a gracious and smiling
valley, threaded in the midst by a beautiful river.</p>

<p>I had cycled down from London the evening before (thus
forestalling my holiday), and had spent the night at a tolerable inn
in the village. By a curious coincidence, the only other visitor at
the little hotel that night was a fellow-cyclist, an American, George
W. Ward by name, who had come over with his "wheel," as he called it,
for six weeks in England, in order to investigate the geology of our
southern counties for himself, and to compare it with that of the far
western cretaceous system. I venture to describe this as a curious
coincidence, because, as it happened, the mere accident of my meeting
him gave me my first inkling of the very existence of that singular
phenomenon of which we were all so soon to receive a startling
example. I had never so much as heard before of fissure-eruptions;
and if I had not heard of them from Ward that evening, I might not
have recognised at sight the actuality when it first appeared, and
therefore I might have been involved in the general disaster. In
which case, of course, this unpretentious narrative would never have
been written.</p>

<p>As we sat in the little parlour of the White Hart, however, over
our evening pipe, it chanced that the American, who was a pleasant,
conversable fellow, began talking to me of his reasons for visiting
England. I was at that time a clerk in the General Post Office (of
which I am now secretary), and was then no student of science; but
his enthusiastic talk about his own country and its vastness amused
and interested me. He had been employed for some years on the
Geological Survey in the Western States, and he was deeply impressed
by the solemnity and the colossal scale of everything American.
"Mountains!" he said, when I spoke of Scotland; "why, for mountains,
your Alps aren't in it! and as for volcanoes, your Vesuviuses and
Etnas just spit fire a bit at infrequent intervals; while ours do
things on a scale worthy of a great country, I can tell you. Europe
is a circumstance: America is a continent."</p>

<p>"But surely," I objected, "that was a pretty fair eruption that
destroyed Pompeii!"</p>

<p>The American rose and surveyed me slowly. I can see him to this
day, with his close-shaven face and his contemptuous smile at my
European ignorance. "Well," he said, after a long and impressive
pause, "the lava-flood that destroyed a few acres about the Bay of
Naples was what we call a trickle: it came from a crater; and the
crater it came from was nothing more than a small round vent-hole;
the lava flowed down from it in a moderate stream over a limited
area. But what do you say to the earth opening in a huge crack, forty
or fifty miles long--say, as far as from here right away to London,
or farther--and lava pouring out from the orifice, not in a little
rivulet as at Etna or Vesuvius, but in a sea or inundation, which
spread at once over a tract as big as England? That's something like
volcanic action, isn't it? And that's the sort of thing we have out
in Colorado."</p>

<p>"You are joking," I replied, "or bragging. You are trying to
astonish me with the familiar spread eagle."</p>

<p>He smiled a quiet smile. "Not a bit of it," he answered. "What I
tell you is at least as true as Gospel. The earth yawns in Montana.
There are fissure-eruptions, as we call them, in the Western States,
out of which the lava has welled like wine out of a broken
skin--welled up in vast roaring floods, molten torrents of basalt,
many miles across, and spread like water over whole plains and
valleys."</p>

<p>"Not within historical times!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about that," he answered, musing. "I grant you,
not within times which are historical right there--for Colorado is a
very new country: but I incline to think some of the most recent
fissure eruptions took place not later than when the Tudors reigned
in England. The lava oozed out, red-hot--gushed out--was squeezed
out--and spread instantly everywhere; it's so comparatively recent
that the surface of the rock is still bare in many parts, unweathered
sufficiently to support vegetation. I fancy the stream must have been
ejected at a single burst, in a huge white-hot dome, and then flowed
down on every side, filling up the valleys to a certain level, in and
out among the hills, exactly as water might do. And some of these
eruptions, I tell you, by measured survey, would have covered more
ground than from Dover to Liverpool, and from York to Cornwall."</p>

<p>"Let us be thankful," I said, carelessly, "that such things don't
happen in our own times."</p>

<p>He eyed me curiously. "Haven't happened, you mean," he answered.
"We have no security that they mayn't happen again to-morrow. These
fissure-eruptions, though not historically described for us, are
common events in geological history--commoner and on a larger scale
in America than elsewhere. Still, they have occurred in all lands and
at various epochs; there is no reason at all why one shouldn't occur
in England at present."</p>

<p>I laughed, and shook my head. I had the Englishman's firm
conviction--so rudely shattered by the subsequent events, but then so
universal--that nothing very unusual ever happened in England.</p>

<p>Next morning I rose early, bathed in Odney Weir (a picturesque
pool close by), breakfasted with the American, and then wrote a hasty
line to my wife, informing her that I should probably sleep that
night at Oxford; for I was off on a few days' holiday, and I liked
Ethel to know where a letter or telegram would reach me each day, as
we were both a little anxious about the baby's teething. Even while I
pen these words now, the grim humour of the situation comes back to
me vividly. Thousands of fathers and mothers were anxious that
morning about similar trifles, whose pettiness was brought home to
them with an appalling shock in the all-embracing horror of that
day's calamity.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock I inflated my tyres and got under way. I meant
to ride towards Oxford by a leisurely and circuitous route, along the
windings of the river, past Marlow and Henley; so I began by crossing
Cookham Bridge, a wooden or iron structure, I scarcely remember
which. It spanned the Thames close by the village: the curious will
find its exact position marked in the maps of the period.</p>

<p>In the middle of the bridge, I paused and surveyed that charming
prospect, which I was the last of living men perhaps to see as it
then existed. Close by stood a weir; beside it, the stream divided
into three separate branches, exquisitely backed up by the gentle
green slopes of Hedsor and Cliveden. I could never pass that typical
English view without a glance of admiration; this morning, I pulled
up my bicycle for a moment, and cast my eye down stream with more
than my usual enjoyment of the smooth blue water and the tall white
poplars whose leaves showed their gleaming silver in the breeze
beside it. I might have gazed at it too long--and one minute more
would have sufficed for my destruction--had not a cry from the
tow-path a little farther up attracted my attention.</p>

<p>It was a wild, despairing cry, like that of a man being
overpowered and murdered.</p>

<p>I am confident this was my first intimation of danger. Two minutes
before, it is true, I had heard a faint sound like distant rumbling
of thunder; but nothing else. I am one of those who strenuously
maintain that the catastrophe was not heralded by shocks of
earthquake.</p>

<p>I turned my eye up stream. For half a second I was utterly
bewildered. Strange to say, I did not perceive at first the great
flood of fire that was advancing towards me. I saw only the man who
had shouted--a miserable, cowering, terror-stricken wretch, one of
the abject creatures who used to earn a dubious livelihood in those
days (when the river was a boulevard of pleasure) by towing boats up
stream. But now, he was rushing wildly forward, with panic in his
face; I could see he looked as if close pursued by some wild beast
behind him. "A mad dog!" I said to myself at the outset; "or else a
bull in the meadow!"</p>

<p>I glanced back to see what his pursuer might be; and then, in one
second, the whole horror and terror of the catastrophe burst upon me.
Its whole horror and terror, I say, but not yet its magnitude. I was
aware at first just of a moving red wall, like dull, red-hot molten
metal. Trying to recall at so safe a distance in time and space the
feelings of the moment and the way in which they surged and succeeded
one another, I think I can recollect that my earliest idea was no
more than this: "He must run, or the moving wall will overtake him!"
Next instant, a hot wave seemed to strike my face. It was just like
the blast of heat that strikes one in a glasshouse when you stand in
front of the boiling and seething glass in the furnace. At about the
same point in time, I was aware, I believe, that the dull red wall
was really a wall of fire. But it was cooled by contact with the air
and the water. Even as I looked, however, a second wave from behind
seemed to rush on and break: it overlaid and outran the first one.
This second wave was white, not red--at white heat, I realized. Then,
with a burst of recognition, I knew what it all meant. What Ward had
spoken of last night--a fissure eruption!</p>

<p>I looked back. Ward was coming towards me on the bridge, mounted
on his Columbia. Too speechless to utter one word, I pointed up
stream with my hand He nodded and shouted back, in a singularly calm
voice: "Yes; just what I told you. A fissure-eruption!"</p>

<p>They were the last words I heard him speak. Not that he
appreciated the danger less than I did, though his manner was cool;
but he was wearing no clips to his trousers, and at that critical
moment he caught his leg in his pedals. The accident disconcerted
him; he dismounted hurriedly, and then, panic-stricken as I judged,
abandoned his machine. He tried to run. The error was fatal. He
tripped and fell. What became of him afterward I will mention
later.</p>

<p>But for the moment I saw only the poor wretch on the tow-path. He
was not a hundred yards off, just beyond the little bridge which led
over the opening to a private boat-house. But as he rushed forwards
and shrieked, the wall of fire overtook him. I do not think it quite
caught him. It is hard at such moments to judge what really happens;
but I believe I saw him shrivel like a moth in a flame a few seconds
before the advancing wall of fire swept over the boat-house. I have
seen an insect shrivel just so when flung into the midst of white-hot
coals. He seemed to go off in gas, leaving a shower or powdery ash to
represent his bones behind him. But of this I do not pretend to be
positive; I will allow that my own agitation was far too profound to
permit of my observing anything with accuracy.</p>

<p>How high was the wall at that time? This has been much debated. I
should guess, thirty feet (though it rose afterwards to more than two
hundred), and it advanced rather faster than a man could run down the
centre of the valley. (Later on, its pace accelerated greatly with
subsequent outbursts.) In frantic haste, I saw or felt that only one
chance of safety lay before me: I must strike up hill by the field
path to Hedsor.</p>

<p>I rode for very life, with grim death behind me. Once well across
the bridge, and turning up the hill, I saw Ward on the parapet, with
his arms flung up, trying wildly to save himself by leaping into the
river. Next instant he shrivelled I think, as the beggar had
shrivelled; and it is to this complete combustion before the lava
flood reached them that I attribute the circumstance (so much
commented upon in the scientific excavations among the ruins) that no
cast of dead bodies, like those at Pompeii, have anywhere been found
in the Thames Valley Desert. My own belief is that every human body
was reduced to a gaseous condition by the terrific heat several
seconds before the molten basalt reached it.</p>

<p>Even at the distance which I had now attained from the central
mass, indeed, the heat was intolerable. Yet, strange to say, I saw
few or no people flying as yet from the inundation. The fact is, the
eruption came upon us so suddenly, so utterly without warning or
premonitory symptoms (for I deny the earthquake shocks), that whole
towns must have been destroyed before the inhabitants were aware that
anything out of the common was happening. It is a sort of alleviation
to the general horror to remember that a large proportion of the
victims must have died without even knowing it; one second, they were
laughing, talking, bargaining; the next, they were asphyxiated or
reduced to ashes as you have seen a small fly disappear in an
incandescent gas flame.</p>

<p>This, however, is what I learned afterward. At that moment, I was
only aware of a frantic pace uphill, over a rough, stony road, and
with my pedals working as I had never before worked them; while
behind me, I saw purgatory let loose, striving hard to overtake me. I
just knew that a sea of fire was filling the valley from end to end,
and that its heat scorched my face as I urged on my bicycle in abject
terror.</p>

<p>All this time, I will admit, my panic was purely personal. I was
too much engaged in the engrossing sense of my own pressing danger to
be vividly alive to the public catastrophe. I did not even think of
Ethel and the children. But when I reached the hill by Hedsor
Church--a neat, small building, whose shell still stands, though
scorched and charred, by the edge of the desert--I was able to pause
for half a minute to recover breath, and to look back upon the scene
of the first disaster.</p>

<p>It was a terrible and yet I felt even then a beautiful
sight--beautiful with the awful and unearthly beauty of a great
forest fire, or a mighty conflagration in some crowded city. The
whole river valley, up which I looked, was one sea of fire. Barriers
of red-hot lava formed themselves for a moment now and again where
the outer edge or vanguard of the inundation had cooled a little on
the surface by exposure: and over these temporary dams, fresh
cataracts of white-hot material poured themselves afresh into the
valley beyond it. After a while, as the deeper portion of basalt was
pushed out all was white alike. So glorious it looked in the morning
sunshine that one could hardly realize the appalling reality of that
sea of molten gold; one might almost have imagined a splendid triumph
of the scene painter's art, did one not know that it was actually a
river of fire, overwhelming, consuming, and destroying every object
before it in its devastating progress.</p>

<p>I tried vaguely to discover the source of the disaster. Looking
straight up stream, past Bourne End and Marlow, I descried with
bleared and dazzled eyes a whiter mass than any, glowing fiercely in
the daylight like an electric light, and filling up the narrow gorge
of the river towards Hurley and Henley. I recollected at once that
this portion of the valley was not usually visible from Hedsor Hill,
and almost without thinking of it I instinctively guessed the reason
why it had become so now: it was the centre of disturbance--the
earth's crust just there had bulged upward slightly, till it cracked
and gaped to emit the basalt.</p>

<p>Looking harder, I could make out (though it was like looking at
the sun) that the glowing white dome-shaped mass, as of an electric
light, was the molten lava as it gurgled from the mouth of the vast
fissure. I say vast, because so it seemed to me, though, as everybody
now knows, the actual gap where the earth opened measures no more
than eight miles across, from a point near what was once Shiplake
Ferry to the site of the old lime-kilns at Marlow. Yet when one saw
the eruption actually taking place, the colossal scale of it was what
most appalled one. A sea of fire, eight to twelve miles broad, in the
familiar Thames Valley, impressed and terrified one a thousand times
more than a sea of fire ten times as vast in the nameless wilds of
Western America.</p>

<p>I could see dimly, too, that the flood spread in every direction
from its central point, both up and down the river. To right and
left, indeed, it was soon checked and hemmed in by the hills about
Wargrave and Medmenham; but downward, it had filled the entire valley
as far as Cookham and beyond; while upward, it spread in one vast
glowing sheet towards Reading and the flats by the confluence of the
Kennet. I did not then know, of course, that this gigantic natural
dam or barrier was later on to fill up the whole low-lying level, and
so block the course of the two rivers as to form those twin expanses
of inland water, Lake Newbury and Lake Oxford. Tourists who now look
down on still summer evenings where the ruins of Magdalen and of
Merton may be dimly descried through the pale green depths, their
broken masonry picturesquely overgrown with tangled water-weeds, can
form but little idea of the terrible scene which that peaceful bank
presented while the incandescent lava was pouring forth in a
scorching white flood towards the doomed district. Merchants who
crowd the busy quays of those mushroom cities which have sprung up
with greater rapidity than Chicago or Johannesburg on the indented
shore where the new lakes abut upon the Berkshire Chalk Downs have
half forgotten the horror of the intermediate time when the waters of
the two rivers rose slowly, slowly, day after day, to choke their
valleys and overwhelm some of the most glorious architecture in
Britain. But though I did not know and could not then foresee the
remoter effects of the great fire-flood in that direction, I saw
enough to make my heart stand still within me. It was with difficulty
that I grasped my bicycle, my hands trembled so fiercely. I realized
that I was a spectator of the greatest calamity which had befallen a
civilized land within the ken of history.</p>

<p>I looked southward along the valley in the direction of
Maidenhead. As yet it did not occur to me that the catastrophe was
anything more than a local flood, though even as such it would have
been one of unexampled vastness. My imagination could hardly conceive
that London itself was threatened. In those days one could not grasp
the idea of the destruction of London. I only thought just at first,
"It will go on towards Maidenhead!" Even as I thought it, I saw a
fresh and fiercer gush of fire well out from the central gash, and
flow still faster than ever down the centre of the valley, over the
hardening layer already cooling on its edge by contact with the air
and soil. This new outburst fell in a mad cataract over the end or
van of the last, and instantly spread like water across the level
expanse between the Cliveden hills and the opposite range at
Pinkneys. I realized with a throb that it was advancing towards
Windsor. Then a wild fear thrilled through me. If Windsor, why not
Staines and Chertsey and Hounslow? If Hounslow, why not London?</p>

<p>In a second I remembered Ethel and the children. Hitherto, the
immediate danger of my own position alone had struck me. The fire was
so near; the heat of it rose up in my face and daunted me. But now I
felt I must make a wild dash to warn--not London--no, frankly, I
forgot those millions; but Ethel and my little ones. In that thought,
for the first moment, the real vastness of the catastrophe came home
to me. The Thames Valley was doomed! I must ride for dear life if I
wished to save my wife and children!</p>

<p>I mounted again, but found my shaking feet could hardly work the
pedals. My legs were one jelly. With a frantic effort, I struck off
inland in the direction of Burnham. I did not think my way out
definitely; I hardly knew the topography of the district well enough
to form any clear conception of what route I must take in order to
keep to the hills and avoid the flood of fire that was deluging the
lowlands. But by pure instinct, I believe, I set my face Londonwards
along the ridge of the chalk downs. In three minutes I had lost sight
of the burning flood, and was deep among green lanes and under
shadowy beeches. The very contrast frightened me. I wondered if I was
going mad. It was all so quiet. One could not believe that scarce
five miles off from that devastating sheet of fire, birds were
singing in the sky and men toiling in the fields as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>Near Lambourne Wood I met a brother cyclist, just about to descend
the hill. A curve in the road hid the valley from him I shouted
aloud:</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, don't go down! There is danger, danger!"</p>

<p>He smiled and looked back at me. "I can take any hill in England,"
he answered.</p>

<p>"It's not the hill," I burst out. "There has been an eruption--a
fissure-eruption at Marlow--great floods of fire--and all the valley
is filled with burning lava!"</p>

<p>He stared at me derisively. Then his expression changed of a
sudden. I suppose he saw I was white-faced and horror-stricken. He
drew away as if alarmed. "Go back to Colney Hatch!" he cried,
pedalling faster and rode hastily down the hill, as if afraid of me.
I have no doubt he must have ridden into the very midst of the flood,
and been scorched by its advance, before he could check his machine
on so sudden a slope.</p>

<p>Between Lambourne Wood and Burnham I did not see the fire-flood. I
rode on at full speed among green fields and meadows. Here and there
I passed a labouring man on the road. More than one looked up at me
and commented on the oppressive heat, but none of them seemed to be
aware of the fate that was overtaking their own homes close by, in
the valley. I told one or two, but they laughed and gazed after me as
if I were a madman. I grew sick of warning them. They took no heed of
my words, but went on upon their way as if nothing out of the common
were happening to England.</p>

<p>On the edge of the down, near Burnham, I caught sight of the
valley again. Here, people were just awaking to what was taking place
near them. Half the population was gathered on the slope, looking
down with wonder on the flood of fire, which had now just turned the
corner of the hills by Taplow. Silent terror was the prevailing type
of expression. But when I told them I had seen the lava bursting
forth from the earth in a white dome above Marlow, they laughed me to
scorn; and when I assured them I was pushing forward in hot haste to
London, they answered, "London! It won't never get as far as London!"
That was the only place on the hills, as is now well known, where the
flood was observed long enough beforehand to telegraph and warn the
inhabitants of the great city; but nobody thought of doing it; and I
must say, even if they had done so, there is not the slightest
probability that the warning would have attracted the least attention
in our ancient Metropolis. Men on the Stock Exchange would have made
jests about the slump, and proceeded to buy and sell as usual.</p>

<p>I measured with my eye the level plain between Burnham and Slough,
calculating roughly with myself whether I should have time to descend
upon the well-known road from Maidenhead to London by Colnbrook and
Hounslow. (I advise those who are unacquainted with the topography of
this district before the eruption to follow out my route on a good
map of the period.) But I recognised in a moment that this course
would be impossible. At the rate that the flood had taken to progress
from Cookham Bridge to Taplow, I felt sure it would be upon me before
I reached Upton, or Ditton Park at the outside. It is true the speed
of the advance might slacken somewhat as the lava cooled; and strange
to say, so rapidly do realities come to be accepted in one's mind,
that I caught myself thinking this thought in the most natural
manner, as if I had all my life long been accustomed to the ways of
fissure-eruptions. But on the other hand, the lava might well out
faster and hotter than before, as I had already seen it do more than
once; and I had no certainty even that it would not rise to the level
of the hills on which I was standing. You who read this narrative
nowadays take it for granted, of course, that the extent and height
of the inundation was bound to be exactly what you know it to have
been; we at the time could not guess how high it might rise and how
large an area of the country it might overwhelm and devastate. Was it
to stop at the Chilterns, or to go north to Birmingham, York, and
Scotland?</p>

<p>Still, in my trembling anxiety to warn my wife and children, I
debated with myself whether I should venture down into the valley,
and hurry along the main road with a wild burst for London. I thought
of Ethel, alone in our little home at Bayswater, and almost made up
my mind to risk it. At that moment, I became aware that the road to
London was already crowded with carriages, carts, and cycles, all
dashing at a mad pace unanimously towards London. Suddenly a fresh
wave turned the corner by Taplow and Maidenhead Bridge, and began to
gain upon them visibly. It was an awful sight. I cannot pretend to
describe it. The poor creatures on the road, men and animals alike,
rushed wildly, despairingly on; the fire took them from behind, and,
one by one, before the actual sea reached them, I saw them shrivel
and melt away in the fierce white heat of the advancing inundation. I
could not look at it any longer. I certainly could not descend and
court instant death. I felt that my one chance was to strike across
the downs, by Stoke Poges and Uxbridge, and then try the line of
northern heights to London.</p>

<p>Oh, how fiercely I pedalled! At Farnham Royal (where again nobody
seemed to be aware what had happened) a rural policeman tried to stop
me for frantic riding. I tripped him up, and rode on. Experience had
taught me it was no use telling those who had not seen it of the
disaster. A little beyond, at the entrance to a fine park, a
gatekeeper attempted to shut a gate in my face, exclaiming that the
road was private. I saw it was the only practicable way without
descending to the valley, and I made up my mind this was no time for
trifling. I am a man of peace, but I lifted my fist and planted it
between his eyes. Then, before he could recover from his
astonishment, I had mounted again and ridden on across the park,
while he ran after me in vain, screaming to the men in the
pleasure-grounds to stop me. But I would not be stopped; and I
emerged on the road once more at Stoke Poges.</p>

<p>Near Galley Hill, after a long and furious ride, I reached the
descent to Uxbridge. Was it possible to descend? I glanced across,
once more by pure instinct, for I had never visited the spot before,
towards where I felt the Thames must run. A great white cloud hung
over it. I saw what that cloud must mean: it was the steam of the
river, where the lava sucked it up and made it seethe and boil
suddenly. I had not noticed this white fleece of steam at Cookham,
though I did not guess why till afterwards. In the narrow valley
where the Thames ran between hills, the lava flowed over it all at
once, bottling the steam beneath; and it is this imprisoned steam
that gave rise in time to the subsequent series of appalling
earthquakes, to supply forecasts of which is now the chief duty of
the Seismologer Royal; whereas, in the open plain, the basalt
advanced more gradually and in a thinner stream, and therefore turned
the whole mass of water into white cloud as soon as it reached each
bend of the river.</p>

<p>At the time, however, I had no leisure to think out all this. I
only knew by such indirect signs that the flood was still advancing,
and, therefore, that it would be impossible for me to proceed towards
London by the direct route via Uxbridge and Hanwell. If I meant to
reach town (as we called it familiarly), I must descend to the valley
at once, pass through Uxbridge streets as fast as I could, make a
dash across the plain, by what I afterwards knew to be Hillingdon (I
saw it then as a nameless village), and aim at a house-crowned hill
which I only learned later was Harrow, but which I felt sure would
enable me to descend upon London by Hampstead or Highgate.</p>

<p>I am no strategist; but in a second, in that extremity, I picked
out these points, feeling dimly sure they would lead me home to Ethel
and the children.</p>

<p>The town of Uxbridge (whose place you can still find marked on
many maps) lay in the valley of a small river, a confluent of the
Thames. Up this valley it was certain that the lava-stream must flow;
and, indeed, at the present day, the basin around is completely
filled by one of the solidest and most forbidding masses of black
basalt in the country. Still, I made up my mind to descend and cut
across the low-lying ground towards Harrow. If I failed, I felt,
after all, I was but one unit more in what I now began to realize as
a prodigious national calamity.</p>

<p>I was just coasting down the hill, with Uxbridge lying snug and
unconscious in the glen below me, when a slight and unimportant
accident occurred which almost rendered impossible my further
progress. It was past the middle of August; the hedges were being
cut; and this particular lane, bordered by a high thorn fence, was
strewn with the mangled branches of the may-bushes. At any other
time, I should have remembered the danger and avoided them; that day,
hurrying down hill for dear life and for Ethel, I forgot to notice
them. The consequence was, I was pulled up suddenly by finding my
front wheel deflated; this untimely misfortune almost unmanned me. I
dismounted and examined the tyre; it had received a bad puncture. I
tried inflating again, in hopes the hole might be small enough to
make that precaution sufficient. But it was quite useless. I found I
must submit to stop and doctor up the puncture. Fortunately, I had
the necessary apparatus in my wallet.</p>

<p>I think it was the weirdest episode of all that weird ride--this
sense of stopping impatiently, while the fiery flood still surged on
towards London, in order to go through all the fiddling and
troublesome little details of mending a pneumatic tyre. The moment
and the operation seemed so sadly out of harmony. A countryman passed
by on a cart, obviously suspecting nothing; that was another point
which added horror to the occasion--that so near the catastrophe, so
very few people were even aware what was taking place beside them.
Indeed, as is well known, I was one of the very few who saw the
eruption during its course, and yet managed to escape from it.
Elsewhere, those who tried to run before it, either to escape
themselves or to warn others of the danger, were overtaken by the
lava before they could reach a place of safety. I attribute this
mainly to the fact that most of them continued along the high roads
in the valley, or fled instinctively for shelter towards their homes,
instead of making at once for the heights and the uplands.</p>

<p>The countryman stopped and looked at me.</p>

<p>"The more haste the less speed!" he said, with proverbial
wisdom.</p>

<p>I glanced up at him, and hesitated. Should I warn him of his doom,
or was it useless? "Keep up on the hills," I said, at last. "An
unspeakable calamity is happening in the valley. Flames of fire are
flowing down it, as from a great burning mountain. You will be cut
off by the eruption."</p>

<p>He stared at me blankly, and burst into a meaningless laugh. "Why,
you're one of them Salvation Army fellows," he exclaimed, after a
short pause. "You're trying to preach to me. I'm going to Uxbridge."
And he continued down the hill towards certain destruction.</p>

<p>It was hours, I feel sure, before I had patched up that puncture,
though I did it by the watch in four and a half minutes. As soon as I
had blown out my tyre again I mounted once more, and rode at a
breakneck pace to Uxbridge. I passed down the straggling main street
of the suburban town, crying aloud as I went, "Run, run, to the
downs! A flood of lava is rushing up the valley! To the hills, for
your lives! All the Thames bank is blazing!" Nobody took the
slightest heed; they stood still in the street for a minute with open
mouths: then they returned to their customary occupations. A quarter
of an hour later, there was no such place in the world as
Uxbridge.</p>

<p>I followed the main road through the village which I have since
identified as Hillingdon; then I diverged to the left, partly by
roads and partly by field paths of whose exact course I am still
uncertain, towards the hill at Harrow. When I reached the town, I did
not strive to rouse the people, partly because my past experience had
taught me the futility of the attempt, and partly because I rightly
judged that they were safe from the inundation; for as it never quite
covered the dome of St. Paul's, part of which still protrudes from
the sea of basalt, it did not reach the level of the northern heights
of London. I rode on through Harrow without one word to any body. I
did not desire to be stopped or harassed as an escaped lunatic.</p>

<p>From Harrow I made my way tortuously along the rising ground, by
the light of nature, through Wembley Park, to Willesden. At
Willesden, for the first time, I found to a certainty that London was
threatened. Great crowds of people in the profoundest excitement
stood watching a dense cloud of smoke and steam that spread rapidly
over the direction of Shepherd's Bush and Hammersmith. They were
speculating as to its meaning, but laughed incredulously when I told
them what it portended. A few minutes later, the smoke spread
ominously towards Kensington and Paddington. That settled my fate. It
was clearly impossible to descend into London; and indeed, the heat
now began to be unendurable. It drove us all back, almost physically.
I thought I must abandon all hope. I should never even know what had
become of Ethel and the children.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to lie down and await the fire-flood. Yet the
sense of the greatness of the catastrophe seemed somehow to blunt
one's own private grief. I was beside myself with fear for my
darlings; but I realized that I was but one among hundreds of
thousands of fathers in the same position. What was happening at that
moment in the great city of five million souls we did not know, we
shall never know; but we may conjecture that the end was mercifully
too swift to entail much needless suffering. All at once, a gleam of
hope struck me. It was my father's birthday. Was it not just possible
that Ethel might have taken the children up to Hampstead to wish
their grandpa many happy returns of the day? With a wild
determination not to give up all for lost, I turned my front wheel in
the direction of Hampstead Hill, still skirting the high ground as
far as possible. My heart was on fire within me. A restless anxiety
urged me to ride my hardest. As all along the route, I was still just
a minute or two in front of the catastrophe. People were beginning to
be aware that something was taking place; more than once as I passed
they asked me eagerly where the fire was. It was impossible for me to
believe by this time that they knew nothing of an event in whose
midst I seemed to have been living for months; how could I realize
that all the things which had happened since I started from Cookham
Bridge so long ago were really compressed into the space of a single
morning?--nay, more, of an hour and a half only?</p>

<p>As I approached Windmill Hill, a terrible sinking seized me. I
seemed to totter on the brink of a precipice. Could Ethel be safe?
Should I ever again see little Bertie and the baby? I pedalled on as
if automatically; for all life had gone out of me. I felt my
hip-joint moving dry in its socket. I held my breath; my heart stood
still. It was a ghastly moment.</p>

<p>At my father's door I drew up, and opened the garden gate. I
hardly dared to go in. Though each second was precious, I paused and
hesitated.</p>

<p>At last I turned the handle. I heard somebody within. My heart
came up in my mouth. It was little Bertie's voice: "Do it again,
Granpa; do it again; it amooses Bertie!"</p>

<p>I rushed into the room. "Bertie, Bertie!" I cried. "Is Mammy
here?"</p>

<p>He flung himself upon me. "Mammy, Mammy, Daddy has comed home." I
burst into tears. "And Baby?" I asked, trembling.</p>

<p>"Baby and Ethel are here, George," my father answered, staring at
me. "Why, my boy, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>I flung myself into a chair and broke down. In that moment of
relief, I felt that London was lost, but I had saved my wife and
children.</p>

<p>I did not wait for explanations. A crawling four-wheeler was
loitering by. I hailed it and hurried them in. My father wished to
discuss the matter, but I cut him short. I gave the driver three
pounds--all the gold I had with me. "Drive on!" I shouted, "drive on!
Towards Hatfield--anywhere!"</p>

<p>He drove as he was bid. We spent that night, while Hampstead
flared like a beacon, at an isolated farm-house on the high ground in
Hertfordshire. For, of course, though the flood did not reach so
high, it set fire to everything inflammable in its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Next day, all the world knew the magnitude of the disaster. It can
only be summed up in five emphatic words: There was no more
London.</p>

<p>I have one other observation alone to make. I noticed at the time
how, in my personal relief, I forgot for the moment that London was
perishing. I even forgot that my house and property had perished.
Exactly the opposite, it seemed to me, happened with most of those
survivors who lost wives and children in the eruption. They moved
about as in a dream, without a tear, without a complaint, helping
others to provide for the needs of the homeless and houseless. The
universality of the catastrophe made each man feel as though it were
selfishness to attach too great an importance at such a crisis to his
own personal losses. Nay, more; the burst of feverish activity and
nervous excitement, I might even say enjoyment, which followed the
horror, was traceable, I think, to this self-same cause. Even grave
citizens felt they must do their best to dispel the universal gloom;
and they plunged accordingly into around of dissipations which other
nations thought both unseemly and un-English. It was one way of
expressing the common emotion. We had all lost heart and we flocked
to the theatres to pluck up our courage. That, I believe, must be our
national answer to M. Zola's strictures on our untimely levity. "This
people," says the great French author, "which took its pleasures
sadly while it was rich and prosperous, begins to dance and sing
above the ashes of its capital--it makes merry by the open graves of
its wives and children. What an enigma! What a puzzle! What chance of
an OEdipus!"</p>
