<h1>With the Eyes Shut</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Edward Bellamy</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>RAILROAD rides are naturally tiresome to persons who cannot read
on the cars, and, being one of those unfortunates, I resigned myself,
on taking my seat in the train, to several hours of tedium,
alleviated only by such cat-naps as I might achieve. Partly on
account of my infirmity, though more on account of a taste for rural
quiet and retirement, my railroad journeys are few and far between.
Strange as the statement may seem in days like these, it had actually
been five years since I had been on an express train of a trunk line.
Now, as every one knows, the improvements in the conveniences of the
best equipped trains have in that period been very great, and for a
considerable time I found myself amply entertained in taking note
first of one ingenious device and then of another, and wondering what
would come next. At the end of the first hour, however, I was pleased
to find that I was growing comfortably drowsy, and proceeded to
compose myself for a nap, which I hoped might last to my
destination.</p>

<p>Presently I was touched on the shoulder, and a train boy asked me
if I would not like something to read. I replied, rather petulantly,
that I could not read on the cars, and only wanted to be let
alone.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir," the train boy replied, "but I 'll give you a
book you can read with your eyes shut. Guess you haven't taken this
line lately," he added, as I looked up offended at what seemed
impertinence. "We've been furnishing the new-fashioned phonographed
books and magazines on this train for six months now, and passengers
have got so they won't have anything else."</p>

<p>Probably this piece of information ought to have astonished me
more than it did, but I had read enough about the wonders of the
phonograph to be prepared in a vague sort of way for almost anything
which might be related of it, and for the rest, after the air-brakes,
the steam heat, the electric lights and annunciators, the vestibuled
cars, and other delightful novelties I had just been admiring, almost
anything seemed likely in the way of railway conveniences.
Accordingly, when the boy proceeded to rattle off a list of the
latest novels, I stopped him with the name of one which I had heard
favorable mention of, and told him I would try that.</p>

<p>He was good enough to commend my choice. "That 's a good one," he
said. "It 's all the rage. Half the train's on it this trip. Where
'll you begin?"</p>

<p>"Where? Why, at the beginning. Where else?" I replied.</p>

<p>"All right. Didn't know but you might have partly read it. Put you
on at any chapter or page, you know. Put you on at first chapter with
next batch in five minutes, soon as the batch that 's on now gets
through."</p>

<p>He unlocked a little box at the side of my seat, collected the
price of three hours' reading at five cents an hour, and went on down
the aisle. Presently I heard the tinkle of a bell from the box which
he had unlocked. Following the example of others around me, I took
from it a sort of two-pronged fork with the tines spread in the
similitude of a chicken's wishbone. This contrivance, which was
attached to the side of the car by a cord, I proceeded to apply to my
ears, as I saw the others doing.</p>

<p>For the next three hours I scarcely altered my position, so
completely was I enthralled by my novel experience. Few persons can
fail to have made the observation that if the tones of the human
voice did not have a charm for us in themselves apart from the ideas
they convey, conversation to a great extent would soon be given up,
so little is the real intellectual interest of the topics with which
it is chiefly concerned. When, then, the sympathetic influence of the
voice is lent to the enhancement of matter of high intrinsic
interest, it is not strange that the attention should be enchained. A
good story is highly entertaining even when we have to get at it by
the roundabout means of spelling out the signs that stand for the
words, and imagining them uttered, and then imagining what they would
mean if uttered. What, then, shall be said of the delight of sitting
at one's ease, with closed eyes, listening to the same story poured
into one's ears in the strong, sweet, musical tones of a perfect
mistress of the art of story-telling, and of the expression and
excitation by means of the voice of every emotion?</p>

<p>When, at the conclusion of the story, the train boy came to lock
up the box, I could not refrain from expressing my satisfaction in
strong terms. In reply he volunteered the information that next month
the cars for day trips on that line would be further fitted up with
phonographic guide-books of the country the train passed through, so
connected by clock-work with the running gear of the cars that the
guide-book would call attention to every object in the landscape, and
furnish the pertinent information--statistical, topographical,
biographical, historical, romantic, or legendary, as it might
be--just at the time the train had reached the most favorable point
of view. It was believed that this arrangement (for which, as it
would work automatically and require little attendance, being used or
not, according to pleasure, by the passenger, there would be no
charge) would do much to attract travel to the road. His explanation
was interrupted by the announcement in loud, clear, and deliberate
tones, which no one could have had any excuse for misunderstanding
that the train was now approaching the city of my destination. As I
looked around in amazement to discover what manner of brakeman this
might be whom I had understood, the train boy said, with a grin,
"That's our new phonographic annunciator."</p>

<p>Hamage had written me that he would be at the station, but
something had evidently prevented him from keeping the appointment,
and as it was late, I went at once to a hotel and to bed. I was tired
and slept heavily; once or twice I woke up, after dreaming there were
people in my room talking to me, but quickly dropped off to sleep
again. Finally I awoke, and did not so soon fall asleep. Presently I
found myself sitting up in bed with half a dozen extraordinary
sensations contending for right of way along my backbone. What had
startled me was the voice of a young woman, who could not have been
standing more than ten feet from my bed. If the tones of her voice
were any guide, she was not only a young woman, but a very charming
one.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," she had said, "you may possibly be interested in
knowing that it now wants just a quarter of three."</p>

<p>For a few moments I thought--well, I will not undertake the
impossible task of telling what extraordinary conjectures occurred to
me by way of accounting for the presence of this young woman in my
room before the true explanation of the matter occurred to me. For,
of course, when my experience that afternoon on the train flashed
through my mind, I guessed at once that the solution of the mystery
was in all probability merely a phonographic device for announcing
the hour. Nevertheless, so thrilling and lifelike in effect were the
tones of the voice I had heard that I confess I had not the nerve to
light the gas to investigate till I had indued my more essential
garments. Of course I found no lady in the room, but only a clock. I
had not particularly noticed it on going to bed, because it looked
like any other clock, and so now it continued to behave until the
hands pointed to three. Then, instead of leaving me to infer the time
from the arbitrary symbolism of three strokes on a bell, the same
voice which had before electrified me informed me, in tones which
would have lent a charm to the driest of statistical details, what
the hour was. I had never before been impressed with any particular
interest attaching to the hour of three in the morning, but as I
heard it announced in those low, rich, thrilling contralto tones, it
appeared fairly to coruscate with previously latent suggestions of
romance and poetry, which, if somewhat vague, were very pleasing.
Turning out the gas that I might the more easily imagine the
bewitching presence which the voice suggested, I went back to bed,
and lay awake there until morning, enjoying the society of my
bodiless companion and the delicious shock of her quarter-hourly
remarks. To make the illusion more complete and the more unsuggestive
of the mechanical explanation which I knew of course was the real
one, the phrase in which the announcement of the hour was made was
never twice the same.</p>

<p>Right was Solomon when he said that there was nothing new under
the sun. Sardanapalus or Semiramis herself would not have been at all
startled to hear a human voice proclaim the hour. The phonographic
clock had but replaced the slave whose business, standing by the
noiseless water-clock, it was to keep tale of the moments as they
dropped, ages before they had been taught to tick.</p>

<p>In the morning, on descending, I went first to the clerk's office
to inquire for letters, thinking Hamage, who knew I would go to that
hotel if any, might have addressed me there. The clerk handed me a
small oblong box. I suppose I stared at it in a rather helpless way,
for presently he said: "I beg your pardon, but I see you are a
stranger. If you will permit me, I will show you how to read your
letter."</p>

<p>I gave him the box, from which he took a device of spindles and
cylinders, and placed it deftly within another small box which stood
on the desk. Attached to this was one of the two-pronged ear-trumpets
I already knew the use of. As I placed it in position, the clerk
touched a spring in the box, which set some sort of motor going, and
at once the familiar tones of Dick Hamage's voice expressed his
regret that an accident had prevented his meeting me the night
before, and informed me that he would be at the hotel by the time I
had breakfasted.</p>

<p>The letter ended, the obliging clerk removed the cylinders from
the box on the desk, replaced them in that they had come in, and
returned it to me.</p>

<p>"Is n't it rather tantalizing," said I, "to receive one of these
letters when there is no little machine like this at hand to make it
speak?"</p>

<p>"It does n't often happen," replied the clerk, "that anybody is
caught without his indispensable, or at least where he cannot borrow
one."</p>

<p>"His indispensable!" I exclaimed. "What may that be?"</p>

<p>In reply the clerk directed my attention to a little box, not
wholly unlike a case for a binocular glass, which, now that he spoke
of it, I saw was carried, slung at the side, by every person in
sight.</p>

<p>"We call it the indispensable because it is indispensable, as, no
doubt, you will soon find for yourself."</p>

<p>In the breakfast-room a number of ladies and gentlemen were
engaged as they sat at table in reading, or rather in listening to,
their morning's correspondence. A greater or smaller pile of little
boxes lay beside their plates, aud one after another they took from
each its cylinders, placed them in their indispensables, and held the
latter to their ears. The expression of the face in reading is so
largely affected by the necessary fixity of the eyes that
intelligence is absorbed from the printed or written page with
scarcely a change of countenance, which when communicated by the
voice evokes a responsive play of features. I had never been struck
so forcibly by this obvious reflection as I was in observing the
expression of the faces of these people as they listened to their
correspondents. Disappointment, pleased surprise, chagrin, disgust,
indignation, and amusement were alternately so legible on their faces
that it was perfectly easy for one to be sure in most cases what the
tenor at least of the letter was. It occurred to me that while in the
old time the pleasure of receiving letters had been so far balanced
by this drudgery of writing them as to keep correspondence within
some bounds, nothing less than freight trains could suffice for the
mail service in these days, when to write was but to speak, and to
listen was to read.</p>

<p>After I had given my order, the waiter brought a curious-looking
oblong case, with an ear-trumpet attached, and, placing it before me,
went away. I foresaw that I should have to ask a good many questions
before I got through, and, if I did not mean to be a bore, I had best
ask as few as necessary. I determined to find out what this trap was
without assistance. The words "Daily Morning Herald" sufficiently
indicated that it was a newspaper. I suspected that a certain big
knob, if pushed, would set it going. But, for all I knew, it might
start in the middle of the advertisements. I looked closer. There
were a number of printed slips upon the face of the machine, arranged
about a circle like the numbers on a dial. They were evidently the
headings of news articles. In the middle of the circle was a little
pointer, like the hand of a clock, moving on a pivot. I pushed this
pointer around to a certain caption, and then, with the air of being
perfectly familiar with the machine, I put the pronged trumpet to my
ears and pressed the big knob. Precisely! It worked like a charm; so
much like a charm, indeed, that I should certainly have allowed my
breakfast to cool had I been obliged to choose between that and my
newspaper. The inventor of the apparatus had, however, provided
against so painful a dilemma by a simple attachment to the trumpet,
which held it securely in position upon the shoulders behind the
head, while the hands were left free for knife and fork. Having slyly
noted the manner in which my neighbors had effected the adjustments,
I imitated their example with a careless air, and presently, like
them, was absorbing physical and mental aliment simultaneously.</p>

<p>While I was thus delightfully engaged, I was not less delightfully
interrupted by Hamage, who, having arrived at the hotel, and learned
that I was in the breakfast-room, came in and sat down beside me.
After telling him how much I admired the new sort of newspapers, I
offered one criticism, which was that there seemed to be no way by
which one could skip dull paragraphs or uninteresting details.</p>

<p>"The invention would, indeed, be very far from a success," he
said, "if there were no such provision, but there is."</p>

<p>He made me put on the trumpet again, and, having set the machine
going, told me to press on a certain knob, at first gently, afterward
as hard as I pleased. I did so, and found that the effect of the
"skipper," as he called the knob, was to quicken the utterance of the
phonograph in proportion to the pressure to at least tenfold the
usual rate of speed, while at any moment, if a word of interest
caught the ear, the ordinary rate of delivery was resumed, and by
another adjustment the machine could be made to go back and repeat as
much as desired.</p>

<p>When I told Hamage of my experience of the night before with the
talking clock in my room, he laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>"I am very glad you mentioned this just now," he said, when he had
quieted himself. "We have a couple of hours before the train goes out
to my place, and I 'll take you through Orton's establishment, where
they make a specialty of these talking clocks. I have a number of
them in my house, and, as I don't want to have you scared to death in
the night-watches, you had better get some notion of what clocks
nowadays are expected to do."</p>

<p>Orton's, where we found ourselves half an hour later, proved to be
a very extensive establishment, the firm making a specialty of
horological novelties, and particularly of the new phonographic
time-pieces. The manager, who was a personal friend of Hamage's, and
proved very obliging, said that the latter were fast driving the
old-fashioned striking clocks out of use.</p>

<p>"And no wonder," he exclaimed; "the old-fashioned striker was an
unmitigated nuisance. Let alone the brutality of announcing the hour
to a refined household by four, eight, or ten rude bangs, without
introduction or apology, this method of announcement was not even
tolerably intelligible. Unless you happened to be attentive at the
moment the din began, you could never be sure of your count of
strokes so as to be positive whether it was eight, nine, ten, or
eleven. As to the half and quarter strokes, they were wholly useless
unless you chanced to know what was the last hour struck. And then,
too, I should like to ask you why, in the name of common sense, it
should take twelve times as long to tell you it is twelve o'clock as
it does to tell you it is one."</p>

<p>The manager laughed as heartily as Hamage had done on learning of
my scare of the night before.</p>

<p>"It was lucky for you," he said, "that the clock in your room
happened to be a simple time announcer, otherwise you might easily
have been startled half out of your wits." I became myself quite of
the same opinion by the time he had shown us something of his
assortment of clocks. The mere announcing of the hours and quarters
of hours was the simplest of the functions of these wonderful and yet
simple instruments. There were few of them which were not arranged to
"improve the time," as the old fashioned prayer-meeting phrase was.
People's ideas differing widely as to what constitutes improvement of
time, the clocks varied accordingly in the nature of the edification
they provided. There were religious and sectarian clocks, moral
clocks, philosophical clocks, free-thinking and infidel clocks,
literary and poetical clocks, educational clocks, frivolous and
bacchanalian clocks. In the religious clock department were to be
found Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist, Episcopal, and Baptist
time-pieces, which, in connection with the announcement of the hour
and quarter, repeated some tenet of the sect with a proof text. There
were also Talmage clocks, and Spurgeon clocks, and Storrs clocks, and
Brooks clocks, which respectively marked the flight of time by
phrases taken from the sermons of these eminent divines, and repeated
in precisely the voice and accents of the original delivery. In
startling proximity to the religious department I was shown the
skeptical clocks. So near were they, indeed, that when, as I stood
there, the various time-pieces announced the hour of ten, the war of
opinions that followed was calculated to unsettle the firmest
convictions. The observations of an Ingersoll which stood near me
were particularly startling. The effect of an actual wrangle was the
greater from the fact that all these individual clocks were
surmounted by effigies of the authors of the sentiments they
repeated.</p>

<p>I was glad to escape from this turmoil to the calmer atmosphere of
the philosophical and literary clock department. For persons with a
taste for antique moralizing, the sayings of Plato, Epictetus, and
Marcus Aurelius had here, so to speak, been set to time. Modern
wisdom was represented by a row of clocks surmounted by the heads of
famous maxim-makers, from Rochefoucauld to Josh Billings. As for the
literary clocks, their number and variety were endless. All the great
authors were represented. Of the Dickens clocks alone there were half
a dozen, with selections from his greatest stories. When I suggested
that, captivating as such clocks must be, one might in time grow
weary of hearing the same sentiments reiterated, the manager pointed
out that the phonographic cylinders were removable, and could be
replaced by other sayings by the same author or on the same theme at
any time. If one tired of an author altogether, he could have the
head unscrewed from the top of the clock and that of some other
celebrity substituted, with a brand-new repertory.</p>

<p>"I can imagine," I said, "that these talking clocks must be a
great resource for invalids especially, and for those who cannot
sleep at night. But, on the other hand, how is it when people want or
need to sleep? Is not one of them quite too interesting a companion
at such a time?"</p>

<p>"Those who are used to it," replied the manager, "are no more
disturbed by the talking clock than we used to be by the striking
clock. However, to avoid all possible inconvenience to invalids, this
little lever is provided, which at a touch will throw the phonograph
out of gear or back again. It is customary when we put a talking or
singing clock into a bedroom to put in an electric connection, so
that by pressing a button at the head of the bed a person, without
raising the head from the pillow, can start or stop the phonographic
gear, as well as ascertain the time, on the repeater principle as
applied to watches."</p>

<p>Hamage now said that we had only time to catch the train, but our
conductor insisted that we should stop to see a novelty of
phonographic invention, which, although not exactly in their line,
had been sent them for exhibition by the inventor. It was a device
for meeting the criticism frequently made upon the churches of a lack
of attention and cordiality in welcoming strangers. It was to be
placed in the lobby of the church, and had an arm extending like a
pump-handle. Any stranger on taking this and moving it up and down
would be welcomed in the pastor's own voice, and continue to be
welcomed as long as he kept up the motion. While this welcome would
be limited to general remarks of regard and esteem, ample provision
was made for strangers who desired to be more particularly inquired
into. A number of small buttons on the front of the contrivance bore
respectively the words, "Male," "Female," "Married," "Unmarried,"
"Widow," "Children," "No Children," etc., etc. By pressing the one of
these buttons corresponding to his or her condition, the stranger
would be addressed in terms probably quite as accurately adapted to
his or her condition and needs as would be any inquiries a
preoccupied clergyman would be likely to make under similar
circumstances. I could readily see the necessity of some such
substitute for the pastor, when I was informed that every prominent
clergyman was now in the habit of supplying at least a dozen or two
pulpits simultaneously, appearing by turns in one of them personally,
and by phonograph in the others.</p>

<p>The inventor of the contrivance for welcoming strangers was, it
appeared, applying the same idea to machines for discharging many
other of the more perfunctory obligations of social intercourse. One
being made for the convenience of the President of the United States
at public receptions was provided with forty-two buttons for the
different States, and others for the principal cities of the Union,
so that a caller, by proper manipulation, might, while shaking a
handle, be addressed in regard to his home interests with an
exactness of information as remarkable as that of the traveling
statesmen who rise from the gazetteer to astonish the inhabitants of
Wayback Crossing with the precise figures of their town valuation and
birth rate, while the engine is taking in water.</p>

<p>We had by this time spent so much time that on finally starting
for the railroad station we had to walk quite briskly. As we were
hurrying along the street, my attention was arrested by a musical
sound, distinct though not loud, proceeding apparently from the
indispensable which Hamage, like everybody else I had seen, wore at
his side. Stopping abruptly, he stepped aside from the throng, and,
lifting the indispensable quickly to his ear, touched something, and
exclaiming, "Oh, yes, to be sure!" dropped the instrument to his
side.</p>

<p>Then he said to me: "I am reminded that I promised my wife to
bring home some story-books for the children when I was in town
to-day. The store is only a few steps down the street." As we went
along, he explained to me that nobody any longer pretended to charge
his mind with the recollection of duties or engagements of any sort.
Everybody depended upon his indispensable to remind him in time of
all undertakings and responsibilities. This service it was able to
render by virtue of a simple enough adjustment of a phonographic
cylinder charged with the necessary word or phrase to the clockwork
in the indispensable, so that at any time fixed upon in setting the
arrangement an alarm would sound, and, the indispensable being raised
to the ear, the phonograph would deliver its message, which at any
subsequent time might be called up and repeated. To all persons
charged with weighty responsibilities depending upon accuracy of
memory for their correct discharge, this feature of the indispensable
rendered it, according to Hamage, and indeed quite obviously, an
indispensable truly. To the railroad engineer it served the purpose
not only of a time-piece, for the works of the indispensable include
a watch, but to its ever vigilant alarm he could intrust his running
orders, and, while his mind was wholly concentrated upon present
duties, rest secure that he would be reminded at just the proper time
of trains which he must avoid and switches he must make. To the
indispensable of the business man the reminder attachment was not
less necessary. Provided with that, his notes need never go to
protest through carelessness, nor, however absorbed, was he in danger
of forgetting an appointment.</p>

<p>Thanks to these portable memories it was, moreover, now possible
for a wife to intrust to her husband the most complete messages to
the dress-maker. All she had to do was to whisper the communication
into her husband's indispensable while he was at breakfast, and set
the alarm at an hour when he would be in the city.</p>

<p>"And in like manner, I suppose," suggested I, "if she wishes him
to return at a certain hour from the club or the lodge, she can
depend on his indispensable to remind him of his domestic duties at
the proper moment, and in terms and tones which will make the total
repudiation of connubial allegiance the only alternative of
obedience. It is a very clever invention, and I don't wonder that it
is popular with the ladies; but does it not occur to you that the
inventor, if a man, was slightly inconsiderate? The rule of the
American wife has hitherto been a despotism which could be tempered
by a bad memory. Apparently, it is to be no longer tempered at
all."</p>

<p>Hamage laughed, but his mirth was evidently a little forced, and I
inferred that the reflection I had suggested had called up certain
reminiscences not wholly exhilarating. Being fortunate, however, in
the possession of a mercurial temperament, he presently rallied, and
continued his praises of the artificial memory provided by the
indispensable. In spite of the criticism which I had made upon it, I
confess I was not a little moved by his description of its advantages
to absent-minded men, of whom I am chief. Think of the gain alike in
serenity and force of intellect enjoyed by the man who sits down to
work absolutely free from that accursed cloud on the mind of things
he has got to remember to do, and can only avoid totally forgetting
by wasting tenfold the time required finally to do them in making
sure by frequent rehearsals that he has not forgotten them! The only
way that one of these trivialities ever sticks to the mind is by
wearing a sore spot in it which heals slowly. If a man does not
forget it, it is for the same reason that he remembers a grain of
sand in his eye. I am conscious that my own mind is full of
cicatrices of remembered things, and long ere this it would have been
peppered with them like a colander, had I not a good while ago, in
self-defense, absolutely refused to be held accountable for
forgetting anything not connected with my regular business.</p>

<p>While firmly believing my course in this matter to have been
justifiable and necessary, I have not been insensible to the domestic
odium which it has brought upon me, and could but welcome a device
which promised to enable me to regain the esteem of my family while
retaining the use of my mind for professional purposes.</p>

<p>As the most convenient conceivable receptacle of hasty memoranda
of ideas and suggestions, the indispensable also most strongly
commended itself to me as a man who lives by writing. How convenient
when a flash of inspiration comes to one in the night-time, instead
of taking cold and waking the family in order to save it for
posterity, just to whisper it into the ear of an indispensable at
one's bedside, and be able to know it in the morning for the rubbish
such untimely conceptions usually are! How often, likewise, would
such a machine save in all their first vividness suggestive fancies,
anticipated details, and other notions worth preserving, which occur
to one in the full flow of composition, but are irrelevant to what is
at the moment in hand! I determined that I must have an
indispensable.</p>

<p>The bookstore, when we arrived there, proved to be the most
extraordinary sort of bookstore I had ever entered, there not being a
book in it. Instead of books, the shelves and counters were occupied
with rows of small boxes.</p>

<p>"Almost all books now, you see, are phonographed," said
Hamage.</p>

<p>"The change seems to be a popular one," I said, "to judge by the
crowd of book-buyers." For the counters were, indeed, thronged with
customers as I had never seen those of a bookstore before.</p>

<p>"The people at those counters are not purchasers, but borrowers,"
Hamage replied; and then he explained that whereas the old-fashioned
printed book, being handled by the reader, was damaged by use, and
therefore had either to be purchased outright or borrowed at high
rates of hire, the phonograph of a book being not handled, but merely
revolved in a machine, was but little injured by use, and therefore
phonographed books could be lent out for an infinitesimal price.
Everybody had at home a phonograph box of standard size and
adjustments, to which all phonographic cylinders were gauged. I
suggested that the phonograph, at any rate, could scarcely have
replaced picture-books. But here, it seemed, I was mistaken, for it
appeared that illustrations were adapted to phonographed books by the
simple plan of arranging them in a continuous panorama, which by a
connecting gear was made to unroll behind the glass front of the
phonograph case as the course of the narrative demanded.</p>

<p>"But, bless my soul!" I exclaimed, "everybody surely is not
content to borrow their books? They must want to have books of their
own, to keep in their libraries."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Hamage. "What I said about borrowing books
applies only to current literature of the ephemeral sort. Everybody
wants books of permanent value in his library. Over yonder is the
department of the establishment set apart for book-buyers."</p>

<p>The counter which he indicated being less crowded than those of
the borrowing department, I expressed a desire to examine some of the
phonographed books. As we were waiting for attendance, I observed
that some of the customers seemed very particular about their
purchases, and insisted upon testing several phonographs bearing the
same title before making a selection. As the phonographs seemed exact
counterparts in appearance, I did not understand this till Hamage
explained that differences as to style and quality of elocution left
quite as great a range of choice in phonographed books as varieties
in type, paper, and binding did in printed ones. This I presently
found to be the case when the clerk, under Hamage's direction, began
waiting on me. In succession I tried half a dozen editions of
Tennyson by as many different elocutionists, and by the time I had
heard "where Claribel low lieth" rendered by a soprano, a contralto,
a bass, and a baritone, each with the full effect of its quality and
the personal equation besides, I was quite ready to admit that
selecting phonographed books for one's library was as much more
difficult as it was incomparably more fascinating than suiting one's
self with printed editions. Indeed, Hamage admitted that nowadays
nobody with any taste for literature--if the word may for convenience
be retained--thought of contenting himself with less than half a
dozen renderings of the great poets and dramatists.</p>

<p>"By the way," he said to the clerk, "won't you just let my friend
try the Booth-Barrett Company's 'Othello'? It is, you understand," he
added to me, "the exact phonographic reproduction of the play as
actually rendered by the company."</p>

<p>Upon his suggestion, the attendant had taken down a phonograph
case and placed it on the counter. The front was an imitation of a
theatre with the curtain down. As I placed the transmitter to my
ears, the clerk touched a spring and the curtain rolled up,
displaying a perfect picture of the stage in the opening scene.
Simultaneously the action of the play began, as if the pictured men
upon the stage were talking. Here was no question of losing half that
was said and guessing the rest. Not a word, not a syllable, not a
whispered aside of the actors, was lost; and as the play proceeded
the pictures changed, showing every important change of attitude on
the part of the actors. Of course the figures, being pictures, did
not move, but their presentation in so many successive attitudes
presented the effect of movement, and made it quite possible to
imagine that the voices in my ears were really theirs. I am
exceedingly fond of the drama, but the amount of effort and physical
inconvenience necessary to witness a play has rendered my indulgence
in this pleasure infrequent. Others might not have agreed with me,
but I confess that none of the ingenious applications of the
phonograph which I had seen seemed to be so well worth while as
this.</p>

<p>Hamage had left me to make his purchases, and found me on his
return still sitting spellbound.</p>

<p>"Come, come," he said, laughing, "I have Shakespeare complete at
home, and you shall sit up all night, if you choose, hearing plays.
But come along now, I want to take you upstairs before we go."</p>

<p>He had several bundles. One, he told me, was a new novel for his
wife, with some fairy stories for the children,--all, of course,
phonographs. Besides, he had bought an indispensable for his little
boy.</p>

<p>"There is no class," he said, "whose burdens the phonograph has
done so much to lighten as parents. Mothers no longer have to make
themselves hoarse telling the children stories on rainy days to keep
them out of mischief. It is only necessary to plant the most roguish
lad before a phonograph of some nursery classic, to be sure of his
whereabouts and his behavior till the machine runs down, when another
set of cylinders can be introduced, and the entertainment carried on.
As for the babies, Patti sings mine to sleep at bedtime, and, if they
wake up in the night, she is never too drowsy to do it over again.
When the children grow too big to be longer tied to their mother's
apron-strings, they still remain, thanks to the children's
indispensable, though out of her sight, within sound of her voice.
Whatever charges or instructions she desires them not to forget,
whatever hours or duties she would have them be sure to remember, she
depends on the indispensable to remind them of."</p>

<p>At this I cried out. "It is all very well for the mothers," I
said, "but the lot of the orphan must seem enviable to a boy
compelled to wear about such an instrument of his own subjugation. If
boys were what they were in my day, the rate at which their
indispensables would get unaccountably lost or broken would be
alarming."</p>

<p>Hamage laughed, and admitted that the one he was carrying home was
the fourth be had bought for his boy within a month. He agreed with
me that it was hard to see how a boy was to get his growth under
quite so much government; but his wife, and indeed the ladies
generally, insisted that the application of the phonograph to family
government was the greatest invention of the age.</p>

<p>Then I asked a question which had repeatedly occurred to me that
day,--What had become of the printers?</p>

<p>"Naturally," replied Hamage, "they have had a rather hard time of
it. Some classes of books, however, are still printed, and probably
will continue to be for some time, although reading, as well as
writing, is getting to be an increasingly rare accomplishment."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that your schools do not teach reading and writing?"
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they are still taught; but as the pupils need them
little after leaving school,--or even in school, for that matter, all
their text-books being phonographic,--they usually keep the
acquirements about as long as a college graduate does his Greek.
There is a strong movement already on foot to drop reading and
writing entirely from the school course, but probably a compromise
will be made for the present by substituting a shorthand or phonetic
system, based upon the direct interpretation of the sound-waves
themselves. This is, of course, the only logical method for the
visual interpretation of sound. Students and men of research,
however, will always need to understand how to read print, as much of
the old literature will probably never repay phonographing."</p>

<p>"But," I said, "I notice that you still use printed phrases, as
superscriptions, titles, and so forth."</p>

<p>"So we do," replied Hamage, "but phonographic substitutes could be
easily devised in these cases, and no doubt will soon have to be
supplied in deference to the growing number of those who cannot
read."</p>

<p>"Did I understand you," I asked, "that the text-books in your
schools even are phonographs?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Hamage; "our children are taught by
phonographs, recite to phonographs, and are examined by
phonographs."</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" I ejaculated.</p>

<p>"By all means," replied Hamage; "but there is really nothing to be
astonished at. People learn and remember by impressions of sound
instead of sight, that is all. The printer is, by the way, not the
only artisan whose occupation phonography has destroyed. Since the
disuse of print, opticians have mostly gone to the poor-house. The
sense of sight was indeed terribly overburdened previous to the
introduction of the phonograph, and, now that the sense of hearing is
beginning to assume its proper share of work, it would be strange if
an improvement in the condition of the people's eyes were not
noticeable. Physiologists, moreover, promise us not only an improved
vision, but a generally improved physique, especially in respect to
bodily carriage, now that reading, writing, and study no longer
involves, as formerly, the sedentary attitude with twisted spine and
stooping shoulders. The phonograph has at last made it possible to
expand the mind without cramping the body."</p>

<p>"It is a striking comment on the revolution wrought by the general
introduction of the phonograph," I observed, "that whereas the
misfortune of blindness used formerly to be the infirmity which most
completely cut a man off from the world of books, which remained open
to the deaf, the case is now precisely reversed."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hamage, "it is certainly a curious reversal, but not
so complete as you fancy. By the new improvements in the intensifier,
it is expected to enable all, except the stone-deaf, to enjoy the
phonograph, even when connected, as on railroad trains, with a common
telephonic wire. The stone-deaf will of course be dependent upon
printed books prepared for their benefit, as raised-letter books used
to be for the blind."</p>

<p>As we entered the elevator to ascend to the upper floors of the
establishment, Hamage explained that he wanted me to see, before I
left, the process of phonographing books, which was the modern
substitute for printing them. Of course, he said, the phonographs of
dramatic works were taken at the theatres during the representations
of plays, and those of public orations and sermons are either
similarly obtained, or, if a revised version is desired, the orator
re-delivers his address in the improved form to a phonograph; but the
great mass of publications were phonographed by professional
elocutionists employed by the large publishing houses, of which this
was one. He was acquainted with one of these elocutionists, and was
taking me to his room.</p>

<p>We were so fortunate as to find him disengaged. Something, he
said, had broken about the machinery, and he was idle while it was
being repaired. His work-room was an odd kind of place. It was shaped
something like the interior of a rather short egg. His place was on a
sort of pulpit in the middle of the small end, while at the opposite
end, directly before him, and for some distance along the sides
toward the middle, were arranged tiers of phonographs. These were his
audience, but by no means all of it. By telephonic communication he
was able to address simultaneously other congregations of phonographs
in other chambers at any distance. He said that in one instance,
where the demand for a popular book was very great, he had charged
five thousand phonographs at once with it.</p>

<p>I suggested that the saving of printers, pressmen, bookbinders,
and costly machinery, together with the comparative indestructibility
of phonographed as compared with printed books, must make them very
cheap.</p>

<p>"They would be," said Hamage, "if popular elocutionists, such as
Playwell here, did not charge so like fun for their services. The
public has taken it into its head that he is the only first-class
elocutionist, and won't buy anybody else's work. Consequently the
authors stipulate that he shall interpret their productions, and the
publishers, between the public and the authors, are at his
mercy."</p>

<p>Playwell laughed. "I must make my hay while the sun shines," he
said. "Some other elocutionist will be the fashion next year, and
then I shall only get hack-work to do. Besides, there is really a
great deal more work in my business than people will believe. For
example, after I get an author's copy--"</p>

<p>"Written?" I interjected.</p>

<p>"Sometimes it is written phonetically, but most authors dictate to
a phonograph. Well, when I get it, I take it home and study it,
perhaps a couple of days, perhaps a couple of weeks, sometimes, if it
is really an important work, a month or two, in order to get into
sympathy with the ideas, and decide on the proper style of rendering.
All this is hard work, and has to be paid for."</p>

<p>At this point our conversation was broken off by Hamage, who
declared that, if we were to catch the last train out of town before
noon, we had no time to lose.</p>

<p>Of the trip out to Hamage's place I recall nothing. I was, in
fact, aroused from a sound nap by the stopping of the train and the
bustle of the departing passengers. Hamage had disappeared. As I
groped about, gathering up my belongings, and vaguely wondering what
had become of my companion, he rushed into the car, and, grasping my
hand, gave me an enthusiastic welcome. I opened my mouth to demand
what sort of a joke this belated greeting might be intended for, but,
on second thought, I concluded not to raise the point. The fact is,
when I came to observe that the time was not noon, but late in the
evening, and that the train was the one I had left home on, and that
I had not even changed my seat in the car since then, it occurred to
me that Hamage might not understand allusions to the forenoon we had
spent together. Later that same evening, however, the consternation
of my host and hostess at my frequent and violent explosions of
apparently causeless hilarity left me no choice but to make a clean
breast of my preposterous experience. The moral they drew from it was
the charming one that, if I would but oftener come to see them, a
railroad trip would not so upset my wits.</p>
