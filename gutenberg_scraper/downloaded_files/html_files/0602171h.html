<h2>Napoleon and the Spectre</h2>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Charlotte Bront&euml;</h2>

<p align="center"><b>[from the manuscript of the "Green Dwarf" dated
July 10, 1833 - September 2, 1833, and republished in <i>The Twelve
Adventurers and other stories</i>, London, 1925]</b></p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Well, as I was saying, the Emperor got into bed.</p>

<p>"Chevalier," says he to his valet, "let down those
window-curtains, and shut the casement before you leave the
room."</p>

<p>Chevalier did as he was told, and then, taking up his candlestick,
departed.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the Emperor felt his pillow becoming rather hard,
and he got up to shake it. As he did so a slight rustling noise was
heard near the bed-head. His Majesty listened, but all was silent as
he lay down again.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he settled into a peaceful attitude of repose, when
he was disturbed by a sensation of thirst. Lifting himself on his
elbow, he took a glass of lemonade from the small stand which was
placed beside him. He refreshed himself by a deep draught. As he
returned the goblet to its station a deep groan burst from a kind of
closet in one corner of the apartment.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" cried the Emperor, seizing his pistols. "Speak, or
I'll blow your brains out."</p>

<p>This threat produced no other effect than a short, sharp laugh,
and a dead silence followed.</p>

<p>The Emperor started from his couch, and, hastily throwing on a
<i>robe-de-chambre</i> which hung over the back of a chair, stepped
courageously to the haunted closet. As he opened the door something
rustled. He sprang forward sword in hand. No soul or even substance
appeared, and the rustling, it was evident, proceeded from the
falling of a cloak, which had been suspended by a peg from the
door.</p>

<p>Half ashamed of himself he returned to bed.</p>

<p>Just as he was about once more to close his eyes, the light of the
three wax tapers, which burned in a silver branch over the
mantlepiece, was suddenly darkened. He looked up. A black, opaque
shadow obscured it. Sweating with terror, the Emperor put out his
hand to seize the bell- rope, but some invisible being snatched it
rudely from his grasp, and at the same instant the ominous shade
vanished.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" exclaimed Napoleon, "it was but an ocular delusion."</p>

<p>"Was it?" whispered a hollow voice, in deep mysterious tones,
close to his ear. "Was it a delusion, Emperor of France? No! all thou
hast heard and seen is sad forewarning reality. Rise, lifter of the
Eagle Standard! Awake, swayer of the Lily Sceptre! Follow me,
Napoleon, and thou shalt see more."</p>

<p>As the voice ceased, a form dawned on his astonished sight. It was
that of a tall, thin man, dressed in a blue surtout edged with gold
lace. It wore a black cravat very tightly round its neck, and
confined by two little sticks placed behind each ear. The countenance
was livid; the tongue protruded from between the teeth, and the eyes
all glazed and bloodshot started with frightful prominence from their
sockets.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" exclaimed the Emperor, "what do I see? Spectre, whence
cometh thou?"</p>

<p>The apparition spoke not, but gliding forward beckoned Napoleon
with uplifted finger to follow.</p>

<p>Controlled by a mysterious influence, which deprived him of the
capability of either thinking or acting for himself, he obeyed in
silence.</p>

<p>The solid wall of the apartment fell open as they approached, and,
when both had passed through, it closed behind them with a noise like
thunder.</p>

<p>They would now have been in total darkness had it not been for a
dim light which shone round the ghost and revealed the damp walls of
a long, vaulted passage. Down this they proceeded with mute rapidity.
Ere long a cool, refreshing breeze, which rushed wailing up the vault
and caused the Emperor to wrap his loose nightdress closer round,
announced their approach to the open air.</p>

<p>This they soon reached, and Nap found himself in one of the
principal streets of Paris.</p>

<p>"Worthy Spirit," said he, shivering in the chill night air,
"permit me to return and put on some additional clothing. I will be
with you again presently."</p>

<p>"Forward," replied his companion sternly.</p>

<p>He felt compelled, in spite of the rising indignation which almost
choked him, to obey.</p>

<p>On they went through the deserted streets till they arrived at a
lofty house built on the banks of the Seine. Here the Spectre
stopped, the gates rolled back to receive them, and they entered a
large marble hall which was partly concealed by a curtain drawn
across, through the half transparent folds of which a bright light
might be seen burning with dazzling lustre. A row of fine female
figures, richly attired, stood before this screen. They wore on their
heads garlands of the most beautiful flowers, but their faces were
concealed by ghastly masks representing death's-heads.</p>

<p>"What is all this mummery?" cried the Emperor, making an effort to
shake off the mental shackles by which he was so unwillingly
restrained, "Where am I, and why have I been brought here?"</p>

<p>"Silence," said the guide, lolling out still further his black and
bloody tongue. "Silence, if thou wouldst escape instant death."</p>

<p>The Emperor would have replied, his natural courage overcoming the
temporary awe to which he had at first been subjected, but just then
a strain of wild, supernatural music swelled behind the huge curtain,
which waved to and fro, and bellied slowly out as if agitated by some
internal commotion or battle of waving winds. At the same moment an
overpowering mixture of the scents of mortal corruption, blent with
the richest Eastern odours, stole through the haunted hall.</p>

<p>A murmur of many voices was now heard at a distance, and something
grasped his arm eagerly from behind.</p>

<p>He turned hastily round. His eyes met the well-known countenance
of Marie Louise.</p>

<p>"What! are you in this infernal place, too?" said he. "What has
brought you here?"</p>

<p>"Will your Majesty permit me to ask the same question of
yourself?" said the Empress, smiling.</p>

<p>He made no reply; astonishment prevented him.</p>

<p>No curtain now intervened between him and the light. It had been
removed as if by magic, and a splendid chandelier appeared suspended
over his head. Throngs of ladies, richly dressed, but without
death's-head masks, stood round, and a due proportion of gay
cavaliers was mingled with them. Music was still sounding, but it was
seen to proceed from a band of mortal musicians stationed in an
orchestra near at hand. The air was yet redolent of incense, but it
was incense unblended with stench.</p>

<p>"Mon dieu!" cried the Emperor, "how is all this come about? Where
in the world is Piche?"</p>

<p>"Piche?" replied the Empress. "What does your Majesty mean? Had
you not better leave the apartment and retire to rest?"</p>

<p>"Leave the apartment? Why, where am I?"</p>

<p>"In my private drawing-room, surrounded by a few particular
persons of the Court whom I had invited this evening to a ball. You
entered a few minutes since in your nightdress with your eyes fixed
and wide open. I suppose from the astonishment you now testify that
you were walking in your sleep."</p>

<p>The Emperor immediately fell into a fit of catalepsy, in which he
continued during the whole of that night and the greater part of the
next day.</p>
