<p class="note">FOR their honeymoon Rollo Lenox Smeaton Aubrey,
Earl of Redgrave, and his bride, Lilla Zaidie, leave the earth
on a visit to the moon and the principal planets, their sole
companion being Andrew Murgatroyd, an old engineer who had
superintended the building of the Asfronef, in which the journey
is made. By means of the "R. Force," or Anti-Gravitational
Force, of the secret of which Lord Redgrave is the sole
possessor, they are able to navigate with precision and safety
the limitless ocean of space. Their adventures on the Moon,
Mars, and Venus have been described in the first three stories
of the series.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

<p class="first">"FIVE hundred million miles from the earth and
forty-seven million miles from Jupiter," said his lordship, as
he came into breakfast on the morning of the twenty-eighth day
after leaving Venus.</p>

<p>During this brief period the Astronef had recrossed the
orbits of the Earth and Mars and passed through that marvellous
region of the Solar System, the Belt of the Asteroids. Nearly a
hundred million miles of their journey had lain through this
zone, in which hundreds and possibly thousands of tiny planets
revolve in vast orbits round the Sun.</p>

<p>Then had come a desert void of over three hundred million
miles, through which the Astronef voyaged alone, surrounded by
the ever-constant splendours of the Heavens, but visited only
now and then by one of those Spectres of Space, which we call
comets.</p>

<p>Astern, the disc of the Sun steadily diminished, and ahead,
the grey-blue shape of Jupiter, the Giant of the Solar System,
had grown larger and larger until now they could see it as it
had never been seen before&mdash;a gigantic three-quarter moon
filling up the whole Heavens in front of them almost from Zenith
to Nadir.</p>

<p>Its four satellites, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Calisto were
distinctly visible to the naked eye, and Europa and Ganymede
happened to be in such a position with regard to the Astronef
that her crew could see not only the bright sides turned towards
the sun, but also the black shadow-spots which they cast on the
cloud-veiled face of the huge planet.</p>

<p>"Five hundred million miles!" said Zaidie, with a little
shiver, "that seems an awful long way from home, doesn't it?
Though, of course, we've brought our home with us to a certain
extent. Still I often wonder what they are thinking about us on
the dear old earth. I don't suppose anyone ever expects to see
us again. However, it's no good getting homesick in the middle
of a journey when you're outward bound."</p>

<p>They were now falling very rapidly towards the huge planet,
and, as the crescent approached the full they were able to
examine the mysterious bands as human observers had never
examined them before. For hours they sat almost silent at their
telescopes, trying to probe the mystery which has baffled human
science since the days of Gallileo.</p>

<p>"I believe I was right, or, in other words, the people I got
the idea from are," said Redgrave eventually, as they approached
the orbit of Calisto, which revolves at a distance of about
eleven hundred thousand miles from the surface of the
planet.</p>

<p>"Those belts are made of clouds or vapour in some stage or
other. The lightest&mdash;the ones along the equator and what we
should call the Temperate Zones&mdash;are the highest, and
therefore coolest and whitest. The dark ones are the lowest and
hottest. I daresay they are more like what we call volcanic
clouds. Do you see how they keep changing? That's what's
bothered our astronomers. Look at that big one yonder a bit to
the north, going from brown to red. I suppose that's something
like the famous red spot which they have been puzzling about.
What do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Zaidie, looking up from her telescope, "it's
quite certain that the glare must come from underneath. It can't
be sunlight, because the poor old sun doesn't seem to have
strength enough to make a decent sunset or sunrise here, and
look how it's running along to the westward! What does that
mean, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I should say it means that some half-formed Jovian Continent
has been flung sky high by a big burst-up underneath, and that's
the blaze of the incandescent stuff running along. Just fancy a
continent, say ten times the size of Asia, being split up and
sent flying in a few moments like that. Look, there's another
one to the north. On the whole, dear, I don't think we should
find the climate on the other side of those clouds very
salubrious. Still, as they say the atmosphere of Jupiter is
about ten thousand miles thick, we may be able to get near
enough to see something of what's going on.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, here comes Calisto. Look at his shadow flying
across the clouds. And there's Ganymede coming up after him, and
Europa behind him. Talk about eclipses, they must be about as
common here as thunderstorms are with us."</p>

<p>"We don't have a thunderstorm every day," corrected Zaidie,
"but on Jupiter they have two or three eclipses every day.
Meanwhile, there goes Jupiter himself. What a difference
distance makes! This little thing is only a trifle larger than
our moon, and it's hiding everything else."</p>

<p>As she was speaking, the full-orbed disc of Calisto,
measuring nearly three thousand miles across, swept between them
and the planet. It shone with a clear, somewhat reddish light
like that of Mars. The Astronef was feeling its attraction
strongly, and Redgrave went to the levers and turned on about a
fifth of the R. Force to avoid contact with it.</p>

<p>"Another dead world," said Redgrave, as the surface of
Calisto revolved swiftly beneath them, "or, at any rate, a dying
one. There must be an atmosphere of some sort, or else that snow
and ice wouldn't be there, and the land would be either black or
white as it was on the Moon. It's not worth while landing there.
Ganymede will be much more interesting."</p>

<p>Zaidie took half-a-dozen photographs of the surface of
Calisto while they were passing it at a distance of about a
hundred miles, and then went to get lunch ready.</p>

<p>When they got on to the upper deck again Calisto was already
a half-moon in the upper sky nearly five hundred thousand miles
away and the full orb of Ganymede, shining with a pale golden
light, lay outspread beneath them. A thin, bluish-grey arc of
the giant planet over-arched its western edge.</p>

<p>"I think we shall find something like a world here," said
Zaidie, when she had taken her first look through her telescope.
"There's an atmosphere and what looks like thin clouds.
Continents, and oceans, too! And what is that light shining up
between the breaks? Isn't it something like our Aurora?"</p>

<p>As the Astronef fell towards the surface of Ganymede she
crossed its northern pole, and the nearer they got the plainer
it became that a light very like the terrestrial Aurora was
playing about it, illuminating the thin, yellow clouds with a
bluish-violet light, which made magnificent contrasts of
colouring amongst them.</p>

<p>"Let us go down there and see what it's like," said Zaidie.
"There must be something nice under all those lovely
colours."</p>

<p>Redgrave checked the R. Force and the Astronef fell obliquely
across the pole towards the equator. As they approached the
luminous clouds Redgrave turned it on again, and they sank
slowly through a glowing mist of innumerable colours, until the
surface of Ganymede came into plain view about ten miles below
them.</p>

<p>What they saw then was the strangest sight they had beheld
since they had left the Earth. As far as their eyes could reach,
the surface of Ganymede was covered with vast orderly patches,
mostly rectangular, of what they at first took for ice, but
which they soon found to be a something that was
self-illuminating.</p>

<p>"Glorified hot houses, as I'm alive," exclaimed Redgrave.
"Whole cities under glass, fields, too, and lit by electricity
or something very like it. Zaidie, we shall find human beings
down there."</p>

<p>"Well, if we do I hope they won't be like the half-human
things we found on Mars! But isn't it all just lovely! Only
there doesn't seem to be anything outside the cities, at least
nothing but bare, flat ground with a few rugged mountains here
and there. See, there's a nice level plain near the big glass
city, or whatever it is. Suppose we go down there."</p>

<p>Redgrave checked the after-engine which was driving them
obliquely over the surface of the satellite, and the Astronef
fell vertically towards a bare flat plain of what looked like
deep yellow sand, which spread for miles alongside one of the
glittering cities of glass.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, they've seen us!" exclaimed Zaidie. "I do hope
they're going to be as friendly as those dear people on Venus
were."</p>

<p>"I hope so," replied Redgrave, "but if they're not, we've got
the guns ready."</p>

<p>As he said this about twenty streams of an intense bluish
light suddenly shot up all round them, concentrating themselves
upon the hull of the Astronef, which was now about a mile and a
half from the surface. The light was so intense that the rays of
the sun were lost in it. They looked at each other, and found
that their faces were almost perfectly white in it. The plain
and the city below had vanished.</p>

<p>To look downwards was like staring straight into the focus of
a ten thousand candlepower electric arc lamp. It was so
intolerable that Redgrave closed the lower shutters, and
meanwhile he found that the Astronef had ceased to descend. He
shut off more of the R. force, but it produced no effect. The
Astronef remained stationary. Then he ordered Murgatroyd to set
the propellers in motion. The engineer pulled the starting
levers, and then came up out of the engine-room and said to Lord
Redgrave:</p>

<p>"It's no good my lord; I don't know what devil's world we've
got into now, but they won't work. If I thought that engines
could be bewitched-&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Andrew!" said his lordship rather testily.
"It's perfectly simple; those people down there, whoever they
are, have got some way of demagnetising us, or else they've got
the R. force too, and they're applying it against us to stop us
going down. Apparently they don't want us. No, that's just to
show us that they can stop us if they want to. The light's going
down. Begin dropping a bit. Don't start the propellers, but just
go and see that the guns are all right in case of
accidents."</p>

<p>The old engineer nodded and went back to his engines, looking
considerably scared. As he spoke the brilliancy of the light
faded rapidly and the Astronef began to sink towards the
surface.</p>

<p>As a precaution against their being allowed to drop with
force enough to cause a disaster, Redgrave turned the R. Force
on again and they dropped slowly towards the plain, through what
seemed like a halo of perfectly white light. When she was within
a couple of hundred yards of the ground a winged car of
exquisitely graceful shape, rose from the roof of one of the
huge glass buildings nearest to them, flew swiftly towards them,
and after circling once round the dome of the upper deck, ran
close alongside.</p>

<p>The car was occupied by two figures of distinctly human form
but rather more than human stature. Both were dressed in long,
close-fitting garments of what seemed like a golden brown
fleece. Their heads were covered with a close hood and their
hands with thin, close-fitting gloves.</p>

<p>"What an exceedingly handsome man!" said Zaidie, as one of
them stood up. "I never saw such a noble-looking face in my
life; it's half philosopher, half saint. Of course, you won't be
jealous."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" he laughed. "It would be quite impossible to
imagine you in love with either. But he is handsome, and
evidently friendly&mdash; there's no mistaking that. Answer him,
Zaidie; you can do it better than I can." The car had now come
close alongside. The standing figure stretched its hands out,
palms upward, smiled a smile which Zaidie thought was very
sweetly solemn, next the head was bowed, and the gloved hands
brought back and crossed over his breast. Zaidie imitated the
movements exactly. Then, as the figure raised its head, she
raised hers, and she found herself looking into a pair of large
luminous eyes, such as she could have imagined under the brows
of an angel. As they met hers, a look of unmistakable wonder and
admiration came into them. Redgrave was standing just behind
her; she took him by the hand and drew him beside her, saying
with a little laugh:</p>

<p>"Now, please look as pleasant as you can; I am sure they are
very friendly. A man with a face like that couldn't mean any
harm."</p>

<p>The figure repeated the motions to Redgrave, who returned
them, perhaps a trifle awkwardly. Then the car began to descend,
and the figure beckoned to them to follow.</p>

<p>"You'd better go and wrap up, dear. From the gentleman's
dress it seems pretty cold outside, though the air is evidently
quite breathable," said Redgrave, as the Astronef began to drop
in company with the car. "At any rate, I'll try it first, and,
if it isn't, we can put on our breathing-dresses."</p>

<p>When Zaidie had made her winter toilet, and Redgrave had
found the air to be quite respirable, but of Arctic cold, they
went down the gangway ladder about twenty minutes later.</p>

<p>The figure had got out of the car which was lying a few yards
from them on the sandy plain, and came forward to meet them with
both hands outstretched.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption">The figure... came forward to meet them with
both hands outstretched.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Zaidie unhesitatingly held out hers, and a strange thrill ran
through her as she felt them for the first time clasped gently
by other than earthly hands, for the Venus folk had only been
able to pat and stroke with their gentle little paws, somewhat
as a kitten might do. The figure bowed its head again and said
something in a low, melodious voice, which was, of course, quite
unintelligible save for the evident friendliness of its tone.
Then, releasing her hands, he took Redgrave's in the same
fashion, and then led the way towards a vast, domed building of
semi-opaque glass, or a substance which seemed to be something
like a mixture of glass and mica, which appeared to be one of
the entrance gates of the city.</p>

<p>When they reached it a huge sheet of frosted glass rose
silently from the ground. They passed through, and it fell
behind them. They found themselves in a great oval antechamber
along each side of which stood triple rows of strangely shaped
trees whose leaves gave off a subtle and most agreeable scent.
The temperature here was several degrees higher, in fact about
that of an English spring day, and Zaidie immediately threw open
her big fur cloak saying:</p>

<p>"These good people seem to live in Winter Gardens, don't
they? I don't think I shall want these things much while we're
inside. I wonder what dear old Andrew would have thought of this
if we could have persuaded him to leave the ship."</p>

<p>They followed their host through the antechamber towards a
magnificent pointed arch, raised on clusters of small pillars
each of a different coloured, highly polished stone which shone
brilliantly in a light which seemed to come from nowhere.
Another door, this time of pale, transparent, blue glass, rose
as they approached; they passed under it and, as it fell behind
them, half-a-dozen figures, considerably shorter and slighter
than their host, came forward to meet them. He took off his
gloves and cape and thick outer covering, and they were glad to
follow his example for the atmosphere was now that of a warm
June day.</p>

<p>The attendants, as they evidently were, took their wraps from
them, looking at the furs and stroking them with evident wonder;
but with nothing like the wonder which came into their wild,
soft grey eyes when they looked at Zaidie, who, as usual when
she arrived on a new world, was arrayed in one of her daintiest
costumes.</p>

<p>Their host was now dressed in a tunic of a light blue
material, which glistened with a lustre greater than that of the
finest silk. It reached a little below his knees, and was
confined at the waist by a sash of the same colour hut of
somewhat deeper hue. His feet and legs were covered with
stockings of the same material and colour, and his feet, which
were small for his stature and exquisitely shaped, were shod
with thin sandals of a material which looked like soft felt, and
which made no noise as he walked over the delicately coloured
mosaic pavement of the street&mdash;for such it actually
was&mdash;which ran past the gate.</p>

<p>When he removed his cap they expected to find that he was
bald like the Martians, but they were mistaken. His well-shaped
head was covered with long, thick hair of a colour something
between bronze and grey. A broad band of metal, looking like
light gold, passed round the upper part of his forehead, and
from under this the hair fell in gentle waves to below his
shoulders.</p>

<p>For a few moments Zaidie and Redgrave stared about them in
frank and silent wonder. They were standing in a broad street
running in a straight line, apparently several miles, along the
edge of a city of crystal. It was lined with double rows of
trees with beds of brilliantly coloured flowers between them.
From this street others went off at right angles and at regular
intervals. The roof of the city appeared to be composed of an
infinity of domes of enormous extent, supported by tall clusters
of slender pillars standing at the street corners.</p>

<p>Presently their host touched Redgrave on the shoulder and
pointed to a four-wheeled car of light framework and exquisite
design, containing seats for four besides the driver, or guide,
who sat behind. He held out his hand to Zaidie, and handed her
to one of the front seats just as an earth-born gentleman might
have done. Then he motioned to Redgrave to sit beside her, and
mounted behind them.</p>

<p>The car immediately began to move silently, but with
considerable speed, along the left-hand side of the outer
street, which, like all the others, was divided by narrow strips
of russet-coloured grass and flowering shrubs.</p>

<p>In a few minutes it swung round to the right, crossed the
road, and entered a magnificent avenue, which, after a run of
some four miles, ended in a vast, park-like square, measuring at
least a mile each way.</p>

<p>The two sides of the avenue were busy with cars like their
own, some carrying six people, and others only the driver. Those
on each side of the road all went in the same direction. Those
nearest to the broad side-walks between the houses and the first
row of trees went at a moderate speed of five or six miles an
hour, but along the inner sides, near the central line of trees,
they seemed to be running as high as thirty miles an hour. Their
occupants were nearly all dressed in clothes made of the same
glistening, silky fabric as their host wore, but the colourings
were of infinite variety. It was quite easy to distinguish
between the sexes, although in stature they were almost
equal.</p>

<p>The men were nearly all clothed as their host was. The women
were dressed in flowing garments something after the Greek
style, but they were of brighter hues, and much more lavishly
embroidered than the men's tunics were. They also wore much more
jewellery. Indeed, some of the younger ones glittered from head
to foot with polished metal and gleaming stones.</p>

<p class="caption">The women were dressed in flowing

</div>

<br>

<p>"Could anyone ever have dreamt of such a lovely place?" said
Zaidie, after their wondering eyes had become accustomed to the
marvels about them, "and yet&mdash;oh dear, now I know what it
reminds me of! Flammarion's book, 'The End Of The World,' where
he describes the remnants of the human race dying of cold and
hunger on the Equator in places something like this. I suppose
the life of poor Ganymede is giving out, and that's why they've
got to live in glorified Crystal Palaces like this, poor
things."</p>

<p>"Poor things!" laughed Redgrave, "I'm afraid I can't agree
with you there, dear. I never saw a jollier looking lot of
people in my life. I daresay you're quite right, but they
certainly seem to view their approaching end with considerable
equanimity."</p>

<p>"Don't be horrid, Lenox! Fancy talking in that cold-blooded
way about such delightful-looking people as these, why, they are
even nicer than our dear bird-folk on Venus, and, of course,
they are a great deal more like ourselves."</p>

<p>"Wherefore it stands to reason that they must be a great deal
nicer!" he replied, with a glance which brought a brighter flush
to her cheeks. Then he went on: "Ah, now I see the
difference."</p>

<p>"What difference? Between what?"</p>

<p>"Between the daughter of Earth and the daughters of
Ganymede," he replied. "You can blush, and I don't think they
can. Haven't you noticed that, although they have the most
exquisite skins and beautiful eyes and hair and all that sort of
thing, not a man or woman of them has any colouring. I suppose
that's the result of living for generations in a hothouse."</p>

<p>"Very likely," she said; "but has it struck you also that all
the girls and women are either beautiful or handsome, and all
the men, except the ones who seem to be servants or slaves, are
something like Greek gods, or, at least, the sort of men you see
on the Greek sculptures?"</p>

<p>"Survival of the fittest, I presume. These will be the
descendants of the highest races of Ganymede,&mdash;the people
who conceived the idea of prolonging human life like this and
were able to carry it out. The inferior races would either
perish of starvation or become their servants. That's what will
happen on Earth, and there is no reason why it shouldn't have
happened here."</p>

<p>As he said this the car swung out round a broad curve into
the centre of the great square, and a little cry of amazement
broke from Zaidie's lips as her glance roamed over the
multiplying splendours about her.</p>

<p>In the centre of the square, in the midst of smooth lawns and
flower beds of every conceivable shape and colour, and groves of
flowering trees, stood a great, domed building, which they
approached through an avenue of overarching trees interlaced
with flowering creepers.</p>

<p>The car stopped at the foot of a triple flight of stairs of
dazzling whiteness which led up to a broad, arched doorway.
Several groups of people were sprinkled about the avenue and
steps and the wide terrace which ran along the front of the
building. They looked with keen, but perfectly well-mannered
surprise at their strange visitors, and seemed to be discussing
their appearance; but not a step was taken towards them nor was
there the slightest sign of anything like vulgar curiosity.</p>

<p>"What perfect manners these dear people have!" said Zaidie,
as they dismounted at the foot of the staircase. "I wonder what
would happen if a couple of them were to be landed from a motor
car in front of the Capitol at Washington. I suppose this is
their Capitol, and we've been brought here to be put through our
facings. What a pity we can't talk to them. I wonder if they'd
believe our story if we could tell it."</p>

<p>"I've no doubt they know something of it already," replied
Redgrave;" they're evidently people of immense intelligence.
Intellectually, I daresay, we're mere children compared with
them, and it's quite possible that they have developed senses of
which we have no idea."</p>

<p>"And perhaps," added Zaidie, "all the time that we are
talking to each other our friend here is quietly reading
everything that is going on in our minds."</p>

<p>Whether this was so or not their host gave no sign of
comprehension. He led them up the steps and through the great
doorway where he was met by three splendidly dressed men even
taller than himself.</p>

<p>"I feel beastly shabby among all these gorgeously attired
personages," said Redgrave, looking down at his plain tweed
suit, as they were conducted with every manifestation of
politeness along the magnificent vestibule beyond.</p>

<p>At the end of the vestibule another door opened, and they
were ushered into a large hall which was evidently a
council-chamber. At the further end of it were three semicircular
rows of seats made of the polished silvery metal, and in the centre
and raised slightly above them another under a canopy of sky-blue
silk. This seat and six others were occupied by men of most
venerable aspect, in spite of the fact that their hair was just
as long and thick and glossy as their host's or even as Zaidie's
own.</p>

<p>The ceremony of introduction was exceedingly simple. Though
they could not, of course, understand a word he said, it was
evident from his eloquent gestures that their host described the
way in which they had come from Space, and landed on the surface
of the World of the Crystal Cities, as Zaidie subsequently
rechristened Ganymede.</p>

in a deep musical tone. Then their host, taking their hands, led
them up to his seat, and the President rose and took them by
both hands in turn. Then, with a grave smile of greeting, he
bent his head and resumed his seat. They joined hands in turn
with each of the six senators present, bowed their farewells in
silence, and then went back with their host to the car.</p>

<p>They ran down the avenue, made a curving sweep round to the
left&mdash; for all the paths in the great square were laid in
curves, apparently to form a contrast to the straight
streets&mdash;and presently stopped before the porch of one of
the hundred palaces which surrounded it. This was their host's
house, and their home during the rest of their sojourn on
Ganymede.</p>

<p>It is, as I have already said, greatly to be regretted that
the narrow limits of these brief narratives make it impossible
for me to describe in detail all the experiences of Lord
Redgrave and his bride during their Honeymoon in Space.
Hereafter I hope to have an opportunity of doing so with the
more ample assistance of her ladyship's diary; but for the
present I must content myself with the outlines of the picture
which she may some day consent to fill in.</p>

<p>The period of Ganymede's revolution round its gigantic
primary is seven days, three hours, and forty-three minutes,
practically a terrestrial week, and both of the daring
navigators of Space describe this as the most interesting and
delightful week in their lives, not even excepting the period
which they spent in the Eden of the Morning Star.</p>

<p>There the inhabitants had never learnt to sin; here they had
learnt the lesson that sin is mere foolishness, and that no
really sensible or properly educated man or woman thinks crime
worth committing.</p>

<p>The life of the Crystal Cities, of which they visited four in
different parts of the satellite, using the Astronef as their
vehicle, was one of peaceful industry and calm innocent
enjoyment. It was quite plain that their first impressions of
this aged world were correct. Outside the cities spread a
universal desert on which life was impossible. There was hardly
any moisture in the thin atmosphere. The rivers had dwindled
into rivulets and the seas into vast, shallow marshes. The heat
received from the Sun was only about a twenty-fifth of that
received on the surface of the Earth, and this was drawn to the
cities and collected and preserved under their glass domes by a
number of devices which displayed superhuman intelligence.</p>

<p>The dwindling supplies of water were hoarded in vast
subterranean reservoirs and by means of a perfect system of
redistillation the priceless fluid was used over and over again
both for human purposes and for irrigating the land within the
cities.</p>

<p>Still the total quantity was steadily diminishing, for it was
not only evaporating from the surface, but, as the orb cooled
more and more rapidly towards its centre, it descended deeper
and deeper below the surface, and could now only be reached by
means of marvellously constructed borings and pumping machinery
which extended down several miles into the ground.</p>

<p>The dwindling store of heat in the centre of the little
world, which had now cooled through more than half its bulk, was
utilised for warming the air of the cities, and also to drive
the machinery which propelled it through the streets and
squares. All work was done by electricity developed directly
from this source, which also actuated the repulsive engines
which had prevented the Astronef from descending.</p>

<p>In short, the inhabitants of Ganymede were engaged in a
steady, ceaseless struggle to utilise the expiring natural
forces of their world to prolong to the latest possible date
their own lives and the exquisitely refined civilisation to
which they had attained. They were, in fact, in exactly the same
position in which the distant descendants of the human race may
one day be expected to find themselves.</p>

<p>Their domestic life, as Zaidie and Lenox saw it while they
were the guests of their host, was the perfection of simplicity
and comfort, and their public life was characterised by a quiet
but intense intellectuality which, as Zaidie had said, made them
feel very much like children who had only just learnt to
speak.</p>

<p>As they possessed magnificent telescopes, far surpassing any
on earth, the wanderers were able to survey, not only the Solar
System, but the other systems far beyond its limits as no other
of their kind had ever been able to do before. They did not look
through or into the telescopes. The lens was turned upon the
object, which was thrown, enormously magnified, upon screens of
what looked something like ground glass some fifty feet square.
It was thus that they saw, not only the whole visible surface of
Jupiter as he revolved above them and they about him, but also
their native earth, sometimes a pale silver disc or crescent
close to the edge of the Sun, visible only in the morning and
the evening of Jupiter, and at other times like a little black
spot crossing the glowing surface.</p>

<p>It was, of course, inevitable that the Astronef&mdash;which
Murgatroyd could not be persuaded to leave once during their
stay&mdash;should prove an object of intense interest to their
hosts. They had solved the problem of the Resolution of Forces,
and, as they were shown pictorially, a vessel had been made
which embodied the principles of attraction and repulsion. It
had risen from the surface of Ganymede, and then, possibly
because its engines could not develop sufficient repulsive
force, the tremendous pull of the giant planet had dragged it
away. It had vanished through the cloud-belts towards the
flaming surface beneath&mdash;and the experiment had never been
repeated.</p>

<p>Here, however, was a vessel which had actually, as Redgrave
had convinced his hosts by means of celestial maps and drawings
of his own, left a planet close to the Sun, and safely crossed
the tremendous gulf of six hundred and fifty million miles which
separated Jupiter from the centre of the system. Moreover he had
twice proved her powers by taking his host and two of his
newly-made friends, the chief astronomers of Ganymede, on a short
trip across space to Calisto and Europa, the second satellite of
Jupiter, which, to their very grave interest they found had
already passed the stage in which Ganymede was, and had lapsed
into the icy silence of death.</p>

<p>It was these two journeys which led to the last adventure of
the Astronef in the Jovian System. Both Redgrave and Zaidie had
determined, at whatever risk, to pass through the cloud-belts of
Jupiter, and catch a glimpse, if only a glimpse, of a world in
the making. Their host and the two astronomers, after a certain
amount of quiet discussion, accepted their invitation to
accompany them, and on the morning of the eighth day after their
landing on Ganymede, the Astronef rose from the plain outside
the Crystal City, and directed her course towards the centre of
the vast disc of Jupiter.</p>

<p>She was followed by the telescopes of all the observatories
until she vanished through the brilliant cloud-band, eighty-five
thousand miles long and some five thousand miles broad, which
stretched from east to west of the planet. At the same moment
the voyagers lost sight of Ganymede and his sister
satellites.</p>

<p>The temperature of the interior of the Astronef began to rise
as soon as the upper cloud-belt was passed. Under this, spread
out a vast field of brown-red cloud, rent here and there into
holes and gaps like those storm-cavities in the atmosphere of
the Sun, which are commonly known as sun-spots. This lower
stratum of cloud appeared to be the scene of terrific storms,
compared with which the fiercest earthly tempests were mere
zephyrs.</p>

<p>After falling some five hundred miles further they found
themselves surrounded by what seemed an ocean of fire, but still
the internal temperature had only risen from seventy to
ninety-five. The engines were well under control. Only about a
fourth of the total R. Force was being developed, and the Astronef
was dropping swiftly, but steadily.</p>

<p>Redgrave, who was in the conning-tower controlling the
engines, beckoned to Zaidie and said:</p>

<p>"Shall we go on?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Now we've got as far as this I want to see
what Jupiter is like, and where you are not afraid to go, I'll
go."</p>

<p>"If I'm afraid at all it's only because you are with me,
Zaidie," he replied, "but I've only got a fourth of the power
turned on yet, so there's plenty of margin."</p>

<p>The Astronef, therefore, continued to sink through what
seemed to be a fathomless ocean of whirling, blazing clouds, and
the internal temperature went on rising slowly but steadily.
Their guests, without showing the slightest sign of any emotion,
walked about the upper deck now singly and now together,
apparently absorbed by the strange scene about them.</p>

<p>At length, after they had been dropping for some five hours
by Astronef time, one of them, uttering a sharp exclamation,
pointed to an enormous rift about fifty miles away. A dull, red
glare was streaming up out of it. The next moment the brown
cloud-floor beneath them seemed to split up into enormous
wreaths of vapour, which whirled up on all sides of them, and a
few minutes later they caught their first glimpse of the true
surface of Jupiter.</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>It lay as nearly as they could judge, some two thousand miles
beneath them, a distance which the telescopes reduced to less
than twenty; and they saw for a few moments the world that was
in the making. Through floating seas of misty steam they beheld
what seemed to them to be vast continents shape themselves and
melt away into oceans of flames. Whole mountain ranges of
glowing lava were hurled up miles high to take shape for an
instant and then fall away again, leaving fathomless gulfs of
fiery mist in their place.</p>

<p>Then waves of molten matter rose up again out of the gulfs,
tens of miles high and hundreds of miles long, surged forward,
and met with a concussion like that of millions of earthly
thunder-clouds. Minute after minute they remained writhing and
struggling with each other. flinging up spurts of flaming matter
far above their crests. Other waves followed them, climbing up
their bases as a sea-surge runs up the side of a smooth,
slanting rock. Then from the midst of them a jet of living fire
leapt up hundreds of miles into the lurid atmosphere above, and
then, with a crash and a roar which shook the vast Jovian
firmament, the battling lava-waves would split apart and sink
down into the all-surrounding fire-ocean, like two grappling
giants who had strangled each other in their final struggle.</p>

<p>"It's just Hell let loose!" said Murgatroyd to himself as he
looked down upon the terrific scene through one of the portholes
of the engine-room; "and, with all respect to my lord and her
ladyship, those that come this near almost deserve to stop in
it."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Redgrave and Zaidie and their three guests were so
absorbed in the tremendous spectacle, that for a few moments no
one noticed that they were dropping faster and faster towards
the world which Murgatroyd, according to his lights, had not
inaptly described. As for Zaidie, all her fears were for the
time being lost in wonder, until she saw her husband take a
swift glance round upwards and downwards, and then go up into
the conning-tower. She followed him quickly, and said:</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Lenox, are we falling too quickly?"</p>

<p>"Much faster than we should," he replied, sending a signal to
Murgatroyd to increase the force by three-tenths.</p>

<p>The answering signal came back, but still the Astronef
continued to fall with terrific rapidity, and the awful
landscape beneath them&mdash;a landscape of fire and
chaos&mdash;broadened out and became more and more distinct.</p>

<p>He sent two more signals down in quick succession.
Three-fourths of the whole repulsive power of the engines was now
being exerted, a force which would have been sufficient to hurl
the Astronef up from the surface of the Earth like a feather in
a whirlwind. Her downward course became a little slower, but
still she did not stop. Zaidie, white to the lips, looked down
upon the hideous scene beneath and slipped her hand through
Redgrave's arm. He looked at her for an instant and then turned
his head away with a jerk, and sent down the last signal.</p>

<p>The whole energy of the engines was now directing the maximum
of the R. Force against the surface of Jupiter, but still, as
every moment passed in a speechless agony of apprehension, it
grew nearer and nearer. The fire-waves mounted higher and
higher, the roar of the fiery surges grew louder and louder.
Then, in a momentary lull, he put his arm round her, drew her
close up to him, and kissed her and said:</p>

<p>"That's all we can do, dear. We've come too close and he's
too strong for us."</p>

<p>She returned his kiss and said quite steadily:</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, I'm with you, and it won't last long,
will it?"</p>

<p>"Not very long now, I'm afraid," he said between his clenched
teeth.</p>

<p>Almost the next moment they felt a little jerk beneath their
feet&mdash; a jerk upwards; and Redgrave shook himself out of
the half stupor into which he was falling and said:</p>

<p>"Hallo, what's that! I believe we're stopping&mdash;yes, we
are&mdash; and we're beginning to rise, too. Look, dear, the
clouds are coming down upon us&mdash;fast too! I wonder what
sort of miracle that is. Ay, what's the matter, little
woman?"</p>

<p>Zaidie's head had dropped heavily on his shoulder. A glance
showed him that she had fainted. He could do nothing more in the
conning-tower, so he picked her up and carried her towards the
companion-way, past his three guests, who were standing in the
middle of the upper deck round a table on which lay a large
sheet of paper.</p>

<p>He took her below and laid her on her bed, and in a few
minutes he had brought her to and told her that it was all
right. Then he gave her a drink of brandy and water, and went
hack on to the upper deck. As he reached the top of the stairway
one of the astronomers came towards him with the sheet of paper
in his hand, smiling gravely, and pointing to a sketch upon
it.</p>

<p>He took the paper under one of the electric lights and looked
at it. The sketch was a plan of the Jovian System. There were
some signs written along one side, which he did not understand,
but he divined that they were calculations. Still, there was no
mistaking the diagram. There was a circle representing the huge
bulk of Jupiter; there were four smaller circles at varying
distances in a nearly straight line from it, and between the
nearest of these and the planet was the figure of the Astronef,
with an arrow pointing upwards.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see!" he said, forgetting for a moment that the other
did not understand him, "That was the miracle! The four
satellites came into line with us just as the pull of Jupiter
was getting too much for our engines, and their combined pull
just turned the scale. Well, thank God for that, sir, for in a
few minutes more we should have been cinders!"</p>

<p>The astronomer smiled again as he took the paper back.
Meanwhile the Astronef was rushing upward like a meteor through
the clouds. In ten minutes the limits of the Jovian atmosphere
were passed. Stars and gems and planets blazed out of the black
vault of Space, and the great disc of the World that Is to Be
once more covered the floor of Space beneath them&mdash;an ocean
of cloud, covering continents of lava and seas of flame.</p>

<p>They passed Io and Europa, which changed from new to full
moons as they sped by towards the Sun, and then the golden
yellow crescent of Ganymede also began to fill out to the half
and full disc, and by the tenth hour of earth-time after they
had risen from its surface, the Astronef was once more lying
beside the gate of the Crystal City.</p>

<p>At midnight on the second night after their return, the
ringed shape of Saturn, attended by his eight satellites, hung
in the zenith magnificently inviting. The Astronef's engines had
been replenished after the exhaustion of their struggle with the
might of Jupiter. Zaidie and Lenox said farewell to their
friends of the dying world. The doors of the air chamber closed.
The signal tinkled in the engine-room, and a few moments later a
blur of white lights on the brown background of the surrounding
desert was all they could distinguish of the Crystal City under
whose domes they had seen and learnt so much.</p>
