<h1>The Mortal Immortal</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Mary Shelley</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>July 16, 1833.--This is a memorable anniversary for me; on it I
complete my three hundred and twenty-third year!</p>

<p>The Wandering Jew?--certainly not. More than eighteen centuries have
passed over his head. In comparison with him, I am a very young
Immortal.</p>

<p>Am I, then, immortal? This is a question which I have asked myself,
by day and night, for now three hundred and three years, and yet cannot
answer it. I detected a grey hair amidst my brown locks this very
day--that surely signifies decay. Yet it may have remained concealed
there for three hundred years--for some persons have become entirely
white-headed before twenty years of age.</p>

<p>I will tell my story, and my reader shall judge for me. I will tell
my story, and so contrive to pass some few hours of a long eternity,
become so wearisome to me. For ever! Can it be? to live for ever! I
have heard of enchantments, in which the victims were plunged into a
deep sleep, to wake, after a hundred years, as fresh as ever: I have
heard of the Seven Sleepers--thus to be immortal would not be so
burthensome: but, oh! the weight of never-ending time--the tedious
passage of the still-succeeding hours! How happy was the fabled
Nourjahad!--But to my task.</p>

<p>All the world has heard of Cornelius Agrippa. His memory is as
immortal as his arts have made me. All the world has also heard of his
scholar, who, unawares, raised the foul fiend during his master's
absence, and was destroyed by him. The report, true or false, of this
accident, was attended with many inconveniences to the renowned
philosopher. All his scholars at once deserted him--his servants
disappeared. He had no one near him to put coals on his ever-burning
fires while he slept, or to attend to the changeful colours of his
medicines while he studied. Experiment after experiment failed, because
one pair of hands was insufficient to complete them: the dark spirits
laughed at him for not being able to retain a single mortal in his
service.</p>

<p>I was then very young--very poor--and very much in love. I had been
for about a year the pupil of Cornelius, though I was absent when this
accident took place. On my return, my friends implored me not to return
to the alchymist's abode. I trembled as I listened to the dire tale
they told; I required no second warning; and when Cornelius came and
offered me a purse of gold if I would remain under his roof, I felt as
if Satan himself tempted me. My teeth chattered--my hair stood on
end;--I ran off as fast as my trembling knees would permit.</p>

<p>My failing steps were directed whither for two years they had every
evening been attracted,--a gently bubbling spring of pure living water,
beside which lingered a dark-haired girl, whose beaming eyes were fixed
on the path I was accustomed each night to tread. I cannot remember the
hour when I did not love Bertha; we had been neighbours and playmates
from infancy,--her parents, like mine were of humble life, yet
respectable,--our attachment had been a source of pleasure to them. In
an evil hour, a malignant fever carried off both her father and mother,
and Bertha became an orphan. She would have found a home beneath my
paternal roof, but, unfortunately, the old lady of the near castle,
rich, childless, and solitary, declared her intention to adopt her.
Henceforth Bertha was clad in silk--inhabited a marble palace--and was
looked on as being highly favoured by fortune. But in her new situation
among her new associates, Bertha remained true to the friend of her
humbler days; she often visited the cottage of my father, and when
forbidden to go thither, she would stray towards the neighbouring wood,
and meet me beside its shady fountain.</p>

<p>She often declared that she owed no duty to her new protectress
equal in sanctity to that which bound us. Yet still I was too poor to
marry, and she grew weary of being tormented on my account. She had a
haughty but an impatient spirit, and grew angry at the obstacle that
prevented our union. We met now after an absence, and she had been
sorely beset while I was away; she complained bitterly, and almost
reproached me for being poor. I replied hastily,--</p>

<p>"I am honest, if I am poor!--were I not, I might soon become
rich!"</p>

<p>This exclamation produced a thousand questions. I feared to shock
her by owning the truth, but she drew it from me; and then, casting a
look of disdain on me, she said,--</p>

<p>"You pretend to love, and you fear to face the Devil for my
sake!"</p>

<p>I protested that I had only dreaded to offend her;--while she dwelt
on the magnitude of the reward that I should receive. Thus
encouraged--shamed by her--led on by love and hope, laughing at my
later fears, with quick steps and a light heart, I returned to accept
the offers of the alchymist, and was instantly installed in my
office.</p>

<p>A year passed away. I became possessed of no insignificant sum of
money. Custom had banished my fears. In spite of the most painful
vigilance, I had never detected the trace of a cloven foot; nor was the
studious silence of our abode ever disturbed by demoniac howls. I still
continued my stolen interviews with Bertha, and Hope dawned on
me--Hope--but not perfect joy: for Bertha fancied that love and
security were enemies, and her pleasure was to divide them in my bosom.
Though true of heart, she was something of a coquette in manner; I was
jealous as a Turk. She slighted me in a thousand ways, yet would never
acknowledge herself to be in the wrong. She would drive me mad with
anger, and then force me to beg her pardon. Sometimes she fancied that
I was not sufficiently submissive, and then she had some story of a
rival, favoured by her protectress. She was surrounded by silk-clad
youths--the rich and gay. What chance had the sad-robed scholar of
Cornelius compared with these?</p>

<p>On one occasion, the philosopher made such large demands upon my
time, that I was unable to meet her as I was wont. He was engaged in
some mighty work, and I was forced to remain, day and night, feeding
his furnaces and watching his chemical preparations. Bertha waited for
me in vain at the fountain. Her haughty spirit fired at this neglect;
and when at last I stole out during a few short minutes allotted to me
for slumber, and hoped to be consoled by her, she received me with
disdain, dismissed me in scorn, and vowed that any man should possess
her hand rather than he who could not be in two places at once for her
sake. She would be revenged! And truly she was. In my dingy retreat I
heard that she had been hunting, attended by Albert Hoffer. Albert
Hoffer was favoured by her protectress, and the three passed in
cavalcade before my smoky window. Methought that they mentioned my
name; it was followed by a laugh of derision, as her dark eyes glanced
contemptuously towards my abode.</p>

<p>Jealousy, with all its venom and all its misery, entered my breast.
Now I shed a torrent of tears, to think that I should never call her
mine; and, anon, I imprecated a thousand curses on her inconstancy.
Yet, still I must stir the fires of the alchymist, still attend on the
changes of his unintelligible medicines.</p>

<p>Cornelius had watched for three days and nights, nor closed his
eyes. The progress of his alembics was slower than he expected: in
spite of his anxiety, sleep weighted upon his eyelids. Again and again
he threw off drowsiness with more than human energy; again and again it
stole away his senses. He eyed his crucibles wistfully. "Not ready
yet," he murmured; "will another night pass before the work is
accomplished? Winzy, you are vigilant--you are faithful--you have
slept, my boy--you slept last night. Look at that glass vessel. The
liquid it contains is of a soft rose-colour: the moment it begins to
change hue, awaken me--till then I may close my eyes. First, it will
turn white, and then emit golden flashes; but wait not till then; when
the rose-colour fades, rouse me." I scarcely heard the last words,
muttered, as they were, in sleep. Even then he did not quite yield to
nature. "Winzy, my boy," he again said, "do not touch the vessel--do
not put it to your lips; it is a philtre--a philtre to cure love; you
would not cease to love your Bertha--beware to drink!"</p>

<p>And he slept. His venerable head sunk on his breast, and I scarce
heard his regular breathing. For a few minutes I watched the
vessel--the rosy hue of the liquid remained unchanged. Then my thoughts
wandered--they visited the fountain, and dwelt on a thousand charming
scenes never to be renewed--never! Serpents and adders were in my heart
as the word "Never!" half formed itself on my lips. False girl!--false
and cruel! Never more would she smile on me as that evening she smiled
on Albert. Worthless, detested woman! I would not remain
unrevenged--she should see Albert expire at her feet--she should die
beneath my vengeance. She had smiled in disdain and triumph--she knew
my wretchedness and her power. Yet what power had she?--the power of
exciting my hate--my utter scorn--my--oh, all but indifference! Could I
attain that--could I regard her with careless eyes, transferring my
rejected love to one fairer and more true, that were indeed a
victory!</p>

<p>A bright flash darted before my eyes. I had forgotten the medicine
of the adept; I gazed on it with wonder: flashes of admirable beauty,
more bright than those which the diamond emits when the sun's rays are
on it, glanced from the surface of the liquid; and odour the most
fragrant and grateful stole over my sense; the vessel seemed one globe
of living radiance, lovely to the eye, and most inviting to the taste.
The first thought, instinctively inspired by the grosser sense, was, I
will--I must drink. I raised the vessel to my lips. "It will cure me of
love--of torture!" Already I had quaffed half of the most delicious
liquor ever tasted by the palate of man, when the philosopher stirred.
I started--I dropped the glass--the fluid flamed and glanced along the
floor, while I felt Cornelius's gripe at my throat, as he shrieked
aloud, "Wretch! you have destroyed the labour of my life!"</p>

<p>The philosopher was totally unaware that I had drunk any portion of
his drug. His idea was, and I gave a tacit assent to it, that I had
raised the vessel from curiosity, and that, frightened at its
brightness, and the flashes of intense light it gave forth, I had let
it fall. I never undeceived him. The fire of the medicine was
quenched--the fragrance died away--he grew calm, as a philosopher
should under the heaviest trials, and dismissed me to rest.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe the sleep of glory and bliss which
bathed my soul in paradise during the remaining hours of that memorable
night. Words would be faint and shallow types of my enjoyment, or of
the gladness that possessed my bosom when I woke. I trod air--my
thoughts were in heaven. Earth appeared heaven, and my inheritance upon
it was to be one trance of delight. "This it is to be cured of love," I
thought; "I will see Bertha this day, and she will find her lover cold
and regardless; too happy to be disdainful, yet how utterly indifferent
to her!"</p>

<p>The hours danced away. The philosopher, secure that he had once
succeeded, and believing that he might again, began to concoct the same
medicine once more. He was shut up with his books and drugs, and I had
a holiday. I dressed myself with care; I looked in an old but polished
shield which served me for a mirror; methoughts my good looks had
wonderfully improved. I hurried beyond the precincts of the town, joy
in my soul, the beauty of heaven and earth around me. I turned my steps
toward the castle--I could look on its lofty turrets with lightness of
heart, for I was cured of love. My Bertha saw me afar off, as I came up
the avenue. I know not what sudden impulse animated her bosom, but at
the sight, she sprung with a light fawn-like bound down the marble
steps, and was hastening towards me. But I had been perceived by
another person. The old high-born hag, who called herself her
protectress, and was her tyrant, had seen me also; she hobbled,
panting, up the terrace; a page, as ugly as herself, held up her train,
and fanned her as she hurried along, and stopped my fair girl with a
"How, now, my bold mistress? whither so fast? Back to your cage--hawks
are abroad!"</p>

<p>Bertha clasped her hands--her eyes were still bent on my approaching
figure. I saw the contest. How I abhorred the old crone who checked the
kind impulses of my Bertha's softening heart. Hitherto, respect for her
rank had caused me to avoid the lady of the castle; now I disdained
such trivial considerations. I was cured of love, and lifted above all
human fears; I hastened forwards, and soon reached the terrace. How
lovely Bertha looked! her eyes flashing fire, her cheeks glowing with
impatience and anger, she was a thousand times more graceful and
charming than ever. I no longer loved--oh no! I
adored--worshipped--idolized her!</p>

<p>She had that morning been persecuted, with more than usual
vehemence, to consent to an immediate marriage with my rival. She was
reproached with the encouragement that she had shown him--she was
threatened with being turned out of doors with disgrace and shame. Her
proud spirit rose in arms at the threat; but when she remembered the
scorn that she had heaped upon me, and how, perhaps, she had thus lost
one whom she now regarded as her only friend, she wept with remorse and
rage. At that moment I appeared. "Oh, Winzy!" she exclaimed, "take me
to your mother's cot; swiftly let me leave the detested luxuries and
wretchedness of this noble dwelling--take me to poverty and
happiness."</p>

<p>I clasped her in my arms with transport. The old dame was speechless
with fury, and broke forth into invective only when we were far on the
road to my natal cottage. My mother received the fair fugitive, escaped
from a gilt cage to nature and liberty, with tenderness and joy; my
father, who loved her, welcomed her heartily; it was a day of
rejoicing, which did not need the addition of the celestial potion of
the alchymist to steep me in delight.</p>

<p>Soon after this eventful day, I became the husband of Bertha. I
ceased to be the scholar of Cornelius, but I continued his friend. I
always felt grateful to him for having, unaware, procured me that
delicious draught of a divine elixir, which, instead of curing me of
love (sad cure! solitary and joyless remedy for evils which seem
blessings to the memory), had inspired me with courage and resolution,
thus winning for me an inestimable treasure in my Bertha.</p>

<p>I often called to mind that period of trance-like inebriation with
wonder. The drink of Cornelius had not fulfilled the task for which he
affirmed that it had been prepared, but its effects were more potent
and blissful than words can express. They had faded by degrees, yet
they lingered long--and painted life in hues of splendour. Bertha often
wondered at my lightness of heart and unaccustomed gaiety; for, before,
I had been rather serious, or even sad, in my disposition. She loved me
the better for my cheerful temper, and our days were winged by joy.</p>

<p>Five years afterwards I was suddenly summoned to the bedside of the
dying Cornelius. He had sent for me in haste, conjuring my instant
presence. I found him stretched on his pallet, enfeebled even to death;
all of life that yet remained animated his piercing eyes, and they were
fixed on a glass vessel, full of roseate liquid.</p>

<p>"Behold," he said, in a broken and inward voice, "the vanity of
human wishes! a second time my hopes are about to be crowned, a second
time they are destroyed. Look at that liquor--you may remember five
years ago I had prepared the same, with the same success;-- then, as
now, my thirsting lips expected to taste the immortal elixir --you
dashed it from me! and at present it is too late."</p>

<p>He spoke with difficulty, and fell back on his pillow. I could not
help saying,--</p>

<p>"How, revered master, can a cure for love restore you to life?"</p>

<p>A faint smile gleamed across his face as I listened earnestly to his
scarcely intelligible answer.</p>

<p>"A cure for love and for all things--the Elixir of Immortality. Ah!
if now I might drink, I should live for ever!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, a golden flash gleamed from the fluid; a
well-remembered fragrance stole over the air; he raised himself, all
weak as he was--strength seemed miraculously to re-enter his frame-- he
stretched forth his hand--a loud explosion startled me--a ray of fire
shot up from the elixir, and the glass vessel which contained it was
shivered to atoms! I turned my eyes towards the philosopher; he had
fallen back--his eyes were glassy--his features rigid--he was dead!</p>

<p>But I lived, and was to live for ever! So said the unfortunate
alchymist, and for a few days I believed his words. I remembered the
glorious intoxication that had followed my stolen draught. I reflected
on the change I had felt in my frame--in my soul. The bounding
elasticity of the one--the buoyant lightness of the other. I surveyed
myself in a mirror, and could perceive no change in my features during
the space of the five years which had elapsed. I remembered the radiant
hues and grateful scent of that delicious beverage--worthy the gift it
was capable of bestowing--I was, then, <strong>IMMORTAL!</strong></p>

<p>A few days after I laughed at my credulity. The old proverb, that "a
prophet is least regarded in his own country," was true with respect to
me and my defunct master. I loved him as a man--I respected him as a
sage--but I derided the notion that he could command the powers of
darkness, and laughed at the superstitious fears with which he was
regarded by the vulgar. He was a wise philosopher, but had no
acquaintance with any spirits but those clad in flesh and blood. His
science was simply human; and human science, I soon persuaded myself,
could never conquer nature's laws so far as to imprison the soul for
ever within its carnal habitation. Cornelius had brewed a
soul-refreshing drink--more inebriating than wine-- sweeter and more
fragrant than any fruit: it possessed probably strong medicinal powers,
imparting gladness to the heart and vigour to the limbs; but its
effects would wear out; already they were diminished in my frame. I was
a lucky fellow to have quaffed health and joyous spirits, and perhaps a
long life, at my master's hands; but my good fortune ended there:
longevity was far different from immortality.</p>

<p>I continued to entertain this belief for many years. Sometimes a
thought stole across me--Was the alchymist indeed deceived? But my
habitual credence was, that I should meet the fate of all the children
of Adam at my appointed time--a little late, but still at a natural
age. Yet it was certain that I retained a wonderfully youthful look. I
was laughed at for my vanity in consulting the mirror so often, but I
consulted it in vain--my brow was untrenched--my cheeks--my eyes--my
whole person continued as untarnished as in my twentieth year.</p>

<p>I was troubled. I looked at the faded beauty of Bertha--I seemed
more like her son. By degrees our neighbors began to make similar
observations, and I found at last that I went by the name of the
Scholar bewitched. Bertha herself grew uneasy. She became jealous and
peevish, and at length she began to question me. We had no children; we
were all in all to each other; and though, as she grew older, her
vivacious spirit became a little allied to ill-temper, and her beauty
sadly diminished, I cherished her in my heart as the mistress I
idolized, the wife I had sought and won with such perfect love.</p>

<p>At last our situation became intolerable: Bertha was fifty--I twenty
years of age. I had, in very shame, in some measure adopted the habits
of advanced age; I no longer mingled in the dance among the young and
gay, but my heart bounded along with them while I restrained my feet;
and a sorry figure I cut among the Nestors of our village. But before
the time I mention, things were altered--we were universally shunned;
we were--at least, I was--reported to have kept up an iniquitous
acquaintance with some of my former master's supposed friends. Poor
Bertha was pitied, but deserted. I was regarded with horror and
detestation.</p>

<p>What was to be done? we sat by our winter fire--poverty had made
itself felt, for none would buy the produce of my farm; and often I had
been forced to journey twenty miles to some place where I was not
known, to dispose of our property. It is true, we had saved something
for an evil day--that day was come.</p>

<p>We sat by our lone fireside--the old-hearted youth and his
antiquated wife. Again Bertha insisted on knowing the truth; she
recapitulated all she had ever heard said about me, and added her own
observations. She conjured me to cast off the spell; she described how
much more comely grey hairs were than my chestnut locks; she descanted
on the reverence and respect due to age--how preferable to the slight
regard paid to mere children: could I imagine that the despicable gifts
of youth and good looks outweighed disgrace, hatred and scorn? Nay, in
the end I should be burnt as a dealer in the black art, while she, to
whom I had not deigned to communicate any portion of my good fortune,
might be stoned as my accomplice. At length she insinuated that I must
share my secret with her, and bestow on her like benefits to those I
myself enjoyed, or she would denounce me--and then she burst into
tears.</p>

<p>Thus beset, methought it was the best way to tell the truth. I
reveled it as tenderly as I could, and spoke only of a <i>very long
life</i>, not of immortality--which representation, indeed, coincided
best with my own ideas. When I ended I rose and said,--</p>

<p>"And now, my Bertha, will you denounce the lover of your youth?--
You will not, I know. But it is too hard, my poor wife, that you should
suffer for my ill-luck and the accursed arts of Cornelius. I will leave
you--you have wealth enough, and friends will return in my absence. I
will go; young as I seem and strong as I am, I can work and gain my
bread among strangers, unsuspected and unknown. I loved you in youth;
God is my witness that I would not desert you in age, but that your
safety and happiness require it."</p>

<p>I took my cap and moved toward the door; in a moment Bertha's arms
were round my neck, and her lips were pressed to mine. "No, my husband,
my Winzy," she said, "you shall not go alone--take me with you; we will
remove from this place, and, as you say, among strangers we shall be
unsuspected and safe. I am not so old as quite to shame you, my Winzy;
and I daresay the charm will soon wear off, and, with the blessing of
God, you will become more elderly-looking, as is fitting; you shall not
leave me."</p>

<p>I returned the good soul's embrace heartily. "I will not, my Bertha;
but for your sake I had not thought of such a thing. I will be your
true, faithful husband while you are spared to me, and do my duty by
you to the last."</p>

<p>The next day we prepared secretly for our emigration. We were
obliged to make great pecuniary sacrifices--it could not be helped. We
realized a sum sufficient, at least, to maintain us while Bertha lived;
and, without saying adieu to any one, quitted our native country to
take refuge in a remote part of western France.</p>

<p>It was a cruel thing to transport poor Bertha from her native
village, and the friends of her youth, to a new country, new language,
new customs. The strange secret of my destiny rendered this removal
immaterial to me; but I compassionated her deeply, and was glad to
perceive that she found compensation for her misfortunes in a variety
of little ridiculous circumstances. Away from all tell-tale
chroniclers, she sought to decrease the apparent disparity of our ages
by a thousand feminine arts--rouge, youthful dress, and assumed
juvenility of manner. I could not be angry. Did I not myself wear a
mask? Why quarrel with hers, because it was less successful? I grieved
deeply when I remembered that this was my Bertha, whom I had loved so
fondly and won with such transport--the dark-eyed, dark-haired girl,
with smiles of enchanting archness and a step like a fawn--this
mincing, simpering, jealous old woman. I should have revered her grey
locks and withered cheeks; but thus!--It was my work, I knew; but I did
not the less deplore this type of human weakness.</p>

<p>Her jealously never slept. Her chief occupation was to discover
that, in spite of outward appearances, I was myself growing old. I
verily believe that the poor soul loved me truly in her heart, but
never had woman so tormenting a mode of displaying fondness. She would
discern wrinkles in my face and decrepitude in my walk, while I bounded
along in youthful vigour, the youngest looking of twenty youths. I
never dared address another woman. On one occasion, fancying that the
belle of the village regarded me with favouring eyes, she brought me a
grey wig. Her constant discourse among her acquaintances was, that
though I looked so young, there was ruin at work within my frame; and
she affirmed that the worst symptom about me was my apparent health. My
youth was a disease, she said, and I ought at all times to prepare, if
not for a sudden and awful death, at least to awake some morning
white-headed and bowed down with all the marks of advanced years. I let
her talk--I often joined in her conjectures. Her warnings chimed in
with my never-ceasing speculations concerning my state, and I took an
earnest, though painful, interest in listening to all that her quick
wit and excited imagination could say on the subject.</p>

<p>Why dwell on these minute circumstances? We lived on for many long
years. Bertha became bedrid and paralytic; I nursed her as a mother
might a child. She grew peevish, and still harped upon one string--of
how long I should survive her. It has ever been a source of consolation
to me, that I performed my duty scrupulously towards her. She had been
mine in youth, she was mine in age; and at last, when I heaped the sod
over her corpse, I wept to feel that I had lost all that really bound
me to humanity.</p>

<p>Since then how many have been my cares and woes, how few and empty
my enjoyments! I pause here in my history--I will pursue it no further.
A sailor without rudder or compass, tossed on a stormy sea --a
traveller lost on a widespread heath, without landmark or stone to
guide him--such I have been: more lost, more hopeless than either. A
nearing ship, a gleam from some far cot, may save them; but I have no
beacon except the hope of death.</p>

<p>Death! mysterious, ill-visaged friend of weak humanity! Why alone of
all mortals have you cast me from your sheltering fold? Oh, for the
peace of the grave! the deep silence of the iron-bound tomb! that
thought would cease to work in my brain, and my heart beat no more with
emotions varied only by new forms of sadness!</p>

<p>Am I immortal? I return to my first question. In the first place, is
it not more probably that the beverage of the alchymist was fraught
rather with longevity than eternal life? Such is my hope. And then be
it remembered, that I only drank <i>half</i> of the potion prepared by
him. Was not the whole necessary to complete the charm? To have drained
half the Elixir of Immortality is but to be half-immortal--my For-ever
is thus truncated and null.</p>

<p>But again, who shall number the years of the half of eternity? I
often try to imagine by what rule the infinite may be divided.
Sometimes I fancy age advancing upon me. One grey hair I have found.
Fool! do I lament? Yes, the fear of age and death often creeps coldly
into my heart; and the more I live, the more I dread death, even while
I abhor life. Such an enigma is man--born to perish--when he wars, as I
do, against the established laws of his nature.</p>

<p>But for this anomaly of feeling surely I might die: the medicine of
the alchymist would not be proof against fire--sword--and the
strangling waters. I have gazed upon the blue depths of many a placid
lake, and the tumultuous rushing of many a mighty river, and have said,
peace inhabits those waters; yet I have turned my steps away, to live
yet another day. I have asked myself, whether suicide would be a crime
in one to whom thus only the portals of the other world could be
opened. I have done all, except presenting myself as a soldier or
duelist, an objection of destruction to my--no, <i>not</i> my fellow
mortals, and therefore I have shrunk away. They are not my fellows. The
inextinguishable power of life in my frame, and their ephemeral
existence, places us wide as the poles asunder. I could not raise a
hand against the meanest or the most powerful among them.</p>

<p>Thus have I lived on for many a year--alone, and weary of
myself--desirous of death, yet never dying--a mortal immortal. Neither
ambition nor avarice can enter my mind, and the ardent love that gnaws
at my heart, never to be returned--never to find an equal on which to
expend itself--lives there only to torment me.</p>

<p>This very day I conceived a design by which I may end all-- without
self-slaughter, without making another man a Cain--an expedition, which
mortal frame can never survive, even endued with the youth and strength
that inhabits mine. Thus I shall put my immortality to the test, and
rest for ever--or return, the wonder and benefactor of the human
species.</p>

<p>Before I go, a miserable vanity has caused me to pen these pages. I
would not die, and leave no name behind. Three centuries have passed
since I quaffed the fatal beverage; another year shall not elapse
before, encountering gigantic dangers--warring with the powers of frost
in their home--beset by famine, toil, and tempest--I yield this body,
too tenacious a cage for a soul which thirsts for freedom, to the
destructive elements of air and water; or, if I survive, my name shall
be recorded as one of the most famous among the sons of men; and, my
task achieved, I shall adopt more resolute means, and, by scattering
and annihilating the atoms that compose my frame, set at liberty the
life imprisoned within, and so cruelly prevented from soaring from this
dim earth to a sphere more congenial to its immortal essence.</p>
