<h2><a id="pt0"></a>INTRODUCTORY</h2>

<h3>FROM "WIKIPEDIA"<br>
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring-heeled_Jack)</h3>

<p class="first">THERE are many theories about the nature and
identity of Spring-Heeled Jack. This urban legend was very
popular in its time, due to the tales of his bizarre appearance
and ability to make extraordinary leaps, to the point that he
became the topic of several works of fiction.</p>

<p>Spring-Heeled Jack was described by people who
claimed to have seen him as having a terrifying and frightful
appearance, with diabolical physiognomy, clawed hands, and eyes
that "resembled red balls of fire". One report claimed that,
beneath a black cloak, he wore a helmet and a tight-fitting
white garment like an oilskin. Many stories also mention a
"Devil-like" aspect. Others said he was tall and thin, with the
appearance of a gentleman. Several reports mention that he could
breathe out blue and white flames and that he wore sharp
metallic claws at his fingertips. At least two people claimed
that he was able to speak comprehensible English. </p>

<hr>

<h3>SPRING-HEELED JACK AND FICTION<br>
<br>
<small>FROM "THE COMPLETE SPRING HEELED JACK PAGE"</small><br>
(https://web.archive.org/web/20160110133711/http://www.dionysos.org.uk/SHJ1.html)</h4>

<p class="first">NOT surprisingly Spring Heeled Jack caused a
wave of panic to spread not only across 19th century London but
the whole country, the result being that any odd occurrence was
quickly attributed to him, and local traditional bogey men were
often eclipsed or absorbed into the new stereotype. Such a
figure was bound to capture the imagination of creative artists
and from as early as the 1840's he would be adopted as the
subject of various gothic horror plays, and the subject of those
early graphic novels called <i>Penny Dreadfuls</i>.</p>

<p>This would in turn shape the subsequent public perception of
Jack, and generations later ... it became quite hard to seperate
the historical and fictional Jack within the cultural memory.
But this was not just a secondary phenomena. As early as the
initial attacks in Barnes the first Penny Dreadfuls were being
published. At first consisting of popular gothic tales of
murderers and highwaymen, by the time of the Spring-Heeled Jack
scare was at its height they were publishing strange stories of
ghosts, and even vampires, in short cliff hanger installments
for a penny each. These were the cheapest publications on the
market and all the rage among the enthralled populace. These
undoubtedly played a role in the escalating panic and probably
shaped the public perception of the phenomena. It is thus not
surprising that Jack should in turn be absorbed into them. From
the very beginning there was a dialectic between fiction and
fact in the Spring Heeled Jack saga.</p>

<p>The first fictional account seems to have been as early as 1840,
a play called <i>Spring-Heeled Jack, the Terror of London</i>, by
John Thomas Haines, in which Jack is a dastardly villain who
attacks women after he is jilted by his sweetheart. It was soon
followed a few years later by the W.G. Willis play <i>The Curse
of the Wraydons</i>, in which Jack is a traitor during the
Napoleonic War who spies for Napoleon, and stages murderous
stunts to deflect attention.</p>

<p>Later in the 1840s came the first Penny Dreadful to feature
Jack, also entitled <i>Spring-Heeled Jack, the Terror of
London</i> which appeared in weekly episodes and was written
anonymously. It too made Jack a villain, and drew as much from
the plays as it did reality. An earlier Penny Dreadful from
1843, <i>The Old Tar and the Vampire</i> had featured a
mysterious fiend who leapt around the streets of the East End of
London, and set at least one person alight with his pyromaniacal
skills, but he was not overtly identified with Spring Heel
Jack.</p>

<p>In 1863 another play, <i>Spring-Heel'd Jack: or, The Felon's
Wrongs</i>, was written by Frederick Hazleton.</p>

<p>Between 1864 and 1867 <i>Spring-Heeled Jack, the Terror of
London</i> was reissued in a rewritten version.</p>

<p>1878 saw the third Penny Dreadful, which appeared in 48
weekly instalments, probably written by George A. Sala or Alfred
Burrage under the pseudonym of Charlton Lea. It kept the same
title, but totally transformed the story. Jack is no villain in
these stories; he uses his powers to right wrongs, and save the
innocent from the wicked. Here he is in fact a nobleman by
birth, cheated of his inheritance, and his amazing leaps are due
to compressed springs in the heels of his boots. He is dressed
in a skin-tight glossy red outfit, with bat's wings, a lion's
mane, horns, talons, massive cloven hoofs, and a sulphurous
breath, he makes spectacular leaps, easily jumping over rooftops
or rivers, and is immensely strong. </p>

<p>In 1889 this version was reprinted, and in 1904 Charles
Burrage's version was published.</p>

<p>Finally a remake of <i>The Curse of the Wraydons</i> was
written in 1928 by surrealist Swiss author Maurice Sandoz, and
later made into a film.</p></p>

<p>Jack has appeared in a variety of fictional media ever since,
including an award-winning multi-part radio play, <i>The Strange
Case of Spring Heel'd Jack</i>.</p>

<hr>

<a id="pt1"></a><h2>PART I</h2>

<p class="first">OUT of the enormous army of highwaymen,
footpads, and housebreakers, who have made themselves famous or
infamous in the annals of English crime, probably not one ever
succeeded in gaining such a large amount of notoriety in so
short a space of time as the subject of our present sketch,
Spring-Heeled Jack.</p>

<p>This quickly acquired reputation was the result, probably, of
the veil of mystery which shrouded the identity of the man who
was known on all hands as the Terror of London.</p>

<p>It was at one time generally believed that Spring-Heeled Jack
was no less a personage than the then Marquis of Waterford.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="0602571h-images/SHJ-MarquisOfWaterford.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">The 3rd Marquis of Waterford (1811-1859)</p>
</div>
<br>


<p>This, however, was distinctly proved not to be the case,
although the manner of proving it does not redound to the noble
marquis's credit.</p>

<p>That the Marquis of Waterford and Jack could not be identical
is proved conclusively by the fact that the terrible apparition
showed itself to many persons on the 4th, 5th, and 6th, of
April, 1837.</p>

<p>At this time we find from an indictment which was tried at
the Derby assizes on Aug. 31st, 1837, that the Marquis of
Waterford, Sir F. Johnstone, Bart., the Hon. A. C. H. Villiers,
and E. H. Reynard, Esq., were charged with having committed an
assault on April 5th, 1837.</p>

<p>On that day it was proved that the defendants were at the
Croxton Park Races, about five miles from Melton Mowbray.</p>

<p>The whole of the four had been dining out at Melton on the
evening of that day, and about two in the morning of the
following day the watchmen on duty, hearing a noise, proceeded
to the market place, and near Lord Rosebery's place saw several
gentlemen attempting to overturn a caravan, a man being inside
at the time.</p>

<p>The watchmen eventually succeeded in preventing this.</p>

<p>The marquis immediately challenged one of them to fight.</p>

<p>That worthy, however, having heard something about the
nobleman's proficiency in the "noble art," at once declined.</p>

<p>On this the four swells took their departure.</p>

<p>Subsequently the same watchmen heard a noise in the direction
of the toll bar.</p>

<p>They proceeded there at once, when they found that the
gatekeeper had been screwed up in his house, and had been for
some time calling out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Murder! come and release me."</p>

<p>The watchmen released the toll-keeper and started in pursuit
of the roysterers.</p>

<p>When the "Charlies," as the guardians of the peace were
called in those days, came up with the marquis's party for the
second time, the watchman who had declined the challenge to
fight observed that one of the swells carried a pot of red paint
while the other carried a paint brush.</p>

<p>The man who had by this time grown a little more valorous,
managed to wrest the paint brush from the hand of the person who
held it.</p>

<p>But his triumph was of short duration, the four swells
surrounded him, threw him on his back, stripped him, and ten
minutes later the unfortunate man was painted a bright red from
head to foot.</p>

<p>They then continued their "lark," painting the doors and
windows of different houses red.</p>

<p>Some time later or rather earlier, Mr. Reynard was captured
and put in the lock up.</p>

<p>The marquis and his two remaining companions succeeded in
making an entrance to the constable's room.</p>

<p>Once there they had little difficulty in forcing him to give
up his keys.</p>

<p>Once having obtained possession of these they had little
difficulty in releasing the prisoner.</p>

<p>This done they bore their living trophy back to their
lodgings in state, and the little town resumed its normal
condition of quiet repose.</p>

<p>The jury found the defendants (who were all identified as
having taken part in the affray) guilty of a common assault, and
they were sentenced to pay a fine of &pound;100 each, and to be
imprisoned until such fine was paid.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that the money was at once
forthcoming.</p>

<p>So our readers will see that this disgraceful affair proves
conclusively that the Marquis of Waterford and Spring-Heeled
Jack had a separate existence, unless the marquis was gifted
with the power of being in two places at once.</p>

<p>In the <i>Annual Register</i>, Feb. 20th, 1837, we find the
following&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">"OUTRAGE ON A YOUNG LADY.&mdash;Frequent representations have
of late been made to the Lord Mayor, of the alarm excited by a
miscreant, who haunted the lanes and lonely places in the
neighbourhood of the metropolis for the purpose of terrifying
women and children."</p>

<p class="quote">"For some time these statements were supposed to be greatly
exaggerated."</p>

<p class="quote">"However, the matter was put beyond a doubt by the following
circumstance:&mdash;"</p>

<p class="quote">"A Mr. Alsop, who resided in Bearbind-lane, a lonely spot
between the villages of Bow and Old Ford, attended at
Lambeth-street Office, with his three daughters, to state the
particulars of an outrageous assault upon one of his daughters,
by a fellow who goes by the name of the suburban ghost, or
'Spring-Heeled Jack.'"</p>

<p class="quote">"Miss Jane Alsop, one of the young ladies, gave the following
evidence:&mdash;"</p>

<p class="quote">"About a quarter to nine o'clock on the preceding night she
heard a violent ringing at the gate in front of the house; and
on going to the door to see what was the matter, she saw a man
standing outside, of whom she inquired what was the matter."</p>

<p class="quote">"The person instantly replied that he was a policeman, and
said, 'For Heaven's sake bring me a light, for we have caught
Spring-Heeled Jack here in the lane.'"</p>

<p class="quote">"She returned into the house and brought a candle and handed
it to the person, who appeared enveloped in a large cloak."</p>

<p class="quote">"The instant she had done so, however, he threw off his outer
garment, and applying the lighted candle to his breast,
presented a most hideous and frightful appearance, and vomited
forth a quantity of blue and white flame from his mouth, and his
eyes resembled red balls of fire."</p>

<p class="quote">"From the hasty glance which her fright enabled her to get at
his person, she observed that he wore a large helmet, and his
dress, which appeared to fit him very tight, seemed to her to
resemble white oilskin."</p>

<p class="quote">"Without uttering a sentence he darted at her, and catching
her partly by her dress and the back part of her neck, placed
her head under one of his arms, and commenced bearing her down
with his claws, which she was certain were of some metallic
substance."</p>

<p class="quote">"She screamed out as loud as she could for assistance, and by
considerable exertion got away from him, and ran towards the
house to get in."</p>

<p class="quote">"Her assailant, however, followed her, and caught her on the
steps leading to the hall door, when he again used considerable
violence, tore her neck and arms with his claws, as well as a
quantity of hair from her head; but she was at length rescued
from his grasp by one of her sisters."</p>

<p class="quote">"Miss Alsop added that she had suffered considerably all
night from the shock she had sustained, and was then in extreme
pain, both from the injury done to her arm, and the wounds and
scratches inflicted by the miscreant on her shoulders and neck,
with his claws or hands."</p>

<br>

<p>This story was fully confirmed by Mr. Alsop, and his other
daughter said&mdash;</p>

<p>"That the fellow kept knocking and ringing at the gate after
she had dragged her sister away from him, but scampered off when
she shouted from an upper window for a policeman."</p>

<p>"He left his cloak behind him, which someone else picked up,
and ran off with."</p>

<p>And again on Feb. 26th, of the same year, we find the
following:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">"'THE GHOST, alias 'SPRING-HEELED JACK' AGAIN.&mdash;At
Lambeth-street office, Mr. Scales, a respectable butcher,
residing in Narrow-street, Limehouse, accompanied by his sister,
a young woman eighteen years of age, made the following
statement relative to the further gambols of Spring-Heeled
Jack:&mdash;"</p>

<p class="quote">"Miss Scales stated that on the evening of Wednesday last, at
about half-past eight o'clock, as she and her sister were
returning from the house of their brother, and while passing
along Green Dragon-alley, they observed some, person standing in
an angle in the passage."</p>

<p class="quote">"She was in advance of her sister at the time, and just as
she came up to the person, who was enveloped in a large cloak,
he spurted a quantity of blue flame right in her face, which
deprived her of her sight, and so alarmed her, that she
instantly dropped to the ground, and was seized with violent
fits, which continued for several hours."</p>

<p class="quote">"Mr. Scales said that on the evening in question, in a few
minutes after his sisters had left the house, he heard the loud
screams of one of them, and on running up Green Dragon-alley he
found his sister Lucy, who had just given her statement, on the
ground in a fit, and his other sister endeavoring to hold and
support her."</p>

<p class="quote">"She was removed home, and he then learned from his other
sister what had happened."</p>

<p class="quote">"She described the person to be of tall, thin, and
gentlemanly appearance, enveloped in a large cloak, and carried
in front of his person a small lamp, or bull's eye, similar to
those in possession of the police."</p>

<p class="quote">"The individual did not utter a word, nor did he attempt to
lay hands on them, but walked away in an instant."</p>

<p class="quote">"Every effort was subsequently made by the police to discover
the author of these and similar outrages, and several persons
were taken up and underwent lengthened examinations, but were
finally set at liberty, nothing being elicited to fix the
offence upon them."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">Articles and paragraphs of this nature were of
almost daily occurrence at this period, and the public
excitement rose to such a pitch that "Vigilance Committees" were
formed in various parts of London to try and put a stop to the
Terror's pranks and depredations, even if they could not succeed
in securing his apprehension. There could be no possible doubt
that there was very little exaggeration in the extraordinary
statements as to Spring-Heeled Jack's antics.</p>

<p>A bet of two hundred pounds, which became the talk of the
clubs and coffee-houses, did more to add to Jack's reputation
for supernatural powers than all the talk of mail-coach guards,
market people, and servant girls.</p>

<p>A party of gentlemen were travelling by the then newly-opened
London and North-Western Railway.</p>

<p>As they neared the northern end of the Primrose Hill tunnel
they observed the figure of Jack sitting on a post, looking
exactly as his Satanic Majesty is usually represented in picture
books or on the stage.</p>

<p>"By Jove! there's Spring-Heeled Jack," cried Colonel
Fortescue, one of the travellers.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Major Howard, one of his companions, "and I'll
bet you two hundred pounds even that he's at the other end of
the tunnel when we arrive there."</p>

<p>"Done!" cried the colonel.</p>

<p>And sure enough as the train emerged once more into the open
air there was Spring-Heeled Jack at the side of the line, his
long moustaches twirled up the sides of his prominent nose, and
stream of sulphurous flame seeming to pour out from between his
lips.</p>

<p>Another instant and he had disappeared.</p>

<p>The whole party in the train were almost paralysed for a
time, although most of them had "set their squadron in the
field," and hardly knew what fear meant.</p>

<p>Colonel Fortescue handed the major the two hundred pounds,
and the affair became a nine-days' wonder.</p>

<p>The solution was, no doubt, simple enough.</p>

<p>Spring-Heeled Jack had sprung on to the moving train at the
rear, and during its passage through the tunnel had made his way
to the front, and then, with a bound, had made his appearance in
front of the advancing train.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the unimpeachable evidence of men of
position, like the gallant officers, backed up, as it was, by
the payment and receipt of the two hundred pounds, brought Jack
with a bound, like one from his own spring heels, to the utmost
pinnacle of notorious fame.</p>

<p>We have no particulars of the exact mechanism that enabled
Spring-heeled Jack to make such extraordinary bounds.</p>

<p>To jump clear over a stage coach, with its usual complement
of passengers on top, was as easy to him as stepping across a
gutter would be to any ordinary man.</p>

<p>The secret of these boots had died with the inventor, and
perhaps it is as well.</p>

<p>We have no doubt that if those boots were purchasable
articles many of our readers would be tempted to leave off
taking in <i>The Boy's Standard</i>, so as to be able to save up
more pennies towards the purchase of a pair.</p>

<p>Fancy, if you can, what would be the consequence of a small
army of Spring-heels in every district.</p>

<p>To return, however, to our hero.</p>

<p>His dress was most striking.</p>

<p>It consisted of a tight-fitting garment, which covered him
from his neck to his feet.</p>

<p>This garment was of a blood-red colour.</p>

<p>One foot was encased in a high-heeled, pointed shoe, while
the other was hidden in a peculiar affair, something like a
cow's hoof, in imitation, no doubt, of the "cloven hoof" of
Satan. It was generally supposed that the "springing" mechanism
was contained in that hoof.</p>

<p>He wore a very small black cap on his head, in which was
fastened one bright crimson feather.</p>

<p>The upper part of his face was covered with black domino.</p>

<p>When not in action the whole was concealed by an enormous
black cloak, with one hood, and which literally covered him from
head to foot.</p>

<p>He did not always confine himself to this dress though, for
sometimes he would place the head of an animal, constructed out
of paper and plaster, over his own, and make changes in his
attire.</p>

<p>Still, the above was his favourite costume, and our readers
may imagine it was a most effective one for Jack's purpose.</p>

<p>These are almost all the published facts about this
extraordinary man.</p>

<p>But we have been favoured by the descendants of Spring-Heeled
Jack with the perusal of his "Journal" or "Confessions," call it
which you will.</p>

<p>The only condition imposed upon us in return for this very
great favour is that we shall conceal the real name of the hero
of this truly extraordinary story.</p>

<p>The reason for this secresy is obvious.</p>

<p>The descendants of Spring-Heeled Jack are at the present time
large landed proprietors in South of England, and although had
it not been for our hero's exploits they would not at the
present time be occupying that position, still one can hardly
wonder at their not wishing the real name of Spring-Heeled Jack
to become known.</p>

<p>As it will, however, be necessary for the proper unravelling
of our story that some name should be used we will bestow upon
our hero the name of Dacre.</p>

<p>Jack Dacre was the son of a baronet whose creation went back
as far back as 1619.</p>

<p>Jack's father had been a younger son, and, as was frequently
the case in those days, he had been sent out to India to see
what he could do for himself.</p>

<p>This was rendered necessary by the fact that I although the
Dacres possessed a considerable amount of land the whole of it
was strictly entailed.</p>

<p>This fact was added to the perhaps more important one that
each individual Dacre in possession of the title and estates
seemed to consider that it was his duty to live close up to his
income, and to give his younger sons nothing to start in life
with, save a good education.</p>

<p>That is to say, the younger sons had the run of the
house.</p>

<p>They were taught to shoot by the keepers; to ride by the
grooms; to throw a fly, perhaps, by the gardener; and to pick up
what little "book-learning" they could.</p>

<p>Not altogether a bad education, perhaps, in those days when
fortunes could be made in India by any who had fair connections,
plenty of pluck, and plenty of industry.</p>

<p>Jack's father was early told that he could expect no money
out of the estate, and he was also informed that he could choose
his own path in life.</p>

<p>This did not take him long.</p>

<p>Sidney Dacre was a plucky young fellow, and thought that
India would afford the widest scope for his talents, which were
not of the most brilliant order, as may be expected from his
early training.</p>

<p>To India he therefore went, and managed to shake the "pagoda
tree" to a pretty fair extent.</p>

<p>In 1837 he thought he was justified in taking to himself a
wife, and of this union Jack, who was born in the year of
Waterloo, was the only result.</p>

<p>Fifteen years later Sidney Dacre received the intelligence
that his father and his two brothers had perished in a storm
near Bantry Bay, where they had gone to assist as volunteers in
repelling a supposed French invading party which it was
anticipated would attempt to effect a landing there.</p>

<p>This untimely death of his three relatives left Sidney Dacre
the heir to the baronetcy and estates; and although he had
plantation after plantation in the Presidencies, he made up his
mind that he would at once return to the old country.</p>

<p>He therefore placed his Indian plantations in the hands of
one Alfred Morgan, a clerk, in whom he had always placed
implicit confidence.</p>

<p>This man, by the way, had been the sole witness to his
marriage with Jack's mother.</p>

<p>A month later, and Sir Sidney and Lady Dacre, with their son,
set sail in the good ship <i>Hydaspes</i> on their way to England.</p>

<p>Nothing of any importance occurred on the voyage, and the
<i>Hydaspes</i> was within sight of the white cliffs of old Albion when
a storm came on, and almost within gunshot of home the brave old
ship which had weathered many a storm went to pieces.</p>

<p>All that were saved out of passengers and crew were two
souls.</p>

<p>One, our hero Jack Dacre, afterwards to become the notorious
Spring-Heeled Jack; the other, a common sailor, Ned Chump, a man
who is destined to play a not unimportant part in this history,
even if the part he had already played did not entitle him to
mention in our columns.</p>

<p>And when we tell our readers that had it not been for the
friendly office of Ned Chump our hero must inevitably have
perished with the rest, we think they will agree that they owe
the jolly sailor a certain amount of gratitude.</p>

<p>Ned Chump had taken very great interest in our hero on the
voyage home.</p>

<p>Jack was such a handsome, bright-looking lad, that everyone
seemed to take to him at first sight.</p>

<p>Ned's devotion to him more resembled that of a faithful
mastiff to his master than any other simile that we can call to
mind.</p>

<p>When Ned saw that the fate of the <i>Hydaspes</i> was inevitable he
made up his mind that Master Jack and he should be saved if
there was any possibility of such a thing.</p>

<p>The jolly tar bound Jack Dacre fast to a hen coop, and then
attached his belt to it with a leather thong.</p>

<p>This done Ned threw the lad, the coop, and himself into the
sea, and beating out bravely managed to get clear of the ship as
she went down head first.</p>

<p>Had he not have done this they must inevitably have been
drawn into the vortex caused by the sinking ship.</p>

<p>Fortunately for both of them Jack had become unconscious, or
it is not likely that he would have deserted his father and
mother, even at this critical juncture.</p>

<p>However, the <i>Hydaspes</i> and all on board, including Sir Sidney
and Lady Dacre, had gone to the bottom of the sea ere Jack
recovered consciousness and found himself on the shore of Kent,
with his faithful companion in adversity bending over him with
loving care.</p>

<p>As soon as Jack Dacre was sufficiently recovered, Ned
proceeded to "take his bearings" as he expressed it, and knowing
that Jack's ancestral home was somewhere in the county of
Sussex, he suggested that they should move in a westerly
direction until they should find some native of the soil who
could inform them of the locality they were in.</p>

<p>They found upon inquiry that they had been cast ashore at a
little village called Worth, in the neighbourhood of Sandwich,
and that the good ship <i>Hydaspes</i> had fallen a victim to the
insatiable voracity of the Goodwin Sands.</p>

<p>Shipwrecked mariners are always well treated in England, the
old stories of wreckers and their doings notwithstanding, and
Jack Dacre and the trusty Ned Chump had little difficulty in
making their way to Dacre Hall in Sussex, though neither had
sixpence in his pocket, so sudden had their departure from the
wrecked ship been.</p>

<p>When Jack arrived at the home of his forefathers he found one
Michael Dacre, who informed our hero that he was his father's
first cousin, in possession.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lad," went on Michael Dacre, in a particularly
unpleasant manner, "Sir Sidney's cousin; and failing his lawful
issue I am the heir to Dacre Hall and the baronetcy."</p>

<p>"Failing his lawful issue!" cried Jack, with all the
impetuosity of youth. "Am I not my father's only son, and
therefore heir to the family honours and estates?"</p>

<p>"Softly, young man&mdash;softly," cringed Michael, "I do not
want to anger you. Of course you have the proof with you that
your father and mother were married, and that you are the issue
of that union?"</p>

<p>"Proof!" cried Jack, fairly losing his temper. "Do you think
one swims ashore from a doomed ship with his family archives
tied round his waist?"</p>

<p>"There&mdash;there, my boy," said the wily Michael, "don't
lose your temper; for you must see that it would have been
better for you if you had have taken the precaution to have
brought the papers with you."</p>

<p>"But," said Jack, quite non-plussed by his cousin's coolness,
"Ned Chump, here, knows who I am, and that everything is
straight and above board."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my boy," replied Michael; "and pray how long has
Mr. Chump, as I think you call him, known you? Was he present at
your father's marriage? I do not suppose he was present at your
birth," and Michael Dacre concluded his speech with a quiet but
diabolical chuckle.</p>

<p>"I have known him ever since the day we left India&mdash;"
began the lad.</p>

<p>But Michael interrupted him by saying, in a somewhat harsher
tone than he had used before&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is equal to not knowing you at all. I am an
acknowledged Dacre, and until you can prove your right to that
name I shall remain in possession of Dacre Hall; for the honour
of my family I could not do otherwise."</p>

<p>"But what am I? Where am I to go? What am I to do?" stammered
Jack.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ned Chump looked on with kindling eyes, and a
fierce light in his face that boded ill for Michael Dacre should
it come to blows between them.</p>

<p>Michael caught the look, and felt that perhaps it would be
better to temporise, he therefore said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! Dacre Hall is large enough for us all. While I am making
the necessary enquiries in India, you and this common sailor
here can knock about the place. It will, perhaps, be quite as
well that I have you under my eye, so that if you turn out to be
an impostor you may be punished as you deserve."</p>

<p>After a short consultation, Jack and Ned Chump made up their
mind that it would be best to accept the churlish offer.</p>

<p>"After all," said Ned, "you know that you are the rightful
heir. And when the proofs come over from India you will easily
be able to claim your own."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ned, I suppose we had better remain on the spot."</p>

<p>"Of course we had," said Ned. "There is only one thing
against it, and that is that if I ever saw murder in anyone's
eye it was in your cousin's just now. But never mind, lad, we'll
stick together, and we shall circumvent the old villain, never
you fear."</p>

<p>So it was arranged, and Ned Chump and Jack Dacre soon seemed
to have become part and parcel of the establishment at Dacre
Hall.</p>

<p>The sailor's ready ingenuity and willingness to oblige made
him rapidly a great favourite among the servants and
employ&eacute;s generally, while Jack's sunny face, and flow of
anecdote about the strange places he had been in and the strange
sights he had seen, rendered him a decided acquisition to what
was, under the circumstances, a somewhat sombre household.</p>

<p>So time passed on, and the first reply was received from
India.</p>

<p>This reply came from Alfred Morgan, the late Sir Sidney's
trusted representative.</p>

<p>This letter destroyed in an instant any hope, if such ever
existed, in Michael Dacre's breast that Jack might be an
impostor.</p>

<p>But there was one gleam of hope in the cautiously-worded
postscript to the letter.</p>

<p>"Do not mention this to anyone. I am on my way to England,
and I may identify the boy and produce the necessary
papers&mdash;or I may not. It will depend a great deal upon the
first interview I have with you; and that interview must take
place before I see the boy."</p>

<p>"What did this mean?" thought Michael Dacre. "Did it mean
that here was a tool ready to his hand, who would swear away his
cousin's birthright?"</p>

<p>Time alone would show.</p>

<p>Then again the improbability of such a thing occurring would
sweep over him with tenfold force, and he decided to take time
by the fore-lock and remove Jack from his path.</p>

<p>Michael Dacre had not the pluck to do this fell deed himself,
but he had more than one tool at hand who would fulfil his foul
bidding for a price.</p>

<p>The man he chose on this occasion was one Black Ralph, a
ruffian who had been everything by turns, but nothing long.</p>

<p>He was strongly suspected of obtaining his living at the time
of which we are writing by poaching, but nothing had ever been
proved against him.</p>

<p>In the days when Jack's grandfather had been alive, Michael
Dacre, who acted as steward and agent on the estate, always
pooh-poohed any suggestion of the kind, and sent the complaining
gamekeepers away, literally "with a flea in their ears."</p>

<p>The arrangement was soon made between Michael Dacre and Black
Ralph.</p>

<p>The former was to admit the latter to the house, and he was
to ransack the plate pantry, taking sufficient to repay him for
his trouble.</p>

<p>He was then to pass to Jack's bedroom, which Michael pointed
out, and to settle him at once.</p>

<p>He was then to proceed to Newhaven, where a lugger was to be
in waiting, and so make his way with his booty over to
France.</p>

<p>This the cousin thought would make all secure.</p>

<p>But he had reckoned without his host.</p>

<p>Or shall we say his guest, as it was in that light that he
regarded the real Sir John Dacre?</p>

<p>The lad was a light sleeper, and on the night planned for the
attack he became aware of the presence of Black Ralph in his
chamber almost as soon as the would-be assassin had entered
it.</p>

<p>Brave though Jack was, he felt a thrill of terror run through
him as he thought of his utterly helpless condition, for Ned
Chump had been sent on some cunningly-contrived errand to keep
him out of the way, and he had not yet returned.</p>

<p>That murder was the object of the midnight intruder Jack
Dacre never doubted.</p>

<p>There was but one way out of it, and that was to rush up into
the bell tower which communicated with a staircase abutting on
his chamber.</p>

<p>Once here he could ring the bell, if he could only keep his
assailant at bay.</p>

<p>At the worst, he could but jump into the moat below, and
stand a chance of saving his life.</p>

<p>In an instant he had left his bed, and dashed for the
door.</p>

<p>But the assassin was upon him.</p>

<p>Jack just managed to bound up the stairs, and enter the
tower.</p>

<p>Ere he could seize the bell-rope he felt Black Ralph's hot
breath upon his neck. In an instant the lad had sprang upon the
parapet. Then an instant later he was speeding on his way to the
moat below, having made the terrible leap with a grace and
daring which he never afterwards eclipsed, even when assisted by
the mechanical appliances which he used in the adventures we are
about to describe in his assumed character of Spring-Heeled
Jack.</p>

<p>Our hero suffered nothing from his perilous jump worse than a
ducking.</p>

<p>And it is very probable that this did him more good than
harm, as it served to restore his somewhat scattered
thoughts.</p>

<p>By the time Jack Dacre had managed to clamber out of the
moat, Black Ralph had put a considerable distance between
himself and Dacre Hall.</p>

<p>He had got his share of the booty, and whether Master Jack
survived the fall or not mattered little to him.</p>

<p>He could rely upon Michael Dacre's promise that the lugger
should be waiting for him at Newhaven, and once in France he
could soon find a melting-pot for his treasure, and live, for a
time at least, a life of riotous extravagance.</p>

<p>When Jack reached the house he found the hall door open, and
without fear he entered; bent upon going straight to his
cousin's room and informing him of what had happened.</p>

<p>Before he could reach the corridor which contained the state
bedroom in which Michael Dacre had ensconced himself, Jack heard
a low&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hist!"</p>

<p>He turned round and saw Ned Chump beckoning to him and
pointing to the flight of stairs that led to their common
chamber, and from thence to the bell tower.</p>

<p>Our hero having perfect confidence in his sailor friend
obeyed the signal.</p>

<p>When the two were safely seated in their bedroom, Ned said,
eagerly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me, boy, what has happened?"</p>

<p>In a very few words Jack told him.</p>

<p>"My eye!" ejaculated Ned with a low whistle, "that was a jump
indeed."</p>

<p>Then he continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"But who was your assailant? Could you not see his face?"</p>

<p>"No; it was too dark," replied Jack; "but there was a
something about his figure that seemed familiar to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, lad, there was," said honest Ned Chump. "I met the
ruffian but now, making the best of his way to Newhaven, no
doubt."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" asked the lad.</p>

<p>"Why that poaching scoundrel, Black Ralph," answered Ned;
"and you may depend upon it that your worthy cousin has laid
this plant to kill you, and so prevent any chance of a bother
about the property."</p>

<p>"What had I better do?" asked Jack. "I will act entirely
under your advice."</p>

<p>"Well, my boy," said Ned, "take no notice; let matters take
their course. We are sure to find out something or other in the
morning."</p>

<p>And the two firm friends carefully fastened their door and
turned in to rest.</p>

<p>In the morning the alarm of the robbery was given, but
neither Jack nor Ned uttered one word to indicate that they knew
aught about it.</p>

<p>"How did you get in?" asked Michael Dacre, roughly, as he
turned towards Chump.</p>

<p>The would-be baronet's rage at the appearance of Jack Dacre
unharmed, although his plate-chest (as he chose to consider it)
had been ransacked, knew no bounds.</p>

<p>But Ned had his answer ready.</p>

<p>"I thought the door was left open for me, sir," he said, "so
I simply entered and bolted the door behind me, and made my way
up to bed."</p>

<p>"This is indeed a mysterious affair," said Michael Dacre,
"but I have reasons of my own for not letting the officers of
justice know about this affair. I have my suspicions as to who
the guilty party is, and I think, if all is kept quiet, I can
see my way to recovering my lost plate."</p>

<p>"Your lost plate!" said Jack, contemptuously. "Say, rather,
my lost plate."</p>

<p>"I thought that subject was to be tabooed between us until
Mr. Morgan arrives with the proofs of your identity, or
imposture, as the case may be."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," replied Jack; "so be it. But I cannot help
thinking that Mr. Morgan ought to have arrived long before
this."</p>

<p>However, in due course the long-looked for one arrived.</p>

<p>But instead of coming straight on to Dacre Hall, as one would
have expected a trustworthy agent to have done, he took up his
quarters at the Dacre Arms, and sent word to Michael Dacre that
Mr. Alfred wanted to see hint on important business.</p>

<p>The message, of course, was a written one, as the people
belonging to the inn would have thought it strange had an
unknown man sent such a message to one so powerful as Michael
Dacre was now making himself out to be.</p>

<p>In an hour's time the two men were seated over a bottle of
brandy, discussing the position of affairs.</p>

<p>"And if I prove to the law's satisfaction&mdash;never mind
about yours, for you know the truth&mdash;that the boy is
illegitimate, what is to be my share?"</p>

<p>"A thousand pounds," said Michael.</p>

<p>"A thousand fiddlesticks," replied Morgan, grinding his
teeth. "Without my aid you are a penniless beggar, kicked out of
Dacre Hall; and with no profession to turn your hands to. Make
it worth my while, and what are you? Why Sir Michael Dacre, the
owner of this fine estate, and one of the most powerful
landowners in this part of the county of Sussex. A thousand
pounds&mdash;bah!"</p>

<p>The would-be owner of Dacre Hall looked aghast at Morgan's
vehemence, and with an imploring gesture he placed his finger on
his lip and pointed at the door.</p>

<p>Then under his breath he muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Five thousand, then?"</p>

<p>"No, not five thousand, nor yet ten thousand," said
Morgan.</p>

<p>"Now look you here, Mr. Michael Dacre," he went on with a
strong emphasis upon the prefix.</p>

<p>"Now look here&mdash;my only terms are these: You to take the
Dacre estates in England, and I to have the Indian plantations.
That's my ultimatum. Answer, 'yes' or 'no.'"</p>

<p>For an instant Michael Dacre hesitated, but he saw no hope in
the cold grey eye of Alfred Morgan, and at last consented.</p>

<p>The two now separated, but met again the following day, when
the necessary agreements were signed, and Mr. Alfred retired to
Brighton to make his appearance two days later as Mr. Alfred
Morgan, the Indian representative of the late Sir Sidney
Dacre.</p>

<p>"My poor boy," he said, sympathetically, when he first met
our hero. "My poor boy, this is a terrible blow for you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Jack; "it was a terrible blow to me
when my father and my mother went down in the <i>Hydaspes</i>&mdash;but
Time, the great Healer, has softened that blow so that I should
hardly feel it now, were it not for the doubts that my cousin
here has cast upon my identity."</p>

<p>"Ah! of your identity there can be no doubt, poor boy,"
sighed Alfred Morgan; "and that's where lies the pity of
it."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" cried Jack, an angry flush mantling his
handsome features.</p>

<p>"How do mean, poor boy?" went on the merciless scoundrel.
"Why, the pity of it is that, although I know so well that you
are the son of your father and mother, the law refuses to
recognise you as such."</p>

<p>"And why?" yelled Jack, with a sudden and overwhelming
outburst of fury.</p>

<p>"Because," meekly replied the villain, "your father and
mother were never married."</p>

<p>"But," cried Jack, thoroughly taken aback by this assertion,
"you were the witness to the marriage. I have heard my father
say so scores of times."</p>

<p>"Aye, my poor lad; but your mother had a husband living at
the time," and Mr. Alfred handed a bundle of papers to the
family solicitor, who had not yet spoken, the whole conversation
having taken place between Jack and Mr. Alfred Morgan.</p>

<p>A silence like that of the tomb fell upon the fell upon the
occupants of the room as the lawyer examined the papers.</p>

<p>Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour passed, then, with a
sigh, the kind-hearted solicitor turned to Jack and said, with
tears in his&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alas, my lad; it is too true; you have no right to the name
of Dacre."</p>

<p>Without a word Jack caught hold of Ned's hand, and, turning
to his cousin, said, in a voice of thunder&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is some villainy here, which, please Heaven, I will
yet unravel. Once already you have tried to murder my body, now
you are trying to murder my mother's reputation; but as I
escaped from the first plot by a clean pair of heels and a good
spring from the bell tower, so on occasion I feel that I shall
eventually conquer. Come, Ned, we will leave this, and make our
plans for the future."</p>

<p>"Aye, Master Spring-Heels, make yourself scarce, or I will
have you lashed and kicked from the door, you wretched
impostor!"</p>

<p>"Yes, cousin, I will go," answered Jack, impressively; "and I
will accept the name you have given me, as you say I have no
right to any other. But, beware! false Sir Michael Dacre, the
time will come, and that ere long, when the tortures of the
damned shall be implanted in your heart by me&mdash;the
wretched, despised outcast whom you have christened
Spring-Heeled-Jack!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="pt2"></a>PART II</h2>

<p class="first">AS our hero uttered these words Michael Dacre's
cheek paled visibly.</p>

<p>And indeed there was good cause for his apparent fear.</p>

<p>Jack Dacre had thrown such an amount of expression into his
words and gestures as seemed to render them truly prophetic.</p>

<p>At this moment Mr. Reece, the solicitor, advanced towards
Jack and, holding out a well filled purse to him,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take this, my lad; it shall never be said that Sam Reece
allowed the son of his old playmate, Sid Dacre, to be turned out
of house and home without a penny in his pocket, legitimate or
not."</p>

<p>Jack, responding to a nudge from Ned Chump, took the purse
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, for your kindness. That there is some
villainy afloat I am convinced, but whether I eventually succeed
in proving my claim or not this money shall be faithfully
returned. Once more, thank you, sir, and good-bye."</p>

<p>With this Jack and Ned left the room. As soon as they had
taken their departure the "baronet," as we must style him for a
time, recovered his self-possession to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Turning to the solicitor, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"How much was there in that purse, Mr. Reece? Of course I
cannot allow you to lose your money over the unfortunate
whelp."</p>

<p>The lawyer, who, although the documentary evidence was so
plain, could not help thinking with Jack Dacre that some
villainy was afloat, answered the baronet very shortly.</p>

<p>"What I gave the lad, I gave him out of pure good feeling, I
want no repayment from anyone. And, mark my words, Sir Michael
Dacre, that boy will return my loan sooner or later, and if
there is anything wrong about these papers I feel assured that
he will carry out his threat with regard to yourself."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, insolent&mdash;" cried the baronet.</p>

<p>But ere he could finish the sentence, Mr. Reece calmly
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You do not suppose that the matter will drop here? The poor
lad has no friends, and I was stupid in not having detained him
when he proposed to leave this house. However, I missed that
opportunity of questioning him as to his life in India, and the
relations that existed between his father and his mother. One
thing is certain, however, and that is he will appear here
again."</p>

<p>"Well, and if he does!" asked the angry baronet.</p>

<p>"Well, and if he does he will find a firm friend in Sam
Reece," answered the lawyer. "I shall retain these
papers&mdash;not by virtue of any legal right that I can claim
to possess. So, if you want them, you have only to apply to the
courts of law to recover possession of them."</p>

<p>"Then you shall do no more business for me," cried Michael
Dacre.</p>

<p>"I should have thought," replied the solicitor, "that my few
words had effectually severed all business relations between us.
As it appears that you do not take this view, allow me to say
that all the gold in the Indies would not tempt me to act as
your legal adviser for another hour. A man who can behave to an
unfortunate boy-cousin in the manner you have behaved to Jack
Dacre, legitimate or not, can hold no business communications
with Sam Reece."</p>

<p>"But how about my papers?" quoth the now half-frightened
baronet.</p>

<p>"I will send you your bill, and on receipt of a cheque for my
costs I will return you all the papers of yours that I
hold&mdash;save and except, mark you, those relating to the
marriage of the late baronet and the birth and baptism of his
son."</p>

<p>The new baronet looked at his ally, Mr. Alfred Morgan, but
saw very little that was consoling in that worthy man's
face.</p>

<p>He therefore accepted the position, and with as haughty a bow
as he could possibly make under the circumstances, he allowed
Mr. Reece to take his departure.</p>

<p>By this time Jack Dacre and Ned Chump were more than a mile
away from the hall.</p>

<p>Ned, although far more experienced in the ways of the world
than Jack Dacre, tacitly allowed the latter to take the lead of
the "expedition," if such a word may be used.</p>

<p>Jack, boy as he was, was in no way deficient in common sense,
so perhaps Ned was justified in accepting the youngster as his
leader.</p>

<p>For some miles not a word escaped Jack Dacre's lips.</p>

<p>At last they arrived at the old-fashioned town of Arundel,
and here Jack suddenly turned to his companion, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We'll stop here and rest, and think over what will be our
best course to pursue."</p>

<p>"All serene, skipper," answered Ned, "I am quite
content."</p>

<p>Jack gave a melancholy smile as he replied to the sailor's
salutation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! then you don't object to calling me your skipper,
although you have heard that I am base born, and have no right
to bear any name at all."</p>

<p>"Never fear, Master Jack&mdash;or Sir John, perhaps, I ought
to say&mdash;there is some rascality at work, and I believe that
that Mr. Alfred Morgan is at the bottom of it. But we shall
circumvent the villains, I am sure, never fear."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jack, "I think we shall."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Ned, "but how?"</p>

<p>"I have not been idle during our long walk," said Jack, as
the two entered the hospitable portals of the Bridge House
Hotel.</p>

<p>"I have not been idle, and if we can get a private room we
will talk the matter over, and see how much money the good
lawyer was kind enough to give us."</p>

<p>"To give you, you mean," said Chump, with a chuckle. "It's
precious little he'd have given me, I reckon."</p>

<p>They managed to obtain a private room, and over a plain but
substantial repast they counted the contents of the lawyer's
purse.</p>

<p>To the intense surprise of both, and to the extreme delight
of Ned Chump, it was found to contain very little short of fifty
guineas.</p>

<p>The sailor had never in the whole of his life had a chance of
sharing in such a prize as this.</p>

<p>With Jack, of course, the thing was different.</p>

<p>In India he had been accustomed to see money thrown about by
lavish hands.</p>

<p>Between the ideas of Ned Chump, the common sailor, and those
of the son of the rich planter, there could hardly be anything
in common as far as regarded the appreciation of wealth.</p>

<p>But, nevertheless, the friendship that had sprung up between
them in so short a time, never faded until death, the great
divider, stepped in and made all human friendship
impossible.</p>

<p>As soon as Jack had satisfied himself as to the actual
strength of their available capital, he turned to Ned Chump and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"This money will not last long, and I do not see how I can do
anything in the way of working for a living, if I am ever to
hope to prove my title to the Dacre baronetcy and estates."</p>

<p>"That's as it may be, skipper," said Ned, "but I don't quite
see how we are to live without work when this here fifty pounds
has gone."</p>

<p>"That's just the point I have been thinking over," said Jack.
"I am not yet sixteen, but, thanks to my Oriental birth, I look
more like twenty."</p>

<p>"That you do, skipper," chimed in Ned.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll tell you what I intend to do."</p>

<p>"Go on, sir," cried the anxious sailor.</p>

<p>"Some year or two ago I had for a tutor an old Moonshee, who
had formerly been connected with a troop of conjurors&mdash;and
you must have heard how clever the Indian conjurors are."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ned, "and I have seen for myself as well."</p>

<p>"Then," said Jack, "you will not be surprised at what I am
going to tell you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, skipper&mdash;fire away," said Ned.</p>

<p>"Well, this Moonshee taught me the mechanism of a boot which
one member of his band had constructed, and which boot enabled
him to spring fifteen or twenty feet up in the air, and from
thirty to forty feet in a horizontal direction."</p>

<p>"Lor!" was the only exclamation that the open-mouthed and
open-eared sailor could make use of.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued our hero, "and I intend to invest a portion
of this money in making a boot like it."</p>

<p>"Yes; but," stammered the half-bewildered sailor&mdash;"but
when you have made it, of what use will it be to us, or, rather,
how will it enable you to regain your rights?"</p>

<p>"I have formed my plan," answered Jack, "and it is this. I'll
make the boot, and then startle the world with a novel
highwayman. My cousin twitted me about my spring into the moat
and my nimble heels. I'll hunt him down and keep him in a
perpetual state of deadly torment, under the style and title of
Spring-Heeled Jack."</p>

<p>"But," asked the sailor, "you will not turn thief?"</p>

<p>"I shall not call myself a thief," said Jack, proudly. "The
world may dub me so if it likes. I shall take little but what
belongs to me, I shall confine my depredations as much as
possible to assisting my cousin in collecting my rents."</p>

<p>"Oh! I see," said Ned, only half-convinced.</p>

<p>The faithful tar had the sailor's natural respect for
honesty, and did not quite like his "skipper's" plan for
securing a livelihood.</p>

<p>But Jack, who had been brought up under the shadow of the
East India Company, had not many scruples as to the course of
life he had resolved to adopt.</p>

<p>To him pillage and robbery seemed to be the right of the
well-born.</p>

<p>He had seen so much of this sort of thing amongst his
father's friends and acquaintances that his moral sense was
entirely warped.</p>

<p>So speciously did he put forth his arguments that Ned at last
yielded.</p>

<p>The sailor simply stipulated that he should take no active
part in any robbery.</p>

<p>For the faithful salt could find no other term for the
operation.</p>

<p>To this Jack readily consented, and a compact was entered
into between them as to what each was expected to do.</p>

<p>Ned promised faithfully to do all he could to assist his
master in escaping, should he at any time be in danger of
arrest.</p>

<p>Jack, on his part, promising Ned Chump a fair share of the
plunder gained by Spring-Heeled Jack.</p>

<p>This arrangement entered into, the next thing was to make the
spring boot.</p>

<p>Jack, who was possessed with an intelligence as well as
physique far beyond his years, suggested that they should make
their way to Southampton.</p>

<p>There, he argued, they could procure all they wanted without
exciting suspicion.</p>

<p>Ned, of course, had no hesitation in falling in with this
proposal.</p>

<p>A fortnight later and the boot was completed.</p>

<p>Completed, that is, so far as the actual manufacture was
concerned.</p>

<p>Whether it would act or not remained to be seen.</p>

<p>To have tried its power in any ordinary house would have been
absurdly ridiculous.</p>

<p>There was no place where it would be safe to make the trial
spring save in the open air.</p>

<p>Jack had manufactured the boot strictly according to the old
Moonshee's directions, but he could not tell to what length the
mechanism might hurl him, and he was a great deal too sensible
to attempt to ascertain the extent of its power in any enclosed
space.</p>

<p>So one morning, Ned and Jack started off from the inn where
they were staying, for a ramble in the country, taking the magic
boot with them.</p>

<p>Ned had by this time managed to allay his scruples and went
into the affair with as much spirit as did Jack himself.</p>

<p>In due course they reached a spot which Jack pronounced to be
a suitable one for the important trial.</p>

<p>The spot was an old quarry, or rather chalk pit, where at one
spot the soil had only been removed for a depth of about twelve
feet.</p>

<p>Descending this pit Jack placed the boot on his foot.</p>

<p>Ned looked on in the utmost wonderment.</p>

<p>He could hardly conceive that it was possible such a simple
contrivance should possess such magical attributes.</p>

<p>To his astonishment, however, he saw his young master, for as
such Ned regarded Jack Dacre, suddenly rise in the air and
settle down quietly on the upper land some twelve or fourteen
feet above.</p>

<p>Ned, who, although a Protestant, if anything, had lived long
enough amongst Catholics on board ship and elsewhere to have
imbibed some of their customs, made the sign of the cross and
ejaculated something that was meant for a prayer.</p>

<p>To his untutored mind the whole thing savoured strongly of
sorcery.</p>

<p>An instant later and Jack Dacre, who had thus easily earned
the right to be called Spring-Heeled Jack, had sprung down into
the quarry again, and stood by the side of his faithful
henchman.</p>

<p>"Well, skipper," cried Ned, "I've heard of mermaids and
sea-serpents, and whales that have swallowed men without killing
them, but this boot of yours bangs anything I have ever heard
of, though you must know, it isn't all gospel that is preached
in the forecastle."</p>

<p>"It's all right, Ned," said Jack, "and with this simple
contrivance you will see that I shall spring myself into what I
feel convinced is my lawful inheritance."</p>

<p>"I'm with you," said Ned, as keen in the affair now as Jack
Dacre himself.</p>

<p>"I'm with you, and where shall we go now."</p>

<p>"Well, old friend, I must purchase one or two articles of
disguise, and then I think we will make our way towards
Dorking."</p>

<p>"To Dorking?" queried Ned. "I thought you would have made
your way towards Dacre Hall, especially as you said you wished
to assist your cousin to collect his rents. Ha! ha! ha!" and the
jolly tar finished his sentence by bursting into an
uncontrollable fit of laughter.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," replied Jack, "that's just where it is.
Although my poor father never dreamed that he would inherit the
family estates, he had sufficient pride of birth to keep me, his
own son, in spite of all that they say, well posted in the
geography of the entailed estates of the Dacres. I consequently
know that more than one goodly farm in the neighborhood of
Dorking belongs to me by right; and, therefore, to that place I
mean to start to make my first rent collection, as I am
determined to call my operations; for the terms robbery and
thief are quite as repugnant to me as they are to you, Ned
Chump."</p>

<p>"But, skipper, I never thought of you as a real thief," said
Ned, "it was merely because I could not see how you could take
that which belonged other people without robbery, that made me
speak as I did. But if you are really only going to collect that
which is your own, why there can be no harm in it, I am
sure."</p>

<p>"That's right, Ned, and if I ever I do kick over the traces
and make mistake, you may depend I'll do more good than harm
with the money I capture, even if it should not be legally my
own."</p>

<p>Four days later the two had arrived at Dorking.</p>

<p>Jack had provided himself with a most efficient disguise.</p>

<p>His tall and well-developed, although youthful, figure suited
the tight-fitting garb of the theatrical Mephistopheles to a
nicety.</p>

<p>Ned was perfectly enraptured at his appearance, and declared
that he could not possibly fail to strike terror into the guilty
breast of his cousin, the false baronet, should they ever meet
again.</p>

<p>Jack merely laughed, and said that that was an event which
would assuredly come to pass sooner or later.</p>

<p>It was an easy task, in a place like Dorking, to ascertain
which were the lands that belonged to the Dacres.</p>

<p>The first farm that Jack chose as the one for his maiden rent
collection was at a small place called Newdigate.</p>

<p>Jack chose this for his first attempt, partly because of the
isolated situation of the farm, and partly because the tenant
bore a very evil reputation in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Our hero, it must be remembered, was at that romantic period
of life when youth is apt to consider it is its duty to become
as far as possible the protector of virtue and the avenger of
injustice.</p>

<p>It was currently reported that the tenant in question, whom
we will call Farmer Brown (all names in this veracious chronicle
it must be understood are assumed) had possessed himself of the
lease in an unlawful manner.</p>

<p>It was also said that his niece, Selina Brown, who was the
rightful owner of the farm, was kept a prisoner somewhere within
the walls of the solitary farmhouse.</p>

<p>Rumour also added that she was a maniac.</p>

<p>To one of Jack's ardent and romantic temperament this story
was, as our readers may easily conjecture, a great inducement
for him to make his first venture a call at Brown's farm.</p>

<p>Ned received strict injunctions to remain at the inn where
they had taken up their abode, and to be ready to admit our hero
without a moment's delay upon his return.</p>

<p>The night was a truly splendid one.</p>

<p>As Jack set out on his errand, an errand which might as a
result land him in goal, he felt not one tittle of fear.</p>

<p>"Thrice armed is he who has hit cause aright," runs the old
saying, and Jack certainly believed that he was perfectly
justified in the course he was pursuing.</p>

<p>Modern moralists would doubtless differ; but we must remember
what his early training had been, and make excuses
accordingly.</p>

<p>He arrived at Brown's Farm, Newdigate, in due course.</p>

<p>Now came the most critical point in the career of
Spring-Heeled Jack.</p>

<p>This was his first venture.</p>

<p>Failure meant ruin&mdash;ruin pure and simple.</p>

<p>If his wonderful contrivance refused to act in the manner in
which it had acted at the rehearsal, what would be the
result?</p>

<p>There could be but one answer to that question.</p>

<p>Capture, ruin to all his plans, and the infinite shame of a
public trial.</p>

<p>But our hero had well weighed the odds and was quite prepared
to face them.</p>

<p>Arrived at the farm he had no difficulty in finding out the
window of the room in which Mr. Brown usually slept.</p>

<p>This window had been so clearly described to him by the
Dorking people that there was no fear of Jack making a
mistake.</p>

<p>With one spring he alighted on the broad, old-fashioned
window-sill, and an instant later he had opened the
casement.</p>

<p>The farmer was seated in a comfortable armchair in front of a
large old-fashioned bureau.</p>

<p>He had evidently been counting his money and appropriating it
in special portions for the payment perhaps of his landlord, his
seed merchant, and so on.</p>

<p>The noise that Jack made as he opened the window caused the
farmer to turn swiftly round.</p>

<p>Judge, if you can, his dismay when he found what kind of a
visitor had made a call upon him.</p>

<p>On this, his first adventure in the garb of Spring-Heeled
Jack, our hero had not called the aid of phosphorus into
requisition.</p>

<p>His appearance, however, was well calculated to strike terror
into the breast of any one.</p>

<p>Still more so, therefore, into the heart of one, who, like
the farmer, was depriving his orphan niece of her legal rights,
as well as of her liberty.</p>

<p>With a yell like that of a man in an epileptic fit, Farmer
Brown sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>In another instant, however, he had sunk back again into his
chair-rendered for the time hopelessly insane.</p>

<p>Jack, without any consideration of the amount which might or
might not be due to the owner of the Dacre estates, calmly took
possession of all the cash that he could find in the bureau, and
then thought it was time to turn his attention to the alleged
prisoner, Selina Brown.</p>

<p>Satisfying himself that the bureau contained no money save
that which he had already secured, Jack was overjoyed at finding
a document, hidden away in a corner of a pigeon hole.</p>

<p>This document bore upon it the superscription&mdash;"The last
will and testament of Richard Brown, farmer."</p>

<p>In an instant our hero pieced together the story he had heard
in Dorking, and arrived at the conclusion that the present
Farmer Brown, although he had usurped his niece's position and
concealed his brother's will, had at the same time, actuated by
some strange fear, such as does occasionally possess criminals,
dared not destroy the important document.</p>

<p>And here it was in Jack's hands.</p>

<p>There seemed no chance of immediate recovery by the farmer of
his lost senses, so our hero coolly opened the document and read
it through.</p>

<p>"As I thought," he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>"As I thought, the whole farm belongs to this girl, and this
rascally uncle, one of the same kidney as my precious cousin,
has simply swindled her out of her inheritance."</p>

<p>"However, I will see if I cannot manage to find her, and if I
do, I think it will go hard if she does not recover her own
again."</p>

<p>Then, taking up a pen, he selected a sheet of paper, and
wrote upon it in bold characters&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Received of the tenant of Brown's Farm,
Surrey, the sum of &pound;120. And I hereby acknowledge that the
above sum has been so received by me in payment of any rent now
due for the said farm, or which may afterwards accrue until such
sum is exhausted.</p>

<p class="letter">(Signed) <span class="smcap">Spring-Heeled
Jack</span>.</p>

<p class="letter">N.B.&mdash;If this receipt is shown to Sir
Michael Dacre, as he calls himself, its validity will be
accepted without question, otherwise let him beware.</p>

<br>

<p>With a quiet chuckle Jack read this over to himself, then he
laid it down in front of the jabbering lunatic, Farmer
Brown.</p>

<p>"Now for the girl." Jack said, as he carefully put the will
in one of the pockets of his capacious cloak.</p>

<p>The search for the girl did not take long.</p>

<p>The farmhouse was not a large one, and our hero's ears soon
discovered a low moaning sound that evidently came from a garret
which could only be approached by a rickety ladder.</p>

<p>In an instant Jack was at the top of the frail structure.</p>

<p>There, right in front of him, lay the object of his
search.</p>

<p>She was a young and lovely girl about his own age.</p>

<p>Jack's heart gave one bound as he looked at her, then with a
grateful sigh he said, fervently&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven! I have come here. I take this as an augury
that even if there is any wrong in the life I have chosen, I
shall gain absolution for the evil by the good that will come
out of it."</p>

<p>This philosophy was undoubtedly rather Jesuitical, but
allowance must be made for the manner and place in which he had
been brought up.</p>

<p>The girl seemed perfectly dazed when she saw Jack, but she
betrayed not the slightest sign of fear.</p>

<p>She advanced towards our hero as far as a chain which was
passed round her waist and fastened with a staple to the floor,
would allow her, and with a child-like innocence,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! I know you, but I am not frightened at you. You have
come to take me away from this. I do so long to see the green
fields again. Take me away. I am not afraid of you."</p>

<p>For an instant and an instant only Jack hesitated.</p>

<p>His hesitation was only caused by his self inquiry as to what
course he had better pursue under the circumstances.</p>

<p>He soon made up his mind, however.</p>

<p>With Jack to think was to act.</p>

<p>He had heard that one Squire Popham, a local justice of the
peace, had expressed strong doubts as to the right of the
present Farmer Brown to hold the farm.</p>

<p>To this worthy man's house our hero determined to convey the
lovely child whom we have called by the unromantic name of
Selina Brown.</p>

<p>To remove the chain from the girl's waist was work of no
little difficulty, but perseverance, as it usually does,
conquered in the end, and half an hour later Jack had carried
the girl to Squire Popham's house, where, with a furious ring at
the bell, he had left her, having first chalked on the door of
the mansion the following words&mdash;</p>

<p>"This girl is the daughter of the late Farmer Brown, of
Newdigate."</p>

<p>"Her father's will is in her pocket."</p>

<p>"Her wretched uncle is a jabbering idiot at the farm."</p>

<p>"See that the girl enjoys her rights, or dread the vengeance
of 'SPRING-HEELED JACK.'"</p>

<p>In another instant, and before the hall-door had opened to
admit the half-unconscious girl, Jack gave one bound and
disappeared from sight, and so for the time ended the first
adventure of Spring-Heeled Jack.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="pt3"></a>PART III</h2>

<p class="first">BEFORE we follow our hero any further on his
extraordinary career we may as well finish the story of Farmer
Brown and his niece.</p>

<p>When Squire Popham's footman opened the hall door he at first
failed to see the girl so strangely rescued by Spring-Heeled
Jack.</p>

<p>He, however, saw the chalk marks on the door, but was unable
to read them&mdash;no extraordinary circumstance with a man of
his class in the early part of the present century.</p>

<p>Then, turning round, he saw the poor girl.</p>

<p>There was a vacant look on her face that told the footman,
untutored as he was, that she was "a button short," as he
expressed it to himself.</p>

<p>The mysterious chalk marks and the "daft" girl were a little
too much for the footman, and he hastened to call the
butler.</p>

<p>This worthy could read, and as soon as he made his
appearance, and had deciphered Jack's message, he directed his
subordinate to call the squire.</p>

<p>When Mr. Popham, a typical country gentleman of the period,
made his appearance, and read the inscription and saw the girl,
his sympathies were immediately enlisted on her behalf.</p>

<p>"Confound Mr. Spring-Heeled Jack, whoever he may be, and his
impudence, too!" cried the irate squire.</p>

<p>"Does he think that it requires threats to make an English
magistrate see justice done?"</p>

<p>Then bidding the butler to call all the men servants
together, he instructed the housekeeper to see after the welfare
of the poor girl.</p>

<p>As soon as the men had assembled Mr. Popham read Spring-Heeled
Jack's message to them, and then for the first time
recollected that he had not secured the will.</p>

<p>He told one of the men to go to the housekeeper's room, and
ask for the document which was in the girl's pocket.</p>

<p>During the man's brief absence the squire told the men what
he intended doing, and that was to go over to Brown's farm, and,
of the wording of the will proved Jack's tale was correct, to
seize the unworthy uncle there and then, and clap him in the
Dorking watch-house.</p>

<p>A hasty glance at the will soon informed Mr. Popham that Jack
had not exaggerated the facts of the case.</p>

<p>"Now, my men," he said, "we will get over to Newgate at once.
It is as I suspected. The present holder of Brown's farm has no
more title to it than I have. Let us go and seize him at once.
You have all been sworn in as constables, so we have the law
entirely on our side."</p>

<p>We may inform our readers that this was commonly the case in
those days, when the guardians of the peace we few and far
between, and immeasurably inferior to our present police, both
in intelligence and physique.</p>

<p>The journey took some three-quarters of an hour&mdash;a much
longer time than had been occupied by our hero, in spite of the
burden which he had to bear.</p>

<p>The squire ordered the butler to knock loudly at the door,
and his commands were instantly obeyed.</p>

<p>After a brief interval&mdash;so short, in fact, that it
proved that the inmates of the house were up and dressed in
spite of the lateness of the hour&mdash;the door was opened by a
frightened-looking old woman.</p>

<p>"Who is it! What do you want?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am James Popham, one of his Majesty's justices of the
peace, and I want to see your master. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Please, sir, he is in his bedroom," answered the old woman.
"He has had a fit, and has only just recovered. Hadn't you
better wait till the morning?"</p>

<p>"What ho!" thundered the angry squire. "We come in the name
of the law. Lead us to your master's chamber at once."</p>

<p>At this juncture a querulous voice somewhere in the distance
was heard to ask what was the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Popham answered the query in person, for, pushing the
woman on one side, he hastily ascended the stairs, two steps at
a time, until he came to the door of the room from which the
voice had apparently come.</p>

<p>Throwing open the door, Mr. Popham strode into the room,
followed by his men servants.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brown," said the squire, "I arrest you in the name of
the king, for suppressing your brother's will, and keeping his
daughter, your own niece, in captivity since that brother's
death."</p>

<p>Farmer Brown literally shook with fear.</p>

<p>Jack's sudden appearance had temporarily turned his brain,
and he had hardly recovered his senses when this new and
terrible surprise awaited him.</p>

<p>"It is false," he faltered. "My brother left the farm to
me."</p>

<p>"Then what about the girl!" asked the squire. "Even if your
brother did leave the farm to you where is his daughter now?
Produce her at once, or you may be put upon your trial for
murder instead of the lighter offence with which I have charged
you."</p>

<p>Mumbling a few indistinct words, and still trembling
violently, the farmer led the way to the foot of the ladder
leading to the room where his niece had been for so long a time
imprisoned.</p>

<p>Here he paused, as if he did not care to go up the ladder
himself.</p>

<p>"Go on," said the squire, sternly, "and bring the girl down
without any further delay."</p>

<p>Very unwillingly, but compelled by the force of
circumstances, the farmer made the ascent.</p>

<p>As he entered the room a loud yell of terror and astonishment
burst from his lips.</p>

<p>"She's gone!" he cried; "that must have been the foul fiend
himself who called on me tonight, and he has spirited the girl
away with him."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the squire.</p>

<p>In a few words the thoroughly cowed and frightened farmer
explained the occurrences of the night to the squire, winding up
by giving a description of Spring-Heeled Jack's personal
appearance.</p>

<p>"This is indeed strange," said Mr. Popham. "But if it will be
any satisfaction to you I may tell you that your poor niece is
safe at my house, and I have her father's will in my pocket. You
are my prisoner, and my men will at once take you to the lock-up
at Dorking."</p>

<p>The crest-fallen farmer could not frame an inquiry as to how
his crimes had been brought to light, and in silence he allowed
himself to be carried off to the watch house.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown was tried at the next assizes, found guilty, and
sentenced to fourteen years' transportation, from which he never
returned.</p>

<p>His niece through kind treatment eventually recovered her
senses, and subsequently married and became the mother of a
large family of children in the very farm-house where she had
been imprisoned in solitude until the light of reason had
fled.</p>

<p>When Sir Michael Dacre's agent called at the farm when the
rent became due, he found Squire Popham's people in possession,
for that worthy man was not one to do things by halves, and he
had made up his mind that his own farm bailiff should look after
the interests of the poor girl until such time as she might
recover her reason.</p>

<p>The agent was shown the receipt that Jack had given for the
money.</p>

<p>That worthy was immensely puzzled, but seeing that there was
nothing to be done save to take a copy of the receipt and return
with it to Dacre Hall for further instructions, at once adopted
that course.</p>

<p>When the baronet saw the receipt, and heard his agent's
description of our hero&mdash;somewhat exaggerated as such
things are apt to be by passing from mouth to mouth&mdash;his
rage knew no bounds.</p>

<p>Of course he instantly recognised in the hero of the
adventure his cousin, Jack Dacre.</p>

<p>Instantly summoning Mr. Morgan to his presence, for the
unctuous agent had not yet returned to India, the two
fellow-conspirators had a consultation as to what had better be
done under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"My opinion," said Alfred Morgan, "is that you must grin and
bear it. If you take any steps to secure the lad's apprehension
and he is brought to trial, there is likely to be such a stir
made over it as may bring witnesses over from the East, who
may&mdash;mind you I do not say they will&mdash;but who may oust
you from Dacre Hall, the title, and the other property which you
possess.</p>

<p>"You must recollect that your late cousin was immensely
popular in India, and his son would find a host of friends there
to take up his cause."</p>

<p>The baronet had made many hasty exclamations during the
delivery of this speech, but Mr. Morgan would not allow himself
to be interrupted, and calmly continued to the end.</p>

<p>When he had finished, the baronet broke out
rapidly&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do, then? If the case is as you state,
how do you intend to obtain possession of the plantations?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that's all right," coolly replied Morgan. "I care
nothing for the barren honour of being called the owner of the
Dacre plantations. I shall go back to India just as if I was
acting for the rightful owner of the property&mdash;but with
this important difference, that the rents and profits of the
plantations will go into the pockets of Mr. Alfred Morgan."</p>

<p>"Then you won't help me to get rid of this spawn?"</p>

<p>"What time I am in England is entirely at your disposal,"
said Morgan; "but you must remember that my employer's interests
require that I should return to India as soon as possible to
look after his plantations."</p>

<p>And the wily villain concluded with a horrible chuckle.</p>

<p>"What course would you propose, then?" asked Sir Michael.</p>

<p>"Well, I think if I were in your place I would call on each
tenant and warn him that some one is collecting your rents in a
peculiar and perfectly unauthorised manner. Tell them the story
of Spring-Heeled Jack at Brown's farm, but without disclosing
your suspicions as to the identity of the depredator."</p>

<p>"Suspicions! Certainty, man," cried Sir Michael.</p>

<p>"Well, certainty, then," went on Morgan. "This will put them
on their guard, and in the meantime you must wait and hope. If
the boy continues this career much longer he is tolerably
certain to get a stray bullet through his brains one of these
days."</p>

<p>"I will start to-morrow," the baronet promptly said.</p>

<p>"And I will accompany you," said Alfred Morgan, with equal
promptitude.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Morgan," replied Sir Michael. "I'll tell my man
to go over to Arundel at once, and book two seats to London. We
will go there first, as I have considerable property in the
neighbourhood of Hammersmith."</p>

<p>"Have you?" sneered Morgan, with special emphasis on the
pronoun.</p>

<p>The baronet coloured and bit his lip; but he dared not
reply.</p>

<p>This was not the first time by many that his chains had
galled him, and he heartily wished that Morgan were back again
in India, although he knew that he should feel awfully lonely
when the agent went away.</p>

<p>To return to our hero, whom we left as he was hurrying away
from Squire Popham's house on the night of the rescue of Selina
Brown.</p>

<p>Jack reached home in safety, and found the faithful Ned Chump
waiting up for him.</p>

<p>The sailor's astonishment was as unbounded as his admiration
when Jack gave him the history of the evening's adventures and
showed him the money.</p>

<p>"&pound;120!" said Ned. "My stars! and you haven't been away
three hours altogether. Why, we shall make our fortunes
fast!"</p>

<p>"Ah! Ned, Ned, where are your conscientious scruples now?
But, never fear, I do not want to get rich in this fashion. I
merely want to obtain my own&mdash;and this, my maiden
adventure, has been so successful that I feel certain I shall do
so."</p>

<p>Ned, recollecting what he had said to our hero regarding the
morality of their proposed course of life, looked rather
sheepish, but he made no reply, and a little while later the two
separated, and made their way to their respective couches.</p>

<p>In the morning Ned asked Jack what their next step was to
be.</p>

<p>"I think we will go back to Arundel, and take up our quarters
there for the present. From that place I shall be able to
reconnoitre and find out what my precious cousin is about. And
the very first opportunity that offers I will show him a sight
that will raise the hair on his head."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," cheerfully replied the sailor.</p>


<hr>

<h2><a id="pt4"></a>PART IV</h2>

<p class="first">IN the comparatively short time that the two
had been together, Ned Chump had had ample opportunity of
finding out that he had enlisted under a captain who was pretty
well sure to lead him ultimately to victory, and the tar had
therefore fully made up his mind that under no circumstances
would he attempt to question Jack's plans or schemes.</p>

<p>Arrived at Arundel, they took up their quarters at the Bridge
House Hotel, and passed some time in comparative quietude.</p>

<p>Jack managed to keep himself well posted up in all relating
to Dacre Hall and its usurping tenant.</p>

<p>This he was enabled to do by reason of a disguise which he
had assumed.</p>

<p>No one would have recognised in the dashing young buck,
apparently four or five and twenty years of age, the lad who had
so lately been turned out of Dacre Hall as an illegitimate scion
of the ancient house.</p>

<p>Ned had contrived to give himself something of the appearance
of a gentleman's body servant or valet, and the two represented
themselves to be a Mr. Turnbull, a young gentleman who had
recently come into a fine property, and his servant, who had
come down into Sussex to rest after a course of dissipation into
which Mr. Turnbull had plunged on having come into his
inheritance.</p>

<p>Jack, however, did not find out anything of importance for
some days, and then, quite by accident, he made a discovery
which promised to make an interview between Spring-Heeled Jack
and Sir Michael Dacre a very easy matter.</p>

<p>This discovery was made under the following
circumstances.</p>

<p>Our hero was standing one evening in the entrance hall of the
hotel, passing an occasional remark to the farmers and others
who passed in and out, when he saw one of the gigs from the Hall
drive up.</p>

<p>Jack was on the alert in a moment.</p>

<p>The man who had driven the gig was one of servants at Dacre
Hall, who had shown a special liking for our hero, and this
accidental encounter would give Jack an excellent opportunity of
proving the strength or weakness of his disguise, even if
nothing else came of it.</p>

<p>As the man descended from the gig and threw the reins to an
attendant ostler, Jack advanced to the door of the hotel and met
the servant from the Hall face to face.</p>

<p>The man looked at him full in the face, but not the slightest
sign of recognition passed over his features.</p>

<p>Jack gave a quiet chuckle.</p>

<p>If this man who had shown him so many tokens of friendly
feeling during his short sojourn at Dacre Hall failed to
recognize him, surely he was perfectly safe from detection!</p>

<p>Not that Jack had anything to fear even if he was identified,
but he felt that with such an adversary as he had in the person
of Sir Michael Dacre, his only chance of success was to meet his
cousin with his own weapons, and so long as he could preserve
his incognito the chances were greatly in his favour.</p>

<p>But this chance encounter led to much greater results than
the mere testing of the strength of his disguise.</p>

<p>As the man entered the hotel Jack turned round and followed
him to the bar.</p>

<p>"I want to book two seats to London by to-morrow's coach,"
said the man.</p>

<p>"All right," was the reply; "inside or out, the box seat is
already taken."</p>

<p>"Oh, inside," replied the servant. "Sir Michael does not care
about outside travelling at this time of the year."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, Sir Michael is going up to town, is he?" asked the
attendant.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer, "and the gentleman from India is going
with him."</p>

<p>"Rather a strange time for him to go to town, isn't it?"
asked the hotel official, with the usual curiosity of his
class.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, it is; but I fancy there is something wrong with
his rent collector, and I think he is going up to take his
London rents himself."</p>

<p>"Oh! I see," said the attendant as he handed over the
receipt; "I suppose you'll take your usual pint of October?"</p>

<p>The man smacked his lips with an affirmative gesture, and the
liquor having been drawn and consumed, remounted his gig and
took his departure. As soon as the gig had been driven off Jack
turned to the barman and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"If my man comes in, tell him I have gone along the river
towards Pulborough, and ask him to follow me as I want him
particularly."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the obsequious attendant, and Jack strolled
out of the hotel.</p>

<p>As soon as he had left the inn he turned into the park, and
made his way to a secluded nook.</p>

<p>This was a spot which had been chosen as a meeting place for
Ned Chump and our hero.</p>

<p>They were precluded from intercourse at the hotel, as it
would have seemed singular for a gentleman and his
servant&mdash;no matter how confidential the latter might
be&mdash;to have held much private converse at a place like the
Bridge House Hotel.</p>

<p>This spot had therefore been chosen, and it had been arranged
that when Jack left word that he had gone towards Pulborough,
Ned was to make the best of his way to the cosy corner of the
park, where our hero awaited his advent.</p>

<p>When Ned made his appearance Jack plunged into the middle of
the question at once.</p>

<p>"Which way does the London coach go?"</p>

<p>"Through Brighton, sir," said that worthy, "and then straight
along the London-road."</p>

<p>"If we went post from here after she had started could we get
to London before she did!"</p>

<p>"Lor, yes," said Ned; "why, we could give her three hours'
good start, and then get to London first."</p>

<p>"That's what we'll do, Ned," went on Jack; "but say nothing
about this until the coach has started. There will be plenty of
time then to order the post-chaise, and there are some people
going by the coach who might be suspicious if they heard of an
intended trip to town."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Ned.</p>

<p>"Why, Ned, old fellow, have you no curiosity? I should have
thought you would have been in a burning fever to know the
meaning of this sudden change in my plans."</p>

<p>"So I am, sir."</p>

<p>"Then why not have asked? Surely you know I have every
confidence in you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I know that, skipper; and that's the very reason why I
did not ask. I knew you would tell me all in good time."</p>

<p>"All right, Ned," said our hero.</p>

<p>And he proceeded to inform the sailor of what he had
overheard in the bar of the hotel.</p>

<p>"So," he went on, "we'll get to London first, track them from
the coach to whatever hotel or house they may put up at, then we
will dodge their movements well."</p>

<p>"But what good will this do?" asked Ned, who did not quite
see how his young master was to benefit by this.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see? As soon as my unworthy cousin has
collected the rents he is bound to take coach again, either for
Arundel or to some other place where my property lies."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?" queried Ned.</p>

<p>"Well, I intend to stop that coach, and make my rascally
cousin hand over to me the proceeds of his rent audit, and I
think that will prove a very good haul."</p>

<p>Ned, now thoroughly enlightened, grinned and wished our hero
good luck in his enterprise.</p>

<p>The two now parted, and did not meet again until
nightfall.</p>

<p>In the morning Sir Michael and Morgan made their appearance
in due course, and Jack surveyed the departure of the coach from
an upper window.</p>

<p>He met his cousin's eye more than once, but the latter
utterly failed to recognise in the dashing young man about town
the lad he had virtually kicked out of his ancestral hall.</p>

<p>Alfred Morgan, however, favoured Jack with a prolonged stare,
and our hero more than once fancied he was recognised, but
whatever suspicion might have existed in his mind was allayed
when he asked the guard&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is that young spark at yonder window?"</p>

<p>"He's a young fellow just come in for a lot of money, and
mighty free he is with it too, sir, I can tell you," replied the
guard.</p>

<p>"What's his name?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>"Mr. Turnbull, sir," said the guard, as he proceeded to
adjust his horn for the final blast.</p>

<p>This answer, so coolly given, speedily quenched any latent
spark of suspicion that might have existed in the agent's subtle
brain.</p>

<p>The coach started on her journey.</p>

<p>Two hours and a-half later Jack and his faithful henchman
were bowling along at a rapid pace in the direction of
London.</p>

<p>Arrived at Croydon, they inquired whether the Arundel coach
had passed, and were informed that it had not.</p>

<p>The last stage of their journey was therefore performed at a
slightly reduced pace, and the post-chaise arrived at the
coaching-house fully half-an-hour before the arrival of Sir
Michael and Morgan.</p>

<p>This enabled Jack to order a private room, which he desired
might look out into the yard into which the coach would be
driven.</p>

<p>The two were shown to a room which most admirably suited the
purpose of our hero.</p>

<p>When the coach arrived there was Jack, snugly ensconced
within a dozen feet of the top of the coach, but perfectly
invisible to anyone outside, while himself able to see and hear
everything. The coach arrived.</p>

<p>Jack had no difficulty in ascertaining his cousin's
destination in London; for, in an imperious voice, Sir Michael
shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get me a private coach at once, and tell the coachman to
drive me to the Hummum's, Covent Garden, and look sharp about
it."</p>

<p>This was his first visit to London since he had usurped the
title, and he meant to make the most of his importance.</p>

<p>Bidding Ned follow, Jack swiftly descended the stairs, paid
the score, and passed out into the streets.</p>

<p>Here he hailed a passing hackney coach, and arrived at the
Hummum's some time before Sir Michael.</p>

<p>Jack engaged a couple of rooms, and then proceeded to make
some slight changes in his disguise, so that Morgan might not
recognise him as the man who had watched the departure of the
Arundel coach that morning.</p>

<p>For the best part of a week Jack tracked his cousin with the
persistency of a sleuth hound, until he felt convinced that the
last batch of London rents was collected.</p>

<p>It was during this period that the supposed unearthly
visitant first made his appearance in Hammersmith.</p>

<p>Although the newspapers of the time inform us that Jack
committed many robberies, there is no doubt that this is
incorrect.</p>

<p>All that he did was to visit each successive tenant after his
cousin's departure, and ascertain from the terrified people how
much money they had paid to the landlord.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="pt5"></a>PART V</h2>

<p class="first">THERE is no doubt that Jack caused an immense
amount of harm by frightening servant-girls and children, and
even people who ought to have known better; but we are not
writing to justify Jack's conduct, but merely to extract as much
from the diary or confession of Spring-Heeled Jack as will
enable our readers to form some idea of what manner of man our
hero was.</p>

<p>By these nocturnal visits on the Dacre tenants Jack soon
found out how much money his cousin was likely to be taking home
with him.</p>

<p>This sum was approximately &pound;250.</p>

<p>A nice little haul for our hero if he could only land it.</p>

<p>During Jack's nightly absences the faithful Ned kept watch
over the baronet and his friend.</p>

<p>One night on Jack's return Ned informed him that the baronet
had sent the hotel boots to book two seats for the morrow's
coach to Arundel.</p>

<p>"Then he is going straight home," said Jack. "Well, perhaps,
it is better so. If he had been going further afield he might
have banked the money. As it is, I know he will have it with
him, and I'll stick him and the mail up somewhere in the
neighbourhood of Horley, or I'll acknowledge that Michael is
right, and my name is not Jack Dacre."</p>

<p>The following morning Jack ordered a postchaise to proceed to
Horley.</p>

<p>From thence, after discharging one passenger, Jack, it was to
take the other one on to Worth, and there to await until "Mr.
Turnbull" made his appearance.</p>

<p>This programme was carried out to the letter.</p>

<p>Jack got out at Horley.</p>

<p>The carriage rattled on.</p>

<p>Jack took up his position at a fork in the roads, where he
could see the stage coach some time before it would reach him,
and at the same time be himself unseen.</p>

<p>In due course the coach came in sight.</p>

<p>Jack's heart beat nervously, but not with fear.</p>

<p>This was his first highway adventure, and who can wonder at
his excitement!</p>

<p>In another instant the coach was upon him, and with a spring
and a yell that threw the horses back upon their haunches, he
rose in the air right over the top of the coach, passengers and
all, shouting&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hand out your money and your jewellery&mdash;I am
SPRING-HEELED JACK."</p>

<p>The coachman in his terror threw himself upon the ground, and
hid his face in the dust, as if he thought he could insure his
safety by that course.</p>

<p>The guard discharged his huge blunderbuss harmlessly in the
air, thereby adding tenfold to the agony of fear from which the
coach-load of passengers were without exception suffering.</p>

<p>Having performed this deed of bravery, the guard took to his
heels and speedily disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>Jack's tall, well-built figure, dressed in its weird garb,
was one that could not fail to strike terror into the breasts of
the startled travellers.</p>

<p>One by one they threw their purses and other valuables at
Jack's feet.</p>

<p>Our hero received the tribute as though he had been an
emperor.</p>

<p>When the last passenger had deposited his valuables in front
of Jack, that worthy youth said, with a sardonic
laugh&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now you can all pick your money and jewellery up again, and
return them to your pockets&mdash;all save Michael Dacre and
Alfred Morgan."</p>

<p>In an instant the passengers sprang from the coach and
collected their valuables, too utterly surprised by the turn
events had taken to utter a word.</p>

<p>Sir Dacre looked at his confederate, and Morgan returned the
look, but neither of them could force their lips to articulate a
sound.</p>

<p>Jack stared steadily at his cousin through the two holes in
his mask, and to the guilty man's fevered imagination they
seemed to emit flashes of supernatural fire.</p>

<p>Pointing a long, claw-like finger at the would-be baronet,
Jack said, in the most sepulchral tone he could
assume&mdash;</p>

<p>"Beware, Michael Dacre; your cousin's last words to you shall
be brought home to you with full force. From this day forth
until you render up possession of the title and estates you have
usurped, you shall not know one hour's peace of mind by reason
of the dread you will feel at the appearance of Spring-Heeled
Jack."</p>

<p>"Who I am matters not to you. My powers are unlimited, I can
appear and disappear when and where I will."</p>

<p>Then turning to Alfred Morgan, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ungrateful servant of one of the kindest masters that ever
lived, your fate shall be one of such nameless horror, that,
could you but foresee what that fate would be, you would put an
end to your wretched career of crime by your own hand."</p>

<p>Then gathering up the money and jewellery belonging to the
two conspirators, Jack said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-day, friends. A pleasant journey to you. Just to prove
to you that I can disappear when I like, look at me now."</p>

<p>In another second Jack had indeed disappeared, leaving behind
him, as more than one of the bewildered passengers subsequently
averred, a strong sulphurous odour.</p>

<p>The mystery of our hero's disappearance on this occasion is
not difficult to explain.</p>

<p>While waiting for the coach he had discovered a convenient
chalk pit&mdash; no rare occurrence in that part of the
country&mdash;and into this he had sprung after uttering his
parting words, which were of course intended for Sir Michael and
Morgan.</p>

<p>After Jack's departure the panic-stricken passengers
endeavoured to rouse the coachman from his prostrate position on
the dusty road.</p>

<p>But for some time their efforts were vain, the man had
fainted from sheer fright.</p>

<p>The guard, too, had totally disappeared. What were they to
do?</p>

<p>At last one of the passengers volunteered to drive, and
placing the still insensible driver inside, the coach proceeded
on its way to its destination.</p>

<p>All the inmates of the coach looked askance at the baronet
and his companion.</p>

<p>They looked upon these two as the Jonahs of the expedition,
and it would probably have gone hard with both of them had
anyone simply have suggested their expulsion.</p>

<p>Sir Michael was not slow to perceive this, and at the next
halting place he resolved to leave the coach.</p>

<p>This resolution he communicated to Morgan.</p>

<p>"But," said the agent, "we have no money. How shall we get on
so far away from home?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that's all right," replied Sir Michael. "I am well
enough known about here&mdash;and even if I were not," he
continued, in a whisper, "I'd risk everything to get rid of
these cursed people who heard the fearful words that
spectral-looking being uttered."</p>

<p>Morgan was about to reply, but a warning "Hush!" from the
baronet stopped him in time, for more than one of the occupants
of the coach seemed to be listening intently to the conversation
between the confederates, although it was carried on in very low
tones.</p>

<p>The guilty pair took their departure from the coach at
Balcombe much to the satisfaction of their fellow
travellers.</p>

<p>Sir Michael directed the landlord of the inn to show them
into a private room.</p>

<p>The command was at once obeyed, for Sir Michael had not
exaggerated when he informed Morgan that he was well known in
that part of the country.</p>

<p>As Mr. Michael Dacre, the agent to the large and valuable
Dacre estates, he had been well known.</p>

<p>As Sir Michael Dacre, the present owner of those said
estates, he was of course much more widely known.</p>

<p>That is to say that people who would not have recognised the
agent sought by every means in their power to scrape
acquaintance with the baronet.</p>

<p>Once within the private room, and left alone with his
companion in crime, the baronet breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Phew!" he said, "I almost dreaded to enter this room, for
fear that imp of darkness might have been here before me."</p>

<p>Morgan gave forth a nervous little laugh, as much as to say
that he had no fears upon the subject, but he could not control
his features, and if ever fright and cowardice were depicted on
a human face, they might have been discerned on the not too
prepossessing countenance of Mr. Alfred Morgan, the some-time
agent to the Dacre Plantations in India.</p>

<p>"What is there to laugh at?" growled Sir Michael. "I have
lost some &pound;260, two rings, a gold repeater, and a bunch of
seals."</p>

<p>Our readers will remember that gold watch chains were seldom
worn in those days, the watch being usually attached to a piece
of silk ribbon from which depended a bunch of seals. The
time-keeper, a little smaller than one of the American clocks of
the present day, was placed in a fob pocket, and the ribbon and
seals depended on the outside of the waistcoat or breeches as
the case may be.</p>

<p>"And I," answered the agent, "am in quite as sorry a plight,
for I have lost &pound;60, all the money I had left in England,
besides my watch and chain."</p>

<p>This chain being a magnificent piece of oriental gold carving
which Morgan had absolutely "stolen" from Jack's father, and
consequently from Jack himself.</p>

<p>"Well," cried Sir Michael, testily, "it's no use crying over
spilt milk; and still less use for us to quarrel. I will be your
banker until you can draw upon your Indian property."</p>

<p>"None of your sneer, Sir Michael Dacre," began the agent,
angrily.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! man, let's make a truce of it, and if we cannot
continue friends, let us at least avoid any resemblance to open
hostilities."</p>

<p>"All right," sulkily assented Morgan.</p>

<p>"It is our only chance," went on Sir Michael. "I don't know
who or what in the fiend's name this Spring-Heeled Jack may be,
but I must confess that my nerves are terribly shaken by the
events that have occurred since I turned my illegitimate cousin
out of Dacre Hall."</p>

<p>"Illegitimate?" said Alfred Morgan with a sneer.</p>

<p>"That this so-called Spring-Heeled Jack," continued the
baronet, ignoring the interruption, "is not an ordinary
highwayman is self-evident, or he would not have returned some
hundreds of pounds in money, and as much more in jewellery, to
our fellow passengers by the Arundel coach."</p>

<p>"And it is also equally certain," said Morgan, "that this
stalwart man who can spring over the top of a mail-coach,
horses, driver, passengers and all, cannot be that puny lad who
laid claim to the Dacre title and lands."</p>

<p>"Then who can it be?" cried Dacre, half in despair. "It
cannot be that sailor, Clump, or whatever his name was."</p>

<p>"Chump, my dear Sir Michael, Ned Chump!" rejoined Morgan, who
could hardly repress his sneering manner. "No, I do not see how
it could possibly be the sailor; but one thing is
certain&mdash;and that is that this individual is acting on
behalf of your cousin, and although I have too much sense to
believe in the supernatural, the whole thing passes all
comprehension. First this Spring-Heeled Jack&mdash;and,
recollect, your cousin adopted that name out of your own
lips&mdash;appears at Dorking, puts a half-lunatic girl back in
the possession of her property, collects more than the rent due
to you from Brown's farm, but at the same time leaves a
strangely worded receipt, which prevents you from doing anything
but grin and bear it."</p>

<p>"True," broke in Sir Michael, angrily.</p>

<p>"Then we hear that a supernatural being has appeared to your
Hammersmith tenants in turn, and has put to one and all the
identical question&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How much rent have you paid to Michael Dacre?"</p>

<p>"True again," replied Dacre.</p>

<p>"You will notice," said Morgan, with what was meant to be
cutting irony, "the absence of the 'Sir' in the formula."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, proceed," snarled the unhappy wretch.</p>

<p>"Then we take the coach on our way to your ancestral
halls&mdash;and what happens? Why this mysterious being about
whom we have heard so much, and about whom we know so little,
stopped our coach in a manner hitherto unheard of, half
frightened the driver to death, takes all the money and
valuables the coach contains, then calmly returns each of the
other passengers their property, only retaining for his own use
that which belongs to Sir Michael Dacre, the present head of
that proud house, and that which belongs to Mr. Alfred Morgan,
at your service, the agent for the Dacre plantations in the East
Indies."</p>

<p>"Well, and what do you suggest, Morgan?" said the
pseudo-baronet, growing pale as the agent went on with his cool
and matter-of-fact statement.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Morgan; "I hardly know at present what to
suggest. To one thing, however, I have made up my mind."</p>

<p>"And that is?" queried Dacre, anxiously.</p>

<p>"To remain in England till this ghost is laid," replied
Morgan.</p>

<p>The baronet gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Yes," the agent continued, "I am not going to run the risk
of losing my hard-earned Indian estates&mdash;and that is what I
feel sure I must ensue if I leave you to cope single-handed with
the trio who are in league against you&mdash;maybe against
me."</p>

<p>"Trio!" cried the baronet, faintly.</p>

<p>"Yes, trio! Jack Dacre, Ned Chump, and last, but not least,
Spring-Heeled Jack."</p>

<p>To carry on our extraordinary story in a perfectly
intelligible form it is necessary that we should leave the
conspirators at the inn at Balcombe, and look out for our hero
and his faithful comrade.</p>

<p>Jack, thanks to his ample cloak, had no difficulty in
reaching the appointed place of meeting at Worth.</p>

<p>Ned Chump, who had been worrying himself into a state of
nervous anxiety almost bordering upon madness, received our hero
literally with open arms.</p>

<p>"How did you get on, sir?" asked the tar.</p>

<p>"Don't 'sir' me," replied Jack, banteringly.</p>

<p>"Well, then, skipper, if that will suit you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I got on prime, Ned," replied our hero, and he broke out
into such a peal of laughter as astonished even Ned, who had
already had many experiences of his young master's gaiety and
exuberance of spirits.</p>

<p>Ned, as was his wont, remained silent, and Jack, who by this
time perfectly understood his henchman's manner, went on to
explain the events that had occurred since they had parted at
Harley.</p>

<p>"And now," said Jack, "I will change myself into Mr. Turnbull
again for a short time."</p>

<p>"Yes, skipper," said Ned, as he laid Jack's private clothes
out for him.</p>

<p>"And then we will make for the Fox, at Balcombe, where the
Arundel coach must have stopped after I had left it."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Ned, in a matter-of-fact tone, as if his
interest in the affair was a very minute one.</p>

<p>"If my surmise is correct," went on Jack, "Michael Dacre and
the rascal Morgan will be resting there."</p>

<p>"Why so, skipper?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Because, after my word of warning, the passengers by the
Arundel coach would not look with very favourable eyes upon
those two arch conspirators, and I take it that they will have
been only too glad to leave the coach at the first opportunity,
and that must most undoubtedly be the Fox Inn."</p>

<p>"All right, skipper," replied the sailor. "I'm on."</p>

<p>By this time our hero had changed his clothes, or rather had
put those belonging to the supposed Mr. Turnbull on over his
mephistophilean garb.</p>

<p>Some refreshments which had been previously ordered were now
brought in, and after discussing these and settling the bill,
Jack and his attendant left the house, the former telling the
host that he might be back that way later on, but he was not
quite sure, as if he met a friend of his at the Fox he might
pass the night there, but, under any circumstances, he should
return to Worth the following day, as his one object in coming
there was to inspect the famous old church, the only object of
general interest which the village possessed.</p>

<p>Jack had made this explanation as he did not want to carry
his and Ned's luggage about with him on this reconnoitring
expedition.</p>

<p>The landlord, only too pleased at the thought of seeing his
liberal guest and his servant once again, gladly took charge of
the travelling trunks, and Jack and Ned were soon far on their
way toward a the Fox.</p>

<p>Entering the inn, Jack called for two flagons of ale, and in
paying for the same took good care to expose the contents of his
purse.</p>

<p>The host's eye caught a glimpse of the gold pieces it
contained, and he instantly made up his mind that our hero
should leave some if not all of them behind him.</p>

<p>"Fine day, sir," said mine host, by way of opening a
conversation.</p>

<p>"Very," replied Jack, who wanted nothing better.</p>

<p>"Have you come down here to attend the coming of age of
Squire Thornhill's eldest son?" asked the innkeeper.</p>

<p>"No," replied Jack. "My servant and myself are on a walking
tour. We have left our luggage at Worth, and have merely
strolled over here to see if my friend, Lord Amberly, is staying
here or in the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the now obtrusively obsequious host, quite
won over by "my friend, Lord Amberly," added to the sight of the
gold in Jack's purse.</p>

<p>"Lord Amberly is not staying here; but we are not quite
devoid of quality, for Sir Michael Dacre, one of our county
magistrates, and a friend of his are at this moment inmates of
my house."</p>

<p>"Sir Michael Dacre?" queried Jack, suppressing his
excitement. "Why his hall is not more than twenty miles from
here is it, how comes he to be staying at an inn so near his own
home?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five miles, sir," said the landlord, correctingly,
"and the reason that he is staying here is that the Arundel
coach was stuck up by a strange sort of highwayman."</p>

<p>"A strange sort of highwayman?" said Jack, in tones of well
assumed surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a strange sort of highwayman," replied the
landlord.</p>

<p>And the worthy host proceeded to give Jack a highly
embellished account of the attack upon the mail coach,
adding&mdash;</p>

<p>"And as this strange joker, who calls himself Spring-Heeled
Jack, only robbed the baronet and his friend, the other
passengers seemed to think as how they weren't much good, and so
were glad to get rid of them, when they decided to stop
here."</p>

<p>"And how do you know that they are any good?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied the loquacious landlord, "I knowed Sir Michael
when he was the late baronet's agent&mdash;he's all right as far
as I am concerned, whatever he may be to others."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Jack, who had noticed something
peculiar in the host's utterance of the last words.</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing, sir. Nothing!" replied the man, evidently
discovering for the first time that his tongue had been wagging
a little too fast.</p>

<p>Collecting his somewhat discomposed faculties as quickly as
he could, the landlord put the question to Jack once
more&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then you have not come here to see the grand doings at
Thornhill Hall?"</p>

<p>"No," replied our hero, "I did not come with that purpose,
but as my friend Lord Amberly is not here, I may as well stop
until I hear from him, and in the meantime the Thornhill
festivities will serve to prevent my getting the vapours. That
is," he went on, "if you can accommodate my servant and myself
with a bed."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the landlord, with a bright twinkle in his
eye, as he thought of the contents of our hero's purse, to say
nothing of the prestige that would attach to his house if only
Lord Amberly should turn up to meet his young friend.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said, "that is if you do not mind occupying a
double-bedded room."</p>

<p>Then he continued in an apologetic manner&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Michael and his friend particularly stipulated for a
double-bedded room sir, and indeed we have only one other in the
house."</p>

<p>"Ha! afraid to sleep alone," said Jack to himself; "but I
think I'll take a still further rise out of them to-night."</p>

<p>Then turning to the landlord, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! a double bedded-room will suit me. We've been through
too many adventures together to mind that, haven't we, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the sailor with a suppressed chuckle.</p>

<p>With a fulsome bow the host ushered Jack and Ned to their
apartments, indicating as he did so the one already occupied by
the baronet and his friend.</p>

<p>Our hero ordered dinner for seven o'clock, and leaving Ned in
the bedroom, proceeded down into the bar again.</p>

<p>Finishing his ale he strode out of the door and rapidly took
in the geography of the house.</p>

<p>He had no difficulty in fixing the position of the baronet's
room, and to his intense delight saw that the windows were mere
frail casements of lead and glass, that hardly served to keep
out the elements.</p>

<p>It was rapidly getting dusk, and re-entering the house Jack
said to the landlord&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm going for a little stroll, give my man all he wants, and
put the charges down to me, and mind my dinner is ready at
seven."</p>

<p>The host humbly bowed his acquiescence, and Jack again left
the house.</p>

<p>He had about an hour in hand before dinner, and it was
absolutely necessary for the success of his scheme that he
should be back punctually to time, and he had a lot to do in
that single hour.</p>

<p>To return to the would-be baronet and his fellow conspirator,
who were still seated in the private room.</p>

<p>With Spring-Heeled Jack's name upon his lips&mdash;for that
was the only topic of conversation between the guilty
men&mdash;the baronet rose to ring the bell for lights.</p>

<p>Even as he did so a crash of glass was heard, and the object
of their fears stood before them in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>"Strip yourselves, both of you," cried Jack in fearful
accents, "strip yourselves to the skin. I told you I was
ubiquitous&mdash;and I am here. Strip at once, or dread the dire
vengeance of Spring-Heeled Jack!"</p>

<p>Too thoroughly frightened to ring the bell for assistance,
Sir Michael and Morgan stood as if turned to stone, looking at
the weird intruder into the privacy of their room.</p>

<p>Our hero found it difficult to restrain a smile, so ludicrous
was the terror exhibited by his unworthy cousin and the
agent.</p>

<p>But the faint ripple of enjoyment which passed over his face
was not noticed by either of the conspirators.</p>

<p>Jack knew that he could not afford to waste a moment, even
though the prolongation of his cousin's fright would have
afforded him exquisite enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Strip yourselves," he therefore repeated, in still louder
tones, "and quickly, too, or it will fare badly with both of
you."</p>

<p>Sir Michael looked at his fellow conspirator, but, seeing
nothing of an encouraging nature in his face, he commenced to
take off his coat.</p>

<p>Morgan, accepting the inevitable, proceeded to follow the
baronet's example.</p>

<p>Jack watched them closely, and every time one or the other of
them paused he threatened them with horrible penalties if they
dared delay any longer.</p>

<p>At last the two worthies stood in front of our hero as naked
as they were when they first entered this world.</p>

<p>Bidding them roll their garments into a bundle Jack prepared
to take his departure.</p>

<p>He unfastened what remained of the casement through which he
had so unceremoniously made his way into the apartment, and
threw the broken frames wide open.</p>

<p>When the clothes had been made into a rather unwieldy-looking
parcel, Jack caught hold of it, and, placing it on his shoulder,
sprang literally over head and heels out of the window.</p>

<p>For some five minutes after Jack's departure neither of the
naked men could move to call for assistance, so utterly cowed
were they by the suddenness of the weird apparition's
appearance.</p>

<p>Morgan was the first to recover anything like self-possession,
and with an unearthly yell he sprang towards the
bell-rope, and gave such frantic tugs at it that it very soon
broke under his vigorous hand.</p>

<p>But he had succeeded in making noise enough to rouse the
whole house, and a minute later the room was half-filled by the
landlord and his servants and many of his customers.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, gentlemen?" asked Boniface.</p>

<p>"Matter, indeed!" cried Sir Michael, who had by this time
somewhat recovered his normal faculties. "Matter enough I should
think. That scoundrel who robbed the coach we came down by, has
been here and has taken away all our clothes."</p>

<p>The titters and smiles that had been heard and seen among the
domestics suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>Dim rumours had already reached Balcombe of the existence of
Spring-Heeled Jack, and now here he was, or had just been, right
in their midst.</p>

<p>A great terror seemed to have crept into the hearts of all of
them, and none seemed inclined to stir.</p>

<p>"Someone of you rush after him," cried Dacre, angrily. "The
bundle is a heavy one, and he cannot have got far with it."</p>

<p>But no one offered to start in pursuit.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" cried Morgan; "if one of you had had the sense
to start off directly I summoned you the thief would have been
caught by this time, or, at least, our clothes would have been
recovered," he added, as the thought flashed through his brain
that, perhaps, it would be well for his employer and himself if
Jack were not caught.</p>

<p>"I don't think we could have done much good," said the
landlord, rather nettled at the tone affairs were taking. "If
this Spring-Heeled Jack, as you call him, is good enough to
stick up and rob a coach-load of people, and is clever enough to
come here and take the very clothes from off your backs, I don't
quite see what chance I or any of my people would have against
him even if one of us had started off immediately in
pursuit."</p>

<p>The two sufferers, who had by this time entirely come to
their senses, both immediately acknowledged that the landlord of
the Fox was right.</p>

<p>Sir Michael, therefore, putting the best face on the matter
that he could, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"True, landlord, true; and now, like a good fellow, see if
you cannot get us some clothes, anything like a fit. Our present
garb is not a pleasant one."</p>

<p>And indeed it was not, for Sir Michael was clothed toga-wise
in a large tablecloth, which he had thrown over his shoulders in
haste while Morgan was ringing the bell, and Morgan himself had
only been able to secure the hearth-rug, with which he had
enveloped his body, so as to preserve some semblance of
decency.</p>

<p>Ordering the crowd of frightened servants and guests to leave
the room, the landlord turned to Sir Michael, when they were
alone, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I trust, Sir Michael, that you and your friend will leave my
house as speedily as possible. I have my living to get, and this
sort of thing is calculated to give a house a bad name."</p>

<p>"Insolent scoundrel&mdash;" began Dacre.</p>

<p>"No names, Sir Michael," answered the landlord. "I pay my
rent and my brewers regularly. There has been no complaint made
against the Fox since I have had it, and I do not fear anything
that you can do to me. As to you yourself, the case is
different."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" angrily asked Dacre.</p>

<p>"What do I mean? Well, it is strange that this mysterious
Spring-Heeled Jack should be always on your track. I have heard
that he collected rents in your name at Dorking. Then you tell
me that he robs you on the Arundel coach; and, by-the-bye, all
the passengers by that coach put you down as the cause of the
stoppage, and now you tell me that this mysterious being has
entered your room by your window, some twenty feet from the
ground, and, though you were two and he only one, he managed to
strip and leave you as naked as you were when you were
born."</p>

<p>Morgan nudged Dacre, and Jack's cousin had sense enough to
see that there was no good to come by continuing the
argument.</p>

<p>"Very well," Dacre replied, in a gruff manner. "Let us have
what clothes you have, and we will leave your house the first
thing in the morning. It is too late to think of going on to
Dacre Hall to-night."</p>

<p>The landlord acquiesced in a sullen manner,
muttering&mdash;</p>

<p>"If Master Spring-Heeled Jack takes it into his head to
return here before the morning out you shall both turn, no
matter what the time or the weather may be."</p>

<p>With this Boniface left the room.</p>

<p>"This is getting serious," said Morgan, as soon as he was
left alone with the baronet.</p>

<p>"Serious, indeed," said Dacre, testily. "I fully believe,
Morgan, that the foul thing's threats will come true, and that
he will make our lives a curse to us."</p>

<p>"What can we do in the matter?" asked Morgan. "Can you not
suggest something? Recollect what you have gained by denying
your cousin's legitimacy, and pull yourself together and let us
see what had better be done, under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"Better be done, forsooth," said Sir Michael. "How can we
arrange to do anything when we do not know whether our adversary
is mortal or not. If he is mortal we dare not lock him up, as he
evidently knows the secret of the Dacre succession; and if he is
not mortal, of what I avail our struggles against him?"</p>

<p>"Not mortal, pshaw!" replied Morgan.</p>

<p>"The man's mortal enough, though there is something
mysterious about him, I'll allow. We'll provide ourselves with a
pair of pistols, and when next we are favoured by a visit we
will test with half an ounce of lead whether Spring-Heeled Jack
is mortal or not."</p>

<p>As the agent concluded, a wild, wailing shriek, ending in a
peal of demoniacal laughter, struck upon their ears, and,
rushing to the window, they beheld, standing on the top of the
pump in front of the Inn, the awful figure of their hated
foe.</p>

<p>With another unearthly scream Jack turned a somersault from
the top of the pump, and long ere any of the inmates of the inn
who had heard the taunting laugh had time to pass out of doors,
Spring-Heeled Jack had disappeared, the gathering gloom leaving
no trace behind.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, and "Mr. Turnbull," looking as cool and
calm as it is possible for a young English gentleman to look,
returned to the Fox, and as he called for a glass of sherry and
bitters he asked if his dinner was ready.</p>

<p>With a thousand apologies the landlord explained to him that,
owing to the state of excitement into which the whole house had
been thrown by the appearance of Spring&mdash;Heeled Jack, the
dinner was not quite ready.</p>

<p>Jack, of course, asked for particulars, and the garrulous
host gave the chief actor such a highly-embellished narrative of
what had actually occurred, that our hero absolutely suffered in
his endeavour to keep from laughing.</p>

<p>He succeeded, however, and bidding the landlord hasten the
dinner as much as possible, he entered the room reserved for
himself and Ned Chump.</p>

<p>Here he found his faithful follower, and that jolly salt
broke into a peal of uncontrollable laughter as Jack narrated
the story of the last hour's adventure, winding up the tale by
explaining that he had quietly dropped the bundle of clothes
down a neighbouring disused well.</p>

<p>In the meantime a very dissimilar scene was being enacted in
the room occupied by Sir Michael Dacre and Alfred Morgan.</p>

<p>Both of the conspirators felt dissatisfied.</p>

<p>Morgan inwardly accused Dacre of cowardice, and felt certain
that eventually John Dacre would gain his own.</p>

<p>The usurping baronet, on the other hand, blamed Morgan for
all the ills and evils that had arisen.</p>

<p>The two passed the night somehow, but it is comparatively
certain that neither of them enjoyed even one half-hour's
sleep.</p>

<p>Our hero and his henchman, on the contrary, partook of a
capital dinner, smoked and drank and enjoyed themselves, and
then slept the sleep of the just.</p>

<p>In the morning, much to the delight of the landlord of the
Fox, Sir Michael Dacre and Alfred Morgan took their departure
from the inn.</p>

<p>Our hero and Ned Chump, who had been informed that they were
about to leave, had secured a position from which they could
obtain a good view of the two disconsolate men.</p>

<p>And a pretty pair of beauties they looked.</p>

<p>Sir Michael was attired in a suit of clothes belonging to the
landlord, and which was almost large enough to have accommodated
his companion in crime as well as himself.</p>

<p>Morgan's borrowed suit fitted him a little better, but as the
original owner occupied the position of ostler, gardener, and
general factotum, it may easily be imagined that the garments
were not particularly becoming.</p>

<p>"Well, skipper," cried Ned, as the post-chaise drove off, "no
disrespect to you, but a more ugly, hang-dog fellow than your
cousin I never saw; he looks well enough when he is dressed
spick and span, but now he looks what he really is."</p>

<p>And Jack could not dissent, for it would have been difficult
to find a more despicable-looking man than the mock baronet
decked in the inn-keeper's clothes.</p>

<p>Jack thought it advisable to stop at the Fox for another
night, and then sent over to Worth for the luggage.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest suspicion had been aroused in anyone's
mind that this sedate Mr. Turnbull had had anything to do with
the stoppage of the Arundel coach or the robbery of the clothes
of the two guests at the Fox Inn."</p>

<p>Jack and Ned left a very pleasant impression behind them when
they took their departure for Arundel.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="pt6"></a>PART VI</h2>

<p class="first">OUR hero had resolved to make the Bridge House
his headquarters, as he had had such remarkable piece of luck
there already.</p>

<p>For was it not owing to what he had heard while staying there
that he was enabled to relieve his cousin and Mr. Alfred Morgan
of their superfluous cash?</p>

<p>If our hero had known what important results his resolve to
go back to the hotel at Arundel would have, he would have
literally danced for joy.</p>

<p>This visit to Arundel led to an adventure which introduced
him to his future wife, and we may safely say that hardly ever
was man blessed with such a helpmate as was the wife of
Spring-Heeled Jack.</p>

<p>The manner of our hero's introduction to his future wife was
as follows.</p>

<p>The day after the arrival of Jack Dacre and Ned at the hotel
a carriage drawn by four horses drove up to the inn door.</p>

<p>The occupants were an old gentleman and lady, apparently his
wife; in addition there were two younger women, one might have
been a servant or companion, the other was evidently the
daughter of the old gentleman, so great was the likeness between
the two.</p>

<p>Jack was lounging about in front of the hotel when the
carriage drove up, and a strange but almost indescribable thrill
passed through his whole body at the sight of the girl we have
just alluded to.</p>

<p>People may laugh at love at first sight, but in the case of
Jack Dacre it was an undoubted fact.</p>

<p>Our hero pressed forward to get a better view of the young
lady who had made such a strange impression upon his ardent
imagination, and as he did so he had the satisfaction of hearing
the old gentleman say to the host that he intended to pass the
night in the house if beds were available.</p>

<p>Mine host informed the traveller that there was plenty of
room, and to Jack's intense delight the party entered the
hotel.</p>

<p>"Hang it!" said Jack to himself, "she's a stunner, and no
mistake. Now, how can I contrive to get an introduction to her?
I wonder whether the old gentleman will go to sleep after
dinner, and if she will go for a walk? I must keep my eyes open,
and chance may befriend me."</p>

<p>And chance did indeed befriend Jack, for after the old
gentleman and his family had dined, the young lady and her
companion (for such the third female of the party turned out to
be) started off for a walk.</p>

<p>Jack, affecting a nonchalance which he was far from feeling,
sauntered out after them, keeping, however, at a respectful
distance.</p>

<p>The two girls made their way down to the side of the river
Arun, and choosing a quiet spot looked about for a seat.</p>

<p>A few yards further on they spied a tree, a large branch of
which stretched right across the towing-path till it reached
nearly half way across the river.</p>

<p>Surely no more delightful seat could have been devised.</p>

<p>The two girls at once proceeded to take advantage of this
charming resting-place.</p>

<p>Jack ensconced himself close by, just out of hearing, but
where he could see every movement they made.</p>

<p>Once the two girls had made themselves comfortable a very
animated conversation seemed to commence between them; then
suddenly, whether by accident or design Jack did not at the time
know, the companion placed her hand on the young lady's
shoulder, and an instant later the only girl who had ever found
her way to Jack's heart was being rapidly carried towards the
sea in the swirling waters of the Arun.</p>

<p>Without waiting to see what became of the girl who had caused
the catastrophe, Jack threw off his coat and sprang into the
water.</p>

<p>Strong and steady was his stroke, and the girl had only just
come to the surface for the first time when our hero was beside
her.</p>

<p>One minute later and she was on shore, and Jack had the
supreme satisfaction of seeing the rich glowing tint of life
return to her pallid cheeks.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and stared at Jack in wonder.</p>

<p>"Where is my maid, Ellen Clarke?" she asked, as she glanced
hastily around.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Jack. "I was so anxious to be of
service to you that I did not see what became of her. And, what
is more, I don't think you need care much, for it certainly
seemed to me that but for her you would not have been subjected
to such a ducking. But come, let me carry you to the hotel. The
sooner you get out of those wet clothes the better."</p>

<p>And without waiting for a reply Jack caught her in his arms
and started off towards the hotel with her at a gentle trot.</p>

<p>To his sturdy young frame such a burden counted next to
nothing.</p>

<p>Jack could see by the look half of terror and half of
curiosity in her face that there was something to be accounted
for in the manner in which she had fallen into the river; but he
wisely refrained from worrying her with any questions at the
moment.</p>

<p>Before Jack reached the hotel with his fair burden they met
the maid, accompanied by three or four of the hotel attendants,
making their way towards the river.</p>

<p>The maid's face flushed crimson, and then as suddenly paled,
as she caught sight of Jack and her young mistress.</p>

<p>Our hero's quick, shrewd glance marked her manner, and he had
no need to ask any question.</p>

<p>Whatever might have been her motive, beyond all doubt the
companion had pushed her mistress into the river.</p>

<p>Young Dacre had gone through so much since his inopportune
arrival in England that he had acquired an amount of worldly
wisdom far beyond his years.</p>

<p>He, therefore, wisely held his tongue, and did not tell the
girl that he had seen the "accident" and its cause.</p>

<p>The companion recovered her self-composure in a moment when
she found that Jack did not accuse her of attempting to murder
her mistress.</p>

<p>"Oh! Miss Lucy," she cried, "thank Heaven you are saved. I
should never have forgiven myself had you been drowned. It was
my fault that you fell in. I must have leant too heavily on your
shoulder, and caused you to lose your balance."</p>

<p>These last few words were accompanied by a swift, sly glance
at our hero.</p>

<p>Although Jack caught the look he took no notice of it, but
simply strode on towards the Bridge House.</p>

<p>Surrendering his charge to her father, he proceeded upstairs
to change his clothes.</p>

<p>While so engaged a knock was heard at the door, and a waiter
handed in a card on which was written&mdash;</p>

<p>"Major-General Sir Charles Grahame will be pleased to see the
saviour of his child at the earliest opportunity."</p>

<p>Our hero with a bright smile told the man that he would wait
upon the general immediately, and he was vain enough to take a
little extra care over brushing his hair, and so on, in case he
should have the felicity of seeing the lovely girl whom he had
just rescued from a watery grave.</p>

<p>Finding his way to the general's room, Jack's courage nearly
deserted him.</p>

<p>He who had shown so much daring in endeavouring to checkmate
his rascally cousin, felt as nervous as a young girl at her
first ball, at the idea of meeting the lovely creature who had
made such an impression upon him.</p>

<p>But his nervousness was entirely unnecessary, for on entering
the room he found it tenanted by the general and a lady who was
certainly some dozen years older than the charming girl he hoped
and yet feared to see.</p>

<p>"Permit me to present to you my wife, Lady Grahame,
Mr.&mdash;," said the general with a pause.</p>

<p>"Turnbull, sir, Jack Turnbull, at your service," replied our
hero with a guilty blush, for he absolutely hated himself at
that moment for the deception, innocent as it was, that he was
practising on the father of the girl with whom he had so madly
and so unaccountably fallen in love.</p>

<p>The formality of introduction having been gone through, the
general, who had noticed the flush on Jack's cheek, but who had
attributed it to a far different cause, endeavoured to place
Jack entirely at his ease.</p>

<p>Thanking our hero cordially, but not fulsomely, for having
saved his daughter's life, the general wound up by
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"But Lucy shall thank you herself in the morning."</p>

<p>"Then she is in no danger?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh! dear no," replied the general. "The doctor has seen her,
and he says that it wants nothing but a good night's rest to put
her right."</p>

<p>The lady had not spoken until now, having merely curtseyed
when Jack was presented to her, but now she seemed compelled to
say something, and, smiling in a manner that caused our hero to
shudder, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, my dear daughter shall thank you herself in the
morning, Mr. Turnbull."</p>

<p>"Your daughter?" said Jack, in accents of surprise, for the
general's wife could not, by any possibility, have been the
mother of the fair girl he had saved.</p>

<p>"Well, my stepdaughter," she said, with a self-satisfied
smirk, for she took Jack's exclamation of surprise as a
compliment.</p>

<p>After a few more words our hero returned to his own room, and
gave Ned an account of his adventure, winding up the story by
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"And I cannot help thinking that Lady Grahame and the
companion have leagued together to destroy that lovely girl's
life."</p>

<p>"Monstrous!" cried Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes; monstrous, indeed. But I will spoil their little game.
I shall keep close watch upon them, and if I find them in
conversation together to-night I will treat them to a view of
Spring-Heeled Jack, and in their terror find an opportunity of
extracting a confession from one or both of them."</p>

<p>Our hero speedily changed his attire for his demoniacal garb,
and, wrapping himself in his huge cloak, he passed down the
stairs, and left the hotel without attracting any undue
attention.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, and, making his way round to the back
of the house, where the general's suite of rooms was situated,
Jack with one spring landed in the balcony which ran round that
side of the house.</p>

<p>He looked in at the first window he came to, and the only
occupant of the room was the old general, who was taking an
after-dinner nap.</p>

<p>The next room he passed he did not look through the window.
Something subtle seemed to tell him that this was where his
loved one lay at rest.</p>

<p>But at the next window he paused and listened.</p>

<p>The words that fell upon his ears literally burnt themselves
into his brain.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" he cried; "I am only just in time."</p>

<p>Another instant, and the occupants of the room, Lady Grahame
and Ellen Clarke, beheld standing before them the terrible
figure of Spring-Heeled Jack.</p>

<p>"HA! ha!" cried Jack, "your intended crime is such a
monstrous one, that even I, Spring&mdash;Heeled Jack, fiend
though I may be, am bound to prevent its consummation."</p>

<p>Only one of the two women heard these words, for Ellen Clarke
had fainted at the appearance of the fearful apparition.</p>

<p>Lady Grahame was possessed of stronger nerves, or she would
never have been able to plan the death of her lovely and
innocent step-daughter.</p>

<p>For that was the purport of the conversation which Jack had
overheard whilst standing outside the window.</p>

<p>It appeared that the whole of General Grahame's private
fortune must pass, by the provisions of his father's will, to
Lucy Grahame, but if she died before the general, then he would
have absolute control over the property and could leave it to
whomsoever he pleased.</p>

<p>Lady Grahame had argued to herself that if she could but
remove Lucy from her path she could easily work upon the general
to make a will in her sole favour.</p>

<p>This once accomplished how easy it would be to rid herself of
her elderly husband, and with the wealth that would then be at
her disposal she would easily be able to marry a younger and
handsomer man, and spend the rest of her days in riotous luxury
and dissipation&mdash;for such was the bent of her mind, and the
general's quiet mode of life did not at all meet her views.</p>

<p>All this Jack had been able to gather whilst standing in the
balcony before the window of Lady Grahame's chamber.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that the sudden appearance of Jack in the
midst of such a conversation should have sent the lady's maid
into a fainting fit.</p>

<p>Upon the hardened Lady Grahame, however, his appearance
produced no outward appearance of fear.</p>

<p>What amount of trepidation was at her heart Heaven alone
could tell.</p>

<p>She stood erect and looked Jack dauntlessly in the face.</p>

<p>"I fear not fiend nor man," she cried; "the former I doubt
the existence of, therefore you must be the latter. So name your
price, Spring-Heeled Jack, I will pay it whatever it is, and
trust to your honour to hold your tongue when you have received
it."</p>

<p>Jack gave a demoniacal grin.</p>

<p>"Not that you could do me any harm by repeating the words
that you have doubtless overheard," she went on.</p>

<p>Again Jack smiled his fearful smile.</p>

<p>"Who would take the word of a highwayman and midnight thief
against that of Lady Grahame?" she cried, defiantly, now
thoroughly convinced that she did stand in some amount of danger
at the hands of this extraordinary being.</p>

<p>Jack made no reply, but seizing her by the wrist drew her
towards the chamber door.</p>

<p>Vainly she struggled, Jack's powerful grasp bound her too
fast for any chance of escape.</p>

<p>Surely but slowly she felt herself approaching the door that
would lead her straight into the presence of her husband.</p>

<p>She was about to offer Jack money once more, though she felt
certain from his manner that it would be of no avail, when the
door suddenly opened and the general stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>With a startled look he took in the whole scene.</p>

<p>Ere he had time to inquire the meaning of the strange drama
being enacted before his very eyes Jack had released his hold
upon Lady Grahame's wrist, and bowing gravely to the general,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon this intrusion, Sir Charles Grahame."</p>

<p>The baronet started slightly as he heard his name mentioned,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Pardon this intrusion; but I am here on a very serious
mission, and I must kindly ask you to answer any questions which
I may put to you."</p>

<p>Again the baronet bowed, for he was strangely impressed by
Jack's manner, and felt that our hero's presence in that room
was caused by no sinister motive.</p>

<p>"Go on, mysterious being; whatever you may be, go on, and
anything consistent with honour I will tell you."</p>

<p>"You have a daughter, Lucy?" said Jack.</p>

<p>"I have," answered Sir Charles.</p>

<p>"By the terms of your father's will she is entitled to the
whole of your estates at your death, and you cannot alter
it?"</p>

<p>"By the terms of the entail of the Grahame estate, which are
bound to descend to the eldest daughter in the absence of male
issue, Lucy is irrevocably entitled to my estates at my death;
all that I have power over is any money which I may have
saved."</p>

<p>The baronet answered freely and fully, for he was more than
ever confident now that Jack was here for the good of himself
and his daughter.</p>

<p>"If she died before you it would be in your power to dispose
of the property as you chose?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Yes, for the entail would cease then. We two, my daughter
and I, are the only living representatives of our branch of the
Grahames, and the time-honoured baronetcy must die with me."</p>

<p>"Then let me tell you," cried Jack, rising to his full height
and pointing his long claw-like finger at the still defiant,
although silent, Lady Grahame. "Let me tell you that I have
heard this night a plot&mdash;a plot so fiend-like that I cannot
doubt but that you will feel incredulous at first, but a plot
the existence of which you are bound eventually to believe."</p>

<p>"Go on, for Heaven's sake!" cried the baronet, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"At any rate," said Jack, "whether you believe my words or
not I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have saved
your lovely daughter's life; for after hearing what I am going
to tell you, doubt it as you may, you will be put upon your
guard, and that will be quite sufficient."</p>

<p>At the mention of his daughter's name the baronet gave a
gasp, but he could not articulate the words he desired to.</p>

<p>Briefly but impressively Jack told the baronet how he had
witnessed the attempted murder on the Arun, of course concealing
his identity with Jack Turnbull.</p>

<p>Lady Grahame now for the first time spoke.</p>

<p>"Why listen to this midnight thief?" cried she.</p>

<p>"Silence!" thundered Jack.</p>

<p>Then turning to the baronet he explained that his suspicions
being aroused he had listened outside the window, and he
repeated word by word the conversation he had overheard between
Lady Grahame and Ellen Clarke.</p>

<p>Horror, doubt, and uncertainty were expressed on the
baronet's face as Lady Grahame vehemently denied the charge,
showering every kind of vituperation upon the head of
Spring-Heeled Jack.</p>

<p>Our hero stood motionless, the satanic grin on his face.</p>

<p>He knew full well that whether the old soldier believed his
story or not, Lucy's life was at least safe from the
machinations of her murderous stepmother.</p>

<p>Before the baronet had time to open his lips to reply to his
wife, a fresh voice broke upon his ear.</p>

<p>The girl Ellen Clarke had recovered her senses, and had
thrown herself upon her knees at the feet of the general.</p>

<p>"Oh! forgive me, Sir Charles," cried the girl, as she
grovelled on the ground in front of the astonished baronet. "It
is all true; but I was sorely tempted by Lady Grahame, who had
me in her power, as I had once stolen a diamond ring belonging
to her, and she threatened me with imprisonment if I did not
comply with her request, or rather commands. Pray&mdash;pray
forgive me."</p>

<p>The poor old man, who had faced the enemy on many a well-fought
field, thoroughly broke down at this, and agonising sobs
thrilled his manly chest.</p>

<p>Lady Grahame stood pale and silent.</p>

<p>She knew the game was up.</p>

<p>She had played her last card, and had lost.</p>

<p>Well, she must accept the inevitable.</p>

<p>She had not much fear of any earthly punishment for her
meditated crime.</p>

<p>She knew full well that Sir Charles's keen sense of honour
would never permit him to blazon his shame abroad.</p>

<p>For shame it would be for one who bore the honoured name of
Grahame to stand at a criminal bar, charged with conspiracy and
attempt to murder a step-daughter.</p>

<p>Jack surveyed the scene for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>Then he moved towards the window.</p>

<p>Turning to the baronet, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My work is done; I have saved your daughter's life; with the
punishment you may mete out to these two wretched women I have
nothing to do. Farewell!"</p>

<p>"Stay!" cried the baronet, recovering his self-possession,
after a struggle. "Who are you, mysterious man? At least let me
thank you for my child's life."</p>

<p>"I want no thanks," said Jack; "and as to who I am that I
cannot at present tell, for there are reasons why my identity
should be concealed. Some day, perhaps, I may present myself to
you in proper person."</p>

<p>"But how shall I know that whoever presents himself to me is
really yourself?" asked Sir Charles.</p>

<p>"Give me your signet ring," said Jack; "and rest assured that
whoever hands it back to you will be Spring-Heeled Jack in
person."</p>

<p>The general at once complied, and endeavoured to shake Jack
by the hand, but our hero dexterously contrived to wrench it
away just as he received the ring.</p>

<p>"No, Sir Charles," said he; "I cannot shake you or any honest
man by the hand just now. A time may come&mdash;nay, it shall
come&mdash;when I can do so. Till then, farewell!"</p>

<p>Another instant and Jack had left the room as suddenly as he
had entered it.</p>

<p>We will leave the two guilty women and the baronet together
for the present, and follow Jack.</p>

<p>Taking his cloak from the balcony, where he had placed it,
our hero pulled it closely round him, and, with a spring,
alighted on Mother Earth once more.</p>

<p>Hastening round to the front of the hotel, he ordered some
brandy to be sent to his room, and calling to Ned, who was in
one of the side bars, used as a tap, Jack proceeded to his own
room.</p>

<p>Ned Chump followed immediately afterwards, and our hero soon
put him in possession of the extraordinary event of the last
hour.</p>

<p>"Well, Ned," said he, "I shall commence direct and final
operations at once. I have just about time to reach Dacre Hall a
couple of hours before daylight."</p>

<p>"Dacre Hall!" cried the astounded salt. "Why, does your
honour recollect how far it is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, perfectly," was the reply.</p>

<p>Ned, seeing that his master had made up his mind thoroughly
for the adventure, did not further attempt to dissuade him from
it.</p>

<p>"I have reckoned the distance," then went on Jack, "and I
have ample time to perform all that I intend to do long before
the sun peeps above the horizon. Meanwhile give me a glass of
that brandy which the waiter has just I brought in, and put the
rest in my flask. I shall probably have need of it ere my
return. In case I am not back till late in the day, which might
make my absence noticed, you had better tell the landlord in the
morning that I am slightly indisposed, and you can order my
meals to be brought to my room just as if I really was confined
to my bed."</p>

<p>"But how about your return? How will you get in?"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Jack. "Why, Ned, you have only to leave the
casement of the bedroom wide open, and when I come back surely I
can vault on the sill, and so make my entry without being
seen."</p>

<p>"Well, you are a wonder, skipper, you are a wonder. Talk
about what's his name, Baron&mdash;-Baron&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Munchausen," put in our hero.</p>

<p>"Yes, skipper, that's the name, but I cannot pronounce it.
But talk about he, why, nothing that he wrote about is half so
wonderful as what you have already done, let alone what you are
going to do."</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye for the present, Ned, I must be off now."</p>

<p>And shaking Ned warmly by the hand the sailor said&mdash;</p>

<p>"And may all good luck follow you."</p>

<p>Jack sprang lightly from the casement window, and a quarter
of an hour later was considerably over a mile on his way to
Dacre Hall, so rapid was the pace at which he was
proceeding.</p>

<p>Ned's wondering admiration at his master's powers and good
generalship was in no way misplaced, for even while the
conversation just narrated was taking place Jack had packed the
garments usually worn by Mr. Turnbull into a compact parcel
which he attached by a hook to the lining of his capacious
cloak.</p>

<p>This he had done because he knew that after his mission at
Dacre Hall was performed some hours must elapse before he could
regain his quarters at the Bridge House Hotel, Arundel.</p>

<p>By taking the plain clothes with him he could make everything
safe.</p>

<p>All he had to do was to deposit the bundle in some convenient
nook, and then, when his mission was accomplished, he could
regain possession of the clothes, and, by placing them over his
tight-fitting disguise, and removing his mask and other facial
disfigurements, he could speedily transform himself from
Spring-Heeled Jack into Jack Turnbull.</p>

<p>In the garb of that young gentleman, and with the cloak slung
over his arm, he could go anywhere he pleased during the time
which must elapse ere he could return to his hotel.</p>

<p>About a mile from Dacre Hall he met with the only adventure
which befel him on his midnight journey.</p>

<p>He heard, apparently some little way in front of him, the
sound of a horse's hoofs quietly ambling along the road.</p>

<p>Jack thought to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's a farmer going to Lewes market, I'll be bound. Shall
I give him a fright, or not?"</p>

<p>Our readers must recollect that Jack was young, and blessed
with health and excellent spirits (or he could never have fought
against fate as he did), so they will, undoubtedly, excuse the
temptation which passed through his mind to frighten the
approaching traveller, be he farmer or be he squire.</p>

<p>But ere he had made up his mind whether he should play one of
his practical jokes or not, he heard a loud voice cry&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stand and deliver!"</p>

<p>This was by no means an uncommon cry in those days, but it
was the first time that our hero had had the pleasure of
beholding a real live highwayman, so he pushed rapidly along the
road until a bend in it revealed a strange spectacle.</p>

<p>An apparently well-to-do farmer, on a smart and sleek-looking
cob, was in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>At the side, where a retired lane branched off, stood what
seemed to Jack one of the grandest sights he had ever
beheld.</p>

<p>The sight in question was worthy of the pencil of Frith,
whose picture of Claude Duval, the highwayman, dancing a coranto
with a lady in Hounslow Heath, is doubtless well known to most
of our readers.</p>

<p>One of the grandest thoroughbreds Jack had ever seen stood
motionless at the mouth of the lane, from the ambuscade of which
it had evidently just emerged.</p>

<p>Mounted on the back of this magnificent charger was a man who
might have stood as model for the greatest sculptor the world
ever produced.</p>

<p>His whole form, save his lips, was as motionless as that of
the noble animal he bestrode.</p>

<p>His dress was picturesque in the extreme.</p>

<p>He had eschewed the orthodox scarlet, save that in his
three-cornered hat he wore the bright red feather of a flamingo.</p>

<p>His tunic, however, was of a beautiful blue, relieved here
and there with silver.</p>

<p>His white buckskin breeches, and his well-blacked boots,
rising far above his knees, stood out sharply and well-defined
in the cold glare of the moon.</p>

<p>His right arm was pointed straight at the head of the
unhappy-looking farmer, and that right arm ended in a hand
containing a handsomely mounted pistol.</p>

<p>"Good Mr. Highwayman, spare me! I have but little money about
me, and that I am going to take over to my landlord's agent, who
threatens to turn me out of my farm unless I pay him something
by eight o'clock in the morning, and I have now only just got
time to get to his house by that hour."</p>

<p>"Liar!" thundered the highwayman. "I know you are loaded with
money, for you are off to Lewes market to buy cattle. Hand over
your money, or you are a dead man."</p>

<p>Here was an opportunity for our hero's practical joke, too
good to be resisted.</p>

<p>He grasped the situation in an instant, and ere the
highwayman had time to fire his pistol, or the farmer to produce
his cash, Spring-Heeled Jack, with an awful cry, sprang in the
air clean over the heads of the highwayman and his destined
victim.</p>

<p>It would be utterly impossible to find words to describe
Jack's appearance as he went over the heads of the two
horsemen.</p>

<p>The rapidity of his flight in the air distended the flaps of
his coat, until they resembled a pair of wings.</p>

<p>His peculiar costume, fitting so tightly to his skin, made
him look like a huge bat, with a body of brilliant scarlet.</p>

<p>With a yell of fear from the farmer, and a screech of
unearthly sound from the animal he bestrode, horse and rider
disappeared along the road to Lewes.</p>

<p>The highwayman on the other hand did not stir, and as well
trained was his beautiful steed, that although it trembled with
fear for an instant, it did not attempt to bolt as the farmer's
horse had done.</p>

<p>As Jack touched the ground again the highwayman took aim at
our hero and fired.</p>

<p>The part which he had intended to hit was Jack's forehead,
and had the forehead have been where it was apparently situated,
the bullet must have gone crashing straight through our hero's
skull.</p>

<p>As it was, however, Jack's mask was so constructed as to make
his face look about two inches longer than it really was.</p>

<p>This two inches of added matter formed the supposed cranium
through which the highwayman's bullet had sped.</p>

<p>With another shriek more supernatural than the first Jack
wheeled round, and sprang once more over his adversary's
head.</p>

<p>This was too much even for the highwayman, who up till now
had not known what fear was.</p>

<p>He had watched the track of his bullet clean through the
uncanny-looking being's brain, and felt that it would be
impossible to cope with an enemy possessing such extraordinary
if not unearthly attributes.</p>

<p>Digging his spurs right up to the hilt in his steed's sides,
he lifted the reins, and just as our hero gave a loud mocking
laugh of defiance, and waved his plumed cap in the air, the
highwayman gave his horse a cut, and leaping the hedge at the
roadside, the noble steed and its rider were soon lost to
view.</p>

<p>"Well, that was a lark," said Jack to himself as he rapidly
strode on in the direction of Dacre Hall; "but it was a close
shave, though, for I felt that bullet graze the top of my scalp
in a most decidedly unpleasant manner."</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later, and he was at the lodge-gates of his
ancestral home.</p>

<p>Everything now depended upon his caution, and Jack was
resolved that no fault of his should mar the performance of his
plans.</p>

<p>He knew the room which had been allotted to Morgan when he
first took up his abode at the Hall, but still that room might
have been changed, and it would have been fatal to our hero's
scheme to have made a mistake on that score.</p>

<p>The only thing, therefore, was to rouse up the lodge-keeper,
and find from him in his certain fright the position of the room
occupied by Mr. Alfred Morgan.</p>

<p>The lodge consisted of only two rooms&mdash;one up and one
downstairs.</p>

<p>In the former Jack knew that the lodge-keeper slept.</p>

<p>There was a stone ballustrade outside the window of the
bedroom, and on to this Jack lightly sprang.</p>

<p>To open the casement was an easy task.</p>

<p>This done, Jack cried out, in sepulchral tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"Awake, awake, awake! old man, awake!"</p>

<p>The lodge-keeper woke with a start, but he was not so
frightened as Jack had expected him to be.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter was, Michael Dacre was not at all
popular with the servants, and they had heard with some amount
of delight of the various adventures he and Morgan had had with
Jack.</p>

<p>"Good Mr. Spring-Heeled Jack," cried the lodge-keeper, "what
do you want? If it is anything I can do for you tell me, and
consider it done."</p>

<p>"I merely want to know in which room Mr. Morgan sleeps,"
replied Jack, highly delighted at the turn things had taken.</p>

<p>"In the blue room, sir," answered the lodge-keeper.</p>

<p>"Can I trust you not to raise an alarm for an hour or so? I
have important business with Mr. Alfred Morgan, but shall not
trouble your master."</p>

<p>"Aye, Mr. Spring-Heeled Jack, that you can," he said; "and if
you can only frighten him out of this place you will earn the
thanks of the whole household."</p>

<p>The man's tone was so self-evidently sincere that Jack, with
a farewell warning, sprang to the ground, and hastened towards
the window of the blue room.</p>

<p>To his surprise and momentary annoyance, he found that there
was no vestige of a sill to the window.</p>

<p>The diamond-paned leaden casement was flush with the outer
wall.</p>

<p>After a brief consideration, Jack made up his mind.</p>

<p>"I'll risk it," he said. "I have been successful so far, and
surely I shall not fail now."</p>

<p>In another instant he had sprang harlequin-like clean through
the window, carrying before him glass, frame, and all.</p>

<p>As he dashed like a stone from a catapult into the room his
head struck against a human form, and when our hero had
recovered his lost balance he discovered in the full light of
the moon Morgan lying prone on the floor.</p>

<p>"Rise, and give me all the papers you have, or stay&mdash;you
can lay where you are. I can see your valise there, and there, I
know, you carry your private journal, and so on. I'll take it,
and save you the trouble of rising. Lay where you are, and don't
attempt to leave this house for three hours, or fear the
hangman, for yours is a hanging offence."</p>

<p>Without another word Jack flung the valise out of the window,
and speedily followed it himself.</p>

<p>As Jack left the room Morgan rose from the floor, and,
trembling with fear, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fear the hangman! Fear the hangman, indeed! I fear nothing
but this cursed Spring-Heeled Jack, who seems to haunt every
moment of my life. I'll end it at once."</p>

<p>And end it he did, for half-an-hour later the dead body of
Alfred Morgan was swinging from a hook in a rafter above his
bed.</p>

<p>He had cheated the hangman, but he had hanged himself.</p>

<p>Jack did not reach the Bridge House until late the next
night, when all was quiet in the hotel.</p>

<p>He had no difficulty in effecting an entrance into the
bedroom, but he found he could not carry the valise up with him,
so he secreted it in an outhouse.</p>

<p>He rapidly made Ned acquainted with the events which had
occurred, and wound up by saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"And I really believe that the valise contains the proofs of
my cousin's and his accomplice's villainy."</p>

<p>And so it proved in the morning, when Ned, who had risen very
early, had contrived to smuggle the bag in unseen.</p>

<p>There lay every link in the chain of fraud, including a paper
signed by the baronet and witnessed by two of the hall servants,
stating that he was well aware that Jack was legitimate and the
rightful heir to the Dacre baronetcy and estates.</p>

<p>"I must see Sir Charles Grahame about this," said Jack.</p>

<p>"He has enquired for you several times during your absence,
Sir John," replied the faithful fellow.</p>

<p>A glow of pride passed over Jack's face as he stretched forth
his hand to Ned.</p>

<p>"Thanks, old fellow; it is only fitting that you, who have
stuck to me in adversity, should be the first to congratulate me
in my prosperity. Go and ask the general if he can favour me
with an interview."</p>

<p>Ned immediately obeyed, and a quarter of an hour later our
hero was closeted with Sir Charles Grahame. Little more remains
to be told.</p>

<p>The general was delighted when he found that the man who had
twice saved his daughter's life, first in the guise of Jack
Turnbull, and secondly in that of Spring-Heeled Jack, should
turn out to be no less a personage than Sir John Dacre, of Dacre
Hall, Surrey.</p>

<p>In answer to an inquiry made by Jack, Sir Charles informed
our hero that Lady Graham had consented, to avoid scandal, to
become the inmate of a private lunatic asylum for not less than
two years; if she behaved herself during that time Sir Charles
intended to take steps for her liberation, and to provide her
with an income which would enable her to live in comparative
obscurity abroad.</p>

<p>Jack and the general ordered a chaise, and started at once
for Dacre Hall, armed with Mr. Morgan's documents.</p>

<p>The task before them was an easier one than they had
anticipated.</p>

<p>Michael Dacre had been so shocked by the suicide of Morgan
that he at once caved in, and agreed to quit the country, Jack,
of course, having no wish to prosecute any one of his own kith
and kin, no matter how treacherous his conduct might have
been.</p>

<p>In due course, as our readers must have guessed, Jack and
Lucy were married.</p>

<p>Ned was appointed to a post of trust at the hall, and as
children grew up around them few mortals enjoyed so much earthly
happiness as the family and household of Sir John Dacre.</p>

<p>Our story is ended.</p>

<p>After Jack's resumption of his title many scamps and ruffians
played the part of Spring-Heeled Jack in various garbs in and
around London, but the story which we have told of brave Jack
Dacre is the only authentic history of <span class="smcap">
Spring-Heeled Jack</span>.</p>
