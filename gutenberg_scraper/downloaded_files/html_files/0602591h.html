<h1>The Mystery of the Semi-Detached</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Edith Nesbit</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>He was waiting for her, he had been waiting an hour and a half in a
dusty suburban lane, with a row of big elms on one side and some
eligible building sites on the other-and far away to the south-west the
twinkling yellow lights of the Crystal Palace. It was not quite like a
country lane, for it had a pavement and lamp-posts, but it was not a
bad place for a meeting all the same: and farther up, towards the
cemetery, it was really quite rural, and almost pretty, especially in
twilight But twilight had long deepened into the night, and still he
waited. He loved her, and he was engaged to be married to her, with the
complete disapproval of every reasonable person who had been consulted.
And this half-clandestine meeting was tonight to take the place of the
grudgingly sanctioned weekly interview-because a certain rich uncle was
visiting at her house, and her mother was not the woman to acknowledge
to a moneyed uncle, who might "go off" any day, a match so deeply
ineligible as hers with him.</p>

<p>So he waited for her, and the chill of an unusually severe May
evening entered into his bones.</p>

<p>The policeman passed him with a surly response to his "Good night".
The bicyclists went by him like grey ghosts with foghorns; and it was
nearly ten o'clock, and she had not come.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and turned towards his lodgings. His road
led him by her house--desirable, commodious, semi-detached-and he
walked slowly as he neared it She might, even now, be coming out But
she was not There was no sign of movement about the house, no sign of
life, no lights even in the windows. And her people were not early
people.</p>

<p>He paused by the gate, wondering.</p>

<p>Then he noticed that the front door was open-wide open-and the
street lamp shone a little way into the dark hail. There was something
about all this that did not please him-that scared him a little,
indeed. The house had a gloomy and deserted air. It was obviously
impossible that it harboured a rich uncle. The old man must have left
early. In which case-</p>

<p>He walked up the path of patent glazed dies, and listened. No sign
of life. He passed into the hail. There was no light anywhere. Where
was everybody, and why was the front door open? There was no one in the
drawing room, the dining room and the study (nine feet by seven) were
equally blank. Everyone was out, evidently. But the unpleasant sense
that he was, perhaps, not the first casual visitor to walk through that
open door impelled him to look through the house before he went away
and closed it after him. So he went upstairs, and at the door of the
first bedroom he came to he struck a wax match, as he had done in the
sitting rooms. Even as he did so he felt that he was not alone. And he
was prepared to see something but for what he saw he was not prepared.
For what he saw lay on the bed, in a white loose gown-and it was his
sweetheart, and its throat was cut from ear to ear. He doesn't know
what happened then, nor how he got downstairs and into the street; but
he got out somehow, and the policeman found him in a fit, under the
lamp-post at the corner of the street He couldn't speak when they
picked him up, and he passed the night in the police cells, because the
policeman had seen plenty of drunken men before, but never one in a
fit.</p>

<p>The next morning he was better, though still very white and shaky.
But the tale he told the magistrate was convincing, and they sent a
couple of constables with him to her house.</p>

<p>There was no crowd about it as he had fancied there would be, and
the blinds were not down.</p>

<p>He held on to the door-post for support...</p>

<p>"She's all right, you see," said the constable, who had found him
under the lamp. "I told you you was drunk, but you would know
best-"</p>

<p>When he was alone with her he told her-not all-for that would not
bear telling-but how he had come into the commodious semi-detached, and
how he had found the door open and the lights out, and that he had been
into that long back room facing the stairs, and had seen something-in
even trying to hint at which he turned sick and broke down and had to
have brandy given him.</p>

<p>"But, my dearest," she said, "I dare say the house was dark, for we
were all at the Crystal Palace with my uncle, and no doubt the door was
open, for the maids will run out if they're left. But you could not
have been in that room, because I locked it when I came away, and the
key was in my pocket. I dressed in a hurry and I left all my odds and
ends lying about."</p>

<p>"I know," he said; "I saw a green scarf on a chair, and some long
brown gloves, and a lot of hairpins and ribbons, and a prayerbook, and
a lace handkerchief on the dressing table. Why, I even noticed the
almanack on the mantelpiece-21 October. At least it couldn't be that,
because this is May. And yet it was. Your almanack is at 21 October,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No, of course it isn't," she said, smiling rather anxiously; "but
all the other things were just as you say. You must have had a dream,
or a vision, or something."</p>

<p>He was a very ordinary, commonplace, City young man, and he didn't
believe in visions, but he never rested day or night till he got his
sweetheart and her mother away from that commodious semi-detached, and
settled them in a quiet distant suburb. In the course of the removal he
incidentally married her, and the mother went on living with them.</p>

<p>His nerves must have been a good bit shaken, because he was very
queer for a long time, and was always enquiring if anyone had taken the
desirable semi-detached; and when an old stockbroker with a family took
it, he went the length of calling on the old gentleman and imploring
him by all that he held dear, not to live in that fatal house.</p>

<p>"Why?" said the stockbroker, not unnaturally.</p>

<p>And then he got so vague and confused, between trying to tell why
and trying not to tell why, that the stockbroker showed him out, and
thanked his God he was not such a fool as to allow a lunatic to stand
in the way of his taking that really remarkably cheap and desirable
semi-detached residence.</p>

<p>Now the curious and quite inexplicable part of this story is that
when she came down to breakfast on the morning of the 22 October she
found him looking like death, with the morning paper in his hand. He
caught hers--he couldn't speak, and pointed to the paper. And there she
read that on the night of the 21st a young lady, the stockbroker's
daughter, had been found, with her throat cut from ear to ear, on the
bed in the long back bedroom facing the stairs of that desirable
semi-detached.</p>
