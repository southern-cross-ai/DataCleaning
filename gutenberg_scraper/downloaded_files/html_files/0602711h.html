<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>ONE &mdash; "FIE, SIR PERCY!"</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>"You really are impossible, Sir Percy! Here are we ladies
raving, simply raving, about this latest exploit of the gallant
Scarlet Pimpernel, and you do naught but belittle his prowess. Lady
Blakeney, I entreat, will you not add your voice to our chorus of
praise, and drown Sir Percy's scoffing in an ocean of eulogy?"</p>

<p>Lady Alicia Nugget was very arch. She tapped Sir Percy's arm
with her fan. She put up a jewelled finger and shook it at him with
a great air of severity in her fine dark eyes. She turned an
entreating glance on Marguerite Blakeney, and as that lady appeared
engrossed in conversation with His Grace of Flint, Lady Alicia
turned the battery of her glances on His Royal Highness.</p>

<p>"Your Highness," she said appealingly.</p>

<p>The Prince laughed good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said, "do not ask me to inculcate hero-worship into
this <i>mauvis sujet</i>. If you ladies cannot convert him to your
views, how can I...a mere man...?"</p>

<p>And His Highness shrugged his shoulders. There were few
entertainments he enjoyed more than seeing his friend Sir Percy
Blakeney badgered by the ladies on the subject of their popular and
mysterious hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>"Your Highness," Lady Alicia retorted with the pertness of a
spoilt child of Society. "Your Highness can command Sir Percy to
give us a true&mdash;a true&mdash;account of how that wonderful
Scarlet Pimpernel snatched Monsieur le Comte de Tournon-d'Agenay
with Madame la Comtesse and their three children out of the
clutches of those abominable murderers in Paris, and drove them
triumphantly to Boulogne, where they embarked on board an English
ship and were ultimately safely landed in Dover. Sir Percy vows
that he knows all the facts..."</p>

<p>"And so I do, dear lady," Sir Percy now put in, with just a
soupçon of impatience in his pleasant voice, "but, as I've already
had the privilege to tell you, the facts are hardly worth
retailing."</p>

<p>"The facts, Sir Percy," commanded the imperious beauty, "or
we'll all think you are jealous."</p>

<p>"As usual you would be right, dear lady," Sir Percy rejoined
blandly; "are not ladies always right in their estimate of us poor
men? I <i>am</i> jealous of that demmed, elusive personage who
monopolizes the thoughts and the conversation of these galaxies of
beauty who would otherwise devote themselves exclusively to us.
What says Your Highness? Will you deign to ban for this one night
at least every reference to that begad shadow?"</p>

<p>"Not till we've had the facts," Lady Alicia protested.</p>

<p>"The facts! The facts!" the ladies cried in an insistent
chorus.</p>

<p>"You'll have to do it, Blakeney," His Highness declared.</p>

<p>"Unless Sir Andrew Ffoulkes would oblige us with the tale,"
Marguerite Blakeney said, turning suddenly from His Grace of Flint,
in order to give her lord an enigmatic smile, "he too knows the
facts, I believe, and is an excellent raconteur."</p>

<p>"God forbid!" Sir Percy Blakeney exclaimed, with mock concern.
"Once you start Ffoulkes on one of his interminable
stories...Moreover," he added seriously, "Ffoulkes always get the
facts wrong. He would tell you, for instance, that the demmed
Pimpernel rescued those unfortunate Tournon-d'Agenays
single-handed; now I happen to know for a fact that three of the
bravest English gentlemen the world has ever known did all the work
whilst he merely..."</p>

<p>"Well?" Lady Alicia queried eagerly. "What did that noble and
gallant Scarlet Pimpernel merely do?"</p>

<p>"He merely climbed to the box-seat of the chaise which was
conveying the Comte de Tournon-d'Agenay and his family under escort
to Paris. And the chaise had been held up by three of the
bravest..."</p>

<p>"Never mind about three of the bravest English gentlemen at the
moment," Lady Alicia broke in impatiently, "you shall sing their
praises to us anon. But if you do not tell us the whole story at
once, we'll call on Sir Andrew Ffoulkes without further hesitation.
Your Highness...!" she pleaded once more.</p>

<p>"My fair one," His Highness rejoined with a laugh, "I think that
we shall probably get a truer account of this latest prowess of the
Scarlet Pimpernel from Sir Andrew Ffoulkes. It was a happy thought
of Lady Blakeney's," he added with a knowing smile directed at
Marguerite, "and I for one do command our friend Ffoulkes forthwith
to satisfy our curiosity."</p>

<p>In vain did Sir Percy protest. In vain did he cast surreptitious
yet reproachful glances at his royal friend and at his beautiful
wife. His Highness had commanded and the ladies, curious and eager,
were like beautiful peacocks, spreading out their multi-coloured
silks and satins, so as to look their best whilst Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes, an avowed admirer of the Scarlet Pimpernel, was being
hunted for through the crowded reception-rooms, so that he might
comply with His Highness's commands.</p>

<p>The latest prowess of the Scarlet Pimpernel! The magic words
flitted on the perfume-laden atmosphere from room to room, and
ladies broke off their flirtations, men forsook the gaming tables,
for it was murmured that young Ffoulkes had first-hand information
as to how the popular English hero had snatched M. le Comte de
Tournon-d'Agenay and all his family out of the clutches of those
murdering revolutionaries over in Paris.</p>

<p>In a moment Sir Andrew Ffoulkes found himself the centre of
attraction. His Royal Highness bade him sit beside him on the sofa,
and all around him silks were rustling, fans were waving, whilst
half a hundred pairs of bright eyes were fixed eagerly upon him.
Sir Andrew caught a glance from Marguerite Blakeney's luminous
eyes, and a smile of encouragement from her perfect lips. He was
indeed in his element; a worshipper of his beloved chief, he was
called upon to sing the praises of the man whom he admired and
loved best in all the world. Had the bevy of beauties around him
known that he was recounting his own prowess as well as that of his
leader and friend, they could not have hung more eagerly on his
lips.</p>

<p>In the hubbub attendant on settling down, so as to hear Sir
Andrew's narrative, even the popular Sir Percy Blakeney was
momentarily forgotten. The idol of London Society, he nevertheless
had to be set aside for the moment in favour of the mysterious hero
who, as elusive as a shadow, was still the chief topic of
conversation in the <i>salons</i> of two continents.</p>

<p>The ladies would have it that Sir Percy was jealous of the
popularity of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Certain it is that as soon as
Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had started to obey His Highness's commands by
embarking on his narrative, Sir Percy retired to the sheltered
alcove at the further end of the room and stretched out his long
limbs upon a downy sofa, and promptly went to sleep.</p>

<p>"Is it a fact, my dear Ffoulkes," His Highness had asked, "that
the gallant Scarlet Pimpernel and his lieutenants actually held up
the chaise in which the Comte de Tournon-d'Agenay and his family
were being conveyed to Paris?"</p>

<p>"An absolute fact, Your Highness," Sir Andrew Ffoulkes replied,
while a long drawn-out "Ah!" of excitement went the round of the
brilliant company. "I have the story from Madame la Comtesse
herself. The Scarlet Pimpernel, in the company of three of his
followers, all of them disguised as footpads, did at the
pistol-point hold up the chaise which was conveying the prisoners
from their château of Agenay, where they had been summarily
arrested, to Paris. It occurred on the very crest of that steep bit
of road which intersects the forest between Mèziéres and Epone. The
church clock at Mantes had struck seven when the chaise had rattled
over the cobblestones of that city, so it must have been past eight
o'clock when the attack was made. Inside the vehicle M. de
Tournon-d'Agenay with his wife, his young son and two daughters,
sat huddled up, half-numbed with terror. They had no idea who had
denounced them, and on what charge they had been arrested, but they
knew well enough what fate awaited them in Paris. The revolutionary
wolves are fairly on the war-path just now. Robespierre and his
satellites feel that their power is on the wane. They are hitting
out to right and left, preaching the theory that moderation and
human kindness are but the sign of weakness and want of patriotism.
To prove their love for France, lovely France, whose white robes
are stained with the blood of her innocent children, and to show
their zeal in her cause, they commit the most dastardly
crimes."</p>

<p>"And those poor Tournon-d'Agenays?" one of the ladies asked with
a sympathetic sigh.</p>

<p>"Madame la Comtesse assured me," Sir Andrew replied, "that her
husband, and in fact all the family, had kept clear of politics
during these, the worst times of the revolution. Though all of them
are devoted royalists, they kept all show of loyalty hidden in
their hearts. Only one thing had they forgotten to do and that was
to take down from the wall in Madame's boudoir a small miniature of
their unfortunate Queen."</p>

<p>"And for this they were arrested?"</p>

<p>"They were innocent of everything else. In the early dawn after
their summary arrest they were dragged out of their home and were
being conveyed for trial to Paris, where their chances of coming
out alive were about equal to those of a rabbit when chased by a
terrier."</p>

<p>"And that was when the gallant Scarlet Pimpernel interposed?"
Lady Alicia put in with a sigh. "He knew M. le Tournon-d'Agenay and
his family were being taken to Paris."</p>

<p>"I believe he had had an inkling of what was in the wind some
time before the arrest. It is wonderful how closely he is always in
touch with those who one day may need his help. But I believe that
at the last moment plans had to be formulated in a hurry.
Fortunately, chance on this occasion chose to favour those plans.
Day had broken without a gleam of sunshine; a thin drizzle was
falling, and there was a sharp head wind on, which fretted the
horses and forced the driver to keep his head down, with his
broad-brimmed hat pulled well over his eyes. Nature, as you see,
was helping all she could. The whole thing would undoubtedly have
been more difficult had the morning been clear and fine. As it was,
one can imagine the surprise attack. Vague forms looming suddenly
out of the mist, and the sharp report of a pistol, twice in quick
succession. The horses, who, sweating and panting, had fallen into
a foot-pace, dragging the heavy coach up the steep incline, through
the squelching mud of the road, came to a violent and sudden halt
on the very crest of the hill at the first report. At the second
they reared and plunged wildly. The shouts of the officer in charge
of the escort did, as a matter of fact, so I understand, add to the
confusion. The whole thing was, I am assured, a matter of a couple
of minutes. It was surprise and swiftness that won the upper hand,
for the rescue party was outnumbered three to one. Had there been
the slightest hesitation, the slightest slackening of quick action,
the attack would of a certainty have failed. But during those few
minutes of confusion, and under cover of the mist and the vague
greyness of the morning, the Scarlet Pimpernel and his followers,
down on their knees in the squelching mud, were not merely
fighting, you understand? No! They were chiefly engaged in cutting
the saddle girths under the bellies of eight fidgety and plunging
horses, and cracking their pistols in order to keep up the
confusion. Not an easy task, you will admit, though 'tis a form of
attack well-known in the East, so I understand. At any rate, those
had been the chief's orders, and they had to be carried out. For my
part, I imagine that superstitious terror had upset the nerves of
that small squad of Revolutionary guard. Hemmed in by the thicket
on either side of the road, the men had not sufficient elbow-room
for a good fight. No man likes being attacked by a foe whom he
cannot well see, and in the melee that ensued the men were hindered
from using their somewhat clumsy sabres too freely for fear of
injuring their comrades' mounts, if not their own; and all they
could do was to strive to calm their horses and, through the din,
to hear the words of command uttered by their lieutenant.</p>

<p>"And all the while," Sir Andrew went on, amidst breathless
silence on the part of his hearers, "I pray you picture to
yourselves the confusion; the cracking of pistols, the horses
snorting, the lieutenant shouting, the prisoners screaming. Then,
at a given moment, the Scarlet Pimpernel scrambled up the box-seat
of the chaise. As no doubt all of you ladies know by now, he was
the most wonderful hand with horses. In one instant he had snatched
the reins out of the bewildered Jehu's hands, and with word of
mouth and click of tongue had soothed the poor beasts' nerves. And
suddenly he gave the order: '<i>Ca va!</i>' which was the signal
agreed on between himself and his followers. For them it meant a
scramble for cover under the veil of mist and rain, whilst he, the
gallant chief, whipped up the team which plunged down the road now
at break-neck speed."</p>

<p>"Of course, the guard, and above all the lieutenant, grasped the
situation soon enough, and immediately gave chase. But they were
not trick-riders any of them, and with severed saddle-girths could
not go far. Be that as it may, the Scarlet Pimpernel drove his team
without a halt as far as Molay, where he had arranged for relays.
Once well away from the immediate influence of Paris, with all its
terrors and tyrannical measures, the means of escape for the
prisoners became comparatively easy, thanks primarily to the
indomitable pluck of their rescuer and also to a long purse. And
that, ladies and noble lords," Sir Andrew concluded, "is all I can
tell you of the latest exploit of our hero. The story is exactly as
I had it from Madame la Comtesse de Tournon-d'Agenay, whose only
sorrow, now that she and those she loves are safe at last in
England, is that she never once caught a glimpse of her rescuer. He
proved as elusive to her as to all of us, and we find ourselves
repeating the delightful doggerel invented on that evasive
personage by our prince of dandies, Sir Percy Blakeney."</p>

<p>"Marvellous!" "Enchanting!" "Palpitating!" "I nearly fainted
with excitement, my dear!" These were some of the ejaculations
uttered by dainty, well-rouged lips while the men, more or less,
were silent, pondering, vaguely longing to shake the enigmatical
hero once at least by the hand.</p>

<p>His Highness was questioning Sir Andrew Ffoulkes more closely
about certain details connected with the story. It was softly
whispered, and not for the first time either, that His Highness
could, and he would, solve the riddle of the identity of that
mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>Dainty, sweet, and gracious as usual, Lady Ffoulkes, née Suzanne
de Tournay, had edged up to Lady Blakeney, and the two young wives
of such gallant men held one another for one instant closely by the
hand, a token of mutual understanding, of pride and of
happiness.</p>

<p>One of two of the ladies were trying to recall the exact words
of the famous doggerel, which, it was averred, had on more than one
occasion given those revolutionary wolves over in Paris a wholesome
scare:</p>

<p class="poem">"We seek him here.<br>
We seek him there!"</p>

<p>"How does it go, my dear?" Lady Alicia sighed. "I vow I have
forgotten."</p>

<p>Then she looked in dainty puzzlement about her. "Sir Percy!" she
exclaimed. "Where is the immortal author of the deathless
rhyme?"</p>

<p>"Sir Percy! Where is Sir Percy?"</p>

<p>And the call was like the chirruping of birds on a sunny spring
morning. It stilled all further chattering for the moment.</p>

<p>"Where is Sir Percy?" And silence alone echoed, "Where?"</p>

<p>Until a real material sound came in response. A long drawn-out
sound that caused the ladies to snigger and the men to laugh. It
was the sound of a loud and prolonged snore. The groups of gay
Society butterflies, men and women, parted disclosing the alcove at
the further end of the room, where on the sofa, with handsome head
resting against rose-coloured cushion, Sir Percy Blakeney was fast
asleep.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>But in Paris the news of the invasion of the <i>ci-devant</i>
Comte et Comtesse de Tournon-d'Agenay with their son and two
daughters was received in a very different spirit. Members of the
Committees of Public Safety and of General Security, both official
and unofficial, professional and amateur, were more irate than they
cared to admit. Everyone was blaming everyone else, and the
unfortunate lieutenant who had been in command of the escort was
already on his way to Toulon, carrying orders to young Captain
Bonaparte to put him in the thickest of the fight, so that he
might, by especial bravery, redeem his tarnished honour.</p>

<p>Citoyen Lauzet, Chief of Section in the rural division of the
department Seine et Oise, was most particularly worried by the
incident which, it must be remembered, occurred in his district.
The hand of the well-known English spy, known throughout France as
the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, could obviously be traced in
the daring and impudent attack on an armed escort, and the
subsequent driving of the chaise through three hundred kilometres
of country where only shameless bribery and unparalleled audacity
could have saved them from being traced, followed, and brought to
justice. Citoyen Lauzet, a faithful servant of the State, felt that
the situation was altogether beyond his capacity for dealing with;
those English spies were so different to the ordinary traitors and
<i>aristos</i> whom one suspected, arrested and sent to the
guillotine all in the turn of a hand. But how was one to deal with
men whom one had never seen and was never likely to see, if rumour
spoke correctly? Citoyen Lauzet scratched his bald pate and
perspired freely in his endeavour to find a solution to his
difficulty, but he found none.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of his perturbations that he bethought him
of his friend Armand Chauvelin. Now Lauzet was quite aware of the
fact that that same friend of his was under a cloud just now; that
he had lost that high position he once held on the Committee of
Public Safety, for reasons which had never been made public.
Nevertheless, Lauzet had reasons for knowing that in the matter of
tracking down spies Armand Chauvelin had few, if any, equals; and
he also knew that for some unexplained cause Chauvelin would give
several years of his life, and everything he possessed in the
world, to get his long, thin fingers round the throat of that
enigmatical personage known as the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>And so in his difficulty, Citoyen Lauzet sent an urgent message
to his friend Chauvelin to come at once to Mantes if
possible&mdash;a request which delighted Chauvelin with which he
forthwith complied. And thus, three days after the sensational
rescue of the Tournon-d'Agenay family, those two men&mdash;Lauzet
and Chauvelin&mdash;both intent on the capture of one of the most
bitter enemies of the revolutionary government of France, were
sitting together in the office of the rural commissariat at Mantes.
Lauzet had very quickly put his friend in possession of the facts
connected with the impudent escapade, and Chauvelin, over an
excellent glass of Fine, had put his undoubted gifts and subtle
brain at the service of the official.</p>

<p>"Now listen to me, my dear Lauzet," he said after a prolonged
silence, during which the Chief of Section had been able to trace
on his friend's face the inner workings of a master-mind
concentrated on one all-engrossing object. "Listen to me. I need
not tell you, I think, that I have had some experience of that
audacious Scarlet Pimpernel and his gang; popular rumour will have
told you that. It will also have told you, no doubt, that in all my
endeavours for the capture of that detestable spy, I was invariably
foiled by persistent ill-luck on the one side, and the man's
boundless impudence on the other. It is because I did fail to lay
the audacious rascal by the heels that you see me now, a disgraced
and disappointed man, after half a lifetime devoted to the service
of my country. But, in the lexicon of our glorious revolution, my
good Lauzet, there is no such word as fail; and many there are who
deem me lucky because my head still happens to be on my shoulders,
after certain episodes at Calais, Boulogne, or Paris of which you
have, I doubt not, heard more than one garbled version."</p>

<p>Lauzet nodded his bald head in sympathy. He also passed a moist,
hot finger around the turn of his cravat. This allusion to failure
in connection with the desired capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel had
started an unpleasant train of thought.</p>

<p>"I've only told you all this, my good Lauzet," Chauvelin went
on, with a sarcastic curl of his thin lips, "in order to make you
realize the value which, in spite of my avowed failures, the
Committee of Public Safety still set upon my advice. They have
disgraced me, it is true, but only outwardly. And this they have
only done in order to leave me a wider scope for my activities,
particularly in connection with the tracking down of spies. As an
actual member of the Committee I was obviously an important
personage whose every movement was in the public eye; now, as an
outwardly obscure agent, I come and go in secret. I can lay plans.
I can help and I can advise without arousing attention. Above all,
I can remain the guiding head prepared to use such patriots as you
are yourself, in the great cause which we all have at heart, the
bringing to justice of a band of English spies, together with their
elusive chief, the Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>

<p>"Well spoken, friend Chauvelin," Citoyen Lauzet rejoined, with a
tone of perplexity in his husky voice, "and, believe me, it was
because I had a true inkling of what you've just said that, in my
anxiety, I begged you to come and give me the benefit of your
experience. Now tell me," he went on eagerly, "how do you advise me
to proceed?"</p>

<p>Chauvelin, before he replied to this direct question, had
another drink of Fine. Then he smacked his lips, set down his
glass, and finally said with slow deliberation:</p>

<p>"To begin with, my good Lauzet, try and bethink yourself of some
family in your district whose position, shall we say, approaches
most nearly to that of the ci-devant Tournon-d'Agenays before their
arrest. That is to say, what you want is a family who at one time
professed loyalty to tyrants and who keeps up some kind of
cult&mdash;however inoffensive&mdash;for the Bourbon dynasty. That
family should consist of at least one women or, better still, one
or two young children, or even an old man or an imbecile. Anything,
in fact, to arouse specially that old-fashioned weakness which, for
want of a better word, we will call sympathy. Now can you think of
a family of that kind living anywhere in your district?"</p>

<p>Lauzet pondered for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"I don't for the moment," he said slowly, "but when I look
through the files I dare say I might..."</p>

<p>"You must," Chauvelin broke in decisively. "That kind of brood
swarms in every district. All you have to do is to open your eyes.
Anyway, having settled on a family, which will become our tool for
the object we have in view, you will order a summary perquisition
to be made by your <i>gendarmerie</i> in their house. You will
cause the head of the family to be brought before you and you will
interrogate him first, and detain him under suspicion. A second
perquisition will then not come amiss; in fact you will have it
bruited all over the neighbourhood that this particular family has
been denounced as 'suspect' and that their arrest and subsequent
trial in Paris, on a charge of treason, is only a matter of days.
You understand?"</p>

<p>"I do," Lauzet replied, in a tone that sounded decidedly
perplexed and unconvinced. "But..."</p>

<p>"There is no but about it," Chauvelin retorted brusquely. "You
have asked my help and I give you my orders. All you have to do is
to obey and not to argue. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Quite, quite clear, my good friend," Lauzet hastened to assure
him. "In fact, I already have someone in my mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which is all to the good," Chauvelin broke in curtly. "On the
balance of your zeal your reward will presently be weighed. Now
listen further to me. Having followed my instructions as to
perquisitions and so on, you will arrange as sensational an arrest
of your family as you can. The more it is talked about in the
neighbourhood the better for our purpose. You understand?"</p>

<p>"I do, I do," Lauzet said eagerly. "I see your whole scheme now.
You want to induce the English spies to exert themselves on behalf
of this family, so that..."</p>

<p>"Exactly! Therefore the more sympathy you can evoke for them the
better; a pretty girl, an invalid, a cripple; anything like that
will arouse the so-called chivalry of those spies. Then, having
effected your arrest, you arrange to convey the family to Paris,
and do so, apparently under rather feeble escort, say not more than
four men. You will choose for your purpose the early dawn of a day
when a thick mist lies over the land, or when a driving rain or
tearing wind makes observation difficult."</p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p>"Not more than four men, remember," Chauvelin reiterated with
slow emphasis, "as <i>visible</i> escort."</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"Instead of the usual chaise for conveying your prisoners to
Paris, you will use the local diligence and, having disposed of the
prisoners inside the vehicle, you will have it further packed with
half a dozen or more picked men from your local <i>gendarmerie</i>,
armed with pistols; and you will take a leaf out of the Scarlet
Pimpernel's own book, because that half-dozen picked men will be
disguised as other <i>aristos</i> in distress, women, cripples, old
men or what you will. You can then go even further in your
trickery, and arrange a break-down for your diligence in the
loneliest bit of road in the forest of Mezieres, and choose the
twilight for your <i>mise-en-scene</i>. Then..."</p>

<p>But Lauzet could no longer restrain his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Oh, then! I see it all!" he exclaimed eagerly. "The band of
English spies will have been on the watch for the diligence. They
will attack it, thinking that it is but feebly gaurded. But this
time we shall be ready for them and..."</p>

<p>But suddenly his enthusiasm failed. His round, fat face lost its
glow of excitement, and his small, round eyes stared in comic
perplexity at his friend.</p>

<p>"But suppose," he murmured, "they think better of it, and allow
the diligence to proceed in peace. Or suppose that they are engaged
in the nefarious deeds in some other department of France."</p>

<p>"Then," Chauvelin rejoined coolly, "all you'd have to do would
be to continue your journey to Paris and set your family down in
the Conciergerie, ready to await trial and the inevitable
guillotine. No harm will have been done. There'll be a family of
traitors less in your district, anyway, and you must begin the
setting of your comedy all over again. Sooner or later, if you set
your trap in the way I have outlined for you, that cursed Scarlet
Pimpernel will fall into it. Sooner or later," he reiterated
emphatically, "I am sure of it. My only regret is that I didn't
think of this plan before now. It has been vaguely moving in my
mind, ever since I heard of the escape of the Tournon-d'Agenays,
and I wish to Heaven I had matured it then and there; we could have
got that Scarlet Pimpernel as easily as possible. However, there's
nothing lost, and all I can do now, my friend, is to wish you
success. If you succeed you are a made man. And you will succeed,"
Chauvelin concluded, rising and holding out his hand to his
colleague, "if you follow my instructions to the last letter."</p>

<p>"You may be sure I'll do that," Lauzet said with earnest
emphasis.</p>

<p>And the two sleuth-hounds shook hands on their project, and
drank a glass of Fine to its success. But before Chauvelin finally
took leave of his friend, he turned to him with renewed earnestess
and solemnity.</p>

<p>"And above all, my good Lauzet," he said slowly, "remember that
in all this your watchword must be: 'Silence and discretion'.
Breathe but a word of your intentions to a living soul, and you are
bound to fail. The English spies have their spies who serve them
well. They have a long purse which will alternatively purchase help
from their friends and treachery from ours. Breathe not of your
project to any living soul, friend Lauzet, of your head will pay
the price for your indiscretion."</p>

<p>Lauzet was only too ready to give the required promise, and the
two friends then parted on a note of mutual confidence and
esteem.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>A fortnight later the whole of the little city of Moisson was in
a ferment owing to the arrest of one of its most respected
tradesmen. Citizen Deseze who, anyone would have thought, was
absolutely above suspicion, had been put to the indignity of a
summary perquisition in his house. He had protested&mdash;as was
only natural under the circumstances&mdash;and in consequence of
this very moderate protest he had been dragged before the Chief of
Section at Mantes and had had to submit to a most rigorous and most
humiliating interrogatory. Nay more! He was detained for two whole
days, while his invalid wife and pretty little daughter were
wellnigh distraught with anxiety.</p>

<p>Then on the top of that, there followed another perquisition:
just as if anyone could suspect the Deseze family of treason
against their country. They certainly had never been very hotly in
favour of the extreme measures taken by the revolutionary
government&mdash;such as the execution of the erstwhile King and of
Marie-Antoinette, ci-devant Queen of France&mdash;but Citizen
Deseze had always abstained from politics. He had been wont to say
that God, not man, ruled the destinies of countries, and that no
doubt what was happening these days in France occurred by the will
of God, or they could never occur at all. He for his part was
content to sell good vintage wines from Macon or Nuits, just as his
father had done before him, and his grandfather before that, for
the house of Deseze, wine merchants of Moisson in the department of
Seine et Oise, had been established for three generations and more,
and had always been a pattern of commercial integrity and lofty
patriotism.</p>

<p>And now these perquisitions! these detentions! and finally the
arrest, not only of good Citizen Deseze himself, but of his invalid
wife and pretty little daughter. If one dared, one would protest,
call a meeting, anything. It was almost unbelievable, so unexpected
was it. What had the Deseze family done? No one knew. Inquiries at
the commissariat of the section elicited no information. There were
vague rumours that the poor invalid citizeness had always remained
very pious. She had been taught piety by her parents, no doubt, and
had been brought up in a convent school besides. But what would
you? Piety was reckoned a sin these days, and who would dare
protest?</p>

<p>The servants at the substantial house inhabited by the Deseze
family were speechless with tears. The perquisitions, and then the
arrest, had come as a thunderbolt. And now they were all under
orders to quit the house, for it would be shut and ultimately sold
for the benefit of the State. Oh, these were terrible times! The
same tragedy had occurred not far away from Moisson in the case of
the Tournon-d'Agenays, whom no one was allowed to call Comte and
Comtesse these days. They too had been summarily arrested, and were
being dragged to Paris for their trial when, by some unforseen
miracle, they had been rescued and conveyed in safety to England.
No one knew how, nor who the gallant rescuers were; but rumours
were rife and some were very wild. The superstitious believed in
direct Divine interference, though they dared not say this openly;
but in their hearts they prayed that God might interfere in the
same way on behalf of good Citizen Deseze and his family.</p>

<p>Poor Hector Deseze himself had not much hope on that score. He
was a pious man, it is true, but his piety consisted in resignation
to the will of God. Nor would he have cared much if God had only
chosen to strike at him; it was the fate of his invalid wife that
wrung his heart, and the future of his young daughter that
terrified him. He had known the Citizen Commissary practically all
his life. Lauzet was not a bad man, really. Perhaps he had got his
head rather turned through his rapid accession from his original
situation as packer in the Deseze house of business, with a bed
underneath the counter in the back shop, to that of Chief of
Section in the rural division of the department of Seine et Oise,
with an official residence in Mantes, a highly important post,
considering its proximity to Paris. But all the same Lauzet was not
a bad man, and must have kept some gratitude in his heart for all
the kindness shown to him by the Deseze family when he was a lad in
their employ.</p>

<p>But in spite of every appeal Lauzet remained stony-hearted. "If
I did anything for you, Citizen, on my own responsibility," he said
to Deseze during the course of an interrogatory, "I should not only
lose my position, but probably my head into the bargain. I have no
ill-will towards you, but I am not prepared to take such a risk on
your behalf."</p>

<p>"But my poor wife," Deseze protested, putting his pride in his
pocket and stooping to appeal to the man who had once been a menial
in his pay. "She is almost bedridden now and has not long to live.
Could you not exercise some benevolent authority for her sake?"</p>

<p>Lauzet shook his head. "Impossible," he said decisively.</p>

<p>"And my daughter," moaned the distracted father, "my little
Madeleine is not yet thirteen. What will be her fate? My God,
Lauzet! Have you no bowels of compassion? Have not you got a
daughter of your own?"</p>

<p>"I have," Lauzet retorted curtly, "and therefore I have taken
special care to keep on the right side of the government and never
to express an opinion on anything that is done for the good of the
State. And I should advise you, Citizen Deseze, to do likewise, so
that you may earn for yourself and your family some measure of
mercy for your transgressions."</p>

<p>And with this grandiloquent phrase, Lauzet indicated that the
interview was now at an end. He also ordered the prisoner to be
taken back to Moisson, and there to be kept in the cells until the
following day, when arrangements would be complete for conveying
the Deseze family under escort to Paris.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>The following day was market-day in Moisson, and at first Lauzet
had been doubtful whether it would not be best to wait another
twenty-four hours before carrying through his friend Chauvelin's
project. The dawn, however, broke with ideal conditions for it: a
leaden sky, a tearing wind, and torrents of rain, alternating with
a thin drizzle. On the whole, Nature had ranged herself on the side
of all those who worked their nefarious deeds under cover of
semi-darkness. Lauzet, gazing out on the mournful, autumnal aspect
of weather and sky, felt that if the Scarlet Pimpernel did indeed
meditate mischief he would choose such a day as this.</p>

<p>Thus it was that in the early dawn of this market-day the
citizens of Moisson had a sad scene to witness. Soon after seven
o'clock a small crowd collected round the big old-fashioned
diligence which had drawn up outside the Deseze house in the Rue
des Pipots. To right and left of the behicle were soldiers on
horseback, two on each side, mounting guard, and the man who held
the reins was also in the uniform of the rural gendarmarie.
Everyone in the city knew this man. Charles-Marie was his name, and
he had begun life as a baker's assistant-a weak, anaemic-looking
youth, who had been sent out of the Army because he was no use as a
fighting man, so timorous and slow-witted was he.</p>

<p>Lately he had obtained a position as ostler at the posting inn
in Mantes because, it seems, he did know something about horses;
but why he should have been chosen to drive the diligence to Paris
to-day, nobody could conjecture. He must have had a friend in high
places to be so exalted above his capabilities. Anyway, there he
sat on the box, looking neither to right nor left, but straight
between the ears of his off-leader, and not a word would he say in
response to the questions, the jeers and the taunts which came to
him from his friends in the crowd.</p>

<p>Soon, however, excitement centred round the <i>portecochere</i>
of the Deseze house. It had suddenly been thrown wide open, and in
the doorway appeared poor Citizeness Deseze escorted by two
officers of <i>gendarmerie</i>, and closely followed by Madeleine,
her little daughter, also under guard. It was pitiable to see the
poor invalid, who could scarcely stand on her half-paralysed limbs,
thus being dragged away from her home where she had lived as a
happy wife and mother for close on a quarter of a century. A murmur
of sympathy for the two women and of execration for the brutality
of this arrest rose from the crowd. But it was quickly enough
suppressed. Who would dare to murmur openly these days, when spies
of the revolutionary government lurked at every street corner?</p>

<p>Hostile glances, however, were shot at Citizen Lauzet, who had
come over that morning from Mantes and now stood by, somewhat
detached from the crowd, watching the proceedings in the company of
his friend Chauvelin.</p>

<p>"Is this in accordance with your idea?" he asked in a whisper
when, presently, Chauvelin completed a quick and comprehensive
examination of the diligence.</p>

<p>Chauvelin's only reply was a curt and peremptory "Hush", and a
furtive glance about him to see that there were no likely
eavesdroppers within hearing. He knew from experience that the
famous League of the Scarlet Pimpernel also had spies lurking in
every corner; spies not so numerous perhaps as those in the pay of
the Committee of Public Safety, but a great deal more astute, and
he also knew-none better-that the case of the Deseze family was
just one that would appeal to the sporting or chivalrous instincts
of that band of English adventurers.</p>

<p>But he was satisfied with the <i>mise-en-scene</i> organized,
under his supervision, by Chief of Section Lauzet. Prominence had
been given all over the department to the arrest of the Deseze
family, to the worth and integrity of its head, the sickness of the
wife, the charm and modesty of the daughter. Half a dozen picked
men of the <i>gendarmerie</i> of Mantes, armed to the teeth, would
join the diligence at Mantes, but they would ride inside disguised
as passengers, whilst it was left for anybody to see that the coach
was travelling under a feeble guard of four men, an officer and
three troopers, and was driven by a lout who was known to have no
fight in him.</p>

<p>Lauzet had been inspired when he chose this day; a typical day
in late October, with that pitiless rain lashed by a south-easterly
wind that would score the roads and fret the horses. Down in the
forest, the diligence would have to go almost at foot-pace, for the
outline of every tree on the roadside would be blurred, and objects
would loom like ghosts out of the mist.</p>

<p>Yes! the scene was well set for the comedy invented by Chauvelin
for the capture of his arch enemy. It only remained for the
principal actors to play their roles to his satisfaction. Already
the female prisoners had been hustled into the diligence amidst the
sighs and tears of their sympathizers in the crowd. Poor Madame
Deseze had sunk half-fainting with exhaustion into the arms of her
young daughter, and the two women sat huddled in the extreme corner
of the vehicle, more dead than alive. And now, amidst much jolting
and creaking, some shouting and cursing, too, with cracking of whip
and jingling of spurs, the awkward, lumbering diligence was started
on its way. Some two hundred metres further on, it came to a halt
once more, outside the commissariat, and here the male prisoner,
Citizen Deseze himself, was made to join his family in the airless,
creaking vehicle. Resigned to his own fate, he set himself the task
of making the painful journey as endurable as may be to his invalid
wife. Hardly realizing yet the extent of their misfortune and the
imminence of their doom, the three victims of Lauzet's cupidity and
Chauvelin's vengeance suffered their martyrdom in silence and with
resignation.</p>

<p>The final start from Moisson had been made at eight o'clock. By
this time, the small city was filling with the neighbouring farmers
and drovers, with their cattle and their carts and vehicles of
every kind, all tending either to the Place du Marche, or to the
various taverns for refreshment. Lauzet, accompanied by Chauvelin,
had ridden back to Mantes. Just before nine o'clock the diligence
rattled over the cobblestones of that city, and a halt was called
at the posting inn. It was part of the programme to spend some
hours in Mantes, where the extra men of the <i>gendarmerie</i>
would be picked up, and only to make a fresh start when the shades
of evening were beginning to draw in. It was not to be supposed
that the English brigands would launch their attack in broad
daylight, and the weather did not look as if it were going to
mend.</p>

<p>Chauvelin, of course, was there, seeing to every arrangement,
with his friend Lauzet close at his elbow. He had himself picked
out the six men of the <i>gendarmerie</i> who were to ride in
disguise inside the diligence; he had inspected their disguises,
added an artistic or realistic touch here and there before he
pronounced them to be good.</p>

<p>Finally he turned to the young officer who was in command of the
party.</p>

<p>"Now," he said very earnestly to him, "you know just what you
are going to do? You realize the importance of the mission which is
being entrusted to you?"</p>

<p>The officer nodded in reply. He was a young man and ambitious.
The task which had been allotted to him had fired his enthusiasm.
Indeed, in these days, the capture of that elusive English spy
known as the Scarlet Pimpernel was a goal for which every young
officer of <i>gendarmerie</i> was wont to strive; not only because
of the substantial moetary reward in prospect, but because of the
glory attached to the destruction of so bitter an enemy of
revolutionary France.</p>

<p>"I will tell you, Citizen," the young man said to Chauvelin,
"how I have finally laid my plans, and you shall tell me if you
approve. About a kilometre and half before the road emerges out of
the wood, the ground rises gradually, and there are one or two
sharp bends in the road until it reaches the crest of the hill.
That part of the forest if very lonely, and at a point just before
the ground begins to rise I intend to push my mount on for a metre
or two ahead of the men, and pretend to examine the leaders of the
team. After a while I will call 'Halt,' and make as if I thought
there was something wrong with the traces. The driver is such a
lout that he and I will embark on a long argument as to what he
should do to remedy the defect, and in the course of the argument I
will contrive to slip a small piece of flint which I have in my
pocket under the hoof of one of the coach horses."</p>

<p>"You don't think one of your men will see you doing that-and
perhaps wonder?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can be careful. It is done in a moment. Then we shall get
on the road again, and five minutes later that same coach-horse
will be dead lame. Another halt for examination this time near the
crest of the hill. The lout of a driver will never discover what is
amiss. I shall make as if the hurt was serious, and set myself the
task of tending it. I thought then, subject to your approval, of
ordering the troopers to dismount. I have provided them with good
wine and certain special rations in their knapsacks. At a word from
me they will rest by the roadside, seemingly heedless and
unconcerned, but really very wide-awake and keen on the scent. The
diligence will the while be at a standstill, with doors shut and
curtains closley drawn, but the six men whom we have stowed inside
the coach are keen on their work, well-armed and, like hungry
wolves, eager to get their teeth into the enemies of France. They
will be on the alert, their hands on their pistols, ready to spring
up and out of the coach at the first sign of an attack. Now what
think you of that setting, Citizen?" the young officer concluded,
"for luring the English spies into a fight? Their methods are
usually furtive, but this time they will have to meet us in
hand-to-hand combat, and, if they fall into our trap, I know that
we can deal with them."</p>

<p>"I can but pronounce your plan admirable, Citizen Captain,"
Chauvelin replied approvingly. "You have my best wishes for your
success. In the meanwhile Citizen Lauzet and I will be anxiously
waiting for news. We'll make a start soon after you, and strike the
bridle-path through the forest. This gives us a short cut which
will bring us to Epone just in time to hear your news. If you have
been attacked, send me a courier thither as soon as you have the
English spies securely bound and gagged inside the coach."</p>

<p>"I'll not fail you, Citizen," the young Captain rejoined
eagerly.</p>

<p>Lauzet, who stood by, anxious and silent, whilst this colloquy
was going on, shrugged his shoulders with a show of philosophy.</p>

<p>"And at worst," he said, "if that meddlesome Scarlet Pimpernel
should think prudence the better part of valour, if he should scent
a trap and carefully avoid it, we would always have the
satisfaction of sending the Deseze family to the guillotine."</p>

<p>"The English spies," Chauvelin rejoined dryly, "will not scent a
trap, nor will they give up the attempt to rescue the Deseze
family. This is just a case to rouse their ire against us, and if
it prove successful, one to flatter their vanity and redound to
their credit in their own country. No," he went on thoughtfully, "I
have no fear that the Scarlet Pimpernel will evade us this time. He
will attack, I know. The only question is, when he does are we
sufficiently prepared to defeat him?"</p>

<p>"With the half-dozen excellent men whom I have picked up here in
Mantes," the young officer retorted, "I shall have nine under my
command, and we are prepared for the attack. It is the English
spies who will be surprised, we who will hold the advantage, even
as to numbers, for the Scarlet Pimpernel can only work with two or
three followers and we shall outnumber them three to one."</p>

<p>"Then good luck attend you, Citizen Captain," Chauvelin said at
last. "You are in a fair way of rendering your country a signal
service; see that you let not fame and fortune evade you in the
end. Remember that you will have to deal with one of the most
astute as well as most daring adventurers of our times, who has
baffled men that were cleverer and, at least, as ambitious as
yourself. Stay," the Terrorist added, and placed his thin,
claw-like hand as if in warning on the other man's arm. "It is
impossible, even for me who knows him as he is and who has seen him
in scores of disguises, to give you any accurate description of his
personality; but one thing you can bear in mind is that he is tall
above the average; tall, even for an Englishman, and his height is
the one thing about him that he cannot disguise. So beware of every
man who is taller than yourself, Citizen Captain; however innocent
he may appear, take the precaution to detain him. Mistrust every
tall man, for one of them is of a surety the Scarlet
Pimpernel."</p>

<p>He fianlly reminded the young Captain to send him a courier with
the welcome news as soon as possible. "Citizen Lauzet and I," he
concluded, "will ride by the bridle-path and await you at Epone. I
shall be devoured with anxiety until I hear from you."</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>The men were not nervous, not at first. They were merely
excited, knowng what awaited them, both during the journey and
afterwards by way of reward. If they were successful there would be
for every man engaged in the undertaking a sufficiency to provide
for himself and his family for the rest of his life. The capture of
the Scarlet Pimpernel! Half a dozen magic words in truth, and they
had spurred Citizen Captain Raffet and his squad with boundless
enthusiasm. They felt no discomfort either from tearing wind or
driving rain. With eyes fixed before them they rode on, striving to
pierce the mist-laden distance where the enemy of France was even
now lurking, intent on that adventure which would be his last.</p>

<p>It was long past five o'clock when the diligence with its escort
reached the edge of the forest. What little daylight there had been
all afternoon was already beginning to wane; the sky was of a
leaden colour, heavily laden with rain-clouds, save 'way behind in
the west, where a few fiery, crimson streaks cut through the clouds
like sharp incisions, there, where the setting sun still lingered
in the autumn sky.</p>

<p>The men now were keenly on the alert, their eyes searching the
dim light that glimmered through the forest trees, their ears
attuned to the slightest sound that rose above the patter of their
horses' hoofs, or the grinding of the coach wheels over the muddy
road. The forest between Mezieres and Epone is four kilometre long;
the road which intersects it plunges down into the valley and then
rises up again with one or two sharp bends to the crest of the
hill, after which, within the space of two hundred yards the forest
trees quickly become sparse, and the open country lies spread out
like a map with, on the right, the ribbon of the Seine winding its
way along to St. Germain and Paris.</p>

<p>It was in the forest that the enemy would lurk. Out in the open
he would find no cover, and could be sighted a couple of kilometres
all round and more, if he attempted one of his audacious tricks.
The light, which became more and more fitful as the sun sank lower
in the west, made observation difficult; the thicket to right and
left of the road looked like a dark, impenetrable wall, from behind
which, mayhap, dozens of pairs of eyes were peering, ready to
attack. The men who were riding by the side of the coach felt queer
sensations at the roots of their hair; their hands, moist and hot,
clung convulsively to the reins, and the glances which they cast
about them became furtive and laden with fear.</p>

<p>But those who were inside the diligence had no superstitious
terrors to contend with. The <i>aristos</i> were huddled up
together in the far corner of the vehicle, and the men had spread
themselves out, three a side, as comfortably as they could. A
couple of bottles of excellent wine had been a welcome supplement
to their rations, and put additional heart into them. One of them
had produced a pack of greasy, well-worn cards from his pocket with
which to while away the time.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later the Captain in command called a halt;
the jolting vehicle came to a standstill with a jerk, and there was
much scrambling and creaking and jingling, while the driver got
down from his seat to see what was amiss. Nothing much apparently,
for a minute or two later the diligence was once more on its way.
Soon there was an appreciable slackening of speed, then a halt.
More shouting and swearing, creaking and scrambling. The men inside
marvelled what was amiss. It was as much as their life was worth to
put their heads out of the window, or even to draw one of the
tattered blinds to one side in order to peep. But they quickly put
cards and wine away; it was better to be prepared for the word of
command which might come now at any moment. They strained their
ears to listen, and one by one, a word or two, a movement, a sound,
told them what was happening. Their comrades outside were ordered
to dismount, to take it easy, to sit down by the roadside and rest.
It seems one of the draught-horses had gone lame. The men who were
inside sighed with a longing for rest, too, a desire to stretch
their cramped limbs, but they did not murmur. They were waiting for
the word of command that would release them from their inactivity.
Until then there was nothing to do but to wait. No doubt this halt
by the roadside was just a part of the great scheme for luring the
English adventurers to the attack. Grimly and in silence the six
picked men inside the coach drew their pistols from their wallets,
saw that they were primed and in order, and then laid them across
their knees with their fingers on the triggers, in readiness for
the Englishmen when they came.</p>

<p class="cpb">6.</p>

<p>It was not everybody at Moisson who sympathized with the Deseze
family when they were arrested. There were all the envious, the
dissatisfied, the ambitious, as well as the ragtag-and-bobtail of
the district who had linked their fortunes with the revolutionary
government and who looked for their own advancement by loudly
proclaiming their loyalty to its decrees. For such as these the
Deseze family, with their well-known integrity, their wealth and
unostentatious piety, were just a set of <i>aristos</i> whom the
principles of the glorious revolution condemned as traitors to the
State and to the people.</p>

<p>And on market-days Moisson was always full of such people; they
were noisy and they were aggressive, and while the sympathizers
with the Deseze family, after they had waved a last farewell
towards the fast disappearing diligence, went quietly about their
business or returned silently to their homes, the others thought
this a good opportunity for airing some of those sentiments which
would be reported in influential quarters if any government spy
happened to be within earshot.</p>

<p>In spite of the persistent bad weather men congregated in and
about the market-place during the intervals of business, and
lustily discussed the chief event of the day. There was much talk
of Citizen Lauzet whom everyone had known as a young out-at-elbows
ragamuffin in the employ of Hector Deseze, and who now had power of
life and death over the very man who had been his master. Be it
noted that Lauzet appeared to have very few friends among the crowd
of drovers and shepherds and the farmers who came in with their
produce from the outlying homesteads. With advancement in life had
come arrogance in the man and a perpetual desire to assert his
authority over those with whom he had fraternized in the past.
Those, however, who had their homes in the immediate neighbourhood
of Mantes dared not say much, for Lauzet was feared almost as much
as he was detested, but the strangers who had come into Moisson
with their cattle and their produce were free enough with their
tongue. Rumour had gone far afield about this arrest of the Deseze
family, and many there were who asserted that mysterious
undercurrents were at work in this affair; undercurrents that would
draw Citizen Lauzet up on the crest of a tidal wave to the giddy
heights of incredible fortune.</p>

<p>Nay more! There were many who positively asserted that in some
unexplainable way the whole of the Deseze affair was connected with
the capture of the English spy known throughout France as the
Scarlet Pimpernel. This spy had been at work in the district some
time; everyone knew that it was he who had dragged those ci-devant
traitors and <i>aristos</i>, the Tournon-d'Agenays, out of Citizen
Lauzet's clutches, and Citizen Lauzet was now having his revenge.
He would capture the Scarlet Pimpernel, catch him in the very act
of trying to effect the escape of the Deseze family, and thus earn
the reward of ten thousand livres offered to any man who would lay
that enemy of France by the heels.</p>

<p>Lucky Lauzet! Thus to have the means of earning a sum of money
sufficient to keep a man and his family in affluence for the rest
of their lives. And besides the money there would be glory too! Who
could gauge the height to which a man might rise if he brought
about the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel? Well, Lauzet would do
it! Lucky Lauzet! He would certainly do it, asserted some; those
sort of men always have all the luck! There were even those who
asserted that the Scarlet Pimpernel was already captured and that
Lauzet had got him. Lucky, lucky Lauzet!</p>

<p>"You don't suppose," one man declared, "that anything would be
known of the affair unless it was already accomplished? Lauzet is
not one to talk till after a thing is done. No! No! Believe me, my
friends, Lauzet has already got his ten thousand livres in his
pocket!"</p>

<p>He was a wizened, little old man from over Lanoy way, and now he
dolefully shook his head.</p>

<p>"And to think," he went on, "that I might have laid that English
spy by the heels myself, if I had had a bit of luck like
Lauzet."</p>

<p>A shout of derision greeted this astounding assertion.</p>

<p>"You <i>papa</i> Sargon?" one of the crowd ejaculated with a
loud laugh. "You, laying the English spy by the heels? That is the
best joke I've heard for many a day. Will you tell us how that came
about?"</p>

<p>And <i>papa</i> Sargon told the tale how he and his wife had a
visit from a squad of soldiers who told him that they were after a
band of English spies who were known to be in that district. The
soldiers asked for a night's shelter as they were weary after a
long day's ride. <i>Papa</i> Sargon remained convinced in his own
mind that for the better part of a night he had harboured the most
bitter enemies of his country, and if he had only guessed who those
supposed soldiers were, he might have informed the local commissary
of police, and earned ten thousand livres for himself. Now this
story would not perhaps have been altogether convincing to
unprejudiced ears, but such as it was, and with everything that had
occurred in Moisson these past few days, it aroused considerable
excitement. It went to prove that the Scarlet Pimpernel was not
nearly so mysterious or so astute as rumour credited him to be,
since he almost fell a victim to <i>papa</i> Sargon. It also went
to prove to the satisfaction of the company present that Citizen
Lauzet had been sharper than <i>papa</i> Sargon and, having come
across the Scarlet Pimpernel through some lucky accident, he had
laid hands on him and was even now conveying him to Paris, where a
grateful government would hand him over the promised reward of ten
thousand livres.</p>

<p>This notion, which gradually filtrated into the minds of the
company, did not tend to make Citizen Lauzet any more popular; and
when presently most of that same company adjourned to Leon's for
refreshment, there were some among the younger men who wanted to
know why they should not have their share in those ten thousand
livres. The Scarlet Pimpernel, they argued with more enthusiasm
than logic, had been captured in their district. The Deseze family
who were in some way connected with the capture were citizens of
Moisson; why should not they, citizens of Moisson too, finger a
part of the reward?</p>

<p>It was all very wild and very illogical, and it would have been
impossible for anyone to say definitely who was the prime mover in
the ensuing resolution which, by the way, was carried unanimously,
that a deputation should set out forthwith for Mantes to interview
Citizen Lauzet and demand in the name of justice, and for the
benefit of Moisson, some share in the money prize granted by the
government for the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Subsequently,
both <i>papa</i> Sargon and a drover from Aincourt were held to be
chiefly to blame, but as <i>papa</i> Sargon very properly remarked,
neither he nor the stranger from Aincourt stood to gain anything by
the wild-goose chase, so why should they have instigated it?</p>

<p>Be that as it may, soon after the midday meal, half a score of
young stalwarts climbed into the cart of the drover from Aincourt,
and the party, full of enthusiasm and of Leon's excellent red wine,
set out for Mantes. They had provided themselves with a
miscellaneous collection of arms; those who possessed guns brought
them along, then they borrowed a couple of pistols from Leon and
two more from old Mitau who had been a soldier in his day. Some of
them had sabres, others took sickles or scythes which might be
useful; one man had a saw, another took a wood-chopper. All these
things would be very useful should there be a fight over this
affair, and most of them hoped that there <i>would</i> be a
fight.</p>

<p>The first disappointment came on arrival to Mantes. Here at the
Commissariat they were informed that Citizen Lauzet had been gone
these past two hours. He had ridden away in the company of his
friend who had come fron Paris some two days previously. The
general idea prevalent at the Commissariat was that the two men had
ridden away in the direction of Paris.</p>

<p>The second disappointment, a corollary of the first, was that
the diligence with prisoners and escort had started on its way less
than half an hour ago. It seemed in very truth as if the plot
thickened. Lauzet and his friend from Paris gone, the diligence
gone! No one paused to reflect how this could possibly mean
anything in the nature of a plot, but by this time spirits were
inflamed. Unaccountably inflamed. Everyone was so poor these days;
money was so terribly hard to earn; work was so grinding,
remuneration so small, that now that the idea of the capture of the
English spy with its attendant reward had seized hold of the
imagination of these young hotheads, they clung to it tenaciously,
grimly, certain that if they acted quickly and wisely, and if no
one else got in the way, they would succeed in gaining the golden
prize. A competence! Just think of it! And with nothing to do for
it but an exciting adventure. And here was Lauzet interfering!
Snatching the prize for himself! Lauzet, who already drew a large
salary from the State for very little work.</p>

<p>All this had been talked over, sworn over, discussed, commented
at great length all the way between Moisson and Mantes, in the
rickety cart driven by the drover from Aincourt. He was a wise man,
that drover. His advise was both sound and bold. "Why," he asked
pertinently, "should a man like Citizen Lauzet get everything he
wants? I say it is because he has a friend over in Paris who comes
along and helps him. Because he has money and influence. What? Was
there ever anything seen quite so unjust? Where is the English spy,
my friend? I ask you. He is in this district. Our district. And
what I say is that what's in our district belongs to us. Remember
there's ten thousand livres waiting for every man who takes a hand
in the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Ten thousand livres! and
Citizen Lauzet with that stranger from Paris is even at this hour
riding away with it in his pocket."</p>

<p>He spoke a great many more equally eloquent words, for he had a
gift of speech, had this drover from Aincourt. A rough fellow, it
is true, but one with his heart in the right place, and born in the
district, too; anyone could tell that by the contemptuous way with
which he spoke of any stranger born outside this corner of Seine et
Oise. To the man who had sat next to him on the way from Moisson to
Mantes he had confided the story of his life; told him that at
thirteen years of age he had been pressed into service on board one
of the ci-devant tyrant's ships, that the ship had been captured by
English corsairs, and he had been a galley slave until he succeeded
in breaking his chains and swimming to shore while the English
sloop lay off Ushant. No wonder he hated the whole foul brood of
the English. He was their slave for nigh on twenty years. And
always he harked back on the golden prize which, he declared, would
not be shared up. Each and every man who took a hand in the capture
of the English spy would receive his ten thousand livres.</p>

<p>He was listened to with great attention, was the drover. And his
words presently carried all the more weight because something very
strange came to light. It appeared that the diligence from Moisson
with prisoners and escort had made a half of several hours in
Mantes. The party only made a fresh start in the late afternoon.
That was strange enough in all conscience. What did it mean but
that Lauzet was courting the darkness for his schemes? But there
was something more mysterious still. While the diligence stood
before the posting inn ready to start, horses pawing and champing,
the driver on his box, whip in hand, the four troopers who were on
guard to right and left of the vehicle would not allow anyone to
come within measurable distance of it. Be it noted that all the
blinds of the coach were drawn so that it was impossible to get a
peep at the inside. But two young men, strangers to the
neighbourhood, who had since come forward, eager to tell their
story, more venturesome than others, had crept under the horses'
bellies and tried to peer into the interior of the coach. They were
almost immediately driven away with blows and curses by the
troopers, but not before they had vaguely perceived that there were
more than just the prisoners inside the diligence. The prisoners
were all huddled up in the furthest corner of the vehicle, but
there were others. The young men who had had a peep, despite the
blows from the troopers, had seen three or four men at least. They
might have been ordinary travellers who had picked up the diligence
at Mantes. But in that case, why all this secrecy? Why the drawn
blinds, the start in the late afternoon so that the shades of
evening would actually be drawing in when the diligence and its
escort ploughed its way through the muddy road of the forest
between Mezieres and Epone? Why a feeble escort of only four men
when, of late, and when the ci-devant Tournon-d'Agenays were being
conveyed to Paris, as many as eight or ten picked troopers of the
National Guard had ridden beside the diligence? Indeed, the drover
from Aincourt was right. Indubitably right. Citizen Lauzet and his
friend from Paris had entered into a plot, a dastardly, cowardly
plot to cheat the citizens of Moisson of their just share in the
capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel. There was no doubt that the
Scarlet Pimpernel was already captured, and that Lauzet was having
him conveyed in secret to Paris. The escort might appear feeble,
but there were men inside the diligence who held the English spy,
bound hand and foot between them, with a cocked pistol at his head.
Why! The two young strangers who had succeeded in getting a peep at
the inside of the diligence quite thought, from the description
everyone had of him, that one of the men whom they glimpsed was in
very truth the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>"He was so tall," they said, "so tall that he had to sit almost
bend double, otherwise his head would have knocked against the roof
of the coach." They were almost prepared to swear also that this
tall man's hands were tied together with ropes.</p>

<p>After that, as the drover from Aincourt very properly said, any
man would be a fool who doubted Lauzet's treachery and cupidity. It
was resolved to proceed immediately in his wake, to seize him
wherever he might be, him and any man who had helped him in his
treachery. Aye, if he had an army to protect him, he would find
that the men of Moisson and Mantes were not to be flouted and
cheated with impunity. The drover from Aincourt was bribed to take
the party in his cart as far as Mezieres. He demurred a little at
first; seemed to turn crusty and impervious to threats. Eventually
he was offered one hundred livres out of every man's share if the
English spy was captured, and one livre if he was not.</p>

<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>," he said at last in token of consent, and they
all scrambled back into the cart.</p>

<p class="cpb">7.</p>

<p>Captain Raffet had given the order to dismount and the troopers
sat by the roadside under the trees, making a pretence to rest.
Each man, however, had his sabre ready to his hand, and each had
seen to the priming of his pistol, while the Captain himself
ostensibly busied himself with examining the fetlock of the mare
who had gone lame. The wind had gone down and the torrential rain
had ceased, but there was a thin mist-like drizzle that soaked
through the men's clothing and chilled them to the bone. The
tension had become acute. With nerves on edge the men, those who
were in the open as well as those who were cooped up inside the
diligence, could do nothing but wait while the time dragged on and
the woods was full of sounds; of the crackling of twigs, the fall
of rain-laden leaves, the scrunching of earth under tiny, furtive,
feet scurrying away through the undergrowth. The great, awkward
diligence loomed out of the mist like some gigantic spectral
erection, peopled by forms that breathed and lived and hardly
emitted a sound. Only very occasionally from the interior there
came the painful moan, quickly suppressed, from the poor invalid's
parched throat.</p>

<p>And all at once something more tangible: a patter of feet, a
call, a voice half-drowned in the gathering mist. It came way down
the road, from the direction of Mézieres. The men sat up, alert,
quivering with excitement, their eyes straining to pierce the
thicket, since the sharp bend in the road hid the oncomers from
view. The order was to feign inattention, to wait for the attack,
lest the wily enemy, scenting a trap, scampered away to safety. And
the men waited, very much like greyhounds held in leash, quivering
with eagerness, their hot, moist hands grasping sabre and pistol,
the while Captain Raffet, as keenly alert as they, carried on a
desultory conversation with the driver about the mare's injured
fetlock. Vague forms began to detach themselves out of the mist,
coming round the bend; soon they gained volume and substance. The
voice still calling gained power and clarity. It was as much as
Captain Raffet could do, by muttered word and glance of eye, to
keep those human greyhounds of his in check. With the Scarlet
Pimpernel perhaps in sight they were straining on the leash to its
breaking-point.</p>

<p>It was at the very moment that, throwing all prudence to the
wind, the men suddenly raised themselves upon their knees, and were
on the point of springing to their feet, unable to contain their
excitement any longer, that Charles-Marie, the loony driver, who
had once been a baker's assistant, exclaimed joyfully,
"<i>Pardi</i>! If it isn't Citizen Plante home from market
already." And the next instant the oncoming figure revealed itself
as that of an old man, walking along with the aid of a tall stick,
and calling at times to his dog or to the half-dozen sheep he was
driving before him.</p>

<p>Citizen Plante was not of a gregarious disposition, nor of an
inquisitive one apparently, for he passed by without a word or
glance of curiosity directed at the troopers or at the vehicle. All
that he did was to nod to the driver as he went by, whilst the men
gazed at him, wide-eyed and open-mouthed, as if he had been a
spectre. And like a spectre he seemed to glide past them and out of
sight. A minute or two later the twilight and the mist had
swallowed him up with his sheep and his dog, and had smothered his
monotonous calls in the veils of the night.</p>

<p>A groan of disappointment and impatience rose from the parched
throats of the men. The passage of old Plante and his sheep had
exasperated their nerves. A moment ago they had felt chilled and
cramped; now their blood was up, their bodies were in a sweat with
the violence of their disappointment. Already Plante and his sheep
were far away. That silence, so full of sounds, had once more
descended upon the forest. Again the men waited with eyes and ears
strained, their nerves a-tingle, their breathing hard and
stertorous. And once more there fell upon their straining ears the
sound of human life coming from the direction of Mézieres. This
time it was the sound of cart-wheels creaking through the mud, and
of ill-adjusted harness jingling with the movement of
wearily-plodding horses. There was also from time to time the sound
of distant voices, a harsh call or uproarious laugh suddenly
stilled as if in response to a peremptory warning. Nothing in truth
to suggest the furtive methods of the English adventurers it seemed
more like a party of farmers coming home from market.</p>

<p>The troopers were on the alert, of course, but not quite so
keenly perhaps as they were before their disappointment over
Citizen Plante's passage across the scene. But a minute or two
later a quick word from their Captain brought them sharply to
attention. The cart had obviously come to a halt, but a lusty shout
now rang through the stillness of the night, and there was a
general sound of scampering and of running, mingled with calls of
excitement and encouragement. A few minutes of tense expectation,
then suddenly round a bend a band of ten or a dozen men came into
view, armed with miscellaneous weapons. At sight of the diligence
they gave a wild shout of triumph, brandished their weapons and
rushed to the attack.</p>

<p>"Attention, citizen soldiers," Raffet commanded hastily. "Do not
shoot unless you are obliged. But if you must, shoot low. We must
have some of those English spies alive if we can."</p>

<p>Hardly were the words out of his mouth than, with a renewed
shout of triumph, the band of young ruffians threw themselves like
a pack of enraged puppies on the soldiers, whilst others made
straight for the diligence. But before they had gone within twenty
metres of it the Captain gave the quick word of command that
brought the men of the <i>gendarmerie</i> out of the coach, pistols
in hand, ready for the fight.</p>

<p>The attacking party, however, held no laggards either. Egged on
by the drover of Aincourt and still shouting wildly, they rushed on
the men of the <i>gendarmerie</i> as they scrambled out of the
coach. Numbers being about equal on either side, the men coming out
one by one were at a great disadvantage. Almost as soon as they had
set foot to the ground they were fallen on with fist or sabre, and
soon the confusion was complete.</p>

<p>"What the devil's game is this?" Raffet shouted hoarsely, for in
an instant he found himself at grips, not with the mysterious
Scarlet Pimpernel, but with Gaspard, the son of the butcher at
Moisson, whom he had known ever since they had been ragamuffins
together. And Gaspard was as strong as some of the bullocks his
father was wont to kill. Before Raffet could recover from the
surprise of this wholly unexpected turn of events Gaspard had
brought his heavy fist crashing down on his whilom friend's
skull.</p>

<p>"It means," Gaspard shouted, mad with fury, "that thou 'rt a
traitor and that I'll teach thee to help cheat thy friends."</p>

<p>Nor could Raffet argue after that. He had need of all his
faculties to defend himself against this young ox. He had drawn his
pistol, true, but Gaspard's iron-like hand had closed around his
wrist and the fight soon degenerated to fisticuffs. The troopers
fared no better, either. Though they had been prepared for an
attack, they were not prepared for this furious onslaught made upon
them by their friends. Name of a dog! What did it all mean? For
they were all friends, these madmen, every one of them; young men
from Moisson and Lanoy and Mantes. There was François the mercer of
the Rue Grande, and Jacques whose father kept he tavern at the sign
of the Black Swan, and Paul whose mother was the best washerwoman
in Mantes. And words flew round to the accompaniment of thumping
blows.</p>

<p>"Jacques, art thou mad or drunk?"</p>

<p>"Achille! Thy father will beat thee for this escapade."</p>

<p>"Name of a name, but you'll all get something for this night's
work."</p>

<p>And all the while blows were raining fast and furious. There was
no lust to kill, only wild enthusiasm for a fight, a desire to be
avenged on friends who had aided that rascal Lauzet to cheat the
men of the district out of the golden prize.</p>

<p>"Give up the English spies or I'll squeeze the breath out of thy
throat." This from Gaspard the butcher's son who had felled his
friend Raffet to the ground and rolled over and over in the mud
with him, the two men snarling at one another and biting and
scratching like a couple of angry dogs.</p>

<p>Had they all gone mad, these men of Moisson? The issue of the
struggle might have remained longer in the balance had not Raffet
just then freed his right hand from the iron grip of Gaspard and
discharged his pistol into his whilom comrade's leg. Gaspard rolled
over on to his back with a groan and a curse.</p>

<p>"Traitor. Thou hast murdered me," he cried, while the blood
flowed freely out of his thigh.</p>

<p>But the one pistol-shot had the effect of sobering the
combatants. The aggressors had pistols, too, and sabres, but in
their excitement had forgotten how to use them. The sudden report,
however, brought the soldiers back to a sense of discipline,
wakened them, as it were, from their surprise, and in a moment gave
them a decided advantage over the undisciplined attacking party.
This wild fisticuffs could not go on. It was unworthy of the
soldiers of the Republic. They were being attacked by a band of
irresponsible young jackanapes whom the devil himself must for the
nonce have deprived of reason, but it remained for the picked men
of the rural <i>gendarmerie</i> to teach them that such madness
could not remain unpunished, and friend or foe, he who attacks a
soldier of the Republic must suffer for his wantonness. Far be it
from the chronicler of these events to pretend that all these
thoughts did surge clearly in the heads of the troopers. What is a
fact is that from the moment their Captain discharged a pistol into
Gaspard's thigh, they became masters of the situation. The fight
between soldiers and citizens assumed its just proportions; there
were a few pistol-shots, some sabre thrusts, a good deal of
groaning and cursing, while more than one stalwart besides Gaspard
rolled over in the mud.</p>

<p>The fight had lasted less than ten minutes. When the first rush
on the diligence was made, the twilight was already fading into
dusk. Now when the last shot had been fired and the last of the
hotheads had cried for mercy, dusk was slowly yielding to the
darkness of the night. Raffet called the soldiers to attention.
They were still panting with excitement, some of them were dizzy
from the blows dealt freely on their skulls; one or two showed a
bunged eye or a bleeding lip, but none of them were seriously hurt.
The hotheads from Moisson and Mantes had not fared quite so well.
Some of them had received a charge of shot in leg, arm or shoulder,
and were lying groaning or half-conscious on the ground; those two
had escaped with minor hurts were on their knees, held down by the
heavy hand of a trooper. They did not in truth represent an
edifying spectacle, with their faces streaming with blood and
perspiration, their clothes torn, their shirtsleeves hanging in
rags, their hair wet and lank, hanging before their eyes. Raffet
ordered them to be mustered up; his sharp glance ran over them as
they stood or crouched together in a line.</p>

<p>"I ought to have the lot of you summarily shot," Raffet said
sternly to them after he had inspected his men and seen that
victory had not cost them dear. "Yes, shot," he reiterated, "for
interfering with the soldiers of the Republic in the exercise of
their duty; and I will do it, too," he went on after a moment's
pause, "unless you tell me now the meaning of this abominable
escapade."</p>

<p>"You know it well, Citizen Raffet," Paul the washerwoman's son
said, still breathless with excitement and with a savage oath,
"when you joined hands with that traitor Lauzet to cheat us all of
what was our due."</p>

<p>"Joined hands with Lauzet? What the devil do you mean?" Raffet
queried frowning. "In what did I join hands with Lauzet?"</p>

<p>"In capturing the English spy and getting the reward for
yourselves when it rightly belonged to us."</p>

<p>"The reward," Raffet retorted dryly, "will be for whosoever may
be lucky to get the English spy. For the moment I imagine that if
he meant to attack us to-night your folly has scared him. The noise
you made would keep any brigand out of the way."</p>

<p>"No use lying to us, Raffet," one of the others retorted
somewhat incoherently. It was François who spoke this time, the
mercer from the Rue Grande, and he had always been noted for his
eloquence. "You raised your hands against us citizens of the
Republic who came here to avenge an unpardonable wrong. And let me
tell you that 'tis you who will suffer for this night's work-"</p>

<p>"<i>Ah ça</i>!" Raffet broke in savagely, for his temper was
still up. "How long are you going to talk in riddles? In truth it's
the devil that has deprived you of your senses. What's all this
talk about the English spy? Who told you we were after him? And why
should you hinder us from doing our duty?"</p>

<p>"We know," François retorted, striving to appear calm and full
of dignity, "that not only were you after the English spy, but we
know that you captured him in our district and that you have got
him in the diligence yonder and are conveying him to Paris, where
you and your friends will share ten thousand livres which by rights
should have belonged to us men of the district where the spies were
captured."</p>

<p>"What gibberish is this? I tell you that not only have we not
got the English spy, but owing to your senseless folly, we are not
likely to get him now."</p>

<p>"I say that the English spy is in your diligence," François
exclaimed, and pointed dramatically at the old vehicle which stood
like a huge, solid mass, heavier and darker than the surrounding
gloom. "Some of us have seen him, I tell you." And his companions,
even those who were in the sorriest plight, nodded in assent.</p>

<p>But Raffet swallowed his temper now. What was the use of arguing
with these fools? He would have thought it beneath his dignity to
five them ocular demonstration that the diligence now only held
three miserable <i>aristos</i>. But the trouble was what to do with
this crowd. Raffet counted them over. There were eight of them, and
four of these were helpless with wounds in the legs. Somehow at the
first rush Raffet thought there had been more like a dozen young
ruffians and he had a distinct recollection of a big, clumsy fellow
who seemed the prime mover in this senseless escapade. But no doubt
he as well as one or two others had had the good sense to take to
their heels, and Raffet had certainly no intention of scouring the
woods for them. On the other hand, he had every intention of seeing
those that remained well punished for their folly. He did not wish
to drag them along with him to Epone. It was another four
kilometres and more and the first part of the journey would still
be through the forest; with the gathering darkness the coach-horses
would have to be led by men carrying lanterns.</p>

<p>Pondering a moment over the future of his prisoners, Raffet had
a sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>"Who drove the cart that brought you all hither?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"A man from Lanoy," Paul, the washerwoman's son, replied.</p>

<p>"Then he shall take you back to Mantes the way you came."</p>

<p>"You would not dare-" One of the others protested.</p>

<p>Raffet, however, had already turned to his corporal of
<i>gendarmerie</i>.</p>

<p>"Citizen Corporal," he said, "take these rascals as far as the
cart which brought them thither. It must have come to a halt
somewhere near the bottom of the hill. Let two of your men go with
them to Mantes and there hand them over to the deputy commissary.
Order the owner of the cart to drive them on pain of severe
punishment if he refuses. Take one of the lanthorns with you. It
will be needed as the road will be pitch dark before they are well
on their way. And stay! You have some stout cord inside the
diligence. We were going to use it on the English spy. Now it will
serve to bind these rogues together two by two, lest they try some
more of their tricks on you. Those who are hurt can lie in the
bottom of the cart."</p>

<p>"Citizen Raffet," François, the mercer, raised his voice in
final impotent protest. "You will answer to the State for this
outrage on her citizens."</p>

<p>But Raffet was no longer in a mind to listen. The corporal had
sent one of the men to find the length of rope which was inside the
diligence and was to have served for binding up the English spies,
and now it would be used on a lot of jackanapes on their homeward
journey to Mantes. Protests and curses were indeed in vain, and the
soldiers, whose tempers had not yet cooled down, were none too
gentle with the rope. Raffet, in the meanwhile, had called one of
the men of the <i>gendarmerie</i> to him. "Ride, Citizen Soldier,"
he commanded, "as fast you can to Epone. You will find the Citizen
Commissary and his friend from Paris at the posting inn. Tell them
just what has occurred and that I am sending the pack of miscreants
back to Mantes for punishment. Tell them also that this senseless
piece of folly has not left us unprepared for attack by the English
spies, though we have not much more hope in that direction now. We
shall be on the road again in a quarter of an hour, but will have
to walk the horses practically all the way, so do not expect to be
in Epone for another two hours at least."</p>

<p>Then at last did comparative silence fall upon the scene, where
a brief while ago deafening shouts and tumultuous melée had roused
the woodland echoes. Only the prisoners now were heard groaning and
cursing. The courier had ridden away bearing the unwelcome news to
Lauzet and his friend from Paris; the men who were not busy with
the prisoners were looking to their horses or their accoutrements,
while Raffet stood by, observant and grim. And suddenly, right out
of the darkness there came the sound of agonizing calls for
help.</p>

<p>"What was that?" Raffet queried straining his ears to
listen.</p>

<p>"Help," came from the distance. And then again, "Help! Ho," and
"Curse you, why don't you come?" And with it all the now familiar
sound of men fighting and shouting. Not so very far away either. A
couple of hundred metres, perhaps, just the other side of the bend.
Were it not for the thicket and darkness, a man could cut his way
through to where those shouts came from in a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!"</p>

<p>One of the prisoners broke into a harsh laugh. "It's Citizen
Lauzet, I'll wager," he said, "and his friend from Paris."</p>

<p>"Citizen Lauzet?" Raffet exclaimed. "What in hell do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Well," Paul, the washerwoman's son, replied still laughing and
forgetting his sorry plight in the excellence of the joke. "We
found those two ambling on the bridle-path, on their way to Epone,
ready no doubt to seize the largest share of reward for the capture
of the Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>

<p>"Great God!"</p>

<p>"And so we seized them both," François, the mercer, rejoined,
"and did to them what you are doing now to us; gave them a good
hiding, then bound them together with ropes and threw them in the
bottom of the cart."</p>

<p>"Name of a dog!"</p>

<p>"And no doubt," came a high-pitched voice from among the group
of prisoners, "the English spies have found them and..."</p>

<p>"Malediction!" But Raffet got no further. Astonishment not
unmixed with terror rendered him speechless. The Scarlet Pimpernel.
Ye Gods! And the Chief of Section and his friend at the mercy of
that fiend. Even now his straining ears seemed to perceive through
these calls for help a triumphant battle-cry in a barbaric
tongue.</p>

<p>"Here," he cried to the troopers. "Two of you are sufficient to
bring these rascals along; and you, corporal, and two men come with
me. Citizen Lauzet and his friend are being murdered even now."</p>

<p>He hurried down the road followed by the corporal and two men of
the <i>gendarmerie</i>, whilst those that were left behind saw to
it that the perpetrators of all this additional outrage and of all
this pother were duly garrotted and started on their way.</p>

<p>To them Raffet shouted a final: "Three of you remain to guard
the prisoners and make ready for an immediate start when we
return." Then he disappeared round the bend in the road.</p>

<p class="cpb">8.</p>

<p>The shouting had ceased as Raffet and his troops hurried along.
Indeed, at first he might have thought that his ears had deceived
him, had not that agonized call for help still risen insistently
through the gloom. He searched the darkness, and suddenly a sight
greeted him by the roadside which caused his hair to stand up on
his head. At first this seemed nothing but a bundle lying half-in
and half-out of the ditch in the mud, with the drip-drip from the
trees making a slimy puddle around it. It was from this bundle that
the calls for help and the curses proceeded.</p>

<p>It was appalling, almost unbelievable, for there were the Chief
of Section in the rural division of the department of Seine et
Oise, Citizen Lauzet, and his friend from Paris whom Captain Raffet
knew as Citizen Chauvelin, a man who stood very high in the
estimation of the government, and they were lying in a muddy puddle
in the ditch like a pair of calves tied together for market. Raffet
might have disbelieved his eyes had it not been for the language
which Citizen Lauzet used all the while that the rope which bound
him was being cut by the corporal.</p>

<p>"Thank the Lord," Raffet exclaimed fervently, "that you are
safe."</p>

<p>"I'll have 'em flayed alive, the rascals," Lauzet exclaimed in a
voice rendered feeble and hoarse with much shouting, as well as
rage. "The guillotine is too mild a death for such miscreants. They
attacked me, Citizen Captain, would you believe it? Me! Chief of
Section in the rural <i>gendarmerie</i>. Have you ever heard of
such an outrage? They shouted at us from behind. My friend and I
were riding along quite slowly, and we had just turned into the
bridle-path from the road. We heard the cart and all the shouting,
but we thought that they were just a pack of drunken oafs returning
from market. So we paid them no heed, not even when anon we heard
that on the road the cart had drawn up and, chancing to glance back
at the moment, I saw these louts jumping helter-skelter out of the
cart. And the next moment they were on us, the lot of them. Ten or
a dozen of them they were, the rogues."</p>

<p>"The miserable scoundrels," Raffet exclaimed fervently.</p>

<p>"They dragged us out of our saddles," Lauzet continued, "they
beat us about the head..."</p>

<p>"Name of a name..."</p>

<p>"And all the while they kept on shouting, 'Traitor! Traitor!
Give up the English spy to us.' In vain did we try and protest.
They would not hear us, and what could we do against a dozen of
them? Then finally they bound us with ropes, wound our cravats
about our mouths so that we could scarcely breathe, and listed us
into that jolting cart, where we lay more dead than alive while it
was driven by a lout at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>"Have no fear, Citizen," Raffet put in forcefully. "Their
punishment shall be exemplary."</p>

<p>"I have no fear," Lauzet retorted dryly, "for I'll see to their
punishment myself. The scamps, the limbs of Satan! But I'll teach
them. There we lay, Citizen Captain, at the bottom of the cart, my
friend Citizen Chauvelin, who wore the tricolour scarf of office
round his middle, and I, chief commissary of the district, and
those ruffians dared to wipe their shoes on us. So we drove for a
kilometre and a half through the forest. Then presently the cart
drew up and all those louts jumped down like a pack of puppies and
ran away up the hill with shouts that would wake the dead. The last
I remember, for in the jolting and my cramped position I had partly
lost consciousness, was that my friend and I were lifted out of the
cart as unceremoniously as we had been thrust into it. We were
carried up the road some little way and then thrown into the ditch
by the roadside, in the mud, just where you ultimately found us,
and our cravats were loosened from round our mouths. Immediately we
started screaming for help, but there was such a din going on up
the road, that we felt the sound of our voices could not possibly
reach you. Fortunately, in the end, you did hear us, or maybe we
should have perished of cold and inanition."</p>

<p>"Malediction," Raffet swore viciously. "And you might have been
attacked by those cursed English spies while you lay helpless here.
We thought we heard them, and their battle-cry, and hurried to your
assistance."</p>

<p>He turned and shook his fist with another savage oath at the
gang of prisoners which had just come into view. Sobered and
chastened, they allowed themselves quite meekly to be dragged along
by a couple of soldiers. Some of them were able to walk, and were
made to do so with the aid of vigorous kicks if they flagged,
whilst the others, those who had sustained wounds or were otherwise
helpless, had been hoisted up, none too gently, on the shoulders of
their comrades in misfortune. Altogether, they looked a sorry lot.
Raffet smiled grimly at sight of them whilst Lauzet fell to cursing
and anathematizing them viciously.</p>

<p>Chauvelin alone showed no emotion. As soon as the rope that held
him had been severed, he had sat up on a broken tree-stump, staring
straight out before him into the mist, and meditatively stroking
his sore wrists and arms. It seemed as if some secret thought had
the power to keep his wrath and indignation in check. Nor did he as
much as glance up when the procession of soldiers and prisoners
came into view. Before his semi-consciousness there floated a vague
vision which he was striving to capture. When first those
abominable louts had thrust him and Lauzet in the bottom of the
cart, and he lay there bound and gagged, nursing his stupendous
wrath and hopes of revenge, he had become aware that the driver,
who still sat aloft just above him, had suddenly turned and,
leaning over, had peered into his face. It had only been a very
brief glance; the next moment the man was sitting up quite straight
again, and all that Chauvelin saw of him was his back, with the
great breadth of shoulders and general look of power and tenacity.
But it was the brief vision of that glance that Chauvelin now was
striving to re-capture. The blue-grey eyes with their heavy lids
that could not be disguised, and the mocking glance which had
seemed to him like rasping metal against his exacerbated nerves.
And suddenly he called to Raffet: "The driver and the cart, where
are they?"</p>

<p>The Captain's sharp eyes searched the mist that was rising in
the valley.</p>

<p>"Down at the bottom of the hill," he said. "The driver seems to
be on the box. I shall want him to drive these rascals back to
Mantes."</p>

<p>"Send him to me at once," Chauvelin broke in curtly.</p>

<p>Raffet gave the necessary orders, although inwardly he chafed at
this new delay. The prisoners slowly continued their way, and
Chauvelin waited, expectant. For what? He could not have told you.
He certainly did not expect to be brought face to face with his old
enemy. And yet But whatever vague hopes he might have entertained
were dissipated soon enough by an exclamation from Raffet.</p>

<p>"Charles-Marie! What in a dog's name are you doing here?"</p>

<p>And a weak, querulous voice rose in reply. "He told me I was to
run along and drive the cart back to Mantes for him. He..."</p>

<p>"He?" queried Raffet sharply. "Who?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Citizen Captain," replied Charles-Marie.</p>

<p>"Who ordered you to leave the diligence and your horses?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Citizen Captain," protested the unfortunate
Charles-Marie. "It's God's truth. I don't know."</p>

<p>"You must know why you're not sitting on the box of the
diligence."</p>

<p>"Yes. I know that, for I scrambled down as soon as I saw Gaspard
fall on you, Citizen Captain."</p>

<p>"Why did you scramble down?"</p>

<p>"Because the horses were restive. At the first pistol-shot they
started rearing and I had a mighty task to hold them. Fortunately,
someone came and gave me a hand with them."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'someone came'? Who was it?"</p>

<p>"He was a drover from Aincourt, Citizen Captain, and so he knew
all about horses, and how could I keep four terrified horses quiet,
all by myself?"</p>

<p>"You miserable fool."</p>

<p>"All very well, Citizen Captain, but I never was a fighting man,
and I don't like those pistol-shots all about me. One of them might
have caught me, I say, and it was only right I should find cover
somewhere, lest indeed I be hit by mistake."</p>

<p>"You abominable coward," Raffet rejoined savagely.</p>

<p>"But all that does not explain how you got here."</p>

<p>"Well, Citizen, it was like this. The drover from Aincourt saw
that I was not altogether happy, and he said to me, 'There'll be
more fighting presently when the English spies come to attack.' I
said nothing at first. All I could do was to groan for, as I say,
I'm not a fighting man. I went out of the Army because I was too
ill to fight, and my mother..."</p>

<p>"Never mind about your mother now. What happened after
that?"</p>

<p>"He said to me: 'You go and get on the seat of the cart which is
up the road. It is my cart. You can drive it back to Mantes and
leave it and my horses at the posting inn where they know me. I'll
look after these horses for you, and when the fighting's over I'll
drive the diligence to Paris. No one will be any the wiser and I
don't mind a bit of a fight. I can do a bit of fighting myself.'
Well," Charles-Marie went on dolefully, "there didn't seem much
harm in that. I could see he knew all about horses from the way he
handled them; but I'm no fighting man, and when I was engaged to
drive the diligence from Moisson to Paris, I was not told that
there would be any fighting."</p>

<p>"So you turned your back on the diligence, like a coward, and
crept along here..."</p>

<p>"I didn't creep, Citizen. I followed you when..."</p>

<p>"<i>Pardi</i>!" Raffet broke in with an oath. "Another of you
that will not escape punishment. If I had my way the guillotine
would be busy in Mantes for days to come."</p>

<p>There was nothing for it now but to allow Charles-Marie to drive
the cart back to Mantes, since its owner had probably seized an
opportunity by now of taking to his heels. Poor Raffet was worn out
with the excitement of the past half-hour, and bewildered with all
the mystery that confronted him at every turn. Vaguely he felt that
something sinister lurked behind this last incident recited to him
by Charles-Marie, but for the moment he did not connect it with the
possible manoeuvres of the English spies. He thought that chapter
of the day's book of adventures closed. It would be an
extraordinary piece of luck, indeed, if in the end they should
still come across the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>Anyway, for the moment, the most important thing was to see the
cartload of prisoners on its way, and to this Raffet devoted his
attention. He walked down as far as the cart, saw the prisoners
stowed in, Charles-Marie on the box with a trooper beside him to
see that he did his work properly, another in the cart to watch
over the prisoners, and a third to the horses' heads with a lighted
lantern. After that, what happened to the pack of miscreants Raffet
cared less than nothing; in the end they would not escape
punishment, whether they reached Mantes this night, or spent the
hours of darkness in the forest. They were securely bound now;
wounded of hale they lay huddled up in the cart, their spirit
broken, and with hardly a groan left in them. Raffet gave the order
to start. With much creaking and grinding the wheels ploughed their
way through the mud; it would take a couple of hours to cover the
three kilometres back as far as Mantes. Raffet stood for a moment
or two watching the veil of darkness which gradually engulfed the
cart, the horses and their human load. Just for a minute longer the
fitful glimmer of the lanthorn shone through the trees and for
awhile the voice of the man who carried it was heard encouraging
the horses or urging them on.</p>

<p>Then only did Raffet bethink himself of the citizen from Paris
who had given him the order to bring the driver of the cart to him.
Quickly he turned on his heel and walked up the road again. The
corporal and the troopers were there waiting for him, but Citizen
Lauzet and his friend from Paris had gone.</p>

<p class="cpb">9.</p>

<p>Indeed, Chauvelin had not waited to hear the whole of
Charles-Marie's tale. Throughout all the adventures which had
befallen him this day, he had seen the hand of his enemy, the
Scarlet Pimpernel. Now he no longer had any doubt. Almost at the
first words uttered by Charles-Marie he had jumped to his feet, all
the stiffness gone out of his bones; and despite the darkness, the
mud and the rain, he turned and ran up the slushy road, round the
bend beyond which he had heard the fight a quarter of an hour ago.
To Lauzet he had shouted a curt, "Come," and Lauzet had followed,
obedient, understanding, like a dog, only vaguely scenting danger
to himself, danger more serious than any that had threatened him
during this eventful day.</p>

<p>Chauvelin ran through the darkness with Lauzet at his heels. The
road appeared endless and black, the silence full of portent. Only
the drip from the trees broke the silence; only the leaden greyness
of the close of evening faintly pierced the darkness where the
trees grew sparse on the edge of the wood. Despite the cold and
rawness of the mist, he was in a bath of perspiration; though his
veins were on fire, his teeth chattered with the cold. Lauzet,
behind him, was panting like an apoplectic seal. The sticky mud
clung to the men's shoes; their limbs still stiff from hours of
confinement begrudged them every service. Soon Lauzet fell with a
groan by the roadside. But Chauvelin did not five in. Through the
darkness he had perceived things that moved; through the silence he
had heard sounds that spurred him to fresh effort. Stumbling,
half-dazed, he went round the bend of the road; then he, too, fell
exhausted by the roadside, exhausted and trembling as with ague.
The scene which greeted his aching eyes had finally unnerved him.
There, on the crest of the hill, he saw three horses tethered to
neighbouring trees, three soldiers with their hats pulled down over
their eyes. Of the diligence there was not a sign. Chauvelin stared
and stared at this scene. He had not strength enough to rise,
though his every nerve ached to go up to one of these pinioned
figures by the trees and to ask what had happened.</p>

<p>Thus Raffet found him five or ten minutes later. He came with
his soldiers and a lantern or two. On their way they had met with
Lauzet and had brought him along with them. Chauvelin could not do
more at first than point with trembling finger straight out before
him, and Raffet and the men swinging their lanterns came on the
spectacle of the three men and the three horses tied to the forest
trees, the animals calm as horses are wont to be when Nature and
men are silent around them; the men inert and half-conscious,
smothered under their own hats. Raffet and his troopers soon
released them, but it took them some time to recover their
breath.</p>

<p>"Question them, Citizen Captain," Chauvelin commanded
feebly.</p>

<p>The men's statements, however, were somewhat vague. It seems
that after their comrades had gone off, some with their Captain,
others with the prisoners, the three who were left behind busied
themselves at first with their horses, examining the saddle-girths
and so on, when one of them spied something moving underneath the
diligence.</p>

<p>"It was getting dark by that time," the man explained. "However,
I called to my mates, and we stooped to see what it was. We were
very much surprised, you may be sure, to see two pairs of feet in
ragged shoes. We seized hold of them and pulled. The feet were
attached to two pairs of legs in tattered stocking and breeches.
Finally there emerged from underneath the diligence two ragamuffins
with mud up to their eyes and their clothing in rags.</p>

<p>"We questioned them," the soldier went on to say, "and gathered
from them that they were just what they appeared to be, two young
jackanapes who had joined those other hotheads at Mantes where the
whole thing was planned, intending to have a little fun. Soon,
however, they got scared. Fearing the consequences of their
escapade, they had crawled under the diligence, hoping there to lie
<i>perdu</i> until they could comfortably take to their heels."</p>

<p>"They were a sorry-looking pair," another soldier put in. "We
put them down for two poltroons, not worth powder and shot, and
were just wondering what we should do with them when suddenly,
without the slightest warning, they turned on us like a couple of
demons. Not they only, for a third fellow seemed to have sprung out
of the earth behind us, and come to their aid. A giant he was."</p>

<p>"A giant," Raffet exclaimed, for he had suddenly remembered
Citizen Chauvelin's warning about the English spy, who was tall
above the average.</p>

<p>"Aye! A giant, with the strength of an ox. I can only speak for
myself, but all I know is that in an instant I felt an arm around
my throat like a band of steel and I was hurled to the ground with
a man on top of me. I was held down and bound with ropes, and my
cravat was thrust into my mouth so that I could not shout for help.
The next thing I remember was that I was lifted from the ground as
if I were a bundle of straw, and I was tied to yonder tree, and
finally my hat was pulled down over my eyes, my cravat wound round
my mouth so that I just could breathe and no more; and there I
remained until you, Citizen Captain, came and set me free."</p>

<p>The other two men had the same tale to tell. All three harked on
the giant whose size and strength they vowed were supernatural.</p>

<p>"He had eyes of flame, Citizen," one of them said.</p>

<p>"His hair emitted sparks as it stood up around his head,"
declared another.</p>

<p>"The devils," murmured Lauzet with a shudder.</p>

<p>"After them," exclaimed the enthusiastic young Captain. "We have
three horses, and that awkward diligence can't have got far."</p>

<p>"You haven't looked at the horses, have you, Citizen Raffet?"
Chauvelin remarked dryly.</p>

<p>"There's nothing wrong with them, is there?" Raffet retorted and
turned to look at the animals. The next moment a savage oath broke
from his lips.</p>

<p>"The saddles," he exclaimed. "They're gone."</p>

<p>"And the bridles too, I think," Chauvelin retorted slowly.
"Unless some of you are circus riders, I don't quite see what you
can do. But you did not suppose, Citizen Captain, that those
English devils would leave you the means of running after them, did
you?"</p>

<p>No one said anything for the moment. There was indeed, nothing
to say. Reproaches and vituperations would come later, punishment,
too, perhaps. The soldiers and their Captain hung their heads,
brooding and ashamed.</p>

<p>"They have a good start, curse 'em," Lauzet muttered
presently.</p>

<p>"What could we do against those limbs of Satan?" Raffet rejoined
glumly.</p>

<p>"You should have stayed, Citizen Captain, to guard the coach,"
Chauvelin retorted with a snarl.</p>

<p>"We heard you call for help, Citizen," Raffet protested glumly,
"and one man told us what a plight you were in. We thought you were
being attacked by the English spies&mdash;murdered perhaps. It was
our duty to come to your assistance."</p>

<p>Indeed it was a sense of fatality that had fallen over these
men; they felt numb, unable to think, hardly able to move.</p>

<p>"Epone is not more than four kilometres, Citizen," Raffet at
last ventured, "and we have the lanterns."</p>

<p>And so the procession started trudging down the incline in the
darkness and the rain, Chauvelin and Lauzet, Raffet and his
corporal with a couple of troopers carrying the lanterns. Two hours
later they reached Epone hungry, tired, spattered with mud up to
their chins. Nothing had been seen or heard of the diligence on the
way. At the posting inn the party found Raffet's courier waiting
for them. He had been perplexed at not finding anyone to whom he
could deliver the message, but whiled away the time of waiting in
the coffee-room, where mine host plied him with excellent wine
which had the effect of loosening his tongue.</p>

<p>He thought he was doing no harm by recounting at full length the
adventures that had befallen him and his comrades. Thus the story
was all over the district by the time the labourers of Epone had
gone to their work the following morning, and the Chief of Section
in the department of Sein et Oise, Citizen Lauzet, became the
laughing-stock of the countryside, together with his wonderful
friend from Paris. Late that same day, a horseless diligence which
at first appeared deserted and derelict was discovered half a dozen
kilometres to the north of the forest of Mézieres in the mud of the
stream that runs southward into the Seine. A group of labourers
going to their work were the first to see it. It had been dragged
into the stream and left axle-deep in the water behind a clump of
tall reeds. The labourers reported their find to a patrol of
Raffet's troopers whom he had sent out to scour the countryside.
The wheels had sunk deep into the mire, and it was only after a
great deal of exertion that labourers and soldiers together
succeeded in dragging the coach over the flat bank upon firm
land.</p>

<p>In the interior they found three saddles and bridles, and two
pairs of ragged shoes.</p>

<p>"Truly fate has been against us," Lauzet sighed dolefully when
he heard of the find. "Satan alone knows where the English spies
and the prisoners are at this hour."</p>

<p>"Well on their way to England," Chauvelin remarked. "I know 'em.
With their long purse and their impudence they'll work their way to
the coast, aided by fools and traitors. Such fools and traitors,"
he added under his breath, "as helped them last night in their
latest adventure."</p>

<p class="cpb">10.</p>

<p>Little Madeleine Deseze was very shy. She had been brought by
her father to pay her respects to Monseigneur le Prince de Galles,
because <i>maman</i> was too ill to accompany her.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness had the child beside him on the sofa, and was
questioning her about her adventures on that awful day when she and
<i>papa</i> and <i>maman</i> were being taken to Paris in the
diligence, and believed that they were destined to perish on the
guillotine.</p>

<p>"I don't remember much, Monseigneur," Madeline said shyly.
"<i>Maman</i> and I were too frightened to notice anything. There
was so much shouting and fighting. It was terrible."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you what happened, little one?" His Royal Highness
was pleased to say.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, steaming punch is served in the yellow
drawing-room," a pleasant voice interposed, with the assurance of
privilege.</p>

<p>"Fie, Sir Percy," exclaimed Lady Alicia Nugget, "would you spoil
His Highness's story?"</p>

<p>"Rather that than let good punch spoil with cooling, dear lady,"
Sir Percy retorted with a smile.</p>

<p>"Seize him and garrotte him," His Highness broke in with a
laugh, "as our gallant hero and his friends seized and garrotted a
Chief of Section, whatever that may be, and his powerful friend
from Paris."</p>

<p>"Seize him! Garrotte him," cried many a pair of
charmingly-rouged lips.</p>

<p>The next moment Sir Percy Blakeney, that prince of dandies, saw
himself fettered by a number of lovely arms, while gay voices
chirruping like birds cried: "The story, You Highness, we entreat.
He cannot interrupt now."</p>

<p>"I have the story from one who knows," His Highness resumed with
a smile, "and our little friend Madeleine shall hear it. It was
thus: Our gallant Scarlet Pimpernel, in one of his happiest
disguises as a drover from Aincourt, did with the aid of two of his
followers egg on a number of young louts into the belief that they
were being cheated out of the reward due to them for the capture of
the noted English adventurers in their district. Full of enthusiasm
and excellent wine they came on the Chief of Section who, I
imagine, answers to our Chief Constable of a County, together with
a gentleman from Paris who some of us have known in the past. Well,
the young louts, eager for the fray, and always egged on by the
drover from Aincourt, seized and garrotted those two worthy
gentlemen and, throwing them into the cart, took them along with
them. In the forest of Mézieres they came upon the diligence in
which were our little friend Madeleine and her parents. The vehicle
was ostensibly guarded by four troopers only, but our Scarlet
Pimpernel and his friends had already ascertained that as a matter
of fact there were half a dozen more men inside the coach, and that
all were armed to the teeth. Altogether too many for three men to
tackle; and since the chief motto of our band of heroes is never to
attempt where they cannot succeed, stratagem had here to come to
the aid of valour."</p>

<p>"And what did they do?" one of the ladies queried
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"The driver from Aincourt, our gallant Scarlet Pimpernel," His
Highness replied, "brought the cart to a standstill about a quarter
of a mile from the crest of the hill where the diligence had come
to a halt prepared for an attack. Then he allowed the louts to rush
the vehicle, and a general melée ensued. But he and his two
followers in the meanwhile lifted the Chief of Section and his
fiend out of the cart and carried them up the road to a point from
which their call for help would presently be heard. Here they left
them in the ditch, but carefully took the gags from their mouths.
Immediately the two worthy gentlemen started to shout. Nor could
they be blamed, for their plight was indeed pitiable. At first
there was so much din in the melée at the top of the hill that
their cries could not be heard. And in the meanwhile one of our
gallant heroes had crept up through the thicket to the crest of the
hill. Then presently the fighting ceased. The enthusiastic Captain
of <i>gendarmerie</i> heard the cries for help, accompanied by a
good deal of shouting and clash of metal carried on by the Scarlet
Pimpernel himself and his second follower. Now do you see what was
the result of this manoeuvre?"</p>

<p>"No! No!" the ladies exclaimed. And the men, no less
enthusiastic and interested cried: "Will your Highness
proceed?"</p>

<p>"The prisoners let out the secret that the Chief of Section and
his friend were lying bound with ropes in a ditch, whilst one of
our heroes-the one who had gone back to the scene of the fight and
mingled with the crowd&mdash;was able to put in a word that no
doubt those two great and worthy citizens were being attacked and
murdered by the English spies. The English spies! You have no
conception, ladies, what magic lies in those three words for every
soldier in the Republic. They mean hopes of promotion and of big
monetary reward. In an instant the enthusiastic Captain had called
to some of his men to follow him, to go to the rescue of their
Chief of Section, and incidentally to capture the Scarlet
Pimpernel. And that was the immediate outcome of the clever
stratagem. The Captain divided his forces. Three he took with him,
two were left to bring the prisoners along, another had been sent
as courier with a message. Three only were left to guard the
diligence. The gallant Scarlet Pimpernel had made a clever
calculation. Already by a small ruse he had rid himself of the
cart. Under cover of the darkness his two equally gallant followers
had crept underneath the vehicle, whilst he waited in the thicket
for the right time to strike. I leave you to guess the rest. The
three remaining soldiers taken unawares, the horses unsaddled, the
diligence finally driven down the hill by our hero, whilst inside
the coach his two followers were doing their best to assure little
Madeleine and her parents that all was well. Soon they abandoned
the cumbersome diligence and took to the road. That part of the
story is perhaps less exciting though no less heroic. The Scarlet
Pimpernel has nineteen followers; it was their task to be on the
road, to aid the fugitives with disguises, to help in the great
task of reaching the coach in safety.</p>

<p>"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the story," His Highness
concluded, rising. "Let us go and drink some of my friend
Blakeney's excellent punch. But after we have drunk our toast for
the King, let us raise our glasses to our national hero, the
Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>

<p>With a courtly bow and a smile he offered his arm to Marguerite
Blakeney who, with a glistening tear in her beautiful eyes, gave
His Highness a glance of gratitude.</p>

<p>"Are you coming, Blakeney?" the Prince said with a merry laugh.
"You must drink our toast, too, remember. To the gallant Scarlet
Pimpernel!"</p>

<p>All the ladies laughed, partly with gaiety, but also with
excitement. Then with one accord they cried: "Come and drink, Sir
Percy, to the gallant Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>

<p>"I'll come, dear ladies," Sir Percy said with a sigh, "since His
Highness commands, but you'll forgive me if I cannot drink to that
demmed, elusive shadow."</p>

<p>Laughing still, the ladies cried: "Fie, Sir Percy! Jealous
again?"</p>

<p>And little Madeleine, with her great childish gaze fixed upon
the handsome English gentleman, cried in her piping little voice:
"Fie, Sir Percy!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>TWO &mdash; THE PRINCIPAL
WITNESS</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Those who knew the widow Lesueur declared that she was quite
incapable of the villainous and spiteful action which landed poor
Joséphine Palmier in the dock for theft. This may or may not be so.
Citoyenne Lesueur had many friends, seeing that she was well-to-do
and in good odour with all the Committees and Sections that
tyrannized over humble folk in a manner which recalled the very
worst days of the old régime, to the distinct advantage of the
latter. Moreover, Achille Lesueur was a fine man, with a distinct
way with the women. He had a glossy black moustache and flashing
dark eyes, since he was a true son of the South, rather inclined to
be quarrelsome; and he had very decided views on politics, had
Achille. You should hear him singing the Carmagnole: "Ca ira! Ca
ira!" and "<i>Les aristos à la lanterne</i>!" He did it so lustily,
it verily sent a thrill all down your spine.</p>

<p>He was for destroying everything that pertained to the old
order: titles, of course, and private ownership of every sort and
kind, and the lives of all those who did not agree with him. Land
must belong to the nation, and all that grew on the land and was
produced under the earth or brought out of the sea. Everything must
belong to the people: that was Achille's creed. Houses and fields
and cattle and trees and women. Oh, above all, women! Women were
the property of the nation.</p>

<p>That was the grand new creed, which had lately been propounded
at Achille's Club&mdash;the Cordeliers. And everybody knows that
what the Cordeliers discuss to-day becomes law by decree of the
National Assembly the day after to-morrow.</p>

<p>Now, there were many who averred that Achille Lesueur became a
devotee of that creed only after Joséphine Palmier, his mother's
maid-of-all-work, disdained his amorous advances. Joséphine was
pretty and had the dainty appearance which, in these grand days of
perfect equality, proclaimed past sojourn in the house of a whilom
aristocrat&mdash;as a menial, probably. Bah! Achille, whenever he
tried to question Joséphine about the past and received no
satisfactory answer, would spit and leer; for he had a wholesome
contempt for all aristocrats and bourgeois and capitalists, and
people of all sorts who had more money than he&mdash;Achilles
Lesueur, the only son of his mother&mdash;happened to have at the
moment.</p>

<p>Did I mention the fact that the widow Lesueur was very
well-to-do, that she owned an excellent little business for the
sale of wines, both wholesale and retail, and that Achille's creed
that everything should belong to the people did not go to the
length of allowing, say, Hector and Alcibiade, to help themselves
to a stray bottle or so of the best Roussillon which happened to be
standing invitingly on his mother's counter?</p>

<p>How he explained this seeming discrepancy in his profession of
faith I do not pretend to say. Perhaps he did not consider it a
discrepancy, and drew a firm line between the ownership of the
people and the dishonesty of individuals. Be that as it may,
Achille Lesueur had made up his mind that he was in love with
Joséphine Palmier and that he would honour her by asking her to
become his wife.</p>

<p>She refused&mdash;refused categorically and firmly; gave as an
excuse that she could give him no love in return. No love, to
him&mdash;Achille&mdash;with the flashing eyes, the long maternal
purse, and the irresistible ways? It was unthinkable! The wench was
shy, ignorant, stupid, despite her airs and graces of an
out-at-elbows aristocrat. Achille persevered in his suit, enlisted
his mother's help, who indeed could not imagine how any girl in her
five senses could throw away such a splendid chance. Joséphine
Palmier had looked half-starved when first she applied for the
situation of maid-of-all-work in the widow Lesueur's house. She had
great purple rings under her eyes and hands almost transparently
thin; her lips looked pinched with cold, and her hair was lank and
lustreless.</p>

<p>Now she still looked pale and was not over-plump; but the
Citizeness Lesueur told all her neighbours that the wench had a
voracious appetite, very difficult to satisfy, and that in
accordance with the national decree, she was being treated as a
friend of the house.</p>

<p>And now this wanton ingratitude! Joséphine Palmier, a waif out
of the gutter, refusing the hand of Achille, his mother's only son,
in marriage!</p>

<p>Ah, ça! Was the baggage perchance an aristocrat in disguise? One
never knew these days! Half-starved aristocrats were glad enough to
share the bread of honest citizens in any capacity; and it was a
well-known fact that the ci-devant Comtesse d'Aurillac had been
cook to Citizen Louvet before she was sent as a traitor and a spy
to the guillotine.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Achille was persistent, and Joséphine obstinate. Citoyenne
<i>veuve</i> Lesueur, whilst watching the growth of her son's
passion, waxed exasperated.</p>

<p>Then the crisis came.</p>

<p>Achille's passion reached its climax, and the widow Lesueur's
anger no longer knew bounds. The baggage must go. Had anyone ever
seen such wanton wickedness? First to encourage Achille's
attentions&mdash;oh, yes! the whilom aristo had from the first made
eyes at the rich and handsome son of the house. Now, no doubt, she
had some traitor waiting for her somewhere, or even perhaps one of
those abominable English spies who literally infested Paris these
days, intriguing and suborning traitors and seducing the daughters
of honest patriots, so as to point with hypocritical finger
afterwards at the so-called immoral tendencies of this glorious
revolution. Oh, no! Citoyenne Lesueur did not mince matters.</p>

<p>"Take your rags and chattels with you, my wench, and go!"</p>

<p>And Joséphine, tearful, humiliated, anxious for the future of
<i>pauvre maman</i>, who was quietly starving in a garret whilst
her daughter earned a precarious livelihood for both as a household
drudge, put together her few tiny possessions&mdash;mere relics of
former happy times&mdash;and went out of the Citoyenne Lesueur's
inhospitable doors, followed by the latter's curses and
jeers&mdash;Achille having been got safely out of the way for the
occasion.</p>

<p>This had occurred in the late afternoon of the 6th
<i>Floréal</i>, which corresponds with the 25th day of April of
more ordinary calendars.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th, which was Saturday, Citoyenne Lesueur
came downstairs to the shop as usual, a little after six, took down
the shutters, and started to put the place tidy for the day's work;
when, chancing to look on the drawer which contained the takings of
the week, she saw at once that it had been tampered with, the lock
forced, the woodwork scratched.</p>

<p>With hands trembling with anxiety, the worthy widow fumbled for
her keys, found them, opened the drawer, and there was confronted
with the full evidence of her misfortune. Two hundred francs had
been abstracted from the till&mdash;oh! the <i>citoyenne</i> was
quite positive as to that, for she had tied that money up
separately with a piece of string and set it in a special corner of
the drawer. As for the baggage&mdash;eh! was not her guilt patent
to everyone?</p>

<p>To begin with, she had been dismissed for bad conduct the
evening before, turned out of the house for immoral ways, with
which Citoyenne Lesueur had only put up all this while out of pity
and because the girl was so poor and so friendless. Then there was
the testimony of Achille. He had returned from his Club at ten
o'clock that evening. He was positive as to the time, because the
clock of the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i> was striking the hour at the
very moment when he saw Joséphine Palmier outside his mother's
shop. She was wrapped in a dark cloak, and carried a bundle under
her arm. He&mdash;Achille&mdash;could not understand what the girl
might be doing there, out in the streets at that hour, for he knew
nothing of the quarrel between her and his mother.</p>

<p>He spoke to her, it seems, called her by name; but she did not
respond, and hurried by in the direction of the river. Achille was
very much puzzled at this incident, but the hour being so late he
did not think of waking his mother and telling her of this strange
<i>rencontre</i>, nor did he think of going into the shop to see if
everything was in order. What would you? One does not always think
of everything!</p>

<p>But there the matter stood, and the money was gone. And
Citoyenne <i>veuve</i> Lesueur called in the Chief Commissary of
the Section and gave her testimony, and attested as a patriot and a
citizen against Joséphine, known to her as Palmier. That this was
an assumed name, the worthy widow was now quite positive. That
Joséphine was nought but an aristo in disguise looked more and more
likely every moment.</p>

<p>The <i>citoyenne</i> recalled many an incident. Name of a name,
what a terrible affair! If only she had not been possessed of such
a commiserating heart, she would have turned the baggage out into
the street long ago.</p>

<p>But now, what further testimony did any Commissary want, who is
set at his post by the Committee of Public Safety for the
protection of the life and property of honest citizens and for the
punishment of bourgeois and <i>seigneur</i>&mdash;traitors
all&mdash;who are for ever intriguing against both?</p>

<p>As for Achille, he attested and deposed, fumed, raged, and
swore; would have struck the Citizen Commissary had he dared, when
the latter cast doubt upon his&mdash;Achille's&mdash;testimony;
suggested that the Club of the Cordeliers was known for its
generous libations, and that at that hour of the night any of its
members might be pardoned for not recognizing even a pretty wench
in the dark. And the Rue des Enfers was always a very dark street,
the Citizen Commissary concluded indulgently.</p>

<p>Achille was beside himself with rage. Imagine his word being
doubted! What was this glorious Revolution coming to, he desired to
know? In the end, he vowed that Joséphine Palmier was both a thief
and an aristocrat, but that he&mdash;Achille Lesueur, the most
soulful and selfless patriot the Republic had ever known&mdash;was
ready to exercise the rights conferred upon him by the recent
decree of the National Convention and take the wench for his wife;
whereupon she would automatically become his property, and, as the
property of the aforesaid soulful and selfless patriot, be no
longer amenable to the guillotine.</p>

<p>Achille had inherited that commiserating heart from his mother
apparently; and the Chief Commissary of the Section, himself a
humane and a just man, if somewhat weak, greatly approved of this
solution to his difficulties. Between ourselves, he did not believe
very firmly in Joséphine's guilt, but would not have dared to
dismiss her without sending her before the Tribunal lest this
indulgence on his part be construed into trafficking with
<i>seigneur</i>.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>All would then have been well, but that Joséphine Palmier, from
the depths of the prison where she had been incarcerated for three
days, absolutely refused to be a party to this accommodating
arrangement. She refused to be white-washed by the amorous hands of
Achille Lesueur, declared that she was innocent and the victim of
an abominable conspiracy hatched by mother and son in order to
inveigle her into a hated marriage.</p>

<p>Thus the matter became very serious. From a mere question of
theft, the charge had grown into one of false accusation, of
conspiracy against two well-known and highly respected citizens.
The Citizen Chief Commissary scratched his head in uttermost
perplexity. The trouble was that he did not believe that the
accusation <i>was</i> a false one. In his own mind, he was quite
certain that the widow and her precious son had adopted this
abominable means of bringing the recalcitrant girl to the arms of a
hated lover.</p>

<p>But, name of a name! what is a Commissary to do? Being a wise
man, Citizen Commissary Bourgoin referred the whole matter to a
higher authority: in other words, he sent the prisoner to be tried
by the Revolutionary Tribunal, the <i>Tribunal Extraordinaire</i>,
where five judges and a standing jury would pronounce whether
Joséphine Palmier was a traitor, an aristo, as well as a thief, and
one who has trafficked with English spies for the destruction of
the Republic.</p>

<p>And here the unfortunate girl is presently arraigned, charged
with a multiplicity of crimes, any one of which will inevitably
lead her to the guillotine.</p>

<p>Citizen Fouquier-Tinville, the Attorney-General, has the case in
hand. Citizen Dumas, the Judge-President, fixes the accused with
his pale, threatening eye. The narrow court is crowded to the
ceiling. Somehow, the affair has excited public interest, and
Achille Lesueur and his widowed mother, being well-to-do sellers of
good wine, have many friends.</p>

<p>Attorney-General Fouquier-Tinville has read the indictment. The
accused stands in the dock facing the five judges, with a set,
determined look on her face. She wears a plain grey frock with
long, narrow sleeves down to her pale, white hands, which
accentuate the slimness of her appearance. The white kerchief round
her shoulders and the cap which conceals her fair hair are
spotlessly clean. <i>Maman</i> has carefully washed and ironed them
herself and brought them to Joséphine in the prison, so that the
child should look neat before her judges.</p>

<p>"Accused, what answer do you give to the indictment?" the
Judge-President questions sternly.</p>

<p>"I am innocent," the girl replies firmly. "I was not in the Rue
des Enfers at the hour when yonder false witness declares that he
spoke with me."</p>

<p>Achille, who sits on a bench immediately below the jury, devours
the girl with his eyes. Every now and again he sighs, and his red,
spatulated hands are clasped compulsively together. At Joséphine's
last words, spoken in a tone of unutterable contempt, a crimson
flush spreads over his face, and his teeth&mdash;white and sharp as
those of some wild, feline creature&mdash;bury themselves in his
fleshy lower lip. His mother, who sits beside him, demure and
consequential in sober black with open-work mittens on her thin,
wrinkled hands, gives Achille a warning look and a
scarce-perceptible nudge. It were not wise to betray before these
judges feelings of which they might disapprove.</p>

<p>"I am innocent!" the girl insists. "I do not know why the
Citizeness Lesueur should try and fasten such an abominable crime
on me."</p>

<p>Here the Attorney-General takes her up sharply.</p>

<p>"The Citizeness Lesueur cannot be accused of trying to make you
out a thief, since her only son is prepared to make you his
wife."</p>

<p>"I would rather die accused of the vilest crimes known upon this
earth," she retorts firmly, "than wed a miserable liar and
informer!"</p>

<p>Achille utters a cry of rage not unlike that of a wild beast.
Again his mother has to restrain him. But the public is in sympathy
with him. Imagine that pitiful aristo scorning the love of so fine
a patriot!</p>

<p>The Attorney-General is waxing impatient.</p>

<p>"If you are innocent," he says tartly, "prove it. The
Revolutionary Committee of your Section has declared you to be a
Suspect, and ordered your arrest as such. The onus to prove your
innocence now rests with you."</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock on the night of the 6th <i>Floréal</i>, I was
with my mother," the girl insists calmly, "in the Rue
Christine&mdash;at the opposite end of the city to where the Rue
des Enfers is situated."</p>

<p>"Prove it," reiterates the Attorney-General imperturbably.</p>

<p>"My mother can testify&mdash;" the girl retorts.</p>

<p>But Citizen Fouquier-Tinville shrugs his shoulders.</p>

<p>"A mother is not a witness," he says curtly. "Mothers have been
known to condone their children's crimes. The law does not admit
the testimony of a mother, a father, a husband, or a wife. Was
anyone else at the Rue Christine that night&mdash;one who saw you,
and can swear that you could not possibly have been at the Rue des
Enfers at the hour to which the principal witness hath
attested?"</p>

<p>But this time the girl is dumb. Her sensitive lips are drawn
closely together, as if they would guard a secret which must remain
inviolate.</p>

<p>"Well?" the Attorney-General goes on with a sneer. "You do not
reply. Where is the witness who can testify that you were in the
Rue Christine, at the other end of Paris, at the hour when the
principal witness swears that he saw you in the Rue des
Enfers?"</p>

<p>Again the accused gives no reply. And now it is the turn of the
five judges to become insistent first, then impatient, and finally
very angry. Every one of them has, in turn, put the same
proposition to the accused:</p>

<p>"You say that the principal witness could not have seen you in
the Rue des Enfers at ten o'clock of the 6th <i>Floréal</i>,
because at that hour you were in the Rue Christine. Well, prove
it!"</p>

<p>And every one of them has received the same mute answer: an
obstinate silence, the sight o a face pale and drawn, and a glance
from large, purple-rimmed eyes that have a haunting, terrified look
in them now.</p>

<p>In the end, the Judge-President sums up the case and orders the
jury to "get themselves convinced." And this they must do by
deliberating and voting audibly in full hearing of the public; for
such is the law to-day.</p>

<p>For awhile thereupon, nothing is heard in the court save that
audible murmur from the stand where the jury are "getting
themselves convinced." The murmur itself is confused; only from
time to time a word, a broken phrase, penetrates to the ear of the
public or to that of the unfortunate girl who is awaiting her doom.
Such words as "obvious guilt", or "no doubt a traitor", "nought but
an aristo", "the guillotine", occur most frequently; especially
"the guillotine". It is such a simple solver of problems, such an
easy way to set all doubts at rest!</p>

<p>The accused stands in the dock facing the judges. She does not
glance in the direction of the jury. She seems like a statue
fashioned of alabaster, a ghost-like harmony in grey and white, her
kerchief scarce whiter than her cheeks.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there is a sensation. Through the hum of the jury
"debating audibly", a raucous voice is raised from out the body of
the public, immediately behind the dock.</p>

<p>"Name of a dog! Why, Cyrano lodges at No. 12, Rue Christine. He
was there on the evening of the 6th. Eh, Cyrano? <i>En avant</i>,
my ancient!"</p>

<p>"Cyrano, <i>en avant</i>!" The chorus is taken up by several men
in ragged shirts and blouses, to the accompaniment of ribald
laughter and one or two coarse jokes.</p>

<p>The jury cease their "audible deliberation". Remember that this
<i>Tribunal Extraordinaire</i> is subject to no law forms. Judges
and jury are here to administer justice as <i>they</i> understand
it, not as tradition&mdash;the hated traditions of the old
régime&mdash;had it in the past. They are here principally in order
to see that the Republic suffers no detriment through the actions
of her citizens; and there is no one to interfere with them as to
how they accomplish this laudable end.</p>

<p>This time, all of them being puzzled by the strangeness of the
affair&mdash;the singular dearth of witnesses in such a complicated
case&mdash;they listen to the voice of the public: <i>vox
populi</i> suits their purpose for the nonce.</p>

<p>So, at an order from the Judge-President, someone is hauled out
of the crowd, pushed forward into the witness-box, hustled and
bundled like a bale of goods: a great, hulking fellow with muscular
arms and lank, fair hair covered with grime. He is a cobbler by
trade, apparently, for he wears a leather apron and generally
exhales an odour of tanned leather. He has a huge nose, tip-tilted
and of a rosy-purple hue; a perpetual tiny drop of moisture hangs
on his left nostril, whilst another glistens unceasingly in his
right eye. His appearance in the witness-box is greeted by a round
of applause from his friends.</p>

<p>"Cyrano!" they shout gaily, and clap their hands. "<i>Vivat</i>,
Cyrano!"</p>

<p>He draws his hand slowly across his nose and smiles, a shy,
self-deprecating smile which sits quaintly on one so powerfully
built.</p>

<p>"They call me Cyrano, the comrades," he says in a gentle,
indulgent voice, addressing the Judge-President, "because of my
nose. It seems there was once a great citizen of France called
Cyrano, who had a very large nose, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," the Judge-President breaks in
impatiently. "Tell us what you know."</p>

<p>"I don't know much, Citizen," the man replies with a doleful
sigh. "The comrades, they will have their little game."</p>

<p>"What is your name, and where do you lodge?"</p>

<p>"My name is Georges Gradin, and I lodge at No. 12, Rue
Christine."</p>

<p>He fumbles with one hand inside his shirt, for he wears no coat,
and out of that mysterious receptacle he presently produces his
certificatory <i>Carte de Civisme</i>&mdash;his identity card,
what?&mdash;which the sergeant of the Revolutionary guard, who
stands beside the witness-box, snatches away from him and hands up
to the Judge-President.</p>

<p>Apparently the document is all in order, for the Judge returns
it to the witness; then demands curtly:</p>

<p>"You know the widow Palmier?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Citizen Judge," replies the witness. "She lives on the top
floor and my shop is down below. On the night of the 5th, I was in
the lodge of the Citizen Concierge at ten o'clock when someone rang
the front-door bell. The concierge pulled the communicating-cord
and a man came in and walked very quickly past the lodge on his way
to the back staircase; but not before I had seen his face and
recognized him as one who has frequently visited the widow
Palmier."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" queries the Judge-President.</p>

<p>"I don't know his name, Citizen Judge," Gradin replies slowly,
"but I know him for a cursed aristocrat, one who, if I and the
comrades had our way, would have been shorter by a head long
ago."</p>

<p>He still speaks in that same shy, self-deprecating way, and
there is no responsive glitter in his blue eyes as he voices this
cold-blooded, ferocious sentiment. The judges suddenly sit up
straight in their chairs, as if moved by a common spring. They had
not expected these ultra-revolutionary terrorist opinions from the
meek-looking cobbler with the watery eyes and the huge, damp nose.
But the Judge-President figuratively smacks his lips, as does also
Attorney-General Fouquier-Tinville. They have both already
recognized the type of man with whom they have to deal: one of your
ferocious felines, gentle in speech, timid in manner and
self-deprecating; but one who has sucked in bloodthirsty Marat's
theories of vengeance and of murder, by every pore of his grimy
skin, and hath remained more vengeful far than Danton, more
relentless than Robespierre.</p>

<p>"So the principal witness in this mysterious case is an aristo?"
the Judge-President puts in thoughtfully. "Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"That I do not know, Citizen Judge," Gradin replies in his meek,
simple way. "But I can find him," he adds, and solemnly wipes his
nose on his shirt-sleeve.</p>

<p>"How?" queries the Judge.</p>

<p>"That is my affair, Citizen," says Gradin imperturbably. "Mine,
and the comrades!" Then he turns to the body of the court, there
where in a compact mass of humanity a number of grimy faces are
seen, craned upwards in order to catch full sight of the man in the
witness-box. "Eh, comrades?" he says to them. "We can find the
aristo, what?"</p>

<p>There is a murmur of assent, and a reiteration of the ribald
joke of awhile ago. The Judge-President raps upon his desk with the
palm of his hand, demands silence peremptorily. When order is
restored, he turns once more to the witness.</p>

<p>"Your affair!" he says curtly. "Your affair! That is not enough.
The law cannot accept the word of all and sundry who may wish to
help in its administration, however well-intentioned they may be;
and it is the work of the Committee of Public Safety to find such
traitors and <i>seigneur</i> as are a danger to the State. You and
your comrades are not competent to deal with so serious a
matter."</p>

<p>"Not competent, Citizen Judge?" Georges Gradin queries meekly.
"Then I pray you look at the accused and see if we are not
competent to find the aristo whom she is trying to shield."</p>

<p>He gave a short, dry laugh, and pointed a long, stained finger
at the unfortunate girl in the dock. All eyes were immediately
turned to her. Indeed, it required no deep knowledge of psychology
to interpret accurately the look of horror and of genuine fear
which literally distorted Joséphine Palmier's pale, emaciated face.
And now, when she saw the eyes of the five judges fixed sternly
upon her, a hoarse cry escaped her trembling lips.</p>

<p>"It is false!" she cried, and clung to the bar of the dock with
both hands as if she were about to fall. "The man is lying! No one
came that evening to <i>maman's</i> lodgings. There was no one
there but <i>maman</i> and I."</p>

<p>"Give me and the comrades till to-morrow, Citizen Judge," Gradin
interposed meekly; "and we'll have the aristo here, to prove who it
is that is lying now."</p>

<p>The Moniteur, of the 10th <i>Floréal</i>, year 1, which gives a
detailed account of that memorable sitting of the Tribunal
Extraordinaire, tells us that after this episode there was a good
deal of confusion in the court. The jury, once more ordered by the
judges to deliberate and to vote audibly, decided that the
principal witness on behalf of the accused must appear before the
court on the morrow at three o'clock of the afternoon; failing
which, Joséphine Palmier would be convicted of perjury and
conspiracy directed against the persons of Citizeness <i>veuve</i>
Lesueur and her son Achille, a crime which entailed the death
sentence.</p>

<p>Gradin stepped down from the witness-box, a hero before the
public. He was soon surrounded by his friends and led away in
triumph.</p>

<p>As for Achille and his mother, they had listened to Georges
Gradin's evidence with derision rather than with wrath. No doubt
they felt that whichever way the affair turned new they would have
ample revenge for all the disdain they had suffered at the hands of
the unfortunate Joséphine.</p>

<p>The <i>Moniteur</i> concludes its account of the episode by the
bald statement that the accused was taken back to the cells in a
state of unconsciousness.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>The public was on tenterhooks about the whole affair. The latter
had the inestimable charm which pertains to the unusual. Here was
something new&mdash;something different to the usual tableau of the
bourgeois or the aristocrat arraigned for spying or malpractices
against the safety of the Republic; to the usual proud speech from
the accused, defying the judges who condemned; to the usual brief
indictment and swift sentence, followed by the daily spectacle of
the tumbril dragging a few more victims to the guillotine.</p>

<p>Here, there was mystery; a secret jealously guarded by the
accused, who apparently preferred to risk her neck rather than drag
some unknown individual&mdash;an aristo evidently, and her
lover&mdash;before the tribunal, even in the mere capacity of
witness.</p>

<p>And so the court is crowded on this second day of Joséphine's
trial, with working-men and shopmen, with women and some children.
A sight, what? This girl, half-aristocrat, half-maid-of-all-work!
And the handsome Achille&mdash;how will he take the whole affair?
He has been madly in love with the accused, so they say.</p>

<p>And will Cyrano produce the principal witness as he promised
that he would do? A fine fellow, that Cyrano, and hater of
<i>seigneur</i>! Name of a name, how he hated them!</p>

<p>The court is crowded; the judges waiting. The accused, more
composed than yesterday, stands in the dock, grasping the rail with
her thin, white hands, her whole slender body slightly bent
forward, as if in an attitude of tense expectancy.</p>

<p>Anon, Georges Gradin appears upon the scene, is greeted with
loud guffaws and calls of "Vivat, Cyrano!" He is pushed along,
jostled, bundled forward, till he finds himself once more in the
witness-box, confronting the Judge-President, who demands
sternly:</p>

<p>"The witness you promised to find&mdash;the
aristocrat&mdash;where is he?"</p>

<p>"Gone, Citizen Judge!" Gradin exclaims, and throws up his arms
with a gesture of desperation. "Gone; the canaillee scoundrel! The
traitor!"</p>

<p>"Gone? Name of a dog, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>It is Fouquier-Tinville who actually voices the question. But
the Judge-President has echoed it by bringing his heavy fist down
with a crash upon his desk. The other judges, too, have asked the
question by gesture, exclamation, every token of wrath. And the
same query has been re-echoed by a hundred throats, rendered dry
and raucous with excitement.</p>

<p>"Gone? Where? How? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>And Gradin, meek, ferocious, with great hairy hands clawing the
rail of the witness-box, explains.</p>

<p>"We scoured Paris all last night, the comrades and I," he
begins, in short, halting sentences. "We knew one or two places the
aristo was wont to haunt&mdash;the <i>Café de la Montagne</i>, the
Club Républicain, the Bibliothèque de la Nation. That is how we
meant to find him. We went in bands, two and three of us at a time.
We did not know where he lodged; but we knew we should find him at
one of those places&mdash;then we would tell him that his
sweetheart was in peril&mdash;we knew we could get him
here&mdash;But he has gone&mdash;gone; the scoundrel, the canaille!
They told us at the Club Républicain he had been gone five
days...got a forged passport through the agency of those abominable
English spies&mdash;the Scarlet Pimpernel, what? It was all
arranged the night of the 6th, when he went to the Rue Christine,
and the accused and her mother were to have joined him the next
day. But the accusation was launched by that time and the Palmiers,
mother and daughter, were detained in the city. But he has gone!
The thief! The coward!"</p>

<p>He turned to the crowd, amongst whom his friends were still
conspicuous, stretched out his long, hairy arm, and shook his fist
at an imaginary foe.</p>

<p>"But me and the comrades will be even with him yet! Aye, even!"
he reiterated, with that sleek and ferocious accent which had
gained him the confidence of the judges. "And in a manner that will
punish him worse than even the guillotine could have done. Eh,
comrades?"</p>

<p>The Judge-President shrugs his shoulders. The whole thing has
been a failure. The accused might just as well have been condemned
the day before and much trouble would have been saved.</p>

<p>Attorney-General Fouquier-Tinville alone rejoices. His
indictment of the accused would now stand in its pristine
simplicity: "Joséphine Palmier, accused of conspiring against the
property and good name of Citizeness Lesueur and her son." A crime
against the safety of the Republic. The death sentence to follow as
a natural sequence. Fouquier-Tinville cares nothing about a witness
who cannot be found. He is not sure that he ever believed in the
latter's existence, and hardly listens to Georges Gradin, still
muttering with sleek ferocity: "I'll be even with the aristo!"</p>

<p>The Judge-President, weary, impatient, murmurs mechanically:
"How?"</p>

<p>Georges Gradin thoughtfully wipes his nose, looks across at the
accused with a leer on his face, and a sickly smile upon his
lips.</p>

<p>"I'll marry the accused myself," he says, with a shy,
self-deprecating shrug of his broad shoulders. "I must be even with
the aristo."</p>

<p>Everyone looks at the accused. She appears ready to swoon.
Achille Lesueur has pushed his way forward from out the crowd at
the back.</p>

<p>"You fool!" he shouts, in a voice half-strangled with rage. "She
has refused to marry me!"</p>

<p>"The law takes no count of a woman's whim," Gradin rejoins
simply. "She is the property of the State. Is that not so,
comrades?"</p>

<p>He is fond of appealing to his friends: does so at every turn of
events; and they stand by him with moral support, which consists in
making a great deal of noise and in shouting "Vivat, Cyrano!" at
every opportunity. They are a rough-looking crowd, these comrades
of Gradin: mechanics, artisans, citizens with or without
employment, of the kind that are not safely tampered with these
days. They are the rulers of France.</p>

<p>Now they have ranged themselves against Achille Lesueur: call
him "bourgeois" to his face, and "capitalist".</p>

<p>"The aristo shall wed Gradin, not Achille! Vivat, Cyrano!" they
shout.</p>

<p>Georges Gradin is within his rights. By decree of the
Convention, a female aristocrat becomes the property of the State.
Is Joséphine Palmier an aristocrat?</p>

<p>"Yes!" asserts Gradin. "Her name is de Lamoignan. Her father was
a ci-devant&mdash;an aristo&mdash;of the worst type."</p>

<p>"If she marries anyone, she marries me!" asserts Achille.</p>

<p>"We'll see about that!" comes in quick response from Gradin. "A
moi, comrades!"</p>

<p>And before the judge or jury, or anyone there for that matter,
can recover from the sudden shock of surprise, Gradin, with three
strides of his long legs, is over the bar of the dock, in the dock
itself the next moment, and has seized Joséphine Palmier and thrown
her across his broad shoulders as if she were a bale of goods. To
clinch the bargain, he imprints a smacking kiss upon her cheek.
Josephine Palmier's head rolls almost inert upon her shoulders,
white and death-like save for the crimson glow on one side of her
face, there where her conquering captor has set his seal of
possession. Gradin gives a long, coarse laugh.</p>

<p>"She does not care for me, it seems," he says, in his usual
self-deprecating way. "But it will come."</p>

<p>The comrades laugh. "Vivat, Cyrano!" And they close in around
their friend, who once more, with one stride of his long limbs, is
over the bar of the dock, at the back of it this time, and is at
once surrounded by a yelling, gesticulating crowd.</p>

<p>There is indescribable confusion. Vainly does the
Attorney-General shout himself hoarse, vainly does the
Judge-President rap with a wooden mallet against his desk. Everyone
shouts, everyone gesticulates; most people laugh. Such a droll
fellow, that Cyrano, with his big nose! There he is, just by the
doorway now, still surrounded by "the comrades". But his huge frame
towers above the crowd, and across his broad shoulder, still slung
like a bale of goods, lies the unconscious body of Joséphine
Palmier.</p>

<p>In the doorway he turns. His glance sweeps over the court, above
the massed heads of the throng; and suddenly he flings something
white and weighty across the court. It lands on the desk of the
Judge-President. Then, using the inert body of the girl as a
battering-ram wherewith to forge himself a way through the fringe
of the crowd, he begins to move. His strength, his swiftness, above
all his authority, carry him through. In less than ten seconds he
has scattered the crowd and has gained ten paces on the foremost
amongst them. The five judges and the jury are left gasping; and
the Judge-President's trembling hands mechanically finger the
missile, whilst with every second the pseudo-Gradin has forged
ahead, striding with long limbs that know neither hesitation nor
slackness. He knows his way about this Palace of Justice as no one
else does probably in the whole of Paris. In and out of corridors,
through guarded doors and down winding stairs, he goes with an
easy, swinging stride, never breaking into a run. To those who
stare at him with astonishment or who try to stop him, he merely
shouts over his shoulder:</p>

<p>"A female aristocrat! The spoils of the nation! The
Judge-President has just given her to me. A fine wife, what?"</p>

<p>Some of them know Gradin the cobbler by sight. A ferocious
fellow with whom it is not safe to interfere; and name of a name,
what a patriot!</p>

<p>As for "the comrades", they have been merged with the crowd,
swallowed up, disappeared. Who shall recognize them amongst so
many?</p>

<p>Less than five minutes later, there is a coming and a going, and
a rushing; orders given; shouts and curses flying from end to end,
from court to corridor. The whole machinery of the executive of the
Committee of Public Safety is set in motion to find traces of a
giant cobbler, carrying a fainting aristocrat upon his
shoulders.</p>

<p>The Judge-President has at last mastered the contents of that
missile flung at him by the cobbler across the court. It consists
of a scrap of paper, scrawled over with a doggerel rhyme and a
signature drawn in red, representing a small, five-petalled flower
in shape like a Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>But of "Cyrano" there is not a trace, nor yet of half a dozen of
his "comrades" who had been so conspicuous in the court when first
he had snatched the aristocrat Joséphine Palmier from the dock.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>Maître Rochet, the distinguished advocate who emigrated to
England in the year 1793, has left some interesting memoirs,
wherein he gives an account of the last days which he spent in
Paris, when his fiancée, Mademoiselle Joséphine de Lamoignan,
driven by extreme poverty to do the roughest kitchen work for a
spiteful employer, was accused by the latter of petty theft, and
stood in the dock under the charge. He knew nothing of her plight,
for she had never told him that she had been driven to work under
an assumed name; until one evening he received the visit of a
magnificent English milord, whom he subsequently knew in England as
Sir Percy Blakeney.</p>

<p>In a few very brief words, Sir Percy told him the history of the
past two days and of the iniquitous accusation and trial which had
ended so fortunately for Mademoiselle de Lamoignan, and for her
mother. The two ladies were now quite safe under the protection of
a band of English gentlemen, who would see them safely across
France and thence to England.</p>

<p>Sir Percy had come to propose that Maître Rochet should
accompany them.</p>

<p>It was not until the distinguished advocate met his fiancée
again that he heard the full and detailed account of her sufferings
and of the heroism and audacity of the English adventurer who had
brought her and her mother safely through perils innumerable to the
happy haven of a home in England.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>THREE &mdash; THE STRANGER FROM
PARIS</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>What had happened was this:</p>

<p>On the night of the 16th <i>Nivôse</i> a band of those English
adventurers who were known throughout the country as the League of
the Scarlet Pimpernel had made an armed attack on the local
commissariat at Limours. They had presented pistols at the heads of
the police officers, had gagged and pinioned them, whilst the rest
of their gang had ransacked the commissariat, and duly found the
half-dozen <i>seigneur</i> who had been apprehended that very day
on a charge of counter-revolutionary sentiments openly expressed,
and were to have been transferred to Paris the next day for trial
and, presumably, summary condemnation and execution. They were
women for the most part, these <i>seigneur</i>, and there were a
couple of children amongst them. Anyway, those English spies got
clear away with them, vanished into the night after their coup,
like so many spooks carrying their living booty upon their
saddlebows.</p>

<p>How they ever managed to elude the night patrols on the main
roads, or, in fact, what became of them at all after their daring
raid, remained a baffling mystery. But the feelings of the
population of Limours were positively outraged by this impudent act
of aggression. Hitherto the Scarlet Pimpernel, well known in Paris
and in the great cities as the most virulent and most active enemy
of the Republic, the most able and most daring of the thousands of
English spies who infested the country, was at Limours nothing but
a name: that of a man endowed with supernatural attributes, in whom
only the superstitious and the ignorant believed; but, in truth,
just a legend which caused the sophisticated and wise to smile with
lofty incredulity.</p>

<p>"Let that elusive personage but show his face in Limours," those
wiseacres would say, "and we would very soon show him that we are
not so easily hoodwinked as all those clever people in Paris, or
Nantes, or Boulogne."</p>

<p>Thus the raid on the commissariat came as a veritable
thunderclap, scarce to be believed.</p>

<p>Citizen Campon, the chief commissary of police, sent urgent
messages to Paris: "What am I to do?" and "I am at my wit's ends,"
alternated with "In the name of&mdash;er&mdash;everything, send me
help." In fact, the poor man was in despair. He felt that
"suspension" was in the air and talk of "dereliction of duty."
Between this and a positive accusation of treason was but a very
short step these days. Heaven and a wayward fate alone knew when
the unfortunate commissary would be made to take it. Fortunately
for him, he happened to have a friend in Paris who had at one time
been a man of considerable influence on the Committee of Public
Safety. This man had of late somewhat fallen from this high estate,
but he was still credited with being on intimate terms with
Maximilien Robespierre and one or two of the more prominent orators
in the Convention. His name was Chauvelin, and it was to him that
Campon turned in his distress.</p>

<p>Citizen Chauvelin's advice (sent to his friend in Limours by
special courier) may be summarized thus:</p>

<p class="letter">My good friend:<br>
<br>
I know that cursed Scarlet Pimpernel and his ways to my cost. The
more impossible or perilous the adventure, the more certain is he
to embark upon it. Judging from his recent coup, he appears to have
confederates in Limours. At any rate, he is, I imagine, still in
touch with your township. My advice to you is this: secure a pack
of <i>seigneur</i>, the more innocent, the more pathetic, the
better, two or three women, young, if possible, a batch of
children. Give it out that you have them incarcerated in any house
or place you choose to name, and that you propose to send the whole
pack to Paris, or elsewhere, for trial on any given day. Then you
may take what precautions you choose and calmly await events. As
sure as I am sitting here writing this with mine own hand, as
certain as is my hatred for that abominable English intriguer, he
will make an attempt to get those <i>seigneur</i> out of your
clutches. Then 'tis for you to see that he fails, and that you
catch him in the attempt.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Citizen Chauvelin was not permitted to journey to
Limours in order to be of active assistance to his friend. Rumours
anent the activities of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel in
Paris itself necessitated his remaining in the city. Had he been
allowed to go...</p>

<p>But I am anticipating.</p>

<p>Suffice it is to say that the Committee of Public Safety,
realizing the need of the moment at Limours, as well as in Paris,
sent a sealed letter then and there to Citizen Campon, assuring him
that within the next four-and-twenty hours Citizen Mayet, one of
the ablest men known to the sectional committees for the tracking
down criminals and the detection of spies, would journey to Limours
in order to take in hand and carry through a plan for the capture
of the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Chief Commissary Campon was desired to act on
the advice given him by Citizen Chauvelin.</p>

<p>This Campon did, and after reflection decided on the arrest of a
woman named Mailly, widow of a late officer of the Royal Guard, of
her sister who had been abbess in a local, now derelict, convent,
and of her two children, Pauline, aged sixteen, and André, a lad of
eleven. A lovely lot, in truth, to serve as a bait for the
adventurous passion of the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>To these arrests Citizen Mayet, on his arrival two days later,
gave unqualified approval.</p>

<p>"A lovely lot," he agreed, "as you say. Where have you put
them?"</p>

<p>"I have them here in the commissariat," Campon replied, "and am
ready to make any arrangements which you might suggest."</p>

<p>"The commissariat," Mayet agreed, "will do very well for the
moment. Give it out as publicly as possible&mdash;but not
obtrusively, remember&mdash;that the prisoners will be transferred
to the tribunal of Chartres on any given day you choose to name.
This will give that cursed English spy time to make his plans,
whilst we, on the other hand, can make ours for the laying of him
by the heels."</p>

<p>And Citizen Mayet rubbed his huge, coarse hands complacently
together. He was a large, brawny, muscular fellow whose clenched
fist looked fit to fell on ox. He explained to Citizen Campon that
at one time he had been a butcher by trade, but that since the
severe shortage of meat he had found it more profitable to serve
one or other of the committees as a sleuth-hound and denouncer of
counter-revolutionaries. He was apparently of a very cheerful
disposition, for his loud guffaws and violent outbursts of
hilarity, mostly at his own jokes, would shake the walls of the old
commissariat to their very foundations.</p>

<p>Campon had at once conceived the greatest possible admiration
for the newcomer. He appeared so invariably cheerful, and so very
sure of himself, and withal so marvellously ferocious, like a huge
man-eating tiger&mdash;three qualities not one of which did the
poor commissary himself possess. He himself had always been
considered an able, cool-headed, reliable man. Born at Limours, he
and his family before him, who had kept the local cookshop for
three generations, were as well known in the district as the
proverbial town pump. But just now Citizen Campon was little else
than a bundle of nerves. He knew that his head, of which he was
both fond and proud, was at stake in this plan for the capture of
the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>In accordance with Mayet's orders it was at once given out quite
publicly that the prisoners, who were still confined in the
commissariat, would be transferred the very next day to the
tribunal at Chartres.</p>

<p>"No doubt," the jovial ex-butcher had declared with unruffled
cheerfulness, "the Scarlet Pimpernel has evolved some scheme by now
for wresting the <i>seigneur</i> out of our clutches, whether from
the commissariat or on the road to Chartres remains to be seen, but
the latter is the more probable."</p>

<p>The commissariat, an isolated building standing at an angle of
the principle street in Limours, was being guarded day and night,
but to make assurance doubly sure, Mayet had asked for, and
obtained, the assistance of half a company of the 61st Regiment,
which was stationed at Chartres, with a sergeant and two corporals.
These men were to furnish the escort for the journey between
Limours and Chartres, which was duly arranged to begin at ten
o'clock of the following day.</p>

<p>At that hour and on that day everything was ready for the start.
The <i>seigneur</i> were duly packed like so many cattle in an old
market cart to which a couple of heavy artillery horses were
harnessed, and on the front board of which sat one of the corporals
belonging to the 61st regiment would form the escort, whilst Chief
Commissary Campon had arranged to ride at the head of the
procession and Citizen Mayet, with two rough fellows whom he had
brought with him from Paris as aides-de-camp, would form the rear.
As this cavalcade formed outside the commissariat it looked in
truth very imposing. All Limours turned out to see the start.</p>

<p>The old clock in the church tower had not yet struck ten; the
morning was bitterly raw and frosty, and the men&mdash;ill clad and
ill shod as were most of the armies of the Republic&mdash;were
obviously grumbling at the cold.</p>

<p>Citizens Campon and Mayet were standing talking together outside
the commissariat waiting to give the order to start when a man was
suddenly seen running down the street from the direction of
Longjumeau at an immoderate speed, waving his arms and shouting as
he ran.</p>

<p>Soon his shouts became more coherent. He was calling for the
citizen commissary at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Citizen Commissary! Citizen Commissary! News! News!"</p>

<p>The next moment he was close on the scene, appeared gasping for
breath, and, despite the cold, was streaming with perspiration.</p>

<p>"I have run all the way from Bernix," he contrived to say in
answer to the chief commissary's peremptory query.</p>

<p>"Well?" broke in Campon eagerly.</p>

<p>"There's a gang of foreigners&mdash;English spies in very
truth&mdash;in hiding in the ruins of the château."</p>

<p>"Name of a name!" Campon ejaculated, and would have shouted
still more emphatically had not Mayet restrained him.</p>

<p>"Who is this man?" the latter demanded.</p>

<p>"Jean Mathis, the shepherd," Campon gave reply. "I have set a
number of these fellows to scour the neighbourhood for me for
traces of those English adventurers."</p>

<p>In a moment Mayet's jovial face had become grave.</p>

<p>"You should not have done that without consulting me. You have
them on the qui vive now, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," Campon interposed roughly. "We know
where they are."</p>

<p>"Then leave them there till they come out into the open."</p>

<p>"Not I," the other retorted decisively. "The château de Bernix
is not half a league away. I am going here and now, with a dozen
men, to capture my quarry whilst I know where I can lay my hands on
them."</p>

<p>"But the prisoners," Mayet protested.</p>

<p>"You stay behind and look after them. I'll leave a score of
soldiers to help you and half the population of Limours. You would
be a fool to let them slip away, more especially as I shall be
engaging the attention of our elusive friend, the Scarlet
Pimpernel."</p>

<p>Mayet vainly endeavoured to assert his authority.</p>

<p>"I was sent here in order to capture those English spies," he
said. "If you run counter to my orders you do so at your risk and
peril, Citizen Campon."</p>

<p>"If I let the opportunity slip by of capturing that Scarlet
Pimpernel, when I know where he is hiding, I should be contravening
my duty. Sergeant Torson," he added authoritatively, "you will
accompany me with a score of your men. The others remain here with
Corporal Vernay in charge under the orders of Citizen Mayet.
Understood? Then <i>en avant</i>!"</p>

<p>Mayet swore and threatened, but in the end had to give in.
Already a quarter of an hour had been lost in useless arguments.
Campon was in the saddle, and whilst Torson got his men ready the
chief commissary asked a few more pertinent questions of Jean
Mathis.</p>

<p>Were the foreigners in hiding at the château yesterday, or had
they, seemingly, only just come? Jean Mathis could not say exactly
when they had come. He had been near the ruins yesterday, and had
seen no one then. But this morning when he arrived, soon after six
o'clock, he at once perceived signs of life in and around the
derelict château. Subdued lights were moving to and fro; he had
heard whisperings and stealthy footfalls. How did he know that the
intruders were foreigners? Well, he had caught the words "Yes" and
"Damn!" both of which were English, and&mdash;well&mdash;because
one man came up to him and, seeing that he was on the watch,
offered him money to go away and to hold his tongue. He spoke
French, but like a foreigner. What had Jean done then? Why, taken
the money, of course, and then run like a good patriot to tell the
citizen commissary what he had seen. But not before he had noted
many things! (And here Jean Mathis thumped himself vigorously on
the chest in conscious pride at his own foresight and his own
patriotism.) He had noted that the gang of malefactors had much
luggage with them&mdash;bundles without number, and some cooking
utensils&mdash;and that six horses&mdash;yes, six horses&mdash;had
not Jean mentioned them before?&mdash;six horses were tethered in
that portion of the rained château that had once been the stables.
Oh! and Jean was nearly forgetting something. The money that the
foreigner had given him was wrapped in a piece of paper, and on
this paper there was something written which Jean, not knowing how
to read, could not, of course, decipher, but he had brought the
paper with him, and now produced it from the depth of a very hot
and very grimy hand. It was creased and soiled, the writing blurred
almost beyond recognition, but both Campon and Mayet pored over it,
trying to wrest, at any rate, a part of its secret from those grimy
folds.</p>

<p>It was Campon who in the end pointed a triumphant finger to the
last word of the mysterious writing. The rest he could not read,
because it was in a foreign tongue&mdash;English most
probably&mdash;but that one word stood clear and unmistakable:
whether you knew the language or whether you did not, there was the
word as clear as crystal: "Pimpernel."</p>

<p>"Now, Citizen Mayet," he said, his voice hoarse with excitement,
"do you still persist in calling me a fool for going to capture a
prey that is absolutely waiting to fall into my hand?"</p>

<p>After that, in truth, even Mayet appeared undecided. If Jean
Mathis had spoken the truth, then it were treason and worse to
allow the prey to escape. With their bundles and their cooking
utensils and their horses, those impudent English spies evidently
used the ruined château as their headquarters and relied on the
superstition of the neighbouring yokels to give the ghost-haunted
place a wide berth.</p>

<p>"Anyway," and these were Mayet's final words to the excited
chief commissary, "anyway, I will not make a start with the
prisoners until your return. I do not personally believe that you
will come across that gang of malefactors at Bernix, and I have no
wish to encounter them on the high road with only twenty men to aid
me in case of an attack. Whilst I am in Limours the population will
see to it that these accursed spies do not show their ugly faces in
this township. Eh, my friends?"</p>

<p>Whereupon those who had pressed forward sufficiently to catch
the citizen's words gave a loud cheer. Admittedly, they cared
nothing about Citizen Mayet, who was a stranger to them, sent down
from Paris, and therefore an object of suspicion and jealousy, and
they cared everything for Citizen Commissary Campon, who was one of
themselves, and whose mother still kept the local cook shop, as she
had done for the past thirty years. But these feelings of sympathy
and of antipathy were for the nonce merged in an intense and
comprehensive feeling of deadly hatred against that mysterious
Scarlet Pimpernel, whom rumour had represented to them as the
incarnation of evil, the worst enemy their country ever had, the
upholder of <i>seigneur</i> and the friend of traitors. So they
cheered Campon as he rode away with his escort of twenty stalwarts,
all well armed with good muskets and with pistols in their belts,
and they cheered Mayet, who remained behind to guard the
<i>seigneur</i> with another score equally stalwart and equally
well-equipped soldiers of the 61st Regiment; and when, a moment or
two later, a child in the crowd spied the <i>seigneur</i> who had
thrust pale, anxious faces out of the closely hooded market cart,
marvelling what new misery, what further indignity, was being
projected against them, there rose from the crowd such a mighty
hissing and booing as would have gladdened the heart of the most
bloodthirsty rhetorician in the Convention.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>Along the hard, frozen road which leads from Limours to Bernix,
Campon and his escort clattered on at a steady trot. On! On! Not a
man there but had it in his mind that the nation had promised a
reward of ten thousand francs to the first man who laid hands on
the Scarlet Pimpernel, and of a thousand to each man who had aided
in the capture of the abominable spy. So on! on! my stalwarts!
heedless of the biting frost, the keenest that has been known in
this part of France within memory of the oldest inhabitant;
heedless of the awful jar from the uneven road which even under the
trees was frozen to the consistency of corrugated iron. Jean Mathis
was riding on the pillion behind one of the men. He felt that the
glory of the expedition, if successful, would be entirely due to
his perspicacity, his courage, and his patriotism.</p>

<p>The road betwixt Limours and Bernix cuts straight across the
woods, leaving Longjumeau well on the left. On the edge of the wood
Campon cried a halt. Some two hundred metres farther on, the gray
ruins of the château, with the pale rays of the midday sun full
upon them, had suddenly come in sight. The house had been built
some ninety years ago by "Le Roi Soleil" for one of the ladies of
his choice: it had been the first to suffer at the outbreak of the
Revolution, as it was then still held by one of the lineal
descendants of that same lady who was mightily unpopular in the
neighbourhood. The château was burned and gutted, the trees of the
park cut down for fuel, its surrounding wall demolished, its forged
iron gateway melted down for cannon, and there the place had
remained since, derelict, lonely, reputed to be haunted by the
ghosts of dead aristocrats, but in reality the meeting place of
every gang of malefactors of the district&mdash;thieves, smugglers,
or spies&mdash;who found their safety in the superstitious awe of
the countryside.</p>

<p>Even Campon, advanced republican and free-thinker though he was,
could not repress a shudder when he first caught sight of the old
château looming before him through the broken-down gateway of the
park&mdash;silent, solitary, awesome. It seemed as if a hundred
hidden eyes were peeping out through the orifices, the broken
windows, the roofless attics of the derelict building.</p>

<p>A strange silence appeared to reign around, and though in the
woods which the men had just traversed the keen frosty air had been
very still, here in the outskirts of this abandoned park a weird,
soughing breeze moaned through the leafless twigs of broken and
torn trees and the lifeless foliage of evergreen shrubs.</p>

<p>So strange indeed was the silence that Campon felt a sudden
sinking of the heart at thought that mayhap his quarry had already
fled, or, worse still, that it was falling even now, into the hands
of his rival, Mayet.</p>

<p>He gave hurried orders to the men to remain well under cover in
the woods, whilst he dismounted, and, accompanied only by Jean
Mathis, crept forward cautiously on hands and knees through the
shrubberies and tall rough grass of the park, with a view of
ascertaining if indeed the gang of spies was still there or no.
But, indeed, the silence appeared all the more oppressive as the
two men drew nigh to the château itself. Neither here nor in the
park was there the faintest sign of life. Certainly the horses were
no longer in the stables, and not a footfall, not a quickly drawn
breath even, was perceptible to the straining ears of Citizen
Campon. Had the English gang decamped, or were they on the watch?
Again that awful feeling crept down the chief commissary's spine,
that awful feeling that numberless pairs of eyes were watching him
through the torn windows of the château.</p>

<p>After a rapid consultation with Jean Mathis it was decided that
the latter should go on alone as far as the château. The English
spies already knew him by sight; he was dressed in his shepherd's
blouse, his sheepskin and gaiters, just as he had been this morning
when one of the strangers had accosted him. They would, therefore,
have no suspicion of him.</p>

<p>Campon was conscious of an intense feeling of excitement, and
when he saw Mathis straighten out his long, lean back and start at
an easy, careless stride toward the château, he felt a positive
thrill shake his nerves, like the presage of something huge,
stupendous, the turning point of his whole career.</p>

<p>For a while he waited in agonized suspense. Jean Mathis had
quickly disappeared amidst the shrubberies. Just for a second or
two his sheepskin and the blue of his blouse appeared upon the
steps of the perron, then it seemed that he entered the château,
for he was lost to sight.</p>

<p>Campon made his way back to the shelter of the woods. His nerves
were terribly on edge. He could not get to horse, but paced up and
down the narrow clearing where the men and their mounts had found
satisfactory cover.</p>

<p>Half an hour went by. Campon was enduring the tortures of a lost
soul. He could not understand why Jean Mathis tarried, imagined
every kind of horror and the worst of disappointments. So unnerved
was he that after a while he sent one of the men all the way back
to Limours to beg Citizen Mayet on no account to relax vigilance,
or to make a start with the <i>seigneur</i> until he, Campon, had
returned from the expedition on which he was now engaged.</p>

<p>At the end of that half hour Campon's apprehension had turned to
genuine fear. Something must have happened to Mathis. He consulted
with Torson, the sergeant, who appeared sulky and unhelpful. It was
long past the dinner hour. The men were desperately hungry. There
was already talk amongst them of turning tail and returning to
their quarters at Chartres, and in these days of rampant democracy
and slackened discipline that threat would undoubtedly be put into
execution unless something was done. The men were ready enough for
a man-hunt, keen enough to capture the Scarlet Pimpernel if he was
about, but hours of inactivity in this biting cold weather had
ruffled their tempers, and they were on the verge of
insubordination.</p>

<p>Campon, realizing the danger, agreed with the sergeant that
there was only one thing to be done: make for the château at all
risks. The men were armed, and their rising temper could incite
them to make quick work of the spies. The brigands were in the
château, of that there could no longer be any doubt, since they had
apparently done away with that unfortunate Jean Mathis.</p>

<p>Far be it for me to say that there were any cowards among those
men. They were twenty all told, and ready enough for a scrap with
the English adventurers. The superstitious awe which had hold of
them in face of the silent, ghost-haunted château soon disappeared
when they were called to action. Silently they looked to their
pistols, and at a word from their sergeant they tethered their
horses to the most convenient trees, and the next moment were
picking their way carefully through the rough grass of the park,
which with its rank growth had long ago obliterated the last
vestiges of the garden paths.</p>

<p>Still not a sound from the château. Campon, who had the
sergeant, Torson, with him, was the first to reach the perron. The
men quickly followed suit, and soon, cocked pistol in hand, they
were all firing in through the broken doorway into the derelict
building.</p>

<p>The next moment a loud exclamation from Torson brought them all
to the stately door of one of the apartments on the ground floor.
Here an amazing sight met their gaze. The room which stretched out
before them, with broken ceiling, gutted window frames, and charred
walls, had obviously been once an imposing one. Right along the
centre of it now there was a long board, supported on trestles and
covered with a white cloth. On this board was spread a copious
collation&mdash;meats, bread, bottles of wine&mdash;everything
apparently prepared for a joyous feast. Of this Jean Mathis was
even now partaking freely. He sat at the farther end of the board,
a huge pasty before him, into which he still dived at intervals
with his knife. Beside him lay a couple of empty bottles on their
sides, and the flush upon Jean's cheeks, the vague look in his
eyes, the disorder of his hair, and the thickness of his speech
bore witness to the excellent reasons which had kept him inside the
ruined château for so long.</p>

<p>The men, in truth, gave only one look upon the unexpected scene;
the next moment they hurled themselves with a wild shout of joy,
helter-skelter into the room, tumbling over one another in their
eagerness to share in the delectable feast. Nor did their
sergeant's somewhat feeble protests against this lack of discipline
prevail. The men were half-perished with cold and hunger. They saw
the good things of this earth spread invitingly before them, and
would have been more than human had they as much as attempted to
resist the alluring temptation. A minute later a portentous silence
had fallen over the assembly; nothing, in truth, could be heard in
the vast and stately ruins save the clatter of knives and dishes,
and the delicious, mellifluous sound of wine gurgling out of
bottles. Torson, of course, was caught in the vortex. He was no
martyr to duty. Moreover, was there not a certain merit in
consuming this repast so lavishly laid out for the enemies of the
Republic?</p>

<p>As for Campon, he began by storming and swearing, then he
admonished and entreated, and, finally, when obviously he was
wasting his breath, he picked up a dish of pasty and a bottle of
wine, and, standing apart from the others, he leaned against one of
the deep window embrasures and in sullen silence began to eat.</p>

<p>A strange scene, forsooth, and a mysterious one; this repast
spread by unseen hands for guests who did not appear. In the
intervals of enjoying the pasty and putting down a mug or two of
excellent wine, the good Campon would feel an uncomfortable jarring
of his nerves, a sickly apprehension that all was not as it should
be.</p>

<p>What, in the meanwhile, was happening at Limours? What was Mayet
doing in the interval? Campon, beginning to feel replete, was
gazing thoughtfully through the window across the devastated park
when, with a loud oath, he turned, hastily put down empty dish and
mug, and ran incontinently out of the room. The men did no more
than look up lazily as he disappeared through the door, and his
hurried footsteps clanged weirdly on the broken flagstones of the
hall. They were, in truth, far too happy and comfortable to pay
heed to anything that might be going on outside. Some of them had
fallen into a delicious state of somnolence, others were singing
bibulous songs, others again, including Jean Mathis, had collapsed
upon the floor.</p>

<p>Campon took no notice of them; he was out of the building in
less than ten seconds and running across the park, where a man on
horseback, with another riding beside him, had but a moment ago
emerged out of the wood. The rider was urging on his horse with
spur and knees, and the beast, despite the cold and frost, was
covered with lather. At sight of Campon the rider drew rein and the
two men jumped out of the saddle. One of them was the soldier whom
Campon had sent back to Limours about an hour before with an urgent
message to Mayet.</p>

<p>"What is it?" the commissary queried sharply as soon as the men
had dismounted, his heart thumping furiously against his breast in
an agony of apprehension.</p>

<p>"I was to report from Citizen Mayet," the soldier replied, "that
all was well..."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" Campon ejaculated, remembering for the first time
for many years that God still presided over the destinies of
France, even though her sons had chosen to deny Him.</p>

<p>"But," the soldier went on rapidly, "he says that he cannot wait
much longer. He told me to explain to you that his force was quite
sufficient to convey the <i>seigneur</i> to Chartres, and that he
would certainly make a start in the early part of the
afternoon."</p>

<p>Campon made no reply. He was brooding over the news, marvelling
if it would be in his interest to let the whole matter drift as
Mayet had ordered it. Then he bethought himself of the man who had
ridden behind the soldier.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>The man appeared weary, scarce able to stand. At the
commissary's peremptory query, however, he drew a sealed letter
from the inner pocket of his tattered coat.</p>

<p>"Courier in the service of the Committee of Public Safety," he
said, laconically, and handed the letter to Campon. "I rode from
Paris this morning, with orders to deliver this to no one but the
Citizen Campon himself."</p>

<p>"I met the courier just outside Limours, on my way back here,"
the soldier went on to explain, whilst Campon, with an obviously
shaking hand, was breaking the seal of the letter. "He was asking
after the citizen commissary. I thought I could not do better than
bring him along with me..."</p>

<p>But the man got no further in his speech. He was, in truth, only
just in time to catch the commissary, who with a loud cry of horror
had tottered, and would undoubtedly have measured his length on the
ground but for the soldier's timely assistance.</p>

<p>"A horse!" he exclaimed, hoarsely, for indeed he felt that he
was choking. "I must to Limours at once."</p>

<p>And, without waiting for the man's help, he strode to where the
horses were tethered in the wood, champing and fretting their bits,
and, seizing the nearest one by the bridle, he made futile efforts
to free the animal, all in a vague, blundering manner which further
upset the poor brute and called forth an exclamation of contempt
from the two men.</p>

<p>After that the soldiers made the horse ready, and held the
stirrup for the quaking commissary.</p>

<p>"You get to horse, too, and at once," the latter commanded, "and
let the courier come, too."</p>

<p>The men murmured. They were dog-tired.</p>

<p>"Do as I say," Campon went on roughly. "It is a matter of life
and death, and the others are all lying besotted or dead drunk
inside the château."</p>

<p>"But what has happened, Citizen?" the soldier queried sullenly.
"Duty is duty, but..."</p>

<p>"There is no but about it," the commissary cried in a raucous
voice as he settled down into his saddle and gathered the reins in
his shaking hand. "This letter comes to me from Citizen Mayet."</p>

<p>"Citizen Mayet!" the soldier exclaimed, thinking that the
commissary had lost his head. "But the letter comes from
Paris..."</p>

<p>"Yes," Campon cried in response, "from Paris, where Citizen
Mayet, the real Citizen Mayet, still is at the present moment. He
warns me that that accursed English spy has been impersonating him
these few days past."</p>

<p>"Malediction!" the soldier ejaculated lustily.</p>

<p>"Aye, malediction!" Campon assented, whilst his whole body
thrilled in a veritable frenzy of excitement, "for it is a false
Mayet who came to Limours&mdash;a false Mayet who hath charge of
the prisoners&mdash;a false Mayet who will spirit them away right
under our very noses unless I get to Limours in time!"</p>

<p>"Then I am with you," the two men cried simultaneously, as they,
too, swung themselves into the saddle, leaving their own wearied
mounts to wander loosely and at will.</p>

<p>"But have no fear, Citizen Commissary," the soldier added, just
as his horse settled down into an easy trot. "There are twenty of
our regiment guarding the <i>seigneur</i>, and the whole population
of Limours is out to foil the tricks of that crafty Scarlet
Pimpernel."</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>Hope and despair alternately played havoc with the chief
commissary's nerves as he pushed along at breakneck speed, along
the road to Limours, closely followed by the two men. On the whole,
hope predominated. As the soldier had pertinently reminded him,
there were not only twenty of his loyal comrades, but half the
population of the little township on the spot to see that that
impudent English adventurer did not carry out one of his accursed
tricks.</p>

<p>At last the edge of the wood was reached. Limours was in sight.
Another ten minutes and the three riders had reached the first
isolated house of the city: another five, and the horses were
thundering down the long main street. Already Campon had seen that
unusual bustle reigned around the commissariat. Already he could
hear the clanking of metal, the snorts and pawing of the horses,
the creaking of saddles and harness, the words of command and the
shouts attendant upon a cavalcade on the move.</p>

<p>On, no! But a minute more and he had perceived the hood of the
market cart lumbering slowly up the street, to right and left of it
the tricolour cockades on the caps of the soldiers catching the
pale gray light of the wintry sun: and ahead, in front of the cart,
the huge figure of the false Mayet, mounted on a white charger,
appeared to Campon's excited gaze like the very incarnation of the
devil. And all around, the crowd of worthy citizens of Limours,
booing the <i>seigneur</i> and cheering to the echoes the impudent
and audacious trickster who was even then leading them by the
nose.</p>

<p>Right into the very midst of the crowd Campon rode, scattering
affrighted men, women, and children all around him. Then suddenly
he brought his horse to a standstill.</p>

<p>"Halt!" he cried in a stentorian voice.</p>

<p>At first only the crowd heard him, gazed on him open-mouthed and
terrified, for truly the face of the chief commissary was livid
with fury. But on ahead the cavalcade went coolly on its way. In
fact, that fiend incarnate upon the white charger had just given
the order to trot.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried Campon again. "In the name of the Republic,
halt!"</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers heard him, turned in their saddles to see
what was the matter. Campon caught the eye of the corporal in
charge, and once again cried: "Halt! In the name of the Republic,
at your peril, Corporal Vernay, I command you to halt!"</p>

<p>Then that impudent English spy turned in his saddle, too, caught
sight of Campon shouting and gesticulating in the midst of the
crowd; but all that he did was to swear loudly.</p>

<p>"Name of a dog, that fool Campon is trying to interfere again!
<i>En avant</i>!" he cried to the soldiers, "or we'll not make
Chartres before nightfall."</p>

<p>But the corporal and the men had instinctively pulled up at the
commissary's peremptory calls of "Halt!" After all, they knew him.
He was the local commissary. The stranger from Paris was, in truth,
nothing to them. So they halted: and the market cart, after
lumbering on for a while in splendid isolation, came also to a
halt, whilst the stranger from Paris stormed and swore that they
would all suffer for this insubordination. The crowd, in the
meanwhile, was swarming everywhere&mdash;round the market cart,
round the soldiers, and, above all, round Campon, who had begun to
tell them of the impudent trick that the man on the white charger
had very nearly played them. In quick, jerky, but pithy sentences
he told them just what had happened: the arrival of the stranger
with the letters of credentials from the Committee of Public
Safety, the stranger who pretended to be Citizen Mayet, the servant
of the Republic, and who was none other than that accursed and
famous English adventurer, the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>At first the man on the white charger did not seem to understand
what Campon was saying, then a look went over his face as if he
though the chief commissary was nothing but a raving maniac.
Finally, when after a few seconds the purport of Campon's oratory
reached his senses, he swore the loudest and most comprehensive
oath that had ever shaken the little township to its very
foundations; after which he broke into a loud and immoderate roar
of laughter.</p>

<p>But that outburst of hilarity soon died in his throat. The
crowd, too, had suddenly realized the full, horrible reality. With
a wild shout, men and women, aye, even the children, literally
hurled themselves upon the man who had thought to play them such an
abominable trick. He swore and he shouted, plunged his spurs into
his horse's flanks till the beast reared and struck out with its
fore-hoofs, scattering momentarily the angry, yelling crowd. But
only momentarily. The next they had returned to the charge, headed
and egged on by Campon, whom shame at being fooled and latent
horror of what might have been so hideous a catastrophe had turned
into a raging and vindictive madman. The soldiers whose duty it was
to protect the abominable malefactor, in order to save him from the
guillotine, did what they could to keep the crowd at bay. But even
so the object of their fury was torn from his white charger, rolled
on the ground, kicked, maltreated, spat upon like the abominable
spy that he was.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, even the wild ravings of an angry crowd are
bound to subside. In this case, after twenty minutes of the maddest
orgy of rage and of hate some of the soldiers had succeeded in
forming a guard around the prostrate form of the stranger from
Paris and of his quivering, excited, snorting charger, whilst
others gradually pushed the foremost of the crowd back from the
object of their wrath and their vindictiveness. The temper of the
people was slowly cooling down. Pushed back by the soldiers, they
formed into knots, still talking, volubly and with much animated
gesture, of the past exciting events. The chief commissary was
urging them all to go home. He even collected his scattered wits
sufficiently to order the removal of the <i>seigneur</i> back to
the commissariat, as it would now be too late to convey them to
Chartres this day.</p>

<p>Ah! when the true Citizen Mayet, the noted and trusted servant
of the Committee of Public Safety, did eventually arrive in Limours
he would find that his task had already been ably accomplished by a
proud chief commissary of police, conscious of his own worth and of
valuable services rendered to the state!</p>

<p>Even whilst Citizen Campon, saddle-sore but happy, was able to
dismount, meaning to take a few hours' rest in his mother's cook
shop over the way, a loud exclamation followed by a vigorous curse
quickly dispelled his short dream of bliss.</p>

<p>"The cart!" Corporal Vernay had exclaimed, and the soldiers near
him had cried excitedly: "And the <i>seigneur</i>! They have
gone!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" shouted one man.</p>

<p>But the impossible was a fact indeed! The market cart, with its
occupants, had vanished&mdash;spirited away even whilst the crowd,
the soldiers, the commissary had their whole attention fixed upon
the object of their rage. The market cart had gone! When? Whither?
Who could tell? Not the two soldiers who had sat on the front
board, for they were presently discovered some fifty paces round
the curve of the road, with arms and legs securely tied together
with cords, so that they could not move, and woollen scarves wound
around their mouths. When these were removed they were able to
explain that when the disturbance was at its height and their own
attention entirely concentrated on the lively spectacle which they
were watching by standing on the front board and looking over the
hood of the cart, they were suddenly seized by the legs, thrown
down, gagged, and bound, then carried to this spot before they
could even utter a scream. No one paid any heed to them, and they
actually saw the cart driven away at breakneck speed in the
direction of Versailles.</p>

<p>To Campon this tale, when it was reported to him, was like a
fall of icy water down his spine. For a moment he could neither see
nor hear, he could not even think, and the expression of his face
was so terrible that those nearest him fell back appalled. Quite
mechanically, and like one moving in a dream, he went up the street
to where half-a-dozen soldiers were guarding the prostrate body of
the stranger from Paris. The latter, bruised, bleeding, aching in
limb, in pride, and in temper, was only partially conscious, but
sufficiently so to glare with bunged-up eyes, redolent of hatred
and contempt, on the unfortunate chief commissary, and to murmur in
a choked and throaty voice: "You dolt! You fool! You ass! You
traitor! You shall pay me for this!"</p>

<p>Then only did Citizen Campon understand that the man who lay
there before him, bruised and sore, spouting vengeance through
purple and thick lips, was indeed the true Citizen Mayet after all,
and that the whole tragic episode from beginning to end&mdash;the
strangers at the ruined château, the money and paper purposely give
to Jean Mathis so as to lure him, Campon and some of the soldiers
away from the scene of the proposed coup, the feast spread out in
the château in order to entice those soldiers to indiscipline and
render them momentarily helpless, the courier (obviously a false
one, bearing a forged letter from Paris, and whom now Campon vainly
sought amongst the crowd)&mdash;all, all had been part of the
gigantic hoax invented and perpetrated by that abominable spy, the
Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>In a lonely cottage the other side of Versailles, hidden from
the road and secure from prying eyes, the little party halted. It
was, in truth, their first halt since the exciting moment when
three men, who seemed but a part of that awful, yelling crowd at
Limours, had boarded the market cart, overpowered its drivers, and
driven it away under the very noses of chief commissary and
sergeant, of soldiers and citizens, who were all far too blind with
excitement to see anything but the object of their wrath.</p>

<p>Madame Mailly, with her sister and two children, were vainly
trying to find words wherewith to express their gratitude to the
brave English gentlemen who had saved them from certain death. One
of these, who appeared to be the leader, and who looked magnificent
even in the rough and shabby clothes of a proletary of Limours,
said to her with a smile:</p>

<p>"I pray you do not thank any of us, dear lady. My friends will
tell you, as I do, that we spent in Limours to-day one of the most
enjoyable afternoons of our checkered careers. The only thing I
regret is that I must be in Paris this night, else it were my
greatest joy to go and watch the first tête-à-tête meeting between
our friends Campon and Mayet. What say you, Tony?" he added,
turning to one of his friends. "You were such an efficient courier.
When you handed the forged letter to Campon this morning and he
really thought that good old Mayet was none other than the Scarlet
Pimpernel, what did he say? His language was forcible, was it
not?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to what Mayet's must have been later on when the fun
was raging around him," the other assented, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Nothing," the leader said, with his irrepressible gaiety, "to
what their language is now, when they realize that Madame Mailly
and her family are safely out of their hands. En route, madame,
mademoiselle," he concluded, "we hope to let you see the white
cliffs of England before many days are past."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>FOUR &mdash; "FLY-BY-NIGHT"</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>They were so enthusiastic! so eager! Perhaps the secrecy and the
excitement of it all appealed more to them than the actual ideals
which they advocated. For they were all young men of the
professional classes and of the lower bourgeoisie: men who, you
would have thought, would have nothing to gain by political
intrigue or the reëstablishment of the old monarchy, and who were
risking their lives to overthrow a system that had not, in very
truth, much interfered with the even tenor of their lives.</p>

<p>They held their meetings in the cellar of an old house at the
bottom of the Rue de l'Odéon, which was decorated with a white flat
that bore the emblem of the royal fleur-de-lys on it in gold, and
was hung on the wall immediately behind the seat usually occupied
by the chairman. Here the young hotheads would talk politics
o'nights and swear allegiance to King Louis XVII, by the grace of
God King of France: the poor mite who had been dispossessed of all
save his precarious little life, and that too was at the mercy of
the inhuman brutes who held him captive. An old wastrel, Servan by
name, kept watch at the street door during the sittings and tidied
up the place afterward. Strangely enough, no one knew much about
Servan. He came and he went. Now and then he disappeared for days
on end, when, at his earnest request, sittings would be suspended
until his return. Servan was invaluable for ferreting out the plans
of the committee of the section; invaluable in his position as
watch-dog-in-chief of the Club des Fils du Royaume.</p>

<p>It was one night while Servan was absent that the inevitable
catastrophe occurred. He had begged that the sittings of the club
should be postponed for a few days. But the next day happened to be
the 14th of October, and on that morning had begun the trial of
Marie Antoinette&mdash;erstwhile Queen of France, now called the
Widow Capet&mdash;before the Revolutionary Tribunal, at the bar of
Fouquier-Tinville, the public prosecutor. What could Les Fils du
Royaume do but call a hurried meeting to discuss this portentous
event?</p>

<p>Old Servan's warning was forgotten, and at eleven o'clock that
same night eighteen or twenty young enthusiasts met to formulate
plans for the liberation of their queen.</p>

<p>An hour later the blow had fallen. The ominous command: "Open in
the name of the Republic!" came loudly and peremptorily from
outside. "The police! Sauve qui peut!" in hurried, hoarse whispers
from within. They were trapped like so many rats in a burrow. There
was nothing for it but to make a fight for one's life first and
make a rush for the open, if possible, when darkness might be of
service.</p>

<p>But the revolutionaries were armed with bayonets, and the issue
was never for a moment in doubt. The Sons of the Kingdom fought
bravely and there were several broken heads among the guard. In the
end, some fifteen of the young conspirators were overpowered.
Bleeding from several wounds, they were tied together like so much
cattle, with cords, and marched up the narrow dank stairs into the
street, where the raiding party handed them over to a fresh body of
soldiers. They were taken to the chief depôt of the section, whilst
five others lay dead upon the floor of the cellar in the Rue de
l'Odéon. The chief commissary of the section ordered the bodies to
be left there.</p>

<p>"The garbage can be cleared away another time," he remarked
spitefully.</p>

<p>Two days later the bodies were removed, but there were only four
of them then. And on looking through his list of prisoners and
comparing it with that of the dead, the chief commissary found that
one name was missing from both. It was that of Félicien Lézennes,
chairman of the Club des Fils du Royaume.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>The news of the raid on the Club des Files du Royaume came as a
thunderbolt upon the little household at Mon Abris. Little was
known at first save the meagre announcement which appeared the
following day in the <i>Moniteur</i>. Madame St. Luc, however, was
at once filled with the gloomiest forebodings as to her
son-in-law's fate. Adrienne Lézennes, always self-contained, didn't
say much, but her father appeared distinctly resentful as well as
anxious. The plight into which Félicien's hot-headedness had landed
them all had a grating effect upon his nerves.</p>

<p>They might all of them have been so happy in their little
home&mdash;a detached, creeper-clad house, standing in an hectare
of ground in the Batignolles quarter of Paris, not far from the
Porte d'Asnières&mdash;had it not been for Félicien's mania for
running his head into a noose. Monsieur St. Luc himself had been a
well-to-do attorney in his time, had retired at the outbreak of the
Revolution, for he was a firm upholder of the monarchic system; but
what was the use of airing one's views on so great a subject, when
the guillotine loomed so large on the horizon of every bourgeois's
life these days?</p>

<p>"That fool Félicien!" so his father-in-law invariably dubbed
him. More so now than ever, since he had become a fugitive, hiding
God alone knew where, starving probably. For five days after the
raid his family did not know what had become of him. Adrienne
haunted the purlieus of the prisons, trying to get some information
as to her husband's fate, but she could glean none. Then, on the
fifth day, when despair had well nigh seized her, there came a
message written in Félicien's own hand, assuring them all that he
was safe and under the protection of a brave English milord, who
had picked him up half-dead after the raid and brought him, at risk
of his life, to a place of safety just outside Paris. How that note
came to the house it was impossible to say. Marthe, the serving
wench, found the scrap of paper lying on the mat in the small lobby
when she came down in the morning. It had been pushed in under the
door, and Marthe had hardly dared to touch it at first; it looked
so weird and ghostlike, she said.</p>

<p>The note also contained an earnest warning that, the house being
certainly now under observation by the spies of the Committee of
Public Safety, the utmost discretion and circumspection were
imperative; but that mother and father and Adrienne, and also
Marthe, had best make quietly ready to leave Paris at an hour's
notice. In the meanwhile, however, Félicien adjured them all not to
be anxious, and on no account to make any move until they heard
from him again. The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel&mdash;a
magnificent English organization&mdash;had the welfare of the
household in hand. All would be well if they would only act on
instructions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Monsieur St. Luc, accustomed as he had been all
his life to direct and regulate the affairs of his family, refused
on so solemn an occasion to be dictated to by his son-in-law (that
fool Félicien!). By his orders a few necessary effects were at once
hastily put together. The whole family, he decided, had best leave
Pariws that very day. He himself would see to passports. He had
friends in several administrations who would help to get his family
away, and they would all go to St.-Aubin by the Sea, where he owned
a little house property, and where they could live in retirement
until this cloud had blown over.</p>

<p>While the women packed St. Luc went to the local commissariat to
see about the passports. His request was flatly refused. The
Committee of Public Safety, so the chief commissary of the section
told him, had an eye on Mon Abris. This sudden desire on the part
of the household to leave Paris would certainly cause all their
names to be placed upon the list of the "Suspect"; which meant that
a domiciliary visit, a perquisition, and consequent arrest on some
kind of trumped-up charge could now be considered imminent.</p>

<p>Monsieur St. Luc, by his obstinacy, had precipitated the crisis
and hopelessly endangered his own life and that of all those he
cared for. The situation, from being tense, had suddenly become
tragic. There was nothing for it now but to act on Félicien's
original advice, praying God in the meanwhile that this wiser
course had not been taken too late.</p>

<p>Soon after Monsieur St. Luc's return from his unsuccessful
errand another message came, exactly similar to the previous
one&mdash;a scrap of paper pushed mysteriously under the door and
found by Marthe in the little lobby on the mat. But the writing
this time was a strange one, and it bore no signature, only a small
device in the left-hand corner, drawn in red, and representing a
small five-petalled flower, in shape like a Scarlet Pimpernel. The
message warned Monsieur St. Luc that a domiciliary visit at Mon
Abris could be expected at about four o'clock; that the arrest of
the entire household, on suspicion of conspiracy, had already been
decided. The usual travesty of justice would inevitably follow,
with condemnation, and probably the guillotine in the end. The
message, however, went on to assure Monsieur St. Luc that measures
were being taken for the immediate flight of himself and his
household out of Paris, but that their very lives now depended on
implicit obedience. The writer of this warning would himself be at
Mon Abris within the hour, to give them final instructions.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>The family had assembled in the little boudoir which gave on the
left of the hall. The two old people were sitting, one on each side
of the hearth. Between them, Adrienne Lézennes, kneeling in front
of the fire, had the drawer of her husband's desk beside her. This
she had filled with all his papers that she could find, and was
systematically putting them, packet by packet, into the flames.</p>

<p>"Above all, Adrienne," Madame St. Luc insisted earnestly, "burn
anything you can find that looks as if it related to the English
milord. It would be an eternal shame on us all if those brutes came
on his track while he is working for our salvation."</p>

<p>"Milord is too clever to allow a pack of loons to catch him,"
Monsieur St. Luc riposted dryly. "But, in any case, Adrienne had
best destroy every scrap of paper that Félicien was fool enough to
leave about for our undoing."</p>

<p>Neither his wife nor his daughter made further comment on the
matter, and for a while no sound disturbed the quietude of the
cosy-looking room, save the hissing of the flames licking the loose
bundles of papers, and the monotonous ticking of the old clock
standing against the wall.</p>

<p>"I wish they would come," Madame St. Luc said presently. "It
will be best when it is all over."</p>

<p>"They won't be here for another hour at least," Adrienne
rejoined. "And we don't know how bad the worse may be," she added
under her breath.</p>

<p>"I wish milord were here," Madame sighed plaintively.</p>

<p>An hour later a detachment of the revolutionary guard, belonging
to the Sectional Committee of Public Safety, had assembled in the
garden in front of Mon Abris. There were a dozen or more of them,
dressed in the usual haphazard attire which, in these days of
penury and of prolonged war, did duty for military uniform: ragged
breeches, odd coats that more often than not hung loosely upon
thin, narrow shoulders; feet thrust bare into sabots or any old
boots that might have been picked up in the course of a foraging
expedition. The men were under the command of a big, burly ruffian
known as Citizen Captain Courtain, who was standing before the
front door, vociferating lustily the habitual "Open, in the name of
the Republic!" And since he did not obtain the prompt answer to his
summons which he required, he proceeded to kick against the door
with the point of his boot.</p>

<p>"Hé là!" he shouted at the top of his voice. "Open there, I say!
Do not waste the time of the loyal servants of the Republic, or
you'll have your doors and windows presently smashed about your
heads."</p>

<p>He was about to put his sturdy shoulder to the door when it was
opened from within. Marthe, neatly dressed and prim, trying to look
brave at sight of those awful soldiers whom every peace-loving
citizen had learned to dread, stood by, while the men filed through
into the square hall in the wake of their captain. The latter then
turned to the wench and demanded curtly:</p>

<p>"The Citizen St. Luc, his wife, and daughter&mdash;where are
they?"</p>

<p>"In the boudoir, Citizen Captain," the girl replied quite
readily. She appeared self-possessed and spoke as if she were
repeating a lesson. The captain gave her a quick, searching
look.</p>

<p>"How many of you live in the house?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Four of us altogether. The Citizen St. Luc, with his wife and
their daughter, Adrienne Lézennes. I do the service of the
house."</p>

<p>"And what does Félicien Lézennes, the husband of Adrienne, do?"
the captain broke in abruptly.</p>

<p>This time the girl did not answer so glibly. There was an
instant's hesitation of her voice&mdash;the mere fraction of a
second, imperceptible no doubt to the bullying rascallion before
here&mdash;ere she gave reply.</p>

<p>"Félicien Lézennes," she said quite steadily after awhile, "has
been gone for some days. You know that well enough, Citizen
Captain."</p>

<p>"I know nothing," he retorted, "save that this house stinks of
<i>seigneur</i>, and that an accursed English spy, who goes by the
name of the Scarlet Pimpernel, is suspected of having been in and
out of here."</p>

<p>The wench shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I know nothing about English spies," she riposted dryly.
"Methinks you, Citizen Captain, have been led by the nose."</p>

<p>"We'll soon see about that," was the captain's curt rejoinder.
"Now," he added peremptorily, "which is the room you call the
boudoir?"</p>

<p>Marthe led the way to a door on the left of the hall and opened
it without knocking.</p>

<p>"This way, Citizen Captain," she said simply, and was in the act
of standing aside in order to let the soldiers file into the room,
when she quickly put her hand up to her mouth as if to smother a
sudden, involuntary cry.</p>

<p>In an instant, Courtain had her by the arm.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he queried roughly.</p>

<p>"The mutton stew!" she exclaimed glibly. "I have left it on the
fire. It will burn for sure!"</p>

<p>She made as if to run out of the room, but Courtain held her
tight.</p>

<p>"You stay here, Citizeness," he commanded. "Pierre Dumont there
will see to your stew. His mother was an excellent cook and taught
him all she knew."</p>

<p>He nodded to one of his men, who laughed and shrugged his
shoulders, then went out of the room.</p>

<p>"Let go my arm, Citizen Captain," the girl said, apparently
reassured as to the fate of her stew. "You are hurting me."</p>

<p>The incident was closed. Captain Courtain gave a comprehensive,
searching look around. The two ladies had made no movement when
first he had entered the room. The older one sat quite still in the
high-backed armchair by the hearth, the younger one, on a low
tabouret by her side, was busy with some sewing. Monsieur St. Luc
rose to receive the soldiers of the Republic.</p>

<p>"Your name?" Courtain queried roughly.</p>

<p>"Adrien St. Luc, attorney-at-law," the old man replied with much
dignity.</p>

<p>"Félicien Lézennes, where is he?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Citizen Captain. We none of us have seen him
this past week and more."</p>

<p>"You lie!" Courtain retorted. "He is a fugitive from justice.
Where should he find shelter but with his relatives?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing of Félicien Lézennes's movements," Monsieur St.
Luc reiterated firmly.</p>

<p>"Well for you if you do not! Give me your keys," the captain
commanded.</p>

<p>"Nothing is locked," St. Luc replied. "We have nothing to
hide."</p>

<p>Whereupon Courtain with a shrug of the shoulders turned to his
men.</p>

<p>"You have heard me question the aristo," he said. "He denies
everything. Now, there's a strong suspicion that a cursed traitor
is in hiding in this house, as well as that abominable English spy
who should have been hung on a lanthorn post long ago. Therefore,
comrades, leave not a single piece of furniture in its place of a
single door or drawer unopened. The house must be searched through
and through; and there are outhouses and stables, too, in the
ground. Understand?"</p>

<p>The men were ready enough to obey. There was a reward of forty
sous for every man who brought an escaped suspect to justice; and
there had been rumours of some English spies being about. Good
reward was promised for their capture, too, whilst for the
apprehension of the mysterious leader who was known as the Scarlet
Pimpernel, a man might earn as much as ten thousand francs.</p>

<p>Courtain himself remained behind after his comrades had gone. He
had apparently set himself the task of searching the boudoir and
interrogating the inmates of the house.</p>

<p>"I always mistrust the place where women congregate," he had
said in his own picturesque language, ere his men dispersed about
the premises.</p>

<p>Indeed, no one understood that type of work better than did
Captain Courtain. Not a cranny escaped his vigilant eye, not a nook
where an aristo might lie concealed or compromising papers be
stowed away. After he had been in the boudoir half an hour there
was not one unbroken piece of furniture there. The upholstered
chairs had been ripped and the carpets torn up from the floor; he
had put his heel through every drawer of the desk, and his fist
through every bit of panelling. He had even, in places, torn the
paper from the walls.</p>

<p>The three women watched him, fascinated and motionless. Not a
word of protest escaped them when they saw some of their most
precious treasures ruthlessly destroyed. Monsieur St. Luc made no
protest either. He had resumed his seat, was staring moodily before
him, and replied in curt monosyllables whenever Courtain put a
question to him. Anon the latter threw himself upon the sofa, which
his rough handling had reduced to mere wreckage, and gave vent to
his disappointment by a comprehensive curse. Then he curtly ordered
Marthe to get him some wine. The girl turned to her master, asking
for the key.</p>

<p>"I thought you said that nothing was locked in this house,"
Courtain remarked with a sneer. He was on his feet again in a
moment, and turned to St. Luc. "Give me the cellar key," he
commanded.</p>

<p>"It is at your service," St. Luc replied.</p>

<p>He took a key from his pocket and held it out to Courtain. "You
are free to walk in, Citizen Captain," he said simply.</p>

<p>But Courtain would not take the key.</p>

<p>"Not without you, my friend," he riposted. "Do you take me for a
nincompoop, ready to fall into a booby-trap? Allons!" he added
roughly. "Marche!"</p>

<p>St. Luc obeyed without another word, walked out of the room in
front of Courtain, who took the precaution of turning the key in
the lock of the boudoir door behind him.</p>

<p>"We don't want our birds to fly away in our absence, eh?" he
remarked with a leer.</p>

<p>The whole house appeared alive with noise: shouts and laughter,
smashing of woodwork, and tramping of heavy feet. In the centre of
the hall one of the men was brandishing a crowbar, whilst three or
four others were apparently egging him on to some doughty deed.</p>

<p>"What is that crowbar for?" Courtain queried curtly.</p>

<p>"The cellar door, Citizen Captain," one of the men replied. "We
have searched every nook and corner of the house except the cellar,
which is locked. The door has a deal of resistance in it. We
thought this crowbar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Throw it down, comrades," Courtain broke in jovially. "Citizen
St. Luc will do the honours of his cellar for us in person."</p>

<p>There was no need to reiterate this order. In a moment the
crowbar was thrown down and the little procession was formed, with
St. Luc leading the way and Courtain treading hard on his heels.
The citizen captain had quietly taken a pistol out of his breeches
pocket.</p>

<p>"In case something happens that I don't like!" he remarked
casually to St. Luc. "And remember that some of my men, if not all,
have loaded pistols, too."</p>

<p>But St. Luc appeared quite placid, gave but a cursory glance at
the pistol. He led the way across the hall, then down a flight of
stairs which was faced at the bottom by a heavy oak door. St. Luc
inserted the key in the lock and flung the door open.</p>

<p>"This is the cellar," he said curtly.</p>

<p>"Well!" riposted Courtain with affected jollity. "Go in, and
we'll follow."</p>

<p>St. Luc, still placidly, led the way in. The cellar was vast and
well ordered, with casks ranged around and an array of bottles and
jars filled with the delicacies beloved of the French bourgeoisie.
It derived some light from a small grated window set high in the
wall. There were some empty wooden casks standing about, and a row
of pewter mugs hung on hooks along the edge of a shelf.</p>

<p>"Quite cosy and inviting in here, eh, comrades?" Courtain
remarked jauntily.</p>

<p>The soldiers were not long in getting to work. They helped
themselves to the mugs, and one of them volunteered to draw the
wine, as he had been a butler in an <i>aristo's</i> house in
pre-Revolution days. Soon each had a mugful of wine in his hand;
one of them started to sing, the others joined in. The merry sound
attracted their comrades, who were still busy in other parts of the
house. They came helter-skelter, running down the stone staircase,
and presently the vast cellar was filled with a merry-making
throng, in the midst of which St. Luc's majestic figure in sober
black, with stiff white stock and tie and iron-gray hair falling
modishly down to his shoulders, had lost nothing of the dignity and
sang-froid of the well-to-do attorney.</p>

<p>"You do not drink, Citizen St. Luc?" courtain asked him
good-humouredly. Then, as the other made no reply, he added with
stern significance: "If you are trying some hidden game, my friend,
by making my men drunk, you will do yourself no good and aggravate
your own case and that of the women upstairs. Drunk or sober, we
stay in the house until we've found your precious son-in-law or
that confounded Englishman, or both; and I may as well tell you
that I have another eight or ten men outside in your garden. So
even if these men do get drunk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If they get drunk," broke in St. Luc impatiently, "they'll
never rid me of that confounded Englishman or my daughter or that
ne'er-do-well husband of hers."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>The shrill ejaculation had burst involuntarily from Courtain. He
literally gave a jump as well as a gasp of astonishment at this
wholly unexpected retort, and spilled a quarter of a litre of
precious wine in the act. "What did you say?"</p>

<p>"I said that I wished to be rid of that confounded Englishman, a
regular Fly-by-Night, who has led us into all this trouble," St.
Luc rejoined, and a malicious, spiteful glitter lit up for a moment
the even pallor of his face. "As for that fool
Lézennes&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He paused and pressed his lips together, as if fearing to say
too much.</p>

<p>Courtain gave a prolonged whistle.</p>

<p>"Oho!" he said, "so that's the way the wind blows, is it? Why
did you not speak of this before?"</p>

<p>"How could I," retorted St. Luc sullenly, "in the presence of my
daughter?"</p>

<p>"Then," Courtain went on significantly, "you are willing
to&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He looked St. Luc straight in the eyes, and the latter nodded in
response.</p>

<p>"Where are they?" the other continued. Then, as the old attorney
was about to reply, Courtain suddenly gripped his arm and dragged
him to a corner of the cellar where they could talk without fear of
being overheard. He had just remembered that a reward of ten
thousand francs was due to the man who captured the Scarlet
Pimpernel. "Where are they?" he reiterated eagerly, dropping his
voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>But St. Luc's manner had already undergone a change. That
strange, malicious glitter had died out of his eyes. He looked
sheepish and ashamed.</p>

<p>"I-I don't know," he stammered, "just where they are...If the
men kept sober the could..."</p>

<p>"None of that!" retorted Courtain roughly. "You have gone too
far now, Citizen, to draw back without risking your neck. Where are
they?" he reiterated for the third time, and gripped St. Luc so
fiercely by the arm that the older man could scarce keep back a cry
of pain. "Well, are you going to speak, or shall I have you and
your womankind placed under arrest until you do?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" said St. Luc weakly. "I'll tell you. I meant to tell
you, only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only what?"</p>

<p>"The Englishman is very powerful. He is not easily captured.
Many have tried and all have failed, remember. And my son-in-law,
too, is young and vigorous."</p>

<p>"So much the better," retorted Courtain. "It will be the greater
glory for me. Are they in the house?"</p>

<p>"No," replied St. Luc.</p>

<p>"Where then?"</p>

<p>"Not very far from here. Through the barrier. The empty house at
the junction of the Rue du Bois. You know it, Citizen Captain? It
used to belong to Lézennes's aunt and uncle&mdash;<i>seigneur</i>
who have had to fly the country."</p>

<p>"No, I don't know the house. Is it Clinchy way?" Courtain
asked.</p>

<p>"More on the Levallois-Perret side. You can't miss it. Go
straight up the Route d'Asnières and take the third turning on the
left; then go on till you come to a forked road, when you want to
bear to your right. You'll see a white gate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that!" Courtain broke in impatiently. "You had
best come and show us the way."</p>

<p>"No, no!" St. Luc protested, and his voice had a note of
plaintive entreaty in it now. "I couldn't face Lézennes or the
Englishman! It would kill me! And my daughter! My wife! They would
know...Oh, my God!" he added, and covered his face with his hands
as if in abject shame.</p>

<p>The situation seemed vastly to amuse Courtain.</p>

<p>"Many people like to say 'A.'," he remarked dryly, "but don't
care to say 'B.' Well, I'll be a good dog, Citizen. The traitors
shan't see you. You'll put us on our way, then I'll leave you in
charge of two of my men, who will bring you back while we go search
the place."</p>

<p>St. Luc still appeared to hesitated, but only for a moment.
Obviously, as Courtain had tersely put it, he had gone too far now
to draw back. Nor did the captain take any notice of his scruples.
There were ten thousand francs waiting for him at the end of a more
or less hazardous expedition, and he had plenty of stalwart fellows
under his command. He was not likely to abandon so splendid a
chance for reward and advancement. But he took the opportunity
before starting of having St. Luc thoroughly searched for any
weapons he might have concealed about his person.</p>

<p>"I am taking no risks," he said dryly, when the old attorney
tried to protest.</p>

<p>Satisfied on that point, he quickly organized the expedition,
turned the men out of the cellar, and locked the door behind them,
putting the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Do not relax your vigilance for one instant, Citizen Lavérie,"
he said to the soldier whom he was leaving in command of the party.
"The women are, of course, safe under lock and key in the boudoir.
See that no one has access to them. I am taking the men with me
whom I left on guard outside the house. They have no had the
opportunity of visiting the cellar," continued Courtain dryly, "and
I shall find them more reliable. St. Luc is coming with us part of
the way, but I'll send him back here presently under escort, and
then you had better lock him up with the women in the boudoir. Any
further orders I may have to give you I will send through the men
who will bring St. Luc along. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, Citizen Captain," Lavérie replied.</p>

<p>After which Courtain went to muster the men whom he desired to
accompany him to the empty house at Levallois-Perret. As he had
remarked to Lavérie, they were men who had not tasted St. Luc's
wines as yet. Besides taking on risks, he was leaving nothing to
chance. He had heard tales of the marvellous prowess of that
English spy who, from all accounts, was a kind of legendary
athlete, endowed with supernatural cunning and strength. Well, this
time he would have to reckon with Citizen Captain Courtain: a man
whom nothing could daunt and whose courage was equal to his
perspicacity.</p>

<p>His escort, too, looked fit and keen. It was then close on seven
o'clock. The sun was slowly sinking down in the west behind a
canopy of heavy clouds. Courtain placed himself at the head of his
squad and ordered St. Luc to march by his side.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour's brisk walk brought them to the Porte
d'Asnières. The gates were closed for the night, but Courtain and
his escort, besides being well known to the officer in command, had
all the necessary passes, and the party was let through without any
hindrance.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterward, at the top of the Route d'Asnières and
its junction with the Rue du Bois, where the roads fork, St. Luc
came to a halt.</p>

<p>"There is the house," he said, and pointed up the road to where
a small building gleamed white in the midst of a clump of old and
twisted acacia trees. But, despite his protestations, Courtain
would not release him.</p>

<p>"You are coming a bit further along with us, my man," he said
curtly. "I told you I was taking no risks."</p>

<p>It was only when they came to a low, broken-down fence which
appeared to mark the boundary of the grounds around the house that
Courtain finally detailed two of his men to remain on guard over
St. Luc.</p>

<p>"Wait for me here," he commanded. "If you hear any fracas inside
the house, come to my assistance."</p>

<p>"But the aristo&mdash;" suggested one of the men, nodding toward
St. Luc.</p>

<p>"In case of trouble," retorted Courtain curtly, "stab him in the
legs with your bayonets. Then he can't run far."</p>

<p>He found a rickety gate in the fence and, followed by his
escort, proceeded to march up to the house. It lay a hundred
mètres, or perhaps less, farther on. The ground around it had no
doubt once been a garden; it was now nothing but a mass of
overgrown shrubs and a wilderness of nettles. Courtain and his men
could be seen for a time ploughing their way through the weeds.
Anon they reached the house. The captain's voice of command rang
out through the fast-gathering dusk. No answer came from within.
The house appeared indeed deserted. Courtain then pushed open the
door, which yielded quite easily, and he and his men disappeared
inside the house.</p>

<p>Those who had remained on guard over St. Luc settled down for a
long wait, sat down on the sloping ground with their backs against
the fence, taking care to keep the aristo between them and their
bayonets close to their hands.</p>

<p>How it all happened they could not afterward have said. The
attack came from behind the fence, they thought, and began with a
stunning blow on their heads. Before they could recover from the
violence of this assault, thick scarves were wound round their
faces; they felt smothered, blinded, unable to call for help. Both
tried to reach out for their bayonets, but were almost
simultaneously thrown flat to the ground, more securely gagged,
pinioned, their pockets ransacked, and finally left to lie there,
not even knowing whence the swift and vigorous blow had come that
had reduced them to such absolute helplessness. All that they could
hear was St. Luc's voice, sometimes moaning, at others cursing
violently. But what had become of him they neither of them could
say.</p>

<p>Certain it is that less than ten minutes later, two soldiers of
the revolutionary guard, with a tall civilian between them who
appeared to be their prisoner, presented themselves at the Porte de
Clichy, which is next to that of Asnières. They had the required
passes such as are supplied to the revolutionary guard in the
exercise of their duty. Their papers being all in order, they were
allowed to pass through into the city without any delay.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>Lavérie and the men left behind at Mon Abris had not forgotten
the crowbar which had been thrown down in the hall earlier in the
afternoon. And this was very fortunate as it happened, because
darkness soon began to draw in and at first no candles or lamps
could be found anywhere. The serving maid, summoned from the
boudoir, explained that lamps were always kept in the cellar on one
of the shelves. Whereupon, since the citizen captain had chosen to
lock the cellar door, there was nothing for it but to use the
crowbar in the manner in which it was originally intended.</p>

<p>There was no disobedience or defiance of discipline in that. To
remain in darkness in a house which reeked of <i>seigneur</i> was
not to be thought of, and Lavérie himself gave the order to break
open the cellar door.</p>

<p>Subsequently, when the whole matter was inquired into and
punishment duly meted out to the guilty, it was never suggested
that Lavérie did anything more reprehensible than just omitting to
have the lamps lighted then and there. But it seems that when they
were found, it was discovered that they needed filling. The oil
drum could not at once be found, and in the meanwhile a couple of
tallow candles were made to do duty instead, one being placed on
the trestle table in the cellar and the other in the hall.</p>

<p>The semi-darkness certainly left the house rather gloomy; but
the evening light had not wholly faded out of the sky, and a pale,
grayish streak still came peeping in through the windows and the
wide-open door of the hall.</p>

<p>It was close on half-past nine when a couple of men's voices, in
conjunction with that of St. Luc, first reached Lavérie's ears. He
was then in the cellar with half-a-dozen comrades, and&mdash;yes,
well! they were having a drink whilst the others remained on guard
about the house. There was no harm in that. The entire premises had
been literally turned inside out more than once in the course of
the afternoon; the women were safe under lock and key, and all the
men were well armed. No one could say that any of them had had too
much to drink, but they were tired as well as hot, for the evening
had turned sultry, and there was thunder in the air.</p>

<p>"Which of you is Citizen Lavérie?" a voice shouted down from
above.</p>

<p>"Here, in the cellar," Lavérie replied. "We are busy with the
lamps. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Guard from the Porte d'Asnières," the voice gave answer. "We
have brought St. Luc back with us and have a message for you from
Citizen Captain Courtain. He has got the <i>seigneur</i>."</p>

<p>"Where?" queried Lavérie eagerly, and ran helter-skelter up the
stairs. The others remained down below, straining their ears to
listen.</p>

<p>Two soldiers, in the same haphazard uniforms that they were all
wearing these days, were standing in the hall. Lavérie saw them
vaguely through the gloom, with St. Luc's tall, funereal-looking
figure between them, and his own comrades crowding excitedly around
the newcomers.</p>

<p>"Over in the house at Levallois-Perret," one of the latter
replied. "Citizen Courtain wants you to bring the women along to
him at once."</p>

<p>Lavérie groaned.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"An important confrontation. Citizen Courtain has sent for the
chief commissary of the section, and we are to pick up a couple
more <i>seigneur</i> who are being detained in a house in the Rue
Legendre. It seems that the English spies have had their
headquarters there recently. I tell you, comrade," continued the
man, "there will be some fine doings at Levallois-Perret presently;
and all of us who have had a share in the business are also to have
a share in the reward."</p>

<p>But Lavérie was not to be cajoled with any promise of a reward.
He gave another groan.</p>

<p>"We are dog-tired, all of us," he mumbled. "We've been on our
feet since three o'clock this afternoon."</p>

<p>"And we've got a half-a-dozen horses outside," the newcomer
riposted glibly. "We borrowed them from the guard at the Porte
d'Asnières. All we've got to do is to get some sort of vehicle from
the neighbourhood for the <i>aristos</i>. By the way," he added,
turning to his comrade, "did we unearth an old barouche when we
were rummaging round the grounds this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"You did," assented Lavérie more cheerfully. "I saw it, too, and
there were two horses and some harness in the stables. So, if we
can have the mounts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Four of you can have mounts," rejoined the other. "But two of
the horses must be led, as they are for our two comrades who are
guarding the <i>aristos</i> in the Rue Legendre. With them, and the
two of us in the box of the barouche, we shall make an escort of
eight: quite enough to be guard against any unpleasant surprise.
You Citizen Lavérie," he concluded, "will, I presume, take command
of the party?" Then he indicated St. Luc. "And in the meanwhile,
perhaps you'll take charge of this old scarecrow, whilst I and my
comrade here get out the barouche and put the horses to."</p>

<p>It all seemed so simple. There was really nothing to arouse any
man's suspicions, however vigilant he might be. Perhaps, if there
had been more light, Lavérie or one of the others would have
noticed something strange about the newcomers. But they were in
uniform and they had brought St. Luc back with them, together with
a message from Courtain, just as Lavérie expected. Moreover, they
themselves suggested that the latter should take command of the
party. Anyone would have been deceived.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the coach and pair were got ready in less
than twenty minutes. Lavérie in the meanwhile had collected the
three women and placed them with St. Luc in charge of some of the
men. Now he ordered the <i>aristos</i> to be bundled into the
barouche. They all obeyed with the same passive meekness which they
had exhibited all along. The three women got in first, then the
long-legged old attorney. The two soldiers were already on the box;
but there was a little delay at the start, because some of the
horses, notably the two in the carriage and a couple of saddled
ones, were extremely restive. Lavérie and his men, feeling tired
and not too sure of their seats after their prolonged visits to the
cellar of Mon Abris, were at pains to select the four mounts that
looked almost as sleepy as themselves.</p>

<p>However, the cavalcade was presently got into order. Lavérie
gave the word of command, and the procession started at last on its
way.</p>

<p>Midway down the Rue Legendre the man on the box drew rein, and
Lavérie called a halt.</p>

<p>"This is where we pick up the <i>aristos</i>," the former said,
and pointed to a house on his right.</p>

<p>"How shall we find them?" Lavérie asked.</p>

<p>"Two of our comrades are on guard right inside the door," the
soldier replied. "Give the password," he added as Lavérie
dismounted and called to one of his men to do likewise.</p>

<p>"What is it?" queried the latter.</p>

<p>"Fly-by-night," was the reply.</p>

<p>Everything still quite simple, Lavérie and his comrade found the
door of the house wide open, and inside the dark and narrow passage
two soldiers were on guard. Lavérie gave the password, whereupon
one of them retired farther into the house and presently returned,
pushing an elderly woman and an old man roughly before him.</p>

<p>"Are these the <i>aristos</i>?" Lavérie asked.</p>

<p>The soldier nodded.</p>

<p>"The citizen captain must be expecting them," he said.</p>

<p>At a command from Lavérie the two old people were now bundled
into the barouche. But the women inside the carriage complained
that there was no more room, whereupon St. Luc volunteered to get
out and mount on the box. There was some argument over that; but
Lavérie was really too sleepy to argue, nor did he protest when St.
Luc took the reins in his hands. Perhaps he did not notice. The Rue
Legendre was very dark.</p>

<p>Thus the procession was formed once more, the carriage leading
the way this time and the mounted escort around.</p>

<p>"We'll go by the Porte de Clichy," the soldier on the box called
out at last. "It is the better and quicker way, and the citizen
captain will be getting impatient."</p>

<p>It was now quite dark. The party of horsemen, with the
ponderous, lumbering vehicle, made a great clatter over the
ill-paved streets. The Porte de Clichy was soon reached. There was
no question of detaining a carriage escorted by a detachment of
revolutionary guard. Lavérie, moreover, was a well-known figure in
these parts, and he had all his passes in order.</p>

<p>"<i>Aristos</i>," he explained curtly to the officer in command
at the gate, who peeped curiously into the carriage. "Orders of the
Citizen Captain Courtain. Important business with the chief
commissary of the section at Levallois-Perret."</p>

<p>"Pass on, Citizen!" the officer replied, and stood watching the
barouche through the gate and until it was out of sight.</p>

<p class="cpb">6.</p>

<p>The first inkling that Lavérie had that something was wrong was
when the driver of the carriage deliberately turned his horses'
heads to the right after he had followed the Route de Clichy for
about ten minutes. He turned up the Route de Pouchet, whereas
Levallois-Perret was in just the opposite direction. Lavérie called
the driver's attention to what he thought was merely an error,
whereupon the latter whipped up his horses and literally tore up
the Route de Pouchet at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>Lavérie dug his knees into his horse and, calling loudly to his
men, started in pursuit. But he and the men were tired, and the
horses they were riding felt anything but fresh. After a minute or
two the carriage gained ground visibly: only two of the mounted men
seemed able to keep up with it. Lavérie shouted to them to keep up,
but they apparently needed no spur to their efforts. It become a
neck to neck race between these two and the barouche, Lavérie and
the other three dropping more and more behind every moment. Their
horses were obviously spent; they themselves could scarcely sit in
their saddles.</p>

<p>"Draw your pistols!" Lavérie shouted to those in front. "Fire at
the horses or at the driver. Fire, curse you!" he reiterated, as
the soldiers paid no heed to his orders but merely continued to
gallop one on each side of the carriage.</p>

<p>He pulled out his own pistol, fired once or twice; but his hand
was unsteady, and his eyesight suffered from the effects of
Monsieur St. Luc's excellent wines.</p>

<p>Up on the box, the long-legged attorney and the two soldiers
were enjoying one of the finest runs they ever remembered in their
adventurous careers.</p>

<p>"If," St. Luc presently said, with a light-hearted laugh, "you
remembered to give those poor horses the draught I prescribed,
they'll drop in a few minutes. They'll come to no harm afterward,
but they won't stand a forced gallop for long."</p>

<p>An exclamation from the man next him caused him to look over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought so!" he went on gaily, for just at that moment
Lavérie rolled over and over with his mount on the dusty road. Two
minutes later another man followed suit. "If this old barouche were
not so confoundedly heavy!" he added, and encouraged his horses
with whip and tongue.</p>

<p>"You can slacken, Blakeney," the other exclaimed after awhile.
"We are safe from pursuit now."</p>

<p>Indeed, Lavérie's two last comrades had also fallen away. Their
horses, covered with sweat and shaking at the knees, had quietly
rolled over in the dusty road.</p>

<p>Lord Anthony Dewhurst, one of London's most exquisite dandies,
dressed in the haphazard uniform of a revolutionary, was surveying
the spectacle from the top of the barouche. Soon the gloom and the
distance hid Lavérie and his comrades from view. Then Lord Tony
turned back to his chief.</p>

<p>"It was a difficult business this time," he said lightly.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sir Percy replied. "Because we could not trust that
obstinate St. Luc to act his part himself. He would have given it
all away, so I conveyed him and his wife to the Rue Legendre first,
and had some difficulty, I assure you, in persuading him to come.
Then I assumed the rôle of the elderly attorney myself and my dear
Marguerite made an excellent Madame St. Luc, who kept the other two
women up to their task of silence and obedience. At one moment she
thought that the waiting-wench would betray us all."</p>

<p>"And if Courtain or one of his men happened to have known the
real St. Luc by sight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then we should have had to devise something else," Blakeney
retorted carelessly. "Unlike our friend Courtain, I believe in
taking every risk."</p>

<p>"By the way, I wonder what Courtain is doing at the present
moment in the lonely house at Levallois-Perret."</p>

<p>"Still waiting for the English spies and the <i>aristos</i> to
turn up. He won't leave the house for at least an hour. When I was
there about midday, I left every possible indication that the
English spies had their headquarters in the house and would surely
return before evening. The worthy citizen captain, anxious for the
reward, is still calmly waiting for the birds to fly into his
trap."</p>

<p>"It was very well managed," Sir Andrew Ffoulkes continued.</p>

<p>"By you two," Blakeney retorted. "Your attack on my two
guardians from behind the fence was a masterpiece, and, of course,
you rifled their pockets for their passes, but I have yet to hear
where you got the horses from."</p>

<p>"We picked up one here and there. That was not very difficult;
and everything else was so splendidly thought of," Lord Tony mused,
and cast a look of profound admiration for his chief. "The wine and
the empty lamps; the carriage and the restive horses. It would have
taken a sharper man than poor Lavérie to suspect a trap."</p>

<p>Inside the carriage, Adrienne Lézennes had put her arms round
her mother; her hand was on her father's knee. But her eyes and
those of her companions in this exciting adventure were fixed upon
the false Madame St. Luc.</p>

<p>"And it is you, milady, and your brave husband who have saved us
all!" Monsieur St. Luc was saying ruefully.</p>

<p>"At peril of your lives," Adrienne added in a tear-choked
voice.</p>

<p>"Ah! but you must not cry, little woman," Marguerite Blakeney
said gaily. "We shall be meeting your Félicien at Pouchet, and he
must not see you with red eyes!"</p>

<p>"And so we are going to England!" Madame St. Luc mused.</p>

<p>"A dull old country; but safe," Lady Blakeney replied.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>FIVE &mdash; THE LURE OF THE
CHATEAU</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>"You can't touch Malzieu! Whatever you do, you dare not touch
him!"</p>

<p>And the speaker, a stout florid man with thick features and
flaccid hanging mouth, brought his clenched fist down with a crash
upon the table.</p>

<p>"And why not, if you please, Citizen Desor?" the other man
retorted sharply. "Why should any traitor be inviolate, however
popular he may be?"</p>

<p>This second speaker was a small spare man, with white, almost
cadaverous face and pale, deep-set eyes that darted from time to
time piercing, steel-like glances at his interlocutor. But Desor
only shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"Because," he said, and made a wide sweeping gesture with his
thick grimy hand, "because of the whole neighbourhood, Citizen
Chauvelin. St. Brieuc is not Paris you must remember: no man with a
touch of genius gets lost in this town as he would in your big
city. And you must admit that Malzieu is a genius. Did you ever see
him in Molière? No? Or as Figaro? Name of a dog, he makes you die
of laughter. And handsome, I tell you! The women just adore him,
and all St. Brieuc is justly proud of him, for this is his
birthplace. The Château de Maljovins close by here belonged to his
grandfather and is now in the possession of his cousin Désiré. You
can't touch him, I say, for if you do there will be riots in St.
Brieuc, and not a single servant of the Republic, civil or
military, would be left alive to take the tale as far as
Paris."</p>

<p>Chauvelin remained silent after that with eyes closed and lips
tightly as if he were striving to shut every ingress to his mind
against the other's prying. Then presently he said with quiet
emphasis:</p>

<p>"We can't allow a man to remain in such a position. Any man who
is the idol of a rabble is a danger to the State."</p>

<p>"He will be a danger," Desor retorted, "if you arrest him."</p>

<p>"That would surely depend on the grounds for the arrest,"
Chauvelin rejoined blandly.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," Desor muttered. "Malzieu has done
nothing. He is a good patriot, he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If Malzieu, for instance, were to commit a crime&mdash;"</p>

<p>Desor laughed. "Malzieu?" he exclaimed. "A crime? He wouldn't
harm a cat."</p>

<p>Chauvelin uttered an ejaculation of impatience.</p>

<p>"You are obtuse, my friend," he said. "If Malzieu were to commit
a crime&mdash;a brutal, cowardly crime&mdash;I imagine that the
rabble who adore him now, discovering that their idol had feet of
clay, would quickly enough hurl him down from his pedestal."</p>

<p>"Yes!" Desor admitted. "If!"</p>

<p>"Well, then!" Chauvelin rejoined significantly, and fixed those
pale, scrutinizing eyes of his on his companion. Desor met those
eyes, interrogated them for a second or two, until something in
their cold, steely gaze mirrored the dark thoughts within.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;?" he murmured.</p>

<p>Chauvelin merely shrugged and retorted: "Why not?"</p>

<p>"A difficult problem, Citizen Chauvelin!" was Desor's dry
remark.</p>

<p>"But not one above your powers, Citizen," Chauvelin concluded
blandly.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>It was on a cold, gusty day in late September that Citizen
Fernand Malzieu received the visit of one Desor, a lawyer of
somewhat shady antecedents, settled in St. Brieuc since poor Pégou,
the old-established notary, had paid on the guillotine the price of
his own loyalty to former clients. Desor brought some interesting
news, none the less welcome because it came through such an
unpleasant channel. Malzieu's cousin, Désiré, who owned the old
château of Maljovins, had died, leaving the property to his next of
kin, Fernand, the last of his name. Désiré Malzieu had all his life
been an eccentric, not to say a maniac. For years he had lived in
the old château, all alone, seeing no one, waited on by one old
woman who ministered to all his wants. Nothing was known about his
life, save that periodically he would go to Paris, taking his old
servant Julie with him. Désiré kept an old horse and chaise: he
would harness the one to the other and off he and old Julie would
go: they would remain absent sometimes two months, sometimes as
much as six; but no one knew when they went or when they came back.
The old château appeared equally lonely, equally desolate whether
the master was in residence or no: of late he had been absent for
the best part of a year, and the news of his death had, it seems,
come from Paris. For nearly a year the old château had been
deserted: it stood perched high up on the cliffs, above the
turbulent ocean, and the booming of the waves against the granite
rocks had been the only sound that broke the silence of the grim
solitude.</p>

<p>But Fernand, with the mercurial, artistic temperament of his
class, had always loved Maljovins. As a boy, when Désiré's father
and mother were still alive, he had been a constant visitor at the
château, but of late he and his cousin had drifted apart. Désiré's
eccentricities, his maniacal love of solitude, had kept Fernand's
attempts at friendship at bay. And now he was dead and Fernand the
rover, the mountebank, found himself in possession of what he had
coveted more than anything else in the world: the old family
château. It was dull and grey and lonely, but it was Maljovins.
Fernand laughed when Desor reminded him of a somewhat curious
condition attached to the legacy.</p>

<p>"The place is only yours, Citizen," the notary said, "as long as
you make it your habitual dwelling-place. If you are ever absent
from it more than three months in any one year, the estate and the
château become the property of Julie Navet, the faithful servant of
your late cousin, Désiré."</p>

<p>"I have no greater wish, Citizen Notary," Fernand retorted,
"than to live at Maljovins for the rest of my days."</p>

<p>"And you are not afraid?"</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," the notary said, and he gave a shudder, as
if a wave of cold had passed down his spine. "They say the place is
haunted."</p>

<p>"I would love to see a ghost."</p>

<p>"It has been deserted for so long, they say, that malefactors
have, before now, made it a place of refuge."</p>

<p>"They'll be welcome to anything I take there with me."</p>

<p>"You are determined, then, Citizen?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I am. Would you have me refuse so brilliant a legacy?
I am a poor man, Citizen Notary," Malzieu continued with simple
dignity, "and my marriage to the Citizeness Céleste Gambier is
delayed through my lack of means."</p>

<p>"Ah!" concluded the notary, "that accounts for everything. Well,
I wish you luck, Citizen! When do you go to Maljovins?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>Already the lawyer had collected his papers and stuffed them
into a leather wallet which he carried under his arm. He now
reached for his hat and took his leave.</p>

<p>"Good luck, Citizen," he said once more as Malzieu escorted him
through the ante-room and there bade him good-bye.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Fernand Malzieu was speeding through
the streets of St. Brieuc. Daylight was quickly fading into dusk.
The streets were ill-lighted, and in the shelter of doorways and
obscure passages furtive figures crouched under cover of the
darkness. But Malzieu paid no heed to these. He feared no one in
this town, for he was conscious of his own popularity and of the
love which his fellow-townsmen&mdash;even those of the
underworld&mdash;had for him. For the past ten years Malzieu had
made France laugh, and France had very great need of laughter these
days; and he was handsome withal, and genial, spent as freely as he
got, and, despite tempting offers to settle down permanently in
Paris as a member of the Comédie Française, he had continued to
make St. Brieuc his headquarters and went on living there, in his
native town, simply, unostentatiously, waiting for better times so
that he might marry pretty Céleste, the daughter of Citizen
Gambier, the municipal doctor.</p>

<p>Malzieu had come to a halt outside a low, narrow house in the
Rue des Remparts. It was the house inhabited by the Citizen Gambier
and his daughter Céleste. Fernand had just plied the knocker with
his accustomed impatience when a tall man wearing a huge caped coat
and chapeau-bras, which further enhanced his stature, accosted him
by slapping him lustily on the back.</p>

<p>"Well, luckiest of mortals!" the new-comer said gaily, "how goes
the world with you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Milor</i>!" Malzieu exclaimed with a thought of
consternation in his voice, "what are you doing in this town?"</p>

<p>"Passing through St. Brieuc," the other replied, "on my way to
Paris. Are you not rehearsing a new rôle? I must see you in
that."</p>

<p>"Ye gods! Do you know Citizen Chauvelin is in St. Brieuc? He is
here on some mission of mischief, you may be sure."</p>

<p>"To keep an eye on you probably, my friend," the stranger
retorted dryly. "But you have never answered my first question
yet."</p>

<p>"How the world goes with me?" Malzieu rejoined lightly. "Well!
We produce the new play on Thursday, and I have just become the
proprietor of my ancestral château."</p>

<p>"Two excellent bits of news," the Englishman said. "I shall hope
to applaud you on Thursday. When do you take possession of your
château?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if all's well. It is only mine, I must tell you on
condition that I am never absent from it longer than three months
at a time."</p>

<p>"Ah! An eccentric will, then? Whose was it?"</p>

<p>"My cousin, Désiré de Malzieu, left me the property."</p>

<p>The Englishman frowned. "Ah!" he said, "I did not know he was
dead."</p>

<p>"You knew him?"</p>

<p>"I had heard of him&mdash;in Paris."</p>

<p>The two men were about to part, and Malzieu was already grasping
his friend's hand, bidding him good night, when the Englishman
suddenly said with grave earnestness:</p>

<p>"Don't go to Maljovins to-morrow, Fernand. Wait a week or two.
You lose nothing by waiting and the whole affair sounds to me like
a trap."</p>

<p>"A trap, <i>milor</i>?" Fernand retorted, with a merry laugh,
"who should want to entrap me? I am not worth killing. I only
possess a thousand livres in all the world, and I shan't have them
in my pocket when I go to Maljovins."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," the Englishman rejoined with an impatient
sigh. "But you'll admit that I have had some experience of these
revolutionary devils over here, and of their methods, and there's
something about this will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, <i>milor</i>," Malzieu broke in lightly, "if you are going
to warn me of danger, it is not to-morrow that I shall go to
Maljovins, but to-night."</p>

<p>Whereupon the Englishman said no more, but went his way, whilst
Fernand ran up the stone stairs of the house in the Rue des
Remparts two at a time, for he was in a mighty hurry to tell his
beloved Céleste of the good fortune that had just fallen to his
lot.</p>

<p>That same evening, half an hour after Fernand had taken leave of
Dr. Gambier and Céleste, and whilst the girl was tidying up the
little apartment preparatory to going to bed, she saw that a slip
of paper had been mysteriously inserted underneath the front door.
Not being of a nervy disposition, she picked up the note and
unfolded it. In it was written:</p>

<p>If you ever need a friend, ask advice from the public
letter-writer at the angle of Passage Fontaine.</p>

<p>Céleste had been gravely puzzled when she read the note: but she
had also been amused. Was it likely that she would be in need of a
friend, when she had her father and Fernand in whom she could
always confide? But two days had gone by since then, and now she
was indeed badly in need of a friend. She did not want to worry her
father, who had plenty of troubles and cares of his own; as for
Fernand&mdash;well! The trouble was about Fernand. It took Céleste
some little time to make up her mind: these were times when it was
not prudent to trust anyone or anything. That note may have been a
trap: and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>A few moments later Céleste was speeding along the Rue des
Remparts. She noticed that at the angle of the Passage Fontaine a
public letter-writer had of late set up his wares. It was five
o'clock of the afternoon: a thin drizzle was falling: Céleste
wrapped her shawl close round her head and shoulders and looked
cautiously about her. The evening was drawing in, and there were
few passers-by: some fifty mètres on ahead the rickety awning that
sheltered the letter-writer's table flapped dismally in the wind.
The man himself appeared to be dozing under the awning: Céleste
hesitated a second or two longer, then she went boldly up to the
table.</p>

<p>"I am Céleste Gambier," she said softly, "and have need of a
friend."</p>

<p>The letter-writer did not appear to move, but from somewhere out
of the semi-darkness, a kindly voice murmured: "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Fernand Malzieu has not been at his lodgings for four days,"
she said in a hurried whisper. "Last Friday evening, he said good
night to me, telling me that he was going to Maljovins the next day
to explore the old château. No one has seen or heard anything of
him since. This is Tuesday. There was a dress-rehearsal at the
theatre this morning. He did not put in an appearance. People make
light of this. They say Fernand is engrossed with his good fortune,
and has forgotten his duties. They say he will not fail to put in
an appearance on Thursday for the production of the play, but I
know Fernand better than they do: I know that nothing would make
him forget his duties. Something has happened to Fernand, and I am
scared to death."</p>

<p>As soon as she had begun her tale, the public letter-writer had
roused himself from slumber, and while she spoke he made as if he
were writing from her dictation. He was a funny old fellow, with
spectacles on his nose, and a shaggy mop of white hair above his
high, wrinkled forehead. It was fortunate that the shades of
evening were drawing in so quickly in this corner of the narrow
street, and that the weather was too bad for clients of the
letter-writer to be demanding his services. When Céleste had done
speaking, the old man continued for awhile to scribble aimlessly
upon the sheet of paper before him, then, when there was not a
single passer-by in sight, he said:</p>

<p>"Go home now! Try not to appear anxious. I will bring you news
of Fernand to-morrow."</p>

<p>Céleste wanted to ask him a question or two, but, very abruptly,
the old man rose, and without paying any further heed to her, he
began collecting his traps together and folding up his awning.</p>

<p>"It is getting dark, Citizeness," he said in a loud, gruff
voice. "I am going home now and to bed. I advise you to do the
same."</p>

<p>And Céleste perforce had to follow this advice.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>An hour later two men were speeding down the Chemin de la Digue
which leads to the seashore. When they had reached the edge of the
cliffs they turned sharply to the left toward the village of
Maljovins.</p>

<p>"It is infernally dark," one of the men said impatiently. "Are
you sure of the way?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, Citizen," the other replied; "that sombre mass of
building over there is the château."</p>

<p>"And you have provided for everything?"</p>

<p>"For everything, Citizen, and I know that you will be satisfied.
Our men succeeded in capturing Fernand Malzieu in the courtyard of
the château when he arrived there on Saturday: he has been under
lock and key in one of the tower rooms ever since. His cousin
Désiré returned from Paris this morning. My man is already there,
ready to act if he has not done so already, and the old woman,
Julie Navet, has agreed to my terms for giving the evidence which I
require. In less than an hour we can have Fernand Malzieu under
arrest for the peculiarly brutal murder of his aged cousin, and
there will be two eye-witnesses to the crime. Directly afterwards,
we will publish the will of Désiré Malzieu, which I have prepared
and which I have already shown to Fernand. This will provide us
with the motive for the murder and will render the assassin doubly
odious to his former worshippers. No!" Desor concluded, with
absolute complacence, "we have left nothing to chance, and the
Committee of Public Safety will, I hope, give me due recognition
for my work."</p>

<p>To this broad hint Chauvelin gave no direct reply, and after a
moment's silence he asked abruptly:</p>

<p>"You are sure of your man, I imagine?"</p>

<p>"I could not have found a better," Desor replied. "Orgelet is a
man who ought to have been guillotined ages ago, he has half a
dozen crimes on his conscience and to-day would murder his own
mother for a few francs. I have him in the hollow of my hand, as I
hold proofs of certain forgeries and trafficking with our enemies
which would send him to the guillotine to-morrow. He knows that,
and knows, too, that if he ever played me false or betrayed us in
any way, I would use those proofs without hesitation. He has a kind
of rough intelligence, too, and will act his part rightly, you may
be sure."</p>

<p>"And the woman&mdash;what is her name?"</p>

<p>"Julie Navet? Oh, with her, greed is master of all her actions.
The way I have worded the will of Désiré Malzieu she becomes sole
beneficiary under it, if Fernand does not comply with the
conditions. And he cannot do that if we send him to the guillotine
for murder."</p>

<p>"The signature to the will? Is that in order?"</p>

<p>"Quite in order, Citizen: and there are the signatures of the
two witnesses. Indeed, indeed," the notary concluded emphatically,
"you need have no fear on that score either. It is not the first
time," he went on cynically, "that I have had to concoct a document
of that sort, and I am not likely to bungle this one."</p>

<p>"No," was Chauvelin's equally cynical retort, "for it would not
be to your interest, Citizen, to make an enemy of me. As for your
reward," he added more lightly, "you need have no fear. It will be
adequate: I promise you."</p>

<p>After which there was silence for a while between these two
partners in the infamous plot. They walked on rapidly, bending
their heads to the wind: soon an irregular mass of masonry,
partially hidden by clumps of trees, loomed out of the
fast-gathering darkness. It was the chateau of Maljovins. The two
men, silently and cautiously, began by making a tour of inspection
of the entire building.</p>

<p>The main body of the house consisted of two stories only, but in
the centre of the façade an extra story had been added; it only
consisted of one room, with a window and a balcony. The front of
the house was approached by a paved courtyard, and it was
ornamented by a colonnaded porch which gave support to another and
larger balcony; under this porch was the main entrance into the
château. To right and left the house was flanked by square,
projecting towers, each of which had doors giving direct access
into them from the courtyard. As the château was built on the side
of the cliff, the upper story was on the level at the back: a
broken-down veranda, covered with overgrown wild vine, gave access
through glazed doors into this side of the house. Here, too, and to
the left of the veranda there was an additional tower, taller than
the others and octagonal in shape: this tower also had, a door
which gave direct access into it. From this multiplicity of doors
it was easy to infer that the rooms on the ground floor of the
towers had no direct communication with other parts of the house,
and that there was possibly only one staircase in the centre of the
château.</p>

<p>The two men had completed the tour of the building: with their
linen carefully concealed by the dark lapels of their coats, and
their hats pulled well over the eyes, they moved about the darkness
noiselessly, like ghosts. They had just reached the veranda and
were cautiously peering about them, when a slight sound coming from
the darkest angle caused Desor suddenly to dart forward with an
angry oath: the next moment there was the sound of a sharp
struggle, a smothered curse, a choking murmur, and the notary
dragged a man out from under the veranda into the open.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" Chauvelin queried in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"Name of a dog," came in a hoarse reply from the victim of
Desor's sudden onslaught, "if that is the way you treat a
patriot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Citizen Orgelet&mdash;!" murmured the notary.</p>

<p>"Who else?" the other retorted. "A fine fright you gave me, I
can tell you. And why do you interfere with my business, I'd like
to know."</p>

<p>"It was a mistake, Citizen," Desor whispered apologetically. "I
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have lost your nerve, Citizen Desor," Orgelet riposted,
with a sneer. "Seeing ghosts, what? Well, am I to finish this
business, or am I not?"</p>

<p>"I thought to find it all done&mdash;" grunted Desor.</p>

<p>"I had no opportunity," was Orgelet's gruff rejoinder, "the
aristo arrived late in the afternoon. He bolted and barred all the
doors and windows himself. It took me some time to get one
undone."</p>

<p>"Why all this to-do?" Desor retorted roughly, "there is no one
in the house but the old woman, and she won't interfere with
you."</p>

<p>But apparently Orgelet was inclined to be truculent. "If you can
find someone else to do the work for you," he began; but Chauvelin
once again broke in impatiently:</p>

<p>"Stop this wrangling!" he commanded; "and you, Citizen Orgelet,
get to business: we've wasted too much time already."</p>

<p>Orgelet shook himself like a big, shaggy dog: then, with hands
in pocket, he shuffled back up the shallow steps of the veranda,
Chauvelin and Desor following closely behind him.</p>

<p>"I have got these shutters undone," Orgelet whispered, and
softly disengaged first the outside latch of one of the shutters,
and then the bolt of the glazed doors. A moment later he had
stepped cautiously into the house, whilst Desor and Chauvelin
remained outside&mdash;watching. It was pitch dark. For a moment or
two everything was as silent, as motionless as a grave&mdash;then
from out of the darkness a soft shuffling sound made itself heard,
the sound of stealthy footsteps creeping down some unseen stairs,
and anon a voice came whispering through the gloom:</p>

<p>"Hist, is that you; Citizen Orgelet?"</p>

<p>"At your service, Citizeness," Orgelet replied.</p>

<p>The footsteps came nearer and suddenly a shaft of light pierced
the darkness, and lit up the grotesque figure of an old woman,
scantily dressed in a petticoat and shawl. Orgelet had opened the
shutter of a small, dark lantern which he carried in his belt: the
old woman only just succeeded in smothering the scream which had
risen to her throat.</p>

<p>"How you frightened me, Citizen!" she murmured hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Too late now to think of fright," Orgelet retorted. "Is
everything ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" the woman replied, "he has gone to bed, and there's no
one in the house but me."</p>

<p>"Which is the bedroom?"</p>

<p>"Just up those steps, then turn sharply to your right. The door
in front of you, at the end of the passage. I have left it on the
latch."</p>

<p>"Then stay down here until I call you. I shall not be long," was
Orgelet's final, cynical retort, as he tiptoed toward the
stairs.</p>

<p>The old woman remained crouching somewhere in a dark angle of
the room: Chauvelin, closely followed by Desor, had stepped
noiselessly into the room. They watched, fascinated, the movements
of the shaft of light that came from the lantern at Orgelet's belt.
Up the stairs it travelled, then took a sharp turn to the left, and
crept along a short passage: Orgelet's footsteps were noiseless,
but presently the watchers heard the soft sound of a door being
cautiously opened, followed almost immediately by a loud cry of
"Qui va là"?</p>

<p>The old woman gave a smothered cry and buried her face in her
hands. Desor, with hands that shook and dripped with moisture,
gripped the edge of his companion's coat. Only Chauvelin remained
motionless and unmoved. The first cry had been followed by another:
"Voleur! Assassin!" The silent, deserted château seemed suddenly
alive with noise: a tramping of feet overhead, a struggle, another
cry, quickly smothered this time, then a dull thud. After that,
silence again.</p>

<p>And a few minutes later the watchers from below saw the
tell-tale shaft of light come creeping back, first along the
passage, then down the stairs. Orgelet had done his work.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" Chauvelin asked.</p>

<p>He had spoken quite calmly, hardly raising his voice, and yet
the sound reverberated like dull thunder through the silence and
the gloom.</p>

<p>"I believe you," Orgelet grunted in reply: then added with a
cynical laugh: "It was tough work, I can tell you." He was intent
on nursing one of his wrists, rubbing it with the palm of his other
hand and muttering a coarse oath or else a groan from time to time.
The bright eye of his lantern wandered aimlessly from point to
point about the room with every movement that he made: one moment
it lit up the huddled figure of the old woman, and the next it
alighted on Desor's bloated face or on Chauvelin's shrunken figure
and pale, thin hands. The room appeared large, running right
through from the veranda at the back of the house to the balcony
above the porch in front. The staircase was somewhere on the left
encased in gloom. There was very little furniture about: a
horse-hair sofa in one angle, a desk in another: in the centre, a
round table, with three or four upright chairs around it.</p>

<p>The old woman had begun to whimper, her teeth could be heard
chattering.</p>

<p>"Stop that snivelling," Chauvelin broke in impatiently.</p>

<p>"My poor, poor master," she moaned.</p>

<p>"You should have thought of that sooner, my good woman,"
Chauvelin retorted dryly. "Are you forgetting perchance, that
Citizen Orgelet has just put you in possession of a very nice
château and some valuable land?" he added with a sneer.</p>

<p>At once the sound of whimpering ceased</p>

<p>"You won't go back on that, Citizen?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not unless you play me false."</p>

<p>"I won't play you false," the woman said more steadily, even
though she could not quite stop the chattering of her teeth, "tell
me what to do and I'll do it."</p>

<p>"It won't be difficult either," Desor grunted. "And what a
reward!"</p>

<p>"It is close on nine o'clock now," Chauvelin resumed in curt,
incisive tones. "At ten o'clock you will go upstairs into your
master's room&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Saints in Heaven!" the woman broke in shrilly, "how shall I do
that?"</p>

<p>"By thinking, I imagine, of the will which your master has made,
leaving all his property to you," Chauvelin replied with a dry
chuckle. "That ought to steady your knees as you go up those
stairs. Well, you will carry a candle, and you need only go as far
as the door, but you'll open the door wide and then let yourself
sink down on the threshold, as if you were in a faint, and there
you will remain until the Commissary of Police arrives on the
scene. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" she murmured, "but, my God, how shall I do it?"</p>

<p>"The Commissary of Police will question you, and you will tell
him that Citizen Orgelet here is your nephew, that he had been
doing some work in the stables for your master and had then come in
to have supper with you: that your master went up to bed at nine
o'clock, and that you and your nephew followed an hour later: that
going up the stairs you both heard certain sounds that alarmed you:
that you went to the door of your master's room, found it on the
latch, pushed it open, and saw&mdash;you understand me?&mdash;saw
Citizen Malzieu, whom you know well by sight, standing over your
master with his two hands around his throat; that you screamed, and
Citizen Orgelet rushed forward to apprehend the murderer, after
which you must have fainted for you remember nothing more. Is that
clear?"</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;quite clear, Citizen," the woman muttered
feebly.</p>

<p>"And what did I do," here broke in Orgelet, "with a dry cackle,
whilst my respected aunt fainted on the doorstep?"</p>

<p>"You overpowered the assassin," replied Chauvelin curtly,
"pinioned him to a chair by securing his hands with his belt and
his feet with yours, wound your scarf around his mouth then you
ascertained that poor Désiré Malzieu was dead, and finally ran to
the nearest commissariat of police, like the good citizen that you
are."</p>

<p>"Hm! And the assassin?"</p>

<p>"We have him under lock and key. He has been shut up in one of
the tower-rooms since Saturday; he will be too hungry to struggle
much."</p>

<p>"So long as it seems reasonable that I overpowered him and
pinned him to a chair, single-handed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? A sturdy, big gossoon like you?&mdash;and Fernand Malzieu
is an actor&mdash;puny&mdash;effete&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not objecting, Citizen, if you are satisfied!"</p>

<p>"Then go and fetch the fellow. You'll find him in the
ground-floor room of the octagonal tower on this side of the
château. We must get our <i>mise-en-scene</i> right, eh, Citizen
Desor?"</p>

<p>But Desor did not seem over-inclined to talk. There was
something ghoulish in the matter-of-fact way in which Citizen
Chauvelin was directing the staging of this grizzly comedy of which
he, Desor, was the principal author.</p>

<p>"Are you dreaming, Citizen," Chauvelin said abruptly in that
trenchant voice of his which always seemed to contain a menace.
"Give your friend Orgelet the key of the tower-room. After which
we'll go and set up the scene for the last act of the play."</p>

<p>Silently Desor fumbled in the capacious pocket of his coat and
silently he handed a key to Orgelet.</p>

<p>"The ground-floor room in the octagon tower, you said?" the
ruffian remarked, and then shuffled across the room toward the
veranda. The next moment he had disappeared through the glazed
door; his lantern went with him, and the two men and the old woman
remained in utter darkness. Orgelet's heavy, dragging footsteps
could be heard quite distinctly, first on the wooden flooring of
the veranda, then squelching the soft, rain-sodden ground of the
pathway round the house. The silence around was death-like; way
below the cliffs, the outgoing tide made no sound of breaking surf,
or rattle of pebbles on the beach: the rain fell, soft and
persistent; soundless, too. The darkness alone seemed to carry
sounds within its folds&mdash;Orgelet's footsteps, and after awhile
the grating of a rusty key in a lock, somewhere in the near
distance, and a murmur as of a man's voice.</p>

<p>"Get a candle, woman," Desor said suddenly in a husky voice,
"this darkness is enough to choke a man."</p>

<p>"No, no, leave it alone," Chauvelin riposted. "Orgelet will be
back directly."</p>

<p>Somewhere close by a wooden shutter flapped, weirdly,
persistently, like the knocking of ghostly knuckles seeking
admittance into the house of death, then once again heavy footsteps
squelched the muddy path. They sounded heavier, slower, than
before. Soon a narrow shaft of light loomed through the darkness:
it drew nearer, and presently fell across the veranda floor.</p>

<p>"Name of a name of a dog, this is work for beasts, not for man,"
came from a gruff voice, even as Orgelet reappeared under the
lintel of the glazed door. A heavy burden lay right across his
shoulders: a ray of light from the lantern in his belt caught the
tip of his big nose and the point of his chin covered with a grimy
stubble.</p>

<p>"Take him upstairs," Chauvelin commanded; "we'll follow."</p>

<p>Orgelet muttered a few more oaths, but never thought to disobey.
He toiled laboriously up the narrow, winding stairs, with Chauvelin
close on his heels, and Desor, dragging Julie Navet by the hand,
following on behind.</p>

<p>Outside the door of the room where Désiré Malzieu lay lifeless,
Orgelet paused and deposited his burden on the ground, propping it
up against the wall.</p>

<p>"I thought I would lock our friend Désiré in," he said, with his
coarse, callous laugh, "in case the dead took to walking."</p>

<p>He took a key out of his pocket, but before inserting it in the
lock, he looked down on the burden which he had brought on his
shoulders all this way from the tower-room. The light from his
lantern fell on Fernand Malzieu's pale, wan face; his eyes were
open and had a dull, feverish glow in them, his hair lay matted
against his forehead, his mouth and chin were hidden by a woollen
scarf wound loosely around his mouth.</p>

<p>"He doesn't look much like a desperate murderer now, does he?"
Orgelet remarked sarcastically.</p>

<p>Then he turned the key in the lock and threw open the door. He
took the lantern from his belt and held it high above his head,
moving it to and fro to illumine different parts of the room. The
light fell on the tumbled bed, the blankets dragged to the floor,
the broken crockery and overturned chair, and in the centre of the
room the motionless form of old Désiré Malzieu lying on his face
with claw-like fingers clutching convulsively at the carpet.</p>

<p>"A pretty sight, what?" Orgelet remarked with a ghoulish cackle.
"What do you think of it, Citizen Chauvelin?"</p>

<p>With a cry of impatience Chauvelin snatched the lantern from him
and stepped briskly into the room; Desor still dragging the woman
by the hand, was hard on his heels.</p>

<p>The next moment the door behind them fell to with a loud bang,
and the key grated in the lock. A noise as of a hundred demons let
loose issued from inside the room, whilst on the other side of the
door Orgelet cautiously lifted the inanimate figure of Fernand
Malzieu from the ground and once more hoisted him up on his
shoulders. Quickly, but as swiftly as he could, guiding himself
with one hand to the banisters, and steadying his burden with the
other, he hurried down the stairs, across the room, out once more
through the glazed door, then through the veranda back into the
open. He skirted the house and crossed the courtyard: here he
paused a moment to lend an ear to the shouting, the cursing and the
banging that still issued from the top story of the château.
Quietly chuckling to himself, he re-started on his way, and this
time he did not halt until he had reached the path at the top of
the cliffs. Here he came to a standstill, and gently laid his
bundle down: then he gave a cry like that of a sea-mew, and thrice
repeated it.</p>

<p>All around the same silence still held sway, only from below at
this point the gentle murmur of the waves rose and fell in rhythmic
cadence that was soothing and agreeable to the ear.</p>

<p>Two men emerged now out of the darkness, and Citizen Orgelet
called out to them in an extraordinarily cultured and
well-modulated voice and in amazingly perfect English:</p>

<p>"Hastings, is that you?"</p>

<p>"At your command," a pleasant voice gave reply. "Galveston is
with me. Have you got your man?"</p>

<p>"You bet I have. But I fear me he cannot walk."</p>

<p>"We have a couple of horses not two hundred mètres from here,"
my lord Hastings explained, "and we can carry him so far."</p>

<p>"I'll leave him in your hands, then," the pseudo-Orgelet
rejoined. "You can take him to his lodgings in the Rue des Moines,
number 17, over against the jeweller's shop at the sign of the opal
ring. Give him in charge of his man-of-all-work, and then go at
once to the house of the Citizen Doctor Gambier, see Mademoiselle
Céleste, his daughter, and tell her the news. After that, meet me
at my lodgings. I must get some of this filth off me before I can
think of anything else."</p>

<p>He watched my lord Hastings and Sir Richard Galveston while they
lifted the still unconscious body of Fernand Malzieu in their arms,
and then he waited until these two devoted followers had
disappeared in the darkness with their precious burden. After
which, he turned on his heel and walked back toward the old
château.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>An hour later in a dingy lodging situated not far from the one
where Fernand Malzieu was slowly recovering consciousness under the
loving eyes of Céleste Gambier, we men were delighting in the story
of this latest adventure of their beloved chief.</p>

<p>"I could not resist going back to that old crow's nest,"
Blakeney was saying gaily, "just to see how that unsavoury rabble
was getting on. I was just in time to see the elegant form of my
ever-engaging friend Chauvelin silhouetted against the light behind
him; he was apparently mentally gauging the distance from the top
balcony to the one below and marvelling if he might venture on a
jump. He had succeeded in opening the window and the shutter: the
door, I imagine, holding fast; it was of oak, very stout, and the
lock was good. He was silent as usual: but in the room behind him,
his precious mate, Desor, as well as old Désiré Malzieu and that
abominable hag, were making a noise fit to bring all the evil
spirits out of Hades."</p>

<p>"Old Malzieu was not hurt, then?" one of the young men
asked.</p>

<p>"Not he!" Sir Percy replied. "You see, what actually happened
was this: after poor, little Céleste had confided her anxiety to
me, and I had arranged to meet some of you on the cliffs, I put on
some rags and set off at once, as you know, for the old château. I
knew, of course, that poor, unsuspecting Fernand had walked
straight into a trap which those devils had set for him. What that
trap was I could only conjecture, but I had shot a guessing arrow
into the air and it had not fallen wide of the mark. My only fear
was that we should be too late, and that I should find the
abominable deed already done. The château was all in darkness when
I arrived, door and windows hermetically closed; but peeping
through one of the shutters under the veranda I saw old Désiré
sitting at the table, having some supper and waited on by that old
hag Julie. Of Fernand I saw no sign. A moment or two later I became
conscious that I was not the only night-bird prowling round the old
château. A bulky, clumsy form was lurking in the shadows, obviously
intent on mischief. He, too, like myself, peeped through the
shutters of the veranda, then he ensconced himself in its darkest
angle and waited. I, in the meanwhile, had found cover behind some
rough shrubbery from whence I had observed his movements. I give
you my word that the whole sinister plan invented by those fiends
was by this time as clear as daylight to me. A lurking assassin! A
will supposed to have been made in favour of Fernand whose
popularity disturbed the complacence of the Terrorists! A charge of
wilful murder! Odium cast on the popular actor! The idol of the
people turned into an execrated criminal! Well, we had to put a
spoke in that abominable wheel or shame the League of the Scarlet
Pimpernel for ever."</p>

<p>"You know the rest," Blakeney went on lightly.</p>

<p>"Skirting the house, I succeeded in effecting an entrance into
it by climbing by way of the two balconies up to the top floor
window, which luckily was not so securely latched as those on the
lower floors. The room which I entered was obviously the master's
bedroom: everything was prepared for him for the night. Trusting to
luck, I hid underneath the bed and waited. After awhile, Désiré
Malzieu came upstairs. Then came the dramatic moment. What exactly
happened in the room below I cannot, of course, tell you. I was
just trusting to luck. But presently I heard shuffling footsteps,
then voices from below, finally the opening of the bedroom door.
You can easily guess the rest: whilst Orgelet fell on old Désiré
Malzieu, who was shouting '<i>Voleur! Assassin!</i>' fit to wake
the dead, I fell on Orgelet, who was so taken by surprise that has
never uttered a sound. What with his belt and my own and a length
of rope which I had stuffed into my pockets, I managed to get him
well trussed and silenced and stuffed underneath the bed: old
Désiré was sprawling on the floor, but I did not think that he was
very grievously hurt. From Orgelet I had taken the dark lantern
which proved such a valuable friend, for it lit up everything round
me and left my face in darkness. After that, the whole thing became
child's play. I was sent by Desor to fetch poor Fernand: until that
moment I did not know where he was and never had the time or
opportunity to look for him. When I first saw him, he was more dead
than alive, but we may take it at this moment, under the able
ministrations of Mademoiselle Céleste, he is more alive than dead.
And so, home, friends," the daring adventurer concluded with his
merry, last laugh; "frankly, I am demmed fatigued. At dusk
to-morrow we make for the <i>Day-Dream</i> and set sail for
England, and unless the little party's obstinacy prove greater than
our determination, we'll have Fernand Malzieu and his pretty
Céleste and possibly old Doctor Gambier on board, too."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>SIX &mdash; IN THE TIGER'S DEN</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Heavens above, the indignation! The entire commune of Bordet was
outraged: its rampant patriotism was stirred to its depths.</p>

<p>Think of it! That abominable gang of English desperadoes had
been at work in the region. Aye! within a stone's throw of Bordet
itself. For Bordet is an important commune, look you! Situated less
than half a dozen leagues from Paris, and possessing a fine château
which might be termed a stronghold, it had the proud distinction of
having harboured important prisoners at different
times&mdash;<i>aristos</i>, awaiting condemnation and
death&mdash;when the great prisons of the capital were, mayhap,
over-full, or it was thought more expedient to erect a guillotine
on the spot.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the ci-devant Bishop of Chenonceaux&mdash;a man
of eighty who should have known better than to defy the
law&mdash;and the equally old Curé de Venelle had been incarcerated
in Fort St. Arc, and it was from there, and on the very eve of the
arrival of Mme la Guillotine and her attendant executioner on a
visit to Bordet, that those two old calotins were spirited away
under the very nose of Citizen Sergeant Renault, one of the
shrewdest soldiers in the department and more keen after spies than
a terrier is after rats.</p>

<p>Sergeant Renault was soundly rebuked for what was mercifully
termed his carelessness, and he was ordered off to defy Holland to
rejoin his regiment, there to expiate his misdemeanour by fighting
against the English. And good luck to him, if he came home with all
his fingers and toes and the tip still on his nose. The authorities
in Paris, on the other hand, despatched a special officer down to
Bordet to take over the command of the detachment of National Guard
stationed at Fort St. Arc, as well as to supervise the organization
of the police in the district.</p>

<p>Now, if the English spies dared to show their ugly faces in
Bordet they would have to deal with Citizen Papillon&mdash;a very
different man to that fool Renault, whose popularity and reputation
had effectually gone down with him. A day or two after the arrival
of Papillon, a batch of prisoners were brought to Fort St. Arc:
ci-devant priests&mdash;contumacious ones, so 'twas
understood&mdash;from villages over Orléans way, whose crimes
against the new laws regulating the administration of religion were
too many to enumerate. No wonder that the authorities in Paris
required a man of Papillon's shrewdness and enthusiasm to guard
these against the possible interference of that
master-spy&mdash;the mysterious Englishman, known throughout the
country as the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>Papillon, sitting in state in the Taverne des Trois Rats,
surrounded by an admiring crowd of citizens, gave it as his opinion
that not the devil himself&mdash;so be it there was a
devil&mdash;could spirit the <i>aristos</i> out of St. Arc.</p>

<p>"And look you," he went on sententiously, "look you, citizens
all! It has come to my ears, that there are those among you who,
for filthy lucre, have actually lent a hand to those abominable
English spies in their treacherous devices against the security of
the State. Now, let me tell you this: if I catch any man of you
thus trafficking with those devils I will shoot him on sight like a
dog!"</p>

<p>And he looked so fierce when he said this, and rolled his eyes
so ferociously that many a man felt an icy shiver coursing down his
spine.</p>

<p>"Therefore," concluded Citizen Papillon, "if any one of you here
know aught of the doings of that gang of malefactors, or of the
place of their abode, let him come forward now like a man, and a
patriot, and impart such information to me."</p>

<p>There was silence after that&mdash;silence all the more
remarkable as the Taverne des Trois Rats was densely packed with
men, all of whom hung spellbound on the irascible sergeant's lips.
Citizen Papillon, having delivered himself of such sound patriotic
principles, proceeded to quench his thirst, and whilst he did so,
the silence gradually broke, firstly into a soft murmur, then into
louder whispering; finally a few words were distinguishable above a
general hum which sounded now like the buzzing inside a
beehive.</p>

<p>"Tell him, Citizen Chapeau!" one or two men kept on repeating in
a hoarse whisper. "It is thy duty to tell."</p>

<p>Thus admonished and egged on too by sundry prods from persuasive
elbows and fists, a tall, ungainly youth slowly worked his way in
and out of the forest of tables, chair, and intervening humanity,
until he came within a few feet of the redoubtable Papillon, where
he remained standing, obviously timid and undecided.</p>

<p>"Well, Citizen, what is it?" the Sergeant condescended to say in
an encouraging tone of voice.</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;it is that&mdash;" the youth answered. Then he
suddenly blurted out the whole astounding fact: "It is that I know
where the English spies have their night quarters!" he said.</p>

<p>"What?" And Sergeant Papillon nearly fell off his chair, so
staggered and excited was he. He appeared quite speechless for the
moment, nor did Chapeau say anything more: his courage had once
more sunk into his sabots. Then someone volunteered the remark:</p>

<p>"Citizen Glapeau lives on the outskirts of the commune. His
father is a mender of boats."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?" Papillon demanded.</p>

<p>"My father and I have seen strange forms of late prowling about
the river bank o' nights," Chapeau said with a swift if transitory
return to courage.</p>

<p>Papillon, with characteristic keenness, seized upon these scanty
facts, and within a few minutes had dragged from the timid Chapeau
all the information he needed.</p>

<p>Chapeau's story was simple enough. Close to the river bank, not
a quarter of a league from his father's hut, there was a derelict
cottage. Citizen Papillon would not know it, as he was a stranger
in these parts, but everyone in Bordet knew the place and could go
to it blindfolded. <i>Eh bien</i>! Chapeau could swear he had seen
vague forms moving about inside the cottage and, in fact&mdash;in
fact&mdash;well, he himself had taken wine and food there once or
twice&mdash;oh, certainly not more than twice&mdash;at the command
of a tall foreigner, who might have been an Englishman.</p>

<p>This was neither the place nor the time to deal with Chapeau's
misdemeanour in the matter of parleying with and feeding the
enemies of the country. Sergeant Papillon for the nonce contented
himself with admonishing the delinquent and frightening him into a
state bordering on imbecility. After which he turned to his
subordinate, Corporal Joly, and fell to whispering with him. It was
understood that measures were being taken for a nocturnal
expedition against the English spies, and after awhile the agitated
throng fled out of the Taverne des Trois Rats and men returned to
their homes to ponder over the events which were about to plunge
the peaceful commune of Bordet into a veritable hurricane of
excitement.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>The derelict cottage which stood with its back to the towpath
had no roof; only two of its outside walls were whole, the others,
built of mud and stone, had partially fallen in. Inside, the place
was littered with debris of plaster and of lath: the front door had
gone, leaving a wide, shapeless gap in its place: the inside walls
were partly demolished, and there was no trace of any
staircase.</p>

<p>In the shelter of these ruins vague forms were moving. The night
was dark and very still after the rain. The moon was up, but
invisible behind a thin veiling of clouds which tempered her light
into a grey half-tone that lay over the river like a ghost-like
pall and made the shadows appear almost solid upon the banks. The
miscellaneous noises which during the day filled the immediate
neighbourhood of the towpath with life and animation had long since
died away: all sounds were stilled in the direction of the
boat-mender's workshop some two hundred mètres away. All that could
be heard now was the soughing of the night-breeze through the reeds
or the monotonous drip-drip of lingering raindrops from the
branches of the willow trees. Even the waterfowl and tiny, prowling
beasts were at rest, and the lazy river made no sound as she lapped
her flat banks with silent somnolence.</p>

<p>The men who were sheltering in the derelict cottage did not
speak. They were of the type whom a life of adventure and of deadly
perils constantly affronted, had endorsed with the capacity for
perfect quietude and protracted silences. It is only the idle and
shallow-witted who are for ever restless and discursive. Of time,
they took no count: the whole of the night was before them, with
its every moment mapped out for action and for thought.</p>

<p>Then suddenly one of them spoke:</p>

<p>"They should be here by now," he said in a soft whisper, scarce
distinguishable from the soughing of the wind among the rushes,
"unless the worthy Papillon has changed his mind. You'll have to
hold them a good quarter of an hour when they do come," he added,
with a pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>A happy chuckle came in response to this command.</p>

<p>He who had first spoken straightened out his tall figure and
gazed above the low parapet of broken masonry toward the remote
distance where the solid, irregular pile of Fort St. Arc stood out
spectral, almost weird, against the midnight sky.</p>

<p>"When Ffoulkes and I have done our work," he resumed after
awhile, "we'll meet as arranged. I don't know how many of us there
will be, but we'll do our best."</p>

<p>"I believe that my information is correct," another voice put in
quietly. "There are half a dozen old priests shut up in the topmost
story of the tower they call Duchesse Anne."</p>

<p>"Nothing could be better," the chief went on, "as the tower is
close to the river and very easy of access. I wonder, now," he
added thoughtfully, "why they chose it."</p>

<p>"I wondered, too," the other assented. "It seems the prisoners
were moved in there yesterday."</p>

<p>"Well, so long as we have the boats..."</p>

<p>"We have two: and Hastings is in charge of them, in the
backwater just below the Venelle woods."</p>

<p>"Then there is nothing more to arrange," the chief concluded,
"and so long as you, Tony, and Holte can keep that fool Papillon
and his detachment off our hands until they are too tired to do
more mischief, Ffoulkes and I will have ample time for our work and
should certainly be at the back-water before dawn."</p>

<p>Before any of the others could give reply, however, he gave a
peremptory: "Hush!" then added quickly: "Here they are! Come,
Ffoulkes!"</p>

<p>To any but a practised ear, the silence of the night was still
unbroken: only such men as these, whose senses were keyed up to the
presence of danger, like the beasts in the desert or jungle, could
have perceived that soft and subtle sound of men stirring far away.
A detachment of the National Guard was in truth moving forward
stealthily along the towpath and the adjacent fields from the
direction of Bordet: their thinly-shod feet made no noise on the
soft, rain-sodden earth. They crept along, their backs bent nearly
double, they carried their muskets in their hands and each man had
a pistol in his belt.</p>

<p>In the derelict cottage all was silence again. Of the four men
who had been there, two had gone. These two were also creeping
along under cover of the darkness, but their way lay in the
direction of Bordet. They appeared as one with the shadows of the
night, which enveloped them as in a shroud. At times they crawled
flat on their faces, like reptiles in the ditches, at others they
flitted like spectres across an intervening field.</p>

<p>When, after awhile, the body of Papillon's men was in their
rear, they struck boldly across to the towpath, and thereafter,
with elbows held to their sides, swiftly and with measured tread
they ran along towards Fort St. Arc. At a distance of some two
hundred mètres from the pile they halted. A spinney composed of
alders, birch, and ash gave them shelter; the undergrowth below hid
them from view.</p>

<p>"What disgusting objects we must look," one of the men said with
a quaint, happy laugh. "I vow that confounded mud has even got into
my teeth."</p>

<p>He drew a scented handkerchief from his pocket and carefully
wiped his face and hands.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said, musing, "if it is possible for any man to
be quite such a fool as Papillon appears. Well, we shall see."</p>

<p>The other, in the meanwhile, had groped his way to a dense
portion in the undergrowth, whence after some searching in the
dark, he brought out a bundle of clothes.</p>

<p>"Hastings has not failed us," he said simply. "And the others
will be waiting in the Venelle woods."</p>

<p>Whereupon the two men proceeded to divest themselves of the
rough and mud-stained garments which they were wearing, and to don
the clothes which their friend had laid ready for them. These
consisted of uniforms of the National Guard, a disguise oft
affected by members of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel: blue
coats with red facings, white breeches and high, black gaiters
reaching above the knee, all very much worn and stained.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" the taller of the two men said when he had fastened
the last button. "Now, Ffoulkes, remember! You wait below until I
give the signal. You have the rope, of course?"</p>

<p>He did not wait for a reply, but started to walk at a quick pace
towards the fort. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, Bart., one of the smartest
exquisites in London, followed close on his heels, with a
heavy-knotted rope wound around his person.</p>

<p>Everything had been pre-arranged. Within a few minutes the two
men had reached the edge of the spinney, and the irregular pile of
the old fort, with the tower known as the Duchesse Anne in the
foreground, rose grim and majestic above them. The Duchesse Anne
was an irregular heptagonal tower surmounted by a battlement. There
were only two small windows, one above the other, in the façade
which fronted the spinney: they were perched high up, close to the
battlemented room; one of these windows, the lower one of the two,
showed a dim light.</p>

<p>Above it, to the immediate left, there was a square, flat
projection which might have served as a look-out place or a
concealing closet. A tiny window was cut into its face. To the
right and left of the tower, the irregular roofs and battlements of
the fort, some of them in ruins, all of them obviously neglected
and disused, rose in irregular masses against the sky. Shallow,
rocky slopes, covered with rough grasses and shrubs, led up to the
foot of the fort, save where these had been cut into to form a
bridge that led to the main entrance portal. The night had become
very dark. Heavy clouds were rolling in from the south-west,
completely obliterating the moon, and a few heavy raindrops had
begun to fall.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Ffoulkes now wound the knotted rope around his
chief's body, and a minute later the latter began his ascent of the
slopes. Immediately the darkness swallowed him up. Sir Percy
Blakeney, one of the most powerful athletes of his time, was
possessed of almost abnormal physique and was as agile as a cat. To
him the climbing of a rough, stone wall did not present the
slightest difficulty. Here, a century-old ivy and a stout iron pipe
gave him all the help he needed. Within five minutes he was on a
level with the lower of the two windows&mdash;the one which showed
a dim light, like a sleepy, half-open eye, through the darkness
clinging with one hand to the ivy and with the other to a stone
projection, he peeped in through the window. It was innocent of
glass. One bar of iron divided it vertically in two, leaving, so
Sir Percy ascertained at once, sufficient space for the passage of
a human body. The room on which it gave was large and bare.
Blakeney, for the space of a second or two, thought it was empty.
He seized the iron bar and limbed upon the sill; this gave him a
commanding view of the room. It was innocent of furniture, save for
one chair, and in the corner, on a level with the window, a
table.</p>

<p>In front of this table, kneeling upon the floor, and with their
heads buried in their hands, six men were kneeling. Sir Percy could
only see their backs, clad in black soutanes, shiny at the seams,
threadbare across the shoulders, and the worn soles of their shoes.
The men were praying. One of them was reciting a Litany: the others
gave the responses.</p>

<p>Without another thought, Sir Percy Blakeney threw one shapely
leg over the window-sill, then the other, and dropped gently down
into the room.</p>

<p>In one moment the six men were on their feet, with a loud cry of
triumph which had nothing priestly in its ring, and through which
one voice, hoarse with excitement, rang out commanding and
distinct.</p>

<p>"My gallant Scarlet Pimpernel, so then we meet at last!"</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>In less time than that of a heart-beat Sir Percy realized the
magnitude of the trap which had been laid for him. In less than one
second he saw himself surrounded; at a call from his first
assailants, half a dozen more men had rushed into the room; he felt
a dozen pairs of hands laid about his person and heard the cries of
exultation and the shouts of derision. He saw the pale eyes of his
arch-enemy Chauvelin glistening with triumphant malice as they met
his own across the room.</p>

<p>A dozen pairs of hands! No wonder that Chauvelin called to him
with a complacent grin.</p>

<p>"I think we have fairly caught you this time, eh, my fine
gentleman!"</p>

<p>He looked so evil just then, so cruel and withal so triumphant
that Blakeney's imperturbable humour got the better of his grim
sense of danger. He threw back his head and a loud, merry peal of
laughter woke the echoes of the old fort.</p>

<p>"By Gad!" he said lightly. "I verily believe, sir, that you
have."</p>

<p>They thought that he meant to sell his life dearly; one or two
of them raised the butt-ends of their pistols, ready to strike the
struggling lion on the head. But that struggle was brief. Just once
he freed himself from them all. Just once did he send one or two of
his assailants, with a mighty blow of his powerful fists,
sprawling, half-senseless, against the wall. Just once did
Hébert&mdash;Hébert who had a heavy score to settle against the
Scarlet Pimpernel&mdash;raise a knife, and would have dealt a
death-blow to the fighting giant in the back, but it was Chauvelin
himself who struck the would-be assassin such a heavy blow on the
wrist with his pistol, that the knife fell with a clatter to the
ground.</p>

<p>"You fool," he said with a snarl, "this is not the time to kill
him."</p>

<p>At that same moment Blakeney raised his hand, and before anyone
could intervene he flung something white and heavy with unerring
precision and lightning rapidity through the window. But what was
one man's strength&mdash;even if it be almost
superhuman&mdash;against the weight of numbers?</p>

<p>"You are caught, my fine Scarlet Pimpernel!" Chauvelin kept on
repeating in a shrill, excited voice, and rubbed his thin,
claw-like hands complacently one against the other "You are caught
at last and this time..."</p>

<p>He left the sentence uncompleted, but there was a world of
vengeful malice in those unspoken words. Quickly enough the end
came. One man used the butt-end of his pistol and struck at the
lion from behind. The blow caught him at the back of the head and
for a moment his senses reeled: whereupon they got him down flat
upon the table and tied him to it with the knotted rope which he
had about him.</p>

<p>Even through half-swooning senses, he was aware of Chauvelin's
thin, colourless face thrust close to his own.</p>

<p>"Fairly caught, eh, my gallant Pimpernel?" the Terrorist
whispered with a malicious chortle; "there are four calotins in the
room above and you have fallen like a bird into my trap this
time."</p>

<p>"Aye! and been trussed like a fowl," Sir Percy gave cool reply.
"The last time you trussed me like this was on the sands off
Calais. On that occasion too you had donned clerical garb, my
friend. 'Tis all of good augury."</p>

<p>Chauvelin laughed; he felt secure at last. No more bargaining
with the Scarlet Pimpernel, no more parleyings. The guillotine here
in the courtyard of the fort as soon as it could be brought down
from Paris. He would send a courier for it at once. In less than
twelve hours, it could be here. In the meanwhile, unless indeed
supernatural agencies were at work, there was no fear that this
trussed bundle of anguished humanity could escape out of this
trap.</p>

<p>Blakeney securely tied to the table, with several mètres of rope
wound about his body, was as helpless as his most bitter enemy
could have wished. For the nonce he seemed to have lost
consciousness. He lay quite still, with eyes closed, and slender
hands&mdash;the hands of an idealist and of an
exquisite&mdash;hanging limp and nerveless from the wrist.</p>

<p>That was the last vision which Chauvelin had of him as he
finally went out of the room in the wake of his friends. They took
the lantern away with them and left the captured giant in darkness.
After which they filed out through the door and pushed the heavy
bolts home. Even so half a dozen men were left on guard outside:
the others quietly went their way, satisfied.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>How long Sir Percy remained thus pinioned in total darkness, he
could not have told you. Time for him had ceased to be. That he had
not been altogether blind to the possibility of this danger was
proved by the fact that he had a message ready for Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes, in his pocket, carefully weighted with a disc of lead. It
contained less than half a dozen words and was characteristic both
of the man and of his friends, in whom he trusted. The words were
"Am helpless. Wait for signal." This message he had succeeded in
flinging out of the window before he had been finally overpowered.
He was quite convinced in his own mind that if Sir Andrew received
the missile, nothing short of death itself would move him from his
post. He would watch and wait.</p>

<p>All that prescience could accomplish had therefore been done;
from henceforth luck, indomitable will and untiring pluck could
alone save this reckless adventurer from the consequence of his own
daring.</p>

<p>Indomitable will and pluck&mdash;the pluck to wait and to remain
quiescent at this moment when the husbanding of strength perhaps
meant ultimate safety. He did not struggle, nor did he waste his
energies, great as they were, in futile attempts to free himself
from his bonds. The men, who had set the cunning trap, were not
likely to have bungled over the tying of knots; therefore Blakeney,
pinioned and helpless, was content to wait and to watch&mdash;to
watch for this swift passage of fortune&mdash;the quaint, old
saying in which he had so often professed belief: "Of fortune the
wayward god with the one hair upon his bald pate, the one hair
which he, who is bold may seize and therewith enchain the god to
his chariot."</p>

<p>He waited and listened. No sound came from the other side of the
door: the soldiers on guard were probably asleep; but overhead men
were stirring; shuffling footsteps moved to and fro across the
floor. The old calotins were watching and praying, and he who had
set out to rescue them lay like an insentient log, the victim of a
clumsy feint. At thought of this Sir Percy swore inwardly, and his
fine, sensitive lips broke into a self-deprecating smile.</p>

<p>But presently he fell asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, he did so because the darkness about him had
become less dense. The moon had tom a rent in her mantle of clouds:
she peeped in through the window; a shaft of her pale, cold light
lay along the floor.</p>

<p>Pinioned as he was, Sir Percy could not do more than slightly
raise his head and turn his eyes so as to search with cat-like
glance the remotest angles of his prison. Then suddenly his roaming
eyes alighted upon an object which lay on the floor just beneath
the window. A knife! the one wherewith Hébert had tried to stab him
and which Chauvelin had knocked out of his colleague's hand. There
it had lain all this while&mdash;an unseen salvation.</p>

<p>Strength? of course it required strength! and pluck and
determination! But here was a man who had all three in a more than
a human degree. Tied to the table, his arms and legs helpless, he
had just his powerful shoulders as a leverage, and to a certain
extent his elbows. With their aid he started first a gentle
oscillating movement of the table, which was a rickety one, the
floor being old too, made of deal planks roughly put together and
very uneven. Gradually by regular pressure first with one shoulder
and elbow, then with the other, the table rocked more and more:
presently it tottered, partly swung back again, staggered again and
finally came down with a terrific clatter on the floor, bearing its
human burden with it to the ground. A broken arm, leg, or shoulder?
Perhaps! The adventurer would not think of that! If he did not
succeed in getting out of this, he would be no worse off with a
broken limb than he had been before. And there was always the
chance! At this moment it meant life to him and to others.</p>

<p>The fraças had, of course, roused the soldiers on guard. Sir
Percy lying prone now, with the table on top of him, heard them
stirring the other side of the door. Anon the bolts were pushed
open, the heavy latch lifted. The chance! my God, the chance! The
chance of what those miserable soldiers would do when they found
the prisoner in such a precarious position. And then there was the
knife! My God, do not let them see that knife...and guess! Blakeney
lying there, half-numb with the fall, bruised more than he knew,
could just perceive its dim outline in the penumbra less than half
a dozen feel: away. There followed a couple of minutes of suspense
more agonizing perhaps than any through which the bold Scarlet
Pimpernel had gone through this night. He heard the footsteps of
the soldiers entering the room. One, two, three of them. One came
up close to him, and laughed. Then the others laughed too. No
doubt, the mysterious Englishman, endowed by popular superstition
with supernatural powers, looked mightily ridiculous, lying there
upon his face with table legs towering above him. Obviously the
soldiers thought so too, looked upon his plight as a huge joke, and
laughed and laughed; one of them adding to the joke by kicking the
pinioned foe. Then they all retired, and went back to their
interrupted sleep. Blakeney heard the violent closing of the door,
the grating of the heavy bolts in their socket, then nothing
more.</p>

<p>The knife still lay there on the ground, not half a dozen feet
away, and the moon once more veiled her light behind a bank of grey
clouds.</p>

<p>To drag himself along the ground with scarcely any noise was
still a difficult task, but it was not a superhuman one. Slowly,
painfully but surely Blakeney soon lessened the distance between
himself and that weapon of salvation. Five minutes later his hand
had closed on the knife, and he was rubbing its edge against that
portion of the rope which he was able to reach. The labour was
arduous and time was speeding on. Darkness had once more become
absolute: through the open window there came the scent of moisture,
and the faint sound of dripping rain upon the ivy-leaves. A distant
church-clock struck three&mdash;two hours then before the break of
dawn!&mdash;two hours and there was such a lot more to be done.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later the first piece of rope had given
way, and the slow process of disentangling it had begun. It
required an infinity of patience and above all absolute
noiselessness. But it was done in time. At last the prisoner was
free from the rope and he was able gently to crawl away from under
the table. A moment later he was at the window peering out in the
darkness. A thin drizzle was falling, and the soft, moist air of
early morning cooled his burning forehead.</p>

<p>"By God!" he murmured to himself. "May I never be in so tight a
hole again. All my compliments, my good M. Chauvelin. The trap was
magnificently laid. But I was a fool to fall into it. I wonder if
there is anyone down there now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Leaning out of the window, he detached a small piece of loose
mortar from the outside wall and let it fall into the depth below.
At once his keen ear detected the sound of men stirring down there,
sitting up, mayhap, to listen, or merely turning over in their
sleep.</p>

<p>"They've left nothing to chance," he murmured with a
good-humoured chuckle. Fortunately, when his enemies brought him
down they had not searched through his pockets, so now from an
inner one he took a pencil and a tablet, and, blindly, for the
darkness was complete, he wrote a long message to his friend. When
he had finished, he listened for a moment; no sound now came from
below; whereupon he gave a gentle call, like the melancholy hooting
of an owl. It was answered immediately from out of the midst of the
spinney, and Blakeney then flung the second message to Sir
Andrew&mdash;a message of instructions, on the fulfilment of which
depended not so much his own life, as that of four helpless,
innocent priests.</p>

<p>After which he wound the precious, knotted rope once more around
his person, threw one leg over the sill, and, a moment later,
started to climb once more up the side of the ancient, ivy-covered
wall.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>Midnight had struck at the church tower of Ste Cunégonde when
Sergeant Papillon returned from his expedition to the derelict
cottage. After a siege lasting over a quarter of an hour, during
which those satané Englishmen had kept up a wild fusillade from the
ruined house and succeeded in putting half a dozen of Papillon's
best men hors de combat, the Sergeant had given the order to
charge, and the men had, indeed, boldly rushed into the
place&mdash;only to find the cottage entirely deserted! It was
scoured in every nook and cranny, but not a sign of human life
could there be found, nothing but the usual heap of debris, the
litter of broken laths, of masonry and scrap-iron. The Englishmen
had vanished as if the earth had swallowed them up. Indeed, the
silence and desolation appeared spectral and terrifying. And it was
in very truth the earth that had swallowed up those mad Englishmen.
They must have crept through a disused drain which gave from a back
room of the cottage direct into the bank of the river. Here they
must have lain perdu half-in and half-out of the water, hidden by
the reeds, until the soldiers were busy searching the cottage, when
no doubt they made their way, under cover of the reeds, and along
the bank to a place of safety.</p>

<p>Papillon had been obliged to leave the wounded in the derelict
cottage and had returned somewhat crestfallen, glad to find that
his discomfiture was not counted against him. In very truth he
could not guess that his expedition had succeeded over-well in its
object, which was to throw dust in the eyes of that astute Scarlet
Pimpernel by persuading him that here were a lot of louts and fools
whom it was mighty easy to hoodwink. Since then the mysterious
Englishman had been captured and was now lying a helpless prisoner
in one of the topmost rooms of the Duchesse Anne. There was nothing
to fear from him. The English spy, completely helpless, was so well
guarded, that not a host of his hobgoblins could trick his warders
now. A dozen men outside his door, he himself little more than an
insentient log, and a good watch at the foot of the tower! What
cabalistic power was there to free him from it all? Chauvelin,
Hébert and the other Terrorists&mdash;all members of the Committee
of Public Safety, who looked strangely out of the picture in their
clerical garb, with the tricolour sash peeping out beneath their
soutanes&mdash;finally retired satisfied, leaving Papillon and the
men whom he had brought back with him on duty in the guard-room for
the night. They would be relieved one hour before break of
dawn.</p>

<p>It all occurred when the church-clock of Ste Cunégonde was
striking four. Some of the soldiers had been relieving the tedium
of the night by playing dominoes, others by recounting the
legendary adventures which popular belief ascribed to the
mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel. All around, the place was still. It
was good to think of that turbulent Englishman lying so still and
helpless in the room above. Then suddenly the voice of the sentry
rang with a quick challenge through the silence of the night. It
was immediately followed by the sharp report of a musket-shot, and
before Papillon and his men could collect their somewhat sleepy
senses the passage and vestibule outside the guard-room, as well as
the courtyard beyond, were filled with awesome sounds of men
shouting, of hoarse commands, of cries, objurgations and curses.
Papillon stepped out of the guard-room. In a moment the confused
hubbub was changed into the one terrifying phrase repeated by a
number of rushing, gesticulating men: "The Englishman has
escaped!"</p>

<p>"Where? How?"</p>

<p>But nobody could say for certain. The facts appeared to be that
the sentry at the bridge-head had heard a sound, and seen a man
running from the direction of the river. Both the sentinels fired,
but in the darkness they missed their man. Just then the detachment
of National Guard, who had come from their headquarters at Bordet
to relieve Papillon, came into view at the bridge-head. With them
was one of the members of the Committee of Public Safety, still in
his clerical garb and with the tricolour scarf gleaming beneath his
soutane. He shouted a peremptory order: "After him, Citizen
Soldiers! or by Satan your heads shall pay for it, if the
Englishman escapes!" This order the sentry dared not disobey,
seeing whence it came, and both the men immediately gave chase,
aided by those who had been on guard at the foot of Duchesse
Anne.</p>

<p>But beyond that no one knew anything definite, and presently the
question was raised: "Had the Englishman really escaped?"</p>

<p>This, Sergeant Papillon set out immediately to ascertain. A
winding stone staircase leads from the vestibule into the tower. He
went up, followed by his own men, while the relief guard remained
in the vestibule.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, had the last of the Sergeant's men
disappeared round the bend of the stairs, than these newcomers
silently and without haste filed out of the vestibule, crossed the
narrow courtyard, the entrance portal and the bridge, and a minute
later had disappeared amidst the undergrowth of the spinney.
Stealthily, warily, but with unerring certainty they made their way
through the thick scrub, striking inland first then immediately
behind St. Arc and back toward the river. They had thus walked in a
complete semi-circle around the fort, and reached that portion of
it which consists of a hollow, ruined tower rising sheer out of the
water and abutting on the battlemented roof of the main
building.</p>

<p>"Now," said one of the men in a quick whisper, "we should soon
be seeing Blakeney up there, and those poor old priests being
lowered by him from the roof."</p>

<p>Hardly were the words out of his mouth than the melancholy cry
of an owl came softly sounding from the battlements above.</p>

<p>"And here he is! God bless him!" came fervently as if in unison
from the hearts of the others.</p>

<p>Blakeney had succeeded in the task which he had set out to do.
He had climbed into the room under the roof where four unfortunate
priests had been imprisoned, preparatory to their being sent to
death, for the crime of adhering to their religion and
administering it in the way they believed the Divine Master had
taught them to do. Their gallant rescuer had soon found a means of
breaking through the ceiling and getting out upon the roof. With
the help of the table, the chairs, and the precious rope, he
contrived to aid these four unfortunates to escape from their
hideous prison. They were sturdy country-folk, these old priests,
and did not shrink from perilous adventure, encouraged as they were
by a kindly voice and helped along by a sure and firm hand.</p>

<p>And whilst the Duchesse Anne tower, the staircases, vestibule
and courtyard of the fort were singing from end to end with shouts,
and words of command, with curses and derisive laughter, the
Scarlet Pimpernel, in a remote corner of the fort which the tumult
and confusion had not yet reached carefully lowered his four old
protégés down from the roof into the arms of his friends. Quietly
he did it, without haste and without delay, but aided by the
members of his league not one whit less devoted, less resourceful
than he. There were just five minutes in which the work of rescue
had to be done; after which the confusion and the search would
spread to this lonely spot, and the noble act of self-sacrifice
would have been offered up in vain.</p>

<p>But it was all accomplished in the time, and soon the little
party, under cover of that darkest moment which comes just before
the dawn, were speeding up the river bank toward the Venelle woods,
where in a lonely backwater one of their gallant band of heroes was
waiting for them with the boats.</p>

<p>The chief was the last to step into the boat, and as the others
began to row, and the four old priests reverently whispered a
prayer of thanksgiving to God, he looked with eyes curiously filled
with regret on the grim pile that stood out vaguely silhouetted
against the dark sky.</p>

<p>"By Gad!" he murmured with an entirely happy little laugh. "I
would not have missed this night's adventure for a fortune. I am
quite sorry to go."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>SEVEN &mdash; "THE LITTLE
DOCTOR"</h2>

<p>On that late September evening two men stood upon the lonely
shore of a picturesque corner of Brittany looking out to sea where
a graceful schooner, catching upon her sails the last lingering
glow of the setting sun, was fast disappearing behind the horizon
line. One of these men was tall above the average, and his height
and breadth of shoulders were accentuated not only by the dark
many-caped coat which he wore but also by proximity to the small,
wizened figure of his companion, an old man whose white hair was
tossed about by the wind, and whose pale blue eyes had that
half-vacant gaze peculiar by daylight to those who habitually burn
the midnight oil. He it was who first broke the silence between the
two of them, and he spoke as if in response to a quick, short sigh
that had escaped the younger man's lips.</p>

<p>"I should be happier, milord," he said gently, "if you yourself
were on board that schooner now."</p>

<p>The other made no reply, gave the signal for turning away from
the shore, and anon the two men walked slowly back along the coast
toward the distant town. They did not speak: each was buried in his
own thoughts. It was only when the lights of the little city could
be seen twinkling in the near distance that they came to a halt;
the older man grasped his companion's slender hand with a gesture
that was almost one of affection.</p>

<p>"Give it up, <i>milor</i>," he said earnestly. "God knows you
have done more than enough in the defence of the innocent and the
weak. The soil of France has been made purer and finer since your
foot hath trodden it. But now it is enough. You have earned your
rest, you deserve to enjoy your happiness in peace, and to think of
your own precious life and of your own safety."</p>

<p>But the other shook his head and smiled somewhat wistfully.</p>

<p>"And," he said, "what about yourself, my dear Docteur
Lescar?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I am safe enough," the old man replied. "They all know me
for a harmless fool round about here. And my profession is my
safeguard. Even the most hot-headed patriot knows that the country
could not afford to send all its doctors to the guillotine."</p>

<p>"You are right there," the other assented. "Well, God guard
you."</p>

<p>Dr. Lescar watched the tall, athletic figure until the
fast-spreading gloom gathered it in its embrace, then he continued
his way in the direction of St.-Jean. He lived in a little house
just inside the city walls, and had in truth made a shrewd remark
when he said that even the wildest revolutionaries in France would
not think of sending all their doctors to the guillotine. Sickness,
epidemics born of hunger and of cold had followed in the wake of
all the other miseries which a set of self-seeking and cruel
autocrats had brought upon the land, and in St.-Jean itself Dr.
Lescar had been kept busy. No one thought of molesting him, no one
hitherto had been fiendish enough to suspect or to denounce him.
They knew well enough that death would take a far heavier toll in
the city if it were not for his unremitting devotion and undoubted
skill.</p>

<p>The old man had met the English milord on one of those errands
of mercy the pursuit of which formed the life's business of both
these men. They were destined to understand one another; the
self-sacrifice of the gallant Scarlet Pimpernel found its
counterpart in the unselfish heroism of the obscure country doctor,
and friendship born of mutual esteem had sprung up between them
over the alleviations of several miseries. It was an impoverished
family of gentle birth, named La Forest, suspected of
counter-revolutionary tendencies and recently denounced to the
Committee of Public Safety, which was even at this hour on the way
to England on board the schooner which Sir Percy Blakeney and Dr.
Lescar had been watching till she was out of sight. The latter had
befriended them whilst he had the power and the Scarlet Pimpernel
had saved them from certain death; but the old man felt heartsick
when he thought of the equally certain danger to which the
noble-hearted English milord exposed himself by remaining even a
day longer in this country where a hundred enemy eyes were on the
watch for him.</p>

<p>Dr. Lescar saw nothing of his English friend for several days
after the departure of the schooner; vaguely he hoped that milord
had taken his earnest advice and had gone back to England. He
himself was more than usually busy that autumn; in the wake of
early frosts and heavy rains had come an epidemic of lung and
throat trouble, and the doctor was up and about seeing patients all
the day and half the night through. It was only in the evenings
that he indulged in an hour or two's recreation in the Taverne des
Trois Rats, where sundry worthy tradesmen of the city were wont to
congregate and to gossip over a muddy cup of coffee and a rank pipe
of stale tobacco and strive to forget for awhile the miseries which
the high ideals of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity had brought
upon them all. It was a tavern that was much frequented by sailors
and fisherfolk, not to mention the numerous smugglers who plied
their dangerous trade with some immunity along the lonely bit of
coast.</p>

<p>On this occasion there was a group of that fraternity engaged in
animated conversation at one end of the room, whilst Dr. Lescar and
his friends sat together over their coffee at the other. The talk
here had drifted to the ever-interesting topic of the Scarlet
Pimpernel. The rescue of the La Forests under the very nose of the
local Revolutionary Tribunal was still a nine days' wonder. Dr.
Lescar was known to have attended one of the children the very day
before the entire family had been spirited away on board an English
schooner that had brought in a cargo of smuggled Bradford cloth and
never been suspected of belonging to the noted English spy and his
amazing league of bravos.</p>

<p>"You must have seen the Scarlet Pimpernel, Doctor," one of the
men said jovially; "you must have seen him! Come! there's no harm
in seeing a spy&mdash;not for a man like you who would be too busy
to trouble about denouncing anyone, as it would be the duty of an
ordinary citizen to do."</p>

<p>"I may have seen the Scarlet Pimpernel," Dr. Lescar replied
coolly, "or I may not. How can I tell? seeing that we none of us
know what he is like, or who he is."</p>

<p>"You must know if an English aristo visited the La Forests," the
other persisted, "you were in and out of their house."</p>

<p>"Citizen Bausset is right," here interposed a mean-looking,
sharp-featured man who was sitting alone at a small table close by.
"You must have seen or at least suspected something, Citizen
Doctor."</p>

<p>He spoke sharply and with a certain indefinite air of authority
which at once drew the eyes of all those present upon him.</p>

<p>"Do you not think it strange," he went on with a note of dry
sarcasm in his thin, shrill voice and addressing the group of men
who sat at the table nearest him, "Do you not think it strange,
Citizens, that Dr. Lescar, who was an intimate of those traitors La
Forest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who says he was an intimate?" interposed Bausset, throwing
himself at once into the breach in order to defend his friend.</p>

<p>"I say so," the other retorted quickly. "He attended them
without demanding his just fees&mdash;"</p>

<p>"More honour to him," one or two broke in warmly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. I am not impugning him for that. I merely endeavour to
prove that the citizen doctor was intimate enough with the La
Forests to give them his time and his trouble for nothing; and I
therefore assert that he must have been aware of the plot hatched
by those English spies to cheat the laws of our country and to aid
a set of damnable traitors to escape from justice."</p>

<p>The man never once raised his voice, nor did he make a single
gesture of wrath or of authority; nevertheless, when he had
finished speaking no one attempted to contradict him. A silence
fell on them all, and furtive looks that spoke of hidden terrors
were hastily exchanged, whilst&mdash;almost
imperceptibly&mdash;those who had sat nearest to the little doctor
edged their chairs away.</p>

<p>The only one in the room who appeared wholly unconcerned was Dr.
Lescar himself. He continued to pull at his long-stemmed pipe and
to sip his coffee with perfect quietude. After awhile he said
simply:</p>

<p>"My country will judge of mine actions: I have done naught of
which any true patriot need be ashamed." Then he turned and
deliberately faced the man with the thin voice and added calmly:
"Every man, woman, and child in and about this city knows me. You,
Citizen, are a stranger here. Will you not tell us your name, and
by whose authority you come here amongst us and impugn the loyalty
of the citizens of St.-Jean?"</p>

<p>The other appeared to hesitate for a moment, then with quiet
deliberation he unbuttoned his coat and displayed the tricolour
scarf of officialdom which was wound around his waist. With his
long, thin fingers he tapped the scarf and said dryly: "This is my
authority, Citizen Doctor. My name is Péret, at your service."</p>

<p>"Then, Citizen Péret, I pray you be more explicit," Lescar
rejoined calmly, "and frame your accusation against me in a manner
that I can understand."</p>

<p>"I am not accusing you, Citizen Doctor," Péret retorted more
amicably; "but you should understand how anxious the government is
to get hold of that English spy whose machinations have fostered
the spirit of rebellion and treachery in France. We cannot leave a
stone unturned to track him to his hiding place. My accusations
were not directed against you. I was only seeking for the
truth."</p>

<p>This change of front, from truculence to conciliation, had at
once a cheering influence upon the company; a general sense of
relief loosened every tongue. Dr. Lescar was very popular in the
city; there was scarce a family dwelling in it who did not owe him
a debt of gratitude, and every man in the room was conscious of a
vague feeling of satisfaction at the thought that the good doctor
of St.-Jean was too important a personage to be dealt with
summarily by the tyrannical Committees of Public Safety.</p>

<p>In the silence that ensued in the immediate entourage of Lescar
and Péret the hum of conversation at the farther end of the room
became more audible. Here a group of rough-looking customers had
apparently lent an ear to the wordy passage of arms whilst
continuing an exciting game of dominoes. They were an ugly crowd,
unwashed and loud of speech, and al of them were drinking hard;
some of them spoke French, with the throaty accent that hails from
Spain or Portugal, others only spoke their own language amongst
themselves&mdash;English, Dutch, Norwegian&mdash;whilst those who
were obviously French, equally obviously hailed from Marseilles.
All of them had that unmistakable air about them that proclaims the
rough seafaring life, and not only that but also the unavowed
trade, the traffic which calls for constant risks, perilous
adventure, and familiarity with crime. Here, from out the general
murmur made up of foreign oaths and truculent arguments, the voices
of two or three Frenchmen detached themselves more clearly. They
were mariners by profession and had the rich colouring, dark, crisp
hair, and massive build peculiar to the sons of Provence. Fine,
sturdy fellows they were and would in truth have been goodly to
look at with their flashing eyes and full red lips and the gold
earrings in their ears, were it not for the glowering, surly, at
times coldly cruel expressions which would suddenly spread over
their features if they were contradicted, or thought themselves
insulted.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Pierre-Hercule," one of them said to the other,
"that you'll gain far more by speaking than by holding your
tongue."</p>

<p>"'Tis not for me to speak," Pierre-Hercule retorted with an
oath. "Dieudonné here knows more about it than I do."</p>

<p>And he half turned to the third man who sat close beside him, a
man whose face was disfigured by a scar that ran straight between
his brows and gave his a peculiarly hard, obstinate expression; his
watery eyes and hanging lips suggested that he had already drunk
more than was good for him, and at Pierre-Hercule's words he
indulged in a stream of meaningless oaths.</p>

<p>"I don't want to give that fool of a doctor away," he murmured
thickly. "He was very good to my little wench once when she was
sick; so hold thy tongue, Pierre-Hercule, and thou too, Jean-Paul,
for I've a good mind to break thy jaw to stop thy cackling."</p>

<p>This was too good an opening for a quarrel and the beginnings
for a fight to be lightly passed over and the next few minutes were
taken up with fierce expletives and provocative cries on the one
side and sundry attempts at peace-making on the part of those
nigh.</p>

<p>At the other end of the room Citizen Péret was apparently
asleep; it was only Lescar and his friend Bausset who had noted
that at the last speech from the Marseillais, the representative of
the Committee of Public Safety had opened one eye and then turned
slightly toward the smugglers, the better to hear what next they
would say.</p>

<p>"Thou 'rt a fool, Dieudonné," Pierre-Hercule resumed after the
quarrel had been hastily patched up. "Dost forget that thine own
neck is in danger, all the while that thou choosest to hold thy
tongue?"</p>

<p>Dieudonné put his hand to his throat and swallowed hard. The
prospect was obviously an unpleasant one.</p>

<p>"Anyway," he said gruffly, "it is too late. The Englishman must
be gone by now."</p>

<p>"Then 'tis ten thousand francs thou has lost, my friend,"
Jean-Paul retorted dryly, "for that is the reward for the capture
of the Englishman."</p>

<p>"Not only ten thousand francs," here broke in the thin, shrill
voice of Citizen Péret, "but most probably thy head as well."</p>

<p>Unseen and silent, he had edged up to the table around which the
smugglers sat; at sound of his voice the three Provençals had
jumped to their feet and hastily made the sign of the
Cross&mdash;one may deal in illicit goods and be pious for all
that. The foreigners gazed up at Péret in surly silence.</p>

<p>"Yes! thy head," Péret went on sharply. "Dost not know that to
traffic with an enemy of thy country is treason and punishable by
death?"</p>

<p>"How did I know that he was an enemy of my country?" Dieudonné
retorted savagely.</p>

<p>"Every Englishman is an enemy of France. We are at war with
England."</p>

<p>"Not every Englishman, Citizen," Dieudonné rejoined. "Our own
government up in Paris has bought Bradford cloth from one or two
English traders whom I could name, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is beside the point," Péret interposed hastily. "According
to thine own showing, thou didst meet an English spy and failed to
denounce him."</p>

<p>"How should I know he was an English spy?"</p>

<p>"The description of that abominable Scarlet Pimpernel has been
circulated far and wide. Every seafaring man, every coastguardsman,
every loyal citizen should know him at a glance."</p>

<p>"That's just it," Dieudonné rejoined with a loud oath. "The
Englishman of whom I speak could not possibly be the Scarlet
Pimpernel. The Scarlet Pimpernel is tall; the Englishman I saw was
short, wizened, a shrimp, what? He has a sick wife and two
miserable brats whom Dr. Lescar over there has attended to my
knowledge the last three days."</p>

<p>"Is this true?" Péret exclaimed with a snarl, and wheeled round
abruptly to face the old doctor.</p>

<p>"I attend all those who are sick," Lescar replied, "but I have
no recollection of the people of whom Citizen Dieudonné is
speaking."</p>

<p>"We'll soon see about that," Péret retorted, sneering. "Where
did that Englishman lodge?" he asked once more, turning to
Dieudonné.</p>

<p>Dieudonné hesitated palpably for a moment or two. Murmurs of
"shame on thee" came from various parts of the room, and Bausset,
the friend of Lescar, swore a savage oath. But the authority of the
tricolour scarf, the threat which it implied, the ever-present
dread of accusations, of summary trials and of the guillotine,
quickly smothered any generous impulse and after a second's pause
Dieudonné replied sullenly:</p>

<p>"In the last house in the Rue des Pipots. The end house before
you come to the edge of the cliff."</p>

<p>Whereupon Péret without further remark called out loudly:</p>

<p>"Citizen Corporal! Hey, there!"</p>

<p>A couple of soldiers immediately entered the room; unbeknown to
the company, they had apparently all along been on guard somewhere
close by. Behind them in the doorway worthy Citizen Liard, landlord
of Les Trois Rats, stood wringing his hands, lamenting at this
insult put upon his loyal house.</p>

<p>"Citizen Corporal," Péret commanded, "go at once to the
barracks, and ask the captain to detail a dozen men to accompany
you. Your orders are to go to the end house in the Rue des Pipots
and to bring every person you find inside that house here to me. Go
quickly!"</p>

<p>The soldiers saluted and went out of the room; their rapid,
measured steps were heard to cross the narrow passage and then
resounded down the cobbled road. In the public room an ominous
silence had fallen over the assembly. Men had drawn their chairs
closer together, casting obsequious glances on Péret, or servilely
offering him food and drink. The fear of death was upon them; one
or two had made a furtive attempt to sneak out of the room, but a
peremptory word from the Terrorist glued them to the spot.</p>

<p>"Every man," he said curtly, "who goes out of this room without
my permission will be a dead man to-morrow. Citizen Landlord, I
make you responsible for everyone in this house."</p>

<p>Only the little doctor remained perfectly calm, sipping his
coffee and now and again giving a pull at his long-stemmed pipe.
But with the exception of Bausset no one spoke with him; they had
edged their chairs away, as far from his as they could.</p>

<p>In the far corner of the room the company of smugglers had
become singularly quiet. It seemed as if they felt the magnetism of
the impending tragedy. Now and then a murmur from one of them would
break the silence, but it was quickly suppressed by the others.
Dieudonné, the unworthy hero of the drama, sat sullenly pulling
away at the fragments of an old clay pipe. The others apparently
were blaming him for what had happened, for a few injurious
epithets were hurled at him between copious draughts of liquor.</p>

<p>Half an hour went by. Péret had been at pains to restrain his
impatience; his fingers were drumming a devil's tattoo upon the
table and his narrow, hawklike face was working as if a savage oath
was forcing its way through his lips.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he jumped to his feet; quick, measured footsteps
resounded on the cobblestones of the narrow street. A few seconds
later the corporal entered the room. He appeared breathless with
excitement.</p>

<p>"We went to the Rue des Pipots," he said, speaking rapidly, "the
last house in the street&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" Péret broke in, in his shrill treble, "and whom did
you find there?"</p>

<p>"No one, Citizen."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? No one?"</p>

<p>"No one, Citizen. The house was empty. But I left three of our
men on guard, waiting your instructions, because in an outhouse in
the waste ground adjoining we found a quantity of smuggled goods:
English ale, cloth, steel files. It was quite by chance we lighted
on them."</p>

<p>"Smuggled goods, eh?" Péret remarked, obviously disappointed.
"We can see about those to-morrow. It was not worth while keeping
three men to guard a few yards of cloth."</p>

<p>"It was not the cloth, Citizen, nor the English files that made
me and my men anxious. It was this note which we found soiled and
crumpled, forgotten amongst the goods."</p>

<p>And the soldier handed a dirty scrap of paper to Péret, who
seized on it eagerly and quickly glanced over its contents. Then he
turned back abruptly to the group of smugglers.</p>

<p>"This epistle," he said dryly, "is addressed to you, Citizen
Dieudonné."</p>

<p>Dieudonné jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"To me?" he queried with an oath.</p>

<p>"It suggests that you meet the writer at the usual trysting
place at ten o'clock this evening. Where is that trysting place,
Citizen Dieudonné?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," the smuggler replied gruffly. "The
epistle is not addressed to me."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I think that it is," Péret rejoined blandly. "How can
we assume that there is more than one Dieudonné who plies the
nefarious trade smuggling in St.-Jean. The epistle is addressed to
the Citizen Dieudonné at the sign of the Flying Bull in St.-Jean.
Now my police happen to know, Citizen Dieudonné, that you are
lodging at the sign of the Flying Bull. Where is the usual trysting
place, Citizen Dieudonné?"</p>

<p>"It is all a lie," Dieudonné swore hotly. "Are you all fools or
am I mad? I tell you that letter was not written to me. I know
nothing of any trysting place."</p>

<p>"H'm," Péret retorted with affected urbanity, "that is a pity
for you, Citizen. Because the device at the foot of this
epistle&mdash;see, it is done in red ink and shaped like a small
flower&mdash;suggests to me that it was written by that arch spy
the Scarlet Pimpernel, and unless you can tell us what is the
trysting place where he suggests that you meet him&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused and looked intently on the smuggler, whose cheeks
beneath the tan had taken on a leaden hue.</p>

<p>"It is all a lie," Deiudonné murmured, but those who heard him
now could note a tone of hesitancy, aye, and of fear in his gruff
voice.</p>

<p>"Unless," Péret reiterated very slowly, "you can tell us the
whereabouts of that trysting place, you will be a dead man within
the hour."</p>

<p>"Name of a dog!"</p>

<p>"Aye, name of a dog!" Péret retorted at the top of his
high-pitched voice, "you dirty, miserable spy, who
tried&mdash;clumsily enough&mdash;to save your pocket by telling us
lies and denouncing a man whom this city respects. You hoped, I
imagine, to keep me and these citizen soldiers busy whilst you
removed your hoard and trafficked with that cursed Englishman.
Well! the guillotine is set up in the market place conveniently,
just outside this house. If within the next five minutes you do not
put me on the track of the Scarlet Pimpernel your head will roll
into the basket, my friend. And," he added with a vicious snarl,
turning to the rest of the company, "whoever protests or interferes
will go the same way too. Citizen Corporal, take this man out into
the square. The sight of Madame Guillotine's outstretched arms
will, mayhap, loosen his tongue."</p>

<p>The man&mdash;who was huge and powerful&mdash;fought desperately
and with amazing vigour; but resistance was, of course, futile, and
within half a minute he was over-powered and led out of the room,
cursing viciously and shaking a clenched fist in the direction of
the little doctor.</p>

<p>"You mealy mouthed reprobate," he shouted, "I'll be even with
you yet!"</p>

<p>But after he had been made to cross the narrow hall and, the
front door being wide open, he had caught sight of the hideous
erection in the market place, dimly illumined by an overhead
lanthorn, he gave a dismal howl like a terrified cur and blabbed
half-incoherently:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you! I'll tell you where you can find the
Englishman."</p>

<p>Péret, who had followed the small posse into the little hall,
gave an exclamation of satisfaction; then he made a peremptory
gesture in the direction of a door close by which bore the legend
"Private" upon it.</p>

<p>"In there!" he said curtly.</p>

<p>He himself pushed the door open and went into what was
apparently the landlord's private parlour. A pair of ragged
curtains hung in front of the only window. In the centre of the
room there was a table; on it a tattered cloth. Around the walls
were ranged a sofa and a few chairs of black horsehair, adorned
with soiled antimacassars, and upon the chimney shelf an old clock
ticked monotonously. A smoky, evil-smelling oil lamp hung from the
blackened ceiling and threw a dim circle of light around.</p>

<p>The soldiers pushed Dieudonné into the parlour.</p>

<p>"Two of you remain on guard in this room," Péret commanded, "the
others at attention outside the front and back doors of this house,
see that no one leaves it. Now then, Citizen Dieudonné," he went
on, as soon as his orders had been obeyed, "we wait to hear what
you have to tell us."</p>

<p>"It's simple enough," the smuggler murmured, cowed and
browbeaten apparently into submission. "The Englishman is rich. He
owns a schooner which you must have seen out to sea. When he comes
ashore I give him shelter out of sight of the police; in exchange
he brings me cargoes of English files, or cloth, what? There's not
much harm in that."</p>

<p>"To traffic with an enemy of France," Péret broke in dryly, "to
cheat your country of revenue, to harbour an English spy is black
treason, punishable by death without trial."</p>

<p>"If I am to die whatever I do," Dieudonné broke out like an
infuriated animal at bay, "then I'll not speak. Find the Englishman
as best you can."</p>

<p>"Silence!" Péret thundered in response. "You are not here to
argue with me, but to speak. But let me tell you this, my friend,"
he added with sudden urbanity, "as soon as we have captured the
Englishman you shall have a full pardon for all your misdeeds and
be free to go whithersoever you please."</p>

<p>"Then send your men to the house of Dr. Lescar; the Englishman
was to meet me there at ten o'clock to-night."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," Péret retorted. "It is another trick."</p>

<p>"A trick, is it?" Dieudonné cried hoarsely, "a trick? Let me
tell you, Citizen Péret, that you and your committee are being
fooled and tricked. Fooled by that sanctimonious doctor who lines
his pockets and sells his country to the enemy. A trick? Go, send
your soldiers to the doctor's house. You'll soon see if this is a
trick."</p>

<p>For a moment after that there was complete silence in the dingy,
ill-lit parlour. Péret's deep-set eyes were fixed upon the
smuggler's face, as if he would drag the truth out of him by brute
force. Then he glanced at the clock. It lacked twenty minutes to
ten.</p>

<p>The soldiers at the door were waiting, immobile and mute.</p>

<p>"A full pardon, man, if you have spoken truly," Péret muttered
between his teeth. "But if within an hour from now the guard have
not returned with the Englishman, or if in some other way you have
lied to me&mdash;well&mdash;it is not too late an hour to set
Madame la Guillotine to work."</p>

<p>He went to the window and threw it open. It gave on to the side
of the house.</p>

<p>"Citizen Corporal!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Present, Citizen," came in quick response as the corporal
hastened around the corner.</p>

<p>Péret leaned out of the window and, when the soldier was within
whispering distance, he gave him rapid instructions:</p>

<p>"The house of Dr. Lescar&mdash;you know it?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, Citizen."</p>

<p>"Go there at once with a dozen of your men. At ten o'clock, or
soon after, a man will arrive. He is tall and powerful&mdash;will
probably be disguised. Do not allow yourself to be
tricked&mdash;seize any man you suspect and remember that your
heads are at stake.</p>

<p>"Tell them to bring Dr. Lescar in here to me."</p>

<p>Then he turned back into the room. For the next few moments the
silence of the night was broken by quick words of command; the
measured tramp of the soldiers as they crossed the market square
and the peremptory call for Dr. Lascar. Anon the little doctor was
ushered into the parlour. He appeared as serene as before, asked no
questions and barely looked at the smuggler, who at sight of him
had broken into a jeering laugh and raised a menacing fist.</p>

<p>"Pray to your saints, Citizen Doctor," he said, "that the
Englishman keeps the tryst which we made with him, else you and I,
it seems, are to lose our heads within the hour."</p>

<p>After that all was still. The doctor sat down quietly beside the
table and soon appeared absorbed in calm meditation. Outside, the
little city was already asleep, or mayhap its inhabitants were
cowering wide-awake in their beds, vaguely conscious of the tragedy
that was being enacted in their peace-loving town.</p>

<p>The tavern itself seemed like the abode of wraiths. Inside the
public room no one had stirred. No one dared stir. There were still
soldiers on guard about the entrances and all those in the public
rooms remembered Péret's orders and his threats.</p>

<p>In the private parlour the silence was electric; through it
could only be heard the dismal, monotonous ticking of the clock and
the gentle grating of metal against metal, as the curtain swayed
upon its rod, blown by the breeze which came through the open
window. Péret had sunk down on the sofa, with his elbows resting on
his knees, his face buried in his hands, striving vainly to keep
his excitement in check. The soldiers, alert and keen, kept close
watch upon the smuggler and upon the doctor. Dieudonné stood close
beside the table, one hand resting on the back of a chair; he was
swaying slightly on his legs like a man drunk, and his glance,
which had become unsteady, travelled incessantly from the calm face
of the doctor to the crouching figure of the Terrorist.</p>

<p>Then it happened all in a moment: the soldiers themselves scarce
knew how, so unexpected was it, like a sudden flash of lightening
in a serene sky. All that they recollected was that Dieudonné at a
stroke lifted the chair nearest to him and, swinging it up, struck
the hanging lamp. There was a terrific clatter of broken glass and
falling metal; one of the soldiers, on the very point of turning to
pull open the door, felt his leg clutched by an unseen hand, and he
fell against his comrade, dragging him down with him, even whilst
Citizen Péret's calls and curses sounded muffled, almost
inaudible.</p>

<p>Less than two seconds later the noise had attracted the
attention of the guard outside The door was pulled open; soldiers
came rushing in; the lanthorn from the hall threw some measure of
light upon the confusion that reigned in the private parlour. There
were some among the soldiers who, had they dared, would in truth
have laughed aloud, so comical did the situation appear: their
comrades struggling to their feet, the broken glass, the oil from
the lamp flowing in an evil-smelling stream, and, funniest of all,
Citizen Péret, the dreaded Terrorist, vainly striving to
disentangle himself from the folds of the tablecloth which
completely enveloped him, whilst the draught through the open
window, now that the door was open, blew the curtains straight out
into the room and somehow helped to make the situation appear more
confused and more ludicrous.</p>

<p>Of the smuggler and the little doctor there was not a sign. In
vain did Péret, as soon as he had found breath, shout himself
hoarse with cries of: "After them! After them! Curse you for a set
of fools! After them! They cannot have gone far!"</p>

<p>But, in truth, though mayhap they had not gone far, they had
gone far enough to be out of reach. Indeed, such a pursuit was
bound to be futile, as there were no indications whatever which
ways the fugitive had gone and many seconds were lost by the
pursuers in arguments as to which road to take. The darkness of the
night favoured them, too, and suddenly even the heavens were on
their side, when it began to rain heavily.</p>

<p>The records of St.-Jean in Brittany go to prove that the pursuit
was carried on in spite of many drawbacks and endless
heart-burnings and disappointments, until a posse of coastguardsmen
sighted a rowing boat out to sea which was making for a graceful
English schooner whose lights could be seen faintly glimmering
through the veil of darkness and of rain. They sent a volley of
musket shot after that boat, but whoever it was who wielded the
oars easily baffled them.</p>

<p>And a couple of hours later, when from far away inland came the
sound of church clocks of St.-Jean booming the midnight hour, Dr.
Lescar was pacing up and down the deck of the <i>Day-Dream</i>
beside the man to whom he owed his life.</p>

<p>"I wish I understood it all, milord," he said. "Indeed, it seems
that my gratitude hath o'erclouded my brains, for it all seems an
inextricable puzzle to me."</p>

<p>"Nay! my dear doctor," Sir Percy Blakeney replied, smiling
pleasantly on the eager face of the little man. "Your generosity
makes far too much of what was just a happy adventure for me,
almost entirely due to chance."</p>

<p>"Chance! It could not have been chance, milord, else how came
you to be in the public room of the tavern at the very hour when
Péret made up his mind to have me arrested?"</p>

<p>"Ah, but that is where you are mistaken, doctor. You think that
it was a sudden thought of Péret's tortuous brain that caused him
to launch an accusation against you. But I who&mdash;alas for
me&mdash;know these abominable Terrorists from old and varied
experience, I guessed the moment that such an important personage
came to St.-Jean that he had been sent in order to track down noble
game. And who more important, more noble, more of a thorn in the
flesh of all those reprobates, than you, my dear doctor, with your
gentle, unselfish ways, your refinement, your learning, and your
pity. Nay! do not protests! We all know how the people of St.-Jean
love you, and to be loved of the people these days stinks in the
nostrils of those arrogant demagogues. I knew that your arrest was
a matter of a few hours, that it would need but a chance click of
the tongue to send a pack of curs snarling at your heels, so I
devised my little comedy. You know my belief, do you not? my belief
in my own luck, my belief that that the Goddess of Chance is bald
is save for one hair in her head, and that when she flies, unseen,
before us, if we can grasp that hair we hold her a slave to our
will; well! to-night I grasped that hair. I laid my scene in the
outhouse of the Rue des Pipots, with smuggled goods and the epistle
making the assignation for ten o'clock. Then, disguised as the
smuggler Dieudonné and one or two members of my faithful league as
Pierre-Hercule and Jean-Paul, we goaded Péret into accusing you
then and there. It took time; but it was a mere juggling with words
and phrases till we got him to send his soldiers off to the Rue des
Pipots, where they found the epistle which I had prepared for them.
From that point until we got him into a state of somewhat fuddled
rage we had easy work. I wanted to get him and you into one private
room with me; I did not care how many soldiers he had to guard him;
the Goddess of Chance was ahead of me and I grasped her by the one
hair. After that, to break a lamp, to plunge the room into
darkness, to trip up the soldiers, to throw a heavy cloth over the
head of Péret was work that any schoolboy would accomplish with
zest. The window was already open as you know; I lifted you across
my shoulders&mdash;you weigh more than a child, my dear
doctor&mdash;and together we gave Citizen Péret's guard of
bloodhounds a magnificent run, until we reached the secret cove,
which was the rendezvous for my faithful lieutenants, and where one
of them was waiting for us with a boat. Indeed, you and I had not
long to wait either. During the wild chase after us, attention at
the tavern had relaxed, the two members of my league had no
difficulty in getting away. They too made straight for the cove,
while our pursuers ran aimlessly about the town. And now," Sir
Percy Blakeney concluded with a happy sigh, "please forgive me for
this long disquisition. 'Tis you who wanted to know how the
adventure was planned. To me and my league it was both simple and
pleasant. Ask my friends Lord Anthony Dewhurst and Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes if they would not greatly relish another such joyous
adventure."</p>

<p>The little doctor was silent for a moment or two; when he spoke
again his voice was veiled with tears.</p>

<p>"Ah, milord! you and your friends are English, and you
have&mdash;I understand&mdash;as great a horror of sentiment as you
have of cowardice: therefore I will make a great effort and keep
back the words of gratitude and admiration which wellnigh choke me.
But at evening when, mayhap, for awhile you rest from your labours
of self-sacrifice and heroism and in the arms of your dear wife
live only for her beauty and her love, then I beg of you to
remember that at that hour there will always rise from an old man's
lips a hymn of thanksgiving to God, in that He created men like
you!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>EIGHT &mdash; THE CHIEF'S WAY</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it, boy!"</p>

<p>"It's damnable, damnable, damnable!"</p>

<p>"Of course it is&mdash;but how can I judge?"</p>

<p>"Blakeney, you will help me," the younger man pleaded. "You
must." And his gray, rather shifty eyes, despite the frown between
the brows, were fixed in a half-appealing, half-obstinate glance on
his chief.</p>

<p>These were the early days of the League. The work of rescue to
one or two of these young enthusiasts was still a
novelty&mdash;exciting&mdash;but perhaps not quite so serious as it
became later on. The chief was obeyed, reverenced by those who were
most in earnest&mdash;but there were one or two&mdash;not
more&mdash;who, full of zest at first, had found discipline and
blind obedience irksome. There was Kulmsted, whom they all
mistrusted, and who had not been allowed to join the present
expedition. Marguerite had begged her husband not to take him
along, and these were the early days of that marvellous
recrudescence of love when Marguerite and Percy had found one
another, after that terrible misunderstanding which had threatened
to wreck both their lives. Therefore, her earnestly expressed wish
could not be denied and Kulmsted was left to nurse disloyal
thoughts in England. There were one or two members of the League,
Lord Tony and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, my Lord Hastings and others, who
would have liked to extend the prohibition to young Fanshawe. He
was a keen sportsman and apparently a loyal friend. He had joined
the League with an enthusiasm which scarcely had an equal, but he
was wilful and obstinate&mdash;an inveterate gambler and apt to
turn very nasty if matters did not go just the way he desired.</p>

<p>But Blakeney, with that marvellous cheerfulness and optimism
which was his greatest charm and that inveterate belief in the
loyalty of others, born of his own perfect rectitude, had dismissed
with a light shrug the warnings of his friends.</p>

<p>"You do the boy an injustice," he declared. "Good God, man,
Fanshawe is a Scotsman, a sportsman, and a gentleman&mdash;find me
greater deterrents to any suspicion of treachery."</p>

<p>On this occasion some half-dozen members of the League had with
their chief found refuge in a derelict cottage, which lay off the
main Thiers-Roanne road. In ragged clothes, unkempt and covered
with grime, they looked just what they pretended to
be&mdash;miserable vagrants driven from home by penury, and
striving to pick up a precarious existence by playing outside
village cabarets. Even at this moment Sir Percy Blakeney, Bart.,
the most perfect exquisite London society had ever known, the
intimate friend of the Prince of Wales, the inimitable Squire of
Dames, had stretched out his long legs, which were innocent of
stockings and only partially covered by a ragged pair of breeches.
In his hands&mdash;the Duchess of Flintshire had called them
irresistably beautiful&mdash;which were coated with coal dust he
had a violin and a bow; his hair, which looked lank and unkempt,
hung in matted strands over his forehead.</p>

<p>He had been performing on his violin in a manner which had
brought forth groans from his hearers and missiles of various kinds
hurled amidst shouts of laughter at his offending head.</p>

<p>In a remote corner of the hut young Lord Fanshawe had been
talking in eager whispers to two of his companions who appeared too
impatient to listen; and the young man had worked himself up into a
state of exasperation until Blakeney's pleasant, if authoritative,
voice suddenly put an end to laughter and focused everyone's
attention on Fanshawe.</p>

<p>"Blakeney, you will help&mdash;you must!"</p>

<p>"We'll all help, my dear fellow," Blakeney replied, and his
gently ironical glance rested for a moment on the flushed face and
restless eyes of his friend. "Tell us all about it. We'll make no
more music to-night."</p>

<p>And as Fanshawe remained silent, with that wilful, obstinate
look more marked on his face, Sir Percy insisted more firmly:</p>

<p>"Tell us, my dear fellow, how it all began. And when."</p>

<p>"About four years ago," Lord Fanshawe began at last, "when I was
on a visit to the D'Ercourts, at the Château Montbrison. Aline was
lovely then...a mere child; not yet seventeen, I think but..."</p>

<p>The boy paused a moment. The obstinacy died out of his eyes and
gave way to a look of softness. The others made no comment, they
sat all round him silently; some of them on the floor with their
knees drawn up to their chins, their hands clasped round their
knees. After a while Fanshawe seemed to shake off the wave of
sentiment that had gripped him by the throat and he went on in a
more matter-of-fact tone of voice.</p>

<p>"We had a very gay time at the château, I remember. It was the
season of the chasse&mdash;you know what that means in
France&mdash;dancing, cavalcades, tournaments, everything to make
life gay and beautiful. Aline was the life and soul of it all. Her
brother François I did not care about; he was sullen and had a
curious trait of arrogance and cruelty in him which, I must say, I
never found in the other French friends whom I used to visit in
those days. The old comte and comtesse, on the other hand, were
perfectly charming, slightly artificial perhaps in their studied
manners and ways of entertaining their guests, but marvellously
hospitable and pleasant. As far as I could gather they were always
kind to the people of the village, and during times of distress
both the comtesse and Aline would sally forth with baskets of
provisions on their arms, and I am sure kindly words on their lips,
to see what was amiss and to succour where they could.</p>

<p>"But trouble was brewing already. News from the big cities used
to filtrate down to this remote village, which lies off the main
road between Thiers and Roanne. Men in black coats and cocked
hats&mdash;you know the sort&mdash;would come down to the cabaret
and hold meetings there to which the village lads crowded eagerly.
I never heard any of those speeches but even we, in England, know
something of these agitators, whose mission in life is to make
trouble.</p>

<p>"All of us at the château had heard of this Paul Notara who was
a young and good-looking fellow and kept the little village school.
I strolled down with François D'Ercourt one day as far as the
school building, which was also Notara's home. It was very neatly
kept and very picturesque. It had a little bit of garden and a pond
and Notara himself told me that he reared a few ducks and chickens
and sold his eggs and poultry. We had a long talk, and I got on
very well with him. As you know, I speak French fairly fluently. He
struck me as a very highly educated man and cultured above his
station. He told me that his mother and father used to keep the
village cabaret, and when his father died Paul and his mother sold
the business. He then applied for and obtained the post of
schoolmaster in the village, settled down in the house attached to
the schoolroom, and lived on there with his mother whom he
idolized.</p>

<p>"Notara, it seems, had never thought of marrying then because
his mother made him so happy and comfortable that the idea of
bringing into the house a young woman who might prove a stormy
petrel never entered his head. At least that was what he told me.
But while I and others were guests at Montbrison&mdash;it was the
first time I had been there&mdash;old Marianne, Notara's mother,
died. Now, of course, I do not know the rights or wrongs of that
story, but what Notara told me sounded credible enough. It appears
that the old woman caught a chill one November night coming home
from the castle where she had been summoned by Madame la Comtesse
to help in the kitchen. I know that they had a houseful at the time
and we certainly had a great to-do with banquetings and so on; I
quite believe that extra hands were required in the kitchen, but it
seems that this wretched old Marianne was already crippled with
rheumatism, and Notara says that she was made to stand in the yard
in the pouring rain doing some work for which there was no
accommodation in the kitchen. Be that as it may, the old woman
developed some chest trouble, and in three days she was dead. Well,
of course, that was nobody's fault and I am quite convinced in my
own mind that both Madame la Comtesse and Aline did all they could
to help because it was in their nature so to do, but Notara assured
me that he was quite alone at the time to look after his mother,
that he entreated the leech of Montbrison to come and see her but
that there happened to be an epidemic of mange among Madame le
Comte's hounds and that the leech told him that these were far more
important than old Marianne. Anyway, the death of his mother seems
to have embittered Notara's soul, and probably did lay the seeds to
his subsequent bitter resentment."</p>

<p>A murmur went round the small assembly who up to now had
listened in complete silence to this simple enough narrative. The
soft look in Fanshawe's eyes had quickly died down again. As soon
as Notara's name came to his lips, that sullen, obstinate look
which seemed the keyhole of his character returned to his comely
young face.</p>

<p>Blakeney poured out a glass of water and handed it to him. "You
are telling your tale most admirably, my dear fellow," he said
lightly; "but do not lose your breath till you have quite finished.
I can see the whole picture before me, so can the others I'm sure;
and all that you tell us now will help us, of course, to decide
what had best be done in the immediate future."</p>

<p>Fanshawe drank the water eagerly. He was not breathless but his
throat was dry and his hand slightly shaky. After a while he
resumed his story.</p>

<p>"It was François d'Ercourt who told me that, according to
village gossip, Paul Notara was quickly enough consoled after the
death of his mother. Six months or so later he had resumed his
place among the young folk in the village. He was fond of dancing
and of their beloved game of bowls on the village green. He drank,
but not to excess, and had an eye for a pretty wench, but it seems
that although he looked at this girl and that one, not one of them
could boast of having received more than passing attention from
Paul Notara. This strange indifference on his part was, of course,
much commented on in the village, and presently when spring came
along the idea began to get about that Paul had a secret passion
gnawing at his heart. You may well imagine that after that these
village folk put their heads together and decided that they would
find out for themselves why it was that Paul Notara, who had quite
a bit of money and a nice position, who was moreover good-looking
and hard-working, was still a bachelor.</p>

<p>"I don't know how François and Monsieur le Comte got to hear of
the facts, but certain it is that we all of us at the château used
to make great fun of the village schoolmaster's hopeless passion
for Mademoiselle Aline. For so it was: the village gossips had
watched him, it seems, o'nights, and they declared that Notara was
for ever haunting the purlieus of the castle and wandering beneath
its walls; he had even been observed to linger in the one spot in
the park from which he could spy the lighted windows and balcony
which gave on Aline's room. Laughter and gossip in the village soon
became general. Imagine a village schoolmaster daring to fall in
love with a daughter of Monsieur le Comte! But that Paul Notara was
in love with Aline was no longer a matter of conjecture; it was an
established fact.</p>

<p>"As was only to be expected, this gossip came presently to the
ears of the Comte d'Ercourt and of the comtesse and also of
François d'Ercourt who, quite unnecessarily I thought, flew into a
violent rage and declared that he would punish that impertinent
schoolmaster with a sound thrashing, unless this abominable gossip
died down within the next few weeks.</p>

<p>"It was soon after that that the tragedy occurred."</p>

<p>Again the young man paused. He rested his elbows on his knees
and buried his face in his hands. It had been easy enough to
recount in an impersonal way the events which had occurred in a
village, and in a castle inhabited by friends, but quite another
matter to tell of the tragedy which had turned the whole tide of
his destiny, and even warped his nature to the extent of changing
his feelings of friendship and loyalty to his chief into incipient
rebellion and treachery.</p>

<p>Blakeney said nothing, but more clearly than anyone else in the
room he could read just what was going on in the young man's mind.
He had such a capacity for sympathy and understanding that, where
others would be ready to condemn, he could always find something to
excuse and a great deal to pity. "Go on, Fanshawe," he said gently.
"I think we ought to hear from you exactly what happened on that
night. So far I have only heard a garbled and possibly a prejudiced
account of that miserable tragedy."</p>

<p>Fanshawe raised his head and looked outward and into vacancy as
if he were seeing again in a vision that exquisite autumn evening
when on the heights the tall cypresses had thrust their velvety
blackness above the sea of feathery pines, and down in the valley
the leaves of the plane trees had turned from russet to gold and
lay thickly on the ground like a soft, murmuring carpet that made a
soft swishing sound under the feet of the passers-by. The waning
moon cast mysterious lights and deep purple shadows across the
avenue of the park, and in the darkness the white flowers alone
gleamed ghostlike, while their coloured sisters hid their garish
beauty in the mantle of the night.</p>

<p>"It is four years ago almost to a day," he resumed after a
while. "Aline and I wandered out into the park one evening after
supper, lured as we were by the beauty of the night. Unfortunately,
she was never allowed outside the house unless accompanied by a
maid. That, as you know, was the general custom in France in those
days among young girls as well born and well bred as was Aline. But
I can assure you that on this occasion the maid's presence was
intensely irksome, both to Aline and to me. There was so much that
I wished to say to her, and I could see that she was willing to
listen. We both wanted to dream, and the swishing sound of the
leaves under our feet was just the right accompaniment to all that
I wanted to whisper in her ear.</p>

<p>"This was my second visit to the château, and my love for Aline
had grown in intensity. The girl, I could see, was developing into
an exquisitely beautiful woman. I felt that my happiness lay
entirely in her hands; I knew the prejudices that
existed&mdash;especially in those days&mdash;in the minds of French
aristocrats against unions with foreigners, but I trusted in my
name and my considerable fortune to overcome those prejudices in
the minds of Aline's parents. Anyway, the thought of making Aline
my wife haunted my mind by day and my dreams by night. She was
exquisite, her eyes were like the mysterious ocean that bathes the
rocky shore of our cliffs in Cornwall, and her lips had the velvety
sheen which lies on the petal of a rose. I wanted to say all this
to her, and by the light of the moon I could see her dear face
soften and her eyes glowing when ever I was bold enough to take her
hand."</p>

<p>"Oh, we had to be very careful in those days how we approached
the daughter of a French aristocrat. No wonder, then, that both
Aline and I found the maid's presence irksome, especially when at a
given moment she interrupted one of my most passionate phrases with
an impertinent: 'I am sure Mademoiselle should be going indoors,
the night is chilly..' But Aline was not quite such a child as her
maid and her mother supposed, and I had the joy of hearing her
retort quite impatiently: 'Yes, it is chill; run, wench, and fetch
me my shawl, the one which I left in the boudoir this
afternoon.'"</p>

<p>"I could not help smiling to myself, for I knew that the boudoir
was situated in a wing of the château at some distance from this
avenue, and you may imagine the joy I felt when I realized that
Aline's intention was to rid herself of the maid's company and to
remain with me alone for some length of time."</p>

<p>"And so we wandered on down the avenue under the plane tree, and
it would be useless for me to tell you how happy I was when I felt
her yielding as I put my arm round her waist. I think I was on the
point of snatching a kiss, when, from the distance, I heard
François d'Ercourt's voice calling to me: he was in the stables
which were close by, looking after one of his horses which was
sick. Afraid that, if I did not respond at once, he might come and
fetch me and, finding his sister alone with me, might make himself
unpleasant, I gave Aline's dear little hand a last squeeze, pressed
my lips on her fingers, and went to find François."</p>

<p>"Now, what happened after that I heard ultimately from Aline
herself. It seems that she waited in the avenue for a moment or
two, half-hoping now that her maid would not tarry; then suddenly,
through the gloom, amongst the trees, she saw a figure moving
toward her. She came to a halt, vaguely frightened: there were many
marauders about these days, for discontent in the village was rife,
stirred up as it was by those agitators from Paris. Aline was about
to call for help; as I told you, the stables were not very far, and
both her brother and I, as well as the grooms, were close by, but
before she could utter a sound a voice which she declared was very
soft and gentle begged her not to be alarmed. The mysterious figure
moved out of the darkness into the light of the waning moon, and
Aline recognized Paul Notara. She told me herself that she did not
remember exactly what he said to her at the time. Certain it is
that he declared his love for her, but assured her at the same time
that he looked upon her with reverence as he would on the Virgin
Mary, and went on talking just the sort of twaddle which men of his
class, half-educated and possibly romantic, usually say under the
circumstances. Aline was not frightened of him; I think, poor
darling, she was slightly flustered by this declaration of love,
which she said was very respectful and gentle. Anyway, the romantic
little scene ended in Notara falling on his knees and kissing the
hem of her gown. He also tried to get hold of her hand, but I do
believe that nothing more serious would have happened had not Fate
intervened in the shape of Aline's maid, who returning at that
moment with the shawl upon her arm. She, seeing a man crouching
beside her mistress, a man who she thought must be an evil-doer,
set up a mighty scream of alarm."</p>

<p>"Notara jumped to his feet. I take it he was no fool, and
realized that his position would be a very precarious one should he
be discovered here by any of the grooms or perhaps by Monsieur le
Vicomte himself. Aline was deeply distressed. She was a sweet
nature, and was no doubt moved to pity for the man who was in love
with her, and she really tried her best to get him away before
François arrived on the scene. Notara, however, seems on this
occasion to have behaved like an idiot. He made no attempt to get
away, and a minute or two later a crowd of grooms and lackeys were
all about him, his flight was cut off, and to make matters worse,
François, who had heard the maid's scream, had come hurrying to the
spot. I followed closely behind him, and we arrived just in time to
see Notara brought down to his knees by the weight of the grooms'
hands upon his shoulders. François, I must tell you, was in a
furious rage, demanding an explanation, looking on Notara as if
ready to kill the man. The maid, terrified lest she should be
blamed for having been absent from her mistress gave an altogether
wrong version of what she had seen. According to her, Notara had
molested Aline, and she had screamed for help, being afraid lest a
worse outrage should befall."</p>

<p>"Aline assured me subsequently that she did all she possibly
could to pacify her brother. Paul Notara, she declared, had said
nothing whatever to offend her. But there was no holding François
then; his rage appeared to have cooled down outwardly, but he was
in one of those white furies which are far more dangerous than the
more violent sort. He reiterated more than once and always
apparently with the greatest calm: 'What was this lout doing here
at this hour? And why should he dare speak to you?' He had a riding
whip in his hand, and suddenly I saw him turn to Notara and tighten
his grip upon the whip. He addressed the wretched man quite coldly,
and asked him two or three times: 'How dared you? How dared you?'
and again: 'How dared you?' And before Notara could say one word,
and before I had the chance of interfering, he raised his whip and
struck him twice in the face."</p>

<p>"He would have done it a third time, only, fortunately, I was
now near enough to take hold of his wrist and prevent a further
blow. I really cannot tell you how Notara looked, what he did, or
even what Aline said. I know that she gave a cry and hid her face
in her hands, whilst I did my very best to control François, who
seemed like a man who had seen red and wanted someone's blood. I
take it that Notara was never a coward, and he certainly was a
powerful, well-built man. I suppose that he succeeded in wrenching
his arms free, although I did not see him struggle. What I did see
was that he was about to raise his fist and, in his turn, to strike
François in the face. Of course, that was nothing but blind and
senseless rage, because, as you know, in France, for a man in his
position to raise his hand against his <i>seigneur</i> was, in
those days, punishable by death. Fortunately or unfortunately, I
really don't know which, the lackeys were there to intercept the
gesture: they seized Notara's arms again before he could actually
raise his fist."</p>

<p>"By this time I had contrived to wrest the whip out of
François's hand. His rage had entirely left him, he was as cool as
you or I, and, turning to me, he said, laughing lightly: 'You
English are as sentimental as our women. Why should I not thrash
that cur, I should like to know?' And he said something about our
men in the navy getting worse thrashings than he would have
administered to Notara, and for lesser faults than his."</p>

<p>"I was thankful to see the grooms and lackeys dragging the man
away. François went up to his sister: he took her by the hand and
led her, willing and silent, back toward the château. I tried to
get a last glance from her, but I think she was crying; and no
wonder! She was little more than a child, and the scene had
entirely upset her nerves. I remember next day hearing François and
his father discussing the punishment that should be meted to
Notara. François, of course, was for having him summarily hanged
for having raised his hand against him and insulted Aline. But
Monsieur le Comte himself decided otherwise. It seems that they
looked upon Notara as a useful man in the village, well-to-do and
industrious. He paid heavy taxes into the coffers of his
<i>seigneur</i> and his government, and I suppose that it was
doubtful whether another man of that same calibre could be found in
this out-of-the-way village."</p>

<p>"I must say that at the time my sympathies were mostly with
Notara, although I had thought him a ridiculous fool for making
love to Aline. But he really had been so respectful and had kept
his own counsel so completely that I never had cause to demean
myself by jealousy. After that horrible scene of the night before I
felt very sorry for him, as I was quite sure he had done nothing to
irritate François to such a pitch of violence. Anyway, Monsieur le
Comte, after he had heard the full story of the adventure, came to
the conclusion that a sound thrashing would meet the case. In the
light of to-day's events I am not quite sure whether François's
idea of hanging the brute would not have been the wiser course, but
at the time it was decided that there was nothing like a stout
stick for breaking a man's spirit and humbling his pride. What we
none of us reckoned with was that this breaking of spirit and of
pride could only be a temporary affair and that resentment and
bitterness would be far more difficult to combat than mere
insolence."</p>

<p>"And so the next day I understood that Paul Notara had been duly
thrashed and within an inch of his life. It was owing to one of the
blows from François's whip that he lost the sight of one eye and
his face became singularly ugly and almost grotesque. I can imagine
him for days afterward, while he lay sick, nursing thoughts of
bitter hatred against everyone at the château. I thought that
probably his love for Aline would turn to hatred; I think in a way
it has. I suppose he has had plenty of time to think over all his
wrongs, both imaginary and real. Certain it is that as soon as he
got better he threw himself blindly into politics."</p>

<p>"As you know, matters were already then moving fast in Paris.
Notara, as soon as he got better, left his native village and
wandered away, presumably to the capital. In the meanwhile, those
devils up in Paris have kept on sending their agitators into all
the villages of France, and particularly over here. They have
stirred up these louts into a terrible state of resentment. The
story of Notara, of course, leaked out, and he has been deified
into a kind of village hero. When he returned, which was only a
couple of months ago, and in the company of one of those agitators,
he was tacitly chosen to be the leader of all the malcontents in
the village. Most of the young men have been drafted into military
service. There are only aged and crippled ones left, but they are
the ones who remember the past; some of them have seen Notara grow
up amongst them, and that is the chief cause, I think, which led to
the horrible scene of this afternoon."</p>

<p>Lord Fanshawe paused. His narrative was at an end. The others
had listened in silence, nor did they speak for some time.
Blakeney, too, was silent. He was meditating on what he had heard.
"There is no doubt," he said after a while, "that there are a good
many innocents like Aline who will have to suffer for sins which
they have not committed and which they abhor."</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Four years had gone by since that memorable evening, the tragic
events of which Lord Fanshawe had related to his friends. The old
régime had been swept away. The king and queen were prisoners in
the hands of their people, soon to pay with their lives the penalty
incurred by their forbears. Men, women, and even children had
expiated on the guillotine the ignorances, the faults, the crimes
of which they themselves were often innocent.</p>

<p>And still the work of retribution went on. Nothing was forgotten
of past injustice and past oppression, and in this death feud
between caitiff and aristocrat worse crimes were committed than
those it was sought to avenge. The Comte d'Ercourt had been among
the first to suffer. Already in the earliest days of the
Revolution, and even while Madame la Comtesse was lying ill with
fever, brought on no doubt by worry and anxiety, an angry mob of
peasants invaded the château&mdash;very much as another had done at
Versailles&mdash;demanding speech of Monsieur le Comte and Madame
la Comtesse, of Monsieur le Vicomte, and Mademoiselle Aline, and
when the family refused to see them they forced their way into the
private apartments, smashed in a door or two on their way, ripping
up cushions and upholstery with the agricultural tools which they
carried, and tearing down priceless pictures from the walls.</p>

<p>It seems that they had contemplated nothing more, once in the
presence of Monsieur le Comte and his family, than to assert their
right over Monsieur le Comte's domains, to shoot what game they
chose, to ride his horses, or milk his cows and goats for their own
benefit, and to empty his granaries, since bread in the district
was scarce. But they also asserted their right of telling Monsieur
le Comte and his family a few home truths. Many matters were raked
up which no doubt both Comte d'Ercourt and his son would have
wished to consign to oblivion. Of these, the tragic fate of Paul
Notara was more bitterly resented than many another act of
oppression or cruelty. Notara himself had left the village and had
not been seen or heard of since. No one knew whither he had gone.
But the picture of him when he wandered off on a chill December
morning, with a bundle of goods slung over his shoulder, his face
with that hideous scar over one eye turned for the last time on his
native village, was one not easily forgotten. And Aline, only
recently emerged out of childhood, listened wide-eyed and
horror-stricken to all this vituperation. Malevolence and hatred
had never touched her before. She knew nothing of the execration in
which her father and brother and, in a lesser degree, she and her
mother were held by these people whom she had been taught to regard
as of less account than her horses and dogs.</p>

<p>Now, when bitter words and angry curses were hurled at those she
loved best, when one of the men in a fit of fury seized her pet dog
and with a savage cry threw it out of the window onto the flagged
terrace below, when a begrimed hand snatched the string of pearls
from her neck and tore the lace ruffle from her brother's wrists,
she could only stand there, trembling and speechless, not
understanding what all this meant or why it had pleased God to
inflict such an outrage upon her dear father and mother who had
always led a pious life, fearing God and honouring the king.</p>

<p>But still darker days ensued. All the servants of the château,
who used to be so diligent and well mannered, now became rough and
overbearing. Impossible to give any one of them an order without
receiving a rude reply&mdash;often a point-blank refusal. And
presently they left, one by one&mdash;the men to seek employment in
the cities, the women because they no longer had taste for domestic
work. The château, once the scene of so much revelry, so many
feasts, became silent and deserted. Only the family remained at
last, with old Pierre and Yvonne to do what little service they
could&mdash;Yvonne to cook scanty meals, and Pierre to try and keep
Monsieur le Comte's and Monsieur le Vicomte's clothes as tidy as
possible and to clean the three or four rooms which the family now
occupied. The rest of the house was shut up, with sheets thrown
over furniture and pictures to save them from the dust: and though
the weather was bitterly cold only one or two fires were lighted
occasionally, because wood was so scarce and dear. Men in rough
clothes and sabots came from Thiers or Roanne and without saying
"by your leave" carted away the provisions of food and fuel that
enriched the storerooms of the château. They would march through
the deserted rooms, peer into drawers and cupboards, carry away
anything portable they fancied, and smash or otherwise destroy
priceless objects of art which had been the pride of the old
château and its owners for many generations.</p>

<p>But the worst was yet to come. Aline, who was then just
twenty-one, saw her mother die, untended by a leech. She knew
nothing of the healing art herself, poor child! and Yvonne did what
she could, but Madame d'Ercourt just faded out of life: content to
go rather than see worse humiliations befall her children. And when
Aline, half-distracted with grief, wept bitter tears because the
leech from Thiers refused to come and see her mother, because,
forsooth, the road was long and the weather cold, Yvonne just
shrugged her shoulders, and said dryly: "I remember Paul Notara
coming here, half-crazy, begging the leech to come to his dying
mother. But the leech could not be troubled about old Marianne,
because forsooth he had to tend Monsieur le Comte's dogs who were
sick with the mange."</p>

<p>Hatred, bitterness everywhere. Oh, my God! when would it all
cease?</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>Down in the village Paul Notara, recently back from Paris,
taught his friends how to nurse thoughts of revenge. Day after day,
night after night, the village folk would sit together, their
stomachs empty and their brains seething with resentment,
discussing the marvellous events up in Paris, where the people,
tired of misery and want, and conscious of their newly found
liberties, had begun by storming the Bastille, raiding that great
monument which for centuries had stood as the embodiment of
everything that was tyrannical and cruel in the old régime of
France. Since then they had seized the persons of the king and his
family and kept them prisoners, forcing the king to do their will
under threat of worse to come. News filtered slowly through to this
remote corner of the Lyonnais, but it did reach even these sleepy
villages in time. Itinerant vendors of cheap wares, or vagrant
musicians would bring tales of the great doings in the big cities,
not only in Paris, but also in Orléans or in Bordeaux. Then why not
in Thiers?</p>

<p>Paul Notara, blind in one eye, older than his years through
mental and bodily suffering, was no longer the handsome young man
of the past. His dreams had been shattered, even the memory of
Aline seldom disturbed his thoughts. He had not forgotten her, but
would not allow himself to think. Perhaps he wished to forget that
it had been because of her that that terrible outrage had been laid
upon him. He hated all her kindred and her friends, but the love of
his youth prevented his feelings toward her to turn to bitterness.
And while the other men from the village sat around the tables of
the inn discussing the latest news from Paris, gloating over the
tales of reprisals, of executions, of summary justice dealt out to
those who had tyrannized over them in the past, Notara would often
sit amongst them, brooding and silent, only putting in a word here
and there, a word that would stir up their flagging interest on
their smouldering hatred. Though blind in one eye and no longer the
fine lad he used to be, Paul Notara, with his superior education
and his forceful personality, was the acknowledged leader amongst
them.</p>

<p>With their headquarters in Thiers, the agents of the new
government were all over the neighbourhood urging the lads of the
villages to find out who it was amongst the bourgeois and the
ci-devants who trafficked with the enemies of the people of France.
But the agents of the government soon enlightened them. The enemies
of the people, they said, were all those who in the past had made
the poor work while they feasted and enjoyed life. They were those
who had luxuries of all kinds at their command while the people
starved and while the poor had not even a leech to look after them
when they were sick. Well, there were plenty of those all over
France: the owners of the land, for the most part <i>aristos</i> or
bourgeois. But, said the agents of the government, the land by
right belonged to the people. What right had a few to monopolize
it? To close up the woods and forests and declare that the beasts
that were good to eat were their own inalienable property? Then
there were others as well who owned no land but had made money by
selling goods to the poor at exorbitant prices, whilst they
themselves waxed rich in the process. Merchants and manufacturers,
all of them tyrants. It was the turn of the people now to show
their power over them.</p>

<p>And so the village lads sucked all those theories in as they
would their mothers' milk. It was good to hear that it was their
turn now to feast and to enjoy, whilst those others who had lived
on the fat of the land would suffer poverty and even want.</p>

<p>They gloated over the idea. Every one of them had a grievance to
record, an injustice to avenge. The old inn parlour was crowded
most nights with hotheads and malcontents. An agitator had been
over from Paris and had talked so forcefully and so eloquently that
the whole countryside was now convinced that the millennium had
come at last upon the earth, that everybody who had been poor would
become rich, that everyone would have enough to eat and drink and
ne'er a stroke of work to do&mdash;no other work, that is, except
denouncing traitors to the justice of their country.</p>

<p>"Let not a single aristo remain," the agitator had entreated
with fiery eloquence, "to continue those traditions of tyranny
under which the people of France have groaned for centuries. Let
but one of that brood be left to stalk the land and back you will
all sink into that abyss of poverty out of which the government of
the people, for the people, is striving now to drag you."</p>

<p>The fact that up to this hour the government of the people for
the people had only succeeded in throwing the country into worse
poverty than before was not brought home to these ignorant village
folk. All they knew was that in the past they had often looked with
envy on the stores of good things&mdash;game, fuel,
fruit&mdash;that entered the château of the D'Ercourts while they
themselves were left to munch rye bread and mouldy potatoes. So,
quite naturally, poor things, they banged their fists upon the big
vats that did duty for tables in the cabaret and shouted with one
accord:</p>

<p>"Down with every aristo!"</p>

<p>"Down with D'Ercourt and his brood!"</p>

<p>"To hell with their château!"</p>

<p>The government agents made it clear that, in order to effect
this admirable purpose of destroying all the enemies of the people,
it was needful that the men of the village volunteer for service on
the <i>Gendarmerie Nationale</i>. The pay was not much&mdash;a
couple of sous a day&mdash;but there would be the glory of tracking
and even arresting the enemies of France.</p>

<p>And they were willing enough to be so enrolled&mdash;life was
dreary and dull and one got tired of hearing what others were doing
in the big cities, in Paris and Orléans and even in
Thiers&mdash;then why not have the same kind of excitement in
Drumettaz? The women especially were keen. They could not be
enrolled in the Gendarmerie Nationale, but they saw to it that
their menfolk got the tricolour badge round their arm, the cockade
in their caps, and that they learned how to use the bayonets which
the government agent had brought for them from Paris.</p>

<p>"Down with D'Ercourt and his brood!" became their favourite cry.
And the more they heard of ci-devant ducs and comtes being sent to
the guillotine, the more they heard of the ci-devant king and his
family being kept in prison, the more were they determined that
their comte and vicomte, yea! and the girl, too, up at the château
should be punished for their past wealth and arrogance as those
others had been.</p>

<p>"Down with the D'Ercourts!" they cried.</p>

<p>"Down, I quite agree," the man from Paris went on, satisfied
that the tares which he had sown were coming up plentifully; "but
why delay? There is no time like the present, and if you wait too
long...who knows? Those <i>aristos</i> might escape your just wrath
and run away to that land of fogs and tyranny called England, where
so many traitors have already found refuge."</p>

<p>"That would be a shame on us all, if those D'Ercourts were to
escape."</p>

<p>The man who muttered this between his teeth, though loudly
enough for those nearest him to hear, was André, the village smith.
He had been crippled in his youth through a kick from one of
Monsieur le Comte's horses. Like Notara, his physical sufferings
had come to him&mdash;though indirectly&mdash;at the hands of those
tyrants and oppressors up at the château, and they gave him a right
to counsel and to lead, though not in so great a measure as Paul
Notara.</p>

<p>"We'll not let them escape," one of the men declared
emphatically.</p>

<p>"Then why not go up there to-day?" the man from Paris suggested.
"They have a marvellous way, those <i>aristos</i>, of escaping
punishment, just by slipping through your fingers."</p>

<p>"I have even heard tell," André the cripple put in dryly, "that
more than one aristo has fled from justice aided by supernatural
agency. There is talk of a sacré Englishman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who just flicks his fingers like this and the aristo becomes at
once invisible&mdash;vanishes into the air&mdash;even at the foot
of the gallows."</p>

<p>"The guillotine, André&mdash;we don't talk of gallows now."</p>

<p>"Nor do we talk of devils&mdash;or supernatural agencies."</p>

<p>It was Notara who spoke. As was his wont, he had been sitting,
silent and brooding, listening to all that wild talk with
ill-concealed impatience.</p>

<p>"But you must have heard of the Englishman, Notara. They say
that he is taller than any two men put end to end, that when he
opens his eyes flames gush out from them, and when he
speaks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Name of a dog, stop that old woman's talk," Notara retorted
with an oath. "Are we children that we are to be scared by tales of
hobgoblins? Here!" he called, turning to where, in the far corner
of the room, a small group of vagrant musicians stood humbly
waiting for alms, "show us your mettle, brothers, and play a lively
tune that will put heart into these cravens' breasts."</p>

<p>The suggestion was very welcome. In this remote village of the
Lyonnais the advanced theories of reason and common sense had not
yet chased superstition entirely away. And while André and his
friends had discussed the supernatural attributes of the mysterious
Englishman, more than one lad had felt a cold shudder running down
his spine.</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! A tune!" they called, with obvious relief. The
musicians began to play. They were unkempt, dirty, clad in a few
rags. One had a fiddle, another a clarinet, the third one a
bassoon&mdash;old battered instruments that emitted wailing sounds
under the trembling fingers of the players. They played the songs
of old France, love songs, martial songs, the gay songs of the
countryside, and while the voices rose in chorus, and the familiar
words and tunes filled the overheated room, hatred and vengeance
and cruelty were momentarily forgotten: the characteristic French
spirit of gaiety had gained the upper hand.</p>

<p class="poem">"Au clair de la lune<br>
Mon ami Pierrot."</p>

<p>and</p>

<p class="poem">"J'aime Bachus, j'aime Manon<br>
Tous deux partagent ma tendresse."</p>

<p>But this sane and softer mood did not suit the man in the black
coat and tricolour sash who had, by his impassioned harangue,
worked these lads up into a martial and virile temper. To hear them
singing sentimental ditties did not suit his purpose at all. He had
been sent down from Paris to create strife and resentment&mdash;he
was paid, handsomely, too, to create them&mdash;to make trouble in
fact, not to see it die down in a wave of sentimentality. Turning
to the out-at-elbows musicians, he called to them with well-feigned
indignation:</p>

<p>"Are ye milksops or chicken-livered cowards?" he demanded.
"These old ditties are fit for old women, not for men. Have ye
never heard the tune we, in Paris, call 'Marseillaise,' because the
lads from Marseilles marched gaily against the enemies of their
country to its inspiriting refrain? Cannot ye play that rather than
these spiritless songs? I, for one, would of a certainty call any
musician a traitor who could not strike up that patriotic
tune."</p>

<p>Oh, that awful word "traitor"! It always had such an ominous
ring. The leader of the musicians, a gentle fellow, bent nearly
double with aching joints, his swollen fingers scarce able to touch
the fiddle strings, cowered before the menacing glance of the man
from Paris. And at first tentatively, then more boldly, he struck
up the opening bars of the new "Marseillaise":</p>

<p class="poem">"Allons, enfants de la partrie..."</p>

<p>"Come, that's better," the man from Paris condescended. "Now,
then, my lads. All together."</p>

<p>Thus egged on, shamed out of their softer mood, the men bellowed
in chorus:</p>

<p class="poem">"Contre nous de la tyrannie<br>
L'etendard sanglant est levé!"</p>

<p>Thus are the moods of a crowd swayed by deft manipulation.
Within a few minutes the man from Paris, sent hither to make
trouble, had all these wretched caitiffs in the hollow of his hand.
He told them to bellow, and they bellowed. He told them that they
had suffered untold wrongs at the hands of cruel tyrants, and they
remembered every unpleasant incident that had ever occurred in
their lives; he asked them who were those who had ground them down
into poverty and humiliation, and with one accord they shouted in
reply:</p>

<p>"D'Ercourt and his brood up at the château."</p>

<p>The man from Paris had, of a truth, stirred up all the trouble
he wanted.</p>

<p>"Then why not storm their château now, as the people of Paris
stormed the Bastille? Why not take the <i>aristos</i> prisoners, as
the people of France even now hold the ci-devant king?"</p>

<p>Why not, indeed? Heads were put together&mdash;poor ignorant
heads!&mdash;and the matter discussed. It would be good to see
those D'Ercourts punished. The vicomte, now&mdash;what an arrogant
taskmaster he had been&mdash;how rough with the men&mdash;how
insolent with the women&mdash;and Monsieur le Comte&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no!" said the man from Paris, "there are no comtes and
vicomtes now. Ci-devants, if you like, and <i>aristos</i>. But we
French men and women are just citizens of France. All of us, and
all equal. Equality, Liberty, Fraternity&mdash;that is our motto
and the 'Marseillaise' the tune to which we sing its praise.
<i>Allons, enfants de la patrie</i>!" he went on lustily: "to the
Château de Montbrison. If we do not find there proof and to spare
that those D'Ercourts are all a set of traitors, then you can call
me a traitor if you will and send me to the guillotine."</p>

<p>He had a ringing voice, had the man from Paris. These makers of
strife in outlying villages were chosen for their oratory and their
power to sway such tempers as were apt to become dormant. In most
of the villages there still lurked a certain respect for the
<i>seigneurs</i>. Habits not only of a lifetime but of generations
cannot so easily be cast aside. Sometimes a certain amount of
gratitude would also linger in the memory: gratitude for past
kindnesses, sentiment for the younger generation born and grown to
adolescence in the village. And the parish priest, not yet
dispossessed, was still powerful enough to threaten with God's
wrath those who were turbulent. Therefore, these men from Paris
were well chosen and highly paid. Itinerant agitators, they had to
earn their money by dint of shouting and inspiring gestures:</p>

<p class="poem">"Allons, enfants de la patrie!<br>
Le jours de gloire est arrivé!"</p>

<p>"Come, you old slow-coach," this stirrer of trouble in Drumettaz
shouted to the musicians. "In the van! Ply your bassoon and your
cracked fiddle, till the hills echo and reëcho with the martial
tune."</p>

<p>The musicians, eager to please, picked up their instruments and
marched out of the inn parlour, striking up as they did the first
bar of the new song. Their leader, in ragged coat and torn
breeches, hoseless, and with feet thrust into sabots, looked but a
wreck of humanity as he plied his bow. Yet he must have been a fine
figure of a man at one time, tall and broad-shouldered. It must be
supposed that one of the many diseases attendant on poverty and
insufficient food had bent his spine and twisted his limbs. Cowed
before the lordly glance and menacing attitude of this black-coated
dictator from Paris, he seemed still further to shrink into
himself, even whilst his quivering fingers evoked the virile strain
of the "Marseillaise." His three companions, one wielding a fiddle,
another a bassoon, and the third a clarinet, followed in his
wake.</p>

<p>Thus was the cortège formed. Behind the musicians marched the
newly enrolled men of the <i>Gendarmerie Nationale</i>, six of
them, carrying their bayonets. They bore themselves well, proud of
their own martial air, their tricolour badges, and their vast
importance. And after them came the other men of the village, the
old and the crippled, all singing lustily. A few women were with
them. Most of them had worked for Madame la Comtesse and
Mademoiselle Aline in the past. They felt in a mood now to exult
over those <i>aristos</i> who were feeling the pinch of want for
the first time in their lives.</p>

<p>Not that either Madame la Comtesse or Mademoiselle Aline had
ever been unkind: they had merely taken all the good things of this
world as if these were theirs by right. They had also taken the
work of the people in the same arrogant spirit: theirs by right.
Because God had created them in a sphere above their fellows. And
Jeanne and Marie, Anna and Joséphine had served them and worked for
them, because they had done so all their lives and because their
mothers had done it before them. It had never struck them that they
also had rights and privileges and liberties. Not until these
black-coated gentlemen with the tricolour scarves had explained to
them that the earth was theirs and the fullness thereof and that if
there was a God at all, which they declared was doubtful, He had of
a certainty created all men and women to have equal rights in
everything on the earth. And if any of those <i>aristos</i> dared
to stand in the way, or tried with outside aid to cling to all the
old fallacies of the past, why, then, there was a certain Madame la
Guillotine up in Paris whose arms would receive all the ci-devants
and <i>aristos</i>, bourgeois and priests who stood in the way of
the liberties of the people.</p>

<p>Thus were the great gates of the château reached at last. A
motley crowd of men and women in ragged clothes, panting and
sweating after the long tramp along the muddy road. Unarmed,
fortunately, save for those bayonets which the valiant
<i>Gendarmerie Nationale</i> did not know how to wield. The shades
of the evening were falling fast: only a gray and misty twilight
lingered still in the clearings. A warm, boisterous wind blew from
over the range of Forrez. The Garde Nationale, conscious of their
importance, demanded admittance, but the gates were no longer kept
locked these days. What had been the good? There was always a group
of malcontents or mere mischief-makers to break them open if they
had been locked. Musicians <i>en tête</i>, they marched in and
swarmed into the courtyard: then up the <i>perron</i> steps to the
front door. There was nothing to stop them. No bolts, no locks, no
bars. So straight across the stately vestibule dimly lit by a
single oil lamp which cast a faint, yellowish glow on the massive
marble columns, making them seem like ghosts looming out of the
darkness.</p>

<p>Then up the monumental staircase on which had passed such
brilliant assemblies in the past. Now the marble treads were dull
and cracked, the ormolu balustrade twisted and broken&mdash;the
result of the former raid upon the old château. Monsieur d'Ercourt
was in one of the small boudoirs with his son François when first
he heard the noise of tramping feet, of hoarse singing and shouting
approaching from the road. He knew what it all meant. He put down
the book which he was reading and, walking erect and calm, he
sought Pierre and Yvonne in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"We shall have trouble again here directly," he said coolly: "a
crowd of villagers is invading the château. We must try and not get
a repetition of what we went through before. Can I trust you both
to look after Mademoiselle Aline?"</p>

<p>Pierre and Yvonne swore that they would do their best. They
would see to it that Mademoiselle Aline remained quietly in one of
the rooms on the top floor. Those rowdies from the village could
easily be persuaded that she was from home visiting her aunt in
Bordeaux.</p>

<p>Satisfied, or nearly so, the Comte d'Ercourt rejoined his son in
the boudoir. Neither of them was afraid. With all their faults, the
great French nobles of the time possessed an immense courage which
amounted to virtue. They had been arrogant, and were now humbled,
but they never cringed. The shadow of Death lurked around them all
the time, but they were prepared for every fate, and as ready to
meet death on the gallows as they had been in the past on the
battlefield or in the cause of chivalry. They had learned their
lesson of resignation and dignity from their king.</p>

<p>The crowd made noisy irruption into the boudoir; laughing,
shouting, and singing, and pushing the musicians in front of them.
The <i>Gendarmerie Nationale</i> lined up along the wall, guarding
the door.</p>

<p>The room was dark: only faintly illumined by tallow candles
guttering in the sconces of a tall, massive silver candelabra.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Ercourt had ostentatiously taken up his book again.
He did no more than look up when the first of the intruders pushed
the door open and, panting with excitement, stood for a moment
under the lintel, astonished because they had thought to find a
family group cowering and clinging together in an agony of fear and
only found Monsieur le Comte calmly reading a book and the vicomte
examining the handle of his hunting crop.</p>

<p>"What is it you want?" Monsieur le Comte asked calmly.</p>

<p>There was no immediate reply. The intruders were hoping to see
the black-coated man from Paris come to the fore and be their
spokesman, as he had been their chosen orator. But the government
agent, having fomented the mischief, was prudently keeping out of
the way. Nor was Notara there. The villagers felt momentarily
baffled. Fortunately, André the cripple was there. He elbowed his
way to the front, and with his twisted legs set well apart, his
hands thrust in the pockets of his ragged breeches, and chewing a
length of straw, he addressed the Comte d'Ercourt, but not before
he had spat on the Aubusson carpet just to show what a fine and
independent citizen of the Republic he was.</p>

<p>"We have come, D'Ercourt," he said, "in an entirely friendly
spirit, and only because we desire that you and your son there
shall join us in singing that wonderful new tune called the
'Marseillaise,' which it is incumbent on every son of France to
know and to sing. Isn't that it, comrades?" he concluded,
half-turning to his friends.</p>

<p>A murmur of assent came in response.</p>

<p>"Well said, André!" some of them declared.</p>

<p>"Just in a friendly spirit..."</p>

<p>"A fine tune, D'Ercourt. Let's hear you sing it."</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Ercourt looked calmly on the hunched-up figure of the
cripple and retorted quite simply: "A not unnatural desire. Let's
hear the tune. My son and I are ready to listen."</p>

<p>The flickering flames of the tallow candles cast eerie lights
and weird-looking shadows over the faces of André and the crowd,
twisting them into grotesque shapes and drawing fantastic shadows
on the wall of gnomelike faces with elongated noses and
outstretched chins.</p>

<p>At a word from the cripple the musicians once more intoned the
patriotic hymn:</p>

<p class="poem">"Contre nous de la tyrannie..."</p>

<p>"Sing! <i>nom d'un chien</i>, sing! All of you," André
commanded, and they did sing both loudly and thoroughly out of
tune. Alone Monsieur le Comte and his son sat there, silent and
aloof. Monsieur le Comte had drawn his book and the light closer to
him and, resting his elbow on the table, appeared once more
absorbed in reading. The vicomte drummed his fingers against the
table.</p>

<p>For the first few minutes André and the others glowered at the
two <i>aristos</i>, whose calm attitude was distinctly
exasperating. So much so, in fact, that André with a savage curse
suddenly snatched the book out of the comte's hand and hurled it
across the room against the wall.</p>

<p>"Did you not hear me say sing? <i>Nom d'un chien</i>," he
demanded, and raised his fist, as if ready to strike. In a moment,
François was on his feet and already stood between his father and
the cripple.</p>

<p>"You dare touch Monsieur le Comte, you insolent..."</p>

<p>André had instinctively drawn back a step or two&mdash;the
instincts of a lifetime are not easily ignored&mdash;but the very
next moment he had recovered his aplomb and, looking the vicomte up
and down, he indulged in loud ironical laughter:</p>

<p>"Dare?" he exclaimed. "Monsieur le
Comte?&mdash;Insolent?&mdash;Did you hear those words, citizens of
a free land?" And he flicked his fingers under the vicomte's nose.
"This do I dare, my fine bird&mdash;and this&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He untied the vicomte's cravat and the next moment was in the
act of tweaking his nose when François hit out with clenched fist
and struck him full in the mouth.</p>

<p>In an instant all was confusion. André had cried: "Malediction!"
as he staggered under the blow. He wiped his mouth with the back of
his hand. A streak of blood appeared between his lips. "Murder!
Outrage!" the women cried. The music had suddenly ceased; the
leader of the band had fled from the room. Monsieur le Comte and
his son were surrounded now by a crowd that meant mischief or
worse. The men of the <i>Gendarmerie Nationale</i> pushed their way
to the front and, wielding their bayonets as they would a bludgeon,
they soon brought the Comte d'Ercourt to the ground. He was an old
man, and though he fought valiantly to avert blows from every side,
he was quickly rendered helpless while the vicomte vainly tried to
come to his father's aid.</p>

<p>It was while confusion was at its height that an authoritative
voice called out from the rear of the crowd:</p>

<p>"If any killing's to be done here, I have first call."</p>

<p>It was Paul Notara. He had not joined in with the crowd and the
musicians when they started out for the château. The man from
Paris, scenting in this powerful personality a valuable tool for
his work of trouble, had engaged him in conversation. Notara
listened to him for awhile: but in thought he followed the other
men on their way to the château. He had not been within its
boundary walls since that memorable night four years ago. He
wondered how it looked now in its forlorn and neglected state. He
wondered also if Aline were there, and if all those hotheads would
molest her. And if she were molested, how she would act. There was
also the hope of seeing that miserable vicomte cowed, perhaps
maltreated&mdash;a pleasant sight for one who had suffered at his
hands.</p>

<p>So Notara abruptly turned his back on the man from Paris and
left him standing there, frowning and puzzled, while he made his
way over to the château. He arrived there some fifteen minutes
after the others, just in time to see the worst of the mêlée in the
boudoir; Monsieur le Comte in a precarious position on the floor,
and the vicomte seriously threatened by the infuriated cripple. He
elbowed his way through the crowd, past the valiant gendarmes, and
with a rough hand he dragged André aside and thrust him out of the
way. Then he stood facing the vicomte.</p>

<p>"We've not met, François, have we, for four years?" he said. "I
wonder if you have forgotten everything that I remember."</p>

<p>He brought his hand down heavily on the vicomte's shoulder. The
latter tried to shake him off, but Notara tightened his grip and,
peering into the other's face, he said slowly: "It is my turn now,
François, and I am going to give myself the satisfaction of
thrashing you&mdash;yes, thrashing you, my fine fellow, as one
thrashes a cur&mdash;within an inch of your life&mdash;as you had
me thrashed that time by your lackeys. Do you remember that?"</p>

<p>In his right hand he had a stout stick, and this he raised above
his head with a flourish and uttered a long mirthless laugh, whilst
the weight of his left hand on the vicomte's shoulder forced the
latter down on his knees.</p>

<p>"Well said, Notara," some of the men shouted&mdash;aye! and some
of the women, too. "The stick! That's what these <i>aristos</i>
want to bring them to their sense."</p>

<p>And down came Notara's stick with a dull thud across the Victome
François's shoulders. Monsieur le Comte had just sufficient
strength to utter a cry of helpless rage, whilst the vicomte,
manfully smothering a groan, put up his arms to ward the next blow
from his head. Down came the stick again.</p>

<p>A shout of joy and derision went up from the crowd.</p>

<p>"Well done, Notara!" the men and women shouted.</p>

<p>"<i>Le jour de gloire est arrivé!</i>" some of them cried, full
of excitement and of zest.</p>

<p>Up went Notara's stick once more. The flickering candlelight
distorted his face, making it look like that of some demon of rage
and of spite. He was deathly pale, but his movements were slow and
deliberate. His was the calm fury, the white heat of an
overwhelming passion. Even the most ignorant and loutish amongst
that crowd knew that he meant to strike and to strike again until
his victim had paid for past offences with his life.</p>

<p>It was during the tense silence which preceded that third blow
that a <i>portière</i> which concealed a second door was pushed
violently aside and a woman's piercing shriek rang out of the
darkness:</p>

<p>"Holy Virgin! François! Father!"</p>

<p>The room on which this door and <i>portière</i> gave was on a
higher level than the boudoir; two steps gave access to it. Aline,
motionless with horror, stood on the top of those steps for the
space of a second or two. From where she stood she could see
everything&mdash;her father on the ground, her brother at Notara's
feet, the upraised stick, Notara's face, distorted and
grotesque.</p>

<p>Her father! her brother! The horror in her had turned her sweet
young face as if to stone. With dilated eyes she stared down at the
awful scene, and the men and women who were there, savage and
lustful though they had been but a few seconds ago, were themselves
aghast, or perhaps moved to pity at sight of the girl. Thus for a
moment or two an awed silence held sway in the crowded room&mdash;a
silence during which Paul Notara and Aline looked into one
another's eyes.</p>

<p>Four years had gone by since Paul had looked upon the woman whom
he had so madly worshipped, and something of that reverence with
which he had regarded her in the past seemed to struggle back into
his heart. The vengeful hand which had brandished the stick dropped
to his side, and his lips murmured a half-articulate word&mdash;her
name&mdash;"Aline!"</p>

<p>Aline said nothing. After that first cry of horror not a sound
had come to her lips. Only her eyes, when first they rested on
Notara, told him that she, too, remembered. Did they plead, or did
they command? Certain it is that after those few tense seconds
Notara's glance fell away. With a muttered word of scorn he
released François, and then turned to the crowd.</p>

<p>"Leave these people alone," he commanded; "it is better we let
the government in Paris deal with them."</p>

<p>His words broke the spell which had so unaccountably descended
upon them.</p>

<p>Murmurs of protest rose from the malcontents. They had not come
all this way&mdash;had not worked themselves up into a passion of
resentment&mdash;to be thus sent about their business, unsatisfied.
No, not even by Paul Notara, their avowed friend and leader. He had
not, it seems, forgotten his schoolmaster days, when he drilled
little boys into submission. But they were men, not boys, and these
D'Ercourts were <i>aristos</i> and enemies of France. Were they to
be allowed to continue plotting against the liberties of the
people?</p>

<p>And Notara himself? Was he turning traitor, too? It looked like
it, when suddenly, at a word from that D'Ercourt girl, he robbed
them all of their revenge.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, though they murmured and protested, they were
on the whole inclined to let the matter drop for the
moment&mdash;to go away quietly, and to wait until they had thought
things over.</p>

<p>"We'll talk with the citizen agent from Paris," André the
cripple had muttered audibly. "We'll see what he says."</p>

<p>And this seemed to satisfy them. They threw suspicious,
glowering looks on Notara, who, however, paid no heed to them. He
seemed like a man in a dream, with that one dark eye of his still
fixed upon Aline&mdash;seeing nothing but her. Monsieur le Comte,
in the meanwhile, aided by his daughter, had struggled to his feet.
François d'Ercourt, with studied nonchalance, was readjusting the
set of his cravat, striving the while with all his might to hide
his face from Notara and the crowd, for in his eyes there glowed a
flame of deadly rage and hatred.</p>

<p>The musicians had started to play the good old tune:</p>

<p class="poem">"Jeanne, Jeannette, et Jeanneton<br>
Toutes trois jeunes et jolies..."</p>

<p>This had a further effect in calming the turbulent spirits. Some
of them nodded their heads sagely, and said:</p>

<p>"The citizen agent from Paris will know what to do."</p>

<p>And so, with the musicians once more in the van, they filed in
an orderly fashion down the monumental staircase.</p>

<p>The men of the <i>Gendarmerie Nationale</i>, carrying their
bayonets, followed the crowd.</p>

<p>Notara was last to leave.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>While men made the earth ugly with their hatred and their
passions, Nature was in one of her lovely moods. Once more the
autumn evenings were sweet and mellow, once more the velvety
blackness of cypresses was thrust above the sea of feathery pines:
once more the dead leaves of planes and elms made a soft swishing
carpet beneath the feet of the passers-by.</p>

<p>Aline d'Ercourt, still under the influence of all the horror
which she had experienced that afternoon, tried to find comfort and
to soothe her nerves in the solitary avenues of the park. In the
days that were gone, when she knew nothing of men and of their
passions, she would have been frightened to wander out in the
gloaming alone, but now that she had seen hatred and hardness of
heart at such close quarters, she felt that in her heart there was
no longer any room for cowardly fear. Men, even the most evil,
seemed to have done their worst with her. When presently she saw a
figure detach itself out of the gloom she was not afraid, not even
when in that lurking figure she recognized Notara&mdash;the man
whose hatred for those she cared for had killed all sense of mercy
and humanity in him. Aline was not afraid of him, but to speak with
him or to listen to him was the very last thing she could have
wished, and so&mdash;quite instinctively she turned away at sight
of him, ready to flee from him as she would from some powerful and
mysterious enemy.</p>

<p>But already he was close beside her, so close that stretching
out his hand he grasped her skirt and clung to it, so that she
could not run away.</p>

<p>"I entreat you not to be afraid, Mlle Aline," he said, and his
voice was soft and gentle: "and to grant me just a few words.
Believe me, I..."</p>

<p>The moon was at her brightest, and the shadows long and purple.
She could not see his face because it was in shadow&mdash;only one
shoulder and the massive leg, slightly bending at the knee.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," she said coldly. "Why should I be? It is not
in your power to do me more harm than you have already done."</p>

<p>"Harm? Great God! And I who would sooner die than harm as much
as one of your exquisite hands."</p>

<p>"Do not let us speak of that," she retorted. "I pray you,
release my gown. I would like to call at least this part private
and free from the presence of those who hate me and mine so
bitterly. I have little to care for now," she added, "except my
privacy."</p>

<p>She tried to disengage her skirt, but he clung to it so tightly
that she was helpless.</p>

<p>"You cannot go, Mademoiselle Aline," he said, "until you have
heard why I came out here this night. For the sake of your father
and your brother, you must listen to me."</p>

<p>At these words she stood still. He had spoken very quietly and
very softly, and his appeal in the name of her father and brother
had been spoken with compelling earnestness.</p>

<p>"Will you listen!" he insisted.</p>

<p>She did not reply, but her silence gave consent, and after a
moment or two he went on:</p>

<p>"I dare say you have seen, Mademoiselle, how the men listened to
me this afternoon. They look upon me as a leader because of the
wrong I suffered at your brother's hands. A few hours ago I was on
the point of avenging upon his person the terrible wrong that he
did to me..." A quick intake of the breath, and Paul Notara went on
more vehemently: "I am not speaking of physical wrongs. The wrong
that he did me was an outrage to my manhood and to my pride. From
that, I have never recovered. Through it, I have become less and
more than a man; even the love that I had for you&mdash;and God
knows that it was pure and holy&mdash;is no longer so now. But I
still love you, and for the sake of that love, I am willing to
forego my just desire for revenge. I can save our father, your
brother, and yourself from the fate which has overtaken so many of
your friends and kindred...."</p>

<p>At these words, which to Aline's ears sounded like a message of
hope from Heaven, she gave a quick little cry:</p>

<p>"Notara," she said impulsively, "if you will do that..."</p>

<p>"I am not a saint, Mlle Aline," he broke in coolly, "anything
but that. I am only a man with feelings, a man with hatred in his
heart just as much as with love. Your people before then had looked
on me as little better than a beast of burden, created for the sole
purpose of toiling so that they might rest, of labouring and
suffering so that they might enjoy. But we won't go back on that
now. As I have told you, I am willing to forgo my revenge, I am
willing to help those whom you love for the sake of the past love
which I bore you, but it is on one condition." He paused, and Aline
made no reply. A silence seemed to have fallen over Nature, only
the tender murmuring of the wind in the dying leaves of the planes
broke the mysterious hush which held sway in the park. For two or
three minutes these two stood there, silent, facing one another,
each knowing that the other understood. Aline felt the tears come
to her eyes, she marvelled if God willed her to make this sacrifice
for the sake of those she cared for. She knew well enough what
Notara meant when he spoke of a condition, and she wondered whether
she had it in her to give up everything which she held most
dear&mdash;her honour, her pride, her love&mdash;to this creature
who was her enemy. And while every thought in her brain seemed
annihilated save that one&mdash;the power of sacrifice&mdash;her
ears caught the far-off sound of a sweet instrument, the gentle
murmuring strain of a song of old France&mdash;plaintive and
appealing&mdash;one that spoke of home and joy and love. The sound
was so sweet and sad that Aline but her hands to her face and
allowed the tears to trickle through her fingers.</p>

<p>Notara shrugged his shoulders. He was long past the time when
women's tears had the power to move him. "I think those tears mean
consent," was all that he said. "I think you will be wise to
accept. I have a great deal of influence in this neighbourhood, I
can find the means to convey your father and your brother from here
to Grenoble and thence over the Swiss frontier, but that will only
be if you will pledge yourself to be my wife and come with me
to-morrow before the <i>maire</i> of Thiers, when I shall pass a
ring over your finger. Whether you will be happy with me will be a
matter for yourself to decide. My love for you may have undergone a
change, but it is not dead, and I will do my best that you do not
regret the step which you will have taken for the sake of your
father and your brother."</p>

<p>Aline's hands dropped from her face, she looked straight at
Notara. By the light of the moon she could see his pale, ugly face,
with the empty socket caused by her brother's blow. Somehow there
was something in that terrible wound which told her more plainly
than words could do, that to appeal to this man who had suffered so
much at her brother's hands, would indeed be useless. He had so
obviously spoken his last word. Was the sacrifice beyond her power,
she wondered?</p>

<p>"I must think," she murmured feebly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "you can think until to-morrow. But only until
then. The whole village&mdash;the women as well as the
men&mdash;are incensed against your people. With great difficulty I
held them back to-day. In a day or two I might be powerless and we
might all of us perish together. You must do as you think best. We
have twenty-four hours before us, perhaps less: but if within that
time you have become my wife, I will see to it that your father and
your brother are safely over the frontier. You, of course, will be
safe with me...always."</p>

<p>He allowed her skirt to slip out of his hand. For a moment it
seemed as if he would raise it to his lips&mdash;as he had done
that evening four years ago. Aline wanted to say something to
him&mdash;what, she knew not&mdash;but something kind, for he
seemed so gentle now and looked so sad.</p>

<p>He had suffered&mdash;God in Heaven! how he must have suffered!
And at her brother's hands. Aline remembered everything
now&mdash;that night in this same dark and solitary avenue, how
gentle he had been then, how almost reverential, and for that
avowal of love which could not have been an insult, even to a
queen, he had been punished like a dog! An overwhelming feeling of
pity welled up in her heart for him&mdash;pity the tender, and
kinsman of love. She wanted to keep him back, to hear him speak
again, to hear him tell her that he forgave her for what her
brother had done. But already the shades of the evening had
enfolded his tall, massive figure. Soon he disappeared out of her
sight. From far away the plaintive song still reached her ear.</p>

<p>Silent and thoughtful&mdash;not altogether unhappy&mdash;Aline
went slowly back to the château.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>It was on this same evening, after the turbulent expedition to
the château, and about an hour after Aline d'Ercourt's interview
with Paul Notara in the park, that Sir Percy Blakeney and his
friends&mdash;all of this still in the ragged coats and breeches of
itinerant musicians&mdash;had met in the derelict cottage off the
main Thiers-Roanne Road and listened to Lord Fanshawe's story of
his early acquaintance with the d'Ercourts and with Paul
Notara.</p>

<p>Something in the young man's attitude, ever since the members of
the league had turned their activities to this corner of the
Lyonnais, had induced the chief to ask for this explanation. He
only knew vaguely that Fanshawe had in the past been acquainted
with the d'Ercourts, that he even had been, and still was, in love
with Aline: it was, in fact, owing to rumours transmitted to him by
Fanshawe that he decided to turn his attention to Thiers and its
neighbourhood, here to seek out those who might need his help and
that of the League. There were those in these remote districts of
France&mdash;men and women, young and old&mdash;who, have led a
secluded life, God-fearing and simple-minded, had for some
unexplainable reason been singled out by the revolutionary
government for persecution. In the desire to enlist the support of
agriculturists and peasants, the Terrorists had done their best to
arouse the cupidity of these ignorant people by wild promises of
untold wealth to be derived from expropriation of the land.</p>

<p>It was always the business of the League of the Scarlet
Pimpernel to discover where such persecution was rife, where there
were innocents likely to suffer, and where active help would be
most needed. Fanshawe had spoken of the neighbourhood of Thiers, of
the d'Ercourts and others, and had said quite enough to arouse the
sympathy of his chief.</p>

<p>But Blakeney was too shrewd an observer of human nature to be
satisfied with Fanshawe's vague hints of former acquaintanceship
with the d'Ercourt family. As soon as he and his followers arrived
in the neighbourhood he scented the hatred and resentment which
existed in the village against the d'Ercourts. He heard various
scraps of gossip about this Paul Notara, about the Vicomte François
and about Aline, a young girl, who obviously was one of those
innocents on whom injustice, born of blind resentment, would fall
most heavily.</p>

<p>He questioned Fanshawe who, pressed to tell the whole story,
poured out into the sympathetic ear of his chief and his friends
the epic of his love for Aline, of Notara's wrongs and of the fears
and jealousies which wrought such havoc in his own soul.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour or so after the young man had concluded his
story, Blakeney rose and went out of the cottage. Lord Anthony
Dewhurst was on guard outside, in case night hawks with prying eyes
and ears came too near to the derelict cottage.</p>

<p>"Go inside, Tony," Blakeney said to him. "I'll stay out here. I
want to think things over for awhile. Fanshawe's story...you heard
it?"</p>

<p>"Only fragments," Lord Tony replied. "But I can piece them
together easily enough....Blakeney, I wish you wouldn't..."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I mistrust that boy...more than ever after I heard his tale...
."</p>

<p>"Only fragments, Tony..."</p>

<p>"Enough to know that he is half-crazy with jealousy. If I have
read your intentions aright, Blakeney..."</p>

<p>"You have, Tony."</p>

<p>"You mean to get this man Notara away as well as the
d'Ercourts?"</p>

<p>"Of course. If he and Aline stay here, their life would not be
worth a week's purchase. She has by now made up her mind to accept
the bargain. I heard and saw her an hour ago in the park. The
moment I struck up a love ditty on this cracked old fiddle she
burst into tears. I know those symptoms," Sir Percy went on with a
gentle snigger. "She is half in love with the brute already. A fine
fellow, in a way. Too fine to be thrown to the wolves."</p>

<p>"Whilst that young Fanshawe is just a despicable young mole,"
Lord Tony concluded as in response to a mute command from his chief
he turned to go into the cottage.</p>

<p>"Between ourselves, that is also my opinion," Blakeney assented
lightly. "That is why I don't want him to marry Aline d'Ercourt.
She is too fine a woman to risk getting her heart broken by his
future infidelities...and he'd commit so many!..."</p>

<p>The interior of the cottage was in almost total darkness. Only
in one corner of the bare, half-empty room, a tallow candle
guttered in a pewter sconce. Through the tiny window, innocent of
frame or glass, the slanting rays of the moon entered mysterious
and ghost-like. There were six of them there&mdash;fine English
gentlemen, all of them, exquisites in London Society of the most
engaging type, keen riders to hounds, adepts at all the graceful
arts that make a man popular with his own sex, and admired by the
women. Yet here they were now, grimy and unkempt, dressed in a few
rags, heedless of the cool October evening and the freshening wind
that blew over the range of Forrez&mdash;and all of them as keen
after this new altruistic sport as they ever were at home after
stag or fox. They squatted on the bare boards of the floor, or
paced up and down the room eagerly discussing the position as
revealed to them by Lord Fanshawe&mdash;but only in whispers,
because these were the days when spying and anonymous denunciations
were encouraged and highly paid by the revolutionary
Government.</p>

<p>Alone Lord Fanshawe sat, somewhat apart from the others, in the
darkest corner of the room on one of the few wooden chairs that
furnished this derelict cottage.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand Blakeney..." he said at one moment: and his
voice sounded harsh, with a rasping note of discontent and
obstinacy.</p>

<p>"How do you mean, you don't understand him?" one of the others
retorted. "A more single-minded man never lived. He never seems to
think of anything else but how to help someone, and if he cannot
help, then how to comfort. My God! and with such a happy home as
he's got, such a marvellous wife...money, position...he's got
everything ...and look at him...."</p>

<p>"Well," Fanshawe put in sullenly, "don't we all..."</p>

<p>"Yes, now and again," the other insisted, "but Blakeney
practically lives in this God-forsaken country now...and with a
whole pack of these wolves lying in wait for him all the time. And
when there is work to be done, he never thinks of himself, only of
us...all the time."</p>

<p>How they loved their chief, all these young men! It was Sir
Andrew Ffoulkes who had spoken, and he was the most enthusiastic,
the most trusted amongst the members of the League. It was only
young Fanshawe ...</p>

<p>"He would do well to take counsel from some of us sometimes,"
the latter muttered, but only half-audibly. He was still almost
ashamed of his own disloyalty, and half-afraid to betray himself
before the others.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Lord Anthony Dewhurst came into the
room. He usually was the gayest of the party. A regular sportsman.
Perhaps not quite so sentimentally attached to Sir Percy as was Sir
Andrew Ffoulkes, for instance, and some of the others, but the
truest of the true, and with boundless admiration not to say
reverence for the chief, to whom he gave implicit obedience and
trust.</p>

<p>"What counsel would you be giving the chief on this occasion,
Fanshawe?" he asked lightly. "Blakeney, as you know, is always
ready to listen."</p>

<p>"Well," Fanshawe retorted in a tone of obvious exasperation, "we
all know that this afternoon Blakeney had a hand in letting poor
little Aline know what was going on downstairs when Notara was
giving the <i>vicomte</i> his well-deserved punishment. She was
safe enough, I imagine, in one of the remote wings of the château,
and why a young and sensitive girl should have been dragged into
that dirty business..." He checked himself, and as the others made
no comment, he went on sullenly:</p>

<p>"I knew at once that it was Blakeney who had found her and
brought her down, because, if you remember, he disappeared from the
room just when the fun was about to begin, and a few minutes later
there was poor little Aline..."</p>

<p>"Blakeney did right, as usual, for Aline was the only person who
could have stopped that abominable murder just then....Notara was
seeing red...and we could not have interfered without..."</p>

<p>"And the best thing that could have happened," young Fanshawe
broke in vehemently. "Why should not Notara have killed that
miserable François, he well deserved it and would have been off our
hands. We could have concentrated on Aline and perhaps her old
father..."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, Fanshawe," my Lord Hastings put in
earnestly. "I thought this Vicomte François was your friend. On
which side are you exactly?"</p>

<p>"I care nothing about any of them," the young man replied, "my
one thought is Aline, and I feel that by worrying about the rest of
them we are minimizing our chance of saving her."</p>

<p>It was while Fanshawe said this that Sir Percy Blakeney
re-entered the room though none of them noticed him at once, and he
stood for awhile in the doorway, listening.</p>

<p>"We are going to worry, my dear fellow," he now said, "and quite
considerably, too, about all of them. I have a plan in my head
which, with luck, will answer very well. I should certainly be
afraid that even if Notara's scheme came off..."</p>

<p>"Oh, he has a scheme, too, has he?" Fanshawe broke in with a
sneer.</p>

<p>"I should have called it a bargain," Sir Percy said quietly.</p>

<p>"The devil!" Fanshawe exclaimed. "What bargain?"</p>

<p>"To get the d'Ercourt family out of the country on condition
that Mademoiselle Aline becomes his wife."</p>

<p>"And do you mean to tell me...?" Fanshawe almost shrieked out in
an excess of rage, and his face reddened to the roots of his hair.
But he made a violent effort to regain control over himself, and
went on more coolly: "How do you know that this bargain was
proposed?"</p>

<p>"I heard Notara and Aline together in the park, about an hour
ago."</p>

<p>"Aline, of course, rejected this with scorn."</p>

<p>"Not she," Blakeney replied. "She burst into tears&mdash;that
was all."</p>

<p>"She loathes and hates Notara."</p>

<p>"She did, but she pities him now, and we all know that pity in a
woman's heart soon turns to love."</p>

<p>"Never while I live&mdash;" Fanshawe cried, but Blakeney put up
a quietly restraining hand.</p>

<p>"We are not here to discuss love idylls, my dear fellow," he
said, with just the first suspicion of authority in his voice:
"neither yours, nor Notara's. We are here to drag four innocents
out of the clutches of these murdering wolves."</p>

<p>"Four?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should have said three, for your friend François is
not innocent like the others. But we could not in all humanity
leave him behind and so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But who are the four?"</p>

<p>"The Comte d'Ercourt, his son and daughter&mdash;and the man
Notara."</p>

<p>"Notara? Surely you do not mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Risk our lives for that brute&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Not for a brute," Blakeney replied quietly, "for a man who has
suffered biter wrongs innocently&mdash;wrongs so bitter that for a
time his whole nature became warped&mdash;but a fine fellow for all
that. Already those murdering wolves are lying in wait for him. His
return to his finer self is not understood by them, and they are
already planning to destroy him. That is why we must get him out of
their clutches&mdash;as for risking our lives..."</p>

<p>He laughed, and shrugged his shoulders, his deep-set lazy eyes
wandered lovingly&mdash;proudly&mdash;to those half-dozen men who
were his willing helpmates in the tasks of mercy and self-sacrifice
which he spent his life in accomplishing.</p>

<p>"I have a plan in my mind," Sir Percy continued, after a slight
pause, "which will work very well and will be ridiculously easy,
once we can get the d'Ercourts and Notara away from this village
and on the road to Thiers. My plan works from there, and for it our
headquarters will be the half-derelict Maison Gaglio, which you all
know. The d'Ercourts we could get away straight from him, because
they would follow us readily enough: but how to get Notara away at
the same time puzzles me a little for the moment&mdash;he certainly
would not come with us willingly, so we shall have to..."</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly and paced up and down the narrow room for
a while, frowning and thinking. One of those daring plans of which
he alone possessed the secret was taking shape in his fertile
brain. The others hung on his lips. They knew they could trust
their chief to find a means to save those four people from the
cruel fate which without his help would surely overtake them:
presently they would each be told their task on the morrow and what
share each would have in the exciting sport. Fanshawe alone did not
look at the chief. He sat on one of the rickety chairs with his
hands buried in the pockets of his ragged breeches, pondering
sullenly.</p>

<p>"I think, I have the glimmer of an idea," Blakeney said
suddenly, "and, by God! I can promise you all more exciting sport
than you have ever had in all your lives. As for Paul Notara, I
reserve for him the surprise of his life."</p>

<p>"Whatever your scheme may be, Blakeney," Fanshawe said firmly
and coolly, "you must not reckon on me to help you with it."</p>

<p>At these words, spoken with the obstinacy of a contumacious
schoolboy, all eyes were turned instinctively on the chief. Such
words had never been spoken by any of them since the first
inception of the League, and even those who knew Blakeney most
intimately marvelled how he would take this outburst of rebellion
on the part of one of his youngest followers.</p>

<p>Thus an absolute silence fell upon them all, whilst Blakeney
from his full magnificent height looked down upon the flushed,
sullen face of young Fanshawe. He said nothing. Only to the keen
eyes of his two most intimate friends did there appear a very
slight drawing up of his fine figure, a drooping of the heavy lids
over the deep-set blue eyes, and a tightening of the firm lips. The
silence after a while became oppressive.</p>

<p>Fanshawe had not moved, and the look of sullen obstinacy on his
face became more marked. And suddenly the silence was broken in an
unexpected way by a ripple of merry laughter. Blakeney threw back
his head and laughed: the novelty of the situation had tickled his
sense of humour. This boy standing up to him, defying him, looking
like a sulky schoolboy daring his master to lay hands on him!...It
seemed as if a magic spell had been broken, and Blakeney said
lightly:</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling us exactly what you mean, my dear fellow? I
don't think any of us quite understood you when you said...What
exactly did you say, by the way?"</p>

<p>"I meant just what I said," Fanshawe replied dryly. "You may
formulate any scheme you please for the d'Ercourts; I think that
François is a miserable worm, but he is Aline's brother, and I will
do all I can to help you and the others to see the family safely
over the frontier: but I'll not be party to any such scheme if it
includes Notara."</p>

<p>"And how do you propose to take up that attitude of...what shall
I call it?&mdash;independence?" Blakeney queried, still speaking
lightly and with a gentle, ironical smile upon his lips.</p>

<p>"I will see Aline and..." Fanshawe began.</p>

<p>But Blakeney put up a gently restraining hand. "We'll talk of
that presently, my dear fellow; for the moment, I think, it is your
turn to keep watch outside. You will find the night cold and
soothing."</p>

<p>Fanshawe seemed to hesitate for a moment. He had tasted the
first sweets of rebellion and felt extraordinarily valiant and
important. He was prepared to follow up his advantage: but somehow
he had become conscious of an atmosphere of hostility about him:
perhaps, too, he felt a desire to be alone for awhile to think
matters over more deliberately. Certain it is that he appeared
willing to obey this minor command from his chief. He rose, but
gave no look to the others, and without another word went out into
the night.</p>

<p>After a second or two Blakeney followed him; he closed the
cottage door behind him lest the others should hear what he wished
to say. Once outside and alone with the boy, he put a kindly hand
on his shoulder, and by sheer force of will compelled those
sullen-looking eyes to look straight into his own.</p>

<p>"Now, listen to me, my boy," he said, speaking in a whisper and
with infinite kindness. "I am always ready to make any allowance
for jealousy. We are all friends together, and some of us have
suffered more than others in our affections: for these, and for
you, I have the utmost sympathy, but you must understand that there
is one thing I'll never tolerate and that is insubordination. We
have banded ourselves together in order to help suffering humanity,
in order to right wrongs and redress injustice. There is only one
way by which we can succeed in our work and that is by working
willingly and wholeheartedly together. You understood that, when
you joined the League in its very early days. More than that: you,
like the others, swore a solemn oath and gave me your word of
honour that you would follow me and obey me in all things. Think
all that over, my dear lad. You have got your two hours' watch
before you now. During those two hours, while you perform this
duty, the safety of us all is practically in your hands: so you see
how completely I trust you." After which, Sir Percy Blakeney gave
the young man's shoulder an affectionate pat, and then, with a
quickly suppressed sigh, he turned and went back into the
cottage.</p>

<p class="cpb">6.</p>

<p>For half an hour did young Fanshawe wrestle with the demon of
treachery&mdash;this much to his credit&mdash;one half-hour, while
a thousand mischievous imps seemed to be whispering in his ear.</p>

<p>He tried to persuade himself that there was nothing disloyal in
what he contemplated&mdash;rebellion, perhaps, against arbitrary
rules of conduct&mdash;but treachery, no! The chief was not
infallible, and in this case to risk valuable lives for that brute
Notara, was nothing short of madness. Fanshawe hated Notara, with
that most deadly hatred which is born of jealousy. Vaguely he
suspected a rival in that beggarly schoolmaster, who had dared to
make love to Aline&mdash;Aline was
young&mdash;sensitive&mdash;romantic. Woman-like, she might...Great
God! the very thought caused Fanshawe's nerves to tingle and send
his pulses beating. Anything rather than that. Jealousy had
reawakened his dormant love for Aline. She looked lovely, standing
under the lintel of the door, her small hand holding back the heavy
<i>portière</i>, her marvellous eyes fixed on that brute-beast,
till they had cowed him into showing mercy. At all risks, at all
costs she must be forcibly torn away from any possible influence
which Notara, through his very ruthlessness, might exert over her.
Women were such strange untamed creatures: the primeval cave-man
stood a far better chance with them than the most polished
gentleman.</p>

<p>Fanshawe cursed and swore under his breath&mdash;he swore to
himself that Notara should remain in France amidst the wolves, and
if the guillotine was to be his lot, he, Fanshawe, would not
grieve. But Aline must be got away...at all risks...at all
costs....</p>

<p>After half an hour of this fight with all the demons of jealousy
and wounded vanity, he finally gave in to them. By the light of the
moon he tore a page out of his pocket-book; on this he scribbled
rapidly, in French, with a hand that trembled visibly:</p>

<p class="letter">I am close by you Aline; for days I have planned
how to be of service to you. I am writing this by the light of the
moon. To-morrow, at dawn, you will receive this message of love and
hope. Do you remember this afternoon, when that ferocious brute
raised his hand against François, there were four vagrant musicians
there; I was one of them. Ragged and unkempt, I was even then
watching over you and planning how to serve you. Now my plans have
matured. One hour after sunset I will be waiting for you at the
postern gate beside the old stables. Trust yourself to me, and I
will not only see you safely out of the country, but I swear to you
by our love, which dwells in my heart more strongly than ever, that
your father and François will join us in Switzerland within the
week. You and I will make straight for Chambéry where Monseigneur
Barco, Bishop of Savoy, will unite us in marriage. In the name of
our love, Aline, I entreat you to trust me. Deadly danger threatens
you and yours if you do not.</p>

<p>He signed this with the pet name which Aline herself had
bestowed on him when first he made love to her: "Martin Pêchur." He
then folded the paper carefully and thrust it into the pocket of
his ragged breeches. Then he waited, pacing up and down outside the
cottage until a bank of clouds which had gathered over in the west
obscured the face of the moon. He reckoned that he had just a
little over an hour in which to accomplish his errand and to be
back here before the end of his watch, when one of the others would
come to relieve him.</p>

<p>There was, of course, the possible danger of one of
them&mdash;the chief perhaps&mdash;calling to him while he was not
there to respond. But that risk he had made up his mind to run.
After all, he was not a schoolboy fearing punishment for playing
truant. Anyway, he did take the risk, and when presently the bank
of clouds veiled the light of the moon, he stole noiselessly
away.</p>

<p>The village was no more than a ten minutes' walk, if he stepped
out. The bank of clouds had gathered volume, and the night now was
very dark. But Fanshawe knew his way well. With luck he would find
the man he wanted.</p>

<p>As soon as he reached the village he made his way to the
cabaret; the outer door was wide open, and he was able to peep in.
Despite the lateness of the hour the place was still crowded. The
events of the day had been so numerous and so exciting that they
had not yet been discussed in all their bearings. The women had
gone back to their homes, but the men stood or sat around the big
barrels that did duty for tables, talking volubly and drinking the
thin local wine. As usual there were the beggars, two or three
cripples, one with one leg, the other with one eye, the third with
an empty sleeve, going the round of the customers to pick up either
a sou or a drink.</p>

<p>Paul Notara was not there, but the man from Paris was very much
to the fore, sitting on a bench at the further end of the room,
with half a dozen privileged companions with whom he was talking
eagerly.</p>

<p>Fanshawe, looking as grimy and unkempt as any of the beggars,
leaned against the framework of the doorway for a moment of two
surveying the scene. One or two of the customers looked up at him,
but recognizing in the slouching, bedraggled figure one of the
itinerant musicians of this afternoon, paid no further heed to him.
One kindly person offered him a drink which he refused. A few
moments later a wretched, maimed creature, who had collected a few
sous and been given a mug of wine, hobbled out of the cabaret.
Fanshawe followed him, at some distance, until the cripple reached
the top of the village, well away from likely spies. Then Fanshawe
accosted him.</p>

<p>"Hey, <i>mon ami</i>."</p>

<p>The beggar halted, turned, and vaguely perceiving the
approaching figure through the gloom, muttered at once his
habitual, entirely mechanical: "Alms, kind friend. Alms for a poor
cripple, who..."</p>

<p>"Alms and more will you get from me, my friend," Fanshawe said
to him in a whisper: "if you will do what I ask."</p>

<p>"There's nothing I can do...how can I earn?...I can only beg, I
am maimed...helpless...."</p>

<p>"You can go up to the château for me...."</p>

<p>"It is far...and the hour late....They'll all be abed
there..."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow morning...in the early hours...you will find
Mademoiselle Aline...."</p>

<p>"Yes, sometimes she gives me alms, if Pierre or Yvonne..."</p>

<p>"You need not ask for alms. You will tell Pierre or Yvonne that
you have brought a message for Mademoiselle Aline, which will mean
life or death to her and her father and brother...."</p>

<p>"A message?"</p>

<p>"A letter which you will give her."</p>

<p>"And what'll I get if I do?"</p>

<p>"One piece of gold to-night, and another when you bring me back
the answer."</p>

<p>"Give me the letter," the cripple said eagerly. "Gold!...I have
not seen a piece of gold since..."</p>

<p>Fanshawe took a coin out of his pocket, also the letter.</p>

<p>"As soon as you have given this to Mademoiselle Aline you will
come here&mdash;to this spot&mdash;and sit on that corner stone,
begging as you always do until I come."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I'll do it," the cripple assented and put out his
maimed hand for the gold. "It is a terrible risk...for there are
spies...everywhere...but gold!...Name of a name...Gold!"</p>

<p>Fanshawe gave him the letter and the money. They had spoken in
whispers, and the night enclosed them as in a dark shroud. The
cripple, he knew, was wont to spend nights under the stars, under
shelter of a hedge or a haystack, or if the weather was unkind,
then inside some derelict barn or cow-byre. Even now as soon as he
had hidden the coin and paper somewhere inside his rags he hobbled
away, leaning on his crutch. Fanshawe soon lost sight of him: the
darkness seemed to close in around him like a mantle. A few drops
of rain fell, and a moaning, sighing wind came from over the
mountain tops. The young man shivered under his scanty rags: but
neither doubt nor remorse assailed him: "For Aline's sake," he
repeated under his breath once or twice. "Once she has pledged
herself to me, I shall know how to guard her against the wiles of
that brute Notara."</p>

<p>It never entered Fanshawe's head that he was behaving like a
traitor and a fool His jealousy had blinded him. Notara in his eyes
had become a rival&mdash;a dangerous rival&mdash;with a strange,
compelling power to wrest Aline's affections and force her to his
will, then how could it be treacherous or wrong to guard her
against such a destiny?</p>

<p>Never once did the young man look back upon the scene of his
crime. Had he done so he would even through the gloom have
perceived a crouching figure slowly lifting itself to its knees,
then to its feet and with stealthy steps follow in the wake of the
cripple. There was neither struggle nor noise&mdash;hardly a
smothered cry from the cripple when he felt himself seized from
behind, held tightly with one arm round his thin shoulders, while a
quick and sure hand sought and found the paper beneath his
rags.</p>

<p>The whole incident had lasted less than two minutes. After that,
silence and darkness held sway once more: only the patter of the
rain on the withered leaves of the planes broke the stillness of
the night. The cripple had started to whimper; under his rags found
the gold coin which still lay snugly there. He gave a sigh of
regret for the second coin which would not be his on the morrow,
but after all, the night had not been unprofitable and it was a
long tramp up to the château. With a final shrug of satisfaction he
made his way towards a thatched barn where he with a boon companion
were wont to find shelter on a wet night.</p>

<p>Lord Fanshawe in the meanwhile made his way back quickly to the
derelict cottage. Considerably less than an hour had gone by since
he left his post of duty. Everything appeared unchanged, and
yet...the young man was conscious of a feeling of aversion or of
awe, which? when first through the gloom he spied the square block
inside whose tumble-down walls sat the friends&mdash;the
chief&mdash;whom he had betrayed. Not a sound came from within.
Fanshawe found his way to a broken tree-stump just outside the
cottage door. Here he sat down and waited.</p>

<p class="cpb">7.</p>

<p>In the village cabaret the flickering tallow candles were
burning low. Some of the men had already paid for their drinks and
gone, others stood about preparatory to going. In the further
corner of the room the black-coated man from Paris was still
talking earnestly to André the smith, and to a few of his chosen
friends. All the beggars and hangers-on had long since
departed.</p>

<p>It was just at the moment when the man from Paris finally made
up his mind to say good night and to retire to the miserable little
room which the innkeeper's wife had got ready for him upstairs,
that a hunched-up figure of a man appeared in the doorway. He stood
under the lintel for a moment or two casting anxious eyes
around.</p>

<p>"Who are you? And what do you want?" Jacques the innkeeper asked
him roughly. "There's nothing more to be got here to-day."</p>

<p>Then looking more closely at the man he added:</p>

<p>"Have I seen your ugly face before?..."</p>

<p>The man did not answer, nor did he go away, and when Jacques
tried to push him off the doorstep he stood as firm as a rock.</p>

<p>The man from Paris hearing the slight scuffle looked round.
"What's all this?" he asked.</p>

<p>The man thrust out his long arm: in his clenched fist he held
what looked like a very dirty scrap of paper. "For you," he said
laconically.</p>

<p>After a second's hesitation the man from Paris came across the
room and took the paper from him. The others watched him while he
unfolded it, then drawing as near as he could to one of the
guttering candles he read what was written from his pocket, handed
them to Jacques and said:</p>

<p>"Give these to the man, also a drink of wine and a crust."</p>

<p>Jacques took the coins, poured out the wine, picked up a crust
from the table where the provisions were kept and then went to seek
the ragged messenger, whom he thought to find on the other side of
the door. But the man had vanished.</p>

<p>Then it was that Jacques suddenly recollected where he had seen
the man before.</p>

<p>"Why, if it wasn't that old musician of this afternoon..." he
said.</p>

<p>"Musician of this afternoon?" the man from Paris exclaimed. In
the letter which the beggar had handed to him there occurred the
words: "Do you remember this afternoon...there were four vagrant
musicians there. I was one of them."</p>

<p>"After him one of you," he cried. "Name of a dog, Jacques, you
should not have let the man go."</p>

<p>The night by now had waxed very dark, rain was falling: one or
two of the men went out and tried to peer through the gloom, to
listen to any footfall dying away in the distance.</p>

<p>But nothing could be seen or heard of the ragged fiddler who had
brought the mysterious letter. Crestfallen they came back to the
cabaret parlour. The man from Paris appeared terribly upset.</p>

<p>"Close the door, Jacques," he said impatiently, "and listen all
of you."</p>

<p>Jacques closed the outer door; he and the other men gathered
round the man from Paris who looked even more solemn and commanding
than was his wont.</p>

<p>"Matters here in Drumetaz," he began gravely, "have suddenly
assumed national importance, and it is my duty to warn you that
great events will occur within the next twenty-four hours. Listen
to this letter."</p>

<p>He unfolded the letter which the mysterious musician had brought
him and read it through carefully and aloud to the men. They
listened in silence.</p>

<p>When he had finished one of them asked: "What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"It means," the man from Paris replied, "that we are on the
track of that gang of English spies who your government have tried
to run to earth for over two years. They are some of the most
dangerous enemies of France, for they make it their business to
assist traitors in escaping from justice. It also means that that
d'Ercourt brood is up to the neck in treachery and in league with
the English spies, for this letter is addressed by one of those
devils to the girl Aline."</p>

<p>A murmur of horror went round the room. The poor ignorant
caitiffs did indeed believe every word the man from Paris said to
them. The latter continued to talk at great length, telling them of
all the misdeeds perpetrated by that abominable Englishman who was
a very devil incarnate; for his capture, dead or alive, the
revolutionary Government was prepared to give his entire weight in
gold. The murmur that went round the room was no longer one of
horror.</p>

<p>"What are we to do to get him?" they asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Two things you can do," the man from Paris replied. "Firstly
you can arrest the whole of the d'Ercourt crowd, and that
immediately before your intentions are bruited about in the
village. This letter is sufficient witness to their treachery: doth
it not prove that they are in league with the enemies of
France?"</p>

<p>They nodded their heads sagely:</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, they are traitors all of them," they murmured to one
another.</p>

<p>"And so is Paul Notara a traitor, in my opinion," André the
cripple put in spitefully. He had never liked Notara and was
jealous of his superior influence over the village folk. What a
chance to put such a rival out of the way.</p>

<p>"I promise you," the man from Paris rejoined, "that Notara will
also be dealt with according to his deserts. But we can always get
hold of him; the English devils only trouble about <i>aristos</i>,
it seems. For the moment we must concentrate on the d'Ercourt
crowd. And it is up to you, patriots all, to watch over them and
see that they do not escape the just punishment which awaits them
in Paris."</p>

<p>"Tell us what to do and we'll do it," they said with one accord,
through André the cripple who had become their spokesman.</p>

<p>"You will proceed to the château and effect the arrest of the
ci-devant d'Ercourt, his son and daughter. All night through you
will guard them on sight, but you will not answer any questions
they may put to you, nor enter into any explanations. At daybreak
you will bring them hither. I, in the meanwhile, will requisition
from the local farmers a couple of covered carts in which you will
convey the prisoners to Thiers. I, of course, have my own coach. In
Thiers the representatives of the government will deal with the
ci-devant as they think best."</p>

<p>"But what of the English devils?" they asked. "There's the
reward..."</p>

<p>"Which I make no doubt you will secure by capturing the noted
Scarlet Pimpernel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"There's the writer of this letter. He will have received no
reply, but even so he is certain to hang about the purlieus of the
château and try and communicate with the d'Ercourt woman. He won't
know that she will be on her way to Thiers by then. Anyway, two of
you just remain on the watch round about the walls of the château.
Any suspicious person you see loitering about there, you will
arrest and bring hither to await my return. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>They swore that it was, and nodded their heads eagerly: they
were all thinking of the reward.</p>

<p>"Straight to the château, then," the man from Paris said in
conclusion, "and make sure of your birds. But remember to guard
every possible ingress and egress, every possible way of escape.
Before the sun is high in the heavens we'll have three traitors on
the way which leads to the guillotine. As for the others...we shall
see."</p>

<p>They obeyed in silence and one by one filed out of the cabaret.
The man from Paris nodded quietly to himself, and gave a sigh of
satisfaction. He was pleased with his day's work. Few patriots had
ever fomented so much trouble in so short a time.</p>

<p>An hour later the arrest was effected in the château de
Montbrison. The Comte d'Ercourt, his son and daughter, roused from
their first sleep, accepted their fate with that stoicism and
dignity which did so much to awaken sympathy for their caste in
foreign countries. Even François showed neither the rage nor the
contempt which he felt. After the first question or two had been
met by studied silence on the part of this impoverished
<i>gendarmerie</i>, he and M. le Comte did not condescend to utter
another word. The terrible events of the afternoon had already
proved how useless any attempt at resistance would be. It could
only have ended once again in a disastrous loss of dignity.</p>

<p>The men who had come on this preposterous errand were men who in
the past had worked for wages in or about the château. Most if not
all of them had received many a kindness at the hands of Madame la
Comtesse and Mademoiselle Aline. But all that was now forgotten. In
these days of excitement and recriminations there was no time for
gratitude, no time to glance back into the past.</p>

<p>Aided by Pierre and Yvonne, M. le Comte and his family were soon
dressed. Yvonne had had the charity or merely the good sense to
brew some hot coffee. She and Pierre stood by, silent and
inscrutable, while their employers whom they had served all these
years were subject to the indignity of a constant watch by the men
all through the night. The hours went by leaden-footed. M. le Comte
was the only one who from time to time snatched a few moments'
sleep. Aline's glance travelled over the familiar objects, and in
that glance there dwelt the pathos of an everlasting farewell.</p>

<p class="cpb">8.</p>

<p>Down in the derelict cottage there was in truth nothing in the
manner of any of his friends or of the chief to rouse in Fanshawe
the fear that his escapade had been discovered. When his two hours'
watch were at an end, and he was relieved by my lord Hastings he
went back into the cottage, and although both Blakeney and the
others seemed somewhat curt and silent, Fanshawe was too deeply
preoccupied with his own affairs to pay more than passing heed to
this.</p>

<p>"Seek shelter where you can," Sir Percy now commanded to his
followers. "We have been too long in this cottage to risk spending
another night in it. Disperse for the night and we'll met to-morrow
as arranged soon after daybreak. Good night all, think of nothing
for the moment. The four people whom we have taken under our wing
will be safely in Switzerland or Belgium within the next
forty-eight hours, to this I pledge you all my word, and as you
know with your help we have never failed yet."</p>

<p>And so, despite the rain, despite their scanty clothing, these
six English gentlemen wandered out into the night to seek what
shelter they could under hedges or protecting barns. Fanshawe,
silent and sullen, went out with the rest. This was not the first
time that he, like the others, had wandered out like any vagrant to
seek shelter for the night, but on this occasion, with rebellion in
his heart and treachery already accomplished, he hated all these
discomforts which his own adherence to the League had imposed upon
him. He nodded a curt good night to the others and, like them, was
soon lost in the gloom.</p>

<p>But the next morning early he was at the cross-roads where he
had arranged to meet the cripple. As soon as the grey light of an
autumn morning had picked out the tips of feathery pine-trees on
the mountain-side he spied the hunched-up figure hobbling toward
him through the mist. Eagerly, he stepped along. The cripple had a
scrap of paper in his hand, Fanshawe almost tore it out of his
grasp.</p>

<p>It was a mere scrap and contained only half a dozen words: "I
will do as you wish," but to the young man it meant the realization
of all the dreams which had haunted him through the past sleepless
night. Aline would come away with him. She would meet him at the
postern gate to-night. Aline, lovely Aline loved him, or she could
not so readily have agreed to his wish. Never for a moment did
remorse touch him. What plans the chief had made he did not know,
but let the intrepid Scarlet Pimpernel and the others look to
themselves, and to the three men&mdash;unworthy all of
them&mdash;whom they had elected to protect. And if he, Fanshawe,
had by his action thwarted those plans, let their failure lie at
the door of him who had conceived them.</p>

<p>As for Notara, Fanshawe no longer feared him. Aline, once his,
would no longer think of that loutish schoolmaster, even if in
far-off England they met once more through the agency of the
Scarlet Pimpernel. Aye! let the others play their own game. What
cared he, Fanshawe, since he had got Aline.</p>

<p>The cripple stood by, waiting patiently until the young man
finally gave him the promised coin. Then the two men&mdash;the
young and the old, the crippled beggar and the wealthy
lord&mdash;each went their way and disappeared out of one another's
sight in the autumn mist.</p>

<p>It was about the same time that the unfortunate d'Ercourts were
marched down to the castle gates where two covered carts already
awaited them. M. le Comte and Aline were ordered to mount into one
of the carts, and François d'Ercourt in the other. Three men of the
<i>Gendarmerie Nationale</i> took their seats in each of the
carts.</p>

<p>The morning was raw and cold. Aline sat under the hood looking
for the last time on the land where her whole life had been spent.
The château perched on a hillock, surrounded by its age-old trees,
by its avenues and its park, already to her eyes appeared remote,
unreal, as it slowly faded away in the hazy distance.</p>

<p>Nothing was known in the village of what had happened in the
château. The secret of the arrest and of the mysterious letter had
been well-kept. Paul Notara, whose house lay some little way away
from the main block of cottages, had heard nothing. A few
labourers&mdash;men and women&mdash;out in the fields did perceive
the two covered carts winding their way slowly along the road. But
there did not seem anything very exciting in that, and after a
cursory glance in that direction they bent once more to their work,
whilst the farmers from whom the carts had been requisitioned had
been told to ask no questions and to hold their tongues: and in
those days, silence was more golden than it had ever been
before.</p>

<p>The halt at the cabaret was short. The coach in which the
government agent had arrived from Paris was ready and waiting when
the carts drew up at the door. A brief colloquy between the
self-constituted captain of the <i>gendarmerie</i> and the agent,
and then the latter gave the order to start. M. le Comte and
François had made an attempt to ask a few leading questions: they
had, they declared, the right to know by what right and what
authority their persons had been seized.</p>

<p>"By mine as representing the people of France and their chosen
government," the man from Paris had replied curtly.</p>

<p>To no further questions would he give an answer and here again
M. le Comte and even François quickly realized their own
helplessness and the loss of dignity which argument or resistance
would carry in their wake. What was happening to them had happened
to many of their friends and kindred, had happened even to their
King, their Queen, the royal family of Bourbons, who to them were
beings second only to their God. Then why not to themselves? Had it
not been for Aline, their resignation would have been even more
stoical.</p>

<p>It was close on ten o'clock when the cortège, now reinforced by
the coach from Paris, set out on the main Thiers Road. Aline sat
close to her father, and he had his arm round her shoulders. Of the
three men who were with them in the cart, one was driving the two
starved-looking nags, the other two sat in the bottom of the cart,
hugging their bayonets, the use of which they did not quite
understand. The coach, in which the man from Paris sat by himself,
led the way, the two wagons followed in its wake close by.</p>

<p>About half-way between Drumetaz and Thiers and some three
leagues from the latter town, there stands a house which had once
been the property of a certain Marius Holmes, a rich citizen of
Thiers, one of the early victims of the Revolution. The house which
had been appropriated by the State stood forlorn and derelict:
nominally it had been sold to a servant of the former owners, who
eked out a miserable existence in the lonely house by selling an
occasional glass of sour wine to the passers-by or giving a handful
of mouldy corn to their nags. It was a usual halting-place for
travellers, between Roanne and Thiers.</p>

<p>Soon after midday that house came in sight. The man from Paris
put his head out of the window, and called to his coachman:</p>

<p>"We will not halt, Pierre: I want to make Courpière, where we
can dine."</p>

<p>Pierre whipped up his horses, and the small cortège continued to
rattle at full speed along the road when suddenly Pierre spied in
the near distance a group of men advancing towards him. There were
some half-dozen of them, and they held the whole width of the road.
They were dressed in military uniform, with feathers in their hats:
this much did Pierre see in the distance. As they came nearer he
saw that they wore tricolour sashes round their waist, and cockades
in their hats, also that they carried swords, and that the buttons
on their uniforms were beautifully polished and shone like
gold.</p>

<p>When they were within fifty paces of Pierre's horses, one who
appeared to be their captain put up his hand and cried in a loud
voice:</p>

<p>"<i>Halte! Au nom de la République, une et indivisible!</i>"</p>

<p>That, of course, was a command which could not be disobeyed.
Pierre pulled up his horses. The drivers of the covered carts did
likewise.</p>

<p>The man from Paris put his head out of the window once more:</p>

<p>"What is it? he asked, ready to pulverize with his wrath whoever
interfered with his progress. But he recognized the uniform of the
Garde Nationale, and his tone was quite conciliatory as he
reiterated:</p>

<p>"What is it, Citizen Soldier? My name is Rollon. I am on a
mission here for the government. I have my papers to
show&mdash;"</p>

<p>The captain of the Garde Nationale had ordered his men to halt.
He himself came up to the coach and respectfully saluted the agent
of the government.</p>

<p>"Not necessary, Citizen," he said. "My orders are to look out
for you, and to see to your safety if necessary."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Citizen Soldiers. Then may we proceed? Everything
is in order. We have not been molested."</p>

<p>"And you have your prisoners safely under surveillance, Citizen
Rollon. Your pardon if I seem interfering. But my
orders&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not apologize, I pray you, Citizen. We are all of us
soldiers these days, and know the value of orders. My prisoners are
safe, I think you, and under guard&mdash;"</p>

<p>The captain took a rolled parchment from inside his tunic and
appeared to study its contents for a minute or two:</p>

<p>"I have orders," he said, referring to the scroll, from which
dangled a heavy seal, "to inquire if you have effected the arrest
of one Paul Notara, at one time schoolmaster in the village of
Drumetaz, now suspected of treasonable traffic with the enemies of
the people."</p>

<p>"Paul Notara?" the man from Paris ejaculated, "but
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is one of the blackest traitors known to the agents of the
government," the captain of the Garde Nationale rejoined coolly.
"My orders are that you, Citizen Rollon, will be escorting him from
his native village to Thiers, where you will hand him over to the
proper authority."</p>

<p>"He is known to have many sympathizers in the neighbourhood, who
might mediate a coup in his favour. That is why I and my men have
been ordered out to meet you and watch over your safety."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Citizen Captain," the man from Paris said,
slightly upset by this contretemps, "but Notara has not been
arrested&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not been arrested?" the other ejaculated with a frown. "Then
whom have you got here under escort, Citizen Rollon?" he asked in a
loud, distinctly authoritative tone, and drew up his tall figure to
look down disapprovingly on the agent from Paris.</p>

<p>"A ci-devant d'Ercourt with his son and daughter," replied the
latter in a very much subdued voice&mdash;"traitors and
<i>aristos</i>. We have proof&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is all very well," the captain of the guard broke in
impatiently. "But it is Notara whom you have been ordered to
arrest."</p>

<p>"I had no such orders&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will find it difficult to substantiate this statement,
Citizen Rollon," the soldier remarked dryly. "You know what they
are up in Paris. They send out an order&mdash;if it is not
executed, there is trouble for someone, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he made a significant gesture with his hand across his neck.
The man from Paris felt a cold shiver running down his spine.</p>

<p>"If we could get fresh horses," he said, "some of the men, or
you yourself, Citizen Captain, could go back to Drumetaz. Paul
Notara is easily found&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not he. He will have slipped through your fingers by
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you, Citizen Captain&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"What? Go after him? Those are not my orders. And I don't know
the fellow. I might arrest the wrong man."</p>

<p>"If only we could get fresh horses&mdash;" the man from Paris
reiterated anxiously. "It is only a matter of three
leagues&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that all?" the captain of the guard remarked. "I don't know
the country, but three leagues&mdash;why that is only a matter of
two or three hours there and back. There are a couple of horses in
the house yonder. We can requisition those." And he indicated the
lonely house by the side of the road.</p>

<p>"I have half a dozen men here," the man from Paris explained
eagerly, "whom I enrolled into our new <i>Gendarmerie
Nationale</i>. With fresh horses&mdash;as you say we can
requisition them&mdash;they can be here with Paul Notara in less
than three hours, allowing for every contingency."</p>

<p>"Well," the soldier rejoined, "in my opinion you will do wisely
to send some men along. I can lend you two of my own, and in the
meanwhile if you will honour me, Citizen Rollon, by drinking a
glass of our wine with me in yonder house, you will not perhaps
find time hang too heavily on your hands. Your volunteers can join
up with my men over a few litres of that same sour wine. As for
your prisoners," he concluded with a pleasant laugh, "methinks we
are in sufficient numbers to see that they do not escape."</p>

<p>The agent form Paris felt very much relieved in his mind. There
had been a moment during his conversation with the captain of the
guard when he feared that there might be trouble for him over this
Notara affair. Not that he had been guilty of negligence. He had
not received any orders, and though he intended to keep an eye on
Paul Notara, he did not think that the time was yet ripe for his
arrest, but apparently the authorities in Paris thought
otherwise.</p>

<p>It was finally decided that three of the men from Drumetaz,
accompanied by two soldiers of the Garde Nationale, should go back
to the village in one of the covered carts, and bring back Paul
Notara with them. The horses were duly requisitioned from the
caretaker of the Holmes' house, no questions being asked as to
where these horses came from&mdash;stolen, no doubt&mdash;but
anyway they were fresh and well-fed. The man from Paris gave all
instructions to his volunteers. The prisoners were ordered to get
out of the wagons: they were conveyed into the house: a room was
found for them to sit in from which escape would be impossible, and
finally the covered cart with its fresh pair of horses was sent
merrily on its way.</p>

<p class="cpb">9.</p>

<p>Paul Notara, the village schoolmaster, who had not age-old
traditions of dignity and caste to keep up, put up a strenuous
fight when in the afternoon of that same day three of his own
friends, together with a couple of men wearing the uniform of the
Garde Nationale, invaded his little home and demanded possession of
his person. Two of the men from the village, who had tricolour
badges on their arms, and carried bayonets which they did not know
how to use, laid hands on him, and he knocked them down. He fought
like a lion and like a lion was powerful, but in the end he was
brought to the ground by the men in uniform: his arms were strapped
together behind his back, and he was flung somewhat roughly into
the bottom of a covered cart. His friends from the village had no
feelings of tenderness for him just then. To keep him from kicking,
which he persistently did, they put their feet on him, and as he
was still showing fight one of the men in uniform gave him a crack
on the head which eventually calmed him, and partly deprived him of
consciousness.</p>

<p>It was half-past four in the afternoon when the driver of the
cart finally pulled up outside the Holmes' house. Here he and the
two other valiant gendarmes had made sure to find their comrades
and also the black-coated man from Paris. But instead of these
familiar faces, they saw before them the captain of the Garde
Nationale who, taking no notice of them or of the prisoner, at once
spoke some sort of gibberish to the two men in uniform who had
jumped down lightly from the cart. Before they had time to recover
from their surprise they were seized and pushed and dragged into
the house. In the struggle they quite forgot to use their bayonets:
they were bewildered, helpless, and as the interior of the house
was very gloomy, they could not even see exactly what was
happening, nor whither they were being led. But after a moment or
so they were conscious that they were being unceremoniously dragged
down some stairs, thrust into a room which smelt of wine and which
was very nearly pitch dark. They were thrown rather violently
forward and this caused them to stumble and fall on their knees.
Whilst they struggled to their feet they heard the door slammed
behind them, and a key turned in the lock: then loud and merry
laughter, retreating footsteps and nothing more.</p>

<p>A wan, grey light was peeping in shyly through a grated window
high up in the wall. Gradually the eyes of these valiant gendarmes
because accustomed to the gloom. They saw that they were shut into
what looked like a cellar, and that in a distant corner of the
place there was a litter of straw. On this litter reclined their
three comrades. They were fast asleep, and the sound of their
stertorous breathing broke what otherwise would have been an
unpleasant silence. The smell of sour wine was very insistent, and
there were three empty mugs lying on the floor, all of which went
to prove that these other three valiant gendarmes had been
prisoners here for some time and had employed that time pleasantly
for themselves. The three new-comers therefore felt it incumbent
upon them to follow so good an example, and we may take it that in
a very short while they, too, after copious libations of sour wine,
had found a rest on the litter of straw, and mingled their
melodious snores with those of their companions.</p>

<p>On the floor above, on the other hand, events and incidents were
of an entirely different nature. Paul Notara, still rather dazed
from the crack on the head which he had received, and the airless
drive beneath the feet of the gendarmes, allowed himself to be
dragged out of the cart quietly enough. He was then conveyed into a
sparsely furnished room, where he was left to meditate in quietude
on the strange events of which he had been the unwilling hero. In
an adjoining room the two men who wore the uniform of the Garde
Nationale, and who had helped to bring Notara hither were plying
their captain with questions. They were speaking English: a strange
enough proceeding on the part of men who wore the uniforms of the
newly created French Republic.</p>

<p>"I suppose he put up a fight?" the captain was asking.</p>

<p>"Like the very devil," one of the men replied.</p>

<p>"We had to knock him down, before we got him," added the
other.</p>

<p>"But what happened here?" they both asked, almost
simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Everything that we foresaw," the chief replied gaily. "As soon
as your wagon was out of earshot we seized hold of that villainous
agent, and of the three valiant pseudo-gendarmes. These three we
locked up in the cellar down below, where their three companions
have just joined them as you know. The black-coated villain I've
got locked up in an attic room upstairs. You should have seen him.
I don't think I ever saw a more ridiculous, futile, and ponderous
rage."</p>

<p>"But what about the owner of this tumble-down place?"</p>

<p>"A good sort," the chief replied: "but ground down by poverty. I
couldn't make him see the humour of the situation, but he liked the
colour of my money. Poor wretch, he would have sold his soul for
less. Anyway, he has agreed to release all the prisoners early
to-morrow morning. They might burst themselves with rage before
then, but will not die of inanition."</p>

<p>"And what about the d'Ercourts?"</p>

<p>The chief was silent for a moment of two: his earnest, deep-set
eyes reflected the sympathy which he felt for that sorely-stricken
family.</p>

<p>"Poor people," he said, "I don't think they quite realize yet
that they have found a haven at last. For three years and more they
have lived on the brink of a volcano, not knowing what day, what
hour, death would claim them. Aline, if you will believe me, had, I
am sure, made up her mind to accept Notara's proposals, and to
barter herself against safety for her brother and father. How
short-lived her own and Notara's safety would have been she doesn't
quite realize even now, and my impression is that in her heart she
already regrets that that bargain did not come off."</p>

<p>"You think that she has fallen in love with Notara?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. You should have seen the anxiety with which
she inquired after him. I tested her by hinting at the danger that
threatened him, and she turned grey to the lips.</p>

<p>"What an idyll!"</p>

<p>"Do not laugh, Tony: Notara has much good in him, and he
worships Aline d'Ercourt. Over in England he'll find some
employment as a teacher. He will marry Aline in spite of her
father's protests, and her brother's wrath, and they will be as
happy as two children whom resentment and hatred have never
touched. What think you, Ffoulkes, of the idyll?"</p>

<p>"That it shall have my blessing. I never trusted Fanshawe
myself: and he would have made such a bad husband for poor
Aline."</p>

<p>"By the way," Lord Tony put in, "what has become of
Fanshawe?"</p>

<p>"He is at the moment, I imagine, looking forward to meeting
Aline at the postern gate: I scribbled a few words which I gave to
his crippled messenger to give to him, because I wanted him to be
just where I could find him. There are two or three
self-constituted gendarmes lying in wait for him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poor brute&mdash;but in that case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say poor brute," the chief put in quietly. "I am going
straight back now to look after him. No harm shall come to
him&mdash;I'll see to that."</p>

<p>"You are going back?" Ffoulkes ejaculated. "Percy, you don't
mean that?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course I do. You don't think that I'm going to let that
boy perish here in this foreign land, just because he suffered from
a super-access of jealousy. Do you?"</p>

<p>Neither Lord Tony nor Sir Anthony Ffoulkes replied to that. They
knew the indomitable Scarlet Pimpernel far too well to argue with
him, where a question of mercy and self-sacrifice was on the
<i>tapis</i>. Fanshawe had sinned and grievously sinned, and by his
action had not only wellnigh ruined the plan which had for its
object the safety of the d'Ercourt family, but he had also
jeopardized the safety of his chief, and of his friends. Had he
been seen by one of the government spies giving the letter and the
money to the cripple on the previous night, the very lives of his
chief and his friends would have been in jeopardy, and at best all
would have been up with the plan for the safety of the d'Ercourts
and of Notara. Fortunately Blakeney had kept an eye on him and
followed him as far as the cabaret first, and then to the
crossroads.</p>

<p>"The great difficulty&mdash;the only real difficulty in fact,"
Blakeney went on, explaining to his friends, "was getting the
d'Ercourts first, and then Notara away from their own village,
where eyes made keen by hatred and cupidity were intent upon their
every movement. The only way to accomplish this was to make those
village idiots and that blatant government agent bring them along
here themselves. Now that we have them well away from Drumetaz we
can convey them easily enough to the Swiss frontier, by way of
Grenoble. All you have to do now is to march as far as Courpière.
You know the farmhouse where we spent a couple of days last
week?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The man is keeping eight or ten horses in readiness there for
you: also a few more of these uniforms. I will explain to our
friends, and also to Mlle Aline, that they will have to don the
uniforms. Ffoulkes will act as your captain, and I will in any
event be with you before noon to-morrow with young Fanshawe. I have
got the passports and necessary papers from our usual source, but I
don't think we shall require them, for we'll make such a fine
cavalcade and carry ourselves so boldly that no one will dare
interfere with a platoon of the Garde Nationale out on the road, in
the execution of duty. It won't be the first time," he went on with
his infections laugh, "that we have carried such a situation off
successfully, and I'll warrant ye that we are over the Swiss
frontier within forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>"And now," he concluded, "I'll have a little talk with our
friend Notara. In half an hour I'll have him as gentle as a lamb.
When he knows that Aline is of the party&mdash;well! I put it to
you all&mdash;how would you take the situation?"</p>

<p>And it did not take Sir Percy Blakeney, Bart., more than half an
hour to make the unfortunate schoolmaster understand what a
blessing from Heaven had descended upon him. The prospect of
journeying to Switzerland and thence through Belgium to distant
England, all in the company of Aline d'Ercourt, was one which
appeared to him like a journey through Elysian fields. Nor, it must
be admitted, was Aline averse to the prospect either. Ugly,
embittered as was Paul Notara, there was something about him, his
constant love, his gentleness allied to his just resentment which
had aroused her pity already, and in the heart of a woman of
Aline's temperament there is but a short step from pity to
love.</p>

<p>M. le Comte d'Ercourt took all the bewildering events of his
rescue and proposed journey to England with the same stoic calm
with which he had accepted his journey to a likely death. As to
Notara, he was still of very little account in his sight, so he
gave the ex-schoolmaster but few of his thoughts. But his gratitude
to his rescuers was real, dignified, and without bounds.</p>

<p>"The English," he said, "are the traditional enemies of my
country: but you, <i>milor</i>, have shown me to-day the most
perfect type of a gentleman and a sportsman it has ever been my
good fortune to meet. I thank you for the lesson as much as for
what you have done for me and mine."</p>

<p>After which the little party was ready to make a start for
Courpière: the prisoners entered one of the covered wagons: Notara
took the reins, and the six English gentlemen in the uniform of the
Garde Nationale marched alongside, as their escort.</p>

<p>Aline was the last to step into the cart. Just before she did
so, and when her father, her brother and Paul Notara were already
installed, she turned with a whole-hearted impulse to the man to
whom she owed so much.</p>

<p>"<i>Milor</i>," she said sweetly in the little bit of broken
English which she knew, "will you let me&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I will let you do nothing," Sir Percy broke in gaily, "but give
me a kiss."</p>

<p>She flew into his arms and kissed him on both cheeks.</p>

<p>"Be kind to my friend Paul," he whispered in her ear.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;but <i>milor</i>&mdash;" she retorted, while a deep
blush spread over her cheeks.</p>

<p>She sprang lightly up into the cart, and her eyes remained fixed
on his tall, elegant figure as it gradually receded from her sight.
She thought he would be coming, too. When she realized that he was
remaining behind she called impulsively to Lord Tony who was
marching close beside the cart.</p>

<p>"Let us go back! Oh, Holy Virgin! We must not leave him here.
<i>Milor, milor</i>! how could you leave your friend&mdash;? I'll
not go&mdash;Holy Virgin, protect him&mdash;"</p>

<p>She would have jumped out of the cart, only that her father held
her back.</p>

<p>"God will protect him, Aline," he said. "It is not for us to
question the actions of such a fine and gallant gentleman."</p>

<p>"He would not listen to you, if you did, sir," Lord Tony said
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"But when will we see him again?" Aline cried.</p>

<p>"Did you not hear him say that he will join us at Courpière
to-morrow&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"But how do you know that he will be able to come? How do you
know&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Because he said so," Lord Tony replied simply. "The Scarlet
Pimpernel never fails in what he has set himself to do."</p>

<p>Nor did he in the matter of Lord Fanshawe, who that same evening
lurked around the purlieu of the château de Montbrison, forgetful
of his friends, of his chief and of the oath which bound him to the
fortunes. The watchful eyes of two members of the Garde Nationale
were upon him&mdash;and so were those of the chief whom he had
betrayed.</p>

<p>But that is another story.</p>
