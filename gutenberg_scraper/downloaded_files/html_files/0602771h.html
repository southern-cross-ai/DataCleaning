<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>Foreword</h2>

<p>This is the story which Sir Percy Blakeney, Bart., told to His
Royal highness that evening in the Assembly Rooms at Bath.</p>

<p>The talk was of the recent events in France, the astounding fall
of Robespierre: the change in the whole aspect of the unfortunate
country: and His Royal Highness expressed his opinion that among
all those men who had made and fostered the Revolution, there was
not one who was anything but a scoundrel, a reprobate, a murderer,
and worker of iniquity.</p>

<p>Sir Percy then remarked: "I would not say that, sir. I have
known men&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You, Blakeney?" His Royal Highness broke in, with an
incredulous laugh.</p>

<p>"Even I, sir. May I tell you of one, at least, whose career I
happened to follow with great interest?"</p>

<p>And that is how the story came to be told.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Book I</h2>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>"In Heaven's name, what has happened to the child?"</p>

<p>This exclaimed Marianne Vallon when, turning from her wash-tub,
she suddenly caught sight of Andr&eacute; at the narrow garden gate.</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name!" she reiterated, but only to herself, for
Marianne was not one to give vent to her feelings before anyone,
not even before her own son.</p>

<p>She raised her apron and wiped her large, ruddy face first and
then her big, capable hands, all dripping with soapsuds; after
which she stumped across the yard to the gate: her sabots clacked
loudly against the stones, for Marianne Vallon was a good weight
and a fair bulk; her footsteps were heavy, and her movements
slow.</p>

<p>No wonder that the good soul was, inwardly, invoking the name of
Heaven, for never in all his turbulent life had Andr&eacute; come home
looking such a terrible object. His shirt and his breeches were
hanging in strips; his feet, his legs, the whole of his body, and
even his face, were plastered with mud and blood. Yes, blood! Right
across his forehead, just missing his right eye, fortunately, there
was a deep gash from which the blood was still oozing and dripping
down his nose. His lip was cut and his mouth swollen out of all
recognition.</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name!" she reiterated once more, and aloud this
time, "thou little good-for-nothing, what mischief hast thou been
in in now?"</p>

<p>Marianne waited for no explanation; obviously the boy was not in
a fit state to give her any. She just seized him by the wrist and
dragged him to her washtub. It was not much Marianne Vallon knew of
nursing or dressing of wounds, but her instinct of cleanliness
probably saved Andr&eacute; life this day, as it had done many a time
before. Despite his protests, she stripped him to the skin; then
she started scrubbing.</p>

<p>Soap and water stung horribly, and Andr&eacute; yelled as much with
impatience as with pain; he fought like a young demon, but his
mother, puffing like a fat pug dog, imperturbable and energetic,
scrubbed away until she was satisfied that no mud or dirt
threatened the festering of wounds. She ended by holding the
tousled young head under the pump, swilling it and the lithe,
muscular body down with plenty of cold water.</p>

<p>"Now dry thyself over there in the sun," she commanded finally,
satisfied that in his present state of dripping nudity he couldn't
very well get into mischief again. Then, apparently quite unruffled
by the incident, she went back to her washtub. This sort of thing
happened often enough; sometimes with less, once or twice with even
more disastrous results. Marianne Vallon never asked questions,
knowing well enough that the boy would blurt out the whole story
all in good time: she didn't even glance round at him as he law
stretched out full length, arms and legs outspread, as perfect a
specimen of the young male as had ever stirred a mother's pride,
the warm July sun baking his skin to a deeper shade of brown and
glinting on the ruddy gold of the curls which clustered above his
forehead and all around his ears.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful boy!" strangers had been heard to exclaim when
they happened to pass down the road and caught sight of Andr&eacute;
Vallon bending to some hard task in garden or field.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful boy!" more than one mother in the village had
sighed before now, half in tenderness, half in envy. And "Andr&eacute;
Vallon is so handsome!" tall girls not yet out of their teens would
whisper, giggling, to one another. If Marianne Vallon's heart
swelled with pride when she overheard some of this praise, she
never showed it. No one really knew what went on behind that large
red face of hers, which some wag in the village had once compared
to a bladder of lard. People called her hard and unfeeling because
she was not wont to indulge in those "<i>Mon Dieu!</i>'s" and "<i>Sainte
Vierge!</i>'s" when she passed the time of day with her neighbours, or
in any of the "<i>Mon chou</i>"'s and "<i>Mon pigeon</i>"'s when she spoke to her
Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p>She just went about her business in and around her cottage, or
at the ch&acirc;teau when she wanted up there to do the washing,
uncomplaining, untiring, making the most of the meagre pittance
which was all that was left to her now of a once substantial
fortune. Her husband had died a comparatively rich
man&mdash;measured by village standards, of course. He had left his
widow a roomy cottage, with its bit of garden and a few hectares of
land whereon she could plant her cabbages, cultivate her vines,
keep a few chickens and graze a cow. But, bit by bit, the land had
to be sold in order to meet the ever growing burden of taxes, of
seignorial dues, to be paid by those who had so little to others
who seemed to have so much, of tithes and rents and rights, all
falling on the shoulders of the poor toilers of the land, while the
<i>seigneurs</i> were exempt from all taxation. Then came two lean
years&mdash;drought lasting seven months in each case, resulting in
a total failure of the crops and poor quality of the wine. Andr&eacute;
was ten when the last piece of land was sold, which his father had
acquired and his mother tended with the sweat of her brow; he was
twelve when first he saw his mother stooping over her own washtub.
Hitherto, Annette from down the village had come daily to do the
rough work of the household; then one day she didn't come. Andr&eacute;
took no notice. It was nothing to him that at dinner-time it was
his mother who brought in the soup tureen, that it was she who
carried away the plates and the knives, and that she disappeared
into the kitchen after dinner instead of sitting in the old wing
chair sipping her glass of wine, the one luxury she had indulged in
of late. Annette or Maman, what cared he who brought him his
dinner? He was just a child.</p>

<p>But when he saw his mother at the washtub with a huge coarse
apron round her portly person, her sleeves tucked up above those
powerful arms, the weight of which he had so often felt on the rear
part of his person when he had been a naughty boy, then he began to
ask questions.</p>

<p>And Marianne told him. He was only twelve at the time, and she
did not mince matters. The sooner he knew, the better. The sooner
he spared her those direct questions and those inquiring looks out
of his great dark eyes, the sooner, she thought, would he become a
fine man. So she told him that the patrimony which his father had
left in trust for him had all dwindled away, bit by bit, because
the tax collector's visits were getting more and more frequent, the
sums demanded more and more beyond her capacity to pay. There were
the imposts due to the seigneur, and the <i>tallage</i> levied by the
King; there were the rates due to the commune, and the tithes due
to the Church.</p>

<p>Pay! Pay! Pay! It was that all the time. And two years' drought,
during which the small revenues from the diminished land had shrunk
only two palpably. Pay! Pay! Pay! And there were the seignorial
rights. No corn or wine or live stock allowed to be sold in the
market until Monseigneur's wine and corn and live stock, which he
wished to sell, had all been disposed of. No wine press or mill to
be used, except those set up by Monseigneur and administered by his
bailiffs, who charged usurious prices for their use. Pay! Pay! Pay!
It was best that Andr&eacute; should know. He was twelve&mdash;almost a
man. It was time that he knew.</p>

<p>And Andr&eacute; had listened while Maman talked on that cold December
afternoon three years ago, when the fire no longer blazed in the
wide-open hearth because wood was scarce and no one was allowed to
purchase any until Monseigneur's requirements were satisfied. Andr&eacute;
had listened, with those great inquiring eyes fixed upon his
mother, his fingers buried in the forest of his chestnut curls, and
his brows closely knit in the great endeavour to take it all in. He
wanted to understand; to understand poverty as his mother explained
it to him: the want of flour with which to make bread, the want of
wood wherewith to make a fire, even the want of a bit of thread or
a needle, simple tools with which his breeches and
shirts&mdash;which were forever torn&mdash;could, as heretofore, be
mended.</p>

<p>Poor? Yes, he was beginning to understand that he and Maman were
now poor as Annette and her father down in the village were poor,
so that Annette had to go and scrub floors in other people's houses
and wash other people's soiled linen so as to bring a few sous home
every day wherewith to buy salt and bread. Not that this primitive
idea of poverty worried the young brain overmuch. It was not like a
sudden descent from affluence to indigence. It was some time now
since his favourite dishes had been put upon the table and since he
had last wore a pair of shoes. The descent into the present slough
of want had been very gradual, and, childlike, he had not noticed
it.</p>

<p>Nor did his mother's lengthened homily make a very deep
impression upon his mind. From a race of children of the soil he
had inherited a sound measure of philosophy and a passionate love
of the countryside. While he could run about in the meadows, or
watch the rabbits at evening scurrying away across the fields,
while he could pick black berries in the hedgerows and gather the
windfalls in the neighbouring orchards, while he could scramble up
the old walnut trees and furtively touch the warm smooth eggs in
the nests among the branches, he was perfectly happy.</p>

<p>What he didn't like was when Marianne set him to do the tasks
which used to devolved on Annette. He didn't like scrubbing the
kitchen floor, and he hated wringing out the linen and hanging it
up to dry. But it never as much entered his dead to disobey. Mother
was not one of those whom anyone had ever though of disobeying,
Andr&eacute; least of all. She was large and fat and comfortable,
and&mdash;especially in the olden days&mdash;she loved a good joke
and would laugh heartily till the tears rolled down her fat cheeks,
but she knew how to use the flat of her hand, as Andr&eacute; had often
learned to his cost. She was not one of those who believed in
sparing the rod, and many a time had Andr&eacute; gone to sleep on his
narrow plank bed lying on his side because it hurt him to lie on
his back.</p>

<p>But the fear of his mother's heavy hand did not really keep him
out of mischief. As he grew older the desire for mischief grew up
with him. A vague sense of injustice would, moreover, inflame that
desire until it led him to acts which caused not only Mother's hand
to descend upon him, but, also, of a certain hard stick, which was
very painful indeed. That time when he chased Lucile Godart, the
miller's daughter, all down the road and then kissed her in sigh of
Hector Talon, her fianc&eacute;, who was short, fat, and bandy-legged, and
was too slow in his movements to come to her rescue, was a
memorable occasion, for, though Hector had not felt sufficiently
valiant to administer punishment to the young rascal, godar, the
miller, had no such qualms. And Andr&eacute; got his punishment twice
over, Mother's being by far the more severe. But he said that it
was worth it. To kiss a girl, he declared, when she is placid and
willing was well enough, but when she was a little spitfire like
Lucile and fought and scratched like a wildcat, then to hold her
down, kiss her throat and shoulder and, finally, her mouth, that
was as great a lark as ever came a man's way&mdash;and well worth a
whipping, or even two. What Lucile thought about it he neither knew
nor cared.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>The incident with Lucile Godart had occurred two years ago.
Andr&eacute; was thirteen then, and already the girls were wont to blush
when their eyes met his, so dark and bold.</p>

<p>Since the Lucile had married her Hector, who was now an
assistant bailiff on Monseigneur's estate and lived with his young
wife in a stone house on the edge of the wood. At the side of the
house there was a field, which at eventide was alive with rabbits.
That field exercised an irresistible fascination over Andr&eacute; Vallon.
He would cower behind the hedge and for hours watch the little
cottontails bobbing in and out of the scrub. More than once he had
been warned off by Hector Talon; once he had actually been caught
unawares and driven off with some hard kicks.</p>

<p>But to-day a tragedy had occurred.</p>

<p>Lying on his back at this moment on the hard stones not far from
his mother's washtub, and in the state in which God first made him,
he was perhaps wondering whether in this instance the game was
going to be worth the candle. He was too old now to get a whipping
from Mother, and he did not think that what he had done was
punishable by law. Still, Hector Talon was a spiteful beast, and
Lucile...Well, the little she-devil would get her deserts one day,
on the faith of Andr&eacute; Vallon.</p>

<p>While the hot July sun was baking his skin and staunching the
blood of his wounds, his brain was working away on the possible
consequences of to-day's adventure. He wondered what his mother
thought about it. For the moment she appeared to be immersed, both
with hands and with mind, in her washtub. Her broad back was turned
towards him, and Andr&eacute; thought that it looked uncompromising.
Still, Mother would have to know sooner or later, so better now,
perhaps, while she was busy with other things. And before he knew
that he had begun to think aloud, words were pouring out of him a
kind of passionate outburst of resentment.</p>

<p>"Rabbits! Rabbits!...Why! there are thousands and thousands of
them in that field," he went on with childish sense of
exaggeration. "M. Talon himself is obliged to put fencing round his
kitchen garden to keep them away. And I didn't put up any snare or
trap&mdash;I swear I didn't. There was nobody about, and I just got
over the fence to see...Well, I don't know. I just did get over the
fence, and there in the long grass was the tiniest wee rabbitkins
you ever saw! He was all crouching together till he looked like a
ball of brown fur, and his round eyes were wide open,
looking&mdash;I suppose he was horribly frightened&mdash;so
frightened that he couldn't move. Anyway, I just stooped to pick
him up. The house was all quiet, there didn't seem to be any one at
home, and that brute of a dog of theirs was on the chain."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; paused a moment; his hand had gone mechanically up to his
forehead, to his lips, his shoulder, all of which were smartin
horribly. Perhaps, he thought, it was time Mother said something,
but she just went on with her washing, and all that Andr&eacute; saw of
her was that large, uncompromising back.</p>

<p>"How could I guess?" the boy went on; and suddenly he sat up,
his brown arms encircling his knees, his chest striped with the red
of the blood oozing from his shoulder. "How could I guess that that
little vixen Lucile was spying from the window? I had got the young
beggar by the ears, and I remember just thinking at the moment what
luscious strew he was going to make. Of course, I had no intention
of putting him down again, and I was trying to tuck him out of
sight inside my shirt. And then, all of a sudden, I heard Lucile's
voice calling to that dog of hers: 'Hue! C&eacute;sar! hue!' What a devil!
My god! what a devil! That great brute C&eacute;sar! He was on me before I
could drop the rabbit and take to my heels. He was on me and got me
on the shoulder. Then I did drop the rabbit, and it scooted away. I
wanted both my hands to defend myself. I knew it would be no use
trying to run, and C&eacute;sar would have had me by the throat if I
hadn't got him. And there was that little devil Lucile, running
down the field and shouting, 'Hue! hue!' all the time."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was warming to his story. He was fighting his battle with
C&eacute;sar over again. His nostrils quivered; perspiration glistened on
his forehead; his eyes, wide open and dilated, were as dark as the
blackberries in the hedgerows.</p>

<p>"I got C&eacute;sar by the throat," he went on in a shaky, hoarse
voice, his words coming out jerkily, interspersed with gasps that
were half laughter and half tears. "I squeezed and I squeezed, and
all the while his horrid hot breath made me feel so sick that I
thought I should have to let go. Once he got me on the forehead,
and once I felt his nasty slimy teeth right inside my mouth. That
gave me the strength to squeeze tighter, for I thought that I
didn't he would probably kill me. Then that little devil Lucile
began to laugh, and I could hear bits of words that she said, 'That
will teach you to insult honest girls. C&eacute;sar also thinks it a lark
to get a boy down a kiss him on the shoulder, what? And on the
mouth. Hue, C&eacute;sar! hue!' Isn't she a troll, Mother, a witch, a
vixen, a she-devil, nursing vengeance like this for two
years&mdash;or is it three?&mdash;but I'll kiss her again. I will!
And what's more, I will..."</p>

<p>Once more Andr&eacute; paused. His mother's broad back was still turned
towards him, but she had turned her head, and through the corner of
her eye she was looking at him. That is why he did not complete the
sentence or put into words the ugly thought that had taken root in
his brain. He remained quite still and silent for a moment or two,
then he said abruptly:</p>

<p>"I never let go of C&eacute;sar's throat till I had squeezed the life
out of him."</p>

<p>But at this bald statement of fact, Marianne Vallon's outward
placidity gave way. "<i>J&eacute;sus! Mon Dieu!</i>" she exclaimed, and faced
that naked young daredevil with horror and anxiety distorting her
squab features. "Not content with poaching in M. Talon's field,
thou hast killed his dog?"</p>

<p>"He would have killed me else. Would'st rather C&eacute;sar had killed
me, Mother?" Andr&eacute; retorted with an indifferent shrug of his lean
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Andr&eacute;!" Marianne Vallon went on once more, in
her usual placid way. "M. Talon&mdash;dost not know it?&mdash;has
only to go before the magistrate and denounce thee--"</p>

<p>"Well, they can't hang me for killing a dog in self-defense, and
I didn't poach the rabbit."</p>

<p>"No, but they can..."</p>

<p>It was the mother's turn to leave the phrase incomplete which
involuntarily had come to her lips. Just like Andr&eacute; a moment ago,
she did not wish to put into words the thoughts that had come
tumbling into her brain and were filling her heart with the
foreknowledge of a calamity which she knew she could not avert.</p>

<p>If she could she would have packed Andr&eacute; off somewhere, to
friends, relations, anywhere; away from the spite of Talon, who
already had a grudge against the child and who would feel doubly
vindictive now. But when Marianne Vallon first fell on evil days
she lost touch with her former friends or relations, who, in their
turn, were content to forget her. Andr&eacute; must stop at home and face
the calamity like a man.</p>

<p>It came soon enough.</p>

<p>Talon, who was a man of consideration in the commune, laud a
complaint before M. le Substitut against Andr&eacute; Vallon for poaching
and savage assault on a valuable dog, resulting in the latter's
death.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;, in consideration of his youth&mdash;he was only
fifteen&mdash;was condemned to be publicly whipped. M. le Substitut
told him that he could consider himself most fortunate in being let
off with so mild a punishment.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>A blind unreasoning rage, an irresistible thirst for revenge; a
black hatred of all those placed in authority; of all those who
were rich, or independent, or influential, filled Andr&eacute; Vallon's
young soul to the exclusion of every other thought and every other
aspiration.</p>

<p>He was only fifteen, and in his mind he measured the long years
that lay before him in which he could find the means, the power, to
be even with those who had inflicted that overwhelming shame upon
him. It was not the blows he minded...Heavens above! that lithe,
young body of his was inured to every kind of hardship, to every
kind of pain. It was not the blows, it was the shame. Talon, who
was influential and who was egged on by his wife, had prevailed
upon the magistrate to make an order that all the inhabitants of
the commune who were not engaged in work were to be present in the
market place to see justice done on the young reprobate. And these
were still the days when no one dared go against an order, however
absurd and however unjust, framed by M. le Substitut du Procureeur
G&eacute;n&eacute;ral.</p>

<p>Monseigneur also came in his coach and brought friends to see
the spectacle. There were two ladies among them who put up their
lorgnettes and stared at the straight, sinewy young body, so like a
statue of the Hermes with its slender, perfectly modelled limbs and
narrow hips, and its broad shoulders and wide chest, smooth and
dark as if cast in bronze.</p>

<p>"But the boy is an Adonis!" one of the ladies exclaimed in
ecstasy.</p>

<p>"<i>Quelle horreur!</i>" she exclaimed a moment later when the stripes
fell thick and fast on the smooth back she had admired. The days
were not yet very far distant when ladies of high degree would
crowed on balconies and windows to watch the execution of
conspirators who perhaps had been their friends before then.</p>

<p>But for Andr&eacute; Vallon, the bitter, humiliating shame!</p>

<p>His mother was waiting for him when he got home. She had
prepared a little bit of hot supper for him, to which sympathisers
in the village had also contributed: things he liked&mdash;a little
hot soup, a baked potato, a bit of bread and salts. Andr&eacute; ate
because he was a young, healthy animal and was hungry, but he never
said a word. Silent and sullen, he sat and ate. Not a tear came to
those big dark eyes of his, in which there burned a fierce hatred
and an overpowering humiliation.</p>

<p>Marianne, of course, said nothing. It was never her way to talk.
She saw to it that Andr&eacute; had his supper, and when he had finished
she took him by the wrist and led him to his little room at the
back. She undressed him and washed and dried his poor aching young
body; then she wrapped him up in one of her wide gingham skirts
which had become soft as silk after many washings, and laid him
down on his narrow plank bed with his head resting on an old coat
of his father's, which had survived the dispersal of most of the
household goods. Before she had finished tucking him up in her wool
shawl he was asleep.</p>

<p>She watched for a moment or two the beautiful young face, with
the blue-veined lids veiling in sleep the sullen, glowering look of
the eyes; stooped and softly touched the moist forehead with her
lips. Two heavy tears found their way down her furrowed cheeks; a
heavy sigh came though the firm obstinate lips, and slowly she came
down on her knees. With clasped hands flung across the bed, she
remained kneeling there for some time, praying for guidance, for
strength to fight a brave fight with this turbulent young soul, and
for power to guide it in the path of rectitude.</p>

<p>This was the year of grace 1782, and Marianne Vallon, in common
with many men and women in the land these days, was not blind to
the tempest which already was gathering force in every corner of
France, framed by the ardour of young enthusiasts with a grievance
like her Andr&eacute;, or by the greed of profligate agitators, soon to
burst in all its fury, sweeping before it all the old traditions,
the old beliefs, the old righteousness of this country and its
people, and inflicting wounds that it would take centuries to
heal.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>M. le Cur&eacute; de Val-le-Roi, in the province of Burgundy, where
they make such excellent wine, was a kindly and worthy man. He came
of a good family&mdash;the Rosemondes of Ni&egrave;vre, and though his
intelligence was perhaps not of the highest order, his piety was
sincere and his human understanding very real.</p>

<p>On the tragic day of Andr&eacute; Vallon's public punishment he stood
beside the whipping post the whole time that Marius
Legendre&mdash;the local butcher employed by the Commune to
administer punishment to juvenile offenders&mdash;was lamming into
the boy. Andr&eacute;, with teeth set and eyes resolutely closed, appeared
not to hear the Cur&eacute;'s gentle words, exhorting him to patience and
humility.</p>

<p>Patience and humility, forsooth! Never was there a vainer
exhortation.</p>

<p>It was only when it was all over and he was freed from the post
that Andr&eacute; opened his eyes and cast a glowering, rankling look
around the market square. Legendre had thrown down the whip and was
handing the lad his shirt and coat. Andr&eacute; snatched them out of his
hand, and Legendre&mdash;a worthy man, not unkind&mdash;smiled
indulgently. The two gendarmes stood at attention, waiting for
orders, their faces wooden and impassive. Part of the crowd had
already dispersed: the men silent and sullen, the women sniffing
audibly. The younger ones&mdash;girls and boys&mdash;muttered words
of pity or of wrath. Monseigneur was standing beside the door of
his coach, helping the ladies to step back into the carriage. One
of them&mdash;the one with the largnette&mdash;cast a final
backward glance at Andr&eacute;; then piped in a high-pitched, flutelike
voice:</p>

<p>"See, my dear Charles, so would a fallen angel have looked had
the Almighty punished the rebels with thongs."</p>

<p>A man in the forefront of the crowd, close to Monseignuer's
coach, laughed obsequiously at the sally. Andr&eacute; saw him. It was
Talon. Lucile stood beside her husband. When she met Andr&eacute;'s
glance, she, too, gave a laugh, but quickly turned her head away.
Then only did a groan rise from the boy's breast. It was a groan of
an overwhelming, impotent rage. His breath came whistling through
his teeth. He made a movement like a wild beast about to spring,
but instinctively the gendarmes had already placed each a hand upon
his shoulder and held him down. Andr&eacute; was weak after the
punishment, though he would not have admitted it even to himself;
but his knees shook under him, and he nearly collapsed under the
heavy hands of the gendarmes. M. le Cur&eacute; murmured gentle words. "My
son, remember that our Lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; turned on him with a cry that was like a snarl. "Go away!
Go away!" he muttered hoarsely. "I hate you."</p>

<p>But the Cur&eacute; did not go away. He stayed to help the lad on with
his shirt and coat; then, when Andr&eacute;, avoiding the crowd, went
staggering round a back street and then down the lane towards his
mother's cottage, the kindly old priest followed him at a short
distance, ready to render assistance should the boy be seized with
giddiness and collapse on the way. Only when he saw Marianne
standing at the narrow garden gate waiting for her son did he went
his way back to his presbytery. Contrary to his usual habit, he did
not take his breviary out of his pocket or murmur orisons while he
walked. With his soutane hitched up around his waist, he strode
along, obviously buried in thought, for now and again he would
shake his head and then nod, as if in secret communion with
himself.</p>

<p>The results of M. le Cur&eacute;'s agitation were, firstly, a lengthy
interview with Monseigneur, and secondly a summons to Marianne
Vallon to bring her son Andr&eacute; up to the ch&acirc;teau. Monseigneur
desired to see him.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;, of course, refused to go. "I hate him!" he declared when
M. le Cur&eacute; came to announce what he thought was great news for
Marianne and the boy.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," the priest had explained, "was interested. He is
always so kind and so gracious, but when I spoke to him of Andr&eacute; he
was pleased to be genial, facetious; he toyed, as one might say,
with the idea of doing something for the boy. Then there were the
ladies. Madame la Marquise d'Epinay put in a word here and there,
so charming she was, so sprightly. She spoke of Andr&eacute; as the bronze
Hermes, and though the latter we know is nothing but a heathen god,
and I would not care to think that our Andr&eacute; had any likeness to
such idolatrous things, I could not have it in my heart to reprove
the witty lady, especially as Monseigneur appeared more and more
diverted. Then Mademoiselle Aurore came in&mdash;such a pretty
child&mdash;her governess was with her, and I gathered at once she
knew something about our Andr&eacute;&mdash;domestics will talk, you know,
my good Marianne&mdash;and Mademoiselle was even more interested
than Monseigneur. She put her little hands together and begged and
begged of her father that Andr&eacute; might come up to the ch&acirc;teau, as
she desired to see him. And Monseigneur, who since the death of
Madame la Duchesse gives in to all the child's whims, gave me
permission to bring our Andr&eacute; to him."</p>

<p>The good Cur&eacute; spoke thus lenghily and uninterruptedly, for
Marianne, absorbed in her knitting, said never a word: she was
never much of a talker, and Andr&eacute; only glowered and muttered
unintelligible words between his teeth. There was perhaps something
a little unctuous, a little complacent in M. le Cur&eacute;'s verbiage. He
was not forgetting that besides being the incumbent of this poor
little village, he was also by birth a Rosemonde de Ni&egrave;vre, and
that by tradition and upbringing he belonged to the same caste as
Monseigneur le Duc de Marigny de Borne, whose gracious sympathy in
facour of "our Andr&eacute;" he had been fortunate enough to arouse.</p>

<p>"I hate him! I will not go!" was all that could be got out of
Andr&eacute; that day. "You can drag me to that accursed ch&acirc;teau," he went
on sullenly, "as you did to the whipping post, but willingly I will
not go."</p>

<p>"But, my dear child," the Cur&eacute; protested, "Monseigneur
said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whatever he said," the boy broke in with a snarl, like an
animal that is being teased, "may his words choke him!&mdash;I hate
him!"</p>

<p>"You are overwrought and agitated, my boy," the priest said
placing his well manicured podgy white hand on Andr&eacute;'s shoulder,
who promptly shook it off. "When the good God and your dear patron
saint have prevailed over your rebellious spirit, you will realize
how much Monseigneur's kindness and Mademoiselle Aurore's
intercession&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't speak to me of those women up at the ch&acirc;teau," Andr&eacute;
cried hoarsely, "or I shall see red!"</p>

<p>Marianne Vallon at this point put down her knitting. She knew
well enough that to carry on the discussion any further to-day
would only drive the boy to exasperation. All that he had gone
through in the past few days had, in a way, made a man of him, but
a man with all a child's unreasoning resentment at what he deemed
an injustice.</p>

<p>M. le Cur&eacute; took the hint. With characteristic tact he changed
the subject of conversation, spoke to Marianne on village
matters&mdash;the washing of surplices which she had undertaken to
do for a small stipend, and finally took his leave, deliberately
ignoring Andr&eacute;'s ill manners and glowering looks. At the door,
however, he turned once more to where the boy sat, chin cupped in
his hand, staring dully into the gathering shadows.</p>

<p>"Remember, my dear child," he said with gentle earnestness; all
his small, worldly ways drowned in a flood of genuine sympathy,
"that your future does not belong entirely to yourself: your
sainted mother works her fingers to the bone so that you should be
clothed and fed. She performs menial tasks to which neither by
birth nor upbringing was she ever ordained. Think of her, my lad,
before you spurn the hand that can help you up the ladder that may
lead you to an honourable career and give you the chance of
repaying part of your debt to her."</p>

<p>Mother and son spoke little to each other during the rest of the
day. Marianne appeared more than usually busy with knitting and
sewing and spoke even less than was her wont. After sundown Andr&eacute;
went out from a tramp in woods and fields. Ever since the fatal day
he had made a point of wandering over the countryside only after
dark. He dreaded to meet familiar faces in the country lanes,
dreaded to see either compassion or ridicule in the glances that
would meet his.</p>

<p>To-night his young soul was brimful with bitterness. Never
before had he felt such an all-embracing hatred for everything, and
every human being who had made possible the humiliation that had
been put upon him. Childlike, he wandered down the lane past the
house where lived talon and his wife, the prime authors of the
whole tragedy. He stood for a long time looking at the house. There
were lights in one or two of the window. The Talons were rich, they
could afford candles. They were people of consideration. They got
the ear of the Substitut and engineered his, Andr&eacute;'s, lasting
disgrace. He hated them&mdash;hated their house, their garden,
their flowers; he wished with all his might that some awful
calamity would overtake them.</p>

<p>The fields around were bathed in moonlight; the air was fragrant
and warm; a gentle breeze fluttered the branches of the forest
trees, causing a gentle murmur to fill the night with its subtle
sound. The scent of hay and clover rose from the adjoining meadows,
and from the depths of the wood there came from to time the
melancholy call of a night bird or the crackling of trigs under
tiny, furtive feet.</p>

<p>Only a very few days ago Andr&eacute; would have revelled in all that:
the little cottontails scurrying past, the bard-door owl flying by
with great flapping of wings; fantastically shaped clouds veiling
from time to time the face of the moon. All would have delighted
him, those few short days ago. Now he had eyes only for that house
of evil. He watched its windows till the lights were extinguished
one by one, and then wished once more with all his might that
hideous nightmares should disturb the sleep of those whom he hated
so bitterly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>When Andr&eacute; finally turned to go home again, it was close on
midnight. Coming in sight of the cottage, he was surprised to see
that, contrary to his mother's rigid rules of economy, there was
still a light in the parlour. He pushed open the door and peeped
in. Mother was sitting sewing by the light of a tallow candle. She
looked up as he came in and gave him a welcoming smile. He thought
she looked quite old, and her eyes were circled with red, as if she
had been crying. But he pretended not to notice. Still, it was
funny, her burning a candle so late at night when candles were so
dear. And why did she look so tired and so old?</p>

<p>He asked no questions, however. Somehow he didn't feel as if he
could say anything just then. He knew that presently his mother
would come into his room to hear him say his prayers, to tuck him
up in the old wool shawl and give him a last good-night kiss. Of
late he had refused to say his prayers. Le bon Dieu, he thought,
only bothered Himself about rich and powerful people&mdash;nobles,
bishops, and such like&mdash;s what was the good of murmuring
prayers that were never listened to and asking for things that were
never granted? When Mother said her prayers as usual beside his bed
in spite of his obstinacy, he turned his head sullenly away. He had
even caught himself wishing that she would leave him alone, once he
was in bed: alone, nursing his thoughts of future retribution on
all those whom he hated so.</p>

<p>Strange that he never had the desire to talk to his mother about
all that went on in his mind these days. Strange, seeing that
hitherto he had always blurted out everything that troubled him,
poured into her patient ear the full stories of his peccadillos,
his adventures, anything and everything that passed through his
mind. But now Andr&eacute; had succeeded in persuading himself that his
mother would not understand his feelings. She was, he thought, so
patient and so devout that she would not sympathize with a
man&mdash;a man!&mdash;who had been so deeply injured as himself.
He felt that he had suddenly become a man&mdash;a man suffering an
infinite wrong; and that Mother was only a woman, weak under the
influence of priests and of their everlasting teachings of
gentleness and humility. Men couldn't be gentle these days. They
had suffered too long and too bitterly: crying wrongs, injustice
that called to heaven for vengeance&mdash;only that heaven wouldn't
hear. Well, if le bon Dieu wouldn't help the poor and the
downtrodden to defend themselves against injustice, then they would
fight on their own without help from anywhere.</p>

<p>Monseigneur and his sycophants! And those women with their
perfumes and their silk dresses and their lorgnettes and their
high-pitched voices! Andr&eacute; hoped to God that he would live long
enough to see them all eat the bread of humiliation as he himself
had been forced to do.</p>

<p>At this point in his meditations Mother did come in. Andr&eacute; did
not hear her at first, for she had taken off her sabots and was in
her stockinged feet. It was only when she stood close beside his
bed that he turned his head and saw her.</p>

<p>Of course, he felt sorry for her. Women were women, and
therefore weaker vessels, unable to take in the vast thoughts and
projects of men. But they were dear gentle creatures whose
ministrations were essential to the well-being of the stronger,
more intellectual sex. Therefore Andr&eacute; felt very kindly disposed
towards his mother just now: he would not have admitted for the
world, even to himself, that at sight of her dear old face, with
its furrowed cheeks and eyes to often stern, and yet always full of
love, a great yearning seized him to bury his head in her ample
bosom, to forget his manhood and be a child again. However, all he
said for the moment was: "Not yet in bed, Mother? Isn't it very
late?"</p>

<p>To which she replied cheerily, "It is, my cabbage, and fully
time you were asleep."</p>

<p>She then knelt down beside his bed. Andr&eacute; ought then to have
jumped out of bed and knelt beside her to say his prayers. This had
always been the rule every since he was old enough to babble his
"Gentle Jesus, meek and mild..." and clasp his baby hands; even
when he began to feel himself a man, he had readily complied with
the rule. But for days now, when Mother knelt beside his bed and
murmured, "Our Father which art in Heaven," he had turned his head
stubbornly away, nor had he looked at her till she had finished her
prayers. To-night, however, though he still felt wrathful and was
too big a man to get out of bed, he kept his head turned towards
her so that he could see her face. There was such a bright moon
outside that he could see her quite plainly: her found flat face,
her thin hair already streaked with gray, parted in the middle and
fastened in a small tight bun on the top of her head. Her eyes were
closed while she prayed with hands tightly clasped, her lips
murmuring softly, "Forgive us our trespasses"; then all at once she
raised her voice and said quite loudly, "As we forgive them that
trespass against us."</p>

<p>"I won't! I won't!" Andr&eacute; broke in involuntarily. "I'll never
forgive them, never!"</p>

<p>But Marianne did not seem to hear. She finished her prayers and
then remained for a time on her knees, gazing on the beautiful
young face that meant all the world to her. Almost distorted now
with wrath and obstinacy, it was none the less beautiful; with
those large dark eyes that seemed forever to be inquiring, to be
groping after something unattainable. Marianne's large, capable
hand wandered lovingly over the hot, moist forehead and brushed
back the unruly curls which fell, rebellious, over the brow.
Without another word she pressed a kiss on the eyes, closed as she
thought in sleep, and on the mouth through which the young
passionate breath came in slow, measured cadence. Then she tiptoed
out of the room.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was not asleep. He had felt the kiss and tasted the salt
moisture of his mother's tears on his lips. For a long, long while
he remained lying on his back, with widely dilated eyes staring
into the darkness above him. Through the chinks in the ill-fitting
door he could perceive the feeble light of the tallow candle which
still burned in the adjoining room. He heard the old church clock
strike one, then the half hour then two. The moon had gone, the
tiny room wherein stood the boy's small plank bed was in complete
darkness, save for that dim streak of light underneath the
door.</p>

<p>As noiselessly as he could Andr&eacute; rose and tiptoed across the
room. For a few seconds he listened, his ear glued to the keyhole,
but all that he could hear was an occasional sigh, and once a sound
like a broken sob. The door hung loosely on its hinges, he pulled
it open. His mother was still sitting sewing by the feeble
candlelight. Andr&eacute;, leaning against the door jamb, stood mutely
watching her.</p>

<p>She seemed very busy and never looked up once in his direction.
She had a pair of breeches in her hands, had evidently been at work
on them. Now she fastened off the cotton, broke it off, put down
her needle. Andr&eacute; watched her. She did look old, and there was a
tear which had settled on the tip of her nose. She wiped it off
with her apron and then held the breeches up with both hands to see
if more darning was needed. Satisfied that they were quite in
order, she laid them down on the table, smoothed them out with both
hands, then folded them carefully and put them to one side.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; thoughts: "Those are my breeches. She has tired herself
out mending them." And the words which M. le Cur&eacute; had spoken
earlier in the day came hammering into his brain: "Remember, my
child, that your future does not belong entirely to yourself. Your
sainted mother works her fingers to the bone that you should be
clothed and fed."</p>

<p>That was true, for there she was, working for into the night,
mending his breeches, while he...</p>

<p>"Mother!" he said abruptly. "Do you wish me to go up to the
ch&acirc;teau and see those people?"</p>

<p>She didn't give a start; obviously she knew that he was there.
She was standing now with one hand resting on the table and peering
over into the darkness to try and see him with her blinking, tired
eyes.</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;! Why aren't you in bed?" she asked. "Go back at
once."</p>

<p>"Mother!" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Yes, Andr&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to go to the ch&acirc;teau and see those people?"</p>

<p>"It might lead to something good for your future, my child. M.
le Cur&eacute; said that Monseigneur was kindly disposed."</p>

<p>"I have no decent clothes in which to go," the boy muttered, his
sullen mood not yet quite gone.</p>

<p>"There are your new stockings which I have quite finished,"
Marianne rejoined quietly, "and I have done mending your best
breeches. You can wear you father's Sunday coat and his buckled
shoes&mdash;fortunately he was a small man, and you are hear as
tall already."</p>

<p>"Mother!" Andr&eacute; exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, Andr&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"You have been working your fingers to the bone so that I should
be clothed. M. le Cur&eacute; said so."</p>

<p>"No, my child," Marianna said, smiling through an involuntary
little sigh, "not to the bone."</p>

<p>"And did you sit up to-night because you&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I knew that you would want your best breeches&mdash;soon."</p>

<p>"You knew I would change my mind and go to the ch&acirc;teau?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Andr&eacute;, I knew."</p>

<p>"How could you know, Mother?"</p>

<p>"I suppose your guardian angel must have told me. He knew."</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>This time the cry came straight from the boy's heart. With one
bound he was beside his mother and with his arms was encircling her
knees. His tousled head was buried in her voluminous skirt. She
fell back into her chair and drew the hot, aching young head
against her breast. There, resting against that warm, downy pillow,
all pretence at manhood was swamped in the grief of a child. Andr&eacute;
burst into a flood of tears, the first that had welled out of the
bitterness of his heart since that awful day of disgrace. Marianne,
with her kind fat arms wrapped round her most precious treasure,
thanked God for those tears.</p>

<p>The tallow candle flickered and died out. The room was in
darkness, only a pale light, the first precursor of dawn, came
shyly peeping presently through the small uncurtained window. The
distant church clock struck four. It was more than an hour since
Marianne had moved. The child had cried himself to sleep, squatting
on the floor, with his head on her lap, her hand resting on his
curls. From time to time a sob shook the young frame; then even the
sobs were stilled, and Marianne, stiff with sitting motionless,
would not move for fear of waking him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>If you should ever visit the Bourbonnais do not fail to go as
far as Le Borne, on the outskirts of which stands the princely
Ch&acirc;teau de marigny. It is one of the most sumptuous survivals of
medieval splendour, with its unique position on a spur of the
Roches du Borne, commanding a gorgeous view over the valley of the
Allier with its rippling winding stream, its spreading forests of
beech and walnut and sycamore, its vine-clad slopes and picturesque
villages&mdash;Val-le-Roi, Le Borne, Vanzy, and so on&mdash;peeping
shyly through the trees.</p>

<p>Originally built in the twelfth century by Jean Duke of
Burgundy, it was enlarged and enriched by each of his successors,
until the great Duke Charles&mdash;known to history as the
Conn&eacute;table de Bourbon&mdash;as great in treachery as in doughty
deeds, completed the work of making the Ch&acirc;teau de Marigny second
to none in grandeur and magnificence. It was to him that King Henry
VIII of England referred when he remarked to Fran&ccedil;ois I of France
on the occasion of the meeting on the Field of the Cloth of Gold:
"If I had so opulent a subject, I would soon have his head
off."</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois I had no occasion to follow his English friend's
advice, for it was soon after that that the illustrious Conn&eacute;table
de bourbon became a traitor to his country and sold his sword to
the enemy of France, which was quite sufficient excuse for the King
to declare the Duke's estates forfeit to the Crown. Some of these
were subsequently sold and passed from hand to hand. The ch&acirc;teau,
then known as Ch&acirc;teau de Borne, came into the possession of the Duc
de Marigny, first cousin of King Henry of Navarre and a direct
descendant of the Conn&eacute;table who renamed it Marigny and added to
his many titles that of De Borne.</p>

<p>Though the magnificence for which the old ch&acirc;teau was famous in
the past&mdash;when 'twas said that Duke Charles kept five hundred
men-at-arms within its precincts&mdash;was somewhat shorn of its
dazzling rays, the present Duc de Marigny did, nevertheless, live
there like a prince and entertain with lavish hospitality. These
were the days, closely following on those of the Grand Monarque,
when the king set the pace in splendour and prodigality and the
great nobles thought it incumbent on them to emulate royal
ostentation. It was the era of beautiful furniture and of exquisite
silks and laces, of stately ceremonials both at court and at home,
of gorgeous banquets, expensive food and wins, as well as of the
aesthetic enjoyment of pictures, music, and the play. Money flowed
freely into the coffers of those who had landed estates: the State
favoured them, for not only were they free of taxation, but one
privilege after another was conferred on them, and, quite
naturally, they grasped these with both hands and then asked for
more.</p>

<p>Cradled in the lap of luxury, wrapped up in cotton wool by
sycophants and menials, they shut their eyes to the gather clouds
of the inevitable Revolution. The cataclysm found them unprepared,
scared, and astonished, like children wakened out of a dream. Most
of them had not done blinking their eyes under the shadow of the
guillotine. When they died, they died like heroes. They would have
lived like heroes had they been given the lead, had they understood
that the distant thunder of growing discontent among the people,
the flashed of lightning of menace and revenge, were the precursors
of a raging storm that threatened them, their traditions and their
caste.</p>

<p>In this year of grace 1782 Monseigneur le Duc de Marigny, one of
the richest and most distinguished memebers of the old French
aristocracy, connected with the royal houses of Bourbon and
Orl&eacute;ans, was certainly one of those who thought that most things
were for the best in this best possible world. The only thing that
ever troubled him was the occasional tightness of money. This was
an unheard-of thing. The Duc de Marigny, cousin of kinds, short of
money! in his father's day, my gad, sir! if there were no Jews to
skin there were always those lazy, good-for-nothing peasants whose
whole excuse for being alive at all was that they should provide
their seigneur with everything he was pleased to want.</p>

<p>Those were the good old days. Now there was nothing but
grumbling in the villages. Bad weather, poor harvest, bad luck. <i>Eh,
morbleu!</i> Monseigneur knew well enough that the harvests were poor.
If they weren't, he wouldn't be so terribly short of money; just
when Aurore's birthday was coming on, too, and the ch&acirc;teau was
going to be full of the most distinguished visitors that he had
ever assembled under one roof. He was an amiable old gentleman,
this descendant of the great Conn&eacute;table: he did not aspire to have
five hundred men-at-arms under his orders, but he did expect his
house to be second to none in the matter of hospitality and of
splendour. And Aurore meant half the world to him. He had been
married three times: the first two duchesses had failed in their
duty of presenting him with an heir, the third one turned her face
to the wall and died when a tiny baby girl was first put against
her breast. Monseigneur quickly consoled himself and would no doubt
have brought a fourth duchess home to grace the head of the table
only that his reputation of Bluebeard had made the eligible young
ladies of his own rank chary of accepting so dangerous a position.
Moreover, little tiny Aurore had already entwined himself around
his fickle old heart. He forswore the delights of matrimony for the
more durable ones of fatherhood, and devoted all the time that he
could spare from the study of his own comforts to the furtherance
of Aurore's enjoyment of life.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, a little difficult to imagine a girl in her
teens taking pleasure in games and pursuits which in these modern
days would rouse the scorn of a child of seven&mdash;difficult to
visualize that bright sunny day in July, 1782, when Aurore's
birthday party, consisting of twenty or thirty of her friends in
ages ranging from thirteen to twenty-three, spent their afternoon
in playing blindman's bluff or hide-and-seek in the terraced
gardens of Marigny. In and out the bosquest and parterres they
darted like so many gaily plumaged birds, filling the air with
their laughter and childish screams of delight, the while
Monseigneur le Duc in his boudoir was giving M. Talon, his bailiff,
a bad quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>"Mort de Dieu! you old muckworm!" was one of the many pleasant
ways in which Monseigneur addressed the unfortunate Talon. "Have I
not told you that I must have five thousand louis before the end of
the month?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monseigneur," Talon replied obsequiously, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no 'but' about it, my man, when I said 'must'&mdash;"
Monseigneur broke in drily.</p>

<p>"The tallage has all been paid&mdash;the salt tax, the window
tax&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call it the harvest tax or any cursed name you choose, but find
me the money, or else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur!" protested Talon, who was quaking in his buckled
shoes, knowing well enough what menace was being held over his
head.</p>

<p>"Or else," Monseigneur went on slowly, emphasizing his words,
"you and your precious family quit my service; I have no use for
incompetent menials."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur!" Talon protested again, and with hands upraised
called Heaven to witness his loyalty and his competence.</p>

<p>"Ed, what? There is no 'monseigneur' about it; and your
sanctimonious airs, <i>mon ami</i>, are no use to me. I have thirty guests
in the house; it is Mademoiselle's birthday. I have told you that
before, have I not?"</p>

<p>"As if I could forget&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well, then. Even with your limited intelligence you must
be aware that in order to entertain such distinguished persons I
must have my larder and my cellars full. Well! I'm short of wine.
You know that. You know that we sent to that thief in Nevers for
some, and that the mudlark refuses to send the wine unless he is
paid beforehand."</p>

<p>"I know that, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"You also know that I am giving Mademoiselle a ruby necklace for
her birthday. You wrote the order out yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Well, then! that also has to be paid for," Monseigneur
concluded with what he felt was unanswerable logic. "So do not dare
to appear before me again without at least&mdash;mind! I say at
least&mdash;five thousand louis in your filthy hand. Now you can
go."</p>

<p>Talon's narrow hatchet face, usually sallow and bilious, took on
an ashen hue. Through narrow deep-set eyes he cast a furtive glance
at his irascible master. But Monseigneur, having delivered his
ultimatum, no longer troubled his august head about his unfortunate
bailiff. No doubt experience had taught him that under threat of
dismissal Talon had always contrived somehow to produce the
necessary money. Monseigneur never troubled his head much whence
that money came. He had never been taught to troubled his head
about anything so mean and sordid as money. He paid Talon a liberal
salary, gave him a good house, productive land, and every facility
to rob and cheat him, in order that this man should take all such
burdens to enjoy life without care or worry. Many a time had Talon
heard this philosophy propounded to him by his master: he knew that
argument and protests were worse than useless, and it is to be
supposed that in an emergency like the present one it was safer to
incur further hatred from Monseigneur's tenants than the
displeasure of Monseigneur himself.</p>

<p>M. le Duc for the moment appeared to have forgotten Hector
Talon's very existence; he had caught sight through the wide-open
window of his darling little Aurore at play with her friends. There
was a grand game of blindman's bluff going on, and the sight would
have gladdened any old man's heart, let alone that of a doting
father. Monseigneur's eyes gleamed with pleasure; the misfortune of
"blindman" who measured his length on the sanded path drew a
delighted roar of laughter from him. Talon thought and hoped that
he was momentarily forgotten and that he could achieve his exit
without hearing further abuse or further threats. As noiselessly as
he could he turned on his heel and made for the door. Just as he
was about to slip through it Monseigneur's pleasant voice once more
reached his ear:</p>

<p>"That reminds me, Talon," he said lightly, "that my cousin M. le
Marquis d'Epinay had a splendid idea last year when he was short of
money. There was all that stony land on Mont Oderic and Mont
Socride, you remember? It was no use to him, he couldn't make
anything out of it. So he made the neighbouring communes buy it of
him at his own price. I believe the rascals have done very well
with it since. Well! there's that bit of land the other side of
Rocher Vert. I don't want it. Let the communes of Val-le-Roi and Le
Borne buy it of me. They can have it for three thousand louis and
you can make up the other two out of the hoard which you have
amassed through robbing me, you black-guard."</p>

<p>"The communes couldn't pay, monseigneur," Talon protested, and
then added very injudiciously: "As for me, how can Monseigneur
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you are a thief and a liar?" Monseigneur broke in, with a
careless laugh. "Why, you villain, if you were a decent man you
would have left my service long ago. You know that I only employ
you to do my dirty work, which I couldn't ask others who are clean
and honest to do for me. As for the communes, what I propose is a
sound bargain for them: those peasants can make a good thing out of
land, which you are too big a fool to turn to account. Anyway,
that's my last word, and now, get out of my sight. I am sick of
you."</p>

<p>Talon was as thankful to go as Monseigneur was to be rid of him.
He slipped like a stealthy cat through the door, while
Monseirgneur, throwing cares and money worries off his broad
shoulders, returned to the more agreeable occupation of watched his
daughter playing at blindman's bluff.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if he had been gifted with second sight, M. le Duc de
Marigny would not have felt quite so carefree: for then he would
have seen his bailiff, Hector Talon, the other side of the door,
pausing for a moment with clawlike fingers resting on the handle.
On his sallow face there was neither humility nor servility, only a
cunning, mocking glance in the narrow, deep-set eyes and a sneer
upon the pale thin lips. What went on in the man's mind it is
impossible to say. Did he long to turn on the hand that fed him?
Did he foresee that, on a day not very far distant, he would be the
one to command and Monseigneur the dependent on his good-will? All
unconsciously now, even good-humouredly, Monseigneur chose to snub
and humiliate him. There was no conscious feeling of arrogance in
so great a gentleman's treatment of his subordinates; just the
belief amounting to a certainty that he and his kind were made of a
different clay from the rest of humanity, and that God had
preordained them to rule and the others to obey. All these thoughts
and hopes did, no doubt, course through Hector Talon's mind as he
stood on the other side of the door with his fingers on the handle.
But Monseigneur knew nothing of that. He was not gifted with second
sight and did not see the change of expression in his bailiff's
face&mdash;just as he had only given one casual and careless glance
at the boy at the whipping post whom the ladies had so aptly named
"the rebel angel."</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>On this same afternoon when Andr&eacute; Vallon, still rebellious in
spirit, followed M. le Cur&eacute; de Val-le-Roi up the wooded slopes that
led to the ch&acirc;teau, the picture that was revealed to his gaze when
he came in sight of the gorgeous old building, with its sumptuous
gardens, its marble terraces, its towers and battlements, its
stately trees and wealth of flowers, was one he never forgot.
Vagually he had heard the ch&acirc;teau spoken of by those who knew, as
"magnificent"; vaguely he was aware that Monseigneur lived there in
a state of splendour of which he, a village lad, had no conception,
even in his dreams; and from the valley below, where on the
outskirts of Val-le-Roi his mother's cottage lay perdu, he had
often gazed upwards to the heights, where at sunset the pointed
roofs glistened like silver and the rows of windows sparkled like a
chain of rubies; but he had never been allowed to wander up the
slope and see all that magnificence at close quarters.</p>

<p>Heavy gilded iron gates shut off the precincts of the ch&acirc;teau
from prying eyes and vagabond footsteps; stern janitors warned
trespassers against daring to set foot inside the park; and thus
the place where dwelt those unapproachable personages, Monseigneur
and his friends, had hitherto appeared to Andr&eacute; like fairyland, or
rather, like the ogre's castle of which he had read in the
storybooks of M. Perrault&mdash;the ogre who devoured all the good
things of this earth and always wanted more.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was dazzled. The same enthusiasm that made him love the
moonlight, the cottontails, or the hedgerows caused him to utter a
cry of pleasure when he first caught sight of the ch&acirc;teau. He came
to a halt and allowed his eyes to feast themselves on the picture.
M. le Cur&eacute; was delighted; he thought that the boy was showing a
nice spirit of reverence and of awe.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful, is it not, Andr&eacute;?" he remarked
complacently.</p>

<p>But Andr&eacute;'s mood was not quite as serene as the worthy priest
had fondly hoped. He turned sharply on his heel and retorted with a
scowl:</p>

<p>"Of course it is beautiful, but why should it be his?"</p>

<p>"What in the world do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You call that man up there 'Monseigneur.' Why? This all belongs
to him. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because..."</p>

<p>The good Cur&eacute; droned on. Andr&eacute; certainly did not listen; he
stalked on once more, irritable and silent. He had asked a question
for which, in his own mind, there could not possibly be an answer.
True that something of the bitterness of intense hatred had, as it
were, flowed out of him with the tears which he had shed on his
mother's breast, but the spirit of inquiry, of blind groping after
mysteries which were incapable of solution had, for good or ill,
replaced the childish acceptance of things as they were. To him
henceforth his mother's penury and Monseigneur's wealth were not
preordained by God; they did not form a part of the scheme of
creation as God had originally decreed. They were the result of
man's incapacity to grapple with injustice; the result, in fact, of
the weakness of one section of humanity and of the arrogant
strength of the other.</p>

<p>Very wisely, M. le Cur&eacute; had not pursued the contentious subject.
Together the two of them found their way across the wide, paved
forecourt and up the <i>perron</i>. Lackeys in gorgeous liveries opened
wide the gates of the ch&acirc;teau, and Andr&eacute;, feeling now as if he were
in a dream, silent, subdued, all the starch taken out of him, all
the rebellion of his spirit overawed by so much splendour, kept
close to the Cur&eacute;'s heels.</p>

<p>They went through the endless rooms, across floors that were so
slippery that Andr&eacute;, in his thick shoes, nearly measured his length
on them more than once. He caught sight of himself in tall mirrors,
full face, sideways, walking, sliding, pausing, wide-eyed and
scared, thinking that the figure he was coming towards him was some
strange boy whom he had never seen before. At length the Cur&eacute; came
to a halt in what seemed to Andr&eacute; like a fairy's dwelling place,
all azure and gold and crystal, where more tall mirrors reflected a
somewhat corpulent old man in a long black soutane, and a tall,
clumsy-looking boy in an ill-fitting coat, with tousled hair and
large hands and feet encased in huge, thick buckled shoes.</p>

<p>On one side of the room there were three tall windows through
which Andr&eacute; saw such pictures as he had never seen before. At first
he didn't think that they were real. There were marble balustrades
and pillars, parterrers of flowers and groups of trees, and a
fountain from whose sparkling waters the warm sunshine drew
innumerable diamonds. This fairy garden appeared peopled with a
whole bevy of brightly plumaged birds that darted in and out among
the bosquets and the parterres with flutelike calls and rippling
music. At least, so it seemed to Andr&eacute; at first. M. le Cur&eacute;, tired
out, hot and panting, had sunk down in one of the gilded chairs and
was mopping his streaming face; Andr&eacute;, attracted and intrigued by
the picture of that garden and those birds, ventured to go nearer
to one of the tall windows in order to have a closer look. The
window was wide open. Andr&eacute;, leaning against the frame, stood quite
still and watched.</p>

<p>A merry throng peopled the garden; ladies in light summer
dresses, some with large straw hats over their powdered hair,
others with fair or dark curls fluttering about their heads, men in
silk embroidered coats, with dainty buckled shoes and filmy lace at
throat and wrist, were chasing one another in and out of the leafy
bosquets, just like a lot of children, playing some puerile game of
blindman's bluff, which elicited many a little cry of mock alarm
and silvery peals of merry laughter. How gay they seemed! How
happy! Andr&eacute; watched them, fascinated. He followed the various
incidents of the game with eyes that soon lost their abstraction
and sparkled with responsive delight. He nearly laughed aloud when
an elegant gentleman in plum-coloured satin cloth, his eyes
bandaged, tripped over a chair mischievously placed in his way by
one of the ladies&mdash;a girl whose pink silk panniers over a
short skirt of delicate green brocade made her look like a rosebud:
so, at least, thought Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p>He quite forgot himself while he stood and watched. Like a child
at a show, he laughed when they laughed, gasped when capture was
imminent, rejoiced when a narrow escape was successful. M. le Cur&eacute;,
overcome by the heat, had gone fast asleep in his chair.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;, absorbed in watching, did not even notice that the crowd
of merrymakers had invaded the terrace immediately in front of the
window against which he stood. "Blindman" now was the young girl
with the fair hair, free from powder, whose dress made her look
like a rosebud. With arms outstretched she groped, after the clumsy
fashion peculiar to a genuine blindman, and her playmates darted
around her, giving her a little push here, another there, all of
them unheedful of the silent, motionless watcher by the open
window. And suddenly "Blindman," still with arms outstretched, lost
her bearings, tripped against the narrow window sill and wound have
fallen headlong into the room had not Andr&eacute; instinctively put out
his arms. She fell, laughing, panting, and with a little cry of
alarm, straight into him.</p>

<p>There was a sudden gasp of surprise on the part of the others, a
second or two of silence, and then a loud and prolonged outburst of
laughter. Andr&eacute; held on with both arms. Never in his life had he
felt anything as sweet, as fragrant, so close to him. The most
delicious odour of roses and violets came to his nostrils, while
the downiest, softest little curls tickled his nose and lips. As to
moving, he could not have stirred a muscle had his life depended on
it.</p>

<p>But at the prolonged laughter of her friends the girl at once
began to struggle; also, she felt the rough cloth beneath her
touch, while to her delicate nostrils there came, instead of the
sweet perfumes that always pervaded the clothes of her friends, a
scent of earth and hay and of damp cloth. She wanted to snatch away
the bandage from her eyes, but strong, muscular arms were round her
shoulders, and she could not move.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" she called out. "Let me go! Who is it?
Madeleine&mdash;Edith, who is it?"</p>

<p>The next moment a firm step resounded on the marble floor of the
terrace, a peremptory voice called out: "You young muckworm, how
dare you?" and the hold round her shoulders relaxed. Andr&eacute; received
a resounding smack on the side the face, while the girl, suddenly
freed, staggered slightly backward even while she snatched the
handkerchief from her eyes.</p>

<p>The first thing she saw was a dark young face with a heavy
chestnut curl falling over a frowning brow, a pair of eyes dark as
aloes flashing with hatred and rage. She heard the voice of her
cousin, the Comte de Maul&eacute;on, saying hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Get out! Get out, I say!" And then calling louder still: "Here!
L&eacute;on! Henri! Some of you kick this garbage out."</p>

<p>It was all terrible. The ladies crowded round her and helped to
put her pretty dress straight again, but the girl was too
frightened to think of them or her clothes. Why she should have
been frightened she didn't know, for Aurore de Marigny had never
been frightened in her life before: she was a fearless little rider
and a regular tomboy at climbing or getting into dangerous scrapes;
but there was something in that motionless figure in the rough
clothes, in those flashing eyes and hard, set mouth which puzzled
the child and terrified her. Here was something that she had never
met before, something that seemed to emit evil, cruelty, hatred,
none of his had ever come within sight of her sheltered, happy
life.</p>

<p>Pierre de Maul&eacute;on was obviously in a fury and kept calling for
the lackeys, who, fortunately, were not within hearing, for heaven
alone knew what would happen if anyone dared lay hands on that
incarnation of fury. The boy&mdash;Aurore saw that he was only a
boy, not much older than herself&mdash;looked now like a fierce
animal making ready for a spring; he had thrust one hand into his
breeches' pocket and brought out a knife&mdash;a miserable, futile
kind of pocketknife, but still a knife; and his teeth&mdash;sharp
and white as those of a young wolf&mdash;were drawing blood out of
his full red lips.</p>

<p>Some of the laidies screamed; others giggled nervously. The men
laughed, but no one thought of interfering. Inside the room, M. le
Cur&eacute;, roused from his slumbers, had obviously not yet made up his
mind whether he was awake or dreaming.</p>

<p>Just then the two lackeys, L&eacute;on and Henri, came hurrying along
the terrace. A catastrophe appeared imminent, for the boy had seen
them; knew, probably, what it would mean to him and all these
bedizened puppets if those men dared to touch him. He was seeing
red; for the first time in his life he felt the desire to see a
human creature's blood. With jerky movements he grasped the flimsy,
gimcrack pocketknife with which he meant to defend himself to the
death. He met the girl's eyes with their frightened, half-shy
glance and exulted in the thought that in a few seconds, perhaps,
she would see one of her lackeys lying dead at her feet.</p>

<p>Not even on that fatal day when he had tasted the very dregs of
humiliation had his young soul been such a complete prey to
rebellion and hatred. Why, oh, why had he allowed his heart to melt
at sight of his mother's wretchedness? Why had he ever set foot
across this cursed threshold? Pay! Pay! Pay! Those were once his
mother's words. Pay, while these marionettes laughed and played;
pay, so that their bellies might be full, their pillows downy,
their hair powdered and perfumed. He hated them all. Oh, how he
hated them!</p>

<p>These riotous thoughts were tumbling about in Andr&eacute;'s brain,
chasing one another with lightning speed while he was contemplating
murder and hurling defiant glances at the pretty child, the cause
of this new&mdash;this terrible catastrophe.</p>

<p>Ever afterwards he was ready to swear that not by a quiver of an
eyelid had he betrayed fear or asked for protection. Asked?
Heaveans above! He would sooner have fallen dead across this window
sill than have asked help from any of these gaudy nincompoops.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, there is no doubt that it was the girl's
piping, childish voice which broke the uncomfortable spell that had
fallen over the entire lively throng.</p>

<p>"<i>Oh&eacute;!</i>" she cried, with a ripple of laughter. "How solemn you all
look! Pierre, it is your turn. Come, V&eacute;ronique, you hold him while
I do the blindfolding; don't let him go&mdash;it is his turn."</p>

<p>Her friend to whom she called was close by and ready enough to
resume the game. Before Pierre de Maul&eacute;on had the chance to resist
she had him by the hand, while Aurore tied the handkerchief over
his eyes. A scream of delight went up all round. All seriousness,
puzzlement, was forgotten. Pierre tried to snatch the handkerchief
away, but two of them held onto his hands; the others pushed and
pinched and teased. They dragged him along the terrace; they
vaulted over the marble balusters; they were children, in fact,
once more, tomboys, madcaps, running about among the bosquets and
the flowers, irresponsible and irrepressed, while Andr&eacute;, without
another word, another look, turned on his heel and fled out of this
cursed ch&acirc;teau, leaving M. le Cur&eacute; to call and to gasp and to
explain to Monseigneur, as best he could, what, in point of fact,
had actually happened.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Book II</h2>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>There are several biographies extant of Andr&eacute; Vallon, some
written by friends, others by enemies. No man who has played a <i>r&ocirc;le</i>
on the world stage has ever been without his detractors, and only a
few have been without their apologists. To have really complete
conception of Vallon's temperament, character, and subsequent
conduct, it would be necessary to know something of his life during
the ten years that followed.</p>

<p>He was little more than fifteen when he left his village of
Val-le-Roi and went up to Paris under the aegis of M. l'Abb&eacute; de
Rosemonde, who had obtained for him, after much tribulation,
countless petitions, and untiring zeal, a scholarship in the
College of the Oratorians in Paris, where a few years before this a
young scholar named Georges Danton had pegged away at the classics,
and where many young minds began nursing those thoughts of
rebellion and agitation which were to render them famous or
infamous in the annals of the greatest revolution of all time.</p>

<p>Some of these men, at the time that Andr&eacute; Vallon went to the
Oratorians, were already prominent in the public eye. Danton at
this date was Conseiller du Roi, was calling himself Ma&icirc;tre d'Anton
and had a fine practice and a pretty young wife. Maximilien de
Robespierre had finished his studies at the Coll&egrave;ge Louis-le-Grand
and was now a leading light of advocacy; and Camille Desmoulins was
a notorious journalist. Andr&eacute;, who had developed a hitherto latent
ambition, and with such examples before him of success won by hard
work, became as model a scholar as he had been a turbulent village
lad. That it took all M. le Cur&eacute;'s eloquence and floods of his
mother's tears to persuade him to go to college at all goes without
saying, but he did go in the end.</p>

<p>How much it cost his mother to keep him in decent clothes while
he was at college remained forever a secret within her ample bosom.
As Andr&eacute; grew to be a man he made a pretty shrewd guess at the
hardships which she must have endured in order to put by a few
louis every year so that he should not cut too sorry a figure among
his schoolfellows. Luckily for him, he never felt any sense of
humiliation at his own shabby clothes or want of money to spend. He
was so firmly persuaded that his mother's poverty and his own empty
pockets were only transitory states which would be remedied by
himself when he was a man. And then, again, some of those whose
names at this hour were on everybody's lips had been as poor as
himself. Camille Desmoulins never had a sou from his avaricious
father to spend on leasure or finery, and Robespierre's clothes
were invariably threadbare.</p>

<p>Moreover, as the years went on, poverty became so much a matter
of course, except in the case of a privileged or a dishonest few,
that it ceased to have any significance. It was a matter of caste,
that was all, and became such an accepted fact that for a family
man not to be hungry, to have fuel on his hearth or shoes on his
feet was to be something of an alien among his own class. Nor was
it shame that stirred Andr&eacute;'s young blood to boiling when he saw
his mother in her old age, still scrubbing floors or toiling up to
the ch&acirc;teau to do the family washing; it was only passionate rage
at his own impotence to drag her out of her penury, and ever
growing better resentment at a social system which permitted the
few to have all the good things of this world and allowed the many
to go under for want of sufficient nourishment. That this
resentment should lead a young mind to wholesale condemnation of
the present <i>r&eacute;gime</i> was only natural, seeing that the King was an
autocratic monarch, and that his word, and his word alone, made and
unmade the laws.</p>

<p>In 1788 Andr&eacute; Vallon was called to the bar and delivered, as was
customary, his diploma speech in Latin. The subject set for the
year was the social and political condition of the country and its
relation to the administration of justice. A ponderous subject for
a village lad to tackle, but even Vallon's detractors&mdash;and he
already had a few&mdash;were ready to admit that he acquitted
himself adequately, and that his Latin was faultless. The grave and
reverend <i>seigneurs</i> of the law, on the other hand, sat up in
amazement and rubbed their lack-lustre eyes when they heard this
young advocate from the back of the provincial beyond spout
grandiloquent phrases, such as <i>Salus populi suprema lex esto</i>, and
with wide gestures of delicately modelled hands strike a note of
warning to those in high places&mdash;to all who had inherited
power, influence, or riches.</p>

<p>"<i>Qui habet aures auriendi</i>," he thundered. "<i>Audiat</i>."</p>

<p>There could be no two opinions about it: it was an incendiary
speech, even though there were no actual words in it that could be
construed into excitation to reprisals or insurrection. On the
contrary, it even concluded with a passionate appeal to those who
had the ear of the malcontents to pause before they led the people
blindly along the paths that led to revolution.</p>

<p>"Woe to him," he fulminated in conclusion, "who for his own
advancement plays on the passions and the prejudices of the people.
Woe to the instigator and the maker of revolutions!"</p>

<p>Thus ended his impassioned harangue, delivered in the language
of Ovid and Virgil, leaving his learned audience marvelling at this
young Cicero sprung out of a remote village, and gravely shaking
their heads at the unorthodox sentiments to which they had been
compelled to listen.</p>

<p>A week later Andr&eacute; was at home, telling his mother all about it,
courting her approval more ardently than he had done that of the
leading lights at the Paris bar. There was something in Marianne
Vallon's calm philosophy, in her acceptance of the inevitable,
which by its very contrast appealed to Andr&eacute;'s rebellious
spirit.</p>

<p>"You help me to keep my balance, Mother," he would say with all
youth's impatience, when she talked as she often used to do in the
past, of resignation and humility. "And God knows we shall all of
us want it presently," he added, with a careless shrug and a
laugh.</p>

<p>He went through all the fatigue of translating his Latin speech
into French for her, so that she might understand and criticize.
But he was quite proud of his achievement; he knew that he had left
his mark on the somewhat somnolent brains of his fellow
advocates.</p>

<p>"Ma&icirc;tre d'Anton was present, Mother," he related, bridling up at
the recollection of that proud moment when he saw the popular
orator make his way into the hall. "I think he liked my speech, for
I saw him nod with approval once or twice, and at the end he
clapped his hands together, and I heard his stentorian voice
shouting, 'Good! Very good indeed!'"</p>

<p>"A selfish and a cruel man," Marianne muttered under her
breath.</p>

<p>"How can you say that, Mother <i>ch&eacute;rie?</i>" Andr&eacute; protested. "He is a
model husband and a devoted father."</p>

<p>"He was born lucky. Wait till misfortune overtakes him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hope it won't," Andr&eacute; broke in gaily, "for he has offered me
a clerkship in his office."</p>

<p>"Don't take it, Andr&eacute;!" Marianne cried involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Why in the world no, Mother? It will be the making of me. Clerk
to Ma&icirc;tre d'Anton, Conseiller du Roi! Think of it!"</p>

<p>Marianne shrugged: "Conseiller du Roi?" she said with what would
have been a sneer round a mouth less kindly. "That man, Danton,
Conseiller du Roi? When he dreams of nothing but deposing his
King&mdash;if not worse."</p>

<p>"He dreams of changing the whole aspect of the world," Andr&eacute;
protested with unwonted earnestness, "and God knows this old world
wants a change."</p>

<p>Old Marianne shook her head. She was too old to imbibe all those
principles which men with fine oratorical powers like Georges
Danton poured daily into the ears of the young; too old also to
hope for a change in the system which had brought her to her
present state of indigence. In Danton's ways she foresaw disaster.
"Once you set an avalanche sliding down the mountain side," she
would say, "you cannot possibly stop its mad career. You are bound
to be crushed beneath it in the end."</p>

<p>But Andr&eacute; would retort proudly: "A man like Danton does not
count the cost. He says and does what he believes to be right, and
if he cannot carry his principles though, he will die like a
martyr."</p>

<p>"And drag all those whom he has fooled to perdition with
him."</p>

<p>"What grander death than that of a martyr?" Andr&eacute; demanded,
flushed with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>But Marianne, wise old peasant that she was, muttered: "Martyr?
And for what cause, mon Dieu? For what?"</p>

<p>"The happiness of mankind!"</p>

<p>And so the boy would argue. He was only a boy still, after all,
in spite of his Latin, and hero worship was in his blood. He became
a clerk to Ma&icirc;tre d'Anton, Conseiller du Roi, one of the greatest
lights at the moment of Paris advocacy: a man, too, wholly unspoilt
by success and prosperity. He had a way of persuading all those who
knew in him intimately that his was a large, all-embracing nature,
which only pined to see everyone around him smiling and happy.</p>

<p>He had a fine property in the country, a well furnished house in
town, a pretty wife and a boy whom he worshipped. Danton was at
this time the most popular man in France, and Andr&eacute; one of the
happiest, for he felt that he had his chance, a chance coveted by
every budding advocate who had delivered his Latin thesis that
year. He walked hand in hand with the man who was called the Lion
Tamer of France, for he held the savage pack of snarling felines on
the leash. Marat, Desmoulins, and the others bowed to his moderate,
sensible views.</p>

<p>"Wait," Marianne had said, "till misfortune overtakes him."</p>

<p>It did. Soon after Andr&eacute; entered his office his only child died,
the boy whom he adored. His wife was broken hearted; sought
consolation in religion. Georges Danton, who worshipped her, would
escort her daily to church, then rush round to the club and, in a
hoarse voice, broken with sobs, would prophesy now the coming
cataclysm. Shrewd, fat Marianne had proved indeed to be right.</p>

<p>In the wake of misfortune, Danton's moderation went to the wind,
and during the most impressionable years of his life Andr&eacute;'s ears
were constantly filled with his chief's ever more violent diatribes
against the social regime, the ignorance and ineptitude of the
King, and the venality of his ministers.</p>

<p>"They have eyes and see not; ears they have and hear not,"
Danton would thunder forth whenever news of riots in the provincial
towns, already of frequent occurrence, looting of shops, firing of
ch&acirc;teaux, were brought to his office. "Fools they are! all of them
fools! Can't they see that their whole world is falling to dust
about their feet, and that soon the rivers of France will be
running with blood?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;, whose young soul had always been inclined towards
rebellion, would listen wide-eyed, trying with all his might to
disentangle the right from the wrong in those tempestuous tirades.
Danton was a man of immense influence. In the clubs his power was
supreme, and it was the clubs that governed France these days; for
it was in the clubs that ministers were made and unmade. Men of all
ages, men of wide experience, bowed to Danton as to their greatest
leader. And Andr&eacute; Vallon was little more than a boy, with a boy's
enthusiasm and generous impulses, and young blood ready to boil at
sight of injustice and cruelty.</p>

<p>"Get me out an article for <i>l'Ami du Peuple</i>, Andr&eacute;," Danton would
often say to him when he came home, hoarse and tired from a noisy
s&eacute;ance at the Cordeliers. "Revolution is in the air; it gathers
strength. At Versailles the King fashions padlocks and the Queen
plays at hide-and-seek. The people starve. Make no mistake: at this
moment thousands of men are seeing their wives and children dying
of hunger. Write it, Andr&eacute;. Write it. Dip your pen in gall. Marat
will print anything you write. For God's sake, don't mince matters!
Up at Versailles they must be made to see, or the most awful
cataclysm the world has ever known will drench this country with
blood."</p>

<p>After which outburst he would go home to his young wife and with
his ardent love-making help her and himself to forget their own
grief and the misfortune of their country. But Andr&eacute; would go back
to his own dingy lodgings and try to put into words the turbulent
thoughts of his chief. And whenever his mother shook her wise old
head over these youthful lucubrations, he would excuse the more
passionate passages by saying:</p>

<p>"It is impossible to stem the fury of the people now, Mother
dear. All we can do is to lead it into as reasonable channels as we
can."</p>

<p>"Your Danton tries to cure evil with worse evils, my child,"
Marianne retorted. "How can good come from evil? Take care, Andr&eacute;!
Men like Danton have set their world rocking; when it falls
together with a crash it will drag them along, too, into the
abyss."</p>

<p>"They must take their chance, Mother," Andr&eacute; rejoined with an
impatient sigh. "We must all take our chances, for we cannot
foresee what the end of it all will be."</p>

<p>But it was not often that he was in such a serious mood.
Whenever he could obtain leave he would take the diligence to
Nervers, and thence the country chaise to Val-le-Roi. He would
burst in on his mother with the gentleness of an exploding
bombshell, and thereafter for a few days, not only the cottage, but
the country inns around, the lanes, the woods, the village streets
would echo with his laughter and his big, sonorous voice.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>The worst of the great political storm had not yet touched the
outlying villages. The people, of course, were desperately poor,
for the year had been one of the hardest the unfortunate country
had ever known; a prolonged drought had been followed by terrible
hailstorms on the very eve of harvesting; the price of corn was
prohibitive, and the winter that ensued was so severe that even
forest trees suffered from the frost. Poor? Of course they were
poor! There was no such thing as a plump girl to be seen in any
village: children were emaciated, their growth stunted, their
future health hopelessly impaired. But life had to go on just the
same. There was marriage and giving away in marriage; babies were
born and old people died; and those that were not old clung to life
in spite of the fact that it promised nothing but misery.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; Vallon's visits to Val-le-Roi were always something of
holiday for all. He was so gay, so light-hearted. The news which he
brought from Paris always seemed reassuring.</p>

<p>He would meet his friends around the bare tables of the village
inn where, over sips of thin, sour wine, he would try to put heart
into the men.</p>

<p>"It can't last, can it, Andr&eacute;?" they would ask.</p>

<p>"Of course it can't. The darkest hour always comes before the
dawn. There are some good times head for all of us. You'll
see."</p>

<p>Then he would call to Suzette, mine host's pretty daughter, and
sit her on his knee.</p>

<p>"Come, Suzette," he would say gaily, "help us to talk of
something cheerful: of your pretty self, for instance, and of
Jerome, whom you met last night in the lane. You did...don't tell
me you did not...Give us a kiss, no, this instant, or I'll tell
your worthy papa just what I saw in the lane last night."</p>

<p>And in the sunshine of his irrepressible gaiety some of them
would momentarily forget their troubles.</p>

<p>"There goes that madcap, Andr&eacute; Vallon," the older people would
say when he went down the village street, singing at the top of his
voice; "he was always a good lad, but his skin is too tight to hold
him."</p>

<p>And they would tell each other tales of Andr&eacute;'s misdeeds when he
was a boy, and of the worry which he had been to his mother: not a
lad in the village whom he had not licked at some time or another,
not a girl from whom he had not snatched a kiss. Twice he had been
within an ace of being drowned; three times he had nearly smashed
himself to pieces by falling from a tree or a rocky height; once he
had tackled farmer Lombard's bull which was after him, and with
just his two hands he had squeezed the life out of Bailiff Talon's
savage dog.</p>

<p>"Such a beautiful boy, he was," the women said.</p>

<p>And the girls giggled as he went by, for those great dark eyes
of his would look them up and down with disturbing, provoking
glances. And some of them would pause and return the glance with a
look which was more than a hint, but Andr&eacute; would only smile,
showing a gleam of white teeth. But ne'er a look of tenderness did
he cast in response, nor did the faintest whisper of love ever
cross his lips.</p>

<p>Love-making? Yes! Any amount of it. Andr&eacute;'s young arms were
forever reaching out for white shoulders or a slim waist; his full
laughter-loving mouth was always ready for a kiss, but it remained
at that: there was no girl for leagues around who could boast that
she had meant more to Andr&eacute; Vallon than the old mother whom he
worshipped.</p>

<p>But the old mother knew&mdash;or rather guessed&mdash;that there
was always something behind her son's flippancy in the manner of
women and of love. She didn't know what it was, but there was no
deceiving her&mdash;there was something. And there came a time when
she made a pretty shrewd guess. She asked no questions, of course,
but whenever the subject of the Ch&acirc;teau de Marigny and its inmates
cropped up, a strange reserve seemed to tie the boy's tongue. He
would become moody and silent, and if Marianne then pursued the
subject, spoke of the hardships so bravely borne by Monseigneur, or
said something of Mademoiselle Aurore and her angelic patience in
all her misfortunes, Andr&eacute; would suddenly jump to his feet and cry
out with extraordinary vehemence:</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me about those people, Mother. I hate them!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>But the time soon came, even in these remote villages, when
agitator and demagogues would rub their hands with glee. They would
stretch out their legs in front of their own hearths and declare
complacently that the revolution which they had foretold had not
only come but come to stay. Distress had become general; with it
stalked resentment and a fury of reprisals.</p>

<p>In the provincial towns bread riots were of constant occurrence;
the starving people had taken to looting granaries and stores; in
several cases shops, house, ch&acirc;teaux had been fired. Tub thumpers
were shouting daily to willing ears the deadly slogan: "Liberty and
Equality."</p>

<p>Paris was full of men and women who had wandered to the capital
from the neighbouring towns and villages, armed with scythes and
other agricultural implements which had become useless, since there
were no crops to harvest; starving, wrathful, and determined, they
paraded the streets shouting for redress. At street corners, in the
clubs, in public bars, malcontents waved their arms and spouted
magnificent phrases about Liberty and the sovereignty of the
people. Danton thundered forth his call to arms, to bloodshed and
revenge.</p>

<p>Misery had sown discontent and reaped revolution. Less than a
year later butchery had begun.</p>

<p>In September, '92, a brutish crowd, armed with pikes, scythes,
old blunderbusses, and rifles, rushed through the streets of Paris,
stormed the houses of detention that were overcrowded with
unfortunate prisoners, and in cold blood massacred hundreds of men,
women, and children, while Danton, the darling of the crowd, the
all-powerful party leader, did not raise a hand to stop the
carnage.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; Vallon, long before then, had given up his profession in
order to join the army. France was besieged on every side: the
whole of Europe had taken up arms against her, outraged at the
excesses of this revolution which aimed at regicide and achieved
wholesale butchery. The onus of carrying on a world war now rested
upon the shoulders of men with no experience of organization or
government. The responsibilities which hitherto had devolved solely
upon the King and his ministers were theirs now; and they were
already finding out that to depose the King, to wrest from him the
control of civil and military administration, was quite one thing,
but to defend the country against the foreign invader, with troops
whom they themselves had taught to mutiny, was quite another. To
rouse the people to insurrection had not been difficult, famine and
misery had helped in the task; but to feed a whole nation and, at
the same time, to raise an army strong enough to fight both Austria
and Prussia, was not quite so easy.</p>

<p>Already these new masters of France hated and despised one
another. Five out of the six ministers who formed the Executive
were timid and vacillating. Danton alone dominated them. He, too,
was ignorant of the essentials that make up a stable government,
but at any rate was a man&mdash;a lion amid a flock of sheep.</p>

<p>His impassioned oratory, his powerful voice, his immense
patriotism, helped to raise an army of recruits, to send them to
the frontiers, insufficiently armed, insufficiently clothed, empty
bellied and undisciplined, but full of enthusiasm for <i>la patrie</i> in
danger. There is nothing in the world that quite comes up to the
love of a Frenchman for his country. France is a beautiful country;
every corner of it is beautiful, and its sons love it with a love
that in a way transcends the patriotism of every other nation. <i>La
patrie</i> is a word that cannot be rendered in any other
language&mdash;it is not a question of home, of family, of race! it
is just France! And there are few pages in the world's history so
pathetic and yet so magnificent as this epic of raw, untrained,
famished recruits, dragging their shoeless feet along the muddy
woods of Champagne, on whose sacred soil the King of Prussia was
advancing with his well trained, highly equipped army, and, with
the sheer enthusiasm of love for their country and determination to
defend her against foreign invasion, keeping the whole of Europe at
bay.</p>

<p>At home now there remained, in addition to the women and
children, only the halt and the maimed, a few youngsters too d&eacute;bile
to bear arms, the only sons of widowed mothers, who were exempt
from military service, and the fathers of growing families. Quite a
crowd, nevertheless, and one that, in the opinion of the Executive
up in Paris, must be made to bear its part in furthering the
glorious Revolution.</p>

<p>Inflammatory placards were posted up at every street corner and
every crossroad, proclaiming the sovereignty of the people and
headed by Danton's declaration: "We must govern by fear."</p>

<p>Terror had become the order of the day. Men and
women&mdash;peaceable and respectable citizens&mdash;went in fear
of their lives. Every crime had become permissible; every act of
violence was considered patriotic; every outrage was not only
condoned but commended; so long as they were directed against those
who, through their selfish enjoyment of life, their riches, their
contentment and luxury, had proved themselves traitors to their
country and enemies of the people.</p>

<p>And men in three-cornered hats and cloth coast ornamented with
brass buttons, pot bellied and bleary eyed, were sent round the
provincial towns on a tour of active propaganda. Hoisted on tables
outside the taverns they harangue the famished crowds, denouncing
the traitors that caused all the sufferings of the people, and
foretelling an era of plenty, which certainly would soon come if
only France were swept clean of King and aristocrats.</p>

<p>At first the crowds listened in sullen silence, and in some
places it took the rogues some time to work the people up to a
state of effervescence. They were all so poor and so hungry that in
most cases all they wanted to do was to sit still and brood over
their wrongs. But the demagogues were no fools; they knew their
business. It was not inertia they wanted, or acceptance of penury.
They were out to make trouble and to stir up strife. Within half an
hour they had hurled sufficient invectives against the owner of the
nearest ch&acirc;teau&mdash;his hoard of wheat and fuel, his cellar full
of good wines&mdash;to work up the lethargic blood of these
ignorant folk into a state of frenzy. The poisonous suggestion of
reprisals began to filter down into receptive brains, and men who
saw their wives and children dying for want of food began lending a
more attentive ear to these prophecies of a panacea for all their
ills.</p>

<p>"Liberty!" and "The sovereign will of the people!" The great
slogans, thundered at them day after day, began to make an appeal
to their empty stomachs and frozen limbs. If liberty meant taking
what you want, eating your fill, and drinking good wine; if it
meant covering your wife's emaciated shoulders with a warm shawl
and putting shoes on your children's feet, then liberty by all
means!</p>

<p>In the villages the tavern orators were for the most part local
malcontents or ambitious rascals who had nothing to lose and
everything to gain by a complete upheaval of the social system.
Subsides for carrying on the propaganda came from the clubs in
Paris. It was a paying game, carried on in one village by a
defaulting clerk, in another by a dishonest servant or perhaps it
would be an absconding lawyer, or even an unfrocked priest.</p>

<p>At Val-le-Roi it was Hector Talon.</p>

<p>Talon was still nominally steward to Monseigneur le Duc de
Marigny, but the place had become a sinecure. The estates had
become so impoverished that they were no longer worth
administering. Talon knew well enough that the days of Marigny in
its present condition were numbered. Either the owner would
emigrate&mdash;as so many of his kind had done, in which case the
whole of the property would be confiscated&mdash;or he would be
arrested on some pretext or other and sent to the guillotine. And
it was quite a usual thing for faithful servants to share the fate
of their masters.</p>

<p>Now, Talon was quite determined not to share any untoward fate
with his employer or with anyone else. He wanted to be on the right
side. Not only now, but in the future.</p>

<p>Indeed, Hector Talon was no fool. He knew as well as anybody
that the present state of affairs could not possibly last; that
presently&mdash;in three, four, or even ten years,
perhaps&mdash;tempers would quieten down, and when all these
assassins who were now in power had butchered one another, an era
of moderation would then assert itself. And&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;it was just possible that the reaction would be so
great that the political pendulum would swing right over to the old
regime.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, Talon was an adept as dual <i>r&ocirc;les</i>.
Monseigneur&mdash;or ci-devant Marigny, as he was contemptuously
designated by his former sycophants&mdash;lived a solitary life up
at the ch&acirc;teau, like an eagle in its eerie, with only his daughter
for company and a couple of his old servants to wait on him. Talon
was, as it were, the only link between him and the seething world
down below. It was easy enough to throw dust in his eyes and to
persuade him that the interests of respectable citizens, be they
bailiffs or ex-dukes were identical. There certainly was the Cur&eacute;
of Val-le-Roi, the Abb&eacute; de Rosemonde, who had kept up friendship
with De Marigny and who might have enlightened him as to the real
worth of Hector Talon; but the old priest was one of those entirely
childlike natures which never see anything that is not thrust under
their very noses, who never seem to know anything of what goes on
around them, and whom it is the easiest thing in the world to
hoodwink.</p>

<p>Talon, therefore, had a clear field up at the ch&acirc;teau for his
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of faithful administrator entirely devoted to his employer's
interests. But in the village taverns, surrounded by all the
malcontents of the countryside, adulated and puffed up with his own
importance, he gave lip service to Danton and Marat, spouted
insults at every man or women who had ever owned a hectare of land,
and spat out the venom of malice and envy which was the
accumulation of years.</p>

<p>Of a truth, he was on the safe side. During the past lean years
his corpulence had melted away; he was thin now and more
bandy-legged than ever, with wide, bony shoulders and hollow belly.
His head rolled about on his long, lean neck, crowned with a
stubble of short, tawny, ill brushed hair; his lips were thin and
his mouth awry; his chin was pointed, and his hollow cheeks were
darkened with the bristles of an unshaven beard. And under
overhanging brows his eyes, which had a yellow tinge in them, were
always veiled by heavy, blue-veined lids. Unlike the regular army
of tub thumpers, he affected the meanest and dirtiest of clothes, a
ragged shirt which had not seen the washtub for months, breeches
that hardly covered his lean thighs; his shanks were bare, and his
feet were thrust in sabots stuffed with straw.</p>

<p>But he had a powerful voice and a good delivery and an easy
choice of words. For the most part he drew his inspiration for his
most inflammatory speeches from articles which he picked out of
various Paris journals.</p>

<p>"Liberty! The time has come, citizens, not only to talk of
liberty, but to fight in her sacred cause!" his was one of his
favourite tirades. And then he would go on: "Let us take up arms
like our brave soldiers on the frontier and engage in a
hand-to-hand struggle against tryanny, against all those vampires
who suck our blood and strive to break our will. France needs you,
citizens, every one of you; she needs your help to gain that
freedom for which she pines; she needs all your strength, all your
courage. She needs the patriotism of self-sacrifice. To arms,
citizens, to arms! Think no longer of yourselves or of your wives
or children! Think only of liberty. And if in your heart you should
reckon the cost of your lives, then remember that there are
forty-thousand palaces, ch&acirc;teaux, and abodes of the rich, half the
wealth of France, that will become yours in payment for your valour
and for your loyalty."</p>

<p>And after he had delivered himself of this oratory he would go
home, put on a cloth coat and breeches, woollen stockings and
buckled shoes, and make his way up to the ch&acirc;teau, and fill
Monseigneur's ears with protestations of his loyalty.</p>

<p>His wife sometimes gave him a word of warning.</p>

<p>"If the old crow should hear of your oratory..." she would
say.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't believe anything against me," Talon retorted with a
complacent snigger.</p>

<p>"Rumours do travel," Lucile insisted. "I heard in the village,
for instances, that it was you who egged that crowd on last night
to set fire to the mill and the granaries."</p>

<p>Talon nodded. "Quite true," he said drily. "I did."</p>

<p>"What was the good? The granaries were empty, and they'll want
to burn the ch&acirc;teau down next."</p>

<p>"I hope they do."</p>

<p>"What? Set fire to the ch&acirc;teau?"</p>

<p>"No. Only threaten to."</p>

<p>Lucile Talon was silent for a moment or two. By the feeble light
of a flickering tallow candle she could only partly see the
expression on her husband's face. It was not pretty at this moment,
and Lucile gave a slight shudder as she turned away and busied
herself for a time with her household affairs. But presanlty she
came back into the parlour and sat down at the table opposite her
husband.</p>

<p>"You have a plan in your head, Hector," she said decisively.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>Then, as he made no reply, only stared and stared into the
flickering flame, she added: "You won't tell me?"</p>

<p>"It is too vague at present," he replied at last, "for you to
understand."</p>

<p>And Lucile saw the yellow gleam in his eyes, shining like the
light in the eyes of a cat.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>It was eleven years almost to a day since M. l'Abb&eacute; de
Rosemonde, Cur&eacute; de Val-le-Roi, had toiled up the slope to the
Ch&acirc;teau de Marigny with his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Andr&eacute; Vallon. Then, as
now, a hot July sun flooded the pointed roofs with silvery lights.
Only a few white fleecy clouds flitted across the cobalt sky. The
birds sang in the forest trees; the branches of walnut and sycamore
quivered under the breath of a gentle summer breeze. In the valley
below, the Allier gurgled softly among the reeds, and the weeping
willows along its banks set forth their sweet, sad sighing through
the noonday air.</p>

<p>Nature, lovely and impersonal, seemed by her serene beauty to
mock at all the turmoil, the hideousness created by men. "Look at
me," she seemed to say. "My laws are immutable. I destroy nothing
without cause. Death in my infinite wisdom is only the maker of
life."</p>

<p>M. le Cur&eacute; looked about him and sighed. He could almost have
wished that God's world would cease to be beautiful since men no
longer had eyes to see the glory of His creations. He was an old
man now. These last few years had put a heavy burden upon him. Torn
between his hatred of the present godless regime and his desire to
do what little good he could among these poor misguided folk to
whom he had ministered for more than thirty years, he had at last
decided to take the oath of allegiance to this impious government
which he abhorred, simply because he did not wish to leave
Val-le-Roi to its fate. In spite of threats, in spite of
persecution, he had managed so far to keep his church open, to hold
occasional services, to visit the sick, and to administer the
sacraments.</p>

<p>On this beautiful morning in mid-July when he came in sight of
the ch&acirc;teau, he experienced the same heartache which assailed him
every time he noted the slow but sure ravages of neglect upon the
magnificent pile. It was many years now since flowers had graced
the parterres of the garden and thrown their gay note of brilliance
against the subdued colouring of the age-old stonework. The
bosquest now were withered; the fountains still; marble balustrades
and terraces were covered with the soil and litter of years.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; sighed again and wearily made his way up the <i>perron</i>.
The monumental gates opened at a touch; the cracked bell which he
pulled echoed weirdly through the silent halls. There were no
servants in gorgeous liveries now to wait on visitors; no sound of
gaiety or laughter came reverberating through this silence, which
seemed as solemn as that of a tomb. The old priest crossed the vast
hall and made his way up the great marble staircase and through the
length of the gorgeous apartments, which stretched en enfilade to
the farthest angle of the ch&acirc;teau. Here he came to a halt and
knocked at the door that faced him. A woman's voice called,
"Entrez!" and he stepped into the room.</p>

<p>At sight of him a young girl jumped up from the low stool
whereon she had been sitting, threw down a book, and came to greet
him with hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"M. l'Abb&eacute;!" she cried. "How kind of you to come, and in this
heat, too! Do sit down. You must be tired. Papa and I were just
saying that perhaps you would not come till later in the day."</p>

<p>The good Cur&eacute; took the two soft white hands that were so eagerly
tendered him and then turned to pay his respects to Monseigneur.
Like the Cur&eacute; himself, Monseigneur le Duc de Marigny had in the
past few years become a very old man. Misfortune and anxiety had
put a quarter of a century onto his years. Like so many men of his
generation and caste, he had made a splendid effort to bear with
outward fortitude the terrible calamities that well-nigh
overwhelmed him, but obviously the fortitude had only been on the
surface. Every line on his face showed that he had suffered and was
suffering terribly. He had the appearance of a martyr, conscious of
his martyrdom. He had see his friends, his relatives, one by one,
either driven to exile or to death, and calmly awaited the hour
when he would be called to share their fate. Were it not for his
daughter he would have welcomed that hour, nay! even have gone
forward boldly to meet it. But there was Aurore, his child, the
darling of his shrivelled heart. Because of her he was willing to
shelter beneath the protection which his near relationship with
that infamous Duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, who had cast his vote in favour of the
death sentence on his cousin and King, had so far given him.
Because of his cousinship with that man he had escaped persecution
at the hands of the Committee of Public Safety: his name had not as
yet appeared on the list of the "suspect." He accepted this slur
upon it for Aurore's sake, but had suffered agonies of humiliation
for this immunity. In his eyes to-day, dimmed not so much with age
as with unshed tears, there smouldered the fire of bitter
resentment. Not even to his daughter, not even to the kindly
priest, his one remaining friend, did he open out his innermost
thoughts, his desperate longing for revenge.</p>

<p>On this occasion, as indeed always, he greeted the Cur&eacute; with the
greatest friendliness. Cut off from all his friends and all his
kindred, the Abb&eacute; de Rosemonde seemed like a last link with the
happy past. They had become like two old cronies, these two, not
talking much to each other, because there were so few pleasant
things to talk about, but they often had friendly bouts at chess or
piquet, and instinctively the old Duke felt the soothing influence
of his friend's Christian philosophy.</p>

<p>Aurore had put a chair in a convenient position, and the Abb&eacute;
fell into it, panting and blowing, for the day was hot and the
climb up the hill steep.</p>

<p>"I wish I could offer you a glass of wine," Monseigneur said
with a fretful little sigh, "but I have not a bottle left in the
cellar."</p>

<p>Aurore poured out a glass of water for the old priest, who drank
it eagerly, and then set to with great energy to mop his streaming
face and neck.</p>

<p>"The best wine in the world, monseigneur," he said cheerfully,
"is this fresh water from the well. I am not tired, I assure you,
my dear little Aurore, and even if I were, your smile would comfort
me more thoroughly than the finest bottle of Burgundy."</p>

<p>Monseigneur gave a significant grunt and turned his head
away.</p>

<p>"Well!" the priest went on after a moment or two. "What
news?"</p>

<p>"The very best," Aurore de Marigny said eagerly. "I found the
box I told you about, and, oh! M. l'Abb&eacute;, it is full, full of
lovely things&mdash;stockings and shirts and petticoats. They will
be so useful for many of the poor mothers this winter."</p>

<p>She chattered away in great excitement, her eyes sparkling and
her cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>"And they won't as much as say 'Thank you!' for them,"
Monseigneur put in drily.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they will!" the girl asserted. "And even if they
don't..."</p>

<p>She gave a little shrug. What cared she if she got thanks or no,
so long as she could find something to do, something in which to
interest herself, to make time slip by a little more swiftly? The
days were so long and so dreary! Nothing to do, nothing to think of
or to hope for, save to bring now and again the ghost of a smile on
Papa's face. To help M. l'Abb&eacute; in his charitable work was a perfect
godsend, now that she saw her youth slipping by before she had
begun to understand the true and inner meaning of such things as
happiness and love. She was barely nineteen when her world began to
crash about her feet, when she first came face to face with
ill-will, malevolence, even hatred. Until that hour the world had
been one great thing of beauty. Loveliness was the very essence of
her young life. She inhaled love and adulation with every breath
she drew. When she took her walks abroad people got out of her way
to allow her to pass. Glances of admiration accompanied her all the
way she went. Gentle expressions of respect, often a murmured
blessing, were the words that most often rang in her ears.</p>

<p>Then suddenly came the crash: an awful cataclysm seemed to sweep
the whole of her past into an immeasurable abyss. Glowering looks,
sullen glances, objurgations, even insults were cast at her, until
she no longer dared to set foot beyond the precincts of the castle.
One by one the servants, who she thought loved her, who had seen
her grow up from babyhood, fled from the ch&acirc;teau as from a
plague-ridden spot. And slowly her childlike mind began to unfold:
it had been closed hitherto to outward things as is a flower bud
sheltered beneath a canopy of leaves. But soon her quick
intelligence grasped the true significance of what was going on
around her, and the Abb&eacute; de Rosemonde, with the utmost gentleness
and care, helped in the development of her understanding.</p>

<p>Aurore de Marigny never took a gloomy view of life. She accepted
a great deal which was rousing her father's bitter resentment as
inevitable; as she was very young, she never gave up hope. These
years of indigence and anxiety were only transitory: of this she
was sure. But while she did her best to infuse some of that hope
into her father's soul, she would in the lineliness of her little
bedroom shed many a bitter tear over her lost youth. Better times
might come presently&mdash;they certainly would come, she knew they
would&mdash;but she would be old by then; her beauty would be gone
along with her youth; she would no longer be desirable; she would
never learn the great lesson of life, the lesson of Love.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>Aurore had dragged the good old Cur&eacute; along interminable
corridors, and up interminable stairs to a distant attic, where,
beneath the old oak beams, covered with dust and cobwebs, and
ancient black leather trunk stood open, with most of its contents
already scattered about the floor.</p>

<p>Aurore went through them methodically, and M. le Cur&eacute; nodded
approval, or the reverse, as she held up the garments one by one to
the dim light.</p>

<p>"These stockings are strong," she said. "They'll do for
Legendre's children. This shawl we'll give to Marianne Vallon; she
has nothing of the sort, poor thing. These silks are not much use,
but what do you think of these cloth breeches? They are just the
right size for Chabot's boy. Oh! and do look, M. l'Abb&eacute;, here is a
beautiful travelling coat, warm and thick. You'll have to think of
someone for whom it would be really useful."</p>

<p>She was squatting back on her heels, turning a great heavy cloth
coat over and over.</p>

<p>"It is rather moth-eaten in places," she said ruefully, "but
that wouldn't matter much. I believe it was Papa's travelling coat
when he and Maman used to post in Paris..."</p>

<p>She paused with the coat in her delicate hands and looked up at
the priest with a troubled expression in her eyes.</p>

<p>"M. l'Abb&eacute;," she said abruptly, "do you think it would be
possible to warn Papa against that awful Talon?"</p>

<p>The Cur&eacute; looked astonished, not to say shocked.</p>

<p>"My dear child!" he exclaimed. "An old and faithful
servant!"</p>

<p>"He is not," Aurore said decisively. "I am sure he is not. He is
a hypocrite&mdash;he talks softly to Papa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My little Aurore, you must not say those things. Where is your
Christian charity? What has poor Hector Talon done?"</p>

<p>"He incites the people down in the village against us."</p>

<p>"But what makes you say such a thing? You really haven't the
right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"M. l'Abb&eacute;, listen to me," Aurore rejoined firmly. "You know
Marianne Vallon down in the village?"</p>

<p>"I do. A good woman and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is a good woman, I daresay, though she seems to hate
us."</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear child. You must not jump to conclusions like
that. Marianne is a very unhappy woman. Her only son, whom she
adored, went to the war a year ago and has not been heard of since.
She feels rather bitter about everything. But hatred? No! no!"</p>

<p>"Well, that is as it may be," Aurore rejoined with some
impatience; "but she said something yesterday which has confirmed
my opinion about Talon. I suspected him long ago, but since
yesterday..."</p>

<p>"Well? And what did Marianne say?"</p>

<p>"That it was Talon who egged on those people to fire the mill
and the granaries."</p>

<p>The Cur&eacute; raised his hands in protest.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed. "I cannot believe that."</p>

<p>"Then you think that Marianne Vallon deliberately told me a
lie?"</p>

<p>The old priest felt cornered. His brain, which was not
overbrilliant, though intensely kindly, had to make a choice
between calling a man a traitor or a woman a liar. He shrank from
either conclusion; he hummed and hawed and did his best to avoid
Aurore's searching eyes. In the end he compromised.</p>

<p>"Talon," he said, "may have said something that those poor
people misunderstood. And there is no doubt, alas! that, with their
minds turned away from God, the devil has a great hold over their
souls. But I am sure," he added hopefully, "that they have already
regretted their action of the other night."</p>

<p>"Only because they found the granaries empty," Aurore concluded
with a shrug.</p>

<p>What was the use of arguing? This incorrigible optimist was as
surely courting disaster as was her father with his bitter
resentment. She gave an impatient little sigh and returned to the
more pleasing subject of stockings and petticoats.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>Indeed, Aurore de Marigny's anxiety would have turned to real
alarm could she have guessed Talon's purpose in coming up to the
ch&acirc;teau to-day.</p>

<p>He made his way quite unceremoniously to the small boudoir where
Monseigneur usually sat, entered without knocking and with all the
assurance of a privileged guest, rather than of a servant. Charles
de Marigny always writhed at this show of independence on the part
of his once obsequious bailiff. In spite of his outward stoicism,
he had not yet become accustomed to those principles of equality
which placed the caitiff on a level with the seigneur. Every time
that Talon came into his presence with the swaggering air of an
equal, and the suggestion of sympathy and protection more galling
than enmity, Monseigneur would grind his teeth and clench his hands
in an effort not to strike the insolent varlet. But he had enough
sense to realize that, as far as the future was concerned, his
safety, and perhaps his life and that of Aurore were dependent on
this man's good-will: so he swallowed his wrath and returned
Talon's casual greeting with as much heartiness as he could.</p>

<p>With scant ceremony the bailiff took the chair lately occupied
by the Abb&eacute;, poured himself out a glass of water, drank it down,
and remarked with an attempt at jocularity:</p>

<p>"No more Burgundy in the cellar, eh? Well! never mind, better
times will be coming soon."</p>

<p>Then he talked about the weather, commented on the latest news
from Paris, seeming not to notice Monseigneur's absorption. At last
Charles de Maringy broke in impatiently:</p>

<p>"Well, what about the granaries?"</p>

<p>Talon sighed and dolefully shook his head.</p>

<p>"Burnt to the ground. Nothing saved."</p>

<p>"And the mill?"</p>

<p>"Alas!"</p>

<p>Monseigneur had made a vigorous effort to control his temper,
but with each curt answer from his bailiff the veins on his temples
stood out more and more like cords, and he pressed his lips tightly
together because he felt that his breath was coming and going with
a hissing sound. All of which Talon did not fail to notice, even
while he appeared absorbed in picking at the nails of one hand with
those of the other.</p>

<p>"And," Monseigneur asked, after a moment or two when he thought
that his voice would sound steady, "what have you done about
it?"</p>

<p>"I, my dear sir!" Talon exclaimed, "what do you suppose I can
do?"</p>

<p>This easy familiarity, this jaunty "my dear sir" required yet
another effort on De Marigny's part to keep his temper. He did it,
nevertheless, forced himself to appear at ease with this man the
very sight of whom he detested, and after a moment he said with
quiet deliberation:</p>

<p>"I ordered you, some time ago, when that raffish mob fired my
bakery, to let the miscreants know that for every building of mine
which they destroyed I would raze one of their cottages to the very
ground."</p>

<p>"But, my dear friend&mdash;" began Talon in protest.</p>

<p>"I am not your dear friend," Charles de Marigny broke in, on the
fringe of exasperation, "but your employer! I gave you certain
orders. Did you execute them?"</p>

<p>"I did my best. I threw out hints. I warned them, but I dare not
do more."</p>

<p>"Your warnings were no use, apparently. Two valuable granaries
have been wantonly destroyed: also the mill, which cost thousands
to build only have a dozen years ago: find me a handful of honest
men&mdash;men who will do what they are paid to do. Choose any two
cottages in the village you like, evict the tenants, and let not
one stone remain upstanding."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur!&mdash;" Talon exclaimed with a gasp.</p>

<p>"Ah!" De Marigny rejoined with a sneer. "It has brought you to
your senses, too, has it? You realize that I am not your dear
friend but a man who has not forgotten either his position or his
rights? Those devils up in Paris talk of a government by terror.
Terror, they say, is the order of the day, and they remain in power
because they govern by fear. Terror is going to be the order of the
day on my estate. An eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth. A cottage
for my granary; a house for my mill. Find me the men, Talon: I'll
show those dastardly ruffians down there that I am still their lord
and master."</p>

<p>Charles de Marigny had worked himself up into a state bordering
on frenzy. All his common sense, his stoicism had fled to the
winds. He had nursed his resentment, his longing to hit back, for
so long that all this wanton outrage against his property he lost
all sense of proportion, and seized the opportunity to strike, and
strike again, not counting the cost of the deadly danger. If he had
been perfectly sane at the moment he not only would have realized
the folly of such arrogance, but he would not have failed to notice
that his bailiff, far from appearing horrified at the monstrous
suggestion or frightened at its probably consequences, sat huddled
up in his chair with his bony hand across his mouth.</p>

<p>Talon was doing his best to conceal the sneer that lurked around
his lips and the gleam of triumph that shot through his eyes. For
months now he had worked for this: to bring this arrogant fool to a
state of exasperation had been the aim and object of all his
scheming and his double game. Those whom the dogs wish to punish
they first strike with madness. Talon knew no Latin, but he did
know that he had at last succeeded in bringing to the point of
frenzy the man on whom depended the success of all his well laid
plans.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," he murmured again. "You don't seem to realize the
temper of the people..."</p>

<p>He had shed his easy familiarity as he would a mantle; he was
obsequious, servile, cringing now.</p>

<p>"It is time they realized mine," De Marigny retorted proudly. "I
or that rabble. One of us must be the master here."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately they have the power...and the numbers. You are
alone."</p>

<p>Monseigneur said nothing for the moment. He sat staring out of
the window through which he could perceive over the treetops the
ruins of his mill and his granaries. It seemed as if his outburst
had tired him out. He looked, all of a sudden, like a sick and
weary old man; the blood was ebbing out of his temples; he closed
his eyes for a moment or two, and a long sigh broke through his
trembling lips.</p>

<p>Talon drew his chair a little closer to him, and, sinking his
harsh voice to an insinuating whisper, he said:</p>

<p>"Why not turn your back on the rabble? Get away to England or
Belgium...emigrate. So many of your friends have done it..."</p>

<p>Monseigneur made no reply; but Talon, whose keen eyes were
watching every change on the proud, expressive face, saw a sudden
softening of its lines, as if an invisible hand had passed over
them and erased all that were hard and cruel. And in the eyes there
crept a look which was almost one of yearning.</p>

<p>"So many have done it," Talon reiterated. "It is the only road
to safety."</p>

<p>But, as quickly as they had come, softness and yearning had
already vanished from De Marigny's expression; once more the eyes
became hard, the mouth obstinate.</p>

<p>"I'll not go, Talon," he said forcefully, and brought his
clenched fist down on the arm of his chair. "I will see this
devilry through to the end. I will hold the fort against this
rabble, though, as you say, I must do it alone, but nobody shall
lord it over Marigny while I live."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be a case of any one 'lording' it," Talon murmured,
"only of a temporary arrangement. Scores of gentlemen have done
it...and it is the safest plan."</p>

<p>He waited a moment or two, then he added:</p>

<p>"The safest plan for you and Mademoiselle Aurore."</p>

<p>This time the blow had gone him. Charles de Marigny could not
suppress a cry of anguish.</p>

<p>"Aurore!"</p>

<p>"But," he went on slowly, speaking as if to himself, "if we
go&mdash;if we&mdash;if we emigrate&mdash;those devils will
confiscate the whole of my property, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Talon had to make a great effort to conceal the gleam of
satisfaction that shot through his yellow eyes: Monseigneur had
started to argue the point&mdash;and that was the first sign of
defeat.</p>

<p>"Only nominally," he said. "The whole plan is of the
simplest&mdash;as I said just now&mdash;a temporary
arrangement..."</p>

<p>"What temporary arrangement?" De Marigny asked with a frown.</p>

<p>"A paper making the property over to&mdash;to&mdash;a faithful
servant&mdash;just a temporary arrangement, as I say&mdash;the
other party undertaking to restore the property to its original
owner on demand. It is done every day, my friend. Half the estates
in France, at this moment, are nominally the property of men who
have undertaken to administer them on the quiet, till times are
better..."</p>

<p>"In this case you mean yourself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know that, my good sir. The risks are very great,
you must remember."</p>

<p>"How do you mean&mdash;the risks? There are no risks, except for
the unfortunate owners who put themselves at the mercy of
knaves."</p>

<p>"Only for the time being&mdash;always supposing that those
others are knaves. But when life is at stake&mdash;and not only
one's own life, but that of others who are very dear&mdash;well,
one must take certain risks. And there is little risk in trusting a
faithful servant who has looked after your interests for twenty
years."</p>

<p>Talon had a persuasive tongue, and as soon as he noted that his
suggestion had made a breach in Monseigneur's armour of pride and
obstinacy, he pressed his point home. It was done every day. The
sale of the estate was nominal. The price paid in worthless bits of
government bonds. Talon had once more dropped his show of
servility. He "dear sir"-ed and "my dear friend"-ed De Marigny
because he had not rejected the proposal with scorn but was
pondering over it. Half the battle, then, was already won, and
Talon saw himself in possession of Marigny, at any rate for a
number of years, long enough to build a good nest egg and then to
flit out of the country if times changed back to the old regime and
he was summarily dispossessed.</p>

<p>"You, as the owner, would run no risk," he went on more glibly.
"The risks would all be mine, if I undertook the task, for I might
be denounced as a traitor for my devotion to you. But you! Why, my
dear friend, you could go away to England or Belgium with
Mademoiselle Aurore, and when you came back to Marigny four or five
years hence&mdash;the present state of things cannot last longer
than that&mdash;you will find your estates impoverished, no doubt,
but your house standing where it did."</p>

<p>He rose, preparing to take his leave. He knew well enough that
he had sown the right seed in fairly receptive soil and that to say
more just now might imperil the happy issue of his fight. Whether,
when once more left to himself, Charles de Marigny would return to
his state of arrogance and frenzy or ponder more deeply over his
bailiff's suggestion was on the knees of the gods. It was no use
thinking that the battle was already won. It was not. There was a
chink in the armour of obstinacy, and that was all.</p>

<p>"I'll bring you the papers in a day or two," he said casually,
as he took his leave. "It is quite a simple affair. You acknowledge
having received a certain sum from me for the sale of all your
properties wheresoever situated, and I sign an undertaking to
restore them to you on demand and the repayment of the money."</p>

<p>"On demand?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes! You are not likely to return to this hell upon earth,
are you? Unless times have much changed."</p>

<p>And Charles de Marigny, as if wear of struggle and argument,
assented somewhat lamely.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Talon. Quite right! You are right, I am sure, and you
mean well. Bring me the papers; I'll look at them."</p>

<p>"In the meanwhile I'll give it out more decidedly that if any
more arson occurs on your property you will give as good as you
get."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" Monseigneur assented, his exasperation getting, at
last, completely the better of his good sense. "Do what you like,
but, for God's sake, get out of my sight now! I am sick of you and
your ugly face."</p>

<p>Talon grinned. Memory took him back to those days before the
great upheaval, when Monseigneur le Duc de Marigny was in the habit
of thus dismissing his obsequious bailiff. Times had changed, but
not Monseigneur. Talon knew well enough that beneath a great deal
of show of stoicism the old Adam could always be reckoned with.
Because of that old Adam of arrogance and tyranny he would gain his
point. Monseigneur would be forced to yield Marigny up to him or
perish at the hands of an infuriated mob.</p>

<p>And Hector Talon made his way home, satisfied with the morning's
work.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>By the time that Aurore and the Abb&eacute; Rosemonde had finished
sorting out the treasures of the old leather trunk Talon had left
the ch&acirc;teau. Aurore found her father looking thoughtful.</p>

<p>"That rascal Talon," he said presently, speaking as it were to
himself, "is no fool. His advice is sound." He drew the girl to him
and looked searchingly into her eager young face. "My little
Aurore," he went on wistfully, "would you like to put all these
horrors behind you and seek refuge somewhere where we could have
peace?"</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;emigrate, Father?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"And lose Marigny? They confiscate everything if one
emigrates."</p>

<p>"If it could be done without losing Marigny?"</p>

<p>"Even so...?"</p>

<p>"You don't want to go?"</p>

<p>"I want to do whatever you think is right; but&mdash;I love
Marigny." And Aurore's dreamy eyes, full of a vague yearning, swept
over the beautiful vista around, the wooded slopes, the distant
ribbon of the Allier whispering among the reeds, the steeples of
the village churches peeping out between the clumps of sycamore and
walnut. All this meant home to her. She had never known another.
Even the palace in Paris had been but a pied-&agrave;-terre for her:
Marigny alone was home. "I love it," she reiterated with a sigh. "I
know every tree in the forest, every shrub in the coppice, the call
of every bird. To go away into the unknown frightens me,
somehow."</p>

<p>"Now, that is sheer childishness, Aurore," her father said
sternly. "My dear Abb&eacute;, help me to get those silly fancies out of
her head."</p>

<p>The old priest had stood by in discreet silence, ostensibly
engrossed in looking over again the old clothes he was going to
distribute in the village. At Aurore's outburst he looked up, and
now that Monseigneur appealed to him he came and placed a hand on
the girl's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I should miss you terribly in the village, my child," he said,
"but I agree with your father. If it can be done, it would be wiser
to go away. It will only be for a time."</p>

<p>"Do they hate us here so much as all that?" she asked. Probably
she would have broken down then and had a good cry. It seemed so
cruel that, in spite of every effort towards forgiveness and
charity, it was impossible to combat that hatred which a lot of
irresponsible and cruel demagogues had instilled into the hearts of
the people of France. But Aurore met her father's anxious, loving
glance fixed upon her: young as she was, she knew that he depended
on her for every tiny gleam of joy or happiness that she was able
to give, and also that at sight of her grief his bitter resentment
and suffering would increase a hundredfold. So she swallowed her
tears, gave her father a good kiss, then turned once more to the
old priest, smiling through her tears:</p>

<p>"Let us go straightway to the village now, M. le Cur&eacute;," she
said. "I do want the Legendre children to have those stockings
soon. And," she added with a light laugh, "I have not yet done my
marketing to-day."</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when Aurore de Marigny made her way back
from the village toward the ch&acirc;teau. Jeannette was with her and
carried her market basket. She was an elderly woman who had served
the ducal family almost from childhood, when she began life as a
scullery wench. She had lost mother, father, kindred, one after the
other, and gradually her whole life became entirely dependent upon
the ch&acirc;teau. When approaching middle age she had married Pierre,
one of the men-servants, and after that had carried on just as
before. She never had any children. Somehow she had never wanted
any. And then when, one by one, the other servants of the ch&acirc;teau
ran away, terrified lest they should be identified with unpopular
aristos, Pierre and Jeannette had stayed on, chiefly because they
had nowhere else to go. What few services were required of
them&mdash;the little bit of cooking and cleaning&mdash;they did
quite ungrudgingly but without enthusiasm. They seemed to have
become a pair of automatons, with undeveloped brains and a vague
protective instinct towards Aurore de Marigny and Monseigneur who
gave them shelter and food.</p>

<p>Together Aurore and Jeannette walked rapidly along the road,
which at this point follows the river bank until it branches off to
the wooded slopes which lead up to the ch&acirc;teau. They had gone past
the last two or three outlying cottages, and the road stretched out
before them like a white ribbon, sun-baked, dusty, and solitary.
They had seen no one for some time when, suddenly, a man came into
view around a bend, walking slowly towards them. He looked wearied,
ragged, and dirty, but in this was no different from many other
wayfarers on the high roads these days; but there was something in
his limping gait, in his stooping shoulders, and in his head, which
fell forward on his chest and rolled round and round as if
insecurely held by his neck, which gave the idea of fatigue verging
on complete collapse.</p>

<p>As the man drew nearer Aurore perceived that he wore a military
coat and breeches, both in the last stages of decay, and that he
had no shoes on his feet, which were bleeding and covered with
grime. His head was bare, and a shocked of chestnut-brown tousled
hair fell like a mop over his face. Aurore noted, also, that the
right sleeve of his tattered coat was hanging empty.</p>

<p>Obviously, a miserable soldier, making his way home from the
way. As he came close up to the two women he stumbled and would
certainly have fallen had not Aurore put out her arms.
Instinctively, with his one hand he seized hold of hers, and
remained quite still for a moment or two, trying to steady himself
and clinging blindly to this unexpected support. Then he raised his
head and shook the mop of hair away from his face. Aurore
encountered a pair of dark eyes, lack-lustre and glassy, and with
an unseeing vagueness in their dilated pupils. She did not dare
move for fear of seeing the man fall at her feet, but she half
turned her head to Jeannette and said quickly:</p>

<p>"That drop of wine in the small bottle...give it here..."</p>

<p>At sound of the voice the glassiness went out of the man's eyes.
The pupils contracted, and a deep frown appeared between his brows.
He seemed suddenly to realize that the prop which supported him was
a woman's arm, and with a great effort he steadied himself on his
feet. A curious light flashed from his eyes, which seemed to sweep
Aurore from head to foot.</p>

<p>Jeannette muttered something about wasting good stuff which had
cost so much to procure, but Aurore spoke impatiently:</p>

<p>"The bottle, Jeannette! Quick!"</p>

<p>Under the man's curious sweeping glance she felt her cheeks
flushing, but still she did not move, holding out her arm quite
stiffly until his hold on it relaxed. Then she frowned and turned
her head away, for the man was staring at her still, and there was
something in that stare, a certain contempt or even enmity, which
almost caused her to take to her heels and run. But she held her
round, and when, presently, Jeannette handed her the bottle, she
took it and held it out to the man. With a sweep of his arm he
brushed it away, then threw back his head and laughed. It was a
strange laugh, hard and mirthless, which caused the suspicion of a
shiver to run down Aurore's spine&mdash;a shiver not of fear (for
what was there to fear in this miserable, maimed creature?), but of
recoil, as if in the presence of something weird and not altogether
earthly. But that was only a momentary weakness: the man looked so
unutterably wretched that tears of pity, never absent from the
depths of Aurore's sympathetic head, welled up to her eyes.
Instinctively she felt, however, that pity in this case would be
unwelcome; repulsed, perhaps, with that contempt which still
lingered in the man's eyes; so she closed her own for a moment or
two, lest the tears trickle down her cheeks.</p>

<p>When she opened them again the man had passed by.</p>

<p>"Come, Jeannette," Aurore said quickly, "let us get home."</p>

<p>Jeanette, stolid and silent, had rearranged the market basket
and started to walk beside her mistress.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness," she said, "this good wine was not wasted. It
would have been a sin to deprive Monseigneur of it for the sake of
that down-at-heel vagabond."</p>

<p>After a while she added: "You know who that was, don't you,
mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"No," Aurore replied. "How should I?"</p>

<p>"It was Andr&eacute; Vallon. I knew him at once, though he looks a
miserable bag of bones now."</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute; Vallon?"</p>

<p>"Marianne's son. Mademoiselle must recollect."</p>

<p>"But how should I?" Aurore reiterated frowning.</p>

<p>Mechanically, however, she had paused for a moment and turned
round to look at the retreating figure. Strangely enough, the man,
too, had paused and looked back; and once more their eyes met.
There was a distance of some ten metres between them now: the man,
whoever he was, shrugged and laughed as soon as he had caught her
glance; then he turned and went his way; but Aurore was again
conscious of that vague sense of terror, as if something fateful
and irresistible had come across her path. It was nonsense, of
course. Again and again she said to herself: "What is there to
fear?" Unfortunately, these days, inimical glances were more
familiar to her than kindly ones; she was accustomed to looks of
derision, even of hatred, to threatening words and menace of
violence. The wretched vagabond who had just gone by had not
spoken; had threatened with neither word nor gesture; but never in
all these fateful days had she encountered a glance so full of
latent contempt and almost unearthly hatred.</p>

<p>"Tell me about this&mdash;this Andr&eacute; Vallon&mdash;was that the
name?" she said presently to Jeannette, while together the two of
them walked up the slope.</p>

<p>Jeannette, whose powers of narration were limited, began a long
and involved tale on the subject. She talked of Andr&eacute; and his
mother; of the boy's early turbulent life in the village which
ended abruptly and violently in a public whipping in the market
square for disorderly conduct. Jeannette could not remember the
details, but she had heard it said in the village that young Vallon
had sworn deadly enmity against all those who had been present and
seen his humiliation.</p>

<p>"He went up to Paris after that," Jeannette went on to relate,
"and got under the thumb of that murdering blackguard Danton. So I
shouldn't wonder if he has become just such another assassin
himself. I shouldn't care to meet him alone on the road. But, as I
used to say to his mother long ago, she would spoil him. She let
him think he was somebody, though he was nothing better, even in
those days, then a young ne'er-do-weel. And the woman spoilt him,
too, because he had flashing eyes and a way with him. Dirty young
blackguard, I call him."</p>

<p>She went meandering on, not caring whether her mistress listened
to her or not. She had the usual anecdotes to tell of Andr&eacute;'s
turpitude, and the perpetual mischief he would get into, causing
his mother endless worry.</p>

<p>Aurore only listened with half an ear. Vague memories floated
through her mind of a glorious day such as this in mid-July. Her
birthday. Her young friends. A game of blindman's bluff. And then
the face of a boy with flashing black eyes, a shock of chestnut
hair from which the hot sun drew glints of shining copper, and of a
brown, slender hand holding a futile, useless pocketknife.</p>

<p>It all seemed like a dream now. Later on she had heard the story
of the same boy being publicly whipped in the market square for
having killed Hector Talon's savage dog, and she remembered feeling
sorry for him, because already in those days she had instinctively
disliked Talon. How it all came back now! Her pity for the boy, her
dread at sight of his flashing dark eyes and of his beautiful face
convulsed with rage because Pierre de Maul&eacute;on had slapped his
cheek. And the heavy scent of earth which had offended her nostrils
when, blindfolded, she fell against his breast.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>Soon the news was all over the countryside that Andr&eacute; Valon had
come home from the war, and the very next day Marianne's doorstep
was besieged with people who not only wanted to see the boy, but
wished to know just what was going on over in Champagne or Verdun;
whether the King of Prussia was really marching on Paris, or
whether he had been defeated by the brave national army and was now
in full retreat.</p>

<p>Somehow, too, it had become known that Andr&eacute; had both won his
epaulettes and lost his left arm at Valmy, where the King of
Prussia had suffered a severe defeat. Rumours of that
victory&mdash;one of the rare ones&mdash;had penetrated as far as
Val-le-Roi; Danton had made grandiloquent allusions to it in the
National Assembly, had talked volubly about "our glorious troops,
our valorous soldiers who were sweeping the whole of Europe clean
of tyrants and militarism." He spoke of "their heroic deaths,
fighting in the glorious cause of liberty," and "sacrificing their
noble lives with the smile of martyrs going to glory, so that the
world might, at least, be safe for democracy."</p>

<p>What he did not talk of were the unspeakable privations, the
almost unbelievable hardships which, indeed, had been endured by
the troops with a stoicism and heroic obstinacy almost without
parallel in the history of the world. Andr&eacute; himself never spoke
about that. That he had suffered, and suffered terribly, along with
the troops which he had helped to lead to victory, could be seen by
the unnatural glitter that came to his eyes whenever friends
pressed him to tell them something of that well equipped and well
fed army of Prussians and Austrians who were attacking France just
because she had thrown off the shackles of tyranny and led the
vanguard to an era of equality and of liberty. An almost cruel
curve would then distort Andr&eacute;'s lips when he spoke of the Austrian
officers in their smart uniforms, or the Prussian troops with their
good boots and well filled bellies, all fighting in the cause of
those aristos who had so complacently shaken the dust of starving
France from their high-heeled shoes and were disporting themselves
in comfort and safety in Belgium or England. And he would glance up
into the distance, where, outlined against the summer sky, the
pinnacles and pointed roofs of the Ch&acirc;teau de Marigny towered above
the treetops, and the look in his eyes became almost one of
frenzied hatred, whilst words such as Danton himself would have
emulated came hoarsely from his parched throat. He hated them.
Heavens above, how he hated them all! It was a hatred akin to
physical anguish, one that had been born in his heart when he was a
mere child, on that day of bitter humiliation when he had stood
naked at the whipping post, exposed to the mocking gaze of those
aristos with their perfumed hair and bejewelled lorgnettes. That
had been a boy's hatred, but now it was the hatred of a man filled
to the soul with bitter resentment and the yearning for some
measure of revenge.</p>

<p>But it was when the gleam of that resentment glittered most
vividly in her son's eyes that Marianne's podgy, toil-hardened hand
would descend with a soothing pressure upon his shoulder. Her calm
philosophy would express itself in a few clumsy words, and Andr&eacute;
would pat that kindly hand and kiss it and make a big effort to
subdue the paroxysm of his fury.</p>

<p>"All I long for, Maman <i>ch&eacute;rie</i>," he would say, as calmly as he
could, "is that I may live long enough to see the destruction for
this old world and the rebuilding of the new. Nothing else will do,
my dear one, but complete annihilation of everything. There is
corruption everywhere; uncleanness, crying evils too deeply rooted
to be remedied. The world is overgrown with tares; nothing but a
world conflagration can render it clean again."</p>

<p>At which Marianne would nod her head and reply gently: "The
worst tare of all, Andr&eacute;, is hatred. How can you reap anything but
conflict if you sow that?"</p>

<p>"It is not hate, Mother, that will set the world aflame, but
justice. Something has got to be done. Those who have mocked at
misery and done nothing to alleviate it must be made to suffer.
Those who have enjoyed life, who have always eaten and drunk their
fill&mdash;they have got to learn what it feels like to be so
cold&mdash;so cold that your chattering teeth seem ready to fall
out of your jaws and to feel your belly so hollow that you would
gnaw the flesh off your own limbs. They have got to know something
of suffering, Mother. It is justice, and it has got to be."</p>

<p>But Marianne would still shake her wise old head. Justice? When
had there ever been justice in this old world in which she had
lived long and endured so much? There had been no justice in the
days that were past, when up at the ch&acirc;teau&mdash;whither she
trudged day after day, in order to do the family washing&mdash;she
saw buckets full of meal and skim milk thrown to the pits, and fat,
meaty bones given to the dogs, which would have kept her and her
boy free from hunger. Was there justice now, when soldiers who were
fighting for France were allowed to starve while the great orators
up in Paris held banquets and feasts in the name of Liberty?</p>

<p>Justice? God alone held its scales, and no man knew how He would
administer it in the life that was to come.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16</h2>

<p>It was while the excitement of Andr&eacute; Vallon's homecoming was at
its height, and the imagination of the countryside stirred by his
account of the heroism and endurance of the national army, that
Hector Talon took the opportunity of recruiting half a dozen
ruffians to fulfill that act of madness ordered by Monseigneur by
way of reprisals for the burning of his granaries and his mill.</p>

<p>With ferocious spite he had already selected the cottage of
Marianne Vallon for the dastardly deed and chosen the day when
Andr&eacute; himself was absent from Val-le-Roi, having gone to Nevers on
business of his own. He also selected another cottage close by,
which was the property of the widow Louvet, who had four children
and a small competence left to her by her husband, at one time a
prosperous farmer who, some time before his death, had fallen on
lean days and been forced, like so many others, to sell most of his
land. Those two cottages, then, isolated from the rest of the
village, had been marked by Talon for destruction. The six
ruffians, whom he had recruited in absolute secrecy and for a small
sum from one of the distant villages, arrived in the early morning
armed with sabres and bayonets, clad in cloth coat and breeches,
and wearing red caps on their heads. They proceeded first to one
cottage and then to the other, and summoned the women to clear out
of them at once. As they refused to move, the ruffians seized them
and the Louvet children and forcibly ejected them from their homes,
after which act of brutality, they set fire to the cottages. When
these were well ablaze they incontinently took to their hells, and
no one had set eyes on them since.</p>

<p>The news of the outrage spread like wildfire, and soon the
entire population of three villages flocked to the scene of the
disaster.</p>

<p>Strange how rumour does travel in these lonely districts! The
firing of shops or stores, of granaries or timber sheds, were of
frequent occurrence these days, and usually the crowds that
gathered round the conflagrations were made up, in addition to the
ruffianly incendiaries, of a few young rapscallions intent on
mischief and some poor half-starved vagabonds&mdash;men and
women&mdash;who hoped to pick up something out of the wreckage.
There were also those who came to shout, "<i>Vive la libert&eacute;!</i>" at the
instigation of the professional tub thumpers, who took the
opportunity of egging the crowd to worse mischief still.</p>

<p>But in this case it was different. People came from Le Borne and
Vanzy, from Auberterre and Barbuise; for hours the road, the lanes,
the towpaths were dotted with dark figures hurrying to the scene.
Men in ragged shirts and shoeless; women in tattered kirtles;
children, half naked, clinging to their mother's hand; but there
were also the farmers from Aubeterre or Vanzy, who came driving in
their carts, and there was the lawyer from Le Creusot in his
carriole, and the leech from Barbuise, who was on his rounds.</p>

<p>For an hour or more the cottages were ablaze. They were
stone-built, with heavy wooden rafters and age-old beams, which
were a ready prey for the flames. There was very little wind, and
the sky was leaden. Great storm clouds, tinged now with crimson,
came rolling in from the west. Huge columns of smoke rose, writhing
and twisting, to the sky mingled with showers of spluttering,
hissing sparks.</p>

<p>The men worked wonders, some of them risking their lives in a
heroic endeavour to save the women's goods. There had been a
prolonged drought since June and very little water in the wells,
but many men defied the flames while they dragged poor bits of
furniture, bedding, or clothing out of the blazing buildings. The
women stood round, staring wide eyed at this disaster which they
could not comprehend. It was so ununderstandable, meaningless,
wanton. The destruction of bourgeois or aristo property, yes! they
understood that well enough, because those that were well-to-do
were the enemies of the starving people of France&mdash;at least,
so the great orators up in Paris were never tired of dinning into
the ears of all and sundry. But cottages! the dwellings of the
poor, the home of a widow and of a mother of children! That was
beyond human comprehension.</p>

<p>The widow Louvet, with her children gathered about her knees,
was squatting by the side of the road up against the hedge with a
crowd of sympathizers all round her. She mostly had her apron over
her face, feeling, she said, quite unable to bear the sight of that
awful conflagration. She seemed quite incapable of lending a
helping hand, even in the simple effort of dragging her goods out
of the way of the crowd. When her apron was not over her face she
just stared in front of her, or else at her children, and through
quivering lips murmured agonizing, "<i>Mon Dieu!</i>"'s and "<i>Sainte
Vierge!</i>"'s. "What will become of us now?"</p>

<p>But Marianne Vallon neither cried nor prayed. In her own quiet,
stolid way she did her share in endeavouring to rescue her goods.
She worked like a man: and when all her little bits of furniture
were in safety, she went over the Louvets' cottage and helped in
the work of salvage there.</p>

<p>"<i>Voyons, Citoyenne Vallon</i>," one of the men said to her when she
attempted to go too near the blazing building. "Keep your distance.
The place is dangerous."</p>

<p>She said nothing, only shook the men off who tried to restrain
her. There were the children's paillasses to get out of the way,
and their few bits of clothing. The men had gotten these out of the
cottage, but they were too near the fire still, and flying sparks
might set them alight.</p>

<p>"Take care, Citizeness Vallon!" the women shouted to her. "Let
the men do what they can."</p>

<p>Marianne was stooping at the moment. She had hold of a bundle of
bedding with both hands and was dragging it out of the way. Her
bulky shoulders were bent to the task: the scanty gray hairs clung
to her streaming face. The bedding was heavy and awkward to handle,
but so precious; so very precious, with all those poor sickly
children wanting to sleep comfortably o' nights.</p>

<p>"Take care, Citizeness Vallon!" the women screamed. "It isn't
safe!"</p>

<p>"Let the things be!"</p>

<p>"Take care!"</p>

<p>And the men all at once gave a terrific shout, "Out of the
way!"</p>

<p>One of them tried to get a hold of Marianne to drag her to
safety, but she was large and heavy and bulky, and she was bending
to her task, not seeing what was going on and heedless of the
shouts of warning.</p>

<p>And suddenly a sheet of fire came bursting from the cottage: it
was followed by a thunderous crash as the roof fell in, scattering
bits of wood, stones, and tiles in all directions.</p>

<p>A cry of horror rose from every throat, drowning the roar of the
flames, the hissing of sparks, the din of falling timber and
crumbling stones. Beneath a huge smouldering beam Marianne Vallon
lay, huddled up and lifeless, still clasping the bundle of bedding
in her arms.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>Now only the blackened stone walls were left standing, with the
empty holes where the tiny windows had been staring out on the
scene of devastation like hollow, sightless eyes. An evil-smelling
sooty smoke still found its way out of the smouldering ruins, and
now and then a volley of sparks rose up hissing to the stormy sky.
A suffocating smell of hot paint and burning refuse hung in the
air, and the lamentations of women, the whimpering of children, and
the dull murmur of men's voices seemed like eerie sounds that came
from the Stygian creek.</p>

<p>No one knew exactly what to door what to say. The catastrophe
was so appalling that, beyond sullen murmurs, those who had
witnessed it appeared tongue-tied. Paralyzed they were with the
horror of it. The death of Marianne Vallon was the culminating
point in the overwhelming disaster. And Andr&eacute; himself was away. He
had gone to Nevers the day before to see about a lawyer's business
which he wanted to take over now that he was no longer fit to
rejoin the army. He had been full of hopes of a brighter future for
the mother whom he adored. No longer would she have to wash and
scrub for him. There was so much litigation these days that any
lawyer with brains was certain of a good income. And Andr&eacute; Vallon
was well seen in his high places: he had been clerk at one time to
no less a personage than Georges Danton, the idol of the people,
who thought the world of him. Oh! there was no doubt about it, the
world held compensations for a man like Andr&eacute; Vallon. He had lost
an arm but not an iota of his brains, and though the terrible
hardships which he had endured in the campaign against the
Prussians had to a certain extent impaired his health and
embittered his temper, he had still two priceless
possessions&mdash;youth and an iron constitution.</p>

<p>He was going to be so happy! And now this awful, this
overwhelming cataclysm. Who was going to tell him? Who would be
bold enough to face that son with news of his mother's death under
such tragic circumstances? The women discussed it but could offer
no advice. All they could do was to stretch their arms up to heaven
and ejaculate, "<i>J&eacute;sus! Mon Dieu!</i>" even though they knew well enough
that appeals to the deity were nor forbidden by law. The men were
torn between the desire to run away, now that they could do nothing
to help in an active way, and the longing to fasten the guilt of
the whole thing on somebody. For somebody had done this awful deed.
The ruffians who had ejected the women and children from their
homes had taken to their heels. True enough! But the countryside
could be scoured for them, and, by dint of menace and other more
forcible arguments, they might be made to confess in whose pay they
were. Strangely enough, no one suspected as yet that the monstrous
order had emanated from the ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, those among the crowd who had business of
their own to attend to were gradually trying to get away. Perhaps
at the back of their minds there arose the fear that some sort of
mischief would surely come out of this. Vallon would turn up
presently, and the devil alone knew to what lengths his fury would
go. He already held the people around in the hollow of his hand and
could lead them whithersoever he chose. With his mother lying dead
at his feet through an outrage as yet inexplicable, something of
the rage of a tiger unleashed might carry him and his sympathizers
to excesses which presently might know no bounds. When the temper
of the rabble was worked up no one knew how things would end, and
it was best to be home and keep gates and doors well barred and
bolted. And so the farmers in their carts, the leech in his
carriole, the keepers of neighbouring village stores, drifted away
one by one.</p>

<p>"If you meet Vallon, tell him!" was shouted after those who were
going in the direction of Nevers.</p>

<p>And Farmer Lameth, from over Le Borne way, going homeward in his
cart, did presently meet Andr&eacute; Vallon, who had borrowed a carriole
in Nevers and was leisurely driving home. Farmer Lameth pulled
up.</p>

<p>"Terrible doings up at Val-le-Roi," he called out to Andr&eacute;. "You
should be there, Citizen Vallon."</p>

<p>"Why? What has happened?"</p>

<p>"Two cottages have been fired, and families turned out of their
homes."</p>

<p>"Name of a dog...!"</p>

<p>Farmer Lameth hesitated a moment or two. Already he did not much
like the look in Andr&eacute;'s face. What would it be
presently&mdash;when he knew?</p>

<p>"One of them is your mother," the worthy farmer added
tentatively.</p>

<p>"My mo&mdash;!"</p>

<p>This time it was the devil himself who kindled the flame in
Andr&eacute;'s eyes. He whipped up the nag, and the carriole started off
with a bump upon the stony road. Farmer Lameth turned in his seat
and called out once more:</p>

<p>"Citizen Vallon!"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; did not slacken speed, but he too turned in his seat and
shouted back:</p>

<p>"Yes! What is it?"</p>

<p>"There's more trouble there than you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Andr&eacute; did not really listen. He whipped that poor old nag as
he had never whipped a horse before. Never had the road seemed so
long. Trouble indeed! He would see to it that there was trouble and
to spare for whoever had lain hands on his mother's property and
turned her out of her home. Trouble? There would be trouble in
Val-le-Roi such as there had never been even in Paris, even in
Versailles! Trouble? My God!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter 18</h2>

<p>"Here comes Citizen Vallon."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I tell you 'yes.'"</p>

<p>"And he's driving like the devil!"</p>

<p>Instinctively the crowd had closed up right across the road,
barring the way to the smouldering cottage and standing in a dense
mass round the recumbent figure over which someone had reverently
laid an old tattered shawl. The men had succeeded in moving away
the beam and the bundle of bedding, and Marianne Vallon now lay on
one of the paillasses which she had rescued from the flames: her
hands had been folded across her ample bosom, and the thin gray
hair smoothed away from the marble-like, wide forehead.</p>

<p>There was no other feeling in the heart of anyone there at this
moment but intense pity for the bereaved son and an awed wonder as
to what would happen next. Even such men as Tarbot, the ex-butcher
of Vanzy, and Mol&eacute;, the wheelwright, two of the most desperate
ruffians the Revolution had engendered in any village, were silent
and uncertain, and determined to delay as long as possible the
terrible revelation that would bring such overwhelming grief to a
devoted son. So they all stood like a solid phalanx, shoulder to
shoulder, around that still and inert mass, while a carriole came
rattling down the road, and a miserable nag, all skin and bones,
thick with dust and lather, charged straight into them. It is very
difficult to stand up to a charging horse and vehicle, even though
the horse is but skin and bones: the crowd gave way, and Andr&eacute;
jumped down from the carriole. The men tried to restrain him, but
with his one arm he shook them off and forged his way to where his
mother law, with eyes closed, her hands folded across her bosom,
her body covered with a shawl.</p>

<p>He was in the midst of a crowd, and he would not let them see
what he felt. Not a word came through his lips, and the cry that
had risen to his throat was smothered and deadened with a mighty
effort of will. He knelt down beside his mother and, with his hand
on her ice-cold forehead, he looked down on her face and listened.
No need for the others to tell him. Death was all too plainly writ
on those beloved features, so stark and set, and the slightly
parted lips through which so many words of quiet philosophy had
often passed in order to comfort and to calm him. The eyes were
closed, and Andr&eacute; bent down and kissed each rigid lid; the hands
were folded as they had so often been in prayer when she had knelt
beside his bed. Her heart was still&mdash;that great, big heart of
hers in which there had never been room for hatred and
bitterness.</p>

<p>Oh, no! There was no need for others to tell him. He knew the
moment that the crowd parted and he saw her lying there with the
tattered shawl over her that she was dead. A slight noise among the
crowd, a sigh, no doubt, or a smothered sob, recalled him to the
fact that there were others there. Very gently he drew the old
shawl right over his mother's face, and then he rose to his feet.
There was not a drop of blood in his cheeks: his face looked as
pale as that of the dead woman at his feet, but in his eyes now
there were smouldering flames of fury that would not be quenched
save in revenge.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he asked curtly.</p>

<p>A dozen voices were raised at once. Floods of eloquence so long
held in check poured into his ears in full.</p>

<p>"The two cottages were fired."</p>

<p>"Six ruffians laid hands on the women."</p>

<p>"The widow Louvet and her four children are homeless."</p>

<p>"Your mother was killed in an endeavour to save some of the
children's belongings."</p>

<p>"The roof fell in. A heavy beam knocked her down."</p>

<p>"She must have died instantly."</p>

<p>"Hold on!" Andr&eacute; shouted, drowning the tumult with his
stentorian voice. "Who fired the cottages?"</p>

<p>"Six ruffians there were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In cloth coats and breeches&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And with shoes on their feet."</p>

<p>"Who saw them?"</p>

<p>The widow Louvet&mdash;she with the four children&mdash;had
given up crying and moaning and staring into vacancy. The far
greater tragedy of Marianne Vallon's death had put her own
misfortune in the shade. Thus directly appealed to, she was ready
to come forward with her tale. She had seen the six ruffians, of
course: had they not turned her out, her and the children, out of
her home, and at the point of their bayonets? She couldn't resist.
What could she do? They had turned her out, and she was afraid the
children would be hurt. Then the ruffians had set fire to her
cottage. They had piled up straw in the middle of the kitchen floor
and set it alight. Some of them stood by to see that the straw had
caught on properly; the others went on to the house of Citizeness
Vallon.</p>

<p>"Was no one about, then, to stop them?"</p>

<p>Apparently not. They all shook their heads. It had all been done
so quickly.</p>

<p>"After that the reprobates took to their heels."</p>

<p>"And no one after them?"</p>

<p>Again they all shook their heads.</p>

<p>"Your mother tried to save the children's bedding&mdash;" the widow
Louvet began dolefully, and suddenly paused, for the look in
Andr&eacute;'s face was so terrifying that it froze the words on her
lips.</p>

<p>"And I am not here," he murmured, "to tear their entrails out of
their filthy bodies..." And suddenly he threw back his head and his
glowing eyes searched the faces in the crowd.</p>

<p>"Can any of you guess," he asked quite quietly, "who is at the
bottom of this?"</p>

<p>Not only had they guessed, but they knew. Had not Hector
Talon&mdash;that double-faced hypocrite&mdash;had he not thrown out
hints that more than a week ago that Marigny, up at the ch&acirc;teau,
had threatened&mdash;nay, commanded&mdash;reprisals for the firing
of his granaries? Some of them murmured the name of Talon, but
Andr&eacute; gave a harsh, scornful laugh.</p>

<p>"Talon?" he said. "Yes! We'll deal with Talon presently, for of
a certainty he is in this villainy up to the neck. But," he went on
more slowly, so that every word told and struck the ears of the
crowd like the knell of an inevitable doom, "it is that devil up
there who must account for to-day's infamy."</p>

<p>He paused a moment and then added:</p>

<p>"I am going up there, anyway, in order to make sure. Who comes
with me?"</p>

<p>The response was unanimous. Indeed, it seemed as if a great sigh
of relief went through the assembled crowd. Not only the men, but
also the women. The sense of awe engendered by the magnitude of the
catastrophe and the death of Marianne Vallon was beginning to wear
away. There were men here who had begun to think of reprisals and
who read in Andr&eacute;'s white, set face, in the almost tigerish fury in
his glowing eyes, that passionate desire for revenge for which they
themselves had so often thirsted. Men like Tarbot, the ex-butcher,
and Mol&eacute;, the wheelwright, had also brooded over the wrongs of
their caste until they hungered for an opportunity to bring aristos
to shame, or, better still, to the guillotine. They had seen around
them such scenes of misery, humiliation, starvation, and tyranny
that their hatred of tyrants and oppressors had turned to savage
lust for the sight of blood.</p>

<p>There was no question here of philosophy or moderation.</p>

<p>How are you going to preach forgiveness and moderation to a
starving crowd? There is no tongue sufficiently eloquent to find
words that will pour the soothing oil of forbearance on a raging
sea of rebellion. One Voice alone could do that, and did it nigh
two thousand years ago, but to-day that Voice is still: It only
speaks mutely from the Cross.</p>

<p>"Citizen Vallon," one of the men said decisively, "we will help
you in your revenge."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; nodded in silence. He could not trust himself to say much.
Not yet. There was always the fear of breaking down, of showing
weakness which he was far from feeling. He hardly dared look on
that so still form beneath the ragged shawl: the folded hands
showed all too plainly, and the swell of the ample bosom against
which he had so often as a child cried himself to sleep. No,
indeed, he dared not look, for sobs threatened to choke him, and he
might cry out his agony of grief. But he still had a task to
accomplish, a duty to fulfill.</p>

<p>"A few sticks to make a stretcher," he said curtly.</p>

<p>"Where'll you take her, Andr&eacute;?" one of the women asked.</p>

<p>"Back home."</p>

<p>"It is burnt to the ground."</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>They asked no further questions, for already Andr&eacute; was busy
breaking down branches of trees. The men helped: some of them had
tools, others went to fetch what they could. A stretcher was soon
improvised, and they lifted the dead woman on it. Andr&eacute; and Tarbot,
the ex-butcher, carried her to her ruined cottage, most of the
others following.</p>

<p>Tarbot, looking down on the dead woman, asked:</p>

<p>"Where shall we put her?"</p>

<p>"In there," Andr&eacute; replied.</p>

<p>They put the stretcher down, and Andr&eacute; went deliberately up to
the cottage door and started clearing away the charred d&eacute;bris which
encumbered it. The other men lent a hand, and when the entrance had
been cleared Andr&eacute; and Tarbot went back to get the stretcher. They
had just stooped to lift it when the Abb&eacute; Rosemonde was seen
hurrying down the road. He had heard the news and came panting
along as fast as his shaking limbs would carry him. He had tucked
his soutane up round his waist: he was hatless, and his gray hair
clung to his streaming forehead.</p>

<p>"I don't want to see him," Andr&eacute; said abruptly. "Keep him
away."</p>

<p>But the Cur&eacute; forged his way resolutely through the crowd.</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;, my child," he cried panting, "I only just heard the
news. I came as fast as I could."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; paid no attention to him. In silence, with the aid of
Tarbot, he carried his burden into the ruined cottage.</p>

<p>"We'll lay her down here," he said, "until such time as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;!" the old priest called.</p>

<p>"Go home, Citizen Cur&eacute;," Tarbot said roughly. "Can't you see
that you are not wanted here?"</p>

<p>He and Andr&eacute; had taken the dead woman to the centre of what had
once been her parlour. The floor was littered with rubbish. They
cleared a place on which to deposit the stretcher. Above, through a
wide, yawning gap in the roof, there was a vista of a leaden sky of
gray clouds which hung, low and heavy, presaging the coming
storm.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; collected what there was left of charred wood and spread
it around the stretcher.</p>

<p>"Straw would be better," he muttered.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Citizen Vallon?" Tarbot asked.</p>

<p>The others had come to a halt all about the doorway. Behind them
the old priest was still striving to elbow his way through the
crowd. Andr&eacute; drew his flint and steel out of his pocket and used
them vigorously, trying to draw a spark. The men understood.</p>

<p>"Straw would be better," one of them said. Another added: "I
know where to get some," and turned toward the road. This made a
gap through the crowd, and the old priest pushed his way in.</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;!" he cried once more. "Your mother...!"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; paid no attention to him. He was busy with his flint and
steel, trying to get little bits of wood alight. But the fire had
done its work, the charred wood fell into ashes and would not
burn.</p>

<p>"Young Legendre has gone to get straw," said one of the men.</p>

<p>"This is sacrilege," the old priest protested loudly. "Andr&eacute;, in
your dead mother's name..."</p>

<p>At this Andr&eacute; looked up. "My mother is dead," he said roughly;
"she doesn't want you."</p>

<p>"You may not want me, my child," the old priest retorted firmly,
"but she would."</p>

<p>Then, as Andr&eacute; said nothing more, only went on stolidly striking
flint against steel, the Cur&eacute; said forcefully:</p>

<p>"Remember, my son, that from above she can still see you; how
think you she would view this awful sacrilege? <i>Voyons! voyons,
Andr&eacute;</i>," he went on more gently, "do not harden your heart in
rebellion against the will of God. Let me come near the dear old
soul, and we'll pray together that she may have eternal rest. She
would have wished it, you know."</p>

<p>And though resentment and bitterness were tearing at Andr&eacute;'s
heart, he knew that the priest was right. Old Marianne, could she
have said the word, would have rebelled against this desecration of
her body: she would have wished for Christian burial, to the
accompaniment of prayer and the ministrations of the Church. To the
end of her hard life she had remained a professing Christian,
clinging to the simple beliefs of her youth, weeping over the
godlessness of this new regime, over the spirit of rebellion which
it had fostered in her Andr&eacute;'s heart, abhorring the tyranny of man
which had brought so much misery on the poor people, yet bowing
with quiet philosophy to the inscrutable will of God.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; knew all that. "She would have wished it, you know." The
priest's words found an echo in his aching heart. For a few seconds
still did he hesitate, did his pride war with his love for the
dead. The others watched him in silence while the women wept. Here
was something that was past their comprehension, something that
awed and silenced them and for the time being made them forget
their passions and their hatred. Then Andr&eacute;, without another word,
put his flint back into his pocket and rose to his feet. He stood
aside, and when the priest knelt down beside the dead and began
murmuring his prayers, he watched him silently for awhile and then
walked quietly out of the cottage.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter 19</h2>

<p>But under the stormy canopy of the sky the spell was broken.</p>

<p>"We'll help you, citizen Vallon. Let's to the ch&acirc;teau!" was the
universal slogan.</p>

<p>"But first of all for Talon!"</p>

<p>The cry came from Andr&eacute;. It was harsh and cruel like that of a
young tiger scenting its prey. They others did not quite
understand.</p>

<p>"Talon? Why Talon?"</p>

<p>"Because," Andr&eacute; said, "such an abominable deed could never have
been carried out without the aid of Hector Talon."</p>

<p>Why indeed Talon? Because he was the man whom Andr&eacute; hated only
one degree less than the people up at the ch&acirc;teau. Why Talon?
Because Andr&eacute; had a longing to see him dragged here by the heels
through the dust and to see his yellow eyes turn glassy with the
agony of deathly terror. Talon the hypocrite! The mealy-mouthed
sycophant!</p>

<p>"Who will go and fetch Talon?"</p>

<p>There were any number of them there willing enough to start the
day's work by baiting Talon. They went off in a body to fetch him.
They dragged him out of his house. Pushed along, heckled and
jostled, they brought him to the scene of the disaster, face to
face with Andr&eacute; Vallon.</p>

<p>They had dragged him along, and he had come, and on the way he
had mapped out his line of action. Not without due deliberation had
he planned the monstrous outrage, nor without due regard to the
consequences, unpleasant to himself, that might ensue. He had
foreseen the rage of these people, their lust for revenge; he had
reckoned on their passions as a lever for finally persuading
Marigny to emigrate. He had even been prepared for a certain
measure of danger to himself&mdash;danger which he would know how
to combat. But what he had not reckoned on was the death of
Marianne Vallon.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he faced the crowd boldly. Whatever terror he felt
he did not let them see; nor did he flinch when Andr&eacute;, towering
above him, laid such a heavy hand on his shoulder that his knees
gave way under him.</p>

<p>"So there you are, Citizen Talon," Andr&eacute; apostrophized him
coolly. "I suppose you know who I am?"</p>

<p>Talon looked up at the young face, dark and distorted with fury,
and blinked his yellow eyes.</p>

<p>"How should I not know you, Citizen Vallon?" he said smoothly.
"I have known you ever since&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ever since you had me whipped for killing your brute of a dog,
eh?"</p>

<p>"That is past history, Citizen Vallon," Talon said jocosely;
"you are a man now."</p>

<p>"While you have remained a worm," Andr&eacute; retorted: "such a worm
that I have a mind to tread on your face, just for the pleasure of
seeing you wriggle."</p>

<p>The men laughed, but Talon did not flinch. He even contrived to
shrug and to smile. He was clever enough to know that a bold face
and an arrogant air would be his best safeguard against aggression.
Some of these men here&mdash;the rougher ones&mdash;were his
friends. They knew him to be a man of influence. They had listened
to his oratory outside the village taverns and had heard men in
high places speak of Citizen Talon as a good patriot. And Talon
knew that they would not dare touch him, even though Andr&eacute; Vallon,
the savage young brute, did his level best to incite them to
murder. He kept up his jaunty air, and, only pulling a wry face, he
said indulgently:</p>

<p>"You were always good at jesting, Citizen Vallon."</p>

<p>"I am not jesting now," Andr&eacute; rejoined. "I want to know who gave
the order for this abominable outrage."</p>

<p>"You mean the firing of the cottages?"</p>

<p>"Who ordered it? Tell us! Speak, why don't you? Speak, or I'll
tear the words out of your filthy throat."</p>

<p>Talon put up his hands and gazed at Andr&eacute; with an air of
innocence.</p>

<p>"Easy! easy! my friend," he said, "how should I know?"</p>

<p>"You are Marigny's menial&mdash;you must know..."</p>

<p>"Then if you've made up your mind..."</p>

<p>"It was Marigny who gave the order?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Talon protested. "I swear I don't know."</p>

<p>"You lie!"</p>

<p>Talon shrugged his lean shoulders.</p>

<p>"You lie, I say," Andr&eacute; reiterated roughly. "Speak the truth,
man," he went on more calmly, "it will be better for you. The
aristo gave the order, is that it?"</p>

<p>But Talon would admit nothing. He knew nothing, he declared:
vowed that he could not believe Marigny capable of such a thing. As
for himself, he knew nothing. Nothing. He had been more shocked,
more distressed than anyone when he first heard of the
disaster.</p>

<p>"Lies! lies!" Andr&eacute; retorted roughly. "Shall we to the ch&acirc;teau,
citizens, and find out the truth for ourselves?"</p>

<p>A murmur of assent went the round. The truth? Why! they all knew
the truth. Andr&eacute; had known it all along, from the moment when he
saw his mother lying dead and that awful red mist rose before his
eyes. Marigny! It was Marigny who had done this loathsome deed.
Murder, deliberate and most foul, lay at the door of that arrogant
man up there, who, like his kindred and his king, had not yet
learned that the people would no longer bow the neck to the yoke of
their pride and their tyranny. Well, he, at any rate, would be
taught a lesson that day: he would be made to mourn with tears of
blood the deadly wrong which he had committed. He and his brood!
Let them look to themselves! Men and women had gone to the
guillotine for less, had watered their marble floors with bitter
tears for crimes which were as venial sins compared to this
morning's outrage.</p>

<p>Already the crowd had begun to move in the direction of the
ch&acirc;teau; they had all been impatient enough to go. What cared they
if the aristo "up there" were guilty or not? They wanted to march,
to shout, to threaten, as others had done in Paris and Versailles.
In the far distance from over the mountains came, from time to
time, the dull rumbling sound of thunder; occasional flashes of
lightning lit up the heavy storm clouds with a weird purple light.
The air grew hotter and more oppressive every moment, but they all
wanted to be up and doing&mdash;the storm was finding an echo in
their hearts.</p>

<p>"To the ch&acirc;teau, Andr&eacute;!" they said. "We'll help you in your
revenge."</p>

<p>Talon made feeble efforts at protest.</p>

<p>"And you come with us, Citizen Talon," Andr&eacute; concluded
grimly.</p>

<p>Tarbot and Mol&eacute; took Talon by the elbows. There was a general
movement along the road. Men, women, children: they all joined in
the procession. The men, earnest and determined; the women,
bitterly vindictive; the children, innocently curious. There were
fourscore of them at least, fourscore bent on demanding reprisals
for an unparalleled wrong.</p>

<p>And Andr&eacute;, silent and absorbed, with eyes aglow and mouth set,
saw, through a veil of red, a woman's face with large, innocent
eyes and soft fair hair&mdash;a woman, just a girl, in a
rose-coloured silk which made her seem like a flower bud. He hadn't
seen her for many years. She must be a woman now.</p>

<p>Bah! what had he to do with women, and visions of women seen
through a mist the colour of blood? The one woman in the world he
had ever cared for lay stiff and stark now, silent in her ruined
home. And all that misery, all this injustice and unbounded sorrow
lay at the door of those people "up there"!</p>

<p>Heavens above! how he hated them all.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter 20</h2>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Rosemonde, having finished his orisons, bethought
himself of Marigny and little Aurore up at the ch&acirc;teau, ignorant,
mayhap, as yet of the storm that was about to break with raging
fury over their heads. At one moment he had thought of speaking to
those poor misguided children who were being led away by disaster
into acts of violence, the terrible consequences of which God alone
could foresee. He had thought of admonishing Andr&eacute; vallon, who
bitter resentment was causing him to whip up the tempers of his
sympathizers.</p>

<p>The worthy Cur&eacute; shook his head dolefully: that poor lad! led
astray on the very threshold of manhood by his obstinacy and
willfulness: full of generous impulses, and such a good son! He
would have made a kind and faithful husband if only the times had
been different. And now that this awful grief had descended upon
him his obstinacy would harden his heart still more against the
comfort which religion along could give. A pity! a sad, sad, pity
that this catastrophe had happened. It was the will of God, of
course, and he, poor, humble priest, bowed meekly before it, but,
oh! how he wished that it had not happened. He couldn't imagine who
had conceived such an inhuman project, for never for a moment would
he contemplate the idea that Monseigneur would act so cruelly.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu! mon Dieu! Sainte Vierge Marie!</i>" he murmured
fervently, "turn the hearts of those poor, ignorant people of
France to a better knowledge of religion and virtue."</p>

<p>Thus the old man prayed while he tramped up the familiar
woodland path toward the ch&acirc;teau. He had been able to reach the
slope without being seen by the crowd, who were still standing
outside the ruined cottage, talking and murmuring. At one moment
the Abb&eacute; thought that he heard the voice of Hector Talon. Well, of
course, as a priest and a Christian he wished no harm to come to
anyone, but if it pleased God to punish Talon, Talon who had the
ear of Monseigneur and was such an evil consellor, he, as a man,
would not complain.</p>

<p>Now, as he tramped upward, the good Cur&eacute; could hear echoing from
the valley below the distant clamour of the angry crowd: Andr&eacute;'s
sonorous voice and the hoarse shouts that rang with the promise of
mischief.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was terribly oppressive; there seemed to be no
air here under the trees; not a leaf stirred, and an evil smell
seemed to rise from the dust in the road. The Abb&eacute; hurried on. He
knew that he could do nothing "up there," but he could warn
Monseigneur of what was brewing against him. It might be wise to
seek safety in flight while there was time.</p>

<p>There was the width of the terrace and the gardens, with the
distant postern gate which gave on a lonely part of the wood, where
it might be possible to await quietly a better turn of events.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Abb&eacute; had to hurry. Looking down from a point of
vantage, into the road below, he could see that the crowd had begun
to move. To the priest it seemed as if their number had swelled.
But his eyes were short-sighted, and many months ago he had broken
his spectacles; he had never had any money since with which to buy
new ones, so he couldn't see very well. He hoped that the crowd was
not great and that Talon was with them. Surely Talon would act as a
restraining power over the others.</p>

<p><i>Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!</i> how foolish it all was! If only Mademoiselle
Aurore and Jeannette were out of the way, for arguments with noisy
crowds were not fit for women's ears.</p>

<p>Fortunately he was well ahead of the misguided lambs. He almost
ran up the <i>perron</i>, pushed open the great gate, and hurried across
hall and corridor and up the marble staircase to the distant small
withdrawing room, where Monseigneur usually spent the best part of
the day.</p>

<p>Aurore was there with her father. She was busy sewing, and
Monseigneur was reading a paper which seemed highly to incense him,
for just as the Cur&eacute; entered the room he crushed it in his hand and
threw it on the floor with an oath. The priest sank, puffing and
panting, into a chair:</p>

<p>"Those poor people! those poor miserable fools!" he began, and
mopped his streaming forehead.</p>

<p>Monseigneur looked at him and laughed.</p>

<p>"You need not tell me," he said curtly. "I know."</p>

<p>Aurore looked up from her sewing; she looked first at her
father, then at the Abb&eacute;; then she put down her work. Something
terrible had happened. The strange glitter in her father's eyes,
the anxiety and distress in the Cur&eacute;'s face, but, above all, her
intuition and a sense of foreboding told her that something
terrible had happened.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Those poor people," the priest murmured, "they are so
foolish&mdash;so ignorant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ruffians and devils!" Monseigneur declared, and struck the
table with his fist, "they have learned at last that I, for one, am
not to be defied."</p>

<p>Aurore took hold of his hand; the one with which he had struck
the table.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" she demanded again.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Only a few seconds. But during
those seconds she heard. The window was open, and she heard the
clamour&mdash;the sound of feet tramping up the slope and of a dull
murmur that mingled with the rumbling of the distant thunder. She
knew what it meant. Without doubt an in a moment, she knew what it
meant. Newspapers, pamphlets, rumours had found their way to this
lonely corner of France. Aurore de Marigny knew that all over the
country demagogues&mdash;men like that Andr&eacute; Vallon&mdash;spent
their time in inciting all the ruffians they could get hold of to
do acts of violence against persons of property. She knew that. And
she knew what the outcome of such provocations had often been.
Outrage. Death. Sometimes worse than death.</p>

<p>She questioned her father. She had the right to know. They would
all hold their lives in their hands in a few minutes when the crowd
reached the ch&acirc;teau. She had the right to know, she declared.
Something had roused the village folk to frenzy: what was it?</p>

<p>Monseigneur shrugged and said nothing. The glitter in his eyes
was like that of a madman. The old priest, overcome with emotion
and the heat, could do nothing but mop his forehead. And the
clamour from the valley grew louder and louder, the dull murmur of
voices and the tramp of naked feet in the dust of the road.</p>

<p>And suddenly Pierre came bursting into the room, with Jeannette
weeping and trailing behind him. They knew everything. Pierre had
heard it all&mdash;Heaven knew how&mdash;but he had heard so he ran
up&mdash;like the old Cur&eacute; had done&mdash;to warn Monseigneur and
Mademoiselle. He was breathless and inarticulate, but Monseigneur
did not interrupt him while he blurted out the whole terrible tale:
the six ruffians, the eviction of the women and children, the
firing of the cottages, the death of Marianne Vallon.</p>

<p>Charles de Marigny appeared indifferent to the whole thing and
entirely disdainful. He did not even wince when Pierre spoke of the
death of Marianne. The priest moaned and ejaculated: "<i>Mon Dieu!</i>"
and looked to Heaven for guidance, while Aurore listened wide-eyed,
horrified. At first she was incredulous and turned to her father
with an appealing and mute: "Is it true?" But his glance was
obstinately averted. He stared out of the
window&mdash;listening&mdash;listening for the coming of that
rabble which he despised so utterly, even though their approach now
probably meant death to him and to Aurore.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the crowd had invaded the courtyard. The
shuffling of naked feet, mingling with the clatter of sabots and
the tramping of shoes, sounded like the breaking of surf on a
pebble beach. The voices were subdued, like the distant murmur of
an angry sea. There were no shouts, only murmurs and occasionally
the whimpering of a child.</p>

<p>Monseigneur rose.</p>

<p>"The gate&mdash;" he said curtly to Pierre.</p>

<p>"Barred and bolted, monseigneur. Oh! monseigneur didn't think
that I would allow..."</p>

<p>Charles de Marigny did not listen. He had opened the drawer of
the table against which he now proceeded to examine carefully.
Aurore's large troubled eyes watched him as he drew his tall figure
to its full height and then turned to the door. With a sudden
little cry she ran and stood between him and that door. "You are
not going to meet them, Father!" she exclaimed impulsively, and put
out her arms to stop him, but he pushed her roughly aside.</p>

<p>"You don't imagine," he retorted coldly, "that I would allow
that rabble to come in here?"</p>

<p>"If you go," she protested, "I come with you."</p>

<p>He took hold of her wrist with such violence that she nearly
cried out with pain. Who was she, he demanded, to stand in his way?
How dare she pit her feeble woman's will against his determination
to deal with those ruffians as they deserved?</p>

<p>"I order you to stay here," he commanded; and not heeding the
servants' look of horror or the Cur&eacute; mild protest he dragged her
roughly from the door.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to defy me," he thundered, "like that riffraff
over there?"</p>

<p>And the look which he cast on her&mdash;on her, the child of his
heart, the apple of his eye&mdash;was so laden with fury that she
shrank from him as if he had struck her in the face.</p>

<p>Then he opened the door. It gave on one of the great reception
rooms, used as a ballroom in the olden days. A long vista of
parquet flooring, of mirrors and girandoles, of tapestries and
consoles, stretched out to the other great doors opposite. Aurore
turned a last appealing look to the Cur&eacute;.</p>

<p>"You must obey your father, my child," he said. "God will
protect him, and you can do nothing."</p>

<p>He struggled to his feet and beckoned to Pierre. Charles de
Marigny had already gone through the door, and now the Abb&eacute;
Rosemonde and Pierre went out in his wake.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter 21</h2>

<p>The great room was empty. Silent and majestic, with its gilded
mirrors and chandeliers and rows of chairs ranged round the walls
as if ready to receive the ghosts of the grand ladies and gentlemen
who had chatted here a few short weeks ago, had flirted and laughed
and fluttered their fans and danced the minuet in their high-heeled
shoes before they made their way up the steps of the guillotine or
sought safety in an obscure corner of some foreign land.</p>

<p>But Charles de Marigny had no mind for sentimental recollections
just now. He strode across the room to the great central window and
threw it open. Like the sudden bursting of a dam, the sound of the
surging crowd rose in a strident cadence. Monseigneur stepped out
on the balcony and looked down on them. How ugly they were! Dirty,
unkempt, clad for the most part in filthy rags! He loathed them!
Oh! how he loathed them! The men! The women! Those half-naked,
unwashed children! Were they human at all? In the olden days he
would have classed all that rabble as lower and of less consequence
than his cattle or his dogs.</p>

<p>He stood there for quite a few moments looking at them, his arms
resting on the marble balustrade, the pistol in his hand. They had
come to a standstill in the vast forecourt and were evidently
debating what to do next. Then a man's figure detached itself from
the rest. He wore an old military coat, one of the sleeves of which
was empty and fastened to a button on his chest. He wore shoes and
stockings, but his head was bare, and his hair was the colour of a
horse-chestnut when it bursts its green prickly shell.</p>

<p>There was something vaguely familiar in the face, those dark
eyes and chiselled features, which recreated in Monseigneur's
memory a vision out of the past&mdash;a boy half naked, with
straight young back and firm limbs standing at the whipping post,
while he and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne de Beauregard looked on rather amused. H&eacute;l&egrave;ne
had put up her lorgnette and compared him to a rebel angel. He
looked more like a demon now.</p>

<p>He strode across the forecourt and up the <i>perron</i>. Two others,
more swinish than the rest, followed him. Charles de Marigny
watched them. No one had caught sight of him yet, for the balcony
was thirty feet from the ground and twenty from the top of the
<i>perron</i>. The three men came to a halt in front of the great
wrought-iron and gilded gates.</p>

<p>Pierre whispered to Monseigneur:</p>

<p>"Good thought I had of locking them. They'd want a cannon to
break them open."</p>

<p>The men, seeing that the gates were locked, appeared to
hesitate, and suddenly the man with the empty sleeve looked up.</p>

<p>"Marigny!" he called out and pointed to the balcony. The crowd
at once gazed upward. The say Monseigneur. The shouted, "Assassin!
Open the gates!" The women waved their arms; the men shook menacing
fists. But Charles de Marigny remained motionless and detached,
with an expression of withering scorn on his pale, aristocratic
face.</p>

<p>"Open the gates, Marigny," Andr&eacute; Vallon commanded. "The people
here want a talk with you."</p>

<p>De Marigny's sole response was a peremptory:</p>

<p>"Get out of there! All of you, get out!"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Marigny!" Andr&eacute; retorted loudly. "The people
will not stand your arrogance. They have come to speak with you,
and speak with you they will, if they have to pull down these stone
walls about your ears."</p>

<p>"Get out!" Charles de Marigny called out in reply. "The gates
through which you came are open! Get out!"</p>

<p>"Open the gates!" they all shouted.</p>

<p>"Get out!"</p>

<p>The tumult was waxing fast and furious down below. Murmurs had
long since turned to raucous shouts, in which the words, "Traitor!
Tyrant! Death!" came clearer than the rest. But "Death!" clearest
of all. The Abb&eacute; Rosemonde tried in his feeble way to restrain
Monseigneur, but Charles de Marigny shook himself free with a loud
oath from the kindly hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Open the gates!" Andr&eacute;'s voice rose above that of the others,
and Tarbot and Mol&eacute;, like a pair of savage dogs on the leash, cried
out, "Open the gates or we'll burst them open!" Whereat a boy's
voice in the crowd rose shrilly:</p>

<p>"If we burst them open there'll be no talking: only death for
the traitor."</p>

<p>"Death! Traitor! Assassin!"</p>

<p>"The guillotine!"</p>

<p>Pierre's teeth were chattering with terror. He kept on
murmuring, as if to give himself courage: "They can't burst them
open! They can't! They'd want a cannon!"</p>

<p>Charles de Marigny drew himself up. Only his hand now, the one
which held the pistol, rested on the marble balustrade. He wanted
them to see him better, to see the contempt with which he regarded
them and their futile efforts to intimidate him. He turned half
away from the balcony as if that rabble down there was not even
worth a glance. He shrugged ostentatiously when the words,
"Assassin! the guillotine!" rose more and more insistently from
below.</p>

<p>"Let us go back, M. l'Abb&eacute;," he said calmly, "and see what
Aurore is doing. When these muckworms are tired of shouting they'll
clear out fast enough."</p>

<p>As far as he was concerned that was all! Rabble! riffraff! the
scum of humanity! That is what they were! And trying to frighten
him? Ludicrous, of course! Contemptible! What a fool to have
brought his pistol! As if those cravens would ever dare-</p>

<p>A simultaneous cry from the Abb&eacute; and Pierre caused him to swing
back suddenly.</p>

<p>The man with the empty sleeve had clambered up to the balcony.
With the aid of projections in the stonework and the age-old ivy
which, untended, had spread over the wall, he had pulled himself
up. Tarbot and Mol&eacute; were following him, but he, Andr&eacute;, had got
there first. One arm can be as good as two when fury whips up the
blood. With the aid of his one arm and a sinewy pair of legs he was
soon over the balustrade, even before the cry of alarm spent itself
in the old priest's throat.</p>

<p>Monseigneur swung round. The pistol was in his hand, even with
Andr&eacute;'s head.</p>

<p>"Another step and I shoot!" he called.</p>

<p>"Shoot and be damned!" Andr&eacute; retorted, and with a bound was on
the floor of the balcony. His arm shot out; his fingers, hard as
steel, closed round De Marigny's wrist and forced his arm up, up,
and back from the shoulder. The pistol went off with a loud report
and then dropped from the nerveless hand to the ground.</p>

<p>From the crowd below came an infuriated yell.</p>

<p>"<i>A moi, Pierre!</i>" Charles de Marigny shouted. And then, "Let go
my arm, <i>canaille!</i>"</p>

<p>Before Pierre could come to his master's rescue, Tarbot and Mol&eacute;
were over the balustrade, too, and onto him. They took no notice of
the Cur&eacute;, for he had fallen on his knees, poor old man! and was
imploring God to protect Monseigneur; but they held Pierre down
while Andr&eacute; forced De Marigny, step by step, back into the room.
Like a vise, that one hand of his was nearly wrenching the upturned
arm out of its socket.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu, ayez piti&eacute;!</i>" the priest murmured fervently, whilst
Monseigneur, though half swooning with pain, reiterated
obstinately, "<i>Canaille!</i> <i>Canaille!</i> Get out!"</p>

<p>The crowd, baulked of the sight of their enemy, had resumed
their cry of "Assassin!" A few of them, more vigorous than the
others, tried to follow their leader's example by climbing up the
ivy-covered wall. The other's shouted, "Open the gate!" whereupon
Mol&eacute;, the wheelwright, seized Pierre by the arm and said
curtly:</p>

<p>"You hear them, citizen? Come and open the gate."</p>

<p>"Pierre, I forbid you," Monseigneur attempted to command, but
Mol&eacute; had already marched Pierre out through the door, while Andr&eacute;,
step by step, pushed De Marigny back into the room.</p>

<p>When he had got him right over to the other end, with his back
to the door of the small boudoir, he released his arm. It fell,
nerveless and numb. Obviously the man was in great pain, but pride
kept him on his feet. Obstinate and arrogant he was; he could be
cruel, too, where his dignity was at stake; but he was no coward,
either morally or physically. He did not regret the firing of the
cottages, that act of madness which had brought this yelling horde
about his ears. He felt faint and giddy, but with a mighty effort
he kept himself upright. There was a chair close by, but he would
not allow himself to sing into it, and even while Andr&eacute; stood
towering above him like a statue of wrath and vengeance, his lips
continued to murmur mechanically, "<i>Canaille!</i> Get out!"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; gave a contemptuous shrug:</p>

<p>"Canaille we are," he said with a sneer, "that's understood, but
we are a canaille who to-day demand justice. You have committed an
outrage which calls to Heaven for vengeance, and we have come here
to show you that we mean to get it."</p>

<p>"Murder, I suppose?" De Marigny said coldly.</p>

<p>"Killing is no murder when justice demands it. A few hours ago
two defenceless women and a crowd of children were turned out of
their homes by your orders. My mother gave up her life to rescue
the few belongings of a poor widow and her children. As sure as
that I hold your worthless life in my hands, her death is at your
door. Killing is no murder, Marigny, when it means justice."</p>

<p>Still De Marigny did not flinch. He made no reply, and for a few
seconds they stood facing each other, these two men, each the
product of his own upbringing and of his century; each imbued with
the passion and cruelty of men when they defend what they hold most
dear. Charles de Marigny, unbending and imperious, seemed at this
moment to be entrenched within the last outpost of his caste, and
to be safeguarding his right of property and the privileges of his
birth. Immaculately dressed, his hair carefully powdered, his fine
linen scarcely disarranged even after a hand-to-hand struggle with
this renegade, his pale face betrayed no emotion, only a withering
contempt. And Andr&eacute; Vallon, the typical child of this bloody
revolution, the son of a people who for generations had suffered
and toiled like beasts of burden and looked with patient,
submissive eyes on the pomp and luxury that never could be theirs;
who had never eaten their fill while others feasted; who had
wallowed in poverty and ignorance with hardly the promise of Heaven
to save them from despair: Andr&eacute; with shabby coat and empty sleeve,
with glowing eyes and heart overflowing with resentment for past
tyranny and unavenged wrongs, Andr&eacute; stood for those stirrings which
men like Rousseau had first infused into their blood. And as De
Marigny worshipped privilege, so did these youngsters worship at
the shrine of the newly discovered goddess, Liberty. A new dawn had
arisen for them, and they fell on their faces and adored. They ate
the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. They learned and they pondered,
and from out the depths of their soul they evolved the
consciousness of the dignity of man.</p>

<p>"Canaille we are!" he had thrown back the challenge in De
Marigny's face: "low, unwashed, and ignorant, but men for all that.
For centuries your cast denied us the right to live as we desired,
to share in what goodness the world holds&mdash;the right to hold
our homes sacred, our wives and daughters inviolate. But now we are
your masters at last. We're butchered, we've despoiled, we've
killed, but the measure of justice is not yet full. Hundreds of you
have mounted the guillotine, and hundreds more shall do the same
until we get what we demand&mdash;justice!"</p>

<p>All that he said and more, while Charles de Marigny's face
expressed nothing but disgust at being in such close contact with
this filthy horde.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter 22</h2>

<p>And now the crowd came pouring into the ch&acirc;teau. Pierre had been
made to open the gate, and they all rushed up the marble staircase.
They invaded the hall and the vast reception rooms. Awed at first
by so much magnificence of which they had no conception, by the
gliding and the crystals and the damask chairs, and by the mirrors
which reflected their dark faces and their rags and made their
numbers seem so much greater than they were.</p>

<p>But the awe soon wore off. So much magnificence! And there were
the Louvet children homeless; and Marianne Vallon lay dead in her
ruined home.</p>

<p>"Well, Andr&eacute;!" one of the men asked. "What says the aristo?"</p>

<p>"Not much to say, I imagine," said another.</p>

<p>"I am for slitting his throat at once and have done with him."
This from Tarbot, the ex-butcher, who always kept a knife in his
belt.</p>

<p>"I prefer the guillotine," declared Mol&eacute; sententiously. "It's
more effective. An example to others, what?"</p>

<p>"Let's hear what he's got to say first, and then we'll see."</p>

<p>De Marigny's fine white hand felt in his pocket and drew out a
lace-bordered handkerchief, which he raised to his nose. With a
rough gesture Andr&eacute; tore it out of his hand.</p>

<p>"Play-acting, Marigny!" he said with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Let me slit his throat, Andr&eacute;!" Tarbot demanded.</p>

<p>"Murder, by all means," De Marigny retorted coolly.</p>

<p>"Murder? No," Andr&eacute; declared. "I too am for the guillotine. The
people want to see you die a dog's death. Murder? Bah! Will one
moment's anguish in your miserable life give us back our youth
spent in toiling so that you might feast; gives us back our health
impaired by starvation while you ate and drank your fill? The last
drain of your life's blood, Marigny, cannot make good your tyranny.
It cannot! It cannot! You cannot make good, for you have nothing
now&mdash;no power, no riches, none of the claptrap that made you
think you were a creature apart while we were just swine."</p>

<p>His words acted like a gust of wind on a smouldering flame. Some
were for immediate murder, others like the thought of the more
protracted agony of the guillotine, but all wanted this man's
death. They hungered for it. They ached for a sight of his blood.
There was not a man or a woman there who did not see that pale,
proud face through a veil of crimson. But they still help their
breath like wild beasts when they have sighted their prey and are
ready to spring. Like felines they were, licking their jaws,
enjoying to its full the sublime sense of power over the life and
death of a fellow man.</p>

<p>"Strike him, Andr&eacute;!" one of the men shouted. "I am for instant
death."</p>

<p>"Remember your mother, Andr&eacute;!" yelled another. "Why wait for the
guillotine."</p>

<p>And suddenly the door behind De Marigny flew open, and Aurore
rushed in, a vision pale and ethereal, with fair hair loose and
eyes as dark as the midnight sky in June. In an instant she was
beside her father, her arms were round him, her head was against
his breast. Her slendor body was a shield between him and his
enemies.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had uttered one loud, savage oath, and then remained dumb,
staring at the girl, while the crowd, taken aback for a few
seconds, soon began to laugh and jeer. A fresh spectacle this: this
fine lady with her laces and her frills. The wolves in expectation
of the slaughtered sheep rejoiced at sight of the lamb.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Aurore, go back!" Monseigneur exclaimed. At
first he had been half dazed, hardly believed his eyes when he saw
Aurore. He was like a man in a trance, not fully wakened from a
dream. "Monsieur l'Abb&eacute;, take her away!" he added, vainly trying to
perceive the Cur&eacute;'s face in the midst of the crowd. He himself did
what he could to drag Aurore's arms away from his shoulders, whilst
the old priest made a vain effort to reach her. But all this was of
no avail. It was Mol&eacute;, the wheelwright, who seized hold of Aurore
by the waist and dragged her away from her father. In a moment she
was surrounded. The women in the forefront pulled at her gown and
tore at the lace of her sleeve.</p>

<p>"How much did your gown cost, my cabbage?" one of them
jeered.</p>

<p>"As much as would keep a family in food for a year," declared
another.</p>

<p>"Strip it off," suggested one of the men with a coarse
laugh.</p>

<p>One of the women grabbed at her fichu; another tugged at the
ribbon in her hair; the older ones lifted her dress and pulled at
the lace petticoats, the dainty stockings and silk garters. Obscene
jests went round:</p>

<p>"Strip off her clothes!" called Legendre, the young imp with the
game leg.</p>

<p>"Pigs! Curs! Let her go!" De Marigny cried at the top of his
voice, and tried to reach his daughter, but the whole crowd was in
the way, laughing and jeering, pressing round the girl with shouts
of derision and of glee. They elbowed De Marigny out of the way.
One of the men struck him on the face with his fist, and he fell
bleeding to the ground. He tried to drag himself up again until
another man kicked him and he lost consciousness.</p>

<p>Aurore gave an agonized cry of horror, the first she had uttered
since she had faced the crowd. Wildly, like a young animal at bay,
she looked about her, and her eyes met those of Andr&eacute; Vallon.</p>

<p>He as outside the crowd, had stood there ever since she first
came into the room, vaguely retracing in his mind the childish
features of ten years ago in that lovely face, contorted with fear.
With a mechanical movement his hand went up to his breast, where
all those years ago her head had rested for one brief moment, on
the very spot where they empty sleeve was now attached. Her soft
fair hair had tickled his cheeks; the scent of violets and roses
had risen to his nostrils. He had been in a dream until the rough
blow on his face from the hand of an insolent fop had awakened him
and kept him awake all those years with the memory of a crowning
insult.</p>

<p>He had been in a dream then; he was in a dream now, until her
eyes met his. Then suddenly he pushed his way through the crowd.
With his one arm he seized Aurore round the waist and lifted her
off her feet.</p>

<p>"The wench is mine!" he called aloud.</p>

<p>Holding her closely to him, he pushed his way back as far as the
door of the boudoir to the accompaniment of vociferous shouts and
laughter from the astonished crowd. Here was a novel spectacle,
forsooth!</p>

<p>"He was always a madcap, that Andr&eacute;!" the women declared, while
laughter brought tears to their eyes. Laughter, perhaps, or
something a little softer, more gentle: a vague sense of romance
never quite absent from the hearts of a Latin race.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had allowed the girl to slide out of the shelter of his
arm. She collapsed on the floor right against the door like a
pathetic bundle of laces and frills. She was not quite conscious.
Terror and horror combined had obscured her senses. With her small
trembling hands she grasped the corner of a console as she slid
down on her knees, and through her bloodless lips came pitiful
moans and whispered murmurs, "Father! My father!"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; stood guard over her like a desert beast over its prey. He
stood, tall and erect, with head thrown back and legs wide apart, a
vivid presentment of the conquering male. The crowd was certainly
amused. Some of them tried to push forward to peer once again
closely at the aristo, her silks and her laces, but Andr&eacute; with his
stentorian voice kept them all at bay.</p>

<p>"Hands off! The wench is mine!"</p>

<p>"What will you do with her, Andr&eacute;?" a voice called laughing out
of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Take her for wife, <i>pardi</i>," Andr&eacute; retorted. "I must have someone
to wash and cook for me. The wench pleases me. She's mine!"</p>

<p>This sally was greeted with a wealth of coarse jests from the
men, but the women were all on the side of Andr&eacute;. They liked his
looks, his flashing eyes, darker than ever in his pale, determined
face. They liked his full red lips which showed a glimmer of white
teeth like those of a young cat.</p>

<p>"Let him be, he was always a madcap!"</p>

<p>"If he wants the wench, why shouldn't he have her?"</p>

<p>And whisperings went the round: stories of Andr&eacute; Vallon's pranks
before he left the village to seek fortune in Paris. Not a boy for
leagues around he had not licked, not a pretty girl whom he had not
kissed.</p>

<p>"Let him have her if he wants her."</p>

<p>The men agreed. Even Tarbot, whose lust for killing had a few
moments ago turned him into a savage brute, shrugged his wide
shoulders and said coolly with a coarse jest:</p>

<p>"Better than the guillotine, anyway!"</p>

<p>One of the men who had worked at the maire in Nevers added
sententiously:</p>

<p>"If he likes to take her for wife there would be no guillotine
for her."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" the others asked.</p>

<p>"The new law," the man from Nevers declared curtly. "A patriot
may save an aristo from the guillotine if he chooses to marry
her."</p>

<p>They discussed this matter from several points of view. Those
big-wigs up in Paris were always framing new laws, but this was not
a bad one. France was in need of children. The men, at any rate,
were all in its favour beacause, forsooth, they were well-favoured,
those aristos&mdash;soft skins, fluffy hair, better nourished than
the poor village wenches. The women, on the other hand, liked the
romance of it, especially if the patriot was young and handsome,
like Andr&eacute; Vallon.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; himself listened to all the comments and the murmurings
with a vague smile on his lips. Perhaps he only half heard what was
said. His glance more often than not wandered round to that
motionless figure, crouching against the door, and when a pitiful
moan came to his ears, a look almost of ferocity flashed out of his
eyes.</p>

<p>The priest had contrived to get near to Aurore. He stooped and
put his hand on her shoulder. He whispered comforting words to her,
but the only response she gave was a pathetic murmur: "My father?
Where is he?"</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;, at sight of the priest, had become more and more
impatient, and suddenly, like a man who has come to the end of his
tether, he turned and kicked open the door. The small withdrawing
room beyond was in semidarkness. Jeannette was in there, squatting
on a low stool, weeping into her apron which covered her face.
There was a book on the floor, an open workbox, a piece of
embroidery on the table with a thimble and scissors beside it. The
room looked cozy in the half light with all these little
intimacies. Andr&eacute; glanced into it, then down on the crouching
figure at his feet. God in heaven! how he hated it all! The beauty,
the cosiness, and the perfume as of a bouquet of flowers that
seemed to dull his senses!</p>

<p>"Stop your mumblings," he said roughly to the priest, "and take
her in there."</p>

<p>Aurore wouldn't move, though she looked up for a moment when she
heard the door open behind her. Not seeing her father, she turned
on Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p>"My father!" she demanded.</p>

<p>He took her by the wrist and dragged her roughly into the
boudoir.</p>

<p>"I'll look after your father," he said curtly. "He's safe enough
for the moment."</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Rosemonde slipped in after them and closed the door.
Strangely enough, the crowd did not attempt to follow. They stood
outside jeering and sniggering, vastly amused at the turn of
events. So unexpected this romance of the aristo and that madcap
Andr&eacute;! It might turn to tragedy, some of them thought, but even so,
it was better than the guillotine.</p>

<p>Some of the men gazed down on De Marigny lying unconscious in a
corner of the room with a bleeding wound on his face: Bah! he was
hardly worth a kick now. A miserable rag of humanity, trampled in
the dust as he had been wont to trample those whom he despised. His
very life he owed to one of the despised rabble, and his daughter,
who was his pride and joy, would be the property of a man whom in
the past he would have looked on as lower than his dog. She would
have to cook and wash for him as Marianne Vallon had cooked and
washed up at the ch&acirc;teau. It was that, or the guillotine for the
lot of them. Ah! this revolution was indeed a great thing. It had
turned the tables on those proud aristos with a vengeance. More
power to its elbow, and long life to Georges Danton and all its
makers.</p>

<p>Long life above all to the child of the Revolution, Andr&eacute;
Vallon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter 23</h2>

<p>At first Aurore had made futile efforts to free herself from
Andr&eacute;'s grasp. Then, feeling helpless, she gave up the struggle,
whereupon he immediately released her wrist. She turned at once to
the door.</p>

<p>"Open, M. l'Abb&eacute;!" she called. "I must find Monseigneur."</p>

<p>The priest would have obeyed, but Andr&eacute; barred the way.</p>

<p>"I said that I would look after Marigny," he said curtly. "You
stay here with her."</p>

<p>Aurore's hand was on the door knob.</p>

<p>"Wait here, M. l'Abb&eacute;," she said, "while I speak with
Monseigneur."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was quite close to her, looking down on her half
quizzically, yet wholly in scorn. She threw back her head and
returned his mocking glance with defiance and cold contempt, and
when he put his hand over hers she withdrew it quickly, as if she
had been touched by some noisome animal. A grim smile curled round
Andr&eacute;'s set lips.</p>

<p>"If you go out through this door," he said coolly, "it means
death to your father, to this priest, to your servants and to
you."</p>

<p>Defiance in her eyes gave way to horror. She did not know what
had become of her father. The turmoil in the next room had subsided
to such an extent that she had not realized there was still danger
there from the crowd. This male ruffian here, with his brute
strength and mocking ways, seemed to be the only living creature
that she need fear. Apparently he had divined her thoughts, for
without another word he turned the knob and gently opened the door.
A murmur of many voices came to Aurore's ears. There were no longer
any shouts, no imprecations or threats&mdash;only that steady
murmur, and now and then a laugh. Just as the moment a man's voice
rose above the rest, and a phrase, coarse and hideously offensive,
accompanied by a cruel laugh, brought a blush of indignation and of
shame to the girl's face. It suffused her cheeks, her forehead to
the roots of her hair; only her lips remained bloodless. The glance
which she cast up at Andr&eacute; was almost one of appeal.</p>

<p>Miserable and helpless, she gazed round the room, longing to
find something&mdash;weapon, anything wherewith to end this
terrible situation. Again he seemed to divine her thoughts, gave a
light laugh and a shrug, then pointed to one of the chairs across
which lay Monseigneur's elegant sword, with its jewelled hilt and
chiselled scabbard. As she made no movement&mdash;indeed, she could
not have moved a limb just then&mdash;he went over to the chair and
picked up the sword. He made pretense to examine it; with his one
hand he worked the blade out of the scabbard, and with that
irritating, quizzical glance of his held the hilt out to her.</p>

<p>"Will this answer your purpose?" he asked.</p>

<p>Strangely fascinated by that blade from which, at the moment,
the evening light drew dull fantastic rays, she raised her hand and
took hold of the hilt. Here was the weapon to her hand: what should
she do with it? The brute stood there, waiting and mocking: oh, for
the strength to plunge this blade into his cruel, callous
heart!</p>

<p>"Aurore, my child!" the priest exclaimed, for, acting on blind
impulse, Aurore had stretched out her arm and was holding the point
of the blade to her throat.</p>

<p>"Let her be, Citizen Cur&eacute;," Andr&eacute; said coolly. "Reason has
already told her that with her death my wish to save her
father&mdash;and you&mdash;will vanish. Look, what did I tell you?
Even proud ladies listen to reason sometimes. And, anyhow, that
sword was both futile and ridiculous."</p>

<p>The sword fell out of Aurore's hand. Futile and ridiculous! How
true and how humiliating! Helpless, hopeless, and ashamed, she
buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;, my son!" the priest entreated, "you must have pity on us
all."</p>

<p>"Pity?" Andr&eacute; retorted lightly. "<i>Pardi</i>! Am I not showing you all
pity of which any man is capable? Have I not snatched her and her
miserable father, and you, my good friend, out of the jaws of
death? Has not my pity for her stayed the murderous hand of our
friend Tarbot and saved her from outrage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my son," the Cur&eacute; admitted, "and of a certainty God will
reward you; but surely you do not intend to carry your cruel
intention to its end?"</p>

<p>"What cruel intention? I have no other intention with regard to
this wench save to take her for wife."</p>

<p>"But, Andr&eacute;, my son, that is impossible."</p>

<p>"Impossible? Why?"</p>

<p>"Look at her, my child. Does she look like the wife of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;of a rapscallion?" Andr&eacute; broke in with a sneer. "That is
as may be and for her to decide. If the prospect is so very
displeasing, all she need do is to open this door and let the rest
of the canaille have its way with her, with her father, her
servants, and with you."</p>

<p>Then, as neither Aurore nor the Cur&eacute; spoke another word, he went
on, with an impatient shrug:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right, Citizen Cur&eacute;: the scheme will not work.
It is impossible, as you say, and I'd better let our friend Tarbot
have his way with you all."</p>

<p>Once more he turned to the door; but it was Aurore this time who
barred the way. A dull, half-choked cry came involuntarily from her
throat:</p>

<p>"No! no!"</p>

<p>She put out her hand, and he seized it.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said with a sigh of satisfaction, "reason has spoke
more loudly this time. Well! which is it to be, my fine lady? Death
at the hand of Tarbot or marriage with the canaille?"</p>

<p>The grip on her waist was like a tentacle of steel, but she
welcomed the physical pain almost as a solace to the mental agony
of the moment. She would not look at him, but turned appealing eyes
to the old priest, who, of a truth, could offer neither advice nor
consolation. It was for her to decide and he, for one, was content
to leave it all in the hands of his Maker. He clasped his hands and
prayed as he had never prayed before.</p>

<p>"Look at me, Aurore," Andr&eacute; commanded. "The decision rests with
you and not with the priest."</p>

<p>With what seemed like a refinement of cruelty, he once more
gently opened the door. They were still laughing and jeering out
there.</p>

<p>"My father!" she murmured.</p>

<p>And then added under her breath:</p>

<p>"For his sake, if you'll sear&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could say no more, for she was on the point of swooning.
Andr&eacute;'s powerful arm encircled her drooping body, while an immense
sigh of satisfaction rose from his breast.</p>

<p>"<i>Par Dieu!</i>" he said lightly. "I had no idea you were so
beautiful, <i>ma mie!</i>"</p>

<p>And of a truth she was exquisitely beautiful, with those deep,
unfathomable eyes of hers filled with terror and with hate, her red
lips parted in a final appeal for mercy. She had been on the point
of swooning, but now that he raised her to him&mdash;that she saw
his face, his dark eyes, his cruel, sneering mouth closer and ever
closer, a moment's consciousness returned to her with the horror of
it all.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" she gasped. "I hate you!"</p>

<p>"Of course you do, my dear," he retorted. "We hate each
other&mdash;that is understood. But Fate has decided to link us
together until, like two wildcats, we shall have torn one another's
soul to shreds. In the meanwhile, in the presence of our friend,
the Citizen Cur&eacute;, we will seal our mutual promise to one another
with a kiss."</p>

<p>She felt helpless and stifled as his arm held her closer and
closer; with her two hands she tried to push against him&mdash;his
face, his breast. But her struggles only seemed to amuse him; his
eyes flashed mockery instead of passion, while they seemed to
search the very depths of her soul.</p>

<p>"You are beautiful!" he reiterated slowly&mdash;very
slowly&mdash;while those mocking eyes of his drank in every detail
of her loveliness: her blue-veined lids, her perfect mouth, the
exquisite contour of throat and chin. "You are beautiful, but, on
second thoughts, <i>ma mie</i>, I'll not kiss you yet. Not to-day. I'll
wait," he added with a light laugh, "till those perfect lips ask
mine for a kiss."</p>

<p>And suddenly he slackened his hold on her, lifted her off the
ground, and carried her to the sofa. He called peremptorily to
Jeannette, who was whimpering under cover of her apron, and ordered
her to look after her mistress.</p>

<p>Then, without another word, he strode out of the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter 24</h2>

<p>The crowd in the meantime had worked its will in the old
ch&acirc;teau. With the exit of the hero and heroine of a brief romance,
reaction had set in. The fury of reprisal, merged for a moment in
laughter and coarse jests, reasserted its domination. The aristos
were ashamed and punished; the ci-devant Marigny lay half dead on
the floor; but this seemed hardly compensation enough for two
smouldering cottages and the death of a valiant woman. Not enough,
of a truth, with all this magnificence flaunted in these gorgeous
halls, with tapestries and sconces and mirrors, all accessible to
eager, needy hands. Not much notice was taken of Marigny. Once
kicked conveniently aside, he was allowed to remain lying there.
Dead or alive? Who cared, when there were damask curtains to be had
for the taking?&mdash;useful things to replace shawls and blankets
long since worn to rags. Down came the curtains, one after the
other, torn down by vigorous hands. In the vast banqueting halls
there was not much that was useful, but there were chairs and
tables to replace humble ones that had been used for fuel when
other wood was so dear. And in the bedrooms there were beds and
mattresses and pillows and blankets; there was china and there were
carpets. The crowd wandered from room to room, from stately hall
down to pantries and kitchens and bakehouses. The cellars were
empty, and so were the larders, but there were pots and pans
galore. Where silver and gold were hidden they knew not. Perhaps
they never even thought of such things. It was the chairs and the
tables, the curtains and the pots and pans that they needed and
that they took.</p>

<p>Who shall judge them? Who condemn? They had nothing, and they
took. For generations successive governments had taken from them
all that they had. Human nature will always try and hit back when
it has the chance. They were not evil, these people here; they were
not really cruel and rapacious by nature: hunger and want had made
them so, and the sense of oppression and injustice. Who, of a
truth, shall condemn them?</p>

<p>When they were tired of looking and had their arms full, when
they were wearied with the day's work and emotion, they wandered
homeward. The evening was drawing in, and squalid homes called to
them, and the longing to gloat over stolen treasure and find use
for it all. One by one, or in groups of twos and threes, they
trudged back through the vast halls, shorn now of much glory, down
marble stairs, and across the forecourt. Their naked feet were sore
with tramping; they wanted to get home.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; stood for a long time by the door, listening and watching.
The great reception room was deserted by now, but he could heard
the crowd wandering about the ch&acirc;teau; he could hear cries of
delight and laughter and guessed what was going on. He made his way
across the room to the window, staggering in the darkness like a
man drunk. Leaning against the window frame, he gazed out into the
fast-gathering gloom. From the distance, now and then, there still
came the dull rumbling of faraway thunder, and from time to time
the treetops were lit up with the reflex of distant lightning, but
the storm never broke over Marigny on that never-to-be-forgotten
day in July.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; watched the crowd, as, one by one, they came through the
gate, bearing their loot&mdash;furniture, tapestries, clothes. The
women staggered under their loads; the men looked like beasts of
burden, dragging their shoeless feet over the paved forecourt.
Slowly, wearily, they made their way down the wooded slope. Andr&eacute;,
through the darkness, could still distinguish some of them: the
women in their faded kirtles; the naked bodies of little children;
Tarbot and his red cap, Mol&eacute; and his ragged shirt. He thought of
his mother, lying on the old paillasse, with a ragged shawl to
cover her body, and all around her the ruins of her home. And with
thoughts of her there came into his soul an immense wave of
shame.</p>

<p>The large empty room with its torn tapestries and gilded chairs
lying topsy-turvy about the floor became filled all at once with
imps and demons who hopped all around him and cried, "Shame!" in
his ears. They called him a fool and coward. Why not have allowed
the mob to have its way with the aristos? Were they not his
friends? Riffraff, like himself? Then why have interfered? There
might have been some satisfaction in seeing justice done. A life
for a life! Those miserable aristos for the saintly woman who lay
silent and stark in her devastated home.</p>

<p>With a rough gesture he brushed those imaginary demons away.
Shame had brought the blood beating in his temples. "Coward!" and
"Traitor!" he called himself, and then signed with a great
unexplainable longing. "Justice! Truth! My God! where are they
now?"</p>

<p>The room was so still! So still! Andr&eacute; strained his ears to hear
any sound that might come from the boudoir. After a moment or two
he heard a soft grating; the door was opened very gently, a narrow
shaft of light pierced the gloom, and the old priest tiptoed
stealthily into the room. Andr&eacute; listened without stirring: the old
man had left the door slightly ajar and now groped his way
cautiously about in the darkness. A moment or two later soft
murmurings came to Andr&eacute;'s ears; then a sigh&mdash;a struggle. And
the priest's kindly words:</p>

<p>"Lean on my arm, monseigneur..."</p>

<p>And then another sigh. A whisper: "Aurore!"</p>

<p>"She is safe, monseigneur. Shall we go to her?"</p>

<p>"Has that canaille gone?"</p>

<p>"There is no one here now, monseigneur..."</p>

<p>"My head! My head! May God punish those ruffians!"</p>

<p>"Do lean on me, monseinguer...I am quite strong...Don't be
afraid."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;'s eyes, accustomed to the gloom, could now perceive the
two old men moving slowly towards the door. Instinctively he
stepped back from the window farther into the shadows, and thus,
hidden from view, he waited until the priest had piloted De Marigny
back into the boudoir.</p>

<p>As the Cur&eacute; was about to follow, Andr&eacute; called to him:</p>

<p>"Citizen Rosemonde!" The priest paused with his hand still on
the door knob, and Andr&eacute; called again: "Close that door. I want to
speak with you."</p>

<p>The voice was low, scarcely above a whisper, but so peremptory
that the priest, after a few seconds' hesitation, closed the door
and came across the room. With the passing of immediate danger to
Monseigneur and Aurore he seemed to have recovered something of his
natural dignity. He approached Andr&eacute; not as a servant beckoned to
by his master, but as a minister of God, with a mission to mediate
between warring souls.</p>

<p>"What is it you wish, my son?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Only to give you a word of warning, citizen," Andr&eacute; replied
curtly. "You must understand once and for all that my mind is made
up. I have decided to take that woman in there for my wife. As you
have taken the oath of allegiance to the Republic, you are bound in
law to perform the marriage ceremony. You know that, do you
not?"</p>

<p>"I know it, my son, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no 'but' about it. If you refuse you forfeit every
privilege which your oath of allegiance has conferred upon you.
Your church will be closed, and you may or may not escape with your
life. But even that is beside the question, for if the marriage is
not solemnized in your church it will be done in the maire which,
as you also know, is all that the law requires."</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;, my child," the priest protested, "I implore you to think
over what you propose doing. I beg it of you in your mother's
name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not speak of my mother, Citizen Cur&eacute;," Andr&eacute; broke in
harshly, "or I swear to you that I will call the worst of that
rabble back and hand over that damned assassin to them to be dealt
with as they choose."</p>

<p>"But such a marriage is an outrage, Andr&eacute;!"</p>

<p>"Was not the eviction of two defenceless women and a pack of
starving children an outrage? Was not the ruin of their homes an
outrage? My mother's death&mdash;was that not a murder most
foul?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" the priest exclaimed, "then you admit it, Andr&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"Admit what?"</p>

<p>"That your whole purpose is one of revenge."</p>

<p>"Call it justice, Citizen Cur&eacute;. You'll be nearer the mark."</p>

<p>"And you, my son, will be the first to suffer."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; shrugged with cynical indifference.</p>

<p>"Bah!" he said. "Your friend Marigny would tell you that
muckworms such as I are made to suffer."</p>

<p>The priest was silent for a moment or two. His heart ached for
this man whom he had seen grow up in this village&mdash;a merry,
care-free lad whom the cruelty of fate, and perhaps of men, had
rendered bitter and cynical. But it ached also for the exquisite
girl whose every instinct of pride and aloofness would be outraged
by this monstrous union.</p>

<p>"You will kill her, Andr&eacute;," he sighed, "if you persist."</p>

<p>"Bah!" Andr&eacute; retorted drily. "She's young. She will get used to
being the wife of a caitiff. And anyhow, her life and that of her
father will be safe. I can see to that."</p>

<p>"Alas!"</p>

<p>"Why alas?"</p>

<p>"They would sooner be dead."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; gave a scornful laugh.</p>

<p>"The aristo's sword," he said, "is still handy."</p>

<p>"I forbid you to mock, Andr&eacute;," the priest retorted with energy.
"Religion which you choose to ignore still holds sway in the hearts
of many, and religion forbids&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suicide," Andr&eacute; broke in. "Yes, I know! Well, the rabble only
needs recalling&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;, in Heaven's name, don't talk like that! I am appealing
to your pity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pity? Would you call it pity to let a pack of snarling hyenas
loose once again on this house, to stand by and see that arrogant
old madman in there massacred before his daughter's eyes, to see
her brutalized and outraged as a prelude to death? Is that what you
would choose for her, Citizen Rosemonde?"</p>

<p>The old priest's head fell upon his breast. He felt utterly
helpless and ashamed of his helplessness. A little while ago he
believed in his mission of conciliation, but that mission had
failed. His simple faith in divine interference had received a rude
shock, as did his earnest belief in the justice of the Royalist
cause. For here was a rebel who gloried in his rebellion, who
demanded justice from God and man with as much right as the most
earnest adherent to the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. Like Andr&eacute; himself awhile ago,
the Abb&eacute; Rosemonde could have signed with unutterable longing,
"Truth? Justice? Where are they now?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said with a doleful shake of the head, "that
you've said your last word, and that nothing which I can say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, citizen," Andr&eacute; broke in impatiently, "nothing. I have said
my last word. Go down into the village, if you have a mind, and
talk to the men there. Tell them that religion bids them forego
revenge, and that if a man smite you on the cheek, to hold out the
other so that he might smite you again. Tell that to men who have
toiled and starved and sweated and seen their wives and children
die for want of food, while the tax collector stood at the door and
seized the few sous that would have bought them bread. Tell it to
men who have seen their brides dragged from their arms to satisfy
the caprice of their seigneur. Talk to them of forgiveness, Citizen
Cur&eacute;, now that they are the masters of France and have the power to
give back blow for blow the and outrage for outrage."</p>

<p>Again the priest was silent. There was so little that he could
say. Never before had he been made to feel that there was something
after all to be said for those terrorists who had earned for
themselves the obloquy of half the world, but who had, of a truth,
been the first to instill into a downtrodden people a sense of
their power, both as men and as guardians of their families'
welfare and of their family honour. Demagogues they were, and
stirrers up of infinite trouble. They had let loose on the sacred
soil of France a horde of savage brutes bent on ruin and
persecution. All that was true enough, but there had been such an
infinity of wrong to put right that nothing short of this immense
upheaval could possibly have done it all. But dominating all other
thoughts and fears in the old man's heart were those for
Aurore.</p>

<p>"You will be kind to her, Andr&eacute;," he implored, "if she
consents."</p>

<p>"I care not if she consents or no," Andr&eacute; retorted. "Either she
is mine or I let loose the floodgates of the people's wrath on this
house till there remains nothing of it but a few blackened stones
like those of my mother's cottage, nothing but a memory of all the
arrogance and the cruelty which have tuned us all into the wild
beasts that we are."</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had spoken all along in a kind of hoarse murmur and
without making a single gesture. Now his voice broke into a sob. He
stood there in the darkness by the open window with the last
glimmer of the western light outlining his clear-cut profile, the
firm jaw and noble forehead with its crown of chestnut hair. And
while he spoke he looked out into the distance, where far away in
the peaceful valley below a puff of smoke still hung in the heavy
storm-laden air. Just a puff of smoke there where the cottage once
stood, where he, Andr&eacute;, had spent the thoughtless years of
childhood, where he had first learned the bitter lesson of manhood,
where he had dreamed and planned and waited for this hour which had
struck at last.</p>

<p>"You have not yet told me, Andr&eacute;" the Cur&eacute; said at last, "what
you wish me to do."</p>

<p>"I want you to be prepared to give my bride and me the nuptial
blessing in your church to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Blessing!" the priest exclaimed with the nearest approach to
sarcasm he had ever in his life expressed.</p>

<p>"As you please, of course&mdash;or as she pleases, for the
matter of that. I am satisfied with the maire, as the law
directs."</p>

<p>"I will do as God wills," the priest concluded with gentle
dignity. "But let me tell you this, my son: your union with Aurore
de Marigny is on the understanding that her life and that of her
father and servants will be safe. God is long-suffering, remember,
but believe me that He will know how to punish you if you should
break your word."</p>

<p>He turned and slowly groped his way across the room. Andr&eacute;
watched him till the door of the boudoir finally closed upon
him.</p>

<p>Then he, too, went his way.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>Chapter 25</h2>

<p>In an angle of the staircase Andr&eacute; came across Pierre, concealed
behind a marble column, crouching there in the dark like a
frightened rabbit.</p>

<p>"Come and lock the gate after me, citizen," he said, and with
scant ceremony dragged the man out of his hiding place.</p>

<p>Pierre, trembling but obedient, followed him. When the great
gates fell to with a clang behind him, Andr&eacute; stood for a moment on
the <i>perron</i>, breathing in the heavy air of this summer's night. It
seemed as if he longed to be rid of the scent of perfume and of
flowers which clung to his nostrils and made his head ache with its
cloying fragrance. Once or twice he passed his hand across his brow
and through the thick mop of his hair. His talk with the priest
which had resolved itself into a kind of profession of faith had
left him in a state of bewilderment. He felt that he had become a
puzzle to himself.</p>

<p>"Am I a brute?" he murmured. "A wild beast&mdash;a pitiless
savage beast? Or just a man who has lost the being dearest to him
in all the world and has nothing left in his heart but the very
human desire for some measure of revenge?"</p>

<p>He wondered what his dead mother would have said had her
precious life been spared and she had been a witness to this
afternoon's tragedy. She, with her quiet philosophy and sober
common sense, what would she have said in face of the homeless
Louvet children and her own ruined home? Would she still have
preached her favourite doctrine that evil cannot be cured with more
evil? And would she still be hugging the fond belief that those
aristos "up there" had learned something from the terrible events
which had precipitated their king from his throne and left him and
their kindred to the guillotine? If he had eyes to see and ears to
hear, would that arrogant madman "up there" have infuriated the
people to the point of seeing his daughter insulted before his
eyes?</p>

<p>"They have learned nothing," Andr&eacute; murmured to himself. "The
lesson has, it seems, not yet been driven home."</p>

<p>He cast a look back on the stately pile, majestic still, in
spite of approaching decay. All the windows were dark save one at
the end, and here a feeble light glimmered behind a drawn curtain.
They were in there. All of them. The aristo, the priest, and the
girl. The priest had told him by now of the ultimatum which meant
life and safety in exchange for union with one of the canaille. And
Andr&eacute; then pictured to himself what they would all say: imagine
Marigny's vituperations, the priest's exhortations, and the girl's
tears. She would weep, of course, and protest; beat her wings like
a bird caught in a trap; and Andr&eacute; wondered how she looked when she
wept. Women were usually ugly when tears trickled down their cheeks
and their noses became red. Did those great unfathomable eyes
become red and swollen, he wondered, or did the tears make their
depths more mysterious still?</p>

<p>"Bah!" he exclaimed impatiently, "as if I cared!"</p>

<p>He strode down the steps and across the flagged forecourt. He
was on the point of turning into the bridle path which led down to
the valley through the woods when he spied a dark figure which
slipped quickly past him and then through the gates into the
forecourt. Andr&eacute; watched the figure as, presently, it mounted the
<i>perron</i> and, in a moment, disappeared through the great gates into
the ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>Now the gates had been locked by Pierre when Andr&eacute; left the
ch&acirc;teau a few minutes ago. Pierre must have opened them again
almost directly, which meant that the nocturnal visitor was a
familiar of the house and was apparently expected.</p>

<p>"Talon, of course," Andr&eacute; thought. "Now I wonder what the rascal
is up to. He gave us the slip this afternoon. Then why has he come
now?"</p>

<p>The result of his cogitation was that he retraced his steps and
turned back into the forecourt just at the moment when a dim light
travelled past the row of windows on the front of the ch&acirc;teau and
stopped short at the door of the boudoir, where it was suddenly
extinguished.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter 26</h2>

<p>Andr&eacute; was wrong in his supposition. Talon was not expected at
the ch&acirc;teau: it was by chance that Pierre had stood for a time by
the gate, busy with lighting a couple of laterns which he usually
carried with him about the house. He had spied Hector Talon and
opened the gate for him. He gave him a lantern, and Talon made his
way across the hall and up the stairs with a catlike tread. He was
one of those men who have carried the trick of walking noiselessly
to a fine art: he made no sound as he went across the great
reception room and came to a halt outside the boudoir door. Here he
extinguished the lantern, then waited. Stooping, he glued first an
eye and then an ear to the keyhole. What he heard seemed to please
him, for his hatchet face broadened into a leer.</p>

<p>He knocked softly at the door, heard Monseigneur's voice and
Jeannette's shuffling tread. The door was opened, and with a timid:
"May I enter?" he stepped into the room.</p>

<p>Monseigneur was half sitting, half lying across the sofa: his
cravat was undone. Aurore was behind him, intent on placing a white
linen bandage over his forehead. M. l'Abb&eacute; de Rosemonde was sitting
at the table in the window with his breviary open before him. No
one said a word to Talon as he entered, but after a moment or two
Jeannette, still at the door, turned to Aurore and asked: "Can I
see about supper now, mademoiselle?" Aurore nodded, and Jeannette
went away.</p>

<p>Talon ventured a step or two farther into the room.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur..." he began in his most obsequious tone.</p>

<p>De Marigny raised his head slightly, half opened his eyes, and
looked Talon up and down as if he did not know who he was.</p>

<p>"Why are you here?" he asked at last. "Get out!"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," Talon reiterated in a gentle, persuasive voice,
"you know you can command my devotion. I am here to offer you my
services."</p>

<p>"There is nothing you can do," Charles de Marigny said wearily.
"Go away."</p>

<p>Talon glanced from one face to the other. The Abb&eacute; appeared
absorbed in his breviary. Aurore had not once glanced at him. Talon
thought the Abb&eacute;'s attitude looked the least uncompromising.</p>

<p>"M. l'Abb&eacute;," he pleaded, "do, I entreat you, persuade
Monseigneur that it is in his best interests and those of
Mademoiselle Aurore to listen to me. I have come with the best and
most loyal intentions."</p>

<p>Thus directly appealed to, the Abb&eacute; said, not unkindly: "Even
so, my good Talon, I don't see what you can do. I don't suppose you
know all that happened here this afternoon. You were so very safely
out of the way."</p>

<p>"I do know, M. l'Abb&eacute;," Talon rejoined. "Everything."</p>

<p>At which Aurore's tired, swollen eyes shot a quick, suspicious
glance at him.</p>

<p>"I met that blackguard Andr&eacute; Vallon just now," Talon went on
glibly, "coming away from here...alone. He chose to jeer at me for
my loyalty to Monseigneur, and to threaten me with denunciation as
a traitor if I did aught to cross his villainous schemes." He
paused a moment, measuring the effect of his outrageous lies, and
then went on, dropping his voice almost to a whisper: "He openly
boasted before me of&mdash;of his coming marriage with Mademoiselle
Aurore."</p>

<p>Again he paused, waiting for a word, a sign, either from
Monseigneur or from the girl. He felt sick with apprehension and
found it terribly difficult to keep up this appearance of
obsequiousness, the habit of which he had lost in these past few
years. He also felt very tired. He had had a very trying day, both
physically and emotionally. His head ached, and his feet were sore;
his knees scarcely bore him. He wanted to sit down, to fall back
into the easy familiarity to which he had accustomed himself of
late, but he had too much at stake to dare risk offending
Monseigneur or Mademoiselle. He had garnered scraps of information
from the crowd as he met them wending their way homeward, but had
scarcely believed his ears when, with much jeering and laughing and
obvious satisfaction, they told him of Citizen Vallon's
extraordinary project to marry the daughter of the aristo.</p>

<p>The last thing in the world Talon could have foreseen! The last
thing in the world he would have wished. De Marigny's daughter
married to a man like Vallon&mdash;well known in influential places
as a friend of Danton&mdash;and "good-bye" to his beloved scheme of
obtaining possession of the estates. There would no longer be the
slightest need to emigrate or to transfer the property for
worthless bonds to him. The situation was perilous because it was
imminent. The women in the crowd had talked of the legal marriage
taking place on the morrow. Talon had hurried up to the ch&acirc;teau. He
wanted to clear up this dangerous situation. If Aurore de Marigny
had indeed agreed to the marriage in order to save her father's
life and her own, she must as quickly as possible be made to
realize that such a sacrifice was unnecessary while there was a
faithful and loyal bailiff at hand to show an easier and more
dignified way out.</p>

<p>It was a little disconcerting to see her so calm and silent, and
Monseigneur more disdainful than ever, when he had thought to find
them both distraught and verging on despair. In spite of his aching
feet and tired back Talon did not sit down, and as the Abb&eacute;
appeared to be more approachable than the others, Talon kept his
attention fixed on him:</p>

<p>"Monsieur l'Abb&eacute;," he began, "you are a holy man; your loyalty
to Monseigneur is as great as my own. Surely you will not allow
this monstrous union to take place."</p>

<p>"You know as well as I do," the Abb&eacute; replied simply, "that I am
powerless to prevent it."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the sort, M. l'Abb&eacute;," Talon retorted with
well feigned vehemence. "Anyone who, like yourself, has
Monseigneur's complete confidence can prevent it. You
especially."</p>

<p>"My ministration," the Abb&eacute; said, "is not imperative. Andr&eacute;
Vallon is a lawyer, and he knows that. If I refuse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did not mean that, M. l'Abb&eacute;!" Talon broke in impatiently.
"We are none of us lawyers here, and yet we all know that by the
new marriage laws a declaration before the maire is all that is
necessary. I did not mean anything so futile."</p>

<p>"Then what did you mean, my good Talon?" the Cur&eacute; asked,
na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>"That Monseigneur and Mademoiselle must get away while there is
still time."</p>

<p>"Get away?" The old man was puzzled, for he had never heard of
Monseigneur's half-formed project to emigrate. "Get away? How?
Where?" He closed his breviary and leaned forward, listening
eagerly, while even Monseigneur seemed to forget his pain and
weariness and sat up to gaze inquiringly on Talon, and Aurore's
great tired eyes seemed indeed to probe to the very depths of the
man's soul.</p>

<p>Talon glanced round, satisfied. He thought he time had come when
he might sit down, and he sank into a chair with a great sigh of
satisfaction. He beamed on Monseigneur, with arms outspread, like a
kind and benevolent father talking to weeping children: "Voyons,
monseigneur," he said, "mademoiselle! did you really think that
Talon would abandon you in the hour of your greatest need? Why,
ever since that awful rabble set out to intimidate you up here, I
have been scheming and planning to encompass your safety."</p>

<p>"Don't talk so much drivel, Talon," Monseigneur put in drily,
"but tell us what you want."</p>

<p>"To get you away from here as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Too late," Monseigneur sighed involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Why too late? It wants three more hours before midnight and
eight before the dawn."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Talon?"</p>

<p>"That I will have a covered cart here at your door about three
o'clock of the morning. One of my farm hands will drive you to
Nevers. There you can get the diligence to Bourges. It starts soon
after dawn. At Bourges you can easily get a further conveyance as
far as Tours...You have money, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, some&mdash;but no papers, no passports&mdash;nothing!"</p>

<p>"I have both," Talon continued eagerly. "I have papers and
passports which were made out six months ago for my brother-in-law,
who was a widower, and his daughter. He died before he could
undertake the journey, and she has gone to live with relatives
somewhere in the South. I found the papers among his effects
without ever thinking that they would be of use. They are yours, if
you like to use them. You can easily make up to look like the owner
of the passport, Achille V&eacute;rand: he was about your age and build;
and young ladies," he concluded jocosely, "can always be made up to
look like one another."</p>

<p>The whole thing was a lie, of course. It was more than six
months since Hector Talon had nursed hopes that Charles de Marigny
would one day decide to emigrate. He had forged or stolen the
papers, or mayhap just acquired them from some influential friend.
Men like Talon always contrive to get what official documents they
want. Anyway, there they were, the blessed, blessed passports!
Talon laid them on the table, and the table was then dragged across
to the sofa so that Monseigneur could look at them at his ease.
Monseigneur, Mademoiselle, and M. l'Abb&eacute; all pored over them. Those
blessed, blessed passports!</p>

<p>They were made out in the dame of Achille V&eacute;rand, doctor of
philosophy, aged sixty, native of Vanzy in Ni&egrave;vre, and of
Marigu&eacute;rite V&eacute;rand his daughter, spinster, aged twenty-two. The
descriptions? Well, they certainly did tally in a
wonderful&mdash;an unexplainable manner. And all the papers had the
official seal of the maire of Vanzy and the countersign of the
local member of the Committee of Public Safety which sits at
Nevers. Everything was in perfect, in absolute order. It was a most
marvellous, a most heaven-sent coincidence that Monseigneur and
Mademoiselle could make up so easily to resemble Achille and
Margu&eacute;rite V&eacute;rand.</p>

<p>Aurore, even Aurore, in her eagerness forgot all her prejudices
against Talon. He was no longer to be suspected of evil intentions.
He was the harbinger of hope. Captives, they were being shown he
way to deliverance; drowning, they felt a hand stretched out to
drag them to the shore. M. l'Abb&eacute; was once more getting convinced
that God was on the side of the Royalist cause. And Talon was
entirely in his element. Easy, familiar, jocose, he propounded his
plan, satisfied that at last, not only was he in sight of the
life's desire, but actually held the prize in his hand.</p>

<p>"You could go too, M. l'Abb&eacute;," he said, "if you wish. I can
arrange papers for you also."</p>

<p>He had friends in Paris, he explained. Certain services which he
had rendered the country had forced men in high places to recognize
his worth, so if M. l'Abb&eacute; desired...But M. l'Abb&eacute; gently shook his
head.</p>

<p>"While the altar of God stands in Val-le-Roi," he said, "I shall
be there to administer the Holy Sacraments. But, monseigneur," he
exclaimed in no ecstasy of hope, "my dear Aurore, to think that
freedom can, with the will of God, be yours!"</p>

<p>She talked of not going without him, but he said earnestly:
"Your father is your first consideration, my child. It is his life
and your honour that are in peril. Your father must be your first
and, indeed, your only thought."</p>

<p>And frankly, Monseigneur agreed with him. Probably he did not
think that the Abb&eacute; would be in any danger, once he and Aurore were
out of the way. It was against them that the fury of the mob and of
that brutish ruffian Vallon was directed. And to his proud spirit
any human life was worth the sacrifice to save the daughter of De
Marigny from the outrage of a union with an Andr&eacute; Vallon.</p>

<p>Presently some of the excitement subsided, and Talon's plan was
soberly discussed. Aurore went out of the room to put a few
necessities together for herself and her father. The cart, Talon
explained, would be at the gate one hour before the break of dawn.
Two hours' drive, and they would be in Nevers. At six o'clock the
diligence started for Bourges. Talon had thought of everything, and
the farm hand who would drive the cart was loyal and reliable.</p>

<p>Only one more matter had to be settled: the assignment of the
Marigny estates to Hector Talon, bailiff, native of Val-le-Roi in
Ni&egrave;vre, for the sum of two million livres, payable in State
assignats, receipt of which was hereby acknowledged by the vendor
Charles Henri Marigny, ci-devant Duc de Marigny. Monseigneur hardly
did more than glance at the papers. The horrors which he had gone
through that afternoon had somewhat sobered that arrogant sense of
possessio and prerogative which theoretically he would have guarded
with his life. But when it came to Aurore's future&mdash;her future
with that brutish ruffian&mdash;by God! Charles de Marigny would
have assigned all his worldly belongings, without counting the
cost, to any man who saved her from such a fate.</p>

<p>He signed the papers, and Talon solemnly laid on the table
assignats with the face value of two million livres. He had
sufficient self-control not to show too plainly how intense was his
satisfaction. He folded up the papers most carefully and tucked
them inside his coat.</p>

<p>"This is a step which you will never regret, my friend," he
said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," De Marigny retorted drily, "but let me assure you
of one thing, my man, and that is that you will regret
it&mdash;bitterly&mdash;if in any way you play me false."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," Talon protested. "How can you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! I know more about the laws of this hellish government than
you suppose. I know, for instance, that these assignments are not
valid if the assignor dies within the year. The State in that case
takes possession of the property. So it is not in your interest,
you rascal, to play the traitor, and you know it."</p>

<p>"My good friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough! Mademoiselle and I are safe from your double dealings
for one year. Long before then, please God, we shall be in Belgium.
And when sanity once more reigns in this demented land, and the
King&mdash;God save him!&mdash;comes back into his own, your rule
over my property will automatically cease."</p>

<p>"I know that, my good sir!"</p>

<p>"A sound-minded government will soon make you disgorge."</p>

<p>"I am taking that risk."</p>

<p>"Well, so long as you know that you are taking it...I only
wanted you to understand that I am not the fool you fondly imagine.
I am taking a risk, I know&mdash;but I am banking on the not far
distant future when rascals such as you and ruffians like that
Vallon will get their deserts."</p>

<p>"In the meantime," Talon concluded with undisguised sarcasm,
"you deign to accept the use of my cart and horse, my farm hand,
and the passports which I obtained for you at my own risk and peril
to help you to flee this country and seek safety in Belgium."</p>

<p>To this Charles de Marigny vouchsafed no reply. The shaft had
probably gone home. He despised this man, called him at pleasure a
rascal and a thief, but he was at this moment the only being in the
whole land who could save him and his daughter from death and worse
than death. Talon, having had his say, was now ready to go.</p>

<p>"We meet in happier times, my friend," he said drily, "times
happier for you, I mean. When you are safe in Belgium you will,
perhaps, remember to whom you owe your safety. I will administer
this estate as if it were my own for good and all. The wretched
brat whom you call your king may come into his kingdom some day.
Personally I doubt it, or I would never have done this deal. The
cart will be here at the hour I have named. Good-night! Pleasant
dreams! M. l'Abb&eacute;, your servant."</p>

<p>He shuffled out of the room, and for some time his footsteps,
gradually dying away in the distance, were the only sound that
broke the stillness of the night.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter 27</h2>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Rosemonde had resumed his orisons. Monseigneur was lost
in a brown reverie from which the creaking of the massive gate as
it was opened and then shut again roused him after awhile. He lent
an ear to Talon's footsteps as they echoed faintly along the
flagstones of the forecourt.</p>

<p>A moment or two later Aurore came back.</p>

<p>"That awful Talon gone?" she asked with a sigh of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank God!" De Marigny replied. "I hate the sight of the
rogue."</p>

<p>"He has saved us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know that," De Marigny was ready to admit, "but he has done
it for his own ends. He has saved us, as you say, my dear. And for
this I suppose we should be grateful."</p>

<p>"There is no possibility," Aurore queried anxiously, "of his
playing us false?"</p>

<p>"It would be entirely against his own interests if he did," De
Marigny replied drily.</p>

<p>"And at three o'clock we go!" she said with a long-drawn-out
sigh. And then added under her breath: "I am glad that it will
still be dark. I hope it will be very dark."</p>

<p>"It will make it safer, of course."</p>

<p>"Not because of that," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Then why...?"</p>

<p>"I would rather not see Marigny when I go."</p>

<p>"You will see it when you return, my child," the Abb&eacute; put in
cheerily. "This state of things cannot last. It will not last. I
believe in God, and He will soon be avenged."</p>

<p>Aurore smiled on the kindly old man and quickly wiped her eyes.
She loved Marigny and dreaded the long farewell&mdash;dreaded, even
now, going into the unknown. The priest had risen and was looking
for his hat.</p>

<p>"I don't think you had one, M. l'Abb&eacute;," Aurore said, smiling at
him through her tears.</p>

<p>But suddenly both tears and smile vanished. She looked
frightened. Her eyes dilated, her cheeks became the colour of
ashes.</p>

<p>"What was that?" she murmured hoarsely.</p>

<p>"What, my dear?"</p>

<p>"What is it, Aurore?" Monseigneur asked frowning.</p>

<p>She seemed to be listening and put up her hand with her finger
pointed towards the window.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear?" she whispered.</p>

<p>Both the men shook their heads. She tiptoed to the window and
softly pushed aside the curtain. Again she listened. The two men
remained silent, for she had put her finger to her lips. But no
sound came from outside, and after a little while Aurore allowed
the curtain to fall back in its place. She still looked very white,
and her knees appeared to be shaking under her, for she sank into a
chair.</p>

<p>"But what was it, Aurore?" her father asked.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a sound," she murmured, "just outside the
window, as if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As if what?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. As if someone had been
there&mdash;listenening."</p>

<p>"It was Talon's footsteps you heard going across the
forecourt."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she admitted reluctantly, and once more tried to
smile.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; had finally turned to go.</p>

<p>"You are going, M. l'Abb&eacute;?" she asked, trying to speak calmly,
though her lips were still quivering and bloodless.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my child. I'll go home now and prepare
everything."</p>

<p>"Prepare what, M. l'Abb&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"To celebrate for you both," the old priest replied with fervent
earnestness. "The church will be quite ready for you directly you
pull up. You will tell the driver to stop at the churchyard gate. I
will say Mass and give you both Holy Communion. After that, you can
go on your long journey fortified by God's blessing. Now, if
there's anything else I can do..."</p>

<p>Monseigneur also had risen. In spite of his vaunted
self-possession, he, too, was feeling keenly the separation from
his ancestral home. He felt that in going away from Marigny, in
joining the large crowd of &eacute;migr&eacute;s who had turned their backs on
their country and found refuge in foreign lands, he would leave
behind him something of his pride of caste, something of his
dignity, something subtle and indefinable which, even if he came
back one day, he would never again recapture. The old priest no
doubt knew what went on in the heart and mind of his old friend. He
took his leave in silence, grasping the hand which, perhaps, he
would never touch again. Aurore continued to smile as she bade him
farewell.</p>

<p>"Soon after three o'clock," she said, "we'll be outside the
church door."</p>

<p>The hand which she gave him felt cold, and her eyes still looked
dark and filled with terror. The priest patted her hand
reassuringly.</p>

<p>"There was no one, I am sure," he said, nodding in the direction
of the window. "But I'll have a good look as I go out and shoo the
malefactor away. Don't be frightened, my child. I have the feeling
that you are under the special protection of the holy angels this
night."</p>

<p>He looked so serene and so reassuring that Aurore felt
comforted. She found a candle and lighted it.</p>

<p>"I'll see you to the gate," she said.</p>

<p>Together they went out of the room, Aurore holding the candle
high above her head. As she crossed the threshold, she could not
repress a shudder: all that she had gone through that afternoon in
this great gilded room came back to her with a rush of memory.
Pierre had closed the window, but the night was no longer dark
outside. The storm clouds had drifted away, and the waning moon had
risen and tipped the treetops with her silvery light.</p>

<p>"It won't be so dark, after all," the priest remarked.</p>

<p>They had gone down the stairs and crossed the hall. The priest
opened the gate.</p>

<p>"Go back, my little Aurore," he said as he once more bade her
good-night. "You must have lots to do, and your father will be
getting anxious."</p>

<p>After he had gone she stood for a moment at the gate, watching
while the priest walked briskly across the forecourt. A soft breeze
fanned the flame of the candle, and she shielded it with her hand
so that the light fell on her face and the loose golden strands of
her hair. And suddenly she had the feeling that a pair of eyes was
watching her out of the gloom. Hastily she blew out the candle. She
was ashamed of her nervousness, for, in very truth, she was shaking
with terror, while her reason told her there was nothing to fear.
The Abb&eacute;'s serenity put her to shame, as did her father's coolness;
she tried to steel herself against this humiliating weakness, but
her teeth chattered persistently, while her head felt heavy and
hot. At last she heard Pierre's voice behind her; he came shuffling
across the hall, carrying a lantern. Aurore left him to close the
gate and ran back as fast as she could across the hall.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter 28</h2>

<p>Aurore had considerable difficulty in getting together the few
necessities which she and her father would need for their long
journey. With acting heart and burning indignation she beheld the
havoc which vandal hands had wrought in the ch&acirc;teau. Her bed had
been stripped, her clothes stolen, her father's belongings had all
been looted. Fortunately, there were attics and hidden recesses in
the old mansion where, in the days of plenty, many things had been
stowed away. With the help of Jeannette, Aurore searched for and
found dark travelling clothes for herself and her father, also some
changes of linen; and together they dragged down a couple of old
valises in which they packed the travellers' most pressing future
needs.</p>

<p>Aurore and her father did, after this, contrive to snatch a few
hours' sleep&mdash;he on the sofa, she in an armchair. At three
o'clock they were both up; washed and dressed. Half an hour later
the covered cart was at the gate.</p>

<p>Pierre and Jeannette were going as car as Val-le-Roi to assist
at the service of Holy Communion which M. le Cur&eacute; had promised to
hold in his little church. They wept copious tears while they
hoisted the valises into the cart and then climbed in, in the wake
of Monseigneur and Mademoiselle Aurore.</p>

<p>Precisely at half-past three Monseigneur le Duc de Marigny and
his daughter looked their last upon their stately home. Slowly the
cart lumbered down the wooden slope. A quarter of an hour later the
driver pulled up at the gate of the churchyard of Val-le-Roi.</p>

<p>The waning moon was low in the western sky, and over in the east
the first faint streak of dawn tinged the horizon with silver. The
little church was dimly lighted from within. Aurore jumped down
lightly from the cart, and Charles de Marigny followed. After them
came Pierre and Jeannette. The little procession thus formed went
through the gate and across the flagged path through the
churchyard.</p>

<p>They were within a few metres of the porch when a dark figure
came out of the shadow and then stood still, as if waiting for
them. Aurore gave a quickly smothered cry of alarm and clung,
trembling, to her father.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" she called in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"Only the bridegroom, citizeness," came a mocking voice in
reply, "waiting for his bride."</p>

<p>Aurore and De Marigny, numbed with terror, had come to a halt.
Neither of them felt able to move. Andr&eacute; Vallon emerged fully out
of the shadow and came a step or two nearer to them.</p>

<p>"Come, <i>ma mie</i>!" he said coolly. "The church is ready. The Cur&eacute;
waits. Shall we proceed?"</p>

<p>He put out his hand to take hers. De Marigny, shaking himself
free of his torpor, tried to interpose.</p>

<p>"Do not touch her!" he cried peremptorily.</p>

<p>But Andr&eacute; seemed not to notice him. He glanced over his
shoulder, called aloud: "Citizen Tarbot!" and calmly took Aurore's
cold, limp hand in his.</p>

<p>Then only did she perceive that there were other people here,
moving in the shadows. A man came forward. It was that awful
Tarbot.</p>

<p>"My witnesses for our wedding, <i>ma mie</i>," Andr&eacute; said coolly.
"You're servants will do for yours. Come!"</p>

<p>A small group of people had emerged from under the porch. Aurore
felt like a dumb animal, helpless in a poacher's trap. She couldn't
see her father, for those awful men were all around him, but she
heard his voice, peremptory at first, then hoarse and smothered.
She felt herself lifted off her feet and carried into the church.
The flickering tallow candles on the altar showed her the Abb&eacute;
Rosemonde on his knees with his head buried in his hands. Behind
her there was the sound of feet shuffling along the flagstones. The
voice she dreaded most in all the world whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>"You didn't think, <i>ma mie</i>, that I should be such a fool as to
let you run away?"</p>

<p>She realized then how futile had been this attempt to flee, how
she had never really believed in its possibility. Even during those
few moments of sleep she had been conscious of Fate that was both
inevitable and relentless. It was no use praying to God: God was
cruel and meant her to go through with this sacrifice. She had
thought to escape, and the trap had closed on her once more, more
firmly, more inexorably than before. All she could long for now was
her father's safety&mdash;the certainty that this awful sacrifice
would not be in vain.</p>

<p>As once before, Andr&eacute; seemed to divine her thoughts.</p>

<p>"There are friends here," he said coolly, "looking after your
father's safety. And," he added, "once the knot is tied between us,
you need have no fear whatever for him."</p>

<p>She glanced up into the face of this man whom she hated with the
intensity of a suffering martyr for a ruthless tormentor. She saw
nothing in his eyes but cruelty and mockery. She had the feeling
that, try how she might, she could not combat his will; that, like
a ferocious brute, he had marked her for his prey, and that she was
his thing, his property, the trophy of his victory not only over
her but over her kindred and her caste. Nothing but death could
ever set her free again. Were it not for her father, how gladly
would she have welcomed death, if death could have been swift and
sudden, an act of God without the agency of that brutish crowd,
whose gibes and snarls and insults still rang in her ears.</p>

<p>Through the stillness she heard a distant rumble of wheels and a
driver's call to his horses, and then her father's voice once more,
uttering that awful word "<i>Canaille!</i>"</p>

<p>In a moment she would have turned, ready to run back to him, but
Andr&eacute; had her by the wrist, and she could not move.</p>

<p>"They are taking him back to Marigny," he said drily. "He was
doing no good here and might have come to harm. When Pierre and
Jeannette have done their duty as witnesses, they can go and join
him there and serve him as they did before."</p>

<p>"Let me go with him," she pleaded involuntarily. "Give me one
more day, and I'll swear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are going to swear loyalty to me at the altar first, <i>ma
mie</i>," he rejoined lightly. "After that, we shall see."</p>

<p>He led her to the altar rails, where a couple of chairs had been
placed ready for them. Aurore followed as if she were in a trance,
hypnotized by this powerful will which dominated her and broke her
spirit. She despised herself for a coward, and yet knew that she
was, in fact, utterly helpless, caught in toils which no power on
earth could now sever until this monstrous sacrifice had been
offered up on the altar of filial devotion.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Rosemonde was already waiting for them at the rails. He
had his breviary in his hand. He had prayed to God for guidance,
and God had remained dumb. Half an hour ago Andr&eacute; Vallon had come
to him and demanded his services for his marriage with Aurore de
Marigny as the law ordained, and the priest, as a citizen of the
new Republic, was forced to obey this law which his heart
condemned.</p>

<p>Prayers and admonitions were all in vain. Even the old man could
not fail to realize that the sacrifice of Aurore was the only means
to save her life and that of her father. With heart half broken
with pity he began to read the Latin prayers which his church
prescribes for the blessing of those who desire its ministrations
when entering the bonds of matrimony.</p>

<p>"<i>Deus Israel conjugat vos</i>..."&mdash;"May the God of Israel unite
you..."</p>

<p>It would be impossible to say what went on in Aurore's heart.
She stood at the altar, mute and passive. Her lips murmured no
prayer, nor did she glance in the direction of the tall, motionless
figure by her side. She was only conscious of that intense fear of
him which at moments caused her teeth to chatter and her hair to
cling matted to her moist forehead. Close beside her Jeannette and
Pierre were weeping and mumbling, while a small crowd of village
folk&mdash;women and men&mdash;clustered around the bridegroom.</p>

<p>Surely a more strange pair never stood before God's altar for
such a purpose. Victim and tormentor, with hearts overflowing with
resentment and bitterness. To Andr&eacute; the Latin words, the Gospel,
the Creed, the Offertory prayers seemed like sounds out of
dreamland, phrases belonging to the land of memory, to a land which
he had not visited since boyhood and which seemed divided from the
present by an ocean of injustice and wrong.</p>

<p>Anon the Abb&eacute; Rosemonde came down the altar steps. He had a
small plate in his hand which, as he arrived at the rails, he held
out to the bridegroom. Andr&eacute; sought in the pocket of his coat for
the two gold circlets which in the midnight hour he had taken off
his dead mother's fingers. Her wedding ring and that of his father,
dead when he, Andr&eacute;, was still a baby. She was lying so still, so
still in her ruined cottage, with a peaceful smile around her lips.
What Andr&eacute; had thought and felt when he knelt down beside her and
forced those stark fingers to yield up those tiny gold emblems of a
happy union he himself scarcely knew. All that he remembered
afterwards was that bitterness seemed for the moment to give way in
his heart to the immense sorrow in which he had not yet been able
to indulge. Just for those few moments he felt free to give rein to
tears. There was no one there to see him, no one to pity him or,
perchance, to mock. And now, when he took the rings out of his
pocket and put them on the plate, it was only by the greatest
effort of will that he choked back those tears which again rose
insistent to his eyes.</p>

<p>A sound like a long sigh came to Aurore's ears. She heeded it
not, did not know whence it came. She was staring&mdash;staring at
those two gold circlets, the material presentment of what her
self-immolation would mean for the rest of her life. Jeannette and
Pierre were sobbing audibly; the crowd of village folk were down on
their knees, trying to recollect forgotten orisons.</p>

<p>Abb&eacute; Rosemonde took the small, cold white hand and the other,
strong and rough, and placed one within the other. Aurore felt a
shudder pass through her body; every drop of blood fled from her
cheeks and gushed back to her head, and Andr&eacute; felt her hand in his,
fluttering like the wings of a captive bird.</p>

<p>With a steady hand he slipped the ring upon Aurore's finger and
in the clear voice echoed the Latin words murmured by the old Cur&eacute;.
They were the old familiar words, heard so often at the weddings of
friends, a good deal about love, something about sickness and
death. Then came Aurore's turn. The crowd of village folk craned
their necks to see what she would do. Would she recoil at the last
moment in the face of the magnitude of the sacrifice? There were
women there who vaguely understood what went on in her soul and who
marvelled if at the last she would rebel. But with a mighty effort
of will Aurore held herself erect and did not flinch. Something had
occurred during the past quarter of an hour while she knelt at the
alter rails which gave her the strength to go through with this
holocaust of herself until the end. Perhaps it was a retrospective
vision of what she had endured yesterday, of the outrage from which
she had been rescued by the man beside her, of her father's
arrogance and madness which had brought all those horrors about.
Certain it is that she did not flinch, not even when she in turn
echoed the words murmured by the Cur&eacute;. She murmured the Latin words
not understanding them altogether, and the Abb&eacute; Rosemonde in the
simplicity of his heart barely mumbled those wherein she should
have sworn to cherish her tyrant, the cruel wrecker of her
happiness.</p>

<p>Soon it was all over. Andr&eacute; Vallon, the demagogue, the child of
this bloody revolution, was the lawful lord and master of Aurore de
Marigny, the descendant of kings. The village folk gave a sigh of
satisfaction. They felt that now they were the equals of those
great people up in Paris whose will was law, whose voice was the
voice of God. Abb&eacute; Rosemonde whispered a few last words in Aurore's
ears. He placed his hand in reverent benediction upon her head.
Andr&eacute; stood by, obviously impatient. His friends pressed round him
and tried to grasp his hand. The women wept, why they knew not.
Through the coloured window glass the dawn was creeping in, and the
tallow candles on the altar flickered more and more dimly.</p>

<p>"You will be kind to her, Andr&eacute;," were the last words the good
priest spoke before he left the sanctuary.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; gave an impatient shrug.</p>

<p>"Come, <i>ma mie</i>," he said Curtly, and with his habitual peremptory
gesture he put his arm round Aurore's waist and led her out of the
church.</p>

<p>The waning moon was nothing now but a half circle of filmy white
vapour. Out in the east a July dawn had already set the fires of
heaven alight. The horizon was aglow with crimson and gold, with
emerald and chrysoprase, and tiny fleecy clouds, blood red and
splendent, lay like streaks of flame across the sky.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>Book III</h2>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>

<p>When Aurore awakened from a long dreamless sleep it was evening.
She was lying in a bed, the soft whit sheets of which smelt of
dried roses and lavender. Facing her were two tall windows masked
by delicate lace curtains through which the light of a street lamp
came dimly peeping.</p>

<p>For a long time she lay here, with aching head buried in the
sweet-smelling downy pillow, while, one by one, the events of this
fateful day came back to her mind on the wings of memory.</p>

<p>The market cart. The last glimpse of the old home. The little
church of Val-le-Roi. The figure that came out of the shadows. The
bridegroom awaiting his bride. After that there was something of a
bank, a veil through which floated the figure of Abb&eacute; Rosemonde,
the altar, the flickering tallow candles, and a dark face with
compelling eyes and cruel, mocking mouth. Spirit voices echoed
words which her ears at the time had only vaguely heard.</p>

<p>"<i>Deus Israel conjugat vos</i>..."</p>

<p>"You are going to swear loyalty to me first, <i>ma mie</i>..."</p>

<p>"Wilt thou take this man to be thy lawful husband?..."</p>

<p>"Once the knot is tied between us you need no longer
fear..."</p>

<p>Then the ring upon her finger. Jeannette's weeping farewells.
The murmurings of the village folk. The carriole outside the
churchyard gate. The long drive in silence, with her eyes fixed on
the strong brown hand close to her which handled the reins and the
whip&mdash;the hand of Andr&eacute; Vallon, her husband!</p>

<p>Yes, it all came back now! She had slept for awhile and had
mercifully forgotten, but now it all came back. After the
interminable drive in the carriole over the jolting roads they had
reached Nevers when the sun was already high in the heavens. In the
fields just outside the town there was a stretch of ripening corn,
from which a lark suddenly rose with joyful song up to the sky.</p>

<p>The carriole came to a halt in a nice broad street outside a
house, the door of which bore on a metal plate the names JULES
MIGNET and below it DOCTEUR EN MED&Eacute;CIN. Andr&eacute; put up his whip,
threw the reins over the horses' backs, and jumped lightly down
from the carriole.</p>

<p>"Come, <i>ma mie</i>," he said, and held out his arm to help her
descend.</p>

<p>In answer to the clanging of a bell, a neatly dressed maid
opened the door and greet Andr&eacute; with a smile.</p>

<p>"The Citizen Doctor?" Andr&eacute; asked. "Is he in?"</p>

<p>"He is busy at the hospital just now," the girl replied, "but
the Citizeness is upstairs."</p>

<p>The small paved hall and stone staircase smelt of ripe apples
and of soap. Andr&eacute; ran up the stairs. This time he didn't say,
"Come!" but Aurore nevertheless followed. She had no longer any
will of her own. It seemed as if that strong brown hand was driving
her with whip and reins as it had done the two horses in the
carriole.</p>

<p>Double doors on the first landing were wide open, as Andr&eacute;'s
firm footsteps rang out on the tiled floor an elderly woman came
out of the room beyond. She was small and frail-looking and had
slender white hands which she held out to Andr&eacute; with the
friendliest of greetings.</p>

<p>"Had a good journey?" she asked.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; kissed her hand and then stood aside, disclosing
Aurore.</p>

<p>"And that is your young wife!" the old woman exclaimed, and this
time her two arms extended towards Aurore, and a sweet smile lit up
her pale wrinkled face. "You are right welcome, citizeness," she
said. And Aurore felt two kindly arms encircling her shoulders and
a friendly kiss pressed on both her cheeks.</p>

<p>"This is the Citizeness Mignet, <i>ma mie</i>," Andr&eacute; said. "A dear,
kind friend who has offered us hospitality until we can continue
our journey to Paris."</p>

<p>"For as long as you will stay in my house, my dear," the old
lady said, fondling Aurore's hand but gazing on Andr&eacute; with eyes
full of deep affection. "I don't suppose he ever told you, but your
husband saved my son's life at Valmy. He lost his arm while he
carried him to safety under the fire of Prussian cannon. Not only
my house, but all I possess in the world is his and yours for the
asking."</p>

<p>But while she spoke Andr&eacute; had made good his escape. Aurore heard
him clattering down the stairs.</p>

<p>"He is always like that," the old lady said, with her gentle
smile. "He can't bear me to say a word about what we owe him, Jules
and I. But one day when Andr&eacute; is not there my son shall tell you
about it, and you will be prouder of your handsome husband than you
ever were before."</p>

<p>"But you are tired, my dear," she went on, "and here I am
chattering away instead of looking after you. Come and sit down
here in the sunshine while I get you a nice cup of hot coffee, or
would you rather have some nice sweet chocolate?"</p>

<p>She led Aurore to an armchair placed by the window, through
which the warm July sun came in smiling. Aurore thanked her with a
wan smile, and she was not really tired and that she would prefer
coffee, whereupon the old lady tripped out of the room.</p>

<p>And Aurore had remained sitting there with the sunshine
caressing her hair and cheek, looking about her as in a dream. The
room had not a great deal of furniture in it, but the few pieces
that were there revealed a fastidious taste. Fine work of the Louis
XIV period was displayed in a splendid bureau and a fine Boulle
table, in the Aubusson carpet and tapestried chairs. There were two
or three pictures on the wall which suggested the fantastic brush
of Lancret, and above the fireplace a delicate mirror which must
have hailed from Venice.</p>

<p>Aurore had the feeling that this could not be reality; that this
was some kind of dreamland out of which she would presently emerge
fully awake. Did people who were country doctors and bourgeois
possess Boulle furniture and Lancret pictures? Of course not. At
least, Aurore had never supposed that they did. Louis XIV bureaus
and Aubusson carpets were to be found in ancestral ch&acirc;teaux and not
in the plebeian houses of small provincial towns. And this old
lady, who now came tripping back in her dress of soft gray silk
with the exquisite lace fichu round her shoulders and beautiful cap
covering her gray hair, she of a certainty was not the mother of an
obscure country leech, the sort of man who, if he had been called
in to attend a sick person at Marigny in the olden days, would not
have been admitted to eat at Monseigneur's table. "Citizeness
Mignet!" That awful word "citizeness," which had the power to
arouse the most bitter resentment in the heart of every aristocrat,
could surely not be applied to her.</p>

<p>She held in her fine which hands a cup of exquisite S&egrave;vres china
from which arose the delicious scent of steaming Mocha. Aurore took
the cup with a grateful if pale little smile. She drank the coffee
eagerly and felt a little better after it. Only with half an ear
did she listen to the old lady's pleasant chatter, out of which
only a few disjointed sentences penetrator to her inner
consciousness.</p>

<p>"Your room is quite ready, my dear...I shall take an old woman's
privilege and call you Aurore...When you wake up in the
morning...How proud you must be of your husband...Prodigies of
valour at Valmy...My son says..."</p>

<p>Surely, surely, none of that could be real! The old lady was
just one of those fairies of which Aurore had read when she was a
child in the books of M. Perrault&mdash;the fairy godmother in
"Cinderella" or "The Sleeping Beauty." She would vanish presently,
and she, Aurore, would wake to find herself back in her bed with
the blue damask curtains in her room at Marigny. Dear, dear
Maringy!</p>

<p>Nor was the gold ring on her finger real. There was no such
person as Andr&eacute; Vallon, who had dared to call her "<i>ma mie</i>" and
looked down on her with such a cruel, mocking glance. She gazed
down on her own hands, her left hand with that narrow gold circlet
round the fourth finger; and oddly, with her right hand, she toyed
with the ring, twisting it round and round.</p>

<p>"And now I shall take you to your room," the old lady said in
her smooth, gentle voice. "Come with me, my dear."</p>

<p>She smiled, and her old eyes twinkled as she gave Aurore's
cheeks a little pat. "You will want to be alone with your husband,"
she said.</p>

<p>And now, after all those hours, and lying on this sweet-scented
bed, Aurore supposed that she did then follow the old lady out of
the room and up some stairs. But of that she remember nothing. She
did not even recall her first impression of this room with the tall
windows veiled behind delicate lace curtains and hangings of rose
Du Barry damask. Here again memory registered a blank until the
moment when Andr&eacute; Vallon came into the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>Chapter 30</h2>

<p>Memory can be terribly cruel!</p>

<p>Aurore, lying numb and tired after a few hours' heavy sleep,
felt the full force of this cruelty.</p>

<p>One by one, pictures which she would long all her life to blot
out from her mind rose before her aching senses. Visions of shame
and of cowardice which she felt would forever after leave a stain
upon her soul. Even now memory most cruel brought the blush of
humbled pride to her cheeks.</p>

<p>She, Aurore de Marigny, daughter of one of the proudest houses
in France, claiming kinship with Royalty, the apple of her father's
eyes, the worshipped mistress of a regal ancestral home, she had
grovelled at a plebeian's feet; on her knees she had begged him to
set her free, entreated him with words that in the past she would
only have spoken to her King.</p>

<p>She had begged him, on her knees, with hands clinging to his
rough clothes, to let her go back to Marigny and to her father;
begged him to look on his vengeance as complete, since he had
broken her spirit and humiliated her so that she would never dare
look one of her own caste in the face again.</p>

<p>And memory mocked her with that picture of herself, lying like a
crumpled heap of silk and laces at the feet of the man whom she
hated and loathed and despised beyond what she would have thought
herself capable of feeling. And through it all he had remained
cool, sarcastic, indifferent.</p>

<p>"Do not cry, <i>ma mie</i>," he had said once: "you will make your eyes
red."</p>

<p>And another time: "In Heaven's name, do not raise your voice.
You don't want our friends down below to know that we have already
embarked on matrimonial quarrels."</p>

<p>But the words that memory recalled more insistently were more
fateful than all:</p>

<p>"While you are my submissive wife no one dare touch your father
or you; but if you choose to leave me, no power on earth will save
either of you from the guillotine. I care naught," he added
presently, "about that arrogant father of yours: let him die a
dog's death, for aught I care, but I do not choose to see my wife's
pretty head roll into the same basket as those of the enemies of
France."</p>

<p>"I hate you," she had murmured once. "I shall always hate
you."</p>

<p>"I have no love for you, either," he had retorted coolly, "but
we shall get used to each other."</p>

<p>And when in her agony of mind she had cried out, "Why&mdash;why
have you done this? You hate me, you say&mdash;then why not let me
go?"</p>

<p>"Because..." The word had escaped him, vehement and fierce; the
cruel expression she had learned to fear had flashed for a few
seconds out of his eyes. But the next moment he pulled himself
together, seemed, indeed, to shed his fury like a mantle. A mocking
smile chased away the ferocious glance, and he said lightly:</p>

<p>"Because you are beautiful, <i>ma mie</i>; you are my wife and I wish
to keep you. That is all."</p>

<p>In the olden days Aurore de Marigny, even when she was little
more than a child, had been wont to despise the airs and graces,
the megrims and mild hysterics in which her elegant friends so
often indulged. She had always been a fearless child: at games, on
horseback, nothing frightened her. In an age when women affected
the weaknesses of their sex as a sign of aristocratic birth, she
would find joy in breaking in an untamed colt or accompanying her
father in his shooting expeditions after wolf or wild boar in the
forests of Ardennes. She had never known fear until now, when a
beggarly caitiff held her like a slave in thrall. But with memory's
cruel insistence there came back to her the knowledge that she was
afraid; that there was one man in the world the sight of whom
caused a quiver of abject fear to go right through her body, the
sound of whose footfall caused every drop of blood to flow back to
her heart. Why, she couldn't say.</p>

<p>It was that despicable fear which at this fateful hour had taken
such hold of her that, even while his formidable arm encircled her
waist and raised her from the ground where she had been cowering
like a frightened beast, her senses suddenly forsook her, her head
fell back, her teeth chattered as if in ague, her limbs felt as
cold as ice. Broken and bruised by the terrible mental and physical
struggle, she was numb and limp, had not one spark of fight left in
her, or the strength of a kitten. She felt herself lifted off the
ground and laid down somewhere, where it was soft and warm and
sweet smelling. She heard the dreaded footfall receding from her,
the opening of a door, and then a call.</p>

<p>There were other people in the room presently&mdash;a man and a
woman. Aurore couldn't see them; she had not the energy to raise
her eyelids; but gentle kindly hands undressed her, took off her
shoes and stockings, combed her hair and moistened her face with
sweet-smelling water. She felt herself being tucked up in a soft
downy bed, and soft murmurs that sounded pitiful and motherly
soothed her throbbing senses.</p>

<p>A man's voice, persuasive and authoritative, said, "Try and
drink this, citizeness, it will make you sleep." She obeyed and
drank the slightly bitter liquid that was held to her lips. After
that she lay placid and quiet and, presently, must have dropped off
to sleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>Chapter 31</h2>

<p>The stay in Nevers was made endurable for Aurore through the
absence of her husband.</p>

<p>Her husband!</p>

<p>The Mignets explained to her that Andr&eacute; had left for Paris on
the very day of their arrival, while she was lying asleep. He
wouldn't have her disturbed. He had gone in order to make
arrangements for their new home, and he had gone full of joy and
hope, because Citizen Danton had sent a courier over from Paris
confirming the happy tidings already sent to Val-le-Roi a few days
ago, that he would be overjoyed to see his old friend and colleague
Andr&eacute; Vallon again. There was work and to spare for young hands and
young brains who had the welfare of the people at heart. The
education of the young and the reclaiming of the unfit were the two
questions that occupied the minds of the committees at the present
moment, and Danton held out hopes of an important post for Andr&eacute; in
connection with these questions.</p>

<p>"It is the sort of work that will appeal to your clever husband,
citizeness," the Doctor said, "now that the loss of his arm has
compelled him to leave the army. The illiterates in France have
been reckoned by the million in the past. Whatever else the present
great upheaval may do, it will certainly remedy that crying
evil."</p>

<p>"They are opening schools all over France," the old lady
continued, "not only for the young, but also for the afflicted: the
deaf and dumb and the blind."</p>

<p>"Schools?" Aurore remarked with a slight lifting of the
eyebrows. "To teach what?"</p>

<p>"The elements of education," Madame Mignet replied quietly.
"These must no longer remain the privilege of the few."</p>

<p>"And is my&mdash;my husband taking a hand in this scheme of
education for the million?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes," the Doctor said. "I understand that Citizen
Danton has obtained an important post for him in connection with
the schools for the blind."</p>

<p>"Citizen Danton is the most influential man in France," Madame
Mignet went on to explain to the somewhat bewildered Aurore. "He
has a charming young wife. Madame Roland is one of their intimate
friends. You and your husband will move among the most brilliant
and most intellectual society in Paris."</p>

<p>Aurore was indeed bewildered. She gazed on this
fastidious-looking old lady with the aristocratic features and
delicate hands, who talked so calmly of Danton, the hideous master
butcher of this awful slaughterhouse, the man whose large plebeian
hands were stained with the blood of hundreds of his fellow men.
Madame Mignet, or Citizeness Mignet as she preferred to be called,
could talk of that man and his circle as "intellectual" and
"brilliant," and took it for granted that she, Aurore, daughter of
Monseigneur le Duc de Marigny, would find pleasure in their
society. Pleasure? Aurore could only marvel whether she would have
sufficient courage to show her horror and loathing should the hands
of those butchers be extended in friendly welcome to her.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible that people like the Mignets should look
complacently on the wholesale butcheries which were turning the
fair city of Paris into a shambles; that they could condone the
hideous crime of regicide about to culminate in the still more
deadly sin of the execution of the Queen; that they could utter
such names as Danton or Robespierre, Carrier or Desmoulins without
a shudder. And when, after a few days of quiet intimacy, Aurore
ventured to put the question to Madame Mignet, the old lady replied
with strange earnestness:</p>

<p>"My dear, since the beginning of all times men have perpetrated
horrors against one another. It is the devil in them, but the devil
would have no power over men if God did not allow it. Could He not,
if He so willed, quell this revolution with His Word? Must we not
rather bow to His will and try to realize that something great,
something good, something, at any rate, that is in accordance with
the great scheme of the universe must in the end come out of all
this sorrow?"</p>

<p>"But, surely," Aurore protested, "you must look with horror on
these wholesale murders."</p>

<p>"I look with horror on every act of violence committed by man
against his fellow creatures. I look with horror on every war where
men are trained and encouraged to kill or maim one another. I look
with horror upon the slave owners in our colonies, where men drive
their fellow creatures with whip lash and torture to toil so that
they themselves may reap. All these, my dear child, are horrors
which we women condemn and shudder at. But wars there will always
be, because man will always defend his property against aggression,
and there will be revolutions in this world so long as men use
their power in order to enslave others."</p>

<p>Aurore hotly defended her caste. On her father's estate the
people were content and prosperous.</p>

<p>"I am sure they were," Madame Mignet admitted, with an indulgent
smile, "but throughout the history of the world, the innocent have
suffered together with the guilty. Great evils need desperate
remedies. The children of France, egged on by centuries of misery
and spurred by starvation, have struck blindly about them in their
scramble for food. In the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e noble heads have fallen along with
some that were heavy with guilt. But it is God's will, and we must
have patience. France is a great and glorious country. This is the
period of her travail. From it she will bring forth liberty and
progress which, as the years roll on, will cause her children to
forget what they have endured in the cause."</p>

<p>It was amazing to hear a woman of refinement talk so placidly
about it all. In fact, Aurore could not help remarking to herself
how strangely like this old lady's philosophy of life was that of
Abb&eacute; Rosemonde. Resignation to the will of God. Contentment in
leaving everything in His hands. She felt a kind of mild contempt
for this placidity, and yet, what right had she to scorn anyone?
She, the miserable coward who shrank from the hurt that her
father's death would cause her, and to save herself and him had
grovelled at the feet of one whom she despised?</p>

<p>But it was only toward the end of her stay at Nevers that she
spoke of all this to Madame Mignet. She wondered how much of her
history the old lady and the Doctor knew; if they realized that as
far as she was concerned the greatest horror she had ever
experienced was when she found herself the wife of one whom her
father had so justly dubbed "<i>Canaille!</i>" They, of course, would not
understand how her entire being was in revolt against this slavery.
Andr&eacute; Vallon was admittedly a poor man, which would mean that she,
Aurore de Marigny, would be little better than a servant to a
despicable knave. Ignorant of the commonest elements of household
work, she would be a constant suffering victim to his gibes and his
tyranny. But it was not the work that she feared, it was the
mental, the moral, the physical contact with one whom she
hated.</p>

<p>And all the while that she was at Nevers, her ears were
constantly filled with his name. Though absent, he seemed always to
be there in this home of culture and refinement, as he was ever
present apparently in the hearts of his friends. From beginning to
end, Aurore was forced to listen to the story of Andr&eacute;'s heroism
when he carried Doctor Mignet on his back out of range of the
Prussian cannon; how a chance musket shot had shattered his arm and
he had dragged himself and his swooning comrade back to the French
lines, only to return to the scene of danger and bring to safety
half a dozen more of his wounded comrades until, stricken with a
raging fever, more dead than alive, he in his turn had completely
lost consciousness.</p>

<p>With a wealth of detail and a plethora of exciting incidents did
Doctor Mignet recount not only this story, but others in which
Andr&eacute; Vallon was the hero and had accomplished prodigies of
valour.</p>

<p>"Four citations, citizeness," he said with undisguised
enthusiasm. "Dumouriez, before his abominable treachery, always
spoke of Vallon as the bravest soldier he had ever had under his
command; and when the crash came, when Dumouriez, whom the whole of
France trusted as an able general and a loyal patriot, when he sold
his sword to the enemies of his country, Vallon was one of those
who put heart into the troops, who revived their courage and led
them to a series of victories which culminated in that glorious day
of Valmy."</p>

<p>And the old lady would then conclude with a happy little
sigh:</p>

<p>"Indeed, citizeness, Andr&eacute; is a man to be proud of as a husband
and as a friend."</p>

<p>And Aurore wondered if all those stories could possibly be true.
Valour, loyalty, selflessness, these were the attributes of her
caste. Caitiffs like Andr&eacute; Vallon surely were not capable of such
noble impulses. They had no educations to guide them, no tradition,
none of the examples which formed the glorious history of a noble
race such as hers. It couldn't be true. The whole thing was an
exaggeration on the Doctor's part. He was blinded by his affection
for a comrade in arms, by dangers passed together, by suffering
endured for the sake of France, when the whole of Europe raised its
hand against her, and the Prussian hordes invaded her sacred
soil.</p>

<p>"I look with horror on every war," the old lady had said. And
for the first time in all these miserable years Aurore was
conscious of a vague feeling of shame that so many of her kindred
had turned their sword against their country in the hour of her
greatest peril, or sought refuge and safety on foreign soil.</p>

<p>"France, my country!" an unconscious poet had once sung. "She
may have erred, she may have sinned, but still she is my
country!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>Chapter 32</h2>

<p>Indeed, these few days in Nevers in the company of two charming
and intellectual people were both pleasant and peaceful. It was
years since Aurore had the opportunity of listening to conversation
other than the somewhat na&iuml;ve philosophy of Abb&eacute; Rosemonde and her
father's somewhat monotonous if fully justified diatribes against
the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i>; and though she felt that she could never agree with
the opinions and ideals expounded so eloquently by the Mignets, yet
she could not help feeling interested, taken out of herself, made
to feel that at any rate the original makers of this terrible
revolution were men of high ideals actuated by the purest of
motives.</p>

<p>The day of departure came, alas! all too soon. Andr&eacute; came to
Nevers to fetch his wife. The sight of him revived in Aurore's
memory all the terrible times she had lived through. All the
quietude of the past few days seemed to fly from her soul At once
she felt irritated, with her nerves all tingling and on edge. She
watched the carriage drive up to the door and saw him jump down and
take his valise from the driver. She thought he looked ill, but
supposed that perhaps the journey had been trying. It was only
later that she heard that he had actually come from Val-le-Roi,
whither he had gone first from Paris in order to see after his
mother's grave in the churchyard there.</p>

<p>It was not till late afternoon that Aurore found herself along
in her room with her husband. She certainly thought that he looked
different, somehow: older perhaps, but certainly different. He had
been to Marigny and spoke to her about his visit there.</p>

<p>"Your father refused to see me," he told her, "which I suppose
was natural. But I questioned Pierre and Jeannette and also the
Citizen Cur&eacute;. They all told me that physically he was well, but not
quite normal in his mind."</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!..."</p>

<p>"It is nothing to be alarmed about. I spoke to the leech-Citizen
Journet&mdash;whom you know. They used to call him in the olden
days if any of the servants were sick. Your father, it seems,
condescended to let him feel his pulse and to take the potion which
he prescribed."</p>

<p>"If I could only see him..."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't do him any good. On the contrary, if you were
there he would let loose the floodgates of his resentment and work
himself up into a delirium of fury. I put the question to the
Citizen Doctor and Abb&eacute; Rosemonde: they both thought it best that
he should be kept very quiet for a time, under the care of Pierre
and Jeannette."</p>

<p>"You seem to have been very kind," she said, feeling grateful
yet loth to acknowledge her gratitude.</p>

<p>"Only seemingly," he replied lightly, in that flippant, mocking
tone of his which still had the power to irritate her. However, she
kept sufficient control over herself for the moment to swallow the
sharp retort which hovered on her lips.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence between them, and then he mentioned
Talon.</p>

<p>"I have got the deeds of sale out of that thief, at any rate,"
he said.</p>

<p>"The deeds?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes! The deeds of sale of Marigny and of all the estates
registered in your father's name to Hector Talon."</p>

<p>"I had forgotten," she murmured.</p>

<p>"He hadn't," Andr&eacute; replied drily, "not your father's."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"That I had the title deeds registered in your name, under the
plea that your father was non compos mentis."</p>

<p>"But I couldn't allow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I should be defrauding my father."</p>

<p>"Would you rather Talon had possession?"</p>

<p>"Rather he than you," she retorted coldly.</p>

<p>At the moment she hoped, rather than thought, that a slight
shadow passed over his face. They had both been standing during
this brief conversation, carried on with a kind of casual
indifference on his side and with thinly veiled animosity on hers.
She had intended to wound him with the sharpness of her tongue, and
having, as she hoped, succeeded, she turned coolly away from him
and sat down in the winged armchair by the window. With
ostentatious care she disposed the folds of her gown about her,
fiddled at her fichu, allowed her daintily shod foot to peep from
beneath her skirt. Then she took up a piece of embroidery and
started to ply her needle with the appearance of being deeply
engrossed in her work.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; watched her in silence for a moment or two. Had she looked
up she would have seen the mocking smile which curled round his
lips.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said after a while, "that my wits are specially
dull this afternoon. Would you be so gracious as to explain just
what you mean by 'rather he than you'? It sounds enigmatic to
me."</p>

<p>Aurore kept her eyes fixed on her embroidery frame, drawing the
thread in and out as if the destinies of France rested on the
success of her work. With her head slightly tilted to one side, her
fair hair free from powder, like a golden halo above her smooth
forehead, a look of concentration in her deep blue eyes, she looked
perfectly adorable. She knew it, and felt a great measure of
strength in the knowledge. A woman is soon conscious of victory
when she knows that she is beautiful, and Aurore, young and
inexperienced as she was, was no exception to this rule. What
worried her was that she could not keep her hands entirely steady
or still the beatings of her heart. She knew that if she spoke her
voice would betray the fact that she was vaguely frightened. She
had hit out rather blindly and thoughtlessly because his cool
indifference had exasperated her, but now she was afraid of what he
might do. He was cruel and vengeful, she knew that, and she felt
frightened, like a child who has been naughty and knows that it is
going to be punished.</p>

<p>But she would not for worlds let him see that she was anything
but indifferent, and so she remained silent and went on drawing her
embroidery thread in and out with cool ostentation. But, suddenly,
and without any warning, he came up close to her and, with an
impatient oath, snatched the work out of her hand and threw it on
the ground.</p>

<p>"Please answer my question," he said coldly.</p>

<p>The needle, it seemed, had slightly grazed her finger, drawing a
drop of blood. She put the finger to her mouth. Then she rose from
her chair and stooped to pick up her work. He put his foot on it.
As she straightened again she found herself quite close to him,
looking up into his face.</p>

<p>"I meant just what I said," she said, as coolly as she could,
though she felt that her nerves were beginning to give way; "that I
would sooner any man in the whole of France had Marigny rather than
you."</p>

<p>"A very natural sentiment on your part, no doubt," he rejoined
calmly, "seeing that you honour me with such active hatred. But had
you equally honoured me by listening to me just now you would have
heard me say that the title deeds of Marigny are not inscribed in
my name but in yours."</p>

<p>She broke into a harsh, derisive laugh.</p>

<p>"A pretty bit of sophistry, forsooth," she retorted. "You must
think me a food, indeed, if you imagine I do not see through your
tricks. A marriage with the aristo, <i>pardi</i>! to humiliate her, what?
and to avenge wrongs in which she had no share? Your precious
friends believe that tale, do they not? But they are the fools, not
I. I know enough of the laws of your murdering government. A wife's
property belongs to her husband, and that is the reason why you
forced this monstrous union upon me. It was in order to feather
your nest, to obtain possession of the lands and ch&acirc;teau which if
my dear father and I had perished on the guillotine would have
become the property of the State. Marry the aristocrat, forsooth,
to avenge a mother's death! <i>Par Dieu!</i> 'twas a pretty story to cover
the grasping avarice of an upstart out for loot!"</p>

<p>She had succeeded in working herself up into a state of
uncontrolled fury. Fear had given way to a kind of nervous
exultation at her own power to wound. All unknowing, he had put the
flail in her hand wherewith to chastise him. And chastise she did.
Whether she believed in what she said or no didn't seem to matter:
all she knew was that her words must hurt him. They must, even
though he stood there close to her, entirely motionless, looking
down into her glowing face with eyes the expression of which she
could not entirely fathom. But that was because she was excited,
unable to reason and to think, only to strike with words that must
hit at what pride he possessed, as a whip lash would have struck at
his face. It was only when she was forced to pause in order to draw
breath that that awful mocking smile which she hated worse than his
cruelty curled once more around his lips.</p>

<p>This goaded her beyond endurance. Her nerves were completely
unstrung. She couldn't have controlled them even if she would. She
was just longing for an actual whip wherewith to strike, longing
with all her soul to make him cringe and suffer at last as he had
so often made her suffer.</p>

<p>With a strange cry, as much of pain as of triumph, she suddenly
raised her hand and strike him in the face...</p>

<p>"You little fool!"</p>

<p>That was what she heard. The voice did not sound quite like his.
Perhaps she had expected a roar, a cry of rage, a savage
oath&mdash;he was a beast, and beast usually bellowed when they
were hurt; but all she did hear was a low, contemptuous laugh and
those three words, "You little fool!"</p>

<p>But what happened was quite another matter. His formidable arm
shot out, and in an instant both her wrists were tightly held
together as in a manacle of steel. She felt as if her arms were
wrenched out of their sockets, and in the agony of it her knees
gave way under her. She felt herself sinking to the ground, and
through a mist of semiconsciousness she saw his face quite close to
hers&mdash;a cruel, mocking face with a gleam of ferocity in the
eyes.</p>

<p>"On your knees, you little fool!"</p>

<p>What a harsh voice it had become! And then that laugh! Mockery!
Contempt! Mild amusement! The whole gamut of what was most
humiliating and most riling.</p>

<p>"Let go my wrists," she said as steadily as she could, though
she was ready to cry with pain. "Let go! You hurt me!"</p>

<p>"Hurt you?" he went on coolly. "By God! I mean to hurt you, you
infuriating little vixen! I am going to keep you here on your knees
until those red lips of yours have begged for pardon."</p>

<p>"Let me go!" she cried aloud. "Brute! Brute! Let me go!"</p>

<p>"As soon as you have begged for pardon!" he retorted grimly.</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"We shall see!"</p>

<p>He sat down in the winged chair and still held her by the
wrists. She was on her knees, crouching at his feet, for there he
held her pinioned with one foot on the edge of her gown. She could
not move.</p>

<p>"Coward! Let me go!"</p>

<p>"Not I! Coward," he continued coolly, "is an attribute of
mudlarks such as I, but so is obstinacy you'll find, <i>ma mie</i>.
Anyway, you are going to stay here on your knees until your sweet
lips have claimed and received a kiss of forgiveness."</p>

<p>Just for a few seconds she had an uncontrollable desire to
scream at the top of her voice in the hope that some member of the
Mignet household would come to her rescue. But her pride revolted
at the idea of being found in this humiliating position, and with
all their adoration for this brutish husband of hers they might
even take his part against her, and ridicule might then be piled on
humiliation&mdash;a thing too awful to contemplate. She thought
that he would tire; those fingers of his, which felt more and more
like iron clamps around her wrists, were bound, she thought, to
loosen their hold a little after a time. Manlike, he would grow
weary of sitting still. The slightest movement on his part, and the
tension would relax. That would be her opportunity for escape, and,
of course, she would not be caught unawares again. If only she
could have closed her ears to his voice, to his gibes and his
sneers and, worse still, to this scornful admiration.</p>

<p>"So you thought out that pretty story for yourself," he said at
one time: "that I schemed to marry you in order to obtain
possession of your impoverished estates. Name of a name! you have
imagination as well as beauty, <i>ma mie</i>"; and then he added
irrelevantly:</p>

<p>"When you sue for pardon I shall kiss you, Aurore, for your lips
just now look as luscious as two cherries."</p>

<p>Involuntarily a sob rose to her throat, her pretty head fell
forward, and great hot tears fell from her eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, <i>ma mie</i>," he said gaily. "I didn't cry when that
charming cousin of yours struck me in the face just because you
happened to fall into my arms one day. I was only a boy, and you
were a child. Do you remember that day, <i>ma mie</i>?"</p>

<p>His voice seemed to die away somewhere in space. The shades of
evening were drawing in. It was quite dark in the remote corners of
the room. Aurore felt faint and sick, dreading, yet longing for,
unconsciousness. At one moment hope revived. There was a knock at
the door, and she heard Andr&eacute;'s voice calling:</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Supper is ready, citizen," came the servant girl's voice in
reply. "Will you be coming down?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night, Marie," Andr&eacute; replied. "My wife is fatigued, and
I will stay with her. Pray the Citizen Doctor and the Citizeness to
excuse us."</p>

<p>After that Aurore sobbed like a child. She was tired and hungry
and in pain. She sobbed, and through her sobs she heard the hated
voice saying quite lightly:</p>

<p>"Give in, <i>ma mie</i>. You won't regret it. If I had a hand to spare
I would put a finger under your pretty chin and try and teach you
that it is quite good to kiss."</p>

<p>She did give in, in the end. She felt ashamed, abjected,
cowardly. A brief while ago she would have scorned the idea of any
woman giving in under such humiliating conditions. But it was not
only physical pain that compelled her. It was something more than
that, and she knew it. It was the enforcement of a will greater
than her own, the absolutism of physical, moral, and mental
strength which seemed to rob her surrender of its most galling
sting. She raised her head and almost with an air of defiance she
threw out the word, "<i>Pardon!</i>" At once her wrists were released, but
her whole body was imprisoned instead. Weak and broken, with head
thrown back and eyes closed, she remained motionless in the crook
of his arm. For a long, long time she remained thus, expecting and
dreading that kiss. She felt that his eyes were on her,
revelling&mdash;she had no doubt of that&mdash;in her beauty. And
for this she hated and despised him as much as she hated and
despised herself. For one instant she opened her eyes and looked
into his. What had compelled her to open them she didn't know. It
was still that immense power which appeared to be in the very air
about her, bending her will and breaking her spirit. Had she read
fury, passion, or hatred in his eyes she might, she felt, have
forgiven him in her turn, have felt less ashamed of her cowardice;
but all she encountered was a kind of gentle, indulgent mockery,
mild amusement at what to her meant the uprooting of all that she
had held inviolate, the surrender of what she held far deeper than
life.</p>

<p>He was amused at her humiliation and could laugh at her
distress. She gave him one look and then said loudly and quite
steadily:</p>

<p>"I never knew what hatred meant until now."</p>

<p>"We'll call it that if you like," he retorted lightly, "but
isn't it good?"</p>

<p>And then he kissed her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>Chapter 33</h2>

<p>Since that day many months had gone by, and Aurore, sitting once
more in the large winged chair by the window in that pretty room at
Nevers and watching the snowflakes slowly fluttering down from the
leaden sky thought of the long, long time that separated her from
the past, and of the interminable days that still lay, wearisome
and monotonous, before her, until she was an old woman, too old to
recollect and too old to feel.</p>

<p>She had been very sorry at the time to leave the quietude of the
house at Nevers, not thinking that she would ever see it again. The
Mignets had been so kind! So king! She marvelled often just how
much they knew. She had dreaded the journey to Paris in the company
of her husband, had dreaded the life that lay before her&mdash;the
great unknown! the leap into a future which she pictured to herself
as dark and lonely and laden with sorrow.</p>

<p>But things in life have a way of not being either quite so
pleasant or so unpleasant as one anticipates; and Aurore's first
impression of the apartment in Paris which was destined to be her
home was certainly not so unpleasant as she had imagined. It
certainly was spacious and sunny. Situated on the Quai de la
Ferraille, high above the noises of the street below, it had a fine
view over the river and the towers of Notre Dame. She wondered who
it was who had presided over the furnishing of it, but didn't like
to ask. She thought that she detected a feminine hand and a woman's
taste in her bedroom, with its muslin curtains and flowered chintz
hangings. All very simple, even Spartan, but with nothing to jar on
her fastidiousness. In an adjacent small boudoir she found a
comfortable armchair, a work table, many appurtenances necessary
for needlework. These only a woman could have selected, so Aurore
thought, and wondered who it could have been.</p>

<p>There were also a number of books ranged on shelves on one side
of the room. As soon as she had an opportunity Aurore looked to see
what they were. Rousseau, of course, and Diderot, and also Voltaire
and D'Alembert; the speeches of Mirabeau and reprints of the early
numbers of <i>L'Ami du Peuple</i>. But there were others too: the poets
and essayists of the Grand Si&egrave;cle, Moli&egrave;re, Coidorcet, Bossuet, and
many more. somehow she felt that each one had been chosen specially
for the moulding of her mind. Herein she suspected her husband, and
wondered how any man could be so dense or so arrogant as to suppose
that she would swerve one iota from the principles and the faith,
which she had been taught to believe were the only possible rules
of life.</p>

<p>But apart from such rebellious thoughts and during those early
days of August, Aurore set out resolutely to live the life which
she believed was to be hers to the end of time. She wondered how
she was every going to live and to endure. And yet other people did
it; other women in this awful city of Paris had learned how to live
and how to suffer. How amazing that was! Amazing and
ununderstandable! The Reign of Terror was at its height. The
glorious revolution, which was going to regenerate the world and
bring about the millennium with unbroken happiness for all, could
now be best described as a conjugation of the verb "to fear": I
fear, thou fearest, he fears, we fear, you fear, they fear! Men and
women in Paris went daily, hourly, in fear of their lives; in fear
of the lives of those near and dear to them. Every day accusations,
trials, condemnations, and the procession of victims to the
guillotine. Terror, indeed, was the order of the day, the darlings
of the crowd to-day were the execration of the mob on the
morrow.</p>

<p>And yet, life went on just the same.</p>

<p>People walked about the streets, met each other and talked over
the events of the day&mdash;the death of this man, imminent arrest
of that other; Robespierre's latest speech; the news from the
front. They went to the theatre and the opera; they dined at
restaurants. Young people made love; old people died; babies were
born. Life went on just the same.</p>

<p>Aurore saw very little of the outside world. She went daily to
market with the pleasant middle-aged woman who helped her with her
m&eacute;nage; she stood in the queues, waiting her turn to purchase the
few ounces of bread which the law allowed, and spent the money
which Andr&eacute; had given her for the purchase of such food as was
obtainable. Her life was Spartan in the extreme, but she had no
rough task to perform. There was no question of washing and
scrubbing&mdash;the nice middle-aged woman did all that; but Aurore
soon found herself strangely interested in keeping her new home
dainty and comfortable and her table as free from monotony as
possible. The feeling gradually came to her that this was more of a
real home to her than stately Marigny had ever been. There, during
its days of splendour, everything was ordained and arranged by an
army of servants without any reference to her own special wishes.
Probably she had no special wishes in those days, as everything
went on in its own perfect routine. There was never any hitch:
housekeepers and major-domos saw to it that Mademoiselle was not
troubled with such trifles as the arrangement of flowers in her
room or the composition of a menu.</p>

<p>But here, in the sunny rooms of the Quai de la Ferraille,
everything depended on her, and the thrill was very real when there
were a few asters to be bought in the market, or there was a
possibility of obtaining a thin old fowl that made excellent
soup.</p>

<p>Aurore heard vague rumours from time to time that men in high
places kept rich tables in their homes while the people starved;
that certain restaurants in the Rue St. Honor&eacute;, patronized by
Robespierre, the Incorruptible, and his friends on the influential
committees, served their customers with the richest of food and
choice wines bought for a song from the cellars of dispossessed
aristocrats. She heard that in the country there was no shortage of
luxury; that Danton's house at Arcis was noted for its good
cheer.</p>

<p>All that she heard and more, but she had soon schooled herself
to know nothing, to listen to nothing, to comment on nothing. She
never went to a theatre; she had never set foot inside a
restaurant. She only walked for exercise, and then only in the
fields round about St. Martin and Passy. It was the only way to
endure life. Strangely enough, quite apart from the interest in her
home, she was not really unhappy. What sorrow and anxiety she felt
was purely outside herself. The fate of the unfortunate Queen
caused her immense grief, but she never spoke of it; through gossip
gleaned in the streets, or through the placards at street corners
which she could not fail to see, she learned of the condemnation
and death of many whose names had been familiar to her since
childhood: relatives, friends, acquaintances. Many she knew had
found shelter abroad, and more than once she half broke her heart
with regret that her father had always set his face so obstinately
against emigration. They would be together now&mdash;she and
he&mdash;secure in England or Belgium, with only the echo of all
these horrors to disturb their peace, instead of this daily
agonizing contact with it all.</p>

<p>She remembered that a year or less before this she had heard
rumours of an organization of English gentlemen, headed by a
mysterious chief who was known as "The Scarlet Pimpernel," who
risked their lives in order to help those who were in danger of
death, who were unhappy and innocent, and who longed to flee from
this terror-stricken land. She remembered that her father had
obstinately refused to get in touch with these gallant Englishmen.
He hated the English, he said, and would not owe his life to any of
them. Aurore, at the time, thought no more about it. She did not
hate the English, but she didn't want to leave Marigny, and in that
remote country district the danger to her father and herself did
not appear imminent.</p>

<p>Until that awful day in July, which seemed now like a nightmare,
she had no realized how hated she and her father were in the
villages, and how intense was the enmity of the people against her
caste. But here, in Paris, her eyes were soon opened to much that
she had never fully understood before: she soon realized how
miserable and ignorant the people were, and how easy it was to
arouse in them passions of hatred, of resentment and cruelty. She
also realized how helpless now were those men who, with the highest
possible ideals to spur them, and an infinite understanding of the
injustice under which the poor had groaned for centuries, had let
loose the floodgates of this titanic revolution. They were helpless
now, and, one by one, paid toll with their lives for all those
dreams of liberty and justice which were going to make this word
regenerate and happy, and only succeeded in making it more
miserable and more foul.</p>

<p>Her husband, Andr&eacute; Vallon, was one of these. He had come back
from the war full of enthusiasm and of hope. Since he could no
longer fight the enemies of his country abroad, he would fight them
within its borders: traitors, who would sell France to her foes,
who would allow the Prussian heel to tread her sacred soil;
upstarts, who filled their pockets and their bellies while others
groaned and starved. They were the enemies whom men like Andr&eacute;
Vallon were ready to denounce to an outraged people. The people
were ready enough to have those traitors thrown to them as bait for
their revenge, but, having tasted the sweets of retaliation, they
soon cried for more. And Aurore watched clouds of anxiety gather
over her husband's brow. Day by day he became more absorbed, more
silent.</p>

<p>When first they had settled down in Paris he had often talked to
her of the great upheaval which was convulsing the country: he
spoke with great moderation, careful not to outrage her principles
or her belief. He brought her books to read, pamphlets that
interested her even though they could never convince. Andr&eacute; could
talk well when he liked; he knew his Rousseau and discussed him
with Aurore in a manner which opened up her mind to social
questions of which she had never dreamed before. She was
intelligent and responsive. She had a great desire to learn, and,
in spite of herself, she caught herself more than once looking
forward to a quiet evening in the Quai de la Ferraille, <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-tet&ecirc;</i>
with her husband, listening to his talk while she worked. He would
speak very freely of the social ideals that had brought about the
Revolution, of men like Lafayette and Mirabeau, of the original
Legislative Assembly, the Constitution of '89, and the Declaration
of the Rights of Man. But it was always of the past that he spoke.
Of the present and the future he never uttered a word, and Aurore,
through innate delicacy of feeling, never mentioned the names of
those demagogues who had been Andr&eacute;'s colleagues and friends at one
time, and who had since been hurled down the steep path of enormity
and of crime by the avalanche which they had let loose and no
longer could control. She never once uttered the name of Danton,
the master butcher who had been Andr&eacute;'s friend.</p>

<p>From time to time she had news of her father, and Andr&eacute; held out
hopes to her that she would see him soon; but he never spoke again
of Marigny, though she had a strong suspicion that he was
administering the estate through an agent whom he had placed there
for the purpose.</p>

<p>Soon she had the conviction that he was taking her presence in
his home absolutely for granted. She was his wife and looked after
his comfort. Sometimes she was also a pleasant companion with whom
he could talk of extraneous subjects. He had never once set foot
inside her room.</p>

<p>He taught her to play chess, and now and then they would have a
game in the evening. The lamp, set on a tall stand behind Aurore's
chair, lit up the tender gold of her hair, the curve of her
shoulder peeping through the folds of her lace fichu, her delicate
hand supporting her chin. She was beautiful, and she knew it. But
whenever she looked up from her game she invariably saw his head
bent, intent upon the next move, and his eyes fixed upon the
board.</p>

<p>He had never once kissed her since that evening at Nevers.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>Chapter 34</h2>

<p>Towards the end of September Andr&eacute; announced to Aurore his
intention to take her to Nevers.</p>

<p>"The Mignets," he said, "will be very happy to have you with
them, and there will be a chance for you of seeing your
father."</p>

<p>A quick cry of protest came involuntarily to her lips.</p>

<p>"I would rather stay here!" she said, and then could have cried
with vexation, for at once that mocking smile which she hated came
curling around his mouth.</p>

<p>"I would not wish to burden Madame Mignet with my presence," she
went on, as coolly as she could. "I know from experience how
difficult housekeeping has become, and a visitor must be a burden
in any house."</p>

<p>"The Citizeness has been longing to see you again, she tells me,
and Paris is not the place for you just now."</p>

<p>It was not often that he assumed this air of authority over her,
but Aurore was sensible enough to know that when he did any kind of
resistance would be useless. In this great era of liberty a married
woman was still entirely dependent on her husband. She had no money
or property apart from him, and he had complete control over her
affairs and over her movements. Aurore, who had a great regard for
her own personal dignity, would never have demeaned herself by
argument or resistance which could only result in defeat.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, she knew quite well why she was being sent
out of Paris, and in her innermost heart could not help feeling
thankful that there were some kind friends with whom she could
stay, away in a quiet provincial town, until the terrible events
which were looming ahead had come about and vanished into the past.
The trial of the unfortunate Queen had been decreed by the
Convention. This, of course, would be nothing but hideous mockery
and would inevitably end in her condemnation and her death. Andr&eacute;
did not wish his wife to be in Paris when that occurred.</p>

<p>He took her over to Nevers on one of the last days in
September.</p>

<p>The drive in the diligence through the beautiful valleys of the
Ni&egrave;vre and the Allier, where the trees that bordered the road were
already clothed in the gorgeous russet and gold mantle of autumn,
was strangely soothing. More than once Aurore fell asleep in spite
of the roughness of the road, the heat inside the diligence, the
querulous murmur of conversation of her fellow passengers. When a
sudden jerk aroused her from these fitful slumbers she usually
found that in her sleep her head had fallen sideways and come to
rest on her husband's shoulder. She would look up at him, half
dazed and with a beating heart, only to find that he was sitting
bolt upright, staring straight out in front of him, and had not
apparently as much as noticed her.</p>

<p>The Mignets were, as usual, more than kind, and did all they
could to make their guest happy. But a strange restlessness now had
possession of Aurore, and the peaceful atmosphere of this refined
household seemed to irritate rather than soothe her nerves. Very
little news from Paris penetrated as far as this sleepy cathedral
town. The diligence to and from the capital only plied once a month
now, and the meagre sheets which it brought were at once snapped up
by a privileged few. As Aurore never spoke with anyone outside the
household she could only learn what the Mignets chose to tell her.
She more than suspected that news was being kept from her when it
was more than usually horrible or alarming. She did hear of the
condemnation and death of the Queen, and this caused her
unmitigated grief. She also heard of the wholesale execution of the
Girondists, the brilliant party whose members were the first to try
and cry halt to the holocaust which they themselves had set in
motion. The &eacute;lite of intellectual Paris perished on the guillotine
on that awful last day of October, and with them perished the last
of the moderatists who might have stemmed the tide of butchery nine
months before the surfeit of carnage put an end to it at last.</p>

<p>Aurore could not help wondering at times how her husband would
fare though all the turmoil that followed the execution of the
Girondists. It was obvious, even to her who knew so little, that no
man's head was safe upon his shoulders if he expressed the
slightest desire to see the end of all the slaughter, or showed
anything but satisfaction at the orgy of blood that went on day
after day. And Aurore, with all her hatred and dread of Andr&eacute;, knew
him to be entirely fearless and disdainful of his life where his
ideals and his beliefs were at stake. As in the days of his youth,
when he had boldly expressed his views on the Rights of Man and the
iniquity of the old social system that allowed two thirds of
humanity to starve so that the remaining third might feast, as
later on he had joined Danton in the denunciation of those tyrants
who had learned nothing from the lesson taught them by an outraged
people, so now he would with equal boldness tilt against the
assassins, who through sheer fear for their own lives were vying
with one another in atrocities and had turned the beautiful land of
France into a gigantic shambles.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, thought Aurore, he would fall a victim to his
moderatism. It would be a pity, she thought, because there must be
so few men of sane fews and true patriotism left in the country
now. Once or twice she spoke about Andr&eacute; to the Mignets and showed
an anxiety on his behalf which she hoped would please them. It did.
And as usual the Doctor and the old lady at once embarked on their
wonted eulogy of their friend.</p>

<p>"They daren't touch him," the Doctor said decisively.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Aurore retorted. And then added: "It seems to me
that, as they dared raise their guilty hand against the Queen, they
would dare anything."</p>

<p>"That was different," the Doctor asserted.</p>

<p>"Why different?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;'s life is consecrated to the service of the poor and the
afflicted. One could hardly say that of the unfortunate Marie
Antoinette."</p>

<p>"She never had the opportunity," Aurore protested hotly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But, anyway, while she lived she was a constant
inducement to a handful of hotheaded traitors to betray their
country for her sake. You would be surprised, citizeness, if you
knew the number of conspiracies, of intrigues, of treacheries that
were daily hatches in order to overthrow the Republic and replace
the Austrian woman on her son on the throne."</p>

<p>"Then do you mean to tell me that you&mdash;" Aurore retorted
vehemently.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me that question, citizeness," the Doctor broke in
with earnestness. "I am no politician, nor am I the guardian of my
country's laws. I only wanted to point out to you that the
execution of Marie Antoinette in no way suggest danger to your
husband."</p>

<p>"Unless things chance very much for the worse," the old lady put
in, "the country cannot afford to lose its Andr&eacute; Vallon."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>It seemed a strange question for a wife to ask. Madame Mignet,
for the first time since the beginning of their friendship, cast a
disapproving eye on Aurore.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said coldly, "you know better than we do that
your husband is the only man in France at this present moment who
has thoroughly mastered the system of teaching the deaf and dumb.
By means of signs, which he does with his one hand, he has taught
scores of such poor afflicted souls how to exchange and assimilate
ideas. And the same with the blind. Surely you knew all that."</p>

<p>Aurore's silence was her reply. She felt ashamed. How could she
own to these dear, kind friends that she had not yet been on such
terms of intimacy with her husband that he could speak to her about
himself or his work? She had only been a pleasant acquaintance in
the sunny home of the Quai de la Ferraille, one with whom a busy
man could discuss the abstract theories of Rousseau or the speeches
of Mirabeau. To her husband she had only been an intelligent
opponent at chess or piquet, but never a confidant. Not hers the
sympathetic ear into which a man could pour the tale of his
struggles, his strivings, his disappointments. Not hers the loved
voice whose gentle tones could soothe the nerves jaded by
fatigue.</p>

<p>Much against her will, a few hot tears rose to Aurore's eyes.
She rose quickly and turned away lest those kind friends should see
them.</p>

<p>But after that she no longer tried to disguise from the Mignets
the fact that she and Andr&eacute; were two beings apart. They had guessed
it, of course, but out of delicacy had never given her a hint that
they knew. The full circumstances of her marriage were, of course,
unknown to them, but it was very clear that the ideals of a
Royalist and those of a child of the Revolution were as far apart
as the poles. Love alone might in time have bridged over the
distance, but alas! as Madame Mignet remarked to her son one day
when they talked the matter over together, there is no love between
them on either side. Womanlike, she put the blame for this on
Aurore.</p>

<p>"She is beautiful," was her comment on the situation, "but I am
afraid that she has no temperament; and Andr&eacute; ought to have had
either a clinging, affectionate little wife, who would have
mothered him, or else..."</p>

<p>The old lady paused and put on a demure expression. She knew
what she meant, and so did her son, and between them they decided
that Aurore of the wonderful eyes and the cherry-red mouth did not
possess any of the attributes which would have made Andr&eacute;
happy.</p>

<p>"Unless..." Madame Mignet added, who was nothing if not
enigmatic. And then she said with a hopeful little sigh, "One never
knows."</p>

<p>And Aurore, sitting in the large-winged chair by the window in
the pretty room at Nevers, watched the snowflakes slowly fluttering
down from the leaden sky. She also watched other things from that
pleasant point of vantage&mdash;people hurrying by with heads bent
against the cold wind, the poor little half-frozen children
hurrying home from school, the gossips at the street corner, and
the itinerant menders of tin pots or earthenware, and, once a
month, when the diligence came in from Paris, her husband, Andr&eacute;
Vallon, with a small valise in his hand, pausing a moment at the
door to ring the bell.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>Chapter 35</h2>

<p>It was on one of the first days of March that Aurore had the
surprise of her life. Andr&eacute;, in the course of his visit, announced
to her the early arrival of her father at Nevers.</p>

<p>"He will be safer here," he explained, in response to Aurore's
little cry, half of joy and half of alarm. "The people in the
villages suffered terrible privations during the protracted winter,
and tempers over there are none too placid in consequence. Some few
hotheads might engineer a regrettable coup."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"This will not entail any unpleasantness?" she suggested
tentatively.</p>

<p>"Unpleasantness?"</p>

<p>"For you, I mean, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, why should it?"</p>

<p>"Or danger?"</p>

<p>"Danger? For him? Certainly not. He will be much safer
here."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean for him."</p>

<p>"For you, then?"</p>

<p>"Of course not!" she retorted, and then added with a shrug, "As
if I mattered."</p>

<p>"Then I don't understand what you do mean by danger. Danger to
whom?"</p>

<p>"To you."</p>

<p>He said nothing for a moment or two, but she felt that those
searching eyes of his were seeking to find some hidden thought,
some unexplainable motive in those two words which she had murmured
below her breath. After a few seconds' silence he gave a light
shrug and said drily:</p>

<p>"I can but echo your own words&mdash;as if I mattered!"</p>

<p>He turned to go out of the room. Involuntarily she called
out:</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;!"</p>

<p>The first time, the very first time that she had called to him
by name. He paused at the door with his hand already on the knob
and half turned to her:</p>

<p>"At your service, citizeness."</p>

<p>His voice was quite harsh and his tone cold, so cold that the
impulse which had made her call to him seemed frozen suddenly into
a kind of miserable shyness. He was not the sort of man to whom one
could offer sympathy or comfort. Nevertheless, Aurore was conscious
of an intense pity for her husband. All of a sudden he appeared to
her so lonely! Introspective, too, probably through being so very
much alone. And young, scarcely older than herself, and with all
his hours spent amid the afflicted, the blind, the deaf and dumb,
the miserable poor! In constant contact with everything that was
most wretched and most squalid!</p>

<p>And with all his ideals of a regenerated world lying shattered
around him! Lonely and disappointed! And she, his wife, could do
nothing to comfort or cheer him. When she tried to find the right
words with which to touch his heart, she was stupid and
tongue-tied. Even now, when she felt so desperately sorry and so
deeply grateful, she could not find those words which perhaps might
have brought a faint gleam of pleasure to his eyes.</p>

<p>All she could do now was to murmur a few words that were quite
unintelligible and apparently failed to reach him. She made a great
effort to control herself and her voice and finally contrived to
say fairly steadily:</p>

<p>"I only wished to ask you about the arrangements for my father.
When does he come?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he replied equally steadily, "by carriole. I have
secured a nice apartment for him close by here in the Rue de la
Monnaie. Pierre will drive him over, and he and Jeannette will look
after him as they have done all along at Marigny."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," Aurore murmured. "I wish&mdash;" she paused and
then went on more glibly "-I wish I could show you in some way that
I&mdash;that I am not ungrateful."</p>

<p>"There is no question of gratitude," he said drily. "I made you
a promise that while you are my wife your father's safety would be
my care. I am trying to keep my promise, that is all."</p>

<p>"You are ungracious," she rejoined. "Does not the English poet
say that 'Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind'?"</p>

<p>"I would not for the worlds have you think me unkind."</p>

<p>"Then tell me."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"How I can best repay you for the trouble my father has been to
you."</p>

<p>"I assure you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;," she insisted, "please!"</p>

<p>Again his name on her lips. Once upon a time she had hit at him
with a moral whip lash and she had also struck him in the face.
Neither morally nor physically had she hurt him then, and he had
not even winced at the time. Then why, at sound of his name on her
lips, did that frown appear upon his brow as if he were trying to
keep back something, to control some movement&mdash;or was it
words?&mdash;while an unmistakable look of pain crept into his
eyes? Only for an instant, though. Within the space of a second the
look of pain as well as the frown had vanished, and there was that
mocking smile&mdash;that hateful, hateful mocking smile which she
so dreaded, curling again around his lips.</p>

<p>"Since you desire it, citizeness," he said drily, "I will tell
you that you would earn my deep gratitude if you refrained from
listening too patiently to your father's diatribes on the present
political situation. Believe me, we all know it to be terrible. But
words won't mend it, not just yet. Your father very naturally hates
me, he will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't allow him&mdash;" she broke in hotly, and then paused,
her impulse once more check by that miserable, unexplainable
shyness. He put up his hand as if to deprecate anything else that
she might say.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, "I am more than repaid."</p>

<p>He went out of the room, and she was left standing there with a
big, big ache in her heart, an ache that she could not very well
account for, but it forced tears up to her eyes. Tears of anxiety?
Of pity? Of regret? She did not know. She only knew that she was
desperately miserable and that not even the prospect of seeing her
father again so soon had the power to console her.</p>

<p>But had her eyes been gifted with the power to see through
material objects she would have made her own heartache seem light
and easy to bear. She would have seen a man, strong of will and of
iron purpose, broken down by the force of a passion he could no
longer control. Gone were resentment and bitterness, pride was torn
to shreds. Here was just a man madly&mdash;passionately in love.
Slowly he fell on his knees; his arm rested against the door; his
face was buried in the crook of his arm; and a mighty sigh came
from the overburdened heart and broke in a convulsive sob.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>Chapter 36</h2>

<p>Charles de Marigny arrived the following afternoon. Aurore had
been full of eager joy to see him. All morning she had been busy in
the apartment of the Rue de la Monnaie, putting it to rights,
making it look as comfortable and as gay as she could. The house
was at the end of the street, and the windows of the parlour
commanded a beautiful view over the Grande Place, the Ducal Palace,
and the river beyond. The room was flooded with sunshine.</p>

<p>After an exceptionally severe winter the spring had come in
early, with warm days and an absence of cold winds. The shrubs in
the gardens of the Palace were covered with tender green. Lilac,
syringa, and jasmine were in bud. Aurore went about her task
humming the old chansons:</p>

<p>"<i>Il &eacute;tait une Berg&egrave;re, et ron&mdash;et ron, petit Pataplon!</i>"</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>"<i>Nuage, beau Nuage, qui passe Triomphant!</i>"</p>

<p>She couldn't sit still. At every sound of wheels or clatter of
hoofs she ran to the window to see if the carriole was in
sight.</p>

<p>But at sight of her father her high spirits quickly sank.
Looking down on him from the window, as he got out of the carriole,
he appeared to her to be years older. She ran down, and he embraced
her with passionate effusion, but the very next moment he pushed
her away from him as if the sight of her horrified him. He followed
her upstairs, however, leaving Pierre and Jeannette to deal with
the carriole and luggage. He did not so much as give a glance round
the sunlit room, but threw himself into a chair like a man wearied
to death. He had not yet uttered a single word.</p>

<p>Aurore came and knelt down beside him. She would not admit to
herself how appalled and disappointed she was. She, who had been
the apple of her father's eye, felt as if he were a stranger to
her, a stranger whom she almost feared. Her anxious glance searched
the face that she had loved so dearly, vainly seeking for that
expression of almost passionate tenderness wherewith he had been
wont to regard her. But now there was a kind of fierce glitter in
his eyes which would suddenly die down and give place to a dull,
vacant stare. Aurore felt intensely sorry for him, for his face
betrayed the suffering which he must have endured throughout this
long autumn and winter, brooding over his wrongs, all alone up at
Marigny, and seeing the horrors and the outrage of this terrible
revolution pass like a nightmare before his eyes.</p>

<p>He said very little that first afternoon, and never once touched
upon his daughter's marriage or asked either after her husband or
the kind friends in whose house she was staying.</p>

<p>But the next day he appeared more loquacious, was apparently
happy at the thought that he would no longer be parted from his
darling little Aurore, and fell in with all her plans for spending
as much time together as possible. They would drive out into the
country, or go up the river, and they would spend long evenings
together, talking over old times.</p>

<p>He spoke quite rationally, but Aurore could not help noticing
that his movements were jerky and that while he talked his hands
kept on shaking and his fingers fidgeting with anything that was
handy. And suddenly he mentioned Andr&eacute; Vallon by name, quite
dispassionately at first. Aurore was at her favourite place on a
low stool beside his chair, with one arm over his knees. He took
hold of her hand, and she noticed that his was burning hot.
Carefully, insidiously, he invited her confidence.</p>

<p>"Tell me, my little Aurore," he said, and his tone was gentle
and soothing. "Don't be afraid to tell me how unhappy you are. I
know you are unhappy, my beloved child, but our troubles always
seem less, you know, when we tell of them to a sympathetic
ear."</p>

<p>"When you were little," he went on, as Aurore made some evasive
reply, "I was your mother as well as your father. You used to tell
me everything&mdash;all your childish troubles. Tell me your
troubles now, my darling. Tell me everything. That cruel, inhuman
beast! I'd like to know to what lengths his brutality could
go."</p>

<p>And as Aurore still continued to parry his direct questions he
put down her reticence to the desire to spare him pain. His tone
became more insinuating still, and a look of deep cunning came into
his eyes. He leaned forward in his chair till his mouth nearly
touched her ear.</p>

<p>"I'll rid you of him, my little Aurore," he whispered. "I have
thought it all out. That's why I consented to come to this
miserable hole. You trust me. I know! I know just what to do. You
needn't tell me anything. I can guess. The brute! The beggarly
knave! I know! But I'll rid you of him. Never fear!"</p>

<p>Aurore did all she could to soothe him, but, in spite of
herself, her heart was filled with a great and nameless dread.
There was something dangerous in the fanaticism of her father's
hatred, and although the Mignets and Andr&eacute; himself did all they
could to reassure her, she had the growing conviction that there
was method in her father's apparent madness. He took to roaming
about the streets for hours at a time, and Jeannette told Aurore
that when he returned he usually brought back with him a lot of
news sheets over which he pored and pondered for the rest of the
day. Jeannette and Pierre both said that Monseigneur slept very
little; they heard him pacing up and down the room half the night
through and muttering to himself. Aurore questioned the two
faithful souls as to what Monseigneur said when he muttered like
that, but it seemed that those mutterings were mostly
unintelligible; the only words they ever heard clearly were: "Quite
simple&mdash;quite easy! That is what I must do," which certainly
did not tend to reassure Aurore.</p>

<p>One day, when she came to see the old man, Jeannette told her
that he had just gone out, but had spent all morning poring over
some news sheets. One in particular he had been intent on for more
than an hour, Jeannette said; it was still lying on the table
beside his chair. Aurore went into the parlour and had a look at
the news sheet. It was an old number of the <i>Moniteur</i>, bearing a
date in September of last year. It contained the full text of
Merlin's abominable "<i>Loi Relatif aux Gens Suspects</i>." The Law of the
Suspect! Obviously, De Marigny had been perusing it; the page with
the text lay uppermost; there were notes in the margin in his
handwriting. Certain passages were underlined; for instance:</p>

<p>Art I: Immediately after the publication of this Decree, all
suspected persons on the territory of the Republic who are still at
large will be arrested.</p>

<p>And below that there was:</p>

<p>Are reputed suspect I: Those who, either by their conduct or by
their relations with former tyrants or aristos.</p>

<p>And the last have dozen words were underlined.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch37" id="ch37"></a>Chapter 37</h2>

<p>At what precise moment the first dart of a horrible suspicion
entered her heart Aurore did not know. All she realized was that an
awful danger threatened her husband at the hands of her father.</p>

<p>The horror of such a thing!</p>

<p>She knew, as did everyone these days, that one denunciation,
even if it came from an irresponsible person, was often sufficient
to bring about the arrest of a fellow creature&mdash;arrest which
almost invariably was the precursor of death! And with her mind
fixed upon this fact she recalled her father's wild rambling words:
"I'll rid you of him...I know what to do...Quite simple...That is
what I must do..."</p>

<p>Quite simple!</p>

<p>Now Aurore's mind worked more quickly. Something had to be done,
and done at once. But what? Firstly, where was the unfortunate
madman now? Had he already set out on his proposed trail of
treachery and crime? Aurore called to Jeannette and to Pierre. She
questioned them and questioned them. Where was Monseigneur? They
did not know. Where did he go when he went out aimlessly like this?
Just about the streets, sometimes in one direction, sometimes in
another. He was fond of the river bank. The river! Great God in
heaven! For one moment Aurore caught herself almost hoping that he
had courted the river in a mad desire to put an end to all his
misery. Almost hoping! Heavens above! was she going mad, too? She
was, unless she could get a more definite idea of whither her
father had gone. But for the moment, since they knew nothing,
Pierre and Jeannette must go back to their work. She, Aurore,
wished to be left alone to think, to find out
something&mdash;something!</p>

<p>She looked about her in the small sunlit parlour, feeling
helpless and her soul in darkness. She beat her hands together in a
wild longing for inspiration. What about money? Had he taken any
with him? Aurore knew where he kept it&mdash;in the drawer of the
small escritoire. She had often seen him take out a livre or two to
give to Jeannette. Now she went to look. The pocketbook that was
usually in the drawer was no longer there. There were two packets
instead. One was addressed to Pierre and obviously contained money,
paper and coins. The other was addressed "To my little Aurore." She
opened it. There was a letter written in his familiar careful
hand.</p>

<p class="letter">My Darling Little One [it said]:<br>
<br>
I promised you that I would rid you of the inhuman monster who
has blighted your young life, and I am going to do it. By the time
you get this I shall be on my way to Paris. That arch-rogue Talon,
who is as useful fortunately as he is servile, has made all
necessary arrangements. His wife has relatives in Paris, and I
shall stay with them. For the first time in my life I shall accept
hospitality in a plebeian house, but I have no alternative. What I
want to do can only be done in Paris, but there it can be done
quickly. Do not try and find out what I am about to do or how. Wait
patiently for a further letter from me. Talon will bring it you. I
may be caught in my own toils, but I care not so long as I have
made you happy and free.<br>
<br>
Your devoted Father.</p>

<p>Aurore read the terrible lucubration until the end. Then she
refolded the letter and slipped it in the bosom of her gown. She
had no doubt now as to what she meant to do, but she wouldn't leave
anything to chance. So she hunted through the drawer again and
through the whole of the escritoire for some written trace of
Hector Talon, that awful, miserable, obsequious Talon! So it was he
who was at the bottom of this abominable treachery! Aurore hunted
for a letter, a sign of him, as a careful gardener would hunt for
the trail of the slug that had impaired his plants. But she found
nothing. Talon was a man&mdash;no, a worm&mdash;who worked
underground in the darkness and left no trace of his slimy way.</p>

<p>Then Aurore once more questioned Jeannette and Pierre. Had they
seen&mdash;did they know anything of Hector Talon? And she wrung
the truth out of them, poor miserable wretches! Talon had been in
Nevers two days. He had visited Monseigneur. He had bribed them to
say nothing to Mademoiselle of these visits. He had been here early
this morning, and he and Monseigneur then went out together, Talon
carrying a small valise which Pierre had packed with a few
necessities at Monseigneur's orders.</p>

<p>And then Aurore saw red. She felt like a tigress in a fury,
would gladly with her two feeble hands have seized those two fools
by the throat. They had taken money, money to hold their tongue,
while Monseigneur le Duc de Marigny, who bore one of the greatest
names in France, and was own cousin to her martyred king,
accomplished the vilest act of treachery that had ever disgraced a
canaille.</p>

<p>But what was the good of fury, what the good of vituperations,
now that the crime was on the point of accomplishment? One fact she
did wring out of the trembling lips of Pierre. Lucile Talon's
relatives lived in No. 67 of the Rue St. Honor&eacute;. Well, that, at any
rate, was something. Aurore knew now where she could find her
father.</p>

<p>She was half-dazed when she reached the Mignets' house. Without
circumlocution, straight to the point, she told them what had
happened.</p>

<p>"I must go to Paris," she concluded calmly, "at once. How can I
do it?"</p>

<p>"My dear child," the old lady protested, "you cannot go to Paris
like this, all in a moment."</p>

<p>"I have my papers, money, everything," she said. "Help me to
find a conveyance, as the diligence does not leave till next
week."</p>

<p>"But what can you do, child?"</p>

<p>"Warn my husband before it is too late."</p>

<p>To every protest, every objection she gave the same reply: "I
must go to my husband before it is too late."</p>

<p>And then she said at last, "If you will not help me I will find
a way somehow, but I am going before the day is out."</p>

<p>Help her? Of course they would help her! Were they not the
kindest people on God's earth, and was not Andr&eacute; Vallon the beloved
friend of their heart? Doctor Mignet would, of course, accompany
Aurore as far as Paris, and while she went to put a few things
together he set out to find coach and horses which would take them
as far as Auxerre, where they could pick up another conveyance to
take them on to Melun and to Paris. That was probably the route
chosen by Talon for Monseigneur, and Aurore would be close on her
father's heels.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>Chapter 38</h2>

<p>To anyone returning to Paris in this awful year 1794, after an
absence of several months, the aspect of the once gay and lovely
city must have been appalling. Streets half deserted; furtive, ill
clad figures slouching about the open places; aspects of dire
poverty in a blatant contrast with brilliantly lighted restaurants
or theatre porticoes; sounds of strident laughter alternating with
heart-rending moans. Laughter and tears, and words scarcely
whispered lest they be overheard.</p>

<p>This great, this sublime revolution which was to bring universal
freedom and universal happiness, how immense has been its toll of
misery and of crime! Penury is terrible; certain necessities like
soap and sugar are hardly obtainable. Bread is more and more
scarce; the queues outside the bakeries line up during the small
hours of the morning and last all day.</p>

<p>The wolves of the Revolution are busy tearing one another to
pieces. After the Girondins, the Dantonists. Danton, the great
Georges Danton, the lion of the Revolution, who for five years has
held the snarling, screaming pack on the leash, has atoned for his
weaknesses as well as for his crimes, on the insatiable guillotine.
Too weak to stem the flood which he himself had let loose, he
perished as he had allowed others to perish&mdash;his king, his
queen, his comrades, his friends. Too weak! The great, the virile
Danton, with the resonant voice and tempestuous eloquence, too weak
to combat his cunning, slimy adversary, the Sea-green Incorruptible
with the ascetic face and the pale eyes! Then what chance had
others against the all powerful dictator who with one word hissed
through his thin lips could send any adversary without trial to the
scaffold?</p>

<p>It was a month and more since the Dantonists had perished on the
guillotine, and Maximilien Robespierre was sovereign master of
France.</p>

<p>Aurore, sitting inside the diligence which had brought her and
the Doctor over from Melun, had no eyes for outward things. Whether
Paris was changed or not since last she had been in the city,
whether the streets looked dismal and the restaurants lively, she
neither knew nor cared. It was a lovely day in May: the chestnut
trees in the Tuileries gardens were full of blossom; the sun shone
and the sky was blue; but Aurore say nothing of these beauties of
nature. Now that the time was so near when she would see her
husband her febrile impatience was such that it was only by a
mighty effort of will that she was able to sit still in the crowded
coach and not allow her fellow passengers to become aware of the
state of her nerves. They might have thought her demented. Doctor
Mignet sat beside her and now and then gave her hand a slight
pressure, which comforted her for the moment.</p>

<p>At last the lumbering coach came to a halt at the Cheval Blanc,
the posting inn close to the Pont Neuf. The Quai de la Ferraille
was quite close. Aurore elected to walk while Doctor Mignet would
look after the luggage. He announced his intention of putting up at
the Cheval Blanc, if he could get a room.</p>

<p>"I shall be within five minutes' walk," he said kindly, "so you
can call on me, my dear, whenever you want me."</p>

<p>It was then three o'clock in the afternoon. The usual crowd
swarmed round the Palace of Justice, waiting to see the prisoners
being hustled out after their condemnation, or the well known
advocates or members of the Convention sally forth after the grim
work of the day was done.</p>

<p>Aurore paid no heed to anything round her; wrapped in her
travelling cape with the hood pulled over her head she walked
rapidly, looking neither to right nor left. But suddenly the crowd
surged along the bridge, and she found herself hustled and pressed
against the parapet: a couple of tumbrils surrounded by men in
uniform were forging their way through the throng. They were the
prisoners who had just stood the mockery of a trial and were being
taken back to La Force or the Temple for their final toilette
before their ultimate journey to the guillotine. A few
tatterdemalions in the crowd shouted: "A la guillotine!" Others
hurled insults at the prisoners, but the bulk of the people looked
on with a kind of stolid indifference, showing neither joy nor
horror.</p>

<p>Aurore, pressed against the parapet, saw the tumbrils pass along
quite close to her; she saw the prisoners standing with hands tied
behind their backs; and suddenly the full force of the horror which
she saw reached her consciousness. She searched those faces in the
tumbrils, realizing for the first time that perhaps she had come
too late and that Andr&eacute; might be standing there in the
tumbril&mdash;standing there on his way to death.</p>

<p>When the tumbrils had passed and the crowd drifted away in their
wake she remained for a long time there, leaning against the
balustrade with eyes blind to everything save to the vision that
had just passed by, and lips parted by the cries of horror which
she had been at such pains to repress. Andr&eacute; had not been one of
those poor wretches that were being dragged through the streets of
Paris for the delectation of the mob: but the vision of that
ghastly exhibition had conjured up the possibility of another, so
awful, so terrible, so infernal that Aurore was left wondering if
she was not indeed going the way of her father and losing her
reason at the foresight.</p>

<p>After a little while she recovered herself, and without glancing
to right or left she hurried along the quay. Soon she reached the
house wherein she had spent the first few months of her married
life! What peace there seemed to be in it! Aurore felt it almost as
soon as she passed under the porte-coch&egrave;re and made her way up the
familiar stone staircase. She rang the bell of the apartment as she
had done so often in the past, and the same pleasant middle-aged
woman opened the door to her.</p>

<p>The woman's eyes looked ready to fall out of her head at sight
of Aurore.</p>

<p>"But, citizeness...!" she exclaimed, and clasped her hand
together in amazement.</p>

<p>"Citizen Vallon? Is he in?" Aurore almost gasped, and staggered
into the vestibule.</p>

<p>The semi darkness indoors after the dazzling sunshine of the
street dazed her and made her feel as if she were blind. The woman
ran to her and put her arms round her.</p>

<p>"You are ill, citizeness," she murmured. "What can I get
you?"</p>

<p>Aurore shook her head: "Nothing!...I am not ill...Where is
Citizen Vallon?"</p>

<p>"At the Blind School, citizeness. He does not usually come home
before evening."</p>

<p>"You expect him home, then?"</p>

<p>"But of course, citizeness."</p>

<p>The woman, with gentle solitude, relieved Aurore of the heavy
travelling cape. She was obviously puzzled and not a little
frightened, but tried to speak as unconcernedly as she could.</p>

<p>"We were not expecting you, citizeness," she said: "at least the
Citizen said nothing to me."</p>

<p>"No," Aurore replied more calmly: "he does not expect me. I came
with Doctor Mignet."</p>

<p>The woman opened the parlour door. How inviting it looked! The
bright sunny room with the muslin curtains, the armchair and her
own work table beside the window; the books, the footstool, the
chessmen ranged on the board. Aurore's tired eyes roamed round the
room and, in spite of the agony of dread which was gnawing at her
heart, an infinite peace seemed to descend on her soul. With a
weary little sigh she sank into the armchair, and a wan smile lit
up her face in response to the woman's anxious, puzzled gaze.</p>

<p>"What would you like, citizeness?" the woman asked, a little
reassured. "A glass of wine, or some hot coffee?"</p>

<p>"Coffee, please, Marie. Some of that lovely coffee you used to
make for my breakfast."</p>

<p>"It won't be quite so nice now, citizeness," Marie said with a
sigh; "and we have no milk."</p>

<p>"Whatever it is, Marie, I shall love it," Aurore assured her.
The woman went away, and she snuggled down into the big chair. How
lovely and peaceful it was! The quay below was half deserted;
hardly a sound came to disturb the quietude of this serene abode.
Leaning her head against the back of the chair Aurore felt a flood
of tears rise to her eyes&mdash;tears that were not wholly of
sorrow.</p>

<p>She drank eagerly the coffee which Marie presently brought her.
After which the kind woman persuaded her to lie down on the sofa
and saw her comfortably settled with a couple of pillows under her
head. Poor little Aurore! She was so tired, so infinitely weary!
Physically and mentally weary. Her limbs ached, and her head. And
she had a great big heartache.</p>

<p>And lying there snugly against the pillows she presently fell
asleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch39" id="ch39"></a>Chapter 39</h2>

<p>The sound of the door and a murmur of voices roused Aurore from
sleep.</p>

<p>The next moment Andr&eacute; came into the room. She sat up on the
sofa, her hands clasped tightly together, her fair hair slightly
tousled, and her cheeks flushed after sleep. The shades of evening
were drawing in, and the rosy light of sunset had crept into the
room. Andr&eacute;, at the door, had not yet moved. He was looking his
fill on the exquisite vision which had transformed this simple room
into a mansion of paradise.</p>

<p>At last he asked the obvious questions:</p>

<p>"Why are you here? Has anything happened?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Andr&eacute;," she replied, "a very great deal has happened. My
father, poor wretch, has completely lost his reason!"</p>

<p>"Heavens above!"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I don't mean in that way, though I do think
Doctor Mignet would actually pronounce him mad."</p>

<p>She paused a moment. Her throat felt so dry that she could
hardly speak. There were a carafe and a glass on the side table.
Andr&eacute; filled the glass with water and brought it to her. While she
drank he stood beside her, and when she was about to put the glass
down he took it from her, and his hand touched her fingers, which
were trembling and cold.</p>

<p>"You are overwrought," he said gently. "Don't try and talk now.
I will call Marie and she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! no!" she broke in quickly. "I don't want anyone. I am only
tired from the journey, and I must tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes? What is it?"</p>

<p>"Spurred by his insane hatred against you, my father has
denounced you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Never mind how I know: I know it. I swear to you that it is so.
One day I will tell you just how I found out, but not now. There is
no time. I came to warn you before&mdash;before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You came to warn me?" he asked, frowning, evidently
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>They looked at each other, he uncomprehending, not daring to
comprehend, and she, seized with that awful shyness which almost
paralyzed her will and her tongue.</p>

<p>"Why?" he insisted, but this time he came nearer her, and his
voice was hoarse and broken like that of a man gasping for
breath.</p>

<p>"Because," she murmured, "because&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was her eyes that answered him. Her lips refused her
service.</p>

<p>"Because you cared?"</p>

<p>Was there ever a cry uttered by man more exultant than this
which rose like a paean of joy from Andr&eacute; Vallon's throat? In a
moment he was beside her on one knee, not daring to touch her yet,
but with ardent, passionate gaze trying to read the secret of her
soul.</p>

<p>"Because you cared?" he insisted. "Tell me."</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;!"</p>

<p>"Because you cared what became of me? Say it! Say it! Say the
word, <i>ma mie</i>! Tell me that you came," he entreated, "because you
cared."</p>

<p>How could she speak? The whole world, the sordid, ugly world,
lay suddenly shattered at her feet, and in the gaze that sought and
held her own she had a glimpse of such a vision of Elysian fields
as human mind could scarcely conceive. She returned his gaze and
her eyes, which had always seemed unfathomable, revealed to him the
secret which she had thought would remain forever buried in her
heart. It was Love that had spurred her to come. Love that had so
often made her heart ache almost to breaking point. Love! and the
longing to feel once more that dear strong arm around her, to
pillow her head against that loyal breast, to hear that great and
simple heart beat only for her. He loved her, and she did not know
it! And now that the heavenly knowledge had come to her at last it
came hand-in-hand with the agonizing dread for his life.</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;!" she said suddenly, all the joy in her heart smothered
in this awful dread, "you must leave Paris at once."</p>

<p>He did not seem to hear. He had had his answer from her eyes,
and his soul was no longer on this earth. It had gone a-roaming in
paradise.</p>

<p>"You came," he murmured, "because you cared."</p>

<p>But, womanlike, she thought only of him, of the terrible danger
which every minute as it sped by brought nearer and nearer to their
door.</p>

<p>"You don't understand, Andr&eacute;," she insisted. "My father is in
Paris. It was only after he left that I suspected&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then you came because you cared."</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;, at this very hour, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At this very hour I am adoring you, Aurore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's time to get away," she entreated feverishly.</p>

<p>"And I want eternity in which to tell you how I worship
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In God's name, Andr&eacute;!" she cried. "It may mean death if you
stay&mdash;"</p>

<p>But his hand was buried in her hair and forced her dear head
closer and closer to him.</p>

<p>"My exquisite Aurore!" he whispered in her ear, "you are the
most perfect being God ever made. I was a fool not to tell you this
before, but I will not die, Dawn of my Soul, before I have taught
you how good it is to love, how sweet it is to kiss."</p>

<p>He held her so close that she could no longer struggle. His lips
were on hers, and she could no longer warn, and he asked the great,
the immortal question which lovers have asked since the beginning
of time, and the answer to which will open for them the gates
either of paradise or of hell.</p>

<p>"Do you love me, my wife?"</p>

<p>And Aurore's eyes and lips answered softly, "Yes."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch40" id="ch40"></a>Chapter 40</h2>

<p>The hours flew by on the wings of an overwhelming happiness, and
Love reigned supreme while evening faded into night. The awakening
came when the two lovers scarce had finished dreaming. The tramp of
feet on the stairs, the knock on the door, the raucous call: "Open
in the name of the Law!"</p>

<p>It was quite dark in the room now&mdash;quite dark, only through
the chink under the door there came a narrow streak of light from
the candle which Marie had put on the table of the vestibule, and
through the thin muslin curtains over the window the pale flicker
of the street lamp cast the objects in the room into deeper
gloom.</p>

<p>"Open, in the name of the Law!"</p>

<p>And Aurore, waking from her dream of happiness and love, was
suddenly thrust out of the gates of her paradise and hurled back
into the hideous world of grim reality. In a moment she was on her
feet and across the room. Like a statue of despair she stood
against the door with arms outstretched and head thrown
back&mdash;a statue of despair but also of fury&mdash;a woman in
defence of her lover.</p>

<p>"Come and kiss me, Aurore!" came a happy voice, broken with
yearning, and in the gloom the arm she loved was stretched out in
longing to her.</p>

<p>She babbled hoarsely, incoherently, like one half demented:</p>

<p>"You must fly, Andr&eacute;! you must...you must...for my
sake...there's time...through the window in the next room. The back
yard...no one will see you...Andr&eacute;...Andr&eacute;...you must!"</p>

<p>"Come to me, Aurore...one more kiss," he said slowly; "ten more
if there's time..."</p>

<p>"But they are here," she insisted. "Andr&eacute;, can't you hear?"</p>

<p>Just then there was a timid knock at the door, and Marie's
trembling voice called aghast: "In the name of God, Citizen Vallon,
tell me what to do."</p>

<p>"Why, open the door, Marie," Andr&eacute; replied quietly, "else they
will break it open."</p>

<p>Then, as Marie's hesitating footsteps were heard shuffling
across the vestibule, he murmured softly:</p>

<p>"There's time for one more kiss...Come to me, Aurore."</p>

<p>Obviously she could not move. Horror, despair, had paralyzed her
will and her limbs. The woman defending her lover! how could she
move from that door, from that thin, futile barrier, the only thing
that stood between her lover and death? The next instant Andr&eacute; was
beside her; she felt again that dear, strong arm around her, her
head once more lay upon his breast, she felt the beating of that
heart which she knew now was filled with her image. His lips
eagerly devoured her eyes, her throat, her hair, and then in one
long, impassioned kiss their lips met once more in enduring,
all-conquering immutable love.</p>

<p>Outside in the vestibule there was bustle and noise and tramping
of feet; hoarse commands and a murmur of voices, and Marie's
wailing sobs. Then a knock at the door. A terrible cry rose to
Aurore's throat, but it was smothered before it reached her lips,
for Andr&eacute;'s hand was across her mouth.</p>

<p>"Open, in the name of the Law!"</p>

<p>"Three minutes, Citizen Soldiers," Andr&eacute; replied glibly, "while
I get a light."</p>

<p>And Aurore, clinging to him with convulsive hands, her face
bathed in tears, her voice broken with sobs, whispered
hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Kill me, Andr&eacute;!...For mercy's sake kill me...I cannot live
without your love."</p>

<p>"Look at me, sweet, and listen," he murmured hurriedly; and
obediently she opened her eyes and looked up at him.</p>

<p>It was quite dark in the room, quite dark; but the feeble light
of the street lamp faintly illuminated his face, and she could see
that it was irradiated with a wonderful happiness.</p>

<p>"What you want now, my sweet," he said more slowly, "is
courage."</p>

<p>"I have none, Andr&eacute;," she murmured feebly.</p>

<p>"You will have when you remember that God in His mercy will give
you someone else to care for, perhaps, instead of me."</p>

<p>"Someone else? I don't understand."</p>

<p>He pressed his lips close to her ear and whispered a few words
very low, so that she could scarcely hear, but which brought a rush
of colour to her pale cheeks. Then he looked once more into her
eyes and smiled: the happiest, lightest of smiles.</p>

<p>"And if it is a boy," he said earnestly, but still with that
happy smile, "do not teach him to hate all those Frenchmen who were
his father's friends, with whom he dreamed dreams of making this
old world new and happy, and who died for their ideals because they
were men and not gods."</p>

<p>He raised her gently from the ground as he had so often done
before, carried her into the next room, and there laid her down on
the bed. She had partly lost consciousness, but her arms were
twined round his neck, and her fingers so tightly linked together
that he had some difficulty in getting them apart. She lay very
still, but her eyes were open and her lips parted; her body was
shaken with heart-rending sobs. He knelt down beside the bed and
kissed her once more on the lips, drank the salt tears that lay
upon her cheek; he kissed her ice-cold hands, her throat, her feet
above the shoe, then slowly rose and went out of the room, closing
and locking the door behind him.</p>

<p>She gave one terrific cry: "Andr&eacute;!" and jumped up from the bed,
her senses alert; she ran to the door&mdash;it was locked; with her
hands she beat against the panels, she fell on her knees, clinging
to that cruel door which hid him from her view, and calling,
calling insistently, piteously, like a bird that has lost its mate.
And all the while she heard the murmurs of voices, Andr&eacute;'s calm
response: "Quite ready, Citizen Captain." A loud cry from Marie.
The opening and shutting of the front door; the tramp of feet
slowly...slowly...slowly dying away down the stairs.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>Marie coming in a few moments later found her in a dead swoon
across the floor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch41" id="ch41"></a>Book IV</h2>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 41</h2>

<p>She became known as "Our Little Lady of Sorrows"&mdash;Notre
Petite Dames des Douleurs.</p>

<p>She could be seen daily wending her way from the Quai de la
Ferraille to the Palais de Justice in the early morning, waiting in
the queue until the gates were opened, and thereafter taking her
place in the vast hall, always in the front row of the balcony that
faced the prisoners at the bar. At first the other habitu&eacute;s of the
grim spectacle looked on her as one of themselves, fond, as they
were, of watching the prisoners file in, seeing them take their
place on the benches facing the judges, with the chief prisoner in
the iron armchair in the immediate centre. Women in ragged shawls
and tattered kirtles, with dishevelled hair under soiled lace caps,
or scarlet berets, who had brought their knitting with them to
while away the waiting hours, would nudge Aurore when a well known
name was called out or if they recognized a noted prisoner.</p>

<p>"That's Amisal over there, citizness, the third from the end. He
tried to assassinate the patriot Collot in the Rue Favart, you
remember? Lucky he missed fire, the brigand! Oh! and if it isn't
that young scrub C&eacute;cile Renaud! She was for murdering the
Incorruptible himself. They found two knives in her market basket,
you know. Well, her way to the guillotine is clear enough."</p>

<p>But soon they found that she was not interested in their talk.
She didn't listen: she only looked. She had great eyes of a colour
impossible to define, and wore a dark travelling cape with a hood
over her fair hair. She would look and look while the batch of
prisoners filed in, but as soon as they were seated and the
Prosecutor Tinville began his indictment, she would lean back in
her seat and take no more notice of what went on in the hall
below.</p>

<p>Until another batch was called, when she would sit up and again
look on each face as the prisoners filed in. She never spoke and
she never cried, but she looked so sad that a woman one day, seeing
her come in rather later than usual, made a place for her by
squeezing her fellow spectators and said at the same time, "Here
comes the Little Lady of Sorrows. Come and sit by me, my dear.
You'll get a splendid view, better than the one you had
yesterday."</p>

<p>And so the name stuck to her. And she came, day after day, to
the Palais de Justice to watch the prisoners file into the hall,
there to receive their sentence of death. There was no alternative.
The very fact of being suspected of treason, of being denounced by
an enemy or a fool, of being brought to the bar of this travesty of
justice, was tantamount to a sentence of death. And Aurore came,
day after day, to watch this grim spectacle, because she could not
find out to what prison they had take Andr&eacute; and could find no other
way of knowing what became of him. The prisons were crowded, the
jailers overworked and harassed. Vainly had she tried to get sight
of the list of prisoners in every House of Detention in and around
Paris.</p>

<p>"We've no orders," was the response she invariably got from the
<i>conci&egrave;rge</i> or the captain in command. "Get an order from the
Committee, and you can see the list."</p>

<p>"What Committee?" she would ask insistently. "And how can I get
such an order?"</p>

<p>"Bah! Leave me in peace!" the man&mdash;whoever it
was&mdash;would reply with a savage oath. "You don't think you are
the only female who comes bothering us in this way, do you? If I
had to attend to all of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He would then turn his back on Aurore and have her ejected from
the room and the door slammed in her face. The rules governing
prison discipline had became very severe of late. The visits from
outside, which used to be allowed and were a great feature of
prison life in the past, were now strictly forbidden. The
government had persuaded itself that plots of all sorts were being
hatched in the Houses of Detention, and prisoners, in consequence,
were not allowed to see anyone. Thus frustrated at every turn,
Aurore took to haunting the Palais de Justice. There, at last, she
would be bound to see Andr&egrave; when he was brought to trial. She would
see him when that awful tumbril took him to his death.</p>

<p>She had no hope. None. Though she held but little communication
with anyone except, of course, Marie, she could not help knowing
that the fate of every prisoner these days was a foregone
conclusion. It was only a question of time. Some languished weeks
in prison, others even months, some few were hurried through the
ghastly process of arrest, trail, condemnation, and death in a few
days. Aurore knew that and watched in the Palais de Justice every
day.</p>

<p>She had written him a letter, just a few words in which she had
poured out her every soul. They were words which, she knew, would
give happiness to his heart and bring a smile to his dear lips.
This precious paper she inserted in a heavy gold locket which she
always held tightly in her hand ready to fling it to him if such a
blessed opportunity arose.</p>

<p>May had long since yielded to June. June passed on, serene and
warm, with its wealth of blossom in the gardens and a bird song in
the summer air. All nature seemed to smile while men hated and
destroyed one another and dared to mock God with their horrible
Mumbo-Jumbo, the feast of the Supreme Bring, with the
arch-murderer, Robespierre, parading in azure-blue coat and white
breeches as the arch-priest of the new deity.</p>

<p>That was on the 8th of June, less than a fortnight after Andr&egrave;'s
arrest. Doctor Mignet, who had been with Aurore during the first
few days of her misery and had attempted the impossible in trying
to find out wither they had taken Andr&eacute;, had been obliged to return
to his duties in Nevers. She hardly noticed his absence. Her heart
was dead to all save to an infinity of grief.</p>

<p>It was in the early days of June that she saw her father again.
She was walking across the Pont des Arts when suddenly she found
herself face to face with Hector Talon. She thought nothing of the
meeting at the moment; indeed, she hoped that he had not recognized
her. But what he did was to halt for a minute or two as soon as she
had passed by and then to follow her.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, when she came home from her daily
pilgrimage, she found Marie bursting with what she thought was
gladsome news.</p>

<p>"An elderly gentleman has come to see you, citizeness," she said
mysteriously. "He is waiting in the parlour."</p>

<p>"Oh, Marie!" Aurore exclaimed involuntarily. "You shouldn't
have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not admitted him!" Marie retorted with the easy familiarity of
her kind. "But it's your father, citizeness, your dear old
father!"</p>

<p>Aurore listened no further. With a heavy heart she went through
into the parlour and saw her father sitting there on the end of the
sofa close to the window, the sofa beside which Andr&eacute; had knelt
that late afternoon when first he had told her of his love. It
seemed like a supreme insult, this old man sitting just there
complacently gazing out of the window. When she entered he put out
his arms and exclaimed with joy and tenderness:</p>

<p>"My little Aurore! At last! At last!"</p>

<p>She had not moved from the door. At sight of him her gorge rose
in horror. What kind of a miscreated daughter was she that she
should hate her own father? Would she, at least, have sufficient
will power not to allow the full flood of her loathing to surge out
of her overburdened heart? He, on the other hand, did not appear
conscious of her enmity. As she did not rush into his arms he let
them drop and went on talking in a glib, matter-of-fact way:</p>

<p>"You have no idea, <i>ma ch&eacute;rie</i>," he said, "how anxious I have
been. I suppose your letter in answer to mine miscarried. I never
received it, you know."</p>

<p>"What letter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I wrote to tell you the joyful news. You never replied. But it
was a good idea to come yourself instead."</p>

<p>"What joyful news?"</p>

<p>"Why, that I have fulfilled my promise, ma <i>ch&eacute;rie</i>, to rid you of
the inhuman monster who had blighted your life."</p>

<p>"You mean that you wrote to tell me that you had committed the
most loathsome act of treachery that ever called down the vengeance
of God on a miscreant's head."</p>

<p>Even now he looked surprised, bewildered at her vehemence,
thinking that his beloved daughter, like so many women in these
terrible times, had perchance lost her reason.</p>

<p>"Aurore, my child!" he exclaimed soothingly.</p>

<p>"I am not your child!" she retorted coldly, "no longer the child
of so vile a worker of iniquity as you. You have brought upon me
such immeasurable sorrow as no man has ever brought on woman since
the beginning of time. The very sight of you turns my heart to
stone, and I can but pray to God that I may never set eyes on you
again. And now, I entreat you to go before I quite forget that you
are old and that you are my father."</p>

<p>She threw open the door and stood aside, pointing to it. De
Marigny tried to speak. He rose and came a step or two towards
her.</p>

<p>"Do not come near me," she said hoarsely. "My God! Can't you see
that I am at the end of my tether?"</p>

<p>"You are overwrought, Aurore," he rejoined coolly. "Heaven knows
what is going on in your poor distracted mind at this moment. You
have spoken words that I shall find hard to forgive, but a father's
heart is full of indulgence. I cannot, of course, stay now and
plead with you, for the devil apparently has possession of your
mind. It will take all our good Abb&eacute;'s piety to exorcize him."</p>

<p>Marie was hovering in the vestibule. She looked scared to death
as De Marigny came out of the parlour and took up his hat and
stick.</p>

<p>"Has she been long like this?" he asked her, indicating Aurore
and then touching his forehead.</p>

<p>Marie was indignant.</p>

<p>"There is nothing wrong with the Citizeness's brain," she said
hotly. "It is her heart that is broken because she worshipped her
husband, and he is like to perish on that awful guillotine."</p>

<p>De Marigny shrugged. How ignorant, how unobservant were people
of that class! He looked back once over his shoulder. Aurore had
not moved. The hood had fallen back from her head, and her delicate
profile, with the wealth of fair hair above it like a golden
aureole, looked like an exquisite cameo against the dark porti&egrave;re.
She looked a living statue of high breeding, of blue blood and
age-old descent&mdash;the perfect aristocrat. De Marigny shrugged
again. Worshipped her husband, indeed? What nonsense! What a lie!
Her mind was slightly unhinged, he concluded, that was all. Once
all these horrible times were over and he had her back at Marigny
she would be the first to laugh at this woman's foolish talk. And
he went away entirely unperturbed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch42" id="ch42"></a>Chapter 42</h2>

<p>It was on the 26th of July that the last blow fell. Aurore
sitting at her accustomed place in the Hall of the Palais de
Justice saw the prisoners file in, and the first to enter was
Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p>Our Little Lady of Sorrows! She gave one gasp&mdash;a sob that
rent her heart and caused even those deadened hearts around her to
beat with sudden pity.</p>

<p>"Thou hast seen him, eh, my cabbage?" the woman next to her
asked. "Which is he?"</p>

<p>Two or three of them put down their knitting. They were
interested. They meant to be kind. Their hearts were dulled by all
the miseries and the horrors which they had witnessed&mdash;dulled
but not dead. Our Little Lady of Sorrows! They were very, very
sorry for her! She was so pretty and so young! And she had been
watching here day after day for well-nigh two months to catch a
last glimpse of her man.</p>

<p>"Don't try and point him out, my pigeon," the woman went on
softly; "only nod 'yes' if I guess right."</p>

<p>The woman on the other side said:</p>

<p>"I believe it is that handsome fellow with the one arm. Well, it
is a shame that such a fine soldier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, citizeness," someone at the back broke in, "you are
talking treason."</p>

<p>That was so. No one was allowed to express pity for the
prisoners at the bar, for such pity was a sign of
counter-revolutionary tendencies and, as such, punishable by death.
Even so, one woman said pointing to Andr&eacute;: "He taught the blind to
read and the dumb to speak. My daughter, who is blind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! Silence!" came from the rest of the crowd.</p>

<p>Our Little Lady of Sorrows sat and watched, her whole soul in
her eyes. She say Andr&eacute; as the chief prisoner of the batch sitting
in the iron chair immediately facing the judges. His face looked
perfectly serene. He looked older, of course, and wan; prison life
had no suited his vigorous temperament; but his dark eyes shone
brightly, and around his mouth there was that mocking smile which
Aurore had so dreaded once, but which since she had learned to
love. Unlike his fellow prisoners Andr&eacute; had obviously taken great
pains with his appearance. He wore his old military tunic, which,
though very worn and shabby, had been carefully brushed. He was
neatly shaved, and his chestnut hair was tied back with a bow at
the nape of his neck.</p>

<p>Our Little Lady of Sorrows watched him and marvelled that God in
His mercy did not allow her heart to break. She listened to the
indictment read by Prosecutor Tinville. She heard every lying word,
every monstrous accusation. She listened and watched, drawing his
soul to hers with the magnetism of her eyes. She threw back her
hood so that he should see her better. And suddenly he looked up
and saw her. Such a look of joy and happiness and love came into
his face, as surely only shines on the faces of the blessed.
Thereafter he looked neither to right nor left. Only at her. The
Prosecutor finished his indictment, the advocate began to plead.
Obviously Andr&eacute; heard neither. Yet the advocate pleaded with
fevour, even with passion. Even the crowd murmured approval at the
defence, but what was the good? Prisoners were condemned long
before they faced their judges. The advocate was silenced even in
the very middle of his peroration, cut short when he was halfway
through an eloquent sentence; and the prisoners were not allowed
one word in their own defence.</p>

<p>They were all condemned in a body. Traitors all to the Republic!
Conspirators against the State! The sentence was that they be
guillotined. And that was all! The mock trial was at an end. They
were ordered to rise and make way for others. Some of them screamed
and wrung their hands; some called loudly to the people and to the
Supreme Being to witness their innocence, some took the blow in
sullen silence. But Andr&eacute; took it with a gently mocking smile. It
had to come, and he was prepared. Death theses days was stalking
every man: it was bound to be his turn one day, and he was
prepared. From the hour when Robespierre and his horde of jackals
had attacked Danton the Lion and brought him down, from that hour
Andr&eacute;, the child of this revolution, knew that he, too, would be
its victim. For two months he had languished in prison waiting his
turn for the only possible release and dreaming of that wonderful
afternoon when first he knew that the woman he worshipped,
worshipped him too. So happy, so entrancing had been those hours of
supreme joy and love that he felt that Fate and he were quits. God
had given him everything, every joy, every happiness, supreme
contentment when He gave him this perfect mutual love. So what did
anything else matter? Death would only mean a union more
perfect&mdash;more enduring than anything that Life could give.</p>

<p>All this he tried to convey to Aurore with the last glance which
he was able to cast on her. "Do not grieve, my beloved! The
happiness which you gave me was too perfect for this earth, too
perfect to last."</p>

<p>Aurore watched him until he too disappeared down the stairs that
led to the guardroom. Then quickly she rose. There was one more
hope of seeing him, when that awful cart took him back to prison.
She could follow the cart, she could see him again, she could throw
him her last message of love in the gold locket which she always
carried&mdash;perhaps, even, she could touch his hand. Hastily
drawing the hood back over her head, she rose to go. The others
made way for her, helped her all they could. They murmured
sympathetic words as she stepped over the tribunes to find her way
out:</p>

<p>"Our Little Lady of Sorrows! So young! So pretty!"</p>

<p>"And that handsome husband!"</p>

<p>"Ah, me!"</p>

<p>"Where will it all end?"</p>

<p>There was a great crowd outside the gates, greater than usual,
Aurore thought, as feverishly she forged her way down the great
staircase and into the courtyard. The carts were there, ranged in a
file to the left of the gates which were wide open. The crowd was
dense round the carts. One had just gone with its batch of
condemned: the other was waiting by the postern gate. It was round
this one that the crowd was thickest. Aurore, with the
determination and courage of despair, pushed and struggled to get
near. But it was impossible: she was jostled and elbowed out of the
way until she found herself pressed against the iron railing, on
the stone base of which some of the throng had scrambled to get a
better view. The open gates were close by. From such a point of
vantage it would be possible to get a view of the prisoners in the
cart over the heads of the crown, and then, when the cart moved
away, to slip out by the gate in its wake. Some kindly person
helped Aurore to hoist herself up on the stone parapet.</p>

<p>There she stood and waited, all eyes, and with the locket
grasped tightly in her hand. She heard the people about her
talking.</p>

<p>"Those are the ones from the Blind Institution."</p>

<p>"And those from the School for the Deaf and Dumb."</p>

<p>They were pointing to a small group of men and women, two or
three score of them, who were gathered close around the cart.</p>

<p>"One of the prisoners taught in those institutions."</p>

<p>"Citizen Vallon. I knew him. A nephew of mine is blind. Vallon
did wonders with him."</p>

<p>"He taught the blind to see."</p>

<p>"And the deaf to hear."</p>

<p>"I suppose they have come to see the last of him."</p>

<p>"Poor creatures! What will become of them now?"</p>

<p>"Hush! Here they come!"</p>

<p>The prisoners were filing out of the building and were being
hustled into the cart. There were eight of them, five men, three
women. The men's coats were tied by the sleeves round their necks.
All had their arms tied with cord behind their backs. Andr&eacute; was the
last to step into the cart: at sight of him one part of the crowd
set up a cry, weird and inarticulate, the cry peculiar to the
tongue-tied and the dumb: it was taken up by the blind, who had not
seen but could guess. The blind called out piteously: "Do not leave
us in darkness, Citizen Vallon!" but the dumb could only utter
their hideous, inarticulate shrieks.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; stood up in the cart with his old military tunic tied
round his neck; his one arm was tied behind his back to the empty
sleeve of his shirt. His glance swept the crowd in search of his
beloved, and like a magnet her eyes drew his and held them for an
instant. Only a few seconds, though, for the next moment he saw
those poor afflicted wretches about him, and for the first time his
aching heart drew tears to his eyes.</p>

<p>"Vallon!" they moaned and cried. "Vallon!" like children calling
in distress to their mother.</p>

<p>The soldiers jostled them, tried to silence them by threats, but
they would not be moved, nor would they be silenced, until suddenly
out of the crowd behind them there rose a louder cry:</p>

<p>"You scurvy knave! You abominable hypocrite! At last, at last
you get your deserts! Scoundrel! Hellhound! Take that in
remembrance of those whom you have outraged!"</p>

<p>Aurore saw it all! It was her father, and Hector Talon was with
him. Charles de Marigny seemed to have cast all weakness aside, to
have suddenly found the vigour of youth through the power of his
hatred. It was amazing how he pushed his way through the crowd,
right up to the tumbril, and then, with a sudden spring, he put on
foot on the hub of the nearest wheel. He was brandishing a stick
with the obvious purpose of hitting at Andr&eacute;, when the crowd, taken
aback for the moment, seized him and dragged him down.</p>

<p>Aurore put her hand up to her mouth to smother a cry. Her father
had fallen backward, dragging Hector Talon down with him in his
fall. She could see nothing more than that, for the crowd was all
over him, and everything seemed confusion&mdash;confusion made
hideous by weird cries and imprecations. The people in the rear of
the crowd declared: "<i>C'est bien fait!</i>" It served the miscreant
right for trying to hit at a brave soldier who had lost one arm in
the defence of his country. The soldiers tried to restore order and
only succeeded in keeping back the crowd&mdash;the poor
afflicted&mdash;at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>Aurore's eyes wandered back to the tumbril in search of Andr&eacute;.
She clutched the gold locket with her last message of love, ready
to fling it to him. But she couldn't see him; be must have been
struck by the old maniac and fallen down, perhaps, on the floor of
the cart. She fingered the thing in her hand feverishly&mdash;and
suddenly was aware that the thing she fingered as unfamiliar in
shape and in weight. She looked down upon it. The gold locket was
not there; she had instead a crumpled, soiled piece of paper in her
hand; it was wrapped around something hard and rough, possibly a
stone. She couldn't think what it meant. What abandoned thief had
dared to filch her locket? And then a swift recollection went
though her mind like a flash. When she saw her father spring up on
the hub of the cart-wheel she had tried to smother a cry of horror
and had felt a firm, kindly hand grasping hers.</p>

<p>She had thought nothing of it at the moment, merely thought that
some gentle soul was trying to express mute sympathy. Instead of
this mysterious substitution! What could it mean? Was it? Could it
be from Andr&eacute;? Oh! if she could only see him. But there was the
crowd, the poor, miserable, afflicted crowd, trying in a futile way
to avenge an insult done to the man they revered. The soldiers,
reinforced by comrades, had pushed them well away. Aurore could not
see what had become of her father. Had he been trampled underfoot
by the infuriated mob? Had punishment overtaken him at the very
culmination of his treachery?</p>

<p>Just then there was another commotion. A wild, terrified shriek,
and Hector Talon was hoisted aloft by half-a-dozen strong arms and
then flung, still yelling, into the cart. Some people laughed. The
deaf and dumb who had seen gave a weird cry of content. The
sergeant in command cast a final glance on the tumbril.</p>

<p>"Allons!" he called with stolid indifference. "The batch is
complete! Eight sheep for Citizen Samson to-morrow."</p>

<p>Then he gave the word of command: "<i>En avant</i>," and the
cart-wheels creaked on their axles as the horses began to move.</p>

<p>And Andr&eacute;! Aurore could not see Andr&eacute;! Not even now when the
tumbril turned out of the gates so close to her. The crowd surged
in its wake, mostly in silence, though the poor blind who were
nearest to the cart continued to call on Vallon, while the
tongue-tied, uttering unintelligible sounds, hung on to them and
tried hard to explain that Vallon, Vallon, their father and their
mother and their friend, was no longer there.</p>

<p>Aurore, more dead than alive, had scrambled down fro the
parapet. The crowd was perceptibly thinner. A few soldiers were
rounding up the poor afflicted. The others, for the most part, hung
about waiting to see the next batch of prisoners file out. Only a
few followed the tumbril, from which could still be heard the
agonized yells of Hector Talon. In a few more minutes the vast
courtyard seemed almost peaceful. Just a few people waiting about
in small groups here and there. The spectacle of the day was not
yet over. There would be at least another five tumbrils to watch.
The blind and the deaf and dumb, the wretched and the poor, had
drifted away. Wither? No doubt this fraternal government knew. Was
this not the millennium so confidently foretold?</p>

<p>The soldiers had restored order. They had done it at the point
of the bayonet, driving the afflicted away like useless sheep unfit
even for the knacker. They had also apparently dragged away the
inaniment and lifeless bodies of those who had been unfortunately
or luckily succumbed in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Among these was the body of a
man who had once been styled Monseigneur le Duc de Marigny, one of
the proudest names in France, who once had power of life and death
over his fellow men and could toy with the honour of any poor wench
who happened to please his eye. His mangled body lay now in the
guardroom of the Palace, so-called of Justice; the naked feet of a
score of unwashed rabble had trampled the life out of him. Not even
decently covered with a sheet, the illustrious remains of a
descendant of kinds was destined for a pauper's grave.</p>

<p>But all this Aurore only found out later. Her thoughts, for the
moment, were far enough away from her father who had done her such
a great&mdash;such an irreparable injury. She had found a deserted
corner in an angle of the building, and here, unseen by prying
eyes, she unfolded the paper which had so mysteriously been thrust
into her hand. And this is what was written thereon:</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; is safe! Go home and wait for him. Silence and discretion
above all.</p>

<p>And below there was the device of a small five-petalled flower
roughly tinted scarlet.</p>

<p>And that was all. Aurore, dazed and puzzled, marvelled if she
were dreaming now or if the rest of this day had been a hideous
nightmare. If, when she woke anon, she would find herself inside
the gates of an earthly paradise or of an unendurable hell? Andr&eacute;'s
safe! Where? When? How? BY whose agency had he been snatched from
out the jaws of death? How and why had God interfered to prevent
the monstrous holocaust?</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; safe? Could it be true? Did such heavenly things happen in
these days of darkness, of doubt and misery?</p>

<p>And all the while that these doubts, fears, conjectures,
alternated in Aurore's mind, with the wildest, most unbelievable
hope, she was running home, running like one urged by hope or
driven by despair.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; safe! And Paris looked just the same! The quays, the
river, the pavements, the people passing by as if nothing had
happened. Was life going on just the same, then? If so, surely it
could not be true that Andr&eacute; was safe.</p>

<p>Marie wondered what had happened to the Citizeness. Her habitual
sadness have given place to a febrile restlessness. She seem unable
to sit still. For hours she wandered from room to room, up and
down, taking no rest. She tried to eat, but food, apparently,
choked her.</p>

<p>Marie asked questions but received no answer. She feared,
indeed, that the Citizeness was sick with the fever. She suggestion
bed, and toward ten o'clock Aurore agreed to lie down, but only on
condition that Marie herself went to bed. She certainly was in a
fever then, with cheeks aflame and hands cold as ice. But she did
make pretence to go to bed, drank the orange-flower water which
Marie had prepared, and promised to go to sleep.</p>

<p>She waited, quiet as a mouse, until no sound save a comfortable
snore came from Marie's room. The good soul had taken to snoring of
late, and many a time had the sound set Aurore's nerves on edge.
But to-night she welcomed it. Half-past ten. She crept noiselessly
out of bed and put on her clothes again. She lit a candle and with
it tiptoed out to the vestibule. She set the candle on the table,
and she drew the bolt of the front door, leaving it ajar. She
pulled a chair close to the door, sat down and waited...Waited,
wide-eyed and expectant, as she had waited, day after day, these
two months past in the Hall of the Palais de Justice.</p>

<p>A few minutes after midnight she heard a footstep on the stairs.
No need to make a guess as to whose it was: she would have known it
among hundreds of thousands. She left the door ajar and went back
into the parlour. She sat down in the big armchair. The room was
all dark save for the dim light cast in by the flickering candle in
the vestibule.</p>

<p>And thus he found her, waiting for him and ready, with arms held
out so that he could pillow his tired head against her warm bosom.
She gathered him in her arms with that loving tenderness which is
the essence of a good woman's passionate love. Her first kiss was
on his hair; then only did her lips find his.</p>

<p>Of danger and death, of rescue or safety, there was no talk. All
that he said was, "<i>Ma mie</i>!" as, cheek, to cheek, they sat there in
the big armchair, forgetful of the world, forgetful of everything
save of their love.</p>

<h2><a name="ch43" id="ch43"></a>Chapter 43</h2>

<p>Two days later Maximilien Robespierre and his satellites
perished in their turn on the guillotine; that 26th day of July
which had meant life or death to Aurore and Andr&eacute; had also meant
life or death to the most bloodthirsty tyrant the civilized world
has ever known. It was the first eclipse of his power and of his
popularity. Swift as had been his rise, his fall from the giddy
heights of dictatorship was swifter still. The same throats, which
less than a couple of months ago had yelled themselves hoarse with
praise of Robespierre as second only to the Supreme Being, now
shouted execrations on the fallen tyrant.</p>

<p>Terrified for their own lives his enemies had made a super-human
effort to drag him down. It was he or they, his head or theirs. In
the pocket of his coat taken off at the club because the night was
very hot had been found a list of names to be indicted on the
morrow, names of men to be accused, tried, and condemned. They were
the names of the most influential men in the National Convention,
Tallien's at the head. It was their life or his, and they put forth
all their strength, all their terror, and all their eloquence to
bring him down. And they succeeded. On the 26th of July the tyrant
was indicted for treason against the Republic; on the 27th, he was
dragged, wounded and almost dying, to the bar of the accused; on
the 28th, at even, he died on the guillotine.</p>

<p>His death was inglorious and sordid, but it marked an epoch. As
if by a magic wand the whole aspect of France was changed.
Terrorism died in as many days as it had taken years to maintain
itself. Within twenty-four hours the Convention, free from tyranny
and from fear of death, passed a law that every man or woman
indicted for treason and conspiracy must be served with a Writ of
Accusation so that they might know of what they were accused.
Prisoners were liberated by the hundred. Houses of Detention were
emptied. Justice once more put on the semblance of a bandage over
he eyes and held the scales with a steady hand.</p>

<p>And while Andr&eacute; and Aurore dreamed their dream of love in the
sunny apartment of the Quai de la Ferraille, the aspect of France
was changed. Life went on, but no longer the same, for there was
hope in every heart, even though hope was often linked with
incurable sorrow.</p>

<p>And that is the end of the story which Sir Percy Blakeney,
Bart., told to His Royal Highness that evening in the Assembly
Rooms at Bath.</p>

<p>"A fine fellow, your Andr&eacute; Vallon," His Royal Highness remarked.
"What became of him?"</p>

<p>"He was duly served with a Writ of Accusation, brought to the
bar, and acquitted. He has taken up his work again with the blind
and the deaf and dumb."</p>

<p>"And he and your lovely Aurore spin the thread of perfect love
in their apartment on the Quai de la Ferraille, is that it?"</p>

<p>"I should say as perfect as I have ever seen, sir," Blakeney
remarked with a smile.</p>

<p>"Outside your own, you lucky dog!" His Royal Highness rejoined
with a sigh. "But what happened to that rascal, Hector Talon?"</p>

<p>"He was indicted for false accusations against a patriot. His
name appeared below that of Charles de Marigny on the letter which
denounced Vallon to the Committee of Public Safety which has now
ceased to exist. He died a very inglorious death just a week after
he had hoped to see his old enemy go up the steps of the
guillotine."</p>

<p>"Did the daughter ever recover her father's body for decent
burial?"</p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" His Royal Highness concluded. "I'll grant you,
Blakeney, that for a child of that awful revolution, your friend
Vallon has come out of the flames unscathed."</p>
