  <p class="first">YESTERDAY again I stood and looked at Hargen Hall from the
  lake; and it is this that has brought me to write of my life in it. Wintry
  winds were whistling through the withered bracken and the branches, whirling
  withered birch-leaves about the south quadrangle; and no birds sang.</p>

  <p>When I first entered it I was a girl, one might say&mdash;gay enough; but
  now I have known what one never forgets; and the days and the hairs grow grey
  together.</p>

  <p>Five titled names among my friends gained me an entrance to Hargen in the
  fall of the year '08. I arrived on the evening of 10 th November; and shall
  never forget the strangeness of the impression made on my mind that night:
  for even ere I rounded into sight of the house, the sound of the waters far
  off filled me with a feeling of the eerily dreary&mdash;the house being
  almost surrounded with mountain and cliff, down which a series of cascades
  shower; and that night I had some difficulty in catching quite everything
  that was said to me, though in two or three days, maybe, my ear became used
  to the tumult.</p>

  <p>It was four days before I met Sir Philip Lister himself&mdash;Davenport,
  the old butler, told me that his master was "indisposed"&mdash;but Sir Philip
  sent me a polite missive inviting me to take things carelessly a little: so I
  spent the first days in learning my pupil's moods, and in roaming over the
  place, from "Queen Elizabeth's Room"&mdash;behind the bed still hung a velvet
  shield broidered with the royal arms in white wire&mdash;to the apes and the
  cascades. A sense of forlornness pervaded it all, for scarcely ten of us were
  in all the desert of that place, with an occasional glimpse of two or three
  gardeners, or a groom. The kitchen was now a panelled hall like a chapel,
  with windows of painted glass containing the six coats-of-arms of the Lister
  Lynns, a hall in whose vastness the cook and her assistant looked awfully
  forlorn and small; and hardly even a housemaid ever now entered all that part
  of the east wing which had been singed by a fire fifty-five years since.</p>

  <p>It was on the fourth forenoon, a day of "the Indian summer," that my pupil
  took me to see the apes. There were three of them&mdash;two chimpanzees, one
  gibbon&mdash;in three rooms of wire-netting close to the east line of cliffs,
  i.e., about six hundred yards from the house. There, chuckling and chattering
  in the shadow of chestnuts, they lived their lives, anon speculating like
  philosophers upon their knots, or hearkening to the waters which chanted near
  in their ears. And there was a fourth room of netting in the row, but empty;
  as to which my pupil said to me:</p>

  <p>"The one that used to be in this fourth room was huge, Miss Newnes, and
  had a pale face. He died some time before I came to Hargen: but his ghost
  walks when the moon is at the full."</p>

  <p>"Now Esmé," I muttered. (Her name was Esmé Martagon, daughter of the
  Marquis de Martagon and of Margaret Lister, Sir Philip's sister; the child
  being at this time twelve years of age, and an orphan&mdash;a rather pretty
  elf with ebon curls, but as changeable as the shapes of mercury, now bursting
  with alacrity, and now cursed with black turns of sadness.)</p>

  <p>"But if I have seen it?" she gravely replied, gazing up at me with her
  great eyes.</p>

  <p>"The ghost of an ape, Esmé," I muttered.</p>

  <p>For answer, flying off into vivacity, she cried to me:</p>

  <p>"Come, you shall hear it!"&mdash;and she led the way northward through the
  park, until we walked down a dark path tremulous with spray, where one of the
  smaller waterfalls came down. By stepping on the tops of rocks in its froth,
  one could get, in the rear of the torrent, into a grot, where the greenery
  grew very vigorous and gay from the perpetual spray; and when I had followed
  Esmé's career into this hollow in the rock, she hollaed into my ear in
  opposition to the tons of thunder sounding down: "Now, listen a little: this
  one is named 'The Ape.'"</p>

  <p>For some minutes&mdash;three to six&mdash;I heard nothing but the burden
  of the cascade's murmur, and was now about to say something sceptical, when
  there sounded what I am bound to say affected me in a rather startling
  way&mdash;a sound very sharp and energetic&mdash;the chuckle, chuckle of a
  monkey&mdash;most pressing, most imperative, in its summons to the attention.
  It was over in a moment; but presently came again: and in the course of half
  an hour's listening it came altogether five times, not quite at regular
  intervals, but still with a kind of periodicity: and I concluded that some
  small cause, perhaps only a condition of the wind, acted ever and anon to
  modify the cataract's tract, and produce this curious cackling.</p>

  <p>My pupil hollaed to me: "And if you kept on waiting to hear, and listening
  to it, do you know what would happen to you, Miss Newnes?"&mdash;and when I
  asked what, she called:</p>

  <p>"You would go stark mad!"</p>

  <p>"Not I," I said.</p>

  <p>One of the shadows darkened the child's face; and presently she remarked:
  "I should, I know."</p>

  <p>"Three of the ladies of the Listers, and one of the Lynns,
  have&mdash;among them my mother's mother.</p>

  <p>"It is in the blood, I think."</p>

  <p>I started!&mdash;for I now suddenly believed her. Indeed, to my
  consciousness, there was something ironic in the torrent's chuckle, and at
  once, taking the child's hand, I said: "Come."</p>

  <p>Late in the day when we were together in what is called "the Great Hall,"
  Esmé, ever sage beyond her age, again spoke of the chuckling cascade, begging
  me not to mention or show it to her Cousin Huggins when he came: for a young
  man of this name, who had hardly been at Hargen since he was six, was coming
  from India in some months, and was expected to spend a month with us.</p>

  <p>It was that night that, for the first time, I saw Sir Philip Lister: for
  he dined with Esmé and Mrs.</p>

  <p>Wiseman and me in the main building dining-room, the old Davenport waiting
  upon us in state with his silent footsteps, we five making a pretty
  insignificant group in that great room, whose array of windows have a south
  aspect upon the south quadrangle.</p>

  <p>It has (or had) tapestry all round, and rows of Jacobean carving-tables,
  which give the room an air of very gloomy state; and a wood-fire bickered on
  the iron-work fire-back, under whose oak over-mantel Sir Philip sat with Esmé
  and me ten minutes, then took himself away into his own sequestered nook of
  the house.</p>

  <p>Two days after this he again had dinner with us, and again the day after
  that; but that third time the child, in one of her chatterbox fits, chanced
  to observe that "Uncle Philip is lending his presence since Miss Newnes has
  come"&mdash;and, like a bird that shies, Sir Philip showed himself no more to
  us for many days.</p>

  <p>I regretted this, for his presence interested me, his manners were in such
  a high degree grave, dignified, and gracious. He was big, and, if not
  handsome, interesting to the eye&mdash;quaint, one might say&mdash;his face
  smooth like an actor's, his hair longer than usual, with great owl-eyes,
  whose glowering underlook was thronged, to my thinking, with mysteries of
  sorrow&mdash;something shifting, though, uncandidly shy, in them. His age I
  guessed to be about forty-five.</p>

  <p>He was engaged in the writing of what I heard was "a great work," six
  volumes long, on "The Old Kingdom" (fourth of sixth dynasty of Egyptian
  Kings), and lived a life of such privacy, that it was three weeks ere I met
  him afresh. Meantime, Esmé and I entered upon the course of our adventurous
  studies&mdash;"adventurous," for never for two hours together was my pupil
  the same girl. Esmé had fits of headache; and she had fits of reading, when
  she feasted upon volumes with a hungry vulture's greed; and she had fits of
  indolence, dormouse torpors, fits of crying, dark-minded lamentations, fits
  of flightiness, of crazy dissipation, of craving for&mdash;wine. As for her
  knowledge, it was astonishing in such a child, and she anon plied me with
  queries to which I could find no reply.</p>

  <p>On a forenoon in the fourth week, when she was feeling out of sorts, we
  were sauntering in the park, when, for once, I saw Sir Philip out of doors.
  We came upon him with his face against the ape-house netting, gazing in at
  the gibbon&mdash;so eagerly, that we were near him ere he seemed to hear us.
  When he suddenly saw us, he stood struck into a posture as of suspense, but
  presently was very affable in his reserved manner, and conversed with me some
  minutes about the apes and their various traits. They had the names of
  Egyptian kings, the chimpanzees being Pepy II, and Khety, and the gibbon Sety
  I; and at the gibbon Sir Philip shook his finger, saying with a playful
  solemnity: "That fellow! That fellow!"&mdash;I had no idea what he meant.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, in the midst of our talk, he&mdash;with a certain awkwardness of
  his lids&mdash;proposed a picnic-luncheon out of doors to which Esmé and I
  readily assented. But three minutes afterwards he started, furtively
  murmuring the words: "I must be getting back to work," and was gone&mdash;to
  my astonishment!</p>

  <p>After this he again made himself very scarce for three weeks. Esmé and I,
  meantime, got into the habit of spending our hours of labour in the great
  hall, sitting on a day-bed that lay in the solar-room gallery there&mdash;the
  gallery from which of old one gazed down upon the retainers at table below;
  and those days of my life, that I whiled away in that place, are to me at
  present days touched with much strangeness and a tone of Utopia. But the
  great place was quite plain and empty&mdash;a plain ceiling, plain white
  walls, oak-panelled half-way up: only, as it was lighted by fourteen great
  windows with shields of painted glass, when the sun glowed through them, it
  transfigured that old room into glory-land. . . . But it is gone from me now
  like a dream, and I shall not see it again.</p>

  <p>It was on the Thursday afternoon of my thirteenth week at Hargan that I
  received from Sir Philip Lister a singular missive: he had injured his thumb,
  he said, and wished to know if I would "kindly write from his dictation." But
  what, then, I asked myself, was to become of Esmé meantime? I did not wish to
  leave the child! However, I could not say no: and so entered that day the
  sacred den. He, with his fingers in a sling, instantly jumped up with a gush
  of apologies, showering upon me a thousand thanks that were at once gushing
  and shy, till the shyness triumphed, and he was suddenly silent and done.
  Then, I sitting at an old abbey-table, he on an old farm-house settle, he
  dictated to me with his eyes closed, in a low tone, all about Khufu, and
  Khafra, and the things of "the Pyramid Age," until I had the impression that
  he was himself something Egyptian and most ancient, and I with him, and in
  which age of the world we were I was not at some moments certain. In the
  midst of the dictating he all at once pressed his left palm upon his
  forehead, as if tired or muddled, his eyes tight shut; and, jumping up, he
  muttered to me, "thank you! thank you!" offering me his hand. Some of his
  actions had a wonderful swiftness and suddenness; and that hand of his which
  I touched was as chill as snow: so that I made haste from him.</p>

  <p>That night I retired, as usual, soon after eleven to my room, which was in
  a rather remote and lonely region of the house; and was soon asleep. Two
  hours later I awoke terrified&mdash;I could not quite tell why&mdash;but so
  terrified, that I found myself sitting up in bed&mdash;with a singular sound,
  or the memory or dream of a singular sound, lingering about my ears: and I
  was trembling, my brow was wet with sweat. Through my two windows, which
  stood open, shone the full moon's light, lying over the floor, lighting the
  stamp-work tapestry on my right; and I could hear the night-breeze breathing
  drearily through the leaves of the cedar, some of whose branches, held up
  with chains, brushed my panes. For some minutes I sat so, hearing my heart
  beating in my ears, the breezes shivering through the tree, the streams
  showering, the soundlessness of the house and hour, and as conscious of some
  living spirit hovering round me as though I saw it. If it had lasted long, I
  must have lost consciousness, or else cast off the oppression of it with a
  shriek: but presently something reached my ear&mdash;a chuckle, a little
  giggle of glee, just distinct enough to convince me that it was due to no
  lunacy of my ear: and immediately, with a creeping in my hair, but a species
  of rage and desperation elevating me, I was out of bed, and at one of the
  windows: for just after the chuckle a sharp rush through the leafage of the
  cedar seemed to reach me, and I rushed to see.</p>

  <p>What I saw made me faint&mdash;whether instantly or after some seconds I
  cannot say: I know that when I came to my senses I was seated on the floor
  with my forehead leaning on my old oak chair, and the tower-clock was now
  sounding the hour of three. But however soon I may have swooned after seeing
  it, it was not so instantly that I could have the slightest doubt as to the
  actualness of what my eyes saw. For though the moonlight left the interior
  regions of the tree's leafage in some obscurity, I was sure that some brute
  of the ape species with a pale face was hanging there in the
  cedar&mdash;hanging head-downward among the network of chains and branches in
  such a way as to see into my chamber; and I have an impression of
  hearing&mdash;either before I fell, or through my swoon afterwards&mdash;a
  succession of chucklings; and then a voice somewhere remonstrating, pleading,
  commanding, in a secret species of shout; and then a strangled outcry of
  horror, of anguish, somewhere, all mingled with a dream of the chuckle of the
  chuckling stream.</p>

  <p>But the strongest of my impressions was undoubtedly that drowning outcry
  of horror&mdash;an impression so strong, that I could hardly believe it to be
  a dream, or all a dream. This cry was somehow connected in my mind from the
  first with old Davenport; and this feeling was confirmed in me when Davenport
  was nowhere to be seen the next day, nor for four days after.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wiseman, the housekeeper, who for days was pale, and occasionally
  fell into a vacant staring, told me that Davenport was "suffering." She asked
  me no questions as to the night, but I twice caught her eye piercingly bent
  upon me with a meaning of inquiry, of anxiety, in it; and the same thing was
  true of Sir Philip when, three days later, he appeared towards evening: for
  he took my hand with a tender solicitude, and a lingering look of question in
  his gaze. As for Davenport, when I next saw him it was under a tree in the
  park, where he sat like a convalescent, in his flesh that pathetic pallor of
  the flesh of aged people who have passed through an illness; and the
  wrappings round his neck could not wholly hide from my eyes that his throat
  had been most brutally bruised.</p>

  <p>During those days it was as if a blow had fallen upon Hargen. Esmé no
  longer laughed, and a lower tone of talk overtook us all. It was obvious that
  each held the consciousness of a secret which none dared breathe to another;
  and in vain I consumed days of musing in seeking to see into the meaning of
  these things. For my part, I was ailing, nor could quite hide it. I had the
  thought of moving out of my room, which I now shrank from entering even in
  the day-time, but did not care to show so openly that I was afraid. Through
  the nights I burned a light, but slept with my nerves awake. Not that I was
  ever of a very nervous temperament, I think: but terror infected me like a
  sickness in those days; the stare of eyes of affright in the night was ever
  present in my imagination; and Hargen soon grew to be to my haunted heart the
  very home of gloom. Then one day, on a sudden, all this trouble of mind
  rushed away from me like a shadow; and my being galloped into a mood of
  gladness in which gloom was abolished, and I forgot to be appalled in the
  dark.</p>

  <p>I will tell of it very briefly. It happened that one afternoon when Esmé
  and I were sitting listlessly in that solar-room gallery, an open grammar
  lying idle between us, suddenly behind us, there rose out of the floor, as it
  seemed, a young man who clapped his fingers over Esmé's eyes, smiling with me
  the while. "Cousin Huggins!" the child cried out&mdash;much surprised, for
  Huggins Lister was not expected at Hargen for some days yet. He caught her up
  in his big arms, and bussed her like a gun, for he was a being made all of
  ardours and horse-play: and then he looked into my eyes, and I looked into
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>It was as if I had always known him&mdash;long before I was born; and what
  hurried me more into the sort of maelstrom in which I was now caught was the
  circumstance, that on the day after that first day Esmé took a chill,
  remained in bed, and I was all alone with Huggins Lister in that wilderness
  of Hargen. The young man was, or pretended to be, interested in old things,
  and would have me show him all the cassone and old needlework, the Spanish
  glasses giving their glints of gold, the old girandoles with their amorini.
  He dined with me, we two alone, and Mrs. Wiseman: for Sir Philip more than
  ever kept himself to himself.</p>

  <p>Only, on the fourth evening when Huggins Lister and I were walking in the
  park, Sir Philip suddenly appeared before us, walking with precipitate steps
  the other way; did not pause, nor utter a sound, as he passed by us with a
  bowed brow, his hat raised; but when he had gone some way beyond us, he
  stopped, and&mdash;shook his finger at us! was going, too, I am sure, to
  venture to say something, but failed; and suddenly was gone on his way again.
  I remember being very offended at the moment: but a moment more, God forgive
  me, had forgotten that Sir Philip Lister lived.</p>

  <p>I showed the young man the apes, and the Queen's Room, and the cascades,
  save one, and the ivory inlay of the two Spanish chests, and the Tudor
  fireplaces, and what was in "the long gallery"; and still he wished to see
  things. And just under the window that lights the great staircase, there
  stands on the landing a sedan-chair painted with glaring variegations, the
  window-glass casting the gauds of the six coats-of-arms of the Lister-Lynns
  upon the already gaudy chair: in which chair he got me to sit&mdash;it was
  high noon, on the open stair, but we were as solitary there as if night
  veiled us in a monastery; and, indeed, all that waste of Hargen seemed but
  made to beguile and mislead our feet to our fate&mdash;he got me to sit in
  it, I say, and then, having me well in his bondage in the sedan-chair, began
  to sob to me with passion; and when I hid away my face for pity of him there
  in his passion on his knees, and dashed one wild tear from my eyes, the young
  man ravished my lips with his lips, there in the chair on the stair that day.
  I could not help it, for in respect of me Huggins Lister came, and saw, and
  conquered! and I was as one drugged with honey-dew, and dancing drugged, in
  Huggins Lister's hands.</p>

  <p>Also, the young man persuaded like a hurricane! and hurried me as madly
  into marriage as those sand-forms of the sand-storm which madly waltz into
  oneness. Within six months, he said, he would arrange everything so as to
  proclaim the marriage; but meantime it must be secret, and must be immediate!
  Against this tyranny I made a feint of resistance; but half-heartedly; and it
  availed me nothing: indeed, he was dear to me, and near, and had me all in
  the hollow of his hand and heart. And so one forenoon I stole out of Hargen
  gates, and met him at a house in St. Arvens townlet, the place of our
  marriage; but, as we were passing out, married, from the door of the house,
  my heart bounded into my mouth to see Sir Philip Lister walking hardly ten
  yards away. Yes, he who never left home was there before my eyes in the broad
  light in St. Arvens street with his oak-stick&mdash;walking away from us,
  indeed, seeming unaware of our presence: yet I have an impression, too, of
  his head half-turned toward us a moment, of a face ashen with agitation: and
  my heart, for all its warmth, shivered as with a mortal chill in me.</p>

  <p>My reeling feet led me back to Hargen in a kind of dream, a wedded wife,
  as wild with thoughts as with wine that day, for I was my beloved's, and he
  was mine: and in what way I spent that day I could not say, since I was new
  in heaven, and can but remember my fruitless efforts to hide from Esmé's eyes
  the state of my mind: for she had lately risen from her ailment, and I made a
  pretence of study with her, and I was severe with my dear, denying him my
  presence until the evening; and even then retired betimes, leaving him
  sighing.</p>

  <p>My chamber-door I barricaded with a chair&mdash;a bridal childishness,
  since, to secure the room, I should have locked it. And I lay awake for a
  long hour, looking at the luminosity of the full moon, until, wearied out by
  the reel of my day's dream, I fell into a brief sleep.</p>

  <p>From this a roar awoke me: and may a sound like that sound never more come
  to me to summon me with its trump. I understood that some soul was in
  extremis, and out of the deeps of grief and horror was horridly appealing to
  his God; and, finding myself on the ground, I knelt one wild second, crying
  aloud: "Almighty God, guard my love from harm in this house of horror." A
  moment more I had thrown a gown round me, and was gone out of the door.</p>

  <p>As I ran along the corridor, trying to strike a light to the candle that I
  carried, there seemed to reach my ear from somewhere a chuckle very hushed
  and low, like the jackal chattering over its carrion; and my fingers were so
  shaken by this thing, that they failed to bring the match into relation with
  the candle's wick. When the heat reached my hand I dashed down the match.
  Still running, I lit another&mdash;or half lit it: for in the instant when
  the match fused at the scratch, saw&mdash;-or in some manner knew&mdash;that
  some mad and monstrous animal was with me; at the same moment the match went
  out, or was puffed out; and a thing most chilly cold touched my skin. I felt
  pain then, the pain of the awe of the darkness; and I stood palsied. But
  within some seconds, I think, I was rushing afresh toward the corridor-end,
  without the candlestick now, which had dropped from me; so that I could not
  see that the portal at the end, which I expected to be open as usual, was
  shut; and I rushed with a shock upon it. It was not only shut, but
  locked!&mdash;finding which, I, standing there, piled the passion of my whole
  soul into cry on cry, crying "Huggins! Sir Philip! Davenport! Huggins!" then
  I stood, hearing the streams murmuring as through eternity in the silence of
  the night, and the strong knocking of my heart against my side&mdash;but no
  reply to my calls.</p>

  <p>This was not very astonishing, as my room was in such a solitary part of
  the mansion: and I stood imprisoned, suffering, expecting every second the
  coming upon me of that which would strike me dead with fright. The stillness
  lasted half a minute, perhaps, and then I became aware of a sound outside the
  door, a bumping going down the stairs in a regular way, like something
  massive being dragged down, with bump, bump, bump: and such was the solemnity
  and mystery of this thing to me in my solitude there in that gruesome gloom,
  that to linger any longer there in my pain soon grew to be impossible to me;
  and before I knew what I was doing I was out of a window, moving along a
  ledge fifty feet aloft toward the next window. The ledge was scarcely more
  than a foot wide, I think, and how I dared it, and why I did not fall, I
  can't now say. With my nose close to the wall&mdash;conscious all the time of
  drizzle tossed by high winds, conscious of the night full of a wild light,
  though the moon was quite hidden&mdash;I stepped flutteringly along over thin
  snow in dizzy suspense, keeping my sob until I should reach the next window:
  and there, as I leapt, I gave it vent, and fainted at my safety. I did not
  cease to hear, though, the bumping sound going down; and when it got to the
  bottom, something in me gave me the dauntlessness of heart to go after
  it.</p>

  <p>Down I crept, haltingly, crouching, stair by stair. Halfway down I seemed
  to hear something being dragged over the floor below. I went on down. The
  sound had now gone out through a doorway, and I knew which doorway; but as I
  followed that way, my bare toes struck upon something cold, and I dropped
  upon my hands over it. I moaned then for pity of myself, because it was dark,
  and because I did so suffer. But I was conscious, as I dropped, of a rattle
  of matches, for I still had the match-box in my hand, without knowing that I
  had it: and the desire took me to strike a light. It was some time, though,
  before I would, or could, and when I eventually ventured, I saw the sight of
  the body of the old butler in his night-attire lying wildly before me on the
  floor: and I knew by a look that was in his eyes that they were for ever
  sightless.</p>

  <p>At the same moment I was aware of the slamming of a door some way off; and
  again I knew which door&mdash;the little side-portal by the kitchen-entrance,
  leading out northward into the park&mdash;-and again something gave vigour to
  my knees, and lifted my feet, to go to see. I made my way to the little
  portal; opened it slowly; my soles were out on the snow. And before me on the
  short gravel-path going north into the park I distinctly saw the pale ape,
  bearing a body against his breast. A moment later he laid down his heavy
  load, and bent over it; and when I saw him horribly muttering over it,
  something in me stooped, took up a stone, and threw it at the brute.</p>

  <p>It went straight to his head.</p>

  <p>After some seconds the creature raised himself slowly, and raced with
  reeling feet into the darkness of the park.</p>

  <p>I staggered then to the body, and saw that it was Huggins Lister
  strangled; and on the body of my beloved my senses left me.</p>

  <p>It was ten in the day before I knew anything more; and then I lay on a
  bed, on one side of it Esmé, on the other side Mrs. Wiseman.</p>

  <p>The latter had a fixed stare; and from the manner in which Esmé was
  smiling, with her face held sideward, while she persistently counted on her
  fingers, I could make out that the child was now insane.</p>

  <p>I lay still, I said nothing; little I cared.</p>

  <p>Presently a girl named Bertha entered to murmur the words: "He isn't found
  yet"; and from some words murmured in reply by Mrs. Wiseman, I gathered that
  Sir Philip Lister had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Little I cared, I lay still and sullen, with closed lids.</p>

  <p>Near noon again came the news that the men seeking for Sir Philip Lister
  could even yet discover no trace of him; but at about live in the evening he
  was found dying in the hollow of the rock that lies behind the cascade that
  they call "The Ape," and was brought to the Hall.</p>

  <p>Very soon afterwards Mrs. Wiseman, who had then left my side, flew in
  again to me with crying eyes, imploring me to try and go for a moment to the
  dying man, who was hungering to have one sight of me; and I let her throw
  some clothes over me, and was led by her to the death-bed.</p>

  <p>By this time I knew&mdash;for Mrs. Wiseman during the day had revealed it
  to me in a flood of tears&mdash;that Sir Philip Lister's mother had too much
  listened to the chuckling cascade, and so had borne him the being he
  was&mdash;a being capable at any agitation of shedding his human nature to
  resume the nature of the brute, and hurling away human raiment with his human
  nature in the murderous turbulence of his nocturnal revels&mdash;he who in my
  eyes had been so perfect in gentleness, so shy, so staid! But none the less I
  shuddered to the soul when he touched my hand to pant at me through the
  death-ruckle rolling in his throat: "I have loved you well"&mdash;a shudder
  which perhaps saved me from death or from madness, for I had lapsed that day
  into a mad apathy. It was nearly night then, and the light in there was very
  dreary; but I could still see that the hair which overgrew the ogre's frame
  was considerably more than an inch deep&mdash;greenish, and gross as the
  gorilla's. It clasped him round the throat and round the wrists in lines
  perfectly defined, like a perfect coat of fur that he wore; and it did not
  thin, but continued no less thick where it abruptly ended than everywhere
  else.</p>

  <p>But he had "loved me well," and I him now&mdash;for if he had been
  perniciously jealous, it was for love of me that he had been jealous; and in
  dying he looked into my eyes with human eyes, kindly, mildly, looking "I have
  loved you well"; and when with his last strength he pointed to where the
  pebble I had flung had sunk into his skull, then I lifted my voice and wept
  to God because of him, and myself, and Hargen Hall and all, not caring any
  longer if my face was buried in the horror of his hairy breast. And so he
  died, and Huggins Lister, and I was left alive.</p>
