<p class="first"> NOW, in the days when Ugh-lomi killed the
great cave bear there was little trouble between the horses
and men. Indeed, they lived apart&mdash;the men in the
river swamps and thickets, the horses on the wide grassy
uplands between the chestnuts and the pines. Sometimes a
pony would come straying into the clogging marshes to make
a flint-hacked meal, and sometimes the tribe would find
one, the kill of a lion, and drive off the jackals, and
feast heartily while the sun was high. These horses of the
old time were clumsy at the fetlock and dun-coloured, with
a rough tail and big head. They came every spring-time
north-westward into the country, after the swallows and
before the hippopotami, as the grass on the wide downland
stretches grew long. They came only in small bodies thus
far, each herd, a stallion and two or three mares and a
foal or so, having its own stretch of country, and they
went again when the chestnut trees were yellow and the
wolves came down the Wealden mountains.</p>

<p>It was their custom to graze right out in the open,
going into cover only in the heat of the day. They avoided
the long stretches of thorn and beechwood, preferring an
isolated group of trees, void of ambuscade, so that it was
hard to come upon them. They were never fighters; their
heels and teeth were for one another, but in the clear
country, once they were started, no living thing came near
them, though perhaps the elephant might have done so, had
he felt the need. And in those days man seemed a harmless
thing enough. No whisper of prophetic intelligence told the
species of the terrible slavery that was to come, of the
whip and spur and bearing-rein, the clumsy load and the
slippery street, the insufficient food, and the knacker's
yard, that was to replace the wide grass-land and the
freedom of the earth.</p>

<p>Down in the Wey marshes Ugh-lomi and Eudena had never
seen the horses closely, but now they saw them every day
as the two of them raided out from their lair on the ledge
in the gorge, raiding together in search of food. They had
returned to the ledge after the killing of Andoo; for of
the she-bear they were not afraid. The she-bear had become
afraid of them, and when she winded them she went aside.
The two went together everywhere; for since they had left
the tribe Eudena was not so much Ugh-lomi's woman as his
mate; she learnt to hunt even&mdash;as much, that is, as
any woman could. She was indeed a marvellous woman. He
would lie for hours watching a beast, or planning catches
in that shock head of his, and she would stay beside him,
with her bright eyes upon him, offering no irritating
suggestions&mdash;as still as any man. A wonderful
woman!</p>

<p>At the top of the cliff was an open grassy lawn and
then beechwoods, and going through the beechwoods one came
to the edge of the rolling grassy expanse, and in sight
of the horses. Here, on the edge of the wood and bracken,
were the rabbit-burrows, and here among the fronds Eudena
and Ugh-lomi would lie with their throwing-stones ready,
until the little people came out to nibble and play in the
sunset. And while Eudena would sit, a silent figure of
watchfulness, regarding the burrows, Ugh-lomi's eyes were
ever away across the greensward at those wonderful grazing
strangers.</p>

<p>In a dim way he appreciated their grace and their supple
nimbleness. As the sun declined in the evening-time, and
the heat of the day passed, they would become active, would
start chasing one another, neighing, dodging, shaking their
manes, coming round in great curves, sometimes so close
that the pounding of the turf sounded like hurried thunder.
It looked so fine that Ugh-lomi wanted to join in badly.
And sometimes one would roll over on the turf, kicking four
hoofs heavenward, which seemed formidable and was certainly
much less alluring.</p>

<p>Dim imaginings ran through Ugh-lomi's mind as he
watched&mdash;by virtue of which two rabbits lived
the longer. And sleeping, his brains were clearer and
bolder&mdash;for that was the way in those days. He came
near the horses, he dreamt, and fought, smiting stone
against hoof, but then the horses changed to men, or, at
least, to men with horses' heads, and he awoke in a cold
sweat of terror.</p>

<p>Yet the next day in the morning, as the horses were
grazing, one of the mares whinnied, and they saw Ugh-lomi
coming up the wind. They all stopped their eating and
watched him. Ugh-lomi was not coming towards them, but
strolling obliquely across the open, looking at anything in
the world but horses. He had stuck three fern-fronds into
the mat of his hair, giving him a remarkable appearance,
and he walked very slowly. "What's up now?" said the Master
Horse, who was capable, but inexperienced.</p>

<p>"It looks more like the first half of an animal than
anything else in the world, he said. "Fore-legs and no
hind."</p>

<p>"It's only one of those pink monkey things," said the
Eldest Mare. "They're a sort of river monkey. They're quite
common on the plains."</p>

<p>Ugh-lomi continued his oblique advance. The Eldest Mare
was struck with the want of motive in his proceedings.</p>

<p>"Fool!" said the Eldest Mare, in a quick conclusive way
she had. She resumed her grazing. The Master Horse and the
Second Mare followed suit.</p>

<p>"Look! he's nearer," said the Foal with a stripe.</p>

<p>One of the younger foals made uneasy movements. Ugh-lomi
squatted down and sat regarding the horses fixedly. In
a little while he was satisfied that they meant neither
flight nor hostilities. He began to consider his next
procedure. He did not feel anxious to kill, but he had his
axe with him, and the spirit of sport was upon him. How
would one kill one of these creatures?&mdash;these great
beautiful creatures!</p>

<p>Eudena, watching him with a fearful admiration from the
cover of the bracken, saw him presently go on all fours,
and so proceed again. But the horses preferred him a biped
to a quadruped, and the Master Horse threw up his head and
gave the word to move. Ugh-lomi thought they were off for
good, but after a minute's gallop they came round in a wide
curve, and stood winding him. Then, as a rise in the ground
hid him they tailed out, the Master Horse leading and
approached him spirally.</p>

<p>He was as ignorant of the possibilities of a horse
as they were of his. And at this stage it would seem he
funked. He knew this kind of stalking would make red deer
or buffalo charge, if it was persisted in. At any rate
Eudena saw him jump up and come walking towards her with
the fern plumes held in his hand.</p>

<p>She stood up, and he grinned to show that the whole
thing was an immense lark, and that what he had done was
just what he had planned to do from the very beginning. So
that incident ended. But he was very thoughtful all that
day.</p>

<p>The next day this foolish drab creature with the leonine
mane, instead of going about the grazing or hunting he was
made for, was prowling round the horses again. The Eldest
Mare was all for silent contempt. "I suppose he wants to
learn something from us," she said, and "Let him." The
next day he was at it again. The Master Horse decided
he meant absolutely nothing. But as a matter of fact,
Ugh-lomi, the first of men to feel that curious spell of
the horse that binds us even to this day, meant a great
deal. He admired them unreservedly. There was a rudiment
of the snob in him, I am afraid, and he wanted to be near
these beautifully-curved animals. Then here were vague
conceptions of a kill. If only they would let him come near
them! But they drew the line, he found, at fifty yards. If
he came nearer than that they moved off&mdash;with dignity.
I suppose it was the way he had blinded Andoo that made him
think of leaping on the back of one of them. But though
Eudena after a time came out in the open too, and they did
some unobtrusive stalking, things stopped there.</p>

<p>Then one memorable day a new idea came to Ugh-lomi.
The horse looks down and level, but he does not look up.
No animals look up&mdash;they have too much common-sense.
It was only that fantastic creature, man, could waste his
wits sky-ward. Ugh-lomi made no philosophical deductions,
but he perceived the thing was so. So he spent a weary day
in a beech that stood in the open, while Eudena stalked.
Usually the horses went into the shade in the heat of the
afternoon, but that day the sky was overcast, and they
would not, in spite of Eudena's solicitude.</p>

<p>It was two days after that that Ugh-lomi had his desire.
The day was blazing hot, and the multiplying flies asserted
themselves. The horses stopped grazing before mid-day, and
came into the shadow below him, and stood in couples nose
to tail, flapping.</p>

<p>The Master Horse, by virtue of his heels, came closest
to the tree. And suddenly there was a rustle and a creak, a
thud.... Then a sharp chipped flint bit him on the cheek.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">

<p class="caption">
And suddenly there was a rustle and a creak.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The Master Horse stumbled, came on one knee, rose to his
feet, and was off like the wind. The air was full of the
whirl of limbs, the prance of hoofs, and snorts of alarm.
Ugh-lomi was pitched a foot in the air, came down again, up
again, his stomach was hit violently, and then his knees
got a grip of something between them. He found himself
clutching with knees, feet, and hands, careering violently
with extraordinary oscillation through the air&mdash;his
axe gone heaven knows whither. "Hold tight," said Mother
Instinct, and he did.</p>

<br>

<p class="caption">
"Hold tight," said Mother Instinct.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>He was aware of a lot of coarse hair in his face, some
of it between his teeth, and of green turf streaming past
in front of his eyes. He saw the shoulder of the Master
Horse, vast and sleek, with the muscles flowing swiftly
under the skin. He perceived that his arms were round the
neck, and that the violent jerkings he experienced had a
sort of rhythm.</p>

<p>Then he was in the midst of a wild rush of tree-stems,
and then there were fronds of bracken about, and then more
open turf. Then a stream of pebbles rushing past, little
pebbles flying side-ways athwart the stream from the blow
of the swift hoofs. Ugh-lomi began to feel frightfully sick
and giddy, but he was not the stuff to leave go simply
because he was uncomfortable.</p>

<p>He dared not leave his grip, but he tried to make
himself more comfortable. He released his hug on the neck,
gripping the mane instead. He slipped his knees forward,
and pushing back, came into a sitting position where the
quarters broaden.</p>

<p>It was nervous work, but he managed it, and at last
he was fairly seated astride, breathless indeed, and
uncertain, but with that frightful pounding of his body at
any rate relieved.</p>

<p>Slowly the fragments of Ugh-lomi's mind got into order
again. The pace seemed to him terrific, but a kind of
exultation was beginning to oust his first frantic terror.
The air rushed by, sweet and wonderful, the rhythm of the
hoofs changed and broke up and returned into itself again.
They were on turf now, a wide glade&mdash;the beech-trees a
hundred yards away on either side, and a succulent band of
green starred with pink blossom and shot with silver water
here and there, meandered down the middle. Far off was a
glimpse of blue valley&mdash;far away. The exultation grew.
It was man's first taste of pace.</p>

<p>Then came a wide space dappled with flying fallow deer
scattering this way and that, and then a couple of jackals,
mistaking Ugh-lomi for a lion, came hurrying after him.
And when they saw it was not a lion they still came on out
of curiosity. On galloped the horse, with his one idea of
escape, and after him the jackals, with pricked ears and
quickly barked remarks. "Which kills which?" said the first
jackal. "It's the horse being killed," said the second.
They gave the howl of following, and the horse answered to
it as a horse answers nowadays to the spur.</p>

<p>On they rushed, a little tornado through the quiet
day, putting up startled birds, sending a dozen
unexpected things darting to cover, raising a myriad of
indignant dung-flies, smashing little blossoms, flowering
complacently, back into their parental turf. Trees again,
and then splash, splash across a torrent; then a hare
shot out of a tuft of grass under the very hoofs of the
Master Horse, and the jackals left them incontinently. So
presently they broke into the open again, a wide expanse of
turfy hillside&mdash;the very fellow of the grassy downs
that fall northward nowadays from the Epsom Stand.</p>

<p>The first hot bolt of the Master Horse was long since
over. He was falling into a measured trot, and Ugh-lomi,
albeit bruised exceedingly and quite uncertain of the
future, was in a state of glorious enjoyment. And now came
a new development. The pace broke again, the Master Horse
came round on a short curve, and stopped dead....</p>

<p>Ugh-lomi became alert. He wished he had a flint, but the
throwing flint he had carried in a thong about his waist
was&mdash;like the axe&mdash;heaven knows where. The Master
Horse turned his head, and Ugh-lomi became aware of an eye
and teeth. He whipped his leg into a position of security,
and hit at the cheek with his fist. Then the head went down
somewhere out of existence apparently, and the back he was
sitting on flew up into a dome. Ugh-lomi became a thing of
instinct again&mdash;strictly prehensile; he held by knees
and feet, and his head seemed sliding towards the turf. His
fingers were twisted into the shock of mane, and the rough
hair of the horse saved him. The gradient he was on lowered
again, and then&mdash;"Whup!" said Ugh-lomi astonished, and
the slant was the other way up. But Ugh-lomi was a thousand
generations nearer the primordial than man: no monkey could
have held on better. And the lion had been training the
horse for countless generations against the tactics of
rolling and rearing back. But he kicked like a master, and
buck-jumped rather neatly. In five minutes Ugh-lomi lived a
lifetime. If he came off the horse would kill him, he felt
assured.</p>

<p>Then the Master Horse decided to stick to his old
tactics again, and suddenly went off at a gallop. He headed
down the slope, taking the steep places at a rush, swerving
neither to the right nor to the left, and, as they rode
down, the wide expanse of valley sank out of sight behind
the approaching skirmishers of oak and Hawthorn. They
skirted a sudden hollow with the pool of a spring, rank
weeds and silver bushes. The ground grew softer and the
grass taller, and on the right-hand side and the left came
scattered bushes of May&mdash;still splashed with belated
blossom. Presently the bushes thickened until they lashed
the passing rider, and little flashes and gouts of blood
came out on horse and man. Then the way opened again.</p>

<p>And then came a wonderful adventure. A sudden squeal
of unreasonable anger rose amidst the bushes, the squeal
of some creature bitterly wronged. And crashing after
them appeared a big, grey-blue shape. It was Yaaa the
big-horned rhinoceros, in one of those fits of fury of
his, charging full tilt, after the manner of his kind. He
had been startled at his feeding, and someone, it did not
matter who, was to be ripped and trampled therefore. He was
bearing down on them from the left, with his wicked little
eye red, and his great horn down, and his little tail like
a jury-mast behind him. For a minute Ugh-lomi was minded
to slip off and dodge, and then behold! the staccato of
the hoofs grew swifter, and the rhinoceros and his stumpy
hurrying little legs seemed to slide out at the back corner
of Ugh-lomi's eye. In two minutes they were through the
bushes of May, and out in the open, going fast. For a space
he could hear the ponderous paces in pursuit receding
behind him, and then it was just as if Yaaa had not lost
his temper, as if Yaaa had never existed.</p>

<p>The pace never faltered, on they rode land on.</p>

<p>Ugh-lomi was now all exultation. To exult in those days
was to insult. "Ya-ha! big nose," he said, trying to crane
back and see some remote speck of a pursuer. "Why don't you
carry your smiting-stone in your fist?" he ended with a
frantic whoop.</p>

<p>But that whoop was unfortunate, for coming close to the
ear of the horse, and being quite unexpected, it startled
the stallion extremely. He shied violently. Ugh-lomi
suddenly found himself uncomfortable again. He was hanging
on to the horse, he found, by one arm and one knee.</p>

<p>The rest of the ride was honourable but unpleasant.
The view was chiefly of blue sky, and that was combined
with the most unpleasant physical sensations. Finally, a
bush of thorn lashed him and he let go. He hit the ground
with his cheek and shoulder, and then, after a complicated
and extraordinarily rapid movement, hit it again with the
end of his backbone. He saw splashes and sparks of light
and colour. The ground seemed bouncing about just like
the horse had done. Then he found he was sitting on turf,
six yards beyond the bush. In front of him was a space of
grass, growing greener and greener, and a number of human
beings in the distance, and the horse was going round at a
smart gallop quite a long way off to the right.</p>

<p>The human beings were on the opposite side of the river,
some still in the water, but they were all running away as
hard as they could go. The advent of a monster that took
to pieces was not the sort of novelty they cared for. For
quite a minute Ugh-lomi sat regarding them in a purely
spectacular spirit. The bend of the river, the knoll among
the reeds and royal ferns, the thin streams of smoke going
up to Heaven, were all perfectly familiar to him. It was
the squatting-place of the Sons of Uya, of Uya from whom
he had fled with Eudena, and whom he had waylaid in the
chestnut woods and killed with the First Axe.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, still dazed from his fall, and as
he did so the scattering fugitives turned and regarded
him. Some pointed to the receding horse and chattered. He
walked slowly towards them, staring. He forgot the horse,
he forgot his own bruises, in the growing interest of
this encounter. There were fewer of them than there had
been&mdash;he supposed the others must have hid&mdash;the
heap of fern or the night fire was not so high. By
the flint heaps should have sat Wau&mdash;but then he
remembered he had killed Wau. Suddenly brought back to this
familiar scene, the gorge and the bears and Eudena seemed
things remote, things dreamt of.</p>

<p>He stopped at the bank and stood regarding the tribe.
His mathematical abilities were of the slightest, but it
was certain there were fewer. The men might be away, but
there were fewer women and children. He gave the shout of
homecoming. His quarrel had been with Uya and Wau&mdash;not
with the others. They answered with his name, a little
fearfully because of the strange way he had come.</p>

<p>"Children of Uya!" he cried.</p>

<p>For a space they spoke together. Then an old woman
lifted a shrill voice and answered him. "Our Lord is a
Lion."</p>

<p>Ugh-lomi did not understand that saying. They answered
him again several together, "Uya comes again. He comes as a
Lion. Our Lord is a Lion. He comes at night. He slays whom
he will. But none other may slay us, Ugh-lomi. None other
may slay us."</p>

<p>Still Ugh-lomi did not understand.</p>

<p>"Our Lord is a Lion. He speaks no more to men."</p>

<p>Ugh-lomi stood regarding them. He had had
dreams&mdash;he knew that though he had killed Uya, Uya
still existed. And now they told him Uya was a Lion.</p>

<p>The shrivelled old woman, the mistress of the
fire-minders, suddenly turned and spoke softly to those
next to her. She was a very old woman indeed, she had been
the first of Uya's wives, and he had let her live beyond
the age to which it is seemly a woman should live. She had
been cunning from the first, cunning to please Uya and
to get food. And now she was great in counsel. She spoke
softly, and Ugh-lomi watched her shrivelled form across the
river with a curious distaste. Then she called aloud, "Come
over to us, Ugh-lomi."</p>

<p>A girl suddenly lifted up her voice. "Come over to us,
Ugh-lomi," she said. And they all began crying, "Come over
to us, Ugh-lomi."</p>

<p>It was strange how their manner changed after the
old woman called. He stood quite still watching them
all. It was pleasant to be called, and the girl who had
called first was a pretty one. But she made him think of
Eudena.</p>

<p>"Come over to us, Ugh-lomi," they cried, and the voice
of the shrivelled old woman rose above them all. At the
sound of her voice his hesitation returned. He stood on
the river bank, Ugh-lomi&mdash;Ugh the Thinker&mdash;with
his thoughts slowly taking shape. Presently one and then
another paused to see what he would do. He was minded to
go back, he was minded not to. Suddenly his fear or his
caution got the upper hand. Without answering them he
turned, and walked back towards the distant thorn-trees,
the way he had come. Forthwith the whole tribe started
crying to him again very eagerly. He hesitated and turned,
then he went on, then he turned again, and then once again,
regarding them with troubled eyes as they called. The last
time he took two paces back, before his fear stopped him.
They saw him stop once more, and suddenly shake his head
and vanish among the hawthorn-trees.</p>

<p>Then all the women and children lifted up their voices
together, and called to him in one last vain effort.</p>

<p>Far down the river the reeds were stirring in the
breeze, where, convenient for his new sort of feeding,
the old lion, who had taken to man-eating, had made his
lair.</p>

<p>The old woman turned her face that way, and pointed to
the hawthorn thickets. "Uya," she screamed, "there goes
thine enemy! There goes thine enemy, Uya! Why do you devour
us nightly? We have tried to snare him There goes thine
enemy, Uya!"</p>

<p>But the lion who preyed upon the tribe was taking his
siesta. The cry went unheard. That day he had dined on
one of the plumper girls, and his mood was a comfortable
placidity. He really did not understand that he was Uya or
that Ugh-lomi was his enemy.</p>

<p>So it was that Ugh-lomi rode the horse, and heard first
of Uya the lion, who had taken the place of Uya the Master,
and was eating up the tribe. And as he hurried back to the
gorge his mind was no longer full of the horse, but of the
thought that Uya was still alive, to slay or be slain.
Over and over again he saw the shrunken band of women and
children crying that Uya was a lion. Uya was a lion!</p>

<p>And presently, fearing the twilight might come upon him,
Ugh-lomi began running.</p>
