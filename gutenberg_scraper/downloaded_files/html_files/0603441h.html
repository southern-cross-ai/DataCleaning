<p><b>The  Mountains</b> </p>
<p>A  land of sombre, silent hills, where mountain cattle go<br>
  By twisted tracks, on sidelings deep, where giant gumtrees grow<br>
  And the wind replies, in the river oaks, to the song of the stream below.</p>
<p>A  land where the hills keep watch and ward, silent and wide awake<br>
  As those who sit by a dead campfire, and wait for the dawn to break,<br>
  Or those who watched by the Holy Cross for the dead Redeemer&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>A  land where silence lies so deep that sound itself is dead<br>
  And a gaunt grey bird, like a homeless soul, drifts, noiseless, overhead<br>
  And the world&rsquo;s great story is left untold, and the message is left unsaid.</p>
<p><b>The  Plains</b> </p>
<p>A  land as far as the eye can see, where the waving grasses grow<br>
  Or the plains are blackened and burnt and bare, where the false mirages go<br>
  Like shifting symbols of hope deferred&mdash;land where you never know.</p>
<p>Land  of plenty or land of want, where the grey Companions dance,<br>
  Feast or famine, or hope or fear, and in all things land of chance,<br>
  Where Nature pampers or Nature slays, in her ruthless, red, romance.</p>
<p>And  we catch a sound of a fairy&rsquo;s song, as the wind goes whipping by,<br>
  Or a scent like incense drifts along from the herbage ripe and dry<br>
  &mdash;Or the dust storms dance on their ballroom floor, where the bones of the  cattle lie.</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="0603441h-images/swanandkoala.jpg" width="747" height="750"></h3>
<p>The big&nbsp;white  English swan, escaped from captivity, found himself swimming in an Australian  waterhole fringed with giant gumtrees. In one of the lower forks of a gumtree  sat a placid round-eyed elderly gentleman apparently thinking of nothing whatever&mdash;in  other words, a native bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, sir,&rdquo; said the swan, &ldquo;can you tell me where I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; said the bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; said the swan, thinking his new acquaintance was dull-witted;  &ldquo;but where is &lsquo;here&rsquo;? You see, I&rsquo;m an English swan&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse  me,&rdquo; said the bear, &ldquo;swans are black, I&rsquo;ve seen thousands of &rsquo;em&rdquo; .</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re  black in this country,&rdquo; said the swan, &ldquo;just the same as the Aboriginals are  black; but they are white in England,  just the same as the people there are white. I don&rsquo;t like mentioning it, but  our family are very highly regarded in England&mdash;one of the oldest families.  We came to England from Cyprus with  Richard Coeur-de-Leon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  a bit in that line myself,&rdquo; said the bear. &ldquo;Did you ever hear of the Flood,  when Noah took the animals in the Ark?  Well, my people wouldn&rsquo;t go in the Ark.  They didn&rsquo;t see any chance of getting fresh gum leaves every day, and they  heard that this Noah was not too reliable. A capable chap&mdash;he must have been a  capable chap to organise that outfit&mdash;but inclined to drink. So our people  climbed trees and lived on gum leaves till the water went down. They say the  Flood wasn&rsquo;t as high here as it was in other places, but I&rsquo;ve never seen a  flood but what somebody would tell you it was higher at his place than at  yours. Have you any friends here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid not,&rdquo; said the swan, &ldquo;but you never know. I&rsquo;ll give a call.&rdquo; </p>
<p>So he  put up his head and sent a call echoing through the bush like the clang of a  great brazen gong. Twice he repeated it, but no answer came. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck,&rdquo; said  the bear. &ldquo;Anyone within two miles would be deaf if he didn&rsquo;t hear that. I&rsquo;m  pretty good, myself, at making people hear me. We got a lot of practice in the  Flood, shouting to each other from the trees, and when we saw old Noah drifting  on to a sandbank, we&rsquo;d give him a hail. Listen to me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And throwing his head  back he emitted the weirdest and most unmusical noise you ever heard. It  sounded like an empty train running over an iron bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  could have had good money to go on the stage,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but of course in my  position I couldn&rsquo;t consider it. What would people think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  suppose you have a lot of freinds,&rdquo; said the swan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  not exactly friends,&rdquo; said the bear. &ldquo;You see, we of the old families have to  be a bit particular. We can&rsquo;t associate with these <i>nouveaux riches</i> and  Johnny-come-lately people that you see about. Now, there&rsquo;s the &rsquo;possums&mdash;people  that pretend to be relations of mine, but they&rsquo;re not. I saw one of them  hanging upside down by the tail from a limb one night. Most undignified. Thank  goodness, no matter what has happened to us, we have never grown tails. The  Platypus family is as old as we are, but they live in the water, and I have  never touched water, inside or outside, in my life; so we don&rsquo;t see anything of  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  they date back to the Flood?&rdquo; said the swan, who was thinking that after all  Coeur-de-Lion seemed quite modern compared to these people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes,&rdquo; said the bear. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t go in the Ark either. Couldn&rsquo;t see any hope of getting  their regular food, and there was a first-class chance of getting trodden on by  the elephant. So they took to the water and they had the time of their lives.  Plenty of food, and they drifted about on floating logs and fence posts all day  long. Didn&rsquo;t even have to swim. That was a gentleman&rsquo;s life, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is there up this creek?&rdquo; said the swan. &ldquo;Do you travel about much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me  travel!&rdquo; said the bear. &ldquo;Do I look like it? Why should I? They say there are  better trees up the creek, but what was good enough for my fathers is good  enough for me. One of our people went wandering all over the place, half a mile  up the creek, and he climbed a tree with a bee&rsquo;s nest in it and they stung him  till his nose swelled up like an elephant&rsquo;s trunk. That&rsquo;s what he got for being  one of those revolutionary chaps. Served him right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said the swan, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have met you and I think I&rsquo;d better be moving on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it,&rdquo; said the bear, &ldquo;not a bit of it. Never move on when you&rsquo;re lost.  If people that are lost would sit still they&rsquo;d be all right; but they will keep  moving about and they die before people can catch up with them. Stay where you  are and someone&rsquo;s sure to hear of you and they&rsquo;ll come here to look for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While  they were talking, the surface of the waterhole below them was as smooth as  glass. Then, without a splash or a ripple, a lithe brown creature rose to the  surface and drifted there soundlessly, looking up at them with bright little  eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day,  Mr Platypus,&rdquo; said the bear. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he went on, indicating the swan with a  wave of his hand, &ldquo;is an English friend of mine. I want you to take him where  he can get a good feed of lily roots and frogs, and then fetch him back here.  We&rsquo;ll boil the billy and make a night of it. He can tell us about Richard  Coeur-de-Leon, and we can tell him about these neighbors of ours.&rdquo; And it is  from what the native bear and the platypus said that night that this book is  written.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="FrogsinChorus"></a>Frogs in  Chorus</b></h2>
<p>The chorus frogs in the big lagoon<br>
  Would sing their songs to the silvery moon.<br>
  Tenor singers were out of place,<br>
  For every frog was a double bass.<br>
  But never a human chorus yet<br>
  Could beat the accurate time they set.<br>
  The solo singer began the joke;<br>
  He sang, &ldquo;As long as I live I&rsquo;ll croak,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Croak,  I&rsquo;ll croak,&rdquo;<br>
  And the chorus followed him: &ldquo;Croak, croak,  croak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  poet frog, in his plaintive tone,<br>
  Sang of a sorrow was all his own;<br>
  &ldquo;How shall I win to my heart&rsquo;s desire?<br>
  How shall I feel my spirit&rsquo;s fire?&rdquo;<br>
  And the solo frog in his deepest croak,<br>
  &ldquo;To fire your spirit,&rdquo; he sang, &ldquo;eat coke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coke,  eat coke,&rdquo;<br>
  And the chorus followed him: &ldquo;Coke, coke, coke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  green frog sat in a swampy spot<br>
  And he sang the song of he knew not what.<br>
  &ldquo;The world is rotten, oh cursed plight,<br>
  That I am the frog that must set it right.<br>
  How shall I scatter the shades that lurk?&rdquo;<br>
  And the old man bullfrog sang, &ldquo;Get work,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work,  get work,&rdquo;<br>
  And the chorus followed him: &ldquo;Work, work, work!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>The soaring spirits that fain would fly<br>
  On wings of hope to the starry sky<br>
  Must face the snarls of the jealous dogs,<br>
  For the world is ruled by its chorus frogs.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Twas  the dingo pup to his dam that said<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time I worked for my daily bread.<br>
Out in the world I intend to go,<br>
And you&rsquo;d be surprised at the things I know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a wild duck&rsquo;s nest in a sheltered spot,<br>
  And I&rsquo;ll go right down and I&rsquo;ll eat the lot.&rdquo;<br>
  But when he got to his destined prey<br>
  He found that the ducks had flown away.</p>
<p>But  an egg was left that would quench his thirst,<br>
  So he bit the egg and it straightway burst.<br>
  It burst with a bang, and he turned and fled,<br>
  For he thought that the egg had shot him dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us clear right out<br>
  Or we&rsquo;ll lose our lives with the bombs about;<br>
  And it&rsquo;s lucky I am that I&rsquo;m not blown up&mdash;<br>
  It&rsquo;s a very hard life,&rdquo; said the dingo pup.</p>

<p>The strongest&nbsp;creature  for his size<br>
  But least equipped for combat<br>
  That dwells beneath Australian skies<br>
  Is Weary Will the Wombat.</p>
<p>He  digs his homestead underground,<br>
  He&rsquo;s neither shrewd nor clever;<br>
  For kangaroos can leap and bound<br>
  But wombats dig forever.</p>
<p>The  boundary rider&rsquo;s netting fence<br>
  Excites his irritation;<br>
  It is to his untutored sense<br>
  His pet abomination.</p>
<p>And  when to pass it he desires,<br>
  Upon his task he&rsquo;ll centre<br>
  And dig a hole beneath the wires<br>
  Through which the dingoes enter.</p>
<p>And  when to block the hole they strain<br>
  With logs and stones and rubble,<br>
  Bill Wombat digs it out again<br>
  Without the slightest trouble.</p>
<p>The  boundary rider bows to fate,<br>
  Admits he&rsquo;s made a blunder<br>
  And rigs a little swinging gate<br>
  To let Bill Wombat under.</p>
<p>So  most contentedly he goes<br>
  Between his haunt and burrow:<br>
  He does the only thing he knows,<br>

  The wombat dug with the greater zeal,<br>

  Underground in a secret tunnel,<br>

<p>And  he plays and dives in the river bends<br>
  In a style that is most elusive;<br>

  From a family most exclusive.</p>

<p>When Ironbark  the turtle came to Anthony&rsquo;s lagoon<br>
  The hills were hid behind a mist of equinoctial rain,<br>
  The ripple of the rivulets was like a cheerful tune<br>
  And wild companions waltzed among the grass as tall as grain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  Ironbark the turtle cared no whit for all of these;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ripple of the rivulets, the rustle of  the trees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were only apple sauce to him, or just a  piece of cheese.</p>
<p>Now,  Dan-di-dan the water rat was exquisitely dressed,<br>
  For not a seal in Bass&rsquo;s Straits had half as fine a coat,<br>
  And every day he combed and brushed his golden-yellow vest,<br>
  A contrast with the white cravat he wore beneath his throat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  Dan-di-dan the water rat could move with ease and grace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Ironbark appeared to him a creature out  of place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With iron-plated overcoat and dirty little  face.</p>
<p>A  crawfish at the point of death came drifting down the drains.<br>
  Said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scalded to the heart with bathing near the bore.&rdquo;<br>
  The turtle and the water rat disputed his remains,<br>
  For crawfish meat all day they&rsquo;d eat, and then they&rsquo;d ask for more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said  Dan-di-dan, &ldquo;The prize is mine, for I was fishing here<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you tumbled down the bank and landed  on your ear.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; the turtle said, &ldquo;if  you&rsquo;d have fished a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  Baggy-beak the Pelican was asked to arbitrate;<br>
  The scales of justice seemed to hang beneath his noble beak.<br>
  He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take possession of the subject of debate&rdquo;;<br>
  He stowed the fish inside his pouch and then began to speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The  case is far from clear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and justices of note&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here he snapped his beak and flapped  his piebald overcoat&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that wretched fish has  slithered down my throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  still,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the point involved requires a full debate.<br>
  I&rsquo;ll have to get the lawyer birds and fix a special day.<br>
  <i>Ad interim </i>I rule that costs come out of the estate.&rdquo;<br>
  And Baggy-beak the Pelican got up and flew away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  both the pair who went to law were feeling very small.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said they, &ldquo;We might have halved the fish  and saved a nasty brawl;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For half a crawfish isn&rsquo;t much, but more  than none at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boastful crow  and the Laughing Jack<br>
  Were telling tales of the outer back:<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been travelling far and wide,<br>
  At the back of Bourke and the Queensland  side;<br>
  There isn&rsquo;t a bird in the bush can go<br>
  As far as me,&rdquo; said the old black crow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  isn&rsquo;t a bird in the bush can fly<br>
  A course as straight or a course as high.<br>
  Higher than human eyesight goes<br>
  There&rsquo;s sometimes clouds&mdash;but there&rsquo;s always crows,<br>
  Drifting along for a scent of blood<br>
  Or a smell of smoke or a sign of flood.<br>
  For never a bird or a beast has been<br>
  With a sight as strong or a scent as keen.<br>
  At fires and floods I&rsquo;m the first about,<br>
  For then the lizards and mice run out:<br>
  And I make my swoop&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all they know&mdash;<br>
  I&rsquo;m a whale on mice,&rdquo; said the Boastful Crow.</p>
<p>The  Bee-birds over the homestead flew<br>
  And told each other the long day through<br>
  &ldquo;The cold has come, we must take the track.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll make you a bet,&rdquo; said the Laughing Jack,<br>
  &ldquo;Of a hundred mice, that you dare not go<br>
  With the little Bee-birds, my Boastful Crow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said  the Boastful Crow, &ldquo;I could take my ease<br>
  And fly with little green birds like these.<br>
  If they went flat out and they did their best<br>
  I could have a smoke and could take a rest.&rdquo;<br>
  And he asked of the Bee-birds circling round:<br>
  &ldquo;Now, where do you spike-tails think you&rsquo;re bound?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;We leave tonight, and our present plan<br>
  Is to go straight on till we reach Japan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every  year, on the self-same day,<br>
  We call our children and start away,<br>
  Twittering, travelling day and night,<br>
  Over the ocean we take our flight;<br>
  And we rest a day on some lonely isles<br>
  Or we beg a ride for a hundred miles<br>
  On a steamer&rsquo;s deck, and away we go:<br>
  We hope you&rsquo;ll come with us, Mister Crow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  the old black crow was extremely sad.<br>
  Said he: &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;re raving mad<br>
  To talk of travelling night and day,<br>
  And how in the world do you find your way?&rdquo;<br>
  And the Bee-birds answered him, &ldquo;If you please,<br>
  That&rsquo;s one of our own great mysteries&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Beside the  bare and beaten track of travelling flocks and herds<br>
  The woodpecker went tapping on, the postman of the birds,<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a letter here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that no one&rsquo;s understood,<br>
  Addressed as follows: &lsquo;To the bird that&rsquo;s like a piece of wood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  soldier bird got very cross&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t meant for her;<br>
  The spur-wing plover had a try to stab me with a spur:<br>
  The jackass laughed, and said the thing was written for a lark.<br>
  I think I&rsquo;ll chuck this postman job and take to stripping bark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  all the birds for miles around came in to lend a hand;<br>
  They perched upon a broken limb as thick as they could stand,<br>
  And just as old man eaglehawk prepared to have his say<br>
  A portion of the broken limb got up and flew away.</p>
<p>Then,  casting grammar to the winds, the postman said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!<br>

  And pokes his beak up like a stick; there&rsquo;s not a bird, I vow,<br>
  Can tell you which is boo-book owl and which is broken bough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  that&rsquo;s the thing he calls his nest&mdash;that jerry-built affair&mdash;<br>

  He had made an excavation like a graveyard for a horse.</p>
<p>Then  we held a consultation which decided on his fate:<br>
  &rsquo;Twas in anger more than sorrow that we led him to the gate,<br>
  And we handed him the beef-bone as provision for the day,<br>
  Then we opened wide the portal and we told him &ldquo;On your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBillyGoatOverland"></a>The  Billy-Goat Overland</b></h2>
<p>Come all ye  lads of the droving days, ye gentlemen unafraid,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll tell you all of the greatest trip that ever a drover made,<br>
  For we rolled our swags, and we packed our bags, and taking our lives in hand,<br>
  We started away with a thousand goats, on the billy-goat overland.</p>
<p>There  wasn&rsquo;t a fence that&rsquo;d hold the mob, or keep &rsquo;em from their desires;<br>
  They skipped along the top of the posts and cake-walked on the wires.<br>
  And where the lanes had been stripped of grass and the paddocks were nice and  green,<br>
  The goats they travelled outside the lanes and we rode in between.</p>
<p>The  squatters started to drive them back, but that was no good at all,<br>
  Their horses ran for the lick of their lives from the scent that was like a  wall:<br>
  And never a dog had pluck or gall in front of the mob to stand<br>
  And face the charge of a thousand goats on the billy-goat overland.</p>
<p>We  found we were hundreds over strength when we counted out the mob;<br>
  And they put us in jail for a crowd of theives that travelled to steal and rob:<br>
  For every goat between here and Bourke, when he scented our spicy band,<br>
  Had left his home and his work to join in the billy-goat overland.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="SwingintheLead"></a>Swingin&rsquo; the Lead</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note"><i>Army term for malingering</i></p>
<p>Said the  soldier to the sergeant: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got noises in me head<br>
  And a kind of filled-up feeling after every time I&rsquo;m fed;<br>
  I can sleep all night on picket, but I can&rsquo;t sleep in me bed.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  the sergeant said<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said  the soldier to the sergeant: &ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll send me back?<br>
  For I really ain&rsquo;t adapted to be carrying a pack,<br>
  Though I&rsquo;ve humped a case of whisky half a mile upon me back.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  the sergeant said<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  me legs have swelled up cruel, I can hardly walk at all;<br>
  But when the Taubes come over you should see me start to crawl;<br>
  When we&rsquo;s sprinting for the dug-out, I can easy beat &rsquo;em all.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  the sergeant said<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  they sent him to the trenches, where he landed safe and sound,<br>
  And he drew his ammunition, just about two-fifty round.<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, sergeant, what&rsquo;s this heavy stuff I&rsquo;ve got to hump around?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  the sergeant said<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  lead.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="0603441h-images/mule.jpg" width="767" height="598"></h3>
<p>Oh the airman&rsquo;s game is a showman&rsquo;s game, for all of  us watch him go<br>
  With his roaring, soaring aeroplanes, and his  bombs for the blokes below.<br>
  Over the railways and over the dumps, over the  Hun and the Turk;<br>
  You&rsquo;ll hear him mutter &ldquo;What-ho she bumps!&rdquo;  when the Archies get to work.</p>
<p>But  not of him is the song I sing, though he follow the eagle&rsquo;s flight,<br>
  And with shrapnel holes in his splintered wing come home to his roost at night.<br>
  He may silver his wings on the shining stars, he may look from his clouds on  high,<br>
  He may follow the flight of the wheeling kite in the blue Egyptian sky.<br>
  But he&rsquo;s only a hero built to plan, turned out by the Service Schools,<br>
  And I sing of the rankless, thankless man who hustles the Army Mules.</p>
<p>Now,  where he comes from and where he lives is a mystery dark and dim,<br>
  And it&rsquo;s rarely indeed that the General gives a D.S.O. to him<br>
  The stolid Infantry digs its way, like a mole in a ruined wall:<br>
  The Cavalry lends a tone, they say, to what were else but a brawl:</p>
<p>The  Brigadier of the Mounted Fut, like a cavalry colonel swanks<br>
  As he goeth abroad like a gilded nut to receive the General&rsquo;s thanks:<br>
  The Ordnance Man is a son-of-a-gun, and his lists are a standing joke;<br>
  You order &ldquo;Choke arti Jerusalem one&rdquo; for Jerusalem artichoke.<br>
  The Medicals shine with a Number Nine, and the men of the great R.E.<br>
  Their colonels are Methodist, married, or mad, and some of them all the three.<br>
  In all these units the road to fame is taught in the Service Schools,<br>
  But a man has got to be born to the game when he tackles the Army Mules.</p>
<p>For  if you go where the depots are, as the dawn is breaking grey,<br>
  By the waning light of the morning star as the dustcloud clears away<br>
  You&rsquo;ll see a vision among the dust like a man and a mule combined;<br>
  It&rsquo;s the kind of thing you must take on trust, as its outlines aren&rsquo;t defined:<br>
  A thing that wheels like a spinning top, and props like a three-legged stool&mdash;<br>
  And you find it&rsquo;s a long-legged Queensland boy convincing an Army Mule.</p>
<p>The  rider sticks to the hybrid&rsquo;s hide as paper sticks to a wall,<br>
  For a &ldquo;Magnoon&rdquo; Waler is next to ride, with every chance of a fall.<br>
  It&rsquo;s a rough-house game, and a thankless game, and it isn&rsquo;t the game for a  fool,<br>
  For an army&rsquo;s fate and a nation&rsquo;s fame may turn on an Army Mule.</p>
<p>And  if you go to the front-line camp where the sleepless outposts lie,<br>
  At the dead of night you can hear the tramp of the Mule Train toiling by:<br>
  The rattle and clink of a leading-chain, the creak of the lurching load,<br>
  As the patient plodding creatures strain at their task in the shell-torn road.</p>
<p>Through  the dark and the dust you may watch them go till the dawn is grey in the sky,<br>
  For only the sleepless pickets know when the &ldquo;All-night corps&rdquo; goes by.<br>
  And far away as the silence falls, when the last of the train has gone,<br>
  A weary voice through the darkness calls &ldquo;Get on there, men, get on!&rdquo;<br>
  It isn&rsquo;t the hero built to plan, turned out by the modern schools,<br>
  It&rsquo;s only the Army Service man, a-driving his Army Mules.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow can it  rain,&rdquo; the old man said, &ldquo;with things the way they are?<br>
  You&rsquo;ve got to learn off ant and bee, and jackass and galah;<br>
  And no man never saw it rain, for fifty years at least,<br>
  Not when the blessed parrakeets are flyin&rsquo; to the East!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>The  weeks went by, the squatter wrote to tell his bank the news.<br>
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still as dry as dust,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeding all the ewes;<br>
  The overdraft would sink a ship, but make your mind at rest,<br>
  It&rsquo;s all right now, the parrakeets are flyin&rsquo; to the West.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSilentShearer"></a>The Silent  Shearer</b></h2>
<p>Weary and  listless, sad and slow,<br>
  Without any conversation,<br>
  Was a man that worked on The Overflow,<br>
  The butt of the shed and the station.</p>
<p>The  shearers christened him Noisy Ned,<br>
  With an alias &ldquo;Silent Waters,&rdquo;<br>
  But never a needless word he said<br>
  In the hut or the shearers&rsquo; quarters.</p>
<p>Which  caused annoyance to Big Barcoo,<br>
  The shed&rsquo;s unquestioned ringer,<br>
  Whose name was famous Australia  through<br>
  As a dancer, fighter and singer.</p>
<p>He  was fit for the ring, if he&rsquo;d had his rights<br>
  As an agent of devastation;<br>
  And the number of men he had killed in fights<br>
  Was his principal conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have known blokes go to their doom,&rdquo; said he,<br>
  &ldquo;Through actin&rsquo; with haste and rashness:<br>
  But the style that this Noisy Ned assumes,<br>
  It&rsquo;s nothing but silent flashness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  may just be dirt, from his point of view,<br>
  Unworthy a word in season;<br>
  But I&rsquo;ll make him talk like a cockatoo<br>
  Or I&rsquo;ll get him to show the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Was  it chance or fate, that King Condamine,<br>
  A king who had turned a black tracker,<br>
  Had captured a baby purcupine,<br>
  Which he swapped for a &ldquo;fig tobacker&rdquo;</p>
<p>With  the porcupine in the Silent&rsquo;s bed<br>
  The shearers were quite elated,<br>
  And the things to be done, and the words to be said,<br>
  Were anxiously awaited.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>With  a screech and a howl and an eldritch cry<br>
  That nearly deafened his hearers<br>
  He sprang from his bunk, and his fishy eye<br>
  Looked over the laughing shearers.</p>
<p>He  looked them over and he looked them through<br>
  As a cook might look through a larder;<br>
  &ldquo;Now, Big Barcoo, I must pick on you,<br>
  You&rsquo;re big, but you&rsquo;ll fall the harder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now,  the silent man was but slight and thin<br>
  And of middleweight conformation,<br>
  But he hung one punch on the Barcoo&rsquo;s chin<br>
  And it ended the altercation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  heard of the One-round Kid,&rdquo; said he,<br>
  &ldquo;That hunted &rsquo;em all to shelter?<br>
  The One-round Finisher&mdash;that was me,<br>
  When I fought as the Champion Welter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  this Barcoo bloke on his back reclines<br>
  For being a bit too clever,<br>
  For snakes and wombats and porcupines<br>
  Are nothing to me whatever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  the golden rule that I&rsquo;ve had to learn<br>
  In the ring, and for years I&rsquo;ve tried it,<br>
  Is only to talk when it comes your turn,<br>
  And never to talk outside it.&rdquo;</p>
