<hr align="center" width="25%">

<p>THE front door bell tinkled impatiently; evidently somebody was
in a hurry. Alan Hubert answered the call, a thing that even a
distinguished physician might do, seeing that it was on the stroke
of midnight. The tall, graceful figure of a woman in evening dress
stumbled into the hall. The diamonds in her hair shimmered and
trembled, her face was full of terror.</p>

<p>"You are Dr. Hubert," she gasped. "I am Mrs. Fillingham, the
artist's wife, you know. Will you come with me at once... My
husband... I had been dining out. In the studio... Oh, please
come!"</p>

<p>Hubert asked no unnecessary questions. He knew Fillingham, the
great portrait painter, well enough by repute and by sight also,
for Fillingham's house and studio were close by. There were many
artists in the Devonshire Park district&mdash;that pretty suburb
which was one of the triumphs of the builder's and landscape
gardener's art. Ten years ago it had been no more than a swamp;
to-day people spoke complacently of the fact that they lived in
Devonshire Park.</p>

<p>Hubert walked up the drive and past the trim lawns with Mrs.
Fillingham hanging on his arm, and in at the front door. Mrs.
Fillingham pointed to a door on the right. She as too exhausted to
speak. There were shaded lights gleaming everywhere, on old oak and
armour and on a large portrait of a military-looking man propped up
on an easel. On a lay figure was a magnificent foreign military
uniform.</p>

<p>Hubert caught all this in a quick mental flash. But the vital
interest to him was a human figure lying on his back before the
fireplace. The clean-shaven, sensitive face of the artist had a
ghastly, purple-black tinge, there was a large swelling in the
throat.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he is not dead?" Mrs. Fillingham asked in a frozen
whisper.</p>

<p>Hubert was able to satisfy the distracted wife on that head.
Fillingham was still breathing. Hubert stripped the shade from a
reading lamp and held the electric bulb at the end of its long flex
above the sufferer's mouth, contriving to throw the flood of light
upon the back of the throat.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="0603521h-images/0603521h-01.jpg" alt=
"'Diphtheria!' he exclaimed.">
</p>

<p>"Diphtheria!" he exclaimed. "Label's type unless I am greatly
mistaken. Some authorities are disposed to scoff at Dr. Label's
discovery. I was an assistant of his for four years and I know
better. Fortunately I happen to know what the
treatment&mdash;successful in two cases&mdash;was."</p>

<p>He hurried from the house and returned a few minutes later
breathlessly. He had some strange-looking, needle-like instruments
in his hands. He took an electric lamp from its socket and
substituted a plug on a flex instead. Then he cleared a table
without ceremony and managed to hoist his patient upon it.</p>

<p>"Now please hold that lamp steadily thus," he said. "Bravo, you
are a born nurse! I am going to apply these electric needles to the
throat."</p>

<p>Hubert talked on more for the sake of his companion's nerves
than anything else. The still figure on the table quivered under
his touch, his lungs expanded in a long, shuddering sigh. The heart
was beating more or less regularly now. Fillingham opened his eyes
and muttered something.</p>

<p>"Ice," Hubert snapped, "have you got any ice in the house?"</p>

<p>It was a well-regulated establishment and there was plenty of
ice in the refrigerator. Not until the patient was safe in bed did
Hubert's features relax.</p>

<p>"We'll pull him through yet," he said. "I'll send you a
competent nurse round in half-an-hour. I'll call first thing in the
morning and bring Dr. Label with me. He must not miss this on any
account."</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later Hubert was spinning along in a hansom towards
Harley Street. It was past one when he reached the house of the
great German savant. A dim light was burning in the hall. A big man
with an enormous shaggy head and a huge frame attired in the
seediest of dress coats welcomed Hubert with a smile.</p>

<p>"So, my young friend," Label said, "your face promises
excitement."</p>

<p>"Case of Label's diphtheria," Hubert said crisply. "Fillingham,
the artist, who lives close by me. Fortunately they called me in. I
have arranged for you to see my patient the first thing in the
morning."</p>

<p>The big German's jocular manner vanished. He led Hubert gravely
to a chair in his consulting-room and curtly demanded details. He
smiled approvingly as Hubert enlarged upon his treatment of the
case.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly your diagnosis was correct," he said, puffing
furiously at a long china pipe. "You have not forgotten what I told
you of it. The swelling&mdash;which is caused by violent blood
poisoning&mdash;yielded to the electric treatment. I took the virus
from the cases in the north and I tried them on scores of animals.
And they all died.</p>

<p>"I find it is the virus of what is practically a new disease,
one of the worst in the wide world. I say it recurs again, and it
does. So I practise, and practise to find a cure. And electricity
is the cure. I inoculate five dogs with the virus and I save two by
the electric current. You follow my plans and you go the first
stage of the way to cure Fillingham. Did you bring any of that
mucous here?"</p>

<p>Hubert produced it in a tiny glass tube. For a little time Label
examined it under his microscope. He wanted to make assurance
doubly sure.</p>

<p>"It is the same thing," he said presently. "I knew that it was
bound to recur again. Why, it is planted all over our big cities.
And electricity is the only way to get rid of it. It was the best
method of dealing with sewage, only corporations found it too
expensive. Wires in the earth charged to say 10,000 volts. Apply
this and you destroy the virus that lies buried under hundreds of
houses in London. They laughed at me when I suggested it years
ago."</p>

<p>"Underground," Hubert asked vaguely.</p>

<p>"Ach, underground, yes. Don't you recollect that in certain
parts of England cancer is more common than in other places? The
germs have been turned up in fields. I, myself, have proved their
existence. In a little time, perhaps. I shall open the eyes of your
complacent Londoners. You live in a paradise, ach Gott! And what
was that paradise like ten years ago? Dreary pools and deserted
brickfields. And how do you fill it up and level it to build houses
upon?"</p>

<p>"By the carting of hundreds of thousands of loads of refuse, of
course."</p>

<p>"Ach, I will presently show you what that refuse was and is. Now
go home to bed."</p>
<br>

<p>* * * * *</p>
<br>

<p>Mrs. Fillingham remained in the studio with Hubert whilst Label
was making his examination overhead. The patient had had a bad
night; his symptoms were very grave indeed. Hubert listened more or
less vaguely; his mind had gone beyond the solitary case. He was
dreading what might happen in the future.</p>

<p>"Your husband has a fine constitution," he said soothingly.</p>

<p>"He has overtried it lately," Mrs. Fillingham replied. "At
present he is painting a portrait of the Emperor of Asturia. His
Majesty was to have sat to-day; he spent the morning here
yesterday."</p>

<p>But Hubert was paying no attention.</p>

<p>The heavy tread of Label was heard as he floundered down the
stairs. His big voice was booming. What mattered all the portraits
in the world so long as the verdict hung on the German doctor's
lips!</p>

<p>"Oh, there is a chance," Label exclaimed. "Just a chance.
Everything possible is being done. This is not so much diphtheria
as a new disease. Diphtheria family, no doubt, but the blood
poisoning makes a difficult thing of it."</p>

<p>Label presently dragged Hubert away after parting with Mrs.
Fillingham. He wanted to find a spot where building or draining was
going on.</p>

<p>They found some men presently engaged in connecting a new house
with the main drainage&mdash;a deep cutting some forty yards long
by seven or eight feet deep. There was the usual crust of asphalt
on the road, followed by broken bricks and the like, and a more or
less regular stratum of blue-black rubbish, soft, wet, and
clinging, and emitting an odour that caused Hubert to throw up his
head.</p>

<p>"You must have broken into a drain somewhere here," he said.</p>

<p>"We ain't, sir," the foreman of the gang replied. "It's nout but
rubbidge as they made up the road with here ten years ago. Lord
knows where it came from, but it do smell fearful in weather like
this."</p>

<p>The odour indeed was stifling. All imaginable kinds of rubbish
and refuse lay under the external beauties of Devonshire Park in
strata ranging from five to forty feet deep. It was little wonder
that trees and flowers flourished here. And here&mdash;wet, and
dark, and festering&mdash; was a veritable hotbed of disease.
Contaminated rags, torn paper, road siftings, decayed vegetable
matter, diseased food, fish and bones all were represented
here.</p>

<p>"Every ounce of this ought to have gone through the destructor,"
Label snorted. "But no, it is used for the foundations of a
suburban paradise. My word, we shall see what your paradise will be
like presently. Come along."</p>

<p align="center"><img src="0603521h-images/0603521h-02.jpg" alt=
"Label picked up a square slab of the blue stratum.">
</p>

<p>Label picked up a square slab of the blue stratum, put it in a
tin, and the tin in his pocket. He was snorting and puffing with
contempt.</p>

<p>"Now come to Harley Street with me and I will show you things,"
he said.</p>

<p>He was as good as his word. Placed under a microscope, a minute
portion of the subsoil from Devonshire Park proved to be a mass of
living matter. There were at least four kinds of bacillus here that
Hubert had never seen before. With his superior knowledge Label
pointed out the fact that they all existed in the mucous taken from
Fillingham on the previous evening.</p>

<p>"There you are!" He cried excitedly. "You get all that wet
sodden refuse of London and you dump it down here in a heap. You
mix with it a heap of vegetable matter so that fermentation shall
have every chance. Then you cover it over with some soil, and you
let it boil, boil, boil. Then, when millions upon millions of
death-dealing microbes are bred and bred till their virility is
beyond the scope of science, you build good houses on the top of
it. For years I have been prophesying an outbreak of some new
disease&mdash;or some awful form of an old one&mdash;and here it
comes. They called me a crank because I asked for high electric
voltage to kill the plague&mdash;to destroy it by lightning. A
couple of high tension wires run into the earth and there you are.
See here."</p>

<p>He took his cube of the reeking earth and applied the battery to
it. The mass showed no outward change. But once under the
microscope a fragment of it demonstrated that there was not the
slightest trace of organic life.</p>

<p>"There!" Label cried. "Behold the remedy. I don't claim that it
will cure in every case, because we hardly touch the diphtheretic
side of the trouble. When there has been a large loss of life we
shall learn the perfect remedy by experience. But this thing is
coming, and your London is going to get a pretty bad scare. You
have laid it down like port wine, and now that the thing is ripe
you are going to suffer from the consequence. I have written
articles in the Lancet, I have warned people, but they take not the
slightest heed."</p>

<p>Hubert went back home thoughtfully. He found the nurse who had
Fillingham's case in hand waiting for him in his
consulting-room.</p>

<p>"I am just back from my walk," she said. "I wish you would call
at Dr. Walker's at Elm Crescent. He has two cases exactly like Mr.
Fillingham's, and he is utterly puzzled."</p>

<p>Hubert snatched his hat and his electric needles, and hurried
away at once. He found his colleague impatiently waiting for him
There were two children this time in one of the best appointed
houses in Devonshire Park, suffering precisely as Fillingham had
done. In each instance the electric treatment gave the desired
result. Hubert hastily explained the whole matter to Walker.</p>

<p>"It's an awful business," the latter said, "Personally, I have a
great respect for Label, and I feel convinced that he is right. If
this thing spreads, property in Devonshire Park won't be worth the
price of slum lodgings." By mid-day nineteen cases of the so-called
diphtheria had been notified within the three miles area known as
Devonshire Park. Evidently some recent excavations had liberated
the deadly microbe. But there was no scare as yet. Label came down
again hotfoot with as many assistants as he could get, and took up
his quarters with Hubert. They were going to have a busy time.</p>

<p>It was after two before Hubert managed to run across to
Fillingham's again. He stood in the studio waiting for Mrs.
Fillingham. His mind was preoccupied and uneasy, yet he seemed to
miss something from the studio. It was strange, considering that he
had only been in the room twice before.</p>

<p>"Are you looking for anything?" Mrs. Fillingham asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Hubert exclaimed. "I seem to miss something.
I've got it&mdash;the absence of the uniform."</p>

<p>"They sent for it," Mrs. Fillingham said vaguely. She was dazed
for want of sleep. "The Emperor had to go to some function, and
that was the only uniform of the kind he happened to have. He was
to have gone away in it after his sitting to-day. My husband
persuaded him to leave it when it was here yesterday,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hubert had cried out suddenly as if in pain.</p>

<p>"He was here yesterday&mdash;here, with your husband, and your
husband with the diphtheria on him?"</p>

<p>Then the weary wife understood.</p>

<p>"Good heavens&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Hubert was already out of the room. He blundered on until he
came to a hansom cab creeping along in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Buckingham Palace," he gasped. "Drive like mad. A five-pound
note for you if you get me there by three o'clock!"</p>
<br>

<p>* * * * *</p>
<br>

<p>Already Devonshire Park was beginning to be talked about. It was
wonderful how the daily press got to the root of things. Hubert
caught sight of more than one contents bill as he drove home that
alluded to the strange epidemic.</p>

<p>Dr. Label joined Hubert presently in Mrs. Fillingham's home,
rubbing his huge hands together. He knew nothing of the new
dramatic developments. He asked where Hubert had been spending his
time.</p>

<p>"Trying to save the life of your friend, the Emperor of
Asturia," Hubert said. "He was here yesterday with Fillingham, and,
though he seems well enough at present, he may have the disease on
him now. What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>Hubert waited to see the great man stagger before the blow.
Label smiled and nodded as he proceeded to light a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Good job too," he said. "I am honorary physician to the court
of Asturia. I go back, there, as you know, when I finish my great
work here. The Emperor I have brought through four or five
illnesses, and if anything is wrong he always sends for me."</p>

<p>"But he might get the awful form of diphtheria!"</p>

<p>"Very likely," Label said coolly. "All these things are in the
hands of Providence. I know that man's constitution to a hair, and
if he gets the disease I shall pull him through for certain. I
should like him to have it."</p>

<p>"In the name of all that is practical, why?"</p>

<p>"To startle the public," Label cried. He was mounted on his
hobby now. He paced up and down the room in a whirl of tobacco
smoke. "It would bring the matter home to everybody. Then perhaps
something will be done. I preach and preach in vain. Only the
Lancet backs me up at all. Many times I have asked for a quarter of
a million of money, so that I can found a school for the electrical
treatment of germ diseases. I want to destroy all malaria. All dirt
in bulk, every bit of refuse that is likely to breed fever and the
like, should be treated by electricity. I would take huge masses of
deadly scourge and mountains of garbage, and render them innocent
by the electric current. But no; that costs money, and your
poverty-stricken Government cannot afford it. Given a current of
10,000 volts a year or two ago, and I could have rendered this one
of the healthiest places in England. You only wanted to run those
high voltage wires into the earth here and there, and behold the
millions are slain, wiped out, gone for ever. Perhaps I will get it
now."</p>
<br>

<p>* * * * *</p>
<br>

<p>London was beginning to get uneasy. There had been outbreaks
before, but they were of the normal type. People, for instance, are
not so frightened of smallpox as they used to be. Modern science
has learnt to grapple with the fell disease and rob it of half its
terrors. But this new and virulent form of diphtheria was another
matter.</p>

<p>Hubert sat over his dinner that night, making mental
calculations. There were nearly a thousand houses of varying sizes
in Devonshire Park. Would it be necessary to abandon these? He took
down a large scale map of London, and hastily marked in blue pencil
those areas which had developed rapidly of recent years. In nearly
all of these a vast amount of artificial ground had been necessary.
Hubert was appalled as he calculated the number of jerry-built
erections in these districts.</p>

<p>A servant came in and laid The Evening Wire upon the table.
Hubert glanced at it. Nothing had been lost in the way of
sensation. The story of the Emperor's visit to the district had
been given great prominence. An inquiry at Buckingham Palace had
elicited the fact that the story was true.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps no harm would come of it. Hubert finished a cigar
and prepared to go out. As he flung the paper aside a paragraph in
the stop press column&mdash;a solitary paragraph like an inky
island in a sea of white&mdash;caught his eye.</p>

<p>"No alarm need be experienced as to the danger encountered by
the Emperor of Asturia, but we are informed that His Majesty is
prevented from dining at Marlborough House to-night owing to a
slight cold and sore throat caught, it is stated, in the draughts
at Charing Cross Station. The Emperor will go down to Cowes as
arranged to-morrow."</p>

<p>Hubert shook his head doubtfully. The slight cold and sore
throat were ominous. His mind dwelt upon the shadow of trouble as
he made his way to the hospital. There had been two fresh cases
during the evening and the medical staff were looking anxious and
worried. They wanted assistance badly, and Hubert gave his to the
full.</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven before Hubert staggered home. In the main
business street of the suburb a news-shop was still open.</p>

<p>A flaming placard attracted the doctor's attention. It struck
him like a blow.</p>

<p>"Alarming illness of the Asturian Emperor. His Majesty stricken
down by the new disease. Latest bulletin from Buckingham
Palace."</p>

<p>Almost mechanically Hubert bought a paper. There was not much
beyond the curt information that the Emperor was dangerously
ill.</p>

<p>Arrived home Hubert found a telegram awaiting him. He tore it
open. The message was brief but to the point.</p>

<p>"Have been called in to Buckingham Palace, Label's diphtheria
certain. Shall try and see you to-morrow morning. Label."</p>

<p>London was touched deeply and sincerely. A great sovereign had
come over here in the most friendly fashion to show his good
feeling for a kindred race. On the very start of a round of
pleasure he had been stricken down like this.</p>

<p>The public knew all the details from the progress of that
fateful uniform to the thrilling eight o'clock bulletin when the
life of Rudolph III was declared to be in great danger. They knew
that Dr. Label had been sent for post haste. The big German was no
longer looked upon as a clever crank, but the one man who might be
able to save London from a terrible scourge. And from lip to lip
went the news that over two hundred cases of the new disease had
now broken out in Devonshire Park.</p>

<p>People knew pretty well what it was and what was the cause now.
Label's warning had come home with a force that nobody had
expected. He had stolen away quite late for half-an-hour to his own
house and there had been quite free with the pressmen. He
extenuated nothing. The thing was bad, and it was going to be
worse. So far as he could see, something of this kind w as
inevitable. If Londoners were so blind as to build houses on
teeming heaps of filth, why, London must be prepared to take the
consequences.</p>

<p>Hubert knew nothing of this. He had fallen back utterly
exhausted in his chair with the idea of taking a short
rest&mdash;for nearly three hours he had been fast asleep. Somebody
was shaking him roughly. He struggled back to the consciousness
that Label was bending over him.</p>

<p>"Well, you are a nice fellow," the German grumbled.</p>

<p>"I was dead beat and worn out," Hubert said apologetically. "How
is the Emperor?"</p>

<p>"His Majesty is doing as well as I can expect. It is a very bad
case, however. I have left him in competent hands, so that I could
run down here. They were asking for you at the hospital, presuming
that you were busy somewhere. The place is full, and so arc four
houses in the nearest terrace."</p>

<p>"Spreading like that?" Hubert exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Spreading like that! By this time tomorrow we shall have a
thousand cases on our hands. The authorities are doing everything
they can to help us, fresh doctors and nurses and stores are coming
in all the time."</p>

<p>"You turn people out of their houses to make way then?"</p>

<p>Label smiled grimly. He laid his hand on Hubert's shoulder, and
piloted him into the roadway. The place seemed to be alive with
cabs and vehicles of all kinds. It was as if all the inhabitants of
Devonshire Park were going away for their summer holidays
simultaneously. The electric arcs shone down on white and
frightened faces where joyous gaiety should have been. Here and
there a child slept peacefully, but on the whole it was a sorry
exodus.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="0603521h-images/0603521h-03.jpg" alt=
"It was as if all the inhabitants of Devonshire Park were going away">
</p>

<p>"There you are," Label said grimly. "It is a night flight from
the plague. It has been going on for hours. It would have been
finished now but for the difficulty in getting conveyances. Most of
the cabmen are avoiding the place as if it were accursed. But money
can command everything, hence the scene that you see before
you."</p>

<p>Hubert stood silently watching the procession. There was very
little luggage on any of the cabs or conveyances. Families were
going wholesale. Devonshire Park for the most part was an
exceedingly prosperous district, so that the difficulties of
emigration were not great. In their panic the people were
abandoning everything in the wild flight for life and safety.</p>

<p>Then he went in again to rest before the unknown labours of
to-morrow. Next morning he anxiously opened his morning paper.</p>

<p>It was not particularly pleasant reading beyond the information
that the health of the Emperor of Asturia was mentioned, and that
he had passed a satisfactory night. As to the rest, the plague was
spreading. There were two hundred and fifty cases in Devonshire
Park. Label's sayings had come true at last; it was a fearful
vindication of his prophecy. And the worst of it was that no man
could possibly say where it was going to end.</p>
<br>

<p>* * * * *</p>
<br>

<p>Strange as it may seem, London's anxiety as to the welfare of
one man blinded all to the great common danger. For the moment
Devonshire Park was forgotten. The one centre of vivid interest was
Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>For three days crowds collected there until at length Label and
his colleagues were in a position to issue a bulletin that gave
something more than hope. The Emperor of Asturia was going to
recover. Label was not the kind of man to say so unless he was
pretty sure of his ground.</p>

<p>It was not till this fact had soaked itself into the public mind
that attention was fully turned to the danger that threatened
London. Devonshire Park was practically in quarantine. All those
who could get away had done so, and those who had remained were
confined to their own particular district, and provisioned on a
system. The new plague was spreading fast.</p>

<p>In more than one quarter the suggestion was made that all houses
in certain localities should be destroyed, and the ground
thoroughly cleansed and disinfected. It would mean a loss of
millions of money, but in the scare of the moment London cared
nothing for that.</p>

<p>At the end of a week there were seven thousand cases of the new
form of diphtheria under treatment. Over one thousand cases a day
came in. Devonshire Park was practically deserted save for the
poorer quarters, whence the victims came. It seemed strange to see
fine houses abandoned to the first comer who had the hardihood to
enter. Devonshire Park was a stricken kingdom within itself, and
the Commune of terror reigned.</p>

<p>Enterprising journalists penetrated the barred area and wrote
articles about it. One of the fraternity bolder than the rest
passed a day and night in one of these deserted palatial
residences, and gave his sensations to the Press. Within a few
hours most of the villas were inhabited again! There were scores of
men and women in the slums who have not the slightest fear of
disease&mdash;they are too familiar with it for that&mdash;and they
came creeping westward in search of shelter. The smiling paradise
had become a kind of Tom Tiddlers ground, a huge estate in
Chancery.</p>

<p>Nobody had troubled, the tenants were busy finding pure quarters
elsewhere, the owners of the property were fighting public opinion
to save what in many cases was their sole source of income. If
Devonshire Park had to be razed to the ground many a wealthy man
would be ruined.</p>

<p>It was nearly the end of the first week before this abnormal
state of affairs was fully brought home to Hubert. He had been
harassed and worried and worn by want of sleep, but tired as he was
he did not fail to notice the number of poorer patients who
dribbled regularly into the terrace of houses that now formed the
hospital. There was something about them that suggested any
district rather than Devonshire Park.</p>

<p>"What does it mean, Walker?" he asked one of his doctors.</p>

<p>Walker had just come in from his hour's exercise, heated and
excited.</p>

<p>"It's a perfect scandal," he cried. "The police are fighting shy
of us altogether. I've just been up to the station and they tell me
it is a difficult matter to keep competent of officers in the
district. All along Frinton Hill and Eversley Gardens the houses
are crowded with outcasts. They have drifted here from the East End
and are making some of those splendid residences impossible."</p>

<p>Hubert struggled into his hat and coat, and went out. It was
exactly as Walker had said. Here was a fine residence with stables
and greenhouses and the like, actually occupied by Whitechapel at
its worst. A group of dingy children played on the lawn, and a
woman with the accumulated grime of weeks on her face was hanging
something that passed for washing out of an upper window. The
flower beds were trampled down, a couple of attenuated donkeys
browsed on the lawn.</p>

"Occupied by Whitechapel at its worst">
</p>

<p>Hubert strolled up to the house fuming. Two men were sprawling
on a couple of morocco chairs smoking filthy pipes. They looked up
at the newcomer with languid curiosity. They appeared quite to
appreciate the fact that they were absolutely masters of the
situation.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" Hubert demanded.</p>

<p>"If you're the owner well and good," was the reply. "If not, you
take an' 'ook it. We know which side our bread's buttered."</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to accept this philosophical
suggestion. Hubert swallowed his rising indignation and departed.
There were other evidences of the ragged invasion as he went down
the road. Here and there a house was closed and the blinds down;
but it was an exception rather than the rule.</p>

<p>Hubert walked away till he could find a cab, and was driven off
to Scotland Yard in a state of indignation. The view of the matter
rather startled the officials there.</p>

<p>"We have been so busy," the Chief Inspector said; "but the
matter shall be attended to. Dr. Label was here yesterday, and at
his suggestion we are having the whole force electrically
treated&mdash;a kind of electrical hardening of the throat. The
doctor claims that his recent treatment is as efficacious against
the diphtheria as vaccination is against smallpox. It is in all the
papers to-day. All London will be going mad over the new remedy
to-morrow."</p>

<p>Hubert nodded thoughtfully. The electric treatment seemed the
right thing. Label had shown him what an effect the application of
the current had had on the teeming mass of matter taken from the
road cutting. He thought it over until he fell asleep in his cab on
the way back to his weary labours.</p>
<br>

<p>* * * * *</p>
<br>

<p>London raged for the new remedy. The electric treatment for
throat troubles is no new thing. In this case it was simple and
painless, and it had been guaranteed by one of the popular heroes
of the hour. A week before Label had been regarded as a crank and a
faddist; now people were ready to swear by him. Had he not
prophesied this vile disease for years, and was he not the only man
who had a remedy? And the Emperor of Asturia was mending
rapidly.</p>

<p>Had Label bidden the people to stand on their heads for an hour
a day as a sovereign specific they would have done so gladly. Every
private doctor and every public institution was worked to death. At
the end of ten days practically all London had been treated. There
was nothing for it now but to wait patiently for the result.</p>

<p>Another week passed and then suddenly the inrush of cases began
to drop. The average at the end of the second week was down to
eighty per day. On the seventeenth and eighteenth days there were
only four cases altogether and in each instance they proved to be
patients who had not submitted themselves to the treatment.</p>

<p>The scourge was over. Two days elapsed and there were no fresh
cases whatever. Some time before a strong posse of police had
swamped down upon Devonshire Park and cleared all the slum people
out of their luxurious quarters. One or two of the bolder dwellers
in that once favoured locality began to creep back. Now that they
were inoculated there seemed little to fear.</p>

<p>But Label had something to say about that. He felt that he was
free to act now, he had his royal patient practically off his
hands. A strong Royal Commission had been appointed by Parliament
to go at once thoroughly into the matter.</p>

<p>"And I am the first witness called," he chuckled to Hubert as
the latter sat with the great German smoking a well-earned cigar.
"I shall be able to tell a few things."</p>

<p>He shook his big head and smiled. The exertion of the last few
weeks did not seem to have told upon him in the slightest.</p>

<p>"I also have been summoned," Hubert said. "But you don't suggest
that those fine houses should be destroyed?"</p>

<p>"I don't suggest anything. I am going to confine myself to
facts. One of your patent medicine advertisements says that
electricity is life. Never was a truer word spoken. What has saved
London from a great scourge? Electricity. What kills this new
disease and renders it powerless? Electricity. And what is the
great agent to fight dirt and filth with whenever it exists in
great quantities? Always electricity. It has not been done before
on the ground of expense, and look at the consequences. In one way
and another it will cost London 2,000,000 to settle this matter. It
was only a little over a third of that I asked for. Wait till you
hear me talk!"</p>
<br>

<p>* * * * *</p>
<br>

<p>Naturally the greatest interest was taken in the early sittings
of the Commission. A somewhat pompous chairman was prepared to
exploit Label for his own gratification and self-glory. But the big
German would have none of it. From the very first he dominated the
Committee, he would give his evidence in his own way, he would
speak of facts as he found them. And, after all, he was the only
man there who had any practical knowledge of the subject of the
inquiry.</p>

<p>"You would destroy the houses?" an interested member asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind," Label growled. "Not so much as a single
pig-sty. If you ask me what electricity is I cannot tell you. It is
a force in nature that as yet we don't understand. Originally it
was employed as a destroyer of sewage, but it was abandoned as too
expensive. You are the richest country in the world, and one of the
most densely populated. Yet you are covering the land with
jerry-built houses, the drainages of which will frequently want
looking to. And your only way of discovering this is when a bad
epidemic breaks out. Everything is too expensive. You will be a
jerry-built people in a jerry-built empire. And your local
authorities adopt some cheap system and then smile at the
ratepayers and call for applause. Electricity will save all danger.
It is dear at first, but it is far cheaper in the long run."</p>

<p>"If you will be so good as to get to the point," the chairman
suggested.</p>

<p>Label smiled pityingly. He was like a schoolmaster addressing a
form of little boys.</p>

<p>"The remedy is simple," he said. "I propose to have a couple of
10,000 volts wires discharging their current into the ground here
and there over the affected area. Inoculation against the trouble
is all very well, but it is not permanent and there is always
danger whilst the source of it remains. I propose to remove the
evil. Don't ask me what the process is, don't ask me what wonderful
action takes place. All I know is that some marvellous agency gets
to work and that a huge mound of live disease is rendered safe and
innocent as pure water. And I want these things now, I don't want
long sittings and reports and discussions. Let me work the cure and
you can have all the talking and sittings you like afterwards."</p>

<p>Label got his own way, he would have got anything he liked at
that moment. London was quiet and humble and in a mood to be
generous.</p>
<br>

<p>* * * * *</p>
<br>

<p>Label stood over the cutting whence he had procured the original
specimen of all the mischief. He was a little quiet and subdued,
but his eyes shone and his hand was a trifle unsteady. His fingers
trembled as he took up a fragment of the blue grey stratum and
broke it up.</p>

<p>"Marvellous mystery," he cried. "We placed the wires in the
earth and that great, silent, powerful servant has done the rest.
Underground the current radiates, and, as it radiates, the source
of the disease grows less and less until it ceases to be
altogether. Only try this in the tainted areas of all towns and in
a short time disease of all kinds would cease for ever."</p>

<p>"You are sure that stuff is wholesome, now?" Hubert asked.</p>

<p>"My future on it," Label cried. "Wait till we get it under the
microscope. I am absolutely confident that I am correct."</p>

<p>And he was.</p>
