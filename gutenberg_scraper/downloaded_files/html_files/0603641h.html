<h1>The Hammer of the Gods</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>John York Cabot</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>DEEP in the jungle the tribal drums were throbbing with savage
passion, their pulsating rhythm carrying clearly to the ears of the
gigantic, superbly muscled barbarian who moved in great strides along
the tangled underpath.</p>

<p>He was a handsome creature, this barbarian. Handsome as the
panther is handsome, or the man-killing tiger. Strong features,
cruelly chiseled, were beneath his mat of fierce hair. His body was
hard and brown, clad in the skin of a jungle cat. And yet for all the
strength and power of him, he moved through the twisted underbrush
with the stealthy swiftness of an animal.</p>

<p>Across his back, carried as carelessly as though it might be but a
load of twig kindling, was the still bleeding carcass of a freshly
slain boar. Food for the tribal feasting. The smell of the animal's
blood, hot and sweet in his nostrils, made the barbarian grin in
anticipation.</p>

<p>"Ayi," he thought with savage satisfaction, "I, Tokar, return to
the tribal campfires with meat for the bellies of my people."</p>

<p>And he grinned again in wolfish glee at the thought he had
half-whispered in the murky twilight. For this very evening he,
Tokar, The Mighty, would gain supremacy among his tribal fellows,
would gain the honor of Tribal King. He, Tokar, would gain all this
by overthrowing Orlo, the present tribal king.</p>

<p>"Ayi," he told himself righteously, "do I not bring the most meat
to the tribal kettles? Am I not the swiftest of foot and the quickest
in battle? Am I not Tokar, The Mighty? It is only right that I wrest
the rule of the tribe from the weak hands of Orlo!"</p>

<p>The thought made Tokar feel good inside, and he took up a savage
humming chant as he strode along, unconsciously moving to the rhythm
of the booming jungle drums. For Tokar was not only thinking of the
honor which he had long felt was due him, the honor of tribal
kingship. He thought, too, of the spoils that would be his when he
had slain Orlo.</p>

<p>Orlo had rich compounds, and Orlo, as befitted a tribal king, had
strong women to work for him. All these would go to Tokar. All these
and something else--The God Hammer.</p>

<p>At the thought of the God Hammer, the gigantic barbarian ran his
tongue across his lips, shivering involuntarily. For was not the God
Hammer a magic thing? Was it not glittering and shining in its magic
power? Was it not the most prized trophy of the campfires?</p>

<p>"Ayi," Tokar wet his lips in anticipation at the thought, "the God
Hammer, too, will be mine. Before the campfires are cold in the murk
of morning, it will be mine!"</p>

<p>AQUARTER the length of a man's arm, cold and hard, with a
hammer-like head on one end--that was the God Hammer. But, unlike war
dubs, it was not of stone. It was of some magical substance, smooth
and solid. Tokar had touched it once, unobserved by Orlo, and he
shivered now, remembering the feel of it.</p>

<p>At the blunt end of the God Hammer there was a sort of magical
ring, the very sight of which filled Tokar with a burning primitive
curiosity. Again and again he had turned over the mystery of this
ring in his mind, and again and again had found no answer. His desire
to possess the God Hammer was increased to a feverish intensity
because of his insatiable curiosity over the magic ring. The
possession of such magic would be worth even more than Orlo's rich
compounds and strong women.</p>

<p>Thus Tokar reasoned, while he hummed his savage chant and strode
lightly along the tangled trail to the rhythm of the jungle
drums.</p>

<p>All day, as he had stalked the wild boar, the thought of the God
Hammer had been in his barbaric mind. And now, as his great strides
bore him toward the village campfires at the end of day, the very
drums seemed to throb his desire. The God Hammer. The God Hammer.
Tokar, Tribal King, Possessor of The God Hammer.</p>

<p>The huge barbarian quickened his step, eager to gain the village.
Already he was anticipating with raw relish the challenge he would
fling at Orlo. On and on he moved, while the twilight deepened into
dusk, and the dusk into night.</p>

<p>At length, through the tangled foliage of jungle growth, Tokar saw
the first flickers of the flaming tribal fires. The path he trod grew
wider and more clear, until at last he had view of the village a
scant few hundred yards ahead.</p>

<p>By now the jungle drums were booming, thundering, in his ears, and
the shrill cries of the dancing women came clearly to him. He smiled,
knowing that the ceremony for the Feast had started, that Orlo was
already at the campfires.</p>

<p>Dogs came dashing up to him from the village, yapping and nipping
at his heels, followed by children of the tribe who squealed joyously
at the sight of the freshly slain boar he carried.</p>

<p>Tokar was grinning widely now, his sharp white teeth shining like
wolfish fangs, and he strode forward toward the campfire circles
where his fellows awaited him. The campfire circles, where the drums
throbbed and the women danced, and Orlo sat unsuspecting--holding the
God Hammer.</p>

<p>Alone, Tokar made his way to the largest of the campfire circles.
The Circle of the Braves, where Orlo presided over the wise men and
tribal elders. Where Orlo ruled with the God Hammer in hand. Tokar
was conscious of the admiring eyes of his fellows as he strode into
the center of the circle.</p>

<p>With a grunt, Tokar swung the slain boar down from his thickly
muscled shoulder, dropping it to the earth. The cries of acclaim that
came from his fellow tribesmen were music in his ears. Then the old
crones, babbling happily, came from their kettles to group around the
carcass of the kill. They stood there, motionless, while the
campfires roared approval and Tokar, in the custom of the tribe, drew
his stone knife, hacking off the left hind leg of the slain
beast.</p>

<p>The drums were pounding wildly, now, while Tokar wrenched the leg
free from the carcass, holding it aloft triumphantly, sinking his
fanged teeth into the raw meat. Fresh blood ran down the sides of his
cruel mouth.</p>

<p>BUT even as he gnawed the boar's leg, Tokar's glittering eyes
sought out Orlo. Sought out Orlo, who squatted in state on a mud dais
less that twenty yards from him, holding the God Hammer as a king
might hold a sceptre.</p>

<p>Orlo, too, was huge and heavily muscled. But he was of lighter
complexion than Tokar. His hair was light, while Tokar's was dark.
And Tokar knew that he need have no fear of Orlo, for he, Tokar, was
faster, stronger, than the man who held the God Staff.</p>

<p>Tokar dropped the boar's leg, holding his great arms high for
silence. The wild cadence of the drums ceased abruptly, and Tokar
faced Orlo directly, his wolf fangs exposed in a menacing grin.</p>

<p>Loudly then, Tokar trumpeted his challenge. Bellowed it so all
could hear.</p>

<p>He saw the startled incredulity that leaped to Orlo's eyes, knew,
with intense satisfaction, that he had caught him unprepared. Tokar
grinned again, moved cat-like toward Orlo's dais.</p>

<p>Orlo had risen from the dais, God Hammer still in hand, surprise
still stamped on his face. After the first shocked silence that fell
over the campfires at Tokar's challenge, a throaty, savage murmur was
rising from the tribesmen. A guttural growl of delight. There would
be battle to give zest to the feasting.</p>

<p>Those around the fires remained motionless, according to tribal
custom, making no attempt to interfere on either side. Tokar was
going to fight for kingship. If he won, he would lead them. If not,
Orlo would slay him. It was as simple as that. Tribal tradition gave
any brave the right to challenge for kingship.</p>

<p>The drums had started again, and the fires leaped higher as men
threw wood on them to better illumine the battle scene.</p>

<p>Tokar and Orlo were less than four feet apart, now, and were
starting the preliminary circling, looking for openings. Orlo still
held the God Hammer, and Tokar, seeing this, drew his stone knife
again. He could read the fear in Orlo's eyes, and knew that the other
could not depend on the magic of the God Hammer to aid him.</p>

<p>Then Tokar, bellowing wildly, lunged in on Orlo.</p>

<p>His great paws found Orlo's waist, and his thickly-muscled
shoulder drove hard into his adversary's stomach. With his free hand,
Orlo seized Tokar's mat of black hair, and with his other he tried to
bring the God Hammer club-like down on his opponent's skull.</p>

<p>But Tokar had thrown him off balance, and now they were both
pitching to the earth. Tokar had one hand free, now, and was driving
his stone knife again and again into Orlo's shoulder, feeling the hot
blood run stickily against his own throat.</p>

<p>They pitched wildly back and forth on the ground, first Tokar,
then Orlo, gaining top position. But as they struggled, Tokar drove
his stone blade home again and again wherever he found flesh. By now,
some of Orlo's blood was in Tokar's mouth, and the taste filled him
with triumph and strength.</p>

<p>Again and again, Tokar managed to roll free from the blows of the
hard God Hammer, and at last he was able to seize Orlo's arm, bending
it back until it snapped like a dry twig. The Hammer fell uselessly
to the ground, and Tokar heard Orlo's grunt of pain. Then he sprang
to his feet, seizing the God Hammer as he did so.</p>

<p>Orlo was slower rising, but Tokar permitted him to do so while the
wild hammering of the drums and the babbling roar of voices from
around the circle filled him with a heady intoxication. In his hand
was the cool, hard, club--like weight of the God Hammer. In his heart
was the savage certainty of victory, for Orlo was badly wounded.</p>

<p>TOKAR watched him pull himself to his feet, grinning at the sight
of the blood that soaked his opponent's body. Orlo had been slashed
by the stone knife at least twenty times, and his right arm hung
broken and useless by his side.</p>

<p>The tribesmen were screaming for the kill, screaming for Tokar,
their new king. And Orlo, dazed, bloody, and beaten, swayed drunkenly
before him. Tokar stepped in, raising the God Hammer high above his
head.</p>

<p>Orlo was too late in putting up his hands to ward off the blow of
the God Hammer. Tokar brought the shining, hard Hammer down on Orlo's
skull with crushing force. Orlo started to slump to the earth, and
Tokar raised the club again and again, beating him across the head
with it until Orlo lay motionless and crushed on the bloodstained
mud.</p>

<p>And then the savage cadence of the drums became a wild, hysterical
rhythm, while Tokar, licking his lips and baring his fanged teeth in
wolf grins of triumph, held the God Hammer high above his head,
waving it back and forth as a symbol of victory.</p>

<p>The flames leaped weirdly around the circle, throwing into sudden
brilliance victor and vanquished, and the drums pitched into an
incredible frenzy. Around the campfires a harsh, barbaric chant
began, taken up by the voices of all the tribesmen until it was a
wild, maddened song of blood and triumph.</p>

<p>Tokar made his way to the mud dais which had been Orlo's throne
until now, head held high, chest thrust out, strutting like a
peacock, the wild shouts of his fellows ringing in his ears. The
women started a tribal dance, and crones brought food and drink to
him.</p>

<p>But Tokar paid scant attention to all this, for his eyes were
fixed lovingly on the God Hammer. It was his now. Ayi! His to
control, his to work magic with. And he could find out, now, its
secrets. Even to the magic ring.</p>

<p>In rapt fascination, Tokar inspected the God Hammer, his fingers
touching the ring as he turned it about in his hands. There were
queer symbols on the staff of the Hammer, evidently God Writing.
Tokar's brow creased in perplexity. The God Writing was unlike the
picture symbols which the wise men of his tribe inscribed on cave
walls. Indeed, these were God Symbols.</p>

<p>He shook his head, looking at the symbols. They were strange,
perfectly cut in the staff of the Hammer.</p>

<p>Tokar grinned, licking his lips foolishly in bewilderment.
Perhaps, later, he would let the wise men of the tribe attempt to
decipher these symbols. But now--there was the ring.</p>

<p>Inspecting the ring closely, Tokar saw that, by pulling it, he
could release a pin at the base of the Hammer's head. Grinning in
savage excitement, Tokar pulled the ring.</p>

<p>Tokar, the Mighty One, was momentarily conscious of a blazing,
blinding, searing, explosion. An explosion which insured the fact
that Tokar would never be conscious of anything again. . . .</p>

<p>Never would the wise men of his tribe have the chance to decipher
the strange, evenly cut God-Symbols which Tokar had seen on the base
of the God Hammer. The symbols that read---</p>
