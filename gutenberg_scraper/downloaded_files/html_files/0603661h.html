<h1>Monsieur De Guise</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Perley Poore Sheehan</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>That any one should live in the center of Cedar Swamp was in
itself so singular as to set all sorts of queer ideas to running
through my head.</p>

<p>A more sinister morass I had never seen. It was as beautiful and
deadly as one of its own red mocassins, as treacherous and
fascinating.</p>

<p>It was a tangle of cypress and cedar almost thirty miles square,
most of it under water--a maze of jungle-covered islands and black
bayous. There were alligators and panthers, bear and wild pig. There
were groans and grunts and queer cries at night, and silence, dead
silence by day.</p>

<p>That was Cedar Swamp as I knew it after a week of solitary hunting
there. I no longer missed the sun. My eyes had become used to the
perpetual twilight. My nerves no longer bothered me when I stepped
into opaque water, or watched a section of gliding snake. But the
silence was getting to be more than I could bear. It was too
uncanny.</p>

<p>And now, just after I had noticed it, and wondered at it for the
hundredth time, I heard a voice.</p>

<p>It was low and clear--that of a woman who sings alto. There were
four or five notes like the fragment of a strange song. And then,
before I had recovered from the shock of it, there was silence
again.</p>

<p>I was up to my knees in water at the time, wading a narrow branch
between two islands. I must have stood there for a full minute
waiting for the voice to resume, but the silence closed in on me
deeper than ever. With a little shiver creeping over one part of my
body after another, I stole ashore.</p>

<p>The island was one of the highest I had yet encountered. I had not
taken a dozen steps up through the dank growth of its shelving shore
before I found a deeply worn path.</p>

<p>This, I could see, ran down to the water-front on one direction,
where I caught a glimpse of a boat-house masked by trees. I turned
and followed the path in the other direction up a gentle slope.</p>

<p>As I advanced, the jungle around me thinned out and became almost
park-like. There were open stretches of meadow and clumps of trees,
suggesting a garden. But I was so intent on discovering the owner of
the voice that the wonder of this did not at first impress me. I had,
moreover, an eery, uneasy sensation of being watched.</p>

<p>I walked slowly. I carried my gun with affected carelessness. I
looked around me as though I were a mere tourist dropped in to see
the sights.</p>

<p>I had thus covered, perhaps, a quarter of a mile, when the path
turned into an avenue of cabbage-palmetto, at the further end of
which I saw a house.</p>

<p>It was large and white with a pillared porch, such as they used to
build before the war. It was shaded by a magnificent grove of
live-oak trees. There were beds of geranium and roses in front, and
clusters of crepe-myrtle and flowering oleander on a well-clipped
lawn.</p>

<p>It all gave an impression of infinite care, of painstaking
up-keep, of neatness and wealth, yet, there was not a soul in sight.
Not a servant was there. No dog barked, I saw no horses, no chickens,
no pigeons, nor sheep; no familiar animate emblem whatever of the
prosperous farm.</p>

<p>I stood in the presence of this silent and lonely magnificence
with a feeling that was not exactly fear, but rather stupefaction.
For a moment I was persuaded that I had emerged from the great swamp
into some unknown plantation of its littoral.</p>

<p>But a moment was enough to convince me that this could not be. I
was, without the slightest doubt, almost at the exact center of the
morass. I was too familiar with its circumference and general contour
to be wrong as to that. For a dozen miles at least, in every
direction, Cedar Swamp surrounded this island of mystery with its own
mysterious forests and bayous.</p>

<p>Once again I was acutely aware of being stared at. Almost at the
same instant a man's voice addressed me from behind my back.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," it asked, "why do you hesitate?"</p>

<p>I might as well confess it right away--I believe in ghosts. I have
seen too many things in my life that were not to be explained by the
commonly accepted laws of nature. I have lived too much among the
half-civilized and learned too much of their odd wisdom to recognize
any hard and fast definition of what is real and what is not.</p>

<p>From the moment I heard that bit of song in the swamp, I felt that
I was passing from the commonplace into the weird. My succeeding
impressions had confirmed this feeling.</p>

<p>And now, when I heard the voice behind me: "Monsieur, why do you
hcsitate?"--I was not sure that it was the voice of a human being at
all. I turned slowly, my mind telling me that I should see no
one.</p>

<p>It was with a distinct feeling of relief, therefore, that I saw a
small, pale, well-dressed old man smiling at me as though he had read
my secret thoughts.</p>

<p>His face was cleanly shaven and bloodless. His head, partly
covered by a black velvet skull-cap, was extremely large. His
snow-white hair was silky and long. His eves, which were deeply
sunken, were large and dark. His appearance, as well as the question
which he had just put to mc suggested the foreigner. He was not alone
un-American; he appeared to be of another century, as well.</p>

<p>I said something about intruding. He made a brusk gesture, almost
of impatience, and, telling me to follow him, started for the
house.</p>

<p>It was as though I was an expected guest. Only the absence of
servants maintained that feeling of the bizarre, which never left
me.</p>

<p>The interior of the house was in keeping with its outward
appearance--sumptuous and immaculate. My host led me to the door of a
vast chamber on the first floor, motioned me to enter, and, standing
at the door, said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, luncheon will be served when you reappear. Pray, make
yourself at home."</p>

<p>Then he left me.</p>

<p>Two details of this room impressed mc: the superlative richness of
the toilet articles, all of which were engraved with a coat-of-arms,
and the portrait of a woman, by Largilli&eacute;re. All women were
beautiful to Largilli&eacute;re, but in the present instance he had
surpassed himself.</p>

<p>The gentle, aristocratic face, with its tender, lustrous eyes, was
the most alluring thing I had ever seen. At the bottom of the massive
frame was the inscription: "Anne-Marie, Duchesse de Guise. Anno
1733."</p>

<p>I was still marveling at the miracle which had brought such an
apparition to the heart of an American swamp when I heard a light
step in the hallway, and I knew that my host was awaiting me.</p>

<p>The luncheon, which was served cold in a splendid dining-room, had
been laid for two. I wondered at this, for still no servant appeared,
and surely I could not have been expected. And my host added to my
mystification rather than lessened it when he said: "Monsieur, I
offer you the place usually reserved for my wife.".Apart from this
simple statement, the meal was completed in silence. Now and then I
thought I surprised him, nodding gravely, as though someone else
where present.</p>

<p>I suspected him several times of speaking in an undertone. But, my
mind was so preoccupied with the inexplicable happenings of the
preceding hour that I was not in a condition to attack fresh
mysteries now.</p>

<p>He scarcely touched his food. Indeed, his presence there seemed to
be more in the nature of an act of courtesy than for the purpose of
taking nourishment. As soon as I had finished he arose and invited me
to follow him.</p>

<p>Across the hall was a music-room, with high French windows,
opening on the porch. He paused at one of these windows now and
plucked the flower from a potted heliotrope. The perfume of it seemed
to stimulate him strangely. He at once became more animated. A slight
trace of color mounted to his waxen cheeks. Turning to me, abruptly,
he remarked:</p>

<p>"I mentioned just now my wife. Perhaps you noticed her
portrait?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, a faint breath of the heliotrope came to me, and with
it, by one of those odd associations of ideas, the portrait by
Largilli&eacute;re. I saw again the gentle face and the lustrous
eyes, but the date--1733. Surely, this was not the portrait he
referred to.</p>

<p>But he had seen the perplexity in my face, and he broke out in
French: "Oui, oui; c'est moi, monsieur de Guise." And then, in
English: "It was the portrait of my wife you saw, madame la duchesse
par monsieur Largilliere."</p>

<p>"But then, madame, your wife," I stammered, "is dead."</p>

<p>He was still smelling the heliotrope. He looked up at me with his
somber eyes for a moment as though he had failed to grasp my meaning.
Then he said:</p>

<p>"No, no. There is no such thing as death--only life. For, what is
life?--the smile, the perfume, the voice. Ah, the voice! Will you
hear her sing?"</p>

<p>For a brief instant my head turned giddily. The world I had always
known, the world of tragedies, of sorrows, of physical joys and
pains, the world of life and death, in short, was whirling away from
beneath my feet.</p>

<p>And I began to recall certain old stories I had heard about the
visible servants of the invisible, the earthly agents of the
unearthly. Such things have been known to exist.</p>

<p>M. de Guise was walking up and down the room murmuring to himself
in French. I could catch an occasional word of endearment. Once I saw
him distinctly press the heliotrope to his lips. He had forgotten my
presence, apparently. He was in the company of some one whom he alone
could see. And then he seated himself at the piano.</p>

<p>I had a presentiment of what was coming. I dropped into a chair
and closed my eyes.</p>

<p>Again the heliotrope perfumed the air around me. I saw the smooth
brow, the sympathetic eyes, the magic smile of the Duchesse de Guise,
and then a voice--that voice I had heard in the swamp--began to sing,
so soft, so sweet, that a little spasm twitched at my throat and a
chill crept down my back.</p>

<p>It was a love-song, such as they sang centuries ago. I know little
French, but it told of love in life and death--"Moi, je t'ai, vive et
morte, incessament aim&eacute;e."</p>

<p>And when I opened my eyes again, all that I saw was the shrivelled
black figure of Monsieur de Guise, his silvered head thrown back with
the air of one who has seen a vision.</p>

<p>Subconsciously I had heard something else while listening to the
song. It was the swift, muffled throb of an approaching motor-boat.
M. de Guise had heard it, too, for now he left the piano and
approached the window. Presently, I could see a dozen negroes
approaching along the avenue of palms. They seemed strangely silent
for their race.</p>

<p>"These are my people," said my host. "Once a week I send them to
the village. They will carry you away."</p>

<p>The afternoon was far advanced when I bade M. de Guise farewell.
As I looked back for the last time the sunset was rapidly dissolving
the great white house and its gardens in a golden haze.</p>

<p>His figure on the porch was all that linked it to the world of
man.</p>

<p>Late that night I was landed at a corner of Cedar Swamp, adjacent
to my home. My black boatman, who had spoken never a word immediately
backed his barge away into the darkness, leaving me there alone.</p>

<p>And, although I have since made several efforts to repeat my visit
to M. de Guise, I have never been successful. Once, indeed, I found
again what I believed to be his island, but it was covered entirely
with a dense, forbidding jungle. Which will doubtless discredit this
story, as it has caused even me to reflect.</p>

<p>But grant that the story is true, and that M. de Guise was merely
mad. Why, then in a certain event, which I need not mention, may God
send me madness, too!</p>
