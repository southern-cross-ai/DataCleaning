  <p class="first">"IDIOTS!" howled Grant Calthorpe.
  "Fools&mdash;nitwits&mdash;imbeciles!" He sought wildly for some more
  expressive terms, failed and vented his exasperation in a vicious kick at the
  pile of rubbish on the ground.</p>

  <p>Too vicious a kick, in fact; he had again forgotten the one-third normal
  gravitation of Io, and his whole body followed his kick in a long,
  twelve-foot arc.</p>

  <p>As he struck the ground the four loonies giggled. Their great, idiotic
  heads, looking like nothing so much as the comic faces painted on Sunday
  balloons for children, swayed in unison on their five-foot necks, as thin as
  Grant's wrist.</p>

  <p>"Get out!" he blazed, scrambling erect. "Beat it, skiddoo, scram! No
  chocolate. No candy. Not until you learn that I want ferva leaves, and not
  any junk you happen to grab. Clear out!"</p>

  <p>The loonies&mdash;<i>Lunae Jovis Magnicapites</i>, or literally, Bigheads
  of Jupiter's Moon&mdash;backed away, giggling plaintively. Beyond doubt, they
  considered Grant fully as idiotic as he considered them, and were quite
  unable to understand the reasons for his anger. But they certainly realized
  that no candy was to be forthcoming, and their giggles took on a note of keen
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>So keen, indeed, that the leader, after twisting his ridiculous blue face
  in an imbecilic grin at Grant, voiced a last wild giggle and dashed his head
  against a glittering stone-bark tree. His companions casually picked up his
  body and moved off, with his head dragging behind them on its neck like a
  prisoner's ball on a chain.</p>

  <p>Grant brushed his hand across his forehead and turned wearily toward his
  stone-bark log shack. A pair of tiny, glittering red eyes caught his
  attention, and a slinker&mdash;<i>Mus Sapiens</i>&mdash;skipped his six-inch
  form across the threshold, bearing under his tiny, skinny arm what looked
  very much like Grant's clinical thermometer.</p>

  <p>Grant yelled angrily at the creature, seized a stone, and flung it vainly.
  At the edge of the brush, the slinker turned its ratlike, semihuman face
  toward him, squeaked its thin gibberish, shook a microscopic fist in manlike
  wrath, and vanished, its batlike cowl of skin fluttering like a cloak. It
  looked, indeed, very much like a black rat wearing a cape.</p>

  <p>It had been a mistake, Grant knew, to throw the stone at it. Now the tiny
  fiends would never permit him any peace, and their diminutive size and
  pseudo-human intelligence made them infernally troublesome as enemies. Yet,
  neither that reflection nor the loony's suicide troubled him particularly; he
  had witnessed instances like the latter too often, and besides, his head felt
  as if he were in for another siege of white fever.</p>

  <p>He entered the shack, closed the door, and stared down at his pet parcat.
  "Oliver," he growled, "you're a fine one. Why the devil don't you watch out
  for slinkers? What are you here for?"</p>

  <p>The parcat rose on its single, powerful hind leg, clawing at his knees
  with its two forelegs. "The red jack on the black queen," it observed
  placidly. "Ten loonies make one half-wit."</p>

  <p>Grant placed both statements easily. The first was, of course, an echo of
  his preceding evening's solitaire game, and the second of yesterday's session
  with the loonies. He grunted abstractedly and rubbed his aching head. White
  fever again, beyond doubt.</p>

  <p>He swallowed two ferverin tablets, and sank listlessly to the edge of his
  bunk, wondering whether this attack of <i>blancha</i> would culminate in
  delirium.</p>

  <p>He cursed himself for a fool for ever taking this job on Jupiter's third
  habitable moon, Io. The tiny world was a planet of madness, good for nothing
  except the production of ferva leaves, out of which Earthly chemists made as
  many potent alkaloids as they once made from opium.</p>

  <p>Invaluable to medical science, of course, but what difference did that
  make to him? What difference, even, did the munificent salary make, if he got
  back to Earth a raving maniac after a year in the equatorial regions of Io?
  He swore bitterly that when the plane from Junopolis landed next month for
  his ferva, he'd go back to the polar city with it, even though his contract
  with Neilan Drug called for a full year, and he'd get no pay if he broke it.
  What good was money to a lunatic?</p>

  <p>The whole little planet was mad&mdash;loonies, parcats, slinkers and Grant
  Calthorpe&mdash;all crazy. At least, anybody who ever ventured outside either
  of the two polar cities, Junopolis on the north and Herapolis on the south,
  was crazy. One could live there in safety from white fever, but anywhere
  below the twentieth parallel it was worse than the Cambodian jungles on
  Earth.</p>

  <p>He amused himself by dreaming of Earth. Just two years ago he had been
  happy there, known as a wealthy, popular sportsman. He had been just that
  too; before he was twenty-one he had hunted knife-kite and threadworm on
  Titan, and triops and uniped on Venus.</p>

  <p>That had been before the gold crisis of 2110 had wiped out his fortune.
  And&mdash;well, if he had to work, it had seemed logical to use his
  interplanetary experience as a means of livelihood. He had really been
  enthusiastic at the chance to associate himself with Neilan Drug.</p>

  <p>He had never been on Io before. This wild little world was no sportsman's
  paradise, with its idiotic loonies and wicked, intelligent, tiny slinkers.
  There wasn't anything worth hunting on the feverish little moon, bathed in
  warmth by the giant Jupiter only a quarter million miles away.</p>

  <p>If he <i>had</i> happened to visit it, he told himself ruefully, he'd
  never have taken the job; he had visualized Io as something like Titan, cold
  but clean.</p>

  <p>Instead it was as hot as the Venus Hotlands because of its glowing
  primary, and subject to half a dozen different forms of steamy
  daylight&mdash;sun day, Jovian day, Jovian and sun day, Europa light, and
  occasionally actual and dismal night. And most of these came in the course of
  Io's forty-two-hour revolution, too&mdash;a mad succession of changing
  lights. He hated the dizzy days, the jungle, and Idiots' Hills stretching
  behind his shack.</p>

  <p>It was Jovian and solar day at the present moment, and that was the worst
  of all, because the distant sun added its modicum of heat to that of Jupiter.
  And to complete Grant's discomfort now was the prospect of a white fever
  attack. He swore as his head gave an additional twinge, and then swallowed
  another ferverin tablet. His supply of these was diminishing, he noticed;
  he'd have to remember to ask for some when the plane called&mdash;no, he was
  going back with it.</p>

  <p>Oliver rubbed against his leg. "Idiots, fools, nitwits, imbeciles,"
  remarked the parcat affectionately. "Why did I have to go to that damn
  dance?"</p>

  <p>"Huh?" said Grant. He couldn't remember having said anything about a
  dance. It must, he decided, have been said during his last fever madness.</p>

  <p>Oliver creaked like the door, then giggled like a loony. "It'll be all
  right," he assured Grant. "Father is bound to come soon."</p>

  <p>"Father!" echoed the man. His father had died fifteen years before.
  "Where'd you get that from, Oliver?"</p>

  <p>"It must be the fever," observed Oliver placidly. "You're a nice kitty,
  but I wish you had sense enough to know what you're saying. And I wish father
  would come." He finished with a supressed gurgle that might have been a
  sob.</p>

  <p>Grant stared dizzily at him. He hadn't said any of those things; he was
  positive. The parcat must have heard them from somebody else&mdash; Somebody
  else? Where within five hundred miles was there anybody else?</p>

  <p>"Oliver!" he bellowed. "Where'd you hear that? Where'd you hear it?"</p>

  <p>The parcat backed away, startled. "Father is idiots, fools, nitwits,
  imbeciles," he said anxiously. "The red jack on the nice kitty."</p>

  <p>"Come here!" roared Grant. "Whose father? Where have you&mdash; Come here,
  you imp!"</p>

  <p>He lunged at the creature. Oliver flexed his single hind leg and flung
  himself frantically to the cowl of the wood stove. "It must be the fever!" he
  squalled. "No chocolate!"</p>

  <p>He leaped like a three-legged flash for the flue opening. There came a
  sound of claws grating on metal, and then he had scrambled through.</p>

  <p>Grant followed him. His head ached from the effort, and with the still
  sane part of his mind he knew that the whole episode was doubtless white
  fever delirium, but he plowed on.</p>

  <p>His progress was a nightmare. Loonies kept bobbing their long necks above
  the tall bleeding-grass, their idiotic giggles and imbecilic faces adding to
  the general atmosphere of madness.</p>

  <p>Wisps of fetid, fever-bearing vapors spouted up at every step on the
  spongy soil. Somewhere to his right a slinker squeaked and gibbered; he knew
  that a tiny slinker village was over in that direction, for once he had
  glimpsed the neat little buildings, constructed of small, perfectly fitted
  stones like a miniature medieval town, complete to towers and battlements. It
  was said that there were even slinker wars.</p>

  <p>His head buzzed and whirled from the combined effects of ferverin and
  fever. It was an attack of <i>blancha</i>, right enough, and he realized that
  he was an imbecile, a loony, to wander thus away from his shack. He should be
  lying on his bunk; the fever was not serious, but more than one man had died
  on Io, in the delirium, with its attendant hallucinations.</p>

  <p>He was delirious now. He knew it as soon as he saw Oliver, for Oliver was
  placidly regarding an attractive young lady in perfect evening dress of the
  style of the second decade of the twenty-second century. Very obviously that
  was a hallucination, since girls had no business in the Ionian tropics, and
  if by some wild chance one should appear there, she would certainly not
  choose formal garb.</p>

  <p>The hallucination had fever, apparently, for her face was pale with the
  whiteness that gave <i>blancha</i> its name. Her gray eyes regarded him
  without surprise as he wound his way through the bleeding-grass to her.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, evening, or morning," he remarked, giving a puzzled
  glance at Jupiter, which was rising, and the sun, which was setting. "Or
  perhaps merely good day, Miss Lee Neilan."</p>

  <p>She gazed seriously at him. "Do you know," she said, "you're the first one
  of the illusions that I haven't recognized? All my friends have been around,
  but you're the first stranger. Or are you a stranger? You know my
  name&mdash;but you ought to, of course, being my own hallucination."</p>

  <p>"We won't argue about which of us is the hallucination," he suggested.
  "Let's do it this way. The one of us that disappears first is the illusion.
  Bet you five dollars you do."</p>

  <p>"How could I collect?" she said. "I can't very well collect from my own
  dream."</p>

  <p>"That is a problem." He frowned. "My problem, of course, not yours. I know
  I'm real."</p>

  <p>"How do you know my name?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said. "From intensive reading of the society sections of the
  newspapers brought by my supply plane. As a matter of fact, I have one of
  your pictures cut out and pasted next to my bunk. That probably accounts for
  my seeing you now. I'd like to really meet you some time."</p>

  <p>"What a gallant remark for an apparition!" she exclaimed. "And who are you
  supposed to be?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I'm Grant Calthorpe. In fact, I work for your father, trading with
  the loonies for ferva."</p>

  <p>"Grant Calthorpe," she echoed. She narrowed her fever-dulled eyes as if to
  bring him into better focus. "Why, you are!"</p>

  <p>Her voice wavered for a moment, and she brushed her hand across her pale
  brow. "Why should you pop out of my memories? It's strange. Three or four
  years ago, when I was a romantic schoolgirl and you the famous sportsman, I
  was madly in love with you. I had a whole book filled with your
  pictures&mdash;Grant Calthorpe dressed in parka for hunting threadworms on
  Titan&mdash;Grant Calthorpe beside the giant uniped he killed near the
  Mountains of Eternity. You're-you're really the pleasantest hallucination
  I've had so far. Delirium would be&mdash;fun"&mdash;she pressed her hand to
  her brow again&mdash;"if one's head&mdash;didn't ache so!"</p>

  <p>"Gee!" thought Grant, "I wish that were true, that about the book. This is
  what psychology calls a wish-fulfillment dream." A drop of warm rain plopped
  on his neck. "Got to get to bed," he said aloud. "Rain's bad for
  <i>blancha</i>. Hope to see you next time I'm feverish."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Lee Neilan with dignity. "It's quite mutual."</p>

  <p>He nodded, sending a twinge through his head. "Here, Oliver," he said to
  the drowsing parcat. "Come on."</p>

  <p>"That isn't Oliver," said Lee. "It's Polly. It's kept me company for two
  days, and I've named it Polly."</p>

  <p>"Wrong gender," muttered Grant. "Anyway, it's my parcat, Oliver. Aren't
  you Oliver?"</p>

  <p>"Hope to see you," said Oliver sleepily.</p>

  <p>"It's Polly. Aren't you, Polly?"</p>

  <p>"Bet you five dollars," said the parcat. He rose, stretched and loped off
  into the underbrush. "It must be the fever," he observed as he vanished.</p>

  <p>"It must be," agreed Grant. He turned away. "Good-by, Miss&mdash;or I
  might as well call you Lee, since you're not real. Good-by, Lee."</p>

  <p>"Good-by, Grant. But don't go that way. There's a slinker village over in
  the grass."</p>

  <p>"No. It's over there."</p>

  <p>"It's <i>there</i>," she insisted. "I've been watching them build it. But
  they can't hurt you anyway, can they? Not even a slinker could hurt an
  apparition. Good-by, Grant." She closed her eyes wearily.</p>

  <p>It was raining harder now. Grant pushed his way through the bleeding-
  grass, whose red sap collected in bloody drops on his boots. He had to get
  back to his shack quickly, before the white fever and its attendant delirium
  set him wandering utterly astray. He needed ferverin.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stopped short. Directly before him the grass had been cleared
  away, and in the little clearing were the shoulder-high towers and
  battlements of a slinker village&mdash;a new one, for half-finished houses
  stood among the others, and hooded six-inch forms toiled over the stones.</p>

  <p>There was an outcry of squeaks and gibberish. He backed away, but a dozen
  tiny darts whizzed about him. One stuck like a toothpick in his boot, but
  none, luckily, scratched his skin, for they were undoubtedly poisoned. He
  moved more quickly, but all around in the thick, fleshy grasses were
  rustlings, squeakings, and incomprehensible imprecations.</p>

  <p>He circled away. Loonies kept popping their balloon heads over the
  vegetation, and now and again one giggled in pain as a slinker bit or stabbed
  it. Grant cut toward a group of the creatures, hoping to distract the tiny
  fiends in the grass, and a tall, purple-faced loony curved its long neck
  above him, giggling and gesturing with its skinny fingers at a bundle under
  its arm.</p>

  <p>He ignored the thing, and veered toward his shack. He seemed to have
  eluded the slinkers, so he trudged doggedly on, for he needed a ferverin
  tablet badly. Yet, suddenly he came to a frowning halt, turned, and began to
  retrace his steps.</p>

  <p>"It can't be so," he muttered. "But she told me the truth about the
  slinker village. I didn't know it was there. Yet how could a hallucination
  tell me something I didn't know?"</p>

  <br>

  <p>Lee Neilan was sitting on the stone-bark log exactly as he had left her
  with Oliver again at her side. Her eyes were closed, and two slinkers were
  cutting at the long skirt of her gown with tiny, glittering knives.</p>

  <p>Grant knew that they were always attracted by Terrestrial textiles;
  apparently they were unable to duplicate the fascinating sheen of satin,
  though the fiends were infernally clever with their tiny hands. As he
  approached, they tore a strip from thigh to ankle, but the girl made no move.
  Grant shouted, and the vicious little creatures mouthed unutterable curses at
  him, as they skittered away with their silken plunder.</p>

  <p>Lee Neilan opened her eyes. "You again," she murmured vaguely. "A moment
  ago it was father. Now it's you." Her pallor had increased; the white fever
  was running its course in her body.</p>

  <p>"Your father! Then that's where Oliver heard&mdash;Listen, Lee. I found
  the slinker village. I didn't know it was there, but I found it just as you
  said. Do you see what that means? We're both real!"</p>

  <p>"Real?" she said dully. "There's a purple loony grinning over your
  shoulder. Make him go away. He makes me feel&mdash;sick."</p>

  <p>He glanced around; true enough, the purple-faced loony was behind him.
  "Look here," he said, seizing her arm. The feel of her smooth skin was added
  proof. "You're coming to the shack for ferverin." He pulled her to her feet.
  "Don't you understand? I'm real!"</p>

  <p>"No, you're not," she said dazedly.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Lee. I don't know how in the devil you got here or why, but I
  know Io hasn't driven me that crazy yet. You're real and I'm real." He shook
  her violently. "I'm <i>real!</i>" he shouted.</p>

  <p>Faint comprehension showed in her dazed eyes. "Real?" she whispered.
  "Real! Oh, Lord! Then take&mdash;me out of this mad place!" She swayed, made
  a stubborn effort to control herself, then pitched forward against him.</p>

  <p>Of course on Io her weight was negligible, less than a third Earth normal.
  He swung her into his arms and set off toward the shack, keeping well away
  from both slinker settlements. Around him bobbed excited loonies, and now and
  again the purple-faced one, or another exactly like him, giggled and pointed
  and gestured.</p>

  <p>The rain had increased, and warm rivulets flowed down his neck, and to add
  to the madness, he blundered near a copse of stinging palms, and their barbed
  lashes stung painfully through his shirt. Those stings were virulent too, if
  one failed to disinfect them; indeed, it was largely the stinging palms that
  kept traders from gathering their own ferva instead of depending on the
  loonies.</p>

  <p>Behind the low rain clouds, the sun had set and it was ruddy Jupiter
  daylight, which lent a false flush to the cheeks of the unconscious Lee
  Neilan, making her still features very lovely.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he kept his eyes too steadily on her face, for suddenly Grant was
  among slinkers again; they were squeaking and sputtering, and the purple
  loony leaped in pain as teeth and darts pricked his legs. But, of course,
  loonies were immune to the poison.</p>

  <p>The tiny devils were around his feet now. He swore in a low voice and
  kicked vigorously, sending a ratlike form spinning fifty feet in the air. He
  had both automatic and flame pistol at his hip, but he could not use them for
  several reasons.</p>

  <p>First, using an automatic against the tiny hordes was much like firing
  into a swarm of mosquitoes; if the bullet killed one or two or a dozen, it
  made no appreciable impression on the remaining thousands. And as for the
  flame pistol, that was like using a Big Bertha to swat a fly. Its vast belch
  of fire would certainly incinerate all the slinkers in its immediate path,
  along with grass, trees, and loonies, but that again would make but little
  impress on the surviving hordes, and it meant laboriously recharging the
  pistol with another black diamond and another barrel.</p>

  <p>He had gas bulbs in the shack, but they were not available at the moment,
  and besides, he had no spare mask, and no chemist has yet succeeded in
  devising a gas that would kill slinkers without being also deadly to humans.
  And, finally, he couldn't use any weapon whatsoever right now, because he
  dared not drop Lee Neilan to free his hands.</p>

  <p>Ahead was the clearing around the shack. The space was full of slinkers,
  but the shack itself was supposed to be slinkerproof, at least for reasonable
  lengths of time, since stone-bark logs were very resistant to their tiny
  tools.</p>

  <p>But Grant perceived that a group of the diminutive devils were around the
  door, and suddenly he realized their intent. They had looped a cord of some
  sort over the knob, and were engaged now in twisting it!</p>

  <p>Grant yelled and broke into a run. While he was yet half a hundred feet
  distant, the door swung inward and the rabble of slinkers flowed into the
  shack.</p>

  <p>He dashed through the entrance. Within was turmoil. Little hooded shapes
  were cutting at the blankets on his bunk, his extra clothing, the sacks he
  hoped to fill with ferva leaves, and were pulling at the cooking utensils, or
  at any and all loose objects.</p>

  <p>He bellowed and kicked at the swarm. A wild chorus of squeaks and
  gibberish arose as the creatures skipped and dodged about him. The fiends
  were intelligent enough to realize that he could do nothing with his arms
  occupied by Lee Neilan. They skittered out of the way of his kicks, and while
  he threatened a group at the stove, another rabble tore at his blankets.</p>

  <p>In desperation he charged the bunk. He swept the girl's body across it to
  clear it, dropped her on it, and seized a grass broom he had made to
  facilitate his housekeeping. With wide strokes of its handle he attacked the
  slinkers, and the squeals were checkered by cries and whimpers of pain.</p>

  <p>A few broke for the door, dragging whatever loot they had. He spun around
  in time to see half a dozen swarming around Lee Neilan, tearing at her
  clothing, at the wrist watch on her arm, at the satin evening pumps on her
  small feet. He roared a curse at them and battered them away, hoping that
  none had pricked her skin with virulent dagger or poisonous tooth.</p>

  <p>He began to win the skirmish. More of the creatures drew their black capes
  close about them and scurried over the threshold with their plunder. At last,
  with a burst of squeaks, the remainder, laden and empty-handed alike, broke
  and ran for safety, leaving a dozen furry, impish bodies slain or
  wounded.</p>

  <p>Grant swept these after the others with his erstwhile weapon, closed the
  door in the face of a loony that bobbed in the opening, latched it against
  any repetition of the slinker's trick, and stared in dismay about the
  plundered dwelling.</p>

  <p>Cans had been rolled or dragged away. Every loose object had been pawed by
  the slinkers' foul little hands, and Grant's clothes hung in ruins on their
  hooks against the wall. But the tiny robbers had not succeeded in opening the
  cabinet nor the table drawer, and there was food left.</p>

  <p>Six months of Ionian life had left him philosophical; he swore heartily,
  shrugged resignedly, and pulled his bottle of ferverin from the cabinet.</p>

  <p>His own spell of fever had vanished as suddenly and completely as
  <i>blancha</i> always does when treated, but the girl, lacking ferverin, was
  paper-white and still. Grant glanced at the bottle; eight tablets
  remained.</p>

  <p>"Well, I can always chew ferva leaves," he muttered. That was less
  effective than the alkaloid itself, but it would serve, and Lee Neilan needed
  the tablets. He dissolved two of them in a glass of water, and lifted her
  head.</p>

  <p>She was not too inert to swallow, and he poured the solution between her
  pale lips, then arranged her as comfortably as he could. Her dress was a
  tattered silken ruin, and he covered her with a blanket that was no less a
  ruin. Then he disinfected his palm stings, pulled two chairs together, and
  sprawled across them to sleep.</p>

  <p>He started up at the sound of claws on the roof, but it was only Oliver,
  gingerly testing the flue to see if it were hot. In a moment the parcat
  scrambled through, stretched himself, and remarked, "I'm real and you're
  real."</p>

  <p>"Imagine that!" grunted Grant sleepily.</p>

  <div>
    <br>
  </div>

  <p>When he awoke it was Jupiter and Europa light, which meant he had slept
  about seven hours, since the brilliant little third moon was just rising. He
  rose and gazed at Lee Neilan, who was sleeping soundly with a tinge of color
  in her face that was not entirely due to the ruddy daylight. The
  <i>blancha</i> was passing.</p>

  <p>He dissolved two more tablets in water, then shook the girl's shoulder.
  Instantly her gray eyes opened, quite clear now, and she looked up at him
  without surprise.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Grant," she murmured. "So it's you again. Fever isn't so bad,
  after all."</p>

  <p>"Maybe I ought to let you stay feverish," he grinned. "You say such nice
  things. Wake up and drink this, Lee."</p>

  <p>She became suddenly aware of the shack's interior. "Why&mdash;Where is
  this? It looks&mdash;real!"</p>

  <p>"It is. Drink this ferverin."</p>

  <p>She obeyed, then lay back and stared at him perplexedly. "Real?" she said.
  "And you're real?"</p>

  <p>"I think I am."</p>

  <p>A rush of tears clouded her eyes. "Then&mdash;I'm out of that place? That
  horrible place?"</p>

  <p>"You certainly are." He saw signs of her relief becoming hysteria, and
  hastened to distract her. "Would you mind telling me how you happened to be
  there&mdash;and dressed for a party too?"</p>

  <p>She controlled herself. "I was dressed for a party. A party. A party in
  Herapolis. But I was in Junopolis, you see."</p>

  <p>"I don't see. In the first place, what are you doing on Io, anyway? Every
  time I ever heard of you, it was in connection with New York or Paris
  society."</p>

  <p>She smiled. "Then it wasn't all delirium, was it? You did say that you had
  one of my pictures&mdash;Oh, that one!" She frowned at the print on the wall.
  "Next time a news photographer wants to snap my picture, I'll remember not to
  grin like&mdash;like a loony. But as to how I happen to be on Io, I came with
  father, who's looking over the possibilities of raising ferva on plantations
  instead of having to depend on traders and loonies. We've been here three
  months, and I've been terribly bored. I thought Io would be exciting, but it
  wasn't&mdash;until recently."</p>

  <p>"But what about that dance? How'd you manage to get here, a thousand miles
  from Junopolis?"</p>

  <p>"Well," she said slowly, "it was terribly tiresome in Junopolis. No shows,
  no sport, nothing but an occasional dance. I got restless. When there were
  dances in Herapolis, I formed the habit of flying over there. It's only four
  or five hours in a fast plane, you know. And last week&mdash;or whatever it
  was&mdash;I'd planned on flying down, and Harvey&mdash;that's father's
  secretary&mdash;was to take me. But at the last minute father needed him and
  forbade my flying alone."</p>

  <p>Grant felt a strong dislike for Harvey. "Well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"So I flew alone," she finished demurely.</p>

  <p>"And cracked up, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I can fly as well as anybody," she retorted. "It was just that I followed
  a different route, and suddenly there were mountains ahead."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "The Idiots' Hills," he said. "My supply plane detours five
  hundred miles to avoid them. They're not high, but they stick right out above
  the atmosphere of this crazy planet. The air here is dense but shallow."</p>

  <p>"I know that. I knew I couldn't fly above them, but I thought I could
  hurdle them. Work up full speed, you know, and then throw the plane upward. I
  had a closed plane, and gravitation is so weak here. And besides, I've seen
  it done several times, especially with a rocket-driven craft. The jets help
  to support the plane even after the wings are useless for lack of air."</p>

  <p>"What a damn fool stunt!" exclaimed Grant. "Sure it can be done, but you
  have to be an expert to pull out of it when you hit the air on the other
  side. You hit fast, and there isn't much falling room."</p>

  <p>"So I found out," said Lee ruefully. "I almost pulled out, but not quite,
  and I hit in the middle of some stinging palms. I guess the crash dazed them,
  because I managed to get out before they started lashing around. But I
  couldn't reach my plane again, and it was&mdash;I only remember two days of
  it&mdash;but it was horrible!"</p>

  <p>"It must have been," he said gently.</p>

  <p>"I knew that if I didn't eat or drink, I had a chance of avoiding white
  fever. The not eating wasn't so bad, but the not drinking&mdash;well, I
  finally gave up and drank out of a brook. I didn't care what happened if I
  could have a few moments that weren't thirst-tortured. And after that it's
  all confused and vague."</p>

  <p>"You should have chewed ferva leaves."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that. I wouldn't have even known what they looked like, and
  besides, I kept expecting father to appear. He must be having a search made
  by now."</p>

  <p>"He probably is," rejoined Grant ironically. "Has it occurred to you that
  there are thirteen million square miles of surface on little Io? And that for
  all he knows, you might have crashed on any square mile of it? When you're
  flying from north pole to south pole, there <i>isn't</i> any shortest route.
  You can cross any point on the planet."</p>

  <p>Her gray eyes started wide. "But I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Furthermore," said Grant, "this is probably the <i>last</i> place a
  searching party would look. They wouldn't think anyone but a loony would try
  to hurdle Idiots' Hills, in which thesis I quite agree. So it looks very
  much, Lee Neilan, as if you're marooned here until my supply plane gets here
  next month!"</p>

  <p>"But father will be crazy! He'll think I'm dead!"</p>

  <p>"He thinks that now, no doubt."</p>

  <p>"But we can't&mdash;" She broke off, staring around the tiny shack's
  single room. After a moment she sighed resignedly, smiled, and said softly,
  "Well, it might have been worse, Grant. I'll try to earn my keep."</p>

  <p>"Good. How do you feel, Lee?"</p>

  <p>"Quite normal. I'll start right to work." She flung off the tattered
  blanket, sat up, and dropped her feet to the floor. "I'll fix dinn&mdash;Good
  night! My dress!" She snatched the blanket about her again.</p>

  <p>He grinned. "We had a little run-in with the stinkers after you had passed
  out. They did for my spare wardrobe too."</p>

  <p>"It's ruined!" she wailed.</p>

  <p>"Would needle and thread help? They left that, at least, because it was in
  the table drawer."</p>

  <p>"Why, I couldn't make a good swimming suit out of this!" she retorted.
  "Let me try one of yours."</p>

  <p>By dint of cutting, patching, and mending, she at last managed to piece
  one of Grant's suits to respectable proportions. She looked very lovely in
  shirt and trousers, but he was troubled to note that a sudden pallor had
  overtaken her.</p>

  <p>It was the <i>riblancha</i>, the second spell of fever that usually
  followed a severe or prolonged attack. His face was serious as he cupped two
  of his last four ferverin tablets in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Take these," he ordered. "And we've got to get some ferva leaves
  somewhere. The plane took my supply away last week, and I've had bad luck
  with my loonies ever since. They haven't brought me anything but weeds and
  rubbish."</p>

  <p>Lee puckered her lips at the bitterness of the drug, then closed her eyes
  against its momentary dizziness and nausea. "Where can you find ferva?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head perplexedly, glancing out at the setting mass of
  Jupiter, with its bands glowing creamy and brown, and the Red Spot boiling
  near the western edge. Close above it was the brilliant little disk of
  Europa. He frowned suddenly, glanced at his watch and then at the almanac on
  the inside of the cabinet door.</p>

  <p>"It'll be Europa light in fifteen minutes," he muttered, "and true night
  in twenty-five&mdash;the first true night in half a month. I
  wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He gazed thoughtfully at Lee's face. He knew where ferva grew. One dared
  not penetrate the jungle itself, where stinging palms and arrow vines and the
  deadly worms called toothers made such a venture sheer suicide for any
  creatures but loonies and slinkers. But he knew where ferva grew&mdash;</p>

  <p>In Io's rare true night even the clearing might be dangerous. Not merely
  from slinkers, either; he knew well enough that in the darkness creatures
  crept out of the jungle who otherwise remained in the eternal shadows of its
  depths&mdash;toothers, bullet-head frogs, and doubtless many unknown slimy,
  venomous, mysterious beings never seen by man. One heard stories in Herapolis
  and&mdash;</p>

  <p>But he had to get ferva, and he knew where it grew. Not even a loony would
  try to gather it there, but in the little gardens or farms around the tiny
  slinker towns, there was ferva growing.</p>

  <p>He switched on a light in the gathering dusk. "I'm going outside a
  moment," he told Lee Neilan. "If the <i>blancha</i> starts coming back, take
  the other two tablets. Wouldn't hurt you to take 'em anyway. The slinkers got
  away with my thermometer, but if you get dizzy again, you take 'em."</p>

  <p>"Grant! Where&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll be back," he called, closing the door behind him.</p>

  <p>A loony, purple in the bluish Europa light, bobbed up with a long giggle.
  He waved the creature aside and set off on a cautious approach to the
  neighborhood of the slinker village&mdash;the old one, for the other could
  hardly have had time to cultivate its surrounding ground. He crept warily
  through the bleeding-grass, but he knew his stealth was pure optimism. He was
  in exactly the position of a hundred-foot giant trying to approach a human
  city in secrecy&mdash;a difficult matter even in the utter darkness of
  night.</p>

  <p>He reached the edge of the slinker clearing. Behind him, Europa, moving as
  fast as the second hand on his watch, plummeted toward the horizon. He paused
  in momentary surprise at the sight of the exquisite little town, a hundred
  feet away across the tiny square fields, with lights flickering in its
  hand-wide windows. He had not known that slinker culture included the use of
  lights, but there they were, tiny candles or perhaps diminutive oil
  lamps.</p>

  <p>He blinked in the darkness. The second of the ten-foot fields looked
  like&mdash;it was&mdash;ferva. He stooped low, crept out, and reached his
  hand for the fleshy, white leaves. And at that moment came a shrill giggle
  and the crackle of grass behind him. The loony! The idiotic purple loony!</p>

  <p>Squeaking shrieks sounded. He snatched a double handful of ferva, rose,
  and dashed toward the lighted window of his shack. He had no wish to face
  poisoned barbs or disease-bearing teeth, and the slinkers were certainly
  aroused. Their gibbering sounded in chorus; the ground looked black with
  them.</p>

  <p>He reached the shack, burst in, slammed and latched the door. "Got it!" he
  grinned. "Let 'em rave outside now."</p>

  <p>They were raving. Their gibberish sounded like the creaking of worn
  machinery. Even Oliver opened his drowsy eyes to listen. "It must be the
  fever," observed the parcat placidly.</p>

  <p>Lee was certainly no paler; the <i>riblancha</i> was passing safely.
  "Ugh!" she said, listening to the tumult without. "I've always hated rats,
  but slinkers are worse. All the shrewdness and viciousness of rats plus the
  intelligence of devils."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Grant thoughtfully, "I don't see what they can do. They've
  had it in for me anyway."</p>

  <p>"It sounds as if they're going off," said the girl, listening. "The noise
  is fading."</p>

  <p>Grant peered out of the window. "They're still around. They've just passed
  from swearing to planning, and I wish I knew what. Some day, if this crazy
  little planet ever becomes worth human occupation, there's going to be a
  showdown between humans and slinkers."</p>

  <p>"Well? They're not civilized enough to be really a serious obstacle, and
  they're so small, besides."</p>

  <p>"But they learn," he said. "They learn so quickly, and they breed like
  flies. Suppose they pick up the use of gas, or suppose they develop little
  rifles for their poisonous darts. That's possible, because they work in
  metals right now, and they know fire. That would put them practically on a
  par with man as far as offense goes, for what good are our giant cannons and
  rocket planes against six-inch slinkers? And to be just on even terms would
  be fatal; one slinker for one man would be a hell of a trade."</p>

  <p>Lee yawned. "Well, it's not our problem. I'm hungry, Grant."</p>

  <p>"Good. That's a sign the <i>blancha's</i> through with you. We'll eat and
  then sleep a while, for there's five hours of darkness."</p>

  <p>"But the slinkers?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see what they can do. They couldn't cut through stone-bark walls
  in five hours, and anyway, Oliver would warn us if one managed to slip in
  somewhere."</p>

  <div>
    <br>
  </div>

  <p>It was light when Grant awoke, and he stretched his cramped limbs
  painfully across his two chairs. Something had wakened him, but he didn't
  know just what. Oliver was pacing nervously beside him, and now looked
  anxiously up at him.</p>

  <p>"I've had bad luck with my loonies," announced the parcat plaintively.
  "You're a nice kitty."</p>

  <p>"So are you," said Grant. Something had wakened him, but what?</p>

  <p>Then he knew, for it came again&mdash;the merest trembling of the stone-
  bark floor. He frowned in puzzlement. Earthquakes? Not on Io, for the tiny
  sphere had lost its internal heat untold ages ago. Then what?</p>

  <p>Comprehension dawned suddenly. He sprang to his feet with so wild a yell
  that Oliver scrambled sideways with an infernal babble. The startled parcat
  leaped to the stove and vanished up the flue. His squall drifted faintly
  back.</p>

  <p>"It must be the fever!"</p>

  <p>Lee had started to a sitting position on the bunk, her gray eyes blinking
  sleepily.</p>

  <p>"Outside!" he roared, pulling her to her feet. "Get out! Quickly!"</p>

  <p>"Wh-what&mdash;why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get out!" He thrust her through the door, then spun to seize his belt and
  weapons, the bag of ferva leaves, a package of chocolate. The floor trembled
  again, and he burst out of the door with a frantic leap to the side of the
  dazed girl.</p>

  <p>"They've undermined it!" he choked. "The devils undermined the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He had no time to say more. A corner of the shack suddenly subsided; the
  stone-bark logs grated, and the whole structure collapsed like a child's
  house of blocks. The crash died into silence, and there was no motion save a
  lazy wisp of vapor, a few black, ratlike forms scurrying toward the grass,
  and a purple loony bobbing beyond the ruins.</p>

  <p>"The dirty devils!" he swore bitterly. "The damn little black rats!
  The&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A dart whistled so close that it grazed his ear and then twitched a lock
  of Lee's tousled brown hair. A chorus of squeaking sounded in the bleeding-
  grass.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" he cried. "They're out to exterminate us this time.
  No&mdash;this way. Toward the hills. There's less jungle this way."</p>

  <p>They could outrun the tiny slinkers easily enough. In a few moments they
  had lost the sound of squeaking voices, and they stopped to gaze ruefully
  back on the fallen dwelling.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said miserably, "we're both where you were to start with."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no." Lee looked up at him. "We're together now, Grant. I'm not
  afraid."</p>

  <p>"We'll manage," he said with a show of assurance. "Well put up a temporary
  shack somehow. We'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A dart struck his boot with a sharp <i>blup</i>. The slinkers had caught
  up to them.</p>

  <p>Again they ran toward Idiots' Hills. When at last they stopped, they could
  look down a long slope and far over the Ionian jungles. There was the ruined
  shack, and there, neatly checkered, the fields and towers of the nearer
  slinker town. But they had scarcely caught their breath when gibbering and
  squeaking came out of the brush.</p>

  <p>They were being driven into Idiots' Hills, a region as unknown to man as
  the icy wastes of Pluto. It was as if the tiny fiends behind them had
  determined that this time their enemy, the giant trampler and despoiler of
  their fields, should be pursued to extinction.</p>

  <p>Weapons were useless. Grant could not even glimpse their pursuers,
  slipping like hooded rats through the vegetation. A bullet, even if chance
  sped it through a slinker's body, was futile, and his flame pistol, though
  its lightning stroke should incinerate tons of brush and bleeding-grass,
  could no more than cut a narrow path through the horde of tormentors. The
  only weapons that might have availed, the gas bulbs, were lost in the ruins
  of the shack.</p>

  <p>Grant and Lee were forced upward. They had risen a thousand feet above the
  plain, and the air was thinning. There was no jungle here, but only great
  stretches of bleeding-grass, across which a few loonies were visible, bobbing
  their heads on their long necks.</p>

  <p>"Toward&mdash;the peaks!" gasped Grant, now painfully short of breath.
  "Perhaps we can stand rarer air than they."</p>

  <p>Lee was beyond answer. She panted doggedly along beside him as they
  plodded now over patches of bare rock. Before them were two low peaks, like
  the pillars of a gate. Glancing back, Grant caught a glimpse of tiny black
  forms on a clear area, and in sheer anger he fired a shot. A single slinker
  leaped convulsively, its cape flapping, but the rest flowed on. There must
  have been thousands of them.</p>

  <p>The peaks were closer, no more than a few hundred yards away. They were
  sheer, smooth, unscalable.</p>

  <p>"Between them," muttered Grant.</p>

  <p>The passage that separated them was bare and narrow. The twin peaks had
  been one in ages past; some forgotten volcanic convulsion had split them,
  leaving this slender canyon between.</p>

  <p>He slipped an arm about Lee, whose breath, from effort and altitude, was a
  series of rasping gasps. A bright dart tinkled on the rocks as they reached
  the opening, but looking back, Grant could see only a purple loony plodding
  upward, and a few more to his right. They raced down a straight fifty-foot
  passage that debouched suddenly into a sizable valley&mdash;and there,
  thunderstruck for a moment, they paused.</p>

  <p>A city lay there. For a brief instant Grant thought they had burst upon a
  vast slinker metropolis, but the merest glance showed otherwise. This was no
  city of medieval blocks, but a poem in marble, classical in beauty, and of
  human or near-human proportions. White columns, glorious arches, pure curving
  domes, an architectural loveliness that might have been born on the
  Acropolis. It took a second look to discern that the city was dead, deserted,
  in ruins.</p>

  <p>Even in her exhaustion, Lee felt its beauty. "How&mdash;how exquisite!"
  she panted. "One could almost forgive them&mdash;for
  being&mdash;slinkers!"</p>

  <p>"They won't forgive us for being human," he muttered. "We'll have to make
  a stand somewhere. We'd better pick a building."</p>

  <p>But before they could move more than a few feet from the canyon mouth, a
  wild disturbance halted them. Grant whirled, and for a moment found himself
  actually paralyzed by amazement. The narrow canyon was filled with a
  gibbering horde of slinkers, like a nauseous, heaving black carpet. But they
  came no further than the valley end, for grinning, giggling, and bobbing,
  blocking the opening with tramping three-toed feet, were four loonies!</p>

  <p>It was a battle. The slinkers were biting and stabbing at the miserable
  defenders, whose shrill keenings of pain were less giggles than shrieks. But
  with a determination and purpose utterly foreign to loonies, their clawed
  feet tramped methodically up and down, up and down.</p>

  <p>Grant exploded, "I'll be damned!" Then an idea struck him. "Lee! They're
  packed in the canyon, the whole devil's brood of 'em!"</p>

  <p>He rushed toward the opening. He thrust his flame pistol between the
  skinny legs of a loony, aimed it straight along the canyon, and fired.</p>

  <p>Inferno burst. The tiny diamond, giving up all its energy in one terrific
  blast, shot a jagged stream of fire that filled the canyon from wall to wall
  and vomited out beyond to cut a fan of fire through the bleeding-grass of the
  slope.</p>

  <p>Idiots' Hills reverberated to the roar, and when the rain of debris
  settled, there was nothing in the canyon save a few bits of flesh and the
  head of an unfortunate loony, still bouncing and rolling.</p>

  <p>Three of the loonies survived. A purple-faced one was pulling his arm,
  grinning and giggling in imbecile glee. He waved the thing aside and returned
  to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness!" he said. "We're out of that, anyway."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't afraid, Grant. Not with you."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "Perhaps we can find a place here," he suggested. "The fever
  ought to be less troublesome at this altitude. But&mdash;say, this must have
  been the capital city of the whole slinker race in ancient times. I can
  scarcely imagine those fiends creating an architecture as beautiful as
  this&mdash;or as large. Why, these buildings are as colossal in proportion to
  slinker size as the skyscrapers of New York to us!"</p>

  <p>"But so beautiful," said Lee softly, sweeping her eyes over the glory of
  the ruins. "One might almost forgive&mdash;Grant! Look at those!"</p>

  <p>He followed the gesture. On the inner side of the canyon's portals were
  gigantic carvings. But the thing that set him staring in amazement was the
  subject of the portrayal. There, towering far up the cliff sides, were the
  figures, not of slinkers, but of&mdash;loonies! Exquisitely carved, smiling
  rather than grinning, and smiling somehow sadly, regretfully,
  pityingly&mdash;yet beyond doubt, loonies!</p>

  <p>"Good night!" he whispered. "Do you see, Lee? This must once have been a
  loony city. The steps, the doors, the buildings, all are on their scale of
  size. Somehow, some time, they must have achieved civilization, and the
  loonies we know are the degenerate residue of a great race."</p>

  <p>"And," put in Lee, "the reason those four blocked the way when the
  slinkers tried to come through is that they still remember. Or probably they
  don't actually remember, but they have a tradition of past glories, or more
  likely still, just a superstitious feeling that this place is in some way
  sacred. They let us pass because, after all, we look more like loonies than
  like slinkers. But the amazing thing is that they still possess even that dim
  memory, because this city must have been in ruins for centuries. Or perhaps
  even for thousands of years."</p>

  <p>"But to think that loonies could ever have had the intelligence to create
  a culture of their own," said Grant, waving away the purple one bobbing and
  giggling at his side. Suddenly he paused, turning a gaze of new respect on
  the creature. "This one's been following me for days. All right, old chap,
  what is it?"</p>

  <p>The purple one extended a sorely bedraggled bundle of bleeding-grass and
  twigs, giggling idiotically. His ridiculous mouth twisted; his eyes popped in
  an agony of effort at mental concentration.</p>

  <p>"Canny!" he giggled triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"The imbecile!" flared Grant. "Nitwit! Idiot!" He broke off, then laughed.
  "Never mind. I guess you deserve it." He tossed his package of chocolate to
  the three delighted loonies. "Here's your candy."</p>

  <p>A scream from Lee startled him. She was waving her arms wildly, and over
  the crest of Idiots' Hills a rocket plane roared, circled, and nosed its way
  into the valley.</p>

  <p>The door opened. Oliver stalked gravely out, remarking casually. "I'm real
  and you're real." A man followed the parcat&mdash;two men.</p>

  <p>"Father!" screamed Lee.</p>

  <div>
    <br>
  </div>

  <p>It was some time later that Gustavus Neilan turned to Grant. "I can't
  thank you," he said. "If there's ever any way I can show my appreciation
  for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is. You can cancel my contract."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you work for me?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Grant Calthorpe, one of your traders, and I'm about sick of this
  crazy planet."</p>

  <p>"Of course, if you wish," said Neilan. "If it's a question of
  pay&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can pay me for the six months I've worked."</p>

  <p>"If you'd care to stay," said the older man, "there won't be trading much
  longer. We've been able to grow ferva near the polar cities, and I prefer
  plantations to the uncertainties of relying on loonies. If you'd work out
  your year, we might be able to put you in charge of a plantation by the end
  of that time."</p>

  <p>Grant met Lee Neilan's gray eyes, and hesitated. "Thanks," he said slowly,
  "but I'm sick of it." He smiled at the girl, then turned back to her father.
  "Would you mind telling me how you happened to find us? This is the most
  unlikely place on the planet."</p>

  <p>"That's just the reason," said Neilan. "When Lee didn't get back, I
  thought things over pretty carefully. At last I decided, knowing her as I
  did, to search the least likely places first. We tried the shores of the
  Fever Sea, and then the White Desert, and finally Idiots' Hills. We spotted
  the ruins of a shack, and on the debris was this chap"&mdash;he indicated
  Oliver&mdash;"remarking that Ten loonies make one half-wit.' Well, the
  half-wit part sounded very much like a reference to my daughter, and we
  cruised about until the roar of your flame pistol attracted our
  attention."</p>

  <p>Lee pouted, then turned her serious gray eyes on Grant. "Do you remember,"
  she said softly, "what I told you there in the jungle?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't even have mentioned that," he replied. "I knew you were
  delirious."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;perhaps I wasn't. Would companionship make it any easier to
  work out your year? I mean if&mdash;for instance&mdash;you were to fly back
  with us to Junopolis and return with a wife?"</p>

  <p>"Lee," he said huskily, "you know what a difference that would make,
  though I can't understand why you'd ever dream of it."</p>

  <p>"It must," suggested Oliver, "be the fever."</p>
