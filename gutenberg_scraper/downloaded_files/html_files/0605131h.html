<h1>The Mysterious Mansion</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Honor&eacute; De Balzac</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>About a hundred yards from the town of Vend&ocirc;me, on the
borders of the Loire, there is an old gray house, surmounted by very
high gables, and so completely isolated that neither tanyard nor
shabby hostelry, such as you may find at the entrance to all small
towns, exists in its immediate neighborhood.</p>

<p>In front of this building, overlooking the river, is a garden,
where the once well-trimmed box borders that used to define the walks
now grow wild as they list. Several willows that spring from the
Loire have grown as rapidly as the hedge that encloses it, and half
conceal the house. The rich vegetation of those weeds that we call
foul adorns the sloping shore. Fruit trees, neglected for the last
ten years, no longer yield their harvest, and their shoots form
coppices. The wall-fruit grows like hedges against the walls. Paths
once graveled are overgrown with moss, but, to tell the truth, there
is no trace of a path. From the height of the hill, to which cling
the ruins of the old castle of the Dukes of Vend&ocirc;me, the only
spot whence the eye can plunge into this enclosure, it strikes you
that, at a time not easy to determine, this plot of land was the
delight of a country gentleman, who cultivated roses and tulips and
horticulture in general, and who was besides a lover of fine fruit.
An arbor is still visible, or rather the d&eacute;bris of an arbor,
where there is a table that time has not quite destroyed. The aspect
of this garden of bygone days suggests the negative joys of peaceful,
provincial life, as one might reconstruct the life of a worthy
tradesman by reading the epitaph on his tombstone. As if to complete
the sweetness and sadness of the ideas that possess one's soul, one
of the walls displays a sun-dial decorated with the following
commonplace Christian inscription: "Ultimam cogita!" The roof of this
house is horribly dilapidated, the shutters are always closed, the
balconies are covered with swallows' nests, the doors are perpetually
shut, weeds have drawn green lines in the cracks of the flights of
steps, the locks and bolts are rusty. Sun, moon, winter, summer, and
snow have worn the paneling, warped the boards, gnawed the paint. The
lugubrious silence which reigns there is only broken by birds, cats,
martins, rats and mice, free to course to and fro, to fight and to
eat each other. Everywhere an invisible hand has graven the word
mystery.</p>

<p>Should your curiosity lead you to glance at this house from the
side that points to the road, you would perceive a great door which
the children of the place have riddled with holes. I afterward heard
that this door had been closed for the last ten years. Through the
holes broken by the boys you would have observed the perfect harmony
that existed between the fa&ccedil;ades of both garden and courtyard.
In both the same disorder prevails. Tufts of weed encircle the
paving-stones. Enormous cracks furrow the walls, round whose
blackened crests twine the thousand garlands of the pellitory. The
steps are out of joint, the wire of the bell is rusted, the spouts
are cracked. What fire from heaven has fallen here? What tribunal has
decreed that salt should be strewn on this dwelling? Has God been
blasphemed, has France been here betrayed? These are the questions we
ask ourselves, but get no answer from the crawling things that haunt
the place. The empty and deserted house is a gigantic enigma, of
which the key is lost. In bygone times it was a small fief, and bears
the name of the Grande Bret&ecirc;che.</p>

<p>I inferred that I was not the only person to whom my good landlady
had communicated the secret of which I was to be the sole recipient,
and I prepared to listen.</p>

<p>"Sir," she said, "when the Emperor sent the Spanish prisoners of
war and others here, the Government quartered on me a young Spaniard
who had been sent to Vend&ocirc;me on parole. Parole notwithstanding
he went out every day to show himself to the sous-pr&eacute;fet. He
was a Spanish grandee! Nothing less! His name ended in os and dia,
something like Burgos de F&eacute;r&eacute;dia. I have his name on my
books; you can read it if you like. Oh! but he was a handsome young
man for a Spaniard; they are all said to be ugly. He was only five
feet and a few inches high, but he was well-grown; he had small hands
that he took such care of; ah! you should have seen! He had as many
brushes for his hands as a woman for her whole dressing apparatus! He
had thick black hair, a fiery eye, his skin was rather bronzed, but I
liked the look of it. He wore the finest linen I have ever seen on
any one, although I have had princesses staying here, and, among
others, General Bertrand, the Duke and Duchess d'Abrant&eacute;s,
Monsieur Decazes, and the King of Spain. He didn't eat much; but his
manners were so polite, so amiable, that one could not owe him a
grudge. Oh! I was very fond of him, although he didn't open his lips
four times in the day, and it was impossible to keep up a
conversation with him. For if you spoke to him, he did not answer. It
was a fad, a mania with them all, I heard say. He read his breviary
like a priest, he went to Mass and to all the services regularly.
Where did he sit? Two steps from the chapel of Madame de Merret. As
he took his place there the first time he went to church, nobody
suspected him of any intention in so doing. Besides, he never raised
his eyes from his prayer-book, poor young man!</p>

<p>After that, sir, in the evening he would walk on the mountains,
among the castle ruins. It was the poor man's only amusement, it
reminded him of his country. They say that Spain is all mountains!
From the commencement of his imprisonment he stayed out late. I was
anxious when I found that he did not come home before midnight; but
we got accustomed to this fancy of his. He took the key of the door,
and we left off sitting up for him. He lodged in a house of ours in
the Rue des Casernes. After that, one of our stable-men told us that
in the evening when he led the horses to the water, he thought he had
seen the Spanish grandee swimming far down the river like a live
fish. When he returned, I told him to take care of the rushes; he
appeared vexed to have been seen in the water. At last, one day, or
rather one morning, we did not find him in his room; he had not
returned. After searching everywhere, I found some writing in the
drawer of a table, where there were fifty gold pieces of Spain that
are called doubloons and were worth about five thousand francs; and
ten thousand francs' worth of diamonds in a small sealed box. The
writing said, that in case he did not return, he left us the money
and the diamonds, on condition of paying for Masses to thank God for
his escape, and for his salvation. In those days my husband had not
been taken from me; he hastened to seek him everywhere.</p>

<p>"And now for the strange part of the story. He brought home the
Spaniard's clothes, that he had discovered under a big stone, in a
sort of pilework by the river-side near the castle, nearly opposite
to the Grande Bret&ecirc;che. My husband had gone there so early that
no one had seen him. After reading the letter, he burned the clothes,
and according to Count F&eacute;d&eacute;ria's desire we declared
that he had escaped. The sous-pr&eacute;fet sent all the gendarmerie
in pursuit of him; but brust! they never caught him. Lepas believed
that the Spaniard had drowned himself. I, sir, don't think so; I am
more inclined to believe that he had something to do with the affair
of Madame de Merret, seeing that Rosalie told me that the crucifix,
that her mistress thought so much of, that she had it buried with
her, was of ebony and silver. Now in the beginning of his stay here,
Monsieur de F&eacute;d&eacute;ria had one in ebony and silver, that I
never saw him with later. Now, sir, don't you consider that I need
have no scruples about the Spaniard's fifteen thousand francs, and
that I have a right to them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; but you haven't tried to question Rosalie?" I
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed, sir; but to no purpose! the girl's like a wall.
She knows something, but it is impossible to get her to talk."</p>

<p>After exchanging a few more words with me, my landlady left me a
prey to vague and gloomy thoughts, to a romantic curiosity, and a
religious terror not unlike the profound impression produced on us
when by night, on entering a dark church, we perceive a faint light
under high arches; a vague figure glides by--the rustle of a robe or
cassock is heard, and we shudder.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Grande Bret&ecirc;che and its tall weeds, its barred
windows, its rusty ironwork, its closed doors, its deserted
apartments, appeared like a fantastic apparition before me. I essayed
to penetrate the mysterious dwelling, and to find the knot of its
dark story--the drama that had killed three persons. In my eyes
Rosalie became the most interesting person in Vend&ocirc;me. As I
studied her, I discovered the traces of secret care, despite the
radiant health that shone in her plump countenance. There was in her
the germ of remorse or hope; her attitude revealed a secret, like the
attitude of a bigot who prays to excess, or of the infanticide who
ever hears the last cry of her child. Yet her manners were rough and
ingenuous--her silly smile was not that of a criminal, and could you
but have seen the great kerchief that encompassed her portly bust,
framed and laced in by a lilac and blue cotton gown, you would have
dubbed her innocent. No, I thought, I will not leave Vend&ocirc;me
without learning the history of the Grande Bret&ecirc;che. To gain my
ends I will strike up a friendship with Rosalie, if needs be.
"Rosalie," said I, one evening.</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"You are not married?"</p>

<p>She started slightly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can find plenty of men, when the fancy takes me to be made
miserable," she said, laughing.</p>

<p>She soon recovered from the effects of her emotion, for all women,
from the great lady to the maid of the inn, possess a composure that
is peculiar to them.</p>

<p>"You are too good-looking and well favored to be short of lovers.
But tell me, Rosalie, why did you take service in an inn after
leaving Madame de Merret? Did she leave you nothing to live on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! But, sir, my place is the best in all
Vend&ocirc;me."</p>

<p>The reply was one of those that judges and lawyers would call
evasive. Rosalie appeared to me to be situated in this romantic
history like the square in the midst of a chessboard. She was at the
heart of the truth and chief interest; she seemed to me to be bound
in the very knot of it. The conquest of Rosalie was no longer to be
an ordinary siege--in this girl was centered the last chapter of a
novel, therefore from this moment Rosalie became the object of my
preference.</p>

<p>One morning I said to Rosalie: "Tell me all you know about Madame
de Merret."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she replied in terror, "do not ask that of me, Monsieur
Horace."</p>

<p>Her pretty face fell--her clear, bright color faded--and her eyes
lost their innocent brightness.</p>

<p>"Well, then," she said, at last, "if you must have it so, I will
tell you about it; but promise to keep my secret!"</p>

<p>"Done! my dear girl, I must keep your secret with the honor of a
thief, which is the most loyal in the world."</p>

<p>Were I to transcribe Rosalie's diffuse eloquence faithfully, an
entire volume would scarcely contain it; so I shall abridge.</p>

<p>The room occupied by Madame de Merret at the Bret&ecirc;che was on
the ground floor. A little closet about four feet deep, built in the
thickness of the wall, served as her wardrobe. Three months before
the eventful evening of which I am about to speak, Madame de Merret
had been so seriously indisposed that her husband had left her to
herself in her own apartment, while he occupied another on the first
floor. By one of those chances that it is impossible to foresee, he
returned home from the club (where he was accustomed to read the
papers and discuss politics with the inhabitants of the place) two
hours later than usual. His wife supposed him to be at home, in bed
and asleep. But the invasion of France had been the subject of a most
animated discussion; the billiard-match had been exciting, he had
lost forty francs, an enormous sum for Vend&ocirc;me, where every one
hoards, and where manners are restricted within the limits of a
praiseworthy modesty, which perhaps is the source of the true
happiness that no Parisian covets. For some time past Monsieur de
Merret had been satisfied to ask Rosalie if his wife had gone to bed;
and on her reply, which was always in the affirmative, had
immediately gained his own room with the good temper engendered by
habit and confidence. On entering his house, he took it into his head
to go and tell his wife of his misadventure, perhaps by way of
consolation. At dinner he found Madame de Merret most coquettishly
attired. On his way to the club it had occurred to him that his wife
was restored to health, and that her convalescence had added to her
beauty. He was, as husbands are wont to be, somewhat slow in making
this discovery. Instead of calling Rosalie, who was occupied just
then in watching the cook and coachman play a difficult hand at
brisque, Monsieur de Merret went to his wife's room by the light of a
lantern that he deposited on the first step of the staircase. His
unmistakable step resounded under the vaulted corridor. At the moment
that the Count turned the handle of his wife's door, he fancied he
could hear the door of the closet I spoke of close; but when he
entered Madame de Merret was alone before the fireplace. The husband
thought ingenuously that Rosalie was in the closet, yet a suspicion
that jangled in his ear put him on his guard. He looked at his wife
and saw in her eyes I know not what wild and hunted expression.</p>

<p>"You are very late," she said. Her habitually pure, sweet voice
seemed changed to him. Monsieur de Merret did not reply, for at that
moment Rosalie entered. It was a thunderbolt for him. He strode about
the room, passing from one window to the other, with mechanical
motion and folded arms.</p>

<p>"Have you heard bad news, or are you unwell?" inquired his wife
timidly, while Rosalie undressed her.</p>

<p>He kept silent.</p>

<p>"You can leave me," said Madame de Merret to her maid; "I will put
my hair in curl papers myself."</p>

<p>From the expression of her husband's face she foresaw trouble, and
wished to be alone with him. When Rosalie had gone, or was supposed
to have gone (for she stayed in the corridor for a few minutes),
Monsieur de Merret came and stood in front of his wife, and said
coldly to her:</p>

<p>"Madame, there is someone in your closet!" She looked calmly at
her husband and replied simply:</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>This answer was heartrending to Monsieur de Merret; he did not
believe in it. Yet his wife had never appeared to him purer or more
saintly than at that moment. He rose to open the closet door; Madame
de Merret took his hand, looked at him with an expression of
melancholy, and said in a voice that betrayed singular emotion:</p>

<p>"If you find no one there, remember this, all will be over between
us!" The extraordinary dignity of his wife's manner restored the
Count's profound esteem for her, and inspired him with one of those
resolutions that only lack a vaster stage to become immortal.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "Josephine, I will not go there. In either case it
would separate us forever. Hear me, I know how pure you are at heart,
and that your life is a holy one. You would not commit a mortal sin
to save your life."</p>

<p>At these words Madame de Merret turned a haggard gaze upon her
husband.</p>

<p>"Here, take your crucifix," he added. "Swear to me before God that
there is no one in there; I will believe you, I will never open that
door."</p>

<p>Madame de Merret took the crucifix and said:</p>

<p>"I swear."</p>

<p>"Louder," said the husband, "and repeat 'I swear before God that
there is no one in that closet'."</p>

<p>She repeated the sentence calmly.</p>

<p>"That will do," said Monsieur de Merret, coldly.</p>

<p>After a moment of silence:</p>

<p>"I never saw this pretty toy before," he said, examining the ebony
crucifix inlaid with silver, and most artistically chiseled.</p>

<p>"I found it at Duvivier's, who bought it of a Spanish monk when
the prisoners passed through Vend&ocirc;me last year."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Monsieur de Merret, as he replaced the crucifix on the
nail, and he rang. Rosalie did not keep him waiting. Monsieur de
Merret went quickly to meet her, led her to the bay window that
opened on to the garden and whispered to her:</p>

<p>"Listen! I know that Gorenflot wishes to marry you, poverty is the
only drawback, and you told him that you would be his wife if he
found the means to establish himself as a master mason. Well! go and
fetch him, tell him to come here with his trowel and tools. Manage
not to awaken any one in his house but himself; his fortune will be
more than your desires. Above all, leave this room without babbling,
otherwise--" He frowned. Rosalie went away, he recalled her.</p>

<p>"Here, take my latchkey," he said. "Jean!" then cried Monsieur de
Merret, in tones of thunder in the corridor. Jean, who was at the
same time his coachman and his confidential servant, left his game of
cards and came.</p>

<p>"Go to bed, all of you," said his master, signing to him to
approach; and the Count added, under his breath: "When they are all
asleep--asleep, d'ye hear?--you will come down and tell me." Monsieur
de Merret, who had not lost sight of his wife all the time he was
giving his orders, returned quietly to her at the fireside and began
to tell her of the game of billiards and the talk of the club. When
Rosalie returned she found Monsieur and Madame de Merret conversing
very amicably.</p>

<p>The Count had lately had all the ceilings of his reception rooms
on the ground floor repaired. Plaster of Paris is difficult to obtain
in Vend&ocirc;me; the carriage raises its price. The Count had
therefore bought a good deal, being well aware that he could find
plenty of purchasers for whatever might remain over. This
circumstance inspired him with the design he was about to
execute.</p>

<p>"Sir, Gorenflot has arrived," said Rosalie in low tones.</p>

<p>"Show him in," replied the Count in loud tones.</p>

<p>Madame de Merret turned rather pale when she saw the mason.</p>

<p>"Gorenflot," said her husband, "go and fetch bricks from the
coachhouse, and bring sufficient to wall up the door of this closet;
you will use the plaster I have over to coat the wall with." Then
calling Rosalie and the workman aside:</p>

<p>"Listen, Gorenflot," he said in an undertone, "you will sleep here
to-night. But to-morrow you will have a passport to a foreign
country, to a town to which I will direct you. I shall give you six
thousand francs for your journey. You will stay ten years in that
town; if you do not like it, you may establish yourself in another,
provided it be in the same country. You will pass through Paris,
where you will await me. There I will insure you an additional six
thousand francs by contract, which will be paid to you on your
return, provided you have fulfilled the conditions of our bargain.
This is the price for your absolute silence as to what you are about
to do to-night. As to you, Rosalie, I will give you ten thousand
francs on the day of your wedding, on condition of your marrying
Gorenflot; but if you wish to marry, you must hold your tongues;
or--no dowry."</p>

<p>"Rosalie," said Madame de Merret, "do my hair."</p>

<p>The husband walked calmly up and down, watching the door, the
mason, and his wife, but without betraying any insulting doubts.
Madame de Merret chose a moment when the workman was unloading bricks
and her husband was at the other end of the room to say to Rosalie:
"A thousand francs a year for you, my child, if you can tell
Gorenflot to leave a chink at the bottom." Then out loud, she added
coolly:</p>

<p>"Go and help him!"</p>

<p>Monsieur and Madame de Merret were silent all the time that
Gorenflot took to brick up the door. This silence, on the part of the
husband, who did not choose to furnish his wife with a pretext for
saying things of a double meaning, had its purpose; on the part of
Madame de Merret it was either pride or prudence. When the wall was
about half-way up, the sly workman took advantage of a moment when
the Count's back was turned, to strike a blow with his trowel in one
of the glass panes of the closet-door. This act informed Madame de
Merret that Rosalie had spoken to Gorenflot.</p>

<p>All three then saw a man's face; it was dark and gloomy with black
hair and eyes of flame. Before her husband turned, the poor woman had
time to make a sign to the stranger that signified: Hope!</p>

<p>At four o'clock, toward dawn, for it was the month of September,
the construction was finished. The mason was handed over to the care
of Jean, and Monsieur de Merret went to bed in his wife's room.</p>

<p>On rising the following morning, he said carelessly:</p>

<p>"The deuce! I must go to the Mairie for the passport." He put his
hat on his head, advanced three steps toward the door, altered his
mind and took the crucifix.</p>

<p>His wife trembled for joy. "He is going to Duvivier," she thought.
As soon as the Count had left, Madame de Merret rang for Rosalie;
then in a terrible voice:</p>

<p>"The trowel, the trowel!" she cried, "and quick to work! I saw how
Gorenflot did it; we shall have time to make a hole and to mend it
again."</p>

<p>In the twinkling of an eye, Rosalie brought a sort of mattock to
her mistress, who with unparalleled ardor set about demolishing the
wall. She had already knocked out several bricks and was preparing to
strike a more decisive blow when she perceived Monsieur de Merret
behind her. She fainted.</p>

<p>"Lay Madame on her bed," said the Count coldly. He had foreseen
what would happen in his absence and had set a trap for his wife; he
had simply written to the mayor, and had sent for Duvivier. The
jeweller arrived just as the room had been put in order.</p>

<p>"Duvivier," inquired the Count, "did you buy crucifixes of the
Spaniards who passed through here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"That will do, thank you," he said, looking at his wife like a
tiger. "Jean," he added, "you will see that my meals are served in
the Countess's room; she is ill, and I shall not leave her until she
has recovered."</p>

<p>The cruel gentleman stayed with his wife for twenty days. In the
beginning, when there were sounds in the walled closet, and Josephine
attempted to implore his pity for the dying stranger, he replied,
without permitting her to say a word:</p>

<p>"You have sworn on the cross that there is no one there."</p>
