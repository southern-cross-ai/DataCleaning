<h1>A Dead Finger</h1>

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<p>Why the National Gallery should not attract so many visitors as,
say, the British Museum, I cannot explain. The latter does not
contain much that, one would suppose, appeals to the interest of the
ordinary sightseer. What knows such of prehistoric flints and
scratched bones? Of Assyrian sculpture? Of Egyptian hieroglyphics?
The Greek and Roman statuary is cold and dead.</p>

<p>The paintings in the National Gallery glow with colour, and are
instinct with life. Yet, somehow, a few listless wanderers saunter
yawning through the National Gallery, whereas swarms pour through the
halls of the British Museum, and talk and pass remarks about the
objects there exposed, of the date and meaning of which they have not
the faintest conception.</p>

<p>I was thinking of this problem, and endeavouring to unravel it,
one morning whilst sitting in the room for English masters at the
great collection in Trafalgar Square. At the same time another
thought forced itself upon me. I had been through the rooms devoted
to foreign schools, and had then come into that given over to
Reynolds, Morland, Gainsborough, Constable, and Hogarth. The morning
had been for a while propitious, but towards noon a dense
umber-tinted fog had come on, making it all but impossible to see the
pictures, and quite impossible to do them justice. I was tired, and
so seated myself on one of the chairs, and fell into the
consideration first of all of--why the National Gallery is not as
popular as it should be; and secondly, how it was that the British
School had no beginnings, like those of Italy and the Netherlands. We
can see the art of the painter from its first initiation in the
Italian peninsula, and among the Flemings.</p>

<p>It starts on its progress like a child, and we can trace every
stage of its growth. Not so with English art. It springs to life in
full and splendid maturity. Who were there before Reynolds and
Gainsborough and Hogarth? The great names of those portrait and
subject painters who have left their canvases upon the walls of our
country houses were those of foreigners--Holbein, Kneller, Van Dyck,
and Lely for portraits, and Monnoyer for flower and fruit pieces.
Landscapes, figure subjects were all importations, none home-grown.
How came that about? Was there no limner that was native? Was it that
fashion trampled on homegrown pictorial beginnings as it flouted and
spurned native music?</p>

<p>Here was food for contemplation. Dreaming in the brown fog,
looking through it without seeing its beauties, at Hogarth's painting
of Lavinia Fenton as Polly Peachum, without wondering how so
indifferent a beauty could have captivated the Duke of Bolton and
held him for thirty years, I was recalled to myself and my
surroundings by the strange conduct of a lady who had seated herself
on a chair near me, also discouraged by the fog, and awaiting its
dispersion.</p>

<p>I had not noticed her particularly. At the present moment I do not
remember particularly what she was like. So far as I can recollect
she was middle-aged, and was quietly yet well dressed. It was not her
face nor her dress that attracted my attention and disturbed the
current of my thoughts; the effect I speak of was produced by her
strange movements and behaviour.</p>

<p>She had been sitting listless, probably thinking of nothing at
all, or nothing in particular, when, in turning her eyes round, and
finding that she could see nothing of the paintings, she began to
study me. This did concern me greatly. A cat may look at the king;
but to be contemplated by a lady is a compliment sufficient to please
any gentleman. It was not gratified vanity that troubled my thoughts,
but the consciousness that my appearance produced--first of all a
startled surprise, then undisguised alarm, and, finally,
indescribable horror.</p>

<p>Now a man can sit quietly leaning on the head of his umbrella, and
glow internally, warmed and illumined by the consciousness that he is
being surveyed with admiration by a lovely woman, even when he is
middle-aged and not fashionably dressed; but no man can maintain his
composure when he discovers himself to be an object of aversion and
terror.</p>

<p>What was it? I passed my hand over my chin and upper lip, thinking
it not impossible that I might have forgotten to shave that morning,
and in my confusion not considering that the fog would prevent the
lady from discovering neglect in this particular, had it occurred,
which it had not. I am a little careless, perhaps, about shaving when
in the country; but when in town, never.</p>

<p>The next idea that occurred to me was--a smut. Had a London black,
curdled in that dense pea-soup atmosphere, descended on my nose and
blackened it? I hastily drew my silk handkerchief from my pocket,
moistened it, and passed to my nose, and then each cheek. I then
turned my eyes into the corners and looked at the lady, to see
whether by this means I had got rid of what was objectionable in my
personal appearance.</p>

<p>Then I saw that her eyes, dilated with horror, were riveted, not
on my face, but on my leg.</p>

<p>My leg! What on earth could that harmless member have in it so
terrifying? The morning had been dull; there had been rain in the
night, and I admit that on leaving my hotel I had turned up the
bottoms of my trousers. That is a proceeding not so uncommon, not so
outrageous as to account for the stony stare of this woman's
eyes.</p>

<p>If that were all I would turn my trousers down.</p>

<p>Then I saw her shrink from the chair on which she sat to one
further removed from me, but still with her eyes fixed on my
leg--about the level of my knee. She had let fall her umbrella, and
was grasping the seat of her chair with both hands, as she backed
from me.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that I was greatly disturbed in mind and
feelings, and forgot all about the origin of the English schools of
painters, and the question why the British Museum is more popular
than the National Gallery.</p>

<p>Thinking that I might have been spattered by a hansom whilst
crossing Oxford Street, I passed my hand down my side hastily, with a
sense of annoyance, and all at once touched something, cold, clammy,
that sent a thrill to my heart, and made me start and take a step
forward. At the same moment, the lady, with a cry of horror, sprang
to her feet, and with raised hands fled from the room, leaving her
umbrella where it had fallen.</p>

<p>There were other visitors to the Picture Gallery besides
ourselves, who had been passing through the saloon, and they turned
at her cry, and looked in surprise after her.</p>

<p>The policeman stationed in the room came to me and asked what had
happened. I was in such agitation that I hardly knew what to answer.
I told him that I could explain what had occurred little better than
himself. I had noticed that the lady had worn an odd expression, and
had behaved in most extraordinary fashion, and that he had best take
charge of her umbrella, and wait for her return to claim it.</p>

<p>This questioning by the official was vexing, as it prevented me
from at once and on the spot investigating the cause of her alarm and
mine--hers at something she must have seen on my leg, and mine at
something I had distinctly felt creeping up my leg.</p>

<p>The numbing and sickening effect on me of the touch of the object
I had not seen was not to be shaken off at once. Indeed, I felt as
though my hand were contaminated, and that I could have no rest till
I had thoroughly washed the hand, and, if possible, washed away the
feeling that had been produced.</p>

<p>I looked on the floor, I examined my leg, but saw nothing. As I
wore my overcoat, it was probable that in rising from my seat the
skirt had fallen over my trousers and hidden the thing, whatever it
was: I therefore hastily removed my overcoat and shook it, then I
looked at my trousers. There was nothing whatever on my leg, and
nothing fell from my overcoat when shaken.</p>

<p>Accordingly I reinvested myself, and hastily left the Gallery;
then took my way as speedily as I could, without actually running, to
Charing Cross Station and down the narrow way leading to the
Metropolitan, where I went into Faulkner's bath and hairdressing
establishment, and asked for hot water to thoroughly wash my hand and
well soap it. I bathed my hand in water as hot as I could endure it,
employed carbolic soap, and then, after having a good brush down,
especially on my left side where my hand had encountered the object
that had so affected me, I left. I had entertained the intention of
going to the Princess's Theatre that evening, and of securing a
ticket in the morning; but all thought of theatre-going was gone from
me. I could not free my heart from the sense of nausea and cold that
had been produced by the touch. I went into Gatti's to have lunch,
and ordered something, I forget what, but, when served, I found that
my appetite was gone. I could eat nothing; the food inspired me with
disgust. I thrust it from me untasted, and, after drinking a couple
of glasses of claret, left the restaurant, and returned to my
hotel.</p>

<p>Feeling sick and faint, I threw my overcoat over the sofa-back,
and cast myself on my bed.</p>

<p>I do not know that there was any particular reason for my doing
so, but as I lay my eyes were on my great-coat.</p>

<p>The density of the fog had passed away, and there was light again,
not of first quality, but sufficient for a Londoner to swear by, so
that I could see everything in my room, though through a veil,
darkly.</p>

<p>I do not think my mind was occupied in any way. About the only
occasions on which, to my knowledge, my mind is actually passive or
inert is when crossing the Channel in The Foam from Dover to Calais,
when I am always, in every weather, abjectly seasick--and
thoughtless. But as I now lay on my bed, uncomfortable, squeamish,
without knowing why--I was in the same inactive mental condition. But
not for long.</p>

<p>I saw something that startled me.</p>

<p>First, it appeared to me as if the lappet of my overcoat pocket
were in movement, being raised.</p>

<p>I did not pay much attention to this, as I supposed that the
garment was sliding down on to the seat of the sofa, from the back,
and that this displacement of gravity caused the movement I observed.
But this I soon saw was not the case. That which moved the lappet was
something in the pocket that was struggling to get out. I could see
now that it was working its way up the inside, and that when it
reached the opening it lost balance and fell down again. I could make
this out by the projections and indentations in the cloth; these
moved as the creature, or whatever it was, worked its way up the
lining.</p>

<p>'A mouse,' I said, and forgot my seediness; I was interested. 'The
little rascal! However did he contrive to seat himself in my pocket?
and I have worn that overcoat all the morning!' But no--it was not a
mouse. I saw something white poke its way out from under the lappet;
and in another moment an object was revealed that, though revealed, I
could not understand, nor could I distinguish what it was.</p>

<p>Now roused by curiosity, I raised myself on my elbow. In doing
this I made some noise, the bed creaked. Instantly the something
dropped on the floor, lay outstretched for a moment, to recover
itself, and then began, with the motions of a maggot, to run along
the floor.</p>

<p>There is a caterpillar called 'The Measurer', because, when it
advances, it draws its tail up to where its head is and then throws
forward its full length, and again draws up its extremity, forming at
each time a loop, and with each step measuring its total length. The
object I now saw on the floor was advancing precisely like the
measuring caterpillar. It had the colour of a cheese-maggot, and in
length was about three and a half inches. It was not, however, like a
caterpillar, which is flexible throughout its entire length, but this
was, as it seemed to me, jointed in two places, one joint being more
conspicuous than the other. For some moments I was so completely
paralysed by astonishment that I remained motionless, looking at the
thing as it crawled along the carpet--a dull green carpet with darker
green, almost black, flowers in it.</p>

<p>It had, as it seemed to me, a glossy head, distinctly marked; but,
as the light was not brilliant, I could not make out very clearly,
and, moreover, the rapid movements prevented close scrutiny.</p>

<p>Presently, with a shock still more startling than that produced by
its apparition at the opening of the pocket of my great-coat, I
became convinced that what I saw was a finger, a human forefinger,
and that the glossy head was no other than the nail.</p>

<p>The finger did not seem to have been amputated. There was no sign
of blood or laceration where the knuckle should be, but the extremity
of the finger, or root rather, faded away to indistinctness, and I
was unable to make out the root of the finger.</p>

<p>I could see no hand, no body behind this finger, nothing whatever
except a finger that had little token of warm life in it, no
coloration as though blood circulated in it; and this finger was in
active motion creeping along the carpet towards a wardrobe that stood
against the wall by the fireplace.</p>

<p>I sprang off the bed and pursued it.</p>

<p>Evidently the finger was alarmed, for it redoubled its pace,
reached the wardrobe, and went under it. By the time I had arrived at
the article of furniture it had disappeared. I lit a vesta match and
held it beneath the wardrobe, that was raised above the carpet by
about two inches, on turned feet, but I could see nothing more of the
finger.</p>

<p>I got my umbrella and thrust it beneath, and raked forwards and
backwards, right and left, and raked out flue, and nothing more
solid.</p>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>I packed my portmanteau next day and returned to my home in the
country. All desire for amusement in town was gone, and the faculty
to transact business had departed as well.</p>

<p>A languor and qualms had come over me, and my head was in a maze.
I was unable to fix my thoughts on anything. At times I was disposed
to believe that my wits were deserting me, at others that I was on
the verge of a severe illness. Anyhow, whether likely to go off my
head or not, or take to my bed, home was the only place for me, and
homeward I sped, accordingly. On reaching my country habitation, my
servant, as usual, took my portmaneau to my bedroom, unstrapped it,
but did not unpack it. I object to his throwing out the contents of
my Gladstone bag; not that there is anything in it he may not see,
but that he puts my things where I cannot find them again. My
clothes--he is welcome to place them where he likes and where they
belong, and this latter he knows better than I do; but, then, I carry
about with me other things than a dress suit, and changes of linen
and flannel. There are letters, papers, books--and the proper
destinations of these are known only to myself. A servant has a
singular and evil knack of putting away literary matter and odd
volumes in such places that it takes the owner half a day to find
them again. Although I was uncomfortable, and my head in a whirl, I
opened and unpacked my own portmanteau. As I was thus engaged I saw
something curled up in my collar-box, the lid of which had got broken
in by a boot-heel impinging on it. I had pulled off the damaged cover
to see if my collars had been spoiled, when something curled up
inside suddenly rose on end and leapt, just like a cheese-jumper, out
of the box, over the edge of the Gladstone bag, and scurried away
across the floor in a manner already familiar to me.</p>

<p>I could not doubt for a moment what it was--here was the finger
again. It had come with me from London to the country.</p>

<p>Whither it went in its run over the floor I do not know, I was too
bewildered to observe.</p>

<p>Somewhat later, towards evening, I seated myself in my easy-chair,
took up a book, and tried to read. I was tired with the journey, with
the knocking about in town, and the discomfort and alarm produced by
the apparition of the finger. I felt worn out. I was unable to give
my attention to what I read, and before I was aware was asleep.
Roused for an instant by the fall of the book from my hands, I
speedily relapsed into unconsciousness. I am not sure that a doze in
an armchair ever does good. It usually leaves me in a semi-stupid
condition and with a headache.</p>

<p>Five minutes in a horizontal position on my bed is worth thirty in
a chair. That is my experience.</p>

<p>In sleeping in a sedentary position the head is a difficulty; it
drops forward or lolls on one side or the other, and has to be
brought back into a position in which the line to the centre of
gravity runs through the trunk, otherwise the head carries the body
over in a sort of general capsize out of the chair on to the
floor.</p>

<p>I slept, on the occasion of which I am speaking, pretty healthily,
because deadly weary; but I was brought to waking, not by my head
falling over the arm of the chair, and my trunk tumbling after it,
but by a feeling of cold extending from my throat to my heart. When I
awoke I was in a diagonal position, with my right ear resting on my
right shoulder, and exposing the left side of my throat, and it was
here---where the jugular vein throbs--that I felt the greatest
intensity of cold. At once I shrugged my left shoulder, rubbing my
neck with the collar of my coat in so doing. Immediately something
fell off, upon the floor, and I again saw the finger.</p>

<p>My disgust--horror, were intensified when I perceived that it was
dragging something after it, which might have been an old stocking,
and which I took at first glance for something of the sort.</p>

<p>The evening sun shone in through my window, in a brilliant golden
ray that lighted the object as it scrambled along. With this
illumination I was able to distinguish what the object was. It is not
easy to describe it, but I will make the attempt.</p>

<p>The finger I saw was solid and material; what it drew after it was
neither, or was in a nebulous, protoplasmic condition. The finger was
attached to a hand that was curdling into matter and in process of
acquiring solidity; attached to the hand was an arm in a very filmy
condition, and this arm belonged to a human body in a still more
vaporous, immaterial condition. This was being dragged along the
floor by the finger, just as a silkworm might pull after it the
tangle of its web. I could see legs and arms, and head, and coat-tail
tumbling about and interlacing and disentangling again in a
promiscuous manner. There were no bone, no muscle, no substance in
the figure; the members were attached to the trunk, which was
spineless, but they had evidently no functions, and were wholly
dependent on the finger which pulled them along in a jumble of parts
as it advanced.</p>

<p>In such confusion did the whole vaporous matter seem, that I
think--I cannot say for certain it was so, but the impression left on
my mind was--that one of the eyeballs was looking out at a nostril,
and the tongue lolling out of one of the ears.</p>

<p>It was, however, only for a moment that I saw this germ-body; I
cannot call by another name that which had not more substance than
smoke. I saw it only so long as it was being dragged athwart the ray
of sunlight. The moment it was pulled jerkily out of the beam into
the shadow beyond, I could see nothing of it, only the crawling
finger.</p>

<p>I had not sufficient moral energy or physical force in me to rise,
pursue, and stamp on the finger, and grind it with my heel into the
floor. Both seemed drained out of me. What became of the finger,
whither it went, how it managed to secrete itself, I do not know. I
had lost the power to inquire. I sat in my chair, chilled, staring
before me into space.</p>

<p>'Please, sir,' a voice said, 'there's Mr Square below, electrical
engineer.'</p>

<p>'Eh?' I looked dreamily round.</p>

<p>My valet was at the door.</p>

<p>'Please, sir, the gentleman would be glad to be allowed to go over
the house and see that all the electrical apparatus is in order.'</p>

<p>'Oh, indeed! Yes--show him up.'</p>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>I had recently placed the lighting of my house in the hands of an
electrical engineer, a very intelligent man, Mr Square, for whom I
had contracted a sincere friendship.</p>

<p>He had built a shed with a dynamo out of sight, and had entrusted
the laying of the wires to subordinates, as he had been busy with
other orders and could not personally watch every detail.</p>

<p>But he was not the man to let anything pass unobserved, and he
knew that electricity was not a force to be played with. Bad or
careless workmen will often insufficiently protect the wires, or
neglect the insertion of the lead which serves as a safety-valve in
the event of the current being too strong. Houses may be set on fire,
human beings fatally shocked, by the neglect of a bad or slovenly
workman.</p>

<p>The apparatus for my mansion was but just completed, and Mr Square
had come to inspect it and make sure that all was right.</p>

<p>He was an enthusiast in the matter of electricity, and saw for it
a vast perspective, the limits of which could not be predicted.</p>

<p>'All forces,' said he, 'are correlated. When you have force in one
form, you may just turn it into this or that, as you like. In one
form it is motive power, in another it is light, in another heat.</p>

<p>'Now we have electricity for illumination. We employ it, but not as
freely as in the States, for propelling vehicles. Why should we have
horses drawing our buses? We should use only electric trains. Why do
we burn coal to warm our shins? There is electricity, which throws
out no filthy smoke as does coal. Why should we let the tides waste
their energies in the Thames? in other estuaries? There we have
Nature supplying us--free, gratis, and for nothing--with all the
force we want for propelling, for heating, for lighting. I will tell
you something more, my dear sir,' said Mr Square. 'I have mentioned
but three modes of force, and have instanced but a limited number of
uses to which electricity may be turned. How is it with photography?
Is not electric light becoming an artistic agent? I bet you', said
he, 'before long it will become a therapeutic agent as well.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes; I have heard of certain impostors with their
life-belts.' Mr Square did not relish this little dig I gave him. He
winced, but returned to the charge. 'We don't know how to direct it
aright, that is all,' said he. 'I haven't taken the matter up, but
others will, I bet; and we shall have electricity used as freely as
now we use powders and pills. I don't believe in doctors' stuffs
myself. I hold that disease lays hold of a man because he lacks
physical force to resist it. Now, is it not obvious that you are
beginning at the wrong end when you attack the disease? What you want
is to supply force, make up for the lack of physical power, and force
is force wherever you find it--here motive, there illuminating, and
so on. I don't see why a physician should not utilize the tide
rushing out under London Bridge for restoring the feeble vigour of
all who are languid and a prey to disorder in the Metropolis. It will
come to that, I bet, and that is not all. Force is force, everywhere.
Political, moral force, physical force, dynamic force, heat, light,
tidal waves, and so on--all are one, all is one. In time we shall
know how to galvanize into aptitude and moral energy all the limp and
crooked consciences and wills that need taking in hand, and such
there always will be in modern civilisation. I don't know how to do
it. I don't know how it will be done, but in the future the priest as
well as the doctor will turn electricity on as his principal, nay,
his only agent. And he can get his force anywhere, out of the running
stream, out of the wind, out of the tidal wave.</p>

<p>'I'll give you an instance,' continued Mr Square, chuckling and
rubbing his hands, 'to show you the great possibilities in
electricity, used in a crude fashion. In a certain great city away
far west in the States, a go-ahead place, too, more so than New York,
they had electric trains all up and down and along the roads to
everywhere. The union men working for the company demanded that the
non-unionists should be turned off. But the company didn't see it.
Instead, it turned off the union men. It had up its sleeve a
sufficiency of the others, and filled all places at once. Union men
didn't like it, and passed word that at a given hour on a certain day
every wire was to be cut. The company knew this by means of its
spies, and turned on, ready for them, three times the power into all
the wires. At the fixed moment, up the poles went the strikers to cut
the cables, and down they came a dozen times quicker than they went
up, I bet. Then there came wires to the hospitals from all quarters
for stretchers to carry off the disabled men, some with broken legs,
arms, ribs; two or three had their necks broken. I reckon the company
was wonderfully merciful--it didn't put on sufficient force to make
cinders of them then and there; possibly opinion might not have liked
it. Stopped the strike, did that. Great moral effect--all done by
electricity.'</p>

<p>In this manner Mr Square was wont to rattle on. He interested me,
and I came to think that there might be something in what he
said--that his suggestions were not mere nonsense. I was glad to see
Mr Square enter my room, shown in by my man. I did not rise from my
chair to shake his hand, for I had not sufficient energy to do so. In
a languid tone I welcomed him and signed to him to take a seat. Mr
Square looked at me with some surprise.</p>

<p>'Why, what's the matter?' he said. 'You seem unwell. Not got the
'flu, have you?'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon?'</p>

<p>'The influenza. Every third person is crying out that he has it,
and the sale of eucalyptus is enormous, not that eucalyptus is any
good. Influenza microbes indeed! What care they for eucalyptus?
You've gone down some steps of the ladder of life since I saw you
last, squire. How do you account for that?'</p>

<p>I hesitated about mentioning the extraordinary circumstances that
had occurred; but Square was a man who would not allow any beating
about the bush. He was downright and straight, and in ten minutes had
got the entire story out of me.</p>

<p>'Rather boisterous for your nerves that--a crawling finger,' said
he. 'It's a queer story taken on end.'</p>

<p>Then he was silent, considering.</p>

<p>After a few minutes he rose, and said: 'I'll go and look at the
fittings, and then I'll turn this little matter of yours over again,
and see if I can't knock the bottom out of it, I'm kinder fond of
these sort of things.'</p>

<p>Mr Square was not a Yankee, but he had lived for some time in
America, and affected to speak like an American. He used expressions,
terms of speech common in the States, but had none of the
Transatlantic twang. He was a man absolutely without affectation in
every other particular; this was his sole weakness, and it was
harmless.</p>

<p>The man was so thorough in all he did that I did not expect his
return immediately. He was certain to examine every portion of the
dynamo engine, and all the connections and burners. This would
necessarily engage him for some hours. As the day was nearly done, I
knew he could not accomplish what he wanted that evening, and
accordingly gave orders that a room should be prepared for him. Then,
as my head was full of pain, and my skin was burning, I told my
servant to apologize for my absence from dinner, and tell Mr Square
that I was really forced to return to my bed by sickness, and that I
believed I was about to be prostrated by an attack of influenza.</p>

<p>The valet--a worthy fellow, who has been with me for six
years--was concerned at my appearance, and urged me to allow him to
send for a doctor. I had no confidence in the local practitioner, and
if I sent for another from the nearest town I should offend him, and
a row would perhaps ensue, so I declined. If I were really in for an
influenza attack, I knew about as much as any doctor how to deal with
it. Quinine, quinine--that was all. I bade my man light a small lamp,
lower it, so as to give sufficient illumination to enable me to find
some lime-juice at my bed head, and my pocket-handkerchief, and to be
able to read my watch. When he had done this, I bade him leave
me.</p>

<p>I lay in bed, burning, racked with pain in my head, and with my
eyeballs on fire.</p>

<p>Whether I fell asleep or went off my head for a while I cannot
tell. I may have fainted. I have no recollection of anything after
having gone to bed and taken a sip of lime-juice that tasted to me
like soap--till I was roused by a sense of pain in my ribs--a slow,
gnawing, torturing pain, waxing momentarily more intense. In
half-consciousness I was partly dreaming and partly aware of actual
suffering. The pain was real; but in my fancy I thought that a great
maggot was working its way into my side between my ribs. I seemed to
see it. It twisted itself half round, then reverted to its former
position, and again twisted itself, moving like a bradawl, not like a
gimlet, which latter forms a complete revolution.</p>

<p>This, obviously, must have been a dream, hallucination only, as I
was lying on my back and my eyes were directed towards the bottom of
the bed, and the coverlet and blankets and sheet intervened between
my eyes and my side. But in fever one sees without eyes, and in every
direction, and through all obstructions.</p>

<p>Roused thoroughly by an excruciating twinge, I tried to cry out,
and succeeded in throwing myself over on my right side, that which
was in pain. At once I felt the thing withdrawn that was awling--if I
may use the word--in between my ribs.</p>

<p>And now I saw, standing beside the bed, a figure that had its arm
under the bedclothes, and was slowly removing it. The hand was
leisurely drawn from under the coverings and rested on the eiderdown
coverlet, with the forefinger extended.</p>

<p>The figure was that of a man, in shabby clothes, with a sallow,
mean face, a retreating forehead, with hair cut after the French
fashion, and a moustache, dark. The jaws and chin were covered with a
bristly growth, as if shaving had been neglected for a fortnight. The
figure did not appear to be thoroughly solid, but to be of the
consistency of curd, and the face was of the complexion of curd. As I
looked at this object it withdrew, sliding backward in an odd sort of
manner, and as though overweighted by the hand, which was the most
substantial, indeed the only substantial portion of it. Though the
figure retreated stooping, yet it was no longer huddled along by the
finger, as if it had no material existence. If the same, it had
acquired a consistency and a solidity which it did not possess
before.</p>

<p>How it vanished I do not know, nor whither it went. The door
opened, and Square came in.</p>

<p>'What!' he exclaimed with cheery voice; 'influenza is it?'</p>

<p>'I don't know--I think it's that finger again.'</p>

<h3>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>'Now, look here,' said Square, 'I'm not going to have that cuss at
its pranks anymore. Tell me all about it.'</p>

<p>I was now so exhausted, so feeble, that I was not able to give a
connected account of what had taken place, but Square put to me just
a few pointed questions and elicited the main facts. He pieced them
together in his own orderly mind, so as to form a connected whole.
'There is a feature in the case,' said he, 'that strikes me as
remarkable and important. At first--a finger only, then a hand, then
a nebulous figure attached to the hand, without backbone, without
consistency.</p>

<p>'Lastly, a complete form, with consistency and with backbone, but
the latter in a gelatinous condition, and the entire figure
overweighted by the hand, just as hand and figure were previously
overweighted by the finger. Simultaneously with this compacting and
consolidating of the figure, came your degeneration and loss of vital
force and, in a word, of health. What you lose, that object acquires,
and what it acquires, it gains by contact with you. That's clear
enough, is it not?'</p>

<p>'I dare say. I don't know. I can't think.'</p>

<p>'I suppose not; the faculty of thought is drained out of you. Very
well, I must think for you, and I will. Force is force, and see if I
can't deal with your visitant in such a way as will prove just as
truly a moral dissuasive as that employed on the union men on strike
in--never mind where it was. That's not to the point.'</p>

<p>'Will you kindly give me some lime-juice?' I entreated.</p>

<p>I sipped the acid draught, but without relief. I listened to
Square, but without hope. I wanted to be left alone. I was weary of
my pain, weary of everything, even of life. It was a matter of
indifference to me whether I recovered or slipped out of
existence.</p>

<p>'It will be here again shortly,' said the engineer. 'As the French
say, l'appetit vient en mangeant. It has been at you thrice, it won't
be content without another peck. And if it does get another, I guess
it will pretty well about finish you.'</p>

<p>Mr Square rubbed his chin, and then put his hands into his trouser
pockets. That also was a trick acquired in the States, an inelegant
one. His hands, when not actively occupied, went into his pockets,
inevitably they gravitated thither. Ladies did not like Square; they
said he was not a gentleman. But it was not that he said or did
anything 'off colour', only he spoke to them, looked at them, walked
with them, always with his hands in his pockets. I have seen a lady
turn her back on him deliberately because of this trick.</p>

<p>Standing now with his hands in his pockets, he studied my bed, and
said contemptuously:</p>

<p>'Old-fashioned and bad, fourposter. Oughtn't to be allowed, I
guess; unwholesome all the way round.'</p>

<p>I was not in a condition to dispute this. I like a fourposter with
curtains at head and feet; not that I ever draw them, but it gives a
sense of privacy that is wanting in one of your half-tester beds.</p>

<p>If there is a window at one's feet, one can lie in bed without the
glare in one's eyes, and yet without darkening the room by drawing
the blinds. There is much to be said for a fourposter, but this is
not the place in which to say it.</p>

<p>Mr Square pulled his hands out of his pockets and began fiddling
with the electric point near the head of my bed, attached a wire,
swept it in a semicircle along the floor, and then thrust the knob at
the end into my hand in the bed.</p>

<p>'Keep your eye open,' said he, 'and your hand shut and covered. If
that finger comes again tickling your ribs, try it with the point.
I'll manage the switch, from behind the curtain.'</p>

<p>Then he disappeared.</p>

<p>I was too indifferent in my misery to turn my head and observe
where he was. I remained inert, with the knob in my hand, and my eyes
closed, suffering and thinking of nothing but the shooting pains
through my head and the aches in my loins and back and legs.</p>

<p>Some time probably elapsed before I felt the finger again at work
at my ribs; it groped, but no longer bored. I now felt the entire
hand, not a single finger, and the hand was substantial, cold, and
clammy. I was aware, how, I know not, that if the finger-point
reached the region of my heart, on the left side, the hand would, so
to speak, sit down on it, with the cold palm over it, and that then
immediately my heart would cease to beat, and it would be, as Square
might express it, 'gone coon' with me.</p>

<p>In self-preservation I brought up the knob of the electric wire
against the hand--against one of the fingers, I think--and at once
was aware of a rapping, squealing noise. I turned my head languidly,
and saw the form, now more substantial than before, capering in an
ecstasy of pain, endeavouring fruitlessly to withdraw its arm from
under the bedclothes, and the hand from the electric point.</p>

<p>At the same moment Square stepped from behind the curtain, with a
dry laugh, and said: 'I thought we should fix him. He has the coil
about him, and can't escape. Now let us drop to particulars. But I
shan't let you off till I know all about you.'</p>

<p>The last sentence was addressed, not to me, but to the
apparition.</p>

<p>Thereupon he bade me take the point away from the hand of the
figure--being--whatever it was, but to be ready with it at a moment's
notice. He then proceeded to catechize my visitor, who moved
restlessly within the circle of wire, but could not escape from it.
It replied in a thin, squealing voice that sounded as if it came from
a distance, and had a querulous tone in it. I do not pretend to give
all that was said. I cannot recollect everything that passed. My
memory was affected by my illness, as well as my body. Yet I prefer
giving the scraps that I recollect to what Square told me he had
heard.</p>

<p>'Yes--I was unsuccessful, always was. Nothing answered with me.
The world was against me.</p>

<p>'Society was. I hate Society. I don't like work neither, never did.
But I like agitating against what is established. I hate the Royal
Family, the landed interest, the parsons, everything that is, except
the people--that is, the unemployed. I always did. I couldn't get
work as suited me. When I died they buried me in a cheap coffin, dirt
cheap, and gave me a nasty grave, cheap, and a service rattled away
cheap, and no monument. Didn't want none. Oh! there are lots of us.
All discontented. Discontent! That's a passion, it is--it gets into
the veins, it fills the brain, it occupies the heart; it's a sort of
divine cancer that takes possession of the entire man, and makes him
dissatisfied with everything, and hate everybody. But we must have
our share of happiness at some time. We all crave for it in one way
or other. Some think there's a future state of blessedness and so
have hope, and look to attain to it, for hope is a cable and anchor
that attaches to what is real, But when you have no hope of that
sort, don't believe in any future state, you must look for happiness
in life here. We didn't get it when we were alive, so we seek to
procure it after we are dead. We can do it, if we can get out of our
cheap and nasty coffins. But not till the greater part of us is
mouldered away. If a finger or two remains, that can work its way up
to the surface, those cheap deal coffins go to pieces quick enough.
Then the only solid part of us left can pull the rest of us that has
gone to nothing after it. Then we grope about after the living.</p>

<p>'The well-to-do if we can get at them--the honest working poor if
we can't--we hate them too, because they are content and happy. If we
reach any of these, and can touch them, then we can draw their vital
force out of them into ourselves, and recuperate at their expense.
That was about what I was going to do with you. Getting on famous.
Nearly solidified into a new man; and given another chance in life.
But I've missed it this time. Just like my luck. Miss everything.
Always have, except misery and disappointment. Get plenty of
that.'</p>

<p>'What are you all?' asked Square. 'Anarchists out of employ?'</p>

<p>'Some of us go by that name, some by other designations, but we
are all one, and own allegiance to but one monarch--Sovereign
discontent. We are bred to have a distaste for manual work; and we
grow up loafers, grumbling at everything and quarrelling with Society
that is around us and the Providence that is above us.'</p>

<p>'And what do you call yourselves now?'</p>

<p>'Call ourselves? Nothing; we are the same, in another condition,
that is all. Folk once called us Anarchists, Nihilists, Socialists,
Levelers, now they call us the Influenza. The learned talk of
microbes, and bacilli, and bacteria. Microbes, bacilli, and bacteria
be blowed! We are the Influenza; we the social failures, the
generally discontented, coming up out of our cheap and nasty graves
in the form of physical disease We are the Influenza.'</p>

<p>'There you are, I guess!' exclaimed Square triumphantly. 'Did I
not say that all forces were correlated? If so, then all negations,
deficiences of force are one in their several manifestations.</p>

<p>'Talk of Divine discontent as a force impelling to progress!
Rubbish, it is a paralysis of energy. It turns all it absorbs to
acid, to envy, spite, gall. It inspires nothing, but rots the whole
moral system. Here you have it--moral, social, political discontent
in another form, nay aspect--that is all. What Anarchism is in the
body Politic, that Influenza is in the body Physical. Do you see
that?'</p>

<p>'Ye-e-e-e-s,' I believe I answered, and dropped away into the land
of dreams.</p>

<p>I recovered. What Square did with the Thing I know not, but
believe that he reduced it again to its former negative and
self-decomposing condition.</p>
