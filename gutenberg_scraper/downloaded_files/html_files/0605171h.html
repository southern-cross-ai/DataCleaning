<h2><a name="ch01"></a>How Fear Departed from the Long Gallery</h2>

<p>Church-Peveril is a house so beset and frequented by spectres,
both visible and audible, that none of the family which it shelters
under its acre and a half of green copper roofs takes psychical
phenomena with any seriousness. For to the Peverils the appearance of
a ghost is a matter of hardly greater significance than is the
appearance of the post to those who live in more ordinary houses. It
arrives, that is to say, practically every day, it knocks (or makes
other noises), it is observed coming up the drive (or in other
places). I myself, when staying there, have seen the present Mrs.
Peveril, who is rather short-sighted, peer into the dusk, while we
were taking our coffee on the terrace after dinner, and say to her
daughter:</p>

<p>"My dear, was not that the Blue Lady who has just gone into the
shrubbery. I hope she won't frighten Flo. Whistle for Flo, dear."</p>

<p>(Flo, it may be remarked, is the youngest and most precious of
many dachshunds.)</p>

<p>Blanche Peveril gave a cursory whistle, and crunched the sugar
left unmelted at the bottom of her coffee-cup between her very white
teeth.</p>

<p>"Oh, darling, Flo isn't so silly as to mind," she said. "Poor blue
Aunt Barbara is such a bore!"</p>

<p>"Whenever I meet her she always looks as if she wanted to speak to
me, but when I say, 'What is it, Aunt Barbara?' she never utters, but
only points somewhere towards the house, which is so vague. I believe
there was something she wanted to confess about two hundred years
ago, but she has forgotten what it is."</p>

<p>Here Flo gave two or three short pleased barks, and came out of
the shrubbery wagging her tail, and capering round what appeared to
me to be a perfectly empty space on the lawn.</p>

<p>"There! Flo has made friends with her," said Mrs. Peveril. "I
wonder why she -- in that very stupid shade of blue."</p>

<p>From this it may be gathered that even with regard to psychical
phenomena there is some truth in the proverb that speaks of
familiarity. But the Peverils do not exactly treat their ghosts with
contempt, since most of that delightful family never despised anybody
except such people as avowedly did not care for hunting or shooting,
or golf or skating. And as all of their ghosts are of their family,
it seems reasonable to suppose that they all, even the poor Blue
Lady, excelled at one time in field-sports. So far, then, they
harbour no such unkindness or contempt, but only pity. Of one
Peveril, indeed, who broke his neck in vainly attempting to ride up
the main staircase on a thoroughbred mare after some monstrous and
violent deed in the back-garden, they are very fond, and Blanche
comes downstairs in the morning with an eye unusually bright when she
can announce that Master Anthony was "very loud" last night. He
(apart from the fact of his having been so foul a ruffian) was a
tremendous fellow across country, and they like these indications of
the continuance of his superb vitality. In fact, it is supposed to be
a compliment, when you go to stay at Church-Peveril, to be assigned a
bedroom which is frequented by defunct members of the family. It
means that you are worthy to look on the august and villainous dead,
and you will find yourself shown into some vaulted or tapestried
chamber, without benefit of electric light, and are told that
great-great-grandmamma Bridget occasionally has vague business by the
fireplace, but it is better not to talk to her, and that you will
hear Master Anthony "awfully well" if he attempts the front staircase
any time before morning. There you are left for your night's repose,
and, having quakingly undressed, begin reluctantly to put out your
candles. It is draughty in these great chambers, and the solemn
tapestry swings and bellows and subsides, and the firelight dances on
the forms of huntsmen and warriors and stern pursuits. Then you climb
into your bed, a bed so huge that you feel as if the desert of Sahara
was spread for you, and pray, like the mariners who sailed with St.
Paul, for day. And, all the time, you are aware that Freddy and Harry
and Blanche and possibly even Mrs. Peveril are quite capable of
dressing up and making disquieting tappings outside your door, so
that when you open it some inconjecturable horror fronts you. For
myself, I stick steadily to the assertion that I have an obscure
valvular disease of the heart, and so sleep undisturbed in the new
wing of the house where Aunt Barbara, and great-great-grandmamma
Bridget and Master Anthony never penetrate. I forget the details of
great-great-grandmamma Bridget, but she certainly cut the throat of
some distant relation before she disembowelled herself with the axe
that had been used at Agincourt. Before that she had led a very
sultry life, crammed with amazing incident.</p>

<p>But there is one ghost at Church-Peveril at which the family never
laugh, in which they feel no friendly and amused interest, and of
which they only speak just as much as is necessary for the safety of
their guests. More properly it should be described as two ghosts, for
the "haunt" in question is that of two very young children, who were
twins. These, not without reason, the family take very seriously
indeed. The story of them, as told me by Mrs. Peveril, is as
follows:</p>

<p>In the year 1602, the same being the last of Queen Elizabeth's
reign, a certain Dick Peveril was greatly in favour at Court. He was
brother to Master Joseph Peveril, then owner of the family house and
lands, who two years previously, at the respectable age of
seventy-four, became father of twin boys, first-born of his progeny.
It is known that the royal and ancient virgin had said to handsome
Dick, who was nearly forty years his brother's junior, "'Tis pity
that you are not master of Church-Peveril," and these words probably
suggested to him a sinister design. Be that as it may, handsome Dick,
who very adequately sustained the family reputation for wickedness,
set off to ride down to Yorkshire, and found that, very conveniently,
his brother Joseph had just been seized with an apoplexy, which
appeared to be the result of a continued spell of hot weather
combined with the necessity of quenching his thirst with an augmented
amount of sack, and had actually died while handsome Dick, with God
knows what thoughts in his mind, was journeying northwards. Thus it
came about that he arrived at Church-Peveril just in time for his
brother's funeral. It was with great propriety that he attended the
obsequies, and returned to spend a sympathetic day or two of mourning
with his widowed sister-in-law, who was but a faint-hearted dame,
little fit to be mated with such hawks as these. On the second night
of his stay, he did that which the Peverils regret to this day. He
entered the room where the twins slept with their nurse, and quietly
strangled the latter as she slept. Then he took the twins and put
them into the fire which warms the long gallery. The weather, which
up to the day of Joseph's death had been so hot, had changed suddenly
to bitter cold, and the fire was heaped high with burning logs and
was exultant with flame. In the core of this conflagration he struck
out a cremation-chamber, and into that he threw the two children,
stamping them down with his riding-boots. They could just walk, but
they could not walk out of that ardent place. It is said that he
laughed as he added more logs. Thus he became master of
Church-Peveril.</p>

<p>The crime was never brought home to him, but he lived no longer
than a year in the enjoyment of his blood-stained inheritance. When
he lay a-dying he made his confession to the priest who attended him,
but his spirit struggled forth from its fleshly coil before
Absolution could be given him. On that very night there began in
Church-Peveril the haunting which to this day is but seldom spoken of
by the family, and then only in low tones and with serious mien. For
only an hour or two after handsome Dick's death, one of the servants
passing the door of the long gallery heard from within peals of the
loud laughter so jovial and yet so sinister which he had thought
would never be heard in the house again. In a moment of that cold
courage which is so nearly akin to mortal terror he opened the door
and entered, expecting to see he knew not what manifestation of him
who lay dead in the room below. Instead he saw two little white-robed
figures toddling towards him hand in hand across the moon-lit
floor.</p>

<p>The watchers in the room below ran upstairs startled by the crash
of his fallen body, and found him lying in the grip of some dread
convulsion. Just before morning he regained consciousness and told
his tale. Then pointing with trembling and ash-grey finger towards
the door, he screamed aloud, and so fell back dead.</p>

<p>During the next fifty years this strange and terrible legend of
the twin-babies became fixed and consolidated. Their appearance,
luckily for those who inhabit the house, was exceedingly rare, and
during these years they seem to have been seen four or five times
only. On each occasion they appeared at night, between sunset and
sunrise, always in the same long gallery, and always as two toddling
children scarcely able to walk. And on each occasion the luckless
individual who saw them died either speedily or terribly, or with
both speed and terror, after the accursed vision had appeared to him.
Sometimes he might live for a few months: he was lucky if he died, as
did the servant who first saw them, in a few hours. Vastly more awful
was the fate of a certain Mrs.</p>

<p>Canning, who had the ill-luck to see them in the middle of the
next century, or to be quite accurate, in the year 1760. By this time
the hours and the place of their appearance were well known, and, as
up till a year ago, visitors were warned not to go between sunset and
sunrise into the long gallery.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Canning, a brilliantly clever and beautiful woman,
admirer also and friend of the notorious sceptic M. Voltaire,
wilfully went and sat night after night, in spite of all
protestations, in the haunted place. For four evenings she saw
nothing, but on the fifth she had her will, for the door in the
middle of the gallery opened, and there came toddling towards her the
ill-omened innocent little pair. It seemed that even then she was not
frightened, but she thought it good, poor wretch, to mock at them,
telling them it was time for them to get back into the fire. They
gave no word in answer, but turned away from her crying and sobbing.
Immediately after they disappeared from her vision and she rustled
downstairs to where the family and guests in the house were waiting
for her, with the triumphant announcement that she has seen them
both, and must needs write to M. Voltaire, saying that she had spoken
to spirits made manifest. It would make him laugh. But when some
months later the whole news reached him he did not laugh at all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Canning was one of the great beauties of her day, and in the
year 1760 she was at the height and zenith of her blossoming. The
chief beauty, if it is possible to single out one point where all was
so exquisite, lay in the dazzling colour and incomparable brilliance
of her complexion. She was now just thirty years of age, but, in
spite of the excesses of her life, retained the snow and roses of
girlhood, and she courted the bright light of day which other women
shunned, for it but showed to great advantage the splendour of her
skin. In consequence she was very considerably dismayed one morning,
about a fortnight after her strange experience in the long gallery,
to observe on her left cheek, an inch or two below her
turquoise-coloured eyes, a little greyish patch of skin, about as big
as a threepenny piece. It was in vain that she applied her accustomed
washes and unguents: vain, too, were the arts of her fardeuse and of
her medical adviser. For a week she kept herself secluded, martyring
herself with solitude and unaccustomed physics, and for result at the
end of the week she had no amelioration to comfort herself with:
instead this woeful grey patch had doubled itself in size. Thereafter
the nameless disease, whatever it was, developed in new and terrible
ways. From the centre of the discoloured place there sprouted forth
little lichen-like tendrils of greenish-grey, and another patch
appeared on her lower lip. This, too, soon vegetated, and one
morning, on opening her eyes to the horror of a new day, she found
that her vision was strangely blurred. She sprang to her
looking-glass, and what she saw caused her to shriek aloud with
horror. From under her upper eye-lid a fresh growth had sprung up,
mushroom-like, in the night, and its filaments extended downwards,
screening the pupil of her eye. Soon after, her tongue and throat
were attacked: the air passages became obstructed, and death by
suffocation was merciful after such suffering.</p>

<p>More terrible yet was the case of a certain Colonel Blantyre who
fired at the children with his revolver. What he went through is not
to be recorded here.</p>

<p>It is this haunting, then, that the Peverils take quite seriously,
and every guest on his arrival in the house is told that the long
gallery must not be entered after nightfall on any pretext whatever.
By day, however, it is a delightful room and intrinsically merits
description, apart from the fact that the due understanding of its
geography is necessary for the account that here follows. It is full
eighty feet in length, and is lit by a row of six tall windows
looking over the gardens at the back of the house. A door
communicates with the landing at the top of the main staircase, and
about half-way down the gallery in the wall facing the windows is
another door communicating with the back staircase and servants'
quarters, and thus the gallery forms a constant place of passage for
them in going to the rooms on the first landing. It was through this
door that the baby-figures came when they appeared to Mrs. Canning,
and on several other occasions they have been known to make their
entry here, for the room out of which handsome Dick took them lies
just beyond at the top of the back stairs. Further on again in the
gallery is the fireplace into which he thrust them, and at the far
end a large bow-window looks straight down the avenue. Above this
fireplace there hangs with grim significance a portrait of handsome
Dick, in the insolent beauty of early manhood, attributed to Holbein,
and a dozen other portraits of great merit face the windows. During
the day this is the most frequented sitting-room in the house, for
its other visitors never appear there then, nor does it then ever
resound with the harsh jovial laugh of handsome Dick, which
sometimes, after dark has fallen, is heard by passers-by on the
landing outside. But Blanche does not grow bright-eyed when she hears
it: she shuts her ears and hastens to put a greater distance between
her and the sound of that atrocious mirth.</p>

<p>But during the day the long gallery is frequented by many
occupants, and much laughter in no wise sinister or saturnine
resounds there. When summer lies hot over the land, those occupants
lounge in the deep window seats, and when winter spreads his icy
fingers and blows shrilly between his frozen palms, congregate round
the fireplace at the far end, and perch, in companies of cheerful
chatterers, upon sofa and chair, and chair-back and floor. Often have
I sat there on long August evenings up till dressing-time, but never
have I been there when anyone has seemed disposed to linger over-late
without hearing the warning: "It is close on sunset: shall we go?"
Later on in the shorter autumn days they often have tea laid there,
and sometimes it has happened that, even while merriment was most
uproarious, Mrs. Peveril has suddenly looked out of the window and
said, "My dears, it is getting so late: let us finish our nonsense
downstairs in the hall." And then for a moment a curious hush always
falls on loquacious family and guests alike, and as if some bad news
had just been known, we all make our silent way out of the place.</p>

<p>But the spirits of the Peverils (of the living ones, that is to
say) are the most mercurial imaginable, and the blight which the
thought of handsome Dick and his doings casts over them passes away
again with amazing rapidity.</p>

<p>A typical party, large, young, and peculiarly cheerful, was
staying at Church-Peveril shortly after Christmas last year, and as
usual on December 31, Mrs. Peveril was giving her annual New Year's
Eve ball. The house was quite full, and she had commandeered as well
the greater part of the Peveril Arms to provide sleeping-quarters for
the overflow from the house. For some days past a black and windless
frost had stopped all hunting, but it is an ill windlessness that
blows no good (if so mixed a metaphor may be forgiven), and the lake
below the house had for the last day or two been covered with an
adequate and admirable sheet of ice. Everyone in the house had been
occupied all the morning of that day in performing swift and violent
manoeuvres on the elusive surface, and as soon as lunch was over we
all, with one exception, hurried out again. This one exception was
Madge Dalrymple, who had had the misfortune to fall rather badly
earlier in the day, but hoped, by resting her injured knee, instead
of joining the skaters again, to be able to dance that evening. The
hope, it is true, was the most sanguine sort, for she could but
hobble ignobly back to the house, but with the breezy optimism which
characterises the Peverils (she is Blanche's first cousin), she
remarked that it would be but tepid enjoyment that she could, in her
present state, derive from further skating, and thus she sacrificed
little, but might gain much.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after a rapid cup of coffee which was served in the
long gallery, we left Madge comfortably reclined on the big sofa at
right-angles to the fireplace, with an attractive book to beguile the
tedium till tea. Being of the family, she knew all about handsome
Dick and the babies, and the fate of Mrs. Canning and Colonel
Blantyre, but as we went out I heard Blanche say to her, "Don't run
it too fine, dear," and Madge had replied, "No; I'll go away well
before sunset." And so we left her alone in the long gallery.</p>

<p>Madge read her attractive book for some minutes, but failing to
get absorbed in it, put it down and limped across to the window.
Though it was still but little after two, it was but a dim and
uncertain light that entered, for the crystalline brightness of the
morning had given place to a veiled obscurity produced by flocks of
thick clouds which were coming sluggishly up from the north-east.
Already the whole sky was overcast with them, and occasionally a few
snow-flakes fluttered waveringly down past the long windows. From the
darkness and bitter cold of the afternoon, it seemed to her that
there was like to be a heavy snowfall before long, and these outward
signs were echoed inwardly in her by that muffled drowsiness of the
brain, which to those who are sensitive to the pressures and
lightness of weather portends storm. Madge was peculiarly the prey of
such external influences: to her a brisk morning gave an ineffable
brightness and briskness of spirit, and correspondingly the approach
of heavy weather produced a somnolence in sensation that both drowsed
and depressed her.</p>

<p>It was in such mood as this that she limped back again to the sofa
beside the log-fire. The whole house was comfortably heated by
water-pipes, and though the fire of logs and peat, an adorable
mixture, had been allowed to burn low, the room was very warm. Idly
she watched the dwindling flames, not opening her book again, but
lying on the sofa with face towards the fireplace, intending drowsily
and not immediately to go to her own room and spend the hours, until
the return of the skaters made gaiety in the house again, in writing
one or two neglected letters. Still drowsily she began thinking over
what she had to communicate: one letter several days overdue should
go to her mother, who was immensely interested in the psychical
affairs of the family. She would tell her how Master Anthony had been
prodigiously active on the staircase a night or two ago, and how the
Blue Lady, regardless of the severity of the weather, had been seen
by Mrs. Peveril that morning, strolling about. It was rather
interesting: the Blue Lady had gone down the laurel walk and had been
seen by her to enter the stables, where, at the moment, Freddy
Peveril was inspecting the frost-bound hunters. Identically then, a
sudden panic had spread through the stables, and the horses had
whinnied and kicked, and shied, and sweated. Of the fatal twins
nothing had been seen for many years past, but, as her mother knew,
the Peverils never used the long gallery after dark.</p>

<p>Then for a moment she sat up, remembering that she was in the long
gallery now. But it was still but a little after half-past two, and
if she went to her room in half an hour, she would have ample time to
write this and another letter before tea. Till then she would read
her book. But she found she had left it on the window-sill, and it
seemed scarcely worth while to get it. She felt exceedingly
drowsy.</p>

<p>The sofa where she lay had been lately recovered, in a greyish
green shade of velvet, somewhat the colour of lichen. It was of very
thick soft texture, and she luxuriously stretched her arms out, one
on each side of her body, and pressed her fingers into the nap. How
horrible that story of Mrs. Canning was: the growth on her face was
of the colour of lichen. And then without further transition or
blurring of thought Madge fell asleep.</p>

<p>She dreamed. She dreamed that she awoke and found herself exactly
where she had gone to sleep, and in exactly the same attitude. The
flames from the logs had burned up again, and leaped on the walls,
fitfully illuminating the picture of handsome Dick above the
fireplace. In her dream she knew exactly what she had done to-day,
and for what reason she was lying here now instead of being out with
the rest of the skaters. She remembered also (still dreaming), that
she was going to write a letter or two before tea, and prepared to
get up in order to go to her room. As she half-rose she caught sight
of her own arms lying out on each side of her on the grey velvet
sofa.</p>

<p>But she could not see where her hands ended, and where the grey
velvet began: her fingers seemed to have melted into the stuff. She
could see her wrists quite clearly, and a blue vein on the backs of
her hands, and here and there a knuckle. Then, in her dream, she
remembered the last thought which had been in her mind before she
fell asleep, namely the growth of the lichen-coloured vegetation on
the face and the eyes and the throat of Mrs. Canning. At that thought
the strangling terror of real nightmare began: she knew that she was
being transformed into this grey stuff, and she was absolutely unable
to move. Soon the grey would spread up her arms, and over her feet;
when they came in from skating they would find here nothing but a
huge misshapen cushion of lichen-coloured velvet, and that would be
she. The horror grew more acute, and then by a violent effort she
shook herself free of the clutches of this very evil dream, and she
awoke.</p>

<p>For a minute or two she lay there, conscious only of the
tremendous relief at finding herself awake. She felt again with her
fingers the pleasant touch of the velvet, and drew them backwards and
forwards, assuring herself that she was not, as her dream had
suggested, melting into greyness and softness. But she was still, in
spite of the violence of her awakening, very sleepy, and lay there
till, looking down, she was aware that she could not see her hands at
all. It was very nearly dark.</p>

<p>At that moment a sudden flicker of flame came from the dying fire,
and a flare of burning gas from the peat flooded the room. The
portrait of handsome Dick looked evilly down on her, and her hands
were visible again. And then a panic worse than the panic of her
dreams seized her.</p>

<p>Daylight had altogether faded, and she knew that she was alone in
the dark in the terrible gallery.</p>

<p>This panic was of the nature of nightmare, for she felt unable to
move for terror. But it was worse than nightmare because she knew she
was awake. And then the full cause of this frozen fear dawned on her;
she knew with the certainty of absolute conviction that she was about
to see the twin-babies.</p>

<p>She felt a sudden moisture break out on her face, and within her
mouth her tongue and throat went suddenly dry, and she felt her
tongue grate along the inner surface of her teeth. All power of
movement had slipped from her limbs, leaving them dead and inert, and
she stared with wide eyes into the blackness. The spurt of flame from
the peat had burned itself out again, and darkness encompassed
her.</p>

<p>Then on the wall opposite her, facing the windows, there grew a
faint light of dusky crimson.</p>

<p>For a moment she thought it but heralded the approach of the awful
vision, then hope revived in her heart, and she remembered that thick
clouds had overcast the sky before she went to sleep, and guessed
that this light came from the sun not yet quite sunk and set. This
sudden revival of hope gave her the necessary stimulus, and she
sprang off the sofa where she lay. She looked out of the window and
saw the dull glow on the horizon. But before she could take a step
forward it was obscured again. A tiny sparkle of light came from the
hearth which did no more than illuminate the tiles of the fireplace,
and snow falling heavily tapped at the window panes. There was
neither light nor sound except these.</p>

<p>But the courage that had come to her, giving her the power of
movement, had not quite deserted her, and she began feeling her way
down the gallery. And then she found that she was lost. She stumbled
against a chair, and, recovering herself, stumbled against another.
Then a table barred her way, and, turning swiftly aside, she found
herself up against the back of a sofa.</p>

<p>Once more she turned and saw the dim gleam of the firelight on the
side opposite to that on which she expected it. In her blind gropings
she must have reversed her direction. But which way was she to go
now. She seemed blocked in by furniture. And all the time insistent
and imminent was the fact that the two innocent terrible ghosts were
about to appear to her.</p>

<p>Then she began to pray. "Lighten our darkness, O Lord," she said
to herself. But she could not remember how the prayer continued, and
she had sore need of it. There was something about the perils of the
night. All this time she felt about her with groping, fluttering
hands. The fire-glimmer which should have been on her left was on her
right again; therefore she must turn herself round again. "Lighten
our darkness," she whispered, and then aloud she repeated, "Lighten
our darkness."</p>

<p>She stumbled up against a screen, and could not remember the
existence of any such screen.</p>

<p>Hastily she felt beside it with blind hands, and touched something
soft and velvety. Was it the sofa on which she had lain? If so, where
was the head of it. It had a head and a back and feet--it was like a
person, all covered with grey lichen. Then she lost her head
completely. All that remained to her was to pray; she was lost, lost
in this awful place, where no one came in the dark except the babies
that cried. And she heard her voice rising from whisper to speech,
and speech to scream. She shrieked out the holy words, she yelled
them as if blaspheming as she groped among tables and chairs and the
pleasant things of ordinary life which had become so terrible.</p>

<p>Then came a sudden and an awful answer to her screamed prayer.
Once more a pocket of inflammable gas in the peat on the hearth was
reached by the smouldering embers, and the room started into light.
She saw the evil eyes of handsome Dick, she saw the little ghostly
snow-flakes falling thickly outside. And she saw where she was, just
opposite the door through which the terrible twins made their
entrance. Then the flame went out again, and left her in blackness
once more. But she had gained something, for she had her geography
now. The centre of the room was bare of furniture, and one swift dart
would take her to the door of the landing above the main staircase
and into safety. In that gleam she had been able to see the handle of
the door, bright-brassed, luminous like a star. She would go straight
for it; it was but a matter of a few seconds now.</p>

<p>She took a long breath, partly of relief, partly to satisfy the
demands of her galloping heart.</p>

<p>But the breath was only half-taken when she was stricken once more
into the immobility of nightmare.</p>

<p>There came a little whisper, it was no more than that, from the
door opposite which she stood, and through which the twin-babies
entered. It was not quite dark outside it, for she could see that the
door was opening. And there stood in the opening two little white
figures, side by side. They came towards her slowly, shufflingly. She
could not see face or form at all distinctly, but the two little
white figures were advancing. She knew them to be the ghosts of
terror, innocent of the awful doom they were bound to bring, even as
she was innocent. With the inconceivable rapidity of thought, she
made up her mind what to do. She had not hurt them or laughed at
them, and they, they were but babies when the wicked and bloody deed
had sent them to their burning death. Surely the spirits of these
children would not be inaccessible to the cry of one who was of the
same blood as they, who had committed no fault that merited the doom
they brought. If she entreated them they might have mercy, they might
forebear to bring the curse on her, they might allow her to pass out
of the place without blight, without the sentence of death, or the
shadow of things worse than death upon her.</p>

<p>It was but for the space of a moment that she hesitated, then she
sank down on to her knees, and stretched out her hands towards
them.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dears," she said, "I only fell asleep. I have done no more
wrong than that--"</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and her tender girl's heart thought no more
of herself, but only of them, those little innocent spirits on whom
so awful a doom was laid, that they should bring death where other
children bring laughter, and doom for delight. But all those who had
seen them before had dreaded and feared them, or had mocked at
them.</p>

<p>Then, as the enlightenment of pity dawned on her, her fear fell
from her like the wrinkled sheath that holds the sweet folded buds of
Spring.</p>

<p>"Dears, I am so sorry for you," she said. "It is not your fault
that you must bring me what you must bring, but I am not afraid any
longer. I am only sorry for you. God bless you, you poor
darlings."</p>

<p>She raised her head and looked at them. Though it was so dark, she
could now see their faces, though all was dim and wavering, like the
light of pale flames shaken by a draught. But the faces were not
miserable or fierce--they smiled at her with shy little baby smiles.
And as she looked they grew faint, fading slowly away like wreaths of
vapour in frosty air.</p>

<p>Madge did not at once move when they had vanished, for instead of
fear there was wrapped round her a wonderful sense of peace, so happy
and serene that she would not willingly stir, and so perhaps disturb
it. But before long she got up, and feeling her way, but without any
sense of nightmare pressing her on, or frenzy of fear to spur her,
she went out of the long gallery, to find Blanche just coming
upstairs whistling and swinging her skates.</p>

<p>"How's the leg, dear," she asked. "You're not limping any
more."</p>

<p>Till that moment Madge had not thought of it.</p>

<p>"I think it must be all right," she said; "I had forgotten it,
anyhow. Blanche, dear, you won't be frightened for me, will you,
but--but I have seen the twins."</p>

<p>For a moment Blanche's face whitened with terror.</p>

<p>"What?" she said in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw them just now. But they were kind, they smiled at me,
and I was so sorry for them. And somehow I am sure I have nothing to
fear."</p>

<p>It seems that Madge was right, for nothing has come to touch her.
Something, her attitude to them, we must suppose, her pity, her
sympathy, touched and dissolved and annihilated the curse.</p>

<p>Indeed, I was at Church-Peveril only last week, arriving there
after dark. Just as I passed the gallery door, Blanche came out.</p>

<p>"Ah, there you are," she said: "I've just been seeing the twins.
They looked too sweet and stopped nearly ten minutes. Let us have tea
at once."</p>

<h2><a name="ch02"></a>At Abdul Ali's Grave</h2>

<p>Luxor, as most of those who have been there will allow, is a place
of notable charm, and boasts many attractions for the traveller,
chief among which he will reckon an excellent hotel containing a
billiard-room, a garden fit for the gods to sit in, any quantity of
visitors, at least a weekly dance on board a tourist steamer, quail
shooting, a climate as of Avilion, and a number of stupendously
ancient monuments for those archeologically inclined. But to certain
others, few indeed in number, but almost fanatically convinced of
their own orthodoxy, the charm of Luxor, like some sleeping beauty,
only wakes when these things cease, when the hotel has grown empty
and the billiard-marker "has gone for a long rest" to Cairo, when the
decimated quail and the decimating tourist have fled northwards, and
the Theban plain, Dana to a tropical sun, is a gridiron across which
no man would willingly make a journey by day, not even if Queen
Hatasoo herself should signify that she would give him audience on
the terraces of Deir-el-Bahari.</p>

<p>A suspicion however that the fanatic few were right, for in other
respects they were men of estimable opinions, induced me to examine
their convictions for myself, and thus it came about that two years
ago, certain days toward the beginning of June saw me still there, a
confirmed convert.</p>

<p>Much tobacco and the length of summer days had assisted us to the
analysis of the charm of which summer in the south is possessed, and
Weston--one of the earliest of the elect--and myself had discussed it
at some length, and though we reserved as the principal ingredient a
nameless something which baffled the chemist, and must be felt to be
understood, we were easily able to detect certain other drugs of
sight and sound, which we were agreed contributed to the whole. A few
of them are here sub joined.</p>

<p>The waking in the warm darkness just before dawn to find that the
desire for stopping in bed fails with the awakening.</p>

<p>The silent start across the Nile in the still air with our horses,
who, like us, stand and sniff at the incredible sweetness of the
coming morning without apparently finding it less wonderful in
repetition.</p>

<p>The moment infinitesimal in duration but infinite in sensation,
just before the sun rises, when the grey shrouded river is struck
suddenly out of darkness, and becomes a sheet of green bronze.</p>

<p>The rose flush, rapid as a change of colour in some chemical
combination, which shoots across the sky from east to west, followed
immediately by the sunlight which catches the peaks of the western
hills, and flows down like some luminous liquid.</p>

<p>The stir and whisper which goes through the world: a breeze
springs up; a lark soars, and sings; the boatman shouts "Yallah,
Yallah"; the horses toss their heads.</p>

<p>The subsequent ride.</p>

<p>The subsequent breakfast on our return.</p>

<p>The subsequent absence of anything to do.</p>

<p>At sunset the ride into the desert thick with the scent of warm
barren sand, which smells like nothing else in the world, for it
smells of nothing at all.</p>

<p>The blaze of the tropical night.</p>

<p>Camel's milk.</p>

<p>Converse with the fellahin, who are the most charming and least
accountable people on the face of the earth except when tourists are
about, and when in consequence there is no thought but
backsheesh.</p>

<p>Lastly, and with this we are concerned, the possibility of odd
experiences.</p>

<p>The beginning of the things which make this tale occurred four
days ago, when Abdul Mi, the oldest man in the village, died
suddenly, full of days and riches. Both, some thought, had probably
been somewhat exaggerated, but his relations affirmed without
variation that he had as many years as he had English pounds, and
that each was a hundred. The apt roundness of these numbers was
incontestable, the thing was too neat not to be true, and before he
had been dead for twenty-four hours it was a matter of orthodoxy. But
with regard to his relations, that which turned their bereavement,
which must soon have occurred, into a source of blank dismay instead
of pious resignation, was that not one of these English pounds, not
even their less satisfactory equivalent in notes, which, out of the
tourist season, are looked upon at Luxor as a not very dependable
variety of Philosopher's stone, though certainly capable of producing
gold under favourable circumstances, could be found. Abdul Au with
his hundred years was dead, his century of sovereigns--they might as
well have been an annuity--were dead with him, and his son Mohamed,
who had previously enjoyed a sort of brevet rank in anticipation of
the event, was considered to be throwing far more dust in the air
than the genuine affection even of a chief mourner wholly
justified.</p>

<p>Abdul, it is to be feared, was not a man of stereotyped
respectability; though full of years and riches, he enjoyed no great
reputation for honour. He drank wine whenever he could get it, he ate
food during the days of Ramadan, scornful of the fact, when his
appetite desired it, he was supposed to have the evil eye, and in his
last moments he was attended by the notorious Achmet, who is well
known here to be practised in Black Magic, and has been suspected of
the much meaner crime of robbing the bodies of those lately dead. For
in Egypt, while to despoil the bodies of ancient kings and priests is
a privilege for which advanced and learned societies vie with each
other, to rob the corpses of your contemporaries is considered the
deed of a dog.</p>

<p>Mohamed, who soon exchanged the throwing of dust in the air for
the more natural mode of expressing chagrin, which is to gnaw the
nails, told us in confidence that he suspected Achmet of having
ascertained the secret of where his father's money was, but it
appeared that Achmet had as blank a face as anybody when his patient,
who was striving to make some communication to him, went out into the
great silence, and the suspicion that he knew where the money was
gave way, in the minds, of those who were competent to form an
estimate of his character, to a but dubious regret that he had just
failed to learn that very important fact.</p>

<p>So Abdul died and was buried, and we all went to the funeral
feast, at which we ate more roast meat than one naturally cares about
at five in the afternoon on a June day, in consequence of which
Weston and I, not requiring dinner, stopped at home after our return
from the ride into the desert, and talked to Mohamed, Abdul's son,
and Hussein, Abdul's youngest grandson, a boy of about twenty, who is
also our valet, cook and housemaid, and they together woefully
narrated of the money that had been and was not, and told us
scandalous tales about Achmet concerning his weakness for cemeteries.
They drank coffee and smoked, for though Hussein was our servant, we
had been that day the guests of his father, and shortly after they
had gone, up came Machmout.</p>

<p>Machmout, who says he thinks he is twelve, but does not know for
certain, is kitchen-maid, groom and gardener, and has to an
extraordinary degree some occult power resembling clairvoyance.
Weston, who is a member of the Society for Psychical Research, and
the tragedy of whose life has been the detection of the fraudulent
medium Mrs. Blunt, says that it is all thought-reading, and has made
notes of many of Machmout's performances, which may subsequently turn
out to be of interest. Thought-reading, however, does not seem to me
to fully explain the experience which followed Abdul's funeral, and
with Machmout I have to put it down to White Magic, which should be a
very inclusive term, or to Pure Coincidence, which is even more
inclusive, and will cover all the inexplicable phenomena of the
world, taken singly. Machmout's method of unloosing the forces of
White Magic is simple, being the ink-mirror known by name to many,
and it is as follows.</p>

<p>A little black ink is poured into the palm of Machmout's hand, or,
as ink has been at a premium lately owing to the last post-boat from
Cairo which contained stationery for us having stuck on a sand-bank,
a small piece of black American cloth about an inch in diameter is
found to be a perfect substitute. Upon this he gazes. After five or
ten minutes his shrewd monkey-like expression is struck from his
face, his eyes, wide open, remain fixed on the cloth, a complete
rigidity sets in over his muscles, and he tells us of the curious
things he sees. In whatever position he is, in that position he
remains without the deflection of a hair's breadth until the ink is
washed off or the cloth removed. Then he looks up and says
"Khah&aacute;s," which means, "It is finished."</p>

<p>We only engaged Machmout's services as second general domestic a
fortnight ago, but the first evening he was with us he came upstairs
when he had finished his work, and said, "I will show you White
Magic; give me ink," and proceeded to describe the front hall of our
house in London, saying that there were two horses at the door, and
that a man and woman soon came out, gave the horses each a piece of
bread and mounted. The thing was so probable that by the next mail I
wrote asking my mother to write down exactly what she was doing and
where at half-past five (English time) on the evening of June 12. At
the corresponding time in Egypt Machmout was describing speaking to
us of a "sitt" (lady) having tea in a room which he described with
some minuteness, and I am waiting anxiously for her letter. The
explanation which Weston gives us of all these phenomena is that a
certain picture of people I know is present in my mind, though I may
not be aware of it,--present to my subliminal self, I think, he
says,--and that I give an unspoken suggestion to the hypnotised
Machmout. My explanation is that there isn't any explanation, for no
suggestion on my part would make my brother go out and ride at the
moment when Machmout says he is so doing (if indeed we find that
Machmout's visions are chronologically correct). Consequently I
prefer the open mind and am prepared to believe anything. Weston,
however, does not speak quite so calmly or scientifically about
Machmout's last performance, and since it took place he has almost
entirely ceased to urge me to become a member of the Society for
Psychical Research, in order that I may no longer be hidebound by
vain superstitions.</p>

<p>Machmout will not exercise these powers if his own folk are
present, for he says that when he is in this state, if a man who knew
Black Magic was in the room, or knew that he was practising White
Magic, he could get the spirit who presides over the Black Magic to
kill the spirit of White Magic, for the Black Magic is the more
potent, and the two are foes. And as the spirit of White Magic is on
occasions a powerful friend--he had before now befriended Machmout in
a manner which I consider incredible--Machmout is very desirous that
he should abide long with him. But Englishmen it appears do not know
the Black Magic, so with us he is safe. The spirit of Black Magic, to
speak to whom it is death, Machmout saw once "between heaven and
earth, and night and day," so he phrases it, on the Karnak road. He
may be known, he told us, by the fact that he is of paler skin than
his people, that he has two long teeth, one in each corner of his
mouth, and that his eyes, which are white all over, are as big as the
eyes of a horse.</p>

<p>Machmout squatted himself comfortably in the corner, and I gave
him the piece of black American cloth. As some minutes must elapse
before he gets into the hypnotic state in which the visions begin, I
strolled out on to the balcony for coolness. It was the hottest night
we had yet had, and though the sun had set three hours, the
thermometer still registered close on 100&ordm;.</p>

<p>Above, the sky seemed veiled with grey, where it should have been
dark velvety blue, and a fitful puffing wind from the south
threatened three days of the sandy intolerable khamseen. A little way
up the street to the left was a small caf&eacute; in front of which
were glowing and waning little glowworm specks of light from the
water pipes of Arabs sitting out there in the dark. From inside came
the click of brass castanets in the hands of some dancing-girl,
sounding sharp and precise against the wailing bagpipe music of the
strings and pipes which accompany these movements which Arabs love
and Europeans think so unpleasing. Eastwards the sky was paler and
luminous, for the moon was imminently rising, and even as I looked
the red rim of the enormous disc cut the line of the desert, and on
the instant, with a curious aptness, one of the Arabs outside the
caf&eacute; broke out into that wonderful chant--"I cannot sleep for
longing for thee, O full moon. Far is thy throne over Mecca, slip
down, O beloved, to me."</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards I heard the piping monotone of Machmout's
voice begin, and in a moment or two I went inside.</p>

<p>We have found that the experiments gave the quickest result by
contact, a fact which confirmed Weston in his explanation of them by
thought transference of some elaborate kind, which I confess I cannot
understand. He was writing at a table in the window when I came in,
but looked up.</p>

<p>"Take his hand," he said; "at present he is quite incoherent."</p>

<p>"Do you explain that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is closely analogous, so Myers thinks, to talking in sleep. He
has been saying something about a tomb. Do make a suggestion, and see
if he gives it right. He is remarkably sensitive, and he responds
quicker to you than to me. Probably Abdul's funeral suggested the
tomb!"</p>

<p>A sudden thought struck me.</p>

<p>"Hush!" I said, "I want to listen."</p>

<p>Machmout's head was thrown a little back, and he held the hand in
which was the piece of cloth rather above his face. As usual he was
talking very slowly, and in a high staccato voice, absolutely unlike
his usual tones.</p>

<p>"On one side of the grave," he pipes, "is a tamarisk tree, and the
green beetles make fantasia about it. On the other side is a mud
wall. There are many other graves about, but they are all asleep.
This is the grave, because it is awake, and it moist and not
sandy."</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Weston. "It is Abdul's grave he is talking
about."</p>

<p>"There is a red moon sitting on the desert," continued Machmout,
"and it is now. There is the puffing of khamseen, and much dust
coming. The moon is red with dust, and because it is low."</p>

<p>"Still sensitive to external conditions," said Weston. "That is
rather curious. Pinch him, will you?"</p>

<p>I pinched Machmout; he did not pay the slightest attention.</p>

<p>"In the last house of the street, and in the doorway stands a man.
Ah! ah!" cried the boy, suddenly, "it is the Black Magic he knows.
Don't let him come. He is going out of the house," he shrieked, "he
is coming--no, he is going the other way towards the moon and the
grave. He has the Black Magic with him, which can raise the dead, and
he has a murdering knife, and a spade. I cannot see his face, for the
Black Magic is between it and my eyes."</p>

<p>Weston had got up, and, like me, was hanging on Machmout's
words.</p>

<p>"We will go there," he said. "Here is an opportunity of testing
it. Listen a moment."</p>

<p>"He is walking, walking, walking," piped Machmout, "still walking
to the moon and the grave. The moon sits no longer on the desert, but
has sprung up a little way."</p>

<p>I pointed out of the window.</p>

<p>"That at any rate is true," I said.</p>

<p>Weston took the cloth out of Machmout's hand, and the piping
ceased. In a moment he stretched himself, and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Khal&aacute;s," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is Khal&aacute;s."</p>

<p>"Did I tell you of the sitt in England?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes," I answered; "thank you, little Machmout. The White
Magic was very good to-night. Get you to bed."</p>

<p>Machmout trotted obediently out of the room, and Weston closed the
door after him.</p>

<p>"We must be quick," he said. "It is worth while going and giving
the thing a chance, though I wish he had seen something less
gruesome. The odd thing is that he was not at the funeral, and yet he
describes the grave accurately. What do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"I make that the White Magic has shown Machmout that somebody with
Black Magic is going to Abdul's grave, perhaps to rob it," I answered
resolutely.</p>

<p>"What are we to do when we get there?" asked Weston.</p>

<p>"See the Black Magic at work. Personally I am in a blue funk. So
are you."</p>

<p>"There is no such thing as Black Magic," said Weston. "Ah, I have
it. Give me that orange."</p>

<p>Weston rapidly skinned it, and cut from the rind two circles as
big as a five shilling piece, and two long, white fangs of skin. The
first he fixed in his eyes, the two latter in the corners of his
mouth.</p>

<p>"The Spirit of Black Magic?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>He took up a long black burnous and wrapped it round him. Even in
the bright lamp light, the spirit of Black Magic was a sufficiently
terrific personage.</p>

<p>"I don't believe in Black Magic," he said, "but others do. If it
is necessary to put a stop to--to anything that is going on, we will
hoist the man on his own petard. Come along. Whom do you suspect it
is--I mean, of course, who was the person you were thinking of when
your thoughts were transferred to Machmout."</p>

<p>"What Machmout said," I answered, "suggested Achmet to me."</p>

<p>Weston indulged in a laugh of scientific incredulity, and we set
off.</p>

<p>The moon, as the boy had told us, was just clear of the horizon,
and as it rose higher, its colour at first red and sombre, like the
blaze of some distant conflagration, paled to a tawny yellow. The hot
wind from the south, blowing no longer fitfully but with a steadily
increasing violence, was thick with sand, and of an incredibly
scorching heat, and the tops of the palm trees in the garden of the
deserted hotel on the right were lashing themselves to and fro with a
harsh rattle of dry leaves. The cemetery lay on the outskirts of the
village, and, as long as our way lay between the mud walls of the
huddling street, the wind came to us only as the heat from behind
closed furnace doors. Every now and then with a whisper and whistle
rising into a great buffeting flap, a sudden whirlwind of dust would
scour some twenty yards along the road, and then break like a
shore-quenched wave against one or other of the mud walls or throw
itself heavily against a house and fall in a shower of sand. But once
free of obstructions we were opposed to the full heat and blast of
the wind which blew full in our teeth. It was the first summer
khamseen of the year, and for the moment I wished I had gone north
with the tourist and the quail and the billiard marker, for khamseen
fetches the marrow out of the bones, and turns the body to blotting
paper.</p>

<p>We passed no one in the street, and the only sound we heard,
except the wind, was the howling of moonstruck dogs.</p>

<p>The cemetery is surrounded by a tall mud-built wall, and
sheltering for a few moments under this we discussed our movements.
The row of tamarisks close to which the tomb lay went down the centre
of the graveyard, and by skirting the wall outside and climbing
softly over where they approached it, the fury of the wind might help
us to get near the grave without being seen, if anyone happened to be
there. We had just decided on this, and were moving on to put the
scheme into execution, when the wind dropped for a moment, and in the
silence we could hear the chump of the spade being driven into the
earth, and what gave me a sudden thrill of intimate horror, the cry
of the carrion-feeding hawk from the dusky sky just overhead.</p>

<p>Two minutes later we were creeping up in the shade of the
tamarisks, to where Abdul had been buried. The great green beetles
which live on the trees were flying about blindly, and once or twice
one dashed into my face with a whirr of mail-clad wings. When we were
within some twenty yards of the grave we stopped for a moment, and,
looking cautiously out from our shelter of tamarisks, saw the figure
of a man already waist deep in the earth, digging out the newly
turned grave. Weston, who was standing behind me, had adjusted the
characteristics of the spirit of Black Magic so as to be ready for
emergencies, and turning round suddenly, and finding myself unawares
face to face with that realistic impersonation, though my nerves are
not precariously strong, I could have found it within me to shriek
aloud. But that unsympathetic man of iron only shook with suppressed
laughter, and, holding the eyes in his hand, motioned me forward
again without speaking to where the trees grew thicker. There we
stood not a dozen yards away from the grave.</p>

<p>We waited, I suppose, for some ten minutes, while the man, whom we
saw to be Achmet, toiled on at his impious task. He was entirely
naked, and his brown skin glistened with the dews of exertion in the
moonlight. At times he chattered in a cold uncanny manner to himself,
and once or twice he stopped for breath. Then he began scraping the
earth away with his hands, and soon afterwards searched in his
clothes, which were lying near, for a piece of rope, with which he
stepped into the grave, and in a moment reappeared again with both
ends in his hands. Then, standing astride the grave, he pulled
strongly, and one end of the coffin appeared above the ground. He
chipped a piece of the lid away to make sure that he had the right
end, and then, setting it upright, wrenched off the top with his
knife, and there faced us, leaning against the coffin lid, the small
shrivelled figure of the dead Abdul, swathed like a baby in
white.</p>

<p>I was just about to motion the spirit of Black Magic to make his
appearance, when Machmout's words came into my head: "He had with him
the Black Magic which can raise the dead," and sudden overwhelming
curiosity, which froze disgust and horror into chill unfeeling
things, came over me.</p>

<p>"Wait," I whispered to Weston, "he will use the Black Magic."</p>

<p>Again the wind dropped for a moment, and again, in the silence
that came with it, I heard the chiding of the hawk overhead, this
time nearer, and thought I heard more birds than one.</p>

<p>Achmet meantime had taken the covering from off the face, and had
undone the swathing band, which at the moment after death is bound
round the chin to close the jaw, and in Arab burial is always left
there, and from where we stood I could see that the jaw dropped when
the bandage was untied, as if, though the wind blew towards us with a
ghastly scent of mortality on it, the muscles were not even now set,
though the man had been dead sixty hours. But still a rank and
burning curiosity to see what this unclean ghoul would do next
stifled all other feelings in my mind. He seemed not to notice, or,
at any rate, to disregard that mouth gaping awry, and moved about
nimbly in the moonlight.</p>

<p>He took from a pocket of his clothes, which were lying near, two
small black objects, which now are safely embedded in the mud at the
bottom of the Nile, and rubbed them briskly together.</p>

<p>By degrees they grew luminous with a sickly yellow pallor of
light, and from his hands went up a wavy, phosphorescent flame. One
of these cubes he placed in the open mouth of the corpse, the other
in his own, and, taking the dead man closely in his arms as though he
would indeed dance with death, he breathed long breaths from his
mouth into that dead cavern which was pressed to his. Suddenly he
started back with a quick-drawn breath of wonder and perhaps of
horror, and stood for a space as if irresolute, for the cube which
the dead man held instead of lying loosely in the jaw was pressed
tight between clenched teeth. After a moment of irresolution he
stepped back quickly to his clothes again, and took up from near them
the knife with which he had stripped off the coffin lid, and holding
this in one hand behind his back, with the other he took out the cube
from the dead man's mouth, though with a visible exhibition of force,
and spoke.</p>

<p>"Abdul," he said, "I am your friend, and I swear I will give your
money to Mohamed, if you will tell me where it is."</p>

<p>Certain I am that the lips of the dead moved, and the eyelids
fluttered for a moment like the wings of a wounded bird, but at that
sight the horror so grew on me that I was physically incapable of
stifling the cry that rose to my lips, and Achmet turned round. Next
moment the complete Spirit of Black Magic glided out of the shade of
the trees, and stood before him. The wretched man stood for a moment
without stirring, then, turning with shaking knees to flee, he
stepped back and fell into the grave he had just opened.</p>

<p>Weston turned on me angrily, dropping the eyes and the teeth of
the Afrit.</p>

<p>"You spoiled it all," he cried. "It would perhaps have been the
most interesting..." and his eye lighted on the dead Abdul, who
peered open-eyed from the coffin, then swayed, tottered, and fell
forward, face downwards on the ground close to him. For one moment he
lay there, and then the body rolled slowly on to its back without
visible cause of movement, and lay staring into the sky. The face was
covered with dust, but with the dust was mingled fresh blood. A nail
had caught the cloth that wound him, underneath which, as usual, were
the clothes in which he had died, for the Arabs do not wash their
dead, and it had torn a great rent through them all, leaving the
right shoulder bare.</p>

<p>Weston strove to speak once, but failed. Then:</p>

<p>"I will go and inform the police," he said, "if you will stop
here, and see that Achmet does not get out."</p>

<p>But this I altogether refused to do, and, after covering the body
with the coffin to protect it from the hawks, we secured Achmet's
arms with the rope he had already used that night, and took him off
to Luxor.</p>

<p>Next morning Mohamed came to see us.</p>

<p>"I thought Achmet knew where the money was," he said
exultantly.</p>

<p>"Where was it?"</p>

<p>"In a little purse tied round the shoulder. The dog had already
begun stripping it. See"--and he brought it out of his pocket--"it
is all there in those English notes, five pounds each, and there are
twenty of them."</p>

<p>Our conclusion was slightly different, for even Weston will allow
that Achmet hoped to learn from dead lips the secret of the treasure,
and then to kill the man anew and bury him. But that is pure
conjecture.</p>

<p>The only other point of interest lies in the two black cubes which
we picked up, and found to be graven with curious characters. These I
put one evening into Machmout's hand, when he was exhibiting to us
his curious powers of "thought transference." The effect was that he
screamed aloud, crying out that the Black Magic had come, and though
I did not feel certain about that, I thought they would be safer in
mid-Nile. Weston grumbled a little, and said that he had wanted to
take them to the British Museum, but that I feel sure was an
afterthought.</p>

<h2><a name="ch03"></a>Mrs. Amworth</h2>

<p>The village of Maxley, where, last summer and autumn, these
strange events took place, lies on a heathery and pine-clad upland of
Sussex. In all England you could not find a sweeter and saner
situation. Should the wind blow from the south, it comes laden with
the spices of the sea; to the east high downs protect it from the
inclemencies of March; and from the west and north the breezes which
reach it travel over miles of aromatic forest and heather. The
village itself is insignificant enough in point of population, but
rich in amenities and beauty. Half-way down the single street, with
its broad road and spacious areas of grass on each side, stands the
little Norman Church and the antique graveyard long disused: for the
rest there are a dozen small, sedate Georgian houses, red-bricked and
long-windowed, each with a square of flower-garden in front, and an
ampler strip behind; a score of shops, and a couple of score of
thatched cottages belonging to labourers on neighbouring estates,
complete the entire cluster of its peaceful habitations. The general
peace, however, is sadly broken on Saturdays and Sundays, for we lie
on one of the main roads between London and Brighton and our quiet
street becomes a race-course for flying motor-cars and bicycles.</p>

<p>A notice just outside the village begging them to go slowly only
seems to encourage them to accelerate their speed, for the road lies
open and straight, and there is really no reason why they should do
otherwise. By way of protest, therefore, the ladies of Maxley cover
their noses and mouths with their handkerchiefs as they see a
motor-car approaching, though, as the street is asphalted, they need
not really take these precautions against dust. But late on Sunday
night the horde of scorchers has passed, and we settle down again to
five days of cheerful and leisurely seclusion. Railway strikes which
agitate the country so much leave us undisturbed because most of the
inhabitants of Maxley never leave it at all.</p>

<p>I am the fortunate possessor of one of these small Georgian
houses, and consider myself no less fortunate in having so
interesting and stimulating a neighbour as Francis Urcombe, who, the
most confirmed of Maxleyites, has not slept away from his house,
which stands just opposite to mine in the village street, for nearly
two years, at which date, though still in middle life, he resigned
his Physiological Professorship at Cambridge University and devoted
himself to the study of those occult and curious phenomena which seem
equally to concern the physical and the psychical sides of human
nature. Indeed his retirement was not unconnected with his passion
for the strange uncharted places that lie on the confines and borders
of science, the existence of which is so stoutly denied by the more
materialistic minds, for he advocated that all medical students
should be obliged to pass some sort of examination in mesmerism, and
that one of the tripos papers should be designed to test their
knowledge in such subjects as appearances at time of death, haunted
houses, vampirism, automatic writing, and possession.</p>

<p>"Of course they wouldn't listen to me," ran his account of the
matter, "for there is nothing that these seats of learning are so
frightened of as knowledge, and the road to knowledge lies in the
study of things like these. The functions of the human frame are,
broadly speaking, known.</p>

<p>"They are a country, anyhow, that has been charted and mapped out.
But outside that lie huge tracts of undiscovered country, which
certainly exist, and the real pioneers of knowledge are those who, at
the cost of being derided as credulous and superstitious, want to
push on into those misty and probably perilous places. I felt that I
could be of more use by setting out without compass or knapsack into
the mists than by sitting in a cage like a canary and chirping about
what was known. Besides, teaching is very bad for a man who knows
himself only to be a learner: you only need to be a self-conceited
ass to teach."</p>

<p>Here, then, in Francis Urcombe, was a delightful neighbour to one
who, like myself, has an uneasy and burning curiosity about what he
called the "misty and perilous places"; and this last spring we had a
further and most welcome addition to our pleasant little community,
in the person of Mrs. Amworth, widow of an Indian civil servant. Her
husband had been a judge in the North-West Provinces, and after his
death at Peshawar she came back to England, and after a year in
London found herself starving for the ampler air and sunshine of the
country to take the place of the fogs and griminess of town. She had,
too, a special reason for settling in Maxley, since her ancestors up
till a hundred years ago had long been native to the place, and in
the old churchyard, now disused, are many gravestones bearing her
maiden name of Chaston. Big and energetic, her vigorous and genial
personality speedily woke Maxley up to a higher degree of sociality
than it had ever known. Most of us were bachelors or spinsters or
elderly folk not much inclined to exert ourselves in the expense and
effort of hospitality, and hitherto the gaiety of a small tea-party,
with bridge afterwards and goloshes (when it was wet) to trip home in
again for a solitary dinner, was about the climax of our festivities.
But Mrs. Amworth showed us a more gregarious way, and set an example
of luncheon-parties and little dinners, which we began to follow. On
other nights when no such hospitality was on foot, a lone man like
myself found it pleasant to know that a call on the telephone to Mrs.
Amworth's house not a hundred yards off, and an inquiry as to whether
I might come over after dinner for a game of piquet before bed-time,
would probably evoke a response of welcome. There she would be, with
a comrade-like eagerness for companionship, and there was a glass of
port and a cup of coffee and a cigarette and a game of piquet. She
played the piano, too, in a free and exuberant manner, and had a
charming voice and sang to her own accompaniment; and as the days
grew long and the light lingered late, we played our game in her
garden, which in the course of a few months she had turned from being
a nursery for slugs and snails into a glowing patch of luxuriant
blossoming.</p>

<p>She was always cheery and jolly; she was interested in everything,
and in music, in gardening, in games of all sorts was a competent
performer. Everybody (with one exception) liked her, everybody felt
her to bring with her the tonic of a sunny day. That one exception
was Francis Urcombe; he, though he confessed he did not like her,
acknowledged that he was vastly interested in her. This always seemed
strange to me, for pleasant and jovial as she was, I could see
nothing in her that could call forth conjecture or intrigued surmise,
so healthy and unmysterious a figure did she present. But of the
genuineness of Urcombe's interest there could be no doubt; one could
see him watching and scrutinising her. In matter of age, she frankly
volunteered the information that she was forty-five; but her
briskness, her activity, her unravaged skin, her coal-black hair,
made it difficult to believe that she was not adopting an unusual
device, and adding ten years on to her age instead of subtracting
them.</p>

<p>Often, also, as our quite unsentimental friendship ripened, Mrs.
Amworth would ring me up and propose her advent. If I was busy
writing, I was to give her, so we definitely bargained, a frank
negative, and in answer I could hear her jolly laugh and her wishes
for a successful evening of work. Sometimes, before her proposal
arrived, Urcombe would already have stepped across from his house
opposite for a smoke and a chat, and he, hearing who my intending
visitor was, always urged me to beg her to come. She and I should
play our piquet, said he, and he would look on, if we did not object,
and learn something of the game. But I doubt whether he paid much
attention to it, for nothing could be clearer than that, under that
penthouse of forehead and thick eyebrows, his attention was fixed not
on the cards, but on one of the players. But he seemed to enjoy an
hour spent thus, and often, until one particular evening in July, he
would watch her with the air of a man who has some deep problem in
front of him. She, enthusiastically keen about our game, seemed not
to notice his scrutiny. Then came that evening, when, as I see in the
light of subsequent events, began the first twitching of the veil
that hid the secret horror from my eyes. I did not know it then,
though I noticed that thereafter, if she rang up to propose coming
round, she always asked not only if I was at leisure, but whether Mr.
Urcombe was with me. If so, she said, she would not spoil the chat of
two old bachelors, and laughingly wished me good night.</p>

<p>Urcombe, on this occasion, had been with me for some half-hour
before Mrs. Amworth's appearance, and had been talking to me about
the medieval beliefs concerning vampirism, one of those borderland
subjects which he declared had not been sufficiently studied before
it had been consigned by the medical profession to the dust-heap of
exploded superstitions. There he sat, grim and eager, tracing, with
that pellucid clearness which had made him in his Cambridge days so
admirable a lecturer, the history of those mysterious visitations. In
them all there were the same general features: one of those ghoulish
spirits took up its abode in a living man or woman, conferring
supernatural powers of bat-like flight and glutting itself with
nocturnal blood-feasts.</p>

<p>When its host died it continued to dwell in the corpse, which
remained undecayed. By day it rested, by night it left the grave and
went on its awful errands. No European country in the Middle Ages
seemed to have escaped them; earlier yet, parallels were to be found,
in Roman and Greek and in Jewish history.</p>

<p>"It's a large order to set all that evidence aside as being
moonshine," he said. "Hundreds of totally independent witnesses in
many ages have testified to the occurrence of these phenomena, and
there's no explanation known to me which covers all the facts. And if
you feel inclined to say 'Why, then, if these are facts, do we not
come across them now?' there are two answers I can make you. One is
that there were diseases known in the Middle Ages, such as the black
death; which were certainly existent then and which have become
extinct since, but for that reason we do not assert that such
diseases never existed. Just as the black death visited England and
decimated the population of Norfolk, so here in this very district
about three hundred years ago there was certainly an outbreak of
vampirism, and Maxley was the centre of it. My second answer is even
more convincing, for I tell you that vampirism is by no means extinct
now. An outbreak of it certainly occurred in India a year or two
ago."</p>

<p>At that moment I heard my knocker plied in the cheerful and
peremptory manner in which Mrs. Amworth is accustomed to announce her
arrival, and I went to the door to open it.</p>

<p>"Come in at once," I said, "and save me from having my blood
curdled. Mr. Urcombe has been trying to alarm me."</p>

<p>Instantly her vital, voluminous presence seemed to fill the
room.</p>

<p>"Ah, but how lovely!" she said. "I delight in having my blood
curdled. Go on with your ghost-story, Mr. Urcombe. I adore
ghost-stories."</p>

<p>I saw that, as his habit was, he was intently observing her.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a ghost-story exactly," said he. "I was only telling
our host how vampirism was not extinct yet. I was saying that there
was an outbreak of it in India only a few years ago."</p>

<p>There was a more than perceptible pause, and I saw that, if
Urcombe was observing her, she on her side was observing him with
fixed eye and parted mouth. Then her jolly laugh invaded that rather
tense silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a shame!" she said. "You're not going to curdle my blood
at all. Where did you pick up such a tale, Mr. Urcombe? I have lived
for years in India and never heard a rumour of such a thing. Some
story-teller in the bazaars must have invented it: they are famous at
that."</p>

<p>I could see that Urcombe was on the point of saying something
further, but checked himself.</p>

<p>"Ah! very likely that was it," he said.</p>

<p>But something had disturbed our usual peaceful sociability that
night, and something had damped Mrs. Amworth's usual high spirits.
She had no gusto for her piquet, and left after a couple of games.
Urcombe had been silent too, indeed he hardly spoke again till she
departed.</p>

<p>"That was unfortunate," he said, "for the outbreak of--of a very
mysterious disease, let us call it, took place at Peshawar, where she
and her husband were. And--"</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He was one of the victims of it," said he. "Naturally I had quite
forgotten that when I spoke."</p>

<p>The summer was unreasonably hot and rainless, and Maxley suffered
much from drought, and also from a plague of big black night-flying
gnats, the bite of which was very irritating and virulent. They came
sailing in of an evening, settling on one's skin so quietly that one
perceived nothing till the sharp stab announced that one had been
bitten. They did not bite the hands or face, but chose always the
neck and throat for their feeding-ground, and most of us, as the
poison spread, assumed a temporary goitre. Then about the middle of
August appeared the first of those mysterious cases of illness which
our local doctor attributed to the long-continued heat coupled with
the bite of these venomous insects. The patient was a boy of sixteen
or seventeen, the son of Mrs. Amworth's gardener, and the symptoms
were an anemic pallor and a languid prostration, accompanied by great
drowsiness and an abnormal appetite. He had, too, on his throat two
small punctures where, so Dr. Ross conjectured, one of these great
gnats had bitten him. But the odd thing was that there was no
swelling or inflammation round the place where he had been
bitten.</p>

<p>The heat at this time had begun to abate, but the cooler weather
failed to restore him, and the boy, in spite of the quantity of good
food which he so ravenously swallowed, wasted away to a skin-clad
skeleton.</p>

<p>I met Dr. Ross in the street one afternoon about this time, and in
answer to my inquiries about his patient he said that he was afraid
the boy was dying. The case, he confessed, completely puzzled him:
some obscure form of pernicious anemia was all he could suggest. But
he wondered whether Mr. Urcombe would consent to see the boy, on the
chance of his being able to throw some new light on the case, and
since Urcombe was dining with me that night, I proposed to Dr. Ross
to join us. He could not do this, but said he would look in later.
When he came, Urcombe at once consented to put his skill at the
other's disposal, and together they went off at once. Being thus
shorn of my sociable evening, I telephoned to Mrs. Amworth to know if
I might inflict myself on her for an hour. Her answer was a welcoming
affirmative, and between piquet and music the hour lengthened itself
into two. She spoke of the boy who was lying so desperately and
mysteriously ill, and told me that she had often been to see him,
taking him nourishing and delicate food. But to-day--and her kind
eyes moistened as she spoke she was afraid she had paid her last
visit. Knowing the antipathy between her and Urcombe, I did not tell
her that he had been called into consultation; and when I returned
home she accompanied me to my door, for the sake of a breath of night
air, and in order to borrow a magazine which contained an article on
gardening which she wished to read.</p>

<p>"Ah, this delicious night air," she said, luxuriously sniffing in
the coolness. "Night air and gardening are the great tonics. There is
nothing so stimulating as bare contact with rich mother earth. You
are never so fresh as when you have been grubbing in the soil--black
hands, black nails, and boots covered with mud." She gave her great
jovial laugh. "I'm a glutton for air and earth," she said.
"Positively I look forward to death, for then I shall be buried and
have the kind earth all round me. No leaden caskets for me--I have
given explicit directions. But what shall I do about air? Well, I
suppose one can't have everything. The magazine? A thousand thanks, I
will faithfully return it. Good night: garden and keep your windows
open, and you won't have anemia."</p>

<p>"I always sleep with my windows open," said I.</p>

<p>I went straight up to my bedroom, of which one of the windows
looks out over the street, and as I undressed I thought I heard
voices talking outside not far away. But I paid no particular
attention, put out my lights, and falling asleep plunged into the
depths of a most horrible dream, distortedly suggested no doubt, by
my last words with Mrs. Amworth. I dreamed that I woke, and found
that both my bedroom windows were shut. Half-suffocating I dreamed
that I sprang out of bed, and went across to open them. The blind
over the first was drawn down, and pulling it up I saw, with the
indescribable horror of incipient nightmare, Mrs. Amworth's face
suspended close to the pane in the darkness outside, nodding and
smiling at me. Pulling down the blind again to keep that terror out,
I rushed to the second window on the other side of the room, and
there again was Mrs. Amworth's face. Then the panic came upon me in
full blast; here was I suffocating in the airless room, and whichever
window I opened Mrs. Amworth's face would float in, like those
noiseless black gnats that bit before one was aware. The nightmare
rose to screaming point, and with strangled yells I awoke to find my
room cool and quiet with both windows open and blinds up and a
half-moon high in its course, casting an oblong of tranquil light on
the floor. But even when I was awake the horror persisted, and I lay
tossing and turning.</p>

<p>I must have slept long before the nightmare seized me, for now it
was nearly day, and soon in the east the drowsy eyelids of morning
began to lift.</p>

<p>I was scarcely downstairs next morning--for after the dawn I slept
late--when Urcombe rang up to know if he might see me immediately. He
came in, grim and preoccupied, and I noticed that he was pulling on a
pipe that was not even filled.</p>

<p>"I want your help," he said, "and so I must tell you first of all
what happened last night. I went round with the little doctor to see
his patient, and found him just alive, but scarcely more. I instantly
diagnosed in my own mind what this anemia, unaccountable by any other
explanation, meant. The boy is the prey of a vampire."</p>

<p>He put his empty pipe on the breakfast-table, by which I had just
sat down, and folded his arms, looking at me steadily from under his
overhanging brows.</p>

<p>"Now about last night," he said. "I insisted that he should be
moved from his father's cottage into my house. As we were carrying
him on a stretcher, whom should we meet but Mrs. Amworth? She
expressed shocked surprise that we were moving him. Now why do you
think she did that?"</p>

<p>With a start of horror, as I remembered my dream that night
before, I felt an idea come into my mind so preposterous and
unthinkable that I instantly turned it out again.</p>

<p>"I haven't the smallest idea," I said.</p>

<p>"Then listen, while I tell you about what happened later. I put
out all light in the room where the boy lay, and watched. One window
was a little open, for I had forgotten to close it, and about
midnight I heard something outside, trying apparently to push it
farther open. I guessed who it was--yes, it was full twenty feet from
the ground--and I peeped round the corner of the blind."</p>

<p>"Just outside was the face of Mrs. Amworth and her hand was on the
frame of the window. Very softly I crept close, and then banged the
window down, and I think I just caught the tip of one of her
fingers."</p>

<p>"But it's impossible," I cried. "How could she be floating in the
air like that? And what had she come for? Don't tell me such--"</p>

<p>Once more, with closer grip, the remembrance of my nightmare
seized me.</p>

<p>"I am telling you what I saw," said he. "And all night long, until
it was nearly day, she was fluttering outside, like some terrible
bat, trying to gain admittance. Now put together various things I
have told you."</p>

<p>He began checking them off on his fingers.</p>

<p>"Number one," he said: "there was an outbreak of disease similar
to that which this boy is suffering from at Peshawar, and her husband
died of it. Number two: Mrs. Amworth protested against my moving the
boy to my house. Number three: she, or the demon that inhabits her
body, a creature powerful and deadly, tries to gain admittance. And
add this, too: in medieval times there was an epidemic of vampirism
here at Maxley. The vampire, so the accounts run, was found to be
Elizabeth Chaston...I see you remember Mrs. Amworth's maiden name.
Finally, the boy is stronger this morning. He would certainly not
have been alive if he had been visited again."</p>

<p>"And what do you make of it?"</p>

<p>There was a long silence, during which I found this incredible
horror assuming the hues of reality.</p>

<p>"I have something to add," I said, "which may or may not bear on
it. You say that the--the spectre went away shortly before dawn."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I told him of my dream, and he smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Yes, you did well to awake," he said. "That warning came from
your subconscious self, which never wholly slumbers, and cried out to
you of deadly danger. For two reasons, then, you must help me: one to
save others, the second to save yourself."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I want you first of all to help me in watching this boy, and
ensuring that she does not come near him. Eventually I want you to
help me in tracking the thing down, in exposing and destroying it. It
is not human: it is an incarnate fiend. What steps we shall have to
take I don't yet know."</p>

<p>It was now eleven of the forenoon, and presently I went across to
his house for a twelve-hour vigil while he slept, to come on duty
again that night, so that for the next twenty-four hours either
Urcombe or myself was always in the room where the boy, now getting
stronger every hour, was lying. The day following was Saturday and a
morning of brilliant, pellucid weather, and already when I went
across to his house to resume my duty the stream of motors down to
Brighton had begun. Simultaneously I saw Urcombe with a cheerful
face, which boded good news of his patient, coming out of his house,
and Mrs. Amworth, with a gesture of salutation to me and a basket in
her hand, walking up the broad strip of grass which bordered the
road. There we all three met. I noticed (and saw that Urcombe noticed
it too) that one finger of her left hand was bandaged.</p>

<p>"Good morning to you both," said she. "And I hear your patient is
doing well, Mr. Urcombe. I have come to bring him a bowl of jelly,
and to sit with him for an hour. He and I are great friends. I am
overjoyed at his recovery."</p>

<p>Urcombe paused a moment, as if making up his mind, and then shot
out a pointing finger at her.</p>

<p>"I forbid that," he said. "You shall not sit with him or see him.
And you know the reason as well as I do."</p>

<p>I have never seen so horrible a change pass over a human face as
that which now blanched hers to the colour of a grey mist. She put up
her hand as if to shield herself from that pointing finger, which
drew the sign of the cross in the air, and shrank back cowering on to
the road.</p>

<p>There was a wild hoot from a horn, a grinding of brakes, a
shout--too late--from a passing car, and one long scream suddenly cut
short. Her body rebounded from the roadway after the first wheel had
gone over it, and the second followed. It lay there, quivering and
twitching, and was still.</p>

<p>She was buried three days afterwards in the cemetery outside
Maxley, in accordance with the wishes she had told me that she had
devised about her interment, and the shock which her sudden and awful
death had caused to the little community began by degrees to pass
off. To two people only, Urcombe and myself, the horror of it was
mitigated from the first by the nature of the relief that her death
brought; but, naturally enough, we kept our own counsel, and no hint
of what greater horror had been thus averted was ever let slip. But,
oddly enough, so it seemed to me, he was still not satisfied about
something in connection with her, and would give no answer to my
questions on the subject. Then as the days of a tranquil mellow
September and the October that followed began to drop away like the
leaves of the yellowing trees, his uneasiness relaxed. But before the
entry of November the seeming tranquillity broke into hurricane.</p>

<p>I had been dining one night at the far end of the village, and
about eleven o'clock was walking home again. The moon was of an
unusual brilliance, rendering all that it shone on as distinct as in
some etching. I had just come opposite the house which Mrs. Amworth
had occupied, where there was a board up telling that it was to let,
when I heard the click of her front gate, and next moment I saw, with
a sudden chill and quaking of my very spirit, that she stood there.
Her profile, vividly illuminated, was turned to me, and I could not
be mistaken in my identification of her. She appeared not to see me
(indeed the shadow of the yew hedge in front of her garden enveloped
me in its blackness) and she went swiftly across the road, and
entered the gate of the house directly opposite. There I lost sight
of her completely.</p>

<p>My breath was coming in short pants as if I had been running--and
now indeed I ran, with fearful backward glances, along the hundred
yards that separated me from my house and Urcombe's. It was to his
that my flying steps took me, and next minute I was within.</p>

<p>"What have you come to tell me?" he asked. "Or shall I guess?"

<p>"You can't guess," said I.</p>

<p>"No; it's no guess. She has come back and you have seen her. Tell
me about it."</p>

<p>I gave him my story.</p>

<p>"That's Major Pearsall's house," he said. "Come back with me there
at once."</p>

<p>"But what can we do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I've no idea. That's what we have got to find out."</p>

<p>A minute later, we were opposite the house. When I had passed it
before, it was all dark; now lights gleamed from a couple of windows
upstairs. Even as we faced it, the front door opened, and next moment
Major Pearsall emerged from the gate. He saw us and stopped.</p>

<p>"I'm on my way to Dr. Ross," he said quickly, "My wife has been
taken suddenly ill. She had been in bed an hour when I came upstairs,
and I found her white as a ghost and utterly exhausted. She had been
to sleep, it seemed--but you will excuse me."</p>

<p>"One moment, Major," said Urcombe. "Was there any mark on her
throat?"</p>

<p>"How did you guess that?" said he. "There was: one of those
beastly gnats must have bitten her twice there. She was streaming
with blood."</p>

<p>"And there's someone with her?" asked Urcombe.</p>

<p>"Yes, I roused her maid."</p>

<p>He went off, and Urcombe turned to me. "I know now what we have to
do," he said. "Change your clothes, and I'll join you at your
house."</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you on our way. We're going to the cemetery."</p>

<p>He carried a pick, a shovel, and a screw-driver when he rejoined
me, and wore round his shoulders a long coil of rope. As we walked,
he gave me the outlines of the ghastly hour that lay before us.</p>

<p>"What I have to tell you," he said, "will seem to you now too
fantastic for credence, but before dawn we shall see whether it
outstrips reality. By a most fortunate happening, you saw the
spectre, the astral body, whatever you choose to call it, of Mrs.
Amworth, going on its grisly business, and therefore, beyond doubt,
the vampire spirit which abode in her during life animates her again
in death. That is not exceptional--indeed, all these weeks since her
death I have been expecting it. If I am right, we shall find her body
undecayed and untouched by corruption."</p>

<p>"But she has been dead nearly two months," said I.</p>

<p>"If she had been dead two years it would still be so, if the
vampire has possession of her. So remember: whatever you see done, it
will be done not to her, who in the natural course would now be
feeding the grasses above her grave, but to a spirit of untold evil
and malignancy, which gives a phantom life to her body."</p>

<p>"But what shall I see done?" said I.</p>

<p>"I will tell you. We know that now, at this moment, the vampire
clad in her mortal semblance is out; dining out. But it must get back
before dawn, and it will pass into the material form that lies in her
grave. We must wait for that, and then with your help I shall dig up
her body. If I am right, you will look on her as she was in life,
with the full vigour of the dreadful nutriment she has received
pulsing in her veins. And then, when dawn has come, and the vampire
cannot leave the lair of her body, I shall strike her with this"--and
he pointed to his pick--"through the heart, and she, who comes to
life again only with the animation the fiend gives her, she and her
hellish partner will be dead indeed. Then we must bury her again,
delivered at last."</p>

<p>We had come to the cemetery, and in the brightness of the
moonshine there was no difficulty in identifying her grave. It lay
some twenty yards from the small chapel, in the porch of which,
obscured by shadow, we concealed ourselves. From there we had a clear
and open sight of the grave, and now we must wait till its infernal
visitor returned home. The night was warm and windless, yet even if a
freezing wind had been raging I think I should have felt nothing of
it, so intense was my preoccupation as to what the night and dawn
would bring. There was a bell in the turret of the chapel, that
struck the quarters of the hour, and it amazed me to find how swiftly
the chimes succeeded one another.</p>

<p>The moon had long set, but a twilight of stars shone in a clear
sky, when five o'clock of the morning sounded from the turret. A few
minutes more passed, and then I felt Urcombe's hand softly nudging
me; and looking out in the direction of his pointing finger, I saw
that the form of a woman, tall and large in build, was approaching
from the right. Noiselessly, with a motion more of gliding and
floating than walking, she moved across the cemetery to the grave
which was the centre of our observation. She moved round it as if to
be certain of its identity, and for a moment stood directly facing
us. In the greyness to which now my eyes had grown accustomed, I
could easily see her face, and recognise its features.</p>

<p>She drew her hand across her mouth as if wiping it, and broke into
a chuckle of such laughter as made my hair stir on my head. Then she
leaped on to the grave, holding her hands high above her head, and
inch by inch disappeared into the earth. Urcombe's hand was laid on
my arm, in an injunction to keep still, but now he removed it.</p>

<p>"Come," he said.</p>

<p>With pick and shovel and rope we went to the grave. The earth was
light and sandy, and soon after six struck, we had delved down to the
coffin lid. With his pick he loosened the earth round it, and,
adjusting the rope through the handles by which it had been lowered,
we tried to raise it.</p>

<p>This was a long and laborious business, and the light had begun to
herald day in the east before we had it out, and lying by the side of
the grave. With his screw-driver he loosed the fastenings of the lid,
and slid it aside, and standing there we looked on the face of Mrs.
Amworth. The eyes, once closed in death, were open, the cheeks were
flushed with colour, the red, full-lipped mouth seemed to smile.</p>

<p>"One blow and it is all over," he said. "You need not look."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he took up the pick again, and, laying the point
of it on her left breast, measured his distance. And though I knew
what was coming I could not look away...</p>

<p>He grasped the pick in both hands, raised it an inch or two for
the taking of his aim, and then with full force brought it down on
her breast. A fountain of blood, though she had been dead so long,
spouted high in the air, falling with the thud of a heavy splash over
the shroud, and simultaneously from those red lips came one long,
appalling cry, swelling up like some hooting siren, and dying away
again. With that, instantaneous as a lightning flash, came the touch
of corruption on her face, the colour of it faded to ash, the plump
cheeks fell in, the mouth dropped.</p>

<p>"Thank God, that's over," said he, and without pause slipped the
coffin lid back into its place.</p>

<p>Day was coming fast now, and, working like men possessed, we
lowered the coffin into its place again, and shovelled the earth over
it...The birds were busy with their earliest pipings as we went back
to Maxley.</p>

<h2><a name="ch04"></a>Between the Lights</h2>

<p>The day had been one unceasing fall of snow from sunrise until the
gradual withdrawal of the vague white light outside indicated that
the sun had set again. But as usual at this hospitable and delightful
house of Everard Chandler where I often spent Christmas, and was
spending it now, there had been no lack of entertainment, and the
hours had passed with a rapidity that had surprised us. A short
billiard tournament had filled up the time between breakfast and
lunch, with Badminton and the morning papers for those who were
temporarily not engaged, while afterwards, the interval till tea-time
had been occupied by the majority of the party in a huge game of
hide-and-seek all over the house, barring the billiard-room, which
was sanctuary for any who desired peace. But few had done that; the
enchantment of Christmas, I must suppose, had, like some spell, made
children of us again, and it was with palsied terror and trembling
misgivings that we had tip-toed up and down the dim passages, from
any corner of which some wild screaming form might dart out on us.
Then, wearied with exercise and emotion, we had assembled again for
tea in the hall, a room of shadows and panels on which the light from
the wide open fireplace, where there burned a divine mixture of peat
and logs, flickered and grew bright again on the walls. Then, as was
proper, ghost-stories, for the narration of which the electric light
was put out, so that the listeners might conjecture anything they
pleased to be lurking in the corners, succeeded, and we vied with
each other in blood, bones, skeletons, armour and shrieks. I had,
just given my contribution, and was reflecting with some complacency
that probably the worst was now known, when Everard, who had not yet
administered to the horror of his guests, spoke. He was sitting
opposite me in the full blaze of the fire, looking, after the illness
he had gone through during the autumn, still rather pale and
delicate. All the same he had been among the boldest and best in the
exploration of dark places that afternoon, and the look on his face
now rather startled me.</p>

<p>"No, I don't mind that sort of thing," he said. "The paraphernalia
of ghosts has become somehow rather hackneyed, and when I hear of
screams and skeletons I feel I am on familiar ground, and can at
least hide my head under the bed-clothes."</p>

<p>"Ah, but the bed-clothes were twitched away by my skeleton," said
I, in self-defence.</p>

<p>"I know, but I don't even mind that. Why, there are seven, eight
skeletons in this room now, covered with blood and skin and other
horrors. No, the nightmares of one's childhood were the really
frightening things, because they were vague. There was the true
atmosphere of horror about them because one didn't know what one
feared. Now if one could recapture that--"</p>

<p>Mrs. Chandler got quickly out of her seat.</p>

<p>"Oh, Everard," she said, "surely you don't wish to recapture it
again. I should have thought once was enough."</p>

<p>This was enchanting. A chorus of invitation asked him to proceed:
the real true ghost-story first-hand, which was what seemed to be
indicated, was too precious a thing to lose.</p>

<p>Everard laughed. "No, dear, I don't want to recapture it again at
all," he said to his wife.</p>

<p>Then to us: "But really the--well, the nightmare perhaps, to which
I was referring, is of the vaguest and most unsatisfactory kind. It
has no apparatus about it at all. You will probably all say that it
was nothing, and wonder why I was frightened. But I was; it
frightened me out of my wits. And I only just saw something, without
being able to swear what it was, and heard something which might have
been a falling stone."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, tell us about the falling stone," said I.</p>

<p>There was a stir of movement about the circle round the fire, and
the movement was not of purely physical order. It was as if--this is
only what I personally felt--it was as if the childish gaiety of the
hours we had passed that day was suddenly withdrawn; we had jested on
certain subjects, we had played hide-and-seek with all the power of
earnestness that was in us. But now--so it seemed to me--there was
going to be real hide-and-seek, real terrors were going to lurk in
dark corners, or if not real terrors, terrors so convincing as to
assume the garb of reality, were going to pounce on us. And Mrs.
Chandler's exclamation as she sat down again, "Oh, Everard, won't it
excite you?" tended in any case to excite us. The room still remained
in dubious darkness except for the sudden lights disclosed on the
walls by the leaping flames on the hearth, and there was wide field
for conjecture as to what might lurk in the dim corners. Everard,
moreover, who had been sitting in bright light before, was banished
by the extinction of some flaming log into the shadows. A voice alone
spoke to us, as he sat back in his low chair, a voice rather slow but
very distinct.</p>

<p>"Last year," he said, "on the twenty-fourth of December, we were
down here, as usual, Amy and I, for Christmas. Several of you who are
here now were here then. Three or four of you at least."</p>

<p>I was one of these, but like the others kept silence, for the
identification, so it seemed to me, was not asked for. And he went on
again without a pause.</p>

<p>"Those of you who were here then," he said, "and are here now,
will remember how very warm it was this day year. You will remember,
too, that we played croquet that day on the lawn. It was perhaps a
little cold for croquet, and we played it rather in order to be able
to say--with sound evidence to back the statement--that we had done
so."</p>

<p>Then he turned and addressed the whole little circle.</p>

<p>"We played ties of half-games," he said, "just as we have played
billiards to-day, and it was certainly as warm on the lawn then as it
was in the billiard-room this morning directly after breakfast, while
to-day I should not wonder if there was three feet of snow outside.
More, probably; listen."</p>

<p>A sudden draught fluted in the chimney, and the fire flared up as
the current of air caught it.</p>

<p>The wind also drove the snow against the windows, and as he said,
"Listen," we heard a soft scurry of the falling flakes against the
panes, like the soft tread of many little people who stepped lightly,
but with the persistence of multitudes who were flocking to some
rendezvous. Hundreds of little feet seemed to be gathering outside;
only the glass kept them out. And of the eight skeletons present four
or five, anyhow, turned and looked at the windows. These were
small-paned, with leaden bars. On the leaden bars little heaps of
snow had accumulated, but there was nothing else to be seen.</p>

<p>"Yes, last Christmas Eve was very warm and sunny," went on
Everard. "We had had no frost that autumn, and a temerarious dahlia
was still in flower. I have always thought that it must have been
mad."</p>

<p>He paused a moment.</p>

<p>"And I wonder if I were not mad too," he added.</p>

<p>No one interrupted him; there was something arresting, I must
suppose, in what he was saying; it chimed in anyhow with the
hide-and-seek, with the suggestions of the lonely snow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chandler had sat down again, but I heard her stir in her
chair. But never was there a gay party so reduced as we had been in
the last five minutes. Instead of laughing at ourselves for playing
silly games, we were all taking a serious game seriously.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I was sitting out," he said to me, "while you and my wife
played your half-game of croquet. Then it struck me that it was not
so warm as I had supposed, because quite suddenly I shivered. And
shivering I looked up. But I did not see you and her playing croquet
at all. I saw something which had no relation to you and her--at
least I hope not."</p>

<p>Now the angler lands his fish, the stalker kills his stag, and the
speaker holds his audience.</p>

<p>And as the fish is gaffed, and as the stag is shot, so were we
held. There was no getting away till he had finished with us.</p>

<p>"You all know the croquet lawn," he said, "and how it is bounded
all round by a flower border with a brick wall behind it, through
which, you will remember, there is only one gate.</p>

<p>"Well, I looked up and saw that the lawn--I could for one moment
see it was still a lawn--was shrinking, and the walls closing in upon
it. As they closed in too, they grew higher, and simultaneously the
light began to fade and be sucked from the sky, till it grew quite
dark overhead and only a glimmer of light came in through the
gate.</p>

<p>"There was, as I told you, a dahlia in flower that day, and as
this dreadful darkness and bewilderment came over me, I remember that
my eyes sought it in a kind of despair, holding on, as it were, to
any familiar object. But it was no longer a dahlia, and for the red
of its petals I saw only the red of some feeble firelight. And at
that moment the hallucination was complete. I was no longer sitting
on the lawn watching croquet, but I was in a low-roofed room,
something like a cattle-shed, but round. Close above my head, though
I was sitting down, ran rafters from wall to wall. It was nearly
dark, but a little light came in from the door opposite to me, which
seemed to lead into a passage that communicated with the exterior of
the place. Little, however, of the wholesome air came into this
dreadful den; the atmosphere was oppressive and foul beyond all
telling, it was as if for years it had been the place of some human
menagerie, and for those years had been uncleaned and unsweetened by
the winds of heaven. Yet that oppressiveness was nothing to the awful
horror of the place from the view of the spirit. Some dreadful
atmosphere of crime and abomination dwelt heavy in it, its denizens,
whoever they were, were scarce human, so it seemed to me, and though
men and women, were akin more to the beasts of the field. And in
addition there was present to me some sense of the weight of years; I
had been taken and thrust down into some epoch of dim antiquity."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and the fire on the hearth leaped up for a
second and then died down again. But in that gleam I saw that all
faces were turned to Everard, and that all wore some look of dreadful
expectancy. Certainly I felt it myself, and waited in a sort of
shrinking horror for what was coming.</p>

<p>"As I told you," he continued, "where there had been that
unseasonable dahlia, there now burned a dim firelight, and my eyes
were drawn there. Shapes were gathered round it; what they were I
could not at first see. Then perhaps my eyes got more accustomed to
the dusk, or the fire burned better, for I perceived that they were
of human form, but very small, for when one rose with a horrible
chattering, to his feet, his head was still some inches off the low
roof. He was dressed in a sort of shirt that came to his knees, but
his arms were bare and covered with hair.</p>

<p>"Then the gesticulation and chattering increased, and I knew that
they were talking about me, for they kept pointing in my direction.
At that my horror suddenly deepened, for I became aware that I was
powerless and could not move hand or foot; a helpless, nightmare
impotence had possession of me. I could not lift a finger or turn my
head. And in the paralysis of that fear I tried to scream, but not a
sound could I utter.</p>

<p>"All this I suppose took place with the instantaneousness of a
dream, for at once, and without transition, the whole thing had
vanished, and I was back on the lawn again, while the stroke for
which my wife was aiming was still unplayed. But my face was dripping
with perspiration, and I was trembling all over.</p>

<p>"Now you may all say that I had fallen asleep, and had a sudden
nightmare. That may be so; but I was conscious of no sense of
sleepiness before, and I was conscious of none afterwards. It was as
if someone had held a book before me, whisked the pages open for a
second and closed them again."</p>

<p>Somebody, I don't know who, got up from his chair with a sudden
movement that made me start, and turned on the electric light. I do
not mind confessing that I was rather glad of this.</p>

<p>Everard laughed.</p>

<p>"Really I feel like Hamlet in the play-scene," he said, "and as if
there was a guilty uncle present. Shall I go on?"</p>

<p>I don't think anyone replied, and he went on.</p>

<p>"Well, let us say for the moment that it was not a dream exactly,
but a hallucination.</p>

<p>"Whichever it was, in any case it haunted me; for months, I think,
it was never quite out of my mind, but lingered somewhere in the dusk
of consciousness, sometimes sleeping quietly, so to speak, but
sometimes stirring in its sleep. It was no good my telling myself
that I was disquieting myself in vain, for it was as if something had
actually entered into my very soul, as if some seed of horror had
been planted there. And as the weeks went on the seed began to
sprout, so that I could no longer even tell myself that that vision
had been a moment's disorderment only. I can't say that it actually
affected my health. I did not, as far as I know, sleep or eat
insufficiently, but morning after morning I used to wake, not
gradually and through pleasant dozings into full consciousness, but
with absolute suddenness, and find myself plunged in an abyss of
despair.</p>

<p>"Often too, eating or drinking, I used to pause and wonder if it
was worth while.</p>

<p>"Eventually, I told two people about my trouble, hoping that
perhaps the mere communication would help matters, hoping also, but
very distantly, that though I could not believe at present that
digestion or the obscurities of the nervous system were at fault, a
doctor by some simple dose might convince me of it. In other words I
told my wife, who laughed at me, and my doctor, who laughed also, and
assured me that my health was quite unnecessarily robust.</p>

<p>"At the same time he suggested that change of air and scene does
wonders for the delusions that exist merely in the imagination. He
also told me, in answer to a direct question, that he would stake his
reputation on the certainty that I was not going mad.</p>

<p>"Well, we went up to London as usual for the season, and though
nothing whatever occurred to remind me in any way of that single
moment on Christmas Eve, the reminding was seen to all right, the
moment itself took care of that, for instead of fading as is the way
of sleeping or waking dreams, it grew every day more vivid, and ate,
so to speak, like some corrosive acid into my mind, etching itself
there. And to London succeeded Scotland.</p>

<p>"I took last year for the first time a small forest up in
Sutherland, called Glen Callan, very remote and wild, but affording
excellent stalking. It was not far from the sea, and the gillies used
always to warn me to carry a compass on the hill, because sea-mists
were liable to come up with frightful rapidity, and there was always
a danger of being caught by one, and of having perhaps to wait hours
till it cleared again. This at first I always used to do, but, as
everyone knows, any precaution that one takes which continues to be
unjustified gets gradually relaxed, and at the end of a few weeks,
since the weather had been uniformly clear, it was natural that, as
often as not, my compass remained at home.</p>

<p>"One day the stalk took me on to a part of my ground that I had
seldom been on before, a very high table-land on the limit of my
forest, which went down very steeply on one side to a loch that lay
below it, and on the other, by gentler gradations, to the river that
came from the loch, six miles below which stood the lodge. The wind
had necessitated our climbing up--or so my stalker had insisted--not
by the easier way, but up the crags from the loch. I had argued the
point with him for it seemed to me that it was impossible that the
deer could get our scent if we went by the more natural path, but he
still held to his opinion; and therefore, since after all this was
his part of the job, I yielded. A dreadful climb we had of it, over
big boulders with deep holes in between, masked by clumps of heather,
so that a wary eye and a prodding stick were necessary for each step
if one wished to avoid broken bones. Adders also literally swarmed in
the heather; we must have seen a dozen at least on our way up, and
adders are a beast for which I have no manner of use. But a couple of
hours saw us to the top, only to find that the stalker had been
utterly at fault, and that the deer must quite infallibly have got
wind of us, if they had remained in the place where we last saw them.
That, when we could spy the ground again, we saw had happened; in any
case they had gone. The man insisted the wind had changed, a palpably
stupid excuse, and I wondered at that moment what other reason he
had--for reason I felt sure there must be--for not wishing to take
what would clearly now have been a better route. But this piece of
bad management did not spoil our luck, for within an hour we had
spied more deer, and about two o'clock I got a shot, killing a heavy
stag. Then sitting on the heather I ate lunch, and enjoyed a
well-earned bask and smoke in the sun. The pony meantime had been
saddled with the stag, and was plodding homewards.</p>

<p>"The morning had been extraordinarily warm, with a little wind
blowing off the sea, which lay a few miles off sparkling beneath a
blue haze, and all morning in spite of our abominable climb I had had
an extreme sense of peace, so much so that several times I had probed
my mind, so to speak, to find if the horror still lingered there. But
I could scarcely get any response from it.</p>

<p>"Never since Christmas had I been so free of fear, and it was with
a great sense of repose, both physical and spiritual, that I lay
looking up into the blue sky, watching my smoke-whorls curl slowly
away into nothingness. But I was not allowed to take my ease long,
for Sandy came and begged that I would move. The weather had changed,
he said, the wind had shifted again, and he wanted me to be off this
high ground and on the path again as soon as possible, because it
looked to him as if a sea-mist would presently come up."</p>

<p>"'And yon's a bad place to get down in the mist,' he added,
nodding towards the crags we had come up.</p>

<p>"I looked at the man in amazement, for to our right lay a gentle
slope down on to the river, and there was now no possible reason for
again tackling those hideous rocks up which we had climbed this
morning. More than ever I was sure he had some secret reason for not
wishing to go the obvious way. But about one thing he was certainly
right, the mist was coming up from the sea, and I felt in my pocket
for the compass, and found I had forgotten to bring it.</p>

<p>"Then there followed a curious scene which lost us time that we
could really ill afford to waste, I insisting on going down by the
way that common sense directed, he imploring me to take his word for
it that the crags were the better way. Eventually, I marched off to
the easier descent, and told him not to argue any more but follow.
What annoyed me about him was that he would only give the most
senseless reasons for preferring the crags. There were mossy places,
he said, on the way I wished to go, a thing patently false, since the
summer had been one spell of unbroken weather; or it was longer, also
obviously untrue; or there were so many vipers about.</p>

<p>"But seeing that none of these arguments produced any effect, at
last he desisted, and came after me in silence.</p>

<p>"We were not yet half down when the mist was upon us, shooting up
from the valley like the broken water of a wave, and in three minutes
we were enveloped in a cloud of fog so thick that we could barely see
a dozen yards in front of us. It was therefore another cause for
self-congratulation that we were not now, as we should otherwise have
been, precariously clambering on the face of those crags up which we
had come with such difficulty in the morning, and as I rather prided
myself on my powers of generalship in the matter of direction, I
continued leading, feeling sure that before long we should strike the
track by the river. More than all, the absolute freedom from fear
elated me; since Christmas I had not known the instinctive joy of
that; I felt like a schoolboy home for the holidays. But the mist
grew thicker and thicker, and whether it was that real rain-clouds
had formed above it, or that it was of an extraordinary density
itself, I got wetter in the next hour than I have ever been before or
since. The wet seemed to penetrate the skin, and chill the very
bones. And still there was no sign of the track for which I was
making.</p>

<p>"Behind me, muttering to himself, followed the stalker, but his
arguments and protestations were dumb, and it seemed as if he kept
close to me, as if afraid.</p>

<p>"Now there are many unpleasant companions in this world; I would
not, for instance, care to be on the hill with a drunkard or a
maniac, but worse than either, I think, is a frightened man, because
his trouble is infectious, and, insensibly. I began to be afraid of
being frightened too.</p>

<p>"From that it is but a short step to fear. Other perplexities too
beset us. At one time we seemed to be walking on flat ground, at
another I felt sure we were climbing again, whereas all the time we
ought to have been descending, unless we had missed the way very
badly indeed. Also, for the month was October, it was beginning to
get dark, and it was with a sense of relief that I remembered that
the full moon would rise soon after sunset. But it had grown very
much colder, and soon, instead of rain, we found we were walking
through a steady fall of snow.</p>

<p>"Things were pretty bad, but then for the moment they seemed to
mend, for, far away to the left, I suddenly heard the brawling of the
river. It should, it is true, have been straight in front of me and
we were perhaps a mile out of our way, but this was better than the
blind wandering of the last hour, and turning to the left, I walked
towards it. But before I had gone a hundred yards, I heard a sudden
choked cry behind me, and just saw Sandy's form flying as if in
terror of pursuit, into the mists. I called to him, but got no reply,
and heard only the spurned stones of his running.</p>

<p>"What had frightened him I had no idea, but certainly with his
disappearance, the infection of his fear disappeared also, and I went
on, I may almost say, with gaiety. On the moment, however, I saw a
sudden well-defined blackness in front of me, and before I knew what
I was doing I was half stumbling, half walking up a very steep grass
slope.</p>

<p>"During the last few minutes the wind had got up, and the driving
snow was peculiarly uncomfortable, but there had been a certain
consolation in thinking that the wind would soon disperse these
mists, and I had nothing more than a moonlight walk home. But as I
paused on this slope, I became aware of two things, one, that the
blackness in front of me was very close, the other that, whatever it
was, it sheltered me from the snow. So I climbed on a dozen yards
into its friendly shelter, for it seemed to me to be friendly.</p>

<p>"A wall some twelve feet high crowned the slope, and exactly where
I struck it there was a hole in it, or door rather, through which a
little light appeared. Wondering at this I pushed on, bending down,
for the passage was very low, and in a dozen yards came out on the
other side.</p>

<p>"Just as I did this the sky suddenly grew lighter, the wind, I
suppose, having dispersed the mists, and the moon, though not yet
visible through the flying skirts of cloud, made sufficient
illumination.</p>

<p>"I was in a circular enclosure, and above me there projected from
the walls some four feet from the ground, broken stones which must
have been intended to support a floor. Then simultaneously two things
occurred.</p>

<p>"The whole of my nine months' terror came back to me, for I saw
that the vision in the garden was fulfilled, and at the same moment I
saw stealing towards me a little figure as of a man, but only about
three foot six in height. That my eyes told me; my ears told me that
he stumbled on a stone; my nostrils told me that the air I breathed
was of an overpowering foulness, and my soul told me that it was sick
unto death. I think I tried to scream, but could not; I know I tried
to move and could not. And it crept closer.</p>

<p>"Then I suppose the terror which held me spellbound so spurred me
that I must move, for next moment I heard a cry break from my lips,
and was stumbling through the passage. I made one leap of it down the
grass slope, and ran as I hope never to have to run again. What
direction I took I did not pause to consider, so long as I put
distance between me and that place. Luck, however, favoured me, and
before long I struck the track by the river, and an hour afterwards
reached the lodge.</p>

<p>"Next day I developed a chill, and as you know pneumonia laid me
on my back for six weeks.</p>

<p>"Well, that is my story, and there are many explanations. You may
say that I fell asleep on the lawn, and was reminded of that by
finding myself, under discouraging circumstances, in an old Picts'
castle, where a sheep or a goat that, like myself, had taken shelter
from the storm, was moving about. Yes, there are hundreds of ways in
which you may explain it. But the coincidence was an odd one, and
those who believe in second sight might find an instance of their
hobby in it."</p>

<p>"And that is all?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was nearly too much for me. I think the dressing-bell has
sounded."</p>

<h2><a name="ch05"></a>The House with the Brick-Kiln</h2>

<p>The hamlet of Trevor Major lies very lonely and sequestered in a
hollow below the north side of the south downs that stretch westward
from Lewes, and run parallel with the coast. It is a hamlet of some
three or four dozen inconsiderable houses and cottages much girt
about with trees, but the big Norman church and the manor house which
stands a little outside the village are evidence of a more
conspicuous past. This latter, except for a tenancy of rather less
than three weeks, now four years ago, has stood unoccupied since the
summer of 1896, and though it could be taken at a rent almost
comically small, it is highly improbable that either of its last
tenants, even if times were very bad, would think of passing a night
in it again. For myself--I was one of the tenants--I would far prefer
living in a workhouse to inhabiting those low-pitched oak-panelled
rooms, and I would sooner look from my garret windows on to the
squalor and grime of Whitechapel than from the diamond-shaped and
leaded panes of the Manor of Trevor Major on to the boskage of its
cool thickets, and the glimmering of its clear chalk streams where
the quick trout glance among the waving water-weeds and over the
chalk and gravel of its sliding rapids.</p>

<p>It was the news of these trout that led Jack Singleton and myself
to take the house for the month between mid-May and mid-June, but as
I have already mentioned a short three weeks was all the time we
passed there, and we had more than a week of our tenancy yet
unexpired when we left the place, though on the very last afternoon
we enjoyed the finest dry-fly fishing that has ever fallen to my lot.
Singleton had originally seen the advertisement of the house in a
Sussex paper, with the statement that there was good dry-fly fishing
belonging to it, but it was with but faint hopes of the reality of
the dry-fly fishing that we went down to look at the place, since we
had before this so often inspected depopulated ditches which were
offered to the unwary under high-sounding titles. Yet after a
half-hour's stroll by the stream, we went straight back to the agent,
and before nightfall had taken it for a month with option of
renewal.</p>

<p>We arrived accordingly from town at about five o'clock on a
cloudless afternoon in May, and through the mists of horror that now
stand between me and the remembrance of what occurred later, I cannot
forget the exquisite loveliness of the impression then conveyed. The
garden, it is true, appeared to have been for years untended; weeds
half-choked the gravel paths, and the flower-beds were a congestion
of mingled wild and cultivated vegetations. It was set in a wall of
mellowed brick, in which snap-dragon and stone-crop had found an
anchorage to their liking, and beyond that there stood sentinel a
ring of ancient pines in which the breeze made music as of a distant
sea. Outside that the ground sloped slightly downwards in a bank
covered with a jungle of wild-rose to the stream that ran round three
sides of the garden, and then followed a meandering course through
the two big fields which lay towards the village. Over all this we
had fishing-rights; above, the same rights extended for another
quarter of a mile to the arched bridge over which there crossed the
road which led to the house. In this field above the house on the
fourth side, where the ground had been embanked to carry the road,
stood a brick-kiln in a ruinous state. A shallow pit, long overgrown
with tall grasses and wild field-flowers, showed where the clay had
been digged.</p>

<p>The house itself was long and narrow; entering, you passed direct
into a square panelled hall, on the left of which was the dining-room
which communicated with the passage leading to the kitchen and
offices. On the right of the hall were two excellent sitting-rooms
looking out, the one on to the gravel in front of the house, the
other on to the garden. From the first of these you could see,
through the gap in the pines by which the road approached the house,
the brick-kiln of which I have already spoken. An oak staircase went
up from the hall, and round it ran a gallery on to which the three
principal bedrooms opened. These were commensurate with the
dining-room and the two sitting-rooms below. From this gallery there
led a long narrow passage shut off from the rest of the house by a
red-baize door, which led to a couple more guest-rooms and the
servants' quarters.</p>

<p>Jack Singleton and I share the same flat in town, and we had sent
down in the morning Franklyn and his wife, two old and valued
servants, to get things ready at Trevor Major, and procure help from
the village to look after the house, and Mrs. Franklyn, with her
stout comfortable face all wreathed in smiles, opened the door to us.
She had had some previous experience of the "comfortable quarters"
which go with fishing, and had come down prepared for the worst, but
found it all of the best. The kitchen-boiler was not furred; hot and
cold water was laid on in the most convenient fashion, and could be
obtained from taps that neither stuck nor leaked. Her husband, it
appeared, had gone into the village to buy a few necessaries, and she
brought up tea for us, and then went upstairs to the two rooms over
the dining-room and bigger sitting-room, which we had chosen for our
bedrooms, to unpack. The doors of these were exactly opposite one
another to right and left of the gallery, and Jack, who chose the
bedroom above the sitting-room, had thus a smaller room, above the
second sitting-room, unoccupied, next his and opening out from
it.</p>

<p>We had a couple of hours' fishing before dinner, each of us
catching three or four brace of trout, and came back in the dusk to
the house. Franklyn had returned from the village from his errand,
reported that he had got a woman to come in to do housework in the
mornings, and mentioned that our arrival had seemed to arouse a good
deal of interest. The reason for this was obscure; he could only tell
us that he was questioned a dozen times as to whether we really
intended to live in the house, and his assurance that we did produced
silence and a shaking of heads. But the country-folk of Sussex are
notable for their silence and chronic attitude of disapproval, and we
put this down to local idiosyncrasy.</p>

<p>The evening was exquisitely warm, and after dinner we pulled out a
couple of basket-chairs on to the gravel by the front door, and sat
for an hour or so, while the night deepened in throbs of gathering
darkness. The moon was not risen and the ring of pines cut off much
of the pale starlight, so that when we went in, allured by the
shining of the lamp in the sitting-room, it was curiously dark for a
clear night in May. And at that moment of stepping from the darkness
into the cheerfulness of the lighted house, I had a sudden sensation,
to which, during the next fortnight, I became almost accustomed, of
there being something unseen and unheard and dreadful near me. In
spite of the warmth, I felt myself shiver, and concluded instantly
that I had sat out-of-doors long enough, and without mentioning it to
Jack, followed him into the smaller sitting-room in which we had
scarcely yet set foot. It, like the hall, was oak-panelled, and in
the panels hung some half-dozen of water-colour sketches, which we
examined, idly at first, and then with growing interest, for they
were executed with extraordinary finish and delicacy, and each
represented some aspect of the house or garden. Here you looked up
the gap in the fir-trees into a crimson sunset; here the garden, trim
and carefully tended, dozed beneath some languid summer noon; here an
angry wreath of storm-cloud brooded over the meadow where the
trout-stream ran grey and leaden below a threatening sky, while
another, the most careful and arresting of all, was a study of the
brick-kiln. In this, alone of them all, was there a human figure; a
man, dressed in grey, peered into the open door from which issued a
fierce red glow. The figure was painted with miniature-like
elaboration; the face was in profile, and represented a youngish man,
clean-shaven, with a long aquiline nose and singularly square chin.
The sketch was long and narrow in shape, and the chimney of the kiln
appeared against a dark sky. From it there issued a thin stream of
grey smoke.</p>

<p>Jack looked at this with attention.</p>

<p>"What a horrible picture!" he said, "and how beautifully painted!
I feel as if it meant something, as if it was a representation of
something that happened, not a mere sketch. By Jove!--"</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly and went in turn to each of the other
pictures.</p>

<p>"That's a queer thing," he said. "See if you notice what I
mean."</p>

<p>With the brick-kiln rather vividly impressed on my mind, it was
not difficult to see what he had noticed. In each of the pictures
appeared the brick-kiln, chimney and all, now seen faintly between
trees, now in full view, and in each the chimney was smoking.</p>

<p>"And the odd part is that from the garden side, you can't really
see the kiln at all," observed Jack, "it's hidden by the house, and
yet the artist F. A., as I see by his signature, puts it in just the
same."</p>

<p>"What do you make of that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I suppose he had a fancy for brick-kilns. Let's have a
game of picquet."</p>

<p>A fortnight of our three weeks passed without incident, except
that again and again the curious feeling of something dreadful being
close at hand was present in my mind. In a way, as I said, I got used
to it, but on the other hand the feeling itself seemed to gain in
poignancy. Once just at the end of the fortnight I mentioned it to
Jack.</p>

<p>"Odd you should speak of it," he said, "because I've felt the
same. When do you feel it? Do you feel it now, for instance?"</p>

<p>We were again sitting out after dinner, and as he spoke I felt it
with far greater intensity than ever before. And at the same moment
the house-door which had been closed, though probably not latched,
swung gently open, letting out a shaft of light from the hall, and as
gently swung to again, as if something had stealthily entered.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "I felt it then. I only feel it in the evening. It
was rather bad that time."</p>

<p>Jack was silent a moment.</p>

<p>"Funny thing the door opening and shutting like that," he said.
"Let's go indoors."</p>

<p>We got up and I remember seeing at that moment that the windows of
my bedroom were lit; Mrs. Franklyn probably was making things ready
for the night. Simultaneously, as we crossed the gravel, there came
from just inside the house the sound of a hurried footstep on the
stairs, and entering we found Mrs. Franklyn in the hall, looking
rather white and startled.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong?" I asked.</p>

<p>She took two or three quick breaths before she answered:</p>

<p>"No, sir," she said, "at least nothing that I can give an account
of. I was tidying up in your room, and I thought you came in. But
there was nobody, and it gave me a turn. I left my candle there; I
must go up for it."</p>

<p>I waited in the hall a moment, while she again ascended the
stairs, and passed along the gallery to my room. At the door, which I
could see was open, she paused, not entering.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" I asked from below.</p>

<p>"I left the candle alight," she said, "and it's gone out." Jack
laughed.</p>

<p>"And you left the door and window open," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but not a breath of wind is stirring," said Mrs.
Franklyn, rather faintly.</p>

<p>This was true, and yet a few moments ago the heavy hall-door had
swung open and back again. Jack ran upstairs.</p>

<p>"We'll brave the dark together, Mrs. Franklyn," he said.</p>

<p>He went into my room, and I heard the sound of a match struck.
Then through the open door came the light of the rekindled candle and
simultaneously I heard a bell ring in the servants' quarters. In a
moment came steps, and Franklyn appeared.</p>

<p>"What bell was that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jack's bedroom, sir," he said.</p>

<p>I felt there was a marked atmosphere of nerves about for which
there was really no adequate cause. All that had happened of a
disturbing nature was that Mrs. Franklyn had thought I had come into
my bedroom, and had been startled by finding I had not. She had then
left the candle in a draught, and it had been blown out. As for a
bell ringing, that, even if it had happened, was a very innocuous
proceeding.</p>

<p>"Mouse on a wire," I said. "Mr. Jack is in my room this moment
lighting Mrs. Franklyn's candle for her."</p>

<p>Jack came down at this juncture, and we went into the
sitting-room. But Franklyn apparently was not satisfied, for we heard
him in the room above us, which was Jack's bedroom, moving about with
his slow and rather ponderous tread. Then his steps seemed to pass
into the bedroom adjoining and we heard no more.</p>

<p>I remember feeling hugely sleepy that night, and went to bed
earlier than usual, to pass rather a broken night with stretches of
dreamless sleep interspersed with startled awakenings, in which I
passed very suddenly into complete consciousness. Sometimes the house
was absolutely still, and the only sound to be heard was the sighing
of the night breeze outside in the pines, but sometimes the place
seemed full of muffled movements and once I could have sworn that the
handle of my door turned. That required verification, and I lit my
candle, but found that my ears must have played me false. Yet even as
I stood there, I thought I heard steps just outside, and with a
considerable qualm, I must confess, I opened the door and looked out.
But the gallery was quite empty, and the house quite still. Then from
Jack's room opposite I heard a sound that was somehow comforting, the
snorts of the snorer, and I went back to bed and slept again, and
when next I woke, morning was already breaking in red lines on the
horizon, and the sense of trouble that had been with me ever since
last evening had gone.</p>

<p>Heavy rain set in after lunch next day, and as I had arrears of
letter-writing to do, and the water was soon both muddy and rising, I
came home alone about five, leaving Jack still sanguine by the
stream, and worked for a couple of hours sitting at a writing-table
in the room overlooking the gravel at the front of the house, where
hung the water-colours. By seven I had finished, and just as I got up
to light candles, since it was already dusk, I saw, as I thought,
Jack's figure emerge from the bushes that bordered the path to the
stream, on to the space in front of the house. Then instantaneously
and with a sudden queer sinking of the heart quite unaccountable, I
saw that it was not Jack at all, but a stranger. He was only some six
yards from the window, and after pausing there a moment he came close
up to the window, so that his face nearly touched the glass, looking
intently at me. In the light from the freshly-kindled candles I could
distinguish his features with great clearness, but though, as far as
I knew, I had never seen him before, there was something familiar
about both his face and figure. He appeared to smile at me, but the
smile was one of inscrutable evil and malevolence, and immediately he
walked on, straight towards the house door opposite him, and out of
sight of the sitting-room window.</p>

<p>Now, little though I liked the look of the man, he was, as I have
said, familiar to my eye, and I went out into the hall, since he was
clearly coming to the front door, to open it to him and learn his
business. So without waiting for him to ring, I opened it, feeling
sure I should find him on the step. Instead, I looked out into the
empty gravel-sweep, the heavy-falling rain, the thick dusk.</p>

<p>And even as I looked, I felt something that I could not see push
by me through the half-opened door and pass into the house. Then the
stairs creaked, and a moment after a bell rang.</p>

<p>Franklyn is the quickest man to answer a bell I have ever seen,
and next instant he passed me going upstairs. He tapped at Jack's
door, entered and then came down again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jack still out, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. His bell ringing again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Franklyn, quite imperturbably.</p>

<p>I went back into the sitting-room, and soon Franklyn brought a
lamp. He put it on the table above which hung the careful and curious
picture of the brick-kiln, and then with a sudden horror I saw why
the stranger on the gravel outside had been so familiar to me. In all
respects he resembled the figure that peered into the kiln; it was
more than a resemblance, it was an identity.</p>

<p>And what had happened to this man who had inscrutably and evilly
smiled at me? And what had pushed in through the half-closed
door?</p>

<p>At that moment I saw the face of Fear; my mouth went dry, and I
heard my heart leaping and cracking in my throat. That face was only
turned on me for a moment, and then away again, but I knew it to be
the genuine thing; not apprehension, not foreboding, not a feeling of
being startled, but Fear, cold Fear. And then though nothing had
occurred to assuage the Fear, it passed, and a certain sort of reason
usurped--for so I must say--its place. I had certainly seen somebody
on the gravel outside the house; I had supposed he was going to the
front door. I had opened it, and found he had not come to the
front door. Or--and once again the terror resurged--had the invisible
pushing thing been that which I had seen outside? And if so, what was
it? And how came it that the face and figure of the man I had seen
were the same as those which were so scrupulously painted in the
picture of the brick-kiln?</p>

<p>I set myself to argue down the Fear for which there was no more
foundation than this, this and the repetition of the ringing bell,
and my belief is that I did so. I told myself, till I believed it,
that a man--a human man--had been walking across the gravel outside,
and that he had not come to the front door but had gone, as he might
easily have done, up the drive into the high-road.</p>

<p>I told myself that it was mere fancy that was the cause of the
belief that Something had pushed in by me, and as for the ringing of
the bell, I said to myself, as was true, that this had happened
before. And I must ask the reader to believe also that I argued these
things away, and looked no longer on the face of Fear itself. I was
not comfortable, but I fell short of being terrified.</p>

<p>I sat down again by the window looking on to the gravel in front
of the house, and finding another letter that asked, though it did
not demand, an answer, proceeded to occupy myself with it. Straight
in front led the drive through the gap in the pines, and passed
through the field where lay the brick-kiln. In a pause of
page-turning I looked up and saw something unusual about it; at the
same moment an unusual smell came to my nostril. What I saw was smoke
coming out of the chimney of the kiln, what I smelt was the odour of
roasting meat. The wind--such as there was--set from the kiln to the
house. But as far as I knew the smell of roast meat probably came
from the kitchen where dinner, so I supposed, was cooking. I had to
tell myself this: I wanted reassurance, lest the face of Fear should
look whitely on me again.</p>

<p>Then there came a crisp step on the gravel, a rattle at the
front door, and Jack came in.</p>

<p>"Good sport," he said, "you gave up too soon."</p>

<p>And he went straight to the table above which hung the picture of
the man at the brick-kiln, and looked at it. Then there was silence;
and eventually I spoke, for I wanted to know one thing.</p>

<p>"Seen anybody?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I have also; the man in that picture."</p>

<p>Jack came and sat down near me.</p>

<p>"It's a ghost, you know," he said. "He came down to the river
about dusk and stood near me for an hour. At first I thought he was
real--was real, and I warned him that he had better stand further off
if he didn't want to be hooked. And then it struck me he wasn't real,
and I cast, well, right through him, and about seven he walked up
towards the house."</p>

<p>"Were you frightened?"</p>

<p>"No. It was so tremendously interesting. So you saw him here too.
Whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"Just outside. I think he is in the house now."</p>

<p>Jack looked round.</p>

<p>"Did you see him come in?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, but I felt him. There's another queer thing too; the chimney
of the brick-kiln is smoking."</p>

<p>Jack looked out of the window. It was nearly dark, but the
wreathing smoke could just be seen.</p>

<p>"So it is," he said, "fat, greasy smoke. I think I'll go up and
see what's on. Come too?"</p>

<p>"I think not," I said.</p>

<p>"Are you frightened? It isn't worth while. Besides, it is so
tremendously interesting."</p>

<p>Jack came back from his little expedition still interested. He had
found nothing stirring at the kiln, but though it was then nearly
dark the interior was faintly luminous, and against the black of the
sky he could see a wisp of thick white smoke floating northwards. But
for the rest of the evening we neither heard nor saw anything of
abnormal import, and the next day ran a course of undisturbed hours.
Then suddenly a hellish activity was manifested.</p>

<p>That night, while I was undressing for bed, I heard a bell ring
furiously, and I thought I heard a shout also. I guessed where the
ring came from, since Franklyn and his wife had long ago gone to bed,
and went straight to Jack's room. But as I tapped at the door I heard
his voice from inside calling loud to me. "Take care," it said, "he's
close to the door."</p>

<p>A sudden qualm of blank fear took hold of me, but mastering it as
best I could, I opened the door to enter, and once again something
pushed softly by me, though I saw nothing.</p>

<p>Jack was standing by his bed, half-un-- I saw him wipe his
forehead with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>"He's been here again," he said. "I was standing just here, a
minute ago, when I found him close by me. He came out of the inner
room, I think. Did you see what he had in his hand?"</p>

<p>"I saw nothing."</p>

<p>"It was a knife; a great long carving knife. Do you mind my
sleeping on the sofa in your room to-night? I got an awful turn then.
There was another thing too. All round the edge of his clothes, at
his collar and at his wrists, there were little flames playing,
little white licking flames." But next day, again, we neither heard
nor saw anything, nor that night did the sense of that dreadful
presence in the house come to us. And then came the last day. We had
been out till it was dark, and as I said, had a wonderful day among
the fish. On reaching home we sat together in the sitting-room, when
suddenly from overhead came a tread of feet, a violent pealing of the
bell, and the moment after yell after yell as of someone in mortal
agony. The thought occurred to both of us that this might be Mrs.
Franklyn in terror of some fearful sight, and together we rushed up
and sprang into Jack's bedroom.</p>

<p>The doorway into the room beyond was open, and just inside it we
saw the man bending over some dark huddled object. Though the room
was dark we could see him perfectly, for a light stale and impure
seemed to come from him. He had again a long knife in his hand, and
as we entered he was wiping it on the mass that lay at his feet. Then
he took it up, and we saw what it was, a woman with head nearly
severed. But it was not Mrs. Franklyn.</p>

<p>And then the whole thing vanished, and we were standing looking
into a dark and empty room. We went downstairs without a word, and it
was not till we were both in the sitting-room below that Jack
spoke.</p>

<p>"And he takes her to the brick-kiln," he said rather
unsteadily.</p>

<p>"I say, have you had enough of this house? I have. There is hell
in it."</p>

<p>About a week later Jack put into my hand a guide-book to Sussex
open at the description of Trevor Major, and I read:</p>

<p>"Just outside the village stands the picturesque manor house, once
the home of the artist and notorious murderer, Francis Adam. It was
here he killed his wife, in a fit, it is believed, of groundless
jealousy, cutting her throat and disposing of her remains by burning
them in a brick-kiln."</p>

<p>"Certain charred fragments found six months afterwards led to his
arrest and execution."</p>

<p>So I prefer to leave the house with the brick-kiln and the
pictures signed F. A. to others.</p>

<h2><a name="ch06"></a>The Man Who Went Too Far</h2>

<p>The little village of St. Faith's nestles in a hollow of wooded
till up on the north bank of the river Fawn in the country of
Hampshire, huddling close round its grey Norman church as if for
spiritual protection against the fays and fairies, the trolls and
"little people," who might be supposed still to linger in the vast
empty spaces of the New Forest, and to come after dusk and do their
doubtful businesses. Once outside the hamlet you may walk in any
direction (so long as you avoid the high road which leads to
Brockenhurst) for the length of a summer afternoon without seeing
sign of human habitation, or possibly even catching sight of another
human being.</p>

<p>Shaggy wild ponies may stop their feeding for a moment as you
pass, the white scuts of rabbits will vanish into their burrows, a
brown viper perhaps will glide from your path into a clump of
heather, and unseen birds will chuckle in the bushes, but it may
easily happen that for a long day you will see nothing human. But you
will not feel in the least lonely; in summer, at any rate, the
sunlight will be gay with butterflies, and the air thick with all
those woodland sounds which like instruments in an orchestra combine
to play the great symphony of the yearly festival of June.</p>

<p>Winds whisper in the birches, and sigh among the firs; bees are
busy with their redolent labour among the heather, a myriad birds
chirp in the green temples of the forest trees, and the voice of the
river prattling over stony places, bubbling into pools, chuckling and
gulping round corners, gives you the sense that many presences and
companions are near at hand.</p>

<p>Yet, oddly enough, though one would have thought that these benign
and cheerful influences of wholesome air and spaciousness of forest
were very healthful comrades for a man, in so far as Nature can
really influence this wonderful human genus which has in these
centuries learned to defy her most violent storms in its
well-established houses, to bridle her torrents and make them light
its streets, to tunnel her mountains and plough her seas, the
inhabitants of St. Faith's will not willingly venture into the forest
after dark. For in spite of the silence and loneliness of the hooded
night it seems that a man is not sure in what company he may suddenly
find himself, and though it is difficult to get from these villagers
any very clear story of occult appearances, the feeling is
widespread. One story indeed I have heard with some definiteness, the
tale of a monstrous goat that has been seen to skip with hellish glee
about the woods and shady places, and this perhaps is connected with
the story which I have here attempted to piece together. It too is
well-known to them; for all remember the young artist who died here
not long ago, a young man, or so he struck the beholder, of great
personal beauty, with something about him that made men's faces to
smile and brighten when they looked on him. His ghost they will tell
you "walks" constantly by the stream and through the woods which he
loved so, and in especial it haunts a certain house, the last of the
village, where he lived, and its garden in which he was done to
death. For my part I am inclined to think that the terror of the
forest dates chiefly from that day.</p>

<p>So, such as the story is, I have set it forth in connected form.
It is based partly on the accounts of the villagers, but mainly on
that of Darcy, a friend of mine and a friend of the man with whom
these events were chiefly concerned.</p>

<p>The day had been one of untarnished midsummer splendour, and as
the sun drew near to its setting, the glory of the evening grew every
moment more crystalline, more miraculous.</p>

<p>Westward from St. Faith's the beechwood which stretched for some
miles toward the heathery upland beyond already cast its veil of
clear shadow over the red roofs of the village, but the spire of the
grey church, over-topping all, still pointed a flaming orange finger
into the sky. The river Fawn, which runs below, lay in sheets of
sky-reflected blue, and wound its dreamy devious course round the
edge of this wood, where a rough two-planked bridge crossed from the
bottom of the garden of the last house in the village, and
communicated by means of a little wicker gate with the wood itself.
Then once out of the shadow of the wood the stream lay in flaming
pools of the molten crimson of the sunset, and lost itself in the
haze of woodland distances.</p>

<p>This house at the end of the village stood outside the shadow, and
the lawn which sloped down to the river was still flecked with
sunlight. Garden-beds of dazzling colour lined its gravel walks, and
down the middle of it ran a brick pergola, half-hidden in clusters of
rambler-rose and purple with starry clematis. At the bottom end of
it, between two of its pillars, was slung a hammock containing a
shirtsleeved figure.</p>

<p>The house itself lay somewhat remote from the rest of the village,
and a footpath leading across two fields, now tall and fragrant with
hay, was its only communication with the high road.</p>

<p>It was low-built, only two stories in height, and like the garden,
its walls were a mass of flowering roses. A narrow stone terrace ran
along the garden front, over which was stretched an awning, and on
the terrace a young silent-footed man-servant was busied with the
laying of the table for dinner. He was neat-handed and quick with his
job, and having finished it he went back into the house, and
reappeared again with a large rough bath-towel on his arm. With this
he went to the hammock in the pergola.</p>

<p>"Nearly eight, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Darcy come yet?" asked a voice from the hammock.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"If I'm not back when he comes, tell him that I'm just having a
bathe before dinner."</p>

<p>The servant went back to the house, and after a moment or two
Frank Halton struggled to a sitting posture, and slipped out on to
the grass. He was of medium height and rather slender in build, but
the supple ease and grace of his movements gave the impression of
great physical strength: even his descent from the hammock was not an
awkward performance. His face and hands were of very dark complexion,
either from constant exposure to wind and sun, or, as his black hair
and dark eyes tended to show, from some strain of southern blood. His
head was small, his face of an exquisite beauty of modelling, while
the smoothness of its contour would have led you to believe that he
was a beardless lad still in his teens. But something, some look
which living and experience alone can give, seemed to contradict
that, and finding yourself completely puzzled as to his age, you
would next moment probably cease to think about that, and only look
at this glorious specimen of young manhood with wondering
satisfaction.</p>

<p>He was dressed as became the season and the heat, and wore only a
shirt open at the neck, and a pair of flannel trousers. His head,
covered very thickly with a somewhat rebellious crop of short curly
hair, was bare as he strolled across the lawn to the bathing-place
that lay below. Then for a moment there was silence, then the sound
of splashed and divided waters, and presently after, a great shout of
ecstatic joy, as he swam up-stream with the foamed water standing in
a frill round his neck. Then after some five minutes of
limb-stretching struggle with the flood, he turned over on his back,
and with arms thrown wide, floated down-stream, ripple-cradled and
inert. His eyes were shut, and between half-parted lips he talked
gently to himself.</p>

<p>"I am one with it," he said to himself, "the river and I, I and
the river. The coolness and splash of it is I, and the water-herbs
that wave in it are I also. And my strength and my limbs are not mine
but the river's. It is all one, all one, dear Fawn." A quarter of an
hour later he appeared again at the bottom of the lawn, dressed as
before, his wet hair already drying into its crisp short curls again.
There he paused a moment, looking back at the stream with the smile
with which men look on the face of a friend, then turned towards the
house. Simultaneously his servant came to the door leading on to the
terrace, followed by a man who appeared to be some half-way through
the fourth decade of his years. Frank and he saw each other across
the bushes and garden-beds, and each quickening his step, they met
suddenly face to face round an angle of the garden walk, in the
fragrance of syringa.</p>

<p>"My dear Darcy," cried Frank, "I am charmed to see you." But the
other stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"Frank!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is my name," he said, laughing; "what is the matter?"
Darcy took his hand.</p>

<p>"What have you done to yourself?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You are a boy again."</p>

<p>"Ah, I have a lot to tell you," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Lots that you will hardly believe, but I shall convince
you--"</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, and held up his hand.</p>

<p>"Hush, there is my nightingale," he said.</p>

<p>The smile of recognition and welcome with which he had greeted his
friend faded from his face, and a look of rapt wonder took its place,
as of a lover listening to the voice of his beloved.</p>

<p>His mouth parted slightly, showing the white line of teeth, and
his eyes looked out and out till they seemed to Darcy to be focussed
on things beyond the vision of man. Then something perhaps startled
the bird, for the song ceased.</p>

<p>"Yes, lots to tell you," he said. "Really I am delighted to see
you. But you look rather white and pulled down; no wonder after that
fever. And there is to be no nonsense about this visit. It is June
now, you stop here till you are fit to begin work again. Two months
at least."</p>

<p>"Ah, I can't trespass quite to that extent."</p>

<p>Frank took his arm and walked him down the grass.</p>

<p>"Trespass? Who talks of trespass? I shall tell you quite openly
when I am tired of you, but you know when we had the studio together,
we used not to bore each other. However, it is ill talking of going
away on the moment of your arrival. Just a stroll to the river, and
then it will be dinner-time."</p>

<p>Darcy took out his cigarette case, and offered it to the
other.</p>

<p>Frank laughed.</p>

<p>"No, not for me. Dear me, I suppose I used to smoke once. How very
odd!"</p>

<p>"Given it up?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I suppose I must have. Anyhow I don't do it now. I
would as soon think of eating meat."</p>

<p>"Another victim on the smoking altar of vegetarianism?"</p>

<p>"Victim?" asked Frank. "Do I strike you as such?"</p>

<p>He paused on the margin of the stream and whistled softly. Next
moment a moor-hen made its splashing flight across the river, and ran
up the bank. Frank took it very gently in his hands and stroked its
head, as the creature lay against his shirt.</p>

<p>"And is the house among the reeds still secure?" he half-crooned
to it. "And is the missus quite well, and are the neighbours
flourishing? There, dear, home with you," and he flung it into the
air.</p>

<p>"That bird's very tame," said Darcy, slightly bewildered.</p>

<p>"It is rather," said Frank, following its flight.</p>

<p>During dinner Frank chiefly occupied himself in bringing himself
up-to-date in the movements and achievements of this old friend whom
he had not seen for six years. Those six years, it now appeared, had
been full of incident and success for Darcy; he had made a name for
himself as a portrait painter which bade fair to outlast the vogue of
a couple of seasons, and his leisure time had been brief. Then some
four months previously he had been through a severe attack of
typhoid, the result of which as concerns this story was that he had
come down to this sequestered place to recruit.</p>

<p>"Yes, you've got on," said Frank at the end. "I always knew you
would. A.R.A. with more in prospect. Money? You roll in it, I
suppose, and, O Darcy, how much happiness have you had all these
years? That is the only imperishable possession. And how much have
you learned? Oh, I don't mean in Art. Even I could have done well in
that."</p>

<p>Darcy laughed.</p>

<p>"Done well? My dear fellow, all I have learned in these six years
you knew, so to speak, in your cradle. Your old pictures fetch huge
prices. Do you never paint now?"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, I'm too busy," he said.</p>

<p>"Doing what? Please tell me. That is what everyone is for ever
asking me."</p>

<p>"Doing? I suppose you would say I do nothing."</p>

<p>Darcy glanced up at the brilliant young face opposite him.</p>

<p>"It seems to suit you, that way of being busy," he said. "Now,
it's your turn. Do you read? Do you study? I remember you saying that
it would do us all--all us artists, I mean--a great deal of good if
we would study any one human face carefully for a year, without
recording a line."</p>

<p>"Have you been doing that?"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head again.</p>

<p>"I mean exactly what I say," he said. "I have been doing nothing.
And I have never been so occupied. Look at me; have I not done
something to myself to begin with?"</p>

<p>"You are two years younger than I," said Darcy, "at least you used
to be. You therefore are thirty-five. But had I never seen you before
I should say you were just twenty. But was it worth while to spend
six years of greatly-occupied life in order to look twenty? Seems
rather like a woman of fashion."</p>

<p>Frank laughed boisterously.</p>

<p>"First time I've ever been compared to that particular bird of
prey," he said. "No, that has not been my occupation--in fact I am
only very rarely conscious that one effect of my occupation has been
that. Of course, it must have been if one comes to think of it. It is
not very important."</p>

<p>"Quite true my body has become young. But that is very little; I
have become young."</p>

<p>Darcy pushed back his chair and sat sideways to the table looking
at the other.</p>

<p>"Has that been your occupation then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, that anyhow is one aspect of it. Think what youth means! It
is the capacity for growth, mind, body, spirit, all grow, all get
stronger, all have a fuller, firmer life every day. That is
something, considering that every day that passes after the ordinary
man reaches the full-blown flower of his strength, weakens his hold
on life. A man reaches his prime, and remains, we say, in his prime
for ten years, or perhaps twenty. But after his primest prime is
reached, he slowly, insensibly weakens. These are the signs of age in
you, in your body, in your art probably, in your mind. You are less
electric than you were. But I, when I reach my prime--I am nearing
it--ah, you shall see." The stars had begun to appear in the blue
velvet of the sky, and to the east the horizon seen above the black
silhouette of the village was growing dove-coloured with the approach
of moon-rise.</p>

<p>White moths hovered dimly over the garden-beds, and the footsteps
of night tip-toed through the bushes. Suddenly Frank rose.</p>

<p>"Ah, it is the supreme moment," he said softly. "Now more than at
any other time the current of life, the eternal imperishable current
runs so close to me that I am almost enveloped in it. Be silent a
minute."</p>

<p>He advanced to the edge of the terrace and looked out, standing
stretched with arms outspread. Darcy heard him draw a long breath
into his lungs, and after many seconds expel it again. Six or eight
times he did this, then turned back into the lamplight.</p>

<p>"It will sound to you quite mad, I expect," he said, "but if you
want to hear the soberest truth I have ever spoken and shall ever
speak, I will tell you about myself. But come into the garden if it
is not damp for you. I have never told anyone yet, but I shall like
to tell you. It is long, in fact, since I have even tried to classify
what I have learned."</p>

<p>They wandered into the fragrant dimness of the pergola, and sat
down. Then Frank began:</p>

<p>"Years ago, do you remember," he said, "we used often to talk
about the decay of joy in the world. Many impulses, we settled, had
contributed to this decay, some of which were good in themselves,
others that were quite completely bad. Among the good things, I put
what we may call certain Christian virtues, renunciation,
resignation, sympathy with suffering, and the desire to relieve
sufferers, but out of those things spring very bad ones, useless
renunciation, asceticism for its own sake, mortification of the flesh
with nothing to follow, no corresponding gain that is, and that awful
and terrible disease which devastated England some centuries ago, and
from which by heredity of spirit we suffer now, Puritanism. That was
a dreadful plague, the brutes held and taught that joy and laughter
and merriment were evil: it was a doctrine the most profane and
wicked. Why, what is the commonest crime one sees? A sullen face.
That is the truth of the matter. Now all my life I have believed that
we are intended to be happy, that joy is of all gifts the most
divine. And when I left London, abandoned my career, such as it was,
I did so because I intended to devote my life to the cultivation of
joy, and, by continuous and unsparing effort to be happy. Among
people, and in constant intercourse with others, I did not find it
possible; there were too many distractions in towns and work-rooms,
and also too much suffering. So I took one step backwards or
forwards, as you may choose to put it, and went straight to Nature,
to trees, birds, animals, to all those things which quite clearly
pursue one aim only, which blindly follow the great native instinct
to be happy without any care at all for morality, or human law or
divine law. I wanted, you understand, to get all joy first-hand and
unadulterated, and I think it scarcely exists among men; it is
obsolete."</p>

<p>Darcy turned in his chair.</p>

<p>"Ah, but what makes birds and animals happy?" he asked. "Food,
food and mating."</p>

<p>Frank laughed gently in the stillness.</p>

<p>"Do not think I became a sensualist," he said. "I did not make
that mistake. For the sensualist carries his miseries pick-a-back,
and round his feet is wound the shroud that shall soon enwrap him. I
may be mad, it is true, but I am not so stupid anyhow as to have
tried that. No, what is it that makes puppies play with their own
tails, that sends cats on their prowling ecstatic errands at
night?"</p>

<p>He paused a moment.</p>

<p>"So I went to Nature," he said. "I sat down here in this New
Forest, sat down fair and square, and looked. That was my first
difficulty, to sit here quiet without being bored, to wait without
being impatient, to be receptive and very alert, though for a long
time nothing particular happened. The change in fact was slow in
those early stages."</p>

<p>"Nothing happened?" asked Darcy, rather impatiently, with the
sturdy revolt against any new idea which to the English mind is
synonymous with nonsense. "Why, what in the world should happen?"</p>

<p>Now Frank as he had known him was the most generous but most
quick-tempered of mortal men; in other words his anger would flare to
a prodigious beacon, under almost no provocation, only to be quenched
again under a gust of no less impulsive kindliness. Thus the moment
Darcy had spoken, an apology for his hasty question was half-way up
his tongue. But there was no need for it to have travelled even so
far, for Frank laughed again with kindly, genuine mirth.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I should have resented that a few years ago," he said.
"Thank goodness that resentment is one of the things I have got rid
of. I certainly wish that you should believe my story--in fact, you
are going to--but that you at this moment should imply that you do
not does not concern me."</p>

<p>"Ah, your solitary sojournings have made you inhuman," said Darcy,
still very English.</p>

<p>"No, human," said Frank. "Rather more human, at least rather less
of an ape."</p>

<p>"Well, that was my first quest," he continued, after a moment,
"the deliberate and unswerving pursuit of joy, and my method, the
eager contemplation of Nature. As far as motive went, I daresay it
was purely selfish, but as far as effect goes, it seems to me about
the best thing one can do for one's follow-creatures, for happiness
is more infectious than small-pox. So, as I said, I sat down and
waited; I looked at happy things, zealously avoided the sight of
anything unhappy, and by degrees a little trickle of the happiness of
this blissful world began to filter into me. The trickle grew more
abundant, and now, my dear fellow, if I could for a moment divert
from me into you one half of the torrent of joy that pours through me
day and night, you would throw the world, art, everything aside, and
just live, exist. When a man's body dies, it passes into trees and
flowers. Well, that is what I have been trying to do with my soul
before death."</p>

<p>The servant had brought into the pergola a table with syphons and
spirits, and had set a lamp upon it. As Frank spoke he leaned forward
towards the other, and Darcy for all his matter-of-fact common sense
could have sworn that his companion's face shone, was luminous in
itself. His dark brown eyes glowed from within, the unconscious smile
of a child irradiated and transformed his face. Darcy felt suddenly
excited, exhilarated.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said. "Go on. I can feel you are somehow telling me
sober truth. I daresay you are mad; but I don't see that
matters."</p>

<p>Frank laughed again.</p>

<p>"Mad?" he said. "Yes, certainly, if you wish. But I prefer to call
it sane. However, nothing matters less than what anybody chooses to
call things. God never labels his gifts; He just puts them into our
hands; just as he put animals in the garden of Eden, for Adam to name
if he felt disposed.</p>

<p>"So by the continual observance and study of things that were
happy," continued he, "I got happiness, I got joy. But seeking it, as
I did, from Nature, I got much more which I did not seek, but
stumbled upon originally by accident. It is difficult to explain, but
I will try.</p>

<p>"About three years ago I was sitting one morning in a place I will
show you to-morrow. It is down by the river brink, very green,
dappled with shade and sun, and the river passes there through some
little clumps of reeds. Well, as I sat there, doing nothing, but just
looking and listening, I heard the sound quite distinctly of some
flute-like instrument playing a strange unending melody. I thought at
first it was some musical yokel on the highway and did not pay much
attention. But before long the strangeness and indescribable beauty
of the tune struck me.</p>

<p>"It never repeated itself, but it never came to an end, phrase
after phrase ran its sweet course, it worked gradually and inevitably
up to a climax, and having attained it, it went on; another climax
was reached and another and another. Then with a sudden gasp of
wonder I localised where it came from. It came from the reeds and
from the sky and from the trees. It was everywhere, it was the sound
of life. It was, my dear Darcy, as the Greeks would have said, it was
Pan playing on his pipes, the voice of Nature. It was the
life-melody, the world-melody."</p>

<p>Darcy was far too interested to interrupt, though there was a
question he would have liked to ask, and Frank went on:</p>

<p>"Well, for the moment I was terrified, terrified with the impotent
horror of nightmare, and I stopped my ears and just ran from the
place and got back to the house panting, trembling, literally in a
panic. Unknowingly, for at that time I only pursued joy, I had begun,
since I drew my joy from Nature, to get in touch with Nature. Nature,
force, God, call it what you will, had drawn across my face a little
gossamer web of essential life. I saw that when I emerged from my
terror, and I went very humbly back to where I had heard the
Pan-pipes. But it was nearly six months before I heard them
again."</p>

<p>"Why was that?" asked Darcy.</p>

<p>"Surely because I had revolted, rebelled, and worst of all been
frightened. For I believe that just as there is nothing in the world
which so injures one's body as fear, so there is nothing that so much
shuts up the soul. I was afraid, you see, of the one thing in the
world which has real existence. No wonder its manifestation was
withdrawn."</p>

<p>"And after six months?"</p>

<p>"After six months one blessed morning I heard the piping again. I
wasn't afraid that time."</p>

<p>"And since then it has grown louder, it has become more constant.
I now hear it often, and I can put myself into such an attitude
towards Nature that the pipes will almost certainly sound. And never
yet have they played the same tune, it is always something new,
something fuller, richer, more complete than before."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'such an attitude towards Nature'?" asked
Darcy.</p>

<p>"I can't explain that; but by translating it into a bodily
attitude it is this."</p>

<p>Frank sat up for a moment quite straight in his chair, then slowly
sunk back with arms outspread and head drooped.</p>

<p>"That;" he said, "an effortless attitude, but open, resting,
receptive. It is just that which you must do with your soul."</p>

<p>Then he sat up again.</p>

<p>"One word more," he said, "and I will bore you no further. Nor
unless you ask me questions shall I talk about it again. You will
find me, in fact, quite sane in my mode of life. Birds and beasts you
will see behaving somewhat intimately to me, like that moor-hen, but
that is all. I will walk with you, ride with you, play golf with you,
and talk with you on any subject you like. But I wanted you on the
threshold to know what has happened to me. And one thing more will
happen."</p>

<p>He paused again, and a slight look of fear crossed his eyes.</p>

<p>"There will be a final revelation," he said, "a complete and
blinding stroke which will throw open to me, once and for all, the
full knowledge, the full realisation and comprehension that I am one,
just as you are, with life. In reality there is no 'me,' no 'you,' no
'it.' Everything is part of the one and only thing which is life. I
know that that is so, but the realisation of it is not yet mine.</p>

<p>"But it will be, and on that day, so I take it, I shall see Pan.
It may mean death, the death of my body, that is, but I don't care.
It may mean immortal, eternal life lived here and now and for
ever.</p>

<p>"Then having gained that, ah, my dear Darcy, I shall preach such a
gospel of joy, showing myself as the living proof of the truth, that
Puritanism, the dismal religion of sour faces, shall vanish like a
breath of smoke, and be dispersed and disappear in the sunlit air.
But first the full knowledge must be mine."</p>

<p>Darcy watched his face narrowly.</p>

<p>"You are afraid of that moment," he said. Frank smiled at him.</p>

<p>"Quite true; you are quick to have seen that. But when it comes I
hope I shall not be afraid."</p>

<p>For some little time there was silence; then Darcy rose. "You have
bewitched me, you extraordinary boy," he said. "You have been telling
me a fairy-story, and I find myself saying, 'Promise me it is
true."'</p>

<p>"I promise you that," said the other.</p>

<p>"And I know I shan't sleep," added Darcy.</p>

<p>Frank looked at him with a sort of mild wonder as if he scarcely
understood.</p>

<p>"Well, what does that matter?" he said.</p>

<p>"I assure you it does. I am wretched unless I sleep."</p>

<p>"Of course I can make you sleep if I want," said Frank in a rather
bored voice.</p>

<p>"Well, do."</p>

<p>"Very good: go to bed. I'll come upstairs in ten minutes."</p>

<p>Frank busied himself for a little after the other had gone, moving
the table back under the awning of the verandah and quenching the
lamp. Then he went with his quick silent tread upstairs and into
Darcy's room. The latter was already in bed, but very wide-eyed and
wakeful, and Frank with an amused smile of indulgence, as for a
fretful child, sat down on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>"Look at me," he said, and Darcy looked.</p>

<p>"The birds are sleeping in the brake," said Frank softly, "and the
winds are asleep. The sea sleeps, and the tides are but the heaving
of its breast. The stars swing slow, rocked in the great cradle of
the Heavens, and--"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, gently blew out Darcy's candle, and left him
sleeping.</p>

<p>Morning brought to Darcy a flood of hard common sense, as clear
and crisp as the sunshine that filled his room. Slowly as he woke he
gathered together the broken threads of the memories of the evening
which had ended, so he told himself, in a trick of common hypnotism.
That accounted for it all; the whole strange talk he had had was
under a spell of suggestion from the extraordinary vivid boy who had
once been a man; all his own excitement, his acceptance of the
incredible had been merely the effect of a stronger, more potent will
imposed on his own. How strong that will was, he guessed from his own
instantaneous obedience to Frank's suggestion of sleep. And armed
with impenetrable common sense he came down to breakfast. Frank had
already begun, and was consuming a large plateful of porridge and
milk with the most prosaic and healthy appetite.</p>

<p>"Slept well?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Where did you learn hypnotism?"</p>

<p>"By the side of the river."</p>

<p>"You talked an amazing quantity of nonsense last night," remarked
Darcy, in a voice prickly with reason.</p>

<p>"Rather. I felt quite giddy. Look, I remembered to order a
dreadful daily paper for you. You can read about money markets or
politics or cricket matches." Darcy looked at him closely. In the
morning light Frank looked even fresher, younger, more vital than he
had done the night before, and the sight of him somehow dinted
Darcy's armour of common sense.</p>

<p>"You are the most extraordinary fellow I ever saw," he said. "I
want to ask you some more questions."</p>

<p>"Ask away," said Frank.</p>

<p>For the next day or two Darcy plied his friend with many
questions, objections and criticisms on the theory of life, and
gradually got out of him a coherent and complete account of his
experience. In brief, then, Frank believed that "by lying naked," as
he put it, to the force which controls the passage of the stars, the
breaking of a wave, the budding of a tree, the love of a youth and
maiden, he had succeeded in a way hitherto undreamed of in possessing
himself of the essential principle of life. Day by day, so he
thought, he was getting nearer to, and in closer union with, the
great power itself which caused all life to be, the spirit of nature,
of force, or the spirit of God. For himself, he confessed to what
others would call paganism; it was sufficient for him that there
existed a principle of life. He did not worship it, he did not pray
to it, he did not praise it. Some of it existed in all human beings,
just as it existed in trees and animals; to realise and make living
to himself the fact that it was all one, was his sole aim and
object.</p>

<p>Here perhaps Darcy would put in a word of warning.</p>

<p>"Take care," he said. "To see Pan meant death, did it not."</p>

<p>Frank's eyebrows would rise at this.</p>

<p>"What does that matter?" he said. "True, the Greeks were always
right, and they said so, but there is another possibility. For the
nearer I get to it, the more living, the more vital and young I
become."</p>

<p>"What then do you expect the final revelation will do for
you?"</p>

<p>"I have told you," said he. "It will make me immortal."</p>

<p>But it was not so much from speech and argument that Darcy grew to
grasp his friend's conception, as from the ordinary conduct of his
life. They were passing, for instance, one morning down the village
street, when an old woman, very bent and decrepit, but with an
extraordinary cheerfulness of face, hobbled out from her cottage.
Frank instantly stopped when he saw her.</p>

<p>"You old darling! How goes it all?" he said.</p>

<p>But she did not answer, her dim old eyes were riveted on his face;
she seemed to drink in like a thirsty creature the beautiful radiance
which shone there. Suddenly she put her two withered old hands on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"You're just the sunshine itself," she said, and he kissed her and
passed on.</p>

<p>But scarcely a hundred yards further a strange contradiction of
such tenderness occurred. A child running along the path towards them
fell on its face and set up a dismal cry of fright and pain. A look
of horror came into Frank's eyes, and, putting his fingers in his
ears, he fled at full speed down the street, and did not pause till
he was out of hearing. Darcy, having ascertained that the child was
not really hurt, followed him in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Are you without pity then?" he asked. Frank shook his head
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Can't you see?" he asked. "Can't you understand that that sort of
thing, pain, anger, anything unlovely, throws me back, retards the
coming of the great hour! Perhaps when it comes I shall be able to
piece that side of life on to the other, on to the true religion of
joy. At present I can't."</p>

<p>"But the old woman. Was she not ugly?"</p>

<p>Frank's radiance gradually returned.</p>

<p>"Ah, no. She was like me. She longed for joy, and knew it when she
saw it, the old darling."</p>

<p>Another question suggested itself.</p>

<p>"Then what about Christianity?" asked Darcy.</p>

<p>"I can't accept it. I can't believe in any creed of which the
central doctrine is that God who is Joy should have had to suffer.
Perhaps it was so; in some inscrutable way I believe it may have been
so, but I don't understand how it was possible. So I leave it alone;
my affair is joy."</p>

<p>They had come to the weir above the village, and the thunder of
riotous cool water was heavy in the air. Trees dipped into the
translucent stream with slender trailing branches, and the meadow
where they stood was starred with midsummer blossomings. Larks shot
up carolling into the crystal dome of blue, and a thousand voices of
June sang round them. Frank, bare-headed as was his wont, with his
coat slung over his arm and his shirt sleeves rolled up above the
elbow, stood there like some beautiful wild animal with eyes
half-shut and mouth half-open, drinking in the scented warmth of the
air. Then suddenly he flung himself face downwards on the grass at
the edge of the stream, burying his face in the daisies and cowslips,
and lay stretched there in wide-armed ecstasy, with his long fingers
pressing and stroking the dewy herbs of the field. Never before had
Darcy seen him thus fully possessed by his idea; his caressing
fingers, his half-buried face pressed close to the grass, even the
clothed lines of his figure were instinct with a vitality that
somehow was different from that of other men. And some faint glow
from it reached Darcy, some thrill, some vibration from that charged
recumbent body passed to him, and for a moment he understood as he
had not understood before, despite his persistent questions and the
candid answers they received, how real, and how realised by Frank,
his idea was.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the muscles in Frank's neck became stiff and alert,
and he half-raised his head.</p>

<p>"The Pan-pipes, the Pan-pipes," he whispered. "Close, oh, so
close."</p>

<p>Very slowly, as if a sudden movement might interrupt the melody,
he raised himself and leaned on the elbow of his bent arm. His eyes
opened wider, the lower lids drooped as if he focussed his eyes on
something very far away, and the smile on his face broadened and
quivered like sunlight on still water, till the exultance of its
happiness was scarcely human. So he remained motionless and rapt for
some minutes, then the look of listening died from his face, and he
bowed his head, satisfied.</p>

<p>"Ah, that was good," he said. "How is it possible you did not
hear? Oh, you poor fellow! Did you really hear nothing?"</p>

<p>A week of this outdoor and stimulating life did wonders in
restoring to Darcy the vigour and health which his weeks of fever had
filched from him, and as his normal activity and higher pressure of
vitality returned, he seemed to himself to fall even more under the
spell which the miracle of Frank's youth cast over him. Twenty times
a day he found himself saying to himself suddenly at the end of some
ten minutes silent resistance to the absurdity of Frank's idea: "But
it isn't possible; it can't be possible," and from the fact of his
having to assure himself so frequently of this, he knew that he was
struggling and arguing with a conclusion which already had taken root
in his mind. For in any case a visible living miracle confronted him,
since it was equally impossible that this youth, this boy, trembling
on the verge of manhood, was thirty-five.</p>

<p>Yet such was the fact.</p>

<p>July was ushered in by a couple of days of blustering and fretful
rain, and Darcy, unwilling to risk a chill, kept to the house. But to
Frank this weeping change of weather seemed to have no bearing on the
behaviour of man, and he spent his days exactly as he did under the
suns of June, lying in his hammock, stretched on the dripping grass,
or making huge rambling excursions into the forest, the birds hopping
from tree to tree after him, to return in the evening, drenched and
soaked, but with the same unquenchable flame of joy burning within
him.</p>

<p>"Catch cold?" he would ask; "I've forgotten how to do it, I think
I suppose it makes one's body more sensible always to sleep
out-of-doors. People who live indoors always remind me of something
peeled and skinless."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you slept out-of-doors last night in that
deluge?" asked Darcy. "And where, may I ask?"</p>

<p>Frank thought a moment.</p>

<p>"I slept in the hammock till nearly dawn," he said. "For I
remember the light blinked in the east when I awoke. Then I
went--where did I go--oh, yes, to the meadow where the Pan-pipes
sounded so close a week ago. You were with me, do you remember? But I
always have a rug if it is wet."</p>

<p>And he went whistling upstairs.</p>

<p>Somehow that little touch, his obvious effort to recall where he
had slept, brought strangely home to Darcy the wonderful romance of
which he was the still half-incredulous beholder. Sleep till close on
dawn in a hammock, then the tramp--or probably scamper--underneath
the windy and weeping heavens to the remote and lonely meadow by the
weir! The picture of other such nights rose before him; Frank
sleeping perhaps by the bathing-place under the filtered twilight of
the stars, or the white blaze of moon-shine, a stir and awakening at
some dead hour, perhaps a space of silent wide-eyed thought, and then
awandering through the hushed woods to some other dormitory, alone
with his happiness, alone with the joy and the life that suffused and
enveloped him, without other thought or desire or aim except the
hourly and never-ceasing communion with the joy of nature.</p>

<p>They were in the middle of dinner that night, talking on
indifferent subjects, when Darcy suddenly broke off in the middle of
a sentence.</p>

<p>"I've got it," he said. "At last I've got it."</p>

<p>"Congratulate you," said Frank. "But what?"</p>

<p>"The radical unsoundness of your idea. It is this: 'All Nature
from highest to lowest is full, crammed full of suffering; every
living organism in Nature preys on another, yet in your aim to get
close to, to be one with Nature, you leave suffering altogether out;
you run away from it, you refuse to recognise it. And you are
waiting, you say, for the final revelation."</p>

<p>Frank's brow clouded slightly.</p>

<p>"Well," he asked, rather wearily.</p>

<p>"Cannot you guess then when the final revelation will be? In joy
you are supreme, I grant you that; I did not know a man could be so
master of it. You have learned perhaps practically all that Nature
can teach. And if, as you think, the final revelation is coming to
you, it will be the revelation of horror, suffering, death, pain in
all its hideous forms. Suffering does exist: you hate it and fear
it."</p>

<p>Frank held up his hand.</p>

<p>"Stop; let me think," he said.</p>

<p>There was silence for a long minute.</p>

<p>"That never struck me," he said at length. "It is possible that
what you suggest is true. Does the sight of Pan mean that, do you
think? Is it that Nature, take it altogether, suffers horribly,
suffers to a hideous inconceivable extent? Shall I be shown all the
suffering?" He got up and came round to where Darcy sat.</p>

<p>"If it is so, so be it," he said. "Because, my dear fellow, I am
near, so splendidly near to the final revelation. To-day the pipes
have sounded almost without pause. I have even heard the rustle in
the bushes, I believe, of Pan's coming. I have seen, yes, I saw
to-day, the bushes pushed aside as if by a hand, and piece of a face,
not human, peered through. But I was not frightened, at least I did
not run away this time."</p>

<p>He took a turn up to the window and back again.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is suffering all through," he said, "and I have left
it all out of my search. Perhaps, as you say, the revelation will be
that. And in that case, it will be good-bye. I have gone on one line.
I shall have gone too far along one road, without having explored the
other. But I can't go back now. I wouldn't if I could; not a step
would I retrace! In any case, whatever the revelation is, it will be
God. I'm sure of that."</p>

<p>The rainy weather soon passed, and with the return of the sun
Darcy again joined Frank in long rambling days. It grew
extraordinarily hotter, and with the fresh bursting of life, after
the rain, Frank's vitality seemed to blaze higher and higher. Then,
as is the habit of the English weather, one evening clouds began to
bank themselves up in the west, the sun went down in a glare of
coppery thunder-rack, and the whole earth broiling under an
unspeakable oppression and sultriness paused and panted for the
storm. After sunset the remote fires of lightning began to wink and
flicker on the horizon, but when bed-time came the storm seemed to
have moved no nearer, though a very low unceasing noise of thunder
was audible. Weary and oppressed by the stress of the day, Darcy fell
at once into a heavy uncomforting sleep.</p>

<p>He woke suddenly into full consciousness, with the din of some
appalling explosion of thunder in his ears, and sat up in bed with
racing heart. Then for a moment, as he recovered himself from the
panic-land which lies between sleeping and waking, there was silence,
except for the steady hissing of rain on the shrubs outside his
window. But suddenly that silence was shattered and shredded into
fragments by a scream from somewhere close at hand outside in the
black garden, a scream of supreme and despairing terror. Again and
once again it shrilled up, and then a babble of awful words was
interjected. A quivering sobbing voice that he knew said:</p>

<p>"My God, oh, my God; oh, Christ!"</p>

<p>And then followed a little mocking, bleating laugh. Then was
silence again; only the rain hissed on the shrubs.</p>

<p>All this was but the affair of a moment, and without pause either
to put on clothes or light a candle, Darcy was already fumbling at
his door-handle. Even as he opened it he met a terror-stricken face
outside, that of the man-servant who carried a light.</p>

<p>"Did you hear?" he asked.</p>

<p>The man's face was bleached to a dull shining whiteness. "Yes,
sir," he said. "It was the master's voice."</p>

<p>Together they hurried down the stairs and through the dining-room
where an orderly table for breakfast had already been laid, and out
on to the terrace. The rain for the moment had been utterly stayed,
as if the tap of the heavens had been turned off, and under the
lowering black sky, not quite dark, since the moon rode somewhere
serene behind the conglomerated thunder-clouds, Darcy stumbled into
the garden, followed by the servant with the candle. The monstrous
leaping shadow of himself was cast before him on the lawn; lost and
wandering odours of rose and lily and damp earth were thick about
him, but more pungent was some sharp and acrid smell that suddenly
reminded him of a certain chalet in which he had once taken refuge in
the Alps. In the blackness of the hazy light from the sky, and the
vague tossing of the candle behind him, he saw that the hammock in
which Frank so often lay was tenanted. A gleam of white shirt was
there, as if a man were sitting up in it, but across that there was
an obscure dark shadow, and as he approached the acrid odour grew
more intense.</p>

<p>He was now only some few yards away, when suddenly the black
shadow seemed to jump into the air, then came down with tappings of
hard hoofs on the brick path that ran down the pergola, and with
frolicsome skippings galloped off into the bushes. When that was gone
Darcy could see quite clearly that a shirted figure sat up in the
hammock. For one moment, from sheer terror of the unseen, he hung on
his step, and the servant joining him they walked together to the
hammock.</p>

<p>It was Frank. He was in shirt and trousers only, and he sat up
with braced arms. For one half-second he stared at them, his face a
mask of horrible contorted terror. His upper lip was drawn back so
that the gums of the teeth appeared, and his eyes were focussed not
on the two who approached him, but on something quite close to him;
his nostrils were widely expanded, as if he panted for breath, and
terror incarnate and repulsion and deathly anguish ruled dreadful
lines on his smooth cheeks and forehead. Then even as they looked the
body sank backwards, and the ropes of the hammock wheezed and
strained.</p>

<p>Darcy lifted him out and carried him indoors. Once he thought
there was a faint convulsive stir of the limbs that lay with so dead
a weight in his arms, but when they got inside, there was no trace of
life. But the look of supreme terror and agony of fear had gone from
his face, a boy tired with play but still smiling in his sleep was
the burden he laid on the floor. His eyes had closed, and the
beautiful mouth lay in smiling curves, even as when a few mornings
ago, in the meadow by the weir, it had quivered to the music of the
unheard melody of Pan's pipes. Then they looked further.</p>

<p>Frank had come back from his bathe before dinner that night in his
usual costume of shirt and trousers only. He had not dressed, and
during dinner, so Darcy remembered, he had rolled up the sleeves of
his shirt to above the elbow. Later, as they sat and talked after
dinner on the close sultriness of the evening, he had unbuttoned the
front of his shirt to let what little breath of wind there was play
on his skin. The sleeves were rolled up now, the front of the shirt
was unbuttoned, and on his arms and on the brown skin of his chest
were strange discolorations which grew momently more clear and
defined, till they saw that the marks were pointed prints, as if
caused by the hoofs of some monstrous goat that had leaped and
stamped upon him.</p>

<h2><a name="ch07"></a>The Bus-Conductor</h2>

<p>My friend, Hugh Grainger, and I had just returned from a two days'
visit in the country, where we had been staying in a house of
sinister repute which was supposed to be haunted by ghosts of a
peculiarly fearsome and truculent sort. The house itself was all that
such a house should be, Jacobean and oak-panelled, with long dark
passages and high vaulted rooms. It stood, also, very remote, and was
encompassed by a wood of sombre pines that muttered and whispered in
the dark, and all the time that we were there a southwesterly gale
with torrents of scolding rain had prevailed, so that by day and
night weird voices moaned and fluted in the chimneys, a company of
uneasy spirits held colloquy among the trees, and sudden tattoos and
tappings beckoned from the window-panes. But in spite of these
surroundings, which were sufficient in themselves, one would almost
say, to spontaneously generate occult phenomena, nothing of any
description had occurred. I am bound to add, also, that my own state
of mind was peculiarly well adapted to receive or even to invent the
sights and sounds we had gone to seek, for I was, I confess, during
the whole time that we were there, in a state of abject apprehension,
and lay awake both nights through hours of terrified unrest, afraid
of the dark, yet more afraid of what a lighted candle might show
me.</p>

<p>Hugh Grainger, on the evening after our return to town, had dined
with me, and after dinner our conversation, as was natural, soon came
back to these entrancing topics.</p>

<p>"But why you go ghost-seeking I cannot imagine," he said, "because
your teeth were chattering and your eyes starting out of your head
all the rime you were there, from sheer fright."</p>

<p>"Or do you like being frightened?"</p>

<p>Hugh, though generally intelligent, is dense in certain ways; this
is one of them.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, I like being frightened," I said. "I want to be
made to creep and creep and creep. Fear is the most absorbing and
luxurious of emotions. One forgets all else if one is afraid."</p>

<p>"Well, the fact that neither of us saw anything," he said,
"confirms what I have always believed."</p>

<p>"And what have you always believed?"</p>

<p>"That these phenomena are purely objective, not subjective, and
that one's state of mind has nothing to do with the perception that
perceives them, nor have circumstances or surroundings anything to do
with them either. Look at Osburton. It has had the reputation of
being a haunted house for years, and it certainly has all the
accessories of one. Look at yourself, too, with all your nerves on
edge, afraid to look round or light a candle for fear of seeing
something! Surely there was the right man in the right place then, if
ghosts are subjective."</p>

<p>He got up and lit a cigarette, and looking at him--Hugh is about
six feet high, and as broad as he is long--I felt a retort on my
lips, for I could not help my mind going back to a certain period in
his life, when, from some cause which, as far as I knew, he had never
told anybody, he had become a mere quivering mass of disordered
nerves. Oddly enough, at the same moment and for the first time, he
began to speak of it himself.</p>

<p>"You may reply that it was not worth my while to go either," he
said, "because I was so clearly the wrong man in the wrong place. But
I wasn't. You for all your apprehensions and expectancy have never
seen a ghost. But I have, though I am the last person in the world
you would have thought likely to do so, and, though my nerves are
steady enough again now, it knocked me all to bits."</p>

<p>He sat down again in his chair.</p>

<p>"No doubt you remember my going to bits," he said, "and since I
believe that I am sound again now, I should rather like to tell you
about it. But before I couldn't; I couldn't speak of it at all to
anybody. Yet there ought to have been nothing frightening about it;
what I saw was certainly a most useful and friendly ghost. But it
came from the shaded side of things; it looked suddenly out of the
night and the mystery with which life is surrounded.</p>

<p>"I want first to tell you quite shortly my theory about
ghost-seeing," he continued, "and I can explain it best by a simile,
an image. Imagine then that you and I and everybody in the world are
like people whose eye is directly opposite a little tiny hole in a
sheet of cardboard which is continually shifting and revolving and
moving about. Back to back with that sheet of cardboard is another,
which also, by laws of its own, is in perpetual but independent
motion. In it too there is another hole, and when, fortuitously it
would seem, these two holes, the one through which we are always
looking, and the other in the spiritual plane, come opposite one
another, we see through, and then only do the sights and sounds of
the spiritual world become visible or audible to us. With most people
these holes never come opposite each other during their life. But at
the hour of death they do, and then they remain stationary. That, I
fancy, is how we 'pass over.'</p>

<p>"Now, in some natures, these holes are comparatively large, and
are constantly coming into opposition. Clairvoyants, mediums are like
that. But, as far as I knew, I had no clairvoyant or mediumistic
powers at all. I therefore am the sort of person who long ago made up
his mind that he never would see a ghost. It was, so to speak, an
incalculable chance that my minute spy-hole should come into
opposition with the other. But it did: and it knocked me out of
time."</p>

<p>I had heard some such theory before, and though Hugh put it rather
picturesquely, there was nothing in the least convincing or practical
about it. It might be so, or again it might not.</p>

<p>"I hope your ghost was more original than your theory," said I, in
order to bring him to the point.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it was. You shall judge."</p>

<p>I put on more coal and poked up the fire. Hugh has got, so I have
always considered, a great talent for telling stories, and that sense
of drama which is so necessary for the narrator. Indeed, before now,
I have suggested to him that he should take this up as a profession,
sit by the fountain in Piccadilly Circus, when times are, as usual,
bad, and tell stories to the passers-by in the street, Arabian
fashion, for reward. The most part of mankind, I am aware, do not
like long stories, but to the few, among whom I number myself, who
really like to listen to lengthy accounts of experiences, Hugh is an
ideal narrator. I do not care for his theories, or for his similes,
but when it comes to facts, to things that happened, I like him to be
lengthy.</p>

<p>"Go on, please, and slowly," I said. "Brevity may be the soul of
wit, but it is the ruin of story-telling. I want to hear when and
where and how it all was, and what you had for lunch and where you
had dined and what--Hugh began:</p>

<p>"It was the 24th of June, just eighteen months ago," he said. "I
had let my flat, you may remember, and came up from the country to
stay with you for a week. We had dined alone here--"</p>

<p>I could not help interrupting.</p>

<p>"Did you see the ghost here?" I asked. "In this square little box
of a house in a modern street?"</p>

<p>"I was in the house when I saw it." I hugged myself in
silence.</p>

<p>"We had dined alone here in Graeme Street," he said, "and after
dinner I went out to some party, and you stopped at home. At dinner
your man did not wait, and when I asked where he was, you told me he
was ill, and, I thought, changed the subject rather abruptly.</p>

<p>"You gave me your latch-key when I went out, and on coming back, I
found you had gone to bed. There were, however, several letters for
me, which required answers. I wrote them there and then, and posted
them at the pillar-box opposite. So I suppose it was rather late when
I went upstairs.</p>

<p>"You had put me in the front room, on the third floor, overlooking
the street, a room which I thought you generally occupied yourself.
It was a very hot night, and though there had been a moon when I
started to my party, on my return the whole sky was cloud-covered,
and it both looked and felt as if we might have a thunderstorm before
morning. I was feeling very sleepy and heavy, and it was not till
after I had got into bed that I noticed by the shadows of the
window-frames on the blind that only one of the windows was open. But
it did not seem worth while to get out of bed in order to open it,
though I felt rather airless and uncomfortable, and I went to
sleep.</p>

<p>"What time it was when I awoke I do not know, but it was certainly
not yet dawn, and I never remember being conscious of such an
extraordinary stillness as prevailed. There was no sound either of
foot-passengers or wheeled traffic; the music of life appeared to be
absolutely mute. But now, instead of being sleepy and heavy, I felt,
though I must have slept an hour or two at most, since it was not yet
dawn, perfectly fresh and wide-awake, and the effort which had seemed
not worth making before, that of getting out of bed and opening the
other window, was quite easy now and I pulled up the blind, threw it
wide open, and leaned out, for somehow I parched and pined for air.
Even outside the oppression was very noticeable, and though, as you
know, I am not easily given to feel the mental effects of climate, I
was aware of an awful creepiness coming over me. I tried to analyse
it away, but without success; the past day had been pleasant, I
looked forward to another pleasant day to-morrow, and yet I was full
of some nameless apprehension. I felt, too, dreadfully lonely in this
stillness before the dawn.</p>

<p>"Then I heard suddenly and not very far away the sound of some
approaching vehicle; I could distinguish the tread of two horses
walking at a slow foot's pace. They were, though not yet visible,
coming up the street, and yet this indication of life did not abate
that dreadful sense of loneliness which I have spoken of. Also in
some dim unformulated way that which was coming seemed to me to have
something to do with the cause of my oppression.</p>

<p>"Then the vehicle came into sight. At first I could not
distinguish what it was. Then I saw that the horses were black and
had long tails, and that what they dragged was made of glass, but had
a black frame. It was a hearse. Empty.</p>

<p>"It was moving up this side of the street. It stopped at your
door.</p>

<p>"Then the obvious solution struck me. You had said at dinner that
your man was ill, and you were, I thought, unwilling to speak more
about his illness. No doubt, so I imagined now, he was dead, and for
some reason, perhaps because you did not want me to know anything
about it, you were having the body removed at night. This, I must
tell you, passed through my mind quite instantaneously, and it did
not occur to me how unlikely it really was, before the next thing
happened.</p>

<p>"I was still leaning out of the window, and I remember also
wondering, yet only momentarily, how odd it was that I saw things--or
rather the one thing I was looking at--so very distinctly. Of course,
there was a moon behind the clouds, but it was curious how every
detail of the hearse and the horses was visible. There was only one
man, the driver, with it, and the street was otherwise absolutely
empty. It was at him I was looking now. I could see every detail of
his clothes, but from where I was, so high above him, I could not see
his face. He had on grey trousers, brown boots, a black coat buttoned
all the way up, and a straw hat. Over his shoulder there was a strap,
which seemed to support some sort of little bag. He looked exactly
like--well, from my description what did he look exactly like?"</p>

<p>"Why--a bus-conductor," I said instantly.</p>

<p>"So I thought, and even while I was thinking this, he looked up at
me. He had a rather long thin face, and on his left cheek there was a
mole with a growth of dark hair on it. All this was as distinct as if
it had been noonday, and as if I was within a yard of him. But--so
instantaneous was all that takes so long in the telling--I had not
time to think it strange that the driver of a hearse should be so
unfunereally dressed.</p>

<p>"Then he touched his hat to me, and jerked his thumb over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"'Just room for one inside, sir,' he said.</p>

<p>"There was something so odious, so coarse, so unfeeling about this
that I instantly drew my head in, pulled the blind down again, and
then, for what reason I do not know, turned on the electric light in
order to see what time it was. The hands of my watch pointed to
half-past eleven.</p>

<p>"It was then for the first time, I think, that a doubt crossed my
mind as to the nature of what I had just seen. But I put out the
light again, got into bed, and began to think. We had dined; I had
gone to a party, I had come back and written letters, had gone to bed
and had slept. So how could it be half-past eleven?...Or--what
half-past eleven was it?</p>

<p>"Then another easy solution struck me; my watch must have stopped.
But it had not; I could hear it ticking.</p>

<p>"There was stillness and silence again. I expected every moment to
hear muffled footsteps on the stairs, footsteps moving slowly and
smally under the weight of a heavy burden, but from inside the house
there was no sound whatever. Outside, too, there was the same dead
silence, while the hearse waited at the door. And the minutes ticked
on and ticked on, and at length I began to see a difference in the
light in the room, and knew that the dawn was beginning to break
outside. But how had it happened, then, that if the corpse was to be
removed at night it had not gone, and that the hearse still waited,
when morning was already coming?</p>

<p>"Presently I got out of bed again, and with the sense of strong
physical shrinking I went to the window and pulled back the blind.
The dawn was coming fast; the whole street was lit by that silver
hueless light of morning. But there was no hearse there.</p>

<p>"Once again I looked at my watch. It was just a quarter-past four.
But I would swear that not half an hour had passed since it had told
me that it was half-past eleven.</p>

<p>"Then a curious double sense, as if I was living in the present
and at the same moment had been living in some other time, came over
me. It was dawn on June 25th, and the street, as natural, was empty.
But a little while ago the driver of a hearse had spoken to me, and
it was half-past eleven. What was that driver, to what plane did he
belong? And again what half-past eleven was it that I had seen
recorded on the dial of my watch?</p>

<p>"And then I told myself that the whole thing had been a dream. But
if you ask me whether I believed what I told myself, I must confess
that I did not.</p>

<p>"Your man did not appear at breakfast next morning, nor did I see
him again before I left that afternoon. I think if I had, I should
have told you about all this, but it was still possible, you see,
that what I had seen was a real hearse, driven by a real driver, for
all the ghastly gaiety of the face that had looked up to mine, and
the levity of his pointing hand. I might possibly have fallen asleep
soon after seeing him, and slumbered through the removal of the body
and the departure of the hearse. So I did not speak of it to
you.</p>

<p>There was something wonderfully straight-forward and prosaic in
all this; here were no Jacobean houses oak-panelled and surrounded by
weeping pine-trees, and somehow the very absence of suitable
surroundings made the story more impressive. But for a moment a doubt
assailed me.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me it was all a dream," I said.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether it was or not. I can only say that I believe
myself to have been wide awake. In any case the rest of the story
is--odd.</p>

<p>"I went out of town again that afternoon," he continued, "and I
may say that I don't think that even for a moment did I get the
haunting sense of what I had seen or dreamed that night out of my
mind. It was present to me always as some vision unfulfilled. It was
as if some clock had struck the four quarters, and I was still
waiting to hear what the hour would be.</p>

<p>"Exactly a month afterwards I was in London again, but only for
the day. I arrived at Victoria about eleven, and took the underground
to Sloane Square in order to see if you were in town and would give
me lunch. It was a baking hot morning, and I intended to take a bus
from the King's Road as far as Graeme Street. There was one standing
at the corner just as I came out of the station, but I saw that the
top was full, and the inside appeared to be full also. Just as I came
up to it the conductor, who, I suppose, had been inside, collecting
fares or what not, came out on to the step within a few feet of me.
He wore grey trousers, brown boots, a black coat buttoned, a straw
hat, and over his shoulder was a strap on which hung his little
machine for punching tickets. I saw his face, too; it was the face of
the driver of the hearse, with a mole on the left cheek. Then he
spoke to me, jerking his thumb over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"'Just room for one inside, sir,' he said.</p>

<p>"At that a sort of panic-terror took possession of me, and I knew
I gesticulated wildly with my arms, and cried, 'No, no!' But at that
moment I was living not in the hour that was then passing, but in
that hour which had passed a month ago, when I leaned from the window
of your bedroom here just before the dawn broke. At this moment too I
knew that my spy-hole had been opposite the spy-hole into the
spiritual world. What I had seen there had some significance, now
being fulfilled, beyond the significance of the trivial happenings of
to-day and to-morrow. The Powers of which we know so little were
visibly working before me. And I stood there on the pavement shaking
and trembling.</p>

<p>"I was opposite the post-office at the corner, and just as the bus
started my eye fell on the clock in the window there. I need not tell
you what the time was.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I need not tell you the rest, for you probably conjecture
it, since you will not have forgotten what happened at the corner of
Sloane Square at the end of July, the summer before last. The bus
pulled out from the pavement into the street in order to get round a
van that was standing in front of it. At the moment there came down
the King's Road a big motor going at a hideously dangerous pace. It
crashed full into the bus, burrowing into it as a gimlet burrows into
a board."</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"And that's my story," he said.</p>

<h2><a name="ch08"></a>Caterpillars</h2>

<p>I saw a month or two ago in an Italian paper that the Villa
Cascana, in which I once stayed, had been pulled down, and that a
manufactory of some sort was in process of erection on its site.</p>

<p>There is therefore no longer any reason for refraining from
writing of those things which I myself saw (or imagined I saw) in a
certain room and on a certain landing of the villa in question, nor
from mentioning the circumstances which followed, which may or may
not (according to the opinion of the reader) throw some light on or
be somehow connected with this experience.</p>

<p>The Villa Cascana was in all ways but one a perfectly delightful
house, yet, if it were standing now, nothing in the world--I use the
phrase in its literal sense--would induce me to set foot in it again,
for I believe it to have been haunted in a very terrible and
practical manner.</p>

<p>Most ghosts, when all is said and done, do not do much harm; they
may perhaps terrify, but the person whom they visit usually gets over
their visitation. They may on the other hand be entirely friendly and
beneficent. But the appearances in the Villa Cascana were not
beneficent, and had they made their "visit" in a very slightly
different manner, I do not suppose I should have got over it any more
than Arthur Inglis did.</p>

<p>The house stood on an ilex-clad hill not far from Sestri di
Levante on the Italian Riviera, looking out over the iridescent blues
of that enchanted sea, while behind it rose the pale green chestnut
woods that climb up the hillsides till they give place to the pines
that, black in contrast with them, crown the slopes. All round it the
garden in the luxuriance of mid-spring bloomed and was fragrant, and
the scent of magnolia and rose, borne on the salt freshness of the
winds from the sea, flowed like a stream through the cool vaulted
rooms.</p>

<p>On the ground floor a broad pillared loggia ran round three sides
of the house, the top of which formed a balcony for certain rooms of
the first floor. The main staircase, broad and of grey marble steps,
led up from the hall to the landing outside these rooms, which were
three in number, namely, two big sitting-rooms and a bedroom arranged
en suite. The latter was unoccupied, the sitting-rooms were in use.
From these the main staircase was continued to the second floor,
where were situated certain bedrooms, one of which I occupied, while
from the other side of the first-floor landing some half-dozen steps
led to another suite of rooms, where, at the time I am speaking of,
Arthur Inglis, the artist, had his bedroom and studio. Thus the
landing outside my bedroom at the top of the house commanded both the
landing of the first floor and also the steps that led to Inglis'
rooms. Jim Stanley and his wife, finally (whose guest I was),
occupied rooms in another wing of the house, where also were the
servants' quarters.</p>

<p>I arrived just in time for lunch on a brilliant noon of mid-May.
The garden was shouting with colour and fragrance, and not less
delightful after my broiling walk up from the marina, should have
been the coming from the reverberating heat and blaze of the day into
the marble coolness of the villa. Only (the reader has my bare word
for this, and nothing more), the moment I set foot in the house I
felt that something was wrong. This feeling, I may say, was quite
vague, though very strong, and I remember that when I saw letters
waiting for me on the table in the hall I felt certain that the
explanation was here: I was convinced that there was bad news of some
sort for me. Yet when I opened them I found no such explanation of my
premonition: my correspondents all reeked of prosperity. Yet this
clear miscarriage of a presentiment did not dissipate my uneasiness.
In that cool fragrant house there was something wrong.</p>

<p>I am at pains to mention this because to the general view it may
explain that though I am as a rule so excellent a sleeper that the
extinction of my light on getting into bed is apparently
contemporaneous with being called on the following morning, I slept
very badly on my first night in the Villa Cascana. It may also
explain the fact that when I did sleep (if it was indeed in sleep
that I saw what I thought I saw) I dreamed in a very vivid and
original manner, original, that is to say, in the sense that
something that, as far as I knew, had never previously entered into
my consciousness, usurped it then. But since, in addition to this
evil premonition, certain words and events occurring during the rest
of the day might have suggested something of what I thought happened
that night, it will be well to relate them.</p>

<p>After lunch, then, I went round the house with Mrs. Stanley, and
during our tour she referred, it is true, to the unoccupied bedroom
on the first floor, which opened out of the room where we had
lunched.</p>

<p>"We left that unoccupied," she said, "because Jim and I have a
charming bedroom and dressing-room, as you saw, in the wing, and if
we used it ourselves we should have to turn the dining-room into a
dressing-room and have our meals downstairs. As it is, however, we
have our little flat there, Arthur Inglis has his little flat in the
other passage; and I remembered (aren't I extraordinary?) that you
once said that the higher up you were in a house the better you were
pleased. So I put you at the top of the house, instead of giving you
that room."</p>

<p>It is true, that a doubt, vague as my uneasy premonition, crossed
my mind at this. I did not see why Mrs. Stanley should have explained
all this, if there had not been more to explain. I allow, therefore,
that the thought that there was something to explain about the
unoccupied bedroom was momentarily present to my mind.</p>

<p>The second thing that may have borne on my dream was this.</p>

<p>At dinner the conversation turned for a moment on ghosts. Inglis,
with the certainty of conviction, expressed his belief that anybody
who could possibly believe in the existence of supernatural phenomena
was unworthy of the name of an ass. The subject instantly dropped. As
far as I can recollect, nothing else occurred or was said that could
bear on what follows.</p>

<p>We all went to bed rather early, and personally I yawned my way
upstairs, feeling hideously sleepy. My room was rather hot, and I
threw all the windows wide, and from without poured in the white
light of the moon, and the love-song of many nightingales. I
undressed quickly, and got into bed, but though I had felt so sleepy
before, I now felt extremely wide-awake. But I was quite content to
be awake: I did not toss or turn, I felt perfectly happy listening to
the song and seeing the light. Then, it is possible, I may have gone
to sleep, and what follows may have been a dream. I thought, anyhow,
that after a time the nightingales ceased singing and the moon sank.
I thought also that if, for some unexplained reason, I was going to
lie awake all night, I might as well read, and I remembered that I
had left a book in which I was interested in the dining-room on the
first floor. So I got out of bed, lit a candle, and went downstairs.
I went into the room, saw on a side-table the book I had come to look
for, and then, simultaneously, saw that the door into the unoccupied
bedroom was open. A curious grey light, not of dawn nor of moonshine,
came out of it, and I looked in. The bed stood just opposite the
door, a big four-poster, hung with tapestry at the head. Then I saw
that the greyish light of the bedroom came from the bed, or rather
from what was on the bed. For it was covered with great caterpillars,
a foot or more in length, which crawled over it. They were faintly
luminous, and it was the light from them that showed me the room.
Instead of the sucker-feet of ordinary caterpillars they had rows of
pincers like crabs, and they moved by grasping what they lay on with
their pincers, and then sliding their bodies forward. In colour these
dreadful insects were yellowish-grey, and they were covered with
irregular lumps and swellings. There must have been hundreds of them,
for they formed a sort of writhing, crawling pyramid on the bed.
Occasionally one fell off on to the floor, with a soft fleshy thud,
and though the floor was of hard concrete, it yielded to the
pincerfeet as if it had been putty, and, crawling back, the
caterpillar would mount on to the bed again, to rejoin its fearful
companions. They appeared to have no faces, so to speak, but at one
end of them there was a mouth that opened sideways in
respiration.</p>

<p>Then, as I looked, it seemed to me as if they all suddenly became
conscious of my presence.</p>

<p>All the mouths, at any rate, were turned in my direction, and next
moment they began dropping off the bed with those soft fleshy thuds
on to the floor, and wriggling towards me. For one second a paralysis
as of a dream was on me, but the next I was running upstairs again to
my room, and I remember feeling the cold of the marble steps on my
bare feet. I rushed into my bedroom, and slammed the door behind me,
and then--I was certainly wide-awake now--I found myself standing by
my bed with the sweat of terror pouring from me. The noise of the
banged door still rang in my ears. But, as would have been more
usual, if this had been mere nightmare, the terror that had been mine
when I saw those foul beasts crawling about the bed or dropping
softly on to the floor did not cease then. Awake, now, if dreaming
before, I did not at all recover from the horror of dream: it did not
seem to me that I had dreamed. And until dawn, I sat or stood, not
daring to lie down, thinking that every rustle or movement that I
heard was the approach of the caterpillars. To them and the claws
that bit into the cement the wood of the door was child's play: steel
would not keep them out.</p>

<p>But with the sweet and noble return of day the horror vanished:
the whisper of wind became benignant again: the nameless fear,
whatever it was, was smoothed out and terrified me no longer. Dawn
broke, hueless at first; then it grew dove-coloured, then the flaming
pageant of light spread over the sky.</p>

<p>The admirable rule of the house was that everybody had breakfast
where and when he pleased, and in consequence it was not till
lunch-time that I met any of the other members of our party, since I
had breakfast on my balcony, and wrote letters and other things till
lunch. In fact, I got down to that meal rather late, after the other
three had begun. Between my knife and fork there was a small pill-box
of cardboard, and as I sat down Inglis spoke.</p>

<p>"Do look at that," he said, "since you are interested in natural
history. I found it crawling on my counterpane last night, and I
don't know what it is."</p>

<p>I think that before I opened the pill-box I expected something of
the sort which I found in it.</p>

<p>Inside it, anyhow, was a small caterpillar, greyish-yellow in
colour, with curious bumps and excrescences on its rings. It was
extremely active, and hurried round the box, this way and that.</p>

<p>Its feet were unlike the feet of any caterpillar I ever saw: they
were like the pincers of a crab. I looked, and shut the lid down
again.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know it," I said, "but it looks rather unwholesome.
What are you going to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall keep it," said Inglis. "It has begun to spin: I want
to see what sort of a moth it turns into."</p>

<p>I opened the box again, and saw that these hurrying movements were
indeed the beginning of the spinning of the web of its cocoon. Then
Inglis spoke again.</p>

<p>"It has got funny feet, too," he said. "They are like crabs'
pincers. What's the Latin for crab?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Cancer. So in case it is unique, let's christen it:
'Cancer Inglisensis.'" Then something happened in my brain, some
momentary piecing together of all that I had seen or dreamed.
Something in his words seemed to me to throw light on it all, and my
own intense horror at the experience of the night before linked
itself on to what he had just said. In effect, I took the box and
threw it, caterpillar and all, out of the window. There was a gravel
path just outside, and beyond it, a fountain playing into a basin.
The box fell on to the middle of this.</p>

<p>Inglis laughed.</p>

<p>"So the students of the occult don't like solid facts," he said.
"My poor caterpillar!"</p>

<p>The talk went off again at once on to other subjects, and I have
only given in detail, as they happened, these trivialities in order
to be sure myself that I have recorded everything that could have
borne on occult subjects or on the subject of caterpillars. But at
the moment when I threw the pill-box into the fountain, I lost my
head: my only excuse is that, as is probably plain, the tenant of it
was, in miniature, exactly what I had seen crowded on to the bed in
the unoccupied room. And though this translation of those phantoms
into flesh and blood--or whatever it is that caterpillars are made
of--ought perhaps to have relieved the horror of the night, as a
matter of fact it did nothing of the kind. It only made the crawling
pyramid that covered the bed in the unoccupied room more hideously
real.</p>

<p>After lunch we spent a lazy hour or two strolling about the garden
or sitting in the loggia, and it must have been about four o'clock
when Stanley and I started off to bathe, down the path that led by
the fountain into which I had thrown the pill-box. The water was
shallow and clear, and at the bottom of it I saw its white remains.
The water had disintegrated the cardboard, and it had become no more
than a few strips and shreds of sodden paper. The centre of the
fountain was a marble Italian Cupid which squirted the water out of a
wine-skin held under its arm. And crawling up its leg was the
caterpillar. Strange and scarcely credible as it seemed, it must have
survived the falling-to-bits of its prison, and made its way to
shore, and there it was, out of arm's reach, weaving and waving this
way and that as it evolved its cocoon.</p>

<p>Then, as I looked at it, it seemed to me again that, like the
caterpillar I had seen last night, it saw me, and breaking out of the
threads that surrounded it, it crawled down the marble leg of the
Cupid and began swimming like a snake across the water of the
fountain towards me. It came with extraordinary speed (the fact of a
caterpillar being able to swim was new to me), and in another moment
was crawling up the marble lip of the basin. Just then Inglis joined
us.</p>

<p>"Why, if it isn't old 'Cancer Inglisensis' again," he said,
catching sight of the beast. "What a tearing hurry it is in!"</p>

<p>We were standing side by side on the path, and when the
caterpillar had advanced to within about a yard of us, it stopped,
and began waving again as if in doubt as to the direction in which it
should go. Then it appeared to make up its mind, and crawled on to
Inglis' shoe.</p>

<p>"It likes me best," he said, "but I don't really know that I like
it. And as it won't drown I think perhaps--"</p>

<p>He shook it off his shoe on to the gravel path and trod on it.</p>

<p>All afternoon the air got heavier and heavier with the Sirocco
that was without doubt coming up from the south, and that night again
I went up to bed feeling very sleepy; but below my drowsiness, so to
speak, there was the consciousness, stronger than before, that there
was something wrong in the house, that something dangerous was close
at hand. But I fell asleep at once, and--how long after I do not
know--either woke or dreamed I awoke, feeling that I must get up at
once, or I should be too late. Then (dreaming or awake) I lay and
fought this fear, telling myself that I was but the prey of my own
nerves disordered by Sirocco or what not, and at the same time quite
clearly knowing in another part of my mind, so to speak, that every
moment's delay added to the danger. At last this second feeling
became irresistible, and I put on coat and trousers and went out of
my room on to the landing. And then I saw that I had already delayed
too long, and that I was now too late.</p>

<p>The whole of the landing of the first floor below was invisible
under the swarm of caterpillars that crawled there. The folding doors
into the sitting-room from which opened the bedroom where I had seen
them last night were shut, but they were squeezing through the cracks
of it and dropping one by one through the keyhole, elongating
themselves into mere string as they passed, and growing fat and lumpy
again on emerging. Some, as if exploring, were nosing about the steps
into the passage at the end of which were Inglis' rooms, others were
crawling on the lowest steps of the staircase that led up to where I
stood. The landing, however, was completely covered with them: I was
cut off. And of the frozen horror that seized me when I saw that I
can give no idea in words.</p>

<p>Then at last a general movement began to take place, and they grew
thicker on the steps that led to Inglis' room. Gradually, like some
hideous tide of flesh, they advanced along the passage, and I saw the
foremost, visible by the pale grey luminousness that came from them,
reach his door. Again and again I tried to shout and warn him, in
terror all the time that they would turn at the sound of my voice and
mount my stair instead, but for all my efforts I felt that no sound
came from my throat. They crawled along the hinge-crack of his door,
passing through as they had done before, and still I stood there,
making impotent efforts to shout to him, to bid him escape while
there was time.</p>

<p>At last the passage was completely empty: they had all gone, and
at that moment I was conscious for the first time of the cold of the
marble landing on which I stood barefooted. The dawn was just
beginning to break in the Eastern sky.</p>

<p>Six months after I met Mrs. Stanley in a country house in England.
We talked on many subjects and at last she said:</p>

<p>"I don't think I have seen you since I got that dreadful news
about Arthur Inglis a month ago."</p>

<p>"I haven't heard," said I.</p>

<p>"No? He has got cancer. They don't even advise an operation, for
there is no hope of a cure: he is riddled with it, the doctors
say."</p>

<p>Now during all these six months I do not think a day had passed on
which I had not had in my mind the dreams (or whatever you like to
call them) which I had seen in the Villa Cascana.</p>

<p>"It is awful, is it not?" she continued, "and I feel I can't help
feeling, that he may have--"</p>

<p>"Caught it at the villa?" I asked.</p>

<p>She looked at me in blank surprise.</p>

<p>"Why did you say that?" she asked. "How did you know?"</p>

<p>Then she told me. In the unoccupied bedroom a year before there
had been a fatal case of cancer. She had, of course, taken the best
advice and had been told that the utmost dictates of prudence would
be obeyed so long as she did not put anybody to sleep in the room,
which had also been thoroughly disinfected and newly white-washed and
painted. But--</p>

<h2><a name="ch09"></a>And the Dead Spake</h2>

<p>There is not in all London a quieter spot, or one, apparently,
more withdrawn from the heat and bustle of life than Newsome Terrace.
It is a cul-de-sac, for at the upper end the roadway between its two
lines of square, compact little residences is brought to an end by a
high brick wall, while at the lower end, the only access to it is
through Newsome Square, that small discreet oblong of Georgian
houses, a relic of the time when Kensington was a suburban village
sundered from the metropolis by a stretch of pastures stretching to
the river. Both square and terrace are most inconveniently situated
for those whose ideal environment includes a rank of taxicabs
immediately opposite their door, a spate of 'buses roaring down the
street, and a procession of underground trains, accessible by a
station a few yards away, shaking and rattling the cutlery and silver
on their dining tables. In consequence Newsome Terrace had come, two
years ago, to be inhabited by leisurely and retired folk or by those
who wished to pursue their work in quiet and tranquillity. Children
with hoops and scooters are phenomena rarely encountered in the
Terrace and dogs are equally uncommon.</p>

<p>In front of each of the couple of dozen houses of which the
Terrace is composed lies a little square of railinged garden, in
which you may often see the middle-aged or elderly mistress of the
residence horticulturally employed. By five o'clock of a winter's
evening the pavements will generally be empty of all passengers
except the policeman, who with felted step, at intervals throughout
the night, peers with his bull's-eye into these small front gardens,
and never finds anything more suspicious there than an early crocus
or an aconite. For by the time it is dark the inhabitants of the
Terrace have got themselves home, where behind drawn curtains and
bolted shutters they will pass a domestic and uninterrupted evening.
No funeral (up to the time I speak of) had I ever seen leave the
Terrace, no marriage party had strewed its pavements with confetti,
and perambulators were unknown. It and its inhabitants seemed to be
quietly mellowing like bottles of sound wine. No doubt there was
stored within them the sunshine and summer of youth long past, and
now, dozing in a cool place, they waited for the turn of the key in
the cellar door, and the entry of one who would draw them forth and
see what they were worth.</p>

<p>Yet, after the time of which I shall now speak, I have never
passed down its pavement without wondering whether each house, so
seemingly-tranquil, is not, like some dynamo, softly and smoothly
bringing into being vast and terrible forces, such as those I once
saw at work in the last house at the upper end of the Terrace, the
quietest, you would have said, of all the row. Had you observed it
with continuous scrutiny, for all the length of a summer day, it is
quite possible that you might have only seen issue from it in the
morning an elderly woman whom you would have rightly conjectured to
be the housekeeper, with her basket for marketing on her arm, who
returned an hour later. Except for her the entire day might often
pass without there being either ingress or egress from the door.
Occasionally a middle-aged man, lean and wiry, came swiftly down the
pavement, but his exit was by no means a daily occurrence, and indeed
when he did emerge, he broke the almost universal usage of the
Terrace, for his appearances took place, when such there were,
between nine and ten in the evening. At that hour sometimes he would
come round to my house in Newsome Square to see if I was at home and
inclined for a talk a little later on. For the sake of air and
exercise he would then have an hour's tramp through the lit and noisy
streets, and return about ten, still pale and unflushed, for one of
those talks which grew to have an absorbing fascination for me. More
rarely through the telephone I proposed that I should drop in on him:
this I did not often do, since I found that if he did not come out
himself, it implied that he was busy with some investigation, and
though he made me welcome, I could easily see that he burned for my
departure, so that he might get busy with his batteries and pieces of
tissue, hot on the track of discoveries that never yet had presented
themselves to the mind of man as coming within the horizon of
possibility.</p>

<p>My last sentence may have led the reader to guess that I am indeed
speaking of none other than that recluse and mysterious physicist Sir
James Horton, with whose death a hundred half-hewn avenues into the
dark forest from which life comes must wait completion till another
pioneer as bold as he takes up the axe which hitherto none but
himself has been able to wield.</p>

<p>Probably there was never a man to whom humanity owed more, and of
whom humanity knew less. He seemed utterly independent of the race to
whom (though indeed with no service of love) he devoted himself: for
years he lived aloof and apart in his house at the end of the
Terrace.</p>

<p>Men and women were to him like fossils to the geologist, things to
be tapped and hammered and dissected and studied with a view not only
to the reconstruction of past ages, but to construction in the
future. It is known, for instance, that he made an artificial being
formed of the tissue, still living, of animals lately killed, with
the brain of an ape and the heart of a bullock, and a sheep's
thyroid, and so forth. Of that I can give no first-hand account;
Horton, it is true, told me something about it, and in his will
directed that certain memoranda on the subject should on his death be
sent to me. But on the bulky envelope there is the direction, "Not to
be opened till January, 1925." He spoke with some reserve and, so I
think, with slight horror at the strange things which had happened on
the completion of this creature. It evidently made him uncomfortable
to talk about it, and for that reason I fancy he put what was then a
rather remote date to the day when his record should reach my eye.
Finally, in these preliminaries, for the last five years before the
war, he had scarcely entered, for the sake of companionship, any
house other than his own and mine. Ours was a friendship dating from
school-days, which he had never suffered to drop entirely, but I
doubt if in those years he spoke except on matters of business to
half a dozen other people. He had already retired from surgical
practice in which his skill was unapproached, and most completely now
did he avoid the slightest intercourse with his colleagues, whom he
regarded as ignorant pedants without courage or the rudiments of
knowledge. Now and then he would write an epoch-making little
monograph, which he flung to them like a bone to a starving dog, but
for the most part, utterly absorbed in his own investigations, he
left them to grope along unaided. He frankly told me that he enjoyed
talking to me about such subjects, since I was utterly unacquainted
with them. It clarified his mind to be obliged to put his theories
and guesses and confirmations with such simplicity that anyone could
understand them.</p>

<p>I well remember his coming in to see me on the evening of the 4th
of August, 1914.</p>

<p>"So the war has broken out," he said, "and the streets are
impassable with excited crowds."</p>

<p>"Odd, isn't it? Just as if each of us already was not a far more
murderous battlefield than any which can be conceived between warring
nations."</p>

<p>"How's that?" said I.</p>

<p>"Let me try to put it plainly, though it isn't that I want to talk
about. Your blood is one eternal battlefield. It is full of armies
eternally marching and counter-marching. As long as the armies
friendly to you are in a superior position, you remain in good
health; if a detachment of microbes that, if suffered to establish
themselves, would give you a cold in the head, entrench themselves in
your mucous membrane, the commander-in-chief sends a regiment down
and drives them out. He doesn't give his orders from your brain, mind
you--those aren't his headquarters, for your brain knows nothing
about the landing of the enemy till they have made good their
position and given you a cold."</p>

<p>He paused a moment.</p>

<p>"There isn't one headquarters inside you," he said, "there are
many. For instance, I killed a frog this morning; at least most
people would say I killed it. But had I killed it, though its head
lay in one place and its severed body in another? Not a bit: I had
only killed a piece of it. For I opened the body afterwards and took
out the heart, which I put in a sterilised chamber of suitable
temperature, so that it wouldn't get cold or be infected by any
microbe. That was about twelve o'clock to-day. And when I came out
just now, the heart was beating still. It was alive, in fact."</p>

<p>"That's full of suggestions, you know. Come and see it."</p>

<p>The Terrace had been stirred into volcanic activity by the news of
war: the vendor of some late edition had penetrated into its
quietude, and there were half a dozen parlour-maids fluttering about
like black and white moths. But once inside Horton's door isolation
as of an Arctic night seemed to close round me. He had forgotten his
latch-key, but his housekeeper, then newly come to him, who became so
regular and familiar a figure in the Terrace, must have heard his
step, for before he rang the bell she had opened the door, and stood
with his forgotten latch-key in her hand.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Mrs. Gabriel," said he, and without a sound the door shut
behind us. Both her name and face, as reproduced in some illustrated
daily paper, seemed familiar, rather terribly familiar, but before I
had time to grope for the association, Horton supplied it.</p>

<p>"Tried for the murder of her husband six months ago," he said.
"Odd case. The point is that she is the one and perfect housekeeper.
I once had four servants, and everything was all mucky, as we used to
say at school. Now I live in amazing comfort and propriety with one.
She does everything. She is cook, valet, housemaid, butler, and won't
have anyone to help her. No doubt she killed her husband, but she
planned it so well that she could not be convicted. She told me quite
frankly who she was when I engaged her."</p>

<p>Of course I remembered the whole trial vividly now. Her husband, a
morose, quarrelsome fellow, tipsy as often as sober, had, according
to the defence cut his own throat while shaving; according to the
prosecution, she had done that for him. There was the usual
discrepancy of evidence as to whether the wound could have been
self-inflicted, and the prosecution tried to prove that the face had
been lathered after his throat had been cut. So singular an
exhibition of forethought and nerve had hurt rather than helped their
case, and after prolonged deliberation on the part of the jury, she
had been acquitted. Yet not less singular was Horton's selection of a
probable murderess, however efficient, as housekeeper.</p>

<p>He anticipated this reflection.</p>

<p>"Apart from the wonderful comfort of having a perfectly appointed
and absolutely silent house," he said, "I regard Mrs. Gabriel as a
sort of insurance against my being murdered. If you had been tried
for your life, you would take very especial care not to find yourself
in suspicious proximity to a murdered body again: no more deaths in
your house, if you could help it. Come through to my laboratory, and
look at my little instance of life after death."</p>

<p>Certainly it was amazing to see that little piece of tissue still
pulsating with what must be called life; it contracted and expanded
faintly indeed but perceptibly, though for nine hours now it had been
severed from the rest of the organisation. All by itself it went on
living, and if the heart could go on living with nothing, you would
say, to feed and stimulate its energy, there must also, so reasoned
Horton, reside in all the other vital organs of the body other
independent focuses of life.</p>

<p>"Of course a severed organ like that," he said, "will run down
quicker than if it had the co-operation of the others, and presently
I shall apply a gentle electric stimulus to it. If I can keep that
glass bowl under which it beats at the temperature of a frog's body,
in sterilised air, I don't see why it should not go on living.
Food--of course there's the question of feeding it. Do you see what
that opens up in the way of surgery? Imagine a shop with glass cases
containing healthy organs taken from the dead. Say a man dies of
pneumonia. He should, as soon as ever the breath is out of his body,
be dissected, and though they would, of course, destroy his lungs, as
they will he full of pneumococci, his liver and digestive organs are
probably healthy. Take them out, keep them in a sterilised atmosphere
with the temperature at 98.4, and sell the liver, let us say, to
another poor devil who has cancer there. Fit him with a new healthy
liver, eh?"</p>

<p>"And insert the brain of someone who has died of heart disease
into the skull of a congenital idiot?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps; but the brain's tiresomely complicated in its
connections and the joining up of the nerves, you know. Surgery will
have to learn a lot before it fits new brains in. And the brain has
got such a lot of functions. All thinking, all inventing seem to
belong to it, though, as you have seen, the heart can get on quite
well without it. But there are other functions of the brain I want to
study first. I've been trying some experiments already."</p>

<p>He made some little readjustment to the flame of the spirit lamp
which kept at the right temperature the water that surrounded the
sterilised receptacle in which the frog's heart was beating.</p>

<p>"Start with the more simple and mechanical uses of the brain," he
said. "Primarily it is a sort of record office, a diary. Say that I
rap your knuckles with that ruler. What happens? The nerves there
send a message to the brain, of course, saying--how can I put it most
simply--saying, 'Somebody is hurting me.' And the eye sends another,
saying 'I perceive a ruler hitting my knuckles,' and the ear sends
another, saying 'I hear the rap of it.' But leaving all that alone,
what else happens? Why, the brain records it. It makes a note of your
knuckles having been hit."</p>

<p>He had been moving about the room as he spoke, taking off his coat
and waistcoat and putting on in their place a thin black
dressing-gown, and by now he was seated in his favourite attitude
cross-legged on the hearth-rug, looking like some magician or perhaps
the afrit which a magician of black arts had caused to appear. He was
thinking intently now, passing through his fingers his string of
amber beads, and talking more to himself than to me.</p>

<p>"And how does it make that note?" he went on. "Why, in the manner
in which phonograph records are made. There are millions of minute
dots, depressions, pockmarks on your brain which certainly record
what you remember, what you have enjoyed or disliked, or done or
said."</p>

<p>"The surface of the brain anyhow is large enough to furnish
writing-paper for the record of all these things, of all your
memories. If the impression of an experience has not been acute, the
dot is not sharply impressed, and the record fades: in other words,
you come to forget it. But if it has been vividly impressed, the
record is never obliterated. Mrs. Gabriel, for instance, won't lose
the impression of how she lathered her husband's face after she had
cut his throat. That's to say, if she did it.</p>

<p>"Now do you see what I'm driving at? Of course you do. There is
stored within a man's head the complete record of all the memorable
things he has done and said: there are all his thoughts there, and
all his speeches, and, most well-marked of all, his habitual thoughts
and the things he has often said; for habit, there is reason to
believe, wears a sort of rut in the brain, so that the life
principle, whatever it is, as it gropes and steals about the brain,
is continually stumbling into it..There's your record, your
gramophone plate all ready. What we want, and what I'm trying to
arrive at, is a needle which, as it traces its minute way over these
dots, will come across words or sentences which the dead have
uttered, and will reproduce them. My word, what Judgment Books! What
a resurrection!"</p>

<p>Here in this withdrawn situation no remotest echo of the
excitement which was seething through the streets penetrated; through
the open window there came in only the tide of the midnight silence.
But from somewhere closer at hand, through the wall surely of the
laboratory, there came a low, somewhat persistent murmur.</p>

<p>"Perhaps our needle--unhappily not yet invented--as it passed over
the record of speech in the brain, might induce even facial
expression," he said. "Enjoyment or horror might even pass over dead
features. There might be gestures and movements even, as the words
were reproduced in our gramophone of the dead. Some people when they
want to think intensely walk about: some, there's an instance of it
audible now, talk to themselves aloud."</p>

<p>He held up his finger for silence.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's Mrs. Gabriel," he said. "She talks to herself by the
hour together. She's always done that, she tells me. I shouldn't
wonder if she has plenty to talk about."</p>

<p>It was that night when, first of all, the notion of intense
activity going on below the placid house-fronts of the Terrace
occurred to me. None looked more quiet than this, and yet there was
seething here a volcanic activity and intensity of living, both in
the man who sat cross-legged on the floor and behind that voice just
audible through the partition wall. But I thought of that no more,
for Horton began speaking of the brain-gramophone again...Were it
possible to trace those infinitesimal dots and pock-marks in the
brain by some needle exquisitely fine, it might follow that by the
aid of some such contrivance as translated the pock-marks on a
gramophone record into sound, some audible rendering of speech might
be recovered from the brain of a dead man. It was necessary, so he
pointed out to me, that this strange gramophone record should be new;
it must be that of one lately dead, for corruption and decay would
soon obliterate these infinitesimal markings. He was not of opinion
that unspoken thought could be thus recovered: the utmost he hoped
for from his pioneering work was to be able to recapture actual
speech, especially when such speech had habitually dwelt on one
subject, and thus had worn a rut on that part of the brain known the
speech-centre.</p>

<p>"Let me get, for instance," he said, "the brain of a railway
porter, newly dead, who has been accustomed for years to call out the
name of a station, and I do not despair of hearing his voice through
my gramophone trumpet. Or again, given that Mrs. Gabriel, in all her
interminable conversations with herself, talks about one subject, I
might, in similar circumstances, recapture what she had been
constantly saying. Of course my instrument must be of a power and
delicacy still unknown, one of which the needle can trace the
minutest irregularities of surface, and of which the trumpet must be
of immense magnifying power, able to translate the smallest whisper
into a shout. But just as a microscope will show you the details of
an object invisible to the eye, so there are instruments which act in
the same way on sound. Here, for instance, is one of remarkable
magnifying power. Try it if you like."</p>

<p>He took me over to a table on which was standing an electric
battery connected with a round steel globe, out of the side of which
sprang a gramophone trumpet of curious construction. He adjusted the
battery, and directed me to click my fingers quite gently opposite an
aperture in the globe, and the noise, ordinarily scarcely audible,
resounded through the room like a thunderclap.</p>

<p>"Something of that sort might permit us to hear the record on a
brain," he said. After this night my visits to Horton became far more
common than they had hitherto been.</p>

<p>Having once admitted me into the region of his strange
explorations, he seemed to welcome me there. Partly, as he had said,
it clarified his own thought to put it into simple language, partly,
as he subsequently admitted, he was beginning to penetrate into such
lonely fields of knowledge by paths so utterly untrodden, that even
he, the most aloof and independent of mankind, wanted some human
presence near him. Despite his utter indifference to the issues of
the war--for, in his regard, issues far more crucial demanded his
energies--he offered himself as surgeon to a London hospital for
operations on the brain, and his services, naturally, were welcomed,
for none brought knowledge or skill like his to such work. Occupied
all day, he performed miracles of healing, with bold and dexterous
excisions which none but he would have dared to attempt. He would
operate, often successfully, for lesions that seemed certainly fatal,
and all the time he was learning. He refused to accept any salary; he
only asked, in cases where he had removed pieces of brain matter, to
take these away, in order by further examination and dissection, to
add to the knowledge and manipulative skill which he devoted to the
wounded. He wrapped these morsels in sterilised lint, and took them
back to the Terrace in a box, electrically heated to maintain the
normal temperature of a man's blood. His fragment might then, so he
reasoned, keep some sort of independent life of its own, even as the
severed heart of a frog had continued to beat for hours without
connection with the rest of the body. Then for half the night he
would continue to work on these sundered pieces of tissue scarcely
dead, which his operations during the day had given him.
Simultaneously, he was busy over the needle that must be of such
infinite delicacy.</p>

<p>One evening, fatigued with a long day's work, I had just heard
with a certain tremor of uneasy anticipation the whistles of warning
which heralded an air-raid, when my telephone bell rang. My servants,
according to custom, had already betaken themselves to the cellar,
and I went to see what the summons was, determined in any case not to
go out into the streets. I recognised Horton's voice. "I want you at
once," he said.</p>

<p>"But the warning whistles have gone," said I. "And I don't like
showers of shrapnel."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind that," said he. "You must come. I'm so excited
that I distrust the evidence of my own ears. I want a witness. Just
come."</p>

<p>He did not pause for my reply, for I heard the click of his
receiver going back into its place.</p>

<p>Clearly he assumed that I was coming, and that I suppose had the
effect of suggestion on my mind. I told myself that I would not go,
but in a couple of minutes his certainty that I was coming, coupled
with the prospect of being interested in something else than
air-raids, made me fidget in my chair and eventually go to the street
door and look out. The moon was brilliantly bright, the square quite
empty, and far away the coughings of very distant guns. Next moment,
almost against my will, I was running down the deserted pavements of
Newsome Terrace. My ring at his bell was answered by Horton, before
Mrs. Gabriel could come to the door, and he positively dragged me
in.</p>

<p>"I shan't tell you a word of what I am doing," he said. "I want
you to tell me what you hear. Come into the laboratory."</p>

<p>The remote guns were silent again as I sat myself, as directed, in
a chair close to the gramophone trumpet, but suddenly through the
wall I heard the familiar mutter of Mrs. Gabriel's voice. Horton,
already busy with his battery, sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"That won't do," he said. "I want absolute silence."</p>

<p>He went out of the room, and I heard him calling to her. While he
was gone I observed more closely what was on the table. Battery,
round steel globe, and gramophone trumpet were there, and some sort
of a needle on a spiral steel spring linked up with the battery and
the glass vessel, in which I had seen the frog's heart beat. In it
now there lay a fragment of grey matter.</p>

<p>Horton came back in a minute or two, and stood in the middle of
the room listening.</p>

<p>"That's better," he said. "Now I want you to listen at the mouth
of the trumpet. I'll answer any questions afterwards."</p>

<p>With my ear turned to the trumpet, I could see nothing of what he
was doing, and I listened till the silence became a rustling in my
ears. Then suddenly that rustling ceased, for it was overscored by a
whisper which undoubtedly came from the aperture on which my aural
attention was fixed. It was no more than the faintest murmur, and
though no words were audible, it had the timbre of a human voice.</p>

<p>"Well, do you hear anything?" asked Horton.</p>

<p>"Yes, something very faint, scarcely audible."</p>

<p>"Describe it," said he.</p>

<p>"Somebody whispering."</p>

<p>"I'll try a fresh place," said he.</p>

<p>The silence descended again; the mutter of the distant guns was
still mute, and some slight creaking from my shirt front, as I
breathed, alone broke it. And then the whispering from the gramophone
trumpet began again, this time much louder than it had been
before--it was as if the speaker (still whispering) had advanced a
dozen yards--but still blurred and indistinct.</p>

<p>More unmistakable, too, was it that the whisper was that of a
human voice, and every now and then, whether fancifully or not, I
thought I caught a word or two. For a moment it was silent
altogether, and then with a sudden inkling of what I was listening to
I heard something begin to sing. Though the words were still
inaudible there was melody, and the tune was "Tipperary."</p>

<p>From that convolvulus-shaped trumpet there came two bars of
it.</p>

<p>"And what do you hear now?" cried Horton with a crack of
exultation in his voice. "Singing, singing! That's the tune they all
sang. Fine music that from a dead man. Encore! you say? Yes, wait a
second, and he'll sing it again for you. Confound it, I can't get on
to the place. Ah! I've got it: listen again."</p>

<p>Surely that was the strangest manner of song ever yet heard on the
earth, this melody from the brain of the dead. Horror and fascination
strove within me, and I suppose the first for the moment prevailed,
for with a shudder I jumped up.</p>

<p>"Stop it!" I said. "It's terrible."</p>

<p>His face, thin and eager, gleamed in the strong ray of the lamp
which he had placed close to him. His hand was on the metal rod from
which depended the spiral spring and the needle, which just rested on
that fragment of grey stuff which I had seen in the glass vessel.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm going to stop it now," he said, "or the germs will be
getting at my gramophone record, or the record will get cold. See, I
spray it with carbolic vapour, I put it back into its nice warm bed.
It will sing to us again. But terrible? What do you mean by
terrible?"</p>

<p>Indeed, when he asked that I scarcely knew myself what I meant. I
had been witness to a new marvel of science as wonderful perhaps as
any that had ever astounded the beholder, and my nerves--these
childish whimperers--had cried out at the darkness and the
profundity.</p>

<p>But the horror diminished, the fascination increased as he quite
shortly told me the history of this phenomenon. He had attended that
day and operated upon a young soldier in whose brain was embedded a
piece of shrapnel. The boy was in extremis, but Horton had hoped for
the possibility of saving him. To extract the shrapnel was the only
chance, and this involved the cutting away of a piece of brain known
as the speech-centre, and taking from it what was embedded there. But
the hope was not realised, and two hours later the boy died. It was
to this fragment of brain that, when Horton returned home, he had
applied the needle of his gramophone, and had obtained the faint
whisperings which had caused him to ring me up, so that he might have
a witness of this wonder. Witness I had been, not to these
whisperings alone, but to the fragment of singing.</p>

<p>"And this is but the first step on the new road," said he. "Who
knows where it may lead, or to what new temple of knowledge it may
not be the avenue? Well, it is late: I shall do no more
to-night."</p>

<p>"What about the raid, by the way?"</p>

<p>To my amazement I saw that the time was verging on midnight. Two
hours had elapsed since he let me in at his door; they had passed
like a couple of minutes. Next morning some neighbours spoke of the
prolonged firing that had gone on, of which I had been wholly
unconscious.</p>

<p>Week after week Horton worked on this new road of research,
perfecting the sensitiveness and subtlety of the needle, and, by
vastly increasing the power of his batteries, enlarging the
magnifying power of his trumpet. Many and many an evening during the
next year did I listen to voices that were dumb in death, and the
sounds which had been blurred and unintelligible mutterings in the
earlier experiments, developed, as the delicacy of his mechanical
devices increased, into coherence and clear articulation. It was no
longer necessary to Impose silence on Mrs. Gabriel when the
gramophone was at work, or now the voice we listened to had risen to
the pitch of ordinary human utterance, while as for the faithfulness
and individuality of these records, striking testimony was given more
than once by some living friend of the dead, who, without knowing
what he was about to hear, recognised the tones of the speaker. More
than once also, Mrs. Gabriel, bringing in syphons and whisky,
provided us with three glasses, for she had heard, so she told us,
three different voices in talk. But for the present no fresh
phenomenon occurred; Horton was but perfecting the mechanism of his
previous discovery and, rather grudging the time, was scribbling at a
monograph, which presently he would toss to his colleagues,
concerning the results he had already obtained. And then, even while
Horton was on he threshold of new wonders, which he had already
foreseen and spoken of as theoretically possible, there came an
evening of marvel and of swift catastrophe.</p>

<p>I had dined with him that day, Mrs. Gabriel deftly serving the
meal that she had so daintily prepared, and towards the end, as she
was clearing the table for our dessert, she stumbled, I supposed, on
a loose edge of carpet, quickly recovering herself. But instantly
Horton checked some half-finished sentence, and turned to her.</p>

<p>"You're all right, Mrs. Gabriel?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, thank you," said she, and went on with her serving.</p>

<p>"As I was saying," began Horton again, but his attention clearly
wandered, and without concluding his narrative, he relapsed into
silence, till Mrs. Gabriel had given us our coffee and left the
room.</p>

<p>"I'm sadly afraid my domestic felicity may be disturbed," he said.
"Mrs. Gabriel had an epileptic fit yesterday, and she confessed when
she recovered that she had been subject to them when a child, and
since then had occasionally experienced them."</p>

<p>"Dangerous, then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In themselves not in the least," said he. "If she was sitting in
her chair or lying in bed when one occurred, there would be nothing
to trouble about. But if one occurred while she was cooking my dinner
or beginning to come downstairs, she might fall into the fire or
tumble down the whole flight. We'll hope no such deplorable calamity
will happen. Now, if you've finished your coffee, let us go into the
laboratory. Not that I've got anything very interesting in the way of
new records. But I've introduced a second battery with a very strong
induction coil into my apparatus. I find that if I link it up with my
record, given that the record is a--a fresh one, it stimulates
certain nerve centres. It's odd, isn't it, that the same forces which
so encourage the dead to live would certainly encourage the living to
die, if a man received the full current. One has to be careful in
handling it. Yes, and what then? you ask."</p>

<p>The night was very hot, and he threw the windows wide before he
settled himself cross-legged on the floor.</p>

<p>"I'll answer your question for you," he said, "though I believe
we've talked of it before.</p>

<p>"Supposing I had not a fragment of brain-tissue only, but a whole
head, let us say, or best of all, a complete corpse, I think I could
expect to produce more than mere speech through the gramophone. The
dead lips themselves perhaps might utter--God! what's that?"</p>

<p>From close outside, at the bottom of the stairs leading from the
dining room which we had just quitted to the laboratory where we now
sat, there came a crash of glass followed by the fall as of something
heavy which bumped from step to step, and was finally flung on the
threshold against the door with the sound as of knuckles rapping at
it, and demanding admittance. Horton sprang up and threw the door
open, and there lay, half inside the room and half on the landing
outside, the body of Mrs. Gabriel. Round her were splinters of broken
bottles and glasses, and from a cut in her forehead, as she lay
ghastly with face upturned, the blood trickled into her thick grey
hair.</p>

<p>Horton was on his knees beside her, dabbing his handkerchief on
her forehead.</p>

<p>"Ah! that's not serious," he said; "there's neither vein nor
artery cut. I'll just bind that up first."</p>

<p>He tore his handkerchief into strips which he tied together, and
made a dexterous bandage covering the lower part of her forehead, but
leaving her eyes unobscured. They stared with a fixed meaningless
steadiness, and he scrutinised them closely.</p>

<p>"But there's worse yet," he said. "There's been some severe blow
on the head. Help me to carry her into the laboratory. Get round to
her feet and lift underneath the knees when I am ready. There! Now
put your arm right under her and carry her."</p>

<p>Her head swung limply back as he lifted her shoulders, and he
propped it up against his knee, where it mutely nodded and bowed, as
his leg moved, as if in silent assent to what we were doing, and the
mouth, at the extremity of which there had gathered a little lather,
lolled open. He still supported her shoulders as I fetched a cushion
on which to place her head, and presently she was lying close to the
low table on which stood the gramophone of the dead. Then with light
deft fingers he passed his hands over her skull, pausing as he came
to the spot just above and behind her right ear. Twice and again his
fingers groped and lightly pressed, while with shut eyes and
concentrated attention he interpreted what his trained touch
revealed.</p>

<p>"Her skull is broken to fragments just here," he said. "In the
middle there is a piece completely severed from the rest, and the
edges of the cracked pieces must be pressing on her brain."</p>

<p>Her right arm was lying palm upwards on the floor, and with one
hand he felt her wrist with fingertips.</p>

<p>"Not a sign of ...," he said. "She's dead in the ordinary sense
of the word. But life persists in an extraordinary manner, you may
remember. She can't be wholly dead: no one is wholly dead in a
moment, unless every organ is blown to bits. But she soon will be
dead, if we don't relieve the pressure on the brain. That's the first
thing to be done. While I'm busy at that, shut the window, will you,
and make up the fire. In this sort of case the vital heat, whatever
that is, leaves the body very quickly. Make the room as hot as you
can--fetch an oil-stove, and turn on the electric radiator, and
stoke up a roaring fire. The hotter the room is the more slowly will
the heat of life leave her."</p>

<p>Already he had opened his cabinet of surgical instruments, and
taken out of it two drawers full of bright steel which he laid on the
floor beside her. I heard the grating chink of scissors severing her
long grey hair, and as I busied myself with laying and lighting the
fire in the hearth, and kindling the oil-stove, which I found, by
Horton's directions, in the pantry, I saw that his lancet was busy on
the exposed skin. He had placed some vaporising spray, heated by a
spirit lamp close to her head, and as he worked its fizzing nozzle
filled the air with some clean and aromatic odour. Now and then he
threw out an order.</p>

<p>"Bring me that electric lamp on the long cord," he said. "I
haven't got enough light. Don't look at what I'm doing if you're
squeamish, for if it makes you feel faint, I shan't be able to attend
to you."</p>

<p>I suppose that violent interest in what he was doing overcame any
qualm that I might have had, for I looked quite unflinching over his
shoulder as I moved the lamp about till it was in such a place that
it threw its beam directly into a dark hole at the edge of which
depended a flap of skin. Into this he put his forceps, and as he
withdrew them they grasped a piece of blood-stained bone.</p>

<p>"That's better," he said, "and the room's warming up well. But
there's no sign of pulse yet.</p>

<p>"Go on stoking, will you, till the thermometer on the wall there
registers a hundred degrees."</p>

<p>When next, on my journey from the coal-cellar, I looked, two more
pieces of bone lay beside the one I had seen extracted, and presently
referring to the thermometer, I saw, that between the oil-stove and
the roaring fire and the electric radiator, I had raised the room to
the temperature he wanted. Soon, peering fixedly at the seat of his
operation, he felt for her pulse again.</p>

<p>"Not a sign of returning vitality," he said, "and I've done all I
can. There's nothing more possible that can be devised to restore
her."</p>

<p>As he spoke the zeal of the unrivalled surgeon relaxed, and with a
sigh and a shrug he rose to his feet and mopped his face. Then
suddenly the fire and eagerness blazed there again. "The gramophone!"
he said. "The speech centre is close to where I've been working, and
it is quite uninjured. Good heavens, what a wonderful opportunity.
She served me well living, and she shall serve me dead. And I can
stimulate the motor nerve-centre, too, with the second battery. We
may see a new wonder tonight."</p>

<p>Some qualm of horror shook me.</p>

<p>"No, don't!" I said. "It's terrible: she's just dead. I shall go
if you do."</p>

<p>"But I've got exactly all the conditions I have long been
wanting," said he. "And I simply can't spare you. You must be
witness: I must have a witness. Why, man, there's not a surgeon or a
physiologist in the kingdom who would not give an eye or an ear to be
in your place now.</p>

<p>"She's dead. I pledge you my honour on that, and it's grand to be
dead if you can help the living."</p>

<p>Once again, in a far fiercer struggle, horror and the intensest
curiosity strove together in me.</p>

<p>"Be quick, then," said I.</p>

<p>"Ha! That's right," exclaimed Horton. "Help me to lift her on to
the table by the gramophone. The cushion too; I can get at the place
more easily with her head a little raised."</p>

<p>He turned on the battery and with the movable light close beside
him, brilliantly illuminating what he sought, he inserted the needle
of the gramophone into the jagged aperture in her skull.</p>

<p>For a few minutes, as he groped and explored there, there was
silence, and then quite suddenly Mrs. Gabriel's voice, clear and
unmistakable and of the normal loudness of human speech, issued from
the trumpet. "Yes, I always said that I'd be even with him," came the
articulated syllables. "He used to knock me about, he did, when he
came home drunk, and often I was black and blue with bruises.</p>

<p>"But I'll give him a redness for the black and blue."</p>

<p>The record grew blurred; instead of articulate words there came
from it a gobbling noise. By degrees that cleared, and we were
listening to some dreadful suppressed sort of laughter, hideous to
hear. On and on it went.</p>

<p>"I've got into some sort of rut," said Horton. "She must have
laughed a lot to herself."</p>

<p>For a long time we got nothing more except the repetition of the
words we had already heard and the sound of that suppressed laughter.
Then Horton drew towards him the second battery.</p>

<p>"I'll try a stimulation of the motor nerve-centres," he said.
"Watch her face."</p>

<p>He propped the gramophone needle in position, and inserted into
the fractured skull the two poles of the second battery, moving them
about there very carefully. And as I watched her face, I saw with a
freezing horror that her lips were beginning to move.</p>

<p>"Her mouth's moving," I cried. "She can't be dead."</p>

<p>He peered into her face.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said. "That's only the stimulus from the current.
She's been dead half an hour. Ah! what's coming now?"</p>

<p>The lips lengthened into a smile, the lower jaw dropped, and from
her mouth came the laughter we had heard just now through the
gramophone. And then the dead mouth spoke, with a mumble of
unintelligible words, a bubbling torrent of incoherent syllables.</p>

<p>"I'll turn the full current on," he said.</p>

<p>The head jerked and raised itself, the lips struggled for
utterance, and suddenly she spoke swiftly and distinctly.</p>

<p>"Just when he'd got his razor out," she said, "I came up behind
him, and put my hand over his face, and bent his neck back over his
chair with all my strength. And I picked up his razor and with one
slit--ha, ha, that was the way to pay him out. And I didn't lose my
head, but I lathered his chin well, and put the razor in his hand,
and left him there, and went downstairs and cooked his dinner for
him, and then an hour afterwards, as he didn't come down, up I went
to see what kept him. It was a nasty cut in his neck that had kept
him--"</p>

<p>Horton suddenly withdrew the two poles of the battery from her
head, and even in the middle of her word the mouth ceased working,
and lay rigid and open.</p>

<p>"By God!" he said. "There's a tale for dead lips to tell. But
we'll get more yet."</p>

<p>Exactly what happened then I never knew. It appeared to me that as
he still leaned over the table with the two poles of the battery in
his hand, his foot slipped, and he fell forward across it.</p>

<p>There came a sharp crack, and a flash of blue dazzling light, and
there he lay face downwards, with arms that just stirred and
quivered. With his fall the two poles that must momentarily have come
into contact with his hand were jerked away again, and I lifted him
and laid him on the floor. But his lips as well as those of the dead
woman had spoken for the last time.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10"></a>The Dust-Cloud</h2>

<p>The big French windows were open on to the lawn, and, dinner being
over, two or three of the party who were staying for the week at the
end of August with the Combe-Martins had strolled out on to the
terrace to look at the sea, over which the moon, large and low, was
just rising and tracing a path of pale gold from horizon to shore,
while others, less lunar of inclination, had gone in search of bridge
or billiards. Coffee had come round immediately after dessert, and
the end of dinner, according to the delectable custom of the house,
was as informal as the end of breakfast.</p>

<p>Every one, that is to say, remained or went away, smoked, drank
port or abstained, according to his personal tastes. Thus, on this
particular evening it so happened that Harry Combe-Martin and I were
very soon left alone in the dining-room, because we were talking
unmitigated motor "shop," and the rest of the party (small wonder)
were bored with it, and had left us. The shop was home-shop, so to
speak, for it was almost entirely concerned with the manifold
perfections of the new six-cylinder Napier which my host in a moment
of extravagance, which he did not in the least regret, had just
purchased; in which, too, he proposed to take me over to lunch at a
friend's house near Hunstanton on the following day. He observed with
legitimate pride that an early start would not be necessary, as the
distance was only eighty miles and there were no police traps.</p>

<p>"Queer things these big motors are," he said, relapsing into
generalities as we rose to go.</p>

<p>"Often I can scarcely believe that my new car is merely a machine.
It seems to me to possess an independent life of its own. It is
really much more like a thoroughbred with a wonderfully fine
mouth."</p>

<p>"And the moods of a thoroughbred?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No; it's got an excellent temper, I'm glad to say. It doesn't
mind being checked, or even stopped, when it's going its best. Some
of these big cars can't stand that. They get sulky--I assure you it
is literally true--if they are checked too often."</p>

<p>He paused on his way to ring the bell. "Guy Elphinstone's car, for
instance," he said: "it was a bad-tempered brute, a violent, vicious
beast of a car."</p>

<p>"What make?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five horse-power Am&eacute;d&eacute;e. They are a fretful
strain of car; too thin, not enough bone--and bone is very good for
the nerves. The brute liked running over a chicken or a rabbit,
though perhaps it was less the car's ill-temper than Guy's, poor
chap. Well, he paid for it--he paid to the uttermost farthing. Did
you know him?"</p>

<p>"No; but surely I have heard the name. Ah, yes, he ran over a
child, did he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Harry, "and then smashed up against his own park
gates."</p>

<p>"Killed, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, killed instantly, and the car just a heap of splinters.
There's an old story about it, I'm told, in the village: rather in
your line."</p>

<p>"Ghosts?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, the ghost of his motor-car. Seems almost too up-to-date,
doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"And what's the story?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Why, just this. His place was outside the village of Bircham, ten
miles out from Norwich; and there's a long straight bit of road
there--that's where he ran over the child--and a couple of hundred
yards further on, a rather awkward turn into the park gates. Well, a
month or two ago, soon after the accident, one old gaffer in the
village swore he had seen a motor there coming full tilt along the
road, but without a sound, and it disappeared at the lodge gates of
the park, which were shut. Soon after another said he had heard a
motor whirl by him at the same place, followed by a hideous scream,
but he saw nothing."</p>

<p>"The scream is rather horrible," said I.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see what you mean! I only thought of his syren. Guy had a
syren on his exhaust, same as I have. His had a dreadful frightened
sort of wail, and always made me feel creepy."</p>

<p>"And is that all the story?" I asked: "that one old man thought he
saw a noiseless motor, and another thought he heard an invisible
one?"</p>

<p>Harry flicked the ash off his cigarette into the grate. "Oh dear
no!" he said. "Half a dozen of them have seen something or heard
something. It is quite a heavily authenticated yarn."</p>

<p>"Yes, and talked over and edited in the public-house," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, not a man of them will go there after dark. Also the
lodge-keeper gave notice a week or two after the accident. He said he
was always hearing a motor stop and hoot outside the lodge, and he
was kept running out at all hours of the night to see what it
was."</p>

<p>"And what was it?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't anything. Simply nothing there. He thought it rather
uncanny, anyhow, and threw up a good post. Besides, his wife was
always hearing a child scream, and while her man toddled out to the
gate she would go and see whether the kids were all right. And the
kids themselves--"</p>

<p>"Ah, what of them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They kept coming to their mother, asking who the little girl was
who walked up and down the road and would not speak to them or play
with them."</p>

<p>"It's a many-sided story," I said. "All the witnesses seem to have
heard and seen different things."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is just what to my mind makes the yarn so good," he
said. "Personally I don't take much stock in spooks at all. But given
that there are such things as spooks, and given that the death of the
child and the death of Guy have caused spooks to play about there, it
seems to me a very good point that different people should be aware
of different phenomena. One hears the car, another sees it, one hears
the child scream, another sees the child. How does that strike
you?"</p>

<p>This, I am bound to say, was a new view to me, and the more I
thought of it the more reasonable it appeared. For the vast majority
of mankind have all those occult senses by which is perceived the
spiritual world (which, I hold, is thick and populous around us),
sealed up, as it were; in other words, the majority of mankind never
hear or see a ghost at all. Is it not, then, very probable that of
the remainder--those, in fact, to whom occult experiences have
happened or can happen--few should have every sense unsealed, but
that some should have the unsealed ear, others the unsealed
eye--that some should be clairaudient, others clairvoyant?</p>

<p>"Yes, it strikes me as reasonable," I said. "Can't you take me
over there?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! If you will stop till Friday I'll take you over on
Thursday. The others all go that day, so that we can get there after
dark."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "I can't stop till Friday, I'm afraid," I said.
"I must leave on Thursday. But how about to-morrow? Can't we take it
on the way to or from Hunstanton?"</p>

<p>"No; it's thirty miles out of our way. Besides, to be at Bircham
after dark means that we shouldn't get back here till midnight. And
as host to my guests--"</p>

<p>"Ah! things are only heard and seen after dark, are they?" I
asked. "That makes it so much less interesting. It is like a
s&eacute;ance where all lights are put out."</p>

<p>"Well, the accident happened at night," he said. "I don't know the
rules, but that may have some bearing on it, I should think."</p>

<p>I had one question more in the back of my mind, but I did not like
to ask it. At least, I wanted information on this subject without
appearing to ask for it.</p>

<p>"Neither do I know the rules of motors," I said; "and I don't
understand you when you say that Guy Elphinstone's machine was an
irritable, cross-grained brute, that liked running over chickens and
rabbits. But I think you subsequently said that the irritability may
have been the irritability of its owner. Did he mind being
checked?"</p>

<p>"It made him blind-mad if it happened often," said Harry. "I shall
never forget a drive I had with him once: there were hay-carts and
perambulators every hundred yards. It was perfectly ghastly; it was
like being with a madman. And when we got inside his gate, his dog
came running out to meet him. He did not go an inch out of his
course: it was worse than that--he went for it, just grinding his
teeth with rage. I never drove with him again."</p>

<p>He stopped a moment, guessing what might be in my mind. "I say,
you mustn't think--you mustn't think--" he began.</p>

<p>"No, of course not," said I.</p>

<p>Harry Combe-Martin's house stood close to the weather-eaten, sandy
cliffs of the Suffolk shore, which are being incessantly gnawed away
by the hunger of the insatiable sea. Fathoms deep below it, and now
any hundred yards out, lies what was once the second port in England;
but now of the ancient town of Dunwich, and of its seven great
churches, nothing remains but one, and that ruinous and already half
destroyed by the falling cliff and the encroachments of the sea. Foot
by foot, it too is disappearing, and of the graveyard which
surrounded it more than half is gone, so that from the face of the
sandy cliff on which it stands there stick out like straws in glass,
as Dante says, the bones of those who were once committed there to
the kindly and stable earth.</p>

<p>Whether it was the remembrance of this rather grim spectacle as I
had seen it that afternoon, or whether Harry's story had caused some
trouble in my brain, or whether it was merely that the keen bracing
air of this place, to one who had just come from the sleepy languor
of the Norfolk Broads, kept me sleepless, I do not know; but, anyhow,
the moment I put out my light that night and got into bed, I felt
that all the footlights and gas-jets in the internal theatre of my
mind sprang into flame, and that I was very vividly and alertly
awake. It was in vain that I counted a hundred forwards and a hundred
backwards, that I pictured to myself a flock of visionary sheep
coming singly through a gap in an imaginary hedge, and tried to
number their monotonous and uniform countenances, that I played
noughts and crosses with myself, that I marked out scores of double
lawn-tennis courts,--for with each repetition of these supposedly
soporific exercises I only became more intensely wakeful. It was not
in remote hope of sleep that I continued to repeat these weary
performances long after their inefficacy was proved to the hilt, but
because I was strangely unwilling in this timeless hour of the night
to think about those protruding relics of humanity; also I quite
distinctly did not desire to think about that subject with regard to
which I had, a few hours ago, promised Harry that I would not make it
the subject of reflection. For these reasons I continued during the
black hours to practise these narcotic exercises of the mind, knowing
well that if I paused on the tedious treadmill my thoughts, like some
released spring, would fly back to rather gruesome subjects. I kept
my mind, in fact, talking loud to itself, so that it should not hear
what other voices were saying.</p>

<p>Then by degrees these absurd mental occupations became impossible;
my mind simply refused to occupy itself with them any longer; and
next moment I was thinking intently and eagerly, not about the bones
protruding from the gnawed section of sandcliff, but about the
subject I had said I would not dwell upon. And like a flash it came
upon me why Harry had bidden me not think about it. Surely in order
that I should not come to the same conclusion as he had come to.</p>

<p>Now the whole question of "haunt"--haunted spots, haunted houses,
and so forth--has always seemed to me to be utterly unsolved, and to
be neither proved nor disproved to a satisfactory degree. From the
earliest times, certainly from the earliest known Egyptian records,
there has been a belief that the scene of a crime is often revisited,
sometimes by the spirit of him who has committed it--seeking rest,
we must suppose, and finding none; sometimes, and more inexplicably,
by the spirit of his victim, crying perhaps, like the blood of Abel,
for vengeance.</p>

<p>And though the stories of these village gossips in the alehouse
about noiseless visions and invisible noises were all as yet unsifted
and unreliable, yet I could not help wondering if they (such as they
were) pointed to something authentic and to be classed under this
head of appearances. But more striking than the yarns of the gaffers
seemed to me the questions of the lodge-keeper's children. How should
children have imagined the figure of a child that would not speak to
them or play with them? Perhaps it was a real child, a sulky child.
Yes--perhaps. But perhaps not. Then after this preliminary skirmish I
found myself settling down to the question that I had said I would
not think about; in other words, the possible origin of these
phenomena interested me more than the phenomena themselves. For what
exactly had Guy Elphinstone, that savage driver, done? Had or had not
the death of the child been entirely an accident, a thing (given he
drove a motor at all) outside his own control? Or had he, irritated
beyond endurance at the checks and delays of the day, not pulled up
when it was just possible he might have, but had run over the child
as he would have run over a rabbit or a hen, or even his own dog? And
what, in any case, poor wretched brute, must have been his thoughts
in that terrible instant that intervened between the child's death
and his own, when a moment later he smashed into the closed gates of
his own lodge? Was remorse his--bitter, despairing contrition? That
could hardly have been so; or else surely, knowing only for certain
that he had knocked a child down, he would have stopped; he would
have done his best, whatever that might be, to repair the irreparable
harm. But he had not stopped: he had gone on, it seemed, at full
speed, for on the collision the car had been smashed into matchwood
and steel shavings. Again, with double force, had this dreadful thing
been a complete accident, he would have stopped. So then--most
terrible question of all--had he, after making murder, rushed on to
what proved to be his own death, filled with some hellish glee at
what he had done? Indeed, as in the church-yard on the cliff, bones
of the buried stuck starkly out into the night.</p>

<p>The pale tired light of earliest morning had turned the
window-blinds into glimmering squares before I slept; and when I
woke, the servant who called me was already rattling them briskly up
on their rollers, and letting the calm serenity of the August day
stream into the room. Through the open windows poured in sunlight and
sea-wind, the scent of flowers and the song of birds; and each and
all were wonderfully reassuring, banishing the hooded forms that had
haunted the night, and I thought of the disquietude of the dark hours
as a traveller may think of the billows and tempests of the ocean
over which he has safely journeyed, unable, now that they belong to
the limbo of the past, to recall his qualms and tossings with any
vivid uneasiness. Not without a feeling of relief, too, did I dwell
on the knowledge that I was definitely not going to visit this
equivocal spot. Our drive to-day, as Harry had said, would not take
us within thirty miles of it, and to-morrow I but went to the station
and away. Though a thorough-paced seeker after truth might, no doubt,
have regretted that the laws of time and space did not permit him to
visit Bircham after the sinister dark had fallen, and test whether
for him there was visible or audible truth in the tales of the
village gossips, I was conscious of no such regret. Bircham and its
fables had given me a very bad night, and I was perfectly aware that
I did not in the least want to go near it, though yesterday I had
quite truthfully said I should like to do so. In this brightness,
too, of sun and sea-wind I felt none of the malaise at my waking
moments which a sleepless night usually gives me; I felt particularly
well, particularly pleased to be alive, and also, as I have said,
particularly content not to be going to Bircham. I was quite
satisfied to leave my curiosity unsatisfied.</p>

<p>The motor came round about eleven, and we started at once, Harry
and Mrs. Morrison, a cousin of his, sitting behind in the big back
seat, large enough to hold a comfortable three, and I on the left of
the driver, in a sort of trance--I am not ashamed to confess it--of
expectancy and delight. For this was in the early days of motors,
when there was still the sense of romance and adventure round them. I
did not want to drive, any more than Harry wanted to; for driving, so
I hold, is too absorbing; it takes the attention in too firm a grip:
the mania of the true motorist is not consciously enjoyed. For the
passion for motors is a taste--I had almost said a gift--as distinct
and as keenly individual as the passion for music or mathematics.
Those who use motors most (merely as a means of getting rapidly from
one place to another) are often entirely without it, while those whom
adverse circumstances (over which they have no control) compel to use
them least may have it to a supreme degree. To those who have it,
analysis of their passion is perhaps superfluous; to those who have
it not, explanation is almost unintelligible. Pace, however, and the
control of pace, and above all the sensuous consciousness of pace, is
at the root of it; and pleasure in pace is common to most people,
whether it be in the form of a galloping horse, or the pace of the
skate hissing over smooth ice, or the pace of a free-wheel bicycle
humming down-hill, or, more impersonally, the pace of the smashed
ball at lawn-tennis, the driven ball at golf, or the low boundary hit
at cricket. But the sensuous consciousness of pace, as I have said,
is needful: one might experience it seated in front of the engine of
an express train, though not in a wadded, shut-windowed carriage,
where the wind of movement is not felt. Then add to this rapture of
the rush through riven air the knowledge that huge relentless force
is controlled by a little lever, and directed by a little wheel on
which the hands of the driver seem to lie so negligently. A great
untamed devil has there his bridle, and he answers to it, as Harry
had said, like a horse with a fine mouth. He has hunger and thirst,
too, unslakeable, and greedily he laps of his soup of petrol which
turns to fire in his mouth; electricity, the force that rends clouds
asunder, and causes towers to totter, is the spoon with which he
feeds himself; and as he eats he races onward, and the road opens
like torn linen in front of him. Yet how obedient, how amenable is
he!--for with a touch on his snaffle his speed is redoubled, or melts
into thin air, so that before you know you have touched the rein he
has exchanged his swallow-flight for a mere saunter through the
lanes. But he ever loves to run; and knowing this, you will bid him
lift up his voice and tell those who are in his path that he is
coming, so that he will not need the touch that checks. Hoarse and
jovial is his voice, hooting to the wayfarer; and if his hooting be
not heard he has a great guttural falsetto scream that leaps from
octave to octave, and echoes from the hedges that are passing in
blurred lines of hanging green. And, as you go, the romantic
isolation of divers in deep seas is yours; masked and hooded
companions may be near you also, in their driving-dress for this
plunge through the swift tides of air; but you, like them, are alone
and isolated, conscious only of the ripped riband of road, the two
great lantern-eyes of the wonderful monster that look through drooped
eyelids by day, but gleam with fire by night, the two ear-laps of
splash-boards, and the long lean bonnet in front which is the skull
and brain-case of that swift untiring energy that feeds on fire, and
whirls its two tons of weight up hill and down dale, as if some new
law as ever-lasting as gravity, and like gravity making it go ever
swifter, was its sole control.</p>

<p>For the first hour the essence of these joys, any description of
which compared to the real thing is but as a stagnant pond compared
to the bright rushing of a mountain stream, was mine. A straight
switchback road lay in front of us, and the monster plunged silently
down hill, and said below his breath, "Ha-ha--ha-ha--ha-ha," as,
without diminution of speed, he breasted the opposing slope. In my
control were his great vocal cords (for in those days hooter and
syren were on the driver's left, and lay convenient to the hand of
him who occupied the box-seat), and it rejoiced me to let him hoot at
a pony-cart, three hundred yards ahead, with a hand on his falsetto
scream if his ordinary tones of conversation were unheard or
disregarded. Then came a road crossing ours at right angles, and the
dear monster seemed to say, "Yes, yes,--see how obedient and careful
I am. I stroll with my hands in my pockets." Then again a puppy from
a farmhouse staggered warlike into the road, and the monster said,
"Poor little chap! get home to your mother, or I'll talk to you in
earnest." The poor little chap did not take the hint, so the monster
slackened speed and just said "Whoof!" Then it chuckled to itself as
the puppy scuttled into the hedge, seriously alarmed; and next moment
our self-made wind screeched and whistled round us again.</p>

<p>Napoleon, I believe, said that the power of an army lay in its
feet: that is true also of the monster. There was a loud bang, and in
thirty seconds we were at a standstill. The monster's off fore-foot
troubled it, and the chauffeur said, "Yes, sir--burst."</p>

<p>So the burst boot was taken off and a new one put on, a boot that
had never been on foot before. The foot in question was held up on a
jack during this operation, and the new boot laced up with a pump.
This took exactly twenty-five minutes. Then the monster got his spoon
going again, and said, "Let me run: oh, let me run!"</p>

<p>And for fifteen miles on a straight and empty road it ran. I timed
the miles, but shall not produce their chronology for the benefit of
a forsworn constabulary.</p>

<p>But there were no more dithyrambics that morning. We should have
reached Hunstanton in time for lunch. Instead, we waited to repair
our fourth puncture at 1.45 p.m., twenty-five miles short of our
destination. This fourth puncture was caused by a spicule of flint
three-quarters of an inch long--sharp, it is true, but weighing
perhaps two pennyweights, while we weighed two tons. It seemed an
impertinence. So we lunched at a wayside inn, and during lunch the
pundits held a consultation, of which the upshot was this:</p>

<p>We had no more boots for our monster, for his off fore-foot had
burst once, and punctured once (thus necessitating two socks and one
boot). Similarly, but more so, his off hind-foot had burst twice
(thus necessitating two boots and two socks). Now, there was no
certain shoemaker's shop at Hunstanton, as far as we knew, but there
was a regular universal store at King's Lynn, which was about
equidistant.</p>

<p>And, so said the chauffeur, there was something wrong with the
monster's spoon (ignition), and he didn't rightly know what, and
therefore it seemed the prudent part not to go to Hunstanton (lunch,
a thing of the preterite, having been the object), but to the
well-supplied King's Lynn.</p>

<p>And we all breathed a pious hope that we might get there.</p>

<p>Whizz: hoot: purr! The last boot held, the spoon went busily to
the monster's mouth, and we just flowed into King's Lynn. The return
journey, so I vaguely gathered, would be made by other roads; but
personally, intoxicated with air and movement, I neither asked nor
desired to know what those roads would be. This one small but rather
salient fact is necessary to record here, that as we waited at King's
Lynn, and as we buzzed homewards afterwards, no thought of Bircham
entered my head at all. The subsequent hallucination, if
hallucination it was, was not, as far as I know, self-suggested. That
we had gone out of our way for the sake of the garage, I knew, and
that was all. Harry also told me that he did not know where our road
would take us.</p>

<p>The rest that follows is the baldest possible narrative of what
actually occurred. But it seems to me, a humble student of the
occult, to be curious.</p>

<p>While we waited we had tea in an hotel looking on to a big empty
square of houses, and after tea we waited a very long time for our
monster to pick us up. Then the telephone from the garage inquired
for "the gentleman on the motor," and since Harry had strolled out to
get a local evening paper with news of the last Test Match, I applied
ear and mouth to that elusive instrument. What I heard was not
encouraging: the ignition had gone very wrong indeed, and "perhaps"
in an hour we should be able to start. It was then about half-past
six, and we were just seventy-eight miles from Dunwich.</p>

<p>Harry came back soon after this, and I told him what the message
from the garage had been.</p>

<p>What he said was this: "Then we shan't get back till long after
dinner. We might just as well have camped out to see your ghost."</p>

<p>As I have already said, no notion of Bircham was in my mind, and I
mention this as evidence that, even if it had been, Harry's remark
would have implied that we were not going through Bircham.</p>

<p>The hour lengthened itself into an hour and a half. Then the
monster, quite well again, came hooting round the corner, and we got
in.</p>

<p>"Whack her up, Jack," said Harry to the chauffeur. "The roads will
be empty. You had better light up at once."</p>

<p>The monster, with its eyes agleam, was whacked up, and never in my
life have I been carried so cautiously and yet so swiftly. Jack never
took a risk or the possibility of a risk, but when the road was clear
and open he let the monster run just as fast as it was able. Its eyes
made day of the road fifty yards ahead, and the romance of night was
fairyland round us. Hares started from the roadside, and raced in
front of us for a hundred yards, then just wheeled in time to avoid
the ear-flaps of the great triumphant brute that carried us. Moths
flitted across, struck sometimes by the lenses of its eyes, and the
miles peeled over our shoulders. When it occurred we were going
top-speed.</p>

<p>And this was It--quite unsensational, but to us quite inexplicable
unless my midnight imaginings happened to be true.</p>

<p>As I have said, I was in command of the hooter and of the syren.
We were flying along on a straight down-grade, as fast as ever we
could go, for the engines were working, though the decline was
considerable. Then quite suddenly I saw in front of us a thick cloud
of dust, and knew instinctively and on the instant, without thought
or reasoning, what that must mean.</p>

<p>Evidently something going very fast (or else so large a cloud
could not have been raised) was in front of us, and going in the same
direction as ourselves. Had it been something on the road coming to
meet us, we should of course have seen the vehicle first and run into
the dust-cloud afterwards. Had it, again, been something of low
speed--a horse and dog-cart, for instance--no such dust could have
been raised. But, as it was, I knew at once that there was a motor
travelling swiftly just ahead of us, also that it was not going as
fast as we were, or we should have run into its dust much more
gradually. But we went into it as into a suddenly lowered
curtain.</p>

<p>Then I shouted to Jack. "Slow down, and put on the brake," I
shrieked. "There's something just ahead of us." As I spoke I wrought
a wild concerto on the hooter, and with my right hand groped for the
syren, but did not find it. Simultaneously I heard a wild, frightened
shriek, just as if I had sounded the syren myself. Jack had felt for
it too, and our hands fingered each other. Then we entered the
dust-cloud.</p>

<p>We slowed down with extraordinary rapidity, and still peering
ahead we went dead-slow through it. I had not put on my goggles after
leaving King's Lynn, and the dust stung and smarted in my eyes. It
was not, therefore, a belt of fog, but real road-dust. And at the
moment we crept through it I felt Harry's hands on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"There's something just ahead," he said. "Look! don't you see the
tail light?"</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I did not; and, still going very slow, we
came out of that dust-cloud. The broad empty road stretched in front
of us; a hedge was on each side, and there was no turning either to
right or left. Only, on the right, was a lodge, and gates which were
closed. The lodge had no lights in any window.</p>

<p>Then we came to a standstill; the air was dead-calm, not a leaf in
the hedgerow trees was moving, not a grain of dust was lifted from
the road. But behind, the dust-cloud still hung in the air, and
stopped dead-short at the closed lodge-gates. We had moved very
slowly for the last hundred yards: it was difficult to suppose that
it was of our making. Then Jack spoke, with a curious crack in his
voice.</p>

<p>"It must have been a motor, sir," he said. "But where is it?"</p>

<p>I had no reply to this, and from behind another voice, Harry's
voice, spoke. For the moment I did not recognise it, for it was
strained and faltering.</p>

<p>"Did you open the syren?" he asked. "It didn't sound like our
syren. It sounded like, like--"</p>

<p>"I didn't open the syren," said I.</p>

<p>Then we went on again. Soon we came to scattered lights in houses
by the wayside.</p>

<p>"What's this place?" I asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Bircham, sir," said he.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11"></a>The Cat</h2>

<p>Many people will doubtless, remember that exhibition at the Royal
Academy, not so many seasons ago which came to be known as Alingham's
year, when Dick Alingham vaulted, with one bound, as it were, out of
the crowd of strugglers and seated himself with admirably certain
poise on the very topmost pinnacle of contemporary fame. He exhibited
three portraits, each a masterpiece, which killed every picture
within range. But since that year nobody cared anything for pictures
whether in or out of range except those three, it did not signify so
greatly. The phenomenon of his appearance was as sudden as that of
the meteor, coming from nowhere and sliding large and luminous across
the remote and star-sown sky, as inexplicable as the bursting of a
spring on some dust-ridden rocky hillside. Some fairy godmother, one
might conjecture, had bethought herself of her forgotten godson, and
with a wave of her wand bestowed on him this transcendent gift. But,
as the Irish say, she held her wand in her left hand, for her gift
had another side to it. Or perhaps, again, Jim Merwick is right, and
the theory he propounds in his monograph, "On certain obscure lesions
of the nerve centres," says the final word on the subject.</p>

<p>Dick Alingham himself, as was indeed natural, was delighted with
his fairy godmother or his obscure lesion (whichever was
responsible), and (the monograph spoken of above was written after
Dick's death) confessed frankly to his friend Merwick, who was still
struggling through the crowd of rising young medical practitioners,
that it was all quite as inexplicable to himself as it was to anyone
else.</p>

<p>"All I know about it," he said, "is that last autumn I went
through two months of mental depression so hideous that I thought
again and again that I must go off my head. For hours daily, I sat
here, waiting for something to crack, which as far as I am concerned
would end everything.</p>

<p>"Yes, there was a cause; you know it."</p>

<p>He paused a moment and poured into his glass a fairly liberal
allowance of whisky, filled it half up from a syphon, and lit a
cigarette. The cause, indeed, had no need to be enlarged on, for
Merwick quite well remembered how the girl Dick had been engaged to
threw him over with an abruptness that was almost superb, when a more
eligible suitor made his appearance. The latter was certainly very
eligible indeed with his good looks, his title, and his million of
money, and Lady Madingley--ex-future Mrs. Alingham--was perfectly
content with what she had done.</p>

<p>She was one of those blonde, lithe, silken girls, who, happily for
the peace of men's minds, are rather rare, and who remind one of some
humanised yet celestial and bestial cat.</p>

<p>"I needn't speak of the cause," Dick continued, "but, as I say,
for those two months I soberly thought that the only end to it would
be madness. Then one evening when I was sitting here alone--I was
always sitting alone--something did snap in my head. I know I
wondered, without caring at all, whether this was the madness which I
had been expecting, or whether (which would be preferable) some more
fatal breakage had happened. And even while I wondered, I was aware
that I was not depressed or unhappy any longer."</p>

<p>He paused for so long in a smiling retrospect that Merwick
indicated to him that he had a listener.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>"It was well indeed. I haven't been unhappy since. I have been
riotously happy instead. Some divine doctor, I suppose, just wiped
off that stain on my brain that hurt so. Heavens, how it hurt! Have a
drink, by the way?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said Merwick. "But what has all this got to do with
your painting?"</p>

<p>"Why, everything. For I had hardly realised the fact that I was
happy again, when I was aware that everything looked different. The
colours of all I saw were twice as vivid as they had been, shape and
outline were intensified too. The whole visible world had been dusty
and blurred before, and seen in a half-light. But now the lights were
turned up, and there was a new heaven and a new earth. And in the
same flash, I knew that I could paint things as I saw them. Which," he
concluded, "I have done."</p>

<p>There was something rather sublime about this, and Merwick
laughed.</p>

<p>"I wish something would snap in my brain, if it kindles the
perceptions in that way," said he, "but it is just possible that the
snapping of things in one's brain does not always produce just that
effect."</p>

<p>"That is possible. Also, as I gather, things don't snap unless you
have gone through some such hideous period as I have been through.
And I tell you frankly that I wouldn't go through that again even to
ensure a snap that would make me see things like Titian."</p>

<p>"What did the snapping feel like?" asked Merwick.</p>

<p>Dick considered a moment.</p>

<p>"Do you know when a parcel comes, tied up with string, and you
can't find a knife," he said, "and therefore you burn the string
through, holding it taut? Well, it was like that: quite painless,
only something got weaker and weaker, and then parted, softly without
effort. Not very lucid, I'm afraid, but it was just like that. It had
been burning a couple of months, you see."</p>

<p>He turned away and hunted among the letters and papers which
littered his writing-table till he found an envelope with a coronet
on it. He chuckled to himself as he took it up.</p>

<p>"Commend me to Lady Madingley," he said, "for a brazen impudence
in comparison with which brass is softer than putty. She wrote to me
yesterday, asking me if I would finish the portrait I had begun of
her last year, and let her have it at my own price.</p>

<p>"Then I think you have had a lucky escape," remarked Merwick. "I
suppose you didn't even answer her."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I did: why not? I said the price would be two thousand
pounds, and I was ready to go on at once. She has agreed, and sent me
a cheque for a thousand this evening."</p>

<p>Merwick stared at him in blank astonishment. "Are you mad?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I hope not, though one can never be sure about little points like
that. Even doctors like you don't know exactly what constitutes
madness."</p>

<p>Merwick got up.</p>

<p>"But is it possible that you don't see what a terrible risk you
run?" he asked. "To see her again, to be with her like that, having
to look at her--I saw her this afternoon, by the way, hardly
human--may not that so easily revive again all that you felt before?
It is too dangerous: much too dangerous."</p>

<p>Dick shook his head.</p>

<p>"There is not the slightest risk," he said; "everything within me
is utterly and absolutely indifferent to her. I don't even hate her:
if I hated her there might be a possibility of my again loving her.
As it is, the thought of her does not arouse in me any emotion of any
kind. And really such stupendous calmness deserves to be rewarded. I
respect colossal things like that."</p>

<p>He finished his whisky as he spoke, and instantly poured himself
out another glass.</p>

<p>"That's the fourth," said his friend.</p>

<p>"Is it? I never count. It shows a sordid attention to
uninteresting detail. Funnily enough, too, alcohol does not have the
smallest effect on me now."</p>

<p>"Why drink then?"</p>

<p>"Because if I give it up this entrancing vividness of colour and
clarity of outline is a little diminished.</p>

<p>"Can't be good for you," said the doctor.</p>

<p>Dick laughed.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, look at me carefully," he said, "and then if you
can conscientiously declare that I show any signs of indulging in
stimulants, I'll give them up altogether."</p>

<p>Certainly it would have been hard to find a point in which Dick
did not present the appearance of perfect health. He had paused, and
stood still a moment, his glass in one hand, the whisky-bottle in the
other, black against the front of his shirt, and not a tremor of
unsteadiness was there. His face of wholesome sun-burnt hue was
neither puffy nor emaciated, but firm of flesh and of a wonderful
clearness of skin. Clear too was his eye, with eyelids neither baggy
nor puckered; he looked indeed a model of condition, hard and fit, as
if he was in training for some athletic event. Lithe and active too
was his figure, his movements were quick and precise, and even
Merwick, with his doctor's eye trained to detect any symptom, however
slight, in which the drinker must betray himself, was bound to
confess that no such was here present. His appearance contradicted it
authoritatively, so also did his manner; he met the eye of the man he
was talking to without sideway glances; he showed no signs, however
small, of any disorder of the nerves. Yet Dick was altogether an
abnormal fellow; the history he had just been recounting was
abnormal, those weeks of depression, followed by the sudden snap in
his brain which had apparently removed, as a wet cloth removes a
stain, all the memory of his love and of the cruel bitterness that
resulted from it. Abnormal too was his sudden leap into high artistic
achievement from a past of very mediocre performance. Why should
there then not be a similar abnormality here?</p>

<p>"Yes, I confess you show no sign of taking excessive stimulant,"
said Merwick, "but if I attended you professionally--ah, I'm not
touting--I should make you give up all stimulant, and go to bed for a
month."</p>

<p>"Why in the name of goodness?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Because, theoretically, it must be the best thing you could do.
You had a shock, how severe, the misery of those weeks of depression
tells you. Well, common sense says, 'Go slow after a shock; recoup.'
Instead of which you go very fast indeed and produce. I grant it
seems to suit you; you also became suddenly capable of feats
which--oh, it's sheer nonsense, man."</p>

<p>"What's sheer nonsense?"</p>

<p>"You are. Professionally, I detest you, because you appear to be
an exception to a theory that I am sure must be right. Therefore I
have got to explain you away, and at present I can't."</p>

<p>"What's the theory?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Well, the treatment of shock first of all. And secondly, that in
order to do good work, one ought to eat and drink very little and
sleep a lot. How long do you sleep, by the way?"</p>

<p>Dick considered.</p>

<p>"Oh, I go to bed about three usually," he said; "I suppose I sleep
for about four hours."</p>

<p>"And live on whisky, and eat like a Strasburg goose, and are
prepared to run a race to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Go away, or at least I will. Perhaps you'll break down, though.
That would satisfy me.</p>

<p>"But even if you don't, it still remains quite interesting."</p>

<p>Merwick found it more than quite interesting in fact, and when he
got home that night he searched in his shelves for a certain dusky
volume in which he turned up a chapter called "Shock." The book was a
treatise on obscure diseases and abnormal conditions of the nervous
system. He had often read it before, for in his profession he was a
special student of the rare and curious. And the following paragraph
which had interested him much before, interested him more than ever
this evening.</p>

<p>"The nervous system also can act in a way that must always even to
the most advanced student be totally unexpected. Cases are known, and
well-authenticated ones, when a paralytic person has jumped out of
bed on the cry of 'Fire.' Cases too are known when a great shock,
which produces depression so profound as to amount to lethargy, is
followed by abnormal activity, and the calling into use of powers
which were previously unknown to exist, or at any rate existed in a
quite ordinary degree. Such a hyper-sensitised state, especially
since the desire for sleep or rest is very often much diminished,
demands much stimulant in the way of food and alcohol. It would
appear also that the patient suffering from this rare form of the
after-consequences of shock has sooner or later some sudden and
complete break-down. It is impossible, however, to conjecture what
form this will take. The digestion, however, may become suddenly
atrophied, delirium tremens may, without warning, supervene, or he
may go completely off his head..."</p>

<p>But the weeks passed on, the July suns made London reel in a haze
of heat, and yet Alingham remained busy, brilliant, and altogether
exceptional. Merwick, unknown to him, was watching him closely, and
at present was completely puzzled. He held Dick to his word that if
he could detect the slightest sign of over-indulgence in stimulant,
he would cut it off altogether, but he could see absolutely none.
Lady Madingley meantime had given him several sittings, and in this
connection again Merwick was utterly mistaken in the view he had
expressed to Dick as to the risks he ran. For, strangely enough, the
two had become great friends. Yet Dick was quite right, all emotion
with regard to her on his part was dead, it might have been a piece
of still-life that he was painting, instead of a woman he had wildly
worshipped.</p>

<p>One morning in mid-July she had been sitting to him in his studio,
and contrary to custom he had been rather silent, biting the ends of
his brushes, frowning at his canvas, frowning too at her.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a little impatient exclamation.</p>

<p>"It's so like you," he said, "but it just isn't you. There's a lot
of difference! I can't help making you look as if you were listening
to a hymn, one of those in four sharps, don't you know, written by an
organist, probably after eating muffins. And that's not
characteristic of you!"</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"You must be rather ingenious to put all that in," she said.</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Where do I show it all?"</p>

<p>Dick sighed.</p>

<p>"Oh, in your eyes of course," he said. "You show everything by
your eyes, you know. It is entirely characteristic of you. You are a
throw-back; don't you remember we settled that ever so long ago, to
the brute creation, who likewise show everything by their eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh-h. I should have thought that dogs growled at you, and cats
scratched."</p>

<p>"Those are practical measures, but short of that you and animals
use their eyes only, whereas people use their mouths and foreheads
and other things. A pleased dog, an expectant dog, a hungry dog, a
jealous dog, a disappointed dog--one gathers all that from a dog's
eyes. Their mouths are comparatively immobile, and a cat's is even
more so.</p>

<p>"You have often told me that I belong to the genus cat," said Lady
Madingley, with complete composure.</p>

<p>"By Jove, yes," said he. "Perhaps looking at the eyes of a cat
would help me to see what I miss. Many thanks for the hint."</p>

<p>He put down his palette and went to a side table on which stood
bottles and ice and syphons.</p>

<p>"No drink of any kind on this Sahara of a morning?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, thanks. Now when will you give me the final sitting? You said
you only wanted one more."</p>

<p>Dick helped himself.</p>

<p>"Well, I go down to the country with this," he said, "to put in
the background I told you of.</p>

<p>"With luck it will take me three days' hard painting, without luck
a week or more. Oh, my mouth waters at the thought of the background.
So shall we say to-morrow week?"</p>

<p>Lady Madingley made a note of this in a minute gold and jewelled
memorandum book.</p>

<p>"And I am to be prepared to see cat's eyes painted there instead
of my own when I see it next?" she asked, passing by the canvas.</p>

<p>Dick laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, you will hardly notice the difference," he said. "How odd it
is that I always have detested cats so--they make me feel actually
faint, although you always reminded me of a cat."</p>

<p>"You must ask your friend Mr. Merwick about these metaphysical
mysteries," said she.</p>

<p>The background to the picture was at present only indicated by a
few vague splashes close to the side of the head of brilliant purple
and brilliant green, and the artist's mouth might well water at the
thought of the few days painting that lay before him. For behind the
figure in the long panel-shaped canvas was to be painted a green
trellis, over which, almost hiding the woodwork, there was to sprawl
a great purple clematis in full flaunting glory of varnished leaf and
starry flower.</p>

<p>At the top would be just a strip of pale summer sky, at her feet
just a strip of grey-green grass, but all the rest of the background,
greatly daring, would be this diaper of green and purple. For the
purpose of putting this in, he was going down to a small cottage of
his near Godalming, where he had built in the garden a sort of
outdoor studio, an erection betwixt a room and a mere shelter, with
the side to the north entirely open, and flanked by this green
trellis which was now one immense constellation of purple stars.
Framed in this, he well knew how the strange pale beauty of his
sitter would glow on the canvas, how she would start out of the
background, she and her huge grey hat, and shining grey dress, and
yellow hair and ivory white skin and pale eyes, now blue, now grey,
now green. This was indeed a thing to look forward to, for there is
probably no such unadulterated rapture known to men as creation, and
it was small wonder that Dick's mood, as he travelled down to
Godalming, was buoyant and effervescent. For he was going, so to
speak, to realise his creation: every purple star of clematis, every
green leaf and piece of trellis-work that he put in, would cause what
he had painted to live and shine, just as it is the layers of dusk
that fall over the sky at evening which make the stars to sparkle
there, jewel-like.</p>

<p>His scheme was assured, he had hung his constellation--the figure
of Lady Madingley--in the sky: and now he had to surround it with the
green and purple night, so that it might shine.</p>

<p>His garden was but a circumscribed plot, but walls of old brick
circumscribed it, and he had dealt with the space at his command with
a certain originality. At no time had his grass plot (you could
scarcely call it "lawn") been spacious; now the outdoor studio,
twenty-five feet by thirty, took up the greater part of it. He had a
solid wooden wall on one side and two trellis walls to the south and
east, which creepers were beginning to clothe and which were faced
internally by hangings of Syrian and Oriental work. Here in the
summer he passed the greater part of the day, painting or idling, and
living an outdoor existence. The floor, which had once been grass,
which had withered completely under the roof, was covered with
Persian rugs; a writing-table and a dining-table were there, a
bookcase full of familiar friends and a half-dozen of basket chairs.
One corner, too, was frankly given up to the affairs of the garden,
and a mowing machine, a hose for watering, shears, and spade stood
there. For like many excitable persons, Dick found that in gardening,
that incessant process of plannings and designings to suit the
likings of plants, and make them gorgeous in colour and high of
growth, there was a wonderful calm haven of refuge for the brain that
had been tossing on emotional seas. Plants, too, were receptive, so
responsive to kindness; thought given to them was never thought
wasted, and to come back now after a month's absence in London was to
be assured of fresh surprise and pleasure in each foot of garden-bed.
And here, with how regal a generosity was the purple clematis to
repay him for the care lavished on it. Every flower would show its
practical gratitude by standing model for the background of his
picture.</p>

<p>The evening was very warm, warm not with any sultry premonition of
thunder, but with the clear, clean heat of summer, and he dined alone
in his shelter, with the after-flames of the sunset for his lamp.
These slowly faded into a sky of velvet blue, but he lingered long
over his coffee, looking northwards across the garden towards the row
of trees that screened him from the house beyond. These were acacias,
most graceful and feminine of all green things that grow,
summer-plumaged now, yet still fresh of leaf. Below them ran a little
raised terrace of turf and nearer the beds of the beloved garden;
clumps of sweet-peas made an inimitable fragrance, and the rose-beds
were pink with Baroness Rothschild and La France, and copper-coloured
with Beaut&eacute; inconstante, and the Richardson rose. Then, nearer
at hand, was the green trellis foaming with purple.</p>

<p>He was sitting there, hardly looking, but unconsciously drinking
in this great festival of colour, when his eye was arrested by a dark
slinking form that appeared among the roses, and suddenly turned two
shining luminous orbs on him. At this he started up, but his movement
caused no perturbation in the animal, which continued with back
arched for stroking, and poker-like tail, to advance towards him,
purring. As it came closer Dick felt that shuddering faintness, which
often affected him in the presence of cats, come over him, and he
stamped and clapped his hands. At this it turned tail quickly: a sort
of dark shadow streaked the garden-wall for a moment, and it
vanished. But its appearance had spoiled for him the sweet spell of
the evening, and he went indoors.</p>

<p>The next morning was pellucid summer: a faint north wind blew, and
a sun worthy to illumine the isles of Greece flooded the sky. Dick's
dreamless and (for him) long sleep had banished from his mind that
rather disquieting incident of the cat, and he set up his canvas
facing the trellis-work and purple clematis with a huge sense of
imminent ecstasy. Also the garden, which at present he had only seen
in the magic of sunset, was gloriously rewarding, and glowed with
colour, and though life--this was present to his mind for the first
time for months--in the shape of Lady Madingley had not been very
propitious, yet a man, he argued to himself, must be a very poor hand
at living if, with a passion for plants and a passion for art, he
cannot fashion a life that shall be full of content. So breakfast
being finished, and his model ready and glowing with beauty, he
quickly sketched in the broad lines of flowers and foliage and began
to paint.</p>

<p>Purple and green, green and purple: was there ever such a feast
for the eye? Gourmet-like and greedy as well, he was utterly absorbed
in it. He was right too: as soon as he put on the first brush of
colour he knew he was right. It was just those divine and violent
colours which would cause his figure to step out from the picture, it
was just that pale strip of sky above which would focus her again, it
was just that strip of grey-green grass below her feet that would
prevent her, so it seemed, from actually leaving the canvas. And with
swift eager sweeps of the brush which never paused and never hurried,
he lost himself in his work.</p>

<p>He stopped at length with a sense of breathlessness, feeling too
as if he had been suddenly called back from some immense distance
off. He must have been working some three hours, for his man was
already laying the table for lunch, yet it seemed to him that the
morning had gone by in one flash. The progress he had made was
extraordinary, and he looked long at his picture.</p>

<p>Then his eye wandered from the brightness of the canvas to the
brightness of the garden-beds.</p>

<p>There, just in front of the bed of sweet-peas, not two yards from
him, stood a very large grey cat, watching him.</p>

<p>Now the presence of a cat was a thing that usually produced in
Dick a feeling of deadly faintness, yet, at this moment, as he looked
at the cat and the cat at him, he was conscious of no such feeling,
and put down the absence of it, in so far as he consciously thought
about it, to the fact that he was in the open air, not in the
atmosphere of a closed room. Yet, last night out here, the cat had
made him feel faint. But he hardly gave a thought to this, for what
filled his mind was that he saw in the rather friendly interested
look of the beast that expression in the eye which had so baffled him
in his portrait of Lady Madingley. So, slowly, and without any sudden
movement that might startle the cat, he reached out his hand for the
palette he had just put down, and in a corner of the canvas not yet
painted over, recorded in half a dozen swift intuitive touches, what
he wanted. Even in the broad sunlight where the animal stood, its
eyes looked as if they were internally smouldering as well as being
lit from without: it was just so that Lady Madingley looked. He would
have to lay colour very thinly over white...</p>

<p>For five minutes or so he painted them with quiet eager strokes,
drawing the colour thinly over the background of white, and then
looked long at that sketch of the eye to see if he had got what he
wanted. Then he looked back at the cat which had stood so charmingly
for him. But there was no cat there. That, however, since he detested
them, and this one had served his purpose, was no matter for regret,
and he merely wondered a little at the suddenness of its
disappearance. But the legacy it had left on the canvas could not
vanish thus, it was his own, a possession, an achievement. Truly this
was to be a portrait which would altogether out-distance all he had
ever done before. A woman, real, alive, wearing her soul in her eyes,
should stand there, and summer riot round her.</p>

<p>An extraordinary clearness of vision was his all day, and towards
sunset an empty whisky-bottle.</p>

<p>But this evening he was conscious for the first time of two
feelings, one physical, one mental, altogether strange to him: the
first an impression that he had drunk as much as was good for him,
the second a sort of echo in his mind of those tortures he had
undergone in the autumn, when he had been tossed aside by the girl,
to whom he had given his soul, like a soiled glove.</p>

<p>Neither was at all acutely felt, but both were present to him.</p>

<p>The evening altogether belied the brilliance of the day, and about
six o'clock thick clouds had driven up over the sky, and the clear
heat of summer had given place to a heat no less intense, but full of
the menace of storm. A few big hot drops, too, of rain warned him
further, and he pulled his easel into shelter, and gave orders that
he would dine indoors. As was usual with him when he was at work, he
shunned the distracting influence of any companionship, and he dined
alone. Dinner finished, he went into his sitting-room prepared to
enjoy his solitary evening. His servant had brought him in the tray,
and till he went to bed he would be undisturbed. Outside the storm
was moving nearer, the reverberation of the thunder, though not yet
close, kept up a continual growl: any moment it might move up and
burst above in riot of fire and sound.</p>

<p>Dick read a book for a while, but his thoughts wandered. The
poignancy of his trouble last autumn, which he thought had passed
away from him for ever, grew suddenly and strangely more acute, also
his head was heavy, perhaps with the storm, but possibly with what he
had drunk. So, intending to go to bed and sleep off his disquietude,
he closed his book, and went across to the window to close that also.
But, half-way towards it, he stopped. There on the sofa below it sat
a large grey cat with yellow gleaming eyes. In its mouth it held a
young thrush, still alive.</p>

<p>Then horror woke in him: his feeling of sick-faintness was there,
and he loathed and was terrified at this dreadful feline glee in the
torture of its prey, a glee so great that it preferred the
postponement of its meal to a shortening of the other. More than all,
the resemblance of the eyes of this cat to those of his portrait
suddenly struck him as something hellish. For one moment this all
held him bound, as if with paralysis, the next his physical
shuddering could be withstood no longer, and he threw the glass he
carried at the cat, missing it. For one second the animal paused
there glaring at him with an intense and dreadful hostility, then it
made one spring of it out of the open window. Dick shut it with a
bang that startled himself, and then searched on the sofa and the
floor for the bird which he thought the cat had dropped. Once or
twice he thought he heard it feebly fluttering, but this must have
been an illusion, for he could not find it.</p>

<p>All this was rather shaky business, so before going to bed he
steadied himself, as his unspoken phrase ran, with a final drink.
Outside the thunder had ceased, but the rain beat hissing on to the
grass. Then another sound mingled with it the mewing of a cat, not
the long-drawn screeches and cries that are usual, but the plaintive
calls of the beast that wants to be admitted into its own home. The
blind was down, but after a while he could not resist peeping out.
There on the window-sill was seated the large grey cat. Though it was
raining heavily its fur seemed dry, for it was standing stiffly away
from its body. But when it saw him it spat at him, scratching angrily
at the glass, and vanished.</p>

<p>Lady Madingley...heavens, how he had loved her! And, infernally
as she had treated him, how passionately he wanted her now! Was all
his trouble, then, to begin over again? Had that nightmare dawned
anew on him? It was the cat's fault: the eyes of the cat had done it.
Yet just now all his desire was blurred by this dullness of brain
that was as unaccountable as the re-awakening of his desire. For
months now he had drunk far more than he had drunk to-day, yet
evening had seen him clear-headed, acute, master of himself, and
revelling in the liberty that had come to him, and in the cool joy of
creative vision. But to-night he stumbled and groped across the
room.</p>

<p>The neutral-coloured light of dawn awoke him, and he got up at
once, feeling still very drowsy, but in answer to some silent
imperative call. The storm had altogether passed away, and a jewel of
a morning star hung in a pale heaven. His room looked strangely
unfamiliar to him, his own sensations were unfamiliar, there was a
vagueness about things, a barrier between him and the world. One
desire alone possessed him, to finish the portrait. All else, so he
felt, he left to chance, or whatever laws regulate the world, those
laws which choose that a certain thrush shall be caught by a certain
cat, and choose one scapegoat out of a thousand, and let the rest go
free.</p>

<p>Two hours later his servant called him, and found him gone from
his room. So as the morning was so fair, he went out to lay breakfast
in the shelter. The portrait was there, it had been dragged back into
position by the clematis, but it was covered with strange scratches,
as if the claws of some enraged animal or the nails perhaps of a man
had furiously attacked it. Dick Alingham was there, too, lying very
still in front of the disfigured canvas. Claws, also, or nails had
attacked him, his throat was horribly mangled by them. But his hands
were covered with paint, the nails of his fingers too were choked
with it.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12"></a>The Gardener</h2>

<p>Two friends of mine, Hugh Grainger and his wife, had taken for a
month of Christmas holiday the house in which we were to witness such
strange manifestations, and when I received an invitation from them
to spend a fortnight there I returned them an enthusiastic
affirmative. Well already did I know that pleasant heathery
country-side, and most intimate was my acquaintance with the subtle
hazards of its most charming golf-links. Golf, I was given to
understand, was to occupy the solid day for Hugh and me, so that
Margaret should never be obliged to set her hand to the implements
with which the game, so detestable to her, was conducted...</p>

<p>I arrived there while yet the daylight lingered, and as my hosts
were out, I took a ramble round the place. The house and garden stood
on a plateau facing south; below it were a couple of acres of pasture
that sloped down to a vagrant stream crossed by a foot-bridge, by the
side of which stood a thatched cottage with a vegetable patch
surrounding it. A path ran close past this across the pasture from a
wicket-gate in the garden, conducted you over the foot-bridge, and,
so my remembered sense of geography told me, must constitute a short
cut to the links that lay not half a mile beyond. The cottage itself
was clearly on the land of the little estate, and I at once supposed
it to be the gardener's house. What went against so obvious and
simple a theory was that it appeared to be untenanted. No wreath of
smoke, though the evening was chilly, curled from its chimneys, and,
coming closer, I fancied it had that air of "waiting" about it which
we so often conjure into unused habitations. There it stood, with no
sign of life whatever about it, though ready, as its apparently
perfect state of repair seemed to warrant, for fresh tenants to put
the breath of life into it again. Its little garden, too, though the
palings were neat and newly painted, told the same tale; the beds
were untended and unweeded, and in the flower-border by the front
door was a row of chrysanthemums, which had withered on their stems.
But all this was but the impression of a moment, and I did not pause
as I passed it, but crossed the foot-bridge and went on up the
heathery slope that lay beyond. My geography was not at fault, for
presently I saw the club-house just in front of me. Hugh no doubt
would be just about coming in from his afternoon round, and so we
would walk back together. On reaching the club-house, however, the
steward told me that not five minutes before Mrs. Grainger had called
in her car for her husband, and I therefore retraced my steps by the
path along which I had already come. But I made a detour, as a golfer
will, to walk up the fairway of the seventeenth and eighteenth holes
just for the pleasure of recognition, and looked respectfully at the
yawning sandpit which so inexorably guards the eighteenth green,
wondering in what circumstances I should visit it next, whether with
a step complacent and superior, knowing that my ball reposed safely
on the green beyond, or with the heavy footfall of one who knows that
laborious delving lies before him.</p>

<p>The light of the winter evening had faded fast, and when I crossed
the foot-bridge on my return the dusk had gathered. To my right, just
beside the path, lay the cottage, the whitewashed walls of which
gleamed whitely in the gloaming; and as I turned my glance back from
it to the rather narrow plank which bridged the stream I thought I
caught out of the tail of my eye some light from one of its windows,
which thus disproved my theory that it was untenanted. But when I
looked directly at it again I saw that I was mistaken: some
reflection in the glass of the red lines of sunset in the west must
have deceived me, for in the inclement twilight it looked more
desolate than ever. Yet I lingered by the wicket gate in its low
palings, for though all exterior evidence bore witness to its
emptiness, some inexplicable feeling assured me, quite irrationally,
that this was not so, and that there was somebody there. Certainly
there was nobody visible, but, so this absurd idea informed me, he
might be at the back of the cottage concealed from me by the
intervening structure, and, still oddly, still unreasonably, it
became a matter of importance to my mind to ascertain whether this
was so or not, so clearly had my perceptions told me that the place
was empty, and so firmly had some conviction assured me that it was
tenanted. To cover my inquisitiveness, in case there was someone
there, I could inquire whether this path was a short cut to the house
at which I was staying, and, rather rebelling at what I was doing, I
went through the small garden, and rapped at the door. There was no
answer, and, after waiting for a response to a second summons, and
having tried the door and found it locked, I made the circuit of the
house. Of course there was no one there, and I told myself that I was
just like a man who looks under his bed for a burglar and would be
beyond measure astonished if he found one.</p>

<p>My hosts were at the house when I arrived, and we spent a cheerful
two hours before dinner in such desultory and eager conversation as
is proper between friends who have not met for some time. Between
Hugh Grainger and his wife it is always impossible to light on a
subject which does not vividly interest one or other of them, and
golf, politics, the needs of Russia, cooking, ghosts, the possible
victory over Mount Everest, and the income tax were among the topics
which we passionately discussed. With all these plates spinning, it
was easy to whip up any one of them, and the subject of spooks
generally was lighted upon again and again.</p>

<p>"Margaret is on the high road to madness," remarked Hugh on one of
these occasions, "for she has begun using planchette. If you use
planchette for six months, I am told, most careful doctors will
conscientiously certify you as insane. She's got five months more
before she goes to Bedlam."</p>

<p>"Does it work?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, it says most interesting things," said Margaret. "It says
things that never entered my head. We'll try it to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, not to-night," said Hugh. "Let's have an evening off."</p>

<p>Margaret disregarded this.</p>

<p>"It's no use asking planchette questions," she went on, "because
there is in your mind some sort of answer to them. If I ask whether
it will be fine to-morrow, for instance, it is probably I--though
indeed I don't mean to push--who makes the pencil say 'yes.'"</p>

<p>"And then it usually rains," remarked Hugh.</p>

<p>"Not always: don't interrupt. The interesting thing is to let the
pencil write what it chooses."</p>

<p>"Very often it only makes loops and curves--though they may mean
something--and every now and then a word comes, of the significance
of which I have no idea whatever, so I clearly couldn't have
suggested it. Yesterday evening, for instance, it wrote 'gardener'
over and over again. Now what did that mean? The gardener here is a
Methodist with a chin-beard. Could it have meant him? Oh, it's time
to dress. Please don't be late, my cook is so sensitive about
soup."</p>

<p>We rose, and some connection of ideas about "gardener" linked
itself up in my mind.</p>

<p>"By the way, what's that cottage in the field by the foot-bridge?"
I asked. "Is that the gardener's cottage?"</p>

<p>"It used to be," said Hugh. "But the chin-beard doesn't live
there: in fact nobody lives there."</p>

<p>"It's empty. If I was owner here, I should put the chin-beard into
it, and take the rent off his wages. Some people have no idea of
economy. Why did you ask?"</p>

<p>I saw Margaret was looking at me rather attentively.</p>

<p>"Curiosity," I said. "Idle curiosity."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it was," said she.</p>

<p>"But it was," I said. "It was idle curiosity to know whether the
house was inhabited. As I passed it, going down to the club-house, I
felt sure it was empty, but coming back I felt so sure that there was
someone there that I rapped at the door, and indeed walked round
it."</p>

<p>Hugh had preceded us upstairs, as she lingered a little.</p>

<p>"And there was no one there?" she asked. "It's odd: I had just the
same feeling as you about it."</p>

<p>"That explains planchette writing 'gardener' over and over again,"
said I. "You had the gardener's cottage on your mind."</p>

<p>"How ingenious!" said Margaret. "Hurry up and dress."</p>

<p>A gleam of strong moonlight between my drawn curtains when I went
up to bed that night led me to look out. My room faced the garden and
the fields which I had traversed that afternoon, and all was vividly
illuminated by the full moon. The thatched cottage with its white
walls close by the stream was very distinct, and once more, I
suppose, the reflection of the light on the glass of one of its
windows made it appear that the room was lit within. It struck me as
odd that twice that day this illusion should have been presented to
me, but now a yet odder thing happened.</p>

<p>Even as I looked the light was extinguished.</p>

<p>The morning did not at all bear out the fine promise of the clear
night, for when I woke the wind was squealing, and sheets of rain
from the south-west were dashed against my panes. Golf was wholly out
of the question, and, though the violence of the storm abated a
little in the afternoon, the rain dripped with a steady sullenness.
But I wearied of indoors, and, since the two others entirely refused
to set foot outside, I went forth mackintoshed to get a breath of
air. By way of an object in my tramp, I took the road to the links in
preference to the muddy short cut through the fields, with the
intention of engaging a couple of caddies for Hugh and myself next
morning, and lingered awhile over illustrated papers in the
smoking-room. I must have read for longer than I knew, for a sudden
beam of sunset light suddenly illuminated my page, and looking up, I
saw that the rain had ceased, and that evening was fast coming on. So
instead of taking the long detour by the road again, I set forth
homewards by the path across the fields. That gleam of sunset was the
last of the day, and once again, just as twenty-four hours ago, I
crossed the foot-bridge in the gloaming. Till that moment, as far as
I was aware, I had not thought at all about the cottage there, but
now in a flash the light I had seen there last night, suddenly
extinguished, recalled itself to my mind, and at the same moment I
felt that invincible conviction that the cottage was tenanted.
Simultaneously in these swift processes of thought I looked towards
it, and saw standing by the door the figure of a man. In the dusk I
could distinguish nothing of his face, if indeed it was turned to me,
and only got the impression of a tallish fellow, thickly built. He
opened the door, from which there came a dim light as of a lamp,
entered, and shut it after him.</p>

<p>So then my conviction was right. Yet I had been distinctly told
that the cottage was empty: who, then, was he that entered as if
returning home? Once more, this time with a certain qualm of fear, I
rapped on the door, intending to put some trivial question; and
rapped again, this time more drastically, so that there could be no
question that my summons was unheard. But still I got no reply, and
finally I tried the handle of the door. It was locked. Then, with
difficulty mastering an increasing terror, I made the circuit of the
cottage, peering into each unshuttered window. All was dark within,
though but two minutes ago I had seen the gleam of light escape from
the opened door.</p>

<p>Just because some chain of conjecture was beginning to form itself
in my mind, I made no allusion to this odd adventure, and after
dinner Margaret, amid protests from Hugh, got out the planchette
which had persisted in writing "gardener." My surmise was, of course,
utterly fantastic, but I wanted to convey no suggestion of any sort
to Margaret...For a long time the pencil skated over her paper
making loops and curves and peaks like a temperature chart, and she
had begun to yawn and weary over her experiment before any coherent
word emerged. And then, in the oddest way, her head nodded forward
and she seemed to have fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Hugh looked up from his book and spoke in a whisper to me.</p>

<p>"She fell asleep the other night over it," he said.</p>

<p>Margaret's eyes were closed, and she breathed the long, quiet
breaths of slumber, and then her hand began to move with a curious
firmness. Right across the big sheet of paper went a level line of
writing, and at the end her hand stopped with a jerk, and she
woke.</p>

<p>She looked at the paper.</p>

<p>"Hullo," she said. "Ah, one of you has been playing a trick on
me!"</p>

<p>We assured her that this was not so, and she read what she had
written.</p>

<p>"Gardener, gardener," it ran. "I am the gardener. I want to come
in. I can't find her here."</p>

<p>"O Lord, that gardener again!" said Hugh.</p>

<p>Looking up from the paper, I saw Margaret's eyes fixed on mine,
and even before she spoke I knew what her thought was.</p>

<p>"Did you come home by the empty cottage?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes: why?"</p>

<p>"Still empty?" she said in a low voice. "Or--or anything
else?"</p>

<p>I did not want to tell her just what I had seen--or what, at any
rate, I thought I had seen. If there was going to be anything odd,
anything worth observation, it was far better that our respective
impressions should not fortify each other.</p>

<p>"I tapped again, and there was no answer," I said.</p>

<p>Presently there was a move to bed: Margaret initiated it, and
after she had gone upstairs Hugh and I went to the front door to
interrogate the weather. Once more the moon shone in a clear sky, and
we strolled out along the flagged path that fronted the house.
Suddenly Hugh turned quickly and pointed to the angle of the
house.</p>

<p>"Who on earth is that?" he sad. "Look! There! He has gone round
the corner."</p>

<p>I had but the glimpse of a tallish man of heavy build.</p>

<p>"Didn't you see him?" asked Hugh. "I'll just go round the house,
and find him; I don't want anyone prowling round us at night. Wait
here, will you, and if he comes round the other corner ask him what
his business is."</p>

<p>Hugh had left me, in our stroll, close by the front door which was
open, and there I waited until he should have made his circuit. He
had hardly disappeared when I heard, quite distinctly, a rather quick
but heavy footfall coming along the paved walk towards me from the
opposite direction. But there was absolutely no one to be seen who
made this sound of rapid walking.</p>

<p>Closer and closer to me came the steps of the invisible one, and
then with a shudder of horror I felt somebody unseen push by me as I
stood on the threshold. That shudder was not merely of the spirit,
for the touch of him was that of ice on my hand. I tried to seize
this impalpable intruder, but he slipped from me, and next moment I
heard his steps on the parquet of the floor inside. Some door within
opened and shut, and I heard no more of him. Next moment Hugh came
running round the corner of the house from which the sound of steps
had approached.</p>

<p>"But where is he?" he asked. "He was not twenty yards in front of
me--a big, tall fellow."</p>

<p>"I saw nobody," I said. "I heard his step along the walk, but
there was nothing to be seen."</p>

<p>"And then?" asked Hugh.</p>

<p>"Whatever it was seemed to brush by me, and go into the house,"
said I.</p>

<p>There had certainly been no sound of steps on the bare oak stairs,
and we searched room after room through the ground floor of the
house. The dining-room door and that of the smoking-room were locked,
that into the drawing-room was open, and the only other door which
could have furnished the impression of an opening and a shutting was
that into the kitchen and servants' quarters. Here again our quest
was fruitless; through pantry and scullery and boot-room and
servants' hall we searched, but all was empty and quiet. Finally we
came to the kitchen, which too was empty. But by the fire there was
set a rocking-chair, and this was oscillating to and fro as if
someone, lately sitting there, had just quitted it. There it stood
gently rocking, and this seemed to convey the sense of a presence,
invisible now, more than even the sight of him who surely had been
sitting there could have done. I remember wanting to steady it and
stop it, and yet my hand refused to go forth to it.</p>

<p>What we had seen, and in especial what we had not seen, would have
been sufficient to furnish most people with a broken night, and
assuredly I was not among the strong-minded exceptions. Long I lay
wide-eyed and open-eared, and when at last I dozed I was plucked from
the border-land of sleep by the sound, muffled but unmistakable, of
someone moving about the house. It occurred to me that the steps
might be those of Hugh conducting a lonely exploration, but even
while I wondered a tap came at the door of communication between our
rooms, and, in answer to my response, it appeared that he had come to
see whether it was I thus uneasily wandering. Even as we spoke the
step passed my door, and the stairs leading to the floor above
creaked to its ascent. Next moment it sounded directly above our
heads in some attics in the roof.</p>

<p>"Those are not the servants' bedrooms," said Hugh. "No one sleeps
there. Let us look once more: it must be somebody."</p>

<p>With lit candles we made our stealthy way upstairs, and just when
we were at the top of the flight, Hugh, a step ahead of me, uttered a
sharp exclamation.</p>

<p>"But something is passing by me!" he said, and he clutched at the
empty air. Even as he spoke, I experienced the same sensation, and
the moment afterwards the stairs below us creaked again, as the
unseen passed down.</p>

<p>All night long that sound of steps moved about the passages, as if
someone was searching the house, and as I lay and listened that
message which had come through the pencil of the planchette to
Margaret's fingers occurred to me. "I want to come in. I cannot find
her here."...</p>

<p>Indeed someone had come in, and was sedulous in his search. He was
the gardener, it would seem. But what gardener was this invisible
seeker, and for whom did he seek?</p>

<p>Even as when some bodily pain ceases it is difficult to recall
with any vividness what the pain was like, so next morning, as I
dressed, I found myself vainly trying to recapture the horror of the
spirit which had accompanied these nocturnal adventures. I remembered
that something within me had sickened as I watched the movements of
the rocking-chair the night before and as I heard the steps along the
paved way outside, and by that invisible pressure against me knew
that someone had entered the house. But now in the sane and tranquil
morning, and all day under the serene winter sun, I could not realise
what it had been. The presence, like the bodily pain, had to be there
for the realisation of it, and all day it was absent. Hugh felt the
same; he was even disposed to be humorous on the subject.</p>

<p>"Well, he's had a good look," he said, "whoever he is, and
whomever he was looking for. By the way, not a word to Margaret,
please. She heard nothing of these perambulations, nor of the entry
of--of whatever it was. Not gardener, anyhow: who ever heard of a
gardener spending his time walking about the house? If there were
steps all over the potato-patch, I might have been with you."</p>

<p>Margaret had arranged to drive over to have tea with some friends
of hers that afternoon, and in consequence Hugh and I refreshed
ourselves at the club-house after our game, and it was already dusk
when for the third day in succession I passed homewards by the
whitewashed cottage. But to-night I had no sense of it being subtly
occupied; it stood mournfully desolate, as is the way of untenanted
houses, and no light nor semblance of such gleamed from its
windows.</p>

<p>Hugh, to whom I had told the odd impressions I had received there,
gave them a reception as flippant as that which he had accorded to
the memories of the night, and he was still being humorous about them
when we came to the door of the house.</p>

<p>"A psychic disturbance, old boy," he said. "Like a cold in the
head. Hullo, the door's locked."</p>

<p>He rang and rapped, and from inside came the noise of a turned key
and withdrawn bolts.</p>

<p>"What's the door locked for?" he asked his servant who opened
it.</p>

<p>The man shifted from one foot to the other.</p>

<p>"The bell rang half an hour ago, sir," he said, "and when I came
to answer it there was a man standing outside, and--"</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Hugh.</p>

<p>"I didn't like the looks of him, sir," he said, "and I asked him
his business. He didn't say anything, and then he must have gone
pretty smartly away, for I never saw him go."</p>

<p>"Where did he seem to go?" asked Hugh, glancing at me.</p>

<p>"I can't rightly say, sir. He didn't seem to go at all. Something
seemed to brush by me."</p>

<p>"That'll do," said Hugh rather sharply.</p>

<p>Margaret had not come in from her visit, but when soon after the
crunch of the motor wheels was heard Hugh reiterated his wish that
nothing should be said to her about the impression which now,
apparently, a third person shared with us. She came in with a flush
of excitement on her face.</p>

<p>"Never laugh at my planchette again," she said. "I've heard the
most extraordinary story from Maud Ashfield--horrible, but so
frightfully interesting."</p>

<p>"Out with it," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"Well, there was a gardener here," she said. "He used to live at
that little cottage by the foot-bridge, and when the family were up
in London he and his wife used to be caretakers and live here."</p>

<p>Hugh's glance and mine met: then he turned away.</p>

<p>I knew, as certainly as if I was in his mind, that his thoughts
were identical with my own.</p>

<p>"He married a wife much younger than himself," continued Margaret,
"and gradually he became frightfully jealous of her. And one day in a
fit of passion he strangled her with his own hands. A little while
after someone came to the cottage, and found him sobbing over her,
trying to restore her. They went for the police, but before they came
he had cut his own throat. Isn't it all horrible? But surely it's
rather curious that the planchette said 'Gardener. I am the gardener.
I want to come in. I can't find her here.' You see I knew nothing
about it. I shall do planchette again to-night. Oh dear me, the post
goes in half an hour, and I have a whole budget to send. But respect
my planchette for the future, Hughie."</p>

<p>We talked the situation out when she had gone, but Hugh,
unwillingly convinced and yet unwilling to admit that something more
than coincidence lay behind that "planchette nonsense," still
insisted that Margaret should be told nothing of what we had heard
and seen in the house last night, and of the strange visitor who
again this evening, so we must conclude, had made his entry.</p>

<p>"She'll be frightened," he said, "and she'll begin imagining
things. As for the planchette, as likely as not it will do nothing
but scribble and make loops. What's that? Yes: come in!"</p>

<p>There had come from somewhere in the room one sharp, peremptory
rap. I did not think it came from the door, but Hugh, when no
response replied to his words of admittance, jumped up and opened it.
He took a few steps into the hall outside, and returned.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly. No one there?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul."</p>

<p>Hugh came back to the fireplace and rather irritably threw a
cigarette which he had just lit into the fender.</p>

<p>"That was rather a nasty jar," he observed; "and if you ask me
whether I feel comfortable, I can tell you I never felt less
comfortable in my life. I'm frightened, if you want to know, and I
believe you are too."</p>

<p>I hadn't the smallest intention of denying this, and he went
on.</p>

<p>"We've got to keep a hand on ourselves," he said. "There's nothing
so infectious as fear, and Margaret mustn't catch it from us. But
there's something more than our fear, you know."</p>

<p>"Something has got into the house and we're up against it. I never
believed in such things before."</p>

<p>"Let's face it for a minute. What is it anyhow?"</p>

<p>"If you want to know what I think it is," said I, "I believe it to
be the spirit of the man who strangled his wife and then cut his
throat. But I don't see how it can hurt us. We're afraid of our own
fear really."</p>

<p>"But we're up against it," said Hugh. "And what will it do? Good
Lord, if I only knew what it would do I shouldn't mind. It's the not
knowing...Well, it's time to dress."</p>

<p>Margaret was in her highest spirits at dinner. Knowing nothing of
the manifestations of that presence which had taken place in the last
twenty-four hours, she thought it absorbingly interesting that her
planchette should have "guessed" (so ran her phrase) about the
gardener, and from that topic she flitted to an equally interesting
form of patience for three which her friend had showed her, promising
to initiate us into it after dinner. This she did, and, not knowing
that we both above all things wanted to keep planchette at a
distance, she was delighted with the success of her game. But
suddenly she observed that the evening was burning rapidly away, and
swept the cards together at the conclusion of a hand.</p>

<p>"Now just half an hour of planchette," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, mayn't we play one more hand?" asked Hugh. "It's the best
game I've seen for years."</p>

<p>"Planchette will be dismally slow after this."</p>

<p>"Darling, if the gardener will only communicate again, it won't be
slow," said she.</p>

<p>"But it is such drivel," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"How rude you are! Read your book, then."</p>

<p>Margaret had already got out her machine and a sheet of paper,
when Hugh rose.</p>

<p>"Please don't do it to-night, Margaret," he said.</p>

<p>"But why? You needn't attend."</p>

<p>"Well, I ask you not to, anyhow," said he.</p>

<p>Margaret looked at him closely.</p>

<p>"Hughie, you've got something on your mind," she said. "Out with
it. I believe you're nervous. You think there is something queer
about. What is it?"</p>

<p>I could see Hugh hesitating as to whether to tell her or not, and
I gathered that he chose the chance of her planchette inanely
scribbling.</p>

<p>"Go on, then," he said.</p>

<p>Margaret hesitated: she clearly did not want to vex Hugh, but his
insistence must have seemed to her most unreasonable.</p>

<p>"Well, just ten minutes," she said, "and I promise not to think of
gardeners."</p>

<p>She had hardly laid her hand on the board when her head fell
forward, and the machine began moving. I was sitting close to her,
and as it rolled steadily along the paper the writing became
visible.</p>

<p>"I have come in," it ran, "but still I can't find her. Are you
hiding her? I will search the room where you are."</p>

<p>What else was written but still concealed underneath the
planchette I did not know, for at that moment a current of icy air
swept round the room, and at the door, this time unmistakably, came a
loud, peremptory knock. Hugh sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Margaret, wake up," he said, "something is coming!"</p>

<p>The door opened, and there moved in the figure of a man. He stood
just within the door, his head bent forward, and he turned it from
side to side, peering, it would seem, with eyes staring and
infinitely sad, into every corner of the room.</p>

<p>"Margaret, Margaret," cried Hugh again.</p>

<p>But Margaret's eyes were open too; they were fixed on this
dreadful visitor.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Hughie," she said below her breath, rising as she
spoke. The ghost was now looking directly at her. Once the lips above
the thick, rust-coloured beard moved, but no sound came forth, the
mouth only moved and slavered. He raised his head, and, horror upon
horror, I saw that one side of his neck was laid open in a red,
glistening gash...</p>

<p>For how long that pause continued, when we all three stood stiff
and frozen in some deadly inhibition to move or speak, I have no
idea: I suppose that at the utmost it was a dozen seconds.</p>

<p>Then the spectre turned, and went out as it had come. We heard his
steps pass along the parqueted floor; there was the sound of bolts
withdrawn from the front door, and with a crash that shook the house
it slammed to.</p>

<p>"It's all over," said Margaret. "God have mercy on him!"</p>

<p>Now the reader may put precisely what construction he pleases on
this visitation from the dead.</p>

<p>He need not, indeed, consider it to have been a visitation from
the dead at all, but say that there had been impressed on the scene,
where this murder and suicide happened, some sort of emotional
record, which in certain circumstances could translate itself into
images visible and invisible. Waves of ether, or what not, may
conceivably retain the impress of such scenes; they may be held, so
to speak, in solution, ready to be precipitated. Or he may hold that
the spirit of the dead man indeed made itself manifest, revisiting in
some sort of spiritual penance and remorse the place where his crime
was committed. Naturally, no materialist will entertain such an
explanation for an instant, but then there is no one so obstinately
unreasonable as the materialist. Beyond doubt a dreadful deed was
done there, and Margaret's last utterance is not inapplicable.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13"></a>The China Bowl</h2>

<p>I had long been on the look-out for one of the small houses at the
south end of that delectable oblong called Barrett's Square, but for
many months there was never revealed to me that which I so much I
desired to see--namely, a notice-board advertising that one of these
charming little abodes was to be let.</p>

<p>At length, however, in the autumn of the current year, in one of
my constant passages through the square, I saw what my eye had so
long starved for, and within ten minutes I was in the office of the
agent in whose hands the disposal of No. 29 had been placed.</p>

<p>A communicative clerk informed me that the present lessee, Sir
Arthur Bassenthwaite, was anxious to get rid of the remainder of his
lease as soon as possible, for the house had painful associations for
him, owing to the death of his wife, which had taken place there not
long before.</p>

<p>He was a wealthy man, so I was informed, Lady Bassenthwaite having
been a considerable heiress, and was willing to take what is
professionally known as a ridiculously low price, in order to get the
house off his hand without delay. An order 'to view' was thereupon
given me, and a single visit next morning was sufficient to show that
this was precisely what I had been looking for.</p>

<p>Why Sir Arthur should be so suddenly anxious to get rid of it, at
a price which certainly was extremely moderate, was no concern of
mine, provided the drains were in good order, and within a week the
necessary business connected with the transference of the lease was
arranged. The house was in excellent repair, and less than a month
from the time I had first seen the notice-board up, I was
ecstatically established there.</p>

<p>I had not been in the house more than a week or two when, one
afternoon, I was told that Sir Arthur had called, and would like to
see me if I was disengaged. He was shown up, and I found myself in
the presence of one of the most charming men I have ever had the good
fortune to meet.</p>

<p>The motive of his call, it appeared, was of the politest nature,
for he wished to be assured that I found the house comfortable and
that it suited me. He intimated that it would be a pleasure to him to
see round, and together we went over the whole house, with the
exception of one room.</p>

<p>This was the front bedroom on the third floor, the largest of the
two spare rooms, and at the door, as I grasped the handle, he stopped
me.</p>

<p>'You will excuse me,' he said, 'for not coming in here. The room,
I may tell you, has the most painful associations for me.'</p>

<p>This was sufficiently explicit; I made no doubt that it was in
this room that his wife had died.</p>

<p>It was a lovely October afternoon, and, having made the tour of
the house, we went out into the little garden with its tiled walk
that lay at the back, and was one of the most attractive features of
the place. Low brick walls enclosed it, separating it on each side
from my neighbours, and at the bottom from the pedestrian
thoroughfare that ran past the back of the row of houses.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur lingered here some little while, lost, I suppose, in
regretful memories of the days when perhaps he and his companion
planned and executed the decoration of the little plot.</p>

<p>Indeed, he hinted as much when, shortly after, he took his
leave.</p>

<p>'There is so much here,' he said, 'that is very intimately bound
up with me. I thank you a thousand times for letting me see the
little garden again.' And once more, as he turned to go into the
house, his eyes looked steadfastly and wistfully down the bright
borders.</p>

<p>The regulations about the lighting of houses in London had some
little while previously demanded a more drastic dusk, and a night or
two later, as I returned home after dinner through the impenetrable
obscurity of the streets, I was horrified to find a bright light
streaming cheerfully from the upper windows in my house, with no
blinds to obscure it.</p>

<p>It came from the front bedroom on the third floor, and, letting
myself in, I proceeded hurriedly upstairs to quench this forbidden
glow. But when I entered, I found the room in darkness, and, on
turning up the lights myself, I saw that the blinds were drawn down,
so that even if it had been lit, I could not have seen from outside
the illumination which had made me hasten upstairs.</p>

<p>An explanation easily occurred to me: no doubt the light I had
seen did not come from my house, but from windows of a house
adjoining. I had only given one glance at it, and with this
demonstration that I had been mistaken, I gave no further conscious
thought to the matter. But subconsciously I felt that I knew that I
had made no mistake: I had not in that hurried glance confused the
windows of the house next door with my own; it was this room that had
been lit.</p>

<p>I had moved into the house, as I have said, with extraordinary
expedition, and for the next day or two I was somewhat busily
engaged, after my day's work was over, in sorting out and largely
destroying accumulations of old books and papers, which I had not had
time to go through before my move. Among them I came across an
illustrated magazine which I had kept for some forgotten reason, and
turning over the pages to try to ascertain why I had preserved it, I
suddenly came across a picture of my own back-garden. The title at the
top of the page showed me that the article in question was an
interview with Lady Bassenthwaite, and her portrait and that of her
husband made a frontispiece to it.</p>

<p>The coincidence was a curious one, for here I read about the house
which I now occupied, and saw what it had been like in the reign of
its late owners. But I did not spend long over it, and added the
magazine to the pile of papers destined for destruction. This grew
steadily, and when I had finished turning out the cupboard which I
had resolved to empty before going to bed, I found it was already an
hour or more past midnight.</p>

<p>I had been so engrossed in my work that I had let the fire go out,
and myself get hungry, and went into the dining-room, which opened
into the little back-garden, to see if the fire still smouldered
there, and a biscuit could be found in the cupboard. In both respects
I was in luck, and whilst eating and warming myself, I suddenly
thought I heard a step on the tiled walk in the garden outside.</p>

<p>I quickly went to the window and drew aside the thick curtain,
letting all the light in the room pour out into the garden, and
there, beyond doubt, was a man bending over one of the beds.</p>

<p>Startled by this illumination, he rose, and without looking round,
ran to the end of the little yard and, with surprising agility,
vaulted on to the top of the wall and disappeared.</p>

<p>But at the last second, as he sat silhouetted there, I saw his
face in the shaded light of a gas-lamp outside, and, to my
indescribable astonishment, I recognized Sir Arthur Bassenthwaite.
The glimpse was instantaneous, but I was sure I was not mistaken, any
more than I had been mistaken about the light which came from the
bedroom that looked out on to the square.</p>

<p>But whatever tender associations Sir Arthur had with the garden
that had once been his, it was not seemly that he should adopt such
means of indulging them. Moreover, where Sir Arthur might so easily
come, there, too, might others whose intentions were less concerned
with sentiment than with burglary.</p>

<p>In any case, I did not choose that my garden should have such easy
access from outside, and next morning I ordered a pretty stiff
barrier of iron spikes to be erected along the outer wall. If Sir
Arthur wished to muse in the garden, I should be delighted to give
him permission, as, indeed, he must have known from the cordiality
which I was sure I showed him when he called, but this method of his
seemed to me irregular. And I observed next evening, without any
regret at all, that my order had been promptly executed. At the same
time I felt an invincible curiosity to know for certain if it was
merely for the sake of a solitary midnight vigil that he had
come.</p>

<p>I was expecting the arrival of my friend Hugh Grainger the next
week, to stay a night or two with me, and since the front spare room,
which I proposed to give him, had not at present been slept in, I
gave orders that a bed should be made up there the next night for me,
so that I could test with my own vile body whether a guest would be
comfortable there.</p>

<p>This can only be proved by personal experience. Though there may
be a table apparently convenient to the head of the bed, though the
dressing-table may apparently be properly disposed, though it seem as
if the lighting was rightly placed for reading in bed, and for the
quenching of it afterwards without disturbance, yet practice and not
theory is the only method of settling such questions, and next night
accordingly I both dressed for dinner in this front spare room, and
went to bed there.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to work smoothly; the room itself had a pleasant
and restful air about it, and the bed exceedingly comfortable, I fell
asleep almost as soon as I had put out the electric light, which I
had found adequate for reading small print. To the best of my
knowledge, neither the thought of the last occupant of the room nor
of the light that I believed I had seen burning there one night
entered my head at all.</p>

<p>I fell asleep, as I say, at once, but instantly that theatre of
the brain, on the boards of which dreams are transacted, was brightly
illuminated for me, and the curtain went up on one of those appalling
nightmare-pieces which we can only vaguely remember afterwards.</p>

<p>There was the sense of flight--clogged, impotent flight from
before some hideous spiritual force--the sense of powerlessness to
keep away from the terror that gained on me, the strangling desire to
scream, and soon the blessed dawning consciousness that it was but
with a dream that I wrestled.</p>

<p>I began to know that I was lying in bed, and that my terrors were
imaginary, but the trouble was not over yet, for with all my efforts
I could not raise my head from the pillow nor open my eyes.</p>

<p>Then, as I drew nearer to the boundaries of waking, I became aware
that even when the spell of my dream was altogether broken I should
not be free. For through my eyelids, which I knew had closed in a
darkened room, there now streamed in a vivid light, and remembering
for the first time what I had seen from the square outside, I knew
that when I opened them they would look out on to a lit room, peopled
with who knew what phantoms of the dead or living.</p>

<p>I lay there for a few moments after I had recovered complete
consciousness, with eyes still closed, and felt the trickle of sweat
on my forehead. That horror I knew was not wholly due to the
self-coined nightmare of my brain; it was the horror of expectancy
more than of retrospect.</p>

<p>And then curiosity, sheer stark curiosity, to know what was
happening on the other side of the curtain of my eyelids prevailed,
and I sat and looked.</p>

<p>In the armchair just opposite the foot of my bed sat Lady
Bassenthwaite, whose picture I had seen in the illustrated magazine.
It simply was she; there could be no doubt whatever about it.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a bedgown, and in her hand was a small fluted
china bowl with a cover and a saucer. As I looked she took the cover
off, and began to feed herself with a spoon. She took some half-dozen
mouthfuls, and then replaced the cover again. As she did this she
turned full face towards where I lay, looking straight at me, and
already the shadow of death was fallen on her.</p>

<p>Then she rose feebly, wearily, and took a step towards the bed. As
she did this, the light in the room, from whatever source it came,
suddenly faded, and I found myself looking out into impenetrable
darkness.</p>

<p>My curiosity for the present was more than satisfied, and in a
couple of minutes I had transferred myself to the room below.</p>

<p>Hugh Grainger, the ruling passion of whose life is crime and
ghosts, arrived next day, and I poured into an eager ear the whole
history of the events here narrated.</p>

<p>'Of course, I'll sleep in the room,' he said at the conclusion.
'Put another bed in it, can't you, and sleep there, too. A couple of
simultaneous witnesses of the same phenomena are ten times more
valuable than one. Or do you funk?' he added as a kind
afterthought.</p>

<p>'I funk, but I will,' I said.</p>

<p>'And are you sure it wasn't all part of your dream?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Absolutely positive.'</p>

<p>Hugh's eye glowed with pleasure.</p>

<p>'I funk, too,' he said. 'I funk horribly. But that's part of the
allurement. It's so difficult to get frightened nowadays. All but a
few things are explained and accounted for. What one fears is the
unknown. No one knows yet what ghosts are, or why they appear, or to
whom.</p>

<p>He took a turn up and down the room.</p>

<p>'And what do you make of Sir Arthur creeping into your garden at
night?' he asked. 'Is there any possible connection?'</p>

<p>'Not as far as I can see. What connection could there be?'</p>

<p>'It isn't very obvious certainly. I really don't know why I asked.
And you liked him?'</p>

<p>'Immensely. But not enough to let him get over my garden wall at
midnight,' said I.</p>

<p>Hugh laughed.</p>

<p>'That would certainly imply a considerable degree of confidence
and affection,' he said.</p>

<p>I had caused another bed to be moved into Hugh's room, and that
night, after he had put out the light, we talked awhile and then
relapsed into silence. It was cold, and I watched the fire on the
hearth die down from flame into glowing coal, and from glow into
clinkering ash, while nothing disturbed the peaceful atmosphere of
the quiet room. Then it seemed to me as if something broke in, and
instead of lying tranquilly awake, I found a certain horror of
expectancy, some note of nightmare begin to hum through my waking
consciousness. I heard Hugh toss and turn and turn again, and at
length he spoke.</p>

<p>'I say, I'm feeling fairly beastly,' he said, 'and yet there's
nothing to see or hear.'</p>

<p>'Same with me,' said I.</p>

<p>'Do you mind if I turn up the light a minute, and have a look
round?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Not a bit.'</p>

<p>He fumbled at the switch, the room leapt into light, and he sat up
in bed frowning. Everything was quite as usual, the bookcase, the
chairs, on one of which he had thrown his clothes; there was nothing
that differentiated this room from hundreds of others where the
occupants lay quietly sleeping.</p>

<p>'It's queer,' he said, and switched off the light again.</p>

<p>There is nothing harder than to measure time in the dark, but I do
not think it was long that I lay there with the sense of nightmare
growing momentarily on me before he spoke again in an odd, cracked
voice.</p>

<p>'It's coming,' he said.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as he spoke I saw that the thick darkness of the
room was sensibly thinning.</p>

<p>The blackness was less complete, though I could hardly say that
light began to enter. Then by degrees I saw the shape of chairs, the
lines of the fireplace, the end of Hugh's bed begin to outline
themselves, and as I watched the darkness vanished altogether, as if
a lamp had been turned up.</p>

<p>And in the chair at the foot of Hugh's bed sat Lady Bassenthwaite,
and again putting aside the cover of her dish, she sipped the
contents of the bowl, and at the end rose feebly, wearily, as in
mortal sickness. She looked at Hugh, and turning, she looked at me,
and through the shadow of death that lay over her face, I thought
that in her eyes was a demand, or at least a statement of her case.
They were not angry, they did not cry for justice, but the calm
inexorable gaze of justice that must be done was there...Then the
light faded and died out.</p>

<p>I heard a rustle from the other bed and the springs creaked.</p>

<p>'Good Lord,' said Hugh, 'where's the light?'</p>

<p>His fingers fumbled and found it, and I saw that he was already
out of bed, with streaming forehead and chattering teeth.</p>

<p>'I know now,' he said. 'I half guessed before. Come
downstairs.'</p>

<p>Downstairs we went, and he turned up all the passage lights as we
passed. He led the way into the dining room, picking up the poker and
the shovel as he went by the fireplace, and he threw open the door
into the garden. I switched up the light, which threw a bright square
of illumination over the garden.</p>

<p>'Where did you see Sir Arthur?' he said. 'Where? Exactly
where?'</p>

<p>Still not guessing what he sought, I pointed out to him the spot,
and loosening the earth with the poker, he dug into the bed. Once
again he plunged the poker down, and as he removed the earth I heard
the shovel grate on something hard. And then I guessed.</p>

<p>Already Hugh was at work with his fingers in the earth, and slowly
and carefully he drew out fragments of a broken china cover. Then,
delving again, he raised from the hole a fluted china bowl. And I
knew I had seen it before, once and twice.</p>

<p>We carried this indoors and cleaned the earth from it. All over
the bottom of the bowl was a layer of some thick porridge-like
substance, and a portion of this I sent next day to a chemist, asking
him for his analysis of it. The basis of it proved to be oatmeal, and
in it was mixed a considerable quantity of arsenic.</p>

<p>Hugh and I were together in my little sitting room close to the
front door, where on the table stood the china bowl with the
fragments of its cover and saucer, when this report was brought to
us, and we read it together. The afternoon was very dark and we stood
close to the window to decipher the minute handwriting, when there
passed the figure of Sir Arthur Bassenthwaite. He saw me, waved his
hand, and a moment afterwards the front door bell rang.</p>

<p>'Let him come in,' said Hugh. 'Let him see that on the table.'</p>

<p>Next moment my servant entered, and asked if the caller might see
me.</p>

<p>'Let him see it,' repeated Hugh. 'The chances are that we shall
know if he sees it unexpectedly.'</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause while in the hall, I suppose, Sir
Arthur was taking off his coat.</p>

<p>Outside, some few doors off, a traction engine, which had passed a
minute before, stopped, and began slowly coming backwards again,
crunching the newly-laid stones. Sir Arthur entered.</p>

<p>'I ventured to call,' he began, and then his glance fell on the
bowl. In one second the very aspect of humanity was stripped from his
face. His mouth drooped open, his eyes grew monstrous and protruding,
and what had been the pleasant, neat-featured face of a man was a
mask of terror, a gargoyle, a nightmare countenance. Even before the
door that had been open to admit him was closed, he had turned and
gone with a crouching, stumbling run from the room, and I heard him
at the latch of the front door.</p>

<p>Whether what followed was design or accident, I shall never know,
for from the window I saw him fall forward, almost as if he threw
himself there, straight in front of the broad crunching wheels of the
traction engine, and before the driver could stop, or even think of
stopping, the iron roller had gone over his head.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14"></a>Gavon's Eve</h2>

<p>It is only the largest kind of ordnance map that records the
existence of the village of Gavon, in the shire of Sutherland, and it
is perhaps surprising that any map on whatever scale should mark so
small and huddled a group of huts, set on a bare, bleak headland
between moor and sea, and, so one would have thought, of no import at
all to any who did not happen to live there. But the river Gavon, on
the right bank of which stand this half-dozen of chimneyless and
wind-swept habitations, is a geographical fact of far greater
interest to outsiders, for the salmon there are heavy fish, the mouth
of the river is clear of nets, and all the way up to Gavon Loch, some
six miles inland, the coffee-coloured water lies in pool after deep
pool, which verge, if the river is in order and the angler moderately
sanguine, on a fishing probability amounting almost to a certainty.
In any case, during the first fortnight of September last I had no
blank day on those delectable waters, and up till the 15th of that
month there was no day on which some one at the lodge in which I was
stopping did not land a fish out of the famous Picts' pool. But after
the 15th that pool was not fished again. The reason why is here set
forward.</p>

<p>The river at this point, after some hundred yards of rapid, makes
a sudden turn round a rocky angle, and plunges madly into the pool
itself. Very deep water lies at the head of it, but deeper still
further down on the east side, where a portion of the stream flicks
back again in a swift dark backwater towards the top of the pool
again. It is fishable only from the western bank, for to the east,
above this backwater, a great wall of black and basaltic rock, heaved
up no doubt by some fault in strata, rises sheer from the river to
the height of some sixty feet. It is in fact nearly precipitous on
both sides, heavily serrated at the top, and of so curious a
thinness, that at about the middle of it where a fissure breaks its
topmost edge, and some twenty feet from the top, there exists a long
hole, a sort of lancet window, one would say, right through the rock,
so that a slit of daylight can be seen through it. Since, therefore,
no one would care to cast his line standing perched on that
razor-edged eminence, the pool must needs be fished from the western
bank. A decent fly, however, will cover it all.</p>

<p>It is on the western bank that there stand the remains of that
which gave its title to the pool, namely, the ruins of a Pict castle,
built out of rough and scarcely hewn masonry, unmortared but on a
certain large and impressive scale, and in a very well-preserved
condition considering its extreme antiquity. It is circular in shape
and measures some twenty yards of diameter in its internal span. A
staircase of large blocks with a rise of at least a foot leads up to
the main gate, and opposite this on the side towards the river is
another smaller postern through which down a rather hazardously steep
slope a scrambling path, where progress demands both caution and
activity, conducts to the head of the pool which lies immediately
beneath it. A gate-chamber still roofed over exists in the solid
wall: inside there are foundation indications of three rooms, and in
the centre of all a very deep hole, probably a well. Finally, just
outside the postern leading to the river is a small artificially
levelled platform, some twenty feet across, as if made to support
some super-incumbent edifice. Certain stone slabs and blocks are
dispersed over it.</p>

<p>Brora, the post-town of Gavon, lies some six miles to the
south-west, and from it a track over the moor leads to the rapids
immediately above the Picts' pool, across which by somewhat
extravagant striding from boulder to boulder a man can pass dry-foot
when the river is low, and make his way up a steep path to the north
of the basaltic rock, and so to the village. But this transit demands
a steady head, and at the best is a somewhat giddy passage. Otherwise
the road between it and Brora lies in a long detour higher up the
moor, passing by the gates of Gavon Lodge, where I was stopping. For
some vague and ill-defined reason the pool itself and the Picts'
Castle had an uneasy reputation on the countryside, and several times
trudging back from a day's fishing I have known my gillie take a
longish circuit, though heavy with fish, rather than make this short
cut in the dusk by the castle. On the first occasion when Sandy, a
strapping yellow-bearded viking of twenty-five, did this he gave as a
reason that the ground round about the castle was "mossy," though as
a God-fearing man he must have known he lied. But on another occasion
he was more frank, and said that the Picts' pool was "no canny" after
sunset. I am now inclined to agree with him, though, when he lied
about it, I think it was because as a God-fearing man he feared the
devil also.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of September 14 that I was walking back with
my host, Hugh Graham, from the forest beyond the lodge. It had been a
day unseasonably hot for the time of year, and the hills were
blanketed with soft, furry clouds. Sandy, the gillie of whom I have
spoken, was behind with the ponies, and, idly enough, I told Hugh
about his strange distaste for the Picts' pool after sunset. He
listened, frowning a little.</p>

<p>"That's curious," he said. "I know there is some dim local
superstition about the place, but last year certainly Sandy used to
laugh at it. I remember asking him what ailed the place, and he said
he thought nothing about the rubbish folk talked. But this year you
say he avoids it."</p>

<p>"On several occasions with me he has done so."</p>

<p>Hugh smoked a while in silence, striding noiselessly over the
dusky fragrant heather.</p>

<p>"Poor chap," he said, "I don't know what to do about him. He's
becoming useless."</p>

<p>"Drink?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, drink in a secondary manner. But trouble led to drink, and
trouble, I am afraid, is leading him to worse than drink."</p>

<p>"The only thing worse than drink is the devil," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Precisely. That's where he is going. He goes there often."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, it's rather curious," said Hugh. "You know I dabble a bit
in folklore and local superstition, and I believe I am on the track
of something odder than odd. Just wait a moment."</p>

<p>We stood there in the gathering dusk till the ponies laboured up
the hillside to us, Sandy with his six feet of lithe strength
strolling easily beside them up the steep brae, as if his long day's
trudging had but served to half awaken his dormant powers of
limb.</p>

<p>"Going to see Mistress Macpherson again tonight?" asked Hugh.</p>

<p>"Aye, puir body," said Sandy. "She's auld, and she's lone."</p>

<p>"Very kind of you, Sandy," said Hugh, and we walked on.</p>

<p>"What then?" I asked when the ponies had fallen behind again.</p>

<p>"Why, superstition lingers here," said Hugh, "and it's supposed
she's a witch. To be quite candid with you, the thing interests me a
good deal. Supposing you asked me, on oath, whether I believed in
witches, I should say 'No.' But if you asked me again, on oath,
whether I suspected I believed in them, I should, I think, say 'Yes.'
And the fifteenth of this month--to-morrow--is Gavon's Eve."</p>

<p>"And what in Heaven's name is that?" I asked. "And who is Gavon?
And what's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Well, Gavon is the person, I suppose, not saint, who is what we
should call the eponymous hero of this district. And the trouble is
Sandy's trouble. Rather a long story. But there's a long mile in
front of us yet, if you care to be told."

<p>During that mile I heard. Sandy had been engaged a year ago to girl of
Gavon who was in service at Inverness. In March last he had gone, without giving
notice, to see her, and as he walked up the street in which her mistress's house
stood, had met her suddenly face to face, in company with a man whose
clipped speech betrayed him English, whose manner a kind of
gentleman. He had a flourish of his hat for Sandy, pleasure to see
him, and scarcely any need of explanation as to how he came to be
walking with Catrine. It was the most natural thing possible, for a
city like Inverness boasted its innocent urbanities, and a girl could
stroll with a man. And for the time, since also Catrine was so
frankly pleased to see him, Sandy was satisfied. But after his return
to Gavon, suspicion, fungus-like, grew rank in his mind, with the
result that a month ago he had, with infinite pains and blottings,
written a letter to Catrine, urging her return and immediate marriage.
Thereafter it was known that she had left Inverness; it was known
that she had arrived by train at Brora. From Brora she had started to
walked across the moor by the path leading just above the Picts'
Castle, crossing the rapids to Gavon, leaving her box to be sent by
the carrier. But at Gavon she had never arrived. Also it was said
that, although it was hot afternoon, she wore a big cloak.</p>

<p>By this time we had come to the lodge, the lights of which showed
dim and blurred through the thick hill-mists that had streamed
sullenly down from the higher ground.</p>

<p>"And the rest," said Hugh, "which is as fantastic as this is sober
fact, I will tell you later."</p>

<p>Now, a fruit-bearing determination to go to bed is, to my mind, as
difficult to ripen as a fruit-bearing determination to get up, and in
spite of our long day, I was glad when Hugh (the rest of the men
having yawned themselves out of the smoking-room) came back from the
hospitable dispensing of bedroom candlesticks with a briskness that
denoted that, as far as he was concerned, the distressing
determination was not imminent.</p>

<p>"As regards Sandy," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Ah, I also was thinking of that," he said. "Well, Catrine Gordon
left Brora, and never arrived here. That is fact. Now for what
remains. Have you any remembrance of a woman always alone walking
about the moor by the loch? I think I once called your attention to
her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember," I said. "Not Catrine, surely; a very old woman,
awful to look at.</p>

<p>"Moustache, whiskers, and muttering to herself. Always looking at
the ground, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is she--not Catrine. Catrine! My word, a May morning!
But the other--it is Mrs. Macpherson, reputed witch. Well, Sandy
trudges there, a mile and more away, every night to see her. You know
Sandy: Adonis of the north. Now, can you account by any natural
explanation for that fact? That he goes off after a long day to see
an old hag in the hills?"</p>

<p>"It would seem unlikely," said I.</p>

<p>"Unlikely! Well, yes, unlikely."</p>

<p>Hugh got up from his chair and crossed the room to where a
bookcase of rather fusty-looking volumes stood between windows. He
took a small morocco--backed book from a top shelf.</p>

<p>"Superstitions of Sutherlandshire," he said, as he handed it to
me. "Turn to page 128, and read."</p>

<p>"September 15 appears to have been the date of what we may call
this devil festival. On the night of that day the powers of darkness
held pre-eminent dominion, and over-rode for any who were abroad that
night and invoked their aid, the protective Providence of Almighty
God.</p>

<p>"Witches, therefore, above all, were peculiarly potent. On this
night any witch could entice to herself the heart and the love of any
young man who consulted her on matters of philtre or love charm, with
the result that on any night in succeeding years of the same date,
he, though he was lawfully affianced and wedded, would for that night
be hers. If, however, he should call on the name of God through any
sudden grace of the Spirit, her charm would be of no avail. On this
night, too, all witches had the power by certain dreadful
incantations and indescribable profanities, to raise from the dead
those who had committed suicide."</p>

<p>"Top of the next page," said Hugh. "Leave out this next paragraph;
it does not bear on this last."</p>

<p>"Near a small village in this country," I read, "called Gavon, the
moon at midnight is said to shine through a certain gap or fissure in
a wall of rock close beside the river on to the ruins of a Pict
castle, so that the light of its beams falls on to a large flat stone
erected there near the gate, and supposed by some to be an ancient
and pagan altar. At that moment, so the superstition still lingers in
the countryside, the evil and malignant spirits which hold sway on
Gavon's Eve, are at the zenith of their powers, and those who invoke
their aid at this moment and in this place, will, though with
infinite peril to their immortal souls, get all that they desire of
them."</p>

<p>The paragraph on the subject ended here, and I shut the book.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Under favourable circumstances two and two make four," said
Hugh.</p>

<p>"And four means--"</p>

<p>"This. Sandy is certainly in consultation with a woman who is
supposed to be a witch, whose path no crofter will cross after
nightfall. He wants to learn, at whatever cost, poor devil, what
happened to Catrine. Thus I think it more than possible that
to-morrow, at midnight, there will be folk by the Picts' pool. There
is another curious thing. I was fishing yesterday, and just opposite
the river gate of the castle, someone has set up a great flat stone,
which has been dragged (for I noticed the crushed grass) from the
debris at the bottom of the slope."</p>

<p>"You mean that the old hag is going to try to raise the body of
Catrine, if she is dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I mean to see myself what happens. Come too."</p>

<p>The next day Hugh and I fished down the river from the lodge,
taking with us not Sandy, but another gillie, and ate our lunch on
the slope of the Picts' Castle after landing a couple of fish there.
Even as Hugh had said, a great flat slab of stone had been dragged on
to the platform outside the river gate of the castle, where it rested
on certain rude supports, which, now that it was in place, seemed
certainly designed to receive it. It was also exactly opposite that
lancet window in the basaltic rock across the pool, so that if the
moon at midnight did shine through it, the light would fall on the
stone. This, then, was the almost certain scene of the
incantations.</p>

<p>Below the platform, as I have said, the ground fell rapidly away
to the level of the pool, which owing to rain on the hills was
running very high, and, streaked with lines of greyish bubbles,
poured down in amazing and ear-filling volume. But directly
underneath the steep escarpment of rock on the far side of the pool
it lay foamless and black, a still backwater of great depth. Above
the altar-like erection again the ground rose up seven rough-hewn
steps to the gate itself, on each side of which, to the height of
about four feet, ran the circular wall of the castle. Inside again
were the remains of partition walls between the three chambers, and
it was in the one nearest to the river gate that we determined to
conceal ourselves that night. From there, should the witch and Sandy
keep tryst at the altar, any sound of movement would reach us, and
through the aperture of the gate itself we could see, concealed in
the shadow of the wall, whatever took place at the altar or down
below at the pool. The lodge, finally, was but a short ten minutes
away, if one went in the direct line, so that by starting at a
quarter to twelve that night, we could enter the Picts' Castle by the
gate away from the river, thus not betraying our presence to those
who might be waiting for the moment when the moon should shine
through the lancet window in the wall of rock on to the altar in
front of the river gate.</p>

<p>Night fell very still and windless, and when not long before
midnight we let ourselves silently out of the lodge, though to the
east the sky was clear, a black continent of cloud was creeping up
from the west, and had now nearly reached the zenith. Out of the
remote fringes of it occasional lightning winked, and the growl of
very distant thunder sounded drowsily at long intervals after.</p>

<p>But it seemed to me as if another storm hung over our heads, ready
every moment to burst, for the oppression in the air was of a far
heavier quality than so distant a disturbance could have accounted
for.</p>

<p>To the east, however, the sky was still luminously clear; the
curiously hard edges of the western cloud were star-embroidered, and
by the dove-coloured light in the east it was evident that the
moonrise over the moor was imminent. And though I did not in my heart
believe that our expedition would end in anything but yawns, I was
conscious of an extreme tension and rawness of nerves, which I set
down to the thunder-charged air.</p>

<p>For noiselessness of footstep we had both put on
india-rubber-soled shoes, and all the way down to the pool we heard
nothing but the distant thunder and our own padded tread. Very
silently and cautiously we ascended the steps of the gate away from
the river, and keeping close to the wall inside, sidled round to the
river gate and peered out. For the first moment I could see nothing,
so black lay the shadow of the rock-wall opposite across the pool,
but by degrees I made out the lumps and line of the glimmering foam
which streaked the water. High as the river was running this morning
it was infinitely more voluminous and turbulent now, and the sound of
it filled and bewildered the ear with its sonorous roaring. Only
under the very base of the rock opposite it ran quite black and
unflecked by foam: there lay the deep still surface of the backwater.
Then suddenly I saw something black move in the dimness in front of
me, and against the grey foam rose up first the head, then the
shoulders, and finally the whole figure of a woman coming towards us
up the bank. Behind her walked another, a man, and the two came to
where the altar of stone had been newly erected and stood there side
by side silhouetted against the churned white of the stream. Hugh had
seen too, and touched me on the arm to call my attention. So far then
he was right: there was no mistaking the stalwart proportions of
Sandy.</p>

<p>Suddenly across the gloom shot a tiny spear of light, and
momentarily as we watched, it grew larger and longer, till a tall
beam, as from some window cut in the rock opposite, was shed on the
bank below us. It moved slowly, imperceptibly to the left till it
struck full between the two black figures standing there, and shone
with a curious bluish gleam on the flat stone in front of them.</p>

<p>Then the roar of the river was suddenly overscored by a dreadful
screaming voice, the voice of a woman, and from her side her arms
shot up and out as if in invocation of some power.</p>

<p>At first I could catch none of the words, but soon from repetition
they began to convey an intelligible message to my brain, and I was
listening as in paralytic horror of nightmare to a bellowing of the
most hideous and un-nameable profanity. What I heard I cannot bring
myself to record; suffice it to say that Satan was invoked by every
adoring and reverent name, that cursing and unspeakable malediction
was poured forth on Him whom we hold most holy. Then the yelling
voice ceased as suddenly as it had began, and for a moment there was
silence again, but for the reverberating river.</p>

<p>Then once more that horror of sound was uplifted.</p>

<p>"So, Catrine Gordon," it cried, "I bid ye in the name of my master
and yours to rise from where ye lie. Up with ye--up!"</p>

<p>Once more there was silence; then I heard Hugh at my elbow draw a
quick sobbing breath, and his finger pointed unsteadily to the dead
black water below the rock. And I too looked and saw.</p>

<p>Right under the rock there appeared a pale subaqueous light, which
waved and quivered in the stream. At first it was very small and dim,
but as we looked it seemed to swim upwards from remote depths and
grew larger till I suppose the space of some square yard was
illuminated by it.</p>

<p>Then the surface of the water was broken, and a head, the head of
a girl, dead-white and with long, flowing hair, appeared above the
stream. Her eyes were shut, the corners of her mouth drooped as in
sleep, and the moving water stood in a frill round her neck. Higher
and higher rose the figure out of the tide, till at last it stood,
luminous in itself, so it appeared, up to the middle.</p>

<p>The head was bent down over the breast, and the hands clasped
together. As it emerged from the water it seemed to get nearer, and
was by now half-way across the pool, moving quietly and steadily
against the great flood of the hurrying river.</p>

<p>Then I heard a man's voice crying out in a sort of strangled
agony.</p>

<p>"Catrine!" it cried; "Catrine! In God's name; in God's name!"</p>

<p>In two strides Sandy had rushed down the steep bank, and hurled
himself out into that mad swirl of waters. For one moment I saw his
arms flung up into the sky, the next he had altogether gone. And on
the utterance of that name the unholy vision had vanished too, while
simultaneously there burst in front of us a light so blinding,
followed by a crack of thunder so appalling to the senses, that I
know I just hid my face in my hands. At once, as if the flood-gates
of the sky had been opened, the deluge was on us, not like rain, but
like one sheet of solid water, so that we cowered under it. Any hope
or attempt to rescue Sandy was out of the question; to dive into that
whirlpool of mad water meant instant death, and even had it been
possible for any swimmer to live there, in the blackness of the night
there was absolutely no chance of finding him. Besides, even if it
had been possible to save him, I doubt whether I was sufficiently
master of my flesh and blood as to endure to plunge where that
apparition had risen.</p>

<p>Then, as we lay there, another horror filled and possessed my
mind. Somewhere close to us in the darkness was that woman whose
yelling voice just now had made my blood run ice-cold, while it
brought the streaming sweat to my forehead. At that moment I turned
to Hugh.</p>

<p>"I cannot stop here," I said. "I must run, run right away. Where
is she?"</p>

<p>"Did you not see?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. What happened?"</p>

<p>"The lightning struck the stone within a few inches of where she
was standing. We--we must go and look for her."</p>

<p>I followed him down the slope, shaking as if I had the palsy, and
groping with my hands on the ground in front of me, in deadly terror
of encountering something human. The thunderclouds had in the last
few minutes spread over the moon, so that no ray from the window in
the rock guided our search. But up and down the bank from the stone
that lay shattered there to the edge of the pool we groped and
stumbled, but found nothing. At length we gave it up: it seemed
morally certain that she, too, had rolled down the bank after the
lightning stroke, and lay somewhere deep in the pool from which she
had called the dead.</p>

<p>None fished the pool next day, but men with drag-nets came from
Brora. Right under the rock in the backwater lay two bodies, close
together, Sandy and the dead girl. Of the other they found
nothing.</p>

<p>It would seem, then, that Catrine Gordon, in answer to Sandy's
letter, left Inverness in heavy trouble. What happened afterwards can
only be conjectured, but it seems likely she took the short cut to
Gavon, meaning to cross the river on the boulders above the Picts'
pool. But whether she slipped accidentally in her passage, and so was
drawn down by the hungry water, or whether unable to face the future,
she had thrown herself into the pool, we can only guess. In any case
they sleep together now in the bleak, wind-swept graveyard at Brora,
in obedience to the inscrutable designs of God.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15"></a>The Horror-Horn</h2>

<p>For the past ten days Alhubel had basked in the radiant midwinter
weather proper to its eminence of over 6,000 feet. From rising to
setting the sun (so surprising to those who have hitherto associated
it with a pale, tepid plate indistinctly shining through the murky
air of England) had blazed its way across the sparkling blue, and
every night the serene and windless frost had made the stars sparkle
like illuminated diamond dust. Sufficient snow had fallen before
Christmas to content the skiers, and the big rink, sprinkled every
evening, had given the skaters each morning a fresh surface on which
to perform their slippery antics. Bridge and dancing served to while
away the greater part of the night, and to me, now for the first time
tasting the joys of a winter in the Engadine, it seemed that a new
heaven and a new earth had been lighted, warmed, and refrigerated for
the special benefit of those who like myself had been wise enough to
save up their days of holiday for the winter.</p>

<p>But a break came in these ideal conditions: one afternoon the sun
grew vapour-veiled and up the valley from the north-west a wind
frozen with miles of travel over ice-bound hill-sides began scouting
through the calm halls of the heavens. Soon it grew dusted with snow,
first in small flakes driven almost horizontally before its
congealing breath and then in larger tufts as of swansdown. And
though all day for a fortnight before the fate of nations and life
and death had seemed to me of far less importance than to get certain
tracings of the skate-blades on the ice of proper shape and size, it
now seemed that the one paramount consideration was to hurry back to
the hotel for shelter: it was wiser to leave rocking-turns alone than
to be frozen in their quest.</p>

<p>I had come out here with my cousin, Professor Ingram, the
celebrated physiologist and Alpine climber. During the serenity of
the last fortnight he had made a couple of notable winter ascents,
but this morning his weather-wisdom had mistrusted the signs of the
heavens, and instead of attempting the ascent of the Piz Passug he
had waited to see whether his misgivings justified themselves. So
there he sat now in the hall of the admirable hotel with his feet on
the hot-water pipes and the latest delivery of the English post in
his hands. This contained a pamphlet concerning the result of the
Mount Everest expedition, of which he had just finished the perusal
when I entered.</p>

<p>"A very interesting report," he said, passing it to me, "and they
certainly deserve to succeed next year. But who can tell, what that
final six thousand feet may entail? Six thousand feet more when you
have already accomplished twenty-three thousand does not seem much,
but at present no one knows whether the human frame can stand
exertion at such a height. It may affect not the lungs and heart
only, but possibly the brain. Delirious hallucinations may occur. In
fact, if I did not know better, I should have said that one such
hallucination had occurred to the climbers already."</p>

<p>"And what was that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You will find that they thought they came across the tracks of
some naked human foot at a great altitude. That looks at first sight
like an hallucination. What more natural than that a brain excited
and exhilarated by the extreme height should have interpreted certain
marks in the snow as the footprints of a human being? Every bodily
organ at these altitudes is exerting itself to the utmost to do its
work, and the brain seizes on those marks in the snow and says 'Yes,
I'm all right, I'm doing my job, and I perceive marks in the snow
which I affirm are human footprints.' You know, even at this
altitude, how restless and eager the brain is, how vividly, as you
told me, you dream at night. Multiply that stimulus and that
consequent eagerness and restlessness by three, and how natural that
the brain should harbour illusions! What after all is the delirium
which often accompanies high fever but the effort of the brain to do
its work under the pressure of feverish conditions? It is so eager to
continue perceiving that it perceives things which have no
existence!"</p>

<p>"And yet you don't think that these naked human footprints were
illusions," said I. "You told me you would have thought so, if you
had not known better."</p>

<p>He shifted in his chair and looked out of the window a moment. The
air was thick now with the density of the big snow-flakes that were
driven along by the squealing north-west gale.</p>

<p>"Quite so," he said. "In all probability the human footprints were
real human footprints. I expect that they were the footprints,
anyhow, of a being more nearly a man than anything else.</p>

<p>"My reason for saying so is that I know such beings exist. I have
even seen quite near at hand--and I assure you I did not wish to be
nearer in spite of my intense curiosity--the creature, shall we say,
which would make such footprints. And if the snow was not so dense, I
could show you the place where I saw him."</p>

<p>He pointed straight out of the window, where across the valley
lies the huge tower of the Ungeheuerhorn with the carved pinnacle of
rock at the top like some gigantic rhinoceros-horn.</p>

<p>On one side only, as I knew, was the mountain practicable, and
that for none but the finest climbers; on the other three a
succession of ledges and precipices rendered it unscalable. Two
thousand feet of sheer rock form the tower; below are five hundred
feet of fallen boulders, up to the edge of which grow dense woods of
larch and pine.</p>

<p>"Upon the Ungeheuerhorn?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Up till twenty years ago it had never been ascended, and I,
like several others, spent a lot of time in trying to find a route up
it. My guide and I sometimes spent three nights together at the hut
beside the Blumen glacier, prowling round it, and it was by luck
really that we found the route, for the mountain looks even more
impracticable from the far side than it does from this.</p>

<p>"But one day we found a long, transverse fissure in the side which
led to a negotiable ledge; then there came a slanting ice couloir
which you could not see till you got to the foot of it. However, I
need not go into that."</p>

<p>The big room where we sat was filling up with cheerful groups
driven indoors by this sudden gale and snowfall, and the cackle of
merry tongues grew loud. The band, too, that invariable appanage of
tea-time at Swiss resorts, had begun to tune up for the usual
potpourri from the works of Puccini. Next moment the sugary,
sentimental melodies began.</p>

<p>"Strange contrast!" said Ingram. "Here are we sitting warm and
cosy, our ears pleasantly tickled with these little baby tunes and
outside is the great storm growing more violent every moment, and
swirling round the austere cliffs of the Ungeheuerhorn: the
Horror-Horn, as indeed it was to me."</p>

<p>"I want to hear all about it," I said. "Every detail: make a short
story long, if it's short. I want to know why it's your
Horror-Horn?"</p>

<p>"Well, Chanton and I (he was my guide) used to spend days prowling
about the cliffs, making a little progress on one side and then being
stopped, and gaining perhaps five hundred feet on another side and
then being confronted by some insuperable obstacle, till the day when
by luck we found the route. Chanton never liked the job, for some
reason that I could not fathom.</p>

<p>"It was not because of the difficulty or danger of the climbing,
for he was the most fearless man I have ever met when dealing with
rocks and ice, but he was always insistent that we should get off the
mountain and back to the Blumen hut before sunset. He was scarcely
easy even when we had got back to shelter and locked and barred the
door, and I well remember one night when, as we ate our supper, we
heard some animal, a wolf probably, howling somewhere out in the
night.</p>

<p>"A positive panic seized him, and I don't think he closed his eyes
till morning. It struck me then that there might be some grisly
legend about the mountain, connected possibly with its name, and next
day I asked him why the peak was called the Horror-Horn. He put the
question off at first, and said that, like the Schreckhorn, its name
was due to its precipices and falling stones; but when I pressed him
further he acknowledged that there was a legend about it, which his
father had told him. There were creatures, so it was supposed, that
lived in its caves, things human in shape, and covered, except for
the face and hands, with long black hair. They were dwarfs in size,
four feet high or thereabouts, but of prodigious strength and
agility, remnants of some wild primeval race. It seemed that they
were still in an upward stage of evolution, or so I guessed, for the
story ran that sometimes girls had been carried off by them, not as
prey, and not for any such fate as for those captured by cannibals,
but to be bred from. Young men also had been raped by them, to be
mated with the females of their tribe. All this looked as if the
creatures, as I said, were tending towards humanity. But naturally I
did not believe a word of it, as applied to the conditions of the
present day. Centuries ago, conceivably, there may have been such
beings, and, with the extraordinary tenacity of tradition, the news
of this had been handed down and was still current round the hearths
of the peasants. As for their numbers, Chanton told me that three had
been once seen together by a man who owing to his swiftness on skis
had escaped to tell the tale.</p>

<p>"This man, he averred, was no other than his grand-father, who had
been benighted one winter evening as he passed through the dense
woods below the Ungeheuerhorn, and Chanton supposed that they had
been driven down to these lower altitudes in search of food during
severe winter weather, for otherwise the recorded sights of them had
always taken place among the rocks of the peak itself. They had
pursued his grandfather, then a young man, at an extraordinarily
swift canter, running sometimes upright as men run, sometimes on
all-fours in the manner of beasts, and their howls were just such as
that we had heard that night in the Blumen hut. Such at any rate was
the story Chanton told me, and, like you, I regarded it as the very
moonshine of superstition.</p>

<p>"But the very next day I had reason to reconsider my judgment
about it.</p>

<p>"It was on that day that after a week of exploration we hit on the
only route at present known to the top of our peak. We started as
soon as there was light enough to climb by, for, as you may guess, on
very difficult rocks it is impossible to climb by lantern or
moonlight. We hit on the long fissure I have spoken of, we explored
the ledge which from below seemed to end in nothingness, and with an
hour's stepcutting ascended the couloir which led upwards from
it.</p>

<p>"From there onwards it was a rock-climb, certainly of considerable
difficulty, but with no heart-breaking discoveries ahead, and it was
about nine in the morning that we stood on the top. We did not wait
there long, for that side of the mountain is raked by falling stones
loosened, when the sun grows hot, from the ice that holds them, and
we made haste to pass the ledge where the falls are most frequent.
After that there was the long fissure to descend, a matter of no
great difficulty, and we were at the end of our work by midday, both
of us, as you may imagine, in the state of the highest elation.</p>

<p>"A long and tiresome scramble among the huge boulders at the foot
of the cliff then lay before us. Here the hill-side is very porous
and great caves extend far into the mountain. We had unroped at the
base of the fissure, and were picking our way as seemed good to
either of us among these fallen rocks, many of them bigger than an
ordinary house, when, on coming round the corner of one of these, I
saw that which made it clear that the stories Chanton had told me
were no figment of traditional superstition.</p>

<p>"Not twenty yards in front of me lay one of the beings of which he
had spoken. There it sprawled naked and basking on its back with face
turned up to the sun, which its narrow eyes regarded unwinking. In
form it was completely human, but the growth of hair that covered
limbs and trunk alike almost completely hid the sun-tanned skin
beneath. But its face, save for the down on its cheeks and chin, was
hairless, and I looked on a countenance the sensual and malevolent
bestiality of which froze me with horror. Had the creature been an
animal, one would have felt scarcely a shudder at the gross animalism
of it; the horror lay in the fact that it was a man. There lay by it
a couple of gnawed bones, and, its meal finished, it was lazily
licking its protuberant lips, from which came a purring murmur of
content. With one hand it scratched the thick hair on its belly, in
the other it held one of these bones, which presently split in half
beneath the pressure of its finger and thumb. But my horror was not
based on the information of what happened to those men whom these
creatures caught, it was due only to my proximity to a thing so human
and so infernal. The peak, of which the ascent had a moment ago
filled us with such elated satisfaction, became to me an
Ungeheuerhorn indeed, for it was the home of beings more awful than
the delirium of nightmare could ever have conceived.</p>

<p>"Chanton was a dozen paces behind me, and with a backward wave of
my hand I caused him to halt. Then withdrawing myself with infinite
precaution, so as not to attract the gaze of that basking creature, I
slipped back round the rock, whispered to him what I had seen, and
with blanched faces we made a long detour, peering round every
corner, and crouching low, not knowing that at any step we might not
come upon another of these beings, or that from the mouth of one of
these caves in the mountain-side there might not appear another of
those hairless and dreadful faces, with perhaps this time the breasts
and insignia of womanhood. That would have been the worst of
all.</p>

<p>"Luck favoured us, for we made our way among the boulders and
shifting stones, the rattle of which might at any moment have
betrayed us, without a repetition of my experience, and once among
the trees we ran as if the Furies themselves were in pursuit. Well
now did I understand, though I dare say I cannot convey, the qualms
of Chanton's mind when he spoke to me of these creatures. Their very
humanity was what made them so terrible, the fact that they were of
the same race as ourselves, but of a type so abysmally degraded that
the most brutal and inhuman of men would have seemed angelic in
comparison."</p>

<p>The music of the small band was over before he had finished the
narrative, and the chattering groups round the tea-table had
dispersed. He paused a moment.</p>

<p>"There was a horror of the spirit," he said, "which I experienced
then, from which, I verily believe, I have never entirely recovered.
I saw then how terrible a living thing could be, and how terrible, in
consequence, was life itself. In us all I suppose lurks some
inherited germ of that ineffable bestiality, and who knows whether,
sterile as it has apparently become in the course of centuries, it
might not fructify again. When I saw that creature sun itself, I
looked into the abyss out of which we have crawled. And these
creatures are trying to crawl out of it now, if they exist any
longer. Certainly for the last twenty years there has been no record
of their being seen, until we come to this story of the footprint
seen by the climbers on Everest. If that is authentic, if the party
did not mistake the footprint of some bear, or what not, for a human
tread, it seems as if still this bestranded remnant of mankind is in
existence."</p>

<p>Now, Ingram, had told his story well; but sitting in this warm and
civilised room, the horror which he had clearly felt had not
communicated itself to me in any very vivid manner.</p>

<p>Intellectually, I agreed, I could appreciate his horror, but
certainly my spirit felt no shudder of interior comprehension.</p>

<p>"But it is odd," I said, "that your keen interest in physiology
did not disperse your qualms.</p>

<p>"You were looking, so I take it, at some form of man more remote
probably than the earliest human remains. Did not something inside
you say 'This is of absorbing significance'?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"No: I only wanted to get away," said he. "It was not, as I have
told you, the terror of what according to Chanton's story,
might--await us if we were captured; it was sheer horror at the
creature itself. I quaked at it."</p>

<p>The snowstorm and the gale increased in violence that night, and I
slept uneasily, plucked again and again from slumber by the fierce
battling of the wind that shook my windows as if with an imperious
demand for admittance. It came in billowy gusts, with strange noises
intermingled with it as for a moment it abated, with flutings and
moanings that rose to shrieks as the fury of it returned. These
noises, no doubt, mingled themselves with my drowsed and sleepy
consciousness, and once I tore myself out of nightmare, imagining
that the creatures of the Horror-Horn had gained footing on my
balcony and were rattling at the window-bolts. But before morning the
gale had died away, and I awoke to see the snow falling dense and
fast in a windless air. For three days it continued, without
intermission, and with its cessation there came a frost such as I
have never felt before. Fifty degrees were registered one night, and
more the next, and what the cold must have been on the cliffs of the
Ungeheuerborn I cannot imagine. Sufficient, so I thought, to have
made an end altogether of its secret inhabitants: my cousin, on that
day twenty years ago, had missed an opportunity for study which would
probably never fall again either to him or another.</p>

<p>I received one morning a letter from a friend saying that he had
arrived at the neighbouring winter resort of St. Luigi, and proposing
that I should come over for a morning's skating and lunch afterwards.
The place was not more than a couple of miles off, if one took the
path over the low, pine-clad foot-hills above which lay the steep
woods below the first rocky slopes of the Ungeheuerhorn; and
accordingly, with a knapsack containing skates on my back, I went on
skis over the wooded slopes and down by an easy descent again on to
St. Luigi. The day was overcast, clouds entirely obscured the higher
peaks though the sun was visible, pale and unluminous, through the
mists. But as the morning went on, it gained the upper hand, and I
slid down into St. Luigi beneath a sparkling firmament. We skated and
lunched, and then, since it looked as if thick weather was coming up
again, I set out early about three o'clock for my return journey.</p>

<p>Hardly had I got into the woods when the clouds gathered thick
above, and streamers and skeins of them began to descend among the
pines through which my path threaded its way. In ten minutes more
their opacity had so increased that I could hardly see a couple of
yards in front of me. Very soon I became aware that I must have got
off the path, for snow-cowled shrubs lay directly in my way, and,
casting back to find it again, I got altogether confused as to
direction.</p>

<p>But, though progress was difficult, I knew I had only to keep on
the ascent, and presently I should come to the brow of these low
foot-hills, and descend into the open valley where Alhubel stood. So
on I went, stumbling and sliding over obstacles, and unable, owing to
the thickness of the snow, to take off my skis, for I should have
sunk over the knees at each step. Still the ascent continued, and
looking at my watch I saw that I had already been near an hour on my
way from St. Luigi, a period more than sufficient to complete my
whole journey. But still I stuck to my idea that though I had
certainly strayed far from my proper route a few minutes more must
surely see me over the top of the upward way, and I should find the
ground declining into the next valley. About now, too, I noticed that
the mists were growing suffused with rose-colour, and, though the
inference was that it must be close on sunset, there was consolation
in the fact that they were there and might lift at any moment and
disclose to me my whereabouts. But the fact that night would soon be
on me made it needful to bar my mind against that despair of
loneliness which so eats out the heart of a man who is lost in woods
or on mountain-side, that, though still there is plenty of vigour in
his limbs, his nervous force is sapped, and he can do no more than
lie down and abandon himself to whatever fate may await him...And
then I heard that which made the thought of loneliness seem bliss
indeed, for there was a worse fate than loneliness. What I heard
resembled the howl of a wolf, and it came from not far in front of me
where the ridge--was it a ridge?--still rose higher in vestment of
pines.</p>

<p>From behind me came a sudden puff of wind, which shook the frozen
snow from the drooping pine-branches, and swept away the mists as a
broom sweeps the dust from the floor.</p>

<p>Radiant above me were the unclouded skies, already charged with
the red of the sunset, and in front I saw that I had come to the very
edge of the wood through which I had wandered so long.</p>

<p>But it was no valley into which I had penetrated, for there right
ahead of me rose the steep slope of boulders and rocks soaring
upwards to the foot of the Ungeheuerhorn. What, then, was that cry of
a wolf which had made my heart stand still? I saw.</p>

<p>Not twenty yards from me was a fallen tree, and leaning against
the trunk of it was one of the denizens of the Horror-Horn, and it
was a woman. She was enveloped in a thick growth of hair grey and
tufted, and from her head it streamed down over her shoulders and her
bosom, from which hung withered and pendulous breasts. And looking on
her face I comprehended not with my mind alone, but with a shudder of
my spirit, what Ingram had felt. Never had nightmare fashioned so
terrible a countenance; the beauty of sun and stars and of the beasts
of the field and the kindly race of men could not atone for so
hellish an incarnation of the spirit of life. A fathomless bestiality
modelled the slavering mouth and the narrow eyes; I looked into the
abyss itself and knew that out of that abyss on the edge of which I
leaned the generations of men had climbed. What if that ledge
crumbled in front of me and pitched me headlong into its nethermost
depths?...</p>

<p>In one hand she held by the horns a chamois that kicked and
struggled. A blow from its hindleg caught her withered thigh, and
with a grunt of anger she seized the leg in her other hand, and, as a
man may pull from its sheath a stem of meadow-grass, she plucked it
off the body, leaving the torn skin hanging round the gaping wound.
Then putting the red, bleeding member to her mouth she sucked at it
as a child sucks a stick of sweetmeat. Through flesh and gristle her
short, brown teeth penetrated, and she licked her lips with a sound
of purring. Then dropping the leg by her side, she looked again at
the body of the prey now quivering in its death-convulsion, and with
finger and thumb gouged out one of its eyes. She snapped her teeth on
it, and it cracked like a soft-shelled nut.</p>

<p>It must have been but a few seconds that I stood watching her, in
some indescribable catalepsy of terror, while through my brain there
pealed the panic-command of my mind to my stricken limbs "Begone,
begone, while there is time." Then, recovering the power of my joints
and muscles, I tried to slip behind a tree and hide myself from this
apparition. But the woman--shall I say?--must have caught my stir of
movement, for she raised her eyes from her living feast and saw me.
She craned forward her neck, she dropped her prey, and half rising
began to move towards me. As she did this, she opened her mouth, and
gave forth a howl such as I had heard a moment before. It was
answered by another, but faintly and distantly.</p>

<p>Sliding and slipping, with the toes of my skis tripping in the
obstacles below the snow, I plunged forward down the hill between the
pine-trunks. The low sun already sinking behind some rampart of
mountain in the west reddened the snow and the pines with its
ultimate rays. My knapsack with the skates in it swung to and fro on
my back, one ski-stick had already been twitched out of my hand by a
fallen branch of pine, but not a second's pause could I allow myself
to recover it. I gave no glance behind, and I knew not at what pace
my pursuer was on my track, or indeed whether any pursued at all, for
my whole mind and energy, now working at full power again under the
stress of my panic, was devoted to getting away down the hill and out
of the wood as swiftly as my limbs could bear me. For a little while
I heard nothing but the hissing snow of my headlong passage, and the
rustle of the covered undergrowth beneath my feet, and then, from
close at hand behind me, once more the wolf-howl sounded and I heard
the plunging of footsteps other than my own.</p>

<p>The strap of my knapsack had shifted, and as my skates swung to
and fro on my back it chafed and pressed on my throat, hindering free
passage of air, of which, God knew, my labouring lungs were in dire
need, and without pausing I slipped it free from my neck, and held it
in the hand from which my ski-stick had been jerked. I seemed to go a
little more easily for this adjustment, and now, not so far distant,
I could see below me the path from which I had strayed.</p>

<p>If only I could reach that, the smoother going would surely enable
me to outdistance my pursuer, who even on the rougher ground was but
slowly overhauling me, and at the sight of that riband stretching
unimpeded downhill, a ray of hope pierced the black panic of my soul.
With that came the desire, keen and insistent, to see who or what it
was that was on my tracks, and I spared a backward glance. It was
she, the hag whom I had seen at her gruesome meal; her long grey hair
flew out behind her, her mouth chattered and gibbered, her fingers
made grabbing movements, as if already they closed on me.</p>

<p>But the path was now at hand, and the nearness of it I suppose
made me incautious. A hump of snow-covered bush lay in my path, and,
thinking I could jump over it, I tripped and fell, smothering myself
in snow. I heard a maniac noise, half scream, half laugh, from close
behind, and before I could recover myself the grabbing fingers were
at my neck, as if a steel vice had closed there. But my right hand in
which I held my knapsack of skates was free, and with a blind
back-handed movement I whirled it behind me at the full length of its
strap, and knew that my desperate blow had found its billet
somewhere. Even before I could look round I felt the grip on my neck
relax, and something subsided into the very bush which had entangled
me. I recovered my feet and turned.</p>

<p>There she lay, twitching and quivering. The heel of one of my
skates piercing the thin alpaca of the knapsack had hit her full on
the temple, from which the blood was pouring, but a hundred yards
away I could see another such figure coming downwards on my tracks,
leaping and bounding. At that panic rose again within me, and I sped
off down the white smooth path that led to the lights of the village
already beckoning. Never once did I pause in my headlong going: there
was no safety until I was back among the haunts of men. I flung
myself against the door of the hotel, and screamed for admittance,
though I had but to turn the handle and enter; and once more as when
Ingram had told his tale, there was the sound of the band, and the
chatter of voices, and there, too, was he himself, who looked up and
then rose swiftly to his feet as I made my clattering entrance.</p>

<p>"I have seen them too," I cried. "Look at my knapsack. Is there
not blood on it? It is the blood of one of them, a woman, a hag, who
tore off the leg of a chamois as I looked, and pursued me through the
accursed wood. I--".Whether it was I who spun round, or the room
which seemed to spin round me, I knew not, but I heard myself
falling, collapsed on the floor, and the next time that I was
conscious at all I was in bed. There was Ingram there, who told me
that I was quite safe, and another man, a stranger, who pricked my
arm with the nozzle of a syringe, and reassured me...</p>

<p>A day or two later I gave a coherent account of my adventure, and
three or four men, armed with guns, went over my traces. They found
the bush in which I had stumbled, with a pool of blood which had
soaked into the snow, and, still following my ski-tracks, they came
on the body of a chamois, from which had been torn one of its
hindlegs and one eye-socket was empty. That is all the corroboration
of my story that I can give the reader, and for myself I imagine that
the creature which pursued me was either not killed by my blow or
that her fellows removed her body...Anyhow, it is open to the
incredulous to prowl about the caves of the Ungeheuerhorn, and see if
anything occurs that may convince them.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16"></a>In the Tube</h2>

<p>"It's a convention," said Anthony Carling cheerfully, "and not a
very convincing one. Time, indeed! There's no such thing as Time
really; it has no actual existence. Time is nothing more than an
infinitesimal point in eternity, just as space is an infinitesimal
point in infinity. At the most, Time is a sort of tunnel through
which we are accustomed to believe that we are travelling.</p>

<p>"There's a roar in our ears and a darkness in our eyes which makes
it seem real to us. But before we came into the tunnel we existed for
ever in an infinite sunlight, and after we have got through it we
shall exist in an infinite sunlight again. So why should we bother
ourselves about the confusion and noise and darkness which only
encompass us for a moment?"</p>

<p>For a firm-rooted believer in such immeasurable ideas as these,
which he punctuated with brisk application of the poker to the brave
sparkle and glow of the fire, Anthony has a very pleasant
appreciation of the measurable and the finite, and nobody with whom I
have acquaintance has so keen a zest for life and its enjoyments as
he. He had given us this evening an admirable dinner, had passed
round a port beyond praise, and had illuminated the jolly hours with
the light of his infectious optimism. Now the small company had
melted away, and I was left with him over the fire in his study.
Outside the tattoo of wind-driven sleet was audible on the
window-panes, over-scoring now and again the flap of the flames on
the open hearth, and the thought of the chilly blasts and the
snow-covered pavement in Brompton Square, across which, to skidding
taxicabs, the last of his other guests had scurried, made my
position, resident here till to-morrow morning, the more delicately
delightful. Above all there was this stimulating and suggestive
companion, who, whether he talked of the great abstractions which
were so intensely real and practical to him, or of the very
remarkable experiences which he had encountered among these
conventions of time and space, was equally fascinating to the
listener.</p>

<p>"I adore life," he said. "I find it the most entrancing plaything.
It's a delightful game, and, as you know very well, the only
conceivable way to play a game is to treat it extremely seriously. If
you say to yourself, 'It's only a game,' you cease to take the
slightest interest in it. You have to know that it's only a game, and
behave as if it was the one object of existence. I should like it to
go on for many years yet. But all the time one has to be living on
the true plane as well, which is eternity and infinity. If you come
to think of it, the one thing which the human mind cannot grasp is
the finite, not the infinite, the temporary, not the eternal."</p>

<p>"That sounds rather paradoxical," said I.</p>

<p>"Only because you've made a habit of thinking about things that
seem bounded and limited.</p>

<p>"Look it in the face for a minute. Try to imagine finite Time and
Space, and you find you can't.</p>

<p>"Go back a million years, and multiply that million of years by
another million, and you find that you can't conceive of a beginning.
What happened before that beginning? Another beginning and another
beginning? And before that? Look at it like that, and you find that
the only solution comprehensible to you is the existence of an
eternity, something that never began and will never end. It's the
same about space. Project yourself to the farthest star, and what
comes beyond that?</p>

<p>"Emptiness? Go on through the emptiness, and you can't imagine it
being finite and having an end. It must needs go on for ever: that's
the only thing you can understand. There's no such thing as before or
after, or beginning or end, and what a comfort that is! I should
fidget myself to death if there wasn't the huge soft cushion of
eternity to lean one's head against. Some people say--I believe I've
heard you say it yourself--that the idea of eternity is so tiring;
you feel that you want to stop. But that's because you are thinking
of eternity in terms of Time, and mumbling in your brain, 'And after
that, and after that?' Don't you grasp the idea that in eternity
there isn't any 'after,' any more than there is any 'before'? It's
all one. Eternity isn't a quantity: it's a quality."</p>

<p>Sometimes, when Anthony talks in this manner, I seem to get a
glimpse of that which to his mind is so transparently clear and
solidly real, at other times (not having a brain that readily
envisages abstractions) I feel as though he was pushing me over a
precipice, and my intellectual faculties grasp wildly at anything
tangible or comprehensible. This was the case now, and I hastily
interrupted.</p>

<p>"But there is a 'before' and 'after,'" I said. "A few hours ago
you gave us an admirable dinner, and after that--yes, after--we
played bridge. And now you are going to explain things a little more
clearly to me, and after that I shall go to bed--"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"You shall do exactly as you like," he said, "and you shan't be a
slave to Time either to-night or to-morrow morning. We won't even
mention an hour for breakfast, but you shall have it in eternity
whenever you awake. And as I see it is not midnight yet, we'll slip
the bonds of Time, and talk quite infinitely. I will stop the clock,
if that will assist you in getting rid of your illusion, and then
I'll tell you a story, which to my mind, shows how unreal so-called
realities are; or, at any rate, how fallacious are our senses as
judges of what is real and what is not."</p>

<p>"Something occult, something spookish?" I asked, pricking up my
ears, for Anthony has the strangest clairvoyances and visions of
things unseen by the normal eye.</p>

<p>"I suppose you might call some of it occult," he said, "though
there's a certain amount of rather grim reality mixed up in it."</p>

<p>"Go on; excellent mixture," said I.</p>

<p>He threw a fresh log on the fire.</p>

<p>"It's a longish story," he said. "You may stop me as soon as you
ye had enough. But there will come a point for which I claim your
consideration. You, who cling to your 'before' and 'after,' has it
ever occurred to you how difficult it is to say when an incident
takes place? Say that a man commits some crime of violence, can we
not, with a good deal of truth, say that he really commits that crime
when he definitely plans and determines upon it, dwelling on it with
gusto? The actual commission of it, I think we can reasonably argue,
is the mere material sequel of his resolve: he is guilty of it when
he makes that determination. When, therefore, in the term of 'before'
and 'after,' does the crime truly take place? There is also in my
story a further point for your consideration. For it seems certain
that the spirit of a man, after the death of his body, is obliged to
re-enact such a crime, with a view, I suppose we may guess, to his
remorse and his eventual redemption. Those who have second sight have
seen such re-enactments. Perhaps he may have done his deed blindly in
this life; but then his spirit re-commits it with its spiritual eyes
open, and able to comprehend its enormity. So, shall we view the
man's original determination and the material commission of his crime
only as preludes to the real commission of it, when with eyes
unsealed he does it and repents of it?...That all sounds very
obscure when I speak in the abstract, but I think you will see what I
mean, if you follow my tale. Comfortable? Got everything you want?
Here goes, then."</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair, concentrating his mind, and then
spoke:</p>

<p>"The story that I am about to tell you," he said, "had its
beginning a month ago, when you were away in Switzerland. It reached
its conclusion, so I imagine, last night. I do not, at any rate
expect to experience any more of it. Well, a month ago I was
returning late on a very wet night from dining out. There was not a
taxi to be had, and I hurried through the pouring rain to the
tube-station at Piccadilly Circus, and thought myself very lucky to
catch the last train in this direction. The carriage into which I
stepped was quite empty except for one other passenger, who sat next
the door immediately opposite to me. I had never, to my knowledge,
seen him before, but I found my attention vividly fixed on him, as if
he somehow concerned me. He was a man of middle age, in
dress-clothes, and his face wore an expression of intense thought, as
if in his mind he was pondering some very significant matter, and his
hand which was resting on his knee clenched and unclenched itself.
Suddenly he looked up and stared me in the face, and I saw there
suspicion and fear, as if I had surprised him in some secret
deed.</p>

<p>"At that moment we stopped at Dover Street, and the conductor
threw open the doors, announced the station and added, 'Change here
for Hyde Park Corner and Gloucester Road.' That was all right for me
since it meant that the train would stop at Brompton Road, which was
my destination. It was all right apparently, too, for my companion,
for he certainly did not get out, and after a moment's stop, during
which no one else got in, we went on. I saw him, I must insist, after
the doors were closed and the train had started. But when I looked
again, as we rattled on, I saw that there was no one there. I was
quite alone in the carriage.</p>

<p>"Now you may think that I had had one of those swift momentary
dreams which flash in and out of the mind in the space of a second,
but I did not believe it was so myself, for I felt that I had
experienced some sort of premonition or clairvoyant vision. A man,
the semblance of whom, astral body or whatever you may choose to call
it, I had just seen, would sometime sit in that seat opposite to me,
pondering and planning."</p>

<p>"But why?" I asked. "Why should it have been the astral body of a
living man which you thought you had seen? Why not the ghost of a
dead one?"</p>

<p>"Because of my own sensations. The sight of the spirit of someone
dead, which has occurred to me two or three times in my life, has
always been accompanied by a physical shrinking and fear, and by the
sensation of cold and of loneliness. I believed, at any rate, that I
had seen a phantom of the living, and that impression was confirmed,
I might say proved, the next day. For I met the man himself. And the
next night, as you shall hear, I met the phantom again. We will take
them in order.</p>

<p>"I was lunching, then, the next day with my neighbour Mrs.
Stanley: there was a small party, and when I arrived we waited but
for the final guest. He entered while I was talking to some friend,
and presently at my elbow I heard Mrs. Stanley's voice--'Let me
introduce you to Sir Henry Payle,' she said.</p>

<p>"I turned and saw my vis-&agrave;-vis of the night before. It was
quite unmistakably he, and as we shook hands he looked at me I
thought with vague and puzzled recognition.</p>

<p>"'Haven't we met before, Mr. Carling?' he said. 'I seem to
recollect--'</p>

<p>"For the moment I forgot the strange manner of his disappearance
from the carriage, and thought that it had been the man himself whom
I had seen last night.</p>

<p>"'Surely, and not so long ago,' I said. 'For we sat opposite each
other in the last tube-train from Piccadilly Circus yesterday
night.'</p>

<p>"He still looked at me, frowning, puzzled, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"'That can hardly be,' he said. 'I only came up from the country
this morning.'</p>

<p>"Now this interested me profoundly, for the astral body, we are
told, abides in some half-conscious region of the mind or spirit, and
has recollections of what has happened to it, which it can convey
only very vaguely and dimly to the conscious mind. All lunch-time I
could see his eyes again and again directed to me with the same
puzzled and perplexed air, and as I was taking my departure he came
up to me.</p>

<p>"'I shall recollect some day,' he said, 'where we met before, and
I hope we may meet again. Was it not--?'--and he stopped. 'No: it has
gone from me,' he added."</p>

<p>The log that Anthony had thrown on the fire was burning bravely
now, and its high-flickering flame lit up his face.</p>

<p>"Now, I don't know whether you believe in coincidences as chance
things," he said, "but if you do, get rid of the notion. Or if you
can't at once, call it a coincidence that that very night I again
caught the last train on the tube going westwards. This time, so far
from my being a solitary passenger, there was a considerable crowd
waiting at Dover Street, where I entered, and just as the noise of
the approaching train began to reverberate in the tunnel I caught
sight of Sir Henry Payle standing near the opening from which the
train would presently emerge, apart from the rest of the crowd. And I
thought to myself how odd it was that I should have seen the phantom
of him at this very hour last night and the man himself now, and I
began walking towards him with the idea of saying, 'Anyhow, it is in
the tube that we meet to-night.'...And then a terrible and awful
thing happened. Just as the train emerged from the tunnel he jumped
down on to the line in front of it, and the train swept along over
him up the platform.</p>

<p>"For a moment I was stricken with horror at the sight, and I
remember covering my eyes against the dreadful tragedy. But then I
perceived that, though it had taken place in full sight of those who
were waiting, no one seemed to have seen it except myself. The
driver, looking out from his window, had not applied his brakes,
there was no jolt from the advancing train, no scream, no cry, and
the rest of the passengers began boarding the train with perfect
nonchalance.</p>

<p>"I must have staggered, for I felt sick and faint with what I had
seen, and some kindly soul put his arm round me and supported me into
the train. He was a doctor, he told me, and asked if I was in pain,
or what ailed me. I told him what I thought I had seen, and he
assured me that no such accident had taken place.</p>

<p>"It was clear then to my own mind that I had seen the second act,
so to speak, in this psychical drama, and I pondered next morning
over the problem as to what I should do. Already I had glanced at the
morning paper, which, as I knew would be the case, contained no
mention whatever of what I had seen. The thing had certainly not
happened, but I knew in myself that it would happen. The flimsy veil
of Time had been withdrawn from my eyes, and I had seen into what you
would call the future. In terms of Time of course it was the future,
but from my point of view the thing was just as much in the past as
it was in the future. It existed, and waited only for its material
fulfilment. The more I thought about it, the more I saw that I could
do nothing."</p>

<p>I interrupted his narrative.</p>

<p>"You did nothing?" I exclaimed. "Surely you might have taken some
step in order to try to avert the tragedy."</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"What step precisely?" he said. "Was I to go to Sir Henry and tell
him that once more I had seen him in the tube in the act of
committing suicide? Look at it like this. Either what I had seen was
pure illusion, pure imagination, in which case it had no existence or
significance at all, or it was actual and real, and essentially it
had happened. Or take it, though not very logically, somewhere
between the two. Say that the idea of suicide, for some cause of
which I knew nothing, had occurred to him or would occur. Should I
not, if that was the case, be doing a very dangerous thing, by making
such a suggestion to him? Might not the fact of my telling him what I
had seen put the idea into his mind, or, if it was already there,
confirm it and strengthen it? 'It's a ticklish matter to play with
souls,' as Browning says."</p>

<p>"But it seems so inhuman not to interfere in any way," said I,
"not to make any attempt."</p>

<p>"What interference?" asked he. "What attempt?"</p>

<p>The human instinct in me still seemed to cry aloud at the thought
of doing nothing to avert such a tragedy, but it seemed to be beating
itself against something austere and inexorable. And cudgel my brain
as I would, I could not combat the sense of what he had said. I had
no answer for him, and he went on.</p>

<p>"You must recollect, too," he said, "that I believed then and
believe now that the thing had happened. The cause of it, whatever
that was, had begun to work, and the effect, in this material sphere,
was inevitable. That is what I alluded to when, at the beginning of
my story, I asked you to consider how difficult it was to say when an
action took place. You still hold that this particular action, this
suicide of Sir Henry, had not yet taken place, because he had not yet
thrown himself under the advancing train. To me that seems a
materialistic view. I hold that in all but the endorsement of it, so
to speak, it had taken place. I fancy that Sir Henry, for instance,
now free from the material dusks, knows that himself."</p>

<p>Exactly as he spoke there swept through the warm lit room a
current of ice-cold air, ruffling my hair as it passed me, and making
the wood flames on the hearth to dwindle and flare. I looked round to
see if the door at my back had opened, but nothing stirred there, and
over the closed window the curtains were fully drawn. As it reached
Anthony, he sat up quickly in his chair and directed his glance this
way and that about the room.</p>

<p>"Did you feel that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes: a sudden draught," I said. "Ice-cold."</p>

<p>"Anything else?" he asked. "Any other sensation?"</p>

<p>I paused before I answered, for at the moment there occurred to me
Anthony's differentiation of the effects produced on the beholder by
a phantasm of the living and the apparition of the dead. It was the
latter which accurately described my sensations now, a certain
physical shrinking, a fear, a feeling of desolation. But yet I had
seen nothing. "I felt rather creepy," I said.</p>

<p>As I spoke I drew my chair rather closer to the fire, and sent a
swift and, I confess, a somewhat apprehensive scrutiny round the
walls of the brightly lit room. I noticed at the same time that
Anthony was peering across to the chimney-piece, on which, just below
a sconce holding two electric lights, stood the clock which at the
beginning of our talk he had offered to stop. The hands I noticed
pointed to twenty-five minutes to one.</p>

<p>"But you saw nothing?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever," I said. "Why should I? What was there to see?
Or did you--"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," he said.</p>

<p>Somehow this answer got on my nerves, for the queer feeling which
had accompanied that cold current of air had not left me. If anything
it had become more acute.</p>

<p>"But surely you know whether you saw anything or not?" I said.</p>

<p>"One can't always be certain," said he. "I say that I don't think
I saw anything. But I'm not sure, either, whether the story I am
telling you was quite concluded last night. I think there may be a
further incident. If you prefer it, I will leave the rest of it, as
far as I know it, unfinished till to-morrow morning, and you can go
off to bed now."</p>

<p>His complete calmness and tranquillity reassured me.</p>

<p>"But why should I do that?" I asked.</p>

<p>Again he looked round on the bright walls.</p>

<p>"Well, I think something entered the room just now," he said, "and
it may develop. If you don't like the notion, you had better go. Of
course there's nothing to be alarmed at; whatever it is, it can't
hurt us. But it is close on the hour when on two successive nights I
saw what I have already told you, and an apparition usually occurs at
the same time. Why that is so, I cannot say, but certainly it looks
as if a spirit that is earth-bound is still subject to certain
conventions, the conventions of time for instance. I think that
personally I shall see something before long, but most likely you
won't. You're not such a sufferer as I from these--these
delusions--"</p>

<p>I was frightened and knew it, but I was also intensely interested,
and some perverse pride wriggled within me at his last words. Why, so
I asked myself, shouldn't I see whatever was to be seen?...</p>

<p>"I don't want to go in the least," I said. "I want to hear the
rest of your story."</p>

<p>"Where was I, then? Ah, yes: you were wondering why I didn't do
something after I saw the train move up to the platform, and I said
that there was nothing to be done. If you think it over, I fancy you
will agree with me...A couple of days passed, and on the third
morning I saw in the paper that there had come fulfilment to my
vision. Sir Henry Payle, who had been waiting on the platform of
Dover Street Station for the last train to South Kensington, had
thrown himself in front of it as it came into the station. The train
had been pulled up in a couple of yards, but a wheel had passed over
his chest, crushing it in and instantly killing him.</p>

<p>"An inquest was held, and there emerged at it one of those dark
stories which, on occasions like these, sometimes fall like a
midnight shadow across a life that the world perhaps had thought
prosperous. He had long been on bad terms with his wife, from whom he
had lived apart, and it appeared that not long before this he had
fallen desperately in love with another woman. The night before his
suicide he had appeared very late at his wife's house, and had a long
and angry scene with her in which he entreated her to divorce him,
threatening otherwise to make her life a hell to her. She refused,
and in an ungovernable fit of passion he attempted to strangle her.
There was a struggle and the noise of it caused her manservant to
come up, who succeeded in overmastering him. Lady Payle threatened to
proceed against him for assault with the intention to murder her.
With this hanging over his head, the next night, as I have already
told you, he committed suicide."</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock again, and I saw that the hands now
pointed to ten minutes to one.</p>

<p>The fire was beginning to burn low and the room surely was growing
strangely cold.</p>

<p>"That's not quite all," said Anthony, again looking round. "Are
you sure you wouldn't prefer to hear it to-morrow?"</p>

<p>The mixture of shame and pride and curiosity again prevailed.</p>

<p>"No: tell me the rest of it at once," I said.</p>

<p>Before speaking, he peered suddenly at some point behind my chair,
shading his eyes. I followed his glance, and knew what he meant by
saying that sometimes one could not be sure whether one saw something
or not. But was that an outlined shadow that intervened between me
and the wall? It was difficult to focus; I did not know whether it
was near the wall or near my chair. It seemed to clear away, anyhow,
as I looked more closely at it.</p>

<p>"You see nothing?" asked Anthony.</p>

<p>"No: I don't think so," said I. "And you?"</p>

<p>"I think I do," he said, and his eyes followed something which was
invisible to mine. They came to rest between him and the
chimney-piece. Looking steadily there, he spoke again.</p>

<p>"All this happened some weeks ago," he said, "when you were out in
Switzerland, and since then, up till last night, I saw nothing
further. But all the time I was expecting something further. I felt
that, as far as I was concerned, it was not all over yet, and last
night, with the intention of assisting any communication to come
through to me from--from beyond, I went into the Dover Street
tube-station at a few minutes before one o'clock, the hour at which
both the assault and the suicide had taken place. The platform when I
arrived on it was absolutely empty, or appeared to be so, but
presently, just as I began to hear the roar of the approaching train,
I saw there was the figure of a man standing some twenty yards from
me, looking into the tunnel. He had not come down with me in the
lift, and the moment before he had not been there. He began moving
towards me, and then I saw who it was, and I felt a stir of wind
icy-cold coming towards me as he approached. It was not the draught
that heralds the approach of a train, for it came from the opposite
direction. He came close up to me, and I saw there was recognition in
his eyes. He raised his face towards me and I saw his lips move, but,
perhaps in the increasing noise from the tunnel, I heard nothing come
from them. He put out his hand, as if entreating me to do something,
and with a cowardice for which I cannot forgive myself, I shrank from
him, for I knew, by the sign that I have told you, that this was one
from the dead, and my flesh quaked before him, drowning for the
moment all pity and all desire to help him, if that was
possible.</p>

<p>"Certainly he had something which he wanted of me, but I recoiled
from him. And by now the train was emerging from the tunnel, and next
moment, with a dreadful gesture of despair, he threw himself in front
of it."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking he got up quickly from his chair, still
looking fixedly in front of him.</p>

<p>I saw his pupils dilate, and his mouth worked.</p>

<p>"It is coming," he said. "I am to be given a chance of atoning for
my cowardice. There is nothing to be afraid of: I must remember that
myself..."</p>

<p>As he spoke there came from the panelling above the chimney-piece
one loud shattering crack, and the cold wind again circled about my
head. I found myself shrinking back in my chair with my hands held in
front of me as instinctively I screened myself against something
which I knew was there but which I could not see. Every sense told me
that there was a presence in the room other than mine and Anthony's,
and the horror of it was that I could not see it. Any vision, however
terrible, would, I felt, be more tolerable than this clear certain
knowledge that close to me was this invisible thing. And yet what
horror might not be disclosed of the face of the dead and the crushed
chest...But all I could see, as I shuddered in this cold wind, was
the familiar walls of the room, and Anthony standing in front of me
stiff and firm, making, as I knew, a call on his courage. His eyes
were focused on something quite close to him, and some semblance of a
smile quivered on his mouth. And then he spoke again.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you," he said. "And you want something of me. Tell
me, then, what it is."</p>

<p>There was absolute silence, but what was silence to my ears could
not have been so to his, for once or twice he nodded, and once he
said, "Yes: I see. I will do it." And with the knowledge that, even
as there was someone here whom I could not see, so there was speech
going on which I could not hear, this terror of the dead and of the
unknown rose in me with the sense of powerlessness to move that
accompanies nightmare. I could not stir, I could not speak. I could
only strain my ears for the inaudible and my eyes for the unseen,
while the cold wind from the very valley of the shadow of death
streamed over me. It was not that the presence of death itself was
terrible; it was that from its tranquillity and serene keeping there
had been driven some unquiet soul unable to rest in peace for
whatever ultimate awakening rouses the countless generations of those
who have passed away, driven, no less, from whatever activities are
theirs, back into the material world from which it should have been
delivered. Never, until the gulf between the living and the dead was
thus bridged, had it seemed so immense and so unnatural. It is
possible that the dead may have communication with the living, and it
was not that exactly that so terrified me, for such communication, as
we know it, comes voluntarily from them. But here was something
icy-cold and crime-laden, that was chased back from the peace that
would not pacify it.</p>

<p>And then, most horrible of all, there came a change in these
unseen conditions. Anthony was silent now, and from looking straight
and fixedly in front of him, he began to glance sideways to where I
sat and back again, and with that I felt that the unseen presence had
turned its attention from him to me. And now, too, gradually and by
awful degrees I began to see...</p>

<p>There came an outline of shadow across the chimney-piece and the
panels above it. It took shape: it fashioned itself into the outline
of a man. Within the shape of the shadow details began to form
themselves, and I saw wavering in the air, like something concealed
by haze, the semblance of a face, stricken and tragic, and burdened
with such a weight of woe as no human face had ever worn. Next, the
shoulders outlined themselves, and a stain livid and red spread out
below them, and suddenly the vision leaped into clearness. There he
stood, the chest crushed in and drowned in the red stain, from which
broken ribs, like the bones of a wrecked ship, protruded. The
mournful, terrible eyes were fixed on me, and it was from them, so I
knew, that the bitter wind proceeded...</p>

<p>Then, quick as the switching off of a lamp, the spectre vanished,
and the bitter wind was still, and opposite to me stood Anthony, in a
quiet, bright-lit room. There was no sense of an unseen presence any
more; he and I were then alone, with an interrupted conversation
still dangling between us in the warm air. I came round to that, as
one comes round after an anesthetic. It all swam into sight again,
unreal at first, and gradually assuming the texture of actuality.</p>

<p>"You were talking to somebody, not to me," I said. "Who was it?
What was it?"</p>

<p>He passed the back of his hand over his forehead, which glistened
in the light.</p>

<p>"A soul in hell," he said.</p>

<p>Now it is hard ever to recall mere physical sensations, when they
have passed. If you have been cold and are warmed, it is difficult to
remember what cold was like: if you have been hot and have got cool,
it is difficult to realise what the oppression of heat really meant.
Just so, with the passing of that presence, I found myself unable to
recapture the sense of the terror with which, a few moments ago only,
it had invaded and inspired me.</p>

<p>"A soul in hell?" I said. "What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>He moved about the room for a minute or so, and then came and sat
on the arm of my chair.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you saw," he said, "or what you felt, but there
has never in all my life happened to me anything more real than what
these last few minutes have brought. I have talked to a soul in the
hell of remorse, which is the only possible hell. He knew, from what
happened last night, that he could perhaps establish communication
through me with the world he had quitted, and he sought me and found
me. I am charged with a mission to a woman I have never seen, a
message from the contrite...You can guess who it is..."</p>

<p>He got up with a sudden briskness.</p>

<p>"Let's verify it anyhow," he said. "He gave me the street and the
number. Ah, there's the telephone book! Would it be a coincidence
merely if I found that at No. 20 in Chasemore Street, South
Kensington, there lived a Lady Payle?"</p>

<p>He turned over the leaves of the bulky volume.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right," he said.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17"></a>The Confession of Charles Linkworth</h2>

<p>Dr. Teesdale had occasion to attend the condemned man once or
twice during the week before his execution, and found him, as is
often the case, when his last hope of life has vanished, quiet and
perfectly resigned to his fate, and not seeming to look forward with
any dread to the morning that each hour that passed brought nearer
and nearer. The bitterness of death appeared to be over for him: it
was done with when he was told that his appeal was refused. But for
those days while hope was not yet quite abandoned, the wretched man
had drunk of death daily. In all his experience the doctor had never
seen a man so wildly and passionately tenacious of life, nor one so
strongly knit to this material world by the sheer animal lust of
living. Then the news that hope could no longer be entertained was
told him, and his spirit passed out of the grip of that agony of
torture and suspense, and accepted the inevitable with indifference.
Yet the change was so extraordinary that it seemed to the doctor
rather that the news had completely stunned his powers of feeling,
and he was below the numbed surface, still knit into material things
as strongly as ever. He had fainted when the result was told him, and
Dr. Teesdale had been called in to attend him. But the fit was but
transient, and he came out of it into full consciousness of what had
happened.</p>

<p>The murder had been a deed of peculiar horror, and there was
nothing of sympathy in the mind of the public towards the
perpetrator. Charles Linkworth, who now lay under capital sentence,
was the keeper of a small stationery store in Sheffield, and there
lived with him his wife and mother. The latter was the victim of his
atrocious crime; the motive of it being to get possession of the sum
of five hundred pounds, which was this woman's property. Linkworth,
as came out at the trial, was in debt to the extent of a hundred
pounds at the time, and during his wife's absence from home on a
visit to relations, he strangled his mother, and during the night
buried the body in the small back-garden of his house. On his wife's
return, he had a sufficiently plausible tale to account for the elder
Mrs. Linkworth's disappearance, for there had been constant jarrings
and bickerings between him and his mother for the last year or two,
and she had more than once threatened to withdraw herself and the
eight shillings a week which she contributed to household expenses,
and purchase an annuity with her money. It was true, also, that
during the younger Mrs. Linkworth's absence from home, mother and son
had had a violent quarrel arising originally from some trivial point
in household management, and that in consequence of this, she had
actually drawn her money out of the bank, intending to leave
Sheffield next day and settle in London, where she had friends. That
evening she told him this, and during the night he killed her.</p>

<p>His next step, before his wife's return, was logical and sound. He
packed up all his mother's possessions and took them to the station,
from which he saw them despatched to town by passenger train, and in
the evening he asked several friends in to supper, and told them of
his mother's departure. He did not (logically also, and in accordance
with what they probably already knew) feign regret, but said that he
and she had never got on well together, and that the cause of peace
and quietness was furthered by her going. He told the same story to
his wife on her return, identical in every detail, adding, however,
that the quarrel had been a violent one, and that his mother had not
even left him her address. This again was wisely thought of: it would
prevent his wife from writing to her. She appeared to accept his
story completely: indeed there was nothing strange or suspicious
about it.</p>

<p>For a while he behaved with the composure and astuteness which
most criminals possess up to a certain point, the lack of which,
after that, is generally the cause of their detection. He did not,
for instance, immediately pay off his debts, but took into his house
a young man as lodger, who occupied his mother's room, and he
dismissed the assistant in his shop, and did the entire serving
himself. This gave the impression of economy, and at the same time he
openly spoke of the great improvement in his trade, and not till a
month had passed did he cash any of the bank-notes which he had found
in a locked drawer in his mother's room. Then he changed two notes of
fifty pounds and paid off his creditors.</p>

<p>At that point his astuteness and composure failed him. He opened a
deposit account at a local bank with four more fifty-pound notes,
instead of being patient, and increasing his balance at the savings
bank pound by pound, and he got uneasy about that which he had buried
deep enough for security in the back-garden. Thinking to render
himself safer in this regard, he ordered a cartload of slag and stone
fragments, and with the help of his lodger employed the summer
evenings when work was over in building a sort of rockery over the
spot. Then came the chance circumstance which really set match to
this dangerous train. There was a fire in the lost luggage office at
King's Cross Station (from which he ought to have claimed his
mother's property) and one of the two boxes was partially burned. The
company was liable for compensation, and his mother's name on her
linen, and a letter with the Sheffield address on it, led to the
arrival of a purely official and formal notice, stating that the
company were prepared to consider claims. It was directed to Mrs.
Linkworth's and Charles Linkworth's wife received and read it.</p>

<p>It seemed a sufficiently harmless document, but it was endorsed
with his death-warrant. For he could give no explanation at all of
the fact of the boxes still lying at King's Cross Station, beyond
suggesting that some accident had happened to his mother. Clearly he
had to put the matter in the hands of the police, with a view to
tracing her movements, and if it proved that she was dead, claiming
her property, which she had already drawn out of the bank. Such at
least was the course urged on him by his wife and lodger, in whose
presence the communication from the railway officials was read out,
and it was impossible to refuse to take it. Then the silent,
uncreaking machinery of justice, characteristic of England, began to
move forward. Quiet men lounged about Smith Street, visited banks,
observed the supposed increase in trade, and from a house near by
looked into the garden where ferns were already flourishing on the
rockery. Then came the arrest and the trial, which did not last very
long, and on a certain Saturday night the verdict. Smart women in
large hats had made the court bright with colour, and in all the
crowd there was not one who felt any sympathy with the young
athletic-looking man who was condemned. Many of the audience were
elderly and respectable mothers, and the crime had been an outrage on
motherhood, and they listened to the unfolding of the flawless
evidence with strong approval. They thrilled a little when the judge
put on the awful and ludicrous little black cap, and spoke the
sentence appointed by God.</p>

<p>Linkworth went to pay the penalty for the atrocious deed, which no
one who had heard the evidence could possibly doubt that he had done
with the same indifference as had marked his entire demeanour since
he knew his appeal had failed. The prison chaplain who had attended
him had done his utmost to get him to confess, but his efforts had
been quite ineffectual, and to the last he asserted, though without
protestation, his innocence. On a bright September morning, when the
sun shone warm on the terrible little procession that crossed the
prison yard to the shed where was erected the apparatus of death,
justice was done, and Dr. Teesdale was satisfied that life was
immediately extinct. He had been present on the scaffold, had watched
the bolt drawn, and the hooded and pinioned figure drop into the pit.
He had heard the chunk and creak of the rope as the sudden weight
came on to it, and looking down he had seen the queer twitchings of
the hanged body. They had lasted but a second for the execution had
been perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p>An hour later he made the post-mortem examination and found that
his view had been correct: the vertebrae of the spine had been broken
at the neck, and death must have been absolutely instantaneous. It
was hardly necessary even to make that little piece of dissection
that proved this, but for the sake of form he did so. And at that
moment he had a very curious and vivid mental impression that the
spirit of the dead man was close beside him, as if it still dwelt in
the broken habitation of its body. But there was no question at all
that the body was dead: it had been dead an hour. Then followed
another little circumstance that at the first seemed insignificant
though curious also. One of the warders entered, and asked if the
rope which had been used an hour ago, and was the hangman's
perquisite, had by mistake been brought into the mortuary with the
body. But there was no trace of it, and it seemed to have vanished
altogether, though it a singular thing to be lost: it was not here;
it was not on the scaffold. And though the disappearance was of no
particular moment it was quite inexplicable.</p>

<p>Dr. Teesdale was a bachelor and a man of independent means, and
lived in a tall-windowed and commodious house in Bedford Square,
where a plain cook of surpassing excellence looked after his food,
and her husband his person. There was no need for him to practise a
profession at all, and he performed his work at the prison for the
sake of the study of the minds of criminals.</p>

<p>Most crime--the transgression, that is, of the rule of conduct
which the human race has framed for the sake of its own
preservation--he held to be either the result of some abnormality, of
the brain or of starvation. Crimes of theft, for instance, he would
by no means refer to one head; often it is true they were the result
of actual want, but more often dictated by some obscure disease of
the brain. In marked cases it was labelled as kleptomania, but he was
convinced there were many others which did not fall directly under
the dictation of physical need. More especially was this the case
where the crime in question involved also some deed of violence, and
he mentally placed underneath this heading, as he went home that
evening, the criminal at whose last moments he had been present that
morning. The crime had been abominable, the need of money not so very
pressing, and the very abomination and unnaturalness of the murder
inclined him to consider the murderer as lunatic rather than
criminal. He had been, as far as was known, a man of quiet and kindly
disposition, a good husband, a sociable neighbour. And then he had
committed a crime, just one, which put him outside all pales. So
monstrous a deed, whether perpetrated by a sane man or a mad one, was
intolerable; there was no use for the doer of it on this planet at
all. But somehow the doctor felt that he would have been more at one
with the execution of justice, if the dead man had confessed. It was
morally certain that he was guilty, but he wished that when there was
no longer any hope for him he had endorsed the verdict himself.</p>

<p>He dined alone that evening, and after dinner sat in his study
which adjoined the dining-room, and feeling disinclined to read, sat
in his great red chair opposite the fireplace, and let his mind graze
where it would. At once almost, it went back to the curious sensation
he had experienced that morning, of feeling that the spirit of
Linkworth was present in the mortuary, though life had been extinct
for an hour. It was not the first time, especially in cases of sudden
death, that he had felt a similar conviction, though perhaps it had
never been quite so unmistakable as it had been to-day. Yet the
feeling, to his mind, was quite probably formed on a natural and
psychical truth.</p>

<p>The spirit--it may be remarked that he was a believer in the
doctrine of future life, and the non-extinction of the soul with the
death of the body--was very likely unable or unwilling to quit at
once and altogether the earthly habitation, very likely it lingered
there, earth-bound, for a while.</p>

<p>In his leisure hours Dr. Teesdale was a considerable student of
the occult, for like most advanced and proficient physicians, he
clearly recognised how narrow was the boundary of separation between
soul and body, how tremendous the influence of the intangible was
over material things, and it presented no difficulty to his mind that
a disembodied spirit should be able to communicate directly with
those who still were bounded by the finite and material.</p>

<p>His meditations, which were beginning to group themselves into
definite sequence, were interrupted at this moment. On his desk near
at hand stood his telephone, and the bell rang, not with its usual
metallic insistence, but very faintly, as if the current was weak, or
the mechanism impaired. However, it certainly was ringing, and he got
up and took the combined ear and mouth-piece off its hook.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said, "who is it?"</p>

<p>There was a whisper in reply almost inaudible, and quite
unintelligible.</p>

<p>"I can't hear you," he said.</p>

<p>Again the whisper sounded, but with no greater distinctness. Then
it ceased altogether.</p>

<p>He stood there, for some half minute or so, waiting for it to be
renewed, but beyond the usual chuckling and croaking, which showed,
however, that he was in communication with some other instrument,
there was silence. Then he replaced the receiver, rang up the
Exchange, and gave his number.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me what number rang me up just now?" he asked.</p>

<p>There was a short pause, then it was given him. It was the number
of the prison, where he was doctor.</p>

<p>"Put me on to it, please," he said.</p>

<p>This was done.</p>

<p>"You rang me up just now," he said down the tube. "Yes; I am
Doctor Teesdale. What is it? I could not hear what you said."</p>

<p>The voice came back quite clear and intelligible.</p>

<p>"Some mistake, sir," it said. "We haven't rung you up."</p>

<p>"But the Exchange tells me you did, three minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Mistake at the Exchange, sir," said the voice.</p>

<p>"Very odd. Well, good-night. Warder Draycott, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; good-night, sir."</p>

<p>Dr. Teesdale went back to his big arm-chair, still less inclined
to read. He let his thoughts wander on for a while, without giving
them definite direction, but ever and again his mind kept coming back
to that strange little incident of the telephone. Often and often he
had been rung up by some mistake, often and often he had been put on
to the wrong number by the Exchange, but there was something in this
very subdued ringing of the telephone bell, and the unintelligible
whisperings at the other end that suggested a very curious train of
reflection to his mind, and soon he found himself pacing up and down
his room, with his thoughts eagerly feeding on a most unusual
pasture.</p>

<p>"But it's impossible," he said, aloud.</p>

<p>He went down as usual to the prison next morning, and once again
he was strangely beset with the feeling that there was some unseen
presence there. He had before now had some odd psychical experiences,
and knew that he was a "sensitive"--one, that is, who is capable,
under certain circumstances, of receiving supernormal impressions,
and of having glimpses of the unseen world that lies about us. And
this morning the presence of which he was conscious was that of the
man who had been executed yesterday morning. It was local, and he
felt it most strongly in the little prison yard, and as he passed the
door of the condemned cell. So strong was it there that he would not
have been surprised if the figure of the man had been visible to him,
and as he passed through the door at the end of the passage, he
turned round, actually expecting to see it. All the time, too, he was
aware of a profound horror at his heart; this unseen presence
strangely disturbed him. And the poor soul, he felt, wanted something
done for it. Not for a moment did he doubt that this impression of
his was objective, it was no imaginative phantom of his own invention
that made itself so real. The spirit of Linkworth was there.</p>

<p>He passed into the infirmary, and for a couple of hours busied
himself with his work. But all the time he was aware that the same
invisible presence was near him, though its force was manifestly less
here than in those places which had been more intimately associated
with the man. Finally, before he left, in order to test his theory he
looked into the execution shed. But next moment with a face suddenly
stricken pale, he came out again, closing the door hastily. At the
top of the steps stood a figure hooded and pinioned, but hazy of
outline and only faintly visible.</p>

<p>But it was visible, there was no mistake about it.</p>

<p>Dr. Teesdale was a man of good nerve, and he recovered himself
almost immediately, ashamed of his temporary panic. The terror that
had blanched his face was chiefly the effect of startled nerves, not
of terrified heart, and yet deeply interested as he was in psychical
phenomena, he could not command himself sufficiently to go back
there. Or rather he commanded himself, but his muscles refused to act
on the message. If this poor earth-bound spirit had any communication
to make to him, he certainly much preferred that it should be made at
a distance. As far as he could understand, its range was
circumscribed. It haunted the prison yard, the condemned cell, the
execution shed, it was more faintly felt in the infirmary. Then a
further point suggested itself to his mind, and he went back to his
room and sent for Warder Draycott, who had answered him on the
telephone last night.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure," he asked, "that nobody rang me up last
night, just before I rang you up?"</p>

<p>There was a certain hesitation in the man's manner which the
doctor noticed.</p>

<p>"I don't see how it could be possible, sir," he said. "I had been
sitting close by the telephone for half an hour before, and again
before that. I must have seen him, if anyone had been to the
instrument."</p>

<p>"And you saw no one?" said the doctor with a slight emphasis.</p>

<p>The man became more markedly ill at ease.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I saw no one," he said, with the same emphasis.</p>

<p>Dr. Teesdale looked away from him.</p>

<p>"But you had perhaps the impression that there was some one
there?" he asked, carelessly, as if it was a point of no
interest.</p>

<p>Clearly Warder Draycott had something on his mind, which he found
it hard to speak of.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if you put it like that," he began. "But you would
tell me I was half asleep, or had eaten something that disagreed with
me at my supper."</p>

<p>The doctor dropped his careless manner.</p>

<p>"I should do nothing of the kind," he said, "any more than you
would tell me that I had dropped asleep last night, when I heard my
telephone bell ring. Mind you, Draycott, it did not ring as usual, I
could only just hear it ringing, though it was close to me. And I
could only hear a whisper when I put my ear to it. But when you spoke
I heard you quite distinctly. Now I believe there was
something--somebody--at this end of the telephone. You were here,
and though you saw no one, you, too, felt there was someone
there."</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>"I'm not a nervous man, sir," he said, "and I don't deal in
fancies. But there was something there. It was hovering about the
instrument, and it wasn't the wind, because there wasn't a breath of
wind stirring, and the night was warm. And I shut the window to make
certain. But it went about the room, sir, for an hour or more. It
rustled the leaves of the telephone book, and it ruffled my hair when
it came close to me. And it was bitter cold, sir."</p>

<p>The doctor looked him straight in the face.</p>

<p>"Did it remind you of what had been done yesterday morning?" he
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Again the man hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said at length. "Convict Charles Linkworth."</p>

<p>Dr. Teesdale nodded reassuringly.</p>

<p>"That's it," he said. "Now, are you on duty to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I wish I wasn't."</p>

<p>"I know how you feel, I have felt exactly the same myself. Now
whatever this is, it seems to want to communicate with me. By the
way, did you have any disturbance in the prison last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, there was half a dozen men who had the nightmare.
Yelling and screaming they were, and quiet men too, usually. It
happens sometimes the night after an execution. I've known it before,
though nothing like what it was last night."</p>

<p>"I see. Now, if this--this thing you can't see wants to get at the
telephone again to-night, give it every chance. It will probably come
about the same time. I can't tell you why, but that usually happens.
So unless you must, don't be in this room where the telephone is,
just for an hour to give it plenty of time between half-past nine and
half-past ten. I will be ready for it at the other end. Supposing I
am rung up, I will, when it has finished, ring you up to make sure
that I was not being called in--in the usual way."</p>

<p>"And there is nothing to be afraid of, sir!" asked the man.</p>

<p>Dr. Teesdale remembered his own moment of terror this morning, but
he spoke quite sincerely.</p>

<p>"I am sure there is nothing to be afraid of," he said,
reassuringly.</p>

<p>Dr. Teesdale had a dinner engagement that night, which he broke,
and was sitting alone in his study by half past-nine. In the present
state of human ignorance as to the law which governs the movements of
spirits severed from the body, he could not tell the warder why it
was that their visits are so often periodic, timed to punctuality
according to our scheme of hours, but in scenes of tabulated
instances of the appearance of revenants, especially if the soul was
in sore need of help, as might be the case here, he found that they
came at the same hour of day or night. As a rule, too, their power of
making themselves seen or heard or felt grew greater for some little
while after death, subsequently growing weaker as they became less
earth-bound, or often after that ceasing altogether, and he was
prepared to-night for a less indistinct impression. The spirit
apparently for the early hours of its disembodiment is weak, like a
moth newly broken out from its chrysalis--and then suddenly the
telephone bell rang, not so faintly as the night before, but still
not with its ordinary imperative tone.</p>

<p>Dr. Teesdale instantly got up, put the receiver to his ear. And
what he heard was heartbroken sobbing, strong spasms that seemed to
tear the weeper.</p>

<p>He waited for a little before speaking, himself cold with some
nameless fear, and yet profoundly moved to help, if he was able.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said at length, hearing his own voice tremble. "I
am Dr. Teesdale. What can I do for you? And who are you?" he added,
though he felt that it was a needless question.</p>

<p>Slowly the sobbing died down, the whispers took its place, still
broken by crying.</p>

<p>"I want to tell, sir--I want to tell--I must tell."</p>

<p>"Yes, tell me, what is it?" said the doctor.</p>

<p>"No, not you--another gentleman, who used to come to see me. Will
you speak to him what I say to you?--I can't make him hear me or see
me."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Dr. Teesdale suddenly.</p>

<p>"Charles Linkworth. I thought you knew. I am very miserable. I
can't leave the prison--and it is cold. Will you send for the other
gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean the chaplain?" asked Dr. Teesdale.</p>

<p>"Yes, the chaplain. He read the service when I went across the
yard yesterday. I shan't be so miserable when I have told."</p>

<p>The doctor hesitated a moment. This was a strange story that he
would have to tell Mr. Dawkins, the prison chaplain, that at the other end of the
telephone was the spirit of the man executed yesterday. And yet he
soberly believed that it was so, that this unhappy spirit was in
misery and wanted to "tell." There was no need to ask what he wanted
to tell.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will ask him to come here," he said at length.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, a thousand times. You will make him come, won't
you?"</p>

<p>The voice was growing fainter.</p>

<p>"It must be to-morrow night," it said. "I can't speak longer now.
I have to go to see--oh, my God, my God."</p>

<p>The sobs broke out afresh, sounding fainter and fainter. But it
was in a frenzy of terrified interest that Dr. Teesdale spoke.</p>

<p>"To see what?" he cried. "Tell me what you are doing, what is
happening to you?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you; I mayn't tell you," said the voice very faint.
"That is part--" and it died away altogether.</p>

<p>Dr. Teesdale waited a little, but there was no further sound of
any kind, except the chuckling and croaking of the instrument. He put
the receiver on to its hook again, and then became aware for the
first time that his forehead was streaming with some cold dew of
horror. His ears sang; his heart beat very quick and faint, and he
sat down to recover himself. Once or twice he asked himself if it was
possible that some terrible joke was being played on him, but he knew
that could not be so; he felt perfectly sure that he had been
speaking with a soul in torment of contrition for the terrible and
irremediable act it had committed. It was no delusion of his senses,
either; here in this comfortable room of his in Bedford Square, with
London cheerfully roaring round him, he had spoken with the spirit of
Charles Linkworth.</p>

<p>But he had no time (nor indeed inclination, for somehow his soul
sat shuddering within him) to indulge in meditation. First of all he
rang up the prison.</p>

<p>"Warder Draycott?" he asked.</p>

<p>There was a perceptible tremor in the man's voice as he
answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Is it Dr. Teesdale?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Has anything happened here with you?"</p>

<p>Twice it seemed that the man tried to speak and could not. At the
third attempt the words came "Yes, sir. He has been here. I saw him
go into the room where the telephone is."</p>

<p>"Ah! Did you speak to him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir: I sweated and prayed. And there's half a dozen men as
have been screaming in their sleep to-night. But it's quiet again
now. I think he has gone into the execution shed."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, I think there will be no more disturbance now. By the
way, please give me Mr. Dawkins's home address."</p>

<p>This was given him, and Dr. Teesdale proceeded to write to the
chaplain, asking him to dine with him on the following night. But
suddenly he found that he could not write at his accustomed desk,
with the telephone standing close to him, and he went upstairs to the
drawing-room which he seldom used, except when he entertained his
friends. There he recaptured the serenity of his nerves, and could
control his hand. The note simply asked Mr. Dawkins to dine with him
next night, when he wished to tell him a very strange history and ask
his help. "Even if you have any other engagement," he concluded, "I
seriously request you to give it up. To-night, I did the same.</p>

<p>"I should bitterly have regretted it if I had not."</p>

<p>Next night accordingly, the two sat at their dinner in the
doctor's dining-room, and when they were left to their cigarettes and
coffee the doctor spoke.</p>

<p>"You must not think me mad, my dear Dawkins," he said, "when you
hear what I have got to tell you."</p>

<p>Mr. Dawkins laughed.</p>

<p>"I will certainly promise not to do that," he said.</p>

<p>"Good. Last night and the night before, a little later in the
evening than this, I spoke through the telephone with the spirit of
the man we saw executed two days ago. Charles Linkworth."</p>

<p>The chaplain did not laugh. He pushed back his chair, looking
annoyed.</p>

<p>"Teesdale," he said, "is it to tell me this--I don't want to be
rude--but this bogey-tale that you have brought me here this
evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You have not heard half of it. He asked me last night to get
hold of you. He wants to tell you something. We can guess, I think,
what it is."</p>

<p>Dawkins got up.</p>

<p>"Please let me hear no more of it," he said. "The dead do not
return. In what state or under what condition they exist has not been
revealed to us. But they have done with all material things."</p>

<p>"But I must tell you more," said the doctor. "Two nights ago I was
rung up, but very faintly, and could only hear whispers. I instantly
inquired where the call came from and was told it came from the
prison. I rang up the prison, and Warder Draycott told me that nobody
had rung me up. He, too, was conscious of a presence."</p>

<p>"I think that man drinks," said Dawkins, sharply.</p>

<p>The doctor paused a moment.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, you should not say that sort of thing," he said.
"He is one of the steadiest men we have got. And if he drinks, why
not I also?"</p>

<p>The chaplain sat down again.</p>

<p>"You must forgive me," he said, "but I can't go into this. These
are dangerous matters to meddle with. Besides, how do you know it is
not a hoax?"</p>

<p>"Played by whom?" asked the doctor. "Hark!"</p>

<p>The telephone bell suddenly rang. It was clearly audible to the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear it?" he said.</p>

<p>"Hear what?"</p>

<p>"The telephone bell ringing."</p>

<p>"I hear no bell," said the chaplain, rather angrily. "There is no
bell ringing."</p>

<p>The doctor did not answer, but went through into his study, and
turned on the lights. Then he took the receiver and mouthpiece off
its hook.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said, in a voice that trembled. "Who is it? Yes: Mr.
Dawkins is here. I will try and get him to speak to you." He went
back into the other room.</p>

<p>"Dawkins," he said, "there is a soul in agony. I pray you to
listen. For God's sake come and listen."</p>

<p>The chaplain hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"As you will," he said.</p>

<p>He took up the receiver and put it to his ear.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Dawkins," he said.</p>

<p>He waited.</p>

<p>"I can hear nothing whatever," he said at length. "Ah, there was
something there. The faintest whisper."</p>

<p>"Ah, try to hear, try to hear!" said the doctor.</p>

<p>Again the chaplain listened. Suddenly he laid the instrument down,
frowning.</p>

<p>"Something--somebody said, 'I killed her, I confess it. I want to
be forgiven.' It's a hoax, my dear Teesdale. Somebody knowing your
spiritualistic leanings is playing a very grim joke on you. I can't
believe it."</p>

<p>Dr. Teesdale took up the receiver.</p>

<p>"I am Dr. Teesdale," he said. "Can you give Mr. Dawkins some sign
that it is you?"</p>

<p>Then he laid it down again.</p>

<p>"He says he thinks he can," he said. "We must wait."</p>

<p>The evening was again very warm, and the window into the paved
yard at the back of the house was open. For five minutes or so the
two men stood in silence, waiting, and nothing happened. Then the
chaplain spoke.</p>

<p>"I think that is sufficiently conclusive," he said.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke a very cold draught of air suddenly blew into the
room, making the papers on the desk rustle. Dr. Teesdale went to the
window and closed it.</p>

<p>"Did you feel that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, a breath of air. Chilly."</p>

<p>Once again in the closed room it stirred again.</p>

<p>"And did you feel that?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>The chaplain nodded. He felt his heart hammering in his throat
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Defend us from all peril and danger of this coming night," he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Something is coming!" said the doctor.</p>

<p>As he spoke it came. In the centre of the room not three yards
away from them stood the figure of a man with his head bent over on
to his shoulder, so that the face was not visible. Then he took his
head in both his hands and raised it like a weight, and looked them
in the face. The eyes and tongue protruded, a livid mark was round
the neck. Then there came a sharp rattle on the boards of the floor,
and the figure was no longer there. But on the floor there lay a new
rope.</p>

<p>For a long while neither spoke. The sweat poured off the doctor's
face, and the chaplain's white lips whispered prayers. Then by a huge
effort the doctor pulled himself together. He pointed at the
rope.</p>

<p>"It has been missing since the execution," he said.</p>

<p>Then again the telephone bell rang. This time the chaplain needed
no prompting. He went to it at once and the ringing ceased. For a
while he listened in silence.</p>

<p>"Charles Linkworth," he said at length, "in the sight of God, in
whose presence you stand, are you truly sorry for your sin?"</p>

<p>Some answer inaudible to the doctor came, and the chaplain closed
his eyes. And Dr. Teesdale knelt as he heard the words of the
Absolution.</p>

<p>At the close there was silence again.</p>

<p>"I can hear nothing more," said the chaplain, replacing the
receiver.</p>

<p>Presently the doctor's man-servant came in with the tray of
spirits and syphon. Dr. Teesdale pointed without looking to where the
apparition had been.</p>

<p>"Take the rope that is there and burn it, Parker," he said.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"There is no rope, sir," said Parker.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18"></a>Negotium Perambulans</h2>

<p>The casual tourist in West Cornwall may just possibly have
noticed, as he bowled along over the bare high plateau between
Penzance and the Land's End, a dilapidated signpost pointing down a
steep lane and bearing on its battered finger the faded inscription
"Polearn 2 miles," but probably very few have had the curiosity to
traverse those two miles in order to see a place to which their
guide-books award so cursory a notice. It is described there, in a
couple of unattractive lines, as a small fishing village with a
church of no particular interest except for certain carved and
painted wooden panels (originally belonging to an earlier edifice)
which form an altar-rail. But the church at St. Creed (the tourist is
reminded) has a similar decoration far superior in point of
preservation and interest, and thus even the ecclesiastically
disposed are not lured to Polearn. So meagre a bait is scarce worth
swallowing, and a glance at the very steep lane which in dry weather
presents a carpet of sharp-pointed stones, and after rain a muddy
watercourse, will almost certainly decide him not to expose his motor
or his bicycle to risks like these in so sparsely populated a
district. Hardly a house has met his eye since he left Penzance, and
the possible trundling of a punctured bicycle for half a dozen weary
miles seems a high price to pay for the sight of a few painted
panels.</p>

<p>Polearn, therefore, even in the high noon of the tourist season,
is little liable to invasion, and for the rest of the year I do not
suppose that a couple of folk a day traverse those two miles (long
ones at that) of steep and stony gradient. I am not forgetting the
postman in this exiguous estimate, for the days are few when, leaving
his pony and cart at the top of the hill, he goes as far as the
village, since but a few hundred yards down the lane there stands a
large white box, like a sea-trunk, by the side of the road, with a
slit for letters and a locked door. Should he have in his wallet a
registered letter or be the bearer of a parcel too large for
insertion in the square lips of the sea-trunk, he must needs trudge
down the hill and deliver the troublesome missive, leaving it in
person on the owner, and receiving some small reward of coin or
refreshment for his kindness.</p>

<p>But such occasions are rare, and his general routine is to take
out of the box such letters as may have been deposited there, and
insert in their place such letters as he has brought. These will be
called for, perhaps that day or perhaps the next, by an emissary from
the Polearn post-office.</p>

<p>As for the fishermen of the place, who, in their export trade,
constitute the chief link of movement between Polearn and the outside
world, they would not dream of taking their catch up the steep lane
and so, with six miles farther of travel, to the market at Penzance.
The sea route is shorter and easier, and they deliver their wares to
the pier-head. Thus, though the sole industry of Polearn is
sea-fishing, you will get no fish there unless you have bespoken your
requirements to one of the fishermen. Back come the trawlers as empty
as a haunted house, while their spoils are in the fish-train that is
speeding to London.</p>

<p>Such isolation of a little community, continued, as it has been,
for centuries, produces isolation in the individual as well, and
nowhere will you find greater independence of character than among
the people of Polearn. But they are linked together, so it has always
seemed to me, by some mysterious comprehension: it is as if they had
all been initiated into some ancient rite, inspired and framed by
forces visible and invisible. The winter storms that batter the
coast, the vernal spell of the spring, the hot, still summers, the
season of rains and autumnal decay, have made a spell which, line by
line, has been communicated to them, concerning the powers, evil and
good, that rule the world, and manifest themselves in ways benignant
or terrible...</p>

<p>I came to Polearn first at the age of ten, a small boy, weak and
sickly, and threatened with pulmonary trouble. My father's business
kept him in London, while for me abundance of fresh air and a mild
climate were considered essential conditions if I was to grow to
manhood. His sister had married the vicar of Polearn, Richard
Bolitho, himself native to the place, and so it came about that I
spent three years, as a paying guest, with my relations. Richard
Bolitho owned a fine house in the place, which he inhabited in
preference to the vicarage, which he let to a young artist, John
Evans, on whom the spell of Polearn had fallen for from year's
beginning to year's end he never lfet it. There was a solid roofed
shelter, open on one side to the air, built for me in the garden, and
here I lived and slept, passing scarcely one hour out of the
twenty-four behind walls and windows. I was out on the bay with the
fisher-folk, or wandering along the gorse-clad cliffs that climbed
steeply to right and left of the deep combe where the village lay, or
pottering about on the pier-head, or bird's-nesting in the bushes
with the boys of the village.</p>

<p>Except on Sunday and for the few daily hours of my lessons, I
might do what I pleased so long as I remained in the open air. About
the lessons there was nothing formidable; my uncle conducted me
through flowering bypaths among the thickets of arithmetic, and made
pleasant excursions into the elements of Latin grammar, and above
all, he made me daily give him an account, in clear and grammatical
sentences, of what had been occupying my mind or my movements. Should
I select to tell him about a walk along the cliffs, my speech must be
orderly, not vague, slip-shod notes of what I had observed. In this
way, too, he trained my observation, for he would bid me tell him
what flowers were in bloom, and what birds hovered fishing over the
sea or were building in the bushes. For that I owe him a perennial
gratitude, for to observe and to express my thoughts in the clear
spoken word became my life's profession.</p>

<p>But far more formidable than my weekday tasks was the prescribed
routine for Sunday.</p>

<p>Some dark embers compounded of Calvinism and mysticism smouldered
in my uncle's soul, and made it a day of terror. His sermon in the
morning scorched us with a foretaste of the eternal fires reserved
for unrepentant sinners, and he was hardly less terrifying at the
children's service in the afternoon. Well do I remember his
exposition of the doctrine of guardian angels. A child, he said,
might think himself secure in such angelic care, but let him beware
of committing any of those numerous offences which would cause his
guardian to turn his face from him, for as sure as there were angels
to protect us, there were also evil and awful presences which were
ready to pounce; and on them he dwelt with peculiar gusto. Well, too,
do I remember in the morning sermon his commentary on the carved
panels of the altar-rails to which I have already alluded.</p>

<p>There was the angel of the Annunciation there, and the angel of
the Resurrection, but not less was there the witch of Endor, and, on
the fourth panel, a scene that concerned me most of all.</p>

<p>This fourth panel (he came down from his pulpit to trace its
time-worn features) represented the lych-gate of the church-yard at
Polearn itself, and indeed the resemblance when thus pointed out was
remarkable. In the entry stood the figure of a robed priest holding
up a Cross, with which he faced a terrible creature like a gigantic
slug, that reared itself up in front of him. That, so ran my uncle's
interpretation, was some evil agency, such as he had spoken about to
us children, of almost infinite malignity and power, which could
alone be combated by firm faith and a pure heart. Below ran the
legend "Negotium perambulans in tenebris" from the ninety-first
Psalm. We should find it translated there, "the pestilence that
walketh in darkness," which but feebly rendered the Latin. It was
more deadly to the soul than any pestilence that can only kill the
body: it was the Thing, the Creature, the Business that trafficked in
the outer Darkness, a minister of God's wrath on the unrighteous...I
could see, as he spoke, the looks which the congregation exchanged
with each other, and knew that his words were evoking a surmise, a
remembrance. Nods and whispers passed between them, they understood
to what he alluded, and with the inquisitiveness of boyhood I could
not rest till I had wormed the story out of my friends among the
fisher-boys, as, next morning, we sat basking and naked in the sun
after our bathe. One knew one bit of it, one another, but it pieced
together into a truly alarming legend. In bald outline it was as
follows:</p>

<p>A church far more ancient than that in which my uncle terrified us
every Sunday had once stood not three hundred yards away, on the
shelf of level ground below the quarry from which its stones were
hewn. The owner of the land had pulled this down, and erected for
himself a house on the same site out of these materials, keeping, in
a very ecstasy of wickedness, the altar, and on this he dined and
played dice afterwards. But as he grew old some black melancholy
seized him, and he would have lights burning there all night, for he
had deadly fear of the darkness. On one winter evening there sprang
up such a gale as was never before known, which broke in the windows
of the room where he had supped, and extinguished the lamps. Yells of
terror brought in his servants, who found him lying on the floor with
the blood streaming from his throat. As they entered some huge black
shadow seemed to move away from him, crawled across the floor and up
the wall and out of the broken window.</p>

<p>"There he lay a-dying," said the last of my informants, "and him
that had been a great burly man was withered to a bag o' skin, for
the critter had drained all the blood from him. His last breath was a
scream, and he hollered out the same words as passon read off the
screen."</p>

<p>"Negotium perambulans in tenebris," I suggested eagerly.</p>

<p>"Thereabouts. Latin anyhow."</p>

<p>"And after that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nobody would go near the place, and the old house rotted and fell
in ruins till three years ago, when along comes Mr. Dooliss from
Penzance, and built the half of it up again. But he don't care much
about such critters, nor about Latin neither. He takes his bottle of
whisky a day and gets drunk's a lord in the evening. Eh, I'm gwine
home to my dinner."</p>

<p>Whatever the authenticity of the legend, I had certainly heard the
truth about Mr. Dooliss from Penzance, who from that day became an
object of keen curiosity on my part, the more so because the
quarry-house adjoined my uncle's garden. The Thing that walked in the
dark failed to stir my imagination, and already I was so used to
sleeping alone in my shelter that the night had no terrors for me.
But it would be intensely exciting to wake at some timeless hour and
hear Mr. Dooliss yelling, and conjecture that the Thing had got
him.</p>

<p>But by degrees the whole story faded from my mind, overscored by
the more vivid interests of the day, and, for the last two years of
my out-door life in the vicarage garden, I seldom thought about Mr.
Dooliss and the possible fate that might await him for his temerity
in living in the place where that Thing of darkness had done
business. Occasionally I saw him over the garden fence, a great
yellow lump of a man, with slow and staggering gait, but never did I
set eyes on him outside his gate, either in the village street or
down on the beach. He interfered with none, and no one interfered
with him. If he wanted to run the risk of being the prey of the
legendary nocturnal monster, or quietly drink himself to death, it
was his affair. My uncle, so I gathered, had made several attempts to
see him when first he came to live at Polearn, but Mr. Dooliss
appeared to have no use for parsons, but said he was not
at home and never returned the call.</p>

<p>After three years of sun, wind, and rain, I had completely
outgrown my early symptoms and had become a tough, strapping
youngster of thirteen. I was sent to Eton and Cambridge, and in due
course ate my dinners and became a barrister. In twenty years from
that time I was earning a yearly income of five figures, and had
already laid by in sound securities a sum that brought me dividends
which would, for one of my simple tastes and frugal habits, supply me
with all the material comforts I needed on this side of the grave.
The great prizes of my profession were already within my reach, but I
had no ambition beckoning me on, nor did I want a wife and children,
being, I must suppose, a natural celibate. In fact there was only one
ambition which through these busy years had held the lure of blue and
far-off hills to me, and that was to get back to Polearn, and live
once more isolated from the world with the sea and the gorse-clad
hills for play-fellows, and the secrets that lurked there for
exploration. The spell of it had been woven about my heart, and I can
truly say that there had hardly passed a day in all those years in
which the thought of it and the desire for it had been wholly absent
from my mind. Though I had been in frequent communication with my
uncle there during his lifetime, and, after his death, with his widow
who still lived there, I had never been back to it since I embarked
on my profession, for I knew that if I went there, it would be a
wrench beyond my power to tear myself away again. But I had made up
my mind that when once I had provided for my own independence, I
would go back there not to leave it again. And yet I did leave it
again, and now nothing in the world would induce me to turn down the
lane from the road that leads from Penzance to the Land's End, and
see the sides of the combe rise steep above the roofs of the village
and hear the gulls chiding as they fish in the bay. One of the things
invisible, of the dark powers, leaped into light, and I saw it with
my eyes.</p>

<p>The house where I had spent those three years of boyhood had been
left for life to my aunt, and when I made known to her my intention
of coming back to Polearn, she suggested that, till I found a
suitable house or found her proposal unsuitable, I should come to
live with her.</p>

<p>"The house is too big for a lone old woman," she wrote, "and I
have often thought of quitting and taking a little cottage sufficient
for me and my requirements. But come and share it, my dear, and if
you find me troublesome, you or I can go. You may want solitude--most
people in Polearn do--and will leave me. Or else I will leave you:
one of the main reasons of my stopping here all these years was a
feeling that I must not let the old house starve. Houses starve, you
know, if they are not lived in. They die a lingering death; the
spirit in them grows weaker and weaker, and at last fades out of
them. Isn't this nonsense to your London notions?..."</p>

<p>Naturally I accepted with warmth this tentative arrangement, and
on an evening in June found myself at the head of the lane leading
down to Polearn, and once more I descended into the steep valley
between the hills. Time had stood still apparently for the combe, the
dilapidated signpost (or its successor) pointed a rickety finger down
the lane, and a few hundred yards farther on was the white box for
the exchange of letters. Point after remembered point met my eye, and
what I saw was not shrunk, as is often the case with the revisited
scenes of childhood, into a smaller scale. There stood the
post-office, and there the church and close beside it the vicarage,
and beyond, the tall shrubberies which separated the house for which
I was bound from the road, and beyond that again the grey roofs of
the quarry-house damp and shining with the moist evening wind from
the sea. All was exactly as I remembered it, and, above all, that
sense of seclusion and isolation. Somewhere above the tree-tops
climbed the lane which joined the main road to Penzance, but all that
had become immeasurably distant. The years that had passed since last
I turned in at the well-known gate faded like a frosty breath, and
vanished in this warm, soft air. There were law-courts somewhere in
memory's dull book which, if I cared to turn the pages, would tell me
that I had made a name and a great income there. But the dull book
was closed now, for I was back in Polearn, and the spell was woven
around me again.</p>

<p>And if Polearn was unchanged, so too was Aunt Hester, who met me
at the door. Dainty and china-white she had always been, and the
years had not aged but only refined her. As we sat and talked after
dinner she spoke of all that had happened in Polearn in that score of
years, and yet somehow the changes of which she spoke seemed but to
confirm the immutability of it all. As the recollection of names came
back to me, I asked her about the quarry-house and Mr. Dooliss, and
her face gloomed a little as with the shadow of a cloud on a spring
day.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Dooliss," she said, "poor Mr. Dooliss, how well I
remember him, though it must be ten years and more since he died. I
never wrote to you about it, for it was all very dreadful, my dear,
and I did not want to darken your memories of Polearn. Your uncle
always thought that something of the sort might happen if he went on
in his wicked, drunken ways, and worse than that, and though nobody
knew exactly what took place, it was the sort of thing that might
have been anticipated."</p>

<p>"But what more or less happened, Aunt Hester?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, of course I can't tell you everything, for no one knew it.
But he was a very sinful man, and the scandal about him at Newlyn was
shocking. And then he lived, too, in the quarry-house...</p>

<p>"I wonder if by any chance you remember a sermon of your uncle's
when he got out of the pulpit and explained that panel in the
altar-rails, the one, I mean, with the horrible creature rearing
itself up outside the lych-gate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember perfectly," said I.</p>

<p>"Ah. It made an impression on you, I suppose, and so it did on all
who heard him, and that impression got stamped and branded on us all
when the catastrophe occurred. Somehow Mr. Dooliss got to hear about
your uncle's sermon, and in some drunken fit he broke into the church
and smashed the panel to atoms. He seems to have thought that there
was some magic in it, and that if he destroyed that he would get rid
of the terrible fate that was threatening him. For I must tell you
that before he committed that dreadful sacrilege he had been a
haunted man: he hated and feared darkness, for he thought that the
creature on the panel was on his track, but that as long as he kept
lights burning it could not touch him. But the panel, to his
disordered mind, was the root of his terror, and so, as I said, he
broke into the church and attempted--you will see why I said
'attempted'--to destroy it. It certainly was found in splinters next
morning, when your uncle went into church for matins, and knowing Mr.
Dooliss's fear of the panel, he went across to the quarry-house
afterwards and taxed him with its destruction. The man never denied
it; he boasted of what he had done. There he sat, though it was early
morning, drinking his whisky.</p>

<p>"'I've settled your Thing for you,' he said, 'and your sermon too.
A fig for such superstitions.'</p>

<p>"Your uncle left him without answering his blasphemy, meaning to
go straight into Penzance and give information to the police about
this outrage to the church, but on his way back from the quarry-house
he went into the church again, in order to be able to give details
about the damage, and there in the screen was the panel, untouched
and uninjured. And yet he had himself seen it smashed, and Mr.
Dooliss had confessed that the destruction of it was his work. But
there it was, and whether the power of God had mended it or some
other power, who knows?"</p>

<p>This was Polearn indeed, and it was the spirit of Polearn that
made me accept all Aunt Hester was telling me as attested fact. It
had happened like that. She went on in her quiet voice.</p>

<p>"Your uncle recognised that some power beyond police was at work,
and he did not go to Penzance or give informations about the outrage,
for the evidence of it had vanished." A sudden spate of scepticism
swept over me.</p>

<p>"There must have been some mistake," I said. "It hadn't been
broken..."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, but you have been in London so long," she said.
"Let me, anyhow, tell you the rest of my story. That night, for some
reason, I could not sleep. It was very hot and airless; I dare say
you will think that the sultry conditions accounted for my
wakefulness. Once and again, as I went to the window to see if I
could not admit more air, I could see from it the quarry-house, and I
noticed the first time that I left my bed that it was blazing with
lights. But the second time I saw that it was all in darkness, and as
I wondered at that, I heard a terrible scream, and the moment
afterwards the steps of someone coming at full speed down the road
outside the gate. He yelled as he ran; 'Light, light!' he called out.
'Give me light, or it will catch me!' It was very terrible to hear
that, and I went to rouse my husband, who was sleeping in the
dressing-room across the passage. He wasted no time, but by now the
whole village was aroused by the screams, and when he got down to the
pier he found that all was over. The tide was low, and on the rocks
at its foot was lying the body of Mr. Dooliss. He must have cut some
artery when he fell on those sharp edges of stone, for he had bled to
death, they thought, and though he was a big burly man, his corpse
was but skin and bones. Yet there was no pool of blood round him,
such as you would have expected. Just skin and bones as if every drop
of blood in his body had been sucked out of him!"</p>

<p>She leaned forward.</p>

<p>"You and I, my dear, know what happened," she said, "or at least
can guess. God has His instruments of vengeance on those who bring
wickedness into places that have been holy. Dark and mysterious are
His ways."</p>

<p>Now what I should have thought of such a story if it had been told
me in London I can easily imagine. There was such an obvious
explanation: the man in question had been a drunkard, what wonder if
the demons of delirium pursued him? But here in Polearn it was
different.</p>

<p>"And who is in the quarry-house now?" I asked. "Years ago the
fisher-boys told me the story of the man who first built it and of
his horrible end. And now again it has happened. Surely no one has
ventured to inhabit it once more?"</p>

<p>I saw in her face, even before I asked that question, that
somebody had done so.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is lived in again," said she, "for there is no end to the
blindness...I don't know if you remember him. He was tenant of the
vicarage many years ago."</p>

<p>"John Evans," said I.</p>

<p>"Yes. Such a nice fellow he was too. Your uncle was pleased to get
so good a tenant. And now--" She rose.</p>

<p>"Aunt Hester, you shouldn't leave your sentences unfinished," I
said.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"My dear, that sentence will finish itself," she said. "But what a
time of night! I must go to bed, and you too, or they will think we
have to keep lights burning here through the dark hours."</p>

<p>Before getting into bed I drew my curtains wide and opened all the
windows to the warm tide of the sea air that flowed softly in.
Looking out into the garden I could see in the moonlight the roof of
the shelter, in which for three years I had lived, gleaming with dew.
That, as much as anything, brought back the old days to which I had
now returned, and they seemed of one piece with the present, as if no
gap of more than twenty years sundered them. The two flowed into one,
like globules of mercury uniting into a softly shining globe, of
mysterious lights and reflections.</p>

<p>Then, raising my eyes a little, I saw against the black hill-side
the windows of the quarry-house still alight.</p>

<p>Morning, as is so often the case, brought no shattering of my
illusion. As I began to regain consciousness, I fancied that I was a
boy again waking up in the shelter in the garden, and though, as I
grew more widely awake, I smiled at the impression, that on which it
was based I found to be indeed true. It was sufficient now as then to
be here, to wander again on the cliffs, and hear the popping of the
ripened seed-pods on the gorse-bushes; to stray along the shore to
the bathing-cove, to float and drift and swim in the warm tide, and
bask on the sand, and watch the gulls fishing, to lounge on the
pier-head with the fisher-folk, to see in their eyes and hear in
their quiet speech the evidence of secret things not so much known to
them as part of their instincts and their very being. There were
powers and presences about me; the white poplars that stood by the
stream that babbled down the valley knew of them, and showed a
glimpse of their knowledge sometimes, like the gleam of their white
underleaves; the very cobbles that paved the street were soaked in it
All that I wanted was to lie there and grow soaked in it too;
unconsciously, as a boy, I had done that, but now the process must be
conscious. I must know what stir of forces, fruitful and mysterious,
seethed along the hill-side at noon, and sparkled at night on the
sea. They could be known, they could even be controlled by those who
were masters of the spell, but never could they be spoken of, for
they were dwellers in the innermost, grafted into the eternal life of
the world. There were dark secrets as well as these clear, kindly
powers, and to these no doubt belonged the negotium perambulans in
tenebris which, though of deadly malignity, might be regarded not
only as evil, but as the avenger of sacrilegious and impious deeds...
All this was part of the spell of Polearn, of which the seeds had
long lain dormant in me. But now they were sprouting, and who knew
what strange flower would unfold on their stems?</p>

<p>It was not long before I came across John Evans. One morning, as I
lay on the beach, there came shambling across the sand a man stout
and middle-aged with the face of Silenus. He paused as he drew near
and regarded me from narrow eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, you're the little chap that used to live in the parson's
garden," he said. "Don't you recognise me?"</p>

<p>I saw who it was when he spoke: his voice, I think, instructed me,
and recognising it, I could see the features of the strong, alert
young man in this gross caricature.</p>

<p>"Yes, you're John Evans," I said. "You used to be very kind to me:
you used to draw pictures for me."</p>

<p>"So I did, and I'll draw you some more. Been bathing? That's a
risky performance. You never know what lives in the sea, nor what
lives on the land for that matter. Not that I heed them.</p>

<p>"I stick to work and whisky. God! I've learned to paint since I
saw you, and drink too for that matter. I live in the quarry-house,
you know, and it's a powerful thirsty place. Come and have a look at
my things if you're passing. Staying with your aunt, are you? I could
do a wonderful portrait of her. Interesting face; she knows a lot.
People who live at Polearn get to know a lot, though I don't take
much stock in that sort of knowledge myself."</p>

<p>I do not know when I have been at once so repelled and interested.
Behind the mere grossness of his face there lurked something which,
while it appalled, yet fascinated me. His thick lisping speech had
the same quality. And his paintings, what would they be like?...</p>

<p>"I was just going home," I said. "I'll gladly come in, if you'll
allow me."</p>

<p>He took me through the untended and overgrown garden into the
house which I had never yet entered. A great grey cat was sunning
itself in the window, and an old woman was laying lunch in a corner
of the cool hall into which the door opened. It was built of stone,
and the carved mouldings let into the walls, the fragments of
gargoyles and sculptured images, bore testimony to the truth of its
having been built out of the demolished church. In one corner was an
oblong and carved wooden table littered with a painter's apparatus
and stacks of canvases leaned against the walls.</p>

<p>He jerked his thumb towards a head of an angel that was built into
the mantelpiece and giggled.</p>

<p>"Quite a sanctified air," he said, "so we tone it down for the
purposes of ordinary life by a different sort of art. Have a drink?
No? Well, turn over some of my pictures while I put myself to
rights."</p>

<p>He was justified in his own estimate of his skill: he could paint
(and apparently he could paint anything), but never have I seen
pictures so inexplicably hellish. There were exquisite studies of
trees, and you knew that something lurked in the flickering shadows.
There was a drawing of his cat sunning itself in the window, even as
I had just now seen it, and yet it was no cat but some beast of awful
malignity. There was a boy stretched naked on the sands, not human,
but some evil thing which had come out of the sea. Above all there
were pictures of his garden overgrown and jungle-like, and you knew
that in the bushes were presences ready to spring out on you...</p>

<p>"Well, do you like my style?" he said as he came up, glass in
hand. (The tumbler of spirits that he held had not been diluted.) "I
try to paint the essence of what I see, not the mere husk and skin of
it, but its nature, where it comes from and what gave it birth.
There's much in common between a cat and a fuchsia-bush if you look
at them closely enough. Everything came out of the slime of the pit,
and it's all going back there. I should like to do a picture of you
some day. I'd hold the mirror up to Nature, as that old lunatic
said."</p>

<p>After this first meeting I saw him occasionally throughout the
months of that wonderful summer. Often he kept to his house and to
his painting for days together, and then perhaps some evening I would
find him lounging on the pier, always alone, and every time we met
thus the repulsion and interest grew, for every time he seemed to
have gone farther along a path of secret knowledge towards some evil
shrine where complete initiation awaited him...And then suddenly the
end came.</p>

<p>I had met him thus one evening on the cliffs while the October
sunset still burned in the sky, but over it with amazing rapidity
there spread from the west a great blackness of cloud such as I have
never seen for denseness. The light was sucked from the sky, the dusk
fell in ever thicker layers. He suddenly became conscious of
this.</p>

<p>"I must get back as quick as I can," he said. "It will be dark in
a few minutes, and my servant is out. The lamps will not be lit."</p>

<p>He stepped out with extraordinary briskness for one who shambled
and could scarcely lift his feet, and soon broke out into a stumbling
run. In the gathering darkness I could see that his face was moist
with the dew of some unspoken terror.</p>

<p>"You must come with me," he panted, "for so we shall get the
lights burning the sooner. I cannot do without light."</p>

<p>I had to exert myself to the full to keep up with him, for terror
winged him, and even so I fell behind, so that when I came to the
garden gate, he was already half-way up the path to the house.</p>

<p>I saw him enter, leaving the door wide, and found him fumbling
with matches. But his hand so trembled that he could not transfer the
light to the wick of the lamp..."But what's the hurry about?" I
asked.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes focused themselves on the open door behind me,
and he jumped from his seat beside the table which had once been the
altar of God, with a gasp and a scream.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he cried. "Keep it off!..."</p>

<p>I turned and saw what he had seen. The Thing had entered and now
was swiftly sliding across the floor towards him, like some gigantic
caterpillar. A stale phosphorescent light came from it, for though
the dusk had grown to blackness outside, I could see it quite
distinctly in the awful light of its own presence. From it too there
came an odour of corruption and decay, as from slime that has long
lain below water. It seemed to have no head, but on the front of it
was an orifice of puckered skin which opened and shut and slavered at
the edges. It was hairless, and slug-like in shape and in texture. As
it advanced its fore-part reared itself from the ground, like a snake
about to strike, and it fastened on him...</p>

<p>At that sight, and with the yells of his agony in my ears, the
panic which had struck me relaxed into a hopeless courage, and with
palsied, impotent hands I tried to lay hold of the Thing.</p>

<p>But I could not: though something material was there, it was
impossible to grasp it; my hands sunk in it as in thick mud. It was
like wrestling with a nightmare.</p>

<p>I think that but a few seconds elapsed before all was over. The
screams of the wretched man sank to moans and mutterings as the Thing
fell on him: he panted once or twice and was still. For a moment
longer there came gurglings and sucking noises, and then it slid out
even as it had entered. I lit the lamp which he had fumbled with, and
there on the floor he lay, no more than a rind of skin in loose folds
over projecting bones.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19"></a>The Other Bed</h2>

<p>I had gone out to Switzerland just before Christmas, expecting,
from experience, a month of divinely renovating weather, of skating
all day in brilliant sun, and basking in the hot frost of that
windless atmosphere. Occasionally, as I knew, there might be a
snowfall, which would last perhaps for forty-eight hours at the
outside, and would be succeeded by another ten days of cloudless
perfection, cold even to zero at night, but irradiated all day long
by the unflecked splendour of the sun.</p>

<p>Instead the climatic conditions were horrible. Day after day a
gale screamed through this upland valley that should have been so
windless and serene, bringing with it a tornado of sleet that changed
to snow by night. For ten days there was no abatement of it, and
evening after evening, as I consulted my barometer, feeling sure that
the black finger would show that we were coming to the end of these
abominations, I found that it had sunk a little lower yet, till it
stayed, like a homing pigeon, on the S of storm. I mention these
things in depredation of the story that follows, in order that the
intelligent reader may say at once, if he wishes, that all that
occurred was merely a result of the malaise of nerves and digestion
that perhaps arose from those storm-bound and disturbing conditions.
And now to go back to the beginning again.</p>

<p>I had written to engage a room at the Hotel Beau Site, and had
been agreeably surprised on arrival to find that for the modest sum
of twelve francs a day I was allotted a room on the first floor with
two beds in it. Otherwise the hotel was quite full. Fearing to be
billeted in a twenty-two franc room, by mistake, I instantly
confirmed my arrangements at the bureau. There was no mistake: I had
ordered a twelve-franc room and had been given one. The very civil
clerk hoped that I was satisfied with it, for otherwise there was
nothing vacant. I hastened to say that I was more than satisfied,
fearing the fate of Esau.</p>

<p>I arrived about three in the afternoon of a cloudless and glorious
day, the last of the series. I hurried down to the rink, having had
the prudence to put skates in the forefront of my luggage, and spent
a divine but struggling hour or two, coming up to the hotel about
sunset. I had letters to write, and after ordering tea to be sent up
to my gorgeous apartment, No. 23, on the first floor, I went straight
up there.</p>

<p>The door was ajar and--I feel certain I should not even remember
this now except in the light of what followed--just as I got close to
it, I heard some faint movement inside the room and instinctively
knew that my servant was there unpacking. Next moment I was in the
room myself, and it was empty. The unpacking had been finished, and
everything was neat, orderly, and comfortable. My barometer was on
the table, and I observed with dismay that it had gone down nearly
half an inch. I did not give another thought to the movement I
thought I had heard from outside.</p>

<p>Certainly I had a delightful room for my twelve francs a day.
There were, as I have said, two beds in it, on one of which were
already laid out my dress-clothes, while night-things were disposed
on the other. There were two windows, between which stood a large
washing-stand, with plenty of room on it; a sofa with its back to the
light stood conveniently near the pipes of central heating, there
were a couple of good arm-chairs, a writing table, and, rarest of
luxuries, another table, so that every time one had breakfast it was
not necessary to pile up a drift of books and papers to make room for
the tray. My window looked east, and sunset still flamed on the
western faces of the virgin snows, while above, in spite of the
dejected barometer, the sky was bare of clouds, and a thin slip of
pale crescent moon was swung high among the stars that still burned
dimly in these first moments of their kindling. Tea came up for me
without delay, and, as I ate, I regarded my surroundings with extreme
complacency.</p>

<p>Then, quite suddenly and without cause, I saw that the disposition
of the beds would never do; I could not possibly sleep in the bed
that my servant had chosen for me, and without pause I jumped up,
transferred my dress clothes to the other bed, and put my night
things where they had been. It was done breathlessly almost, and not
till then did I ask myself why I had done it. I found I had not the
slightest idea. I had merely felt that I could not sleep in the other
bed. But having made the change I felt perfectly content.</p>

<p>My letters took me an hour or so to finish, and I had yawned and
blinked considerably over the last one or two, in part from their
inherent dullness, in part from quite natural sleepiness. For I had
been in the train for twenty-four hours, and was fresh to these
bracing airs which so conduce to appetite, activity, and sleep, and
as there was still an hour before I need dress, I lay down on my sofa
with a book for excuse, but the intention to slumber as reason. And
consciousness ceased as if a tap had been turned off.</p>

<p>Then--I dreamed. I dreamed that my servant came very quietly into
the room, to tell me no doubt that it was time to dress. I supposed
there were a few minutes to spare yet, and that he saw I was dozing,
for, instead of rousing me, he moved quietly about the room, setting
things in order. The light appeared to me to be very dim, for I could
not see him with any distinctness, indeed, I only knew it was he
because it could not be any body else. Then he paused by my
washing-stand, which had a shelf for brushes and razors above it, and
I saw him take a razor from its case and begin stropping it; the
light was strongly reflected on the blade of the razor. He tried the
edge once or twice on his thumb-nail, and then to my horror I saw him
trying it on his throat. Instantaneously one of those deafening
dream-crashes awoke me, and I saw the door half open, and my servant
in the very act of coming in. No doubt the opening of the door had
constituted the crash.</p>

<p>I had joined a previously-arrived party of five, all of us old
friends, and accustomed to see each other often; and at dinner, and
afterwards in intervals of bridge, the conversation roamed agreeably
over a variety of topics, rocking-turns and the prospects of weather
(a thing of vast importance in Switzerland, and not a commonplace
subject) and the performances at the opera, and under what
circumstances as revealed in dummy's hand, is it justifiable for a
player to refuse to return his partner's original lead in no trumps.
Then over whisky and soda and the repeated "last cigarette," it
veered back via the Zantzigs to thought transference and the
transference of emotion. Here one of the party, Harry Lambert, put
forward the much discussed explanation of haunted houses based on
this principle. He put it very concisely.</p>

<p>"Everything that happens," he said, "whether it is a step we take,
or a thought that crosses our mind, makes some change in it,
immediate material world. Now the most violent and concentrated
emotion we can imagine is the emotion that leads a man to take so
extreme a step as killing himself or somebody else. I can easily
imagine such a deed so eating into the material scene, the room or
the haunted heath, where it happens, that its mark lasts an enormous
time. The air rings with the cry of the slain and still drips with
his blood. It is not everybody who will perceive it, but sensitives
will. By the way, I am sure that man who waits on us at dinner is a
sensitive."</p>

<p>It was already late, and I rose.</p>

<p>"Let us hurry him to the scene of a crime," I said. "For myself I
shall hurry to the scene of sleep."</p>

<p>Outside the threatening promise of the barometer was already
finding fulfilment, and a cold ugly wind was complaining among the
pines, and hooting round the peaks, and snow had begun to fall. The
night was thickly overcast, and it seemed as if uneasy presences were
going to and fro in the darkness. But there was no use in ill augury,
and certainly if we were to be house-bound for a few days I was lucky
in having so commodious a lodging. I had plenty to occupy myself with
indoors, though I should vastly have preferred to be engaged outside,
and in the immediate present how good it was to lie free in a proper
bed after a cramped night in the train.</p>

<p>I was half-undressed when there came a tap at my door, and the
waiter who had served us at dinner came in carrying a bottle of
whisky. He was a tall young fellow, and though I had not noticed him
at dinner, I saw at once now, as he stood in the glare of the
electric light, what Harry had meant when he said he was sure he was
a sensitive. There is no mistaking that look: it is exhibited in a
peculiar "inlooking" of the eye. Those eyes, one knows, see further
than the surface...</p>

<p>"The bottle of whisky for monsieur," he said putting it down on
the table.</p>

<p>"But I ordered no whisky," said I. He looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Number twenty-three?" he said. Then he glanced at the other
bed.</p>

<p>"Ah, for the other gentleman, without doubt," he said.</p>

<p>"But there is no other gentleman," said I.</p>

<p>"I am alone here."</p>

<p>He took up the bottle again.</p>

<p>"Pardon, monsieur," he said. "There must be a mistake. I am new
here; I only came today."</p>

<p>"But I thought--"</p>

<p>"Yes?" said I.</p>

<p>"I thought that number twenty-three had ordered a bottle of
whisky," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Goodnight, monsieur, and pardon."</p>

<p>I got into bed, extinguished the light, and feeling very sleepy
and heavy with the oppression, no doubt, of the snow that was coming,
expected to fall asleep at once. Instead my mind would not quite go
to roost, but kept sleepily stumbling about among the little events
of the day, as some tired pedestrian in the dark stumbles over stones
instead of lifting his feet. And as I got sleepier it seemed to me
that my mind kept moving in a tiny little circle. At one moment it
drowsily recollected how I had thought I had heard movement inside my
room, at the next it remembered my dream of some figure going
stealthily about and stropping a razor, at a third it wondered why
this Swiss waiter with the eyes of a "sensitive" thought that number
twenty-three had ordered a bottle of whisky. But at the time I made
no guess as to any coherence between these little isolated facts; I
only dwelt on them with drowsy persistence. Then a fourth fact came
to join the sleepy circle, and I wondered why I had felt a repugnance
against using the other bed.</p>

<p>But there was no explanation of this forthcoming, either, and the
outlines of thought grew more blurred and hazy, until I lost
consciousness altogether.</p>

<p>Next morning began the series of awful days, sleet and snow
falling relentlessly with gusts of chilly wind, making any
out-of-door amusement next to impossible. The snow was too soft for
tobogganning, it balled on the skis, and as for the rink it was but a
series of pools of slushy snow.</p>

<p>This in itself, of course, was quite enough to account for any
ordinary depression and heaviness of spirit, but all the time I felt
there was something more than that to which I owed the utter
blackness that hung over those days. I was beset too by fear that at
first was only vague, but which gradually became more definite, until
it resolved itself into a fear of number twenty-three and in
particular a terror of the other bed. I had no notion why or how I
was afraid of it, the thing was perfectly causeless, but the shape
and the outline of it grew slowly clearer, as detail after detail of
ordinary life, each minute and trivial in itself, carved and moulded
this fear, till it became definite. Yet the whole thing was so
causeless and childish that I could speak to no one of it; I could
but assure myself that it was all a figment of nerves disordered by
this unseemly weather.</p>

<p>However, as to the details, there were plenty of them. Once I woke
up from strangling nightmare, unable at first to move, but in a panic
of terror, believing that I was sleeping in the other bed. More than
once, too, awaking before I was called, and getting out of bed to
look at the aspect of the morning, I saw with a sense of dreadful
misgiving that the bed-clothes on the other bed were strangely
disarranged, as if some one had slept there, and smoothed them down
afterwards, but not so well as not to give notice of the occupation.
So one night I laid a trap, so to speak, for the intruder of which
the real object was to calm my own nervousness (for I still told
myself that I was frightened of nothing), and tucked in the sheet
very carefully, laying the pillow on the top of it. But in the
morning it seemed as if my interference had not been to the taste of
the occupant, for there was more impatient disorder than usual in the
bed-clothes, and on the pillow was an indentation, round and rather
deep, such as we may see any morning in our own beds. Yet by day
these things did not frighten me, but it was when I went to bed at
night that I quaked at the thought of further developments.</p>

<p>It happened also from time to time that I wanted something brought
me, or wanted my servant. On three or four of these occasions my bell
was answered by the "Sensitive," as we called him, but the Sensitive,
I noticed, never came into the room. He would open the door a chink
to receive my order and on returning would again open it a chink to
say that my boots, or whatever it was, were at the door. Once I made
him come in, but I saw him cross himself as, with a face of icy
terror, he stepped into the room, and the sight somehow did not
reassure me. Twice also he came up in the evening, when I had not
rung at all, even as he came up the first night, and opened the door
a chink to say that my bottle of whisky was outside. But the poor
fellow was in a state of such bewilderment when I went out and told
him that I had not ordered whisky, that I did not press for an
explanation. He begged my pardon profusely; he thought a bottle of
whisky had been ordered for number twenty-three. It was his mistake,
entirely--I should not be charged for it; it must have been the other
gentleman. Pardon again; he remembered there was no other gentleman,
the other bed was unoccupied.</p>

<p>It was on the night when this happened for the second time that I
definitely began to wish that I too was quite certain that the other
bed was unoccupied. The ten days of snow and sleet were at an end,
and to-night the moon once more, grown from a mere slip to a shining
shield, swung serenely among the stars. But though at dinner everyone
exhibited an extraordinary change of spirit, with the rising of the
barometer and the discharge of this huge snow-fall, the intolerable
gloom which had been mine so long but deepened and blackened. The
fear was to me now like some statue, nearly finished, modelled by the
carving hands of these details, and though it still stood below its
moistened sheet, any moment, I felt, the sheet might be twitched
away, and I be confronted with it. Twice that evening I had started
to go to the bureau, to ask to have a bed made up for me, anywhere,
in the billiard-room or the smoking-room, since the hotel was full,
but the intolerable childishness of the proceeding revolted me. What
was I afraid of? A dream of my own, a mere nightmare? Some fortuitous
disarrangement of bed linen? The fact that a Swiss waiter made
mistakes about bottles of whisky? It was an impossible cowardice.</p>

<p>But equally impossible that night were billiards or bridge, or any
form of diversion. My only salvation seemed to lie in downright hard
work, and soon after dinner I went to my room (in order to make my
first real counter-move against fear) and sat down solidly to several
hours of proof-correcting, a menial and monotonous employment, but
one which is necessary, and engages the entire attention. But first I
looked thoroughly round the room, to reassure myself, and found all
modern and solid; a bright paper of daisies on the wall, a floor
parquetted, the hot-water pipes chuckling to themselves in the
corner, my bed-clothes turned down for the night, the other bed--The
electric light was burning brightly, and there seemed to me to be a
curious stain, as of a shadow, on the lower part of the pillow and
the top of the sheet, definite and suggestive, and for a moment I
stood there again throttled by a nameless terror. Then taking my
courage in my hands I went closer and looked at it. Then I touched
it; the sheet, where the stain or shadow was, seemed damp to the
hand, so also was the pillow. And then I remembered; I had thrown
some wet clothes on the bed before dinner. No doubt that was the
reason. And fortified by this extremely simple dissipation of my
fear, I sat down and began on my proofs. But my fear had been this,
that the stain had not in that first moment looked like the mere
greyness of water-moistened linen.</p>

<p>From below, at first came the sound of music, for they were
dancing to-night, but I grew absorbed in my work, and only recorded
the fact that after a time there was no more music. Steps went along
the passages, and I heard the buzz of conversation on landings, and
the closing of doors till by degrees the silence became noticeable.
The loneliness of night had come.</p>

<p>It was after the silence had become lonely that I made the first
pause in my work, and by the watch on my table saw that it was
already past midnight. But I had little more to do; another half-hour
would see the end of the business, but there were certain notes I had
to make for future reference, and my stock of paper was already
exhausted. However, I had bought some in the village that afternoon,
and it was in the bureau downstairs, where I had left it, when I came
in and had subsequently forgotten to bring it upstairs. It would be
the work of a minute only to get it.</p>

<p>The electric light had brightened considerably during the last
hour, owing no doubt to many burners being put out in the hotel, and
as I left the room I saw again the stain on the pillow and sheet of
the other bed. I had really forgotten all about it for the last hour,
and its presence there came as an unwelcome surprise. Then I
remembered the explanation of it, which had struck me before, and for
purposes of self-reassurement I again touched it. It was still damp,
but--Had I got chilly with my work? For it was warm to the hand.
Warm, and surely rather sticky. It did not seem like the touch of the
water-damp. And at the same moment I knew I was not alone in the
room. There was something there, something silent as yet, and as yet
invisible. But it was there.</p>

<p>Now for the consolation of persons who are inclined to be fearful,
I may say at once that I am in no way brave, but that terror which,
God knows, was real enough, was yet so interesting, that interest
overruled it. I stood for a moment by the other bed, and,
half-consciously only, wiped the hand that had felt the stain, for
the touch of it, though all the time I told myself that it was but
the touch of the melted snow on the coat I had put there, was
unpleasant and unclean. More than that I did not feel, because in the
presence of the unknown and the perhaps awful, the sense of
curiosity, one of the strongest instincts we have, came to the fore.
So, rather eager to get back to my room again, I ran downstairs to
get the packet of paper. There was still a light in the bureau, and
the Sensitive, on night-duty, I suppose, was sitting there dozing. My
entrance did not disturb him, for I had on noiseless felt slippers,
and seeing at once the package I was in search of, I took it, and
left him still unawakened. That was somehow of a fortifying nature.
The Sensitive anyhow could sleep in his hard chair; the occupant of
the unoccupied bed was not calling to him to-night.</p>

<p>I closed my door quietly, as one does at night when the house is
silent, and sat down at once to open my packet of paper and finish my
work. It was wrapped up in an old news-sheet, and struggling with the
last of the string that bound it, certain words caught my eye. Also
the date at the top of the paper caught my eye, a date nearly a year
old, or, to be quite accurate, a date fifty-one weeks old. It was an
American paper and what it recorded was this:</p>

<p>"The body of Mr. Silas R. Hume, who committed suicide last week at
the Hotel Beau Site, Moulin sur Chalons, is to be buried at his house
in Boston, Mass. The inquest held in Switzerland showed that he cut
his throat with a razor, in an attack of delirium tremens induced by
drink. In the cupboard of his room were found three dozen empty
bottles of Scotch whisky..."</p>

<p>So far I had read when without warning the electric light went
out, and I was left in, what seemed for the moment, absolute
darkness. And again I knew I was not alone, and I knew now who it was
who was with me in the room.</p>

<p>Then the absolute paralysis of fear seized me. As if a wind had
blown over my head, I felt the hair of it stir and rise a little. My
eyes also, I suppose, became accustomed to the sudden darkness, for
they could now perceive the shape of the furniture in the room from
the light of the starlit sky outside. They saw more too than the mere
furniture. There was standing by the wash-stand between the two
windows a figure, clothed only in night-garments, and its hands moved
among the objects on the shelf above the basin. Then with two steps
it made a sort of dive for the other bed, which was in shadow. And
then the sweat poured on to my forehead.</p>

<p>Though the other bed stood in shadow I could still see dimly, but
sufficiently, what was there. The shape of a head lay on the pillow,
the shape of an arm lifted its hand to the electric bell that was
close by on the wall, and I fancied I could hear it distantly
ringing. Then a moment later came hurrying feet up the stairs and
along the passage outside, and a quick rapping at my door.</p>

<p>"Monsieur's whisky, monsieur's whisky," said a voice just outside.
"Pardon, monsieur, I brought it as quickly as I could."</p>

<p>The impotent paralysis of cold terror was still on me. Once I
tried to speak and failed, and still the gentle tapping went on at
the door, and the voice telling some one that his whisky was there.
Then at a second attempt, I heard a voice which was mine saying
hoarsely:</p>

<p>"For God's sake come in; I am alone with it."</p>

<p>There was the click of a turned door-handle, and as suddenly as it
had gone out a few seconds before, the electric light came back
again, and the room was in full illumination. I saw a face peer round
the corner of the door, but it was at another face I looked, the face
of a man sallow and shrunken, who lay in the other bed, staring at me
with glazed eyes. He lay high in bed, and his throat was cut from ear
to ear; and the lower part of the pillow was soaked in blood, and the
sheet streamed with it.</p>

<p>Then suddenly that hideous vision vanished, and there was only a
sleepy-eyed waiter looking into the room. But below the sleepiness
terror was awake, and his voice shook when he spoke.</p>

<p>"Monsieur rang?" he asked.</p>

<p>No, monsieur had not rung. But monsieur made himself a couch in
the billiard-room.</p>

<h2><a name="ch20"></a>Outside the Door</h2>

<p>The rest of the small party staying with my friend Geoffrey
Aldwych in the charming old house which he had lately bought at a
little village north of Sheringham on the Norfolk coast had drifted
away soon after dinner to bridge and billiards, and Mrs. Aldwych and
myself had for the time been left alone in the drawing-room, seated
one on each side of a small round table which we had very patiently
and unsuccessfully been trying to turn. But such pressure, psychical
or physical, as we had put upon it, though of the friendliest and
most encouraging nature, had not overcome in the smallest degree the
very slight inertia which so small an object might have been supposed
to possess, and it had remained as fixed as the most constant of the
stars. No tremor even had passed through its slight and spindle-like
legs. In consequence we had, after a really considerable period of
patient endeavour, left it to its wooden repose, and proceeded to
theorise about psychical matters instead, with no stupid table to
contradict in practice all our ideas on the subject.</p>

<p>This I had added with a certain bitterness born of failure, for if
we could not move so insignificant an object, we might as well give
up all idea of moving anything. But hardly were the words out of my
mouth when there came from the abandoned table a single peremptory
rap, loud and rather startling.</p>

<p>"What's that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Only a rap," said she. "I thought something would happen before
long."</p>

<p>"And do you really think that is a spirit rapping?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh dear no. I don't think it has anything whatever to do with
spirits."</p>

<p>"More perhaps with the very dry weather we have been having.
Furniture often cracks like that in the summer."</p>

<p>Now this, in point of fact, was not quite the case. Neither in
summer nor in winter have I ever heard furniture crack as the table
had cracked, for the sound, whatever it was, did not at all resemble
the husky creak of contracting wood. It was a loud sharp crack like
the smart concussion of one hard object with another.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think it had much to do with dry weather either,"
said she, smiling. "I think, if you wish to know, that it was the
direct result of our attempt to turn the table. Does that sound
nonsense?"</p>

<p>"At present, yes," said I, "though I have no doubt that if you
tried you could make it sound sense. There is, I notice, a certain
plausibility about you and your theories--"</p>

<p>"Now you are being merely personal," she observed.</p>

<p>"For the good motive, to goad you into explanations and
enlargements. Please go on."</p>

<p>"Let us stroll outside, then," said she, "and sit in the garden,
if you are sure you prefer my plausibilities to bridge. It is
deliciously warm, and--"</p>

<p>"And the darkness will be more suitable for the propagation of
psychical phenomena. As at s&eacute;ances," said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, there is nothing psychical about my plausibilities," said
she. "The phenomena I mean are purely physical, according to my
theory."</p>

<p>So we wandered out into the transparent half light of
multitudinous stars. The last crimson feather of sunset, which had
hovered long in the West, had been blown away with the breath of the
night wind, and the moon, which would presently rise, had not yet cut
the dim horizon of the sea, which lay very quiet, breathing gently in
its sleep with stir of whispering ripples. Across the dark velvet of
the close-cropped lawn, which stretched seawards from the house, blew
a little breeze full of the savour of salt and the freshness of
night, with, every now and then, a hint so subtly conveyed as to be
scarcely perceptible of its travel across the sleeping fragrance of
drowsy garden-beds, over which the white moths hovered seeking their
night-honey. The house itself, with its two battlemented towers of
Elizabethan times, gleamed with many windows, and we passed out of
sight of it, and into the shadow of a box-hedge, clipped into shapes
and monstrous fantasies, and found chairs by the striped tent at the
top of the sheltered bowling-alley.</p>

<p>"And this is all very plausible," said I. "Theories, if you
please, at length, and, if possible, a full length illustration
also."</p>

<p>"By which you mean a ghost-story, or something to that
effect?"</p>

<p>"Precisely: and, without presuming to dictate, if possible,
firsthand."</p>

<p>"Oddly enough, I can supply that also," said she. "So first I will
tell you my general theory, and follow it by a story that seems to
bear it out. It happened to me, and it happened here."</p>

<p>"I am sure it will fill the bill," said I.</p>

<p>She paused a moment while I lit a cigarette, and then began in her
very clear, pleasant voice.</p>

<p>She has the most lucid voice I know, and to me sitting there in
the deep-dyed dusk, the words seemed the very incarnation of clarity,
for they dropped into the still quiet of the darkness, undisturbed by
impressions conveyed to other senses.</p>

<p>"We are only just beginning to conjecture," she said, "how
inextricable is the interweaving between mind, soul, life--call it
what you will--and the purely material part of the created world.
That such interweaving existed has, of course, been known for
centuries; doctors, for instance, knew that a cheerful optimistic
spirit on the part of their patients conduced towards recovery; that
fear, the mere emotion, had a definite effect on the beat of the
heart, that anger produced chemical changes in the blood, that
anxiety led to indigestion, that under the influence of strong
passion a man can do things which in his normal state he is
physically incapable of performing. Here we have mind, in a simple
and familiar manner, producing changes and effects in tissue, in that
which is purely material. By an extension of this--though, indeed, it
is scarcely an extension--we may expect to find that mind can have an
effect, not only on what we call living tissue, but on dead things,
on pieces of wood or stone. At least it is hard to see why that
should not be so."</p>

<p>"Table-turning, for instance?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That is one instance of how some force, out of that innumerable
cohort of obscure mysterious forces with which we human beings are
garrisoned, can pass, as it is constantly doing, into material
things. The laws of its passing we do not know; sometimes we wish it
to pass and it does not. Just now, for instance, when you and I tried
to turn the table, there was some impediment in the path, though I
put down that rap which followed as an effect of our efforts. But
nothing seems more natural to my mind than that these forces should
be transmissible to inanimate things. Of the manner of its passing we
know next to nothing, any more than we know the manner of the actual
process by which fear accelerates the beating of the heart, but as
surely as a Marconi message leaps along the air by no visible or
tangible bridge, so through some subtle gateway of the body these
forces can march from the citadel of the spirit into material forms,
whether that material is a living part of ourselves or that which we
choose to call inanimate nature." She paused a moment.</p>

<p>"Under certain circumstances," she went on, "it seems that the
force which has passed from us into inanimate things can manifest its
presence there. The force that passes into a table can show itself in
movements or in noises coming from the table. The table has been
charged with physical energy. Often and often I have seen a table or
a chair move apparently of its own accord, but only when some
outpouring of force, animal magnetism--call it what you will--has
been received by it. A parallel phenomenon to my mind is exhibited in
what we know as haunted houses, houses in which, as a rule, some
crime or act of extreme emotion or passion has been committed, and in
which some echo or re-enactment of the deed is periodically made
visible or audible. A murder has been committed, let us say, and the
room where it took place is haunted. The figure of the murdered, or
less commonly of the murderer, is seen there by sensitives, and cries
are heard, or steps run to and fro. The atmosphere has somehow been
charged with the scene, and the scene in whole or part repeats
itself, though under what laws we do not know, just as a phonograph
will repeat, when properly handled, what has been said into it."</p>

<p>"This is all theory," I remarked.</p>

<p>"But it appears to me to cover a curious set of facts, which is
all we ask of a theory.</p>

<p>"Otherwise, we must frankly state our disbelief in haunted houses
altogether, or suppose that the spirit of the murdered, poor, wretch,
is bound under certain circumstances to re-enact the horror of its
body's tragedy. It was not enough that its body was killed there, its
soul has to be dragged back and live through it all again with such
vividness that its anguish becomes visible or audible to the eyes or
ears of the sensitive. That to me is unthinkable, whereas my theory
is not. Do I make it at all clear?"</p>

<p>"It is clear enough," said I, "but I want support for it, the
full-sized illustration."</p>

<p>"I promised you that, a ghost-story of my own experience."</p>

<p>Mrs. Aldwych paused again, and then began the story which was to
illustrate her theory.</p>

<p>"It is just a year," she said, "since Jack bought this house from
old Mrs. Denison. We had both heard, both he and I, that it was
supposed to be haunted, but neither of us knew any particulars of the
haunt whatever. A month ago I heard what I believe to have been the
ghost, and, when Mrs. Denison was staying with us last week, I asked
her exactly what it was, and found it tallied completely with my
experience. I will tell you my experience first, and give her account
of the haunt afterwards.</p>

<p>"A month ago Jack was away for a few days and I remained here
alone. One Sunday evening I, in my usual health and spirits, as far
as I am aware, both of which are serenely excellent, went up to bed
about eleven. My room is on the first floor, just at the foot of the
staircase that leads to the floor above. There are four more rooms on
my passage, all of which that night were empty, and at the far end of
it a door leads into the landing at the top of the front staircase.
On the other side of that, as you know, are more bedrooms, all of
which that night were also unoccupied; I, in fact, was the only
sleeper on the first floor.</p>

<p>"The head of my bed is close behind my door, and there is an
electric light over it. This is controlled by a switch at the
bed-head, and another switch there turns on a light in the passage
just outside my room. That was Jack's plan: if by chance you want to
leave your room when the house is dark, you can light up the passage
before you go out, and not grope blindly for a switch outside.</p>

<p>"Usually I sleep solidly: it is very rarely indeed that I wake,
when once I have gone to sleep, before I am called. But that night I
woke, which was rare; what was rarer was that I woke in a state of
shuddering and unaccountable terror; I tried to localise my panic, to
run it to earth and reason it away, but without any success. Terror
of something I could not guess at stared me in the face, white,
shaking terror. So, as there was no use in lying quaking in the dark,
I lit my lamp, and, with the view of composing this strange disorder
of my fear, began to read again in the book I had brought up with me.
The volume happened to be 'The Green Carnation,' a work one would
have thought to be full of tonic to twittering nerves. But it failed
of success, even as my reasoning had done, and after reading a few
pages, and finding that the heart-hammer in my throat grew no
quieter, and that the grip of terror was in no way relaxed, I put out
my light and lay down again. I looked at my watch, however, before
doing this, and remember that the time was ten minutes to two.</p>

<p>"Still matters did not mend: terror, that was slowly becoming a
little more definite, terror of some dark and violent deed that was
momently drawing nearer to me held me in its vice.</p>

<p>"Something was coming, the advent of which was perceived by the
sub-conscious sense, and was already conveyed to my conscious mind.
And then the clock struck two jingling chimes, and the stable-clock
outside clanged the hour more sonorously.</p>

<p>"I still lay there, abject and palpitating. Then I heard a sound
just outside my room on the stairs that lead, as I have said, to the
second story, a sound which was perfectly commonplace and
unmistakable. Feet feeling their way in the dark were coming
downstairs to my passage: I could hear also the groping hand slip and
slide along the bannisters. The footfalls came along the few yards of
passage between the bottom of the stairs and my door, and then
against my door itself came the brush of drapery, and on the panels
the blind groping of fingers. The handle rattled as they passed over
it, and my terror nearly rose to screaming point.</p>

<p>"Then a sensible hope struck me. The midnight wanderer might be
one of the servants, ill or in want of something, and yet--why the
shuffling feet and the groping hand? But on the instant of the
dawning of that hope (for I knew that it was of the step and that
which was moving in the dark passage of which I was afraid) I turned
on both the light at my bed-head, and the light of the passage
outside, and, opening the door, looked out. The passage was quite
bright from end to end, but it was perfectly empty. Yet as I looked,
seeing nothing of the walker, I still heard. Down the bright boards I
heard the shuffle growing fainter as it receded, until, judging by
the ear, it turned into the gallery at the end and died away. And
with it there died also all my sense of terror. It was It of which I
had been afraid: now It and my terror had passed. And I went back to
bed and slept till morning."</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Aldwych paused, and I was silent. Somehow it was in the
extreme simplicity of her experience that the horror lay. She went on
almost immediately.</p>

<p>"Now for the sequel," she said, "of what I choose to call the
explanation. Mrs. Denison, as I told you, came down to stay with us
not long ago, and I mentioned that we had heard, though only vaguely,
that the house was supposed to be haunted, and asked for an account
of it. This is what she told me:</p>

<p>"'In the year 1610 the heiress to the property was a girl Helen
Denison, who was engaged to be married to young Lord Southern. In
case therefore of her having children, the property would pass away
from Denisons. In case of her death, childless, it would pass to her
first cousin. A week before the marriage took place, he and a brother
of his entered the house, riding here from thirty miles away, after
dark, and made their way to her room on the second story. There they
gagged her and attempted to kill her, but she escaped from them,
groped her way along this passage, and into the room at the end of
the gallery. They followed her there, and killed her. The facts were
known by the younger brother turning king's evidence.'</p>

<p>"Now Mrs. Denison told me that the ghost had never been seen, but
that it was occasionally heard coming downstairs or going along the
passage. She told me that it was never heard except between the hours
of two and three in the morning, the hour during which the murder
took place."</p>

<p>"And since then have you heard it again?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, more than once. But it has never frightened me again. I
feared, as we all do, what was unknown."</p>

<p>"I feel that I should fear the known, if I knew it was that," said
I.</p>

<p>"I don't think you would for long. Whatever theory you adopt about
it, the sounds of the steps and the groping hand, I cannot see that
there is anything to shock or frighten one. My own theory you
know--"</p>

<p>"Please apply it to what you heard," I asked.</p>

<p>"Simply enough. The poor girl felt her way along this passage in
the despair of her agonised terror, hearing no doubt the soft
footsteps of her murderers gaining on her, as she groped along her
lost way. The waves of that terrible brainstorm raging within her,
impressed themselves in some subtle yet physical manner on the place.
It would only be by those people whom we call sensitives that the
wrinkles, so to speak, made by those breaking waves on the sands
would be perceived, and by them not always. But they are there, even
as when a Marconi apparatus is working the waves are there, though
they can only be perceived by a receiver that is in tune. If you
believe in brain-waves at all, the explanation is not so
difficult."</p>

<p>"Then the brain-wave is permanent?"</p>

<p>"Every wave of whatever kind leaves its mark, does it not? If you
disbelieve the whole thing, shall I give you a room on the route of
that poor murdered harmless walker?"</p>

<p>I got up.</p>

<p>"I am very comfortable, thanks, where I am," I said.</p>

<h2><a name="ch21"></a>The Room in the Tower</h2>

<p>It is probable that everybody who is at all a constant dreamer has
had at least one experience of an event or a sequence of
circumstances which have come to his mind in sleep being subsequently
realized in the material world. But, in my opinion, so far from this
being a strange thing, it would be far odder if this fulfilment did
not occasionally happen, since our dreams are, as a rule, concerned
with people whom we know and places with which we are familiar, such
as might very naturally occur in the awake and daylit world. True,
these dreams are often broken into by some absurd and fantastic
incident, which puts them out of court in regard to their subsequent
fulfilment, but on the mere calculation of chances, it does not
appear in the least unlikely that a dream imagined by anyone who
dreams constantly should occasionally come true. Not long ago, for
instance, I experienced such a fulfilment of a dream which seems to
me in no way remarkable and to have no kind of psychical
significance. The manner of it was as follows.</p>

<p>A certain friend of mine, living abroad, is amiable enough to
write to me about once in a fortnight. Thus, when fourteen days or
thereabouts have elapsed since I last heard from him, my mind,
probably, either consciously or subconsciously, is expectant of a
letter from him. One night last week I dreamed that as I was going
upstairs to dress for dinner I heard, as I often heard, the sound of
the postman's knock on my front door, and diverted my direction
downstairs instead. There, among other correspondence, was a letter
from him. Thereafter the fantastic entered, for on opening it I found
inside the ace of diamonds, and scribbled across it in his well-known
handwriting, "I am sending you this for safe custody, as you know it
is running an unreasonable risk to keep aces in Italy." The next
evening I was just preparing to go upstairs to dress when I heard the
postman's knock, and did precisely as I had done in my dream. There,
among other letters, was one from my friend. Only it did not contain
the ace of diamonds. Had it done so, I should have attached more
weight to the matter, which, as it stands, seems to me a perfectly
ordinary coincidence. No doubt I consciously or subconsciously
expected a letter from him, and this suggested to me my dream.
Similarly, the fact that my friend had not written to me for a
fortnight suggested to him that he should do so. But occasionally it
is not so easy to find such an explanation, and for the following
story I can find no explanation at all. It came out of the dark, and
into the dark it has gone again.</p>

<p>All my life I have been a habitual dreamer: the nights are few,
that is to say, when I do not find on awaking in the morning that
some mental experience has been mine, and sometimes, all night long,
apparently, a series of the most dazzling adventures befall me.
Almost without exception these adventures are pleasant, though often
merely trivial. It is of an exception that I am going to speak.</p>

<p>It was when I was about sixteen that a certain dream first came to
me, and this is how it befell. It opened with my being set down at
the door of a big red-brick house, where, I understood, I was going
to stay. The servant who opened the door told me that tea was being
served in the garden, and led me through a low dark-panelled hall,
with a large open fireplace, on to a cheerful green lawn set round
with flower beds. There were grouped about the tea-table a small
party of people, but they were all strangers to me except one, who
was a schoolfellow called Jack Stone, clearly the son of the house,
and he introduced me to his mother and father and a couple of
sisters. I was, I remember, somewhat astonished to find myself here,
for the boy in question was scarcely known to me, and I rather
disliked what I knew of him; moreover, he had left school nearly a
year before. The afternoon was very hot, and an intolerable
oppression reigned. On the far side of the lawn ran a red-brick wall,
with an iron gate in its center, outside which stood a walnut tree.
We sat in the shadow of the house opposite a row of long windows,
inside which I could see a table with cloth laid, glimmering with
glass and silver. This garden front of the house was very long, and
at one end of it stood a tower of three stories, which looked to me
much older than the rest of the building.</p>

<p>Before long, Mrs. Stone, who, like the rest of the party, had sat
in absolute silence, said to me, "Jack will show you your room: I
have given you the room in the tower."</p>

<p>Quite inexplicably my heart sank at her words. I felt as if I had
known that I should have the room in the tower, and that it contained
something dreadful and significant. Jack instantly got up, and I
understood that I had to follow him. In silence we passed through the
hall, and mounted a great oak staircase with many corners, and
arrived at a small landing with two doors set in it. He pushed one of
these open for me to enter, and without coming in himself, closed it
after me. Then I knew that my conjecture had been right: there was
something awful in the room, and with the terror of nightmare growing
swiftly and enveloping me, I awoke in a spasm of terror.</p>

<p>Now that dream or variations on it occurred to me intermittently
for fifteen years. Most often it came in exactly this form, the
arrival, the tea laid out on the lawn, the deadly silence succeeded
by that one deadly sentence, the mounting with Jack Stone up to the
room in the tower where horror dwelt, and it always came to a close
in the nightmare of terror at that which was in the room, though I
never saw what it was. At other times I experienced variations on
this same theme. Occasionally, for instance, we would be sitting at
dinner in the dining-room, into the windows of which I had looked on
the first night when the dream of this house visited me, but wherever
we were, there was the same silence, the same sense of dreadful
oppression and foreboding. And the silence I knew would always be
broken by Mrs. Stone saying to me, "Jack will show you your room: I
have given you the room in the tower." Upon which (this was
invariable) I had to follow him up the oak staircase with many
corners, and enter the place that I dreaded more and more each time
that I visited it in sleep. Or, again, I would find myself playing
cards still in silence in a drawing-room lit with immense
chandeliers, that gave a blinding illumination. What the game was I
have no idea; what I remember, with a sense of miserable
anticipation, was that soon Mrs. Stone would get up and say to me,
"Jack will show you your room: I have given you the room in the
tower." This drawing-room where we played cards was next to the
dining-room, and, as I have said, was always brilliantly illuminated,
whereas the rest of the house was full of dusk and shadows. And yet,
how often, in spite of those bouquets of lights, have I not pored
over the cards that were dealt me, scarcely able for some reason to
see them. Their designs, too, were strange: there were no red suits,
but all were black, and among them there were certain cards which
were black all over. I hated and dreaded those.</p>

<p>As this dream continued to recur, I got to know the greater part
of the house. There was a smoking-room beyond the drawing-room, at
the end of a passage with a green baize door. It was always very dark
there, and as often as I went there I passed somebody whom I could
not see in the doorway coming out. Curious developments, too, took
place in the characters that peopled the dream as might happen to
living persons. Mrs. Stone, for instance, who, when I first saw her,
had been black-haired, became gray, and instead of rising briskly, as
she had done at first when she said, "Jack will show you your room: I
have given you the room in the tower," got up very feebly, as if the
strength was leaving her limbs. Jack also grew up, and became a
rather ill-looking young man, with a brown moustache, while one of
the sisters ceased to appear, and I understood she was married.</p>

<p>Then it so happened that I was not visited by this dream for six
months or more, and I began to hope, in such inexplicable dread did I
hold it, that it had passed away for good. But one night after this
interval I again found myself being shown out onto the lawn for tea,
and Mrs. Stone was not there, while the others were all dressed in
black. At once I guessed the reason, and my heart leaped at the
thought that perhaps this time I should not have to sleep in the room
in the tower, and though we usually all sat in silence, on this
occasion the sense of relief made me talk and laugh as I had never
yet done. But even then matters were not altogether comfortable, for
no one else spoke, but they all looked secretly at each other. And
soon the foolish stream of my talk ran dry, and gradually an
apprehension worse than anything I had previously known gained on me
as the light slowly faded.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice which I knew well broke the stillness, the voice
of Mrs. Stone, saying, "Jack will show you your room: I have given
you the room in the tower." It seemed to come from near the gate in
the red-brick wall that bounded the lawn, and looking up, I saw that
the grass outside was sown thick with gravestones. A curious greyish
light shone from them, and I could read the lettering on the grave
nearest me, and it was, "In evil memory of Julia Stone." And as usual
Jack got up, and again I followed him through the hall and up the
staircase with many corners. On this occasion it was darker than
usual, and when I passed into the room in the tower I could only just
see the furniture, the position of which was already familiar to me.
Also there was a dreadful odor of decay in the room, and I woke
screaming.</p>

<p>The dream, with such variations and developments as I have
mentioned, went on at intervals for fifteen years. Sometimes I would
dream it two or three nights in succession; once, as I have said,
there was an intermission of six months, but taking a reasonable
average, I should say that I dreamed it quite as often as once in a
month. It had, as is plain, something of nightmare about it, since it
always ended in the same appalling terror, which so far from getting
less, seemed to me to gather fresh fear every time that I experienced
it. There was, too, a strange and dreadful consistency about it. The
characters in it, as I have mentioned, got regularly older, death and
marriage visited this silent family, and I never in the dream, after
Mrs. Stone had died, set eyes on her again. But it was always her
voice that told me that the room in the tower was prepared for me,
and whether we had tea out on the lawn, or the scene was laid in one
of the rooms overlooking it, I could always see her gravestone
standing just outside the iron gate. It was the same, too, with the
married daughter; usually she was not present, but once or twice she
returned again, in company with a man, whom I took to be her husband.
He, too, like the rest of them, was always silent. But, owing to the
constant repetition of the dream, I had ceased to attach, in my
waking hours, any significance to it. I never met Jack Stone again
during all those years, nor did I ever see a house that resembled
this dark house of my dream. And then something happened.</p>

<p>I had been in London in this year, up till the end of the July,
and during the first week in August went down to stay with a friend
in a house he had taken for the summer months, in the Ashdown Forest
district of Sussex. I left London early, for John Clinton was to meet
me at Forest Row Station, and we were going to spend the day golfing,
and go to his house in the evening. He had his motor with him, and we
set off, about five of the afternoon, after a thoroughly delightful
day, for the drive, the distance being some ten miles. As it was
still so early we did not have tea at the club house, but waited till
we should get home. As we drove, the weather, which up till then had
been, though hot, deliciously fresh, seemed to me to alter in
quality, and become very stagnant and oppressive, and I felt that
indefinable sense of ominous apprehension that I am accustomed to
before thunder. John, however, did not share my views, attributing my
loss of lightness to the fact that I had lost both my matches. Events
proved, however, that I was right, though I do not think that the
thunderstorm that broke that night was the sole cause of my
depression.</p>

<p>Our way lay through deep high-banked lanes, and before we had gone
very far I fell asleep, and was only awakened by the stopping of the
motor. And with a sudden thrill, partly of fear but chiefly of
curiosity, I found myself standing in the doorway of my house of
dream. We went, I half wondering whether or not I was dreaming still,
through a low oak-panelled hall, and out onto the lawn, where tea was
laid in the shadow of the house. It was set in flower beds, a
red-brick wall, with a gate in it, bounded one side, and out beyond
that was a space of rough grass with a walnut tree. The facade of the
house was very long, and at one end stood a three-storied tower,
markedly older than the rest.</p>

<p>Here for the moment all resemblance to the repeated dream ceased.
There was no silent and somehow terrible family, but a large assembly
of exceedingly cheerful persons, all of whom were known to me. And in
spite of the horror with which the dream itself had always filled me,
I felt nothing of it now that the scene of it was thus reproduced
before me. But I felt intensest curiosity as to what was going to
happen.</p>

<p>Tea pursued its cheerful course, and before long Mrs. Clinton got
up. And at that moment I think I knew what she was going to say. She
spoke to me, and what she said was:</p>

<p>"Jack will show you your room: I have given you the room in the
tower."</p>

<p>At that, for half a second, the horror of the dream took hold of
me again. But it quickly passed, and again I felt nothing more than
the most intense curiosity. It was not very long before it was amply
satisfied.</p>

<p>John turned to me.</p>

<p>"Right up at the top of the house," he said, "but I think you'll
be comfortable. We're absolutely full up. Would you like to go and
see it now? By Jove, I believe that you are right, and that we are
going to have a thunderstorm. How dark it has become."</p>

<p>I got up and followed him. We passed through the hall, and up the
perfectly familiar staircase. Then he opened the door, and I went in.
And at that moment sheer unreasoning terror again possessed me. I did
not know what I feared: I simply feared. Then like a sudden
recollection, when one remembers a name which has long escaped the
memory, I knew what I feared. I feared Mrs. Stone, whose grave with
the sinister inscription, "In evil memory," I had so often seen in my
dream, just beyond the lawn which lay below my window. And then once
more the fear passed so completely that I wondered what there was to
fear, and I found myself, sober and quiet and sane, in the room in
the tower, the name of which I had so often heard in my dream, and
the scene of which was so familiar.</p>

<p>I looked around it with a certain sense of proprietorship, and
found that nothing had been changed from the dreaming nights in which
I knew it so well. Just to the left of the door was the bed,
lengthways along the wall, with the head of it in the angle. In a
line with it was the fireplace and a small bookcase; opposite the
door the outer wall was pierced by two lattice-paned windows, between
which stood the dressing-table, while ranged along the fourth wall
was the washing-stand and a big cupboard. My luggage had already been
unpacked, for the furniture of dressing and undressing lay orderly on
the wash-stand and toilet-table, while my dinner clothes were spread
out on the coverlet of the bed. And then, with a sudden start of
unexplained dismay, I saw that there were two rather conspicuous
objects which I had not seen before in my dreams: one a life-sized
oil painting of Mrs. Stone, the other a black-and-white sketch of
Jack Stone, representing him as he had appeared to me only a week
before in the last of the series of these repeated dreams, a rather
secret and evil-looking man of about thirty. His picture hung between
the windows, looking straight across the room to the other portrait,
which hung at the side of the bed. At that I looked next, and as I
looked I felt once more the horror of nightmare seize me.</p>

<p>It represented Mrs. Stone as I had seen her last in my dreams: old
and withered and white-haired. But in spite of the evident feebleness
of body, a dreadful exuberance and vitality shone through the
envelope of flesh, an exuberance wholly malign, a vitality that
foamed and frothed with unimaginable evil. Evil beamed from the
narrow, leering eyes; it laughed in the demon-like mouth. The whole
face was instinct with some secret and appalling mirth; the hands,
clasped together on the knee, seemed shaking with suppressed and
nameless glee. Then I saw also that it was signed in the left-hand
bottom corner, and wondering who the artist could be, I looked more
closely, and read the inscription, "Julia Stone by Julia Stone."</p>

<p>There came a tap at the door, and John Clinton entered.</p>

<p>"Got everything you want?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Rather more than I want," said I, pointing to the picture.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Hard-featured old lady," he said. "By herself, too, I remember.
Anyhow she can't have flattered herself much."</p>

<p>"But don't you see?" said I. "It's scarcely a human face at all.
It's the face of some witch, of some devil."</p>

<p>He looked at it more closely.</p>

<p>"Yes; it isn't very pleasant," he said. "Scarcely a bedside
manner, eh? Yes; I can imagine getting the nightmare if I went to
sleep with that close by my bed. I'll have it taken down if you
like."</p>

<p>"I really wish you would," I said. He rang the bell, and with the
help of a servant we detached the picture and carried it out onto the
landing, and put it with its face to the wall.</p>

<p>"By Jove, the old lady is a weight," said John, mopping his
forehead. "I wonder if she had something on her mind."</p>

<p>The extraordinary weight of the picture had struck me too. I was
about to reply, when I caught sight of my own hand. There was blood
on it, in considerable quantities, covering the whole palm.</p>

<p>"I've cut myself somehow," said I.</p>

<p>John gave a little startled exclamation.</p>

<p>"Why, I have too," he said.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the footman took out his handkerchief and wiped his
hand with it. I saw that there was blood also on his
handkerchief.</p>

<p>John and I went back into the tower room and washed the blood off;
but neither on his hand nor on mine was there the slightest trace of
a scratch or cut. It seemed to me that, having ascertained this, we
both, by a sort of tacit consent, did not allude to it again.
Something in my case had dimly occurred to me that I did not wish to
think about. It was but a conjecture, but I fancied that I knew the
same thing had occurred to him.</p>

<p>The heat and oppression of the air, for the storm we had expected
was still undischarged, increased very much after dinner, and for
some time most of the party, among whom were John Clinton and myself,
sat outside on the path bounding the lawn, where we had had tea. The
night was absolutely dark, and no twinkle of star or moon ray could
penetrate the pall of cloud that overset the sky. By degrees our
assembly thinned, the women went up to bed, men dispersed to the
smoking or billiard room, and by eleven o'clock my host and I were
the only two left. All the evening I thought that he had something on
his mind, and as soon as we were alone he spoke.</p>

<p>"The man who helped us with the picture had blood on his hand,
too, did you notice?" he said.</p>

<p>"I asked him just now if he had cut himself, and he said he
supposed he had, but that he could find no mark of it. Now where did
that blood come from?"</p>

<p>By dint of telling myself that I was not going to think about it,
I had succeeded in not doing so, and I did not want, especially just
at bedtime, to be reminded of it.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said I, "and I don't really care so long as the
picture of Mrs. Stone is not by my bed."</p>

<p>He got up.</p>

<p>"But it's odd," he said. "Ha! Now you'll see another odd
thing."</p>

<p>A dog of his, an Irish terrier by breed, had come out of the house
as we talked. The door behind us into the hall was open, and a bright
oblong of light shone across the lawn to the iron gate which led on
to the rough grass outside, where the walnut tree stood. I saw that
the dog had all his hackles up, bristling with rage and fright; his
lips were curled back from his teeth, as if he was ready to spring at
something, and he was growling to himself. He took not the slightest
notice of his master or me, but stiffly and tensely walked across the
grass to the iron gate. There he stood for a moment, looking through
the bars and still growling. Then of a sudden his courage seemed to
desert him: he gave one long howl, and scuttled back to the house
with a curious crouching sort of movement.</p>

<p>"He does that half-a-dozen times a day." said John. "He sees
something which he both hates and fears."</p>

<p>I walked to the gate and looked over it. Something was moving on
the grass outside, and soon a sound which I could not instantly
identify came to my ears. Then I remembered what it was: it was the
purring of a cat. I lit a match, and saw the purrer, a big blue
Persian, walking round and round in a little circle just outside the
gate, stepping high and ecstatically, with tail carried aloft like a
banner. Its eyes were bright and shining, and every now and then it
put its head down and sniffed at the grass.</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"The end of that mystery, I am afraid." I said. "Here's a large
cat having Walpurgis night all alone."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's Darius," said John. "He spends half the day and all
night there. But that's not the end of the dog mystery, for Toby and
he are the best of friends, but the beginning of the cat mystery.
What's the cat doing there? And why is Darius pleased, while Toby is
terror-stricken?"</p>

<p>At that moment I remembered the rather horrible detail of my
dreams when I saw through the gate, just where the cat was now, the
white tombstone with the sinister inscription. But before I could
answer the rain began, as suddenly and heavily as if a tap had been
turned on, and simultaneously the big cat squeezed through the bars
of the gate, and came leaping across the lawn to the house for
shelter. Then it sat in the doorway, looking out eagerly into the
dark. It spat and struck at John with its paw, as he pushed it in, in
order to close the door.</p>

<p>Somehow, with the portrait of Julia Stone in the passage outside,
the room in the tower had absolutely no alarm for me, and as I went
to bed, feeling very sleepy and heavy, I had nothing more than
interest for the curious incident about our bleeding hands, and the
conduct of the cat and dog. The last thing I looked at before I put
out my light was the square empty space by my bed where the portrait
had been. Here the paper was of its original full tint of dark red:
over the rest of the walls it had faded. Then I blew out my candle
and instantly fell asleep.</p>

<p>My awaking was equally instantaneous, and I sat bolt upright in
bed under the impression that some bright light had been flashed in
my face, though it was now absolutely pitch dark. I knew exactly
where I was, in the room which I had dreaded in dreams, but no horror
that I ever felt when asleep approached the fear that now invaded and
froze my brain. Immediately after a peal of thunder crackled just
above the house, but the probability that it was only a flash of
lightning which awoke me gave no reassurance to my galloping heart.
Something I knew was in the room with me, and instinctively I put out
my right hand, which was nearest the wall, to keep it away. And my
hand touched the edge of a picture-frame hanging close to me.</p>

<p>I sprang out of bed, upsetting the small table that stood by it,
and I heard my watch, candle, and matches clatter onto the floor. But
for the moment there was no need of light, for a blinding flash
leaped out of the clouds, and showed me that by my bed again hung the
picture of Mrs. Stone. And instantly the room went into blackness
again. But in that flash I saw another thing also, namely a figure
that leaned over the end of my bed, watching me. It was dressed in
some close-clinging white garment, spotted and stained with mold, and
the face was that of the portrait.</p>

<p>Overhead the thunder cracked and roared, and when it ceased and
the deathly stillness succeeded, I heard the rustle of movement
coming nearer me, and, more horrible yet, perceived an odor of
corruption and decay. And then a hand was laid on the side of my
neck, and close beside my ear I heard quick-taken, eager breathing.
Yet I knew that this thing, though it could be perceived by touch, by
smell, by eye and by ear, was still not of this earth, but something
that had passed out of the body and had power to make itself
manifest. Then a voice, already familiar to me, spoke.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come to the room in the tower," it said. "I have
been long waiting for you. At last you have come. Tonight I shall
feast; before long we will feast together."</p>

<p>And the quick breathing came closer to me; I could feel it on my
neck.</p>

<p>At that the terror, which I think had paralyzed me for the moment,
gave way to the wild instinct of self-preservation. I hit wildly with
both arms, kicking out at the same moment, and heard a little
animal-squeal, and something soft dropped with a thud beside me. I
took a couple of steps forward, nearly tripping up over whatever it
was that lay there, and by the merest good-luck found the handle of
the door. In another second I ran out on the landing, and had banged
the door behind me. Almost at the same moment I heard a door open
somewhere below, and John Clinton, candle in hand, came running
upstairs.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he said. "I sleep just below you, and heard a noise
as if--Good heavens, there's blood on your shoulder."</p>

<p>I stood there, so he told me afterwards, swaying from side to
side, white as a sheet, with the mark on my shoulder as if a hand
covered with blood had been laid there.</p>

<p>"It's in there," I said, pointing. "She, you know. The portrait is
in there, too, hanging up on the place we took it from."</p>

<p>At that he laughed.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, this is mere nightmare," he said.</p>

<p>He pushed by me, and opened the door, I standing there simply
inert with terror, unable to stop him, unable to move.</p>

<p>"Phew! What an awful smell," he said.</p>

<p>Then there was silence; he had passed out of my sight behind the
open door. Next moment he came out again, as white as myself, and
instantly shut it.</p>

<p>"Yes, the portrait's there," he said, "and on the floor is a
thing--a thing spotted with earth, like what they bury people in.
Come away, quick, come away."</p>

<p>How I got downstairs I hardly know. An awful shuddering and nausea
of the spirit rather than of the flesh had seized me, and more than
once he had to place my feet upon the steps, while every now and then
he cast glances of terror and apprehension up the stairs. But in time
we came to his dressing-room on the floor below, and there I told him
what I have here described.</p>

<p>The sequel can be made short; indeed, some of my readers have
perhaps already guessed what it was, if they remember that
inexplicable affair of the churchyard at West Fawley, some eight
years ago, where an attempt was made three times to bury the body of
a certain woman who had committed suicide. On each occasion the
coffin was found in the course of a few days again protruding from
the ground. After the third attempt, in order that the thing should
not be talked about, the body was buried elsewhere in unconsecrated
ground. Where it was buried was just outside the iron gate of the
garden belonging to the house where this woman had lived. She had
committed suicide in a room at the top of the tower in that house.
Her name was Julia Stone.</p>

<p>Subsequently the body was again secretly dug up, and the coffin
was found to be full of blood.</p>

<h2><a name="ch22"></a>The Shootings Of Achnaleish</h2>

<p>The dining-room windows, both front and back, the one looking into
Oakley Street, the other into a small back-yard with three sooty
shrubs in it (known as the garden), were all open, so that the table
stood in mid-stream of such air as there was. But in spite of this
the heat was stifling, since, for once in a way, July had remembered
that it was the duty of good little summers to be hot. Hot in
consequence it had been: heat reverberated from the house-walls, it
rose through the boot from the paving-stones, it poured down from a
large superheated sun that walked the sky all day long in a benignant
and golden manner. Dinner was over, but the small party of four who
had eaten it still lingered.</p>

<p>Mabel Armytage--it was she who had laid down the duty of good
little summers--spoke first.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jim, it sounds too heavenly," she said. "It makes me feel
cool to think of it. Just fancy, in a fortnight's time we shall all
four of us be there, in our own shooting-lodge--"</p>

<p>"Farm-house," said Jim.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't suppose it was Balmoral, with our own
coffee-coloured salmon river roaring down to join the waters of our
own loch."</p>

<p>Jim lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Mabel, you mustn't think of shooting-lodges and salmon rivers and
lochs," he said. "It's a farm-house, rather a big one, though I'm
sure we shall find it hard enough to fit in. The salmon river you
speak of is a big burn, no more, though it appears that salmon have
been caught there."</p>

<p>"But when I saw it, it would have required as much cleverness on
the part of a salmon to fit into it as it will require on our parts
to fit into our farm-house. And the loch is a tarn."</p>

<p>Mabel snatched the "Guide to Highland Shootings" out of my hand
with a rudeness that even a sister should not show her elder brother,
and pointed a withering finger at her husband.</p>

<p>"'Achnaleish,'" she declaimed, "'is situated in one of the
grandest and most remote parts of Sutherlandshire. To be let from
August 12 till the end of October, the lodge with shooting and
fishing belonging. Proprietor supplies two keepers, fishing-gillie,
boat on loch, and dogs. Tenant should secure about 500 head of
grouse, and 500 head of mixed game, including partridge, black-game,
woodcock, snipe, roe deer; also rabbits in very large number,
especially by ferreting. Large baskets of brown trout can be taken
from the loch, and whenever the water is high sea-trout and
occasional salmon. Lodge contains'--I can't go on; it's too hot, and
you know the rest. Rent only &pound;350!"</p>

<p>Jim listened patiently.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said. "What then?"</p>

<p>Mabel rose with dignity.</p>

<p>"It is a shooting-lodge with a salmon river and a loch, just as I
have said. Come, Madge, let's go out. It is too hot to sit in the
house."</p>

<p>"You'll be calling Buxton 'the major-domo' next," remarked Jim, as
his wife passed him.</p>

<p>I had picked up the "Guide to Highland Shootings" again which my
sister had so unceremoniously plucked from me, and idly compared the
rent and attractions of Achnaleish with other places that were to
let.</p>

<p>"Seems cheap, too," I said. "Why, here's another place, just the
same sort of size and bag, for which they ask &pound;500; here's
another at &pound;550."</p>

<p>Jim helped himself to coffee.</p>

<p>"Yes, it does seem cheap," he said. "But, of course, it's very
remote; it took me a good three hours from Lairg, and I don't suppose
I was driving very noticeably below the legal limit. But it's cheap,
as you say."</p>

<p>Now, Madge (who is my wife) has her prejudices. One of them--an
extremely expensive one--is that anything cheap has always some
hidden and subtle drawback, which you discover when it is too late.
And the drawback to cheap houses is drains or offices--the presence,
so to speak, of the former, and the absence of the latter. So I
hazarded these.</p>

<p>"No, the drains are all right," said Jim, "because I got the
certificate of the inspector, and as for offices, really I think the
servants' parts are better than ours. No--why it's so cheap, I can't
imagine."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the bag is overstated," I suggested.</p>

<p>Jim again shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, that's the funny thing about it," he said. "The bag, I am
sure, is understated. At least, I walked over the moor for a couple
of hours, and the whole place is simply crawling with hares. Why,
you could shoot five hundred hares alone on it."</p>

<p>"Hares?" I asked. "That's rather queer, so far up, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Jim laughed.</p>

<p>"So I thought. And the hares are queer, too; big beasts, very dark
in colour. Let's join the others outside. Jove! what a hot
night!"</p>

<p>Even as Mabel had said, that day fortnight found us all four, the
four who had stifled and sweltered in Chelsea, flying through the
cool and invigorating winds of the North. The road was in admirable
condition, and I should not wonder if for the second time Jim's big
Napier went not noticeably below the legal limit. The servants had
gone straight up, starting the same day as we, while we had got out
at Perth, motored to Inverness, and were now, on the second day,
nearing our goal. Never have I seen so depopulated a road. I do not
suppose there was a man to a mile of it.</p>

<p>We had left Lairg about five that afternoon expecting to arrive at
Achnaleish by eight, but one disaster after another overtook us. Now
it was the engine, and now a tyre that delayed us, till finally we
stopped some eight miles short of our destination, to light up, for
with evening had come a huge wrack of cloud out of the West, so that
we were cheated of the clear post-sunset twilight of the North. Then
on again, till, with a little dancing of the car over a bridge, Jim
said:</p>

<p>"That's the bridge of our salmon river; so look out for the
turning up to the lodge. It is to the right, and only a narrow track.
You can send her along, Sefton," he called to the chauffeur; "we
shan't meet a soul."</p>

<p>I was sitting in front, finding the speed and the darkness
extraordinarily exhilarating. A bright circle of light was cast by
our lamps, fading into darkness in front, while at the sides, cut off
by the casing of the lamps, the transition into blackness was sharp
and sudden. Every now and then, across this circle of illumination
some wild thing would pass: now a bird, with hurried flutter of wings
when it saw the speed of the luminous monster, would just save itself
from being knocked over; now a rabbit feeding by the side of the road
would dash on to it and then bounce back again; but more frequently
it would be a hare that sprang up from its feeding and raced in front
of us. They seemed dazed and scared by the light, unable to wheel
into the darkness again, until time and again I thought we must run
over one, so narrowly, in giving a sort of desperate sideways leap,
did it miss our wheels. Then it seemed that one started up almost
from under us, and I saw, to my surprise, it was enormous in size,
and in colour apparently quite black. For some hundred yards it raced
in front of us, fascinated by the bright light pursuing it, then,
like the rest, it dashed for the darkness. But it was too late, and
with a horrid jolt we ran over it. At once Sefton slowed down and
stopped, for Jim's rule is to go back always and make sure that any
poor run-over is dead. So, when we stopped, the chauffeur jumped down
and ran back.</p>

<p>"What was it?" Jim asked me, as we waited. "A hare."</p>

<p>Sefton came running back.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, quite dead," he said. "I picked it up, sir."</p>

<p>"What for!"</p>

<p>"Thought you might like to see it, sir. It's the biggest hare I
ever see, and it's quite black."</p>

<p>It was immediately after this that we came to the track up to the
house, and in a few minutes we were within doors. There we found that
if "shooting-lodge" was a term unsuitable, so also was "farm-house,"
so roomy, excellently proportioned, and well furnished was our
dwelling, while the contentment that beamed from Buxton's face was
sufficient testimonial for the offices.</p>

<p>In the hall, too, with its big open fireplace, were a couple of
big solemn bookcases, full of serious works, such as some educated
minister might have left, and, coming down dressed for dinner before
the others, I dipped into the shelves. Then--something must long have
been vaguely simmering in my brain, for I pounced on the book as soon
as I saw it--I came upon Elwes's "Folklore of the North-West
Highlands," and looked out "Hare" in the index. Then I read:</p>

<p>"Nor is it only witches that are believed to have the power of
changing themselves into animals...Men and women on whom no
suspicion of the sort lies are thought to be able to do this, and to
don the bodies of certain animals, notably hares...Such, according
to local superstition, are easily distinguishable by their size and
colour, which approaches jet black."</p>

<p>I was up and out early next morning, prey to the vivid desire that
attacks many folk in new places--namely, to look on the fresh country
and the new horizons--and, on going out, certainly the surprise was
great. For I had imagined an utterly lonely and solitary habitation;
instead, scarce half a mile away, down the steep brae-side at the top
of which stood our commodious farmhouse, ran a typically Scotch
village street, the hamlet no doubt of Achnaleish.</p>

<p>So steep was this hill-side that the village was really remote; if
it was half a mile away in crow-flying measurement, it must have been
a couple of hundred yards below us. But its existence was the odd
thing to me: there were some four dozen houses, at the least, while
we had not seen half that number since leaving Lairg. A mile away,
perhaps, lay the shining shield of the western sea; to the other
side, away from the village, I had no difficulty in recognising the
river and the loch.</p>

<p>The house, in fact, was set on a hog's back; from all sides it
must needs be climbed to. But, as is the custom of the Scots, no
house, however small, should be without its due brightness of
flowers, and the walls of this were purple with clematis and orange
with trop&aelig;olum. It all looked very placid and serene and
home-like.</p>

<p>I continued my tour of exploration, and came back rather late for
breakfast. A slight check in the day's arrangements had occurred, for
the head keeper, Maclaren, had not come up, and the second, Sandie
Ross, reported that the reason for this had been the sudden death of
his mother the evening before. She was not known to be ill, but just
as she was going to bed she had thrown up her arms, screamed suddenly
as if with fright, and was found to be dead. Sandie, who repeated
this news to me after breakfast, was just a slow, polite Scotchman,
rather shy, rather awkward. Just as he finished--we were standing
about outside the back-door--there came up from the stables the
smart, very English-looking Sefton. In one hand he carried the black
hare.</p>

<p>He touched his hat to me as he went in.</p>

<p>"Just to show it to Mr. Armytage, sir," he said. "She's as black
as a boot."</p>

<p>He turned into the door, but not before Sandie Ross had seen what
he carried, and the slow, polite Scotchman was instantly turned into
some furtive, frightened-looking man.</p>

<p>"And where might it be that you found that, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>Now, the black-hare superstition had already begun to intrigue
me.</p>

<p>"Why does that interest you?" I asked.</p>

<p>The slow Scotch look was resumed with an effort.</p>

<p>"It'll no interest me," he said. "I just asked. There are unco
many black hares in Achnaleish."</p>

<p>Then his curiosity got the better of him.</p>

<p>"She'd have been nigh to where the road passes by and on to
Achnaleish?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The hare? Yes, we found her on the road there."</p>

<p>Sandie turned away.</p>

<p>"She aye sat there," he said.</p>

<p>There were a number of little plantations climbing up the steep
hill-side from Achnaleish to the moor above, and we had a pleasant
slack sort of morning shooting there, walking through and round them
with a nondescript tribe of beaters, among whom the serious Buxton
figured. We had fair enough sport, but of the hares which Jim had
seen in such profusion none that morning came to the gun, till at
last, just before lunch, there came out of the apex of one of these
plantations, some thirty yards from where Jim was standing, a very
large, dark-coloured hare. For one moment I saw him hesitate--for he
holds the correct view about long or doubtful shots at hares--then
he put up his gun to fire. Sandie, who had walked round outside,
after giving the beaters their instructions, was at this moment close
to him, and with incredible quickness rushed upon him and with his
stick struck up the barrels of the gun before he could fire.</p>

<p>"Black hare!" he cried. "Ye'd shoot a black hare? There's no
shooting of hares at all in Achnaleish, and mark that."</p>

<p>Never have I seen so sudden and extraordinary a change in a man's
face: it was as if he had just prevented some blackguard of the
street from murdering his wife.</p>

<p>"An' the sickness about an' all," he added indignantly. "When the
puir folk escape from their peching fevered bodies an hour or two, to
the caller muirs."</p>

<p>Then he seemed to recover himself.</p>

<p>"I ask your pardon, sir," he said to Jim. "I was upset with ane
thing an' anither, an' the black hare ye found deid last night--eh,
I'm blatherin' again. But there's no a hare shot on Achnaleish,
that's sure."</p>

<p>Jim was still looking in mere speechless astonishment at Sandie
when I came up. And, though shooting is dear to me, so too is
folk-lore.</p>

<p>"But we've taken the shooting of Achnaleish, Sandie," I said.
"There was nothing there about not shooting hares."</p>

<p>Sandie suddenly boiled up again for a minute.</p>

<p>"An' mebbe there was nothing there about shooting the bairns and
the weemen!" he cried.</p>

<p>I looked round, and saw that by now the beaters had all come
through the wood: of them Buxton and Jim's valet, who was also among
them, stood apart: all the rest were standing round us two with
gleaming eyes and open mouths, hanging on the debate, and forced, so
I imagined, from their imperfect knowledge of English to attend
closely in order to catch the drift of what went on. Every now and
then a murmur of Gaelic passed between them, and this somehow I found
peculiarly disconcerting.</p>

<p>"But what have the hares to do with the children or women of
Achnaleish?" I asked.</p>

<p>There was no reply to this beyond the reiterated sentence:
"There's na shooting of hares in Achnaleish whatever," and then
Sandie turned to Jim.</p>

<p>"That's the end of the bit wood, sir," he said. "We've been
a'roound."</p>

<p>Certainly the beat had been very satisfactory. A roe had fallen to
Jim (one ought also to have fallen to me, but remained, if not
standing, at any rate running away). We had a dozen of black-game,
four pigeons, six brace of grouse (these were, of course, but
outliers, as we had not gone on to the moor proper at all), some
thirty rabbits, and four couple of woodcock. This, it must be
understood, was just from the fringe of plantations about the house,
but this was all we meant to do to-day, making only a morning of it,
since our ladies had expressly desired first lessons in the art of
angling in the afternoon, so that they too could be busy. Excellently
too had Sandie worked the beat, leaving us now, after going, as he
said, all round, a couple of hundred yards only from the house, at a
few minutes to two.</p>

<p>So, after a little private signalling from Jim to me, he spoke to
Sandie, dropping the hare-question altogether.</p>

<p>"Well, the beat has gone excellently," he said, "and this
afternoon we'll be fishing. Please settle with the beaters every
evening, and tell me what you have paid out. Good morning to you
all."</p>

<p>We walked back to the house, but the moment we had turned a hum of
confabulation began behind us, and, looking back, I saw Sandie and
all the beaters in close whispering conclave. Then Jim spoke.</p>

<p>"More in your line than mine," he said; "I prefer shooting a hare
to routing out some cock-and--bull story as to why I shouldn't. What
does it all mean?"</p>

<p>I mentioned what I had found in Elwes last night.</p>

<p>"Then do they think it was we who killed the old lady on the road,
and that I was going to kill somebody else this morning?" he asked.
"How does one know that they won't say that rabbits are their aunts,
and woodcock their uncles, and grouse their children? I never heard
such rot, and to-morrow we'll have a hare drive. Blow the grouse!
We'll settle this hare-question first."</p>

<p>Jim by this time was in the frame of mind typical of the English
when their rights are threatened. He had the shooting of Achnaleish,
on which were hares, sir, hares. And if he chose to shoot hares,
neither papal bull nor royal charter could stop him.</p>

<p>"Then there'll be a row," said I, and Jim sniffed scornfully.</p>

<p>At lunch Sandie's remark about the "sickness," which I had
forgotten till that moment, was explained.</p>

<p>"Fancy that horrible influenza getting here," said Madge. "Mabel
and I went down to the village this morning, and, oh, Ted, you can
get all sorts of things, from mackintoshes to peppermints, at the
most heavenly shop, and there was a child there looking awfully ill
and feverish. So we inquired: it was the 'sickness'--that was all
they knew. But, from what the woman said, it's clearly influenza.
Sudden fever, and all the rest of it."</p>

<p>"Bad type?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; there have been several deaths already among the old people
from pneumonia following it."</p>

<p>Now, I hope that as an Englishman I too have a notion of my
rights, and attempt anyhow to enforce them, as a general rule, if
they are wantonly threatened. But if a mad bull wishes to prevent my
going across a certain field, I do not insist on my rights, but go
round instead, since I see no reasonable hope of convincing the bull
that according to the constitution of my country I may walk in this
field unmolested. And that afternoon, as Madge and I drifted about
the loch, while I was not employed in disentangling her flies from
each other or her hair or my coat, I pondered over our position with
regard to the hares and men of Achnaleish, and thought that the
question of the bull and the field represented our standpoint pretty
accurately. Jim had the shooting of Achnaleish, and that undoubtedly
included the right to shoot hares: so too he might have the right to
walk over a field in which was a mad bull. But it seemed to me not
more futile to argue with the bull than to hope to convince these
folk of Achnaleish that the hares were--as was assuredly the
case--only hares, and not the embodiments of their friends and
relations. For that, beyond all doubt, was their belief, and it would
take, not half an hour's talk, but perhaps a couple of generations of
education to kill that belief, or even to reduce it to the level of a
superstition. At present it was no superstition--the terror and
incredulous horror on Sandie's face when Jim raised his gun to fire
at the hare told me that--it was a belief as sober and commonplace as
our own belief that the hares were not incarnations of living folk in
Achnaleish.</p>

<p>Also, virulent influenza was raging in the place, and Jim proposed
to have a hare-drive to-morrow! What would happen?</p>

<p>That evening Jim raved about it in the smoking-room.</p>

<p>"But, good gracious, man, what can they do?" he cried. "What's the
use of an old gaffer from Achnaleish saying I've shot his
grand-daughter and, when he is asked to produce the corpse, telling
the jury that we've eaten it, but that he has got the skin as
evidence? What skin? A hare-skin! Oh, folklore is all very well in
its way, a nice subject for discussion when topics are scarce, but
don't tell me it can enter into practical life. What can they
do?"</p>

<p>"They can shoot us," I remarked.</p>

<p>"The canny, God-fearing Scotchmen shoot us for shooting hares?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a possibility. However, I don't think you'll have much
of a hare-drive in any case."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because you won't get a single native beater, and you won't get a
keeper to come either."</p>

<p>"You'll have to go with Buxton and your man."</p>

<p>"Then I'll discharge Sandie," snapped Jim.</p>

<p>"That would be a pity: he knows his work."</p>

<p>Jim got up.</p>

<p>"Well, his work to-morrow will be to drive hares for you and me,"
said Jim. "Or do you funk?"</p>

<p>"I funk," I replied.</p>

<p>The scene next morning was extremely short. Jim and I went out
before breakfast, and found Sandie at the back door, silent and
respectful. In the yard were a dozen young Highlanders, who had
beaten for us the day before.</p>

<p>"Morning, Sandie," said Jim shortly. "We'll drive hares to-day. We
ought to get a lot in those narrow gorges up above. Get a dozen
beaters more, can you?"</p>

<p>"There will be na hare-drive here," said Sandie quietly.</p>

<p>"I have given you your orders," said Jim.</p>

<p>Sandie turned to the group of beaters outside and spoke half a
dozen words in Gaelic. Next moment the yard was empty, and they were
all running down the hillside towards Achnaleish.</p>

<p>One stood on the skyline a moment, waving his arms, making some
signal, as I supposed, to the village below. Then Sandie turned
again.</p>

<p>"An' whaur are your beaters, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>For the moment I was afraid Jim was going to strike him. But he
controlled himself.</p>

<p>"You are discharged," he said.</p>

<p>The hare-drive, therefore, since there were neither beaters nor
keeper--Maclaren, the head-keeper, having been given this "dayoff" to
bury his mother--was clearly out of the question, and Jim, still
blustering rather, but a good bit taken aback at the sudden
disciplined defection of the beaters, was in betting humour that they
would all return by to-morrow morning. Meanwhile the post which
should have arrived before now had not come, though Mabel from her
bedroom window had seen the post-cart on its way up the drive a
quarter of an hour ago. At that a sudden idea struck me, and I ran to
the edge of the hog's back on which the house was set. It was even as
I thought: the post-cart was just striking the high-road below, going
away from the house and back to the village, without having left our
letters.</p>

<p>I went back to the dining-room. Everything apparently was going
wrong this morning: the bread was stale, the milk was not fresh, and
the bell was rung for Buxton. Quite so: neither milkman nor baker had
called.</p>

<p>From the point of view of folk-lore this was admirable.</p>

<p>"There's another cock-and-bull story called 'taboo,'" I said. "It
means that nobody will supply you with anything."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing," said
Jim, helping himself to marmalade.</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"You are irritated," I said, "because you are beginning to be
afraid that there is something in it."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's quite true," he said. "But who could have supposed
there was anything in it? Ah, dash it! there can't be. A hare is a
hare."</p>

<p>"Except when it is your first cousin," said I.</p>

<p>"Then I shall go out and shoot first cousins by myself," he said.
That, I am glad to say, in the light of what followed, we dissuaded
him from doing, and instead he went off with Madge down the burn. And
I, I may confess, occupied myself the whole morning, ensconced in a
thick piece of scrub on the edge of the steep brae above Achnaleish,
in watching through a field-glass what went on there. One could see
as from a balloon almost: the street with its houses was spread like
a map below.</p>

<p>First, then, there was a funeral--the funeral, I suppose, of the
mother of Maclaren, attended, I should say, by the whole village. But
after that there was no dispersal of the folk to their work: it was
as if it was the Sabbath; they hung about the street talking. Now one
group would break up, but it would only go to swell another, and no
one went either to his house or to the fields.</p>

<p>Then, shortly before lunch, another idea occurred to me, and I ran
down the hill-side, appearing suddenly in the street, to put it to
the test. Sandie was there, but he turned his back square on me, as
did everybody else, and as I approached any group talk fell dead. But
a certain movement seemed to be going on; where they stood and talked
before, they now moved and were silent.</p>

<p>Soon I saw what that meant. None would remain in the street with
me: every man was going to his house.</p>

<p>The end house of the street was clearly the "heavenly shop" we had
been told of yesterday.</p>

<p>The door was open and a small child was looking round it as I
approached, for my plan was to go in, order something, and try to get
into conversation. But, while I was still a yard or two off, I saw
through the glass of the door a man inside come quickly up and pull
the child roughly away, banging the door and locking it. I knocked
and rang, but there was no response: only from inside came the crying
of the child.</p>

<p>The street which had been so busy and populous was now completely
empty; it might have been the street of some long-deserted place, but
that thin smoke curled here and there above the houses. It was as
silent, too, as the grave, but, for all that, I knew it was watching.
From every house, I felt sure, I was being watched by eyes of
mistrust and hate, yet no sign of living being could I see. There was
to me something rather eerie about this: to know one is watched by
invisible eyes is never, I suppose, quite a comfortable sensation; to
know that those eyes are all hostile does not increase the sense of
security. So I just climbed back up the hillside again, and from my
thicket above the brae again I peered down. Once more the street was
full.</p>

<p>Now, all this made me uneasy: the taboo had been started,
and--since not a soul had been near us since Sandie gave the word,
whatever it was, that morning--was in excellent working order. Then
what was the purport of these meetings and colloquies? What else
threatened? The afternoon told me.</p>

<p>It was about two o'clock when these meetings finally broke up, and
at once the whole village left the street for the hill-sides, much as
if they were all returning to work. The only odd thing indeed was
that no one remained behind: women and children alike went out, all
in little parties of two and three. Some of these I watched rather
idly, for I had formed the hasty conclusion that they were all going
back to their usual employments, and saw that here a woman and girl
were cutting dead bracken and heather. That was reasonable enough,
and I turned my glass on others.</p>

<p>Group after group I examined; all were doing the same thing,
cutting fuel...fuel.</p>

<p>Then vaguely, with a sense of impossibility, a thought flashed
across me; again it flashed, more vividly. This time I left my
hiding-place with considerable alacrity and went to find Jim down by
the burn. I told him exactly what I had seen and what I believed it
meant, and I fancy that his belief in the possibility of folk-lore
entering the domain of practical life was very considerably
quickened. In any case, it was not a quarter of an hour afterwards
that the chauffeur and I were going, precisely as fast as the Napier
was able, along the road to Lairg. We had not told the women what my
conjecture was, because we believed that, making the dispositions we
were making, there was no cause for alarm-sounding. One private
signal only existed between Jim within the house that night and me
outside. If my conjecture proved to be correct, he was to place a
light in the window of my room, which I should see returning after
dark from Lairg. My ostensible reason for going was to get some local
fishing-flies.</p>

<p>As we flowed--there is no other word for the movement of these big
cars but that--over the road to Lairg, I ran over everything in my
mind. I felt no doubt whatever that all the brushwood and kindling I
had seen being gathered in was to be piled after nightfall round our
walls and set on fire. This certainly would not be done till after
dark; indeed, we both felt sure that it would not be done till it was
supposed that we were all abed. It remained to see whether the police
at Lairg agreed with my conjecture, and it was to ascertain this that
I was now flowing there.</p>

<p>I told my story to the chief constable as soon as I got there,
omitting nothing and, I think, exaggerating nothing. His face got
graver and graver as I proceeded.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, you did right to come," he said. "The folk at
Achnaleish are the dourest and the most savage in all Scotland.
You'll have to give up this hare-hunting, though, whatever," he
added.</p>

<p>He rang up his telephone.</p>

<p>"I'll get five men," he said, "and I'll be with you in ten
minutes."</p>

<p>Our plan of campaign was simple. We were to leave the car well out
of sight of Achnaleish, and--supposing the signal was in my
window--steal up from all sides to command the house from every
direction. It would not be difficult to make our way unseen through
the plantations that ran up close to the house, and hidden at their
margins we could see whether the brushwood and heather were piled up
round the lodge. There we should wait to see if anybody attempted to
fire it. That somebody, whenever he showed his light, would be
instantly covered by a rifle and challenged.</p>

<p>It was about ten when we dismounted and stalked our way up to the
house. The light burned in my window; all else was quiet. Personally,
I was unarmed, and so, when I had planted the men in places of
advantageous concealment round the house, my work was over. Then I
returned to Sergeant Duncan, the chief constable, at the corner of
the hedge by the garden, and waited.</p>

<p>How long we waited I do not know, but it seemed as if &aelig;ons
slipped by over us. Now and then an owl would hoot, now and then a
rabbit ran out from cover and nibbled the short sweet grass of the
lawn. The night was thickly overcast with clouds, and the house
seemed no more than a black dot, with slits of light where windows
were lit within. By and by even these slits of illumination were
extinguished, and other lights appeared in the top story. After a
while they, too, vanished; no sign of life appeared on the quiet
house. Then suddenly the end came: I heard a foot grate on the
gravel; I saw the gleam of a lantern, and heard Duncan's voice.</p>

<p>"Man," he shouted, "if you move hand or foot I fire. My rifle-bead
is dead on you."</p>

<p>Then I blew the whistle; the others ran up, and in less than a
minute it was all over. The man we closed in on was Maclaren.</p>

<p>"They killed my mither with that hell-carriage," he said, "as she
juist sat on the road, puir body, who had niver hurt them."</p>

<p>And that seemed to him an excellent reason for attempting to burn
us all to death.</p>

<p>But it took time to get into the house: their preparations had
been singularly workmanlike, for every window and door on the ground
floor was wired up.</p>

<p>Now, we had Achnaleish for two months, but we had no wish to be
burned or otherwise murdered. What we wanted was not a prosecution of
our head-keeper, but peace, the necessaries of life, and beaters. For
that we were willing to shoot no hares, and release Maclaren. An
hour's conclave next morning settled these things; the ensuing two
months were most enjoyable, and relations were the friendliest.</p>

<p>But if anybody wants to test how far what Jim still calls
cock-and-bull stories can enter into practical life, I should suggest
to him to go a-shooting hares at Achnaleish.</p>

<h2><a name="ch23"></a>The Terror by Night</h2>

<p>The transference of emotion is a phenomenon so common, so
constantly witnessed, that mankind in general have long ceased to be
conscious of its existence, as a thing worth our wonder or
consideration, regarding it as being as natural and commonplace as
the transference of things that act by the ascertained laws of
matter. Nobody, for instance, is surprised, if when the room is too
hot, the opening of a window causes the cold fresh air of outside to
be transferred into the room, and in the same way no one is surprised
when into the same room, perhaps, which we will imagine as being
peopled with dull and gloomy persons, there enters some one of fresh
and sunny mind, who instantly brings into the stuffy mental
atmosphere a change analogous to that of the opened windows. Exactly
how this infection is conveyed we do not know; considering the
wireless wonders (that act by material laws) which are already
beginning to lose their wonder now that we have our newspaper brought
as a matter of course every morning in mid-Atlantic, it would not
perhaps be rash to conjecture that in some subtle and occult way the
transference of emotion is in reality material too. Certainly (to
take another instance) the sight of definitely material things, like
writing on a page, conveys emotion apparently direct to our minds, as
when our pleasure or pity is stirred by a book, and it is therefore
possible that mind may act on mind by means as material as that.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, we come across phenomena which, though they
may easily be as material as any of these things, are rarer, and
therefore more astounding. Some people call them ghosts, some
conjuring tricks, and some nonsense. It seems simpler to group them
under the head of transferred emotions, and they may appeal to any of
the senses. Some ghosts are seen, some heard, some felt, and though I
know of no instance of a ghost being tasted, yet it will seem in the
following pages that these occult phenomena may appeal at any rate to
the senses that perceive heat, cold, or smell. For, to take the
analogy of wireless telegraphy, we are all of us probably "receivers"
to some extent, and catch now and then a message or part of a message
that the eternal waves of emotion are ceaselessly shouting aloud to
those who have ears to hear, and materialising themselves for those
who have eyes to see. Not being, as a rule, perfectly tuned, we grasp
but pieces and fragments of such messages, a few coherent words it
may be, or a few words which seem to have no sense. The following
story, however, to my mind, is interesting, because it shows how
different pieces of what no doubt was one message were received and
recorded by several different people simultaneously. Ten years have
elapsed since the events recorded took place, but they were written
down at the time.</p>

<p>Jack Lorimer and I were very old friends before he married, and
his marriage to a first cousin of mine did not make, as so often
happens, a slackening in our intimacy. Within a few months after, it
was found out that his wife had consumption, and, without any loss of
time, she was sent off to Davos, with her sister to look after her.
The disease had evidently been detected at a very early stage, and
there was excellent ground for hoping that with proper care and
strict regime she would be cured by the life-giving frosts of that
wonderful valley.</p>

<p>The two had gone out in the November of which I am speaking, and
Jack and I joined them for a month at Christmas, and found that week
after week she was steadily and quickly gaining ground. We had to be
back in town by the end of January, but it was settled that Ida
should remain out with her sister for a week or two more. They both,
I remember, came down to the station to see us off, and I am not
likely to forget the last words that passed:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't look so woebegone, Jack," his wife had said; "you'll
see me again before long."</p>

<p>Then the fussy little mountain engine squeaked, as a puppy squeaks
when its toe is trodden on, and we puffed our way up the pass.</p>

<p>London was in its usual desperate February plight when we got
back, full of fogs and still-born frosts that seemed to produce a
cold far more bitter than the piercing temperature of those sunny
altitudes from which we had come. We both, I think, felt rather
lonely, and even before we had got to our journey's end we had
settled that for the present it was ridiculous that we should keep
open two houses when one would suffice, and would also be far more
cheerful for us both.</p>

<p>So, as we both lived in almost identical houses in the same street
in Chelsea, we decided to "toss," live in the house which the coin
indicated (heads mine, tails his), share expenses, attempt to let the
other house, and, if successful, share the proceeds. A French
five-franc piece of the Second Empire told us it was "heads."</p>

<p>We had been back some ten days, receiving every day the most
excellent accounts from Davos, when, first on him, then on me, there
descended, like some tropical storm, a feeling of indefinable fear.
Very possibly this sense of apprehension (for there is nothing in the
world so virulently infectious) reached me through him: on the other
hand both these attacks of vague foreboding may have come from the
same source. But it is true that it did not attack me till he spoke
of it, so the possibility perhaps inclines to my having caught it
from him. He spoke of it first, I remember, one evening when we had
met for a good-night talk, after having come back from separate
houses where we had dined.</p>

<p>"I have felt most awfully down all day," he said; "and just after
receiving this splendid account from Daisy, I can't think what is the
matter."</p>

<p>He poured himself out some whisky and soda as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh, touch of liver," I said. "I shouldn't drink that if I were
you. Give it me instead."</p>

<p>"I was never better in my life," he said.</p>

<p>I was opening letters, as we talked, and came across one from the
house agent, which, with trembling eagerness, I read.</p>

<p>"Hurrah," I cried, "offer of five gu as--why can't he write it in
proper English--five guineas a week till Easter for number 31. We
shall roll in guineas!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I can't stop here till Easter," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't see why not. Nor by the way does Daisy. I heard from her
this morning, and she told me to persuade you to stop. That's to say,
if you like. It really is more cheerful for you here. I forgot, you
were telling me something."</p>

<p>The glorious news about the weekly guineas did not cheer him up in
the least.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully. Of course I'll stop."</p>

<p>He moved up and down the room once or twice.</p>

<p>"No, it's not me that is wrong," he said, "it's It, whatever It
is. The terror by night."</p>

<p>"Which you are commanded not to be afraid of," I remarked.</p>

<p>"I know; it's easy commanding. I'm frightened: something's
coming."</p>

<p>"Five guineas a week are coming," I said. "I shan't sit up and be
infected by your fears. All that matters, Davos, is going as well as
it can. What was the last report? Incredibly better. Take that to bed
with you."</p>

<p>The infection--if infection it was--did not take hold of me then,
for I remember going to sleep feeling quite cheerful, but I awoke in
some dark still house and It, the terror by night, had come while I
slept. Fear and misgiving, blind, unreasonable, and paralysing, had
taken and gripped me. What was it? Just as by an aneroid we can
foretell the approach of storm, so by this sinking of the spirit,
unlike anything I had ever felt before, I felt sure that disaster of
some sort was presaged.</p>

<p>Jack saw it at once when we met at breakfast next morning, in the
brown haggard light of a foggy day, not dark enough for candles, but
dismal beyond all telling.</p>

<p>"So it has come to you too," he said.</p>

<p>And I had not even the fighting-power left to tell him that I was
merely slightly unwell.</p>

<p>Besides, never in my life had I felt better.</p>

<p>All next day, all the day after that fear lay like a black cloak
over my mind; I did not know what I dreaded, but it was something
very acute, something that was very near. It was coming nearer every
moment, spreading like a pall of clouds over the sky; but on the
third day, after miserably cowering under it, I suppose some sort of
courage came back to me: either this was pure imagination, some trick
of disordered nerves or what not, in which case we were both
"disquieting ourselves in vain," or from the immeasurable waves of
emotion that beat upon the minds of men, something within both of us
had caught a current, a pressure. In either case it was infinitely
better to try, however ineffectively, to stand up against it. For
these two days I had neither worked nor played; I had only shrunk and
shuddered; I planned for myself a busy day, with diversion for us
both in the evening.</p>

<p>"We will dine early," I said, "and go to the 'Man from
Blankley's.' I have already asked Philip to come, and he is coming,
and I have telephoned for tickets. Dinner at seven."</p>

<p>Philip, I may remark, is an old friend of ours, neighbour in this
street, and by profession a much-respected doctor.</p>

<p>Jack laid down his paper.</p>

<p>"Yes, I expect you're right," he said. "It's no use doing nothing,
it doesn't help things. Did you sleep well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, beautifully," I said rather snappishly, for I was all on
edge with the added burden of an almost sleepless night.</p>

<p>"I wish I had," said he.</p>

<p>This would not do at all.</p>

<p>"We have got to play up!" I said. "Here are we two strong and
stalwart persons, with as much cause for satisfaction with life as
any you can mention, letting ourselves behave like worms. Our fear
may be over things imaginary or over things that are real, but it is
the fact of being afraid that is so despicable. There is nothing in
the world to fear except fear. You know that as well as I do. Now
let's read our papers with interest. Which do you back, Mr. Druce, or
the Duke of Portland, or the Times Book Club?"</p>

<p>That day, therefore, passed very busily for me; and there were
enough events moving in front of that black background, which I was
conscious was there all the time, to enable me to keep my eyes away
from it, and I was detained rather late at the office, and had to
drive back to Chelsea, in order to be in time to dress for dinner
instead of walking back as I had intended.</p>

<p>Then the message, which for these three days had been twittering
in our minds, the receivers, just making them quiver and rattle, came
through.</p>

<p>I found Jack already dressed, since it was within a minute or two
of seven when I got in, and sitting in the drawing-room. The day had
been warm and muggy, but when I looked in on the way up to my room,
it seemed to me to have grown suddenly and bitterly cold, not with
the dampness of English frost, but with the clear and stinging
exhilaration of such days as we had recently spent in Switzerland.
Fire was laid in the grate but not lit, and I went down on my knees
on the hearth-rug to light it.</p>

<p>"Why, it's freezing in here," I said. "What donkeys servants are!
It never occurs to them that you want fires in cold weather, and no
fires in hot weather."</p>

<p>"Oh, for heaven's sake don't light the fire," said he, "it's the
warmest muggiest evening I ever remember."</p>

<p>I stared at him in astonishment. My hands were shaking with the
cold. He saw this.</p>

<p>"Why, you are shivering!" he said. "Have you caught a chill? But
as to the room being cold let us look at the thermometer."</p>

<p>There was one on the writing-table.</p>

<p>"Sixty-five," he said.</p>

<p>There was no disputing that, nor did I want to, for at that moment
it suddenly struck us, dimly and distantly, that It was "coming
through." I felt it like some curious internal vibration.</p>

<p>"Hot or cold, I must go and dress," I said.</p>

<p>Still shivering, but feeling as if I was breathing some rarefied
exhilarating air, I went up to my room. My clothes were already laid
out, but, by an oversight, no hot water had been brought up, and I
rang for my man. He came up almost at once, but he looked scared, or,
to my already-startled senses, he appeared so.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I said.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir," he said, and he could hardly articulate the words.
"I thought you rang."</p>

<p>"Yes. Hot water. But what's the matter?"</p>

<p>He shifted from one foot to the other.</p>

<p>"I thought I saw a lady on the stairs," he said, "coming up close
behind me. And the front-door bell hadn't rung that I heard."</p>

<p>"Where did you think you saw her?" I asked.</p>

<p>"On the stairs. Then on the landing outside the drawing-room door,
sir," he said. "She stood there as if she didn't know whether to go
in or not."</p>

<p>"One--one of the servants," I said. But again I felt that It was
coming through.</p>

<p>"No, sir. It was none of the servants," he said.</p>

<p>"Who was it then?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't see distinctly, sir, it was dim-like. But I thought it
was Mrs. Lorimer."</p>

<p>"Oh, go and get me some hot water," I said.</p>

<p>But he lingered; he was quite clearly frightened.</p>

<p>At this moment the front door bell rang. It was just seven, and
already Philip had come with brutal punctuality while I was not yet
half dressed.</p>

<p>"That's Dr. Enderly," I said. "Perhaps if he is on the stairs you
may be able to pass the place where you saw the lady."</p>

<p>Then quite suddenly there rang through the house a scream, so
terrible, so appalling in its agony and supreme terror, that I simply
stood still and shuddered, unable to move. Then by an effort so
violent that I felt as if something must break, I recalled the power
of motion, and ran downstairs, my man at my heels, to meet Philip who
was running up from the ground floor. He had heard it too.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he said. "What was that?"</p>

<p>Together we went into the drawing-room. Jack was lying in front of
the fireplace, with the chair in which he had been sitting a few
minutes before overturned. Philip went straight to him and bent over
him, tearing open his white shirt.</p>

<p>"Open all the windows," he said, "the place reeks."</p>

<p>We flung open the windows, and there poured in so it seemed to me,
a stream of hot air into the bitter cold. Eventually Philip got
up.</p>

<p>"He is dead," he said. "Keep the windows open. The place is still
thick with chloroform."</p>

<p>Gradually to my sense the room got warmer, to Philip's the
drug-laden atmosphere dispersed.</p>

<p>But neither my servant nor I had smelt anything at all.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later there came a telegram from Davos for me.
It was to tell me to break the news of Daisy's death to Jack, and was
sent by her sister. She supposed he would come out immediately. But
he had been gone two hours now.</p>

<p>I left for Davos next day, and learned what had happened. Daisy
had been suffering for three days from a little abscess which had to
be opened, and, though the operation was of the slightest, she had
been so nervous about it that the doctor gave her chloroform. She
made a good recovery from the anesthetic, but an hour later had a
sudden attack of syncope, and had died that night at a few minutes
before eight, by Central European time, corresponding to seven in
English time. She had insisted that Jack should be told nothing about
this little operation till it was over, since the matter was quite
unconnected with her general health, and she did not wish to cause
him needless anxiety.</p>

<p>And there the story ends. To my servant there came the sight of a
woman outside the drawing-room door, where Jack was, hesitating about
her entrance, at the moment when Daisy's soul hovered between the two
worlds; to me there came--I do not think it is fanciful to suppose
this--the keen exhilarating cold of Davos; to Philip there came the
fumes of chloroform. And to Jack, I must suppose, came his wife. So
he joined her.</p>

<h2><a name="ch24"></a>Mr. Tilly's Seance</h2>

<p>Mr. Tilly had only the briefest moment for reflection, when, as he
slipped and fell on the greasy wood pavement at Hyde Park Corner,
which he was crossing at a smart trot, he saw the huge
traction-engine with its grooved ponderous wheels towering high above
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" he said petulantly, "it will certainly crush
me quite flat, and I shan't be able to be at Mrs. Cumberbatch's
s&eacute;ance! Most provoking! A-ow!"</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth, when the first half of his
horrid anticipations was thoroughly fulfilled. The heavy wheels
passed over him from head to foot and flattened him completely out.
Then the driver (too late) reversed his engine and passed over him
again, and finally lost his head, whistled loudly and stopped. The
policeman on duty at the corner turned quite faint at the sight of
the catastrophe, but presently recovered sufficiently to hold up the
traffic, and ran to see what on earth could be done. It was all so
much "up" with Mr. Tilly that the only thing possible was to get the
hysterical engine-driver to move clear. Then the ambulance from the
hospital was sent for, and Mr. Tilly's remains, detached with great
difficulty from the road (so firmly had they been pressed into it),
were reverently carried away into the mortuary Mr. Tilly during this
had experienced one moment's excruciating pain, resembling the
severest neuralgia as his head was ground beneath the wheel, but
almost before he realised it, the pain was past, and he found
himself, still rather dazed, floating or standing (he did no know
which) in the middle of the road. There had been no break in his
consciousness; he perfectly recollected slipping, and wondered how he
had managed to save himself. He saw the arrested traffic, the
policeman with white wan face making suggestions to the gibbering
engine-driver, and he received the very puzzling impression that the
traction engine was all mixed up with him.</p>

<p>He had a sensation of red-hot coals and boiling water and rivets
all around him, but yet no feeling of scalding or burning or
confinement. He was, on the contrary, extremely comfortable, and had
the most pleasant consciousness of buoyancy and freedom. Then the
engine puffed and the wheels went round, and immediately, to his
immense surprise, he perceived his own crushed remains, flat as a
biscuit, lying on the roadway. He identified them for certain by his
clothes, which he had put on for the first time that morning, and one
patent leather boot which had escaped demolition.</p>

<p>"But what on earth has happened?" he said. "Here am I, and yet
that poor pressed flower of arms and legs is me--or rather I--also.
And how terribly upset the driver looks. Why, I do believe that I've
been run over! It did hurt for a moment, now I come to think of it
...My good man, where are you shoving to? Don't you see me?"</p>

<p>He addressed these two questions to the policeman, who appeared to
walk right through him.</p>

<p>But the man took no notice, and calmly came out on the other side:
it was quite evident that he did not see him, or apprehend him in any
way.</p>

<p>Mr. Tilly was still feeling rather at sea amid these unusual
occurrences, and there began to steal into his mind a glimpse of the
fact which was so obvious to the crowd which formed an interested but
respectful ring round his body. Men stood with bared heads; women
screamed and looked away and looked back again.</p>

<p>"I really believe I'm dead," said he. "That's the only hypothesis
which will cover the facts."</p>

<p>"But I must feel more certain of it before I do anything. Ah! Here
they come with the ambulance to look at me. I must be terribly hurt,
and yet I don't feel hurt. I should feel hurt surely if I was hurt. I
must be dead."</p>

<p>Certainly it seemed the only thing for him to be, but he was far
from realising it yet. A lane had been made through the crowd for the
stretcher-bearers, and he found himself wincing when they began to
detach him from the road.</p>

<p>"Oh, do take care!" he said. "That's the sciatic nerve protruding
there surely, isn't it? A-ow!</p>

<p>"No, it didn't hurt after all. My new clothes, too: I put them on
to-day for the first time. What bad luck! Now you're holding my leg
upside down. Of course all my money comes out of my trouser pocket.
And there's my ticket for the s&eacute;ance; I must have that: I may
use it after all."</p>

<p>He tweaked it out of the fingers of the man who had picked it up,
and laughed to see the expression of amazement on his face as the
card suddenly vanished. That gave him something fresh to think about,
and he pondered for a moment over some touch of association set up by
it.</p>

<p>"I have it," he thought. "It is clear that the moment I came into
connection with that card, it became invisible. I'm invisible myself
(of course to the grosser sense), and everything I hold becomes
invisible. Most interesting! That accounts for the sudden appearances
of small objects at a s&eacute;ance. The spirit has been holding
them, and as long as he holds them they are invisible.</p>

<p>"Then he lets go, and there's the flower or the spirit-photograph
on the table. It accounts, too, for the sudden disappearances of such
objects. The spirit has taken them, though the scoffers say that the
medium has secreted them about his person. It is true that when
searched he sometimes appears to have done so; but, after all, that
may be a joke on the part of the spirit. Now, what am I to do with
myself. Let me see, there's the clock. It's just half-past ten. All
this has happened in a few minutes, for it was a quarter past when I
left my house. Half-past ten now: what does that mean exactly? I used
to know what it meant, but now it seems nonsense. Ten what? Hours, is
it? What's an hour?"</p>

<p>This was very puzzling. He felt that he used to know what an hour
and a minute meant, but the perception of that, naturally enough, had
ceased with his emergence from time and space into eternity. The
conception of time was like some memory which, refusing to record
itself on the consciousness, lies perdu in some dark corner of the
brain, laughing at the efforts of the owner to ferret it out. While
he still interrogated his mind over this lapsed perception, he found
that space as well as time, had similarly grown obsolete for him, for
he caught sight of his friend Miss Ida Soulsby, who he knew was to be
present at the s&eacute;ance for which he was bound, hurrying with
bird-like steps down the pavement opposite. Forgetting for the moment
that he was a disembodied spirit, he made the effort of will which in
his past human existence would have set his legs in pursuit of her,
and found that the effort of will alone was enough to place him at
her side.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Soulsby," he said, "I was on my way to Mrs.
Cumberbatch's house when I was knocked down and killed. It was far
from unpleasant, a moment's headache--"</p>

<p>So far his natural volubility had carried him before he
recollected that he was invisible and inaudible to those still closed
in by the muddy vesture of decay, and stopped short. But though it
was clear that what he said was inaudible to Miss Soulsby's rather
large intelligent-looking ears, it seemed that some consciousness of
his presence was conveyed to her finer sense, for she looked suddenly
startled, a flush rose to her face, and he heard her murmur, "Very
odd. I wonder why I received so vivid an impression of dear
Teddy."</p>

<p>That gave Mr. Tilly a pleasant shock. He had long admired the
lady, and here she was alluding to him in her supposed privacy as
"dear Teddy." That was followed by a momentary regret that he had
been killed: he would have liked to have been possessed of this
information before, and have pursued the primrose path of dalliance
down which it seemed to lead. (His intentions, of course, would, as
always, have been strictly honourable: the path of dalliance would
have conducted them both, if she consented, to the altar, where the
primroses would have been exchanged for orange blossom.) But his
regret was quite short-lived; though the altar seemed inaccessible,
the primrose path might still be open, for many of the spiritualistic
circle in which he lived were on most affectionate terms with their
spiritual guides and friends who, like himself, had passed over. From
a human point of view these innocent and even elevating flirtations
had always seemed to him rather bloodless; but now, looking on them
from the far side, he saw how charming they were, for they gave him
the sense of still having a place and an identity in the world he had
just quitted. He pressed Miss Ida's hand (or rather put himself into
the spiritual condition of so doing), and could vaguely feel that it
had some hint of warmth and solidity about it. This was gratifying,
for it showed that though he had passed out of the material plane, he
could still be in touch with it. Still more gratifying was it to
observe that a pleased and secret smile overspread Miss Ida's fine
features as he gave this token of his presence: perhaps she only
smiled at her own thoughts, but in any case it was he who had
inspired them.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this, he indulged in a slightly more intimate token
of affection, and permitted himself a respectful salute, and saw that
he had gone too far, for she said to herself, "Hush, hush!" and
quickened her pace, as if to leave these amorous thoughts behind.</p>

<p>He felt that he was beginning to adjust himself to the new
conditions in which he would now live or, at any rate, was getting
some sort of inkling as to what they were. Time existed no more for
him, nor yet did space, since the wish to be at Miss Ida's side had
instantly transported him there, and with a view to testing this
further he wished himself back in his flat. As swiftly as the change
of scene in a cinematograph show he found himself there, and
perceived that the news of his death must have reached his servants,
for his cook and parlour-maid with excited faces, were talking over
the event.</p>

<p>"Poor little gentleman," said his cook. "It seems a shame it does.
He never hurt a fly, and to think of one of those great engines
laying him out flat. I hope they'll take him to the cemetery from the
hospital: I never could bear a corpse in the house."</p>

<p>The great strapping parlour-maid tossed her head.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not sure that it doesn't serve him right," she
observed. "Always messing about with spirits he was, and the
knockings and concertinas was awful sometimes when I've been laying
out supper in the dining-room. Now perhaps he'll come himself and
visit the rest of the loonies. But I'm sorry all the same. A less
troublesome little gentleman never stepped. Always pleasant, too, and
wages paid to the day."</p>

<p>These regretful comments and encomiums were something of a shock
to Mr. Tilly. He had imagined that his excellent servants regarded
him with a respectful affection, as befitted some sort of demigod,
and the role of the poor little gentleman was not at all to his mind.
This revelation of their true estimate of him, although what they
thought of him could no longer have the smallest significance
irritated him profoundly.</p>

<p>"I never heard such impertinence," he said (so he thought) quite
out loud, and still intensely earth-bound, was astonished to see that
they had no perception whatever of his presence. He raised his voice,
replete with extreme irony, and addressed his cook.</p>

<p>"You may reserve your criticism on my character for your
saucepans," he said. "They will no doubt appreciate them. As regards
the arrangements for my funeral, I have already provided for them in
my will, and do not propose to consult your convenience. At
present--"</p>

<p>"Lor'!" said Mrs. Inglis, "I declare I can almost hear his voice,
poor little fellow. Husky it was, as if he would do better by
clearing his throat. I suppose I'd best be making a black bow to my
cap. His lawyers and what not will be here presently."</p>

<p>Mr. Tilly had no sympathy with this suggestion. He was immensely
conscious of being quite alive, and the idea of his servants behaving
as if he were dead, especially after the way in which they had spoken
about him, was very vexing. He wanted to give them some striking
evidence of his presence and his activity, and he banged his hand
angrily on the dining-room table, from which the breakfast equipage
had not yet been cleared. Three tremendous blows he gave it, and was
rejoiced to see that his parlour-maid looked startled. Mrs. Inglis's
face remained perfectly placid.</p>

<p>"Why, if I didn't hear a sort of rapping sound," said Miss Talton.
"Where did it come from?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You've the jumps, dear," said Mrs. Inglis, picking up a
remaining rasher of bacon on a fork, and putting it into her
capacious mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. Tilly was delighted at making any impression at all on either
of these impercipient females.</p>

<p>"Talton!" he called at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>"Why, what's that?" said Talton. "Almost hear his voice, do you
say, Mrs. Inglis? I declare I did hear his voice then."</p>

<p>"A pack o' nonsense, dear," said Mrs. Inglis placidly. "That's a
prime bit of bacon, and there's a good cut of it left. Why, you're
all of a tremble! It's your imagination."</p>

<p>Suddenly it struck Mr. Tilly that he might be employing himself
much better than, with such extreme exertion, managing to convey so
slight a hint of his presence to his parlour-maid, and that the
s&eacute;ance at the house of the medium, Mrs. Cumberbatch, would
afford him much easier opportunities of getting through to the
earth-plane again. He gave a couple more thumps to the table and,
wishing himself at Mrs. Cumberbatch's nearly a mile away, scarcely
heard the faint scream of Talton at the sound of his blows before he
found himself in West Norfolk Street.</p>

<p>He knew the house well, and went straight to the drawing-room,
which was the scene of the s&eacute;ances he had so often and so
eagerly attended. Mrs. Cumberbatch who had a long spoon-shaped face,
had already pulled down the blinds, leaving the room in total
darkness except for the glimmer of the night-light which, under a
shade of ruby-glass, stood on the chimneypiece in front of the
coloured photograph of Cardinal Newman. Round the table were seated
Miss Ida Soulsby, Mr. and Mrs. Meriott (who paid their guineas at
least twice a week in order to consult their spiritual guide Abibel
and received mysterious advice about their indigestion and
investments), and Sir John Plaice, who was much interested in
learning the details of his previous incarnation as a Chaldean
priest, completed the circle. His guide, who resealed to him his
sacerdotal career, was playfully called Mespot. Naturally many other
spirits visited them, for Miss Soulsby had no less than three guides
in her spiritual household, Sapphire, Semiramis, and Sweet William,
while Napoleon and Plato were not infrequent guests. Cardinal Newman,
too, was a great favourite, and they encouraged his presence by the
singing in unison of "Lead, kindly Light": he could hardly ever
resist that...</p>

<p>Mr. Tilly observed with pleasure that there was a vacant seat by
the table which no doubt had been placed there for him. As he
entered, Mrs. Cumberbatch peered at her watch.</p>

<p>"Eleven o'clock already," she said, "and Mr. Tilly is not here
yet. I wonder what can have kept him. What shall we do, dear friends?
Abibel gets very impatient sometimes if we keep him waiting."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Meriott were getting impatient too, for he terribly
wanted to ask about Mexican oils, and she had a very vexing
heartburn.</p>

<p>"And Mespot doesn't like waiting either," said Sir John, jealous
for the prestige of his protector, "not to mention Sweet
William."</p>

<p>Miss Soulsby gave a little silvery laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, but my Sweet William's so good and kind," she said; "besides,
I have a feeling, quite a psychic feeling, Mrs. Cumberbatch, that Mr.
Tilly is very close."</p>

<p>"So I am," said Mr. Tilly.</p>

<p>"Indeed, as I walked here," continued Miss Soulsby, "I felt that
Mr. Tilly was somewhere quite close to me. Dear me, what's that?"</p>

<p>Mr. Tilly was so delighted at being sensed, that he could not
resist giving a tremendous rap on the table, in a sort of pleased
applause. Mrs. Cumberbatch heard it too.</p>

<p>"I'm sure that's Abibel come to tell us that he is ready," she
said. "I know Abibel's knock. A little patience, Abibel. Let's give
Mr. Tilly three minutes more and then begin. Perhaps, if we put up
the blinds, Abibel will understand we haven't begun."</p>

<p>This was done, and Miss Soulsby glided to the window, in order to
make known Mr. Tilly's approach, for he always came along the
opposite pavement and crossed over by the little island in the river
of traffic. There was evidently some lately published news, for the
readers of early editions were busy, and she caught sight of one of
the advertisement boards bearing in large letters the announcement of
a terrible accident at Hyde Park Corner. She drew in her breath with
a hissing sound and turned away, unwilling to have her psychic
tranquillity upset by the intrusion of painful incidents. But Mr.
Tilly, who had followed her to the window and saw what she had seen,
could hardly restrain a spiritual whoop of exultation.</p>

<p>"Why, it's all about me!" he said. "Such large letters, too. Very
gratifying. Subsequent editions will no doubt contain my name."</p>

<p>He gave another loud rap to call attention to himself, and Mrs.
Cumberbatch, sitting down in her antique chair which had once
belonged to Madame Blavatsky, again heard.</p>

<p>"Well, if that isn't Abibel again," she said. "Be quiet, naughty.
Perhaps we had better begin."</p>

<p>She recited the usual invocation to guides and angels, and leaned
back in her chair. Presently she began to twitch and mutter, and
shortly afterwards with several loud snorts, relapsed into cataleptic
immobility. There she lay, stiff as a poker, a port of call, so to
speak, for any voyaging intelligence. With pleased anticipation Mr.
Tilly awaited their coming. How gratifying if Napoleon, with whom he
had so often talked, recognised him and said, "Pleased to see you,
Mr. Tilly. I perceive you have joined us..." The room was dark
except for the ruby-shaded lamp in front of Cardinal Newman, but to
Mr. Tilly's emancipated perceptions the withdrawal of mere material
light made no difference, and he idly wondered why it was generally
supposed that disembodied spirits like himself produced their most
powerful effects in the dark. He could not imagine the reason for
that, and, what puzzled him still more, there was not to his
spiritual perception any sign of those colleagues of his (for so he
might now call them) who usually attended Mrs. Cumberbatch's
s&eacute;ances in such gratifying numbers. Though she had been
moaning and muttering a long time now, Mr. Tilly was in no way
conscious of the presence of Abibel and Sweet William and Sapphire
and Napoleon: "They ought to be here by now," he said to himself.</p>

<p>But while he still wondered at their absence, he saw to his amazed
disgust that the medium's hand, now covered with a black glove, and
thus invisible to ordinary human vision in the darkness, was groping
about the table and clearly searching for the megaphone-trumpet which
lay there. He found that he could read her mind with the same ease,
though far less satisfaction, as he had read Miss Ida's half an hour
ago, and knew that she was intending to apply the trumpet to her own
mouth and pretend to be Abibel or Semiramis or somebody, whereas she
affirmed that she never touched the trumpet herself. Much shocked at
this, he snatched up the trumpet himself, and observed that she was
not in trance at all, for she opened her sharp black eyes, which
always reminded him of buttons covered with American cloth, and gave
a great gasp.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Tilly!" she said. "On the spiritual plane too!"</p>

<p>The rest of the circle was now singing "Lead, kindly Light" in
order to encourage Cardinal Newman, and this conversation was
conducted under cover of the hoarse crooning voices. But Mr. Tilly
had the feeling that though Mrs. Cumberbatch saw and heard him as
clearly as he saw her, he was quite imperceptible to the others.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been killed," he said, "and I want to get into touch
with the material world. That's why I came here. But I want to get
into touch with other spirits too, and surely Abibel or Mespot ought
to be here by this time."</p>

<p>He received no answer, and her eyes fell before his like those of
a detected charlatan. A terrible suspicion invaded his mind.</p>

<p>"What? Are you a fraud, Mrs. Cumberbatch?" he asked. "Oh, for
shame! Think of all the guineas I have paid you."</p>

<p>"You shall have them all back," said Mrs. Cumberbatch. "But don't
tell of me."</p>

<p>She began to whimper, and he remembered that she often made that
sort of sniffling noise when Abibel was taking possession of her.</p>

<p>"That usually means that Abibel is coming," he said, with
withering sarcasm. "Come along, Abibel: we're waiting."</p>

<p>"Give me the trumpet," whispered the miserable medium. "Oh, please
give me the trumpet!"</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the kind," said Mr. Tilly indignantly. "I
would sooner use it myself."</p>

<p>She gave a sob of relief.</p>

<p>"Oh do, Mr. Tilly!" she said. "What a wonderful idea! It will be
most interesting to everybody to hear you talk just after you've been
killed and before they know. It would be the making of me! And I'm
not a fraud, at least not altogether. I do have spiritual perceptions
sometimes; spirits do communicate through me. And when they won't
come through it's a dreadful temptation to a poor woman to--to
supplement them by human agency. And how could I be seeing and
hearing you now, and be able to talk to you--so pleasantly, I'm
sure--if I hadn't super-normal powers? You've been killed, so you
assure me, and yet I can see and hear you quite plainly. Where did it
happen, may I ask, if it's not a painful subject?"</p>

<p>"Hyde Park Corner, half an hour ago," said Mr. Tilly. "No, it only
hurt for a moment, thanks."</p>

<p>"But about your other suggestion--"</p>

<p>While the third verse of "Lead, kindly Light" was going on, Mr.
Tilly applied his mind to this difficult situation. It was quite true
that if Mrs. Cumberbatch had no power of communication with the
unseen she could not possibly have seen him. But she evidently had,
and had heard him too, for their conversation had certainly been
conducted on the spirit-plane, with perfect lucidity.</p>

<p>Naturally, now that he was a genuine spirit, he did not want to be
mixed up in fraudulent mediumship, for he felt that such a thing
would seriously compromise him on the other side, where, probably, it
was widely known that Mrs. Cumberbatch was a person to be avoided.
But, on the other hand, having so soon found a medium through whom he
could communicate with his friends, it was hard to take a high moral
view, and say that he would have nothing whatever to do with her.</p>

<p>"I don't know if I trust you," he said. "I shouldn't have a
moment's peace if I thought that you would be sending all sorts of
bogus messages from me to the circle, which I wasn't responsible for
at all. You've done it with Abibel and Mespot. How can I know that
when I don't choose to communicate through you, you won't make up all
sorts of piffle on your own account?"</p>

<p>She positively squirmed in her chair.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll turn over a new leaf," she said. "I will leave all that
sort of thing behind me. And I am a medium. Look at me! Aren't I more
real to you than any of the others? Don't I belong to your plane in a
way that none of the others do? I may be occasionally fraudulent, and
I can no more get Napoleon here than I can fly, but I'm genuine as
well. Oh, Mr. Tilly, be indulgent to us poor human creatures! It
isn't so long since you were one of us yourself."</p>

<p>The mention of Napoleon, with the information that Mrs.
Cumberbatch had never been controlled by that great creature, wounded
Mr. Tilly again. Often in this darkened room he had held long
colloquies with him, and Napoleon had given him most interesting
details of his life on St. Helena, which, so Mr. Tilly had found,
were often borne out by Lord Rosebery's pleasant volume The Last
Phase. But now the whole thing wore a more sinister aspect, and
suspicion as solid as certainty bumped against his mind.</p>

<p>"Confess!" he said. "Where did you get all that Napoleon talk
from? You told us you had never read Lord Rosebery's book, and
allowed us to look through your library to see that it wasn't there.
Be honest for once, Mrs. Cumberbatch."</p>

<p>She suppressed a sob.</p>

<p>"I will," she said. "The book was there all the time. I put it
into an old cover called 'Elegant Extracts...' But I'm not wholly a
fraud. We're talking together, you a spirit and I a mortal female.
They can't hear us talk. But only look at me, and you'll see...You
can talk to them through me, if you'll only be so kind. I don't often
get in touch with a genuine spirit like yourself."</p>

<p>Mr. Tilly glanced at the other sitters and then back to the
medium, who, to keep the others interested, was making weird gurgling
noises like an undervitalised siphon. Certainly she was far clearer
to him than were the others, and her argument that she was able to
see and hear him had great weight. And then a new and curious
perception came to him. Her mind seemed spread out before him like a
pool of slightly muddy water, and he figured himself as standing on a
header-board above it, perfectly able, if he chose, to immerse
himself in it. The objection to so doing was its muddiness, its
materiality; the reason for so doing was that he felt that then he
would be able to be heard by the others, possibly to be seen by them,
certainly to come into touch with them. As it was, the loudest bangs
on the table were only faintly perceptible.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to understand," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Tilly! Just jump in like a kind good spirit," she said.
"Make your own test-conditions.</p>

<p>"Put your hand over my mouth to make sure that I'm not speaking,
and keep hold of the trumpet."</p>

<p>"And you'll promise not to cheat any more?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>He made up his mind.</p>

<p>"All right then," he said, and, so to speak, dived into her
mind.</p>

<p>He experienced the oddest sensation. It was like passing out of
some fine, sunny air into the stuffiest of unventilated rooms. Space
and time closed over him again: his head swam, his eyes were heavy.
Then, with the trumpet in one hand, he laid the other firmly over her
mouth.</p>

<p>Looking round, he saw that the room seemed almost completely dark,
but that the outline of the figures sitting round the table had
vastly gained in solidity.</p>

<p>"Here I am!" he said briskly.</p>

<p>Miss Soulsby gave a startled exclamation.</p>

<p>"That's Mr. Tilly's voice!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Why, of course it is," said Mr. Tilly. "I've just passed over at
Hyde Park Corner under a traction engine..."</p>

<p>He felt the dead weight of the medium's mind, her conventional
conceptions, her mild, unreal piety pressing in on him from all
sides, stifling and confusing him. Whatever he said had to pass
through muddy water...</p>

<p>"There's a wonderful feeling of joy and lightness," he said. "I
can't tell you of the sunshine and happiness. We're all very busy and
active, helping others. And it's such a pleasure, dear friends, to be
able to get into touch with you all again. Death is not death: it is
the gate of life..."</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't stand this," he said to the medium. "You make me talk
such twaddle. Do get your stupid mind out of the way. Can't we do
anything in which you won't interfere with me so much?"</p>

<p>"Can you give us some spirit lights round the room?" suggested
Mrs. Cumberbatch in a sleepy voice. "You have come through
beautifully, Mr. Tilly. It's too dear of you!"</p>

<p>"You're sure you haven't arranged some phosphorescent patches
already?" asked Mr. Tilly suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Yes, there are one or two near the chimney-piece," said Mrs.
Cumberbatch, "but none anywhere else. Dear Mr. Tilly, I swear there
are not. Just give us a nice star with long rays on the ceiling!"</p>

<p>Mr. Tilly was the most good-natured of men, always willing to help
an unattractive female in distress, and whispering to her, "I shall
require the phosphorescent patches to be given into my hands after
the s&eacute;ance," he proceeded, by the mere effort of his
imagination, to light a beautiful big star with red and violet rays
on the ceiling. Of course it was not nearly as brilliant as his own
conception of it, for its light had to pass through the opacity of
the medium's mind, but it was still a most striking object, and
elicited gasps of applause from the company. To enhance the effect of
it he intoned a few very pretty lines about a star by Adelaide Anne
Procter, whose poems had always seemed to him to emanate from the
topmost peak of Parnassus.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Mr. Tilly!" whispered the medium. "It was lovely!
Would a photograph of it be permitted on some future occasion, if you
would be so kind as to reproduce it again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Mr. Tilly irritably. "I want to get out.
I'm very hot and uncomfortable. And it's all so cheap."</p>

<p>"Cheap?" ejaculated Mrs. Cumberbatch. "Why, there's not a medium
in London whose future wouldn't be made by a real genuine star like
that, say, twice a week."</p>

<p>"But I wasn't run over in order that I might make the fortune of
mediums," said Mr. Tilly. "I want to go: it's all rather degrading.
And I want to see something of my new world. I don't know what it's
like yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Mr. Tilly," said she. "You told us lovely things about
it, how busy and happy you were."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. It was you who said that, at least it was you who
put it into my head."</p>

<p>Even as he wished, he found himself emerging from the dull waters
of Mrs. Cumberbatch's mind.</p>

<p>"There's the whole new world waiting for me," he said. "I must go
and see it. I'll come back and tell you, for it must be full of
marvellous revelations..."</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt the hopelessness of it. There was that thick
fluid of materiality to pierce, and, as it dripped off him again, he
began to see that nothing of that fine rare quality of life which he
had just begun to experience, could penetrate these opacities. That
was why, perhaps, all that thus came across from the spirit-world,
was so stupid, so banal. They, of whom he now was one, could tap on
furniture, could light stars, could abound with commonplace, could
read as in a book the mind of medium or sitters, but nothing more.
They had to pass into the region of gross perceptions, in order to be
seen of blind eyes and be heard of deaf ears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cumberbatch stirred.</p>

<p>"The power is failing," she said, in a deep voice, which Mr. Tilly
felt was meant to imitate his own. "I must leave you now, dear
friends--"</p>

<p>He felt much exasperated.</p>

<p>"The power isn't failing," he shouted. "It wasn't I who said
that."</p>

<p>Besides, I have got to see if it's true. Good-bye: don't cheat any
more.</p>

<p>He dropped his card of admittance to the seance on the table and
heard murmurs of excitement as he floated off.</p>

<p>The news of the wonderful star, and the presence of Mr. Tilly at
the s&eacute;ance within half an hour of his death, which at the time
was unknown to any of the sitters, spread swiftly through
spiritualistic circles. The Psychical Research Society sent
investigators to take independent evidence from all those present,
but were inclined to attribute the occurrence to a subtle mixture of
thought-transference and unconscious visual impression, when they
heard that Miss Soulsby had, a few minutes previously, seen a
news-board in the street outside recording the accident at Hyde Park
Corner. This explanation was rather elaborate, for it postulated that
Miss Soulsby, thinking of Mr. Tilly's non-arrival, had combined that
with the accident at Hyde Park Corner, and had probably (though
unconsciously) seen the name of the victim on another news-board and
had transferred the whole by telepathy to the mind of the medium. As
for the star on the ceiling, though they could not account for it,
they certainly found remains of phosphorescent paint on the panels of
the wall above the chimney-piece, and came to the conclusion that the
star had been produced by some similar contrivance. So they rejected
the whole thing, which was a pity, since, for once, the phenomena
were absolutely genuine.</p>

<p>Miss Soulsby continued to be a constant attendant at Mrs.
Cumberbatch's s&eacute;ances, but never experienced the presence of
Mr. Tilly again. On that the reader may put any interpretation he
pleases. It looks to me somewhat as if he had found something else to
do.</p>

<p>But he had emerged too far, and perceived that nobody except the
medium heard him.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be vexed, Mr. Tilly," she said. "That's only a formula.
But you're leaving us very soon. Not time for just one
materialisation? They are more convincing than anything to most
inquirers."</p>

<p>"Not one," said he. "You don't understand how stifling it is even
to speak through you and make stars. But I'll come back as soon as I
find there's anything new that I can get through to you. What's the
use of my repeating all that stale stuff about being busy and happy?
They've been told that often enough already."</p>
