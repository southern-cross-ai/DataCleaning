<h1>The Villa Lucienne</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Ella D'Arcy</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Madame Koetlegon told the story, and told it so well that her
audience seemed to know the sombre alley, the neglected garden, the
shuttered house, as intimately as though they had visited it
themselves, seemed to feel a faint reverberation of the
incommunicable thrill which she had felt--which the surly guardian,
the torn rag of lace, the closed pavilion had made her feel. And yet,
as you will see, there is in reality no story at all; it is merely an
account of how, when in the Riviera two winters ago, she went with
some friends to look over a furnished villa, which one of them
thought of taking.</p>

<p>It was afternoon when we started on our expedition, Madame de M--,
C&eacute;cile her widowed daughter-in-law, and I. C&eacute;cile's
little girl Ren&eacute;e, the nurse, and M&eacute;dor, the boarhound
of which poor Guy had been so inordinately fond, dawdled after us up
the steep and sunny road.</p>

<p>The December day was deliciously blue and warm. C&eacute;cile took
off her furs and carried them over her arm. We only put down our
sunshades when a screen of olive-trees on the left interposed their
grey-green foliage between us and the sunshine.</p>

<p>Up in these trees barefooted men armed with bamboos were beating
the branches to knock down the fruit; and three generations of women,
grandmothers, wives, and children, knelt in the grass, gathering up
the little purplish olives into baskets. All these paused to follow
us with black persistent eyes, as we passed by; but the men went on
working, unmoved. The tap-tapping, swish-swishing, of their light
sticks against the boughs played a characteristically southern
accompaniment to our desultory talk.</p>

<p>We were reasonably happy, pleasantly exhilarated by the beauty of
the weather and the scene.</p>

<p>Ren&eacute;e and M&eacute;dor, with shrill laughter and
deep-mouthed joy-notes, played together the whole way. And when the
garden wall, which now replaced the olive-trees upon our right, gave
place to a couple of iron gates standing open upon a broad straight
drive, and we, looking up between the overarching palm-trees and
cocoanuts, saw a white, elegant, sun-bathed house at the end,
C&eacute;cile jumped to the conclusion that here was the Villa
Lucienne, and that nowhere else could she find a house which on the
face of it would suit her better.</p>

<p>But the woman who came to greet us, the jocund, brown-faced young
woman, with the superb abundance of bosom beneath her crossed
neckerchief of orange-coloured wool, told us no; this was the Villa
Soleil (appropriate name!) and belonged to Monsieur Morgera, the
deputy, who was now in Paris. was higher up; she pointed vaguely
behind her through the house; a long walk round by the road. But if
these ladies did not mind a path which was a trifle damp perhaps,
owing to Monday's rain, they would find themselves in five minutes at
the Villa, for the two houses in reality were not more than a stone's
throw apart.</p>

<p>She conducted us across a spacious garden golden with sunshine,
lyric with bird-song, brilliant with flowers, where eucalyptus,
mimosa, and tea-roses interwove their strong and subtle perfumes
through the air, to an angle in a remote laurel hedge. Here she
stooped to pull aside some ancient pine-boughs which ineffectually
closed the entrance to a dark and trellised walk.</p>

<p>Peering up at it, it seemed to stretch away interminably into
green gloom, the ground rising a little all the while, and the
steepness of the ascent being modified every here and there by a
couple of rotting wooden steps.</p>

<p>We were to go up this alley, our guide told us, and we would be
sure to find Laurent at the top.</p>

<p>Laurent, she explained to us, was the gardener who lived at the
Villa Lucienne and showed it to visitors. But there were not many who
came, although it had been to let an immense time, ever since the
death of old Madame Gray, and that had occurred before she, the
speaker, had come south with the Morgeras. We were to explain to
Laurent that we had been sent up from the Villa Soleil, and then it
would be all right. For he sometimes used the alley himself, as it
gave him a short cut into Antibes; but the passage had been blocked
up many years ago, to prevent the Morgera children running into
it.</p>

<p>Oh, Madame was very kind, it was no trouble at all, and of course
if these ladies liked they could return by the alley also; but once
they found themselves at the Villa they would be close to the upper
road, which they would probably prefer. Then came her cordial voice
calling after C&eacute;cile, 'Madame had best put on her furs again,
it is cold in there.'</p>

<p>It was cold and damp too, with the damp coldness of places where
sun and wind never penetrate. It was so narrow that we had to walk in
single file. The walls on either hand, the low roof above our heads,
were formed of trellised woodwork dropping into complete decay. But
roof and walls might have been removed altogether, and the tunnel
nevertheless would still have retained its shape; for the creepers
which overgrew it had with time developed gnarled trunks and
branches, which formed a second natural tunnelling outside. Through
the broken places in the woodwork we could see the thick,
inextricably twisted stems; and beyond again was a tangled matting of
greenery, that suffered no drop of sunlight to trickle through. The
ground was covered with lichens, deathstools, and a spongy moss
exuding water beneath the foot, and one had the consciousness that
the whole place, floor, walls, and roof, must creep with the
repulsive, slimy, running life, which pullulates in dark and solitary
places.</p>

<p>The change from the gay and scented garden to this dull alley,
heavy with the smells of moisture and decay, was curiously
depressing. We followed each other in silence; first C&eacute;cile;
then Ren&eacute;e clinging to her nurse's hand, with M&eacute;dor
pressing close against them; Madame de M---next; and I brought up the
rear.</p>

<p>You would have pronounced it impossible to find in any southern
garden so sombre a place, but that, after all, it is only in the
south that such extraordinary contrasts of gaiety and gloom ever
present themselves.</p>

<p>The sudden tearing away of a portion of one of the wooden steps
beneath my tread startled us all, and the circular scatter of an
immense colony of woodlice that had formed its habitat in the
crevices of the wood, filled me with shivering disgust. I was
exceedingly glad when we emerged from the tunnel upon daylight again
and the Villa.</p>

<p>Upon daylight, but not upon sunlight, for the small garden in
which we found ourselves was ringed round by the compact tops of the
umbrella-pines which climbed the hill on every side.</p>

<p>The site had been chosen, of course, on account of the magnificent
view which we knew must be obtainable from the Villa windows, though
from where we stood we could see nothing but the dark trees, the wild
garden, the overshadowed house. And we saw none of these things very
distinctly, for our attention was focussed on a man standing there in
the middle of the garden, knee-deep in the grass, evidently awaiting
us.</p>

<p>He was a short, thick-set peasant, dressed in the immensely wide
blue velveteen trousers, the broad crimson sash, and the flannel
shirt, open at the throat, which are customary in these parts.</p>

<p>He was strong-necked as a bull, dark as a mulatto, and his
curling, grizzled hair was thickly matted over his head and face and
breast. He wore a flat knitted cap, and held the inevitable cigarette
between his lips, but he made no attempt to remove one or the other
at our approach. He stood stolid, silent, his hands thrust deep into
his pockets, staring at us, and shifting from one to another his
suspicious and truculent little eyes.</p>

<p>So far as I was concerned, and though the Villa had proved a
palace, I should have preferred abandoning the quest at once to going
over it in his company; but C&eacute;cile addressed him with intrepid
politeness.</p>

<p>'We had been permitted to come up from the Villa Soleil. We
understood that the Villa Lucienne was to let furnished; if so, might
we look over it?'</p>

<p>From his heavy, expressionless expression, one might have supposed
that the very last thing he expected or desired was to find a tenant
for the Villa, and I thought with relief that he was going to refuse
C&eacute;cile's request. But, after a longish pause:</p>

<p>'Yes, you can see it,' he said, grudgingly, and turned from us, to
disappear into the lower part of the house.</p>

<p>We looked into each other's disconcerted faces, then round the
grey and shadowy garden: a garden long since gone to ruin, with paths
and flower-beds inextricably mingled, with docks and nettles choking
up the rose-trees run wild, with wind-planted weeds growing from the
stone vases on the terrace, with grasses pushing between the marble
steps leading up to the hall door.</p>

<p>In the middle of the lawn a terra-cotta faun, tumbled from his
pedestal, grinned sardonically up from amidst the tangled greenery,
and Madame de M---began to quote:</p>

<p>'Un vieux faune en terre-cuite</p>

<p>Rit au centre des boulingrins.</p>

<p>Pr&eacute;sageant sans doute une fuite</p>

<p>De ces instants sereins</p>

<p>Qui m'ont conduit et t'ont conduit. . .'</p>

<p>The Villa itself was as dilapidated, as mournful-looking as the
garden. The ground-floor alone gave signs of occupation, in a checked
shirt spread out upon a window-ledge to dry, in a worn besom, an
earthenware pipkin, and a pewter jug, ranged against the wall. But
the upper part, with the yellow plaster crumbling from the walls, the
grey painted persiennes all monotonously closed, said with a thousand
voices it was never opened, never entered, had not been lived in for
years.</p>

<p>Our surly gardener reappeared, carrying some keys. He led the way
up the steps. We exchanged mute questions; all desire to inspect the
Villa was gone. But C&eacute;cile is a woman of character: she
devoted herself.</p>

<p>'I'll just run up and see what it is like,' she said; 'it's not
worth while you should tire yourself too, Mamma. You, all, wait
here.'</p>

<p>We stood at the foot of the steps; Laurent was already at the top.
C&eacute;cile began to mount lightly towards him, but before she was
half-way she turned, and to our surprise, 'I wish you would come up,
all of you,' she said, and stopped there until we joined her.</p>

<p>Laurent fitted a key to the door, and it opened with a shriek of
rusty hinges. As he followed us, pulling it to behind him, we found
ourselves in total darkness. I assure you I went through a bad
quarter of a minute.</p>

<p>Then we heard the turning of a handle, an inner door was opened,
and in the semi-daylight of closed shutters we saw the man's squat
figure going from us down a long, old-fashioned, vacant drawing-room
towards two windows at the further end.</p>

<p>At the same instant Ren&eacute;e burst into tears:</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't like it. Oh, I'm frightened!' she sobbed.</p>

<p>'Little goosie!' said her grandmother, 'see, it's quite light
now!' for Laurent had pushed back the persiennes, and a magical
panorama had sprung into view: the whole range of the mountains
behind Nice, their snow-caps suffused with a heavenly rose colour by
the setting sun.</p>

<p>But Ren&eacute;e only clutched tighter at Madame de M--'s gown,
and wept:</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't like it, Bonnemaman! She is looking at me still. I
want to go home!'</p>

<p>'No one is looking at you,' her grandmother told her: 'talk to
your friend M&eacute;dor. He'll take care of you.'</p>

<p>But Ren&eacute;e whispered:</p>

<p>'He wouldn't come in; he's frightened too.'</p>

<p>And, listening, we heard the dog's impatient and complaining bark
calling to us from the garden.</p>

<p>C&eacute;cile sent Ren&eacute;e and the nurse to join him, and
while Laurent let them out, we stepped on to the terrace, and for a
moment our hearts were eased by the incomparable beauty of the view,
for, raised now above the tree-tops, we looked over the admirable
bay, the illimitable sky; we feasted our eyes upon unimaginable
colour, upon matchless form. We were almost prepared to declare that
the possession of the Villa was a piece of good fortune not to be let
slip, when we heard a step behind us, and turned to see Laurent
surveying us morosely from the window threshold, and again to
experience the oppression of his ungenial personality.</p>

<p>Under his guidance we now inspected the century-old furniture, the
faded silks, the tarnished gilt, the ragged brocades which had once
embellished the room. The oval mirrors were dim with mildew, the
parquet floor might have been a mere piece of grey drugget, so thick
was the overlying dust. Curtains, yellowish, ropey, of undeterminable
material, hung forlornly where once they had draped windows and
doors.</p>

<p>Originally they may have been of rose satin, for there were traces
of rose colour still on the walls and the ceiling, painted in gay
southern fashion with loves and doves, festoons of flowers, and knots
of ribbons. But these paintings were all fragmentary, indistinct,
seeming to lose sequence and outline the more diligently you tried to
decipher them.</p>

<p>Yet you could not fail to see that when first furnished the room
must have been charming and coquettish. I wondered for whom it had
been thus arranged, why it had been thus abandoned. For there grew
upon me, I cannot tell you why, the curious conviction that the last
inhabitant of the room having casually left it, had, from some
unexpected obstacle, never again returned. They were but the merest
trifles that created this idea: the tiny heap of brown ash which lay
on a marble gu&eacute;ridon, the few withered twigs in the vase
beside it, speaking of the last rose plucked from the garden; the big
berceuse chair drawn out beside the sculptured mantelpiece which
seemed to retain the impression of the last occupant; and in the dark
recesses of the unclosed hearth the smouldering heat which my fancy
detected in the half-charred logs of wood.</p>

<p>The other rooms in the Villa resembled the salon; each time our
surly guide opened the shutters we saw a repetition of the ancient
furniture, of the faded decoration; everything dust-covered and
time-decayed. Nor in these other rooms was any sign of former
occupation to be seen, until, caught upon the girandole of a
pier-glass, a long ragged fragment of lace took my eye; an
exquisitely fine and cobwebby piece of lace, as though caught and
torn from some gala shawl or flounce, as the wearer had hurried
by.</p>

<p>It was odd perhaps to see this piece of lace caught thus, but not
odd enough surely to account for the strange emotion which seized
hold of me: an overwhelming pity, succeeded by an overwhelming fear.
I had had a momentary intention to point the lace out to the others,
but a glance at Laurent froze the words on my lips. Never in my life
have I experienced such a paralysing fear. I was filled with an
intense desire to get away from the man and from the Villa.</p>

<p>But Madame de M--, looking from the window, had noticed a pavilion
standing isolated in the garden. She inquired if it were to be let
with the house. He gave a surly assent. Then she supposed we could
visit it. No, said the man, that was impossible. C&eacute;cile
pointed out it was only right that tenants should see the whole of
the premises for which they would have to pay, but he refused this
time with so much rudeness, his little brutish eyes narrowed with so
much malignancy, that the panic which I had just experienced now
seized the others, and it was a sauve-qui-peut.</p>

<p>We gathered up Ren&eacute;e, nurse, and M&eacute;dor in our hasty
passage through the garden, and found our way unguided to the gate
upon the upper road.</p>

<p>At once at large beneath the serene evening sky, winding slowly
westward down the olive-bordered ways: 'What an odious old ruffian!'
said one; 'What an eerie, uncanny place!' said another. We compared
notes. We found that each of us had been conscious of the same
immense, the same inexplicable sense of fear.</p>

<p>C&eacute;cile, the least nervous of women, had felt it the first.
It had laid hold of her when going up the steps to the door, and it
had been so real a terror, she explained to us, that if we had not
joined her she would have turned back. Nothing could have induced her
to enter the Villa alone.</p>

<p>Madame de M--'s account was that her mind had been more or less
troubled from the first moment of entering the garden, but that when
the man refused us access to the pavilion, it had been suddenly
invaded by a most intolerable sense of wrong. Being very imaginative
(poor Guy undoubtedly derived his extraordinary gifts from her),
Madame de M---was convinced that the gardener had murdered some one
and buried the body inside the pavilion.</p>

<p>But for me it was not so much the personality of the man--although
I admitted he was unprepossessing enough--as the Villa itself which
inspired fear. Fear seemed to exude from the walls, to dim the
mirrors with its clammy breath, to stir shudderingly among the
tattered draperies, to impregnate the whole atmosphere as with an
essence, a gas, a contagious disease.</p>

<p>You fought it off for a shorter or longer time, according to your
powers of resistance, but you were bound to succumb to it at last.
The oppressive and invisible fumes had laid hold of us one after the
other, and the incident of the closed pavilion had raised our terrors
to a ludicrous pitch.</p>

<p>Nurse's experiences, which she gave us a day or two later,
supported this view. For she told us that when Ren&eacute;e began to
cry, and she took her hand to lead her out, all at once she felt
quite nervous and uncomfortable too, as though the little one's
trouble had passed by touch into her.</p>

<p>'And what is very strange,' said she, 'when we reached the garden,
there was M&eacute;dor, his forepaws planted firmly on the ground,
his whole body rigid, and his hair bristling all along his backbone
from end to end.'</p>

<p>Nurse was convinced that both the child and the dog had seen
something which we others could not see.</p>

<p>This reminded us of a word of Ren&eacute;e's, a very curious
word:</p>

<p>'I don't like it, she is looking at me still,'--and C&eacute;cile
undertook to question her.</p>

<p>'You remember, Ren&eacute;e, when mother took you the other day to
look over the pretty Villa---Ren&eacute;e opened wide apprehensive
eyes.</p>

<p>'Why did you cry?'</p>

<p>'I was frightened at the lady,' she whispered.</p>

<p>'The lady...where was the lady?' C&eacute;cile asked her.</p>

<p>'She was in the drawing-room, sitting in the big chair.'</p>

<p>'Was she an old lady like grandmamma, or a young lady like
mother?'</p>

<p>'She was like Bonnemaman,' said Ren&eacute;e, and her little mouth
began to quiver.</p>

<p>'And what did she do?'</p>

<p>'She got up and began to--to come--'</p>

<p>But here Ren&eacute;e again burst into tears. And as she is a very
nervous, a very excitable child, we had to drop the subject.</p>

<p>But what it all meant, whether there was anything in the history
of the house or of its guardian which could account for our
sensations, we never knew. We made inquiries, of course, concerning
Laurent and the Villa Lucienne, but we learned very little, and that
little was so vague, so remote, so irrelevant, that it does not seem
worth while repeating.</p>

<p>The indisputable fact is the overwhelming fear which the adventure
awoke in each and all of us; and this effect is impossible to
describe, being just the crystallisation of one of those subtle,
unformulated emotions in which only poor Guy himself could have hoped
to succeed.</p>
