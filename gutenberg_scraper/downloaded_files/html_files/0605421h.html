<h2><a name="ch1"></a>The Dead Smile</h2>

<h3>Chapter i</h3>

<p>SIR HUGH OCKRAM smiled as he sat by the open window of his study,
in the late August afternoon. A curiously yellow cloud obscured the
low sun, and the clear summer light turned lurid, as if it had been
suddenly poisoned and polluted by the foul vapours of a plague. Sir
Hugh's face seemed, at best, to be made of fine parchment drawn
skin-tight over a wooden mask, in which two sunken eyes peered from
far within. The eyes peered from under wrinkled lids, alive and
watchful like toads in their holes, side by side and exactly alike.
But as the light changed, a little yellow glare flashed in each. He
smiled, stretching pale lips across discoloured teeth in an
expression of profound self-satisfaction, blended with the most
unforgiving hatred and contempt for the human doll.</p>

<p>Nurse Macdonald, who was a hundred years old, said that when Sir
Hugh smiled he saw the faces of two women in hell--two dead women he
had betrayed. The smile widened.</p>

<p>The hideous disease of which Sir Hugh was dying had touched his
brain. His son stood beside him, tall, white and delicate as an angel
in a primitive picture. And though there was deep distress in his
violet eyes as he looked at his father's face, he felt the shadow of
that sickening smile stealing across his own lips, parting and
drawing them against his will. It was like a bad dream, for he tried
not to smile and smiled the more.</p>

<p>Beside him--strangely like him in her wan, angelic beauty, with
the same shadowy golden hair, the same sad violet eyes, the same
luminously pale face--Evelyn Warburton rested one hand upon his arm.
As she looked into her uncle's eyes, she could not turn her own away
and she too knew that the deathly smile was hovering on her own red
lips, drawing them tightly across her little teeth, while two bright
tears ran down her cheeks to her mouth, and dropped from the upper to
the lower lip. The smile was like the shadow of death and the seal of
damnation upon her pure, young face.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Sir Hugh very slowly, still looking out at the
trees, "if you have made your mind up to be married, I cannot hinder
you, and I don't suppose you attach the smallest importance to my
consent--"</p>

<p>"Father!" exclaimed Gabriel reproachfully.</p>

<p>"No. I do not deceive myself," continued the old man, smiling
terribly. "You will marry when I am dead, though there is a very good
reason why you had better not--why you had better not," he repeated
very emphatically, and he slowly turned his toad eyes upon the
lovers.</p>

<p>"What reason?" asked Evelyn in a frightened voice.</p>

<p>"Never mind the reason, my dear. You will marry just as if it did
not exist." There was a long pause. "Two gone," he said, his voice
lowering strangely, "and two more will be four all together forever
and ever, burning, burning, burning bright."</p>

<p>At the last words his head sank slowly back, and the little glare
of his toad eyes disappeared under the swollen lids. Sir Hugh had
fallen asleep, as he often did in his illness, even while
speaking.</p>

<p>Gabriel Ockram drew Evelyn away, and from the study they went out
into the dim hall. Softly closing the door behind them, each audibly
drew a breath, as though some sudden danger had been passed. As they
laid their hands each in the other's, their strangely-like eyes met
in a long look in which love and perfect understanding were darkened
by the secret terror of an unknown thing. Their pale faces reflected
each other's fear.</p>

<p>"It is his secret," said Evelyn at last. "He will never tell us
what it is."</p>

<p>"If he dies with it," answered Gabriel, "let it be on his own
head!"</p>

<p>"On his head!" echoed the dim hall. It was a strange echo. Some
were frightened by it, for they said that if it were a real echo it
should repeat everything and not give back a phrase here and
there--now speaking, now silent. Nurse Macdonald said that the great
hall would never echo a prayer when an Ockram was to die, though it
would give back curses ten for one.</p>

<p>"On his head!" it repeated quite softly, and Evelyn started and
looked round.</p>

<p>"It is only the echo," said Gabriel, leading her away.</p>

<p>They went out into the late afternoon light, and sat upon a stone
seat behind the chapel, which had been built across the end of the
east wing. It was very still. Not a breath stirred, and there was no
sound near them. Only far off in the park a song-bird was whistling
the high prelude to the evening chorus.</p>

<p>"It is very lonely here," said Evelyn, taking Gabriel's hand
nervously and speaking as if she dreaded to disturb the silence. "If
it were dark, I should be afraid."</p>

<p>"Of what? Of me?" Gabriel's sad eyes turned to her.</p>

<p>"Oh no! Never of you! But of the old Ockrams. They say they are
just under our feet here in the north vault outside the chapel, all
in their shrouds, with no coffins, as they used to bury them."</p>

<p>"As they always will. As they will bury my father, and me. They
say an Ockram will not lie in a coffin."</p>

<p>"But it cannot be true. These are fairy tales, ghost stories!"
Evelyn nestled nearer to her companion, grasping his hand more
tightly as the sun began to go down.</p>

<p>"Of course. But there is the story of old Sir Vernon, who was
beheaded for treason under James II. The family brought his body back
from the scaffold in an iron coffin with heavy locks and put it in
the north vault. But ever afterwards, whenever the vault was opened
to bury another of the family, they found the coffin wide open, the
body standing upright against the wall, and the head rolled away in a
corner smiling at it."</p>

<p>"As Uncle Hugh smiles?" Evelyn shivered.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so," answered Gabriel, thoughtfully. "Of course I
never saw it, and the vault has not been opened for thirty years.
None of us have died since then."</p>

<p>"And if...if Uncle Hugh dies, shall you...?" Evelyn stopped. Her
beautiful thin face was quite white.</p>

<p>"Yes. I shall see him laid there too, with his secret, whatever it
is." Gabriel sighed and pressed the girl's little hand.</p>

<p>"I do not like to think of it," she said unsteadily. "O Gabriel,
what can the secret be? He said we had better not marry. Not that he
forbade it, but he said it so strangely, and he smiled. Ugh!" Her
small white teeth chattered with fear, and she looked over her
shoulder while drawing still closer to Gabriel. "And, somehow, I felt
it in my own face."</p>

<p>"So did I," answered Gabriel in a low, nervous voice. "Nurse
Macdonald..." He stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"What? What did she</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. She has told me things...They would frighten you,
dear. Come, it is growing chilly." He rose, but Evelyn held his hand
in both of hers, still sitting and looking up into his face.</p>

<p>"But we shall be married just the same--Gabriel! Say that we
shall!"</p>

<p>"Of course, darling, of course. But while my father is so very
ill, it is impossible--"</p>

<p>"O Gabriel, Gabriel, dear! I wish we were married now!" Evelyn
cried in sudden distress. "I know that something will prevent it and
keep us apart."</p>

<p>"Nothing shall!"</p>

<p>"Nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing human," said Gabriel Ockram, as she drew him down to
her.</p>

<p>And their faces, that were so strangely alike, met and touched.
Gabriel knew that the kiss had a marvelous savor of evil. Evelyn's
lips were like the cool breath of a sweet and mortal fear that
neither of them understood, for they were innocent and young. Yet she
drew him to her by her lightest touch, as a sensitive plant shivers,
waves its thin leaves, and bends and closes softly upon what it
wants. He let himself be drawn to her willingly--as he would even if
her touch had been deadly and poisonous--for he strangely loved that
half voluptuous breath of fear, and he passionately desired the
nameless evil something that lurked in her maiden lips.</p>

<p>"It is as if we loved in a strange dream," she said.</p>

<p>"I fear the waking," he murmured.</p>

<p>"We shall not wake, dear. When the dream is over it will have
already turned into death, so softly that we shall not know it. But
until then..."</p>

<p>She paused, her eyes seeking his, as their faces slowly came
nearer. It was as if each had thoughts in their lips that foresaw and
foreknew the other.</p>

<p>"Until then," she said again, very low, her mouth near to his.</p>

<p>"Dream--till then," he murmured.</p>

<h3>Chapter ii</h3>

<p>NURSE MACDONALD slept sitting all bent together in a great old
leather arm chair with wings--many warm blankets wrapped about her,
even in summer. She would rest her feet in a bag footstool lined with
sheepskin while beside her, on a wooden table, there was a little
lamp that burned at night, and an old silver cup, in which there was
always something to drink.</p>

<p>Her face was very wrinkled, but the wrinkles were so small and
fine and close together that they made shadows instead of lines. Two
thin locks of hair, that were turning from white to a smoky yellow,
fell over her temples from under her starched white cap. Every now
and then she would wake from her slumber, her eyelids drawn up in
tiny folds like little pink silk curtains, and her queer blue eyes
would look straight ahead through doors and walls and worlds to a far
place beyond. Then she'd sleep again with her hands one upon the
other on the edge of the blanket, her thumbs grown longer than the
fingers with age.</p>

<p>It was nearly one o'clock in the night, and the summer breeze was
blowing the ivy branch against the panes of the window with a hushing
caress. In the small room beyond, with the door ajar, the young maid
who took care of Nurse Macdonald was fast asleep. All was very quiet.
The old woman breathed regularly, and her drawn lips trembled each
time the breath went out.</p>

<p>But outside the closed window there was a face. Violet eyes were
looking steadily at the ancient sleeper. Strange, as there were
eighty feet from the sill of the window to the foot of the tower. It
was like the face of Evelyn Warburton, yet the cheeks were thinner
than Evelyn's and as white as a gleam. The eyes stared and the lips
were red with life. They were dead lips painted with new blood.</p>

<p>Slowly Nurse Macdonald's wrinkled eyelids folded back, and she
looked straight at the face at the window.</p>

<p>"Is it time?" she asked in her little old, faraway voice.</p>

<p>While she looked the face at the window changed, the eyes opened
wider and wider till the white glared all round the bright violet and
the bloody lips opened over gleaming teeth. The shadowy golden hair
surrounding the face rose and streamed against the window in the
night breeze and in answer to Nurse Macdonald's question came a sound
that froze the living flesh.</p>

<p>It was a low-moaning voice, one that rose suddenly, like the
scream of storm. Then it went from a moan to a wail, from a wail to a
howl, and from a howl to the shriek of the tortured dead. He who has
heard it before knows, and he can bear witness that the cry of the
banshee is an evil cry to hear alone in the deep night.</p>

<p>When it was over and the face was gone, Nurse Macdonald shook a
little in her great chair. She looked at the black square of the
window, but there was nothing more there, nothing but the night and
the whispering ivy branch. She turned her head to the door that was
ajar, and there stood the young maid in her white gown, her teeth
chattering with fright.</p>

<p>"It is time, child," said Nurse Macdonald. "I must go to him, for
it is the end."</p>

<p>She rose slowly, leaning her withered hands upon the arms of the
chair as the girl brought her a woollen gown, a great mantle and her
crutch-stick. But very often the girl looked at the window and was
unjointed with fear, and often Nurse Macdonald shook her head and
said words which the maid could not understand.</p>

<p>"It was like the face of Miss Evelyn," said the girl,
trembling.</p>

<p>But the ancient woman looked up sharply and angrily. Her queer
blue eyes glared. She held herself up by the arm of the great chair
with her left hand, and lifted up her crutch--stick to strike the
maid with all her might. But she did not.</p>

<p>"You are a good girl," she said, "but you are a fool. Pray for
wit, child. Pray for wit--or else find service in a house other than
Ockram Hall. Now bring the lamp and help me up."</p>

<p>Each step Nurse Macdonald took was a labour in itself, and as she
moved, the maid's slippers clappered alongside. By the clacking noise
the other servants knew that she was coming, very long before they
saw her.</p>

<p>No one was sleeping now, and there were lights, and whisperings,
and pale faces in the corridors near Sir Hugh's bedroom. Often
someone would go in, and someone would come out, but every one made
way for Nurse Macdonald, who had nursed Sir Hugh's father more than
eighty years ago.</p>

<p>The light was soft and clear in the room. Gabriel Ockram stood by
his father's bedside, and there knelt Evelyn Warburton--her hair
lying like a golden shadow down her shoulder, and her hands clasped
nervously together. Opposite Gabriel, a nurse was trying to make Sir
Hugh drink, but he would not. His lips parted, but his teeth were
set. He was very, very thin now, and as his eyes caught the light
sideways, they were as yellow coals.</p>

<p>"Do not torment him," said Nurse Macdonald to the woman who held
the cup. "Let me speak to him, for his hour is come."</p>

<p>"Let her speak to him," said Gabriel in a dull voice.</p>

<p>The ancient nurse leaned to the pillow and laid the feather-weight
of her withered hand--that was like a grown moth--upon Sir Hugh's
yellow fingers. Then she spoke to him earnestly, while only Gabriel
and Evelyn were left in the room to hear.</p>

<p>"Hugh Ockram," she said, "this is the end of your life; and as I
saw you born, and saw your father born before you, I come to see you
die. Hugh Ockram, will you tell me the truth?"</p>

<p>The dying man recognized the little faraway voice he had known all
his life and he very slowly turned his yellow face to Nurse
Macdonald, but he said nothing. Then she spoke again.</p>

<p>"Hugh Ockram, you will never see the daylight again. Will you tell
the truth?"</p>

<p>His toad like eyes were not yet dull. They fastened themselves on
her face.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" he asked, each word sounding more hollow
than the last. "I have no secrets. I have lived a good life."</p>

<p>Nurse Macdonald laughed--a tiny, cracked laugh that made her old
head bob and tremble a little, as if her neck were on a steel spring.
But Sir Hugh's eyes grew red, and his pale lips began to twist.</p>

<p>"Let me die in peace," he said slowly.</p>

<p>But Nurse Macdonald shook her head, and her brown, mothlike hand
left his and fluttered to his forehead.</p>

<p>"By the mother that bore you and died of grief for the sins you
did, tell me the truth!"</p>

<p>Sir Hugh's lips tightened on his discoloured teeth.</p>

<p>"Not on earth," he answered slowly.</p>

<p>"By the wife who bore your son and died heartbroken, tell me the
truth!"</p>

<p>"Neither to you in life, nor to her in eternal death."</p>

<p>His lips writhed, as if the words were coals between them, and a
great drop of sweat rolled across the parchment of his forehead.
Gabriel Ockram bit his hand as he watched his father die. But Nurse
Macdonald spoke a third time.</p>

<p>"By the woman whom you betrayed, and who waits for you this night,
Hugh Ockram, tell me the truth!"</p>

<p>"It is too late. Let me die in peace."</p>

<p>His writhing lips began to smile across his yellow teeth, and his
toadlike eyes glowed like evil jewels in his head.</p>

<p>"There is time," said the ancient woman. "Tell me the name of
Evelyn Warburton's father. Then I will let you die in peace."</p>

<p>Evelyn started. She stared at Nurse Macdonald, and then at her
uncle.</p>

<p>"The name of Evelyn's father?" he repeated slowly, while the awful
smile spread upon his dying face.</p>

<p>The light was growing strangely dim in the great room. As Evelyn
looked on, Nurse Macdonald's crooked shadow on the wall grew
gigantic. Sir Hugh's breath was becoming thick, rattling in his
throat, as death crept in like a snake and choked it back. Evelyn
prayed aloud, high and clear.</p>

<p>Then something rapped at the window, and she felt her hair rise
upon her head. She looked around in spite of herself. And when she
saw her own white face looking in at the window, her own eyes staring
at her through the glass--wide and fearful--her own hair streaming
against the pane, and her own lips dashed with blood, she rose slowly
from the floor and stood rigid for one moment before she screamed
once and fell straight back into Gabriel's arms. But the shriek that
answered hers was the fear-shriek of a tormented corpse out of which
the soul cannot pass for shame of deadly sins.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Ockram sat upright in his deathbed, and saw and cried
aloud:</p>

<p>"Evelyn!" His harsh voice broke and rattled in his chest as he
sank down. But still Nurse Macdonald tortured him, for there was a
little life left in him still.</p>

<p>"You have seen the mother as she waits for you, Hugh Ockram. Who
was this girl Evelyn's father? What was his name?"</p>

<p>For the last time the dreadful smile came upon the twisted lips,
very slowly, very surely now. The toad eyes glared red and the
parchment face glowed a little in the flickering light; for the last
time words came.</p>

<p>"They know it in hell."</p>

<p>Then the glowing eyes went out quickly. The yellow face turned
waxen pale, and a great shiver ran through the thin body as Hugh
Ockram died.</p>

<p>But in death he still smiled, for he knew his secret and kept it
still. He would take it with him to the other side, to lie with him
forever in the north vault of the chapel where the Ockrams lie
uncoffined in their shrouds--all but one. Though he was dead, he
smiled, for he had kept his treasure of evil truth to the end. There
was none left to tell the name he had spoken, but there was all the
evil he had not undone left to bear fruit.</p>

<p>As they watched--Nurse Macdonald and Gabriel, who held the still
unconscious Evelyn in his arms while he looked at the father--they
felt the dead smile crawling along their own lips. Then they shivered
a little as they both looked at Evelyn as she lay with her head on
Gabriel's shoulder, for though she was very beautiful, the same
sickening smile was twisting her young mouth too, and it was like the
foreshadowing of a great evil that they could not understand.</p>

<p>By and by they carried Evelyn out, and when she opened her eyes
the smile was gone. From far away in the great house the sound of
weeping and crooning came up the stairs and echoed along the dismal
corridors as the women had begun to mourn the dead master in the
Irish fashion. The hall had echoes of its own all that night, like
the far-off wail of the banshee among forest trees.</p>

<p>When the time was come they took Sir Hugh in his winding-sheet on
a trestle bier and bore him to the chapel, through the iron door and
down the long descent to the north vault lit with tapers, to lay him
by his father. The two men went in first to prepare the place, and
came back staggering like drunken men, their faces white.</p>

<p>But Gabriel Ockram was not afraid, for he knew. When he went in,
alone, he saw the body of Sir Vernon Ockram leaning upright against
the stone wall. Its head lay on the ground nearby with the face
turned up. The dried leather lips smiled horribly at the dried-up
corpse, while the iron coffin, lined with black velvet, stood open on
the floor.</p>

<p>Gabriel took the body in his hands--for it was very light, being
quite dried by the air of the vault--and those who peeped in the door
saw him lay it in the coffin again. They heard it rustle a little, as
it touched the sides and the bottom, like a bundle of reeds. He also
placed the head upon the shoulders and shut down the lid, which fell
to with the snap of its rusty spring.</p>

<p>After that they laid Sir Hugh beside his father, on the trestle
bier on which they had brought him, and they went back to the chapel.
But when they looked into one another's faces, master and men, they
were all smiling with the dead smile of the corpse they had left in
the vault. They could not bear to look at one another again until it
had faded away.</p>

<h3>Chapter iii</h3>

<p>GABRIEL OCKRAM became Sir Gabriel, inheriting the baronetcy with
the half-ruined fortune left by his father, and Evelyn Warburton
continued to lived at Ockram Hall, in the south room that had been
hers ever. since she could remember. She could not go away, for there
were no relatives to whom she could have gone, and besides, there
seemed to be no reason why she should not stay. The world would never
trouble itself to care what the Ockrams did on their Irish estates.
It was long since the Ockrams had asked anything of the world.</p>

<p>So Sir Gabriel took his father's place at the dark old table in
the dining room, and Evelyn sat opposite to him--until such time as
their mourning should be over--and they might be married at last.
Meanwhile, their lives went on as before--since Sir Hugh had been a
hopeless invalid during the last year of his life, and they had seen
him but once a day for a little while--spending most of their time
together in a strangely perfect companionship.</p>

<p>Though the late summer saddened into autumn, and autumn darkened
into winter, and storm followed storm, and rain poured on rain
through the short days and the long nights, Ockram Hall seemed less
gloomy since Sir Hugh had been laid in the north vault beside his
father.</p>

<p>At Christmastide Evelyn decked the great hall with holly and green
boughs. Huge fires blazed on every hearth. The tenants were all bid
to come to a New Year's dinner at which they ate and drank well,
while Sir Gabriel sat at the head of the table. Evelyn came in when
the port wine was brought and the most respected of the tenants made
a speech to her health.</p>

<p>When the speechmaker said it had been a long time since there had
been a Lady Ockram, Sir Gabriel shaded his eyes with his hand and
looked down at the table; a faint color came into Evelyn's
transparent cheeks. And, said the gray-haired farmer, it was longer
still since there had been a Lady Ockram so fair as the next was to
be, and he drank to the health of Evelyn Warburton.</p>

<p>Then the tenants all stood up and shouted for her. Sir Gabriel
stood up likewise, beside Evelyn. But when the men gave the last and
loudest cheer of all, there was a voice not theirs, above them all,
higher, fiercer, louder--an unearthly scream-shrieking for the bride
of Ockram Hall. It was so loud that the holly and the green boughs
over the great chimney shook and waved as if a cool breeze were
blowing over them.</p>

<p>The men turned very pale. Many of them set down their glasses, but
others let them fall upon the floor. Looking into one another's
faces, they saw that they were all smiling strangely--a dead
smile--like dead Sir Hugh's.</p>

<p>The fear of death was suddenly upon them all, so that they fled in
a panic, falling over one another like wild beasts in the burning
forest when the thick smoke runs along before the flame. Tables were
overturned, drinking glasses and bottles were broken in heaps, and
dark red wine crawled like blood upon the polished floor.</p>

<p>Sir Gabriel and Evelyn were left standing alone at the head of the
table before the wreck of their feast, not daring to turn to look at
one another, for each knew that the other smiled. But Gabriel's right
arm held her and his left hand clasped her tight as they stared
before them. But for the shadows of her hair, one might not have told
their two faces apart.</p>

<p>They listened long, but the cry came not again, and eventually the
dead smile faded from their lips as each remembered that Sir Hugh
Ockram lay in the north vault smiling in his winding sheet, in the
dark, because he had died with his secret.</p>

<p>So ended the tenants' New Year's dinner. But from that time on,
Sir Gabriel grew more and more silent and his face grew even paler
and thinner than before. Often, without warning and without words, he
would rise from his seat as if something moved him against his will.
He would go out into the rain or the sunshine to the north side of
the chapel, sit on the stone bench and stare at the ground as if he
could see through it, through the vault below, and through the white
winding sheet in the dark, to the dead smile that would not die.</p>

<p>Always when he went out in that way Evelyn would come out
presently and sit beside him. Once, as in the past, their beautiful
faces came suddenly near; their lids drooped, and their red lips were
almost joined together. But as their eyes met, they grew wide and
wild, so that the white showed in a ring all round the deep violet.
Their teeth chattered and their hands were like the hands of corpses,
for fear of what was under their feet, and of what they knew but
could not see.</p>

<p>Once, Evelyn found Sir Gabriel in the chapel alone, standing
before the iron door that led down to the place of death with the key
to the door in his hand, but he had not put it into the lock. Evelyn
drew him away, shivering, for she had also been driven--in waking
dreams--to see that terrible thing again, and to find out whether it
had changed since it had been laid there.</p>

<p>"I'm going mad," said Sir Gabriel, covering his eyes with his hand
as he went with her. "I see it in my sleep. I see it when I am awake.
It draws me to it, day and night and unless I see it I shall
die!"</p>

<p>"I know," answered Evelyn, "I know. It is as if threads were spun
from it like a spider's, drawing us down to it." She was silent for a
moment and then she started violently and grasped his arm with a
man's strength, and almost screamed the words she spoke. "But we must
not go there!" she cried. "We must not go!"</p>

<p>Sir Gabriel's eyes were half shut, and he was not moved by the
agony of her face.</p>

<p>"I shall die, unless I see it again," he said, in a quiet voice
not like his own. And all that day and that evening he scarcely
spoke, thinking of it, always thinking, while Evelyn Warburton
quivered from head to foot with a terror she had never known.</p>

<p>One grey winter morning, she went alone to Nurse Macdonald's room
in the tower, and sat down beside the great leather easy chair,
laying her thin white hand upon the withered fingers.</p>

<p>"Nurse," she said, "what was it that Uncle Hugh should have told
you, that night before he died? It must have been an awful
secret--and yet, though you asked him, I feel somehow that you know
it, and that you know why he used to smile so dreadfully."</p>

<p>The old woman's head moved slowly from side to side.</p>

<p>"I only guess...I shall never know," she answered slowly in her
cracked little voice.</p>

<p>"But what do you guess? Who am I? Why did you ask who my father
was? You know I am Colonel Warburton's daughter, and my mother was
Lady Ockram's sister, so that Gabriel and I are cousins. My father
was killed in Afghanistan. What secret can there be?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. I can only guess."</p>

<p>"Guess what?" asked Evelyn imploringly, pressing the soft withered
hands, as she leaned forward. But Nurse Macdonald's wrinkled lids
dropped suddenly over her queer blue eyes, and her lips shook a
little with her breath, as if she were asleep.</p>

<p>Evelyn waited. By the fire the Irish maid was knitting fast. Her
needles clicked like three or four clocks ticking against each other.
But the real clock on the wall solemnly ticked alone, checking off
the seconds of the woman who was a hundred years old, and had not
many days left. Outside the ivy branch beat the window in the wintry
blast, as it had beaten against the glass a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Then as Evelyn sat there she felt again the waking of a horrible
desire--the sickening wish to go down, down to the thing in the north
vault, and to open the winding-sheet, and see whether it had changed;
and she held Nurse Macdonald's hands as if to keep herself in her
place and fight against the appalling attraction of the evil
dead.</p>

<p>But the old cat that kept Nurse Macdonald's feet warm, lying
always on the footstool, got up and stretched itself, and looked up
into Evelyn's eyes, while its back arched, and its tail thickened and
bristled, and its ugly pink lips drew back in a devilish grin,
showing its sharp teeth. Evelyn stared at it, half fascinated by its
ugliness. Then the creature suddenly put out one paw with all its
claws spread, and spat at the girl. All at once the grinning cat was
like the smiling corpse far down below. Evelyn shivered down to her
small feet, and covered her face with her free hand, lest Nurse
Macdonald should wake and see the dead smile there, for she could
feel it.</p>

<p>The old woman had already opened her eyes again, and she touched
her cat with the end of her crutch-stick, whereupon its back went
down and its tail shrunk, and it sidled back to its place on the
footstool. But its yellow eyes looked up sideways at Evelyn, between
the slits of its lids.</p>

<p>"What is it that you guess, nurse?" asked the young girl
again.</p>

<p>"A bad thing, a wicked thing. But I dare not tell you, lest it
might not be true, and the very thought should blast your life. For
if I guess right, he meant that you should not know, and that you two
should marry and pay for his old sin with your souls."</p>

<p>"He used to tell us that we ought not to marry."</p>

<p>"Yes--he told you that, perhaps. But it was as if a man put
poisoned meat before a starving beast, and said 'do not eat,' but
never raised his hand to take the meat away. And if he told you that
you should not marry, it was because he hoped you would; for of all
men living or dead, Hugh Ockram was the falsest man that ever told a
cowardly lie, and the crudest that ever hurt a weak woman, and the
worst that ever loved a sin."</p>

<p>"But Gabriel and I love each other," said Evelyn very sadly.</p>

<p>Nurse Macdonald's old eyes looked far away, at sights seen long
ago, and that rose in the grey winter air amid the mists of an
ancient youth.</p>

<p>"If you love, you can die together," she said, very slowly. "Why
should you live, if it is true? I am a hundred years old. What has
life given me? The beginning is fire; the end is a heap of ashes; and
between the end and the beginning lies all the pain of the world. Let
me sleep, since I cannot die."</p>

<p>Then the old woman's eyes closed again, and her head sank a little
lower upon her breast.</p>

<p>So Evelyn went away and left her asleep, with the cat asleep on
the footstool. The young girl tried to forget Nurse Macdonald's
words, but she could not, for she heard them over and over again in
the wind, and behind her on the stairs. And as she grew sick with
fear of the frightful unknown evil to which her soul was bound, she
felt a bodily something pressing her, pushing her, forcing her on
from the other side. She felt threads that drew her mysteriously, and
when she shut her eyes, she saw in the chapel behind the altar, the
low iron door through which she must pass to go to the thing.</p>

<p>As she lay awake at night, she drew the sheet over her face, lest
she should see shadows on the wall beckoning to her. The sound of her
own warm breath made whisperings in her ears, while she held the
mattress with her hands, to keep from getting up and going to the
chapel. It would have been easier if there had not been a way thither
through the library, by a door which was never locked. It would be
fearfully easy to take her candle and go softly through the sleeping
house. The key of the vault lay under the altar behind a stone that
turned. She knew that little secret. She could go alone and see.</p>

<p>But when she thought of it, she felt her hair rise on her head.
She shivered so that the bed shook, then the horror went through her
in a cold thrill that was agony again, like a myriad of icy needles
boring into her nerves.</p>

<h3>Chapter iv</h3>

<p>THE OLD CLOCK in Nurse Macdonald's tower struck midnight. From her
room she could hear the creaking chains, and weights in their box in
the corner of the staircase, and the jarring of the rusty lever that
lifted the hammer. She had heard it all her life. It struck eleven
strokes clearly, and then came the twelfth with a dull half stroke,
as though the hammer were too weary to go on and had fallen asleep
against the bell.</p>

<p>The old cat got up from the footstool and stretched itself. Nurse
Macdonald opened her ancient eyes and looked slowly round the room by
the dim light of the night lamp. She touched the cat with her
crutch-stick, and it lay down upon her feet. She drank a few drops
from her cup and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>But downstairs Sir Gabriel sat straight up as the clock struck,
for he had dreamed a fearful dream of horror, and his heart stood
still. He awoke at its stopping and it beat again furiously with his
breath, like a wild thing set free. No Ockram had ever known fear
waking, but sometimes it came to Sir Gabriel in his sleep.</p>

<p>He pressed his hands to his temples as he sat up in bed. His hands
were icy cold, but his head was hot. The dream faded far and in its
place there came the master thought that racked his life. With the
thought also came the sick twisting of his lips in the dark that
would have been a smile. Far off, Evelyn Warburton dreamed that the
dead smile was on her mouth, and awoke--starting with a little
moan--her face in her hands, shivering.</p>

<p>But Sir Gabriel struck a light and got up and began to walk up and
down his great room. It was midnight and he had barely slept an hour,
and in the north of Ireland the winter nights are long.</p>

<p>"I shall go mad," he said to himself, holding his forehead. He
knew that it was true. For weeks and months the possession of the
thing had grown upon him like a disease, till he could think of
nothing without thinking first of that. And now all at once it
outgrew his strength, and he knew that he must be its instrument or
lose his mind. He knew that he must do the deed he hated and feared,
if he could fear anything, or that something would snap in his brain
and divide him from life while he was yet alive. He took the
candlestick in his hand, the old-fashioned heavy candlestick that had
always been used by the head of the house. He did not think of
dressing, but went as he was--in his silk night clothes and his
slippers--and opened the door.</p>

<p>Everything was very still in the great old house. He shut the door
behind him and walked noiselessly on the carpet through the long
corridor. A cool breeze blew over his shoulder and blew the flame of
his candle straight out. Instinctively he stopped and looked round,
but all was still, and the upright flame burned steadily. He walked
on, and instantly a strong draught was behind him, almost
extinguishing the light. It seemed to blow him on his way, ceasing
whenever he turned, coming again when he went on--invisible, icy.</p>

<p>Down the great staircase to the echoing hall he went, seeing
nothing but the flaring flame of the candle standing away from him
over the guttering wax. The cold wind blew over his shoulder and
through his hair. On he passed through the open door into the library
dark with old books and carved bookcases. On he went through the door
with shelves and the imitated backs of books painted on it, which
shut itself after him with a soft click.</p>

<p>He entered the low-arched passage, and though the door was shut
behind him and fitted tightly in its frame, still the cold breeze
blew the flame forward as he walked. He was not afraid; but his face
was very pale and his eyes were wide and bright, seeing already in
the dark air the picture of the thing beyond. But in the chapel he
stood still, his hand on the little turning stone tablet in the back
of the stone altar. On the tablet were engraved the words:</p>

<p>XxxPRE Clavis sepulchri Clarissimorum Dominorum De Ockram</p>

<p>("the key to the vault of the most illustrious lords of
Ockram").</p>

<p>Sir Gabriel paused and listened. He fancied that he heard a sound
far off in the great house where all had been so still, but it did
not come again. Yet he waited at the last, and looked at the low iron
door. Beyond it, down the long descent, lay his father uncoffined,
six months dead, corrupt, terrible in his clinging shroud. The
strangely preserving air of the vault could not yet have done its
work completely. But on the thing's ghastly features, with their
half-dried, open eyes, there would still be the frightful smile with
which the man had died--the smile that haunted.</p>

<p>As the thought crossed Sir Gabriel's mind, he felt his lips
writhing, and he struck his own mouth in wrath with the back of his
hand so fiercely that a drop of blood ran down his chin, and another,
and more, falling back in the gloom upon the chapel pavement. But
still his bruised lips twisted themselves. He turned the tablet by
the simple secret. It needed no safer fastening, for had each Ockram
been coffined in pure gold, and had the door been open wide, there
was not a man in Tyrone brave enough to go down to that place, save
Gabriel Ockram himself, with his angel's face, his thin, white hands,
and his sad unflinching eyes. He took the great old key and set it
into the lock of the iron door. The heavy, rattling noise echoed down
the descent beyond like footsteps, as if a watcher had stood behind
the iron and were running away within, with heavy dead feet. And
though he was standing still, the cool wind was from behind him, and
blew the flame of the candle against the iron panel. He turned the
key.</p>

<p>Sir Gabriel saw that his candle was short. There were new ones on
the altar, with long candlesticks, so he lit one and left his own
burning on the floor. As he set it down on the pavement his lip began
to bleed again, and another drop fell upon the stones.</p>

<p>He drew the iron door open and pushed it back against the chapel
wall, so that it should not shut of itself, while he was within; and
the horrible draught of the sepulchre came up out of the depths in
his face, foul and dark. He went in, but though the fetid air met
him, yet the flame of the tall candle was blown straight from him
against the wind while he walked down the easy incline with steady
steps, his loose slippers slapping the pavement as he trod.</p>

<p>He shaded the candle with his hand, and his fingers seemed to be
made of wax and blood as the light shone through them. And in spite
of him the unearthly draught forced the flame forward, till it was
blue over the black wick, and it seemed as if it must go out. But he
went straight on, with shining eyes.</p>

<p>The downward passage was wide, and he could not always see the
walls by the struggling light, but he knew when he was in the place
of death by the larger, drearier echo of his steps in the greater
space, and by the sensation of a distant blank wall. He stood still,
almost enclosing the flame of the candle in the hollow of his hand.
He could see a little, for his eyes were growing used to the gloom.
Shadowy forms were outlined in the dimness, where the biers of the
Ockrams stood crowded together, side by side, each with its straight,
shrouded corpse, strangely preserved by the dry air, like the empty
shell that the locust sheds in summer. And a few steps before him he
saw clearly the dark shape of headless Sir Vernon's iron coffin, and
he knew that nearest to it lay the thing he sought.</p>

<p>He was as brave as any of those dead men had been. They were his
fathers, and he knew that sooner or later he should lie there
himself, beside Sir Hugh, slowly drying to a parchment shell. But as
yet, he was still alive. He closed his eyes a moment as three great
drops stood on his forehead.</p>

<p>Then he looked again, and by the whiteness of the winding sheet he
knew his father's corpse, for all the others were brown with age;
and, moreover, the flame of the candle was blown toward it. He made
four steps till he reached it, and suddenly the light burned straight
and high, shedding a dazzling yellow glare upon the fine linen that
was all white, save over the face, and where the joined hands were
laid on the breast. And at those places ugly stains had spread,
darkened with outlines of the features and of the tight clasped
fingers. There was a frightful stench of drying death.</p>

<p>As Sir Gabriel looked down, something stirred behind him, softly
at first, then more noisily, and something fell to the stone floor
with a dull thud and rolled up to his feet. He started back and saw a
withered head lying almost face upward on the pavement, grinning at
him. He felt the cold sweat standing on his face, and his heart beat
painfully.</p>

<p>For the first time in all his life that evil thing which men call
fear was getting hold of him, checking his heart-strings as a cruel
driver checks a quivering horse, clawing at his backbone with icy
hands, lifting his hair with freezing breath, climbing up and
gathering in his midriff with leaden weight.</p>

<p>Yet he bit his lip and bent down, holding the candle in one hand,
to lift the shroud back from the head of the corpse with the other.
Slowly he lifted it. It clove to the half-dried skin of the face, and
his hand shook as if someone had struck him on the elbow, but half in
fear and half in anger at himself, he pulled it, so that it came away
with a little ripping sound. He caught his breath as he held it, not
yet throwing it back, and not yet looking. The horror was working in
him and he felt that old Vernon Ockram was standing up in his iron
coffin, headless, yet watching him with the stump of his severed
neck.</p>

<p>While he held his breath he felt the dead smile twisting his lips.
In sudden wrath at his own misery, he tossed the death-stained linen
backward, and looked at last. He ground his teeth lest he should
shriek aloud. There it was, the thing that haunted him, that haunted
Evelyn Warburton, that was like a blight on all that came near
him.</p>

<p>The dead face was blotched with dark stains, and the thin, grey
hair was matted about the discoloured forehead. The sunken lids were
half open, and the candlelight gleamed on something foul where the
toad eyes had lived.</p>

<p>But yet the dead thing smiled, as it had smiled in life. The
ghastly lips were parted and drawn wide and tight upon the wolfish
teeth, cursing still, and still defying hell to do its
worst--defying, cursing, and always and forever smiling alone in the
dark.</p>

<p>Sir Gabriel opened the sheet where the hands were. The blackened,
withered fingers were closed upon something stained and mottled.
Shivering from head to foot, but fighting like a man in agony for his
life, he tried to take the package from the dead man's hold. But as
he pulled at it the clawlike fingers seemed to close more tightly.
When he pulled harder the shrunken hands and arms rose from the
corpse with a horrible look of life following his motion--then as he
wrenched the sealed packet loose at last, the hands fell back into
their place still folded.</p>

<p>He set down the candle on the edge of the bier to break the seals
from the stout paper. Kneeling on one knee, to get a better light, he
read what was within, written long ago in Sir Hugh's queer hand. He
was no longer afraid.</p>

<p>He read how Sir Hugh had written it all down that it might
perchance be a witness of evil and of his hatred. He had written how
he had loved Evelyn Warburton, his wife's sister; and how his wife
had died of a broken heart with his curse upon her. He wrote how
Warburton and he had fought side by side in Afghanistan, and
Warburton had fallen; but Ockram had brought his comrade's wife back
a full year later, and little Evelyn, her child, had been born in
Ockram Hall. And he wrote how he had wearied of the mother, and she
had died like her sister with his curse on her; and how Evelyn had
been brought up as his niece, and how he had trusted that his son
Gabriel and his daughter, innocent and unknowing, might love and
marry, and the souls of the women he had betrayed might suffer yet
another anguish before eternity was out. And, last of all, he hoped
that some day, when nothing could be undone, the two might find his
writing and live on, as man and wife, not daring to tell the truth
for their children's sake and the world's word.</p>

<p>This he read, kneeling beside the corpse in the north vault, by
the light of the altar candle. He had read it all and then he thanked
God aloud that he had found the secret in time. When he finally rose
to his feet and looked down at the dead face it had changed. The
smile was gone from it. The jaw had fallen a little and the tired,
dead lips were relaxed. And then there was a breath behind him and
close to him, not cold like that which had blown the flame of the
candle as he came, but warm and human. He turned suddenly.</p>

<p>There she stood, all in white, with her shadowy golden hair. She
had risen from her bed and had followed him noiselessly. When she
found him reading, she read over his shoulder.</p>

<p>He started violently when he saw her, for his nerves were
unstrung. Then he cried out her name in that still place of
death:</p>

<p>"Evelyn!"</p>

<p>"My brother!" she answered softly and tenderly, putting out both
hands to meet his.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2"></a>The Screaming Skull</h2>

<p>I have often heard it scream. No, I am not nervous, I am not
imaginative, and I never believed in ghosts, unless that thing is
one. Whatever it is, it hates me almost as much as it hated Luke
Pratt, and it screams at me.</p>

<p>If I were you, I would never tell ugly stories about ingenious
ways of killing people, for you never can tell but that some one at
the table may be tired of his or her nearest and dearest. I have
always blamed myself for Mrs. Pratt's death, and I suppose I was
responsible for it in a way, though heaven knows I never wished her
anything but long life and happiness. If I had not told that story
she might be alive yet. That is why the thing screams at me, I
fancy.</p>

<p>She was a good little woman, with a sweet temper, all things
considered, and a nice gentle voice; but I remember hearing her
shriek once when she thought her little boy was killed by a pistol
that went off though everyone was sure that it was not loaded. It was
the same scream; exactly the same, with a sort of rising quaver at
the end; do you know what I mean? Unmistakable.</p>

<p>The truth is, I had not realized that the doctor and his wife were
not on good terms. They used to bicker a bit now and then when I was
here, and I often noticed that little Mrs. Pratt got very red and bit
her lip hard to keep her temper, while Luke grew pale and said the
most offensive things. He was that sort when he was in the nursery, I
remember, and afterwards at school. He was my cousin, you know; that
is how I came by this house; after he died, and his boy Charley was
killed in South Africa, there were no relations left. Yes, it's a
pretty little property, just the sort of thing for an old sailor like
me who has taken to gardening.</p>

<p>One always remembers one's mistakes much more vividly than one's
cleverest things, doesn't one? I've often noticed it. I was dining
with the Pratts one night, when I told them the story that afterwards
made so much difference. It was a wet night in November, and the sea
was moaning. Hush!--if you don't speak you will hear it now. . .</p>

<p>Do you hear the tide? Gloomy sound, isn't it? Sometimes, about
this time of year--hallo!--there it is! Don't be frightened, man--it
won't eat you--it's only a noise, after all! But I'm glad you've
heard it, because there are always people who think it's the wind, or
my imagination, or something. You won't hear it again tonight, I
fancy, for it doesn't often come more than once. Yes--that's right.
Put another stick on the fire, and a little more stuff into that weak
mixture you're so fond of. Do you remember old Blauklot the
carpenter, on that German ship that picked us up when the Clontarf
went to the bottom? We were hove to in a howling gale one night, as
snug as you please, with no land within five hundred miles, and the
ship coming up and falling off as regularly as clockwork--"Biddy te
boor beebles ashore tis night, poys!" old Blauklot sang out, as he
went off to his quarters with the sail-maker. I often think of that,
now that I'm ashore for good and all.</p>

<p>Yes, it was on a night like this, when I was at home for a spell,
waiting to take the Olympia out on her first trip--it was on the next
voyage that she broke the record, you remember--but that dates it.
Ninety-two was the year, early in November.</p>

<p>The weather was dirty, Pratt was out of temper, and the dinner was
bad, very bad indeed, which didn't improve matters, and cold, which
made it worse. The poor little lady was very unhappy about it, and
insisted on making a Welsh rarebit on the table to counteract the raw
turnips and the half-boiled mutton. Pratt must have had a hard day.
Perhaps he had lost a patient. At all events, he was in a nasty
temper.</p>

<p>"My wife is trying to poison me, you see!" he said. "She'll
succeed some day." I saw that she was hurt, and I made believe to
laugh, and said that Mrs. Pratt was much too clever to get rid of her
husband in such a simple way; and then I began to tell them about
Japanese tricks with spun glass and chopped horsehair and the
like.</p>

<p>Pratt was a doctor, and knew a lot more than I did about such
things, but that only put me on my mettle, and I told a story about a
woman in Ireland who did for three husbands before anyone suspected
foul play.</p>

<p>Did you never hear that tale? The fourth husband managed to keep
awake and caught her, and she was hanged. How did she do it? She
drugged them, and poured melted lead into their ears through a little
horn funnel when they were asleep...No--that's the wind whistling.
It's backing up to the southward again. I can tell by the sound.
Besides, the other thing doesn't often come more than once in an
evening even at this time of year--when it happened. Yes, it was in
November. Poor Mrs. Pratt died suddenly in her bed not long after I
dined here. I can fix the date, because I got the news in New York by
the steamer that followed the Olympia when I took her out on her
first trip. You had the Leofric the same year? Yes, I remember. What
a pair of old buffers we are coming to be, you and I. Nearly fifty
years since we were apprentices together on the Clontarf. Shall you
ever forget old Blauklot? "Biddy te boor beebles ashore, poys!" Ha,
ha! Take a little more, with all that water. It's the old Hulstkamp I
found in the cellar when this house came to me, the same I brought
Luke from Amsterdam five-and-twenty years ago. He had never touched a
drop of it. Perhaps he's sorry now, poor fellow.</p>

<p>Where did I leave off? I told you that Mrs. Pratt died
suddenly--yes. Luke must have been lonely here after she was dead, I
should think; I came to see him now and then, and he looked worn and
nervous, and told me that his practice was growing too heavy for him,
though he wouldn't take an assistant on any account. Years went on,
and his son was killed in South Africa, and after that he began to be
queer. There was something about him not like other people. I believe
he kept his senses in his profession to the end; there was no
complaint of his having made mad mistakes in cases, or anything of
that sort, but he had a look about him--</p>

<p>Luke was a red-headed man with a pale face when he was young, and
he was never stout; in middle age he turned a sandy grey, and after
his son died he grew thinner and thinner, till his head looked like a
skull with parchment stretched over it very tight, and his eyes had a
sort of glare in them that was very disagreeable to look at.</p>

<p>He had an old dog that poor Mrs. Pratt had been fond of, and that
used to follow her everywhere. He was a bulldog, and the sweetest
tempered beast you ever saw, though he had a way of hitching his
upper lip behind one of his fangs that frightened strangers a good
deal. Sometimes, of an evening, Pratt and Bumble--that was the dog's
name--used to sit and look at each other a long time, thinking about
old times, I suppose, when Luke's wife used to sit in that chair
you've got. That was always her place, and this was the doctor's,
where I'm sitting. Bumble used to climb up by the footstool--he was
old and fat by that time, and could not jump much, and his teeth were
getting shaky. He would look steadily at Luke, and Luke looked
steadily at the dog, his face growing more and more like a skull with
two little coals for eyes; and after about five minutes or so, though
it may have been less, old Bumble would suddenly begin to shake all
over, and all on a sudden he would set up an awful howl, as if he had
been shot, and tumble out of the easy-chair and trot away, and hide
himself under the sideboard, and lie there making odd noises.</p>

<p>Considering Pratt's looks in those last months, the thing is not
surprising, you know. I'm not nervous or imaginative, but I can quite
believe he might have sent a sensitive woman into hysterics--his head
looked so much like a skull in parchment.</p>

<p>At last I came down one day before Christmas, when my ship was in
dock and I had three weeks off. Bumble was not about, and I said
casually that I supposed the old dog was dead.</p>

<p>"Yes," Pratt answered, and I thought there was something odd in
his tone even before he went on after a little pause. "I killed him,"
he said presently. "I could stand it no longer."</p>

<p>I asked what it was that Luke could not stand, though I guessed
well enough.</p>

<p>"He had a way of sitting in her chair and glaring at me, and then
howling," Luke shivered a little. "He didn't suffer at all, poor old
Bumble," he went on in a hurry, as if he thought I might imagine he
had been cruel. "I put dionine into his drink to make him sleep
soundly, and then I chloroformed him gradually, so that he could not
have felt suffocated even if he was dreaming. It's been quieter since
then."</p>

<p>I wondered what he meant, for the words slipped out as if he could
not help saying them. I've understood since. He meant that he did not
hear that noise so often after the dog was out of the way. Perhaps he
thought at first that it was old Bumble in the yard howling at the
moon, though it's not that kind of noise, is it? Besides, I know what
it is, if Luke didn't. It's only a noise after all, and a noise never
hurt anybody yet. But he was much more imaginative than I am. No
doubt there really is something about this place that I don't
understand; but when I don't understand a thing, I call it a
phenomenon, and I don't take it for granted that it's going to kill
me, as he did. I don't understand everything, by long odds, nor do
you, nor does any man who has been to sea. We used to talk of tidal
waves, for instance, and we could not account for them; now we
account for them by calling them submarine earthquakes, and we branch
off into fifty theories, any one of which might make earthquakes
quite comprehensible if we only knew what they were. I fell in with
one of them once, and the inkstand flew straight up from the table
against the ceiling of my cabin. The same thing happened to Captain
Lecky--I dare say you've read about it in his "Wrinkles". Very good.
If that sort of thing took place ashore, in this room for instance, a
nervous person would talk about spirits and levitation and fifty
things that mean nothing, instead of just quietly setting it down as
a "phenomenon" that has not been explained yet. My view of that
voice, you see.</p>

<p>Besides, what is there to prove that Luke killed his wife? I would
not even suggest such a thing to anyone but you. After all, there was
nothing but the coincidence that poor little Mrs. Pratt died suddenly
in her bed a few days after I told that story at dinner. She was not
the only woman who ever died like that. Luke got the doctor over from
the next parish, and they agreed that she had died of something the
matter with her heart Why not? It's common enough.</p>

<p>Of course, there was the ladle. I never told anybody about that,
and, it made me start when I found it in the cupboard in the bedroom.
It was new, too--a little tinned iron ladle that had not been in the
fire more than once or twice, and there was some lead in it that had
been melted, and stuck to the bottom of the bowl, all grey, with
hardened dross on it. But that proves nothing. A country doctor is
generally a handy man, who does everything for himself, and Luke may
have had a dozen reasons for melting a little lead in a ladle. He was
fond of sea-fishing, for instance, and he may have cast a sinker for
a night-line; perhaps it was a weight for the hall clock, or
something like that. All the same, when I found it I had a rather
queer sensation, because it looked so much like the thing I had
described when I told them the story. Do you understand? It affected
me unpleasantly, and I threw it away; it's at the bottom of the sea a
mile from the Spit, and it will be jolly well rusted beyond
recognizing if it's ever washed up by the tide.</p>

<p>You see, Luke must have bought it in the village, years ago, for
the man sells just such ladles still. I suppose they are used in
cooking. In any case, there was no reason why an inquisitive
housemaid should find such a thing lying about, with lead in it, and
wonder what it was, and perhaps talk to the maid who heard me tell
the story at dinner--for that girl married the plumber's son in the
village, and may remember the whole thing.</p>

<p>You understand me, don't you? Now that Luke Pratt is dead and
gone, and lies buried beside his wife, with an honest man's tombstone
at his head, I should not care to stir up anything that could hurt
his memory. They are both dead, and their son, too. There was trouble
enough about Luke's death, as it was.</p>

<p>How? He was found dead on the beach one morning, and there was a
coroner's inquest. There were marks on his throat, but he had not
been robbed. The verdict was that he had come to his end "By the
hands or teeth of some person or animal unknown," for half the jury
thought it might have been a big dog that had thrown him down and
gripped his windpipe, though the skin of his throat was not broken.
No one knew at what time he had gone out, nor where he had been. He
was found lying on his back above high-water mark, and an old
cardboard bandbox that had belonged to his wife lay under his hand,
open. The lid had fallen off. He seemed to have been carrying home a
skull in the box--doctors are fond of collecting such things. It had
rolled out and lay near his head, and it was a remarkably fine skull,
rather small, beautifully shaped and very white, with perfect teeth.
That is to say, the upper jaw was perfect, but there was no lower one
at all, when I first saw it.</p>

<p>Yes, I found it here when I came. You see, it was very white and
polished, like a thing meant to be kept under a glass case, and the
people did not know where it came from, nor what to do with it; so
they put it back into the bandbox and set it on the shelf of the
cupboard in the best bedroom, and of course they showed it to me when
I took possession. I was taken down to the beach, too, to be shown
the place where Luke was found, and the old fisherman explained just
how he was lying, and the skull beside him. The only point he could
not explain was why the skull had rolled up the sloping sand towards
Luke's head instead of rolling downhill to his feet. It did not seem
odd to me at the time, but I have often thought of it since, for the
place is rather steep. I'll take you there tomorrow if you like--I
made a sort of cairn of stones there afterwards.</p>

<p>When he fell down, or was thrown down--whichever happened--the
bandbox struck the sand, and the lid came off, and the thing came out
and ought to have rolled down. But it didn't. It was close to his
head almost touching it, and turned with the face towards it. I say
it didn't strike me as odd when the man told me; but I could not help
thinking about It afterwards, again and again, till I saw a picture
of it all when I closed my eyes; and then I began to ask myself why
the plaguey thing had rolled up instead of down, and why it had
stopped near Luke's head instead of anywhere else, a yard away, for
instance.</p>

<p>You naturally want to know what conclusion I reached, don't you?
None that at all explained the rolling, at all events. But I got
something else into my head, after a time, that made me feel
downright uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Oh, I don't mean as to anything supernatural! There may be ghosts,
or there may not be. If there are, I'm not inclined to believe that
they can hurt living people except by frightening them, and, for my
part, I would rather face any shape of ghost than a fog in the
Channel when it's crowded. No. What bothered me was just a foolish
idea, that's all, and I cannot tell how it began, nor what made it
grow till it turned into a certainty.</p>

<p>I was thinking about Luke and his poor wife one evening over my
pipe and a dull book, when it occurred to me that the skull might
possibly be hers, and I have never got rid of the thought since.
You'll tell me there's no sense in it, no doubt, that Mrs. Pratt was
buried like a Christian and is lying in the churchyard where they put
her, and that it's perfectly monstrous to suppose her husband kept
her skull in her old bandbox in his bedroom. All the same, in the
face of reason, and common sense, and probability, I'm convinced that
he did. Doctors do all sorts of queer things that would make men like
you and me feel creepy, and those are Just the things that don't seem
probable, nor logical, nor sensible to us.</p>

<p>Then, don't you see?--if it really was her skull, poor woman, the
only way of accounting for his having it is that he really killed
her, and did it in that way, as the woman killed her husbands in the
story, and that he was afraid there might be an examination some day
which would betray him. You see, I told that too, and I believe it
had really happened some fifty or sixty years ago. They dug up the
three skulls, you know, and there was a small lump of lead rattling
about in each one. That was what hanged the woman. Luke remembered
that, I'm sure. I don't want to know what he did when he thought of
it; my taste never ran in the direction of horrors, and I don't fancy
you care for them either, do you? No. If you did, you might supply
what is wanting to the story.</p>

<p>It must have been rather grim, eh? I wish I did not see the whole
thing so distinctly, just as everything must have happened. He took
it the night before she was buried, I'm sure, after the coffin had
been shut, and when the servant girl was asleep. I would bet
anything, that when he'd got it, he put something under the sheet in
its place, to fill up and look like it. What do you suppose he put
there, under the sheet?</p>

<p>I don't wonder you take me up on what I'm saying! First I tell you
that I don't want to know what happened, and that I hate to think
about horrors, and then I describe the whole thing to you as if I had
seen it. I'm quite sure that it was her work-bag that he put there. I
remember the bag very well, for she always used it of an evening; it
was made of brown plush, and when it was stuffed full it was about
the size of--you understand. Yes, there I am, at it again! You may
laugh at me, but you don't live here alone, where it was done, and
you didn't tell Luke the story about the melted lead. I'm not
nervous, I tell you, but sometimes I begin to feel that I understand
why some people are. I dwell on all this when I'm alone, and I dream
of it, and when that thing screams--well, frankly, I don't like the
noise any more than you do, though I should be used to it by this
time.</p>

<p>I ought not to be nervous. I've sailed in a haunted ship. There
was a Man in the Top, and two-thirds of the crew died of the West
Coast fever inside of ten days after we anchored; but I was all
right, then and afterwards. I have seen some ugly sights, too, just
as you have, and all the rest of us. But nothing ever stuck in my
head in the way this does.</p>

<p>You see, I've tried to get rid of the thing, but it doesn't like
that. It wants to be there in its place, in Mrs. Pratt's bandbox in
the cupboard in the best bedroom. It's not happy anywhere else. How
do I know that? Because I've tried it. You don't suppose that I've
not tried, do you? As long as it's there it only screams now and
then, generally at this time of year, but if I put it out of the
house it goes on all night, and no servant will stay here twenty-four
hours. As it is, I've often been left alone and have been obliged to
shift for myself for a fortnight at a time. No one from the village
would ever pass a night under the roof now, and as for selling the
place, or even letting it, that's out of the question. The old women
say that if I stay here I shall come to a bad end myself before
long.</p>

<p>I'm not afraid of that. You smile at the mere idea that anyone
could take such nonsense seriously. Quite right. It's utterly blatant
nonsense, I agree with you. Didn't I tell you that it's only a noise
after all when you started and looked round as if you expected to see
a ghost standing behind your chair?</p>

<p>I may be all wrong about the skull, and I like to think that I am
when I can. It may be just a fine specimen which Luke got somewhere
long ago, and what rattles about inside when you shake it may be
nothing but a pebble, or a bit of hard clay, or anything. Skulls that
have lain long in the ground generally have something inside them
that rattles don't they? No, I've never tried to get it out, whatever
it is; I'm afraid it might be lead, don't you see? And if it is, I
don't want to know the fact, for I'd much rather not be sure. If it
really is lead, I killed her quite as much as if I had done the deed
myself. Anybody must see that, I should think. As long as I don't
know for certain, I have the consolation of saying that it's all
utterly ridiculous nonsense, that Mrs. Pratt died a natural death and
that the beautiful skull belonged to Luke when he was a student in
London. But if I were quite sure, I believe I should have to leave
the house; indeed I do, most certainly. As it is, I had to give up
trying to sleep in the best bedroom where the cupboard is.</p>

<p>You ask me why I don't throw it into the pond--yes, but please
don't call it a "confounded bugbear"--it doesn't like being called
names.</p>

<p>There! Lord, what a shriek! I told you so! You're quite pale, man.
Fill up your pipe and draw your chair nearer to the fire, and take
some more drink. Old Hollands never hurt anybody yet. I've seen a
Dutchman in Java drink half a jug of Hulstkamp in a morning without
turning a hair. I don't take much rum myself, because it doesn't
agree with my rheumatism, but you are not rheumatic and it won't
damage you Besides, it's a very damp night outside. The wind is
howling again, and it will soon be in the south-west; do you hear how
the windows rattle? The tide must have turned too, by the
moaning.</p>

<p>We should not have heard the thing again if you had not said that.
I'm pretty sure we should not. Oh yes, if you choose to describe it
as a coincidence, you are quite welcome, but I would rather that you
should not call the thing names again, if you don't mind. It may be
that the poor little woman hears, and perhaps it hurts her, don't you
know? Ghosts? No! You don't call anything a ghost that you can take
in your hands and look at in broad daylight, and that rattles when
you shake it Do you, now? But it's something that hears and
understands; there's no doubt about that.</p>

<p>I tried sleeping in the best bedroom when I first came to the
house just because it was the best and most comfortable, but I had to
give it up It was their room, and there's the big bed she died in,
and the cupboard is in the thickness of the wall, near the head, on
the left. That's where it likes to be kept, in its bandbox. I only
used the room for a fortnight after I came, and then I turned out and
took the little room downstairs, next to the surgery, where Luke used
to sleep when he expected to be called to a patient during the
night.</p>

<p>I was always a good sleeper ashore; eight hours is my dose, eleven
to seven when I'm alone, twelve to eight when I have a friend with
me. But I could not sleep after three o'clock in the morning in that
room--a quarter past, to be accurate--as a matter of fact, I timed it
with my old pocket chronometer, which still keeps good time, and it
was always at exactly seventeen minutes past three. I wonder whether
that was the hour when she died?</p>

<p>It was not what you have heard. If it had been that, I could not
have stood it two nights. It was just a start and a moan and hard
breathing for a few seconds in the cupboard, and it could never have
waked me under ordinary circumstances, I'm sure. I suppose you are
like me in that, and we are just like other people who have been to
sea. No natural sounds disturb us at all, not all the racket of a
square-rigger hove to in a heavy gale, or rolling on her beam ends
before the wind. But if a lead pencil gets adrift and rattles in the
drawer of your cabin table you are awake in a moment. Just so--you
always understand. Very well, the noise in the cupboard was no louder
than that, but it waked me instantly.</p>

<p>I said it was like a "start". I know what I mean, but it's hard to
explain without seeming to talk nonsense. Of course you cannot
exactly "hear" a person "start"; at the most, you might hear the
quick drawing of the breath between the parted lips and closed teeth,
and the almost imperceptible sound of clothing that moved suddenly
though very slightly. It was like that.</p>

<p>You know how one feels what a sailing vessel is going to do, two
or three seconds before she does it, when one has the wheel. Riders
say the same of a horse, but that's less strange, because the horse
is a live animal with feelings of its own, and only poets and
landsmen talk about a ship being alive, and all that. But I have
always felt somehow that besides being a steaming machine or a
sailing machine for carrying weights, a vessel at sea is a sensitive
instrument, and a means of communication between nature and man, and
most particularly the man at the wheel, if she is steered by hand.
She takes her impressions directly from wind and sea, tide and
stream, and transmits them to the man's hand, just as the wireless
telegraphy picks up the interrupted currents aloft and turns them out
below in the form of a message.</p>

<p>You see what I am driving at; I felt that something started in the
cupboard, and I felt it so vividly that I heard it, though there may
have' been nothing to hear, and the sound inside my head waked me
suddenly. But I really heard the other noise. It was as if it were
muffled inside a box, as far away as if it came through a
long-distance telephone; and yet I knew that it was inside the
cupboard near the head of my bed. My hair did not bristle and my
blood did not run cold that time. I simply resented being waked up by
something that had no business to make a noise, any more than a
pencil should rattle in the drawer of my cabin table on board ship.
For I did not understand; I just supposed that the cupboard had some
communication with the outside air, and that the wind had got in and
was moaning through it with a sort of very faint screech. I struck a
light and looked at my watch, and it was seventeen minutes past
three. Then I turned over and went to sleep on my right ear. That's
my good one; I'm pretty deaf with the other, for I struck the water
with it when I was a lad in diving from the fore-topsail yard. Silly
thing to do, it was, but the result is very convenient when I want to
go to sleep when there's a noise.</p>

<p>That was the first night, and the same thing happened again and
several times afterwards, but not regularly, though it was always at
the same time, to a second; perhaps I was sometimes sleeping on my
good ear, and sometimes not. I overhauled the cupboard and there was
no way by which the wind could get in, or anything else, for the door
makes a good fit, having been meant to keep out moths, I suppose;
Mrs. Pratt must have kept her winter things in it, for it still
smells of camphor and turpentine.</p>

<p>After about a fortnight I had had enough of the noises. So far I
had said to myself that it would be silly to yield to it and take the
skull out of the room. Things always look differently by daylight,
don't they? But the voice grew louder--I suppose one may call it a
voice--and it got inside my deaf ear, too, one night. I realized that
when I was wide awake, for my good ear was jammed down on the pillow,
and I ought not to have heard a foghorn in that position. But I heard
that, and it made me lose my temper, unless it scared me, for
sometimes the two are not far apart. I struck a light and got up, and
I opened the cupboard, grabbed the bandbox and threw it out of the
window, as far as I could.</p>

<p>Then my hair stood on end. The thing screamed in the air, like a
shell from a twelve-inch gun. It fell on the other side of the road.
The night was very dark, and I could not see it fall, but I know it
fell beyond the road The window is just over the front door, it's
fifteen yards to the fence, more or less, and the road is ten yards
wide. There's a thick-set hedge beyond, along the glebe that belongs
to the vicarage.</p>

<p>I did not sleep much more than night. It was not more than half an
hour after I had thrown the bandbox out when I heard a shriek
outside--like what we've had tonight, but worse, more despairing, I
should call it; and it may have been my imagination, but I could have
sworn that the screams came nearer and nearer each time. I lit a
pipe, and walked up and down for a bit, and then took a book and sat
up reading, but I'll be hanged if I can remember what I read nor even
what the book was, for every now and then a shriek came up that would
have made a dead man turn in his coffin.</p>

<p>A little before dawn someone knocked at the front door. There was
no mistaking that for anything else, and I opened my window and
looked down, for I guessed that someone wanted the doctor, supposing
that the new man had taken Luke's house. It was rather a relief to
hear a human knock after that awful noise.</p>

<p>You cannot see the door from above, owing to the little porch. The
knocking came again, and I called out, asking who was there, but
nobody answered, though the knock was repeated. I sang out again, and
said that the doctor did not live here any longer. There was no
answer, but it occurred to me that it might be some old countryman
who was stone deaf. So I took my candle and went down to open the
door. Upon my word, I was not thinking of the thing yet, and I had
almost forgotten the other noises. I went down convinced that I
should find somebody outside, on the doorstep, with a message. I set
the candle on the hall table, so that the wind should not blow it out
when I opened. While I was drawing the old-fashioned bolt I heard the
knocking again. It was not loud, and it had a queer, hollow sound,
now that I was close to it, I remember, but I certainly thought it
was made by some person who wanted to get in.</p>

<p>It wasn't. There was nobody there, but as I opened the door
inward, standing a little on one side, so as to see out at once,
something rolled across the threshold and stopped against my
foot.</p>

<p>I drew back as I felt it, for I knew what it was before I looked
down. I cannot tell you how I knew, and it seemed unreasonable, for I
am still quite sure that I had thrown it across the road. It's a
French window, that opens wide, and I got a good swing when I flung
it out. Besides, when I went out early in the morning, I found the
bandbox beyond the thick hedge.</p>

<p>You may think it opened when I threw it, and that the skull
dropped out; but that's impossible, for nobody could throw an empty
cardboard box so far. It's out of the question; you might as well try
to fling a ball of paper twenty-five yards, or a blown bird's
egg.</p>

<p>To go back, I shut and bolted the hall door, picked the thing up
carefully, and put it on the table beside the candle. I did that
mechanically, as one instinctively does the right thing in danger
without thinking at all--unless one does the opposite. It may seem
odd, but I believe my first thought had been that somebody might come
and find me there on the threshold while it was resting against my
foot, lying a little on its side, and turning one hollow eye up at my
face, as if it meant to accuse me. And the light and shadow from the
candle played in the hollows of the eyes as it stood on the table, so
that they seemed to open and shut at me. Then the candle went out
quite unexpectedly, though the door was fastened and there was not
the least draught; and I used up at least half a dozen matches before
it would burn again.</p>

<p>I sat down rather suddenly, without quite knowing why. Probably I
had been badly frightened, and perhaps you will admit there was no
great shame in being scared. The thing had come home, and it wanted
to go upstairs, back to its cupboard. I sat still and stared at it
for a bit till I began to feel very cold; then I took it and carried
it up and set it in its place, and I remember that I spoke to it, and
promised that it should have its bandbox again in the morning.</p>

<p>You want to know whether I stayed in the room till daybreak? Yes
but I kept a light burning, and sat up smoking and reading, most
likely out of fright; plain, undeniable fear, and you need not call
it cowardice either, for that's not the same thing. I could not have
stayed alone with that thing in the cupboard; I should have been
scared to death, though I'm not more timid than other people.
Confound it all, man, it had crossed the road alone, and had got up
the doorstep and had knocked to be let in.</p>

<p>When the dawn came, I put on my boots and went out to find the
bandbox. I had to go a good way round, by the gate near the high
road, and I found the box open and hanging on the other side of the
hedge. It had caught on the twigs by the string, and the lid had
fallen off and was lying on the ground below it. That shows that it
did not open till it was well over; and if it had not opened as soon
as it left my hand, what was inside it must have gone beyond the road
too.</p>

<p>That's all. I took the box upstairs to the cupboard, and put the
skull back and locked it up. When the girl brought me my breakfast
she said she was sorry, but that she must go, and she did not care if
she lost her month's wages. I looked at her, and her face was a sort
of greenish yellowish white. I pretended to be surprised, and asked
what was the matter; but that was of no use, for she just turned on
me and wanted to know whether I meant to stay in a haunted house, and
how long I expected to live if I did, for though she noticed I was
sometimes a little hard of hearing, she did not believe that even I
could sleep through those screams again--and if I could, why had I
been moving about the house and opening and shutting the front door,
between three and four in the morning? There was no answering that,
since she had heard me, so off she went, and I was left to myself. I
went down to the village during the morning and found a woman who was
willing to come and do the little work there is and cook my dinner,
on condition that she might go home every night. As for me, I moved
downstairs that day, and I have never tried to sleep in the best
bedroom since. After a little while I got a brace of middle-aged
Scotch servants from London, and things were quiet enough for a long
time. I began by telling them that the house was in a very exposed
position, and that the wind whistled round it a good deal in the
autumn and winter, which had given it a bad name in the village, the
Cornish people being inclined to superstition and telling ghost
stories. The two hard-faced, sandy-haired sisters almost smiled, and
they answered with great contempt that they had no great opinion of
any Southern bogey whatever, having been in service in two English
haunted houses, where they had never seen so much as the Boy in Grey,
whom they reckoned no very particular rarity in Forfarshire.</p>

<p>They stayed with me several months, and while they were in the
house we had peace and quiet. One of them is here again now, but she
went away with her sister within the year. This one--she was the
cook--married the sexton, who works in my garden. That's the way of
it. It's a small village and he has not much to do, and he knows
enough about flowers to help me nicely, besides doing most of the
hard work; for though I'm fond of exercise, I'm getting a little
stiff in the hinges. He's a sober, silent sort of fellow, who minds
his own business, and he was a widower when I came here--Trehearn is
his name, James Trehearn. The Scottish sisters would not admit that
there was anything wrong about the house, but when November came they
gave me warning that they were going, on the ground that the chapel
was such a long walk from here, being in the next parish, and that
they could not possibly go to our church. But the younger one came
back in the spring, and as soon as the banns could be published she
was married to James Trehearn by the vicar, and she seems to have had
no scruples about hearing him preach since then. I'm quite satisfied,
if she is! The couple live in a small cottage that looks over the
churchyard.</p>

<p>I suppose you are wondering what all this has to do with what I
was talking about. I'm alone so much that when an old friend comes to
see me, I sometimes go on talking just for the sake of hearing my own
voice. But in this case there is really a connection of ideas. It was
James Trehearn who buried poor Mrs. Pratt, and her husband after her
in the same grave, and it's not far from the back of his cottage.
That's the connection in my mind, you see. It's plain enough. He
knows something; I'm quite sure that he does, though he's such a
reticent beggar.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm alone in the house at night now, for Mrs. Trehearn does
everything herself, and when I have a friend the sexton's niece comes
in to wait on the table. He takes his wife home every evening in
winter, but in summer, when there's light, she goes by herself. She's
not a nervous woman, but she's less sure than she used to be that
there are no bogies in England worth a Scotch-woman's notice. Isn't
it amusing, the idea that Scotland has a monopoly of the
supernatural? Odd sort of national pride, I call that, don't you?</p>

<p>That's a good fire, isn't it? When driftwood gets started at last
there's nothing like it, I think. Yes, we get lots of it, for I'm
sorry to say there are still a great many wrecks about here. It's a
lonely coast, and you may have all the wood you want for the trouble
of bringing it in. Trehearn and I borrow a cart now and then, and
load it between here and the Spit. I hate a coal fire when I can get
wood of any sort A log is company, even if it's only a piece of a
deck beam or timber sawn off, and the salt in it makes pretty sparks.
See how they fly, like Japanese hand-fireworks! Upon my word, with an
old friend and a good fire and a pipe, one forgets all about that
thing upstairs, especially now that the wind has moderated. It's only
a lull, though, and it will blow a gale before morning.</p>

<p>You think you would like to see the skull? I've no objection.
There's no reason why you shouldn't have a look at it, and you never
saw a more perfect one in your life, except that there are two front
teeth missing in the lower jaw.</p>

<p>Oh yes--I had not told you about the jaw yet. Trehearn found it in
the garden last spring when he was digging a pit for a new asparagus
bed. You know we make asparagus beds six or eight feet deep here.
Yes, yes--I had forgotten to tell you that. He was digging straight
down, just as he digs a grave; if you want a good asparagus bed made,
I advise you to get a sexton to make it for you. Those fellows have a
wonderful knack at that sort of digging.</p>

<p>Trehearn had got down about three feet when he cut into a mass of
white lime in the side of the trench. He had noticed that the earth
was a little looser there, though he says it had not been disturbed
for a number of years. I suppose he thought that even old lime might
not be good for asparagus, so he broke it out and threw it up. It was
pretty hard, he says, in biggish lumps, and out of sheer force of
habit he cracked the lumps with his spade as they lay outside the pit
beside him; the jaw bone of the skull dropped out of one of the
pieces. He thinks he must have knocked out the two front teeth in
breaking up the lime, but he did not see them anywhere. He's a very
experienced man in such things, as you may imagine, and he said at
once that the jaw had probably belonged to a young woman, and that
the teeth had been complete when she died. He brought it to me, and
asked me if I wanted to keep it; if I did not, he said he would drop
it into the next grave he made in the churchyard, as he supposed it
was a Christian jaw, and ought to have decent burial, wherever the
rest of the body might be. I told him that doctors often put bones
into quicklime to whiten them nicely, and that I supposed Dr Pratt
had once had a little lime pit in the garden for that purpose, and
had forgotten the jaw. Trehearn looked at me quietly.</p>

<p>"Maybe it fitted that skull that used to be in the cupboard
upstairs, sir," he said. "Maybe Dr Pratt had put the skull into the
lime to clean it, or something, and when he took it out he left the
lower jaw behind. There's some human hair sticking in the lime,
sir."</p>

<p>I saw there was, and that was what Trehearn said. If he did not
suspect something, why in the world should he have suggested that the
jaw might fit the skull? Besides, it did. That's proof that he knows
more than he cares to tell. Do you suppose he looked before she was
buried? Or perhaps--when he buried Luke in the same grave--</p>

<p>Well, well, it's of no use to go over that, is it? I said I would
keep the jaw with the skull, and I took it upstairs and fitted it
into its place. There's not the slightest doubt about the two
belonging together, and together they are.</p>

<p>Trehearn knows several things. We were talking about plastering
the kitchen a while ago, and he happened to remember that it had not
been done since the very week when Mrs. Pratt died. He did not say
that the mason must have left some lime on the place, but he thought
it, and that it was the very same lime he had found in the asparagus
pit. He knows a lot. Trehearn is one of your silent beggars who can
put two and two together. That grave is very near the back of his
cottage, too, and he's one of the quickest men with a spade I ever
saw. If he wanted to know the truth, he could, and no one else would
ever be the wiser unless he chose to tell. In a quiet village like
ours, people don't go and spend the night in the churchyard to see
whether the sexton potters about by himself between ten o'clock and
daylight.</p>

<p>What is awful to think of, is Luke's deliberation, if he did it;
his cool certainty that no one would find him out; above all, his
nerve, for that must have been extraordinary. I sometimes think it's
bad enough to live in the place where it was done, if it really was
done. I always put in the condition, you see, for the sake of his
memory, and a little bit for my own sake, too.</p>

<p>I'll go upstairs and fetch the box in a minute. Let me light my
pipe; there's no hurry! We had supper early, and it's only half-past
nine o'clock. I never let a friend go to bed before twelve, or with
less than three glasses--you may have as many more as you like, but
you shan't have less, for the sake of old times.</p>

<p>It's breezing up again, do you hear? That was only a lull just
now, and we are going to have a bad night.</p>

<p>A thing happened that made me start a little when I found that the
jaw fitted exactly. I'm not very easily startled in that way myself,
but I have seen people make a quick movement, drawing their breath
sharply, when they had thought they were alone and suddenly turned
and saw someone very near them. Nobody can call that fear. You
wouldn't, would you? No. Well, just when I had set the jaw in its
place under the skull, the teeth closed sharply on my finger. It felt
exactly as if it were biting me hard, and I confess that I jumped
before I realized that I had been pressing the jaw and the skull
together with my other hand. I assure you I was not at all nervous.
It was broad daylight, too, and a fine day, and the sun was streaming
into the best bedroom. It would have been absurd to be nervous, and
it was only a quick mistaken impression, but it really made me feel
queer. Somehow it made me think of the funny verdict of the coroner's
jury on Luke's death, "by the hand or teeth of some person or animal
unknown". Ever since that I've wished I had seen those marks on his
throat, though the lower jaw was missing then.</p>

<p>I have often seen a man do insane things with his hands that he
does not realize at all. I once saw a man hanging on by an old awning
stop with one hand, leaning backward, outboard, with all his weight
on it, and he was just cutting the stop with the knife in his other
hand when I got my arms round him. We were in mid-ocean, going twenty
knots. He had not the smallest idea what he was doing; neither had I
when I managed to pinch my finger between the teeth of that thing. I
can feel it now. It was exactly as if it were alive and were trying
to bite me. It would if it could, for I know it hates me, poor thing!
Do you suppose that what rattles about inside is really a bit of
lead? Well, I'll get the box down presently, and if whatever it is
happens to drop out into your hands, that's your affair. If it's only
a clod of earth or a pebble, the whole matter would be off my mind,
and I don't believe I should ever think of the skull again; but
somehow I cannot bring myself to shake out the bit of hard stuff
myself. The mere idea that it may be lead makes me confoundedly
uncomfortable, yet I've got the conviction that I shall know before
long. I shall certainly know. I'm sure Trehearn knows, but he's such
a silent beggar.</p>

<p>I'll go upstairs now and get it. What? You had better go with me?
Ha, ha! do you think I'm afraid of a bandbox and a noise?
Nonsense!</p>

<p>Bother the candle, it won't light! As if the ridiculous thing
understood what it's wanted for! Look at that--the third match. They
light fast enough for my pipe. There, do you see? It's a fresh box,
just out of the tin safe where I keep the supply on account of the
dampness. Oh, you think the wick of the candle may be damp, do you?
All right, I'll light the beastly thing in the fire. That won't go
out, at all events. Yes, it sputters a bit, but it will keep lighted
now. It burns just like any other candle, doesn't it? The fact is,
candles are not very good about here. I don't know where they come
from, but they have a way of burning low occasionally, with a
greenish flame that spits tiny sparks, and I'm often annoyed by their
going out of themselves. It cannot be helped, for it will be long
before we have electricity in our village. It really is rather a poor
light, isn't it?</p>

<p>You think I had better leave you the candle and take the lamp, do
you? I don't like to carry lamps about, that's the truth. I never
dropped one in my life, but I have always thought I might, and it's
so confoundedly dangerous if you do. Besides, I am pretty well used
to these rotten candles by this time.</p>

<p>You may as well finish that glass while I'm getting it, for I
don't mean to let you off with less than three before you go to bed.
You won't have to go upstairs, either, for I've put you in the old
study next to the surgery--that's where I live myself. The fact is, I
never ask a friend to sleep upstairs now. The last man who did was
Crackenthorpe, and he said he was kept awake all night. You remember
old Crack, don't you? He stuck to the Service, and they've just made
him an admiral. Yes, I'm off now--unless the candle goes out. I
couldn't help asking if you remembered Crackenthorpe. If anyone had
told us that the skinny little idiot he used to be was to turn out
the most successful of the lot of us, we should have laughed at the
idea, shouldn't we? You and I did not do badly, it's true--but I'm
really going now. I don't mean to let you think that I've been
putting it off by talking! As if there were anything to be afraid of!
If I were scared, I should tell you so quite frankly, and get you to
go upstairs with me.</p>

<p>Here's the box. I brought it down very carefully, so as not to
disturb it, poor thing. You see, if it were shaken, the jaw might get
separated from it again, and I'm sure it wouldn't like that. Yes, the
candle went out as I was coming downstairs, but that was the draught
from the leaky window on the landing. Did you hear anything? Yes,
there was another scream. Am I pale, do you say? That's nothing. My
heart is a little queer sometimes, and I went upstairs too fast. In
fact, that's one reason why I really prefer to live altogether on the
ground floor.</p>

<p>Wherever the shriek came from, it was not from the skull, for I
had the box in my hand when I heard the noise, and here it is now; so
we have proved definitely that the screams are produced by something
else. I've no doubt I shall find out some day what makes them. Some
crevice in the wall, of course, or a crack in a chimney, or a chink
in the frame of a window. That's the way all ghost stories end in
real life. Do you know, I'm jolly glad I thought of going up and
bringing it down for you to see, for that last shriek settles the
question. To think that I should have been so weak as to fancy that
the poor skull could really cry out like a living thing!</p>

<p>Now I'll open the box, and we'll take it out and look at it under
the bright light. It's rather awful to think that the poor lady used
to sit there, in your chair, evening after evening, in just the same
light, isn't it? But then--I've made up my mind that it's all rubbish
from beginning to end, and that it's just an old skull that Luke had
when he was a student and perhaps he put it into the lime merely to
whiten it, and could not find the jaw.</p>

<p>I made a seal on the string, you see, after I had put the jaw in
its place, and I wrote on the cover. There's the old white label on
it still, from the milliner's, addressed to Mrs. Pratt when the hat
was sent to her, and as there was room I wrote on the edge: "A skull,
once the property of the late Luke Pratt, MD." I don't quite know why
I wrote that, unless it was with the idea of explaining how the thing
happened to be in my possession. I cannot help wondering sometimes
what sort of hat it was that came in the bandbox. What colour was it,
do you think? Was it a gay spring hat with a bobbing feather and
pretty ribands? Strange that the very same box should hold the head
that wore the finery--perhaps. No--we made up our minds that it just
came from the hospital in London where Luke did his time. It's far
better to look at it in that light, isn't it? There's no more
connection between that skull and poor Mrs. Pratt than there was
between my story about the lead and--</p>

<p>Good Lord! Take the lamp--don't let it go out, if you can help
it--I'll have the window fastened again in a second--I say, what a
gale! There, it's out! I told you so! Never mind, there's the
firelight--I've got the window shut--the bolt was only half down. Was
the box blown off the table? Where the deuce is it? There! That won't
open again, for I've put up the bar. Good dodge, an old-fashioned
bar--there's nothing like it. Now, you find the bandbox while I light
the lamp. Confound those wretched matches! Yes, a pipe spill is
better--it must light in the fire--hadn't thought of it--thank
you--there we are again. Now, where's the box? Yes, put it back on
the table, and we'll open it.</p>

<p>That's the first time I have ever known the wind to burst that
window open; but it was partly carelessness on my part when I last
shut it. Yes, of course I heard the scream. It seemed to go all round
the house before it broke in at the window. That proves that it's
always been the wind and nothing else, doesn't it? When it was not
the wind, it was my imagination I've always been a very imaginative
man: I must have been, though I did not know it. As we grow older we
understand ourselves better, don't you know?</p>

<p>I'll have a drop of the Hulstkamp neat, by way of an exception,
since you are filling up your glass. That damp gust chilled me, and
with my rheumatic tendency I'm very much afraid of a chill, for the
cold sometimes seems to stick in my joints all winter when it once
gets in.</p>

<p>By George, that's good stuff! I'll just light a fresh pipe, now
that everything is snug again, and then we'll open the box. I'm so
glad we heard that last scream together, with the skull here on the
table between us, for a thing cannot possibly be in two places at the
same time, and the noise most certainly came from outside, as any
noise the wind makes must. You thought you heard it scream through
the room after the window was burst open? Oh yes, so did I, but that
was natural enough when everything was open. Of course we heard the
wind. What could one expect?</p>

<p>Look here, please. I want you to see that the seal is intact
before we open the box together. Will you take my glasses? No, you
have your own. All right. The seal is sound, you see, and you can
read the words of the motto easily. "Sweet and low"--that's
it--because the poem goes on "Wind of the Western Sea", and says,
"blow him again to me", and all that. Here is the seal on my watch
chain, where it's hung for more than forty years. My poor little wife
gave it to me when I was courting, and I never had any other. It was
just like her to think of those words--she was always fond of
Tennyson.</p>

<p>It's no use to cut the string, for it's fastened to the box, so
I'll just break the wax and untie the knot, and afterwards we'll seal
it up again. You see, I like to feel that the thing is safe in its
place, and that nobody can take it out. Not that I should suspect
Trehearn of meddling with it, but I always feel that he knows a lot
more than he tells.</p>

<p>You see, I've managed it without breaking the string, though when
I fastened it I never expected to open the bandbox again. The lid
comes off easily enough. There! Now look!</p>

<p>What! Nothing in it! Empty! It's gone, man, the skull is gone!</p>

<p>No, there's nothing the matter with me. I'm only trying to collect
my thoughts. It's so strange. I'm positively certain that it was
inside when I put on the seal last spring. I can't have imagined
that: it's utterly impossible. If I ever took a stiff glass with a
friend now and then, I would admit that I might have made some
idiotic mistake when I had taken too much. But I don't, and I never
did. A pint of ale at supper and half a go of rum at bedtime was the
most I ever took in my good days. I believe it's always we sober
fellows who get rheumatism and gout! Yet there was my seal, and there
is the empty bandbox. That's plain enough.</p>

<p>I say, I don't half like this. It's not right. There's something
wrong about it, in my opinion. You needn't talk to me about
supernatural manifestations, for I don't believe in them, not a
little bit! Somebody must have tampered with the seal and stolen the
skull. Sometimes, when I go out to work in the garden in summer, I
leave my watch and chain on the table. Trehearn must have taken the
seal then, and used it, for he would be quite sure that I should not
come in for at least an hour.</p>

<p>If it was not Trehearn--oh, don't talk to me about the possibility
that the thing has got out by itself! If it has, it must be somewhere
about the house, in some out-of-the-way corner, waiting. We may come
upon it anywhere, waiting for us, don't you know?--just waiting in
the dark. Then it will scream at me; it will shriek at me in the
dark, for it hates me, I tell you!</p>

<p>The bandbox is quite empty. We are not dreaming, either of us.
There, I turn it upside down.</p>

<p>What's that? Something fell out as I turned it over. It's on the
floor, it's near your feet. I know it is, and we must find it. Help
me to find it, man. Have you got it? For God's sake, give it to me,
quickly!</p>

<p>Lead! I knew it when I heard it fall. I knew it couldn't be
anything else by the little thud it made on the hearthrug. So it was
lead after all and Luke did it.</p>

<p>I feel a little bit shaken up--not exactly nervous, you know, but
badly shaken up, that's the fact. Anybody would, I should think.
After all, you cannot say that it's fear of the thing, for I went up
and brought it down--at least, I believed I was bringing it down, and
that's the same thing, and by George, rather than give in to such
silly nonsense, I'll take the box upstairs again and put it back in
its place. It's not that. It's the certainty that the poor little
woman came to her end in that way, by my fault, because I told the
story. That's what is so dreadful. Somehow, I had always hoped that I
should never be quite sure of it, but there is no doubting it now.
Look at that!</p>

<p>Look at it! That little lump of lead with no particular shape.
Think of what it did, man! Doesn't it make you shiver? He gave her
something to make her sleep, of course, but there must have been one
moment of awful agony. Think of having boiling lead poured into your
brain. Think of it. She was dead before she could scream, but only
think of--oh! there it is again--it's just outside--I know it's just
outside--I can't keep it out of my head!--oh!--oh!</p>

<p>You thought I had fainted? No, I wish I had, for it would have
stopped sooner. It's all very well to say that it's only a noise, and
that a noise never hurt anybody--you're as white as a shroud
yourself. There's only one thing to be done, if we hope to close an
eye tonight. We must find it and put it back into its bandbox and
shut it up in the cupboard, where it likes to be I don't know how it
got out, but it wants to get in again. That's why it screams so
awfully tonight--it was never so bad as this--never since I
first--</p>

<p>Bury it? Yes, if we can find it, we'll bury it, if it takes us all
night. We'll bury it six feet deep and ram down the earth over it, so
that it shall never get out again, and if it screams, we shall hardly
hear it so deep down. Quick, we'll get the lantern and look for it.
It cannot be far away; I'm sure it's just outside--it was coming in
when I shut the window, I know it.</p>

<p>Yes, you're quite right. I'm losing my senses, and I must get hold
of myself. Don't speak to me for a minute or two; I'll sit quite
still and keep my eyes shut and repeat something I know. That's the
best way.</p>

<p>"Add together the altitude, the latitude, and the polar distance,
divide by two and subtract the altitude from the half-sum; then add
the logarithm of the secant of the latitude, the cosecant of the
polar distance, the cosine of the half-sum and the sine of the
half-sum minus the altitude"--there! Don't say that I'm out of my
senses, for my memory is all right, isn't it?</p>

<p>Of course, you may say that it's mechanical, and that we never
forget the things we learned when we were boys and have used almost
every day for a lifetime. But that's the very point. When a man is
going crazy, it's the mechanical part of his mind that gets out of
order and won't work right; he remembers things that never happened,
or he sees things that aren't real, or he hears noises when there is
perfect silence. That's not what is the matter with either of us, is
it?</p>

<p>Come, we'll get the lantern and go round the house. It's not
raining--only blowing like old boots, as we used to say. The lantern
is in the cupboard under the stairs in the hall, and I always keep it
trimmed in case of a wreck.</p>

<p>No use to look for the thing? I don't see how you can say that. It
was nonsense to talk of burying it, of course, for it doesn't want to
be buried; it wants to go back into its bandbox and be taken
upstairs, poor thing! Trehearn took it out, I know, and made the seal
over again. Perhaps he took it to the churchyard, and he may have
meant well. I dare say he thought that it would not scream any more
if it were quietly laid in consecrated ground, near where it belongs.
But it has come home. Yes, that's it. He's not half a bad fellow,
Trehearn, and rather religiously inclined, I think. Does not that
sound natural, and reasonable, and well meant? He supposed it
screamed because it was not decently buried--with the rest. But he
was wrong. How should he know that it screams at me because it hates
me, and because it's my fault that there was that little lump of lead
in it?</p>

<p>No use to look for it, anyhow? Nonsense! I tell you it wants to be
found--Hark! what's that knocking? Do you hear it?
Knock--knock--knock--three times, then a pause, and then again. It
has a hollow sound, hasn't it?</p>

<p>It has come home. I've heard that knock before. It wants to come
in and be taken upstairs in its box. It's at the front door.</p>

<p>Will you come with me? We'll take it in. Yes, I own that I don't
like to go alone and open the door. The thing will roll in and stop
against my foot, just as it did before, and the light will go out.
I'm a good deal shaken by finding that bit of lead, and, besides, my
heart isn't quite right--too much strong tobacco, perhaps. Besides,
I'm quite willing to own that I'm a bit nervous tonight, if I never
was before in my life.</p>

<p>That's right, come along! I'll take the box with me, so as not to
come back. Do you hear the knocking? It's not like any other knocking
I ever heard. If you will hold this door open, I can find the lantern
under the stairs by the light from this room without bringing the
lamp into the hall--it would only go out.</p>

<p>The thing knows we are coming--hark! It's impatient to get in.
Don't shut the door till the lantern is ready, whatever you do. There
will be the usual trouble with the matches, I suppose--no, the first
one, by Jove! I tell you it wants to get in, so there's no trouble.
All right with that door now; shut it, please. Now come and hold the
lantern, for it's blowing so hard outside that I shall have to use
both hands. That's it, hold the light low. Do you hear the knocking
still? Here goes--I'll open just enough with my foot against the
bottom of the door--now!</p>

<p>Catch it! it's only the wind that blows it across the floor,
that's all--there s half a hurricane outside, I tell you! Have you
got it? The bandbox is on the table. One minute, and I'll have the
bar up. There!</p>

<p>Why did you throw it into the box so roughly? It doesn't like
that, you know.</p>

<p>What do you say? Bitten your hand? Nonsense, man! You did just
what I did. You pressed the jaws together with your other hand and
pinched yourself. Let me see. You don't mean to say you have drawn
blood? You must have squeezed hard by Jove, for the skin is certainly
torn. I'll give you some carbolic solution for it before we go to
bed, for they say a scratch from a skull's tooth may go bad and give
trouble.</p>

<p>Come inside again and let me see it by the lamp. I'll bring the
bandbox--never mind the lantern, it may just as well burn in the hall
for I shall need it presently when I go up the stairs. Yes, shut the
door if you will; it makes it more cheerful and bright. Is your
finger still bleeding? I'll get you the carbolic in an instant; just
let me see the thing.</p>

<p>Ugh! There's a drop of blood on the upper jaw. It's on the
eyetooth. Ghastly, isn't it? When I saw it running along the floor of
the hall, the strength almost went out of my hands, and I felt my
knees bending, then I understood that it was the gale, driving it
over the smooth boards. You don t blame me? No, I should think not!
We were boys together, and we've seen a thing or two, and we may just
as well own to each other that we were both in a beastly funk when it
slid across the floor at you. No wonder you pinched your finger
picking it up, after that, if I did the same thing out of sheer
nervousness, in broad daylight, with the sun streaming in on me.</p>

<p>Strange that the jaw should stick to it so closely, isn't it? I
suppose it's the dampness, for it shuts like a vice--I have wiped off
the drop of blood, for it was not nice to look at. I'm not going to
try to open the jaws, don't be afraid! I shall not play any tricks
with the poor thing, but I'll just seal the box again, and we'll take
it upstairs and put it away where it wants to be. The wax is on the
writing-table by the window. Thank you. It will be long before I
leave my seal lying about again, for Trehearn to use, I can tell you.
Explain? I don't explain natural phenomena, but if you choose to
think that Trehearn had hidden it somewhere in the bushes, and that
the gale blew it to the house against the door, and made it knock, as
if it wanted to be let in, you're not thinking the impossible, and
I'm quite ready to agree with you.</p>

<p>Do you see that? You can swear that you've actually seen me seal
it this time, in case anything of the kind should occur again. The
wax fastens the strings to the lid, which cannot possibly be lifted,
even enough to get in one finger. You're quite satisfied, aren't you?
Yes. Besides, I shall lock the cupboard and keep the key in my pocket
hereafter.</p>

<p>Now we can take the lantern and go upstairs. Do you know? I'm very
much inclined to agree with your theory that the wind blew it against
the house. I'll go ahead, for I know the stairs; just hold the
lantern near my feet as we go up. How the wind howls and whistles!
Did you feel the sand on the floor under your shoes as we crossed the
hall?</p>

<p>Yes--this is the door of the best bedroom. Hold up the lantern,
please. This side, by the head of the bed. I left the cupboard open
when I got the box. Isn't it queer how the faint odour of women's
dresses will hang about an old closet for years? This is the shelf.
You've seen me set the box there, and now you see me turn the key and
put it into my pocket. So that's done!</p>

<p>Goodnight. Are you sure you're quite comfortable? It's not much of
a room, but I dare say you would as soon sleep here as upstairs
tonight. If you want anything, sing out; there's only a lath and
plaster partition between us. There's not so much wind on this side
by half. There's the Hollands on the table, if you'll have one more
nightcap. No? Well, do as you please. Goodnight again, and don't
dream about that thing, if you can.</p>

<p>The following paragraph appeared in the Penraddon News, 23rd
November 1906:</p>

<p>MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF A RETIRED SEA CAPTAIN</p>

<p>The village of Tredcombe is much disturbed by the strange death of
Captain Charles Braddock, and all sorts of impossible stories are
circulating with regard to the circumstances, which certainly seem
difficult of explanation. The retired captain, who had successfully
commanded in his time the largest and fastest liners belonging to one
of the principal transatlantic steamship companies, was found dead in
his bed on Tuesday morning in his own cottage, a quarter of a mile
from the village. An examination was made at once by the local
practitioner, which revealed the horrible fact that the deceased had
been bitten in the throat by a human assailant, with such amazing
force as to crush the windpipe and cause death. The marks of the
teeth of both jaws were so plainly visible on the skin that they
could be counted, but the perpetrator of the deed had evidently lost
the two lower middle incisors. It is hoped that this peculiarity may
help to identify the murderer, who can only be a dangerous escaped
maniac. The deceased, though over sixty-five years of age, is said to
have been a hale man of considerable physical strength, and it is
remarkable that no signs of any struggle were visible in the room,
nor could it be ascertained how the murderer had entered the house.
Warning has been sent to all the insane asylums in the United
Kingdom, but as yet no information has been received regarding the
escape of any dangerous patient.</p>

<p>The coroner's Jury returned the somewhat singular verdict that
Captain Braddock came to his death "by the hands or teeth of some
person unknown". The local surgeon is said to have expressed
privately the opinion that the maniac is a woman, a view he deduces
from the small size of the jaws, as shown by the marks of the teeth.
The whole affair is shrouded in mystery. Captain Braddock was a
widower, and lived alone. He leaves no children.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3"></a>Man Overboard!</h2>

<p>YES--I have heard "Man over-board!" a good many times since I was
a boy, and once or twice I have seen the man go. There are more men
lost in that way than passengers on ocean steamers ever learn of. I
have stood looking over the rail on a dark night, when there was a
step beside me, and something flew past my head like a big black
bat--and then there was a splash! Stokers often go like that. They go
mad with the heat, and they slip up on deck and are gone before
anybody can stop them, often without being seen or heard. Now and
then a passenger will do it, but he generally has what he thinks a
pretty good reason. I have seen a man empty his revolver into a crowd
of emigrants forward, and then go over like a rocket. Of course, any
officer who respects himself will do what he can to pick a man up, if
the weather is not so heavy that he would have to risk his ship; but
I don't think I remember seeing a man come back when he was once
fairly gone more than two or three times in all my life, though we
have often picked up the life-buoy, and sometimes the fellow's cap.
Stokers and passengers jump over; I never knew a sailor to do that,
drunk or sober. Yes, they say it has happened on hard ships, but I
never knew a case myself. Once in a long time a man is fished out
when it is just too late, and dies in the boat before you can get him
aboard, and--well, I don't know that I ever told that story since it
happened--I knew a fellow who went over, and came back dead. I didn't
see him after he came back; only one of us did, but we all knew he
was there.</p>

<p>No, I am not giving you "sharks." There isn't a shark in this
story, and I don't know that I would tell it at all if we weren't
alone, just you and I. But you and I have seen things in various
parts, and maybe you will understand. Anyhow, you know that I am
telling what I know about, and nothing else; and it has been on my
mind to tell you ever since it happened, only there hasn't been a
chance.</p>

<p>It's a long story, and it took some time to happen; and it began a
good many years ago, in October, as well as I can remember. I was
mate then; I passed the local Marine Board for master about three
years later. She was the Helen B. Jackson, of New York, with lumber
for the West Indies, four-masted schooner, Captain Hackstaff. She was
an old-fashioned one, even then--no steam donkey, and all to do by
hand. There were still sailors in the coasting trade in those days,
you remember. She wasn't a hard ship, for the old man was better than
most of them, though he kept to himself and had a face like a
monkey-wrench. We were thirteen, all told, in the ship's company; and
some of them afterwards thought that might have had something to do
with it, but I had all that nonsense knocked out of me when I was a
boy. I don't mean to say that I like to go to sea on a Friday, but I
have gone to sea on a Friday, and nothing has happened; and twice
before that we have been thirteen, because one of the hands didn't
turn up at the last minute, and nothing ever happened either--nothing
worse than the loss of a light spar or two, or a little canvas.
Whenever I have been wrecked, we had sailed as cheerily as you
please--no thirteens, no Fridays, no dead men in the hold. I believe
it generally happens that way.</p>

<p>I dare say you remember those two Benton boys that were so much
allke? It is no wonder, for they were twin brothers. They shipped
with us as boys on the old Boston Belle, when you were mate and I was
before the mast. I never was quite sure which was which of those two,
even then; and when they both had beards it was harder than ever to
tell them apart. One was Jim, and the other was Jack; James Benton
and John Benton. The only difference I ever could see was, that one
seemed to be rather more cheerful and inclined to talk than the
other; but one couldn't even be sure of that. Perhaps, they had
moods. Anyhow, there was one of them that used to whistle when he was
alone. He only knew one tune, and that was "Nancy Lee," and the other
didn't know any tune at all; but I may be mistaken about that, too.
Perhaps they both knew it.</p>

<p>Well, those two Benton boys turned up on board the Helen B.
Jackson. They had been on half a dozen ships since the Boston Belle,
and they had grown up and were good seamen. They had reddish beards
and bright blue eyes and freckled faces; and they were quiet fellows,
good workmen on rigging, pretty willing, and both good men at the
wheel. They managed to be in the same watch--it was the port watch on
the Helen B., and that was mine, and I had great confidence in them
both. If there was any job aloft that needed two hands, they were
always the first to jump into the rigging; but that doesn't often
happen on a fore-and-aft schooner. If it breezed up, and the
jibtopsail was to be taken in, they never minded a wetting, and they
would be out at the bowsprit end before there was a hand at the
downhaul. The men liked them for that, and because they didn't blow
about what the could do. I remember one day in a reefing job, the
downhaul parted and came do on deck from the peak of the spanker.
When the weather moderated, and we shook the reefs out, the downhaul
was forgotten until we happened to think we might soon need it again.
There was some sea on, and the boom was off and the gaff was
slamming. One of those Benton boys was at the wheel, and before I
knew what he was doing, the other was out on the gaff with the end of
the new downhaul, trying to reeve it through its block. The one who
was steering watched him, and got as white as cheese. The other one
was swinging about on the gaff end, and every time she rolled to
leeward he brought up with a jerk that would have sent anything but a
monkey flying into space. But he didn't leave it until he had rove
the new rope, and he got back all right. I think it was Jack at the
wheel; the one that seemed more cheerful, the one that whistled
"Nancy Lee." He had rather have been doing the job himself than watch
his brother do it, and he had a scared look; but he kept her as
steady as he could in the swell, and he drew a long breath when Jim
had worked his way back to the peak-halliard block, and had something
to hold on to. I think it was Jim.</p>

<p>They had good togs, too, and they were neat and clean men in the
forecastle. I knew they had nobody belonging to them ashore,--no
mother, no sisters, and no wives; but somehow they both looked as if
a woman overhauled them now and then. I remember that they had one
ditty bag between them, and they had a woman's thimble in it. One of
the men said something about it to them, and they looked at each
other; and one smiled, but the other didn't. Most of their clothes
were alike, but they had one red guernsey between them. For some time
I used to think it was always the same one that wore it, and I
thought that might be a way to tell them apart. But then I heard one
asking the other for it, and saying that the other had worn it last.
So that was no sign either. The cook was a West Indiaman, called
James Lawley; his father had been hanged for putting lights in
cocoanut [sic] trees where they didn't belong. But he was a good
cook, and knew his business; and it wasn't soup-and-bully and
dog's-body every Sunday. That's what I meant to say. On Sunday the
cook called both those boys Jim, and on week-days he called them
Jack. He used to say he must be right sometimes if he did that,
because even the hands on a painted clock point right twice a
day.</p>

<p>What started me to trying for some way of telling the Bentons
apart was this. I heard them talking about a girl. It was at night,
in our watch, and the wind had headed us off a little rather
suddenly, and when we had flattened in the jibs, we clewed down the
topsails, while the two Benton boys got the spanker sheet aft. One of
them was at the helm. I coiled down the mizzen-topsail downhaul
myself, and was going aft to see how she headed up, when I stopped to
look at a light, and leaned against the deck-house. While I was
standing there I heard the two boys talking. It sounded as if they
had talked of the same thing before, and as far as I could tell, the
voice I heard first belonged to the one who wasn't quite so cheerful
as the other,--the one who was Jim when one knew which he was.</p>

<p>"Does Mamie know?" Jim asked.</p>

<p>"Not yet," Jack answered quietly. He was at the wheel. "I mean to
tell her next time we get home."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>That was all I heard, because I didn't care to stand there
listening while they were talking about their own affairs; so I went
aft to look into the binnacle, and I told the one at the wheel to
keep her so as long as she had way on her, for I thought the wind
would back up again before long, and there was land to leeward. When
he answered, his voice, somehow, didn't sound like the cheerful one.
Perhaps his brother had relieved the wheel while they had been
speaking, but what I had heard set me wondering which of them it was
that had a girl at home. There's lots of time for wondering on a
schooner in fair weather.</p>

<p>After that I thought I noticed that the two brothers were more
silent when they were together. Perhaps they guessed that I had
overheard something that night, and kept quiet when I was about. Some
men would have amused themselves by trying to chaff them separately
about the girl at home, and I suppose whichever one it was would have
let the cat out of the bag if I had done that. But, somehow, I didn't
like to. Yes, I was thinking of getting married myself at that time,
so I had a sort of fellow-feeling for whichever one it was, that made
me not want to chaff him.</p>

<p>They didn't talk much, it seemed to me; but in fair weather, when
there was nothing to do at night, and one was steering, the other was
everlastingly hanging round as if he were waiting to relieve the
wheel, though he might have been enjoying a quiet nap for all I cared
in such weather. Or else, when one was taking his turn at the
lookout, the other would be sitting on an anchor beside him. One kept
near the other, at night more than in the daytime. I noticed that.
They were fond of sitting on that anchor, and they generally tucked
away their pipes under it for the Helen B. was a dry boat in most
weather, and like most fore-and-afters was better on a wind than
going free. With a beam sea we sometimes shipped a little water aft.
We were by the stern, anyhow, on that voyage, and that is one reason
why we lost the man.</p>

<p>We fell in with a southerly gale, southeast at first; and then the
barometer began to fall while you could watch it, and a long swell
began to come up from the south'ard. A couple of months earlier we
might have been in for a cyclone, but it's "October all over" in
those waters, as you know better than I. It was just going to blow,
and then it was going to rain, that was all; and we had plenty of
time to make everything snug before it breezed up much. It blew
harder after sunset, and by the time it was quite dark it was a full
gale. We had shortened sail for it, but as we were by the stern we
were carrying the spanker close reefed instead of the storm trysail.
She steered better so, as long as we didn't have to heave to. I had
the first watch with the Benton boys, and we had not been on deck an
hour when a child might have seen that the weather meant
business.</p>

<p>The old man came up on deck and looked round, and in less than a
minute he told us to give her the trysail. That meant heaving to, and
I was glad of it; for though the Helen B. was a good vessel enough,
she wasn't a new ship by a long way, and it did her no good to drive
her in that weather. I asked whether I should call all hands, but
just then the cook came aft, and the old man said he thought we could
manage the job without waking the sleepers, and the trysail was handy
on deck already, for we hadn't been expecting anything better. We
were all in oilskins, of course, and the night was as black as a coal
mine, with only a ray of light from the slit in the binnacle shield,
and you couldn't tell one man from another except by his voice. The
old man took the wheel; we got the boom amidships, and he jammed her
into the wind until she had hardly any way. It was blowing now, and
it was all that I and two others could do to get in the slack of the
downhaul, while the others lowered away at the peak and throat, and
we had our hands full to get a couple of turns round the wet sail.
It's all child's play on a fore-and-after compared with reefing
topsails in anything like weather, but the gear of a schooner
sometimes does unhandy things that you don't expect, and those
everlasting long halliards get foul of everything if they get adrift.
I remember thinking how unhandy that particular job was. Somebody
unhooked the throat-halliard block, and thought he had hooked it into
the head-cringle of the trysail, and sang out to hoist away, but he
had missed it in the dark, and the heavy block went flying into the
lee rigging, and nearly killed him when it swung back with the
weather roll. Then the old man got her up in the wind until the jib
was shaking like thunder; then he held her off, and she went off as
soon as the head-sails filled, and he couldn't get her back again
without the spanker. Then the Helen B. did her favourite trick, and
before we had time to say much we had a sea over the quarter and were
up to our waists, with the parrels of the trysail only half becketed
round the mast, and the deck so full of gear that you couldn't put
your foot on a plank, and the spanker beginning to get adrift again,
being badly stopped, and the general confusion and hell's delight
that you can only have on a fore-and-after when there's nothing
really serious the matter. Of course, I don't mean to say that the
old man couldn't have steered his trick as well as you or I or any
other seaman; but I don't believe he had ever been on board the Helen
B. before, or had his hand on her wheel till then; and he didn't know
her ways. I don't mean to say that what happened was his fault. I
don't know whose fault it was. Perhaps nobody was to blame. But I
knew something happened somewhere on board when we shipped that sea,
and you'll never get it out of my head. I hadn't any spare time
myself, for I was becketing the rest of the trysail to the mast. We
were on the starboard tack, and the throat-halliard came down to port
as usual, and I suppose there were at least three men at it, hoisting
away, while I was at the beckets.</p>

<p>Now I am going to tell you something. You have known me, man and
boy, several voyages; and you are older than I am; and you have
always been a good friend to me. Now, do you think I am the sort of
man to think I hear things where there isn't anything to hear, or to
think I see things when there is nothing to see? No, you don't. Thank
you. Well now, I had passed the last becket, and I sang out to the
men to sway away, and I was standing on the jaws of the spanker-gaff,
with my left hand on the bolt-rope of the trysail, so that I could
feel when it was board-taut, and I wasn't thinking of anything except
being glad the job was over, and that we were going to heave her to.
It was as black as a coal-pocket, except that you could see the
streaks on the seas as they went by, and abaft the deck-house I could
see the ray of light from the binnacle on the captain's yellow
oilskin as he stood at the wheel--or rather I might have seen it if I
had looked round at that minute. But I didn't look round. I heard a
man whistling. It was "NancyLee," and I could have sworn that the man
was right over my head in the crosstrees. Only somehow I knew very
well that if anybody could have been up there, and could have
whistled a tune, there were no living ears sharp enough to hear it on
deck then. I heard it distinctly, and at the same time I heard the
real whistling of the wind in the weather rigging, sharp and clear as
the steam-whistle on a Dago's peanut-cart in New York. That was all
right, that was as it should be; but the other wasn't right; and I
felt queer and stiff, as if I couldn't move, and my hair was curling
against the flannel lining of my sou'wester, and I thought somebody
had dropped a lump of ice down my back.</p>

<p>I said that the noise of the wind in the rigging was real, as if
the other wasn't, for I felt that it wasn't, though I heard it. But
it was, all the same; for the captain heard it, too. When I came to
relieve the wheel, while the men were clearing up decks, he was
swearing. He was a quiet man, and I hadn't heard him swear before,
and I don't think I did again, though several queer things happened
after that. Perhaps he said all he had to say then; I don't see how
he could have said anything more. I used to think nobody could swear
like a Dane, except a Neapolitan or a South American; but when I had
heard the old man I changed my mind. There's nothing afloat or ashore
that can beat one of your quiet American skippers, if he gets off on
that tack. I didn't need to ask him what was the matter, for I knew
he had heard "Nancy Lee," as I had, only it affected us
differently.</p>

<p>He did not give me the wheel, but told me to go forward and get
the second bonnet off the staysail, so as to keep her up better. As
we tailed on to the sheet when it was done, the man next me knocked
his sou'wester off against my shoulder, and his face came so close to
me that I could see it in the dark. It must have been very white for
me to see it, but I only thought of that afterwards. I don't see how
any light could have fallen upon it, but I knew it was one of the
Benton boys. I don't know what made me speak to him. "Hullo, Jim! Is
that you?" I asked. I don't know why I said Jim, rather than
Jack.</p>

<p>"I am Jack," he answered.</p>

<p>We made all fast, and things were much quieter.</p>

<p>"The old man heard you whistling 'Nancy Lee,' just now," I said,
"and he didn't like it."</p>

<p>It was as if there were a white light inside his face, and it was
ghastly. I know his teeth chattered. But he didn't say anything, and
the next minute he was somewhere in the dark trying to find his
sou'wester at the foot of the mast.</p>

<p>When all was quiet, and she was hove to, coming to and falling off
her four points as regularly as a pendulum, and the helm lashed a
little to the lee, the old man turned in again, and I managed to
light a pipe in the lee of the deckhouse, for there was nothing more
to be done till the gale chose to moderate, and the ship was as easy
as a baby in its cradle. Of course the cook had gone below, as he
might have done an hour earlier; so there were supposed to be four of
us in the watch. There was a man at the lookout, and there was a hand
by the wheel, though there was no steering to be done, and I was
having my pipe in the lee of the deck-house, and the fourth man was
somewhere about decks, probably having a smoke too. I thought some
skippers I had sailed with would have called the watch aft, and given
them a drink after that job, but it wasn't cold, and I guessed that
our old man wouldn't be particularly generous in that way. My hands
and feet were red-hot, and it would be time enough to get into dry
clothes when it was my watch below; so I stayed where I was, and
smoked. But by and by, things being so quiet, I began to wonder why
nobody moved on deck; just that sort of restless wanting to know
where every man is that one sometimes feels in a gale of wind on a
dark night. So when I had finished my pipe I began to move about. I
went aft, and there was a man leaning over the wheel, with his legs
apart and both hands hanging down in the light from the binnacle, and
his sou'wester over his eyes. Then I went forward, and there was a
man at the lookout, with his back against the foremast, getting what
shelter he could from the staysail. I knew by his small height that
he was not one of the Benton boys. Then I went round by the weather
side, and poked about in the dark, for I began to wonder where the
other man was. But I couldn't find him, though I searched the decks
until I got right aft again. It was certainly one of the Benton boys
that was missing, but it wasn't like either of them to go below to
change his clothes in such warm weather. The man at the wheel was the
other, of course. I spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Jim, what's become of your brother?"</p>

<p>"I am Jack, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Jack, where's Jim? He's not on deck."</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>When I had come up to him he had stood up from force of instinct,
and had laid his hands on the spokes as if he were steering, though
the wheel was lashed; but he still bent his face down, and it was
half hidden by the edge of his sou'wester, while he seemed to be
staring at the compass. He spoke in a very low voice, but that was
natural, for the captain had left his door open when he turned in, as
it was a warm night in spite of the storm, and there was no fear of
shipping any more water now.</p>

<p>"What put it into your head to whistle like that, Jack? You've
been at sea long enough to know better."</p>

<p>He said something, but I couldn't hear the words; it sounded as if
he were denying the charge.</p>

<p>"Somebody whistled," I said.</p>

<p>He didn't answer, and then, I don't know why, perhaps because the
old man hadn't given us a drink, I cut half an inch off the plug of
tobacco I had in my oilskin pocket, and gave it to him. He knew my
tobacco was good, and he shoved it into his mouth with a word of
thanks. I was on the weather side of the wheel.</p>

<p>"Go forward and see if you can find Jim," I said.</p>

<p>He started a little, and then stepped back and passed behind me,
and was going along the weather side. Maybe his silence about the
whistling had irritated me, and his taking it for granted that
because we were hove to and it was a dark night, he might go forward
any way he pleased. Anyhow, I stopped him, though I spoke
good-naturedly enough.</p>

<p>"Pass to leeward, Jack," I said.</p>

<p>He didn't answer, but crossed the deck between the binnacle and
the deckhouse to the lee side. She was only falling off and coming
to, and riding the big seas as easily as possible, but the man was
not steady on his feet and reeled against the corner of the deckhouse
and then against the lee rail. I was quite sure he couldn't have had
anything to drink, for neither of the brothers were the kind to hide
rum from their shipmates, if they had any, and the only spirits that
were aboard were locked up in the captain's cabin. I wondered whether
he had been hit by the throat-halliard block and was hurt.</p>

<p>I left the wheel and went after him, but when I got to the corner
of the deck-house I saw that he was on a full run forward, so I went
back. I watched the compass for a while, to see how far she went off,
and she must have come to again half a dozen times before I heard
voices, more than three or four, forward; and then I heard the little
West Indies cook's voice, high and shrill above' the rest:--</p>

<p>"Man overboard!"</p>

<p>There wasn't anything to be done, with the ship hove-to and the
wheel lashed. If there was a man overboard, he must be in the water
right alongside. I couldn't imagine how it could have happened, but I
ran forward instinctively. I came upon the cook first, half-dressed
in his shirt and trousers, just as he had tumbled out of his bunk. He
was jumping into the main rigging, evidently hoping to see the man,
as if any one could have seen anything on such a night, except the
foam-streaks on the black water, and now and then the curl of a
breaking sea as it went away to leeward. Several of the men were
peering over the rail into the dark. I caught the cook by the foot,
and asked who was gone.</p>

<p>"It's Jim Benton," he shouted down to me. "He's not aboard this
ship!"</p>

<p>There was no doubt about that Jim Benton was gone; and I knew in a
flash that he had been taken off by that sea when we were setting the
storm trysail. It was nearly half an hour since then; she had run
like wild for a few minutes until we got her hove-to, and no swimmer
that ever swam could have lived as long as that in such a sea. The
men knew it as well as I, but still they stared into the foam as if
they had any chance of seeing the lost man. I let the cook get into
the rigging and joined the men, and asked if they had made a thorough
search on board, though I knew they had and that it could not take
long, for he wasn't on deck, and there was only the forecastle
below.</p>

<p>"That sea took him over, sir, as sure as you're born," said one of
the men close beside me.</p>

<p>We had no boat that could have lived in that sea, of course, and
we all knew it. I offered to put one over, and let her drift astern
two or three cable's-lengths by a line, if the men thought they could
haul me aboard again; but none of them would listen to that, and I
should probably have been drowned if I had tried it, even with a
life-belt; for it was a breaking sea. Besides, they all knew as well
as I did that the man could not be right in our wake. I don't know
why I spoke again.</p>

<p>"Jack Benton, are you there? Will you go if I will?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered a voice; and that was all.</p>

<p>By that time the old man was on deck, and I felt his hand on my
shoulder rather roughly, as if he meant to shake me.</p>

<p>"I'd reckoned you had more sense, Mr. Torkeldsen," he said. "God
knows I would risk my ship to look for him, if it were any use; but
he must have gone half an hour ago."</p>

<p>He was a quiet man, and the men knew he was right, and that they
had seen the last of Jim Benton when they were bending the
trysail--if anybody had seen him then. The captain went below again,
and for some time the men stood around Jack, quite near him, without
saying anything, as sailors do when they are sorry for a man and
can't help him; and then the watch below turned in again, and we were
three on deck.</p>

<p>Nobody can understand that there can be much consolation in a
funeral, unless he has felt that blank feeling there is when a man's
gone overboard whom everybody likes. I suppose landsmen think it
would be easier if they didn't have to bury their fathers and mothers
and friends; but it wouldn't be. Somehow the funeral keeps up the
idea of something beyond. You may believe in that something just the
same; but a man who has gone in the dark, between two seas, without a
cry, seems much more beyond reach than if he were still lying on his
bed, and had only just stopped breathing. Perhaps Jim Benton knew
that, and wanted to come back to us. I don't know, and I am only
telling you what happened, and you may think what you like.</p>

<p>Jack stuck by the wheel that night until the watch was over. I
don't know whether he slept afterwards, but when I came on deck four
hours later, there he was again, in his oilskins, with his sou'wester
over his eyes, staring into the binnacle. We saw that he would rather
stand there, and we left him alone. Perhaps it was some consolation
to him to get that ray of light when everything was so dark. It began
to rain, too, as it can when a southerly gale is going to break up,
and we got every bucket and tub on board, and set them under the
booms to catch the fresh water for washing our clothes. The rain made
it very thick, and I went and stood under the lee of the staysail,
looking out. I could tell that day was breaking, because the foam was
whiter in the dark where the seas crested, and little by little the
black rain grew grey and steamy, and I couldn't see the red glare of
the port light on the water when she went off and rolled to leeward.
The gale had moderated considerably, and in another hour we should be
under way again. I was still standing there when Jack Benton came
forward. He stood still a few minutes near me. The rain came down in
a solid sheet, and I could see his wet beard and a corner of his
cheek, too, grey in the dawn. Then he stooped down and began feeling
under the anchor for his pipe. We had hardly shipped any water
forward, and I suppose he had some way of tucking the pipe in, so
that the rain hadn't floated it off. Presently he got on his legs
again, and I saw that he had two pipes in his hand. One of them had
belonged to his brother, and after looking at them a moment I suppose
he recognised his own, for he put it in his mouth, dripping with
water. Then he looked at the other fully a minute without moving.
When he had made up his mind, I suppose, he quietly chucked it over
the lee rail, without even looking round to see whether I was
watching him. I thought it was a pity, for it was a good wooden pipe,
with a nickel ferrule, and somebody would have been glad to have it.
But I didn't like to make any remark, for he had a right to do what
he pleased with what had belonged to his dead brother. He blew the
water out of his own pipe, and dried it against his jacket, putting
his hand inside his oilskin; he filled it, standing under the lee of
the foremast, got a light after wasting two or three matches, and
turned the pipe upside down in his teeth, to keep the rain out of the
bowl. I don't know why I noticed everything he did, and remember it
now; but somehow I felt sorry for him, and I kept wondering whether
there was anything I could say that would make him feel better. But I
didn't think of anything, and as it was broad daylight I went aft
again, for I guessed that the old man would turn out before long and
order the spanker set and the helm up. But he didn't turn out before
seven bells, just as the clouds broke and showed blue sky to
leeward--"the Frenchman's barometer," you used to call it.</p>

<p>Some people don't seem to be so dead, when they are dead, as
others are. Jim Benton was like that. He had been on my watch, and I
couldn't get used to the idea that he wasn't about decks with me. I
was always expecting to see him, and his brother was so exactly like
him that I often felt as if I did see him and forgot he was dead, and
made the mistake of calling Jack by his name; though I tried not to,
because I knew it must hurt. If ever Jack had been the cheerful one
of the two, as I had always supposed he had been, he had changed very
much, for he grew to be more silent than Jim had ever been.</p>

<p>One fine afternoon I was sitting on the main-hatch, overhauling
the clockwork of the taffrail-log, which hadn't been registering very
well of late, and I had got the cook to bring me a coffeecup to hold
the small screws as I took them out, and a saucer for the sperm-oil I
was going to use. I noticed that he didn't go away, but hung round
without exactly watching what I was doing, as if he wanted to say
something to me. I thought if it were worth much he would say it
anyhow, so I didn't ask him questions; and sure enough he began of
his own accord before long. There was nobody on deck but the man at
the wheel, and the other man away forward.</p>

<p>"Mr. Torkeldsen," the cook began, and then stopped.</p>

<p>I supposed he was going to ask me to let the watch break out a
barrel of flour, or some salt horse.</p>

<p>"Well, doctor?" I asked, as he didn't go on.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Torkeldsen," he answered, "I somehow want to ask you
whether you think I am giving satisfaction on this ship, or not?"</p>

<p>"So far as I know, you are, doctor. I haven't heard any complaints
from the forecastle, and the captain has said nothing, and I think
you know your business, and the cabin-boy is bursting out of his
clothes. That looks as if you are giving satisfaction. What makes you
think you are not?"</p>

<p>I am not good at giving you that West Indies talk, and sha'n't
try; but the doctor beat about the bush awhile, and then he told me
he thought the men were beginning to play tricks on him, and he
didn't like it, and thought he hadn't deserved it, and would like his
discharge at our next port. I told him he was a d--d fool, of course,
to begin with; and that men were more apt to try a joke with a chap
they liked than with anybody they wanted to get rid of; unless it was
a bad joke, like flooding his bunk, or filling his boots with tar.
But it wasn't that kind of practical joke. The doctor said that the
men were trying to frighten him, and he didn't like it, and that they
put things in his way that frightened him. So I told him he was a
d--d fool to be frightened, anyway, and I wanted to know what things
they put in his way. He gave me a queer answer. He said they were
spoons and forks, and odd plates, and a cup now and then, and such
things.</p>

<p>I set down the taffrail-log on the bit of canvas I had put under
it, and looked at the doctor. He was uneasy, and his eyes had a sort
of hunted look, and his yellow face looked grey. He wasn't trying to
make trouble. He was in trouble. So I asked him questions.</p>

<p>He said he could count as well as anybody, and do sums without
using his fingers, but that when he couldn't count any other way he
did use his fingers, and it always came out the same. He said that
when he and the cabin-boy cleared up after the men's meals there were
more things to wash than he had given out. There'd be a fork more, or
there'd be a spoon more, and sometimes there'd be a spoon and a fork,
and there was always a plate more. It wasn't that he complained of
that. Before poor Jim Benton was lost they had a man more to feed,
and his gear to wash up after meals, and that was in the contract,
the doctor said. It would have been if there were twenty in the
ship's company; but he didn't think it was right for the men to play
tricks like that. He kept his things in good order, and he counted
them, and he was responsible for them, and it wasn't right that the
men should take more things than they needed when his back was
turned, and just soil them and mix them up with their own, so as to
make him think--</p>

<p>He stopped there, and looked at me, and I looked at him. I didn't
know what he thought, but I began to guess. I wasn't going to humour
any such nonsense as that, so I told him to speak to the men himself,
and not come bothering me about such things.</p>

<p>"Count the plates and forks and spoons before them when they sit
down to table, and tell them that's all they'll get; and when they
have finished, count the things again, and if the count isn't right,
find out who did it. You know it must be one of them. You're not a
green hand; you've been going to sea ten or eleven years, and don't
want any lesson about how to behave if the boys play a trick on
you."</p>

<p>"If I could catch him," said the cook, "I'd have a knife into him
before he could say his prayers."</p>

<p>Those West India men are always talking about knives, especially
when they are badly frightened. I knew what he meant, and didn't ask
him, but went on cleaning the brass cogwheels of the patent log and
oiling the bearings with a feather. "Wouldn't it be better to wash it
out with boiling water, sir?" asked the cook, in an insinuating tone.
He knew that he had made a fool of himself, and was anxious to make
it right again.</p>

<p>I heard no more about the odd platter and gear for two or three
days, though I thought about his story a good deal. The doctor
evidently believed that Jim Benton had come back, though he didn't
quite like to say so. His story had sounded silly enough on a bright
afternoon, in fair weather, when the sun was on the water, and every
rag was drawing in the breeze, and the sea looked as pleasant and
harmless as a cat that has just eaten a canary. But when it was
toward the end of the first watch, and the waning moon had not risen
yet, and the water was like still oil, and the jibs hung down flat
and helpless like the wings of a dead bird--it wasn't the same then.
More than once I have started then, and looked round when a fish
jumped, expecting to see a face sticking up out of the water with its
eyes shut. I think we all felt something like that at the time.</p>

<p>One afternoon we were putting a fresh service on the
jib-sheet-pennant. It wasn't my watch, but I was standing by looking
on. Just then Jack Benton came up from below, and went to look for
his pipe under the anchor. His face was hard and drawn, and his eyes
were cold like steel balls. He hardly ever spoke now, but he did his
duty as usual and nobody had to complain of him, though we were all
beginning to wonder how long his grief for his dead brother was going
to last like that. I watched him as he crouched down, and ran his
hand into the hidingplace for the pipe. When he stood up, he had two
pipes in his hand.</p>

<p>Now, I remembered very well seeing him throw one of those pipes
away, early in the morning after the gale; and it came to me now, and
I didn't suppose he kept a stock of them under the anchor. I caught
sight of his face, and it was greenish white, like the foam on
shallow water, and he stood a long time looking at the two pipes. He
wasn't looking to see which was his, for I wasn't five yards from him
as he stood, and one of those pipes had been smoked that day, and was
shiny where his hand had rubbed it, and the bone mouthpiece was
chafed white where his teeth had bitten it. The other was
water-logged. It was swelled and cracking with wet, and it looked to
me as if there were a little green weed on it.</p>

<p>Jack Benton turned his head rather stealthily as I looked away,
and then he hid the thing in his trousers pocket, and went aft on the
lee side, out of sight. The men had got the sheet pennant on a
stretch to serve it, but I ducked under it and stood where I could
see what Jack did, just under the forestaysail. He couldn't see me,
and he was looking about for something. His hand shook as he picked
up a bit of half-bent iron rod, about a foot long, that had been used
for turning an eyebolt, and had been left on the mainhatch. His hand
shook as he got a piece of marline out of his pocket, and made the
water-logged pipe fast to the iron. He didn't mean it to get adrift,
either, for he took his turns carefully, and hove them taut and then
rode them, so that they couldn't slip, and made the end fast with two
half-hitches round the iron, and hitched it back on itself. Then he
tried it with his hands, and looked up and down the deck furtively,
and then quietly dropped the pipe and iron over the rail, so that I
didn't even hear the splash. If anybody was playing tricks on board,
they weren't meant for the cook.</p>

<p>I asked some questions about Jack Benton, and one of the men told
me that he was off his feed, and hardly ate anything, and swallowed
all the coffee he could lay his hands on, and had used up all his own
tobacco and had begun on what his brother had left.</p>

<p>"The doctor says it ain't so, sir," said the man, looking at me
shyly, as if he didn't expect to be believed; "the doctor says
there's as much eaten from breakfast to breakfast as there was before
Jim fell overboard, though there's a mouth less and another that eats
nothing. I says it's the cabin-boy that gets it. He's bu'sting."</p>

<p>I told him that if the cabin-boy ate more than his share, he must
work more than his share, so as to balance things. But the man
laughed queerly, and looked at me again.</p>

<p>"I only said that, sir, just like that. We all know it ain't
so."</p>

<p>"Well, how is it?"</p>

<p>"How is it?" asked the man, half-angry all at once. "I don't know
how it is, but there's a hand on board that's getting his whack along
with us as regular as the bells."</p>

<p>"Does he use tobacco?" I asked, meaning to laugh it out of him,
but as I spoke I remembered the water-logged pipe.</p>

<p>"I guess he's using his own still," the man answered, in a queer,
low voice. "Perhaps he'll take some one else's when his is all
gone."</p>

<p>It was about nine o'clock in the morning, I remember, for just
then the captain called to me to stand by the chronometer while he
took his fore observation. Captain Hackstaff wasn't one of those old
skippers who do everything themselves with a pocket watch, and keep
the key of the chronometer in their waistcoat pocket, and won't tell
the mate how far the dead reckoning is out. He was rather the other
way, and I was glad of it, for he generally let me work the sights he
took, and just ran his eye over my figures afterwards. I am bound to
say his eye was pretty good, for he would pick out a mistake in a
logarithm, or tell me that I had worked the "Equation of Time" with
the wrong sign, before it seemed to me that he could have got as far
as "half the sum, minus the altitude." He was always right, too, and
besides he knew a lot about iron ships and local deviation, and
adjusting the compass, and all that sort of thing. I don't know how
he came to be in command of a fore-and-aft schooner. He never talked
about himself, and maybe he had just been mate on one of those big
steel square-riggers, and something had put him back. Perhaps he had
been captain, and had got his ship aground, through no particular
fault of his, and had to begin over again. Sometimes he talked just
like you and me, and sometimes he would speak more like books do, or
some of those Boston people I have heard. I don't know. We have all
been shipmates now and then with men who have seen better days.
Perhaps he had been in the Navy, but what makes me think he couldn't
have been, was that he was a thorough good seaman, a regular old
wind-jammer, and understood sail, which those Navy chaps rarely do.
Why, you and I have sailed with men before the mast who had their
master's certificates in their pockets,--English Board of Trade
certificates, too,--who could work a double altitude if you would
lend them a sextant and give them a look at the chronometer, as well
as many a man who commands a big square-rigger. Navigation ain't
everything, nor seamanship, either. You've got to have it in you, if
you mean to get there.</p>

<p>I don't know how our captain heard that there was trouble forward.
The cabin-boy may have told him, or the men may have talked outside
his door when they relieved the wheel at night. Anyhow, he got wind
of it, and when he had got his sight that morning he had all hands
aft, and gave them a lecture. It was just the kind of talk you might
have expected from him. He said he hadn't any complaint to make, and
that so far as he knew everybody on board was doing his duty, and
that he was given to understand that the men got their whack, and
were satisfied. He said his ship was never a hard ship, and that he
liked quiet, and that was the reason he didn't mean to have any
nonsense, and the men might just as well understand that, too. We'd
had a great misfortune, he said, and it was nobody's fault. We had
lost a man we all liked and respected, and he felt that everybody in
the ship ought to be sorry for the man's brother, who was left
behind, and that it was rotten lubberly childishness, and unjust and
unmanly and cowardly, to be playing schoolboy tricks with forks and
spoons and pipes, and that sort of gear. He said it had got to stop
right now, and that was all, and the men might go forward. And so
they did.</p>

<p>It got worse after that, and the men watched the cook, and the
cook watched the men, as if they were trying to catch each other; but
I think everybody felt that there was something else. One evening, at
supper-time, I was on deck, and Jack came aft to relieve the wheel
while the man who was steering got his supper. He hadn't got past the
main-hatch on the lee side, when I heard a man running in slippers
that slapped on the deck, and there was a sort of a yell and I saw
the coloured cook going for Jack, with a carving-knife in his hand. I
jumped to get between them, and Jack turned round short, and put out
his hand. I was too far to reach them, and the cook jabbed out with
his knife. But the blade didn't get anywhere near Benton. The cook
seemed to be jabbing it into the air again and again, at least four
feet short of the mark. Then he dropped his right hand, and I saw the
whites of his eyes in the dusk, and he reeled up against the
pin-rail, and caught hold of a belaying-pin with his left. I had
reached him by that time, and grabbed hold of his knife-hand and the
other too, for I thought he was going to use the pin; but Jack Benton
was standing staring stupidly at him, as if he didn't understand. But
instead, the cook was holding on because he couldn't stand, and his
teeth were chattering, and he let go of the knife, and the point
stuck into the deck.</p>

<p>"He's crazy!" said Jack Benton, and that was all he said and he
went aft.</p>

<p>When he was gone, the cook began to come to, and he spoke quite
low, near my ear.</p>

<p>"There were two of them! So help me God, there were two of
them!"</p>

<p>I don't know why I didn't take him by the collar, and give him a
good shaking; but I didn't. I just picked up the knife and gave it to
him, and told him to go back to his galley, and not to make a fool of
himself. You see, he hadn't struck at Jack, but at something he
thought he saw, and I knew what it was, and I felt that same thing,
like a lump of ice sliding down my back, that I felt that night when
we were bending the trysail.</p>

<p>When the men had seen him running aft, they jumped up after him,
but they held off when they saw that I had caught him. By and by, the
man who had spoken to me before told me what had happened. He was a
stocky little chap, with a red head.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "there isn't much to tell. Jack Benton had been
eating his supper with the rest of us. He always sits at the after
corner of the table, on the port side. His brother used to sit at the
end, next him. The doctor gave him a thundering big piece of pie to
finish up with, and when he had finished he didn't stop for a smoke,
but went off quick to relieve the wheel. Just as he had gone, the
doctor came in from the galley, and when he saw Jack's empty plate he
stood stock still staring at it; and we all wondered what was the
matter, till we looked at the plate. There were two forks in it, sir,
lying side by side. Then the doctor grabbed his knife, and flew up
through the hatch like a rocket. The other fork was there all right,
Mr. Torkeldsen, for we all saw it and handled it; and we all had our
own. That's all I know."</p>

<p>I didn't feel that I wanted to laugh when he told me that story;
but I hoped the old man wouldn't hear it, for I knew he wouldn't
believe it, and no captain that ever sailed likes to have stories
like that going round about his ship. It gives her a bad name. But
that was all anybody ever saw except the cook, and he isn't the first
man who has thought he saw things without having any drink in him. I
think, if the doctor had been weak in the head as he was afterwards,
he might have done something foolish again, and there might have been
serious trouble. But he didn't. Only, two or three times I saw him
looking at Jack Benton in a queer, scared way, and once, I heard him
talking to himself.</p>

<p>"There's two of them! So help me God, there's two of them!"</p>

<p>He didn't say anything more about asking for his discharge, but I
knew well enough that if he got ashore at the next port we should
never see him again, if he had to leave his kit behind him, and his
money, too. He was scared all through, for good and all; and he
wouldn't be right again till he got another ship. It's no use to talk
to a man when he gets like that, any more than it is to send a boy to
the main truck when he has lost his nerve.</p>

<p>Jack Benton never spoke of what happened that evening. I don't
know whether he knew about the two forks, or not; or whether he
understood what the trouble was. Whatever he knew from the other men,
he was evidently living under a hard strain. He was quiet enough, and
too quiet; but his face was set, and sometimes it twitched oddly when
he was at the wheel, and he would turn his head round sharp to look
behind him. A man doesn't do that naturally, unless there's a vessel
that he thinks is creeping up on the quarter. When that happens, if
the man at the wheel takes a pride in his ship, he will almost always
keep glancing over his shoulder to see whether the other fellow is
gaining. But Jack Benton used to look round when there was nothing
there; and what is curious, the other men seemed to catch the trick
when they were steering. One day the old man turned out just as the
man at the wheel looked behind him.</p>

<p>"What are you looking at?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir," answered the man.</p>

<p>"Then keep your eye on the mizzenroyal," said the old man, as if
he were forgetting that we weren't a squarerigger.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," said the man.</p>

<p>The captain told me to go below and work up the latitude from the
dead-reckoning, and he went forward of the deckhouse and sat down to
read, as he often did. When I came up, the man at the wheel was
looking round again, and I stood beside him and just asked him
quietly what everybody was looking at, for it was getting to be a
general habit. He wouldn't say anything at first, but just answered
that it was nothing. But when he saw that I didn't seem to care, and
just stood there as if there were nothing more to be said, he
naturally began to talk.</p>

<p>He said that it wasn't that he saw anything, because there wasn't
anything to see except the spanker sheet just straining a little, and
working in the sheaves of the blocks as the schooner rose to the
short seas. There wasn't anything to be seen, but it seemed to him
that the sheet made a queer noise in the blocks. It was a new manilla
sheet; and in dry weather it did make a little noise, something
between a creak and a wheeze. I looked at it and looked at the man,
and said nothing; and presently he went on. He asked me if I didn't
notice anything peculiar about the noise. I listened awhile, and said
I didn't notice anything. Then he looked rather sheepish, but said he
didn't think it could be his own ears, because every man who steered
his trick heard the same thing now and then,--sometimes once in a
day, sometimes once in a night, sometimes it would go on a whole
hour.</p>

<p>"It sounds like sawing wood," I said, just like that.</p>

<p>"To us it sounds a good deal more like a man whistling 'NancyLee."
He started nervously as he spoke the last words. "There, sir, don't
you hear it?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>I heard nothing but the creaking of the manilla sheet. It was
getting near noon, and fine, clear weather in southern waters,--just
the sort of day and the time when you would least expect to feel
creepy. But I remembered how I had heard that same tune overhead at
night in a gale of wind a fortnight earlier, and I am not ashamed to
say that the same sensation came over me now, and I wished myself
well out of the Helen B., and aboard of any old cargo-dragger, with a
windmill on deck, and an eighty-nine-forty-eighter for captain, and a
fresh leak whenever it breezed up.</p>

<p>Little by little during the next few days life on board that
vessel came to be about as unbearable as you can imagine. It wasn't
that there was much talk, for I think the men were shy even of
speaking to each other freely about what they thought. The whole
ship's company grew silent, until one hardly ever heard a voice,
except giving an order and the answer. The men didn't sit over their
meals when their watch was below, but either turned in at once or sat
about on the forecastle smoking their pipes without saying a word. We
were all thinking of the same thing. We all felt as if there were a
hand on board, sometimes below, sometimes about decks, sometimes
aloft, sometimes on the boom end; taking his full share of what the
others got, but doing no work for it. We didn't only feel it, we knew
it. He took up no room, he cast no shadow, and we never heard his
footfall on deck; but he took his whack with the rest as regular as
the bells, and he whistled "Nancy Lee." It was like the worst sort of
dream you can imagine; and I dare say a good many of us tried to
believe it was nothing else sometimes, when we stood looking over the
weather rail in fine weather with the breeze in our faces; but if we
happened to turn round and look into each other's eyes, we knew it
was something worse than any dream could be; and we would turn away
from each other with a queer, sick feeling, wishing that we could
just for once see somebody who didn't know what we knew.</p>

<p>There's not much more to tell about the Helen B. Jackson so far as
I am concerned. We were more like a shipload of lunatics than
anything else when we ran in under Morro Castle, and anchored in
Havana. The cook had brain fever and was raving mad in his delirium;
and the rest of the men weren't far from the same state. The last
three or four days had been awful, and we had been as near to having
a mutiny on board as I ever want to be. The men didn't want to hurt
anybody; but they wanted to get away out of that ship, if they had to
swim for it; to get away from that whistling, from that dead shipmate
who had come back, and who filled the ship with his unseen self. I
know that if the old man and I hadn't kept a sharp lookout the men
would have put a boat over quietly on one of those calm nights, and
pulled away, leaving the captain and me and the mad cook to work the
schooner into harbour. We should have done it somehow, of course, for
we hadn't far to run if we could get a breeze; and once or twice I
found myself wishing that the crew were really gone, for the awful
state of fright in which they lived was beginning to work on me too.
You see I partly believed and partly didn't; but anyhow I didn't mean
to let the thing get the better of me, whatever it was. I turned
crusty, too, and kept the men at work on all sorts of jobs, and drove
them to it until they wished I was overboard, too. It wasn't that the
old man and I were trying to drive them to desert without their pay,
as I am sorry to say a good many skippers and mates do, even now.
Captain Hackstaff was as straight as a string, and I didn't mean
those poor fellows should be cheated out of a single cent; and I
didn't blame them for wanting to leave the ship, but it seemed to me
that the only chance to keep everybody sane through those last days
was to work the men till they dropped. When they were dead tired they
slept a little, and forgot the thing until they had to tumble up on
deck and face it again. That was a good many years ago. Do you
believe that I can't hear "Nancy Lee" now, without feeling cold down
my back? For I heard it too, now and then, after the man had
explained why he was always looking over his shoulder. Perhaps it was
imagination. I don't know. When I look back it seems to me that I
only remember a long fight against something I couldn't see, against
an appalling presence, against something worse than cholera or Yellow
Jack or the plague--and goodness knows the mildest of them is bad
enough when it breaks out at sea. The men got as white as chalk, and
wouldn't go about decks alone at night, no matter what I said to
them. With the cook raving in his bunk the forecastle would have been
a perfect hell, and there wasn't a spare cabin on board. There never
is on a fore-and-after. So I put him into mine, and he was more quiet
there, and at last fell into a sort of stupor as if he were going to
die. I don't know what became of him, for we put him ashore alive and
left him in the hospital.</p>

<p>The men came aft in a body, quiet enough, and asked the captain if
he wouldn't pay them off, and let them go ashore. Some men wouldn't
have done it, for they had shipped for the voyage, and had signed
articles. But the captain knew that when sailors get an idea into
their heads they're no better than children; and if he forced them to
stay aboard he wouldn't get much work out of them, and couldn't rely
on them in a difficulty. So he paid them off, and let them go. When
they had gone forward to get their kits, he asked me whether I wanted
to go too, and for a minute I had a sort of weak feeling that I might
just as well. But I didn't, and he was a good friend to me
afterwards. Perhaps he was grateful to me for sticking to him.</p>

<p>When the men went off he didn't come on deck; but it was my duty
to stand by while they left the ship. They owed me a grudge for
making them work during the last few days, and most of them dropped
into the boat without so much as a word or a look, as sailors will.
Jack Benton was the last to go over the side, and he stood still a
minute and looked at me, and his white face twitched. I thought he
wanted to say something.</p>

<p>"Take care of yourself, Jack," said I. "So long!"</p>

<p>It seemed as if he couldn't speak for two or three seconds; then
his words came thick.</p>

<p>"It wasn't my fault, Mr. Torkeldsen. I swear it wasn't my
fault!"</p>

<p>That was all; and he dropped over the side, leaving me to wonder
what he meant.</p>

<p>The captain and I stayed on board, and the ship-chandler got a
West India boy to cook for us.</p>

<p>That evening, before turning in, we were standing by the rail
having a quiet smoke, watching the lights of the city, a quarter of a
mile off, reflected in the still water. There was music of some sort
ashore, in a sailors' dance-house, I dare say; and I had no doubt
that most of the men who had left the ship were there, and already
full of jiggy-jiggy. The music played a lot of sailors' tunes that
ran into each other, and we could hear the men's voices in the chorus
now and then. One followed another, and then it was "Nancy Lee," loud
and clear, and the men singing "Yo-ho, heave-ho!"</p>

<p>"I have no ear for music," said Captain Hackstaff, "but it appears
to me that's the tune that man was whistling the night we lost the
man overboard. I don't know why it has stuck in my head, and of
course it's all nonsense; but it seems to me that I have heard it all
the rest of the trip."</p>

<p>I didn't say anything to that, but I wondered just how much the
old man had understood. Then we turned in, and I slept ten hours
without opening my eyes.</p>

<p>I stuck to the Helen B. Jackson after that as long as I could
stand a fore-and-after; but that night when we lay in Havana was the
last time I ever heard "Nancy Lee" on board of her. The spare hand
had gone ashore with the rest, and he never came back, and he took
his tune with him; but all those things are just as clear in my
memory as if they had happened yesterday. After that I was in deep
water for a year or more, and after I came home I got my certificate,
and what with having friends and having saved a little money, and
having had a small legacy from an uncle in Norway, I got the command
of a coastwise vessel, with a small share in her. I was at home three
weeks before going to sea, and Jack Benton saw my name in the local
papers, and wrote to me.</p>

<p>He said that he had left the sea, and was trying farming, and he
was going to be married, and he asked if I wouldn't come over for
that, for it wasn't more than forty minutes by train; and he and
Mamie would be proud to have me at the wedding. I remembered how I
had heard one brother ask the other whether Mamie knew. That meant,
whether she knew, he wanted to marry her, I suppose. She had taken
her time about it, for it was pretty nearly three years then since we
had lost Jim Benton overboard.</p>

<p>I had nothing particular to do while we were getting ready for
sea; nothing to prevent me from going over for a day, I mean; and I
thought I'd like to see Jack Benton, and have a look at the girl he
was going to marry. I wondered whether he had grown cheerful again,
and had got rid of that drawn look he had when he told me it wasn't
his fault. How could it have been his fault, anyhow? So I wrote to
Jack that I would come down and see him married; and when the day
came I took the train, and got there about ten o'clock in the
morning. I wish I hadn't. Jack met me at the station, and he told me
that the wedding was to be late in the afternoon, and that they
weren't going off on any silly wedding trip, he and Mamie, but were
just going to walk home from her mother's house to his cottage. That
was good enough for him, he said. I looked at him hard for a minute
after we met. When we had parted I had a sort of idea that he might
take to drink, but he hadn't. He looked very respectable and
well-to-do in his black coat and high city collar; but he was thinner
and bonier than when I had known him, and there were lines in his
face, and I thought his eyes had a queer look in them, half shifty,
half scared. He needn't have been afraid of me, for I didn't mean to
talk to his bride about the Helen B. Jackson.</p>

<p>He took me to his cottage first, and I could see that he was proud
of it. It wasn't above a cable's-length from highwater mark, but the
tide was running out, and there was already a broad stretch of hard
wet sand on the other side of the beach road. Jack's bit of land ran
back behind the cottage about a quarter of a mile, and he said that
some of the trees we saw were his. The fences were neat and well
kept, and there was a fair-sized barn a little way from the cottage,
and I saw some nice-looking cattle in the meadows; but it didn't look
to me to be much of a farm, and I thought that before long Jack would
have to leave his wife to take care of it, and go to sea again. But I
said it was a nice farm, so as to seem pleasant, and as I don't know
much about these things I dare say it was, all the same. I never saw
it but that once. Jack told me that he and his brother had been born
in the cottage, and that when their father and mother died they
leased the land to Mamie's father, but had kept the cottage to live
in when they came home from sea for a spell. It was as neat a little
place as you would care to see: the floors as clean as the decks of a
yacht, and the paint as fresh as a man-o'-war. Jack always was a good
painter. There was a nice parlour on the ground floor, and Jack had
papered it and had hung the walls with photographs of ships and
foreign ports, and with things he had brought home from his voyages:
a boomerang, a South Sea club, Japanese straw hats and a Gibraltar
fan with a bull-fight on it, and all that sort of gear. It looked to
me as if Miss Mamie had taken a hand in arranging it. There was a
bran-new polished iron Franklin stove set into the old fireplace, and
a red table-cloth from Alexandria, embroidered with those outlandish
Egyptian letters. It was all as bright and homelike as possible, and
he showed me everything, and was proud of everything, and I liked him
the better for it. But I wished that his voice would sound more
cheerful, as it did when we first sailed in the Helen B., and that
the drawn look would go out of his face for a minute. Jack showed me
everything, and took me upstairs, and it was all the same: bright and
fresh and ready for the bride. But on the upper landing there was a
door that Jack didn't open. When we came out of the bedroom I noticed
that it was ajar, and Jack shut it quickly and turned the key.</p>

<p>"That lock's no good," he said, half to himself. "The door is
always open."</p>

<p>I didn't pay much attention to what he said, but as we went down
the short stairs, freshly painted and varnished so that I was almost
afraid to step on them, he spoke again.</p>

<p>"That was his room, sir. I have made a sort of store-room of
it."</p>

<p>"You may be wanting it in a year or so," I said, wishing to be
pleasant.</p>

<p>"I guess we won't use his room for that," Jack answered in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Then he offered me a cigar from a fresh box in the parlour, and he
took one, and we lit them, and went out; and as we opened the front
door there was Mamie Brewster standing in the path as if she were
waiting for us. She was a fine-looking girl, and I didn't wonder that
Jack had been willing to wait three years for her. I could see that
she hadn't been brought up on steam-heat and cold storage, but had
grown into a woman by the sea-shore. She had brown eyes, and fine
brown hair, and a good figure.</p>

<p>"This is Captain Torkeldsen," said Jack. "This is Miss Brewster,
captain; and she is glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Well, I am," said Miss Mamie, "for Jack has often talked to us
about you, captain."</p>

<p>She put out her hand, and took mine and shook it heartily, and I
suppose I said something, but I know I didn't say much.</p>

<p>The front door of the cottage looked toward the sea, and there was
a straight path leading to the gate on the beach road. There was
another path from the steps of the cottage that turned to the right,
broad enough for two people to walk easily, and it led straight
across the fields through gates to a larger house about a quarter of
a mile away. That was where Mamie's mother lived, and the wedding was
to be there. Jack asked me whether I would like to look round the
farm before dinner, but I told him I didn't know much about farms.
Then he said he just wanted to look round himself a bit, as he
mightn't have much more chance that day; and he smiled, and Mamie
laughed.</p>

<p>"Show the captain the way to the house, Mamie," he said. "I'll be
along in a minute."</p>

<p>So Mamie and I began to walk along the path, and Jack went up
toward the barn.</p>

<p>"It was sweet of you to come, captain," Miss Mamie began, "for I
have always wanted to see you."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, expecting something more.</p>

<p>"You see, I always knew them both," she went on. "They used to
take me out in a dory to catch codfish when I was a little girl, and
I liked them both," she added thoughtfully. "Jack doesn't care to
talk about his brother now. That's natural. But you won't mind
telling me how it happened, will you? I should so much like to
know."</p>

<p>Well, I told her about the voyage and what happened that night
when we fell in with a gale of wind, and that it hadn't been
anybody's fault, for I wasn't going to admit that it was my old
captain's, if it was. But I didn't tell her anything about what
happened afterwards. As she didn't speak, I just went on talking
about the two brothers, and how like they had been, and how when poor
Jim was drowned and Jack was left, I took Jack for him. I told her
that none of us had ever been sure which was which.</p>

<p>"I wasn't always sure myself," she said, "unless they were
together. Leastways, not for a day or two after they came home from
sea. And now it seems to me that Jack is more like poor Jim, as I
remember him, than he ever was, for Jim was always more quiet, as if
he were thinking."</p>

<p>I told her I thought so, too. We passed the gate and went into the
next field, walking side by side. Then she turned her head to look
for Jack, but he wasn't in sight. I sha'n't forget what she said
next.</p>

<p>"Are you sure now?" she asked.</p>

<p>I stood stock-still, and she went on a step, and then turned and
looked at me. We must have looked at each other while you could count
five or six.</p>

<p>"I know it's silly," she went on, "it's silly, and it's awful,
too, and I have got no right to think it, but sometimes I can't help
it. You see it was always Jack I meant to marry."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said stupidly, "I suppose so."</p>

<p>She waited a minute, and began walking on slowly before she went
on again.</p>

<p>"I am talking to you as if you were an old friend, captain, and I
have only known you five minutes. It was Jack I meant to marry, but
now he is so like the other one."</p>

<p>When a woman gets a wrong idea into her head, there is only one
way to make her tired of it, and that is to agree with her. That's
what I did, and she went or, talking the same way for a little while,
and I kept on agreeing and agreeing until she turned round on me.</p>

<p>"You know you don't believe what you say," she said, and laughed.
"You know that Jack is Jack, right enough; and it's Jack I am going
to marry."</p>

<p>"Of course I said so, for I didn't care whether she thought me a
weak creature or not. I wasn't going to say a word that could
interfere with her happiness, and I didn't intend to go back on Jack
Benton; but I remembered what he had said when he left the ship in
Havana: that it wasn't his fault.</p>

<p>"All the same," Miss Mamie went on, as a woman will, without
realising what she was saying, "all the same, I wish I had seen it
happen. Then I should know."</p>

<p>Next minute she knew that she didn't mean that, and was afraid
that I would think her heartless, and began to explain that she would
really rather have died herself than have seen poor Jim go overboard.
Women haven't got much sense, anyhow. All the same, I wondered how
she could marry Jack if she had a doubt that he might be Jim after
all. I suppose she had really got used to him since he had given up
the sea and had stayed ashore, and she cared for him.</p>

<p>Before long we heard Jack coming up behind us, for we had walked
very slowly to wait for him.</p>

<p>"Promise not to tell anybody what I said, captain," said Mamie, as
girls do as soon as they have told their secrets.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I know I never did tell any one but you. This is the first
time I have talked of all that, the first time since I took the train
from that place. I am not going to tell you all about the day. Miss
Mamie introduced me to her mother, who was a quiet, hard-f aced old
New England farmer's widow, and to her cousins and relations; and
there were plenty of them too at dinner, and there was the parson
besides. He was what they call a Hard-shell Baptist in those parts,
with a long, shaven upper lip and a whacking appetite, and a sort of
superior look, as if he didn't expect to see many of us
hereafter--the way a New York pilot looks round, and orders things
about when he boards an Italian cargo-dragger, as if the ship weren't
up to much anyway, though it was his business to see that she didn't
get aground. That's the way a good many parsons look, I think. He
said grace as if he were ordering the men to sheet home the
topgallant-sail and get the helm up. After dinner we went out on the
piazza, for it was warm autumn weather; and the young folks went off
in pairs along the beach road, and the tide had turned and was
beginning to come in. The morning had been clear and fine, but by
four o'clock it began to look like a fog, and the damp came up out of
the sea and settled on everything. Jack said he'd go down to his
cottage and have a last look, for the wedding was to be at five
o'clock, or soon after, and he wanted to light the lights, so as to
have things look cheerful.</p>

<p>"I will just take a last look," he said again, as we reached the
house. We went in, and he offered me another cigar, and I lit it and
sat down in the parlour. I could hear him moving about, first in the
kitchen and then upstairs, and then I heard him in the kitchen again;
and then before I knew anything I heard somebody moving upstairs
again. I knew he couldn't have got up those stairs as quick as that.
He came into the parlour, and he took a cigar himself, and while he
was lighting it I heard those steps again overhead. His hand shook,
and he dropped the match.</p>

<p>"Have you got in somebody to help?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," Jack answered sharply, and struck another match.</p>

<p>"There's somebody upstairs, Jack," I said. "Don't you hear
footsteps?"</p>

<p>"It's the wind, captain," Jack answered; but I could see he was
trembling.</p>

<p>"That isn't any wind, Jack," I said; "it's still and foggy. I'm
sure there's somebody upstairs."</p>

<p>"If you are so sure of it, you'd better go and see for yourself,
captain," Jack answered, almost angrily.</p>

<p>He was angry because he was frightened. I left him before the
fireplace, and went upstairs. There was no power on earth that could
make me believe I hadn't heard a man's footsteps over--head. I knew
there was somebody there. But there wasn't. I went into the bedroom,
and it was all quiet, and the evening light was streaming in, reddish
through the foggy air; and I went out on the landing and looked in
the little back room that was meant for a servant girl or a child.
And as I came back again I saw that the door of the other room was
wide open, though I knew Jack had locked it. He had said the lock was
no good. I looked in. It was a room as big as the bedroom, but almost
dark, for it had shutters, and they were closed. There was a musty
smell, as of old gear, and I could make out that the floor was
littered with sea chests, and that there were oilskins and such stuff
piled on the bed. But I still believed that there was somebody
upstairs, and I went in and struck a match and looked round. I could
see the four walls and the shabby old paper, an iron bed and a
cracked looking-glass, and the stuff on the floor. But there was
nobody there. So I put out the match, and came out and shut the door
and turned the key. Now, what I am telling you is the truth. When I
had turned the key, I heard footsteps walking away from the door
inside the room. Then I felt queer for a minute, and when I went
downstairs I looked behind me, as the men at the wheel used to look
behind them on board the Helen B.</p>

<p>Jack was already outside on the steps, smoking. I have an idea
that he didn't like to stay inside alone.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked, trying to seem careless.</p>

<p>"I didn't find anybody," I answered, "but I heard somebody moving
about."</p>

<p>"I told you it was the wind," said Jack, contemptuously. "I ought
to know, for I live here, and I hear it often."</p>

<p>There was nothing to be said to that, so we began to walk down
toward the beach. Jack said there wasn't any hurry, as it would take
Miss Mamie some time to dress for the wedding. So we strolled along,
and the sun was setting through the fog, and the tide was coming in.
I knew the moon was full, and that when she rose the fog would roll
away from the land, as it does sometimes. I felt that Jack didn't
like my having heard that noise, so I talked of other things, and
asked him about his prospects, and before long we were chatting as
pleasantly as possible. I haven't been at many weddings in my life,
and I don't suppose you have, but that one seemed to me to be all
right until it was pretty near over; and then, I don't know whether
it was part of the ceremony or not, but Jack put out his hand and
took Mamie's and held it a minute, and looked at her, while the
parson was still speaking.</p>

<p>Mamie turned as white as a sheet and screamed. It wasn't a loud
scream, but just a sort of stifled little shriek, as if she were half
frightened to death; and the parson stopped, and asked her what was
the matter, and the family gathered round.</p>

<p>"Your hand's like ice," said Mamie to Jack, "and it's all
wet!"</p>

<p>She kept looking at it, as she got hold of herself again.</p>

<p>"It don't feel cold to me," said Jack, and he held the back of his
hand against his cheek. "Try it again."</p>

<p>Mamie held out hers, and touched the back of his hand, timidly at
first, and then took hold of it.</p>

<p>"Why, that's funny," she said.</p>

<p>"She's been as nervous as a witch all day," said Mrs. Brewster,
severely.</p>

<p>"It is natural," said the parson, "that young Mrs. Benton should
experience a little agitation at such a moment."</p>

<p>Most of the bride's relations lived at a distance, and were busy
people, so it had been arranged that the dinner we'd had in the
middle of the day was to take the place of a dinner afterwards, and
that we should just have a bite after the wedding was over, and then
that everybody should go home, and the young couple would walk down
to the cottage by themselves. When I looked out I could see the light
burning brightly in Jack's cottage, a quarter of a mile away. I said
I didn't think I could get any train to take me back before half-past
nine, but Mrs. Brewster begged me to stay until it was time, as she
said her daughter would want to take off her wedding dress before she
went home; for she had put on something white with a wreath, that was
very pretty, and she couldn't walk home like that, could she?</p>

<p>So when we had all had a little supper the party began to break
up, and when they were all gone Mrs. Brewster and Mamie went
upstairs, and Jack and I went out on the piazza to have a smoke, as
the old lady didn't like tobacco in the house.</p>

<p>The full moon had risen now, and it was behind me as I looked down
toward Jack's cottage, so that everything was clear and white, and
there was only the light burning in the window. The fog had rolled
down to the water's edge, and a little beyond, for the tide was high,
or nearly, and was lapping up over the last reach of sand, within
fifty feet of the beach road.</p>

<p>Jack didn't say much as we sat smoking, but he thanked me for
coming to his wedding, and I told him I hoped he would be happy; and
so I did. I dare say both of us were thinking of those footsteps
upstairs, just then, and that the house wouldn't seem so lonely with
a woman in it. By and by we heard Mamie's voice talking to her mother
on the stairs, and in a minute she was ready to go. She had put on
again the dress she had worn in the morning, and it looked black at
night, almost as black as Jack's coat.</p>

<p>Well, they were ready to go now. It was all very quiet after the
day's excitement, and I knew they would like to walk down that path
alone now that they were man and wife at last. I bade them
good-night, although Jack made a show of pressing me to go with them
by the path as far as the cottage, instead of going to the station by
the beach road. It was all very quiet, and it seemed to me a sensible
way of getting married; and when Mamie kissed her mother good-night I
just looked the other way, and knocked my ashes over the rail of the
piazza. So they started down the straight path to Jack's cottage, and
I waited a minute with Mrs. Brewster, looking after them, before
taking my hat to go. They walked side by side, a little shyly at
first, and then I saw Jack put his arm round her waist. As I looked
he was on her left, and I saw the outline of the two figures very
distinctly against the moonlight on the path; and the shadow on
Mamie's right was broad and black as ink, and it moved along,
lengthening and shortening with the unevenness of the ground beside
the path.</p>

<p>I thanked Mrs. Brewster, and bade her good-night; and though she
was a hard New England woman her voice trembled a little as she
answered, but being a sensible person she went in and shut the door
behind her as I stepped out on the path. I looked after the couple in
the distance a last time, meaning to go down to the road, so as not
to overtake them; but when I had made a few steps I stopped and
looked again, for I knew I had seen something queer, though I had
only realised it afterwards. I looked again, and it was plain enough
now; and I stood stock-still, staring at what I saw. Mamie was
walking between two men. The second man was just the same height as
Jack, both being about a half ahead taller than she; Jack on her left
in his black tail-coat and round hat, and the other man on her
right--well, he was a sailor-man in wet oilskins. I could see the
moonlight shining on the water that ran down him, and on the little
puddle that had settled where the flap of his sou'wester was turned
up behind: and one of his wet, shiny arms was round Mamie's waist,
just above Jack's. I was fast to the spot where I stood, and for a
minute I thought I was crazy. We'd had nothing but some cider for
dinner, and tea in the evening, otherwise I'd have thought something
had got into my head, though I was never drunk in my life. It was
more like a bad dream after that.</p>

<p>I was glad Mrs. Brewster had gone in. As for me, I couldn't help
following the three, in a sort of wonder to see what would happen, to
see whether the sailorman in his wet togs would just melt away into
the moonshine. But he didn't.</p>

<p>I moved slowly, and I remembered afterwards that I walked on the
grass, instead of on the path, as if I were afraid they might hear me
coming. I suppose it all happened in less than five minutes after
that, but it seemed as if it must have taken an hour. Neither Jack
nor Mamie seemed to notice the sailor. She didn't seem to know that
his wet arm was round her, and little by little they got near the
cottage, and I wasn't a hundred yards from them when they reached the
door. Something made me stand still then. Perhaps it was fright, for
I saw everything that happened just as I see you now.</p>

<p>Mamie set her foot on the step to go up, and as she went forward I
saw the sailor slowly lock his arm in Jack's, and Jack didn't move to
go up. Then Mamie turned round on the step, and they all three stood
that way for a second or two. She cried out then,--I heard a man cry
like that once, when his arm was taken off by a steam-crane,--and she
fell back in a heap on the little piazza.</p>

<p>I tried to jump forward, but I couldn't move, and I felt my hair
rising under my hat. The sailor turned slowly where he stood, and
swung Jack round by the arm steadily and easily, and began to walk
him down the pathway from the house. He walked him straight down that
path, as steadily as Fate; and all the time I saw the moonlight
shining on his wet oilskins. He walked him through the gate, and
across the beach road, and out upon the wet sand, where the tide was
high. Then I got my breath with a gulp, and ran for them across the
grass, and vaulted over the fence, and stumbled across the road. But
when I felt the sand under my feet, the two were at the water's edge;
and when I reached the water they were far out, and up to their
waists; and I saw that Jack Benton's head had fallen forward on his
breast, and his free arm hung limp beside him, while his dead brother
steadily marched him to his death. The moonlight was on the dark
water, but the fog-bank was white beyond, and I saw them against it;
and they went slowly and steadily down. The water was up to their
armpits, and then up to their shoulders, and then I saw it rise up to
the black rim of Jack's hat. But they never wavered; and the two
heads went straight on, straight on, till they were under, and there
was just a ripple in the moonlight where Jack had been.</p>

<p>It has been on my mind to tell you that story, whenever I got a
chance. You have known me, man and boy, a good many years; and I
thought I would like to hear your opinion. Yes, that's what I always
thought. It wasn't Jim that went overboard; it was Jack, and Jim just
let him go when he might have saved him; and then Jim passed himself
off for Jack with us, and with the girl. If that's what happened, he
got what he deserved. People said the next day that Mamie found it
out as they reached the house, and that her husband just walked out
into the sea, and drowned himself; and they would have blamed me for
not stopping him if they'd known that I was there. But I never told
what I had seen, for they wouldn't have believed me. I just let them
think I had come too late.</p>

<p>When I reached the cottage and lifted Mamie up, she was raving
mad. She got better afterwards, but she was never right in her head
again.</p>

<p>Oh, you want to know if they found Jack's body? I don't know
whether it was his, but I read in a paper at a Southern port where I
was with my new ship that two dead bodies had come ashore in a gale
down East, in pretty bad shape. They were locked together, and one
was a skeleton in oilskins.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4"></a>For the Blood is the Life</h2>

<p>We had dined at sunset on the broad roof of the old tower, because
it was cooler there during the great heat of summer. Besides, the
little kitchen was built at one corner of the great square platform,
which made it more convenient than if the dishes had to be carried
down the steep stone steps broken in places and everywhere worn with
age. The tower was one of those built all down the west coast of
Calabria by the Emperor Charles V early in the sixteenth century, to
keep off the Barbary pirates, when the unbelievers were allied with
Francis I against the Emperor and the Church. They have gone to ruin,
a few still stand intact, and mine is one of the largest. How it came
into my possession ten years ago, and why I spend a part of each year
in it, are matters which do not concern this tale. The tower stands
in one of the loneliest spots in Southern Italy, at the extremity of
a curving, rocky promontory, which forms a small but safe natural
harbour at the southern extremity of the Gulf of Policastro, and just
north of Cape Scalea, the birthplace of Judas Iscariot, according to
the old local legend. The tower stands alone on this hooked spur of
the rock, and there is not a house to be seen within three miles of
it. When I go there I take a couple of sailors, one of whom is a fair
cook, and when I am away it is in charge of a gnome-like little being
who was once a miner and who attached himself to me long ago.</p>

<p>My friend, who sometimes visits me in my summer solitude, is an
artist by profession, a Scandinavian by birth, and a cosmopolitan by
force of circumstances.</p>

<p>We had dined at sunset; the sunset glow had reddened and faded
again, and the evening purple steeped the vast chain of the mountains
that embrace the deep gulf to eastward and rear themselves higher and
higher towards the south. It was hot, and we sat at the landward
corner of the platform, waiting for the night breeze to come down
from the lower hills. The colour sank out of the air, there was a
little interval of deep-grey twilight, and a lamp sent a yellow
streak from the open door of the kitchen, where the men were getting
their supper.</p>

<p>Then the moon rose suddenly above the crest of the promontory,
flooding the platform and lighting up every little spur of rock and
knoll of grass below us, down to the edge of the motionless water. My
friend lighted his pipe and sat looking at a spot on the hillside. I
knew that he was looking at it, and for a long time past I had
wondered whether he would ever see anything there that would fix his
attention. I knew that spot well. It was clear that he was interested
at last, though it was a long time before he spoke. Like most
painters, he trusts to his own eyesight, as a lion trusts his
strength and a stag his speed, and he is always disturbed when he
cannot reconcile what he sees with what he believes that he ought to
see.</p>

<p>"It's strange," he said. "Do you see that little mound just on
this side of the boulder?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, and I guessed what was coming.</p>

<p>"It looks like a grave," observed Holger.</p>

<p>"Very true. It does look like a grave."</p>

<p>"Yes," continued my friend, his eyes still fixed on the spot. "But
the strange thing is that I see the body lying on the top of it. Of
course," continued Holger, turning his head on one side as artists
do, "it must be an effect of light. In the first place, it is not a
grave at all. Secondly, if it were, the body would be inside and not
outside. Therefor, it's an effect of the moonlight. Don't you see
it?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly; I always see it on moonlight nights."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem it interest you much," said Holger.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it does interest me, though I am used to it.
You're not so far wrong, either. The mound is really a grave."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Holger incredulously. "I suppose you'll tell me
that what I see lying on it is really a corpse!"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, "it's not. I know, because I have taken the
trouble to go down and see."</p>

<p>"Then what is it?" asked Holger.</p>

<p>"It's nothing."</p>

<p>"You mean that it's an effect of light, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is. But the inexplicable part of the matter is that it
makes no difference whether the moon is rising or setting, or waxing
or waning. If there's any moonlight at all, from east or west or
overhead, so long as it shines on the grave you can see the outline
of the body on top."</p>

<p>Holger stirred up his pipe with the point of his knife, and then
used his finger for a stopper. When the tobacco burned well, he rose
from his chair.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," he said, "I'll go down and take a look at
it."</p>

<p>He left me, crossed the roof, and disappeared down the dark steps.
I did not move, but sat looking down until he came out of the tower
below. I heard him humming an old Danish song as he crossed the open
space in the bright moonlight, going straight to the mysterious
mound. When he was ten paces from it, Holger stopped short, made two
steps forward, and then three or four backward, and then stopped
again. I know what that meant. He had reached the spot where the
Thing ceased to be visible--where, as he would have said, the effect
of light changed.</p>

<p>Then he went on till he reached the mound and stood upon it. I
could see the Thing still, but it was no longer lying down; it was on
its knees now, winding its white arms round Holger's body and looking
up into his face. A cool breeze stirred my hair at that moment, as
the night wind began to come down from the hills, but it felt like a
breath from another world.</p>

<p>The Thing seemed to be trying to climb to its feet helping itself
up by Holger's body while he stood upright, quite unconcious of it
and apparently looking toward the tower, which is very picturesque
when the moonlight falls upon it on that side.</p>

<p>"Come along!" I shouted. "Don't stay there all night!"</p>

<p>It seemed to me that he moved reluctantly as he stepped from the
mound, or else with difficulty. That was it. The Thing's arms were
still round his waist, but its feet could not leave the grave. As he
came slowly forward it was drawn and lengthened like a wreath of
mist, thin and white, till I saw distinctly that Holger shook
himself, as a man does who feels a chill. At the same instant a
little wail of pain came to me on the breeze--it might have been the
cry of the small owl that lives amongst the rocks--and the misty
presence floated swiftly back from Holger's advancing figure and lay
once more at its length upon the mound.</p>

<p>Again I felt the cool breeze in my hair, and this time an icy
thrill of dread ran down my spine. I remembered very well that I had
once gone down there alone in the moonlight; that presently, being
near, I had seen nothing; that, like Holger, I had gone and had stood
upon the mound; and I remembered how when I came back, sure that
there was nothing there, I had felt the sudden conviction that there
was something after all if I would only look back, a temptation I had
resisted as unworthy of a man of sense, until, to get rid of it, I
had shaken myself just as Holger did.</p>

<p>And now I knew that those white, misty arms had been round me,
too; I knew it in a flash, and I shuddered as I remembered that I had
heard the night owl then, too. But it had not been the night owl. It
was the cry of the Thing.</p>

<p>I refilled my pipe and poured out a cup of strong southern wine;
in less than a minute Holger was seated beside me again.</p>

<p>"Of course there's nothing there," he said, "but it's creepy, all
the same. Do you know, when I was coming back I was so sure that
there was something behind me that I wanted to turn around and look?
It was an effort not to."</p>

<p>He laughed a little, knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and poured
himself out some wine. For a while neither of us spoke, and the moon
rose higher and we both looked at the Thing that lay on the
mound.</p>

<p>"You might make a story about that," said Holger after a long
time.</p>

<p>"There is one," I answered. "If you're not sleepy, I'll tell it to
you."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Holger, who likes stories.</p>

<p>Old Aderio was dying up there in the village beyond the hill. You
remember him, I have no doubt. They say that he made his money by
selling sham jewelry in South America, and escaped with his gains
when he was found out.. Like all those fellows, if they bring
anything back with them, he at once set to work to enlarge his house,
and as there are no masons here, he sent all the way to Paola for two
workmen. They were a rough-looking pair of scoundrels--a Neapolitan
who had lost one eye and a Sicilian with an old scar half an inch
deep across his left cheek. I often saw them, for on Sundays they
used to come down here and fish off the rocks. When Alario caught the
fever that killed him the masons were still at work. As he had agreed
that part of their pay should be their board and lodging, he made
them sleep in the house. His wife was dead, and he had an only son
called Angelo, who was a much better sort than himself. Angelo was to
marry the daughter of the richest man in the village, and, strange to
say, though the marriage was arranged by their parents, the young
people were said to be in love with eachother.</p>

<p>For that matter, the whole village was in love with Angelo, and
among the rest a wild, good-looking creature called Cristina, who was
more like a gipsy than any girl I ever saw about here. She had very
red lips and very black eyes, she was built like a greyhound, and had
the tongue of the devil. But Angelo did not care a straw for her. He
was rather a simpleminded fellow, quite different from his old
scoundrel of a father, and under what I should call normal
circumstances I really believe that he would never have looked at any
girl except the nice plump little creature, with a fat dowry, whom
his father meant him to marry. But things turned up which were
neither normal nor natural.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a very handsome young shepherd from the hills
above Maratea was in love with Cristina, who seems to have been quite
indifferent to him. Cristina had no regular means of subsistence, but
she was a good girl and willing to do any work or go on errands to
any distance for the sake of a loaf of bread or a mess of beans, and
permission to sleep under cover. She was especially glad when she
could get something to do about the house of Angelo's father. There
is no doctor in the village, and when the neighbours saw that old
Alario was dying they sent Cristina to Scalea to fetch one. That was
late in the afternoon, and if they had waited so long it was because
the dying miser refused to allow any such extravagance while he was
able to speak. But while Cristina was gone matters grew rapidly
worse, the priest was brough tothe bedside, and when he had done what
he could he gave it as his opinion to the bystanders that the old man
was dead, and left the house.</p>

<p>You know these people. They have a physical horror of death. Until
the priest spoke, the room had been full of people. The words were
hardly out of his mouth before it was empty. It was night now. They
hurried down the dark steps and out into the street.</p>

<p>Angelo, as I have said, was away, Cristina had not come back--the
simple woman-servant who had nursed the sick man fled with the rest,
and the body was left alone in the flickering light of the earthen
oil lamp.</p>

<p>Five minutes later two men looked in cautiously and crept forward
toward the bed. They were the one-eyed Neapolitan mason and his
Sicilian companion. They knew what they wanted. In a moment they had
dragged from under the bed a small but heavy iron-bound box, and long
before anyone thought of coming back to the dead man they had left
the house and the village under cover of darkness. It was easy
enough, for Alario's house is the last toward the gorge which leads
down here, and the thieves merely went out by the back door, got over
the stone wall, and had nothing to risk after that except that
possibility of meeting some belated countryman, which was very small
indeed, since few of the people use that path. They had a mattock and
shovel, and they made their way without accident.</p>

<p>I am telling you this story as it must have happened, for, of
course, there were no witnesses to this part of it. The men brought
the box down by the gorge, intending to bury it on the beach in the
wet sand, where it would have been much safer. But the paper would
have rotted if they had been obliged to leave it there long, so they
dug their hole down there, close to that boulder. Yes, just where the
mound is now.</p>

<p>Cristina did not find the doctor in Scalea, for he had been sent
for from a place up the valley, half-way to San Domenico. If she had
found him we would have come on his mule by the upper road, which is
smoother but much longer. But Cristina took the short cut by the
rocks, which passes about fifty feet above the mound, and goes round
that corner. The men were digging when she passed, and she heard them
at work. It would not hav been like her to go by without finding out
what the noise was, for she was never afraid of anything in her life,
and, besides, the fishermen sometimes come ashore here at night to
get a stone for an anchor or to gather sticks to make a little fire.
The night was dark and Cristina probably came close to the two men
before she could see what they were doing. She knew them, of course,
and they knew her, and understood instantly that they were in her
power. There was only one thing to be done for their safety, and they
did it. They knocked her on the head, they dug the hole deep, and
they buried her quickly with the iron-bound chest. They must have
understood that their only chance of escaping suspicion lay in
getting back to the village before their absence was noticed, for
they returned immediately, and were found half and hour later
gossiping quietly with the man who was making Alario's coffin. He was
a crony of theirs, and had been working at the repairs in the old
man's house. So far as I have been able to make out, the only persons
who were supposed to know where Alario kept his treasure were Angelo
and the one woman-servant I have mentioned. Angelo was away; it was
the woman who discovered the theft.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to understand why no one else knew where the
money was. The old man kept his door locked and the key in his pocket
when he was out, and did not let the woman enter to clean the place
unless he was there himself. The whole village knew that he had money
somewhere, however, and the masons had probably discovered the
whereabouts of the chest by climbing in at the window in his absence.
If the old man had not been delirious until he lost conciousness he
would have been in frightful agony of mind for his riches. The
faithful woman-servant forgot their existence only for a few moments
when she fled with the rest, overcome by the horror of death. Twenty
minutes had not passed before she returned with the two hideous old
hags who are always called in to prepare the dead for burial. Even
then she had not at first the courage to go near the bed with them,
but she made a pretence of dropping something, went down on her knees
as if to find it, and looked under the bedstead. The walls of the
room were newly whitewashed down to the floor and she saw at a glance
that the chest was gone. It had been there in the afternoon, it had
therefore been stolen in the short interval since she had left the
room.</p>

<p>There are no carabineers stationed in the village; there is not so
much as a municipal watchman, for there is no municipality. There
never was such a place, I believe. Scalea is supposed to look after
it in some mysterious way, and it takes a couple of hours to get
anybody from there. As the old woman had lived in the village all her
life, it did not even occur to her to apply to any civil authority
for help. She simply set up a howl and ran through the village in the
dark, screaming out that her dead master's house had been robbed.
Many of the people looked out, but at first no one seemed inclined to
help her. Most of them, judging her by themselves, whispered to each
other that she had probably stolen the money herself. The first man
to move was the father of the girl whom Angelo was to marry; having
collected his household, all of whom felt a personal interest in the
wealth which was to have come into the family, he declared it to be
his opinion that the chest had been stolen by the two journeymen
masons who lodged in the house. He headed a search for them, which
naturally began in Alario's house and ended in the carpenter's
workshop, where the thieves were found discussing a measure of wine
with the carpenter over the half-finished coffin, by the light of one
earthen lamp filled with oil and tallow. The search-party at once
accused the delinquents of the crime, and threatened to lock them up
in the cellar till the carabineers could be fetched from Scalea. The
two men looked at each other for one moment, and then without the
slightest hesitation they put out the single light, seized the
unfinished coffin between them, and using it as a sort of battering
ram, dashed upon their assailants in the dark. In a few moments they
were beyond pursuit.</p>

<p>That is the end of the first part of the story. The tresure had
disappeared, and as no trace of it could be found the people supposed
that the thieves had succeeded in carrying it off. The old man was
buried, and when Angelo came back at last he had to borrow money to
pay for the miserable funeral, and had some difficulty in doing so.
He hardly needed to be told that in losing his inheritance he had
lost his bride. In this part of the world marriages are made on
strictly business principles, and if the promised cash is not
forthcoming on the appointed day, the bride or the bridegroom whose
parents have failed to produce it may as well take themselves off,
for there will be no wedding. Poor Angelo knew that well enough. His
father had been possessed of hardly any land, and now that the hard
cash which he had brought from South America was gone, there was
nothing left but debts for the building materials that were to have
been used for enlarging and improving the old house. Angelo was
beggared, and the nice plump little creature who was to have been
his, turned up her nose at him in the most approved fashion. As for
Cristina, it was several days before she was missed, for no one
remembered that she had been sent to Scalea for the doctor, who had
never come. She often disappeared in the same way for days together,
when she could find a little work here and there at the distant farms
among the hills. But when she did not come back at all, people began
to wonder, and at last made up their minds that she had connived with
the masons and had escaped with them.</p>

<p>I paused and emptied my glass.</p>

<p>"That sort of thing could not happen anywhere else," observed
Holger, filling his everlasting pipe again. "It is wonderful what a
natural charm there is about murder and sudden death in a romantic
country like this. Deeds that would be simply brutal and disgusting
anywhere else become dramatic and mysterious because this is Italy,
and we are living in a genuine tower of Charles V built against
Barbary pirates."</p>

<p>"There's something in that," I admitted. Holger is the most
romantic man in the world inside of himself, but he always thinks it
necessary to explain why he feels anything.</p>

<p>"I suppose the found the poor girl's body with the box," he said
presently.</p>

<p>"As it seems to interest you," I answered, "I'll tell you the rest
of the story."</p>

<p>The mood had risen by this time; the outline of the Thing on the
mound was clearer to our eyes than before.</p>

<p>The village very soon settled down to its small dull life. No one
missed old Alario, who had been away so much on his voyages to South
America that he had never been a familiar figure in his native place.
Angelo lived in the half-finished house, and because he had no money
to pay the old woman-servant, she would not stay with him, but once
in a long time she would come and wash a shirt for him for old
acquaintance' sake. Besides the house, he had inherited a small patch
of ground at some distance from the village; he tried to cultivate
it, but he had no heart in the work, for he knew he could neer pay
the taxes on it and on the house, which would certainly be
confiscated by the Government, or seized for the debt of the building
material, which the man who had supplied it refused to take back.</p>

<p>Angelo was very unhappy. So long as his father had been alive and
rich, every girl in the village had been in love with him; but that
was all changed now. It had been pleasant to be admired and courted,
and invited to drink wine by fathers who had girls to marry. It was
hard to be stared at coldly, and sometimes laughed at because he had
been robbed of his inheritance. He cooked his miserable meals for
himself, and from being sad became melancholy and morose.</p>

<p>At twilight, when the day's work was done, instead of hanging
about in the open space before the church with young fellows of his
own age, he took to wandering in lonely places on the outskirts of
the village till it was quite dark. Then he slunk home and went to
bed to save the expense of a light. But in those lonely twilight
hours he began to have strange waking dreams. He was not always
alone, for often when he sat on the stump of a tree, where the narrow
path turns down the gorge, he was sure that a woman came up
noiselessly over the rough stones, as if her feet were bare; and she
stood under a clump of chestnut trees only half a dozen yards down
the path, and beckoned to him without speaking. Though she was in the
shadow he knew that her lips were red, and that when they parted a
little and smiled at him she showed two small sharp teeth. He knew
this at first rather than saw it, and he knew that it was Cristina,
and that she was dead. Yet he was not afraid; he only wondered
whether it was a dream, for he thought that if he had been awake he
should have been frightened.</p>

<p>Besides, the dead woman had red lips, and that could only happen
in a dream. Whenever he went near the gorget after sunset she was
already there waiting for him, or else she very soon appeared, and he
began to be sure of her blood-red mouth, but now each feature grew
distinct, and the pale face looked at him with deep and hungry
eyes.</p>

<p>It was the eyes that grew dim. Little by little he came to know
that someday the dream would not end when he turned away to go home,
but would lead him down the gorge out of which the vision rose. She
was nearer now when she beckoned to him. Her cheeks were not livid
like those of the dead, but pale with starvation, with the furious
and unappeased physical hunger of her eyes that devoured him. They
feasted on his soul and cast a spell over him, and at last they were
close to his own and held him. He could not tell whether her breath
was as hot as fire, or as cold as ice; he could not tell whether her
red lips burned his or froze them, or whether her five fingers on his
wrists seared scorching scars or bit his flesh like frost; he could
not tell whether he was awake or asleep, whether she was alive or
dead, but he knew that she loved him, she alone of all creatures,
earthly or unearthly, and her spell had power over him.</p>

<p>When the moon rose high that night the shadow of that Thing was
not alone down there upon the mound.</p>

<p>Angelo awoke in the cool dawn, drenched with dew and chilled
through flesh, and blood, and bone. He opened his eyes to the faint
grey light, and saw the stars were still shining overhead. He was
very weak, and his heart was beating so slowly that he was almost
like a man fainting. Slowly he turned his head on the mound, as on a
pillow, but the other face was not there. Fear seized him suddenly, a
fear unspeakable and unknown; he sprang to his feet and fled up the
gorge, and he never looked behind him until he reached the door of
the house on the outskirts of the village. Drearily he went to his
work that day, and wearily the hours dragged themselves after the
sun, till at last it touched the sea and sank, and the great sharp
hills above Maratea turned purple against the dove-coloured eastern
sky.</p>

<p>Angelo shouldered his heavy hoe and left the field. He felt less
tired now than in the morning when he had begun to work, but he
promised himself that he would go home without lingering by the
gorge, and eat the best supper he could get himself, and sleep all
night in his bed like a Christian man. Not again would he be tempted
down the narrow way by a shadow with red lips and icy breath; not
again would he dream that dream of terror and delight. He was near
the village now; it was half an hour since the sun had set, and the
cracked church bell sent little discordant echoes across the rocks
and ravines to tell all good people that the day was done. Angelo
stood still a moment where the path forked, where it led toward the
village on the left, and down to the gorge on the right, where a
clump of chestnut trees overhung the narrow way. He stood still a
minute, lifting his battered hat from his head and gazing at the
fast-fading sea westward, and his lips moved as he silently repeated
the familiar evening prayer. His lips moved, but the words that
followed them in his brain lost their meaning and turned into others,
and ended in a name that he spoke aloud--Cristina! With the name, the
tension of his will relaxed suddenly, reality went out and the dream
took him again, and bore him on swiftly and surely like a man walking
in his sleep, down, down, by the steep path in the gathering
darkness. And as she glided beside him, Cristina whispered strange,
sweet things in his ear, which somehow, if he had been awake, he knew
that he could not quite have understood; but now they were the most
wonderful words he had ever heard in his life. And she kissed him
also, but not upon his mouth. He felt her sharp kisses upon his white
throat, and he knew that her lips were red. So the wild dream sped on
through twilight and darkness and moonrise, and all the glory of the
summer's night. But in the chilly dawn he lay as one half dead upon
the mound down there, recalling and not recalling, drained of his
blood, yet strangely longing to give those red lips more. Then came
the fear, the awful nameless panic, the mortal horror that guards the
confines of the world we see not, neither know of as we know of other
things, but which we feel when its icy chill freezes our bones and
stirs our hair with the touch of a ghostly hand. Once more Angelo
sprang from the mound and fled up the gorge in the breaking day, but
his step was less sure this time, and he panted for breath as he ran;
and when he came to the bright spring of water that rises half way up
the hillside, he dropped upon his knees and hands and plunged his
whole face in and drank as he had never drunk before--for it was the
thirst of the wounded man who has lain bleeding all night upon the
battle-field.</p>

<p>She had him fast now, and he could not escape her, but would come
to her every evening at dusk until she had drained him of his last
drop of blood. It was in vain that when the day was done he tried to
take another turning and to go home by a path that did not lead near
the gorge. It was in vain that he made promises to himself each
morning at dawn when he climbed the lonely way up from the shore to
the village. It was all in vain, for when the sun sank burning into
the sea, and the coolness of the evening stole out as from a
hiding-place to delight the weary world, his feet turned toward the
old way, and she was waiting for him in the shadow under the chestnut
trees; and then all happened as before, and she fell to kissing his
white throat even as she flitted lightly down the way, winding one
arm about him. And as his blood failed, she grew more hungry and more
thirsty every day, and every day when he awoke in the early dawn it
was harder to rouse himself to the effort of climbing the steep path
to the village; and when he went to his work his feet dragged
painfully, and there was hardly strength in his arms to wield the
heavy hoe. He scarcely spoke to anyone now, but the people said he
was "consuming himself" for love of the girl he was to have married
when he lost his inheritance; and they laughed heartily at the
thought, for this is not a very romantic country. At this time
Antonio, the man who stays here to look after the tower, returned
from a visit to his people, who live near Salerno. He had been away
all the time since before Alario's death and knew nothing of what had
happened. He has told me that he came back late in the afternoon and
shut himself up in the tower to eat and sleep, for he was very tired.
It was past midnight when he awoke, and when he looked out toward the
mound, and he saw something, and he did not sleep again that night.
When he went out again in the morning it was broad daylight, and
there was nothing to be seen on the mound but loose stones and driven
sand. Yet he did not go very near it; he went straight up the path to
the village and directly to the house of the old priest.</p>

<p>"I have seen an evil thing this night," he said; "I have seen how
the dead drink the blood of the living. And the blood is the
life."</p>

<p>"Tell me what you have seen," said the priest in reply.</p>

<p>Antonio told him everything he had seen.</p>

<p>"You must bring your book and your holy water to-night," he added.
"I will be here before sunset to go down with you, and if it pleases
your reverence to sup with me while we wait, I will make ready."</p>

<p>"I will come," the priest answered, "for I have read in old books
of these strange beings which are neither quick nor dead, and which
lie ever fresh in their graves, stealing out in the dusk to taste
life and blood."</p>

<p>Antonio cannot read, but he was glad to see that the priest
understood the business; for, of course, the books must have been
instructed him as to the best means of quieting the half-living Thing
for ever.</p>

<p>So Antonio went away to his work, which consists largely in
sitting on the shady side of the tower, when he is not perched upon a
rock with a fishing-line catching nothing. But on that day he went
twice to look at the mound in the bright sunlight, and he searched
round and round it for some hole through which the being might get in
and out; but he found none. When the sun began to sink and the air
was cooler in the shadows, he went up to fetch the old priest,
carrying a little wicker basket with him; and in this they placed a
bottle of holy water, and the basin, and sprinkler, and the stole
which the priest would need; and they came down and waited in the
door of the tower till it should be dark. But while the light still
lingered very grey and faint, they saw something moving, just there,
two figures, a man's that walked, and a woman's that flitted beside
him, and while her head lay on his shoulder she kissed his throat.
The priest has told me that, too, and that his teeth chattered and he
grasped Antonio's arm. The vision passed and disappeared into the
shadow. Then Antonio got the leathern flask of strong liquor, which
he kept for great occasions, and poured such a draught as made the
old man feel almost young again; and gave the priest his stole to put
on and the holy water to carry, and they went out together toward the
spot where the work was to be done. Antonio says that in spite of the
rum his own knees shook together, and the priest stumbled over his
Latin. For when they were yet a few yards from the mound the
flickering light of the lantern fell upon Angelo's white face,
unconscious as if in sleep, and on his upturned throat, over which a
very thin red line of blood trickled down into his collar; and the
flickering light of the lantern played upon another face that looked
up from the feast, upon two deep, dead eyes that saw in spite of
death--upon parted lips, redder than life itself--upon two gleaming
teeth on which glistened a rosy drop. Then the priest, good old man,
shut his eyes tight and showered holy water before him, and his
cracked voice rose almost to a scream; and then Antonio, who is no
coward after all, raised his pick in one hand and the lantern in the
other, as he sprang forward, not knowing what the end should be; and
then he swears that he heard a woman's cry, and the Thing was gone,
and Angelo lay alone on the mound unconscious, with the red line on
his throat and the beads of deathly sweat on his cold forehead. They
lifted him, half-dead as he was, and laid him on the ground close by;
then Antonio went to work, and the priest helped him, thought he was
old and could not do much; and they dug deep, and at last Antonio,
standing in the grave, stooped down with his lantern to see what he
might see.</p>

<p>His hair used to be dark brown, with grizzled streaks about the
temples; in less than a month from that day he was as grey as a
badger. He was a miner when he was young, and most of these fellows
have seen ugly sights now and then, when accidents have happened, but
he had never seen what he saw that night--that Thing which is neither
alive nor dead, that Thing that will abide neither above ground nor
in the grave. Antonio had brought something with him which the priest
had not noticed--a sharp stake shaped from a piece of tough old
driftwood. He had it with him now, and he had his heavy pick, and he
had taken the lantern down into the grave. I don't think any power on
earth could make him speak of what happened then, and the old priest
was too frightened to look in. He says he heard Antonio breathing
like a wild beast, and moving as if he were fighting with something
almost as strong as himself; and he heard an evil sound also, with
blows, as of something violently driven through flesh and bone; and
then, the most awful sound of all--a woman's shriek, the unearthly
scream of a woman neither dead nor alive, but buried deep for many
days. And he, the poor old priest, could only rock himself as he
knelt there in the sand, crying aloud his prayers and exorcisms to
drown these dreadful sounds. Then suddenly a small iron-bound chest
was thrown up and rolled over against the old man's knee, and in a
moment more Antonio was beside him, his face as white as tallow in
the flickering light of the lantern, shoveling the sand and pebbles
into the grave with furious haste, and looking over the edge till the
pit was half full; and the priest said that there was much fresh
blood on Antonio's hands and on his clothes.</p>

<p>I had come to the end of my story. Holger finished his wine and
leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"So Angelo got his own again." he said. "Did he marry the prim and
plump young person to whom he had been betrothed?"</p>

<p>"No; he had been badly frightened. He went to South America, and
has not been heard of since."</p>

<p>"And that poor thing's body is there still, I suppose," said
Holger. "Is it quite dead yet, I wonder?"</p>

<p>I wonder, too. But whether it be dead or alive, I should hardly
care to see it, even in broad daylight. Antonio is as grey as a
badger, and he has never been quite the same man since that
night.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5"></a>The Upper Berth</h2>

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<p>SOMEBODY asked for the cigars. We had talked long, and the
conversation as beginning to languish; the tobacco smoke had got into
the heavy curtains, he wine had got into those brains which were
liable to become heavy, and it was already perfectly evident that,
unless somebody did something to rouse our oppressed spirits, the
meeting would soon come to its natural conclusion, and we, the
guests, would speedily go home to bed, and most certainly to sleep.
No one had said anything very remarkable; it may be that no one had
anything very remarkable to say. Jones had given us every particular
of his last hunting adventure in Yorkshire. Mr. Tompkins, of Boston,
had explained at elaborate length those working principles, by the
due and careful maintenance of which the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa
F&eacute; Railroad not only extended its territory, increased its
departmental influence, and transported live stock without starving
them to death before the day of actual delivery, but, also, had for
years succeeded in deceiving those passengers who bought its tickets
into the fallacious belief that the corporation aforesaid was really
able to transport human life without destroying it. Signor Tombola
had endeavoured to persuade us, by arguments which we took no trouble
to oppose, that the unity of his country in no way resembled the
average modern torpedo, carefully planned, constructed with all the
skill of the greatest European arsenals, but, when constructed,
destined to be directed by feeble hands into a region where it must
undoubtedly explode, unseen, unfeared, and unheard, into the
illimitable wastes of political chaos.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to go into further details. The conversation had
assumed proportions which would have bored Prometheus on his rock,
which would have driven Tantalus to distraction, and which would have
impelled Ixion to seek relaxation in the simple but instructive
dialogues of Herr Ollendorff, rather than submit to the greater evil
of listening to our talk. We had sat at table for hours; we were
bored, we were tired, and nobody showed signs of moving.</p>

<p>Somebody called for cigars. We all instinctively looked towards
the speaker. Brisbane was a man of five-and-thirty years of age, and
remarkable for those gifts which chiefly attract the attention of
men. He was a strong man. The external proportions of his figure
presented nothing extraordinary to the common eye, though his size
was above the average. He was a little over six feet in height, and
moderately broad in the shoulder; he did not appear to be stout, but,
on the other hand, he was certainly not thin; his small head was
supported by a strong and sinewy neck; his broad, muscular hands
appeared to possess a peculiar skill in breaking walnuts without the
assistance of the ordinary cracker, and, seeing him in profile, one
could not help remarking the extraordinary breadth of his sleeves,
and the unusual thickness of his chest. He was one of those men who
are commonly spoken of among men as deceptive; that is to say, that
though he looked exceedingly strong he was in reality very much
stronger than he looked. Of his features I need say little. His head
was small, his hair is thin, his eyes are blue, his nose is large, he
has a small moustache, and a square jaw. Everybody knows Brisbane,
and when he asked for a cigar everybody looked at him.</p>

<p>"It is a very singular thing," said Brisbane.</p>

<p>Everybody stopped talking. Brisbane's voice was not loud, but
possessed a peculiar quality of penetrating general conversation, and
cutting it like a knife. Everybody listened. Brisbane, perceiving
that he had attracted their general attention, lit his cigar with
great equanimity.</p>

<p>"It is very singular," he continued, "that thing about ghosts.
People are always asking whether anybody has seen a ghost. I
have."</p>

<p>"Bosh! What, you? You don't mean to say so, Brisbane? Well, for a
man of his intelligence!"</p>

<p>A chorus of exclamations greeted Brisbane's remarkable statement.
Everybody called for cigars, and Stubbs, the butler, suddenly
appeared from the depths of nowhere with a fresh bottle of dry
champagne. The situation was saved; Brisbane was going to tell a
story.</p>

<p>I am an old sailor, said Brisbane, and as I have to cross the
Atlantic pretty often, I have my favourites. Most men have their
favourites. I have seen a man wait in a Broadway bar for
three-quarters of an hour for a particular car which he liked. I
believe the bar-keeper made at least one-third of his living by that
man's preference. I have a habit of waiting for certain ships when I
am obliged to cross that duck-pond. It may be a prejudice, but I was
never cheated out of a good passage but once in my life. I remember
it very well; it was a warm morning in June, and the Custom House
officials, who were hanging about waiting for a steamer already on
her way up from the Quarantine, presented a peculiarly hazy and
thoughtful appearance. I had not much luggage--I never have. I
mingled with the crowd of passengers, porters, and officious
individuals in blue coats and brass buttons, who seemed to spring up
like mushrooms from the deck of a moored steamer to obtrude their
unnecessary services upon the independent passenger. I have often
noticed with a certain interest the spontaneous evolution of these
fellows. They are not there when you arrive; five minutes after the
pilot has called 'Go ahead!' they, or at least their blue coats and
brass buttons, have disappeared from deck and gangway as completely
as though they had been consigned to that locker which tradition
ascribes to Davy Jones. But, at the moment of starting, they are
there, clean shaved, blue coated, and ravenous for fees. I hastened
on board. The Kamtschatka was one of my favourite ships. I saw was,
because she emphatically no longer is. I cannot conceive of any
inducement which could entice me to make another voyage in her. Yes,
I know what you are going to say. She is uncommonly clean in the run
aft, she has enough bluffing off in the bows to keep her dry, and the
lower berths are most of them double. She has a lot of advantages,
but I won't cross in her again. Excuse the digression. I got on
board. I hailed a steward, whose red nose and redder whiskers were
equally familiar to me.</p>

<p>"One hundred and five, lower berth," said I, in the businesslike
tone peculiar to men who think no more of crossing the Atlantic than
taking a whisky cocktail at down-town Delmonico's.</p>

<p>The steward took my portmanteau, greatcoat, and rug. I shall never
forget the expression on his face. Not that he turned pale. It is
maintained by the most eminent divines that even miracles cannot
change the course of nature. I have no hesitation in saying that he
did not turn pale; but, from his expression, I judged that he was
either about to shed tears, to sneeze, or to drop my portmanteau. As
the latter contained two bottles of particularly fine old sherry
presented to me for my voyage by my old friend Snigginson van
Pickyns, I felt extremely nervous. But the steward did none of these
things.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm d--d!" said he in a low voice, and led the way.</p>

<p>I supposed my Hermes, as he led me to the lower regions, had had a
little grog, but I said nothing, and followed him. One hundred and
five was on the port side, well aft. There was nothing remarkable
about the state-room. The lower berth, like most of those upon the
Kamtschatka, was double. There was plenty of room; there was the
usual washing apparatus, calculated to convey an idea of luxury to
the mind of a North American Indian; there were the usual inefficient
racks of brown wood, in which it is more easy to hand a large-sized
umbrella than the common tooth-brush of commerce. Upon the uninviting
mattresses were carefully bolded together those blankets which a
great modern humorist has aptly compared to cold buckwheat cakes. The
question of towels was left entirely to the imagination. The glass
decanters were filled with a transparent liquid faintly tinged with
brown, but from which an odour less faint, but not more pleasing,
ascended to the nostrils, like a far-off sea-sick reminiscence of
oily machinery. Sad-coloured curtains half-closed the upper berth.
The hazy June daylight shed a faint illumination upon the desolate
little scene. Ugh! how I hate that state-room!</p>

<p>The steward deposited my traps and looked at me, as though he
wanted to get away--probably in search of more passengers and more
fees. It is always a good plan to start in favour with those
functionaries, and I accordingly gave him certain coins there and
then.</p>

<p>"I'll try and make yer comfortable all I can," he remarked, as he
put the coins in his pocket. Nevertheless, there was a doubtful
intonation in his voice which surprised me. Possibly his scale of
fees had gone up, and he was not satisfied; but on the whole I was
inclined to think that, as he himself would have expressed it, he was
"the better for a glass". I was wrong, however, and did the man
injustice.</p>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>NOTHING especially worthy of mention occurred during that day. We
left the pier punctually, and it was very pleasant to be fairly under
way, for the weather was warm and sultry, and the motion of the
steamer produced a refreshing breeze. Everybody knows what the first
day at sea is like. People pace the decks and stare at each other,
and occasionally meet acquaintances whom they did not know to be on
board. There is the usual uncertainty as to whether the food will be
good, bad, or indifferent, until the first two meals have put the
matter beyond a doubt; there is the usual uncertainty about the
weather, until the ship is fairly off Fire Island. The tables are
crowded at first, and then suddenly thinned. Pale-faced people spring
from their seats and precipitate themselves towards the door, and
each old sailor breathes more freely as his sea-sick neighbour rushes
from his side, leaving him plenty of elbow-room and an unlimited
command over the mustard.</p>

<p>One passage across the Atlantic is very much like another, and we
who cross very often do not make the voyage for the sake of novelty.
Whales and icebergs are indeed always objects of interest, but, after
all, one whale is very much like another whale, and one rarely sees
an iceberg at close quarters. To the majority of us the most
delightful moment of the day on board an ocean steamer is when we
have taken our last turn on deck, have smoked our last cigar, and
having succeeded in tiring ourselves, feel at liberty to turn in with
a clear conscience. On that first night of the voyage I felt
particularly lazy, and went to bed in one hundred and five rather
earlier than I usually do. As I turned in, I was amazed to see that I
was to have a companion. A portmanteau, very like my own, lay in the
opposite corner, and in the upper berth had been deposited a
neatly-folded rug, with a stick and umbrella. I had hoped to be
alone, and I was disappointed; but I wondered who my room-mate was to
be, and I determined to have a look at him.</p>

<p>Before I had been long in bed he entered. He was, as far as I
could see, a very tall man, very thin, very pale, with sandy hair and
whiskers and colourless grey eyes. He had about him, I thought, an
air of rather dubious fashion; the short of man you might see in Wall
Street, without being able precisely to say what he was doing
there--the sort of man who frequents the Caf&eacute; Anglais, who
always seems to be alone and who drinks champagne; you might meet him
on a racecourse, but he would never appear to be doing anything there
either. A little over-dressed--a little odd. There are three or four
of his kind on every ocean steamer. I made up my mind that I did not
care to make his acquaintance, and I went to sleep saying to myself
that I would study his habits in order to avoid him. If he rose
early, I would rise late; if he went to bed late, I would go to bed
early. I did not care to know him. If you once know people of that
kind they are always turning up. Poor fellow! I need not have taken
the trouble to come to so many decisions about him, for I never saw
him again after that first night in one hundred and five.</p>

<p>I was sleeping soundly when I was suddenly waked by a loud noise.
To judge from the sound, my room-mate must have sprung with a single
leap from the upper berth to the floor. I heard him fumbling with the
latch and bolt of the door, which opened almost immediately, and then
I heard his footsteps as he ran at full speed down the passage,
leaving the door open behind him. The ship was rolling a little, and
I expected to hear him stumble or fall, but he ran as though he were
running for his life. The door swung on its hinges with the motion of
the vessel, and the sound annoyed me. I got up and shut it, and
groped my way back to my berth in the darkness. I went to sleep
again; but I have no idea how long I slept.</p>

<p>When I awoke it was still quite dark, but I felt a disagreeable
sensation of cold, and it seemed to me that the air was damp. You
know the peculiar smell of a cabin which has been wet with sea-water.
I covered myself up as well as I could and dozed off again, framing
complaints to be made the next day, and selecting the most powerful
epithets in the language. I could hear my room-mate turn over in the
upper berth. He had probably returned while I was asleep. Once I
thought I heard him groan, and I argued that he was sea-sick. That is
particularly unpleasant when one is below. Nevertheless I dozed off
and slept till early daylight.</p>

<p>The ship was rolling heavily, much more than on the previous
evening, and the grey light which came in through the porthole
changed in tint with every movement according as the angle of the
vessel's side turned the glass seawards or skywards. It was very
cold--unaccountably so for the month of June. I turned my head and
looked at the porthole, and saw to my surprise that it was wide open
and hooked back. I believe I swore audibly. Then I got up and shut
it. As I turned back I glanced at the upper berth. The curtains were
drawn close together; my companion had probably felt cold as well as
I. It struck me that I had slept enough. The state-room was
uncomfortable, though, strange to say, I could not smell the dampness
which had annoyed me in the night. My room-mate was still
asleep--excellent opportunity for avoiding him, so I dressed at once
and went on deck. The day was warm and cloudy, with an oily smell on
the water. It was seven o'clock as I came out--much later than I had
imagined. I came across the doctor, who was taking his first sniff of
the morning air. He was a young man from the West of Ireland--a
tremendous fellow, with black hair and blue eyes, already inclined to
be stout; he had a happy-go-lucky, healthy look about him which was
rather attractive.</p>

<p>"Fine morning," I remarked, by way of introduction.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, eyeing me with an air of ready interest, "it's a
fine morning and it's not a fine morning. I don't think it's much of
a morning."</p>

<p>"Well, no--it is not so very fine," said I.</p>

<p>"It's just what I call fuggly weather," replied the doctor.</p>

<p>"It was very cold last night, I thought," I remarked. "However,
when I looked about, I found that the porthole was wide open. I had
not noticed it when I went to bed. And the state-room was damp,
too."</p>

<p>"Damp!" said he. "Whereabouts are you?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and five---"</p>

<p>To my surprise the doctor started visibly, and stared at me.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh--nothing," he answered; "only everybody has complained of that
state-room for the last three trips."</p>

<p>"I shall complain too," I said. "It has certainly not been
properly aired. It is a shame!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it can be helped," answered the doctor. "I
believe there is something--well, it is not my business to frighten
passengers."</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid of frightening me," I replied. "I can
stand any amount of damp. If I should get a bad cold I will come to
you."</p>

<p>I offered the doctor a cigar, which he took and examined very
critically.</p>

<p>"It is not so much the damp," he remarked. "However, I dare say
you will get on very well. Have you a room-mate?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a deuce of a fellow, who bolts out in the middle of the
night, and leaves the door open."</p>

<p>Again the doctor glanced curiously at me. Then he lit the cigar
and looked grave.</p>

<p>"Did he come back?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"Yes. I was asleep, but I waked up, and heard him moving. Then I
felt cold and went to sleep again. This morning I found the porthole
open."</p>

<p>"Look here," said the doctor quietly, "I don't care much for this
ship. I don't care a rap for her reputation. I tell you what I will
do. I have a good-sized place up here. I will share it with you,
though I don't know you from Adam."</p>

<p>I was very much surprised at the proposition. I could not imagine
why he should take such a sudden interest in my welfare. However, his
manner as he spoke of the ship was peculiar.</p>

<p>"You are very good, doctor," I said. "But, really, I believe even
now the cabin could be aired, or cleaned out, or something. Why do
you not care for the ship?"</p>

<p>"We are not superstitious in our profession, sir," replied the
doctor, "but the sea makes people so. I don't want to prejudice you,
and I don't want to frighten you, but if you will take my advice you
will move in here. I would as soon see you overboard," he added
earnestly, "as know that you or any other man was to sleep in one
hundred and five."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Just because on the last three trips the people who have slept
there actually have gone overboard," he answered gravely.</p>

<p>The intelligence was startling and exceedingly unpleasant, I
confess. I looked hard at the doctor to see whether he was making
game of me, but he looked perfectly serious. I thanked him warmly for
his offer, but told him I intended to be the exception to the rule by
which every one who slept in that particular state-room went
overboard. He did not say much, but looked as grave as ever, and
hinted that, before we got across, I should probably reconsider his
proposal. In the course of time we went to breakfast, at which only
an inconsiderable number of passengers assembled. I noticed that one
or two of the officers who breakfasted with us looked grave. After
breakfast I went into my state-room in order to get a book. The
curtains of the upper berth were still closely drawn. Not a word was
to be heard. My room-mate was probably still asleep.</p>

<p>As I came out I met the steward whose business it was to look
after me. He whispered that the captain wanted to see me, and then
scuttled away down the passage as if very anxious to avoid any
questions. I went toward the captain's cabin, and found him waiting
for me.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, "I want to ask a favour of you."</p>

<p>I answered that I would do anything to oblige him.</p>

<p>"Your room-mate had disappeared," he said. "He is known to have
turned in early last night. Did you notice anything extraordinary in
his manner?"</p>

<p>The question coming, as it did, in exact confirmation of the fears
the doctor had expressed half an hour earlier, staggered me.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say he has gone overboard?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I fear he has," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"This is the most extraordinary thing--" I began.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He is the fourth, then?" I exclaimed. In answer to another
question from the captain, I explained, without mentioning the
doctor, that I had heard the story concerning one hundred and five.
He seemed very much annoyed at hearing that I knew of it. I told him
what had occurred in the night.</p>

<p>"What you say," he replied, "coincides almost exactly with what
was told me by the room-mates of two of the other three. They bolt
out of bed and run down the passage. Two of them were seen to go
overboard by the watch; we stopped and lowered boats, but they were
not found. Nobody, however, saw or heard the man who was lost last
night--if he is really lost. The steward, who is a superstitious
fellow, perhaps, and expected something to go wrong, went to look for
him, this morning, and found his berth empty, but his clothes lying
about, just as he had left them. The steward was the only man on
board who knew him by sight, and he has been searching everywhere for
him. He has disappeared! Now, sir, I want to beg you not to mention
the circumstance to any of the passengers; I don't want the ship to
get a bad name, and nothing hangs about an ocean-goer like stories of
suicides. You shall have your choice of any one of the officers'
cabins you like, including my own, for the rest of the passage. Is
that a fair bargain?"</p>

<p>"Very," said I; "and I am much obliged to you. But since I am
alone, and have the state-room to myself, I would rather not move. If
the steward will take out that unfortunate man's things, I would as
leave stay where I am. I will not say anything about the matter, and
I think I can promise you that I will not follow my room-mate."</p>

<p>The captain tried to dissuade me from my intention, but I
preferred having a state-room alone to being the chum of any officer
on board. I do not know whether I aced foolishly, but if I had taken
his advice I should have had nothing more to tell. There would have
remained the disagreeable coincidence of several suicides occurring
among men who had slept in the same cabin, but that would have been
all.</p>

<p>That was not the end of the matter, however, by any means. I
obstinately made up my mind that I would not be disturbed by such
tales, and I even went so far as to argue the question with the
captain. There was something wrong about the state-room, I said. It
was rather damp. The porthole had been left open last night. My
room-mate might have been ill when he came on board, and he might
have become delirious after he went to bed. He might even now be
hiding somewhere on board, and might be found later. The place ought
to be aired and the fastening on the port looked to. If the captain
would give me leave, I would see that what I thought necessary were
done immediately.</p>

<p>"Of course you have a right to stay where you are if you please,"
he replied, rather petulantly; "but I wish you would turn out and let
me lock the place up, and be done with it."</p>

<p>I did not see it in the same light, and left the captain, after
promising to be silent concerning the disappearance of my companion.
The latter had had no acquaintances on board, and was not missed in
the course of the day. Towards evening I met the doctor again, and he
asked me whether I had changed my mind. I told him I had not.</p>

<p>"Then you will before long," he said, very gravely.</p>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>WE played whist in the evening, and I went to bed late. I will
confess now that I felt a disagreeable sensation when I entered my
state-room. I could not help thinking of the tall man I had seen on
the previous night, who was now dead, drowned, tossing about in the
long swell, two or three hundred miles astern. His face rose very
distinctly before me as I undressed, and I even went so far as to
draw back the curtains of the upper berth, as though to persuade
myself that he was actually gone. I also bolted the door of the
state-room. Suddenly I became aware that the porthole was open, and
fastened back. This was more than I could stand. I hastily threw on
my dressing-gown and went in search of Robert, the steward of my
passage. I was very angry, I remember, and when I found him I dragged
him roughly to the door of one hundred and five, and pushed him
towards the open porthole.</p>

<p>"What the deuce do you mean, you scoundrel, by leaving that port
open every night? Don't you know it is against the regulations? Don't
you know that if the ship heeled and the water began to come in, ten
men could not shut it? I will report you to the captain, you
blackguard, for endangering the ship!"</p>

<p>I was exceedingly wroth. The man trembled and turned pale, and
then began to shut the round glass plate with the heavy brass
fittings.</p>

<p>"Why don't you answer me?" I said roughly.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," faltered Robert, "there's nobody on board as
can keep this 'ere port shut at night. You can try it yourself, sir.
I ain't a-going to stop hany longer on board o' this vessel, sir; I
ain't, indeed. But if I was you, sir, I'd just clear out and go and
sleep with the surgeon, or something, I would. Look 'ere, sir, is
that fastened what you may call securely, or not, sir? Try it, sir,
see if it will move a hinch."</p>

<p>I tried the port, and found it perfectly tight.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," continued Robert triumphantly, "I wager my reputation
as a A1 steward that in 'arf an hour it will be open again; fasteneed
back, too, sir, that's the horful thing--fastened back!"</p>

<p>I examined the great screw and the looped nut that ran on it.</p>

<p>"If I find it open in the night, Robert, I will give you a
sovereign. It is not possible. You may go."</p>

<p>"Soverin' did you say, sir? Very good, sir. Thank ye, sir.
Good-night, sir. Pleasant reepose, sir, and all manner of hinchantin'
dreams, sir."</p>

<p>Robert scuttled away, delighted at being released. Of course, I
thought he was trying to account for his negligence by a silly story,
intended to frighten me, and I disbelieved him. The consequence was
that he got his sovereign, and I spent a very peculiarly unpleasant
night.</p>

<p>I went to bed, and five minutes after I had rolled myself up in my
blankets the inexorable Robert extinguished the light that burned
steadily behind the ground-glass pane near the door. I lay quite
still in the dark trying to go to sleep, but I soon found that
impossible. It had been some satisfaction to be angry with the
steward, and the diversion had banished that unpleasant sensation I
had at first experienced when I thought of the drowned man who had
been my chum; but I was no longer sleepy, and I lay awake for some
time, occasionally glancing at the porthole, which I could just see
from where I lay, and which, in the darkness, looked like a
faintly-luminous soup-plate suspended in blackness. I believe I must
have lain there for an hour, and, as I remember, I was just dozing
into sleep when I was roused by a draught of cold air, and by
distinctly feeling the spray of the sea blown upon my face. I started
to my feet, and not having allowed in the dark for the motion of the
ship, I was instantly thrown violently across the state-room upon the
couch which was placed beneath the port-hole. I recovered myself
immediately, however, and climbed upon my knees. The port-hole was
again wide open and fastened back!</p>

<p>Now these things are facts. I was wide awake when I got up, and I
should certainly have been waked by the fall had I still been dozing.
Moreover, I bruised my elbows and knees badly, and the bruises were
there on the following morning to testify to the fact, if I myself
had doubted it. The porthole was wide open and fastened back--a thing
so unaccountable that I remember very well feeling astonishment
rather that fear when I discovered it. I at once closed the plate
again, and screwed down the loop nut with all my strength. It was
very dark in the state-room. I reflected that the port had certainly
been opened within an hour after Robert had at first shut it in my
presence, and I determined to watch it, and see whether it would open
again. Those brass fittings are very heavy and by no means easy to
move; I could not believe that the clamp had been turned by the
shaking of the screw. I stood peering out through the thick glass at
the alternate white and grey streaks of the sea that foamed beneath
the ship's side. I must have remained there a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I stood, I distinctly heard something moving behind
me in one of the berths, and a moment afterwards, just as I turned
instinctively to look--though I could, of course, see nothing in the
darkness--I heard a very faint groan. I sprang across the state-room,
and tore the curtains of the upper berth aside, thrusting in my hands
to discover if there were any one there. There was some one.</p>

<p>I remember that the sensation as I put my hands forward was as
though I were plunging them into the air of a damp cellar, and from
behind the curtains came a gust of wind that smelled horribly of
stagnant sea-water. I laid hold of something that had the shape of a
man's arm, but was smooth, and wet, and icy cold. But suddenly, as I
pulled, the creature sprang violently forward against me, a clammy
oozy mass, as it seemed to me, heavy and wet, yet endowed with a sort
of supernatural strength. I reeled across the state-room, and in an
instant the door opened and the thing rushed out. I had not had time
to be frightened, and quickly recovering myself, I sprang through the
door and gave chase at the top of my speed, but I was too late. Ten
yards before me I could see--I am sure I saw it--a dark shadow moving
in the dimly lighted passage, quickly as the shadow of a fast horse
thrown before a dog-cart by the lamp on a dark night. But in a moment
it had disappeared, and I found myself holding on to the polished
rail that ran along the bulkhead where the passage turned towards the
companion. My hair stood on end, and the cold perspiration rolled
down my face. I am not ashamed of it in the least: I was very badly
frightened.</p>

<p>Still I doubted my senses, and pulled myself together. It was
absurd, I thought. The Welsh rare-bit I had eaten had disagreed with
me. I had been in a nightmare. I made my way back to my state-room,
and entered it with an effort. The whole place smelled of stagnant
sea-water, as it had when I had waked on the previous evening. It
required my utmost strength to go in, and grope among my things for a
box of wax lights. As I lighted a railway reading lantern which I
always carry in case I want to read after the lamps are out, I
perceived that the porthole was again open, and a sort of creeping
horror began to take possession of me which I never felt before, nor
wish to feel again. But I got a light and proceeded to examine the
upper berth, expecting to find it drenched with sea-water.</p>

<p>But I was disappointed. The bed had been slept in, and the smell
of the sea was strong; but the bedding was as dry as a bone. I
fancied that Robert had not had the courage to make the bed after the
accident of the previous night--it had all been a hedeous dream. I
drew the curtains back as far as I could and examined the place very
carefully. It was perfectly dry. But the porthole was open again.
With a sort of dull bewilderment of horror I closed it and screwed it
down, and thrusting my heavy stick through the brass loop, wrenched
it with all my might, till the thick metal began to bend under the
pressure. Then I hooked my reading lantern into the red velvet at the
head of the couch, and sat down to recover my senses if I could. I
sat there all night, unable to think of rest--hardly able to think at
all. But the porthole remained closed, and I did not believe it would
now open again without the application of a considerable force.</p>

<p>The morning dawned at last, and I dressed myself slowly, thinking
over all that had happened in the night. It was a beautiful day and I
went on deck, glad to get out into the early, pure sunshine, and to
smell the breeze from the blue water, so different from the noisome,
stagnant odour of my state-room. Instinctively I turned aft, towards
the surgeon's cabin. There he stood, with a pipe inhis mouth, taking
his morning airing precisely as on the preceding day.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said he quietly, but looking at me with evident
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Doctor, you were quite right," said I. "There is something wrong
about that place."</p>

<p>"I thought you would change your mind," he answered, rather
triumphantly. "You have had a bad night, eh? Shall I make you a
pick-me-up? I have a capital recipe."</p>

<p>"No, thanks," I cried. "But I would like to tell you what
happened."</p>

<p>I then tried to explain as clearly as possible precisely what had
occurred, not omitting to state that I had been scared as I had never
been scared in my whole life before. I dwelt particularly on the
phenomenon of the porthole, which was a fact to which I could
testify, even if the rest had been an illusion. I had closed it twice
in the night, and the second time I had actually bent the brass in
wrenching it with my stick. I believe I insisted a good deal on this
point.</p>

<p>"You seem to think I am likely to doubt the story," said the
doctor, smiling at my detailed account of the state of the porthole.
"I do not doubt in the least. I renew my invitation to you. Bring
your traps here, and take half my cabin."</p>

<p>"Come and take half of mine for one night," I said. "Help me to
get at the bottom of this thing."</p>

<p>"You will get to the bottom of something else if you try,"
answered the doctor.</p>

<p>"What?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The bottom of the sea. I am going to leave this ship. It is not
canny."</p>

<p>"Then you will not help me to find out--"</p>

<p>"Not I," said the doctor quickly. "It is my business to keep my
wits aobut me--not to go fiddling about with ghosts and things."</p>

<p>"Do you really believe it is a ghost?" I enquired, rather
contemptuously. But as I spoke I remembered very well the horrible
sensation of the supernatural which had got possession of me during
the night. The doctor turned sharply on me--</p>

<p>"Have you any reasonable explanation of these things to offer?" he
asked. "No; you have not. Well, you say you will find an explanation.
I say that you won't, sir, simply because there is not any."</p>

<p>"But, my dear sir," I retorted, "do you, a man of science, mean to
tell me that such things cannot be explained?"</p>

<p>"I do," he answered stoutly. "And, if they could, I would not be
concerned in the explanation."</p>

<p>I did not care to spend another night alone in the state-room, and
yet I was obstinately determined to get at the root of the
disturbances. I do not believe there are many men who would have
slept there alone, after passing two such nights. But I made up my
mind to try it, if I could not get any one to share a watch with me.
The doctor was evidently not inclined for such an experiment. He said
he was a surgeon, and that in case any accident occurred on board he
must be always in readiness. He could not afford to have his nerves
unsettled. Perhaps he was quite right, but I am inclined to think
that his precaution was prompted by his inclination. On enquiry, he
informed me that there was no one on board who would be likely to
join me in my investigations, and after a little more conversation I
left him. A little later I met the captain, and told him my story. I
said that, if no one would spend the night with me, I would ask leave
to have the light burning all night, and would try it alone.</p>

<p>"Look here," said he, "I will tell you what I will do. I will
share your watch myself, and we will see what happens. It is my
belief that we can find out between us. There may be some fellow
skulking on board, who steals a passage by frightening the
passengers. It is just possible that there may be something queer in
the carpentering of that berth."</p>

<p>I suggested taking the ship's carpenter below and examining the
place; but I was overjoyed at the captain's offer to spend the night
with me. He accordingly sent for the workman and ordered him to do
anything I required. We went below at once. I had all the bedding
cleared out of the upper berth, and we examined the place thoroughly
to see if there was a board loose anywhere, or a panel which could be
opened or pushed aside. We tried the planks everywhere, tapped the
flooring, unscrewed the fittings of the lower berth and took it to
pieces--in short, there was not a square inch of the state-room which
was not searched and tested. Everything was in perfect order, and we
put everything back in its place. As we were finishing our work,
Robert came to the door and looked in.</p>

<p>"Well, sir--find anything, sir?" he asked, with a ghastly
grin.</p>

<p>"You were right about the porthole, Robert," I said, and I gave
him the promised sovereign. The carpenter did his work silently and
skilfully, following my directions. When he had done he spoke.</p>

<p>"I'm a plain man, sir," he said. "But it's my belief you had
better just turn out your things, and let me run half a dozen
four-inch screws through the door of this cabin. There's no good
never came o' this cabin yet, sir, and that's all about it. There's
been four lives lost out o' here to my own remembrance, and that is
four trips. Better give it up, sir--better give it up!"</p>

<p>"I will try it for one night more," I said.</p>

<p>"Better give it up, sir--better give it up! It's a precious bad
job," repeated the workman, putting his tools in his bag and leaving
the cabin.</p>

<p>But my spirits had risen considerably at the prospect of having
the captain's company, and I made up my mind not to be prevented from
going to the end of this strange business. I abstained from Welsh
rare-bits and grog that evening, and did not even join in the
customary game of whist. I wanted to be quite sure of my nerves, and
my vanity made me anxious to make a good figure in the captain's
eyes.</p>

<h3>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>THE captain was one of those splendidly tough and cheerful
specimens of seafaring humanity whose combined courage, hardihood,
and calmness in difficulty leads them naturally into high positions
of trust. He was not the man to be led away by an idle tale, and the
mere fact that he was willing to join me in the investigation was
proof that he thought there was something seriously wrong, which
could not be accounted for on ordinary theories, nor laughed down as
a common superstition. To some extent, too, his reputation was at
stake, as well as the reputation of the ship. It is no light thing to
lose passengers overboard, and he knew it.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock that evening, as I was smoking a last cigar, he
came up to me, and drew me aside from the beat of the other
passengers who were patrolling the deck in the warm darkness.</p>

<p>"This is a serious matter, Mr. Brisbane," he said. "We must make
up our minds either way--to be disappointed or to have a pretty rough
time of it. You see I cannot afford to laugh at the affair, and I
will ask you to sign your name to a statement of whatever occurs. If
nothing happens tonight we will try it again tomorrow and next day.
Are you ready?"</p>

<p>So we went below, and entered the state-room. As we went in I
could see Robert the steward, who stood a little further down the
passage, watching us, with his usual grin, as though certain that
something dreadful was about to happen. The captain closed the door
behind us and bolted it.</p>

<p>"Supposing we put your portmanteau before the door," he suggested.
"One of us can sit on it. Nothing can get out then. Is the port
screwed down?"</p>

<p>I found it as I had left it in the morning. Indeed, without using
a lever, as I had done, no one could have opened it. I drew back the
curtains of the upper berth so that I could see well into it. By the
captain's advice I lighted my reading lantern, and placed it so that
it shone upon the white sheets above. He insisted upon sitting on the
portmanteau, declaring that he wished to be able to swear that he had
sat before the door.</p>

<p>Then he requested me to search the state-room thoroughly, an
operation very soon accomplished, as it consisted merely in looking
beneath the lower berth and under the couch below the porthole. The
spaces were quite empty.</p>

<p>"It is impossible for any human being to get in," I said, "or for
any human being to open the port."</p>

<p>"Very good," said the captain calmly. "If we see anything now, it
must be either imagination or something supernatural."</p>

<p>I sat down on the edge of the lower berth.</p>

<p>"The first time it happened," said the captain, crossing his legs
and leaning back against the door, "was in March. The passenger who
slept here, in the upper berth, turned out have been a lunatic--at
all events, he was known to have been a little touched, and he had
taken his passage without the knowledge of his friends. He rushed out
in the middle of the night, and threw himself overboard, before the
officer who had the watch could stop him. We stopped and lowered a
boat; it was a quiet night, just before that heavy weather came on;
but we could not find him. Of course his suicide was afterwards
accounted for on the ground of his insanity."</p>

<p>"I suppose that often happens?" I remarked, rather absently.</p>

<p>"Not often--no," said the captain; "never before in my experience,
though I have heard of it happening on board of other ships. Well, as
I was saying, that occurred in March. On the very next trip---What
are you looking at?" he asked, stopping suddenly in his
narration.</p>

<p>I believe I gave no answer. My eyes were riveted upon the
porthole. It seemed to me that the brass loop-nut was beginning to
turn very slowly upon the screw--so slowly, however, that I was not
sure it moved at all. I watched it intently, fixing its position in
my mind, and trying to ascertain whether it changed. Seeing where I
was looking, the captain looked too.</p>

<p>"It moves!" he exclaimed, in a tone of conviction. "No, it does
not," he added, after a minute.</p>

<p>"If it were the jarring of the screw," said I, "it would have
opened during the day; but I found it this evening jammed tight as I
left it this morning."</p>

<p>I rose and tried the nut. It was certainly loosened, for by an
effort I could move it with my hands.</p>

<p>"The queer thing," said the captain, "is that the second man who
was lost is supposed to have got through that very port. We had a
terrible time over it. It was in the middle of the night, and the
weather was very heavy; there was an alarm that one of the ports was
open and the sea running in. I came below and found everything
flooded, the water pouring in every time she rolled, and the whole
port swinging from the top bolts--not the porthole in the middle.
Well, we managed to shut it, but the water did some damage. Ever
since that the place smells of sea-water from time to time. We
supposed the passenger had thrown himself out, though the Lord only
knows how he did it. The steward kept telling me that he cannot keep
anything shut here. Upon my word--I can smell it now, cannot you?" he
enquired, sniffing the air suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Yes--distinctly," I said, and I shuddered as that same odour of
stagnant sea-water grew stronger in the cabin. "Now, to smell like
this, the place must be damp," I continued, "and yet when I examined
it with the carpenter this morning everything was perfectly dry. It
is most extraordinary--hallo!"</p>

<p>My reading lantern, which had been placed in the upper berth, was
suddenly extinguished. There was still a good deal of light from the
pane of ground glass near the door, behind which loomed the
regulation lamp. The ship rolled heavily, and the curtain of the
upper berth swung far out into the state-room and back again. I rose
quickly from my seat on the edge of the bed, and the captain at the
same moment started to his feet with a loud cry of surprise. I had
turned with the intention of taking down the lantern to examine it,
when I heard his exclamation, and immediately afterwards his call for
help. I sprang towards him. He was wrestling with all his might with
the brass loop of the port. It seemed to turn against his hands in
spite of all his efforts. I caught up my cane, a heavy oak stick I
always used to carry, and thrust it through the ring and bore on it
with all my strength. But the strong wood snapped suddenly and I fell
upon the couch. When I rose again the port was wide open, and the
captain was standing with his back against the door, pale to the
lips.</p>

<p>"There is something in that berth!" he cried, in a strange voice,
his eyes almost starting from his head. "Hold the door, while I
look--it shall not escape us, whatever it is!"</p>

<p>But instead of taking his place, I sprang upon the lower bed, and
seized something which lay in the upper berth.</p>

<p>It was something ghostly, horrible beyond words, and it moved in
my grip. It was like the body of a man long drowned, and yet it
moved, and had the strength of ten men living; but I gripped it with
all my might--the slippery, oozy, horrible thing--the dead white eyes
seemed to stare at me out of the dusk; the putrid odour of rank
sea-water was about it, and its shiny hair hung in foul wet curls
over its dead face. I wrestled with the dead thing; it thrust itself
upon me and forced me back and nearly broke my arms; it wound its
corpse's arms about my neck, the living death, and overpowered me, so
that I, at last, cried aloud and fell, and left my hold.</p>

<p>As I fell the thing sprang across me, and seemed to throw itself
upon the captain. When I last saw him on his feet his face was white
and his lips set. It seemed to me that he struck a violent blow at
the dead being, and then he, too, fell forward upon his face, with an
inarticulate cry of horror.</p>

<p>The thing paused an instant, seeming to hover over his prostrate
body, and I could have screamed again for very fright, but I had no
voice left. The thing vanished sudddenly, and it seemed to my
disturbed senses that it made its exit through the open port, though
how that was possible, considering the smallness of the aperture, is
more than any one can tell. I lay a long time on the floor, and the
captain lay beside me. At last I partially recovered my senses and
moved, and instantly I knew that my arm was broken--the small bone of
my left forearm near the wrist.</p>

<p>I got upon my feet somehow, and with my remaining hand I tried to
raise the captain. He groaned and moved, and at last came to himself.
He was not hurt, but he seemed badly stunned.</p>

<p>Well, do you want to hear any more? There is nothing more. That is
the end of my story. The carpenter carried out his scheme of running
half a dozen four-inch screws through the door of one hundred and
five; and if ever you take a passage in the Kamtschatka, you may ask
for a berth in that state-room. You will be told that it is
engaged--yes--it is engaged by that dead thing.</p>

<p>I finished the trip in the surgeon's cabin. He doctored my broken
arm, and advised me not to "fiddle about with ghosts and things" any
more. The captain was very silent, and never sailed again in that
ship, though it is still running. And I will not sail in her either.
It was a very disagreeable experience, and I was very badly
frightened, which is a thing I do not like. That is all. That is how
I saw a ghost--if it was a ghost. It was dead, anyhow.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6"></a>By the Waters of Paradise</h2>

<h3>Chapter i</h3>

<p>I REMEMBER my childhood very distinctly. I do not think that the
fact argues a good memory, for I have never been clever at learning
words by heart, in prose or rhyme; so that I believe my remembrance
of events depends much more upon the events themselves than upon my
possessing any special facility for recalling them. Perhaps I am too
imaginative, and the earliest impressions I received were of a kind
to stimulate the imagination abnormally. Along series of little
misfortunes, connected with each other so as to suggest a sort of
weird fatality, so worked upon my melancholy temperament when I was a
boy that, before I was of age, I sincerely believed myself to be
under a curse, and not only myself, but my whole family, and every
individual who bore my name.</p>

<p>I was born in the old place where my father, and his father, and
all his predecessors had been born, beyond the memory of man. It is a
very old house, and the greater part of it was originally a castle,
strongly fortified, and surrounded by a deep moat supplied with
abundant water from the hills by a hidden aqueduct. Many of the
fortifications have been destroyed, and the moat has been filled up.
The water from the aqueduct supplies great fountains, and runs down
into huge oblong basins in the terraced gardens, one below the other,
each surrounded by a broad pavement of marble between the water and
the flower-beds. The waste surplus finally escapes through an
artificial grotto, some thirty yards long, into a stream, flowing
down through the park to the meadows beyond, and thence to the
distant river. The buildings were extended a little and greatly
altered more than two hundred years ago, in the time of Charles II.,
but since then little has been done to improve them, though they have
been kept in fairly good repair, according to our fortunes.</p>

<p>In the gardens there are terraces and huge hedges of box and
evergreen, some of which used to be clipped into shapes of animals,
in the Italian style. I can remember when I was a lad how I used to
try to make out what the trees were cut to represent, and how I used
to appeal for explanations to Judith, my Welsh nurse. She dealt in a
strange mythology of her own, and peopled the gardens with griffins,
dragons, good genii and bad, and filled my mind with them at the same
time. My nursery window afforded a view of the great fountains at the
head of the upper basin, and on moonlight nights the Welshwoman would
hold me up to the glass, and bid me look at the mist and spray rising
into mysterious shapes, moving mystically in the white light like
living things.</p>

<p>"It's the Woman of the Water," she used to say; and sometimes she
would threaten that, if I did not go to sleep, the Woman of the Water
would steal up to the high window end carry me away in her wet
arms.</p>

<p>The place was gloomy. The broad basins of water and the tall
evergreen hedges gave it a funereal look, and the damp-stained marble
causeways by the pools might have been made of tombstones. The grey
and weather-beaten walls and towers without, the dark and massively
furnished rooms within, the deep, mysterious recesses and the heavy
curtains, all affected my spirits. I was silent and sad from my
childhood. There was a great clock-tower above, from which the hours
rang dismally during the day and tolled like a knell in the dead of
night. There was no light nor life in the house, for my mother was a
helpless invalid, and my father had grown melancholy in his long task
of caring for her. He was a thin, dark man, with sad eyes; kind, I
think, but silent and unhappy. Next to my mother, I believe he loved
me better than anything on earth, for he took immense pains and
trouble in teaching me, and what he taught me I have never
forgotten.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was his only amusement, and that may be the reason why
I had no nursery governess or teacher of any kind while he lived.</p>

<p>I used to be taken to see my mother every day, and sometimes twice
a day, for an hour at a time. Then I sat upon a little stool near her
feet, and she would ask me what I had been doing, and what I wanted
to do. I dare say she saw already the seeds of a profound melancholy
in my nature, for she looked at me always with a sad smile, and
kissed me with a sigh when I was taken away.</p>

<p>One night, when I was just six years old, I lay awake in the
nursery. The door was not quite shut, and the Welsh nurse was sitting
sewing in the next room. Suddenly I heard her groan, and say in a
strange voice, "One--two--one--two!" I was frightened, and I jumped
up and ran to the door, barefooted as I was.</p>

<p>"What is it, Judith?" I cried, clinging to her skirts. I can
remember the look in her strange dark eyes as she answered.</p>

<p>"One--two leaden coffins, fallen from the ceiling!" she crooned,
working herself in her chair.</p>

<p>"One--two--a light coffin and a heavy coffin, failing to the
floor!"</p>

<p>Then she seemed to notice me, and she took me back to bed and sang
me to sleep with a queer old Welsh song.</p>

<p>I do not know how it was, but the impression got hold of me that
she had meant that my father and mother were going to die very soon.
They died in the very room where she had been sitting that night. It
was a great room, my day nursery, full of sun when there was any; and
when the days were dark it was the most cheerful place in the house.
My mother grew rapidly worse, and I was transferred to another part
of the building to make place for her. They thought my nursery was
gayer for her, I suppose; but she could not live. She was beautiful
when she was dead, and I cried bitterly.</p>

<p>"The light one, the light one--the heavy one to come," crooned the
Welshwoman. And she was right. My father took the room after my
mother was gone, and day by day he grew thinner and paler and
sadder.</p>

<p>"The heavy one, the heavy one--all of lead," moaned my nurse, one
night in December, standing still, just as she was going to take away
the light after putting me to bed. Then she took me up again, and
wrapped me in a little gown, and led me away to my father's room. She
knocked, but no one answered. She opened the door, and we found him
in his easy-chair before the fire, very white, quite dead.</p>

<p>So I was alone with the Welshwoman till strange people came, and
relations, whom I had never seen; and then I heard them saying that I
must be taken away to some more cheerful place. They were kind
people, and I will not believe that they were kind only because I was
to be very rich when I grew to be a man. The world never seemed to be
a very bad place to me, nor all the people to be miserable sinners,
even when I was most melancholy. I do not remember that any one ever
did me any great injustice, nor that I was ever oppressed or
ill-treated in any way, even by the boys at school. I was sad, I
suppose, because my childhood was so gloomy, and, later, because I
was unlucky in everything I undertook, till I finally believed I was
pursued by fate, and I used to dream that the old Welsh nurse and the
Woman of the Waters between them had vowed to pursue me to my end.
But my natural disposition should have been cheerful, as I have often
thought.</p>

<p>Among lads of my age I was never last, or even among the last, in
anything; but I was never first.</p>

<p>If I trained for a race, I was sure to sprain my ankle on the day
when I was to run. If I pulled an oar with others, my oar was sure to
break. If I competed for a prize, some unforeseen accident prevented
my winning it at the last moment. Nothing to which I put my hand
succeeded, and I got the reputation of being unlucky, until my
companions felt it was always safe to bet against me, no matter what
the appearances might be. I became discouraged and listless in
everything. I gave up the idea of competing for any distinction at
the University, comforting myself with the thought that I could not
fail in the examination for the ordinary degree. The day before the
examination began I fell ill; and when at last I recovered, after a
narrow escape from death, I turned my back upon Oxford, and went down
alone to visit the old place where I had been born, feeble in health
and profoundly disgusted and discouraged. I was twenty-one years of
age, master of myself and of my fortune; but so deeply had the long
chain of small unlucky circumstances affected me, that I thought
seriously of shutting myself up from the world to live the life of a
hermit, and to die as soon as possible. Death seemed the only
cheerful possibility in my existence, and my thoughts soon dwelt upon
it altogether.</p>

<p>I had never shown any wish to return to my own home since I had
been taken away as a little boy, and no one had ever pressed me to do
so. The place had been kept in order after a fashion, and did not
seem to have suffered during the fifteen years or more of my absence.
Nothing earthly could affect those odd grey walls that had fought the
elements for so many centuries. The garden was more wild than I
remembered it; the marble causeways about the pools looked more
yellow and damp than of old, and the whole place at first looked
smaller. It was not until I had wandered about the house and grounds
for many hours that I realised the huge size of the home where I was
to live in solitude. Then I began to delight in it, and my resolution
to live alone grew stronger.</p>

<p>The people had turned out to welcome me, of course, and I tried to
recognise the changed faces of the old gardener and the old
housekeeper, and to call them by name. My old nurse I knew at once.
She had grown very grey since she heard the coffin fall in the
nursery fifteen years before, but her strange eyes were the same, and
the look in them woke all my old memories. She went over the house
with me.</p>

<p>"And how is the Woman of the Water?" I asked, trying to laugh a
little. "Does she still play in the moonlight?"</p>

<p>"She is hungry," answered the Welshwoman, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Hungry? Then we will feed her." I laughed. But old Judith turned
very pale, and looked at me strangely.</p>

<p>"Feed her? Ay--you will feed her well," she muttered, glancing
behind her at the ancient housekeeper, who tottered after us with
feeble steps through the halls and passages.</p>

<p>I did not think much of her words. She had always talked oddly, as
Welshwomen will, and though I was very melancholy I am sure I was not
superstitious, and I was certainly not timid. Only, as in a far-off
dream, I seemed to see her standing with the light in her hand and
muttering, "The heavy one--all of lead," and then leading a little
boy through the long corridors to see his father lying dead in a
great easy-chair before a smouldering fire. So we went over the
house, and I chose the rooms where I would live; and the servants I
had brought with me ordered and arranged everything, and I had no
more trouble. I did not care what they did, provided I was left in
peace, and was not expected to give directions; for I was more
listless than ever, owing to the effects of my illness at
college.</p>

<p>I dined in solitary state, and the melancholy grandeur of the vast
old dining-room pleased me. Then I went to the room I had selected
for my study, and sat down in a deep chair, under a bright light, to
think, or to let my thoughts meander through labyrinths of their own
choosing, utterly indifferent to the course they might take.</p>

<p>The tall windows of the room opened to the level of the ground
upon the terrace at the head of the garden. It was in the end of
July, and everything was open, for the weather was warm. As I sat
alone I heard the unceasing plash of the great fountains, and I fell
to thinking of the Woman of the Water. I rose, and went out into the
still night and sat down upon a seat on the terrace, between two
gigantic Italian flower-pots. The air was deliciously soft and sweet
with the smell of the flowers, and the garden was more congenial to
me than the house. Sad people always like running water and the sound
of it at night, though I cannot tell why. I sat and listened in the
gloom, for it was dark below, and the pale moon had not yet climbed
over the hills in front of me, though all the air above was light
with her rising beams. Slowly the white halo in the eastern sky
ascended in an arch above the wooded crests, making the outline of
the mountains more intensely black by contrast, as though the head of
some great white saint were rising from behind a screen in a vast
cathedral, throwing misty glories from below. I longed to see the
moon herself, and I tried to reckon the seconds before she must
appear. Then she sprang up quickly, and in a moment more hung round
and perfect in the sky. I gazed at her, and then at the floating
spray of the tall fountains, and down at the pools, where the
water-lilies were rocking softly in their sleep on the velvet surface
of the moonlit water. Just then a great swan floated out silently
into the midst of the basin, and wreathed his long neck, catching the
water in his broad bill, and scattering showers of diamonds around
him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I gazed, something came between me and the light. I
looked up instantly. Between me and the round disc of the moon rose a
luminous face of a woman, with great strange eyes, and a woman's
mouth, full and soft, but not smiling, hooded in black, staring at me
as I sat still upon my bench. She was close to me--so close that I
could have touched her with my hand. But I was transfixed and
helpless. She stood still for a moment, but her expression did not
change. Then she passed swiftly away, and my hair stood up on my
head, while the cold breeze from her white dress was wafted to my
temples as she moved. The moonlight, shining through the tossing
spray of the fountain, made traceries of shadow on the gleaming folds
of her garments. In an instant she was gone, and I was alone.</p>

<p>I was strangely shaken by the vision, and some time passed before
I could rise to my feet, for I was still weak from my illness, and
the sight I had seen would have startled any one. I did not reason
with myself, for I was certain that I had looked on the unearthly,
and no argument could have destroyed that belief. At last I got up
and stood unsteadily, gazing in the direction in which I thought the
face had gone; but there was nothing to be seen--nothing but the
broad paths, the tall, dark evergreen hedges, the tossing water of
the fountains and the smooth pool below. I fell back upon the seat
and recalled the face I had seen. Strange to say, now that the first
impression had passed, there was nothing startling in the
recollection; on the contrary, I felt that I was fascinated by the
face, and would give anything to see it again. I could retrace the
beautiful straight features, the long dark eyes and the wonderful
mouth, most exactly in my mind, and, when I had reconstructed every
detail from memory, I knew that the whole was beautiful, and that I
should love a woman with such a face.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether she is the Woman of the Water!" I said to
myself. Then rising once more I wandered down the garden, descending
one short flight of steps after another, from terrace to terrace by
the edge of the marble basins, through the shadow and through the
moonlight; and I crossed the water by the rustic bridge above the
artificial grotto, and climbed slowly up again to the highest terrace
by the other side. The air seemed sweeter, and I was very calm, so
that I think I smiled to myself as I walked, as though a new
happiness had come to me. The woman's face seemed always before me,
and the thought of it gave me an unwonted thrill of pleasure, unlike
anything I had ever felt before.</p>

<p>I turned, as I reached the house, and looked back upon the scene.
It had certainly changed in the short hour since I had come out, and
my mood had changed with it. Just like my luck, I thought, to fall in
love with a ghost! But in old times I would have sighed, and gone to
bed more sad than ever, at such a melancholy conclusion. Tonight I
felt happy, almost for the first time in my life. The gloomy old
study seemed cheerful when I went in. The old pictures on the walls
smiled at me, and I sat down in my deep chair with a new and
delightful sensation that I was not alone. The idea of having seen a
ghost, and of feeling much the better for it, was so absurd that I
laughed softly, as I took up one of the books I had brought with me
and began to read.</p>

<p>That impression did not wear off. I slept peacefully, and in the
morning I threw open my windows to the summer air, and looked down at
the garden, at the stretches of green and at the coloured flowerbeds,
at the circling swallows, and at the bright water.</p>

<p>"A man might make a paradise of this place," I exclaimed. "A man
and a woman together!"</p>

<p>From that day the old castle no longer seemed gloomy, and I think
I ceased to be sad; for some time, too, I began to take an interest
in the place, and to try and make it more alive. I avoided my old
Welsh nurse, lest she should damp my humour with some dismal
prophecy, and recall my old self by bringing back memories of my
dismal childhood. But what I thought of most was the ghostly figure I
had seen in the garden that first night after my arrival. I went out
every evening and wandered through the walks and paths; but, try as I
might, I did not see my vision again. At last, after many days, the
memory grew more faint, and my old moody nature gradually overcame
the temporary sense of lightness I had experienced.</p>

<p>The summer turned to autumn, and I grew restless. It began to
rain. The dampness pervaded the gardens, and the outer halls smelted
musty, like tombs; the grey sky oppressed me intolerably. I left the
place as it was and went abroad, determined to try anything which
might possibly make a second break in the monotonous melancholy from
which I suffered.</p>

<h3>Chapter ii</h3>

<p>MOST people would be struck by the utter insignificance of the
small events which, after the death of my parents, influenced my life
and made me unhappy. The gruesome forebodings of a Welsh nurse, which
chanced to be realised by an odd coincidence of events, should not
seem enough to change the nature of a child, and to direct the bent
of his character in after years. The little disappointments of
schoolboy life, and the somewhat less childish ones of an uneventful
and undistinguished academic career, should not have sufficed to turn
me out at one-and-twenty years of age a melancholic, listless idler.
Some weakness of my own character may have contributed to the result,
but in a greater degree it was due to my having a reputation for bad
luck. However, I will not try to analyse the causes of my state, for
I should satisfy nobody, least of all myself. Still less will I
attempt to explain why I felt a temporary revival of my spirits after
my adventure in the garden. It is certain that I was in love with the
face I had seen, and that I longed to see it again; that I gave up
all hope of a second visitation, grew more sad than ever, packed up
my traps, and finally went abroad. But in my dreams I went back to my
home, and it always appeared to me sunny and bright, as it had looked
on that summer's morning after I had seen the woman by the
fountain.</p>

<p>I went to Paris. I went further, and wandered about Germany. I
tried to amuse myself, and I failed miserably. With the aimless whims
of an idle and useless man, came all sorts of suggestions for good
resolutions. One day I made up my mind that I would go and bury
myself in a German university for a time, and live simply like a poor
student. I started with the intention of going to Leipzic, determined
to stay there until some event should direct my life or change my
humour, or make an end of me altogether. The express train stopped at
some station of which I did not know the name. It was dusk on a
winter's afternoon, and I peered through the thick glass from my
seat.</p>

<p>Suddenly another train came gliding in from the opposite
direction, and stopped alongside of ours. I looked at the carriage
which chanced to be abreast of mine, and idly read the black letters
painted on a white board swinging from the brass handrail:
"BERLIN-COLOGNE-PARIS." Then I looked up at the window above. I
started violently and the cold perspiration broke out upon my
forehead, In the dim light, not six feet from where I sat, I saw the
face of a woman, the face I loved, the straight, fine features, the
strange eyes, the wonderful mouth, the pale skin. Her head-dress was
a dark veil which seemed to be tied about her head and passed over
the shoulders under her chin. As I threw down the window and knelt on
the cushioned seat, leaning far out to get a better view, a long
whistle screamed through the station, followed by a quick series of
dull, clanking sounds; then there was a slight jerk, and my train
moved on. Luckily the window was narrow, being the one over the seat,
beside the door, or I believe I would have jumped out of it then and
there. In an instant the speed increased, and I was being carried
swiftly away in the opposite direction from the thing I loved.</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour I lay back in my place, stunned by the
suddenness of the apparition. At last one of the two other
passengers, a large and gorgeous captain of the White Konigsberg
Cuirassiers, civilly but firmly suggested that I might shut my
window, as the evening was cold. I did so, with an apology, and
relapsed into silence. The train ran swiftly on for a long time, and
it was already beginning to slacken speed before entering another
station when I roused myself, and made a sudden resolution. As the
carriage stopped before the brilliantly lighted platform, I seized my
belongings, saluted my fellow passengers, and got out, determined to
take the first express back to Paris.</p>

<p>This time the circumstances of the vision had been so natural that
it did not strike me that there was anything unreal about the face,
or about the woman to whom it belonged. I did not try to explain to
myself how the face, and the woman, could be travelling by a fast
train from Berlin to Paris on a winter's afternoon, when both were in
my mind indelibly associated with the moonlight and the fountains in
my own English home. I certainly would not have admitted that I had
been mistaken in the dusk, attributing to what I had seen a
resemblance to my former vision which did not really exist. There was
not the slightest doubt in my mind, and I was positively sure that I
had again seen the face I loved. I did not hesitate, and in a few
hours I was on my way back to Paris. I could not help reflecting on
my ill-luck. Wandering as I had been for many months, it might as
easily have chanced that I should be travelling in the same train
with that woman, instead of going the other way. But my luck was
destined to turn for a time.</p>

<p>I searched Paris for several days. I dined at the principal
hotels; I went to the theatres; I rode in the Bois de Boulogne in the
morning, and picked up an acquaintance, whom I forced to drive with
me in the afternoon. I went to mass at the Madeleine, and I attended
the services at the English Church. I hung about the Louvre and Notre
Dame. I went to Versailles. I spent hours in parading the Rue de
Rivoli, in the neighbourhood of Meurice's corner, where foreigners
pass and repass from morning till night. At last I received an
invitation to a reception at the English Embassy. I went, and I found
what I had sought so long.</p>

<p>There she was, sitting by an odd lady in grey satin and diamonds,
who had a wrinkled but kindly face and keen grey eyes that seemed to
take in everything they saw, with very little inclination to give
much in return. But I did not notice the chaperon. I saw only the
face that had haunted me for months, and in the excitement of the
moment I walked quickly towards the pair, forgetting such a trifle as
the necessity for an introduction.</p>

<p>She was far more beautiful than I had thought, but I never doubted
that it was she herself and no other. Vision or no vision before,
this was the reality, and I knew it. Twice her hair had been covered,
now at last I saw it, and the added beauty of its magnificence
glorified the whole woman. It was rich hair, fine and abundant,
golden, with deep ruddy tints in it like red bronze spun fine. There
was no ornament in it, not a rose, not a thread of 'gold, and I felt
that it needed nothing to enhance its splendour; no thing but her
pale face, her dark strange eyes, and her heavy eyebrows. I could see
that she was slender, too, but strong withal, as she sat there
quietly gazing at the moving scene in the midst of the brilliant
lights and the hum of perpetual conversation.</p>

<p>I recollected the detail of introduction in time, and turned aside
to look for my host. I found him at last. I begged him to present me
to the two ladies, pointing them out to him at the same time.</p>

<p>"Yes--uh--by all means--uh--" replied his Excellency, with a
pleasant smile. He evidently had no idea of my name, which was not to
be wondered at.</p>

<p>"I am Lord Cairngorm," I observed.</p>

<p>"Oh--by all means," answered the Ambassador, with the same
hospitable smile. "Yes--uh--the fact is, I must try and find out who
they are; such lots of people, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you will present me, I will try and find out for you,"
said I, laughing.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes--so kind of you--come along," said my host.</p>

<p>We threaded the crowd, and in a few minutes we stood before the
two ladies.</p>

<p>"'Lowmintrduce L'd Cairngorm," he said; then, adding quickly to
me, "come and dine tomorrow, won't you?" he glided away with his
pleasant smile, and disappeared in the crowd.</p>

<p>I sat down beside the beautiful girl, conscious that the eyes of
the duenna were upon me.</p>

<p>"I think we have been very near meeting before," I remarked, byway
of opening the conversation.</p>

<p>My companion turned her eyes full upon me with an air of enquiry.
She evidently did not recall my face, if she had ever seen me.</p>

<p>"Really--I cannot remember," she observed, in a low and musical
voice. "When?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, you came down from Berlin by the express, ten
days ago. I was going the other way, and our carriages stopped
opposite each other. I saw you at the window."</p>

<p>"Yes--we came that way, but I do not remember-" She hesitated.</p>

<p>"Secondly," I continued, "I was sitting alone in my garden last
summer--near the end of July-do you remember? You must have wandered
in there through the park; you came up to the house and looked at
me--"</p>

<p>"Was that you?" she asked, in evident surprise. Then she broke
into a laugh. "I told everybody I had seen a ghost; there had never
been any Cairngorms in the place since the memory of man. We left the
next day, and never heard that you had come there; indeed, I did not
know the castle belonged to you."</p>

<p>"Where were you staying?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Where? Why, with my aunt, where I always stay. She is your
neighbour, since it is you."</p>

<p>"I--beg your pardon--but then--is your aunt Lady Bluebell? I did
not quite catch--"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid. She is amazingly deaf. Yes. She is the relict of
my beloved uncle, the sixteenth or seventeenth Baron Bluebell--I
forget exactly how many of them there have been. And I--do you know
who I am?" She laughed, well knowing that I did not.</p>

<p>"No," I answered frankly. "I have not the least idea. I asked to
be introduced because I recognised you. Perhaps--perhaps you are a
Miss Bluebell?"</p>

<p>"Considering that you are a neighbour, I will tell you who I am,"
she answered. "No; I am of the tribe of Bluebells, but my name is
Lammas, and I have been given to understand that I was christened
Margaret. Being a floral family, they call me Daisy. A dreadful
American man once told me that my aunt was a Bluebell and that I was
a Harebell--with two l's and an e--because my hair is so thick. I
warn you, so that you may avoid making such a bad pun."</p>

<p>"Do I look like a man who makes puns?" I asked, being very
conscious of my melancholy face and sad looks.</p>

<p>Miss Lammas eyed me critically.</p>

<p>"No; you have a mournful temperament. I think I can trust you,"
she answered. "Do you think you could communicate to my aunt the fact
that you are a Cairngorm and a neighbour? I am sure she would like to
know."</p>

<p>I leaned towards the old lady, inflating my lungs for a yell. But
Miss Lammas stopped me.</p>

<p>"That is not of the slightest use," she remarked. "You can write
it on a bit of paper. She is utterly deaf."</p>

<p>"I have a pencil," I answered, "but I have no paper. Would my cuff
do, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" replied Miss Lacunas, with alacrity; "men often do
that."</p>

<p>I wrote on my cuff: "Miss Lammas wishes me to explain that I am
your neighbour, Cairngorm." Then I held out my arm before the old
lady's nose. She seemed perfectly accustomed to the proceeding, put
up her glasses, read the words, smiled, nodded, and addressed me in
the unearthly voice peculiar to people who hear nothing.</p>

<p>"I knew your grandfather very well," she said. Then she smiled and
nodded to me again, and to her niece, and relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>"It is all right," remarked Miss Lammas.</p>

<p>"Aunt Bluebell knows she is deaf, and does not say much, like the
parrot. You see, she knew your grandfather. How odd, that we should
be neighbours! Why have we never met before?"</p>

<p>"If you had told me you knew my grandfather when you appeared in
the garden, I should not have been in the least surprised," I
answered rather irrelevantly. "I really thought you were the ghost of
the old fountain. How in the world did you come there at that
hour?"</p>

<p>"We were a large party, and we went out for a walk. Then we
thought we should like to see what your park was like in the
moonlight, and so we trespassed. I got separated from the rest, and
came upon you by accident, just as I was admiring the extremely
ghostly look of your house, and wondering whether anybody would ever
come and live there again. It looks like the castle of Macbeth, or a
scene from the opera. Do you know anybody here?"</p>

<p>"Hardly a soul. Do you?"</p>

<p>"No. Aunt Bluebell said it was our duty to come. It is easy for
her to go out; she does not bear the burden of the conversation."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you find it a burden," said I. "Shall I go away?"</p>

<p>Miss Lammas looked at me with a sudden gravity in her beautiful
eyes, and there was a sort of hesitation about the lines of her full,
soft mouth.</p>

<p>"No," she said at last, quite simply, "don't go away. We may like
each other, if you stay a little longer--and we ought to because we
are neighbours in the country."</p>

<p>I suppose I ought to have thought Miss Lammas a very odd girl.
There is, indeed, a sort of freemasonry between people who discover
that they live near each other, and that they ought to have known
each other before. But there was a sort of unexpected frankness and
simplicity in the girl's amusing manner which would have struck any
one else as being singular, to say the least of it. To me, however,
it all seemed natural enough. I had dreamed of her face too long not
to be utterly happy when I met her at last, and could talk to her as
much as I pleased. To me, the man of ill luck in everything, the
whole meeting seemed too good to be true. I felt again that strange
sensation of lightness which I had experienced after I had seen her
face in the garden. The great rooms seemed brighter, life seemed
worth living; my sluggish, melancholy blood ran faster, and filled me
with a new sense of strength. I said to myself that without this
woman I was but an imperfect being, but that with her I could
accomplish everything to which I should set my hand. Like the great
Doctor, when he thought he had cheated Mephistopheles at last, I
could have cried aloud to the fleeting moment, Verweile dock du hist
so schon!</p>

<p>"Are you always gay?" I asked suddenly. "How happy you must
be!"</p>

<p>"The days would sometimes seem very long if I were gloomy," she
answered thoughtfully. "Yes, I think I find life very pleasant, and I
tell it so."</p>

<p>"How can you 'tell life' anything?" I enquired. "If I could catch
my life and talk to it, I would abuse it prodigiously, I assure
you."</p>

<p>"I dare say. You have a melancholy temper. You ought to live out
of doors, dig potatoes, make hay, shoot, hunt, tumble into ditches,
and come home muddy and hungry for dinner. It would be much better
for you than moping in your rook tower, and hating everything."</p>

<p>"It is rather lonely down there," I murmured apologetically,
feeling that Miss Lammas was quite right.</p>

<p>"Then marry, and quarrel with your wife," she laughed. "Anything
is better than being alone."</p>

<p>"I am a very peaceable person. I never quarrel with anybody. You
can try it. You will find it quite impossible."</p>

<p>"Will you let me try?" she asked, still smiling.</p>

<p>"By all means-especially if it is to be only a preliminary
canter," I answered rashly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she enquired, turning quickly upon me.</p>

<p>"Oh--nothing. You might try my paces with a view to quarrelling in
the future. I cannot imagine how you are going to do it. You will
have to resort to immediate and direct abuse."</p>

<p>"No. I will only say that if you do not like your life, it is your
own fault. How can a man of your age talk of being melancholy, or of
the hollowness of existence? Are you consumptive? Are you subject to
hereditary insanity? Are you deaf, like Aunt Bluebell? Are you poor,
like--lots of people? Have you been crossed in love? Have you lost
the world for a woman, or any particular woman for the sake of the
world? Are you feebleminded, a cripple, an outcast? Are
you--repulsively ugly?" She laughed again. "Is there any reason in
the world why you should not enjoy all you have got in life?"</p>

<p>"No. There is no reason whatever, except that I am dreadfully
unlucky, especially in small things."</p>

<p>"Then try big things, just for a change," suggested Miss Lammas.
"Try and get married, for instance, and see how it turns out."</p>

<p>"If it turned out badly, it would be rather serious."</p>

<p>"Not half so serious as it is to abuse everything unreasonably. If
abuse is your particular talent, abuse something that ought to be
abused. Abuse the Conservatives--or the Liberals--it does not matter
which, since they are always abusing each other. Make yourself felt
by other people. You will like it, if they don't. It will make a man
of you. Fill your mouth with pebbles, and howl at the sea, if you
cannot do anything else. It did Demosthenes no end of good, you know.
You will have the satisfaction of imitating a great man."</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Lammas, I think the list of innocent exercises you
propose--"</p>

<p>"Very well--if you don't care for that sort of thing, care for
some other sort of thing. Care for something, or hate something.
Don't be idle. Life is short, and though art may be long, plenty of
noise answers nearly as well."</p>

<p>"I do care for something--I mean somebody," I said.</p>

<p>"A woman? Then marry her. Don't hesitate."</p>

<p>"I do not know whether she would marry me," I replied. "I have
never asked her."</p>

<p>"Then ask her at once," answered Miss Lammas. "I shall die happy
if I feel I have persuaded a melancholy fellow-creature to rouse
himself to action. Ask her, by all means, and see what she says. If
she does not accept you at once, she may take you the next time.
Meanwhile, you will have entered for the race. If you lose, there are
the 'All-aged Trial Stakes,' and the 'Consolation Race.'"</p>

<p>"And plenty of selling races into the bargain. Shall I take you at
your word, Miss Lammas?"</p>

<p>"I hope you will," she answered.</p>

<p>"Since you yourself advise me, I will. Miss Lammas, will you do me
the honour to marry me?"</p>

<p>For the first time in my life the blood rushed to my head and my
sight swam. I cannot tell why I said it. It would be useless to try
to explain the extraordinary fascination the girl exercised over me,
or the still more extraordinary feeling of intimacy with her which
had grown in me during that half-hour. Lonely, sad, unlucky as I had
been all my life, I was certainly not timid, nor even shy. But to
propose to marry a woman after half an hour's acquaintance was a
piece of madness of which I never believed myself capable, and of
which I should never be capable again, could I be placed in the same
situation. It was as though my whole being had been changed in a
moment by magic--by the white magic of her nature brought into
contact with mine. The blood sank back to my heart, and a moment
later I found myself staring at her with anxious eyes. To my
amazement she was as calm as ever, but her beautiful mouth smiled,
and there was a mischievous light in her dark-brown eyes.</p>

<p>"Fairly caught," she answered. "For an individual who pretends to
be listless and sad you are not lacking in humour. I had really not
the least idea what you were going to say. Wouldn't it be singularly
awkward for you if I had said 'Yes'? I never saw anybody begin to
practice so sharply what was preached to him--with so very little
loss of time!"</p>

<p>"You probably never met a man who had dreamed of you for seven
months before being introduced."</p>

<p>"No, I never did," she answered gaily. "It smacks of the romantic.
Perhaps you are a romantic character after all. I should think you
were, if I believed you. Very well; you have taken my advice, entered
for a Stranger's Race and lost it. Try the All-aged Trial Stakes. You
have another cuff, and a pencil. Propose to Aunt Bluebell; she would
dance with astonishment, and she might recover her hearing."</p>

<h3>Chapter iii</h3>

<p>THAT was how I first asked Margaret Lammas to be my wife, and I
will agree with any one who says I behaved very foolishly. But I have
not repented of it, and I never shall. I have long ago understood
that I was out of my mind that evening, but I think my temporary
insanity on that occasion has had the effect of making me a saner man
ever since. Her manner turned my head, for it was so different from
what I had expected. To hear this lovely creature, who, in my
imagination, was a heroine of romance, if not of tragedy, talking
familiarly and laughing readily was more than my equanimity could
bear, and I lost my head as well as my heart. But when I went back to
England in the spring, I went to make certain arrangements at the
Castle--certain changes and improvements which would be absolutely
necessary. I had won the race for which I had entered myself so
rashly, and we were to be married in June.</p>

<p>Whether the change was due to the orders I had left with the
gardener and the rest of the servants, or to my own state of mind, I
cannot tell. At all events, the old place did not look the same to me
when I opened my window on the morning after my arrival. There were
the grey walls below me, and the grey turrets flanking the huge
building; there were the fountains, the marble causeways, the smooth
basins, the tall box hedges, the waterlilies and the swans, just as
of old. But there was something else there, too--something in the
air, in the water, and in the greenness that I did not recognise--a
light over everything by which everything was transfigured. The clock
in the tower struck seven, and the strokes of the ancient bell
sounded like a wedding chime. The air sang with the thrilling treble
of the song-birds, with the silvery music of the Flashing water, and
he softer harmony of the leaves stirred by the fresh morning wind.
There was a smell of new-mown hay from the distant meadows, and of
blooming roses from the beds below, wafted up together to my window.
I stood in the pure sunshine and drank the air and all the sounds and
the odours that were in it; and I looked down at my garden and said,
"It is Paradise, after all. I think the men of old were right when
they called heaven a garden, and Eden a garden inhabited by one man
and one woman, the Earthly Paradise."</p>

<p>I turned away, wondering what had become of the gloomy memories I
had always associated with my home. I tried to recall the impression
of my nurse's horrible prophecy before the death of my parents--an
impression which hitherto had been vivid enough. I tried to remember
my own self, my dejection, my listlessness, my bad luck, and my petty
disappointments. I endeavoured to force myself to think as I used to
think, if only to satisfy myself that I had not lost my
individuality. But I succeeded in none of these efforts. I was a
different man, a changed being, incapable of sorrow, of ill-luck, or
of sadness. My life had been a dream, not evil, but infinitely gloomy
and hopeless. It was now a reality, full of hope, gladness, and all
manner of good. My home had been like a tomb; to-day it was Paradise.
My heart had been as though it had not existed; to-day it beat with
strength and youth, and the certainty of realised happiness. I
revelled in the beauty of the world, and called loveliness out of the
future to enjoy it before time should bring it to me, as a traveller
in the plains looks up to the mountains, and already tastes the cool
air through the dust of the road.</p>

<p>Here, I thought, we will live and live for years. There we will
sit by the fountain towards evening and in the deep moonlight. Down
those paths we will wander together. On those benches we will rest
and talk. Among those eastern hills we will ride through the soft
twilight, and in the old house we will tell tales on winter nights,
when the logs burn high, and the holly berries are red, and the old
clock tolls out the dying year. On these old steps, in these dark
passages and stately rooms, there will one day be the sound of little
pattering feet, and laughing child-voices will ring up to the vaults
of the ancient hall. Those tiny footsteps shall not be slow and sad
as mine were, nor shall the childish words be spoken in an awed
whisper. No gloomy Welshwoman shall people the dusty corners with
weird horrors, nor utter horrid prophecies of death and ghastly
things. All shall be young, and fresh, and joyful, and happy, and we
will turn the old luck again, and forget that there was ever any
sadness.</p>

<p>So I thought, as I looked out of my window that morning and for
many mornings after that, and every day it all seemed more real than
ever before, and much nearer. But the old nurse looked at me askance,
and muttered odd sayings about the Woman of the Water. I cared little
what she said, for I was far too happy.</p>

<p>At last the time came near for the wedding. Lady Bluebell and all
the tribe of Bluebells, as Margaret called them, were at Bluebell
Grange, for we had determined to be married in the country, and to
come straight to the Castle afterwards. We cared little for
travelling, and not at all for a crowded ceremony at St. George's in
Hanover Square, with all the tiresome formalities afterwards. I used
to ride over to the Grange every day, and very often Margaret would
come with her aunt and some of her cousins to the Castle. I was
suspicious of my own taste, and was only too glad to let her have her
way about the alterations and improvements in our home.</p>

<p>We were to be married on the thirtieth of July, and on the evening
of the twenty-eighth Margaret drove over with some of the Bluebell
party. In the long summer twilight we all went out into the garden.
Naturally enough, Margaret and I were left to ourselves, and we
wandered down by the marble basins.</p>

<p>"It is an odd coincidence," I said; "it was on this very night
last year that I first saw you."</p>

<p>"Considering that it is the month of July," answered Margaret,
with a laugh, "and that we have been here almost every day, I don't
think the coincidence is so extraordinary, after all."</p>

<p>"No, dear," said I, "I suppose not. I don't know why it struck me.
We shall very likely be here a year from to-day, and a year from
that. The odd thing, when I think of it, is that you should be here
at all. But my luck has turned. I ought not to think anything odd
that happens now that I have you. It is all sure to be good."</p>

<p>"A slight change in your ideas since that remarkable performance
of yours in Paris," said Margaret. "Do you know, I thought you were
the most extraordinary man I had ever met."</p>

<p>"I thought you were the most charming woman I have ever seen. I
naturally did not want to lose any time in frivolities. I took you at
your word, I followed your advice, I asked you to marry me, and this
is the delightful result--what's the matter?"</p>

<p>Margaret had started suddenly, and her hand tightened on my arm.
An old woman was coming up the path, and was close to us before we
saw her, for the moon had risen, and was shining full in our faces.
The woman turned out to be my old nurse.</p>

<p>"It's only old Judith, dear, don't be frightened," I said. Then I
spoke to the Welshwoman: "What are you about, Judith? Have you been
feeding the Woman of the Water?"</p>

<p>"Ay--when the clock strikes, Willie--my lord, I mean," muttered
the odd creature, drawing aside to let us pass, and fixing her
strange eyes on Margaret's face.</p>

<p>"What does she mean?" asked Margaret, when we had gone by.</p>

<p>"Nothing, darling. The old thing is mildly crazy, but she is a
good soul."</p>

<p>We went on in silence for a few moments, and came to the rustic
bridge just above the artificial grotto through which the water ran
out into the park, dark and swift in its narrow channel. We stopped,
and leaned on the wooden rail. The moon was now behind us, and shone
full upon the long vista of basins and on the huge walls and towers
of the Castle above.</p>

<p>"How proud you ought to be of such a grand old place!" said
Margaret, softly.</p>

<p>"It is yours now, darling," I answered. "You have as good a right
to love it as I--but I only love it because you are to live in it,
dear."</p>

<p>Her hand stole out and lay on mine, and we were both silent. Just
then the clock began to strike far off in the tower. I counted the
strokes--eight-nine ten--eleven--I looked at my
watch--twelve--thirteen--I laughed. The bell went on striking.</p>

<p>"The old clock has gone crazy, like Judith," I exclaimed. Still it
went on, note after note ringing out monotonously through the still
air. We leaned over the rail, instinctively looking in the direction
whence the sound came. On and on it went. I counted nearly a hundred,
out of sheer curiosity, for I understood that something had broken
and that the thing was running itself down.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a crack as of breaking wood, a cry and a heavy
splash, and I was alone, clinging to the broken end of the rail of
the rustic bridge.</p>

<p>I do not think I hesitated while my pulse beat twice. I sprang
clear of the bridge into the black rushing water, dived to the
bottom, came up again with empty hands, turned and swam downwards
through the grotto in the thick darkness, plunging and diving at
every stroke, striking my head and hands against jagged stones and
sharp corners, clutching at last something in my fingers, and
dragging it up with all my might. I spoke, I cried aloud, but there
was no answer. I was alone in the pitchy blackness with my burden,
and the house was five hundred yards away. Struggling still, I felt
the ground beneath my feet, I saw a ray of moonlight--the grotto
widened, and the deep water became a broad and shallow brook as I
stumbled over the stones and at last laid Margaret's body on the bank
in the park beyond.</p>

<p>"Ay, Willie, as the clock struck!" said the voice of Judith, the
Welsh nurse, as she bent down and looked at the white face. The old
woman must have turned back and followed us, seen the accident, and
slipped out by the lower gate of the garden. "Ay," she groaned, "you
have fed the Woman of the Water this night, Willie, while the clock
was striking."</p>

<p>I scarcely heard her as I knelt beside the lifeless body of the
woman I loved, chafing the wet white temples, and gazing wildly into
the wide-staring eyes. I remember only the first returning look of
consciousness, the first heaving breath, the first movement of those
dear hands stretching out towards me.</p>

<p>That is not much of a story, you say. It is the story of my life.
That is all. It does not pretend to be anything else. Old Judith says
my luck turned on that summer's night, when I was struggling in the
water to save all that was worth living for. A month later there was
a stone bridge above the grotto, and Margaret and I stood on it, and
looked up at the moonlit Castle, as we had done once before, and as
we have done many times since. For all those things happened ten
years ago last summer, and this is the tenth Christmas Eve we have
spent together by the roaring logs in the old hall, talking of old
times; and every year there are more old times to talk of. There are
curly-headed boys, too, with red-gold hair and dark-brown eyes like
their mother's, and a little Margaret, with solemn black eyes like
mine. Why could she not look like her mother, too, as well as the
rest of them?</p>

<p>The world is very bright at this glorious Christmas time, and
perhaps there is little use in calling up the sadness of long ago,
unless it be to make the jolly firelight seem more cheerful, the good
wife's face look gladder, and to give the children's laughter a
merrier ring, by contrast with all that is gone. Perhaps, too, some
sad-faced, listless, melancholy youth, who feels that the world is
very hollow, and that life is like a perpetual funeral service, just
as I used to feel myself, may take courage from my example, and
having found the woman of his heart, ask her to marry him after half
an hour's acquaintance. But, on the whole, I would not advise any man
to marry, for the simple reason that no man will ever find a wife
like mine, and being obliged to go further, he will necessarily fare
worse. My wife has done miracles, but I will not assert that any
other woman is able to follow' her example.</p>

<p>Margaret always said that the odd place was beautiful, and that I
ought to be proud of it. I dare say she is right. She has even more
imagination than I. But I have a good answer and a plain one, which
is this--that all the beauty of the Castle comes from her. She has
breathed upon it all, as the children blow upon the cold glass
window-panes in winter; and as their warm breath crystallises into
landscapes from fairyland, full of exquisite shapes and traceries
upon the blank surface, so her spirit has transformed every grey
stone of the old towers, every ancient tree and hedge in the gardens,
every thought in my once melancholy self. All that was old is young,
and all that was sad is glad, and I am the gladdest of all. Whatever
heaven may be, there is no earthly paradise without woman, nor is
there anywhere a place so desolate, so dreary, so unutterably
miserable that a woman cannot make it seem heaven to the man she
loves, and who loves her.</p>

<p>I hear certain cynics laugh, and cry that all that has been said
before. Do not laugh, my good cynic. You are too small a man to laugh
at such a great thing as love. Prayers have been said before now by
many, and perhaps you say yours, too. I do not think they lose
anything by being repeated, nor you by repeating them. You say that
the world is bitter, and full of the Waters of Bitterness. Love, and
so live that you may be loved--the world will turn sweet for you, and
you shall rest like me by the Waters of Paradise.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7"></a>The Doll's Ghost</h2>

<p>IT was a terrible accident, and for one moment the splendid
machinery of Cranston House got out of gear and stood still. The
butler emerged from the retirement in which he spent his elegant
leisure. Two grooms of the chambers appeared simultaneously from
opposite directions. There were actually housemaids on the grand
staircase, and those who remember the facts most exactly assert that
Mrs. Pringle herself positively stood upon the landing. Mrs. Pringle
was the housekeeper.</p>

<p>As for the head nurse, the undernurse, and the nursery maid, their
feelings cannot be described. The head nurse laid one hand upon the
polished marble balustrade and stared stupidly before her. The
undernurse stood rigid and pale, leaning against the polished marble
wall while the nursery maid collapsed and sat down upon the polished
marble step--just beyond the limits of the velvet carpet--and burst
into tears.</p>

<p>The Lady Gwendolen Lancaster-Douglas-Scroop, youngest daughter of
the ninth Duke of Cranston--of the age of six years and three
months--picked herself up quite alone, and sat down on the third step
from the foot of the grand staircase in Cranston House.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the butler before he disappeared again.</p>

<p>"Ah!" responded the grooms of the chambers, as they also went
away.</p>

<p>"It's only that doll," Mrs. Pringle was distinctly heard to say,
in a tone of contempt.</p>

<p>The undernurse heard her say it. Then the three nurses gathered
round Lady Gwendolen and patted her, gave her unhealthy things out of
their pockets, and hurried her out of Cranston House as fast as they
could, lest it should be found out upstairs that they had allowed the
Lady Gwendolen Lancaster-Douglas-Scroop to tumble down the grand
staircase with her doll in her arms. And as the doll was badly
broken, the nursery-maid carried it, and the pieces, wrapped up in
Lady Gwendolen's little cloak. It was not far to Hyde Park, and when
they had reached a quiet place they took means to find out that Lady
Gwendolen had no bruises--for the carpet was very thick and soft, and
there was thick stuff under it to make it softer.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolen Douglas-Scroop sometimes yelled, but she never
cried. It was because she had yelled that the nurse had allowed her
to go downstairs alone, with Nina the doll under one arm, steadying
herself with her other hand on the balustrade as she trod upon the
polished marble steps beyond the edge of the carpet. So she had
fallen, and Nina had come to grief.</p>

<p>When the nurses were quite sure that she was not hurt, they
unwrapped the doll and looked at her in her turn. She had been a very
beautiful doll, very large, and fair, and healthy. She had real
yellow hair and eyelids that would open and shut over very grown-up
dark eyes. Moreover, when you moved her right arm up and down, she
said "Pa-pa," and when you moved the left, she said "Ma-ma," very
distinctly.</p>

<p>"I heard her say 'Pa' when she fell," said the undernurse, who
heard everything. "But she ought to have said 'Pa-pa.'"</p>

<p>"That's because her arm went up when she hit the step," said the
head nurse. "She'll say the other 'Pa' when I put it down again."</p>

<p>"Pa," said Nina, as her right arm was pushed down. She spoke
through a face that was cracked, with a hideous gash, from the upper
corner of the forehead, through the nose, and down to the little
frilled collar of the pale green silk Mother Hubbard frock--where two
little three-cornered pieces of porcelain had fallen out. "I'm sure
it's a wonder she can speak at all, being all smashed," said the
undernurse.</p>

<p>"You'll have to take her to Mr. Puckler," said her superior. "It's
not far, and you'd better go at once."</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolen was occupied with digging a hole in the ground with
a little spade, and paid no attention to the nurses.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" inquired the nursery maid, looking on.</p>

<p>"Nina's dead, and I'm diggin' her a grave," replied her ladyship
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll come to life again all right," said the nursery
maid.</p>

<p>The undernurse wrapped Nina up again and departed. Fortunately a
kind soldier, with very long legs and a very small cap, happened to
be there; and as he had nothing to do, he offered to see the
undernurse safely to Mr. Puckler's and back.</p>

<p>Mr. Bernard Puckler and his little daughter lived in a little
house in a little alley, which led out off a quiet little street not
very far from Belgrave Square. He was the great doll doctor whose
extensive practice lay in the most aristocratic quarter. He mended
dolls of all sizes and ages, boy dolls and girl dolls, baby dolls in
long clothes, grown-up dolls in fashionable gowns. He repaired
talking dolls and dumb dolls, dolls that shut their eyes when they
lay down, and those whose eyes had to be shut for them by means of a
mysterious wire. His daughter Else was only twelve years old, but she
was already very clever at mending dolls' clothes and at doing their
hair--which is harder than you might think, though the dolls sit
quite still while it is being done.</p>

<p>Mr. Puckler had originally been a German, but he had dissolved his
nationality in the ocean of London many years ago, like a great many
foreigners. He still had one or two German friends, however, who came
on Saturday evenings to smoke with him and play picquet or "skat" for
farthing points. They called him "Herr Doctor," which seemed to
please Mr. Puckler very much.</p>

<p>He looked older than he was, for his beard was rather long and
ragged, his hair was grizzled and thin, and he wore horn-rimmed
spectacles. As for Else, she was a thin, pale child--very quiet and
neat--with dark eyes and brown hair that was plaited down her back
and tied with a bit of black ribbon. She mended the dolls' clothes
and took the dolls back to their homes when they were strong
again.</p>

<p>The house was a little one, but too big for the two people who
lived in it. There was a small sitting room facing the street, three
rooms upstairs, and the workshop was at the back. But the father and
daughter lived most of their time in the workshop, because they were
generally at work, even in the evenings.</p>

<p>Mr. Puckler laid Nina on the table and looked at her a long
time--until the tears began to fill his eyes behind the horn-rimmed
spectacles. He was a very sensitive man who often fell in love with
the dolls he mended, and who found it hard to part with them when
they had smiled at him for a few days. They were real little people
to him, with characters and thoughts and feelings of their own and he
was very tender with them all. But some attracted him especially from
the first, and when they were brought to him maimed and injured,
their state seemed so pitiful to him that the tears came easily. You
must remember that he had lived among dolls during a great part of
his life, and understood them.</p>

<p>"How do you know that they feel nothing?" he went on to say to
Else. "You must be gentle with them. It costs nothing to be kind to
the little beings, and perhaps it makes a difference to them."</p>

<p>And Else understood him, because she was a child, and she knew
that she was more to him than all the dolls.</p>

<p>He fell in love with Nina at first sight, perhaps because her
beautiful brown glass eyes were something like Else's, and he loved
Else first and best, with all his heart. And, besides, it was a very
sorrowful case.</p>

<p>Nina had not been long in the world. Her complexion was perfect,
her hair was smooth where it should be smooth, curly where it should
be curly, and her silk clothes were perfectly new. But across her
face was that frightful gash, like a sabre cut, deep and shadowy
within, but clean and sharp at the edges. When he tenderly pressed
her head to close the gaping wound, the edges made a fine grating
sound that was painful to hear, and the lids of the dark eyes
quivered and trembled as though Nina were suffering dreadfully.</p>

<p>"Poor Nina!" he exclaimed sorrowfully. "I shall not hurt you much,
but you will take a long time to get strong."</p>

<p>He always asked the names of the broken dolls when they were
brought to him. Sometimes the people knew what the children called
them, and told him. He liked "Nina" for a name. Altogether and in
every way she pleased him more than any doll he had seen for many
years, and he felt drawn to her. He made up his mind to make her
perfectly strong and sound, no matter how much labor it might cost
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Puckler worked patiently a little at a time while Else watched
him. She could do nothing for poor Nina, whose clothes needed no
mending. The longer the doll doctor worked, the more fond he became
of the yellow hair and the beautiful brown glass eyes. He sometimes
forgot all the other dolls that were waiting to be mended, lying side
by side on a shelf, and sat for an hour gazing at Nina's face while
he racked his ingenuity for some new invention by which to hide even
the smallest trace of the terrible accident.</p>

<p>Eventually she was wonderfully mended. Even he was obliged to
admit that. All the conditions had been most favorable for a cure,
since the cement had set quite hard at the first attempt and the
weather had been fine and dry, which makes a great difference in a
dolls' hospital. But the scar--a very fine line right across the
face, downwards from right to left--was still visible to his keen
eyes.</p>

<p>At last he knew that he could do no more, and the undernurse had
already come twice to see whether the job was finished, as she
coarsely expressed it.</p>

<p>"Nina is not quite strong yet," Mr. Puckler had answered each
time, for he could not make up his mind to face the parting.</p>

<p>And-now he sat before the square table at which he worked. Nina
lay before him for the last time with a big brown paper box beside
her. It stood there like her coffin, waiting for her, he thought. At
the thought of placing her into it, laying tissue paper over her dear
face, putting on the lid, and tying the string, his sight was dim
with tears again. He was never to look into the glassy depths of the
beautiful brown eyes anymore nor to hear the little wooden voice say
"Pa-pa" and "Ma-ma." It was a very painful moment.</p>

<p>In the vain hope of gaining time before the separation, he took up
the little sticky bottles of cement, glue, gum and colour, looking at
each one in turn, and then at Nina's face. And all his small tools
lay there, neatly arranged in a row, but he knew that he could not
use them again for Nina. She was quite strong at last, and in a
country where there should be no cruel children to hurt her, she
might live a hundred years with only that almost imperceptible line
across her face to tell of the fearful thing that had befallen her on
the marble steps of Cranston House.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Puckler's heart was quite full, and he rose abruptly
from his seat and turned away.</p>

<p>"Else," he said unsteadily, "you must do it for me. I cannot bear
to see her go into the box." So he went and stood at the window with
his back turned, while Else did what he had not the heart to do.</p>

<p>"Is it done?" he asked, not turning round. "Then take her away, my
dear. Put on your hat, and take her to Cranston House quickly. When
you are gone I will turn round."</p>

<p>Else was used to her father's queer ways with the dolls, and
though she had never seen him so much moved by a parting, she was not
much surprised.</p>

<p>"Come back quickly," he said, when he heard her hand on the latch.
"It is growing late. I should not send you at this hour. But I cannot
bear to look forward to it any more."</p>

<p>When Else was gone, he left the window and sat down in his place
before the table again, to wait for the child to come back. He
touched the place where Nina had lain, very gently, and he recalled
the softly tinted pink face, the glass eyes, and the ringlets of
yellow hair, till he could almost see them.</p>

<p>The evenings were long, for it was late in the spring, but it
began to grow dark soon and Else had not come back. She had been gone
an hour and a half, much longer than he had expected, for it was
barely half a mile from Belgrave Square to Cranston House. He
reasoned that the child might have been kept waiting, but as the
twilight deepened he grew anxious and walked up and down in the dim
workshop, no longer thinking of Nina, but of Else, his own living
child, whom he loved.</p>

<p>An undefinable, disquieting sensation came upon him by fine
degrees, a chilliness and a faint stirring of his thin hair, joined
with a wish to be in any company rather than to be alone much longer.
It was the beginning of fear.</p>

<p>He told himself in strong German-English that he was a foolish old
man and began to feel about for the matches in the dusk. He knew just
where they should be, for he always kept them in the same place,
close to the little tin box that held bits of sealing wax of various
colours for some kinds of mending. But somehow he could not find the
matches in the gloom.</p>

<p>Something had happened to Else, he was sure. As his fear
increased, he felt as though it might be allayed if he could get a
light and see what time it was. He called himself a foolish old man
again and the sound of his own voice startled him in the dark. He
could not find the matches.</p>

<p>The window was grey. Still, he thought he might see what time it
was if he went close to it. He could go and get matches out of the
cupboard afterwards. He stood back from the table, to get out of the
way of the chair, and began to cross the board floor.</p>

<p>He stopped. Something was following him in the dark. There was a
small pattering, as of tiny feet, upon the boards. He stopped and
listened as the roots of his hair tingled. It was nothing. He was a
foolish old man he thought. Then he made two steps more and he was
sure that he heard the little pattering again. He turned his back to
the window, leaning against the sash until the panes began to crack,
and he faced the dark. Everything was quite still and it smelt of
paste and cement and wood filings as usual.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Else?" he asked, and he was surprised by the fear in
his voice.</p>

<p>There was no answer in the room, and he held up his watch and
tried to make out what time it was by the grey dusk that was just not
quite darkness. So far as he could see, it was within two or three
minutes often o'clock. He had been a long time alone. He was shocked,
and frightened for Else, out in London so late. He ran across the
room to the door and as he fumbled for the latch, he distinctly heard
the running of little feet after him.</p>

<p>"Mice!" he exclaimed feebly, just as he got the door open. He shut
it quickly behind him, feeling as though some cold thing had settled
on his back and was writhing upon him. The passage was quite dark,
but he found his hat and was out in the alley in a moment--breathing
more freely--and surprised to find how much light there still was in
the open air. He could see the pavement clearly under his feet, and
far off in the street to which the alley led, he could hear the
laughter and calls of children playing some game out of doors. He
wondered how he could have been so nervous and for an instant he
thought of going back into the house to wait quietly for Else, but
instantly he felt that nervous fright of something stealing over him
again. In any case it was better to walk up to Cranston House and ask
the servants about the child. One of the women had perhaps taken a
fancy to her, and was even now giving her tea and cake.</p>

<p>He walked quickly to Belgrave Square, and then up the broad
streets, listening as he went--whenever there was no other sound--for
the tiny footsteps. But he heard nothing and was laughing at himself
when he rang the servants' bell at the big house. Of course, the
child must be there.</p>

<p>The person who opened the door was quite an inferior person, for
it was a back door, but affected the manners of the front while
staring superciliously at Mr. Puckler under the strong light. "No
little girl had been seen," he said and he knew "nothing about no
dolls."</p>

<p>"She is my little girl," said Mr. Puckler tremulously, for all his
anxiety was returning tenfold, "and I am afraid something has
happened."</p>

<p>The inferior person said rudely that "nothing could have happened
to her in that house, because she had not been there." Mr. Puckler
was obliged to admit that the man ought to know, as it was his
business to keep the door and let people in, still he wished to be
allowed to speak to the undernurse, who knew him. But the man was
ruder than ever, and finally shut the door in his face.</p>

<p>When the doll doctor was alone in the street, he steadied himself
by the railing, for he felt as though he were breaking in two--just
as some dolls break--in the middle of the backbone.</p>

<p>Presently he knew that he must be doing something to find Else,
and that gave him strength. He began to walk as quickly as he could
through the streets, following every highway and byway which his
little girl might have taken on her errand. He also asked several
policemen in vain if they had seen her. Most of them answered him
kindly, for they saw that he was a sober man, in his right senses,
and some of them had little girls of their own.</p>

<p>It was one o'clock in the morning when he returned to his own
door, worn out, hopeless and broken-hearted. As he turned the key in
the lock, his heart stood still, for he knew that he was awake and
had not been dreaming. He had really heard those tiny footsteps
pattering to meet him inside the house along the passage. But he was
too unhappy to be much frightened any more, and his heart was a dull
regular pain, that found its way all through him with every pulse.
Sadly he went in, hung up his hat in the dark, and found the matches
in the cupboard and the candlestick in its place in the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. Puckler was so overcome and so completely worn out that he sat
down in his chair before the work table and almost fainted; his face
dropped forward upon his folded hands. Beside him the solitary candle
burned steadily with a low flame in the still warm air.</p>

<p>"Else! Else!" he moaned against his yellow knuckles. It was all he
could say, but it was of no relief to him. On the contrary, the very
sound of her name was a new and sharp pain that pierced his ears and
his head and his very soul. For every time he repeated her name it
meant that little Else was dead, somewhere out in the streets of
London in the dark.</p>

<p>He was so terribly hurt that he did not even feel something
pulling gently at the skirt of his old coat, so gently that it was
like the nibbling of a tiny mouse. He might have thought that it was
really a mouse if he had noticed it.</p>

<p>"Else! Else!" he groaned against his hands. Then a cool breath
stirred his thin hair and the low flame of the one candle dropped
down almost to a mere spark, not flickering as though a draught were
going to blow it out, but just dropping down as if it were tired out.
Mr. Puckler felt his hands stiffening with fright. Then he heard a
faint rustling sound, like some small silk thing blown in a gentle
breeze. He sat up straight, stark and scared, as a small wooden voice
spoke in the stillness.</p>

<p>"Pa-pa," it said, with a break between the syllables.</p>

<p>Mr. Puckler stood up in a single jump. His chair fell over
backwards with a smashing noise upon the wooden floor. The candle had
almost gone out.</p>

<p>It was Nina's doll voice that had spoken. He would have known it
among the voices of a hundred other dolls, yet there was something
more in it, a little human ring with a pitiful cry, a call for help,
and the wail of a hurt child. Mr. Puckler stood up, stark and stiff,
and tried to look round, but at first he could not, for he seemed to
be frozen from head to foot.</p>

<p>He made a great effort and raised one hand to each of his temples
to press his own head around as he would have turned a doll's. The
candle was burning so low that it might as well have been out
altogether. The room seemed quite dark at first, then he saw
something. He would not have believed that he could be more
frightened than he had been just before, but he was. His knees shook,
for he saw Nina the doll, standing in the middle of the floor. She
was shining with a faint and ghostly radiance. Her beautiful glassy
brown eyes fixed on his. And across her face the very thin line of
the break he had mended shone as though it were drawn in light with a
fine point of white flame.</p>

<p>But there was something more in the eyes, something human, like
Else's, but as if only the doll saw him through them, and not Else.
Still there was enough of Else to bring back all his pain and to make
him forget his fear.</p>

<p>"Else! my little Else!" he cried aloud.</p>

<p>The small ghost moved. Its doll arm slowly rose and fell with a
stiff, mechanical motion. "Pa-pa," it said.</p>

<p>It seemed this time that there was even more of Else's tone
echoing somewhere between the wooden notes that reached his ears so
distinctly, and yet so far away. Else was calling him, he was
sure.</p>

<p>His face was perfectly white in the gloom, but his knees did not
shake any more. He felt that he was less frightened.</p>

<p>"Yes, child! But where? Where?" he asked. "Where are you,
Else?"</p>

<p>"Pa-pa!"</p>

<p>The syllables died away in the quiet room. There was a low
rustling of silk, the glassy brown eyes turned slowly away, and Mr.
Puckler heard the pitter-patter of the small feet in the bronze kid
slippers as the figure ran straight to the door. The candle burned
high again. The room was full of light, and he was alone.</p>

<p>Mr. Puckler passed his hand over his eyes and looked about him. He
could see everything quite clearly and he felt that he must have been
dreaming, though he was standing instead of sitting down, as he
should have been if he had just awakened. The candle burned brightly
now. There on the shelf were the dolls to be mended, lying in a row
with their toes up. The third one had lost her right shoe, and Else
had been making a new one.</p>

<p>He knew that. He certainly was not dreaming now. And he had not
been dreaming when he had come in from his fruitless search and had
heard the doll's footsteps running to the door. He had not fallen
asleep in his chair. How could he possibly have fallen asleep when
his heart was breaking? He had been awake all the time.</p>

<p>He steadied himself, set the fallen chair upon its legs, and said
to himself again, very emphatically, that he was a foolish old man.
He ought to be out in the streets looking for his child, asking
questions, and inquiring at the police stations where all accidents
were reported as soon as they were known, or at the hospitals.</p>

<p>"Pa-pa!"</p>

<p>The longing, wailing, pitiful little wooden cry rang from the
passage outside the door. Mr. Puckler stood for an instant, his white
face transfixed and rooted to the spot. A moment later his hand was
on the latch. Then he was in the passage, with the light streaming
from the open door behind him.</p>

<p>Quite at the other end he saw the little phantom shining clearly
in the shadow. The right hand seemed to beckon to him as it rose and
fell once more. He knew all at once that it had not come to frighten
him but to lead him. When it disappeared and he walked boldly towards
the door, he knew that it was in the street outside waiting for him.
He forgot that he was tired and had eaten no supper, and had walked
many miles, for a sudden hope ran through him, like a golden stream
of life.</p>

<p>And sure enough, at the corner of the alley, at the corner of the
street, and out in Belgrave Square, he saw the small ghost flitting
before him. Sometimes it was only a shadow, where there was other
light, but then the glare of the lamps made a pale green sheen on its
little Mother Hubbard frock of silk; and sometimes, where the streets
were dark and silent, the whole figure shone out brightly with its
yellow curls and rosy neck. It seemed to trot along like a tiny
child. Mr. Puckler could almost hear the pattering of the bronze kid
slippers on the pavement as it ran. It went so very fast that he
could only just keep up with it, tearing along with his hat on the
back of his head and his thin hair blown by the night breeze; his
horn-rimmed spectacles firmly set upon his broad nose.</p>

<p>On and on he went with no idea where he was. He did not even care,
for he knew certainly that he was going the right way. Then at last,
in a wide, quiet street, he was standing before a big, sober-looking
door that had two lamps on each side of it, and a polished brass
bellhandle, which he pulled.</p>

<p>Just inside, when the door was opened, in the bright light, there
was the pale green sheen of the little silk dress, and once more the
small cry came to his ears, less pitiful, more longing.</p>

<p>"Pa-pa!"</p>

<p>The shadow turned suddenly bright, and out of the brightness the
beautiful brown glass eyes were turned up happily to his, while the
rosy mouth smiled so divinely that the phantom doll looked almost
like a little angel.</p>

<p>"A little girl was brought in soon after ten o'clock," said the
quiet voice of the hospital doorkeeper. "I think they thought she was
only stunned. She was holding a big brown paper box against her, they
could not get it out of her arms, and she had a long plait of brown
hair that hung down as they carried her."</p>

<p>"She is my little girl," said Mr. Puckler, but he hardly heard his
own voice.</p>

<p>He leaned over Else's face in the gentle light of the children's
ward, and when he had stood there a minute the beautiful brown eyes
opened and looked up to his.</p>

<p>"Pa-pa!" cried Else, softly, "I knew you would come!"</p>

<p>Mr. Puckler did not know what he did or said for a moment and what
he felt was worth all the fear and terror and despair that had almost
killed him that night. But by and by Else was telling her story, and
the nurse let her speak, for there were only two other children in
the room, who were getting well and were sound asleep.</p>

<p>"They were big boys with bad faces," said Else, "and they tried to
get Nina away from me, but I held on and fought as well as I could
till one of them hit me with something. I don't remember any more,
for I tumbled down. I suppose the boys ran away and somebody found me
there, but I'm afraid Nina is all smashed."</p>

<p>"Here is the box," said the nurse. "We could not take it out of
her arms till she came to herself. Would you like to see if the doll
is broken?"</p>

<p>She undid the string quickly. There Nina lay, all smashed to
pieces, but the gentle light of the children's ward made a pale green
sheen in the folds of her little Mother Hubbard frock.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8"></a>The King's Messenger</h2>

<p>It was a rather dim daylight dinner I remember that quite
distinctly, for I could see the glow of the sunset over the trees in
the park, through the high window at the west end of the dining-room.
I had expected to find a larger party, I believe, for I recollect
being a little surprised at seeing only a dozen people assembled at
table. It seemed to me that in old times, ever so long ago, when I
had last stayed in that house, there had been as many as thirty or
forty guests. I recognized some of them among a number of beautiful
portraits that hung on the walls. There was room for a great many
because there was only one huge window, at one end, and one large
door at the other. I was very much surprised, too, to see a portrait
of myself, evidently painted about twenty years ago by Lenbach. It
seemed very strange that I should have so completely forgotten the
picture, and that I should not be able to remember having sat for it.
We were good friends, it is true, and he might have painted it from
memory, without my knowledge, but it was certainly strange that he
should never have told me about it. The portraits that hung in the
dining-room were all very good indeed and all, I should say, by the
best painters of that time.</p>

<p>My left-hand neighbor was a lovely young girl whose name I had
forgotten, though I had known her long, and I fancied that she looked
a little disappointed when she saw that I was beside her. On my right
there was a vacant seat, and beyond it sat an elderly woman with
features as hard as the overwhelmingly splendid diamonds she wore.
Her eyes made me think of grey glass marbles cemented into a stone
mask. It was odd that her name should have escaped me, too, for I had
often met her.</p>

<p>The table looked irregular, and I counted the guests mechanically
while I ate my soup. We were only twelve, but the empty chair beside
me was the thirteenth place.</p>

<p>I suppose it was not very tactful of me to mention this, but I
wanted to say something to the beautiful girl on my left, and no
other subject for a general remark suggested itself. Just as I was
going to speak I remembered who she was.</p>

<p>"Miss Lorna," I said, to attract her attention, for she was
looking away from me toward the door. "I hope you are not
superstitious about there being thirteen at table, are you?"</p>

<p>"We are only twelve," she said, in the sweetest voice in the
world.</p>

<p>"Yes; but some one else is coming. There's an empty chair here
beside me."</p>

<p>"Oh, he doesn't count," said Miss Lorna quietly. "At least, not
for everybody. When did you get here? Just in time for dinner, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered. "I'm in luck to be beside you. It seems an age
since we were last here together."</p>

<p>"It does indeed," Miss Lorna sighed and looked at the pictures on
the opposite wall. "I've lived a lifetime since I saw you last."</p>

<p>I smiled at the exaggeration. "When you are thirty, you won't talk
of having your life behind you, I said.</p>

<p>"I shall never be thirty," Miss Lorna answered, with such an odd
little air of conviction that I did not think of anything to say.
"Besides, life isn't made up of years or months or hours, or of
anything that has to do with time," she continued. "You ought to know
that. Our bodies are something better than mere clocks, wound up to
show just how old we are at every moment, by our hair turning grey
and our teeth falling out and our faces getting wrinkled and yellow,
or puffy and red. Look at your own portrait over there. I don't mind
saying that you must have been twenty years younger when that was
painted, but I'm sure you are just the same man today, improved by
age, perhaps."</p>

<p>I heard a sweet little echoing laugh that seemed very far away;
and indeed I could not have sworn that it rippled from Miss Lorna's
beautiful lips, for though they were parted and smiling, my
impression is that they did not move, even as little as most women's
lips are moved by laughter.</p>

<p>"Thank you for thinking me improved," I said. "I find you a little
changed, too. I was just going to say that you seem sadder, but you
laughed just then."</p>

<p>"Did I? I suppose that's the right thing to do when the play is
over, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"If it has been an amusing play," I answered, humoring her.</p>

<p>The wonderful violet eyes turned to me, full of light. "It's not
been a bad play. I don't complain."</p>

<p>"Why do you speak of it as over?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, because I'm sure you will keep my secret. You
will, won't you? We were always such good friends, you and I, even
two years ago when I was young and silly. Will you promise not to
tell anyone till I'm gone?"</p>

<p>"Gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Will you promise?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will. But..." I did not finish the sentence, because
Miss Lorna bent nearer to me, so as to speak in a much lower tone.
While I listened, I felt her sweet young breath on my cheek. "I'm
going away tonight with the man who is to sit at your other side,"
she said. "He's a little late; he often is, for he is tremendously
busy; but he'll come presently, and after dinner we shall just stroll
out into the garden and never come back. That's my secret. You won't
betray me, will you?" Again, as she looked at me, I heard that
far-off silver laugh, sweet and low--I was almost too much surprise
by what she had told me to notice how still her parted lips were, but
that comes back to me now, with many other details.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Lorna," I said, "do think of your parents before
taking such a step."</p>

<p>"I have thought of them," she answered. "Of course they would
never consent, and I am very sorry to leave them, but it can't be
helped."</p>

<p>At this moment, as often happens when two people are talking in
low tones at a large dinner-table, there was a momentary lull in the
general conversation, and I was spared the trouble of making any
further answer to what Miss Lorna had told me so unexpectedly, and
with such profound confidence in my discretion.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, she would very probably not have listened,
whether my words expressed sympathy or protest, for she had turned
suddenly pale, and her eyes were wide and dark. The lull in the talk
at table was due to the appearance of the man who was to occupy the
vacant place beside me.</p>

<p>He had entered the room very quietly, and he made no elaborate
apology for being late, as he sat down, bending his head courteously
to our hostess and her husband, and smiling in a gentle sort of way
as he nodded to the others.</p>

<p>"Please forgive me," he said quietly. "I was detained by a funeral
and missed the train."</p>

<p>It was not until he had taken his place that he looked across me
at Miss Lorna and exchanged a glance of recognition with her. I
noticed that the lady with the hard face and the splendid diamonds,
who was at his other side, drew away from him a little, as if not
wishing even to let his sleeve brush against her bare arm. It
occurred to me at the same time that Miss Lorna must be wishing me
anywhere else than between her and the man with whom she was just
about to run away, and I wished for their sake and mine that I could
change places with him. He was certainly not like other men, and
though few people would have called him handsome there was something
about him that instantly fixed the attention; rarely beautiful though
Miss Lorna was, almost everyone would have noticed him first on
entering the room, and most people, I think, would have been more
interested by his face than by hers. I could well imagine that some
women might love him, even to distraction, though it was just as easy
to understand that others might be strongly repelled by him, and
might even fear him.</p>

<p>For my part, I shall not try to describe him as one describes an
ordinary man, with a dozen or so adjectives that leave nothing to the
imagination but yet offer it no picture that it can grasp. My
instinct was to fear him rather than think of him as a possible
friend, but I could not help feeling instant admiration for him, as
one does at first sight for anything that is very complete,
harmonious, and strong. He was dark, and pale with a shadowy pallor I
never saw in any other face; the features of thrice-great Hermes were
not modeled in more perfect symmetry, his luminous eyes were not
unkind, but there was something fateful in them, and they were set
very deep under the grand white brow. His age I could not guess, but
I should have called him young; standing, I had seen that he was tall
and sinewy, and now that he was seated, he had the unmistakable look
of a man accustomed to be in authority, to be heard and to be obeyed.
His hands were white, his fingers straight, lean, and very
strong.</p>

<p>Everyone at the table seemed to know him, but as often happens
among civilized people no one called him by name in speaking to
him.</p>

<p>"We were beginning to be afraid that you might not get here," said
our host.</p>

<p>"Really?" The Thirteenth Guest smiled quietly, but shook his head.
"Did you ever know me to break an engagement, under any
circumstances?"</p>

<p>The master of the house laughed, though not very cordially, I
thought. "No," he answered. "Your reputation for keeping your
appointments is proverbial. Even your enemies must admit that."</p>

<p>The Guest nodded and smiled again. Miss Lorna bent toward me.</p>

<p>"What do you think of him?" she asked, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Very striking sort of man," I answered, in a low tone. "But I'm
inclined to be a little afraid of him."</p>

<p>"So was I, at first," she said, and I heard the silver laugh
again. "But that soon wears off," she went on. "You'll know him
better some day."</p>

<p>"Shall I?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm quite sure you will. Oh, I don't pretend that I fell in
love with him at first sight. I went through a phase of feeling
afraid of him, as almost everyone does. You see, when people first
meet him they cannot possibly know how kind and gentle he can be,
though he is so tremendously strong. I've heard him called cruel and
ruthless and cold, but it's not true. Indeed it's not. He can be as
gentle as a woman, and he' s the truest friend in all the world."</p>

<p>I was going to ask her to tell me his name, but just then I saw
that she was looking at him, across me, and I sat as far back in my
chair as I could, so that they might speak to each other if they
wished to. Their eyes met, and there was a longing light in both. I
could not help glancing from one to the other; and Miss Lorna's sweet
lips moved almost imperceptibly, though no sound came from them. I
have seen young lovers make that small sign to each other even across
a room, the signal of a kiss given and returned in the heart's
thoughts.</p>

<p>If she had been less beautiful and young, if the man she loved had
not been so magnificently manly, it would have irritated me, but it
seemed natural that they should love and not be ashamed of it, and I
only hoped that no one else at the table had noticed the tenderly
quivering little contraction of the young girl's exquisite mouth.</p>

<p>"You remembered," said the man quietly. "I got your message this
morning. Thank you."</p>

<p>"I hope it's not going to be very hard," murmured Miss Lorna,
smiling. "Not that it would make any great difference if it were,"
she added more thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It's the easiest thing in life," he said, "And I promise that you
shall never regret it."</p>

<p>"I trust you," the young girl answered simply.</p>

<p>Then she turned away, for she no doubt felt the awkwardness of
talking to him across me of a secret which she had confided to me
without letting him know that she had done so. Instinctively I turned
to him, feeling that the moment had come for disregarding formality
and making his acquaintance, since we were neighbors at table in a
friend's house and I had known Miss Lorna so long. Besides, it is
always interesting to talk with a man who is just going to do
something very dangerous or dramatic and who does not guess that you
know what he is about.</p>

<p>"I suppose you motored here from town, as you said you missed the
train," I said. "It's a good road, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I literally flew," replied the dark man, with his gentle
smile. "I hope you're not superstitious about thirteen at table?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," I answered. "In the first place, I'm a
fatalist about everything that doesn't depend on my own free will. As
I have not the slightest intention of doing anything to shorten my
life, it will certainly not come to an abrupt end by any
autosuggestion arising from a silly superstition like that about
thirteen."</p>

<p>"Autosuggestion? That's rather a new light on the old
beliefs."</p>

<p>"And secondly," I continued, "I don't believe in death. There is
no such thing."</p>

<p>"Really?" My neighbor seemed greatly surprised. "How do you mean?"
he asked. "I don't think I understand you."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't," put in Miss Lorna, and the silver laugh
followed. She had overheard the conversation, and some of the others
were listening, too.</p>

<p>"You don't kill a book by translating it," I said, rather glad to
expound my views. "Death is only a translation of life into another
language. That's what I mean."</p>

<p>"That's a most interesting point of view," observed the Thirteenth
Guest thoughtfully. "I never thought of the matter in that way
before, though I've often seen the expression 'translated' in
epitaphs. Are you sure that you are not indulging in a little
paronomasia?"</p>

<p>"What's that?" inquired the hard-faced lady, with all the contempt
which a scholarly word deserves in polite society.</p>

<p>"It means punning," I answered. "No, I am not making a pun. Grave
subjects do not lend themselves to low forms of humor. I assure you,
I am quite in earnest. Death, in the ordinary sense, is not a real
phenomenon at all, so long as there is any life in the universe. It's
a name we apply to a change we only partly understand."</p>

<p>"Learned discussions are an awful bore," said the hard-faced lady
very audibly.</p>

<p>"I don't advise you to argue the question too sharply with your
neighbor there," laughed the master of the house, leaning forward and
speaking to me. "He'll get the better of you. He's an expert at what
you call 'translating people into another language.'"</p>

<p>If the man beside me was a famous surgeon, as our host perhaps
meant, it seemed to me that the remark was not in very good taste. He
looked more like a soldier.</p>

<p>"Does our friend mean that you are in the army, and that you are a
dangerous person?" I asked of him.</p>

<p>"No," he answered quietly. "I'm only a King's Messenger, and in my
own opinion I'm not at all dangerous."</p>

<p>"It must be rather an active life," I said, in order to say
something; "constantly coming and going, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, constantly."</p>

<p>I felt that Miss Lorna was watching and listening, and I turned to
her, only to find that she was again looking beyond me, at my
neighbor, though he did not see her. I remember her face very
distinctly as it was just then; the recollection is, in fact the last
impression I retain of her matchless beauty, for I never saw her
after that evening.</p>

<p>It is something to have seen one of the most beautiful women in
the world gazing at the man who was more to her than life and all it
held, it is something I cannot forget. But he did not return her look
just then, for he had joined in the general conversation, and very
soon afterward he practically absorbed it.</p>
