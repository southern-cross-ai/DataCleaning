<h2><a name="ch1"></a>In Kropfsberg Keep</h2>

<p>To the traveller from Innsbr&uuml;ck to Munich, up the lovely
valley of the silver Inn, many castles appear, one after another,
each on its beetling cliff or gentle hill,--appear and disappear,
melting into the dark fir trees that grow so thickly on every
side,--Laneck, Lichtwer, Ratholtz, Tratzberg, Matzen, Kropfsberg,
gathering close around the entrance to the dark and wonderful
Zillerthal.</p>

<p>But to us--Tom Rendel and myself--there are two castles only: not
the gorgeous and princely Ambras, nor the noble old Tratzberg, with
its crowded treasures of solemn and splendid medi&aelig;valism; but
little Matzen, where eager hospitality forms the new life of a
never-dead chivalry, and Kropfsberg, ruined, tottering, blasted by
fire and smitten with grievous years,--a dead thing, and
haunted,--full of strange legends, and eloquent of mystery and
tragedy.</p>

<p>We were visiting the von C--s at Matzen, and gaining our first
wondering knowledge of the courtly, cordial castle life in the
Tyrol,--of the gentle and delicate hospitality of noble
Austrians.</p>

<p>Brixleg had ceased to be but a mark on a map, and had become a
place of rest and delight, a home for homeless wanderers on the face
of Europe, while Schloss Matzen was a synonym for all that was
gracious and kindly and beautiful in life. The days moved on in a
golden round of riding and driving and shooting: down to Landl and
Thiersee for chamois, across the river to the magic Achensec, up the
Zillerthal, across the Schmerner Joch, even to the railway station at
Steinach. And in the evenings after the late dinners in the upper
hall where the sleepy hounds leaned against our chairs looking at us
with suppliant eyes, in the evenings when the fire was dying away in
the hooded fireplace in the library, stories. Stories, and legends,
and fairy tales, while the stiff old portraits changed countenance
constantly under the flickering firelight, and the sound of the
drifting Inn came softly across the meadows far below.</p>

<p>If ever I tell the Story of Schloss Matzen, then will be the time
to paint the too inadequate picture of this fair oasis in the desert
of travel and tourists and hotels; but just now it is Kropfsberg the
Silent that is of greater importance, for it was only in Matzen that
the story was told by Fr&auml;ulein E--, the gold-haired niece of
Frau von C--, one hot evening in July, when we were sitting in the
great west window of the drawing-room after a long ride up the
Stallenthal.</p>

<p>All the windows were open to catch the faint wind, and we had sat
for a long time watching the Otzethaler Alps turn rose-color over
distant Innsbr&uuml;ck, then deepen to violet as the sun went down
and the white mists rose slowly until Lichtwer and Laneck and
Kropfsberg rose like craggy islands in a silver sea.</p>

<p>And this is the story as Fr&auml;ulein E---told it to us,--the
Story of Kropfsberg Keep.</p>

<p>A great many years ago, soon after my grandfather died, and Matzen
came to us, when I was a little girl, and so young that I remember
nothing of the affair except as something dreadful that frightened me
very much, two young men who had studied painting with my grandfather
came down to Brixleg from Munich, partly to paint, and partly to
amuse themselves,--"ghost-hunting" as they said, for they were very
sensible young men and prided themselves on it, laughing at all kinds
of "superstition," and particularly at that form which believed in
ghosts and feared them.</p>

<p>They had never seen a real ghost, you know, and they belonged to a
certain set of people who believed nothing they had not seen
themselves,--which always seemed to me very conceited.</p>

<p>Well, they knew that we had lots of beautiful castles here in the
"lower valley," and they assumed, and rightly, that every castle has
at least one ghost story connected with it, so they chose this as
their hunting ground, only the game they sought was ghosts, not
chamois. Their plan was to visit every place that was supposed to be
haunted, and to meet every reputed ghost, and prove that it really
was no ghost at all.</p>

<p>There was a little inn down in the village then, kept by an old
man named Peter Rosskopf, and the two young men made this their
headquarters. The very first night they began to draw from the old
innkeeper all that he knew of legends and ghost stories connected
with Brixleg and its castles, and as he was a most garrulous old
gentleman he filled them with the wildest delight by his stories of
the ghosts of the castles about the mouth of the Zillerthal. Of
course the old man believed every word he said, and you can imagine
his horror and amazement when, after telling his guests the
particularly blood-curdling story of Kropfsberg and its haunted keep,
the elder of the two boys, whose surname I have forgotten, but whose
Christian name was Rupert, calmly said, "Your story is most
satisfactory: we will sleep in Kropfsberg Keep to-morrow night, and
you must provide us with all that we may need to make ourselves
comfortable."</p>

<p>The old man nearly fell into the fire. "What for a blockhead are
you?" he cried, with big eyes.</p>

<p>"The keep is haunted by Count Albert's ghost, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"That is why we are going there to-morrow night; we wish to make
the acquaintance of Count Albert."</p>

<p>"But there was a man stayed there once, and in the morning he was
dead."</p>

<p>"Very silly of him; there are two of us, and we carry
revolvers."</p>

<p>"But it's a ghost, I tell you," almost screamed the innkeeper;
"are ghosts afraid of firearms?"</p>

<p>"Whether they are or not, we are not afraid of them."</p>

<p>Here the younger boy broke in,--he was named Otto von Kleist. I
remember the name, for I had a music teacher once by that name. He
abused the poor old man shamefully; told him that they were going to
spend the night in Kropfsberg in spite of Count Albert and Peter
Rosskopf, and that he might as well make the most of it and earn his
money with cheerfulness.</p>

<p>In a word, they finally bullied the old fellow into submission,
and when the morning came he set about preparing for the suicide, as
he considered it, with sighs and mutterings and ominous shakings of
the head.</p>

<p>You know the condition of the castle now,--nothing but scorched
walls and crumbling piles of fallen masonry. Well, at the time I tell
you of, the keep was still partially preserved. It was finally burned
out only a few years ago by some wicked boys who came over from
Jenbach to have a good time. But when time ghost hunters came, though
the two lower floors had fallen into the crypt, the third floor
remained. The peasants said it could not fall, but that it would stay
until the Day of Judgment, because it was in the room above that the
wicked Count Albert sat watching the flames destroy the great castle
and his imprisoned guests, and where he finally hung himself in a
suit of armor that had belonged to his medi&aelig;val ancestor, the
first Count Kropfsberg.</p>

<p>No one dared touch him, and so he hung there for twelve years, and
all the time venturesome boys and daring men used to creep up the
turret steps and stare awfully through the chinks in the door at that
ghostly mass of steel that held within itself the body of a murderer
and suicide, slowly returning to the dust from which it was made.
Finally it disappeared, none knew whither, and for another dozen
years the room stood empty but for the old furniture and the rotting
hangings.</p>

<p>So, when the two men climbed the stairway to the haunted room,
they found a very different state of things from what exists now. The
room was absolutely as it was left the night Count Albert burned the
castle, except that all trace of the suspended suit of armor and its
ghastly contents had vanished.</p>

<p>No one had dared to cross the threshold, and I suppose that for
forty years no living thing had entered that dreadful room.</p>

<p>On one side stood a vast canopied bed of black wood, the damask
hangings of which were covered with mould and mildew. All the
clothing of the bed was in perfect order, and on it lay a book, open,
and face downward. The only other furniture in the room consisted of
several old chairs, a carved oak chest, and a big inlaid table
covered with books and papers, and on one corner two or three bottles
with dark solid sediment at the bottom, and a glass, also dark with
the dregs of wine that had been poured out almost half a century
before. The tapestry on the walls was green with mould, but hardly
torn or otherwise defaced, for although the heavy dust of forty years
lay on everything the room had been preserved from further harm. No
spider web was to be seen, no trace of nibbling mice, not even a dead
moth or fly on the sills of the diamond-paned windows; life seemed to
have shunned the room utterly and finally.</p>

<p>The men looked at the room curiously, and, I am sure, not without
some feelings of awe and unacknowledged fear; but, whatever they may
have felt of instinctive shrinking, they said nothing, and quickly
set to work to make the room passably inhabitable. They decided to
touch nothing that had not absolutely to be changed, and therefore
they made for themselves a bed in one corner with the mattress and
linen from the inn. In the great fireplace they piled a lot of wood
on the caked ashes of a fire dead for forty years, turned the old
chest into a table, and laid out on it all their arrangements for the
evening's amusement: food, two or three bottles of wine, pipes and
tobacco, and the chess-board that was their inseparable travelling
companion.</p>

<p>All this they did themselves: the innkeeper would not even come
within the walls of the outer court; he insisted that he had washed
his hands of the whole affair, the silly dunderheads might go to
their death their own way. He would not aid and abet them. One of the
stable boys brought the basket of food and the wood and the bed up
the winding stone stairs, to be sure, but neither money nor prayers
nor threats would bring him within the walls of the accursed place,
and he stared fearfully at the hare-brained boys as they worked
around the dead old room preparing for the night that was coming so
fast.</p>

<p>At length everything was in readiness, and after a final visit to
the inn for dinner Rupert and Otto started at sunset for the Keep.
Half the village went with them, for Peter Rosskopf had babbled the
whole story to an open-mouthed crowd of wondering men and women, and
as to an execution the awe-struck crowd followed the two boys dumbly,
curious to see if they surely would put their plan into execution.
But none went farther than the outer doorway of the stairs, for it
was already growing twilight. In absolute silence they watched the
two foolhardy youths with their lives in their hands enter the
terrible Keep, standing like a tower in the midst of the piles of
stones that had once formed walls joining it with the mass of the
castle beyond. When a moment later a light showed itself in the high
windows above, they sighed resignedly and went their ways, to wait
stolidly until morning should come and prove the truth of their fears
and warnings.</p>

<p>In the mean time the ghost hunters built a huge fire, lighted
their many candles, and sat down to await developments. Rupert
afterwards told my uncle that they really felt no fear whatever, only
a contemptuous curiosity, and they ate their supper with good
appetite and an unusual relish. It was a long evening. They played
many games of chess, waiting for midnight. Hour passed after hour,
and nothing occurred to interrupt the monotony of the evening. Ten,
eleven, came and went,--it was almost midnight. They piled more wood
in the fireplace, lighted new candles, looked to their pistols--and
waited. The clocks in the village struck twelve; the sound coming
muffled through the high, deep-embrasured windows. Nothing happened,
nothing to break the heavy silence; and with a feeling of
disappointed relief they looked at each other and acknowledged that
they had met another rebuff.</p>

<p>Finally they decided that there was no use in sitting up and
boring themselves any longer, they had much better rest; so Otto
threw himself down on the mattress, falling almost immediately
asleep. Rupert sat a little longer, smoking, and watching the stars
creep along behind the shattered glass and the bent leads of the
lofty windows; watching the fire fall together, and the strange
shadows move mysteriously on the mouldering walls. The iron hook in
the oak beam, that crossed the ceiling midway, fascinated him, not
with fear, but morbidly. So, it was from that hook that for twelve
years, twelve long years of changing summer and winter, the body of
Count Albert, murderer and suicide, hung in its strange casing of
medi&aelig;val steel; moving a little at first, and turning gently
while the fire died out on the hearth, while the ruins of the castle
grew cold, and horrified peasants sought for the bodies of the score
of gay, reckless, wicked guests whom Count Albert had gathered in
Kropfsberg for a last debauch, gathered to their terrible and
untimely death. What a strange and fiendish idea it was, the young,
handsome noble who had ruined himself and his family in the society
of the splendid debauchees, gathering them all together, men and
women who had known only love and pleasure, for a glorious and awful
riot of luxury, and then, when they were all dancing in the great
ballroom, locking the doors and burning the whole castle about them,
the while he sat in the great keep listening to their screams of
agonized fear, watching the fire sweep from wing to wing until the
whole mighty mass was one enormous and awful pyre, and then, clothing
himself in his great-great-grandfather's armor, hanging himself in
the midst of the ruins of what had been a proud and noble castle. So
ended a great family, a great house.</p>

<p>But that was forty years ago.</p>

<p>He was growing drowsy; the light flickered and flared in the
fireplace; one by one the candles went out; the shadows grew thick in
the room. Why did that great iron hook stand out so plainly?</p>

<p>Why did that dark shadow dance and quiver so mockingly behind
it?--why--But he ceased to wonder at anything. He was asleep.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he woke almost immediately; the fire still
burned, though low and fitfully on the hearth. Otto was sleeping,
breathing quietly and regularly; the shadows had gathered close
around him, thick and murky; with every passing moment the light died
in the fireplace; he felt stiff with cold. In the utter silence he
heard the clock in the village strike two. He shivered with a sudden
and irresistible feeling of fear, and abruptly turned and looked
towards the hook in the ceiling.</p>

<p>Yes, It was there, lie knew that It would be. It seemed quite
natural, he would have been disappointed had he seen nothing; but now
he knew that the story was true, knew that he was wrong, and that the
dead do sometimes return to earth, for there, in the fast-deepening
shadow, hung the black mass of wrought steel, turning a little now
and then, with the light flickering on the tarnished and rusty metal.
He watched it quietly; he hardly felt afraid it was rather a
sentiment of sadness and fatality that filled him, of gloomy
forebodings of something unknown, unimaginable. He sat and watched
the thing disappear in the gathering dark, his hand on his pistol as
it lay by him on the great chest. There was no sound but the regular
breathing of the sleeping boy on the mattress.</p>

<p>It had grown absolutely dark; a bat fluttered against the broken
glass of the window. He wondered if he was growing mad, for--he
hesitated to acknowledge it to himself--he heard.music; far, curious
music, a strange and luxurious dance, very faint, very vague, but
unmistakable.</p>

<p>Like a flash of lightning came a jagged line of fire down the
blank wall opposite him, a line that remained, that grew wider, that
let a pale cold light into the room, showing him now all its
details,--the empty fireplace, where a thin smoke rose in a spiral
from a bit of charred wood, the mass of the great bed, and, in the
very middle, black against the curious brightness, the armored man,
or ghost, or devil, standing, not suspended, beneath the rusty hook.
And with the rending of the wall the music grew more distinct, though
sounding still very, very far away.</p>

<p>Count Albert raised his mailed hand and beckoned to him; then
turned, and stood in the riven wall.</p>

<p>Without a word, Rupert rose and followed him, his pistol in hand.
Count Albert passed through the mighty wall and disappeared in the
unearthly light. Rupert followed mechanically. He felt the crushing
of the mortar beneath his feet, the roughness of the jagged wall
where he rested his hand to steady himself.</p>

<p>The keep rose absolutely isolated among the ruins, yet on passing
through the wall Rupert found himself in a long, uneven corridor, the
floor of which was warped and sagging, while the walls were covered
on one side with big faded portraits of an inferior quality, like
those in the corridor that connects the Pitti and Uffizzi in
Florence. Before him moved the figure of Count Albeit,--a black
silhouette in the ever-increasing light. And always the music grew
stronger and stranger, a mad, evil, seductive dance that bewitched
even while it disgusted.</p>

<p>In a final blaze of vivid, intolerable light, in a burst of
hellish music that might have come from Bedlam, Rupert stepped from
the corridor into a vast and curious room where at first he saw
nothing, distinguished nothing but a mad, seething whirl of sweeping
figures, white, in a white room, under white light, Count Albert
standing before him, the only dark object to be seen. As his eyes
grew accustomed to the fearful brightness, he knew that he was
looking on a dance such as the damned might see in hell, but such as
no living man had ever seen before.</p>

<p>Around the long, narrow hall, under the fearful light that came
from nowhere, but was omni-present, swept a rushing stream of
unspeakable horrors, dancing insanely, laughing, gibbering hideously;
the dead of forty years. White, polished skeletons, bare of flesh and
vesture, skeletons clothed in the dreadful rags of dried and rattling
sinews, the tags of tattering grave-clothes flaunting behind them.
These were the dead of many years ago. Then the dead of more recent
times, with yellow bones showing only here and there, the long and
insecure hair of their hideous heads writhing in the beating air.
Then green and gray horrors, bloated and shapeless, stained with
earth or dripping with spattering water; and here and there white,
beautiful things, like chiselled ivory, the dead of yesterday, locked
it may be, in the mummy arms of rattling skeletons.</p>

<p>Round and round the cursed room, a swaying, swirling maelstrom of
death, while the air grew thick with miasma, the floor foul with
shreds of shrouds, and yellow parchment, clattering bones, and wisps
of tangled hair.</p>

<p>And in the very midst of this ring of death, a sight not for words
nor for thought, a sight to blast forever the mind of the man who
looked upon it: a leaping, writhing dance of Count Albert's victims,
the score of beautiful women and reckless men who danced to their
awful death while the castle burned around them, charred and
shapeless now, a living charnel-house of nameless horror.</p>

<p>Count Albert, who had stood silent and gloomy, watching the dance
of the damned, turned to Rupert, and for the first time spoke.</p>

<p>"We are ready for you now; dance!"</p>

<p>A prancing horror, dead some dozen years, perhaps, flaunted from
the rushing river of the dead, and leered at Rupert with eyeless
skull.</p>

<p>"Dance!"</p>

<p>Rupert stood frozen, motionless.</p>

<p>"Dance!"</p>

<p>His hard lips moved. "Not if the devil came from hell to make
me."</p>

<p>Count Albert swept his vast two-handed sword into the foetid air
while the tide of corruption paused in its swirling, and swept down
on Rupert with gibbering grins.</p>

<p>The room, and the howling dead, and the black portent before him
circled dizzily around, as with a last effort of departing
consciousness he drew his pistol and fired full in the face of Count
Albert.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Perfect silence, perfect darkness; not a breath, not a sound: the
dead stillness of a long-sealed tomb. Rupert lay on his back,
stunned, helpless, his pistol clenchedi in his frozen hand, a smell
of powder in the black air. Where was he? Dead? In hell? He reached
his hand out cautiously; it fell on dusty boards. Outside, far away,
a clock struck three. Had he dreamed? Of course; but how ghastly a
dream! With chattering teeth he called softly,---"Otto!"</p>

<p>There was no reply, and none when he called again and again. He
staggered weakly to his feet, groping for matches and candles. A
panic of abject terror came on him; the matches were gone!</p>

<p>He turned towards the fireplace: a single coal glowed in the white
ashes. He swept a mass of papers and dusty books from the table, and
with trembling hands cowered over the embers, until he succeeded in
lighting the dry tinder. Then he piled the old books on the blaze,
and looked fearfully around.</p>

<p>No: It was gone,--thank God for that; the hook was empty.</p>

<p>But why did Otto sleep so soundly; why did he not awake?</p>

<p>He stepped unsteadily across the room in the flaring light of the
burning books, and knelt by the mattress.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>So they found him in the morning, when no one came to the inn from
Kropfsberg Keep, and the quaking Peter Rosskopf arranged a relief
party;--found him kneeling beside the mattress where Otto lay, shot
in the throat and quite dead.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2"></a>Notre Dame des Eaux</h2>

<p>West of St. Pol de Leon, on the sea-cliffs of Finisterre, stands
the ancient church of Notre Dame des Eaux. Five centuries of beating
winds and sweeping rains have moulded its angles, and worn its
carvings and sculpture down to the very semblance of the ragged
cliffs themselves, until even the Breton fisherman, looking lovingly
from his boat as he makes for the harbor of Morlaix, hardly can say
where the crags end, and where the church begins. The teeth of the
winds of the sea have devoured, bit by bit, the fine sculpture of the
doorway and the thin cusps of the windows tracery; gray moss creeps
caressingly over the worn walls in ineffectual protection; gentle
vines, turned crabbed by the harsh beating of the fierce winds,
clutch the crumbling buttresses, climb up over the sinking roof,
reach in even at the louvres of the belfry, holding the little
sanctuary safe in desperate arms against the savage warfare of the
sea and sky.</p>

<p>Many a time you may follow the rocky highway from St. Pol even
around the last land of France, and so to Brest, yet never see sign
of Notre Dame des Eaux; for it clings to a cliff somewhat lower than
the road, and between grows a stunted thicket of harsh and ragged
trees, their skeleton white branches, tortured and contorted,
thrusting sorrowfully out of the hard, dark foliage that still grows
below, where the rise of land below the highway gives some
protection.</p>

<p>You must leave the wood by the two cottages of yellow stone, about
twenty miles beyond St. Pol, and go down to the right, around the old
stone quarry; then, bearing to the left by the little cliff path, you
will, in a moment, see the pointed roof of the tower of Notre Dame,
and, later, come down to the side porch among the crosses of the arid
little graveyard.</p>

<p>It is worth the walk, for though the church has outwardly little
but its sad picturesqueness to repay the artist, within it is a dream
and a delight. A Norman nave of round, red stone piers and arches, a
delicate choir of the richest flamboyant, a High Altar of the time of
Francis I., form only the mellow background and frame for carven
tombs and dark old pictures, hanging lamps of iron and brass, and
black, heavily carved choir-stalls of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>So has the little church lain unnoticed for many centuries; for
the horrors and follies of the Revolution have never come near, and
the hardy and faithful people of Finisterre have feared God and loved
Our Lady too well to harm her church. For many years it was the
church of the Comtes de Jarleuc; and these are their tombs that
mellow year by year under the warm light of the painted windows,
given long ago by Comte Robert de Jarleuc, when the heir of
Poullaouen came safely to shore in the harbor of Morlaix, having
escaped from the Isle of Wight, where he had lain captive after the
awful defeat of the fleet of Charles of Valois at Sluys. And now the
heir of Poullaouen lies in a carven tomb, forgetful of the world
where he fought so nobly: the dynasty he fought to establish, only a
memory; the family he made glorious, a name; the Ch&acirc;teau
Poullaouen a single crag of riven masonry in the field's of M. du
Bois, mayor of Morlaix.</p>

<p>It was Julien, Comte de Bergerac, who rediscovered Notre Dame des
Laux, and by his picture of its dreamy interior in the Salon of '86
brought once more into notice this forgotten corner of the world. The
next year a party of painters settled themselves near by, roughing it
as best they could, and in the year following, Mme. de Bergerac and
her daughter H&eacute;lo&iuml;s e came with Julien, and, buying the
old farm of Pontivy, on the highway over Notre Dame, turned it into a
summer house that almost made amends for their lost ch&acirc;teau on
the Dordogne, stolen from them as virulent Royalists by the
triumphant Republic in 1794.</p>

<p>Little by little a summer colony of painters gathered around
Pontivy, and it was not until the spring of 1890 that the peace of
the colony was broken. It was a sorrowful tragedy. Jean d'Yriex, the
youngest and merriest devil of all the jolly crew, became suddenly
moody and morose. At first this was attributed to his undisguised
admiration for Mlle. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, and was looked on as one of
the vagaries of boyish passion; but one day, while riding with M. de
Bergerac, he suddenly seized the bridle of Julien's horse, wrenched
it from his hand, and, turning his own horse's head towards the
cliffs, lashed the terrified animals into a galop straight towards
the brink. He was only thwarted in his mad object by Julien, who with
a quick blow sent him headlong in the dry grass, and reined in the
terrified animals hardly a yard from the cliffs. When this happened,
and no word of explanation was granted, only a sullen silence that
lasted for days, it became clear that poor Jean's brain was wrong in
some way. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se dev oted herself to him with infinite
patience,--though she felt no special affection for him, only
pity,--and while he was with her he seemed sane and quiet. But at
night some strange mania took possession of him.</p>

<p>If he had worked on his Prix de R&ocirc;me picture in the daytime,
while H&eacute;lo&iuml;se sat by him, reading aloud or singing a
little, no matter how good the work, it would have vanished in the
morning, and he would again begin, only to erase his labor during
tile night.</p>

<p>At last his growing insanity reached its climax; and one day in
Notre Dame, when he had painted better than usual, he suddenly
stopped, seized a palette knife, and slashed the great canvas in
strips. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se sprang forward to stop him, and in crazy
fury he turned on her, striking at her throat with the palette knife.
The thin steel snapped, and the white throat showed only a scarlet
scratch. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, with out that ordinary terror that
would crush most women, grasped the thin wrists of the madman, and,
though he could easily have wrenched his hands away, d'Yriex sank on
his knees in a passion of tears. He shut himself in his room at
Pontivy, refusing to see any one, walking for hours up and down,
fighting against growing madness. Soon Dr.</p>

<p>Charpentier came from Paris, summoned by Mme. de Bergerac; and
after one short, forced interview, left at once for Paris, taking M.
d'Yriex with him.</p>

<p>A few days later came a letter for Mme. de Bergerac, in which Dr.
Charpentier confessed that Jean had disappeared, that he had allowed
him too much liberty, owing to his apparent calmness, and that when
the train stopped at Le Mans he had slipped from him and utterly
vanished.</p>

<p>During the summer, word came occasionally that no trace had been
found of the unhappy man, and at last the Pontivy colony realized
that the merry boy was dead. Had he lived he must have been found,
for the exertions of the police were perfect; yet not the slightest
trace was discovered, and his lamentable death was acknowledged, not
only by Mme. de Bergerac and Jean's family,--sorrowing for the death
of their first-born, away in the warm hills of Loz&egrave;re,---but
by Dr. Charpentier as well.</p>

<p>So the summer passed, and the autumn came, and at last the cold
rains of November--the skirmish line of the advancing army of
winter--drove the colony back to Paris.</p>

<p>It was the last day at Pontivy, and Mlle. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se had
come down to Notre Dame for a last look at the beautiful shrine, a
last prayer for the repose of the tortured soul of poor Jean d'
Yriex. The rains had ceased for a time, and a warm stillness lay over
the cliffs and on the creeping sea, swaying and lapping around the
ragged shore. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se knelt very long before the Altar of
Our Lady of the Waters; and when she finally rose, could not bring
herself to leave as yet that place of sorrowful beauty, all warm and
golden with the last light of the declining sun. She watched the old
verger, Pierre Polou, stumping softly around the darkening building,
and spoke to him once, asking the hour; but he was very deaf, as well
as nearly blind, and he did not answer.</p>

<p>So she sat in the corner of the aisle by the Altar of Our Lady of
the Waters, watching the checkered light fade in the advancing
shadows, dreaming sad day-dreams of the dead summer, until the
day-dreams merged in night-dreams, and she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Then the last light of the early sunset died in the gleaming
quarries of the west window; Pierre Polou stumbled uncertainly
through the dusky shadow, locked the sagging doors of the mouldering
south porch, and took his way among the leaning crosses up to the
highway and his little cottage, a good mile away,--the nearest house
to the lonely Church of Notre Dame des Eaux.</p>

<p>With the setting of the sun great clouds rose swiftly from time
sea; the wind freshened, and the gaunt branches of the weather-worn
trees in the churchyard lashed themselves beseechingly before the
coming storm. The tide turned, and the waters at the foot of the
rocks swept uneasily up the narrow beach and caught at the weary
cliffs, their sobbing growing and deepening to a threatening, solemn
roar. Whirls of dead leaves rose in the churchyard, and threw
themselves against the blank windows. The winter and the night came
down together.</p>

<p>H&eacute;lo&iuml;se awoke, bewildered and wondering; in a moment
she realized the situation, and with out fear or uneasiness. There
was nothing to dread in Notre Dame by night; the ghosts, if there
were ghosts, would not trouble her, and the doors were securely
locked. It was foolish of her to fall asleep, and her mother would be
most uneasy at Pontivy if she realized before dawn that
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se had not returned. On the other hand, she was in
the habit of wandering off to walk after dinner, often not coming
home until late, so it was quite possible that she might return
before Madame knew of her absence, for Polou came always to unlock
the church for the low mass at six o'clock; so she arose from her
cramped position in the aisle, and walked slowly up to the
choir-rail, entered the chancel, and felt her way to one of the
stalls, on the south side, where there were cushions and an easy
back.</p>

<p>It was really very beautiful in Notre Dame by night; she had never
suspected how strange and solemn the little church could be when the
moon shone fitfully through the south windows, now bright and clear,
now blotted out by sweeping clouds. The nave was barred with the long
shadows of the heavy pillars, and when the moon came out she could
see far down almost to the west end. How still it was! Only a soft
low murmur without of the restless limbs of the trees, and of the
creeping sea.</p>

<p>It was very soothing, almost like a song; and H&eacute;lo&iuml;se
felt sleep coming back to her as the clouds shut out the moon, and
all the church grew black.</p>

<p>She was drifting off into the last delicious moment of vanishing
consciousness, when she suddenly came fully awake, with a shock that
made every nerve tingle. In the midst of the far faint sounds of the
tempestuous night she had heard a footstep! Yet the church was
utterly empty, she was sure. And again! A footstep dragging and
uncertain, stealthy and cautious, but an unmistakable step, away in
the blackest shadow at the end of the church.</p>

<p>She sat up, frozen with the fear that comes at night and that is
overwhelming, her hands clutching the coarse carving of the arms of
the stall, staring down into the dark.</p>

<p>Again the footstep, and again,--slow, measured, one after another
at intervals of perhaps half a minute, growing a little louder each
time, a little nearer.</p>

<p>Would the darkness never be broken? Would the cloud never pass?
Minute after minute went like weary hours, and still the moon was
hid, still the dead branches rattled clatteringly on the high
windows. Unconsciously she moved, as under a magician's spell, down
to the choir-rail, straining her eyes to pierce the thick night. And
the step, it was very near! Ah, the moon at last!</p>

<p>A white ray fell through the westernmost window, painting a bar of
light on the floor of sagging.stone. Then a second bar, then a third,
and a fourth, and for a moment H&eacute;lo&iuml;se could have cried
out with relief, for nothing broke the lines of light,--no figure, no
shadow. In another moment came a step, and from the shadow of the
last column appeared in the pallid moonlight the figure of a man. The
girl stared breathless, the moonlight falling on her as she stood
rigid against the low parapet. Another step and another, and she saw
before her--was it ghost or living man?--a white mad face staring
from matted hair and beard, a tall thin figure half clothed in rags,
limping as it stepped towards her with wounded feet. From the dead
face stared mad eyes that gleamed like the eyes of a cat, fixed on
hers with insane persistence, holding her, fascinating her as a cat
fascinates a bird.</p>

<p>One more step,--it was close before her now! Those awful, luminous
eyes dilating and contracting in awful palpitations. And the moon was
going out; the shadows swept one by one over the windows; she stared
at the moonlit face for a last fascinated glance--Mother of God! it
was--The shadow swept over them, and now only remained the blazing
eyes and the dim outline of a form that crouched waveringly before
her as a cat crouches, drawing its vibrating body together for the
spring that blots out the life of the victim.</p>

<p>In another instant the mad thing would leap; but just as the
quiver swept over the crouching body, H&eacute;lo&iuml;se gathered
all her strength into one action of desperate terror.</p>

<p>"Jean, stop!"</p>

<p>The thing crouched before her paused, chattering softly to itself;
then it articulated dryly, and with all the trouble of a learning
child, the one word, "Chantes!"</p>

<p>Without a thought, H&eacute;lo&iuml;se sang; it was the first
thing that she remembered, an old Proven &ccedil;al song that d'Yriex
had always loved. While she sang, the poor mad creature lay huddled
at her feet, separated from her only by the choir parapet, its
dilating, contracting eyes never moving for an instant. As the song
died away, came again that awful tremor, indicative of the coming
death-spring, and again she sang,--this time the old Pange lingua,
its sonorous Latin sounding in the deserted church like the voice of
dead centuries.</p>

<p>And so she sang, on and on, hour after hour,--hymns and chansons,
folk-songs and bits from comic operas, songs of the boulevards
alternating with the Tantum ergo and the O Fillii et Fili&aelig;.</p>

<p>It mattered little what she sang. At last it seemed to her that it
mattered little whether she sang or no; for her brain whirled round
and round like a dizzy maelstrom, her icy hands, griping the hard
rail, alone supported her dying body. She could hear no sound of her
song; her body was numb, her mouth parched, her lips cracked and
bleeding; she felt the drops of blood fall from her chin.</p>

<p>And still she sang, within the yellow palpitating eyes holding her
as in a vice. If only she could continue until dawn! It must be dawn
so soon! The windows were growing gray, the rain lashed outside, she
could distinguish the features of the horror before her; but the
night of death was growing with the coming day, blackness swept down
upon her; she could sing no more, her tortured lips made one last
effort to form the words, "Mother of God, save me!" and night and
death came down like a crushing wave.</p>

<p>But her prayer was heard; the dawn had come, and Polou unlocked
the porch-door for Father Augustin just in time to hear the last
agonized cry. The maniac turned in the very act of leaping on his
victim, and sprang for the two men, who stopped in dumb amazement.
Poor old Pierre Polou went down at a blow; but Father Augustin was
young and fearless, and he grappled the mad animal with all his
strength and will. It would have gone ill even with him,--for no one
can stand against the bestial fury of a man in whom reason is
dead,--had not some sudden impulse seized the maniac, who pitched the
priest aside with a single movement, and, leaping through the door,
vanished forever.</p>

<p>Did he hurl himself from the cliffs in the cold wet morning, or
was he doomed to wander, a wild beast, until, captured, he beat
himself in vain against the walls of some asylum, an unknown pauper
lunatic? None ever knew.</p>

<p>The colony at Pontivy was blotted out by the dreary tragedy, and
Notre Dame des Eaux sank once more into silence and solitude. Once a
year Father Augustin said mass for the repose of the soul of Jean
d'Yriex; but no other memory remained of the horror that blighted the
lives of an innocent girl and of a gray-haired mother mourning for
her dead boy in far Loz&egrave;re.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3"></a>No. 252 Rue M. le Prince.</h2>

<p>WHEN in May, 1886, I found myself at last in Paris, I naturally
determined to throw myself on the charity of an old chum of mine,
Eugene Marie d'Ardeche, who had forsaken Boston a year or more ago on
receiving word of the death of an aunt who had left him such property
as she possessed. I fancy this windfall surprised him not a little,
for the relations between the aunt and nephew had never been cordial,
judging from Eugene's remarks touching the lady, who was, it seems, a
more or less wicked and witch-like old person, with a penchant for
black magic, at least such was the common report.</p>

<p>Why she should leave all her property to d'Ardeche, no one could
tell, unless it was that she felt his rather hobbledehoy tendencies
towards Buddhism and occultism might some day lead him to her own
unhallowed height of questionable illumination. To be sure d'Ardeche
reviled her as a bad old woman, being himself in that state of
enthusiastic exaltation which sometimes accompanies a boyish fancy
for occultism; but in spite of his distant and repellent attitude,
Mlle. Blaye de Tartas made him her sole heir, to the violent wrath of
a questionable old party known to infamy as the Sar Torrevieja, the
"King of the Sorcerers." This malevolent old portent, whose gray and
crafty face was often seen in the Rue M. le Prince during the life of
Mlle. de Tartas had, it seems, fully expected to enjoy her small
wealth after her death; and when it appeared that she had left him
only the contents of the gloomy old house in the Quartier Latin,
giving the house itself and all else of which she died possessed to
her nephew in America, the Sar proceeded to remove everything from
the place, and then to curse it elaborately and comprehensively,
together with all those who should ever dwell therein.</p>

<p>Whereupon he disappeared.</p>

<p>This final episode was the last word I received from Eugene, but I
knew the number of the house, 252 Rue M. le Prince. So, after a day
or two given to a first cursory survey of Paris, I started across the
Seine to find Eugene and compel him to do the honors of the city.</p>

<p>Every one who knows the Latin Quarter knows the Rue M. le Prince,
running up the hill towards the Garden of the Luxembourg. It is full
of queer houses and odd corners,--or was in '86,--and certainly No.
252 was, when I found it, quite as queer as any. It was nothing but a
doorway, a black arch of old stone between and under two new houses
painted yellow. The effect of this bit of seventeenth century
masonry, with its dirty old doors, and rusty broken lantern sticking
gaunt and grim out over the narrow sidewalk, was, in its frame of
fresh plaster, sinister in the extreme.</p>

<p>I wondered if I had made a mistake in the number; it was quite
evident that no one lived behind those cobwebs. I went into the
doorway of one of the new h&ocirc;tels and interviewed the
concierge.</p>

<p>No, M. d'Ardeche did not live there, though to be sure he owned
the mansion; he himself resided in Meudon, in the country house of
the late Mlle. de Tartas. Would Monsieur like the number and the
street?</p>

<p>Monsieur would like them extremely, so I took the card that the
concierge wrote for me, and forthwith started for the river, in order
that I might take a steamboat for Meudon. By one of those
coincidences which happen so often, being quite inexplicable, I had
not gone twenty paces down the street before I ran directly into the
arms of Eugene d'Ardeche. In three minutes we were sitting in the
queer little garden of the Chien Bleu, drinking vermouth and
absinthe, and talking it all over.</p>

<p>"You do not live in your aunt's house?" I said at last,
interrogatively.</p>

<p>"No, but if this sort of thing keeps on I shall have to. I like
Meudon much better, and the house is perfect, all furnished, and
nothing in it newer than the last century. You must come out with me
to-night and see it. I have got a jolly room fixed up for my Buddha.
But there is something wrong with this house opposite. I can't keep a
tenant in it,--not four days. I have had three, all within six
months, but the stories have gone around and a man would as soon
think of hiring the Cour des Comptes to live in as No. 252. It is
notorious. The fact is, it is haunted the worst way."</p>

<p>I laughed and ordered more vermouth.</p>

<p>"That is all right. It is haunted all the same, or enough to keep
it empty, and the funny part is that no one knows how it is haunted.
Nothing is ever seen, nothing heard. As far as I can find out, people
just have the horrors there, and have them so bad they have to go to
the hospital afterwards. I have one ex-tenant in the Bic&ecirc;tre
now. So the house stands empty, and as it covers considerable ground
and is taxed for a lot, I don't know what to do about it. I think
I'll either give it to that child of sin, Torrevieja, or else go and
live in it myself. I shouldn't mind the ghosts, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Did you ever stay there?"</p>

<p>"No, but I have always intended to, and in fact I came up here
to-day to see a couple of rake-hell fellows I know, Fargeau and
Duchesne, doctors in the Clinical Hospital beyond here, up by the
Parc Mont Souris. They promised that they would spend the night with
me some time in my aunt's house,--which is called around here, you
must know, 'la Bouche d'Enfer,'--and I thought perhaps they would
make it this week, if they can get off duty. Come up with me while I
see them, and then we can go across the river to V&eacute;four's and
have some luncheon, you can get your things at the Chatham, and we
will go out to Meudon, where of course you will spend the night with
me."</p>

<p>The plan suited me perfectly, so we went up to the hospital, found
Fargeau, who declared that he and Duchesne were ready for anything,
the nearer the real "bouche d'enfer" the better; that the following
Thursday they would both be off duty for the night, and that on that
day they would join in an attempt to outwit the devil and clear up
the mystery of No. 252.</p>

<p>"Does M. l'Am&eacute;ricain go with us?" asked Fargeau.</p>

<p>"Why of course," I replied, "I intend to go, and you must not
refuse me, d'Ardeche; I decline to be put off. Here is a chance for
you to do the honors of your city in a manner which is faultless.
Show me a real live ghost, and I will forgive Paris for having lost
the Jardin Mabille."</p>

<p>So it was settled.</p>

<p>Later we went down to Meudon and ate dinner in the terrace room of
the villa, which was all that d'Ardeche had said, and more, so
utterly was its atmosphere that of the seventeenth century. At dinner
Eugene told me more about his late aunt, and the queer goings on in
the old house.</p>

<p>Mlle. Blaye lived, it seems, all alone, except for one female
servant of her own age; a severe, taciturn creature, with massive
Breton features and a Breton tongue, whenever she vouchsafed to use
it. No one ever was seen to enter the door of No. 252 except Jeanne
the servant and the Sar Torrevieja, the latter coming constantly from
none knew whither, and always entering, never leaving. Indeed, the
neighbors, who for eleven years had watched the old sorcerer sidle
crab-wise up to the bell almost every day, declared vociferously that
never had he been seen to leave the house. Once, when they decided to
keep absolute guard, the watcher, none other than Ma&icirc;tre
Garceau of the Chien Bleu, after keeping his eyes fixed on the door
from ten o'clock one morning when the Sar arrived until four in the
afternoon, during which time the door was unopened (he knew this, for
had he not gummed a ten-centime stamp over the joint and was not the
stamp unbroken) nearly fell down when the sinister figure of
Torrevieja slid wickedly by him with a dry "Pardon, Monsieur!" and
disappeared again through the black doorway.</p>

<p>This was curious, for No. 252 was entirely surrounded by houses,
its only windows opening on a courtyard into which no eye could look
from the h&ocirc;tels of the Rue M. le Prince and the Rue de l'Ecole,
and the mystery was one of the choice possessions of the Latin
Quarter.</p>

<p>Once a year the austerity of the place was broken, and the
denizens of the whole quarter stood open-mouthed watching many
carriages drive up to No. 252, many of them private, not a few with
crests on the door panels, from all of them descending veiled female
figures and men with coat collars turned up. Then followed curious
sounds of music from within, and those whose houses joined the blank
walls of No. 252 became for the moment popular, for by placing the
ear against the wall strange music could distinctly be heard, and the
sound of monotonous chanting voices now and then. By dawn the last
guest would have departed, and for another year the hotel of Mlle. de
Tartas was ominously silent.</p>

<p>Eugene declared that he believed it was a celebration of
"Walpurgisnacht," and certainly appearances favored such a fancy.</p>

<p>"A queer thing about the whole affair is," he said, "the fact that
every one in the street swears that about a month ago, while I was
out in Concarneau for a visit, the music and voices were heard again,
just as when my revered aunt was in the flesh. The house was
perfectly empty, as I tell you, so it is quite possible that the good
people were enjoying an hallucination."</p>

<p>I must acknowledge that these stories did not reassure me; in
fact, as Thursday came near, I began to regret a little my
determination to spend the night in the house. I was too vain to back
down, however, and the perfect coolness of the two doctors, who ran
down Tuesday to Meudon to make a few arrangements, caused me to swear
that I would die of fright before I would flinch. I suppose I
believed more or less in ghosts, I am sure now that I am older I
believe in them, there are in fact few things I can not believe. Two
or three inexplicable things had happened to me, and, although this
was before my adventure with Rendel in P&aelig;stum, I had a strong
predisposition to believe some things that I could not explain,
wherein I was out of sympathy with the age.</p>

<p>Well, to come to the memorable night of the twelfth of June, we
had made our preparations, and after depositing a big bag inside the
doors of No. 252, went across to the Chien Bleu, where Fargeau and
Duchesne turned up promptly, and we sat down to the best dinner
P&egrave;re Garceau could create.</p>

<p>I remember I hardly felt that the conversation was in good taste.
It began with various stories of Indian fakirs and Oriental jugglery,
matters in which Eugene was curiously well read, swerved to the
horrors of the great Sepoy mutiny, and thus to reminiscences of the
dissecting-room. By this time we had drunk more or less, and Duchesne
launched into a photographic and Zolaesque account of the only time
(as he said) when he was possessed of the panic of fear; namely, one
night many years ago, when he was locked by accident into the
dissecting-room of the Loucine, together with several cadavers of a
rather unpleasant nature. I ventured to protest mildly against the
choice of subjects, the result being a perfect carnival of horrors,
so that when we finally drank our last cr&egrave;me de cacao and
started for "la Bouche d'Enfer," my nerves were in a somewhat rocky
condition.</p>

<p>It was just ten o'clock when we came into the street. A hot dead
wind drifted in great puffs through the city, and ragged masses of
vapor swept the purple sky; an unsavory night altogether, one of
those nights of hopeless lassitude when one feels, if one is at home,
like doing nothing but drink mint juleps and smoke cigarettes.</p>

<p>Eugene opened the creaking door, and tried to light one of the
lanterns; but the gusty wind blew out every match, and we finally had
to close the outer doors before we could get a light. At last we had
all the lanterns going, and I began to look around curiously. We were
in a long, vaulted passage, partly carriageway, partly footpath,
perfectly bare but for the street refuse which had drifted in with
eddying winds. Beyond lay the courtyard, a curious place rendered
more curious still by the fitful moonlight and the flashing of four
dark lanterns. The place had evidently been once a most noble palace.
Opposite rose the oldest portion, a three-story wall of the time of
Francis I., with a great wisteria vine covering half. The wings on
either side were more modern, seventeenth century, and ugly, while
towards the street was nothing but a flat unbroken wall.</p>

<p>The great bare court, littered with bits of paper blown in by the
wind, fragments of packing cases, and straw, mysterious with flashing
lights and flaunting shadows, while low masses of torn vapor drifted
overhead, hiding, then revealing the stars, and all in absolute
silence not even the sounds of the streets entering this prison-like
place, was weird and uncanny in the extreme. I must confess that
already I began to feel a slight disposition towards the horrors, but
with that curious inconsequence which so often happens in the case of
those who are deliberately growing scared, I could think of nothing
more reassuring than those delicious verses of Lewis Carroll's:--</p>

<p>"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice.</p>

<p>That alone should encourage the crew.</p>

<p>Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice.</p>

<p>What I tell you three times is true,"--</p>

<p>which kept repeating themselves over and over in my brain with
feverish insistence.</p>

<p>Even the medical students had stopped their chaffing, and were
studying the surroundings gravely.</p>

<p>"There is one thing certain," said Fargeau "anything might have
happened here without the slightest chance of discovery. Did ever you
see such a perfect place for lawlessness?"</p>

<p>"And anything might happen here now, with the same certainty of
impunity," continued Duchesne, lighting his pipe, the snap of the
match making us all start. "D'Ardeche, your lamented relative was
certainly well fixed; she had full scope here for her traditional
experiments in demonology."</p>

<p>"Curse me if I don't believe that those same traditions were more
or less founded on fact," said Eugene. "I never saw this court under
these conditions before, but I could believe anything now. What 's
that!"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a door slamming," said Duchesne, loudly.</p>

<p>"Well, I wish doors would n't slam in houses at have been empty
eleven months."</p>

<p>"It is irritating," and Duchesne slipped his arm through mine;
"but we must take things as they come. Remember we have to deal not
only with the spectral lumber left here by your scarlet aunt, but as
well with the supererogatory curse of that hellcat Torrevieja. Come
on! let 's get inside before the hour arrives for the sheeted dead to
squeak and gibber in these lonely halls. Light your pipes, your
tobacco is a sure protection against 'your whoreson dead bodies';
light up and move on."</p>

<p>We opened the hall door and entered a vaulted stone vestibule,
full of dust, and cobwebby.</p>

<p>"There is nothing on this floor," said Eugene, "except servants'
rooms and offices, and I don't believe there is anything wrong with
them. I never heard that there was, any way. Let 's go up
stairs."</p>

<p>So far as we could see, the house was apparently perfectly
uninteresting inside, all eighteenth century work, the fa&ccedil;ade
of the main building being, with the vestibule, the only portion of
the Francis I. work.</p>

<p>"The place was burned during the Terror," said Eugene, "for my
great-uncle, from whom Mlle. de Tartas inherited it, was a good and
true Royalist; he went to Spain after the Revolution, and did not
come back until the accession of Charles X., when he restored the
house, and then died, enormously old. This explains why it is all so
new."</p>

<p>The old Spanish sorcerer to whom Mlle. de Tartas had left her
personal property had done his work thoroughly. The house was
absolutely empty, even the wardrobes and bookcases built in had been
carried away; we went through room after room, finding all absolutely
dismantled, only the windows and doors with their casings, the
parquet floors, and the florid Renaissance mantels remaining.</p>

<p>"I feel better," remarked Fargeau. "The house may be haunted, but
it don't look it, certainly; it is the most respectable place
imaginable."</p>

<p>"Just you wait," replied Eugene. "These are only the state
apartments, which my aunt seldom used, except, perhaps, on her annual
'Walpurgisnacht.' Come up stairs and I will show you a better mise en
sc&egrave;ne."</p>

<p>On this floor, the rooms fronting the court, the sleeping-rooms,
were quite small,--("They are the bad rooms all the same," said
Eugene,)--four of them, all just as ordinary in appearance as those
below. A corridor ran behind them connecting with the wing corridor,
and from this opened a door, unlike any of the other doors in that it
was covered with green baize, somewhat moth-eaten. Eugene selected a
key from the bunch he carried, unlocked the door, and with some
difficulty forced it to swing inward; it was as heavy as the door of
a safe.</p>

<p>"We are now," he said, "on the very threshold of hell itself;
these rooms in here were my scarlet aunt's unholy of unholies. I
never let them with the rest of the house, but keep them as a
curiosity. I only wish Torrevieja had kept out; as it was, he looted
them, as he did the rest of the house, and nothing is left but the
walls and ceiling and floor. They are something, however, and may
suggest what the for mer condition must have been. Tremble and
enter."</p>

<p>The first apartment was a kind of anteroom, a cube of perhaps
twenty feet each way, without windows, and with no doors except that
by which we entered and another to the right. Walls, floor, and
ceiling were covered with a black lacquer, brilliantly polished, that
flashed the light of our lanterns in a thousand intricate
reflections. It was like the inside of an enormous Japanese box, and
about as empty. From this we passed to another room, and here we
nearly dropped our lanterns. The room was circular, thirty feet or so
in diameter, covered by a hemispherical dome; walls and ceiling were
dark blue, spotted with gold stars; and reaching from floor to floor
across the dome stretched a colossal figure in red Jacquer of a nude
woman kneeling, her legs reaching out along the floor on either side,
her head touching the lintel of the door through which we had
entered, her arms forming its sides, with the fore arms extended and
stretching along the walls until they met the long feet. The most
astounding, misshapen, absolutely terrifying thing, I think, I ever
saw. From the navel hung a great white object, like the traditional
roe's egg of the Arabian Nights. The floor was of red lacquer, and in
it was inlaid a pentagram the size of the room, made of wide strips
of brass. In the centre of this pentagram was a circular disk of
black stone slightly saucer-shaped, with a small outlet in the
middle.</p>

<p>The effect of the room was simply crushing, with this gigantic red
figure crouched over it all, the staring eyes fixed on one, no matter
what his position. None of us spoke, so oppressive was the whole
thing.</p>

<p>The third room was like the first in dimensions, but instead of
being black it was entirely sheathed with plates of brass, walls,
ceiling, and floor,--tarnished now, and turning green, but still
brilliant under the lantern light. In the middle stood an oblong
altar of porphyry, its longer dimensions on the axis of the suite of
rooms, and at one end, opposite the range of doors, a pedestal of
black basalt.</p>

<p>This was all. Three rooms, stranger than these, even in their
emptiness, it would be hard to imagine. In Egypt, in India, they
would not be entirely out of place, but here in Paris, in a
commonplace h&ocirc;tel, in the Rue M. le Prince, they were
incredible.</p>

<p>We retraced our steps, Eugene closed the iron door with its baize
covering, and we went into one of the front chambers and sat down,
looking at each other.</p>

<p>"Nice party, your aunt," said Fargeau. "Nice old party, with
amiable tastes; I am glad we are not to spend the night in those
rooms."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose she did there?" inquired Duchesne. "I know
more or less about black art, but that series of rooms is too much
for me."</p>

<p>"My impression is," said d'Ardeche, "that the brazen room was a
kind of sanctuary containing some image or other on the basalt
base,while the stone in front was really an altar,--what the nature
of the sacrifice might be I don't even guess. The round room may have
been used for invocations and incantations. The pentagram looks like
it. Any way it is all just about as queer and fin de si&egrave;cle as
I can well imagine. Look here, it is nearly twelve, let's dispose of
ourselves, if we are going to hunt this thing down."</p>

<p>The four chambers on this floor of the old house were those said
to be haunted, the wings being quite innocent, and, so far as we
knew, the floors below. It was arranged that we should each occupy a
room, leaving the doors open with the lights burning, and at the
slightest cry or knock we were all to rush at once to the room from
which the warning sound might come. There was no communication
between the rooms to be sure, but, as the doors all opened into the
corridor, every sound was plainly audible.</p>

<p>The last room fell to me, and I looked it over carefully.</p>

<p>It seemed innocent enough, a commonplace, square, rather lofty
Parisian sleeping-room, finished in wood painted white, with a small
marble mantel, a dusty floor of inlaid maple and cherry, walls hung
with an ordinary French paper, apparently quite new, and two deeply
embrasured windows looking out on the court.</p>

<p>I opened the swinging sash with some trouble, and sat down in the
window seat with my lantern beside me trained on the only door, which
gave on the corridor.</p>

<p>The wind had gone down, and it was very still without,--still and
hot. The masses of luminous vapor were gathering thickly overhead, no
longer urged by the gusty wind. The great masses of rank wisteria
leaves, with here and there a second blossoming of purple flowers,
hung dead over the window in the sluggish air. Across the roofs I
could hear the sound of a belated fiacre in the streets below. I
filled my pipe again and waited.</p>

<p>For a time the voices of the men in the other rooms were a
companionship, and at first I shouted to them now and then, but my
voice echoed rather unpleasantly through the long corridors, and had
a suggestive way of reverberating around the left wing beside me, and
coming out at a broken window at its extremity like the voice of
another man. I soon gave up my attempts at conversation, and devoted
myself to the task of keeping awake.</p>

<p>It was not easy; why did I eat that lettuce salad at P&egrave;re
Garceau's? I should have known better. It was making me irresistibly
sleepy, and wakefulness was absolutely necessary. It was certainly
gratifying to know that I could sleep, that my courage was by me to
that extent, but in the interests of science I must keep awake. But
almost never, it seemed, had sleep looked so desirable. Half a
hundred times, nearly, I would doze for an instant, only to awake
with a start, and find my pipe gone out. Nor did the exertion of
relighting it pull me together. I struck my match mechanically, and
with the first puff dropped off again. It was most vexing. I got up
and walked around the room. It was most annoying. My cramped position
had almost put both my legs to sleep. I could hardly stand. I felt
numb, as though with cold. There was no longer any sound from the
other rooms, nor from without. I sank down in my window seat. How
dark it was growing! I turned up the lantern. That pipe again, how
obstinately it kept going out! and my last match was gone. The
lantern, too, was that going out? I lifted my hand to turn it up
again. It felt like lead, and fell beside me.</p>

<p>Then I awoke,--absolutely. I remembered the story of "The Haunters
and the Haunted." This was the Horror. I tried to rise, to cry out.
My body was like lead, my tongue was paralyzed. I could hardly move
my eyes. And the light was going out. There was no question about
that. Darker and darker yet; little by little the pattern of the
paper was swallowed up in the advancing night. A prickling numbness
gathered in every nerve, my right arm slipped without feeling from my
lap to my side, and I could not raise it,--it swung helpless. A thin,
keen humming began in my head, like the cicadas on a hillside in
September. The darkness was coming fast.</p>

<p>Yes, this was it. Something was subjecting me, body and mind, to
slow paralysis. Physically I was already dead. If I could only hold
my mind, my consciousness, I might still be safe, but could I? Could
I resist the mad horror of this silence, the deepening dark, the
creeping numbness? I knew that, like the man in the ghost story, my
only safety lay here.</p>

<p>It had come at last. My body was dead, I could no longer move my
eyes. They were fixed in that last look on the place where the door
had been, now only a deepening of the dark.</p>

<p>Utter night: the last flicker of the lantern was gone. I sat and
waited; my mind was still keen, but how long would it last? There was
a limit even to the endurance of the utter panic of fear.</p>

<p>Then the end began. In the velvet blackness came two white eyes,
milky, opalescent, small, faraway,--awful eyes, like a dead dream.
More beautiful than I can describe, the flakes of white flame moving
from the perimeter inward, disappearing in the centre, like a never
ending flow of opal water into a circular tunnel. I could not have
moved my eyes had I possessed the power: they devoured the fearful,
beautiful things that grew slowly, slowly larger, fixed on me,
advancing, growing more beautiful, the white flakes of light sweeping
more swiftly into the blazing vortices, the awful fascination
deepening in its insane intensity as the white, vibrating eyes grew
nearer, larger.</p>

<p>Like a hideous and implacable engine of death the eyes of the
unknown Horror swelled and expanded until they were close before me,
enormous, terrible, and I felt a slow, cold, wet breath propelled
with mechanical regularity against my face, enveloping me in its
fetid mist, in its charnel-house deadliness.</p>

<p>With ordinary fear goes always a physical terror, but with me in
the presence of this unspeakable Thing was only the utter and awful
terror of the mind, the mad fear of a prolonged and ghostly
nightmare. Again and again I tried to shriek, to make some noise, but
physically I was utterly dead. I could only feel myself go mad with
the terror of hideous death. The eyes were close on me,--their
movement so swift that they seemed to be but palpitating flames, the
dead breath was around me like the depths of the deepest sea.</p>

<p>Suddenly a wet, icy mouth, like that of a dead cuttle-fish,
shapeless, jelly-like, fell over mine. The horror began slowly to
draw my life from me, but, as enormous and shuddering folds of
palpitating jelly swept sinuously around me, my will came back, my
body awoke with the reaction of final fear, and I closed with the
nameless death that enfolded me.</p>

<p>What was it that I was fighting? My arms sunk through the
unresisting mass that was turning me to ice. Moment by moment new
folds of cold jelly swept round me, crushing me with the force of
Titans. I fought to wrest my mouth from this awful Thing that sealed
it, but, if ever I succeeded and caught a single breath, the wet,
sucking mass closed over my face again before I could cry out. I
think I fought for hours, desperately, insanely, in a silence that
was more hideous than any sound,--fought until I felt final death at
hand, until the memory of all my life rushed over me like a flood,
until I no longer had strength to wrench my face from that hellish
succubus, until with a last mechanical struggle I fell and yielded to
death.</p>

<p>Then I heard a voice say, "If he is dead, I can never forgive
myself; I was to blame."</p>

<p>Another replied, "He is not dead, I know we can save him if only
we reach the hospital in time. Drive like hell, cocher! twenty francs
for you, if you get there in three minutes."</p>

<p>Then there was night again, and nothingness, until I suddenly
awoke and stared around. I lay in a hospital ward--very white and
sunny, some yellow fleurs-de-lis stood beside the head of the pallet,
and a tall sister of mercy sat by my side.</p>

<p>To tell the story in a few words, I was in the H&ocirc;tel Dieu,
where the men had taken me that fearful night of the twelfth of June.
I asked for Fargeau or Duchesne, and by and by the latter came, and
sitting beside the bed told me all that I did not know.</p>

<p>It seems that they had sat, each in his room, hour after hour,
hearing nothing, very much bored, and disappointed. Soon after two
o'clock Fargeau, who was in the next room, called to me to ask if I
was awake. I gave no reply, and, after shouting once or twice, he
took his lantern and came to investigate. The door was locked on the
inside! He instantly called d'Ardeche and Duchesne, and together they
hurled themselves against the door. It resisted. Within they could
hear irregular footsteps dashing here and there, with heavy
breathing. Although frozen with terror, they fought to destroy the
door and finally succeeded by using a great slab of marble that
formed the shelf of the mantel in Fargeau's room. As the door crashed
in, they were suddenly hurled back against the walls of the corridor,
as though by an explosion, the lanterns were extinguished, and they
found themselves in utter silence and darkness.</p>

<p>As soon as they recovered from the shock, they leaped into the
room and fell over my body in the middle of the floor. They lighted
one of the lanterns, and saw the strangest sight that can be
imagined. The floor and walls to the height of about six feet were
running with something that seemed like stagnant water, thick,
glutinous, sickening. As for me, I was drenched with the same cursed
liquid. The odor of musk was nauseating. They dragged me away,
stripped off my clothing, wrapped me in their coats, and hurried to
the hospital, thinking me perhaps dead. Soon after sunrise d'Ardeche
left the hospital, being assured that I was in a fair way to
recovery, with time, and with Fargeau went up to examine by daylight
the traces of the adventure that was so nearly fatal. They were too
late. Fire engines were coming down the street as they passed the
Acad&eacute;mie. A neighbor rushed up to d'Ardeche: "O Monsieur! what
misfortune, yet what fortune! It is true la Bouche d'Enfer--I beg
pardon, the residence of the lamented Mlle. de Tartas,--was burned,
but not wholly, only the ancient building. The wings were saved, and
for that great credit is due the brave firemen. Monsieur will
remember them, no doubt."</p>

<p>It was quite true. Whether a forgotten lantern, overturned in the
excitement, had done the work, or whether the origin of the fire was
more supernatural, it was certain that "the Mouth of Hell" was no
more. A last engine was pumping slowly as D'Ardeche came up; half a
dozen limp, and one distended, hose stretched through the porte
coch&egrave;re, and within only the fa&ccedil;ade of Francis I.
remained, draped still with the black stems of the wisteria. Beyond
lay a great vacancy, where thin smoke was rising slowly. Every floor
was gone, and the strange halls of Mlle. Blaye de Tartas were only a
memory.</p>

<p>With d'Ardeche I visited the place last year, but in the stead of
the ancient walls was then only a new and ordinary building, fresh
and respectable; yet the wonderful stories of the old Bouche d'Enfer
still lingered in the quarter, and will hold there, I do not doubt,
until the Day of Judgment.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4"></a>The Dead Valley</h2>

<p>I have a friend, Olof Ehrensv&auml;rd, a Swede by birth, who yet,
by reason of a strange and melancholy mischance of his early boyhood,
has thrown his lot with that of the New World. It is a curious story
of a headstrong boy and a proud and relentless family: the details do
not matter here, but they are sufficient to weave a web of romance
around the tall yellow-bearded man with the sad eyes and the voice
that gives itself perfectly to plaintive little Swedish songs
remembered out of childhood. In the winter evenings we play chess
together, he and I, and after some close, fierce battle has been
fought to a finish--usually with my own defeat--we fill our pipes
again, and Ehrensv&auml;rd tells me stories of the far,
half-remembered days in the fatherland, before he went to sea:
stories that grow very strange and incredible as the night deepens
and the fire falls together, but stories that, nevertheless, I fully
believe.</p>

<p>One of them made a strong impression on me, so I set it down here,
only regretting that I cannot reproduce the curiously perfect English
and the delicate accent which to me increased the fascination of the
tale. Yet, as best I can remember it, here it is.</p>

<p>"I never told you how Nils and I went over the hills to Hallsberg,
and how we found the Dead Valley, did I? Well, this is the way it
happened. I must have been about twelve years old, and Nils
Sj&ouml;berg, whose father's estate joined ours, was a few months
younger. We were inseparable just at that time, and whatever we did,
we did together.</p>

<p>"Once a week it was market day in Engelholm, and Nils and I went
always there to see the strange sights that the market gathered from
all the surrounding country. One day we quite lost our hearts, for an
old man from across the Elfborg had brought a little dog to sell,
that seemed to us the most beautiful dog in all the world. He was a
round, woolly puppy, so funny that Nils and I sat down on the ground
and laughed at him, until he came and played with us in so jolly a
way that we felt that there was only one really desirable thing in
life, and that was the little dog of the old man from across the
hills. But alas! we had not half money enough wherewith to buy him,
so we were forced to beg the old man not to sell him before the next
market day, promising that we would bring the money for him then. He
gave us his word, and we ran home very fast and implored our mothers
to give us money for the little dog.</p>

<p>"We got the money, but we could not wait for the next market day.
Suppose the puppy should be sold! The thought frightened us so that
we begged and implored that we might be allowed to go over the hills
to Hallsberg where the old man lived, and get the little dog
ourselves, and at last they told us we might go. By starting early in
the morning we should reach Hallsberg by three o'clock, and it was
arranged that we should stay there that night with Nils's aunt, and,
leaving by noon the next day, be home again by sunset.</p>

<p>"Soon after sunrise we were on our way, after having received
minute instructions as to just what we should do in all possible and
impossible circumstances, and finally a repeated injunction that we
should start for home at the same hour the next day, so that we might
get safely back before nightfall.</p>

<p>"For us, it was magnificent sport, and we started off with our
rifles, full of the sense of our very great importance yet the
journey was simple enough, along a good road, across the big hills we
knew so well, for Nils and I had shot over half the territory this
side of the dividing ridge of the Elfborg. Back of Engelholm lay a
long valley, from which rose the low mountains, and we had to cross
this, and then follow the road along the side of the hills for three
or four miles, before a narrow path branched off to the left, leading
up through the pass.</p>

<p>"Nothing occurred of interest on the way over, and we reached
Hallsberg in due season, found to our inexpressible joy that the
little dog was not sold, secured him, and so went to the house of
Nils's aunt to spend the night.</p>

<p>"Why we did not leave early on the following day, I can't quite
remember; at all events, I know we stopped at a shooting range just
outside of the town, where most attractive paste-board pigs were
sliding slowly through painted foliage, serving so as beautiful
marks. The result was that we did not get fairly started for home
until afternoon, and as we found ourselves at last pushing up the
side of the mountain with the sun dangerously near their summits, I
think we were a little scared at the prospect of the examination and
possible punishment that awaited us when we got home at
midnight."</p>

<p>"Therefore we hurried as fast as possible up the mountain side,
while the blue dusk closed in about us, and the light died in the
purple sky. At first we had talked hilariously, and the little dog
had leaped ahead of us with the utmost joy. Latterly, however, a
curious oppression came on us; we did not speak or even whistle,
while the dog fell behind, following us with hesitation in every
muscle."</p>

<p>"We had passed through the foothills and the low spurs of the
mountains, and were almost at the top of the main range, when life
seemed to go out of everything, leaving the world dead, so suddenly
silent the forest became, so stagnant the air. Instinctively we
halted to listen."</p>

<p>"Perfect silence,--the crushing silence of deep forests at night;
and more, for always, even in the most impenetrable fastnesses of the
wooded mountains, is the multitudinous murmur of little lives,
awakened by the darkness, exaggerated and intensified by the
stillness of the air and the great dark but here and now the silence
seemed unbroken even by the turn of a leaf, the movement of a twig,
the note of night bird or insect. I could hear the blood beat through
my veins; and the crushing of the grass under our feet as we advanced
with hesitating steps sounded like the falling of trees."</p>

<p>"And the air was stagnant,--dead. The atmosphere seemed to lie
upon the body like the weight of sea on a diver who has ventured too
far into its awful depths. What we usually call silence seems so only
in relation to the din of ordinary experience. This was silence in
the absolute, and it crushed the mind while it intensified the
senses, bringing down the awful weight of inextinguishable fear."</p>

<p>"I know that Nils and I stared towards each other in abject
terror, listening to our quick, heavy breathing, that sounded to our
acute senses like the fitful rush of waters. And the poor little dog
we were leading justified our terror. The black oppression seemed to
crush him even as it did us."</p>

<p>"He lay close on the ground, moaning feebly, and dragging himself
painfully and slowly closer to Nils's feet. I think this exhibition
of utter animal fear was the last touch, and must inevitably have
blasted our reason--mine anyway; but just then, as we stood quaking
on the bounds of madness, came a sound, so awful, so ghastly, so
horrible, that it seemed to rouse us from the dead spell that was on
us."</p>

<p>"In the depth of the silence came a cry, beginning as a low,
sorrowful moan, rising to a tremulous shriek, culminating in a yell
that seemed to tear the night in sunder and rend the world as by a
cataclysm. So fearful was it that I could not believe it had actual
existence: it passed previous experience, the powers of belief, and
for a moment I thought it the result of my own animal terror, an
hallucination born of tottering reason..."A glance at Nils dispelled
this thought in a flash. In the pale light of the high stars he was
the embodiment of all possible human fear, quaking with an ague, his
jaw fallen, his tongue out, his eyes protruding like those of a
hanged man. Without a word we fled, the panic of fear giving us
strength, and together, the little dog caught close in Nils's arms,
we sped down the side of the cursed mountains,--anywhere, goal was of
no account: we had but one impulse--to get away from that place."</p>

<p>"So under the black trees and the far white stars that flashed
through the still leaves overhead, we leaped down the mountain side,
regardless of path or landmark, straight through the tangled
underbrush, across mountain streams, through fens and copses,
anywhere, so only that our course was downward."</p>

<p>"How long we ran thus, I have no idea, but by and by the forest
fell behind, and we found ourselves among the foothills, and fell
exhausted on the dry short grass, panting like tired dogs."</p>

<p>"It was lighter here in the open, and presently we looked around
to see where we were, and how we were to strike out in order to find
the path that would lead us home. We looked in vain for a familiar
sign. Behind us rose the great wall of black forest on the flank of
the mountain: before us lay the undulating mounds of low foothills,
unbroken by trees or rocks, and beyond, only the fall of black sky
bright with multitudinous stars that turned its velvet depth to a
luminous gray."</p>

<p>"As I remember, we did not speak to each other once: the terror
was too heavy on us for that, but by and by we rose simultaneously
and started out across the hills."</p>

<p>"Still the same silence, the same dead, motionless air--air that
was at once sultry and chilling: a heavy heat struck through with an
icy chill that felt almost like the burning of frozen steel. Still
carrying the helpless dog, Nils pressed on through the hills, and I
followed close behind. At last, in front of us, rose slope of moor
touching the white stars. We climbed it wearily, reached the top, and
found ourselves gazing down into a great, smooth valley, filled half
way to the brim with--what?"</p>

<p>"As far as the eye could see stretched a level plain of ashy
white, faintly phosphorescent, a sea of velvet fog that lay like
motionless water, or rather like a floor of alabaster, so dense did
it appear, so seemingly capable of sustaining weight. If it were
possible, I think that sea of dead white mist struck even greater
terror into my soul than the heavy silence or the deadly cry--so
ominous was it, so utterly unreal, so phantasmal, so impossible, as
it lay there like a dead ocean under the steady stars. Yet through
that mist we must go! there seemed no other way home, and, shattered
with abject fear, mad with the one desire to get back, we started
down the slope to where the sea of milky mist ceased, sharp and
distinct around the stems of the rough grass."</p>

<p>"I put one foot into the ghostly fog. A chill as of death struck
through me, stopping my heart, and I threw myself backward on the
slope. At that instant came again the shriek, close, close, right in
our ears, in ourselves, and far out across that damnable sea I saw
the cold fog lift like a water-spout and toss itself high in writhing
convolutions towards the sky. The stars began to grow dim as thick
vapor swept across them, and in the growing dark I saw a great,
watery moon lift itself slowly above the palpitating sea, vast and
vague in the gathering mist."</p>

<p>"This was enough: we turned and fled along the margin of the white
sea that throbbed now with fitful motion below us, rising, rising,
slowly and steadily, driving us higher and higher up the side of the
foothills."</p>

<p>"It was a race for life; that we knew. How we kept it up I cannot
understand, but we did, and at last we saw the white sea fall behind
us as we staggered up the end of the valley, and then down into a
region that we knew, and so into the old path. The last thing I
remember was hearing a strange voice, that of Nils, but horribly
changed, stammer brokenly, 'The dog is dead!' and then the whole
world turned around twice, slowly and resistlessly, and consciousness
went out with a crash."</p>

<p>"It was some three weeks later, as I remember, that I awoke in my
own room, and found my mother sitting beside the bed. I could not
think very well at first, but as I slowly grew strong again, vague
flashes of recollection began to come to me, and little by little the
whole sequence of events of that awful night in the Dead Valley came
back. All that I could gain from what was told me was that three
weeks before I had been found in my own bed, raging sick, and that my
illness grew fast into brain fever. I tried to speak of the dread
things that had happened to me, but I saw at once that no one looked
on them save as the hauntings of a dying frenzy, and so I closed my
mouth and kept my own counsel."</p>

<p>"I must see Nils, however, and so I asked for him. My mother told
me that he also had been ill with a strange fever, but that he was
now quite well again. Presently they brought him in, and when we were
alone I began to speak to him of the night on the mountain. I shall
never forget the shock that struck me down on my pillow when the boy
denied everything: denied having gone with me, ever having heard the
cry, having seen the valley, or feeling the deadly chill of the
ghostly fog. Nothing would shake his determined ignorance, and in
spite of myself I was forced to admit that his denials came from no
policy of concealment, but from blank oblivion."</p>

<p>"My weakened brain was in a turmoil. Was it all but the floating
phantasm of delirium? Or had the horror of the real thing blotted
Nils's mind into blankness so far as the events of the night in the
Dead Valley were concerned? The latter explanation seemed the only
one, else how explain the sudden illness which in a night had struck
us both down? I said nothing more, either to Nils or to my own
people, but waited, with a growing determination that, once well
again, I would find that valley if it really existed."</p>

<p>"It was some weeks before I was really well enough to go, but
finally, late in September, I chose a bright, warm, still day, the
last smile of the dying summer, and started early in the morn-ing
along the path that led to Hallsberg. I was sure I knew where the
trail struck off to the right, down which we had come from the valley
of dead water, for a great tree grew by the Hallsberg path at the
point where, with a sense of salvation, we had found the home road.
Presently I saw it to the right, a little distance ahead."</p>

<p>"I think the bright sunlight and the clear air had worked as a
tonic to me, for by the time I came to the foot of the great pine, I
had quite lost faith in the verity of the vision that haunted me,
believing at last that it was indeed but the nightmare of madness.
Nevertheless, I turned sharply to the right, at the base of the tree,
into a narrow path that led through a dense thicket. As I did so I
tripped over something. A swarm of flies sung into the air around me,
and looking down I saw the matted fleece, with the poor little bones
thrusting through, of the dog we had bought in Hallsberg."</p>

<p>"Then my courage went out with a puff, and I knew that it all was
true, and that now I was frightened. Pride and the desire for
adventure urged me on, however, and I pressed into the close thicket
that barred my way. The path was hardly visible: merely the worn road
of some small beasts, for, though it showed in the crisp grass, the
bushes above grew thick and hardly penetrable. The land rose slowly,
and rising grew clearer, until at last I came out on a great slope of
hill, unbroken by trees or shrubs, very like my memory of that rise
of land we had topped in order that we might find the dead valley and
the icy fog. I looked at the sun; it was bright and clear, and all
around insects were humming in the autumn air, and birds were darting
to and fro...Surely there was no danger, not until nightfall at
least; so I began to whistle, and with a rush mounted the last crest
of brown hill."</p>

<p>"There lay the Dead Valley! A great oval basin, almost as smooth
and regular as though made by man. On all sides the grass crept over
the brink of the encircling hills, dusty green on the crests, then
fading into ashy brown, and so to a deadly white, this last color
forming a thin ring, running in a long line around the slope. And
then? Nothing. Bare, brown, hard earth, glittering with grains of
alkali, but otherwise dead and barren. Not a tuft of grass, not a
stick of brushwood, not even a stone, but only the vast expanse of
beaten clay."</p>

<p>"In the midst of the basin, perhaps a mile and a half away, the
level expanse was broken by a great dead tree, rising leafless and
gaunt into the air. Without a moment's hesitation I started down into
the valley and made for this goal. Every particle of fear seemed to
have left me, and even the valley itself did not look so very
terrifying. At all events, I was driven by an overwhelming curiosity,
and there seemed to be but one thing in the world to do,--to get to
that Tree! As I trudged along over the hard earth, I noticed that the
multitudinous voices of birds and insects had died away. No bee or
butterfly hovered through the air, no insects leaped or crept over
the dull earth. The very air itself was stagnant.</p>

<p>"As I drew near the skeleton tree, I noticed the glint of sunlight
on a kind of white mound around its roots, and I wondered curiously.
It was not until I had come close that I saw its nature."</p>

<p>"All around the roots and barkless trunk was heaped a wilderness
of little bones. Tiny skulls of rodents and of birds, thousands of
them, rising about the dead tree and streaming off for several yards
in all directions, until the dreadful pile ended in isolated skulls
and scattered skeletons."</p>

<p>Here and there a larger bone appeared,--the thigh of a sheep, the
hoofs of a horse, and to one side, grinning slowly, a human
skull.</p>

<p>"I stood quite still, staring with all my eyes, when suddenly the
dense silence was broken by a faint, forlorn cry high over my head. I
looked up and saw a great falcon turning and sailing downward just
over the tree. In a moment more she fell motionless on the bleaching
bones."</p>

<p>"Horror struck me, and I rushed for home, my brain whirling, a
strange numbness growing in me. I ran steadily, on and on. At last I
glanced up. Where was the rise of hill? I looked around wildly. Close
before me was the dead tree with its pile of bones. I had circled it
round and round, and the valley wall was still a mile and a half
away."</p>

<p>"I stood dazed and frozen. The sun was sinking, red and dull,
towards the line of hills. In the east the dark was growing fast. Was
there still time? Time! It was not that I wanted, it was will!"</p>

<p>"My feet seemed clogged as in a nightmare. I could hardly drag
them over the barren earth. And then I felt the slow chill creeping
through me. I looked down. Out of the earth a thin mist was rising,
collecting in little pools that grew ever larger until they joined
here and there, their currents swirling slowly like thin blue smoke.
The western hills halved the copper sun. When it was dark I should
hear that shriek again, and then I should die. I knew that, and with
every remaining atom of will I staggered towards the red west through
the writhing mist that crept clammily around my ankles, retarding my
steps."</p>

<p>"And as I fought my way off from the Tree, the horror grew, until
at last I thought I was going to die. The silence pursued me like
dumb ghosts, the still air held my breath, the hellish fog caught at
my feet like cold hands."</p>

<p>"But I won! though not a moment too soon. As I crawled on my hands
and knees up the brown slope, I heard, far away and high in the air,
the cry that already had almost bereft me of reason. It was faint and
vague, but unmistakable in its horrible intensity. I glanced behind.
The fog was the dense and pallid, heaving undulously up the brown
slope. The sky was gold under the setting sun, but below was the ashy
gray of death. I stood for a moment on the brink of this sea of hell,
and then leaped down the slope. The sunset opened before me, the
night closed behind, and as I crawled home weak and tired, darkness
shut down on the Dead Valley."</p>
