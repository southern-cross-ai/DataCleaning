<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>The Monster</h2>

<h3>Chapter I.</h3>

<p>LITTLE JIM was, for the time, engine Number 36, and he was
making the run between Syracuse and Rochester. He was fourteen
minutes behind time, and the throttle was wide open. In
consequence, when he swung around the curve at the flower-bed, a
wheel of his cart destroyed a peony. Number 36 slowed down at once
and looked guiltily at his father, who was mowing the lawn. The
doctor had his back to this accident, and he continued to pace
slowly to and fro, pushing the mower.</p>

<p>Jim dropped the tongue of the cart. He looked at his father and
at the broken flower. Finally he went to the peony and tried to
stand it on its pins, resuscitated, but the spine of it was hurt,
and it would only hang limply from his hand. Jim could do no
reparation. He looked again toward his father.</p>

<p>He went on to the lawn, very slowly, and kicking wretchedly at
the turf. Presently his father came along with the whirring
machine, while the sweet new grass blades spun from the knives. In
a low voice, Jim said, "Pa!"</p>

<p>The doctor was shaving this lawn as if it were a priest's chin.
All during the season he had worked at it in the coolness and peace
of the evenings after supper. Even in the shadow of the
cherry-trees the grass was strong and healthy. Jim raised his voice
a trifle. "Pa!"</p>

<p>The doctor paused, and with the howl of the machine no longer
occupying the sense, one could hear the robins in the cherry-trees
arranging their affairs. Jim's hands were behind his back, and
sometimes his fingers clasped and unclasped. Again he said, "Pa!"
The child's fresh and rosy lip was lowered.</p>

<p>The doctor stared down at his son, thrusting his head forward
and frowning attentively. "What is it, Jimmie?"</p>

<p>"Pa!" repeated the child at length. Then he raised his finger
and pointed at the flower-bed. "There!"</p>

<p>"What?" said the doctor, frowning more. "What is it, Jim?"</p>

<p>After a period of silence, during which the child may have
undergone a severe mental tumult, he raised his finger and repeated
his former word&mdash;"There!" The father had respected this silence
with perfect courtesy. Afterward his glance carefully followed the
direction indicated by the child's finger, but he could see nothing
which explained to him. "I don't understand what you mean, Jimmie,"
he said.</p>

<p>It seemed that the importance of the whole thing had taken away
the boy's vocabulary. He could only reiterate, "There!"</p>

<p>The doctor mused upon the situation, but he could make nothing
of it. At last he said, "Come, show me."</p>

<p>Together they crossed the lawn toward the flower-bed. At some
yards from the broken peony Jimmie began to leg. "There!" The word
came almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Where?" said the doctor.</p>

<p>Jimmie kicked at the grass. "There!" he replied.</p>

<p>The doctor was obliged to go forward alone. After some trouble
he found the subject of the incident, the broken flower. Turning
then, he saw the child lurking at the rear and scanning his
countenance.</p>

<p>The father reflected. After a time he said, "Jimmie, come here."
With an infinite modesty of demeanor the child came forward.
"Jimmie, how did this happen?"</p>

<p>The child answered, "Now&mdash;I was playin' train&mdash;and&mdash;now&mdash;I
runned over it."</p>

<p>"You were doing what?"</p>

<p>"I was playin' train."</p>

<p>The father reflected again. "Well, Jimmie," he said, slowly, "I
guess you had better not play train any more today. Do you think
you had better?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Jimmie.</p>

<p>During the delivery of the judgment the child had not faced his
father, and afterward he went away, with his head lowered,
shuffling his feet.</p>

<h3>Chapter II.</h3>

<p>It was apparent from Jimmie's manner that he felt some kind of
desire to efface himself. He went down to the stable. Henry
Johnson, the negro who cared for the doctor's horses, was sponging
the buggy. He grinned fraternally when he saw Jimmie coming. These
two were pals. In regard to almost everything in life they seemed
to have minds precisely alike. Of course there were points of
emphatic divergence. For instance, it was plain from Henry's talk
that he was a very handsome negro, and he was known to be a light,
a weight, and an eminence in the suburb of the town, where lived
the larger number of the negroes, and obviously this glory was over
Jimmie's horizon; but he vaguely appreciated it and paid deference
to Henry for it mainly because Henry appreciated it and deferred to
himself. However, on all points of conduct as related to the
doctor, who was the moon, they were in complete but unexpressed
understanding. Whenever Jimmie became the victim of an eclipse he
went to the stable to solace himself with Henry's crimes. Henry,
with the elasticity of his race, could usually provide a sin to
place himself on a footing with the disgraced one. Perhaps he would
remember that he had forgotten to put the hitching strap in the
back of the buggy on some recent occasion, and had been reprimanded
by the doctor. Then these two would commune subtly and without
words concerning their moon, holding themselves sympathetically as
people who had committed similar treasons. On the other hand, Henry
would sometimes choose to absolutely repudiate this idea, and when
Jimmie appeared in his shame would bully him most virtuously,
preaching with assurance the precepts of the doctor's creed, and
pointing out to Jimmie all his abominations. Jimmie did not
discover that this was odious in his comrade. He accepted it and
lived in its shadow with humility, merely trying to conciliate the
saintly Henry with acts of deference. Won by this attitude, Henry
would sometimes allow the child to enjoy the felicity of squeezing
the sponge over a buggy-wheel, even when Jimmie was still gory from
unspeakable deeds.</p>

<p>Whenever Henry dwelt for a time in sackcloth, Jimmie did not
patronize him at all. This was a justice of his age, his condition.
He did not know. Besides, Henry could drive a horse, and Jimmie had
a full sense of this sublimity. Henry personally conducted the moon
during the splendid journeys through the country roads, where farms
spread on all sides, with sheep, cows, and other marvels
abounding.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jim!" said Henry, poising his sponge. Water was dripping
from the buggy. Sometimes the horses in the stalls stamped
thunderingly on the pine floor. There was an atmosphere of hay and
of harness.</p>

<p>For a minute Jimmie refused to take an interest in anything. He
was very downcast. He could not even feel the wonders of
wagon-washing. Henry, while at his work, narrowly observed him.</p>

<p>"Your pop done wallop yer, didn't he?" he said at last.</p>

<p>"No," said Jimmie, defensively; "he didn't."</p>

<p>After this casual remark Henry continued his labor, with a scowl
of occupation. Presently he said: "I done tol' yer many's th' time
not to go a-foolin' an' a-projjeckin' with them flowers. Yer pop
don' like it nohow." As a matter of fact, Henry had never mentioned
flowers to the boy.</p>

<p>Jimmie preserved a gloomy silence, so Henry began to use
seductive wiles in this affair of washing a wagon. It was not until
he began to spin a wheel on the tree, and the sprinkling water flew
everywhere, that the boy was visibly moved. He had been seated on
the sill of the carriage-house door, but at the beginning of this
ceremony he arose and circled toward the buggy, with an interest
that slowly consumed the remembrance of a late disgrace.</p>

<p>Johnson could then display all the dignity of a man whose duty
it was to protect Jimmie from a splashing. "Look out, boy! look
out! You done gwi' spile yer pants. I raikon your mommer don't 'low
this foolishness, she know it. I ain't gwi' have you round yere
spilin' yer pants, an' have Mis' Trescott light on me pressen'ly.
'Deed I ain't."</p>

<p>He spoke with an air of great irritation, but he was not annoyed
at all. This tone was merely a part of his importance. In reality
he was always delighted to have the child there to witness the
business of the stable. For one thing, Jimmie was invariably
overcome with reverence when he was told how beautifully a harness
was polished or a horse groomed. Henry explained each detail of
this kind with unction, procuring great joy from the child's
admiration.</p>

<h3>Chapter III.</h3>

<p>After Johnson had taken his supper in the kitchen, he went to
his loft in the carriage-house and dressed himself with much care.
No belle of a court circle could bestow more mind on a toilet than
did Johnson. On second thought, he was more like a priest arraying
himself for some parade of the church. As he emerged from his room
and sauntered down the carriage drive, no one would have suspected
him of ever having washed a buggy.</p>

<p>It was not altogether a matter of the lavender trousers, nor yet
the straw hat with its bright silk band. The change was somewhere
far in the interior of Henry. But there was no cake-walk hyperbole
in it. He was simply a quiet, well-bred gentleman of position,
wealth, and other necessary achievements out for an evening stroll,
and he had never washed a wagon in his life.</p>

<p>In the morning, when in his working-clothes, he had met a
friend&mdash;"Hello, Pete!" "Hello, Henry!" Now, in his effulgence, he
encountered this same friend. His bow was not at all haughty. If it
expressed anything, it expressed consummate
generosity&mdash;"Good-evenin', Misteh Washington." Pete, who was very
dirty, being at work in a potato-patch, responded in a mixture of
abasement and appreciation&mdash;"Good-evenin', Misteh Johnsing."</p>

<p>The shimmering blue of the electric arc-lamps was strong in the
main street of the town. At numerous points it was conquered by the
orange glare of the outnumbering gas-lights in the windows of
shops. Through this radiant lane moved a crowd, which culminated in
a throng before the post-office, awaiting the distribution of the
evening mails. Occasionally there came into it a shrill electric
street-car, the motor singing like a cageful of grasshoppers, and
possessing a great gong that clanged forth both warnings and simple
noise. At the little theatre, which was a varnish and red-plush
miniature of one of the famous New York theatres, a company of
strollers was to play East Lynne. The young men of the town were
mainly gathered at the corners, in distinctive groups, which
expressed various shades and lines of chumship, and had little to
do with any social gradations. There they discussed everything with
critical insight, passing the whole town in review as it swarmed in
the street. When the gongs of the electric cars ceased for a moment
to harry the ears, there could be heard the sound of the feet of
the leisurely crowd on the blue-stone pavement, and it was like the
peaceful evening lashing at the shore of a lake. At the foot of the
hill, where two lines of maples sentinelled the way, an electric
lamp glowed high among the embowering branches, and made most
wonderful shadow-etchings on the road below it.</p>

<p>When Johnson appeared amid the throng a member of one of the
profane groups at a corner instantly telegraphed news of this
extraordinary arrival to his companions. They hailed him. "Hello,
Henry! Going to walk for a cake to-night?"</p>

<p>"Ain't he smooth?"</p>

<p>"Why, you've got that cake right in your pocket, Henry!"</p>

<p>"Throw out your chest a little more."</p>

<p>Henry was not ruffled in any way by these quiet admonitions and
compliments. In reply he laughed a supremely good-natured,
chuckling laugh, which nevertheless expressed an underground
complacency of superior metal.</p>

<p>Young Griscom, the lawyer, was just emerging from Reifsnyder's
barber shop, rubbing his chin contentedly. On the steps he dropped
his hand and looked with wide eyes into the crowd. Suddenly he
bolted back into the shop. "Wow!" he cried to the parliament; "you
ought to see the coon that's coming!"</p>

<p>Reifsnyder and his assistant instantly poised their razors high
and turned toward the window. Two belathered heads reared from the
chairs. The electric shine in the street caused an effect like
water to them who looked through the glass from the yellow glamour
of Reifsnyder's shop. In fact, the people without resembled the
inhabitants of a great aquarium that here had a square pane in it.
Presently into this frame swam the graceful form of Henry
Johnson.</p>

<p>"Chee!" said Reifsnyder. He and his assistant with one accord
threw their obligations to the winds, and leaving their lathered
victims helpless, advanced to the window. "Ain't he a taisy?" said
Reifsnyder, marvelling.</p>

<p>But the man in the first chair, with a grievance in his mind,
had found a weapon. "Why, that's only Henry Johnson, you blamed
idiots! Come on now, Reif, and shave me. What do you think I am&mdash;a
mummy?"</p>

<p>Reifsnyder turned, in a great excitement. "I bait you any money
that vas not Henry Johnson! Henry Johnson! Rats!" The scorn put
into this last word made it an explosion. "That man vas a
Pullman-car porter or someding. How could that be Henry Johnson?"
he demanded, turbulently. "You vas crazy."</p>

<p>The man in the first chair faced the barber in a storm of
indignation. "Didn't I give him those lavender trousers?" he
roared.</p>

<p>And young Griscom, who had remained attentively at the window,
said: "Yes, I guess that was Henry. It looked like him."</p>

<p>"Oh, vell," said Reifsnyder, returning to his business, "if you
think so! Oh, vell!" He implied that he was submitting for the sake
of amiability.</p>

<p>Finally the man in the second chair, mumbling from a mouth made
timid by adjacent lather, said: "That was Henry Johnson all right.
Why, he always dresses like that when he wants to make a front!
He's the biggest dude in town&mdash;anybody knows that."</p>

<p>"Chinger!" said Reifsnyder.</p>

<p>Henry was not at all oblivious of the wake of wondering
ejaculation that streamed out behind him. On other occasions he had
reaped this same joy, and he always had an eye for the
demonstration. With a face beaming with happiness he turned away
from the scene of his victories into a narrow side street, where
the electric light still hung high, but only to exhibit a row of
tumble-down houses leaning together like paralytics.</p>

<p>The saffron Miss Bella Farragut, in a calico frock, had been
crouched on the front stoop, gossiping at long range, but she
espied her approaching caller at a distance. She dashed around the
corner of the house, galloping like a horse. Henry saw it all, but
he preserved the polite demeanor of a guest when a waiter spills
claret down his cuff. In this awkward situation he was simply
perfect.</p>

<p>The duty of receiving Mr. Johnson fell upon Mrs. Farragut,
because Bella, in another room, was scrambling wildly into her best
gown. The fat old woman met him with a great ivory smile, sweeping
back with the door, and bowing low. "Walk in, Misteh Johnson, walk
in. How is you dis ebenin', Misteh Johnson&mdash;how is you?"</p>

<p>Henry's face showed like a reflector as he bowed and bowed,
bending almost from his head to his ankles. "Good-evenin', Mis'
Fa'gut; good-evenin'. How is you dis evenin'? Is all you' folks
well, Mis' Fa'gut?"</p>

<p>After a great deal of kowtow, they were planted in two chairs
opposite each other in the living-room. Here they exchanged the
most tremendous civilities, until Miss Bella swept into the room,
when there was more kowtow on all sides, and a smiling show of
teeth that was like an illumination.</p>

<p>The cooking-stove was of course in this drawing-room, and on the
fire was some kind of a long-winded stew. Mrs. Farragut was obliged
to arise and attend to it from time to time. Also young Sim came in
and went to bed on his pallet in the corner. But to all these
domesticities the three maintained an absolute dumbness. They bowed
and smiled and ignored and imitated until a late hour, and if they
had been the occupants of the most gorgeous salon in the world they
could not have been more like three monkeys.</p>

<p>After Henry had gone, Bella, who encouraged herself in the
appropriation of phrases, said, "Oh, ma, isn't he divine?"</p>

<h3>Chapter IV.</h3>

<p>A Saturday evening was a sign always for a larger crowd to
parade the thoroughfare. In summer the band played until ten
o'clock in the little park. Most of the young men of the town
affected to be superior to this band, even to despise it; but in
the still and fragrant evenings they invariably turned out in
force, because the girls were sure to attend this concert,
strolling slowly over the grass, linked closely in pairs, or
preferably in threes, in the curious public dependence upon one
another which was their inheritance. There was no particular social
aspect to this gathering, save that group regarded group with
interest, but mainly in silence. Perhaps one girl would nudge
another girl and suddenly say, "Look! there goes Gertie Hodgson and
her sister!" And they would appear to regard this as an event of
importance.</p>

<p>On a particular evening a rather large company of young men were
gathered on the sidewalk that edged the park. They remained thus
beyond the borders of the festivities because of their dignity,
which would not exactly allow them to appear in anything which was
so much fun for the younger lads. These latter were careering madly
through the crowd, precipitating minor accidents from time to time,
but usually fleeing like mist swept by the wind before retribution
could lay its hands upon them.</p>

<p>The band played a waltz which involved a gift of prominence to
the bass horn, and one of the young men on the sidewalk said that
the music reminded him of the new engines on the hill pumping water
into the reservoir. A similarity of this kind was not
inconceivable, but the young man did not say it because he disliked
the band's playing. He said it because it was fashionable to say
that manner of thing concerning the band. However, over in the
stand, Billie Harris, who played the snare-drum, was always
surrounded by a throng of boys, who adored his every whack.</p>

<p>After the mails from New York and Rochester had been finally
distributed, the crowd from the post-office added to the mass
already in the park. The wind waved the leaves of the maples, and,
high in the air, the blue-burning globes of the arc lamps caused
the wonderful traceries of leaf shadows on the ground. When the
light fell upon the upturned face of a girl, it caused it to glow
with a wonderful pallor. A policeman came suddenly from the
darkness and chased a gang of obstreperous little boys. They hooted
him from a distance. The leader of the band had some of the
mannerisms of the great musicians, and during a period of silence
the crowd smiled when they saw him raise his hand to his brow,
stroke it sentimentally, and glance upward with a look of poetic
anguish. In the shivering light, which gave to the park an effect
like a great vaulted hall, the throng swarmed with a gentle murmur
of dresses switching the turf, and with a steady hum of voices.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without preliminary bars, there arose from afar the
great hoarse roar of a factory whistle. It raised and swelled to a
sinister note, and then it sang on the night wind one long call
that held the crowd in the park immovable, speechless. The
band-master had been about to vehemently let fall his hand to start
the band on a thundering career through a popular march, but,
smitten by this giant voice from the night, his hand dropped slowly
to his knee, and, his mouth agape, he looked at his men in silence.
The cry died away to a wail, and then to stillness. It released the
muscles of the company of young men on the sidewalk, who had been
like statues, posed eagerly, lithely, their ears turned. And then
they wheeled upon each other simultaneously, and, in a single
explosion, they shouted, "One!"</p>

<p>Again the sound swelled in the night and roared its long ominous
cry, and as it died away the crowd of young men wheeled upon each
other and, in chorus, yelled, "Two!"</p>

<p>There was a moment of breathless waiting. Then they bawled,
"Second district!" In a flash the company of indolent and cynical
young men had vanished like a snowball disrupted by dynamite.</p>

<h3>Chapter V.</h3>

<p>Jake Rogers was the first man to reach the home of Tuscarora
Hose Company Number Six. He had wrenched his key from his pocket as
he tore down the street, and he jumped at the spring-lock like a
demon. As the doors flew back before his hands he leaped and kicked
the wedges from a pair of wheels, loosened a tongue from its clasp,
and in the glare of the electric light which the town placed before
each of his hose-houses the next comers beheld the spectacle of
Jake Rogers bent like hickory in the manfulness of his pulling, and
the heavy cart was moving slowly towards the doors. Four men joined
him at the time, and as they swung with the cart out into the
street, dark figures sped towards them from the ponderous shadows
back of the electric lamps. Some set up the inevitable question,
"What district?"</p>

<p>"Second," was replied to them in a compact howl. Tuscarora Hose
Company Number Six swept on a perilous wheel into Niagara Avenue,
and as the men, attached to the cart by the rope which had been
paid out from the windlass under the tongue, pulled madly in their
fervor and abandon, the gong under the axle clanged incitingly. And
sometimes the same cry was heard, "What district?"</p>

<p>"Second."</p>

<p>On a grade Johnnie Thorpe fell, and exercising a singular
muscular ability, rolled out in time from the track of the
on-coming wheel, and arose, dishevelled and aggrieved, casting a
look of mournful disenchantment upon the black crowd that poured
after the machine. The cart seemed to be the apex of a dark wave
that was whirling as if it had been a broken dam. Back of the lad
were stretches of lawn, and in that direction front doors were
banged by men who hoarsely shouted out into the clamorous avenue,
"What district?"</p>

<p>At one of these houses a woman came to the door bearing a lamp,
shielding her face from its rays with her hands. Across the cropped
grass the avenue represented to her a kind of black torrent, upon
which, nevertheless, fled numerous miraculous figures upon
bicycles. She did not know that the towering light at the corner
was continuing its nightly whine.</p>

<p>Suddenly a little boy somersaulted around the corner of the
house as if he had been projected down a flight of stairs by a
catapultian boot. He halted himself in front of the house by dint
of a rather extraordinary evolution with his legs. "Oh, ma," he
gasped, "can I go? Can I, ma?"</p>

<p>She straightened with the coldness of the exterior
mother-judgment, although the hand that held the lamp trembled
slightly. "No, Willie; you had better come to bed."</p>

<p>Instantly he began to buck and fume like a mustang. "Oh, ma," he
cried, contorting himself&mdash;"oh, ma, can't I go? Please, ma, can't I
go? Can't I go, ma?"</p>

<p>"It's half past nine now, Willie."</p>

<p>He ended by wailing out a compromise: "Well, just down to the
corner, ma? Just down to the corner?"</p>

<p>From the avenue came the sound of rushing men who wildly
shouted. Somebody had grappled the bell-rope in the Methodist
church, and now over the town rang this solemn and terrible voice,
speaking from the clouds. Moved from its peaceful business, this
bell gained a new spirit in the portentous night, and it swung the
heart to and fro, up and down, with each peal of it.</p>

<p>"Just down to the corner, ma?"</p>

<p>"Willie, it's half past nine now."</p>

<h3>Chapter VI.</h3>

<p>The outlines of the house of Dr. Trescott had faded quietly into
the evening, hiding a shape such as we call Queen Anne against the
pall of the blackened sky. The neighborhood was at this time so
quiet, and seemed so devoid of obstructions, that Hannigan's dog
thought it a good opportunity to prowl in forbidden precincts, and
so came and pawed Trescott's lawn, growling, and considering
himself a formidable beast. Later, Peter Washington strolled past
the house and whistled, but there was no dim light shining from
Henry's loft, and presently Peter went his way. The rays from the
street, creeping in silvery waves over the grass, caused the row of
shrubs along the drive to throw a clear, bold shade.</p>

<p>A wisp of smoke came from one of the windows at the end of the
house and drifted quietly into the branches of a cherry-tree. Its
companions followed it in slowly increasing numbers, and finally
there was a current controlled by invisible banks which poured into
the fruit-laden boughs of the cherry-tree. It was no more to be
noted than if a troop of dim and silent gray monkeys had been
climbing a grape-vine into the clouds.</p>

<p>After a moment the window brightened as if the four panes of it
had been stained with blood, and a quick ear might have been led to
imagine the fire-imps calling and calling, clan joining clan,
gathering to the colors. From the street, however, the house
maintained its dark quiet, insisting to a passer-by that it was the
safe dwelling of people who chose to retire early to tranquil
dreams. No one could have heard this low droning of the gathering
clans.</p>

<p>Suddenly the panes of the red window tinkled and crashed to the
ground, and at other windows there suddenly reared other flames,
like bloody spectres at the apertures of a haunted house. This
outbreak had been well planned, as if by professional
revolutionists.</p>

<p>A man's voice suddenly shouted: "Fire! Fire! Fire!" Hannigan had
flung his pipe frenziedly from him because his lungs demanded room.
He tumbled down from his perch, swung over the fence, and ran
shouting towards the front door of the Trescotts'. Then he hammered
on the door, using his fists as if they were mallets. Mrs. Trescott
instantly came to one of the windows on the second floor.
Afterwards she knew she had been about to say, "The doctor is not
at home, but if you will leave your name, I will let him know as
soon as he comes."</p>

<p>Hannigan's bawling was for a minute incoherent, but she
understood that it was not about croup.</p>

<p>"What?" she said, raising the window swiftly.</p>

<p>"Your house is on fire! You're all ablaze! Move quick if&mdash;" His
cries were resounding in the street as if it were a cave of echoes.
Many feet pattered swiftly on the stones. There was one man who ran
with an almost fabulous speed. He wore lavender trousers. A straw
hat with a bright silk band was held half crumpled in his hand.</p>

<p>As Henry reached the front door, Hannigan had just broken the
lock with a kick. A thick cloud of smoke poured over them, and
Henry, ducking his head, rushed into it. From Hannigan's clamor he
knew only one thing, but it turned him blue with horror. In the
hall a lick of flame had found the cord that supported "Signing the
Declaration." The engraving slumped suddenly down at one end, and
then dropped to the floor, where it burst with the sound of a bomb.
The fire was already roaring like a winter wind among the
pines.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs Mrs. Trescott was waving her arms as
if they were two reeds. "Jimmie! Save Jimmie!" she screamed in
Henry's face. He plunged past her and disappeared, taking the
long-familiar routes among these upper chambers, where he had once
held office as a sort of second assistant house-maid.</p>

<p>Hannigan had followed him up the stairs, and grappled the arm of
the maniacal woman there. His face was black with rage. "You must
come down," he bellowed.</p>

<p>She would only scream at him in reply: "Jimmie! Jimmie! Save
Jimmie!" But he dragged her forth while she babbled at him.</p>

<p>As they swung out into the open air a man ran across the lawn,
and seizing a shutter, pulled it from its hinges and flung it far
out upon the grass. Then he frantically attacked the other shutters
one by one. It was a kind of temporary insanity.</p>

<p>"Here, you," howled Hannigan, "hold Mrs. Trescott&mdash;And
stop&mdash;"</p>

<p>The news had been telegraphed by a twist of the wrist of a
neighbor who had gone to the fire-box at the corner, and the time
when Hannigan and his charge struggled out of the house was the
time when the whistle roared its hoarse night call, smiting the
crowd in the park, causing the leader of the band, who was about to
order the first triumphal clang of a military march, to let his
hand drop slowly to his knees.</p>

<h3>Chapter VII.</h3>

<p>Henry pawed awkwardly through the smoke in the upper halls. He
had attempted to guide himself by the walls, but they were too hot.
The paper was crimpling, and he expected at any moment to have a
flame burst from under his hands.</p>

<p>"Jimmie!"</p>

<p>He did not call very loud, as if in fear that the humming flames
below would overhear him.</p>

<p>"Jimmie! Oh, Jimmie!"</p>

<p>Stumbling and panting, he speedily reached the entrance to
Jimmie's room and flung open the door. The little chamber had no
smoke in it at all. It was faintly illumined by a beautiful rosy
light reflected circuitously from the flames that were consuming
the house. The boy had apparently just been aroused by the noise.
He sat in his bed, his lips apart, his eyes wide, while upon his
little white-robed figure played caressingly the light from the
fire. As the door flew open he had before him this apparition of
his pal, a terror-stricken negro, all tousled and with wool
scorching, who leaped upon him and bore him up in a blanket as if
the whole affair were a case of kidnapping by a dreadful robber
chief. Without waiting to go through the usual short but complete
process of wrinkling up his face, Jimmie let out a gorgeous bawl,
which resembled the expression of a calf's deepest terror. As
Johnson, bearing him, reeled into the smoke of the hall, he flung
his arms about his neck and buried his face in the blanket. He
called twice in muffled tones: "Mam-ma! Mam-ma!"</p>

<p>When Johnson came to the top of the stairs with his burden, he
took a quick step backwards. Through the smoke that rolled to him
he could see that the lower hall was all ablaze. He cried out then
in a howl that resembled Jimmie's former achievement. His legs
gained a frightful faculty of bending sideways. Swinging about
precariously on these reedy legs, he made his way back slowly, back
along the upper hall. From the way of him then, he had given up
almost all idea of escaping from the burning house, and with it the
desire. He was submitting, submitting because of his fathers,
bending his mind in a most perfect slavery to this
conflagration.</p>

<p>He now clutched Jimmie as unconsciously as when, running toward
the house, he had clutched the hat with the bright silk band.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered a little private staircase which led from
a bedroom to an apartment which the doctor had fitted up as a
laboratory and work-house, where he used some of his leisure, and
also hours when he might have been sleeping, in devoting himself to
experiments which came in the way of his study and interest.</p>

<p>When Johnson recalled this stairway the submission to the blaze
departed instantly. He had been perfectly familiar with it, but his
confusion had destroyed the memory of it.</p>

<p>In his sudden momentary apathy there had been little that
resembled fear, but now, as a way of safety came to him, the old
frantic terror caught him. He was no longer creature to the flames,
and he was afraid of the battle with them. It was a singular and
swift set of alternations in which he feared twice without
submission, and submitted once without fear.</p>

<p>"Jimmie!" he wailed, as he staggered on his way. He wished this
little inanimate body at his breast to participate in his
tremblings. But the child had lain limp and still during these
headlong charges and countercharges, and no sign came from him.</p>

<p>Johnson passed through two rooms and came to the head of the
stairs. As he opened the door great billows of smoke poured out,
but gripping Jimmie closer, he plunged down through them. All
manner of odors assailed him during this flight. They seemed to be
alive with envy, hatred, and malice. At the entrance to the
laboratory he confronted a strange spectacle. The room was like a
garden in the region where might be burning flowers. Flames of
violet, crimson, green, blue, orange, and purple were blooming
everywhere. There was one blaze that was precisely the hue of a
delicate coral. In another place was a mass that lay merely in
phosphorescent inaction like a pile of emeralds. But all these
marvels were to be seen dimly through clouds of heaving, turning,
deadly smoke.</p>

<p>Johnson halted for a moment on the threshold. He cried out again
in the negro wail that had in it the sadness of the swamps. Then he
rushed across the room. An orange-colored flame leaped like a
panther at the lavender trousers. This animal bit deeply into
Johnson. There was an explosion at one side, and suddenly before
him there reared a delicate, trembling sapphire shape like a fairy
lady. With a quiet smile she blocked his path and doomed him and
Jimmie. Johnson shrieked, and then ducked in the manner of his race
in fights. He aimed to pass under the left guard of the sapphire
lady. But she was swifter than eagles, and her talons caught in him
as he plunged past her. Bowing his head as if his neck had been
struck, Johnson lurched forward, twisting this way and that way. He
fell on his back. The still form in the blanket flung from his
arms, rolled to the edge of the floor and beneath the window.</p>

<p>Johnson had fallen with his head at the base of an old-fashioned
desk. There was a row of jars upon the top of this desk. For the
most part, they were silent amid this rioting, but there was one
which seemed to hold a scintillant and writhing serpent.</p>

<p>Suddenly the glass splintered, and a ruby-red snakelike thing
poured its thick length out upon the top of the old desk. It coiled
and hesitated, and then began to swim a languorous way down the
mahogany slant. At the angle it waved its sizzling molten head to
and fro over the closed eyes of the man beneath it. Then, in a
moment, with mystic impulse, it moved again, and the red snake
flowed directly down into Johnson's upturned face.</p>

<p>Afterwards the trail of this creature seemed to reek, and amid
flames and low explosions drops like red-hot jewels pattered softly
down it at leisurely intervals.</p>

<h3>Chapter VIII.</h3>

<p>Suddenly all roads led to Dr. Trescott's. The whole town flowed
toward one point. Chippeway Hose Company Number One toiled
desperately up Bridge Street Hill even as the Tuscaroras came in an
impetuous sweep down Niagara Avenue. Meanwhile the machine of the
hook-and-ladder experts from across the creek was spinning on its
way. The chief of the fire department had been playing poker in the
rear room of Whiteley's cigar-store, but at the first breath of the
alarm he sprang through the door like a man escaping with the
kitty.</p>

<p>In Whilomville, on these occasions, there was always a number of
people who instantly turned their attention to the bells in the
churches and school-houses. The bells not only emphasized the
alarm, but it was the habit to send these sounds rolling across the
sky in a stirring brazen uproar until the flames were practically
vanquished. There was also a kind of rivalry as to which bell
should be made to produce the greatest din. Even the Valley Church,
four miles away among the farms, had heard the voices of its
brethren, and immediately added a quaint little yelp.</p>

<p>Doctor Trescott had been driving homeward, slowly smoking a
cigar, and feeling glad that this last case was now in complete
obedience to him, like a wild animal that he had subdued, when he
heard the long whistle, and chirped to his horse under the
unlicensed but perfectly distinct impression that a fire had broken
out in Oakhurst, a new and rather high-flying suburb of the town
which was at least two miles from his own home. But in the second
blast and in the ensuing silence he read the designation of his own
district. He was then only a few blocks from his house. He took out
the whip and laid it lightly on the mare. Surprised and frightened
at this extraordinary action, she leaped forward, and as the reins
straightened like steel bands, the doctor leaned backward a trifle.
When the mare whirled him up to the closed gate he was wondering
whose house could be afire. The man who had rung the signal-box
yelled something at him, but he already knew. He left the mare to
her will.</p>

<p>In front of his door was a maniacal woman in a wrapper. "Ned!"
she screamed at sight of him. "Jimmie! Save Jimmie!"</p>

<p>Trescott had grown hard and chill.</p>

<p>"Where?" he said. "Where?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Trescott's voice began to bubble. "Up&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;" She
pointed at the second-story windows.</p>

<p>Hannigan was already shouting: "Don't go in that way! You can't
go in that way!"</p>

<p>Trescott ran around the corner of the house and disappeared from
them. He knew from the view he had taken of the main hall that it
would be impossible to ascend from there. His hopes were fastened
now to the stairway which led from the laboratory. The door which
opened from this room out upon the lawn was fastened with a bolt
and lock, but he kicked close to the lock and then close to the
bolt. The door with a loud crash flew back. The doctor recoiled
from the roll of smoke, and then bending low, he stepped into the
garden of burning flowers. On the floor his stinging eyes could
make out a form in a smouldering blanket near the window. Then, as
he carried his son toward the door, he saw that the whole lawn
seemed now alive with men and boys, the leaders in the great charge
that the whole town was making. They seized him and his burden, and
overpowered him in wet blankets and water.</p>

<p>But Hannigan was howling: "Johnson is in there yet! Henry
Johnson is in there yet! He went in after the kid! Johnson is in
there yet!"</p>

<p>These cries penetrated to the sleepy senses of Trescott, and he
struggled with his captors, swearing unknown to him and to them,
all the deep blasphemies of his medical-student days. He arose to
his feet and went again toward the door of the laboratory. They
endeavored to restrain him, although they were much affrighted at
him.</p>

<p>But a young man who was a brakeman on the railway, and lived in
one of the rear streets near the Trescotts, had gone into the
laboratory and brought forth a thing which he laid on the
grass.</p>

<h3>Chapter IX.</h3>

<p>There were hoarse commands from in front of the house. "Turn on
your water, Five!" "Let 'er go, One!" The gathering crowd swayed
this way and that way. The flames, towering high, cast a wild red
light on their faces. There came the clangor of a gong from along
some adjacent street. The crowd exclaimed at it. "Here comes Number
Three!" "That's Three a-comin'!" A panting and irregular mob dashed
into view, dragging a hose-cart. A cry of exultation arose from the
little boys. "Here's Three!" The lads welcomed Never-Die Hose
Company Number Three as if it was composed of a chariot dragged by
a band of gods. The perspiring citizens flung themselves into the
fray. The boys danced in impish joy at the displays of prowess.
They acclaimed the approach of Number Two. They welcomed Number
Four with cheers. They were so deeply moved by this whole affair
that they bitterly guyed the late appearance of the hook and ladder
company, whose heavy apparatus had almost stalled them on the
Bridge Street hill. The lads hated and feared a fire, of course.
They did not particularly want to have anybody's house burn, but
still it was fine to see the gathering of the companies, and amid a
great noise to watch their heroes perform all manner of
prodigies.</p>

<p>They were divided into parties over the worth of different
companies, and supported their creeds with no small violence. For
instance, in that part of the little city where Number Four had its
home it would be most daring for a boy to contend the superiority
of any other company. Likewise, in another quarter, when a strange
boy was asked which fire company was the best in Whilomville, he
was expected to answer "Number One." Feuds, which the boys forgot
and remembered according to chance or the importance of some recent
event, existed all through the town.</p>

<p>They did not care much for John Shipley, the chief of the
department. It was true that he went to a fire with the speed of a
falling angel, but when there he invariably lapsed into a certain
still mood, which was almost a preoccupation, moving leisurely
around the burning structure and surveying it, puffing meanwhile at
a cigar. This quiet man, who even when life was in danger seldom
raised his voice, was not much to their fancy. Now old Sykes
Huntington, when he was chief, used to bellow continually like a
bull and gesticulate in a sort of delirium. He was much finer as a
spectacle than this Shipley, who viewed a fire with the same
steadiness that he viewed a raise in a large jackpot. The greater
number of the boys could never understand why the members of these
companies persisted in re-electing Shipley, although they often
pretended to understand it, because "My father says" was a very
formidable phrase in argument, and the fathers seemed almost
unanimous in advocating Shipley.</p>

<p>At this time there was considerable discussion as to which
company had gotten the first stream of water on the fire. Most of
the boys claimed that Number Five owned that distinction, but there
was a determined minority who contended for Number One. Boys who
were the blood adherents of other companies were obliged to choose
between the two on this occasion, and the talk waxed warm.</p>

<p>But a great rumor went among the crowds. It was told with hushed
voices. Afterward a reverent silence fell even upon the boys.
Jimmie Trescott and Henry Johnson had been burned to death, and Dr.
Trescott himself had been most savagely hurt. The crowd did not
even feel the police pushing at them. They raised their eyes,
shining now with awe, toward the high flames.</p>

<p>The man who had information was at his best. In low tones he
described the whole affair. "That was the kid's room&mdash;in the corner
there. He had measles or somethin', and this coon&mdash;Johnson&mdash;was
a-settin' up with 'im, and Johnson got sleepy or somethin' and
upset the lamp, and the doctor he was down in his office, and he
came running up, and they all got burned together till they dragged
'em out."</p>

<p>Another man, always preserved for the deliverance of the final
judgment, was saying: "Oh, they'll die sure. Burned to flinders. No
chance. Hull lot of 'em. Anybody can see." The crowd concentrated
its gaze still more closely upon these flags of fire which waved
joyfully against the black sky. The bells of the town were clashing
unceasingly.</p>

<p>A little procession moved across the lawn and toward the street.
There were three cots, borne by twelve of the firemen. The police
moved sternly, but it needed no effort of theirs to open a lane for
this slow corte'ge. The men who bore the cots were well known to
the crowd, but in this solemn parade during the ringing of the
bells and the shouting, and with the red glare upon the sky, they
seemed utterly foreign, and Whilomville paid them a deep respect.
Each man in this stretcher party had gained a reflected majesty.
They were footmen to death, and the crowd made subtle obeisance to
this august dignity derived from three prospective graves. One
woman turned away with a shriek at sight of the covered body on the
first stretcher, and people faced her suddenly in silent and
mournful indignation. Otherwise there was barely a sound as these
twelve important men with measured tread carried their burdens
through the throng.</p>

<p>The little boys no longer discussed the merits of the different
fire companies. For the greater part they had been routed. Only the
more courageous viewed closely the three figures veiled in yellow
blankets.</p>

<h3>Chapter X.</h3>

<p>Old Judge Denning Hagenthorpe, who lived nearly opposite the
Trescotts, had thrown his door wide open to receive the afflicted
family. When it was publicly learned that the doctor and his son
and the negro were still alive, it required a specially detailed
policeman to prevent people from scaling the front porch and
interviewing these sorely wounded. One old lady appeared with a
miraculous poultice, and she quoted most damning scripture to the
officer when he said that she could not pass him. Throughout the
night some lads old enough to be given privileges or to compel them
from their mothers remained vigilantly upon the kerb in
anticipation of a death or some such event. The reporter of the
Morning Tribune rode thither on his bicycle every hour until three
o'clock.</p>

<p>Six of the ten doctors in Whilomville attended at Judge
Hagenthorpe's house.</p>

<p>Almost at once they were able to know that Trescott's burns were
not vitally important. The child would possibly be scarred badly,
but his life was undoubtedly safe. As for the negro Henry Johnson,
he could not live. His body was frightfully seared, but more than
that, he now had no face. His face had simply been burned away.</p>

<p>Trescott was always asking news of the two other patients. In
the morning he seemed fresh and strong, so they told him that
Johnson was doomed. They then saw him stir on the bed, and sprang
quickly to see if the bandages needed readjusting. In the sudden
glance he threw from one to another he impressed them as being both
leonine and impracticable.</p>

<p>The morning paper announced the death of Henry Johnson. It
contained a long interview with Edward J. Hannigan, in which the
latter described in full the performance of Johnson at the fire.
There was also an editorial built from all the best words in the
vocabulary of the staff. The town halted in its accustomed road of
thought, and turned a reverent attention to the memory of this
hostler. In the breasts of many people was the regret that they had
not known enough to give him a hand and a lift when he was alive,
and they judged themselves stupid and ungenerous for this
failure.</p>

<p>The name of Henry Johnson became suddenly the title of a saint
to the little boys. The one who thought of it first could, by
quoting it in an argument, at once overthrow his antagonist,
whether it applied to the subject or whether it did not. Nigger,
nigger, never die, Black face and shiny eye.</p>

<p>Boys who had called this odious couplet in the rear of Johnson's
march buried the fact at the bottom of their hearts.</p>

<p>Later in the day Miss Bella Farragut, of No. 7 Watermelon Alley,
announced that she had been engaged to marry Mr. Henry Johnson.</p>

<h3>Chapter XI.</h3>

<p>The old judge had a cane with an ivory head. He could never
think at his best until he was leaning slightly on this stick and
smoothing the white top with slow movements of his hands. It was
also to him a kind of narcotic. If by any chance he mislaid it, he
grew at once very irritable, and was likely to speak sharply to his
sister, whose mental incapacity he had patiently endured for thirty
years in the old mansion on Ontario Street. She was not at all
aware of her brother's opinion of her endowments, and so it might
be said that the judge had successfully dissembled for more than a
quarter of a century, only risking the truth at the times when his
cane was lost.</p>

<p>On a particular day the judge sat in his arm-chair on the porch.
The sunshine sprinkled through the lilac-bushes and poured great
coins on the boards. The sparrows disputed in the trees that lined
the pavements. The judge mused deeply, while his hands gently
caressed the ivory head of his cane.</p>

<p>Finally he arose and entered the house, his brow still furrowed
in a thoughtful frown. His stick thumped solemnly in regular beats.
On the second floor he entered a room where Dr. Trescott was
working about the bedside of Henry Johnson. The bandages on the
negro's head allowed only one thing to appear, an eye, which
unwinkingly stared at the judge. The latter spoke to Trescott on
the condition of the patient. Afterward he evidently had something
further to say, but he seemed to be kept from it by the scrutiny of
the unwinking eye, at which he furtively glanced from time to
time.</p>

<p>When Jimmie Trescott was sufficiently recovered, his mother had
taken him to pay a visit to his grandparents in Connecticut. The
doctor had remained to take care of his patients, but as a matter
of truth he spent most of his time at Judge Hagenthorpe's house,
where lay Henry Johnson. Here he slept and ate almost every meal in
the long nights and days of his vigil.</p>

<p>At dinner, and away from the magic of the unwinking eye, the
judge said, suddenly, "Trescott, do you think it is&mdash;" As Trescott
paused expectantly, the judge fingered his knife. He said,
thoughtfully, "No one wants to advance such ideas, but somehow I
think that that poor fellow ought to die."</p>

<p>There was in Trescott's face at once a look of recognition, as
if in this tangent of the judge he saw an old problem. He merely
sighed and answered, "Who knows?" The words were spoken in a deep
tone that gave them an elusive kind of significance.</p>

<p>The judge retreated to the cold manner of the bench. "Perhaps we
may not talk with propriety of this kind of action, but I am
induced to say that you are performing a questionable charity in
preserving this negro's life. As near as I can understand, he will
hereafter be a monster, a perfect monster, and probably with an
affected brain. No man can observe you as I have observed you and
not know that it was a matter of conscience with you, but I am
afraid, my friend, that it is one of the blunders of virtue." The
judge had delivered his views with his habitual oratory. The last
three words he spoke with a particular emphasis, as if the phrase
was his discovery.</p>

<p>The doctor made a weary gesture. "He saved my boy's life."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the judge, swiftly&mdash;"yes, I know!"</p>

<p>"And what am I to do?" said Trescott, his eyes suddenly lighting
like an outburst from smouldering peat. "What am I to do? He gave
himself for&mdash;for Jimmie. What am I to do for him?"</p>

<p>The judge abased himself completely before these words. He
lowered his eyes for a moment. He picked at his cucumbers.</p>

<p>Presently he braced himself straightly in his chair. "He will be
your creation, you understand. He is purely your creation. Nature
has very evidently given him up. He is dead. You are restoring him
to life. You are making him, and he will be a monster, and with no
mind."</p>

<p>"He will be what you like, judge," cried Trescott, in sudden,
polite fury. "He will be anything, but, by God! he saved my
boy."</p>

<p>The judge interrupted in a voice trembling with emotion:
"Trescott! Trescott! Don't I know?"</p>

<p>Trescott had subsided to a sullen mood. "Yes, you know," he
answered, acidly; "but you don't know all about your own boy being
saved from death." This was a perfectly childish allusion to the
judge's bachelorhood. Trescott knew that the remark was infantile,
but he seemed to take desperate delight in it.</p>

<p>But it passed the judge completely. It was not his spot.</p>

<p>"I am puzzled," said he, in profound thought. "I don't know what
to say."</p>

<p>Trescott had become repentant. "Don't think I don't appreciate
what you say, judge. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course!" responded the judge, quickly. "Of course."</p>

<p>"It&mdash;" began Trescott.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the judge.</p>

<p>In silence they resumed their dinner.</p>

<p>"Well," said the judge, ultimately, "it is hard for a man to
know what to do."</p>

<p>"It is," said the doctor, fervidly.</p>

<p>There was another silence. It was broken by the judge:</p>

<p>"Look here, Trescott; I don't want you to think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, certainly not," answered the doctor, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want you to think I would say anything to&mdash;It was
only that I thought that I might be able to suggest to you
that&mdash;perhaps&mdash;the affair was a little dubious."</p>

<p>With an appearance of suddenly disclosing his real mental
perturbation, the doctor said: "Well, what would you do? Would you
kill him?" he asked, abruptly and sternly.</p>

<p>"Trescott, you fool," said the old man, gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I know, judge, but then&mdash;" He turned red, and spoke
with new violence: "Say, he saved my boy&mdash;do you see? He saved my
boy."</p>

<p>"You bet he did," cried the judge, with enthusiasm. "You bet he
did." And they remained for a time gazing at each other, their
faces illuminated with memories of a certain deed.</p>

<p>After another silence, the judge said, "It is hard for a man to
know what to do."</p>

<h3>Chapter XII.</h3>

<p>Late one evening Trescott, returning from a professional call,
paused his buggy at the Hagenthorpe gate. He tied the mare to the
old tin-covered post, and entered the house. Ultimately he appeared
with a companion&mdash;a man who walked slowly and carefully, as if he
were learning. He was wrapped to the heels in an old-fashioned
ulster. They entered the buggy and drove away.</p>

<p>After a silence only broken by the swift and musical humming of
the wheels on the smooth road, Trescott spoke. "Henry," he said,
"I've got you a home here with old Alek Williams. You will have
everything you want to eat and a good place to sleep, and I hope
you will get along there all right. I will pay all your expenses,
and come to see you as often as I can. If you don't get along, I
want you to let me know as soon as possible, and then we will do
what we can to make it better."</p>

<p>The dark figure at the doctor's side answered with a cheerful
laugh. "These buggy wheels don' look like I washed 'em yesterday,
docteh," he said.</p>

<p>Trescott hesitated for a moment, and then went on insistently,
"I am taking you to Alek Williams, Henry, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The figure chuckled again. "No, 'deed! No, seh! Alek Williams
don' know a hoss! 'Deed he don't. He don' know a hoss from a pig."
The laugh that followed was like the rattle of pebbles.</p>

<p>Trescott turned and looked sternly and coldly at the dim form in
the gloom from the buggy-top. "Henry," he said, "I didn't say
anything about horses. I was saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hoss? Hoss?" said the quavering voice from these near shadows.
"Hoss? 'Deed I don' know all erbout a hoss! 'Deed I don't." There
was a satirical chuckle.</p>

<p>At the end of three miles the mare slackened and the doctor
leaned forward, peering, while holding tight reins. The wheels of
the buggy bumped often over out-cropping bowlders. A window shone
forth, a simple square of topaz on a great black hill-side. Four
dogs charged the buggy with ferocity, and when it did not promptly
retreat, they circled courageously around the flanks, baying. A
door opened near the window in the hill-side, and a man came and
stood on a beach of yellow light.</p>

<p>"Yah! yah! You Roveh! You Susie! Come yah! Come yah this
minit!"</p>

<p>Trescott called across the dark sea of grass, "Hello, Alek!"</p>

<p>"Hello!"</p>

<p>"Come down here and show me where to drive."</p>

<p>The man plunged from the beach into the surf, and Trescott could
then only trace his course by the fervid and polite ejaculations of
a host who was somewhere approaching. Presently Williams took the
mare by the head, and uttering cries of welcome and scolding the
swarming dogs, led the equipage toward the lights. When they halted
at the door and Trescott was climbing out, Williams cried, "Will
she stand, docteh?"</p>

<p>"She'll stand all right, but you better hold her for a minute.
Now, Henry." The doctor turned and held both arms to the dark
figure. It crawled to him painfully like a man going down a ladder.
Williams took the mare away to be tied to a little tree, and when
he returned he found them awaiting him in the gloom beyond the rays
from the door.</p>

<p>He burst out then like a siphon pressed by a nervous thumb.
"Hennery! Hennery, ma ol' frien'. Well, if I ain' glade. If I ain'
glade!"</p>

<p>Trescott had taken the silent shape by the arm and led it
forward into the full revelation of the light. "Well, now, Alek,
you can take Henry and put him to bed, and in the morning I
will&mdash;"</p>

<p>Near the end of this sentence old Williams had come front to
front with Johnson. He gasped for a second, and then yelled the
yell of a man stabbed in the heart.</p>

<p>For a fraction of a moment Trescott seemed to be looking for
epithets. Then he roared: "You old black chump! You old black&mdash;Shut
up! Shut up! Do you hear?"</p>

<p>Williams obeyed instantly in the matter of his screams, but he
continued in a lowered voice: "Ma Lode amassy! Who'd ever think? Ma
Lode amassy!"</p>

<p>Trescott spoke again in the manner of a commander of a
battalion. "Alek!"</p>

<p>The old negro again surrendered, but to himself he repeated in a
whisper, "Ma Lode!" He was aghast and trembling.</p>

<p>As these three points of widening shadows approached the golden
doorway a hale old negress appeared there, bowing. "Good-evenin',
docteh! Good-evenin'! Come in! come in!" She had evidently just
retired from a tempestuous struggle to place the room in order, but
she was now bowing rapidly. She made the effort of a person
swimming.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself, Mary," said Trescott, entering. "I've
brought Henry for you to take care of, and all you've got to do is
to carry out what I tell you." Learning that he was not followed,
he faced the door, and said, "Come in, Henry."</p>

<p>Johnson entered. "Whee!" shrieked Mrs. Williams. She almost
achieved a back somersault. Six young members of the tribe of
Williams made simultaneous plunge for a position behind the stove,
and formed a wailing heap.</p>

<h3>Chapter XIII.</h3>

<p>"You know very well that you and your family lived usually on
less than three dollars a week, and now that Doctor Trescott pays
you five dollars a week for Johnson's board, you live like
millionaires. You haven't done a stroke of work since Johnson began
to board with you&mdash;everybody knows that&mdash;and so what are you
kicking about?"</p>

<p>The judge sat in his chair on the porch, fondling his cane, and
gazing down at old Williams, who stood under the lilac-bushes.
"Yes, I know, jedge," said the negro, wagging his head in a puzzled
manner. "'Tain't like as if I didn't 'preciate what the docteh
done, but&mdash;but&mdash;well, yeh see, jedge," he added, gaining a new
impetus, "it's&mdash;it's hard wuk. This ol' man nev' did wuk so hard.
Lode, no."</p>

<p>"Don't talk such nonsense, Alek," spoke the judge, sharply. "You
have never really worked in your life&mdash;anyhow enough to support a
family of sparrows, and now when you are in a more prosperous
condition than ever before, you come around talking like an old
fool."</p>

<p>The negro began to scratch his head. "Yeh see, jedge," he said
at last, "my ol' 'ooman she cain't 'ceive no lady callahs,
nohow."</p>

<p>"Hang lady callers!" said the judge, irascibly. "If you have
flour in the barrel and meat in the pot, your wife can get along
without receiving lady callers, can't she?"</p>

<p>"But they won't come ainyhow, jedge," replied Williams, with an
air of still deeper stupefaction. "Noner ma wife's frien's ner
noner ma frien's'll come near ma res'dence."</p>

<p>"Well, let them stay home if they are such silly people."</p>

<p>The old negro seemed to be seeking a way to elude this argument,
but evidently finding none, he was about to shuffle meekly off. He
halted, however. "Jedge," said he, "ma ol' 'ooman's near driv'
abstracted."</p>

<p>"Your old woman is an idiot," responded the judge.</p>

<p>Williams came very close and peered solemnly through a branch of
lilac. "Jedge," he whispered, "the chillens."</p>

<p>"What about them?"</p>

<p>Dropping his voice to funereal depths, Williams said,
"They&mdash;they cain't eat."</p>

<p>"Can't eat!" scoffed the judge, loudly. "Can't eat! You must
think I am as big an old fool as you are. Can't eat&mdash;the little
rascals! What's to prevent them from eating?"</p>

<p>In answer, Williams said, with mournful emphasis, "Hennery."
Moved with a kind of satisfaction at his tragic use of the name, he
remained staring at the judge for a sign of its effect.</p>

<p>The judge made a gesture of irritation. "Come, now, you old
scoundrel, don't beat around the bush any more. What are you up to?
What do you want? Speak out like a man, and don't give me any more
of this tiresome rigamarole."</p>

<p>"I ain't er-beatin' round 'bout nuffin, jedge," replied
Williams, indignantly. "No, seh; I say whatter got to say right
out. 'Deed I do."</p>

<p>"Well, say it, then."</p>

<p>"Jedge," began the negro, taking off his hat and switching his
knee with it, "Lode knows I'd do jes 'bout as much fer five dollehs
er week as ainy cul'd man, but&mdash;but this yere business is awful,
jedge. I raikon 'ain't been no sleep in&mdash;in my house sence docteh
done fetch 'im."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you propose to do about it?"</p>

<p>Williams lifted his eyes from the ground and gazed off through
the trees. "Raikon I got good appetite, an' sleep jes like er dog,
but he&mdash;he's done broke me all up. 'Tain't no good, nohow. I wake
up in the night; I hear 'im, mebbe, er-whimperin' an'
er-whimperin', an' I sneak an' I sneak until I try th' do' to see
if he locked in. An' he keep me er-puzzlin' an' er-quakin' all
night long. Don't know how 'll do in th' winter. Can't let 'im out
where th' chillen is. He'll done freeze where he is now." Williams
spoke these sentences as if he were talking to himself. After a
silence of deep reflection he continued: "Folks go round sayin' he
ain't Hennery Johnson at all. They say he's er devil!"</p>

<p>"What?" cried the judge.</p>

<p>"Yesseh," repeated Williams in tones of injury, as if his
veracity had been challenged. "Yesseh. I'm er-tellin' it to yeh
straight, jedge. Plenty cul'd people folks up my way say it is a
devil."</p>

<p>"Well, you don't think so yourself, do you?"</p>

<p>"No. 'Tain't no devil. It's Hennery Johnson."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what is the matter with you? You don't care what a
lot of foolish people say. Go on 'tending to your business, and pay
no attention to such idle nonsense."</p>

<p>"'Tis nonsense, jedge; but he looks like er devil."</p>

<p>"What do you care what he looks like?" demanded the judge.</p>

<p>"Ma rent is two dollehs and er half er month," said Williams,
slowly.</p>

<p>"It might just as well be ten thousand dollars a month,"
responded the judge. "You never pay it, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Then, anoth' thing," continued Williams, in his reflective
tone. "If he was all right in his haid I could stan' it; but,
jedge, he's crazier 'n er loon. Then when he looks like er devil,
an' done skears all ma frien's away, an' ma chillens cain't eat,
an' ma ole 'ooman jes raisin' Cain all the time, an' ma rent two
dollehs an' er half er month, an' him not right in his haid, it
seems like five dollehs er week&mdash;"</p>

<p>The judge's stick came down sharply and suddenly upon the floor
of the porch. "There," he said, "I thought that was what you were
driving at."</p>

<p>Williams began swinging his head from side to side in the
strange racial mannerism. "Now hol' on a minnet, jedge," he said,
defensively. "'Tain't like as if I didn't 'preciate what the docteh
done. 'Tain't that. Docteh Trescott is er kind man, an' 'tain't
like as if I didn't 'preciate what he done; but&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what? You are getting painful, Alek. Now tell me this: did
you ever have five dollars a week regularly before in your
life?"</p>

<p>Williams at once drew himself up with great dignity, but in the
pause after that question he drooped gradually to another attitude.
In the end he answered, heroically: "No, jedge, I 'ain't. An'
'tain't like as if I was er-sayin' five dollehs wasn't er lot er
money for a man like me. But, jedge, what er man oughter git fer
this kinder wuk is er salary. Yesseh, jedge," he repeated, with a
great impressive gesture; "fer this kinder wuk er man oughter git
er Salary." He laid a terrible emphasis upon the final word.</p>

<p>The judge laughed. "I know Dr. Trescott's mind concerning this
affair, Alek; and if you are dissatisfied with your boarder, he is
quite ready to move him to some other place; so, if you care to
leave word with me that you are tired of the arrangement and wish
it changed, he will come and take Johnson away."</p>

<p>Williams scratched his head again in deep perplexity. "Five
dollehs is er big price fer bo'd, but 'tain't no big price fer the
bo'd of er crazy man," he said, finally.</p>

<p>"What do you think you ought to get?" asked the judge.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Alek, in the manner of one deep in a balancing
of the scales, "he looks like er devil, an' done skears e'rybody,
an' ma chillens cain't eat, an' I cain't sleep, an' he ain't right
in his haid, an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You told me all those things."</p>

<p>After scratching his wool, and beating his knee with his hat,
and gazing off through the trees and down at the ground, Williams
said, as he kicked nervously at the gravel, "Well, jedge, I think
it is wuth&mdash;" He stuttered.</p>

<p>"Worth what?"</p>

<p>"Six dollehs," answered Williams, in a desperate outburst.</p>

<p>The judge lay back in his great arm-chair and went through all
the motions of a man laughing heartily, but he made no sound save a
slight cough. Williams had been watching him with apprehension.</p>

<p>"Well," said the judge, "do you call six dollars a salary?"</p>

<p>"No, seh," promptly responded Williams. "'Tain't a salary. No,
'deed! 'Tain't a salary." He looked with some anger upon the man
who questioned his intelligence in this way.</p>

<p>"Well, supposing your children can't eat?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And supposing he looks like a devil? And supposing all those
things continue? Would you be satisfied with six dollars a
week?"</p>

<p>Recollections seemed to throng in Williams's mind at these
interrogations, and he answered dubiously. "Of co'se a man who
ain't right in his haid, an' looks like er devil&mdash;But six
dollehs&mdash;" After these two attempts at a sentence Williams suddenly
appeared as an orator, with a great shiny palm waving in the air.
"I tell yeh, jedge, six dollehs is six dollehs, but if I git six
dollehs for bo'ding Hennery Johnson, I uhns it! I uhns it!"</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that you earn six dollars for every week's work
you do," said the judge.</p>

<p>"Well, if I bo'd Hennery Johnson fer six dollehs a week, I uhns
it! I uhns it!" cried Williams, wildly.</p>

<h3>Chapter XIV.</h3>

<p>Reifsnyder's assistant had gone to his supper, and the owner of
the shop was trying to placate four men who wished to be shaved at
once. Reifsnyder was very garrulous&mdash;a fact which made him rather
remarkable among barbers, who, as a class, are austerely
speechless, having been taught silence by the hammering reiteration
of a tradition. It is the customers who talk in the ordinary
event.</p>

<p>As Reifsnyder waved his razor down the cheek of a man in the
chair, he turned often to cool the impatience of the others with
pleasant talk, which they did not particularly heed.</p>

<p>"Oh, he should have let him die," said Bainbridge, a railway
engineer, finally replying to one of the barber's orations. "Shut
up, Reif, and go on with your business!"</p>

<p>Instead, Reifsnyder paused shaving entirely, and turned to front
the speaker. "Let him die?" he demanded. "How vas that? How can you
let a man die?"</p>

<p>"By letting him die, you chump," said the engineer. The others
laughed a little, and Reifsnyder turned at once to his work,
sullenly, as a man overwhelmed by the derision of numbers.</p>

<p>"How vas that?" he grumbled later. "How can you let a man die
when he vas done so much for you?"</p>

<p>"'When he vas done so much for you?'" repeated Bainbridge. "You
better shave some people. How vas that? Maybe this ain't a barber
shop?"</p>

<p>A man hitherto silent now said, "If I had been the doctor, I
would have done the same thing."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Reifsnyder. "Any man vould do it. Any man that
vas not like you, you&mdash;old&mdash;flint-hearted&mdash;fish." He had sought the
final words with painful care, and he delivered the collection
triumphantly at Bainbridge. The engineer laughed.</p>

<p>The man in the chair now lifted himself higher, while Reifsnyder
began an elaborate ceremony of anointing and combing his hair. Now
free to join comfortably in the talk, the man said: "They say he is
the most terrible thing in the world. Young Johnnie Bernard&mdash;that
drives the grocery wagon&mdash;saw him up at Alek Williams's shanty, and
he says he couldn't eat anything for two days."</p>

<p>"Chee!" said Reifsnyder.</p>

<p>"Well, what makes him so terrible?" asked another.</p>

<p>"Because he hasn't got any face," replied the barber and the
engineer in duet.</p>

<p>"Hasn't got any face?" repeated the man. "How can he do without
any face!" "He has no face in the front of his head, In the place
where his face ought to grow."</p>

<p>Bainbridge sang these lines pathetically as he arose and hung
his hat on a hook. The man in the chair was about to abdicate in
his favor. "Get a gait on you now," he said to Reifsnyder. "I go
out at 7.31."</p>

<p>As the barber foamed the lather on the cheeks of the engineer he
seemed to be thinking heavily. Then suddenly he burst out. "How
would you like to be with no face?" he cried to the assemblage.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I had to have a face like yours&mdash;" answered one
customer.</p>

<p>Bainbridge's voice came from a sea of lather. "You're kicking
because if losing faces becomes popular, you'd have to go out of
business."</p>

<p>"I don't think it will become so much popular," said
Reifsnyder.</p>

<p>"Not if it's got to be taken off in the way his was taken off,"
said another man. "I'd rather keep mine, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"I guess so!" cried the barber. "Just think!"</p>

<p>The shaving of Bainbridge had arrived at a time of comparative
liberty for him. "I wonder what the doctor says to himself?" he
observed. "He may be sorry he made him live."</p>

<p>"It was the only thing he could do," replied a man. The others
seemed to agree with him.</p>

<p>"Supposing you were in his place," said one, "and Johnson had
saved your kid. What would you do?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!"</p>

<p>"Of course! You would do anything on earth for him. You'd take
all the trouble in the world for him. And spend your last dollar on
him. Well, then?"</p>

<p>"I wonder how it feels to be without any face?" said Reifsnyder,
musingly.</p>

<p>The man who had previously spoken, feeling that he had expressed
himself well, repeated the whole thing. "You would do anything on
earth for him. You'd take all the trouble in the world for him. And
spend your last dollar on him. Well, then?"</p>

<p>"No, but look," said Reifsnyder; "supposing you don't got a
face!"</p>

<h3>Chapter XV.</h3>

<p>As soon as Williams was hidden from the view of the old judge he
began to gesture and talk to himself. An elation had evidently
penetrated to his vitals, and caused him to dilate as if he had
been filled with gas. He snapped his fingers in the air, and
whistled fragments of triumphal music. At times, in his progress
toward his shanty, he indulged in a shuffling movement that was
really a dance. It was to be learned from the intermediate
monologue that he had emerged from his trials laurelled and proud.
He was the unconquerable Alexander Williams. Nothing could exceed
the bold self-reliance of his manner. His kingly stride, his heroic
song, the derisive flourish of his hands&mdash;all betokened a man who
had successfully defied the world.</p>

<p>On his way he saw Zeke Paterson coming to town. They hailed each
other at a distance of fifty yards.</p>

<p>"How do, Broth' Paterson?"</p>

<p>"How do, Broth' Williams?"</p>

<p>They were both deacons.</p>

<p>"Is you' folks well, Broth' Paterson?"</p>

<p>"Middlin', middlin'. How's you' folks, Broth' Williams?"</p>

<p>Neither of them had slowed his pace in the smallest degree. They
had simply begun this talk when a considerable space separated
them, continued it as they passed, and added polite questions as
they drifted steadily apart. Williams's mind seemed to be a
balloon. He had been so inflated that he had not noticed that
Paterson had definitely shied into the dry ditch as they came to
the point of ordinary contact.</p>

<p>Afterward, as he went a lonely way, he burst out again in song
and pantomimic celebration of his estate. His feet moved in
prancing steps.</p>

<p>When he came in sight of his cabin, the fields were bathed in a
blue dusk, and the light in the window was pale. Cavorting and
gesticulating, he gazed joyfully for some moments upon this light.
Then suddenly another idea seemed to attack his mind, and he
stopped, with an air of being suddenly dampened. In the end he
approached his home as if it were the fortress of an enemy.</p>

<p>Some dogs disputed his advance for a loud moment, and then
discovering their lord, slunk away embarrassed. His reproaches were
addressed to them in muffled tones.</p>

<p>Arriving at the door, he pushed it open with the timidity of a
new thief. He thrust his head cautiously sideways, and his eyes met
the eyes of his wife, who sat by the table, the lamp-light defining
a half of her face. "Sh!" he said, uselessly. His glance travelled
swiftly to the inner door which shielded the one bed-chamber. The
pickaninnies, strewn upon the floor of the living-room, were softly
snoring. After a hearty meal they had promptly dispersed themselves
about the place and gone to sleep. "Sh!" said Williams again to his
motionless and silent wife. He had allowed only his head to appear.
His wife, with one hand upon the edge of the table and the other at
her knee, was regarding him with wide eyes and parted lips as if he
were a spectre. She looked to be one who was living in terror, and
even the familiar face at the door had thrilled her because it had
come suddenly.</p>

<p>Williams broke the tense silence. "Is he all right?" he
whispered, waving his eyes toward the inner door. Following his
glance timorously, his wife nodded, and in a low tone answered.</p>

<p>"I raikon he's done gone t'sleep."</p>

<p>Williams then slunk noiselessly across his threshold.</p>

<p>He lifted a chair, and with infinite care placed it so that it
faced the dreaded inner door. His wife moved slightly, so as to
also squarely face it. A silence came upon them in which they
seemed to be waiting for a calamity, pealing and deadly.</p>

<p>Williams finally coughed behind his hand. His wife started, and
looked upon him in alarm. "'Pears like he done gwine keep quiet
ter-night," he breathed. They continually pointed their speech and
their looks at the inner door, paying it the homage due to a corpse
or a phantom. Another long stillness followed this sentence. Their
eyes shone white and wide. A wagon rattled down the distant road.
From their chairs they looked at the window, and the effect of the
light in the cabin was a presentation of an intensely black and
solemn night. The old woman adopted the attitude used always in
church at funerals. At times she seemed to be upon the point of
breaking out in prayer.</p>

<p>"He mighty quiet ter-night," whispered Williams. "Was he good
ter-day?" For answer his wife raised her eyes to the ceiling in the
supplication of Job. Williams moved restlessly. Finally he tip-toed
to the door. He knelt slowly and without a sound, and placed his
ear near the key-hole. Hearing a noise behind him, he turned
quickly. His wife was staring at him aghast. She stood in front of
the stove, and her arms were spread out in the natural movement to
protect all her sleeping ducklings.</p>

<p>But Williams arose without having touched the door. "I raikon he
er-sleep," he said, fingering his wool. He debated with himself for
some time. During this interval his wife remained, a great fat
statue of a mother shielding her children.</p>

<p>It was plain that his mind was swept suddenly by a wave of
temerity. With a sounding step he moved toward the door. His
fingers were almost upon the knob when he swiftly ducked and dodged
away, clapping his hands to the back of his head. It was as if the
portal had threatened him. There was a little tumult near the
stove, where Mrs. Williams's desperate retreat had involved her
feet with the prostrate children.</p>

<p>After the panic Williams bore traces of a feeling of shame. He
returned to the charge. He firmly grasped the knob with his left
hand, and with his other hand turned the key in the lock. He pushed
the door, and as it swung portentously open he sprang nimbly to one
side like the fearful slave liberating the lion. Near the stove a
group had formed, the terror-stricken mother with her arms
stretched, and the aroused children clinging frenziedly to her
skirts.</p>

<p>The light streamed after the swinging door, and disclosed a room
six feet one way and six feet the other way. It was small enough to
enable the radiance to lay it plain. Williams peered warily around
the corner made by the door-post.</p>

<p>Suddenly he advanced, retired, and advanced again with a howl.
His palsied family had expected him to spring backward, and at his
howl they heaped themselves wondrously. But Williams simply stood
in the little room emitting his howls before an open window. "He's
gone! He's gone! He's gone!" His eye and his hand had speedily
proved the fact. He had even thrown open a little cupboard.</p>

<p>Presently he came flying out. He grabbed his hat, and hurled the
outer door back upon its hinges. Then he tumbled headlong into the
night. He was yelling: "Docteh Trescott! Docteh Trescott!" He ran
wildly through the fields, and galloped in the direction of town.
He continued to call to Trescott as if the latter was within easy
hearing. It was as if Trescott was poised in the contemplative sky
over the running negro, and could heed this reaching voice&mdash;"Docteh
Trescott!"</p>

<p>In the cabin, Mrs. Williams, supported by relays from the
battalion of children, stood quaking watch until the truth of
daylight came as a re-enforcement and made them arrogant,
strutting, swashbuckler children, and a mother who proclaimed her
illimitable courage.</p>

<h3>Chapter XVI.</h3>

<p>Theresa Page was giving a party. It was the outcome of a long
series of arguments addressed to her mother, which had been
overheard in part by her father. He had at last said five words,
"Oh, let her have it." The mother had then gladly capitulated.</p>

<p>Theresa had written nineteen invitations, and distributed them
at recess to her schoolmates. Later her mother had composed five
large cakes, and still later a vast amount of lemonade.</p>

<p>So the nine little girls and the ten little boys sat quite
primly in the dining-room, while Theresa and her mother plied them
with cake and lemonade, and also with ice-cream. This primness sat
now quite strangely upon them. It was owing to the presence of Mrs.
Page. Previously in the parlor alone with their games they had
overturned a chair; the boys had let more or less of their hoodlum
spirit shine forth. But when circumstances could be possibly
magnified to warrant it, the girls made the boys victims of an
insufferable pride, snubbing them mercilessly. So in the
dining-room they resembled a class at Sunday-school, if it were not
for the subterranean smiles, gestures, rebuffs, and poutings which
stamped the affair as a children's party.</p>

<p>Two little girls of this subdued gathering were planted in a
settle with their backs to the broad window. They were beaming
lovingly upon each other with an effect of scorning the boys.</p>

<p>Hearing a noise behind her at the window, one little girl turned
to face it. Instantly she screamed and sprang away, covering her
face with her hands. "What was it? What was it?" cried every one in
a roar. Some slight movement of the eyes of the weeping and
shuddering child informed the company that she had been frightened
by an appearance at the window. At once they all faced the
imperturbable window, and for a moment there was a silence. An
astute lad made an immediate census of the other lads. The prank of
slipping out and looming spectrally at a window was too venerable.
But the little boys were all present and astonished.</p>

<p>As they recovered their minds they uttered warlike cries, and
through a side-door sallied rapidly out against the terror. They
vied with each other in daring.</p>

<p>None wished particularly to encounter a dragon in the darkness
of the garden, but there could be no faltering when the fair ones
in the dining-room were present. Calling to each other in stern
voices, they went dragooning over the lawn, attacking the shadows
with ferocity, but still with the caution of reasonable beings.
They found, however, nothing new to the peace of the night. Of
course there was a lad who told a great lie. He described a grim
figure, bending low and slinking off along the fence. He gave a
number of details, rendering his lie more splendid by a repetition
of certain forms which he recalled from romances. For instance, he
insisted that he had heard the creature emit a hollow laugh.</p>

<p>Inside the house the little girl who had raised the alarm was
still shuddering and weeping. With the utmost difficulty was she
brought to a state approximating calmness by Mrs. Page. Then she
wanted to go home at once.</p>

<p>Page entered the house at this time. He had exiled himself until
he concluded that this children's party was finished and gone. He
was obliged to escort the little girl home because she screamed
again when they opened the door and she saw the night.</p>

<p>She was not coherent even to her mother. Was it a man? She
didn't know. It was simply a thing, a dreadful thing.</p>

<h3>Chapter XVII.</h3>

<p>In Watermelon Alley the Farraguts were spending their evening as
usual on the little rickety porch. Sometimes they howled gossip to
other people on other rickety porches. The thin wail of a baby
arose from a near house. A man had a terrific altercation with his
wife, to which the alley paid no attention at all.</p>

<p>There appeared suddenly before the Farraguts a monster making a
low and sweeping bow. There was an instant's pause, and then
occurred something that resembled the effect of an upheaval of the
earth's surface. The old woman hurled herself backward with a
dreadful cry. Young Sim had been perched gracefully on a railing.
At sight of the monster he simply fell over it to the ground. He
made no sound, his eyes stuck out, his nerveless hands tried to
grapple the rail to prevent a tumble, and then he vanished. Bella,
blubbering, and with her hair suddenly and mysteriously
dishevelled, was crawling on her hands and knees fearsomely up the
steps.</p>

<p>Standing before this wreck of a family gathering, the monster
continued to bow. It even raised a deprecatory claw. "Don' make no
botheration 'bout me, Miss Fa'gut," it said, politely. "No, 'deed.
I jes drap in ter ax if yer well this evenin', Miss Fa'gut. Don'
make no botheration. No, 'deed. I gwine ax you to go to er daince
with me, Miss Fa'gut. I ax you if I can have the magnifercent
gratitude of you' company on that 'casion, Miss Fa'gut."</p>

<p>The girl cast a miserable glance behind her. She was still
crawling away. On the ground beside the porch young Sim raised a
strange bleat, which expressed both his fright and his lack of
wind. Presently the monster, with a fashionable amble, ascended the
steps after the girl.</p>

<p>She grovelled in a corner of the room as the creature took a
chair. It seated itself very elegantly on the edge. It held an old
cap in both hands. "Don' make no botheration, Miss Fa'gut. Don'
make no botherations. No, 'deed. I jes drap in ter ax you if you
won' do me the proud of acceptin' ma humble invitation to er
daince, Miss Fa'gut."</p>

<p>She shielded her eyes with her arms and tried to crawl past it,
but the genial monster blocked the way. "I jes drap in ter ax you
'bout er daince, Miss Fa'gut. I ax you if I kin have the
magnifercent gratitude of you' company on that 'casion, Miss
Fa'gut."</p>

<p>In a last outbreak of despair, the girl, shuddering and wailing,
threw herself face downward on the floor, while the monster sat on
the edge of the chair gabbling courteous invitations, and holding
the old hat daintily to its stomach.</p>

<p>At the back of the house, Mrs. Farragut, who was of enormous
weight, and who for eight years had done little more than sit in an
arm-chair and describe her various ailments, had with speed and
agility scaled a high board fence.</p>

<h3>Chapter XVIII.</h3>

<p>The black mass in the middle of Trescott's property was hardly
allowed to cool before the builders were at work on another house.
It had sprung upward at a fabulous rate. It was like a magical
composition born of the ashes. The doctor's office was the first
part to be completed, and he had already moved in his new books and
instruments and medicines.</p>

<p>Trescott sat before his desk when the chief of police arrived.
"Well, we found him," said the latter.</p>

<p>"Did you?" cried the doctor. "Where?"</p>

<p>"Shambling around the streets at daylight this morning. I'll be
blamed if I can figure on where he passed the night."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we jugged him. I didn't know what else to do with him.
That's what I want you to tell me. Of course we can't keep him. No
charge could be made, you know."</p>

<p>"I'll come down and get him."</p>

<p>The official grinned retrospectively. "Must say he had a fine
career while he was out. First thing he did was to break up a
children's party at Page's. Then he went to Watermelon Alley. Whoo!
He stampeded the whole outfit. Men, women, and children running
pell-mell, and yelling. They say one old woman broke her leg, or
something, shinning over a fence. Then he went right out on the
main street, and an Irish girl threw a fit, and there was a sort of
riot. He began to run, and a big crowd chased him, firing rocks.
But he gave them the slip somehow down there by the foundry and in
the railroad yard. We looked for him all night, but couldn't find
him."</p>

<p>"Was he hurt any? Did anybody hit him with a stone?"</p>

<p>"Guess there isn't much of him to hurt any more, is there? Guess
he's been hurt up to the limit. No. They never touched him. Of
course nobody really wanted to hit him, but you know how a crowd
gets. It's like&mdash;it's like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>For a moment the chief of the police looked reflectively at the
floor. Then he spoke hesitatingly. "You know Jake Winter's little
girl was the one that he scared at the party. She is pretty sick,
they say."</p>

<p>"Is she? Why, they didn't call me. I always attend the Winter
family."</p>

<p>"No? Didn't they?" asked the chief, slowly. "Well&mdash;you
know&mdash;Winter is&mdash;well, Winter has gone clean crazy over this
business. He wanted&mdash;he wanted to have you arrested."</p>

<p>"Have me arrested? The idiot! What in the name of wonder could
he have me arrested for?"</p>

<p>"Of course. He is a fool. I told him to keep his trap shut. But
then you know how he'll go all over town yapping about the thing. I
thought I'd better tip you."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is of no consequence; but then, of course, I'm obliged
to you, Sam."</p>

<p>"That's all right. Well, you'll be down to-night and take him
out, eh? You'll get a good welcome from the jailer. He don't like
his job for a cent. He says you can have your man whenever you want
him. He's got no use for him."</p>

<p>"But what is this business of Winter's about having me
arrested?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a lot of chin about your having no right to allow
this&mdash;this&mdash;this man to be at large. But I told him to tend to his
own business. Only I thought I'd better let you know. And I might
as well say right now, doctor, that there is a good deal of talk
about this thing. If I were you, I'd come to the jail pretty late
at night, because there is likely to be a crowd around the door,
and I'd bring a&mdash;er&mdash;mask, or some kind of a veil, anyhow."</p>

<h3>Chapter XIX.</h3>

<p>Martha Goodwin was single, and well along into the thin years.
She lived with her married sister in Whilomville. She performed
nearly all the house-work in exchange for the privilege of
existence. Every one tacitly recognized her labor as a form of
penance for the early end of her betrothed, who had died of
small-pox, which he had not caught from her.</p>

<p>But despite the strenuous and unceasing workaday of her life,
she was a woman of great mind. She had adamantine opinions upon the
situation in Armenia, the condition of women in China, the
flirtation between Mrs. Minster of Niagara Avenue and young
Griscom, the conflict in the Bible class of the Baptist
Sunday-school, the duty of the United States toward the Cuban
insurgents, and many other colossal matters. Her fullest experience
of violence was gained on an occasion when she had seen a hound
clubbed, but in the plan which she had made for the reform of the
world she advocated drastic measures. For instance, she contended
that all the Turks should be pushed into the sea and drowned, and
that Mrs. Minster and young Griscom should be hanged side by side
on twin gallows. In fact, this woman of peace, who had seen only
peace, argued constantly for a creed of illimitable ferocity. She
was invulnerable on these questions, because eventually she
overrode all opponents with a sniff. This sniff was an active
force. It was to her antagonists like a bang over the head, and
none was known to recover from this expression of exalted contempt.
It left them windless and conquered. They never again came forward
as candidates for suppression. And Martha walked her kitchen with a
stern brow, an invincible being like Napoleon.</p>

<p>Nevertheless her acquaintances, from the pain of their defeats,
had been long in secret revolt. It was in no wise a conspiracy,
because they did not care to state their open rebellion, but
nevertheless it was understood that any woman who could not
coincide with one of Martha's contentions was entitled to the
support of others in the small circle. It amounted to an
arrangement by which all were required to disbelieve any theory for
which Martha fought. This, however, did not prevent them from
speaking of her mind with profound respect.</p>

<p>Two people bore the brunt of her ability. Her sister Kate was
visibly afraid of her, while Carrie Dungen sailed across from her
kitchen to sit respectfully at Martha's feet and learn the business
of the world. To be sure, afterwards, under another sun, she always
laughed at Martha and pretended to deride her ideas, but in the
presence of the sovereign she always remained silent or admiring.
Kate, the sister, was of no consequence at all. Her principal
delusion was that she did all the work in the upstairs rooms of the
house, while Martha did it downstairs. The truth was seen only by
the husband, who treated Martha with a kindness that was half
banter, half deference. Martha herself had no suspicion that she
was the only pillar of the domestic edifice. The situation was
without definitions. Martha made definitions, but she devoted them
entirely to the Armenians and Griscom and the Chinese and other
subjects. Her dreams, which in early days had been of love of
meadows and the shade of trees, of the face of a man, were now
involved otherwise, and they were companioned in the kitchen
curiously, Cuba, the hot-water kettle, Armenia, the washing of the
dishes, and the whole thing being jumbled. In regard to social
misdemeanors, she who was simply the mausoleum of a dead passion
was probably the most savage critic in town. This unknown woman,
hidden in a kitchen as in a well, was sure to have a considerable
effect of the one kind or the other in the life of the town. Every
time it moved a yard, she had personally contributed an inch. She
could hammer so stoutly upon the door of a proposition that it
would break from its hinges and fall upon her, but at any rate it
moved. She was an engine, and the fact that she did not know that
she was an engine contributed largely to the effect. One reason
that she was formidable was that she did not even imagine that she
was formidable. She remained a weak, innocent, and pig-headed
creature, who alone would defy the universe if she thought the
universe merited this proceeding.</p>

<p>One day Carrie Dungen came across from her kitchen with speed.
She had a great deal of grist. "Oh," she cried, "Henry Johnson got
away from where they was keeping him, and came to town last night,
and scared everybody almost to death."</p>

<p>Martha was shining a dish-pan, polishing madly. No reasonable
person could see cause for this operation, because the pan already
glistened like silver. "Well!" she ejaculated. She imparted to the
word a deep meaning. "This, my prophecy, has come to pass." It was
a habit.</p>

<p>The overplus of information was choking Carrie. Before she could
go on she was obliged to struggle for a moment. "And, oh, little
Sadie Winter is awful sick, and they say Jake Winter was around
this morning trying to get Doctor Trescott arrested. And poor old
Mrs. Farragut sprained her ankle in trying to climb a fence. And
there's a crowd around the jail all the time. They put Henry in
jail because they didn't know what else to do with him, I guess.
They say he is perfectly terrible."</p>

<p>Martha finally released the dish-pan and confronted the headlong
speaker. "Well!" she said again, poising a great brown rag. Kate
had heard the excited new-comer, and drifted down from the novel in
her room. She was a shivery little woman. Her shoulder-blades
seemed to be two panes of ice, for she was constantly shrugging and
shrugging. "Serves him right if he was to lose all his patients,"
she said suddenly, in bloodthirsty tones. She snipped her words out
as if her lips were scissors.</p>

<p>"Well, he's likely to," shouted Carrie Dungen. "Don't a lot of
people say that they won't have him any more? If you're sick and
nervous, Doctor Trescott would scare the life out of you, wouldn't
he? He would me. I'd keep thinking."</p>

<p>Martha, stalking to and fro, sometimes surveyed the two other
women with a contemplative frown.</p>

<h3>Chapter XX.</h3>

<p>After the return from Connecticut, little Jimmie was at first
much afraid of the monster who lived in the room over the
carriage-house. He could not identify it in any way. Gradually,
however, his fear dwindled under the influence of a weird
fascination. He sidled into closer and closer relations with
it.</p>

<p>One time the monster was seated on a box behind the stable
basking in the rays of the afternoon sun. A heavy crepe veil was
swathed about its head.</p>

<p>Little Jimmie and many companions came around the corner of the
stable. They were all in what was popularly known as the baby
class, and consequently escaped from school a half-hour before the
other children. They halted abruptly at sight of the figure on the
box. Jimmie waved his hand with the air of a proprietor.</p>

<p>"There he is," he said.</p>

<p>"O-o-o!" murmured all the little boys&mdash;"o-o-o!" They shrank
back, and grouped according to courage or experience, as at the
sound the monster slowly turned its head. Jimmie had remained in
the van alone. "Don't be afraid! I won't let him hurt you," he
said, delighted.</p>

<p>"Huh!" they replied, contemptuously. "We ain't afraid."</p>

<p>Jimmie seemed to reap all the joys of the owner and exhibitor of
one of the world's marvels, while his audience remained at a
distance&mdash;awed and entranced, fearful and envious.</p>

<p>One of them addressed Jimmie gloomily. "Bet you dassent walk
right up to him." He was an older boy than Jimmie, and habitually
oppressed him to a small degree. This new social elevation of the
smaller lad probably seemed revolutionary to him.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Jimmie, with deep scorn. "Dassent I? Dassent I, hey?
Dassent I?"</p>

<p>The group was immensely excited. It turned its eyes upon the boy
that Jimmie addressed. "No, you dassent," he said, stolidly, facing
a moral defeat. He could see that Jimmie was resolved. "No, you
dassent," he repeated, doggedly.</p>

<p>"Ho!" cried Jimmie. "You just watch!&mdash;you just watch!"</p>

<p>Amid a silence he turned and marched toward the monster. But
possibly the palpable wariness of his companions had an effect upon
him that weighed more than his previous experience, for suddenly,
when near to the monster, he halted dubiously. But his playmates
immediately uttered a derisive shout, and it seemed to force him
forward. He went to the monster and laid his hand delicately on its
shoulder. "Hello, Henry," he said, in a voice that trembled a
trifle. The monster was crooning a weird line of negro melody that
was scarcely more than a thread of sound, and it paid no heed to
the boy.</p>

<p>Jimmie strutted back to his companions. They acclaimed him and
hooted his opponent. Amidst this clamor the larger boy with
difficulty preserved a dignified attitude.</p>

<p>"I dassent, dassent I?" said Jimmie to him. "Now, you're so
smart, let's see you do it!"</p>

<p>This challenge brought forth renewed taunts from the others. The
larger boy puffed out his cheeks. "Well, I ain't afraid," he
explained, sullenly. He had made a mistake in diplomacy, and now
his small enemies were tumbling his prestige all about his ears.
They crowed like roosters and bleated like lambs, and made many
other noises which were supposed to bury him in ridicule and
dishonor. "Well, I ain't afraid," he continued to explain through
the din.</p>

<p>Jimmie, the hero of the mob, was pitiless. "You ain't afraid,
hey?" he sneered. "If you ain't afraid, go do it, then."</p>

<p>"Well, I would if I wanted to," the other retorted. His eyes
wore an expression of profound misery, but he preserved steadily
other portions of a pot-valiant air. He suddenly faced one of his
persecutors. "If you're so smart, why don't you go do it?" This
persecutor sank promptly through the group to the rear. The
incident gave the badgered one a breathing-spell, and for a moment
even turned the derision in another direction. He took advantage of
his interval. "I'll do it if anybody else will," he announced,
swaggering to and fro.</p>

<p>Candidates for the adventure did not come forward. To defend
themselves from this counter-charge, the other boys again set up
their crowing and bleating. For a while they would hear nothing
from him. Each time he opened his lips their chorus of noises made
oratory impossible. But at last he was able to repeat that he would
volunteer to dare as much in the affair as any other boy.</p>

<p>"Well, you go first," they shouted.</p>

<p>But Jimmie intervened to once more lead the populace against the
large boy. "You're mighty brave, ain't you?" he said to him. "You
dared me to do it, and I did&mdash;didn't I? Now who's afraid?" The
others cheered this view loudly, and they instantly resumed the
baiting of the large boy.</p>

<p>He shamefacedly scratched his left shin with his right foot.
"Well, I ain't afraid." He cast an eye at the monster. "Well, I
ain't afraid." With a glare of hatred at his squalling tormentors,
he finally announced a grim intention. "Well, I'll do it, then,
since you're so fresh. Now!"</p>

<p>The mob subsided as with a formidable countenance he turned
toward the impassive figure on the box. The advance was also a
regular progression from high daring to craven hesitation. At last,
when some yards from the monster, the lad came to a full halt, as
if he had encountered a stone wall. The observant little boys in
the distance promptly hooted. Stung again by these cries, the lad
sneaked two yards forward. He was crouched like a young cat ready
for a backward spring. The crowd at the rear, beginning to respect
this display, uttered some encouraging cries. Suddenly the lad
gathered himself together, made a white and desperate rush forward,
touched the monster's shoulder with a far-outstretched finger, and
sped away, while his laughter rang out wild, shrill, and
exultant.</p>

<p>The crowd of boys reverenced him at once, and began to throng
into his camp, and look at him, and be his admirers. Jimmie was
discomfited for a moment, but he and the larger boy, without
agreement or word of any kind, seemed to recognize a truce, and
they swiftly combined and began to parade before the others.</p>

<p>"Why, it's just as easy as nothing," puffed the larger boy.
"Ain't it, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Course," blew Jimmie. "Why, it's as e-e-easy."</p>

<p>They were people of another class. If they had been decorated
for courage on twelve battle-fields, they could not have made the
other boys more ashamed of the situation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they condescended to explain the emotions of the
excursion, expressing unqualified contempt for any one who could
hang back. "Why, it ain't nothin'. He won't do nothin' to you,"
they told the others, in tones of exasperation.</p>

<p>One of the very smallest boys in the party showed signs of a
wistful desire to distinguish himself, and they turned their
attention to him, pushing at his shoulders while he swung away from
them, and hesitated dreamily. He was eventually induced to make
furtive expedition, but it was only for a few yards. Then he
paused, motionless, gazing with open mouth. The vociferous
entreaties of Jimmie and the large boy had no power over him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hannigan had come out on her back porch with a pail of
water. From this coign she had a view of the secluded portion of
the Trescott grounds that was behind the stable. She perceived the
group of boys, and the monster on the box. She shaded her eyes with
her hand to benefit her vision. She screeched then as if she was
being murdered. "Eddie! Eddie! You come home this minute!"</p>

<p>Her son querulously demanded, "Aw, what for?"</p>

<p>"You come home this minute. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>The other boys seemed to think this visitation upon one of their
number required them to preserve for a time the hang-dog air of a
collection of culprits, and they remained in guilty silence until
the little Hannigan, wrathfully protesting, was pushed through the
door of his home. Mrs. Hannigan cast a piercing glance over the
group, stared with a bitter face at the Trescott house, as if this
new and handsome edifice was insulting her, and then followed her
son.</p>

<p>There was wavering in the party. An inroad by one mother always
caused them to carefully sweep the horizon to see if there were
more coming. "This is my yard," said Jimmie, proudly. "We don't
have to go home."</p>

<p>The monster on the box had turned his black crepe countenance
toward the sky, and was waving its arms in time to a religious
chant. "Look at him now," cried a little boy. They turned, and were
transfixed by the solemnity and mystery of the indefinable
gestures. The wail of the melody was mournful and slow. They drew
back. It seemed to spellbind them with the power of a funeral. They
were so absorbed that they did not hear the doctor's buggy drive up
to the stable. Trescott got out, tied his horse, and approached the
group. Jimmie saw him first, and at his look of dismay the others
wheeled.</p>

<p>"What's all this, Jimmie?" asked Trescott, in surprise.</p>

<p>The lad advanced to the front of his companions, halted, and
said nothing. Trescott's face gloomed slightly as he scanned the
scene.</p>

<p>"What were you doing, Jimmie?"</p>

<p>"We was playin'," answered Jimmie, huskily.</p>

<p>"Playing at what?"</p>

<p>"Just playin'."</p>

<p>Trescott looked gravely at the other boys, and asked them to
please go home. They proceeded to the street much in the manner of
frustrated and revealed assassins. The crime of trespass on another
boy's place was still a crime when they had only accepted the other
boy's cordial invitation, and they were used to being sent out of
all manner of gardens upon the sudden appearance of a father or a
mother. Jimmie had wretchedly watched the departure of his
companions. It involved the loss of his position as a lad who
controlled the privileges of his father's grounds, but then he knew
that in the beginning he had no right to ask so many boys to be his
guests.</p>

<p>Once on the sidewalk, however, they speedily forgot their shame
as trespassers, and the large boy launched forth in a description
of his success in the late trial of courage. As they went rapidly
up the street, the little boy, who had made the furtive expedition
cried out confidently from the rear, "Yes, and I went almost up to
him, didn't I, Willie?"</p>

<p>The large boy crushed him in a few words. "Huh!" he scoffed.
"You only went a little way. I went clear up to him."</p>

<p>The pace of the other boys was so manly that the tiny thing had
to trot, and he remained at the rear, getting entangled in their
legs in his attempts to reach the front rank and become of some
importance, dodging this way and that way, and always piping out
his little claim to glory.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXI.</h3>

<p>"By-the-way, Grace," said Trescott, looking into the dining-room
from his office door, "I wish you would send Jimmie to me before
school-time."</p>

<p>When Jimmie came, he advanced so quietly that Trescott did not
at first note him. "Oh," he said, wheeling from a cabinet, "here
you are, young man."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Trescott dropped into his chair and tapped the desk with a
thoughtful finger. "Jimmie, what were you doing in the back garden
yesterday&mdash;you and the other boys&mdash;to Henry?"</p>

<p>"We weren't doing anything, pa."</p>

<p>Trescott looked sternly into the raised eyes of his son. "Are
you sure you were not annoying him in any way? Now what were you
doing, exactly?"</p>

<p>"Why, we&mdash;why, we&mdash;now&mdash;Willie Dalzel said I dassent go right up
to him, and I did; and then he did; and then&mdash;the other boys were
'fraid; and then&mdash;you comed."</p>

<p>Trescott groaned deeply. His countenance was so clouded in
sorrow that the lad, bewildered by the mystery of it, burst
suddenly forth in dismal lamentations. "There, there. Don't cry,
Jim," said Trescott, going round the desk. "Only&mdash;" He sat in a
great leather reading-chair, and took the boy on his knee. "Only I
want to explain to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>After Jimmie had gone to school, and as Trescott was about to
start on his round of morning calls, a message arrived from Doctor
Moser. It set forth that the latter's sister was dying in the old
homestead, twenty miles away up the valley, and asked Trescott to
care for his patients for the day at least. There was also in the
envelope a little history of each case and of what had already been
done. Trescott replied to the messenger that he would gladly assent
to the arrangement.</p>

<p>He noted that the first name on Moser's list was Winter, but
this did not seem to strike him as an important fact. When its turn
came, he rang the Winter bell. "Good-morning, Mrs. Winter," he
said, cheerfully, as the door was opened. "Doctor Moser has been
obliged to leave town to-day, and he has asked me to come in his
stead. How is the little girl this morning?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Winter had regarded him in stony surprise. At last she
said: "Come in! I'll see my husband." She bolted into the house.
Trescott entered the hall, and turned to the left into the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>Presently Winter shuffled through the door. His eyes flashed
toward Trescott. He did not betray any desire to advance far into
the room. "What do you want?" he said.</p>

<p>"What do I want? What do I want?" repeated Trescott, lifting his
head suddenly. He had heard an utterly new challenge in the night
of the jungle.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I want to know," snapped Winter. "What do you
want?"</p>

<p>Trescott was silent for a moment. He consulted Moser's
memoranda. "I see that your little girl's case is a trifle
serious," he remarked. "I would advise you to call a physician
soon. I will leave you a copy of Doctor Moser's record to give to
any one you may call." He paused to transcribe the record on a page
of his note-book. Tearing out the leaf, he extended it to Winter as
he moved toward the door. The latter shrunk against the wall. His
head was hanging as he reached for the paper. This caused him to
grasp air, and so Trescott simply let the paper flutter to the feet
of the other man.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said Trescott from the hall. This placid retreat
seemed to suddenly arouse Winter to ferocity. It was as if he had
then recalled all the truths, which he had formulated to hurl at
Trescott. So he followed him into the hall, and down the hall to
the door, and through the door to the porch, barking in fiery rage
from a respectful distance. As Trescott imperturbably turned the
mare's head down the road, Winter stood on the porch, still
yelping. He was like a little dog.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXII.</h3>

<p>"Have you heard the news?" cried Carrie Dungen, as she sped
toward Martha's kitchen. "Have you heard the news?" Her eyes were
shining with delight.</p>

<p>"No," answered Martha's sister Kate, bending forward eagerly.
"What was it? What was it?"</p>

<p>Carrie appeared triumphantly in the open door. "Oh, there's been
an awful scene between Doctor Trescott and Jake Winter. I never
thought that Jake Winter had any pluck at all, but this morning he
told the doctor just what he thought of him."</p>

<p>"Well, what did he think of him?" asked Martha.</p>

<p>"Oh, he called him everything. Mrs. Howarth heard it through her
front blinds. It was terrible, she says. It's all over town now.
Everybody knows it."</p>

<p>"Didn't the doctor answer back?"</p>

<p>"No! Mrs. Howarth&mdash;she says he never said a word. He just walked
down to his buggy and got in, and drove off as co-o-o-l. But Jake
gave him jinks, by all accounts."</p>

<p>"But what did he say?" cried Kate, shrill and excited. She was
evidently at some kind of a feast.</p>

<p>"Oh, he told him that Sadie had never been well since that night
Henry Johnson frightened her at Theresa Page's party, and he held
him responsible, and how dared he cross his
threshold&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what?" said Martha.</p>

<p>"Did he swear at him?" said Kate, in fearsome glee.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not much. He did swear at him a little, but not more than a
man does anyhow when he is real mad, Mrs. Howarth says."</p>

<p>"O-oh!" breathed Kate. "And did he call him any names?"</p>

<p>Martha, at her work, had been for a time in deep thought. She
now interrupted the others. "It don't seem as if Sadie Winter had
been sick since that time Henry Johnson got loose. She's been to
school almost the whole time since then, hasn't she?"</p>

<p>They combined upon her in immediate indignation. "School?
School? I should say not. Don't think for a moment. School!"</p>

<p>Martha wheeled from the sink. She held an iron spoon, and it
seemed as if she was going to attack them. "Sadie Winter has passed
here many a morning since then carrying her school-bag. Where was
she going? To a wedding?"</p>

<p>The others, long accustomed to a mental tyranny, speedily
surrendered.</p>

<p>"Did she?" stammered Kate. "I never saw her."</p>

<p>Carrie Dungen made a weak gesture.</p>

<p>"If I had been Doctor Trescott," exclaimed Martha, loudly, "I'd
have knocked that miserable Jake Winter's head off."</p>

<p>Kate and Carrie, exchanging glances, made an alliance in the
air. "I don't see why you say that, Martha," replied Carrie, with
considerable boldness, gaining support and sympathy from Kate's
smile. "I don't see how anybody can be blamed for getting angry
when their little girl gets almost scared to death and gets sick
from it, and all that. Besides, everybody says&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care what everybody says," said Martha.</p>

<p>"Well, you can't go against the whole town," answered Carrie, in
sudden sharp defiance.</p>

<p>"No, Martha, you can't go against the whole town," piped Kate,
following her leader rapidly.</p>

<p>"'The whole town,'" cried Martha. "I'd like to know what you
call 'the whole town.' Do you call these silly people who are
scared of Henry Johnson 'the whole town'?"</p>

<p>"Why, Martha," said Carrie, in a reasoning tone, "you talk as if
you wouldn't be scared of him!"</p>

<p>"No more would I," retorted Martha.</p>

<p>"O-oh, Martha, how you talk!" said Kate. "Why, the idea!
Everybody's afraid of him."</p>

<p>Carrie was grinning. "You've never seen him, have you?" she
asked, seductively.</p>

<p>"No," admitted Martha.</p>

<p>"Well, then, how do you know that you wouldn't be scared?"</p>

<p>Martha confronted her. "Have you ever seen him? No? Well, then,
how do you know you would be scared?"</p>

<p>The allied forces broke out in chorus: "But, Martha, everybody
says so. Everybody says so."</p>

<p>"Everybody says what?"</p>

<p>"Everybody that's seen him say they were frightened almost to
death. 'Tisn't only women, but it's men too. It's awful."</p>

<p>Martha wagged her head solemnly. "I'd try not to be afraid of
him."</p>

<p>"But supposing you could not help it?" said Kate.</p>

<p>"Yes, and look here," cried Carrie. "I'll tell you another
thing. The Hannigans are going to move out of the house next
door."</p>

<p>"On account of him?" demanded Martha.</p>

<p>Carrie nodded. "Mrs. Hannigan says so herself."</p>

<p>"Well, of all things!" ejaculated Martha. "Going to move, eh?
You don't say so! Where they going to move to?"</p>

<p>"Down on Orchard Avenue."</p>

<p>"Well, of all things! Nice house?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. I haven't heard. But there's lots of
nice houses on Orchard."</p>

<p>"Yes, but they're all taken," said Kate. "There isn't a vacant
house on Orchard Avenue."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, there is," said Martha. "The old Hampstead house is
vacant."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," said Kate. "But then I don't believe Mrs.
Hannigan would like it there. I wonder where they can be going to
move to?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," sighed Martha. "It must be to some
place we don't know about."</p>

<p>"Well," said Carrie Dungen, after a general reflective silence,
"it's easy enough to find out, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Who knows&mdash;around here?" asked Kate.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Smith, and there she is in her garden," said Carrie,
jumping to her feet. As she dashed out of the door, Kate and Martha
crowded at the window. Carrie's voice rang out from near the steps.
"Mrs. Smith! Mrs. Smith! Do you know where the Hannigans are going
to move to?"</p>

<h3>Chapter XXIII.</h3>

<p>The autumn smote the leaves, and the trees of Whilomville were
panoplied in crimson and yellow. The winds grew stronger, and in
the melancholy purple of the nights the home shine of a window
became a finer thing. The little boys, watching the sear and
sorrowful leaves drifting down from the maples, dreamed of the near
time when they could heap bushels in the streets and burn them
during the abrupt evenings.</p>

<p>Three men walked down the Niagara Avenue. As they approached
Judge Hagenthorpe's house he came down his walk to meet them in the
manner of one who has been waiting.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, judge?" one said.</p>

<p>"All ready," he answered.</p>

<p>The four then walked to Trescott's house. He received them in
his office, where he had been reading. He seemed surprised at this
visit of four very active and influential citizens, but he had
nothing to say of it.</p>

<p>After they were all seated, Trescott looked expectantly from one
face to another. There was a little silence. It was broken by John
Twelve, the wholesale grocer, who was worth $400,000, and reported
to be worth over a million.</p>

<p>"Well, doctor," he said, with a short laugh, "I suppose we might
as well admit at once that we've come to interfere in something
which is none of our business."</p>

<p>"Why, what is it?" asked Trescott, again looking from one face
to another. He seemed to appeal particularly to Judge Hagenthorpe,
but the old man had his chin lowered musingly to his cane, and
would not look at him.</p>

<p>"It's about what nobody talks of&mdash;much," said Twelve. "It's
about Henry Johnson."</p>

<p>Trescott squared himself in his chair. "Yes?" he said.</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of the title, Twelve seemed to become
more easy. "Yes," he answered, blandly, "we wanted to talk to you
about it."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Trescott.</p>

<p>Twelve abruptly advanced on the main attack. "Now see here,
Trescott, we like you, and we have come to talk right out about
this business. It may be none of our affairs and all that, and as
for me, I don't mind if you tell me so; but I am not going to keep
quiet and see you ruin yourself. And that's how we all feel."</p>

<p>"I am not ruining myself," answered Trescott.</p>

<p>"No, maybe you are not exactly ruining yourself," said Twelve,
slowly, "but you are doing yourself a great deal of harm. You have
changed from being the leading doctor in town to about the last
one. It is mainly because there are always a large number of people
who are very thoughtless fools, of course, but then that doesn't
change the condition."</p>

<p>A man who had not heretofore spoken said, solemnly, "It's the
women."</p>

<p>"Well, what I want to say is this," resumed Twelve: "Even if
there are a lot of fools in the world, we can't see any reason why
you should ruin yourself by opposing them. You can't teach them
anything, you know."</p>

<p>"I am not trying to teach them anything." Trescott smiled
wearily. "I&mdash;It is a matter of&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And there are a good many of us that admire you for it
immensely," interrupted Twelve; "but that isn't going to change the
minds of all those ninnies."</p>

<p>"It's the women," stated the advocate of this view again.</p>

<p>"Well, what I want to say is this," said Twelve. "We want you to
get out of this trouble and strike your old gait again. You are
simply killing your practice through your infernal pig-headedness.
Now this thing is out of the ordinary, but there must be ways
to&mdash;to beat the game somehow, you see. So we've talked it
over&mdash;about a dozen of us&mdash;and, as I say, if you want to tell us to
mind our own business, why, go ahead; but we've talked it over, and
we've come to the conclusion that the only way to do is to get
Johnson a place somewhere off up the valley, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Trescott wearily gestured. "You don't know, my friend. Everybody
is so afraid of him, they can't even give him good care. Nobody can
attend to him as I do myself."</p>

<p>"But I have a little no-good farm up beyond Clarence Mountain
that I was going to give to Henry," cried Twelve, aggrieved. "And
if you&mdash;and if you&mdash;if you&mdash;through your house burning down, or
anything&mdash;why, all the boys were prepared to take him right off
your hands, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Trescott arose and went to the window. He turned his back upon
them. They sat waiting in silence. When he returned he kept his
face in the shadow. "No, John Twelve," he said, "it can't be
done."</p>

<p>There was another stillness. Suddenly a man stirred on his
chair.</p>

<p>"Well, then, a public institution&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"No," said Trescott; "public institutions are all very good, but
he is not going to one."</p>

<p>In the background of the group old Judge Hagenthorpe was
thoughtfully smoothing the polished ivory head of his cane.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXIV.</h3>

<p>Trescott loudly stamped the snow from his feet and shook the
flakes from his shoulders. When he entered the house he went at
once to the dining-room, and then to the sitting-room. Jimmie was
there, reading painfully in a large book concerning giraffes and
tigers and crocodiles.</p>

<p>"Where is your mother, Jimmie?" asked Trescott.</p>

<p>"I don't know, pa," answered the boy. "I think she is
upstairs."</p>

<p>Trescott went to the foot of the stairs and called, but there
came no answer. Seeing that the door of the little drawing-room was
open, he entered. The room was bathed in the half-light that came
from the four dull panes of mica in the front of the great stove.
As his eyes grew used to the shadows he saw his wife curled in an
arm-chair. He went to her. "Why, Grace," he said, "didn't you hear
me calling you?"</p>

<p>She made no answer, and as he bent over the chair he heard her
trying to smother a sob in the cushion.</p>

<p>"Grace!" he cried. "You're crying!"</p>

<p>She raised her face. "I've got a headache, a dreadful headache,
Ned."</p>

<p>"A headache?" he repeated, in surprise and incredulity.</p>

<p>He pulled a chair close to hers. Later, as he cast his eye over
the zone of light shed by the dull red panes, he saw that a low
table had been drawn close to the stove, and that it was burdened
with many small cups and plates of uncut tea-cake. He remembered
that the day was Wednesday, and that his wife received on
Wednesdays.</p>

<p>"Who was here to-day, Gracie?" he asked.</p>

<p>From his shoulder there came a mumble, "Mrs. Twelve."</p>

<p>"Was she&mdash;um," he said. "Why&mdash;didn't Anna Hagenthorpe come
over?"</p>

<p>The mumble from his shoulder continued, "She wasn't well
enough."</p>

<p>Glancing down at the cups, Trescott mechanically counted them.
There were fifteen of them. "There, there," he said. "Don't cry,
Grace. Don't cry."</p>

<p>The wind was whining round the house, and the snow beat aslant
upon the windows. Sometimes the coal in the stove settled with a
crumbling sound, and the four panes of mica flashed a sudden new
crimson. As he sat holding her head on his shoulder, Trescott found
himself occasionally trying to count the cups. There were fifteen
of them.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>The Blue Hotel</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The Palace Hotel at Fort Romper was painted a light blue, a
shade that is on the legs of a kind of heron, causing the bird to
declare its position against any background. The Palace Hotel,
then, was always screaming and howling in a way that made the
dazzling winter landscape of Nebraska seem only a gray swampish
hush. It stood alone on the prairie, and when the snow was falling
the town two hundred yards away was not visible. But when the
traveler alighted at the railway station he was obliged to pass the
Palace Hotel before he could come upon the company of low
clap-board houses which composed Fort Romper, and it was not to be
thought that any traveler could pass the Palace Hotel without
looking at it. Pat Scully, the proprietor, had proved himself a
master of strategy when he chose his paints. It is true that on
clear days, when the great trans-continental expresses, long lines
of swaying Pullmans, swept through Fort Romper, passengers were
overcome at the sight, and the cult that knows the brown-reds and
the subdivisions of the dark greens of the East expressed shame,
pity, horror, in a laugh. But to the citizens of this prairie town,
and to the people who would naturally stop there, Pat Scully had
performed a feat. With this opulence and splendor, these creeds,
classes, egotisms, that streamed through Romper on the rails day
after day, they had no color in common.</p>

<p>As if the displayed delights of such a blue hotel were not
sufficiently enticing, it was Scully's habit to go every morning
and evening to meet the leisurely trains that stopped at Romper and
work his seductions upon any man that he might see wavering,
gripsack in hand.</p>

<p>One morning, when a snow-crusted engine dragged its long string
of freight cars and its one passenger coach to the station, Scully
performed the marvel of catching three men. One was a shaky and
quick-eyed Swede, with a great shining cheap valise; one was a tall
bronzed cowboy, who was on his way to a ranch near the Dakota line;
one was a little silent man from the East, who didn't look it, and
didn't announce it. Scully practically made them prisoners. He was
so nimble and merry and kindly that each probably felt it would be
the height of brutality to try to escape. They trudged off over the
creaking board sidewalks in the wake of the eager little Irishman.
He wore a heavy fur cap squeezed tightly down on his head. It
caused his two red ears to stick out stiffly, as if they were made
of tin.</p>

<p>At last, Scully, elaborately, with boisterous hospitality,
conducted them through the portals of the blue hotel. The room
which they entered was small. It seemed to be merely a proper
temple for an enormous stove, which, in the center, was humming
with godlike violence. At various points on its surface the iron
had become luminous and glowed yellow from the heat. Beside the
stove Scully's son Johnnie was playing High-Five with an old farmer
who had whiskers both gray and sandy. They were quarreling.
Frequently the old farmer turned his face toward a box of
sawdust&mdash;colored brown from tobacco juice&mdash;that was behind the
stove, and spat with an air of great impatience and irritation.
With a loud flourish of words Scully destroyed the game of cards,
and bustled his son upstairs with part of the baggage of the new
guests. He himself conducted them to three basins of the coldest
water in the world. The cowboy and the Easterner burnished
themselves fiery red with this water, until it seemed to be some
kind of a metal polish. The Swede, however, merely dipped his
fingers gingerly and with trepidation. It was notable that
throughout this series of small ceremonies the three travelers were
made to feel that Scully was very benevolent. He was conferring
great favors upon them. He handed the towel from one to the other
with an air of philanthropic impulse.</p>

<p>Afterward they went to the first room, and, sitting about the
stove, listened to Scully's officious clamor at his daughters, who
were preparing the midday meal. They reflected in the silence of
experienced men who tread carefully amid new people. Nevertheless,
the old farmer, stationary, invincible in his chair near the
warmest part of the stove, turned his face from the sawdust box
frequently and addressed a glowing commonplace to the strangers.
Usually he was answered in short but adequate sentences by either
the cowboy or the Easterner. The Swede said nothing. He seemed to
be occupied in making furtive estimates of each man in the room.
One might have thought that he had the sense of silly suspicion
which comes to guilt. He resembled a badly frightened man.</p>

<p>Later, at dinner, he spoke a little, addressing his conversation
entirely to Scully. He volunteered that he had come from New York,
where for ten years he had worked as a tailor. These facts seemed
to strike Scully as fascinating, and afterward he volunteered that
he had lived at Romper for fourteen years. The Swede asked about
the crops and the price of labor. He seemed barely to listen to
Scully's extended replies. His eyes continued to rove from man to
man.</p>

<p>Finally, with a laugh and a wink, he said that some of these
Western communities were very dangerous; and after his statement he
straightened his legs under the table, tilted his head, and laughed
again, loudly. It was plain that the demonstration had no meaning
to the others. They looked at him wondering and in silence.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>As the men trooped heavily back into the front room, the two
little windows presented views of a turmoiling sea of snow. The
huge arms of the wind were making attempts&mdash;mighty, circular,
futile&mdash;to embrace the flakes as they sped. A gate-post like a
still man with a blanched face stood aghast amid this profligate
fury. In a hearty voice Scully announced the presence of a
blizzard. The guests of the blue hotel, lighting their pipes,
assented with grunts of lazy masculine contentment. No island of
the sea could be exempt in the degree of this little room with its
humming stove. Johnnie, son of Scully, in a tone which defined his
opinion of his ability as a card-player, challenged the old farmer
of both gray and sandy whiskers to a game of High-Five. The farmer
agreed with a contemptuous and bitter scoff. They sat close to the
stove, and squared their knees under a wide board. The cowboy and
the Easterner watched the game with interest. The Swede remained
near the window, aloof, but with a countenance that showed signs of
an inexplicable excitement.</p>

<p>The play of Johnnie and the gray-beard was suddenly ended by
another quarrel. The old man arose while casting a look of heated
scorn at his adversary. He slowly buttoned his coat, and then
stalked with fabulous dignity from the room. In the discreet
silence of all other men the Swede laughed. His laughter rang
somehow childish. Men by this time had begun to look at him
askance, as if they wished to inquire what ailed him.</p>

<p>A new game was formed jocosely. The cowboy volunteered to become
the partner of Johnnie, and they all then turned to ask the Swede
to throw in his lot with the little Easterner. He asked some
questions about the game, and learning that it wore many names, and
that he had played it when it was under an alias, he accepted the
invitation. He strode toward the men nervously, as if he expected
to be assaulted. Finally, seated, he gazed from face to face and
laughed shrilly. This laugh was so strange that the Easterner
looked up quickly, the cowboy sat intent and with his mouth open,
and Johnnie paused, holding the cards with still fingers.</p>

<p>Afterward there was a short silence. Then Johnnie said: "Well,
let's get at it. Come on now!" They pulled their chairs forward
until their knees were bunched under the board. They began to play,
and their interest in the game caused the others to forget the
manner of the Swede.</p>

<p>The cowboy was a board-whacker. Each time that he held superior
cards he whanged them, one by one, with exceeding force, down upon
the improvised table, and took the tricks with a glowing air of
prowess and pride that sent thrills of indignation into the hearts
of his opponents. A game with a board-whacker in it is sure to
become intense. The countenances of the Easterner and the Swede
were miserable whenever the cowboy thundered down his aces and
kings, while Johnnie, his eyes gleaming with joy, chuckled and
chuckled.</p>

<p>Because of the absorbing play none considered the strange ways
of the Swede. They paid strict heed to the game. Finally, during a
lull caused by a new deal, the Swede suddenly addressed Johnnie: "I
suppose there have been a good many men killed in this room." The
jaws of the others dropped and they looked at him.</p>

<p>"What in hell are you talking about?" said Johnnie.</p>

<p>The Swede laughed again his blatant laugh, full of a kind of
false courage and defiance. "Oh, you know what I mean all right,"
he answered.</p>

<p>"I'm a liar if I do!" Johnnie protested. The card was halted,
and the men stared at the Swede. Johnnie evidently felt that as the
son of the proprietor he should make a direct inquiry. "Now, what
might you be drivin' at, mister?" he asked. The Swede winked at
him. It was a wink full of cunning. His fingers shook on the edge
of the board. "Oh, maybe you think I have been to nowheres. Maybe
you think I'm a tenderfoot?"</p>

<p>"I don't know nothin' about you," answered Johnnie, "and I don't
give a damn where you've been. All I got to say is that I don't
know what you're driving at. There hain't never been nobody killed
in this room."</p>

<p>The cowboy, who had been steadily gazing at the Swede, then
spoke. "What's wrong with you, mister?"</p>

<p>Apparently it seemed to the Swede that he was formidably
menaced. He shivered and turned white near the corners of his
mouth. He sent an appealing glance in the direction of the little
Easterner. During these moments he did not forget to wear his air
of advanced pot-valor. "They say they don't know what I mean," he
remarked mockingly to the Easterner.</p>

<p>The latter answered after prolonged and cautious reflection. "I
don't understand you," he said, impassively.</p>

<p>The Swede made a movement then which announced that he thought
he had encountered treachery from the only quarter where he had
expected sympathy if not help. "Oh, I see you are all against me. I
see-"</p>

<p>The cowboy was in a state of deep stupefaction. "Say," he cried,
as he tumbled the deck violently down upon the board. "Say, what
are you gittin' at, hey?"</p>

<p>The Swede sprang up with the celerity of a man escaping from a
snake on the floor. "I don't want to fight!" he shouted. "I don't
want to fight!"</p>

<p>The cowboy stretched his long legs indolently and deliberately.
His hands were in his pockets. He spat into the sawdust box. "Well,
who the hell thought you did?" he inquired.</p>

<p>The Swede backed rapidly toward a corner of the room. His hands
were out protectingly in front of his chest, but he was making an
obvious struggle to control his fright. "Gentlemen," he quavered,
"I suppose I am going to be killed before I can leave this house! I
suppose I am going to be killed before I can leave this house." In
his eyes was the dying swan look. Through the windows could be seen
the snow turning blue in the shadow of dusk. The wind tore at the
house and some loose thing beat regularly against the clap-boards
like a spirit tapping.</p>

<p>A door opened, and Scully himself entered. He paused in surprise
as he noted the tragic attitude of the Swede. Then he said: "What's
the matter here?"</p>

<p>The Swede answered him swiftly and eagerly: "These men are going
to kill me."</p>

<p>"Kill you!" ejaculated Scully. "Kill you! What are you
talkin'?"</p>

<p>The Swede made the gesture of a martyr.</p>

<p>Scully wheeled sternly upon his son. "What is this,
Johnnie?"</p>

<p>The lad had grown sullen. "Damned if I know," he answered. "I
can't make no sense to it." He began to shuffle the cards,
fluttering them together with an angry snap. "He says a good many
men have been killed in this room, or something like that. And he
says he's goin' to be killed here too. I don't know what ails him.
He's crazy, I shouldn't wonder."</p>

<p>Scully then looked for explanation to the cowboy, but the cowboy
simply shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Kill you?" said Scully again to the Swede. "Kill you? Man,
you're off your nut."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," burst out the Swede. "I know what will happen.
Yes, I'm crazy&mdash;yes. Yes, of course, I'm crazy&mdash;yes. But I know one
thing&mdash;" There was a sort of sweat of misery and terror upon his
face. "I know I won't get out of here alive."</p>

<p>The cowboy drew a deep breath, as if his mind was passing into
the last stages of dissolution. "Well, I'm dog-goned," he whispered
to himself.</p>

<p>Scully wheeled suddenly and faced his son. "You've been
troublin' this man!"</p>

<p>Johnnie's voice was loud with its burden of grievance. "Why,
good Gawd, I ain't done nothin' to 'im."</p>

<p>The Swede broke in. "Gentlemen, do not disturb yourselves. I
will leave this house. I will go 'way because-" He accused them
dramatically with his glance. "Because I do not want to be
killed."</p>

<p>Scully was furious with his son. "Will you tell me what is the
matter, you young divil? What's the matter, anyhow? Speak out!"</p>

<p>"Blame it," cried Johnnie in despair, "don't I tell you I don't
know. He&mdash;he says we want to kill him, and that's all I know. I
can't tell what ails him."</p>

<p>The Swede continued to repeat: "Never mind, Mr. Scully, never
mind. I will leave this house. I will go away, because I do not
wish to be killed. Yes, of course, I am crazy&mdash;yes. But I know one
thing! I will go away. I will leave this house. Never mind, Mr.
Scully, never mind. I will go away."</p>

<p>"You will not go 'way," said Scully. "You will not go 'way until
I hear the reason of this business. If anybody has troubled you I
will take care of him. This is my house. You are under my roof, and
I will not allow any peaceable man to be troubled here." He cast a
terrible eye upon Johnnie, the cowboy, and the Easterner.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Mr. Scully; never mind. I will go 'way. I do not
wish to be killed." The Swede moved toward the door, which opened
upon the stairs. It was evidently his intention to go at once for
his baggage.</p>

<p>"No, no," shouted Scully peremptorily; but the whitefaced man
slid by him and disappeared. "Now," said Scully severely, "what
does this mane?"</p>

<p>Johnnie and the cowboy cried together: "Why, we didn't do
nothin' to 'im!"</p>

<p>Scully's eyes were cold. "No," he said, "you didn't?"</p>

<p>Johnnie swore a deep oath. "Why, this is the wildest loon I ever
see. We didn't do nothin' at all. We were jest sittin' here playin'
cards and he&mdash;"</p>

<p>The father suddenly spoke to the Easterner. "Mr. Blanc," he
asked, "what has these boys been doin'?"</p>

<p>The Easterner reflected again. "I didn't see anything wrong at
all," he said at last slowly.</p>

<p>Scully began to howl. "But what does it mane?" He stared
ferociously at his son. "I have a mind to lather you for this, me
boy."</p>

<p>Johnnie was frantic. "Well, what have I done?" he bawled at his
father.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>"I think you are tongue-tied," said Scully finally to his son,
the cowboy and the Easterner, and at the end of this scornful
sentence he left the room.</p>

<p>Upstairs the Swede was swiftly fastening the straps of his great
valise. Once his back happened to be half-turned toward the door,
and hearing a noise there, he wheeled and sprang up, uttering a
loud cry. Scully's wrinkled visage showed grimly in the light of
the small lamp he carried. This yellow effulgence, streaming
upward, colored only his prominent features, and left his eyes, for
instance, in mysterious shadow. He resembled a murderer.</p>

<p>"Man, man!" he exclaimed, "have you gone daffy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Oh, no!" rejoined the other. "There are people in this
world who know pretty nearly as much as you do&mdash;understand?"</p>

<p>For a moment they stood gazing at each other. Upon the Swede's
deathly pale cheeks were two spots brightly crimson and sharply
edged, as if they had been carefully painted. Scully placed the
light on the table and sat himself on the edge of the bed. He spoke
ruminatively. "By cracky, I never heard of such a thing in my life.
It's a complete muddle. I can't for the soul of me think how you
ever got this idea into your head." Presently he lifted his eyes
and asked: "And did you sure think they were going to kill
you?"</p>

<p>The Swede scanned the old man as if he wished to see into his
mind. "I did," he said at last. He obviously suspected that this
answer might precipitate an outbreak. As he pulled on a strap his
whole arm shook, the elbow wavering like a bit of paper.</p>

<p>Scully banged his hand impressively on the foot-board of the
bed. "Why, man, we're goin' to have a line of ilictric street-cars
in this town next spring."</p>

<p>"'A line of electric street-cars,'" repeated the Swede
stupidly.</p>

<p>"And," said Scully, "there's a new railroad goin' to be built
down from Broken Arm to here. Not to mintion the four churches and
the smashin' big brick schoolhouse. Then there's the big factory,
too. Why, in two years Romper'll be a met-tro-pol-is."</p>

<p>Having finished the preparation of his baggage, the Swede
straightened himself. "Mr. Scully," he said with sudden hardihood,
"how much do I owe you?"</p>

<p>"You don't owe me anythin'," said the old man angrily.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," retorted the Swede. He took seventy-five cents from
his pocket and tendered it to Scully; but the latter snapped his
fingers in disdainful refusal. However, it happened that they both
stood gazing in a strange fashion at three silver pieces in the
Swede's open palm.</p>

<p>"I'll not take your money," said Scully at last. "Not after
what's been goin' on here." Then a plan seemed to strike him.
"Here," he cried, picking up his lamp and moving toward the door.
"Here! Come with me a minute."</p>

<p>"No," said the Swede in overwhelming alarm.</p>

<p>"Yes," urged the old man. "Come on! I want you to come and see a
picter&mdash;just across the hall&mdash;in my room."</p>

<p>The Swede must have concluded that his hour was come. His jaw
dropped and his teeth showed like a dead man's. He ultimately
followed Scully across the corridor, but he had the step of one
hung in chains.</p>

<p>Scully flashed the light high on the wall of his own chamber.
There was revealed a ridiculous photograph of a little girl. She
was leaning against a balustrade of gorgeous decoration, and the
formidable bang to her hair was prominent. The figure was as
graceful as an upright sled-stake, and, withal, it was of the hue
of lead. "There," said Scully tenderly. "That's the picter of my
little girl that died. Her name was Carrie. She had the purtiest
hair you ever saw! I was that fond of her, she&mdash;"</p>

<p>Turning then he saw that the Swede was not contemplating the
picture at all, but, instead, was keeping keen watch on the gloom
in the rear.</p>

<p>"Look, man!" shouted Scully heartily. "That's the picter of my
little gal that died. Her name was Carrie. And then here's the
picter of my oldest boy, Michael. He's a lawyer in Lincoln an'
doin' well. I gave that boy a grand eddycation, and I'm glad for it
now. He's a fine boy. Look at 'im now. Ain't he bold as blazes, him
there in Lincoln, an honored an' respicted gintleman. An honored
an' respicted gintleman," concluded Scully with a flourish. And so
saying, he smote the Swede jovially on the back.</p>

<p>The Swede faintly smiled.</p>

<p>"Now," said the old man, "there's only one more thing." He
dropped suddenly to the floor and thrust his head beneath the bed.
The Swede could hear his muffled voice. "I'd keep it under me
piller if it wasn't for that boy Johnnie. Then there's the old
woman&mdash;Where is it now? I never put it twice in the same place. Ah,
now come out with you!"</p>

<p>Presently he backed clumsily from under the bed, dragging with
him an old coat rolled into a bundle. "I've fetched him" he
muttered. Kneeling on the floor he unrolled the coat and extracted
from its heart a large yellow-brown whisky bottle.</p>

<p>His first maneuver was to hold the bottle up to the light.
Reassured, apparently, that nobody had been tampering with it, he
thrust it with a generous movement toward the Swede.</p>

<p>The weak-kneed Swede was about to eagerly clutch this element of
strength, but he suddenly jerked his hand away and cast a look of
horror upon Scully.</p>

<p>"Drink," said the old man affectionately. He had arisen to his
feet, and now stood facing the Swede.</p>

<p>There was a silence. Then again Scully said: "Drink!"</p>

<p>The Swede laughed wildly. He grabbed the bottle, put it to his
mouth, and as his lips curled absurdly around the opening and his
throat worked, he kept his glance burning with hatred upon the old
man's face.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>After the departure of Scully the three men, with the card-board
still upon their knees, preserved for a long time an astounded
silence. Then Johnnie said: "That's the dod-dangest Swede I ever
see."</p>

<p>"He ain't no Swede," said the cowboy scornfully.</p>

<p>"Well, what is he then?" cried Johnnie. "What is he then?"</p>

<p>"It's my opinion," replied the cowboy deliberately, "he's some
kind of a Dutchman." It was a venerable custom of the country to
entitle as Swedes all light-haired men who spoke with a heavy
tongue. In consequence the idea of the cowboy was not without its
daring. "Yes, sir," he repeated. "It's my opinion this feller is
some kind of a Dutchman."</p>

<p>"Well, he says he's a Swede, anyhow," muttered Johnnie sulkily.
He turned to the Easterner: "What do you think, Mr. Blanc?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," replied the Easterner.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think makes him act that way?" asked the
cowboy.</p>

<p>"Why, he's frightened!" The Easterner knocked his pipe against a
rim of the stove. "He's clear frightened out of his boots."</p>

<p>"What at?" cried Johnnie and cowboy together.</p>

<p>The Easterner reflected over his answer.</p>

<p>"What at?" cried the others again.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, but it seems to me this man has been reading
dime-novels, and he thinks he's right out in the middle of it&mdash;the
shootin' and stabbin' and all."</p>

<p>"But," said the cowboy, deeply scandalized, "this ain't Wyoming,
ner none of them places. This is Nebrasker."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Johnnie, "an' why don't he wait till he gits out
West?"</p>

<p>The traveled Easterner laughed. "It isn't different there
even&mdash;not in these days. But he thinks he's right in the middle of
hell."</p>

<p>Johnnie and the cowboy mused long.</p>

<p>"It's awful funny," remarked Johnnie at last.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the cowboy. "This is a queer game. I hope we don't
git snowed in, because then we'd have to stand this here man bein'
around with us all the time. That wouldn't be no good."</p>

<p>"I wish pop would throw him out," said Johnnie.</p>

<p>Presently they heard a loud stamping on the stairs, accompanied
by ringing jokes in the voice of old Scully, and laughter,
evidently from the Swede. The men around the stove stared vacantly
at each other. "Gosh," said the cowboy. The door flew open, and old
Scully, flushed and anecdotal, came into the room. He was jabbering
at the Swede, who followed him, laughing bravely. It was the entry
of two roysterers from a banquet hall.</p>

<p>"Come now," said Scully sharply to the three seated men, "move
up and give us a chance at the stove." The cowboy and the Easterner
obediently sidled their chairs to make room for the newcomers.
Johnnie, however, simply arranged himself in a more indolent
attitude, and then remained motionless.</p>

<p>"Come! Git over, there," said Scully.</p>

<p>"Plenty of room on the other side of the stove," said
Johnnie.</p>

<p>"Do you think we want to sit in the draught?" roared the
father.</p>

<p>But the Swede here interposed with a grandeur of confidence.
"No, no. Let the boy sit where he likes," he cried in a bullying
voice to the father.</p>

<p>"All right! All right!" said Scully deferentially. The cowboy
and the Easterner exchanged glances of wonder.</p>

<p>The five chairs were formed in a crescent about one side of the
stove. The Swede began to talk; he talked arrogantly, profanely,
angrily. Johnnie, the cowboy and the Easterner maintained a morose
silence, while old Scully appeared to be receptive and eager,
breaking in constantly with sympathetic ejaculations.</p>

<p>Finally the Swede announced that he was thirsty. He moved in his
chair, and said that he would go for a drink of water.</p>

<p>"I'll git it for you," cried Scully at once.</p>

<p>"No," said the Swede contemptuously. "I'll get it for myself."
He arose and stalked with the air of an owner off into the
executive parts of the hotel.</p>

<p>As soon as the Swede was out of hearing Scully sprang to his
feet and whispered intensely to the others. "Upstairs he thought I
was tryin' to poison 'im."</p>

<p>"Say," said Johnnie, "this makes me sick. Why don't you throw
'im out in the snow?"</p>

<p>"Why, he's all right now," declared Scully. "It was only that he
was from the East and he thought this was a tough place. That's
all. He's all right now."</p>

<p>The cowboy looked with admiration upon the Easterner. "You were
straight," he said, "You were on to that there Dutchman."</p>

<p>"Well," said Johnnie to his father, "he may be all right now,
but I don't see it. Other time he was scared, and now he's too
fresh."</p>

<p>Scully's speech was always a combination of Irish brogue and
idiom, Western twang and idiom, and scraps of curiously formal
diction taken from the story-books and newspapers. He now hurled a
strange mass of language at the head of his son. "What do I keep?
What do I keep? What do I keep?" he demanded in a voice of thunder.
He slapped his knee impressively, to indicate that he himself was
going to make reply, and that all should heed. "I keep a hotel," he
shouted. "A hotel, do you mind? A guest under my roof has sacred
privileges. He is to be intimidated by none. Not one word shall he
hear that would prijudice him in favor of goin' away. I'll not have
it. There's no place in this here town where they can say they iver
took in a guest of mine because he was afraid to stay here." He
wheeled suddenly upon the cowboy and the Easterner. "Am I
right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Scully," said the cowboy, "I think you're right."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Scully," said the Easterner, "I think you're
right."</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>At six-o'clock supper, the Swede fizzed like a firewheel. He
sometimes seemed on the point of bursting into riotous song, and in
all his madness he was encouraged by old Scully. The Easterner was
incased in reserve; the cowboy sat in wide-mouthed amazement,
forgetting to eat, while Johnnie wrathily demolished great plates
of food. The daughters of the house when they were obliged to
replenish the biscuits approached as warily as Indians, and, having
succeeded in their purposes, fled with ill-concealed trepidation.
The Swede domineered the whole feast, and he gave it the appearance
of a cruel bacchanal. He seemed to have grown suddenly taller; he
gazed, brutally disdainful, into every face. His voice rang through
the room. Once when he jabbed out harpoon-fashion with his fork to
pinion a biscuit the weapon nearly impaled the hand of the
Easterner which had been stretched quietly out for the same
biscuit.</p>

<p>After supper, as the men filed toward the other room, the Swede
smote Scully ruthlessly on the shoulder. "Well, old boy, that was a
good square meal." Johnnie looked hopefully at his father; he knew
that shoulder was tender from an old fall; and indeed it appeared
for a moment as if Scully was going to flame out over the matter,
but in the end he smiled a sickly smile and remained silent. The
others understood from his manner that he was admitting his
responsibility for the Swede's new viewpoint.</p>

<p>Johnnie, however, addressed his parent in an aside. "Why don't
you license somebody to kick you downstairs?" Scully scowled darkly
by way of reply.</p>

<p>When they were gathered about the stove, the Swede insisted on
another game of High-Five. Scully gently deprecated the plan at
first, but the Swede turned a wolfish glare upon him. The old man
subsided, and the Swede canvassed the others. In his tone there was
always a great threat. The cowboy and the Easterner both remarked
indifferently that they would play. Scully said that he would
presently have to go to meet the 6.58 train, and so the Swede
turned menacingly upon Johnnie. For a moment their glances crossed
like blades, and then Johnnie smiled and said: "Yes, I'll
play."</p>

<p>They formed a square with the little board on their knees. The
Easterner and the Swede were again partners. As the play went on,
it was noticeable that the cowboy was not board-whacking as usual.
Meanwhile, Scully, near the lamp, had put on his spectacles and,
with an appearance curiously like an old priest, was reading a
newspaper. In time he went out to meet the 6.58 train, and, despite
his precautions, a gust of polar wind whirled into the room as he
opened the door. Besides scattering the cards, it chilled the
players to the marrow. The Swede cursed frightfully. When Scully
returned, his entrance disturbed a cozy and friendly scene. The
Swede again cursed. But presently they were once more intent, their
heads bent forward and their hands moving swiftly. The Swede had
adopted the fashion of board-whacking.</p>

<p>Scully took up his paper and for a long time remained immersed
in matters which were extraordinarily remote from him. The lamp
burned badly, and once he stopped to adjust the wick. The newspaper
as he turned from page to page rustled with a slow and comfortable
sound. Then suddenly he heard three terrible words: "You are
cheatin'!"</p>

<p>Such scenes often prove that there can be little of dramatic
import in environment. Any room can present a tragic front; any
room can be comic. This little den was now hideous as a
torture-chamber. The new faces of the men themselves had changed it
upon the instant. The Swede held a huge fist in front of Johnnie's
face, while the latter looked steadily over it into the blazing
orbs of his accuser. The Easterner had grown pallid; the cowboy's
jaw had dropped in that expression of bovine amazement which was
one of his important mannerisms. After the three words, the first
sound in the room was made by Scully's paper as it floated
forgotten to his feet. His spectacles had also fallen from his
nose, but by a clutch he had saved them in air. His hand, grasping
the spectacles, now remained poised awkwardly and near his
shoulder. He stared at the card-players.</p>

<p>Probably the silence was while a second elapsed. Then, if the
floor had been suddenly twitched out from under the men they could
not have moved quicker. The five had projected themselves headlong
toward a common point. It happened that Johnnie in rising to hurl
himself upon the Swede had stumbled slightly because of his
curiously instinctive care for the cards and the board. The loss of
the moment allowed time for the arrival of Scully, and also allowed
the cowboy time to give the Swede a great push which sent him
staggering back. The men found tongue together, and hoarse shouts
or rage, appeal or fear burst from every throat. The cowboy pushed
and jostled feverishly at the Swede, and the Easterner and Scully
clung wildly to Johnnie; but, through the smoky air, above the
swaying bodies of the peace-compellers, the eyes of the two
warriors ever sought each other in glances of challenge that were
at once hot and steely.</p>

<p>Of course the board had been overturned, and now the whole
company of cards was scattered over the floor, where the boots of
the men trampled the fat and painted kings and queens as they gazed
with their silly eyes at the war that was waging above them.</p>

<p>Scully's voice was dominating the yells. "Stop now! Stop, I say!
Stop, now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Johnnie, as he struggled to burst through the rank formed by
Scully and the Easterner, was crying: "Well, he says I cheated! He
says I cheated! I won't allow no man to say I cheated! If he says I
cheated, he's a&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The cowboy was telling the Swede: "Quit, now! Quit, d'ye
hear&mdash;"</p>

<p>The screams of the Swede never ceased. "He did cheat! I saw him!
I saw him&mdash;"</p>

<p>As for the Easterner, he was importuning in a voice that was not
heeded. "Wait a moment, can't you? Oh, wait a moment. What's the
good of a fight over a game of cards? Wait a moment-"</p>

<p>In this tumult no complete sentences were clear.
"Cheat"&mdash;"Quit"&mdash;"He says"&mdash;These fragments pierced the uproar and
rang out sharply. It was remarkable that whereas Scully undoubtedly
made the most noise, he was the least heard of any of the riotous
band.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there was a great cessation. It was as if each man
had paused for breath, and although the room was still lighted with
the anger of men, it could be seen that there was no danger of
immediate conflict, and at once Johnnie, shouldering his ways
forward, almost succeeded in confronting the Swede. "What did you
say I cheated for? What did you say I cheated for? I don't cheat
and I won't let no man say I do!"</p>

<p>The Swede said: "I saw you! I saw you!"</p>

<p>"Well," cried Johnnie, "I'll fight any man what says I
cheat!"</p>

<p>"No, you won't," said the cowboy. "Not here."</p>

<p>"Ah, be still, can't you?" said Scully, coming between them.</p>

<p>The quiet was sufficient to allow the Easterner's voice to be
heard. He was repeating: "Oh, wait a moment, can't you? What's the
good of a fight over a game of cards? Wait a moment."</p>

<p>Johnnie, his red face appearing above his father's shoulder,
hailed the Swede again. "Did you say I cheated?"</p>

<p>The Swede showed his teeth. "Yes."</p>

<p>"Then," said Johnnie, "we must fight."</p>

<p>"Yes, fight," roared the Swede. He was like a demoniac. "Yes,
fight! I'll show you what kind of a man I am! I'll show you who you
want to fight! Maybe you think I can't fight! Maybe you think I
can't! I'll show you, you skin, you card-sharp! Yes, you cheated!
You cheated! You cheated!"</p>

<p>"Well, let's git at it, then, mister," said Johnnie coolly.</p>

<p>The cowboy's brow was beaded with sweat from his efforts in
intercepting all sorts of raids. He turned in despair to Scully.
"What are you goin' to do now?"</p>

<p>A change had come over the Celtic visage of the old man. He now
seemed all eagerness; his eyes glowed.</p>

<p>"We'll let them fight," he answered stalwartly. "I can't put up
with it any longer. I've stood this damned Swede till I'm sick.
We'll let them fight."</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The men prepared to go out of doors. The Easterner was so
nervous that he had great difficulty in getting his arms into the
sleeves of his new leather-coat. As the cowboy drew his fur-cap
down over his ears his hands trembled. In fact, Johnnie and old
Scully were the only ones who displayed no agitation. These
preliminaries were conducted without words.</p>

<p>Scully threw open the door. "Well, come on," he said. Instantly
a terrific wind caused the flame of the lamp to struggle at its
wick, while a puff of black smoke sprang from the chimney-top. The
stove was in mid-current of the blast, and its voice swelled to
equal the roar of the storm. Some of the scarred and bedabbled
cards were caught up from the floor and dashed helplessly against
the further wall. The men lowered their heads and plunged into the
tempest as into a sea.</p>

<p>No snow was falling, but great whirls and clouds of flakes,
swept up from the ground by the frantic winds, were streaming
southward with the speed of bullets. The covered land was blue with
the sheen of an unearthly satin, and there was no other hue save
where at the low black railway station&mdash;which seemed incredibly
distant&mdash;one light gleamed like a tiny jewel. As the men floundered
into a thigh-deep drift, it was known that the Swede was bawling
out something. Scully went to him, put a hand on his shoulder and
projected an ear. "What's that you say?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"I say," bawled the Swede again, "I won't stand much show
against this gang. I know you'll all pitch on me."</p>

<p>Scully smote him reproachfully on the arm. "Tut, man," he
yelled. The wind tore the words from Scully's lips and scattered
them far a-lee.</p>

<p>"You are all a gang of&mdash;" boomed the Swede, but the storm also
seized the remainder of this sentence.</p>

<p>Immediately turning their backs upon the wind, the men had swung
around a corner to the sheltered side of the hotel. It was the
function of the little house to preserve here, amid this great
devastation of snow, an irregular V-shape of heavily-incrusted
grass, which crackled beneath the feet. One could imagine the great
drifts piled against the windward side. When the party reached the
comparative peace of this spot it was found that the Swede was
still bellowing.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what kind of a thing this is! I know you'll all
pitch on me. I can't lick you all!"</p>

<p>Scully turned upon him panther-fashion. "You'll not have to whip
all of us. You'll have to whip my son Johnnie. An' the man what
troubles you durin' that time will have me to dale with."</p>

<p>The arrangements were swiftly made. The two men faced each
other, obedient to the harsh commands of Scully, whose face, in the
subtly luminous gloom, could be seen set in the austere impersonal
lines that are pictured on the countenances of the Roman veterans.
The Easterner's teeth were chattering, and he was hopping up and
down like a mechanical toy. The cowboy stood rock-like.</p>

<p>The contestants had not stripped off any clothing. Each was in
his ordinary attire. Their fists were up, and they eyed each other
in a calm that had the elements of leonine cruelty in it.</p>

<p>During this pause, the Easterner's mind, like a film, took
lasting impressions of three men&mdash;the iron-nerved master of the
ceremony; the Swede, pale, motionless, terrible; and Johnnie,
serene yet ferocious, brutish yet heroic. The entire prelude had in
it a tragedy greater than the tragedy of action, and this aspect
was accentuated by the long mellow cry of the blizzard, as it sped
the tumbling and wailing flakes into the black abyss of the
south.</p>

<p>"Now!" said Scully.</p>

<p>The two combatants leaped forward and crashed together like
bullocks. There was heard the cushioned sound of blows, and of a
curse squeezing out from between the tight teeth of one.</p>

<p>As for the spectators, the Easterner's pent-up breath exploded
from him with a pop of relief, absolute relief from the tension of
the preliminaries. The cowboy bounded into the air with a yowl.
Scully was immovable as from supreme amazement and fear at the fury
of the fight which he himself had permitted and arranged.</p>

<p>For a time the encounter in the darkness was such a perplexity
of flying arms that it presented no more detail than would a
swiftly-revolving wheel. Occasionally a face, as if illumined by a
flash of light, would shine out, ghastly and marked with pink
spots. A moment later, the men might have been known as shadows, if
it were not for the involuntary utterance of oaths that came from
them in whispers.</p>

<p>Suddenly a holocaust of warlike desire caught the cowboy, and he
bolted forward with the speed of a broncho. "Go it, Johnnie; go it!
Kill him! Kill him!"</p>

<p>Scully confronted him. "Kape back," he said; and by his glance
the cowboy could tell that this man was Johnnie's father.</p>

<p>To the Easterner there was a monotony of unchangeable fighting
that was an abomination. This confused mingling was eternal to his
sense, which was concentrated in a longing for the end, the
priceless end. Once the fighters lurched near him, and as he
scrambled hastily backward, he heard them breathe like men on the
rack.</p>

<p>"Kill him, Johnnie! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!" The cowboy's
face was contorted like one of those agony masks in museums.</p>

<p>"Keep still," said Scully icily.</p>

<p>Then there was a sudden loud grunt, incomplete, cut short, and
Johnnie's body swung away from the Swede and fell with sickening
heaviness to the grass. The cowboy was barely in time to prevent
the mad Swede from flinging himself upon his prone adversary. "No,
you don't," said the cowboy, interposing an arm. "Wait a
second."</p>

<p>Scully was at his son's side. "Johnnie! Johnnie, me boy?" His
voice had a quality of melancholy tenderness. "Johnnie? Can you go
on with it?" He looked anxiously down into the bloody pulpy face of
his son.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, and then Johnnie answered in his
ordinary voice: "Yes, I&mdash;it&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>Assisted by his father he struggled to his feet. "Wait a bit now
till you git your wind," said the old man.</p>

<p>A few paces away the cowboy was lecturing the Swede. "No, you
don't! Wait a second!"</p>

<p>The Easterner was plucking at Scully's sleeve. "Oh, this is
enough," he pleaded. "This is enough! Let it go as it stands. This
is enough!"</p>

<p>"Bill," said Scully, "git out of the road." The cowboy stepped
aside. "Now." The combatants were actuated by a new caution as they
advanced toward collision. They glared at each other, and then the
Swede aimed a lightning blow that carried with it his entire
weight. Johnnie was evidently half-stupid from weakness, but he
miraculously dodged, and his fist sent the over-balanced Swede
sprawling.</p>

<p>The cowboy, Scully and the Easterner burst into a cheer that was
like a chorus of triumphant soldiery, but before its conclusion the
Swede had scuffled agilely to his feet and come in berserk abandon
at his foe. There was another perplexity of flying arms, and
Johnnie's body again swung away and fell, even as a bundle might
fall from a roof. The Swede instantly staggered to a little
wind-waved tree and leaned upon it, breathing like an engine, while
his savage and flame-lit eyes roamed from face to face as the men
bent over Johnnie. There was a splendor of isolation in his
situation at this time which the Easterner felt once when, lifting
his eyes from the man on the ground, he beheld that mysterious and
lonely figure, waiting.</p>

<p>"Are you any good yet, Johnnie?" asked Scully in a broken
voice.</p>

<p>The son gasped and opened his eyes languidly. After a moment he
answered: "No&mdash;I ain't&mdash;any good&mdash;any&mdash;more." Then, from shame and
bodily ill, he began to weep, the tears furrowing down through the
bloodstains on his face. "He was too&mdash;too&mdash;too heavy for me."</p>

<p>Scully straightened and addressed the waiting figure.
"Stranger," he said, evenly, "it's all up with our side." Then his
voice changed into that vibrant huskiness which is commonly the
tone of the most simple and deadly announcements. "Johnnie is
whipped."</p>

<p>Without replying, the victor moved off on the route to the front
door of the hotel.</p>

<p>The cowboy was formulating new and unspellable blasphemies. The
Easterner was startled to find that they were out in a wind that
seemed to come direct from the shadowed arctic floes. He heard
again the wail of the snow as it was flung to its grave in the
south. He knew now that all this time the cold had been sinking
into him deeper and deeper, and he wondered that he had not
perished. He felt indifferent to the condition of the vanquished
man.</p>

<p>"Johnnie, can you walk?" asked Scully.</p>

<p>"Did I hurt&mdash;hurt him any?" asked the son.</p>

<p>"Can you walk, boy? Can you walk?"</p>

<p>Johnnie's voice was suddenly strong. There was a robust
impatience in it. "I asked you whether I hurt him any!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Johnnie," answered the cowboy consolingly; "he's hurt
a good deal."</p>

<p>They raised him from the ground, and as soon as he was on his
feet he went tottering off, rebuffing all attempts at assistance.
When the party rounded the corner they were fairly blinded by the
pelting of the snow. It burned their faces like fire. The cowboy
carried Johnnie through the drift to the door. As they entered some
cards again rose from the floor and beat against the wall.</p>

<p>The Easterner rushed to the stove. He was so profoundly chilled
that he almost dared to embrace the glowing iron. The Swede was not
in the room. Johnnie sank into a chair, and folding his arms on his
knees, buried his face in them. Scully, warming one foot and then
the other at the rim of the stove, muttered to himself with Celtic
mournfulness. The cowboy had removed his fur-cap, and with a dazed
and rueful air he was now running one hand through his tousled
locks. From overhead they could hear the creaking of boards, as the
Swede tramped here and there in his room.</p>

<p>The sad quiet was broken by the sudden flinging open of a door
that led toward the kitchen. It was instantly followed by an inrush
of women. They precipitated themselves upon Johnnie amid a chorus
of lamentation. Before they carried their prey off to the kitchen,
there to be bathed and harangued with a mixture of sympathy and
abuse which is a feat of their sex, the mother straightened herself
and fixed old Scully with an eye of stern reproach. "Shame be upon
you, Patrick Scully!" she cried, "Your own son, too. Shame be upon
you!"</p>

<p>"There, now! Be quiet, now!" said the old man weakly.</p>

<p>"Shame be upon you, Patrick Scully!" The girls rallying to this
slogan, sniffed disdainfully in the direction of those trembling
accomplices, the cowboy and the Easterner. Presently they bore
Johnnie away, and left the three men to dismal reflection.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>"I'd like to fight this here Dutchman myself," said the cowboy,
breaking a long silence.</p>

<p>Scully wagged his head sadly. "No, that wouldn't do. It wouldn't
be right. It wouldn't be right."</p>

<p>"Well, why wouldn't it?" argued the cowboy. "I don't see no harm
in it."</p>

<p>"No," answered Scully with mournful heroism. "It wouldn't be
right. It was Johnnie's fight, and now we mustn't whip the man just
because he whipped Johnnie."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true enough," said the cowboy; "but&mdash;he better not
get fresh with me, because I couldn't stand no more of it."</p>

<p>"You'll not say a word to him," commanded Scully, and even then
they heard the tread of the Swede on the stairs. His entrance was
made theatric. He swept the door back with a bang and swaggered to
the middle of the room. No one looked at him. "Well," he cried,
insolently, at Scully, "I s'pose you'll tell me now how much I owe
you?"</p>

<p>The old man remained stolid. "You don't owe me nothin'."</p>

<p>"Huh!" said the Swede, "huh! Don't owe 'im nothin'."</p>

<p>The cowboy addressed the Swede. "Stranger, I don't see how you
come to be so gay around here."</p>

<p>Old Scully was instantly alert. "Stop!" he shouted, holding his
hand forth, fingers upward. "Bill, you shut up!"</p>

<p>The cowboy spat carelessly into the sawdust box. "I didn't say a
word, did I?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Mr. Scully," called the Swede, "how much do I owe you?" It was
seen that he was attired for departure, and that he had his valise
in his hand.</p>

<p>"You don't owe me nothin'," repeated Scully in his same
imperturbable way.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said the Swede. "I guess you're right. I guess if it was
any way at all, you'd owe me somethin'. That's what I guess." He
turned to the cowboy, "'Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!'" he
mimicked, and then guffawed victoriously. "'Kill him!'" He was
convulsed with ironical humor.</p>

<p>But he might have been jeering the dead. The three men were
immovable and silent, staring with glassy eyes at the stove.</p>

<p>The Swede opened the door and passed into the storm, giving one
derisive glance backward at the still group.</p>

<p>As soon as the door was closed, Scully and the cowboy leaped to
their feet and began to curse. They trampled to and fro, waving
their arms and smashing into the air with their fists. "Oh, but
that was a hard minute! Him there leerin' and scoffin'! One bang at
his nose was worth forty dollars to me that minute! How did you
stand it, Bill?"</p>

<p>"How did I stand it?" cried the cowboy in a quivering voice.
"How did I stand it? Oh!"</p>

<p>The old man burst into sudden brogue. "I'd loike to take that
Swade," he wailed, "and hould 'im down on a shtone flure and bate
'im to a jelly wid a shtick!"</p>

<p>The cowboy groaned in sympathy. "I'd like to git him by the neck
and ha-ammer him"&mdash;he brought his hand down on a chair with a noise
like a pistol-shot&mdash;"hammer that there Dutchman until he couldn't
tell himself from a dead coyote!"</p>

<p>"I'd bate 'im until he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd show him some things&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then together they raised a yearning fanatic cry. "Oh-o-oh!
if we only could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"And then I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O-o-oh!"</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The Swede, tightly gripping his valise, tacked across the face
of the storm as if he carried sails. He was following a line of
little naked gasping trees, which he knew must mark the way of the
road. His face, fresh from the pounding of Johnnie's fists, felt
more pleasure than pain in the wind and the driving snow. A number
of square shapes loomed upon him finally, and he knew them as the
houses of the main body of the town. He found a street and made
travel along it, leaning heavily upon the wind whenever, at a
corner, a terrific blast caught him.</p>

<p>He might have been in a deserted village. We picture the world
as thick with conquering and elate humanity, but here, with the
bugles of the tempest pealing, it was hard to imagine a peopled
earth. One viewed the existence of man then as a marvel, and
conceded a glamour of wonder to these lice which were caused to
cling to a whirling, fire-smote, ice-locked, disease-stricken,
space-lost bulb. The conceit of man was explained by this storm to
be the very engine of life. One was a coxcomb not to die in it.
However, the Swede found a saloon.</p>

<p>In front of it an indomitable red light was burning, and the
snowflakes were made blood-color as they flew through the
circumscribed territory of the lamp's shining. The Swede pushed
open the door of the saloon and entered. A sanded expanse was
before him, and at the end of it four men sat about a table
drinking. Down one side of the room extended a radiant bar, and its
guardian was leaning upon his elbows listening to the talk of the
men at the table. The Swede dropped his valise upon the floor, and,
smiling fraternally upon the barkeeper, said: "Gimme some whisky,
will you?" The man placed a bottle, a whisky-glass, and glass of
ice-thick water upon the bar. The Swede poured himself an abnormal
portion of whisky and drank it in three gulps. "Pretty bad night,"
remarked the bartender indifferently. He was making the pretension
of blindness, which is usually a distinction of his class; but it
could have been seen that he was furtively studying the half-erased
blood-stains on the face of the Swede. "Bad night," he said
again.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's good enough for me," replied the Swede, hardily, as he
poured himself some more whisky. The barkeeper took his coin and
maneuvered it through its reception by the highly-nickeled
cash-machine. A bell rang; a card labeled "20 cts." had
appeared.</p>

<p>"No," continued the Swede, "this isn't too bad weather. It's
good enough for me."</p>

<p>"So?" murmured the barkeeper languidly.</p>

<p>The copious drams made the Swede's eyes swim, and he breathed a
trifle heavier. "Yes, I like this weather. I like it. It suits me."
It was apparently his design to impart a deep significance to these
words.</p>

<p>"So?" murmured the bartender again. He turned to gaze dreamily
at the scroll-like birds and bird-like scrolls which had been drawn
with soap upon the mirrors back of the bar.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I'll take another drink," said the Swede
presently. "Have something?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks; I'm not drinkin'," answered the bartender.
Afterward he asked: "How did you hurt your face?"</p>

<p>The Swede immediately began to boast loudly. "Why, in a fight. I
thumped the soul out of a man down here at Scully's hotel."</p>

<p>The interest of the four men at the table was at last
aroused.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" said one.</p>

<p>"Johnnie Scully," blustered the Swede. "Son of the man what runs
it. He will be pretty near dead for some weeks, I can tell you. I
made a nice thing of him, I did. He couldn't get up. They carried
him in the house. Have a drink?"</p>

<p>Instantly the men in some subtle way incased themselves in
reserve. "No, thanks," said one. The group was of curious
formation. Two were prominent local business men; one was the
district-attorney; and one was a professional gambler of the kind
known as "square." But a scrutiny of the group would not have
enabled an observer to pick the gambler from the men of more
reputable pursuits. He was, in fact, a man so delicate in manner,
when among people of fair class, and so judicious in his choice of
victims, that in the strictly masculine part of the town's life he
had come to be explicitly trusted and admired. People called him a
thoroughbred. The fear and contempt with which his craft was
regarded was undoubtedly the reason that his quiet dignity shone
conspicuous above the quiet dignity of men who might be merely
hatters, billiard-markers or grocery clerks. Beyond an occasional
unwary traveler, who came by rail, this gambler was supposed to
prey solely upon reckless and senile farmers, who, when flush with
good crops, drove into town in all the pride and confidence of an
absolutely invulnerable stupidity. Hearing at times in circuitous
fashion of the despoilment of such a farmer, the important men of
Romper invariably laughed in contempt of the victim, and if they
thought of the wolf at all, it was with a kind of pride at the
knowledge that he would never dare think of attacking their wisdom
and courage. Besides, it was popular that this gambler had a real
wife, and two real children in a neat cottage in a suburb, where he
led an exemplary home life, and when any one even suggested a
discrepancy in his character, the crowd immediately vociferated
descriptions of this virtuous family circle. Then men who led
exemplary home lives, and men who did not lead exemplary home
lives, all subsided in a bunch, remarking that there was nothing
more to be said.</p>

<p>However, when a restriction was placed upon him&mdash;as, for
instance, when a strong clique of members of the new Pollywog Club
refused to permit him, even as a spectator, to appear in the rooms
of the organization&mdash;the candor and gentleness with which he
accepted the judgment disarmed many of his foes and made his
friends more desperately partisan. He invariably distinguished
between himself and a respectable Romper man so quickly and frankly
that his manner actually appeared to be a continual broadcast
compliment.</p>

<p>And one must not forget to declare the fundamental fact of his
entire position in Romper. It is irrefutable that in all affairs
outside of his business, in all matters that occur eternally and
commonly between man and man, this thieving card-player was so
generous, so just, so moral, that, in a contest, he could have put
to flight the consciences of nine-tenths of the citizens of
Romper.</p>

<p>And so it happened that he was seated in this saloon with the
two prominent local merchants and the district-attorney.</p>

<p>The Swede continued to drink raw whisky, meanwhile babbling at
the barkeeper and trying to induce him to indulge in potations.
"Come on. Have a drink. Come on. What&mdash;no? Well, have a little one
then. By gawd, I've whipped a man to-night, and I want to
celebrate. I whipped him good, too. Gentlemen," the Swede cried to
the men at the table, "have a drink?"</p>

<p>"Ssh!" said the barkeeper.</p>

<p>The group at the table, although furtively attentive, had been
pretending to be deep in talk, but now a man lifted his eyes toward
the Swede and said shortly: "Thanks. We don't want any more."</p>

<p>At this reply the Swede ruffled out his chest like a rooster.
"Well," he exploded, "it seems I can't get anybody to drink with me
in this town. Seems so, don't it? Well!"</p>

<p>"Ssh!" said the barkeeper.</p>

<p>"Say," snarled the Swede, "don't you try to shut me up. I won't
have it. I'm a gentleman, and I want people to drink with me. And I
want 'em to drink with me now. Now&mdash;do you understand?" He rapped
the bar with his knuckles.</p>

<p>Years of experience had calloused the bartender. He merely grew
sulky. "I hear you," he answered.</p>

<p>"Well," cried the Swede, "listen hard then. See those men over
there? Well, they're going to drink with me, and don't you forget
it. Now you watch."</p>

<p>"Hi!" yelled the barkeeper, "this won't do!"</p>

<p>"Why won't it?" demanded the Swede. He stalked over to the
table, and by chance laid his hand upon the shoulder of the
gambler. "How about this?" he asked, wrathfully. "I asked you to
drink with me."</p>

<p>The gambler simply twisted his head and spoke over his shoulder.
"My friend, I don't know you."</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" answered the Swede, "come and have a drink."</p>

<p>"Now, my boy," advised the gambler kindly, "take your hand off
my shoulder and go 'way and mind your own business." He was a
little slim man, and it seemed strange to hear him use this tone of
heroic patronage to the burly Swede. The other men at the table
said nothing.</p>

<p>"What? You won't drink with me, you little dude! I'll make you
then! I'll make you!" The Swede had grasped the gambler frenziedly
at the throat, and was dragging him from his chair. The other men
sprang up. The barkeeper dashed around the corner of his bar. There
was a great tumult, and then was seen a long blade in the hand of
the gambler. It shot forward, and a human body, this citadel of
virtue, wisdom, power, was pierced as easily as if it had been a
melon. The Swede fell with a cry of supreme astonishment.</p>

<p>The prominent merchants and the district-attorney must have at
once tumbled out of the place backward. The bartender found himself
hanging limply to the arm of a chair and gazing into the eyes of a
murderer.</p>

<p>"Henry," said the latter, as he wiped his knife on one of the
towels that hung beneath the bar-rail, "you tell 'em where to find
me. I'll be home, waiting for 'em." Then he vanished. A moment
afterward the barkeeper was in the street dinning through the storm
for help, and, moreover, companionship.</p>

<p>The corpse of the Swede, alone in the saloon, had its eyes fixed
upon a dreadful legend that dwelt a-top of the cash-machine. "This
registers the amount of your purchase."</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Months later, the cowboy was frying pork over the stove of a
little ranch near the Dakota line, when there was a quick thud of
hoofs outside, and, presently, the Easterner entered with the
letters and the papers.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Easterner at once, "the chap that killed the
Swede has got three years. Wasn't much, was it?"</p>

<p>"He has? Three years?" The cowboy poised his pan of pork, while
he ruminated upon the news. "Three years. That ain't much."</p>

<p>"No. It was a light sentence," replied the Easterner as he
unbuckled his spurs. "Seems there was a good deal of sympathy for
him in Romper."</p>

<p>"If the bartender had been any good," observed the cowboy
thoughtfully, "he would have gone in and cracked that there
Dutchman on the head with a bottle in the beginnin' of it and
stopped all this here murderin'."</p>

<p>"Yes, a thousand things might have happened," said the Easterner
tartly.</p>

<p>The cowboy returned his pan of pork to the fire, but his
philosophy continued. "It's funny, ain't it? If he hadn't said
Johnnie was cheatin' he'd be alive this minute. He was an awful
fool. Game played for fun, too. Not for money. I believe he was
crazy."</p>

<p>"I feel sorry for that gambler," said the Easterner.</p>

<p>"Oh, so do I," said the cowboy. "He don't deserve none of it for
killin' who he did."</p>

<p>"The Swede might not have been killed if everything had been
square."</p>

<p>"Might not have been killed?" exclaimed the cowboy. "Everythin'
square? Why, when he said that Johnnie was cheatin' and acted like
such a jackass? And then in the saloon he fairly walked up to git
hurt?" With these arguments the cowboy browbeat the Easterner and
reduced him to rage.</p>

<p>"You're a fool!" cried the Easterner viciously. "You're a bigger
jackass than the Swede by a million majority. Now let me tell you
one thing. Let me tell you something. Listen! Johnnie was
cheating!"</p>

<p>"'Johnnie,'" said the cowboy blankly. There was a minute of
silence, and then he said robustly: "Why, no. The game was only for
fun."</p>

<p>"Fun or not," said the Easterner, "Johnnie was cheating. I saw
him. I know it. I saw him. And I refused to stand up and be a man.
I let the Swede fight it out alone. And you&mdash;you were simply
puffing around the place and wanting to fight. And then old Scully
himself! We are all in it! This poor gambler isn't even a noun. He
is kind of an adverb. Every sin is the result of a collaboration.
We, five of us, have collaborated in the murder of this Swede.
Usually there are from a dozen to forty women really involved in
every murder, but in this case it seems to be only five men&mdash;you,
I, Johnnie, old Scully, and that fool of an unfortunate gambler
came merely as a culmination, the apex of a human movement, and
gets all the punishment."</p>

<p>The cowboy, injured and rebellious, cried out blindly into this
fog of mysterious theory. "Well, I didn't do anythin', did I?"</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>His New Mittens</h2>

<p>Little Horace was walking home from school, brilliantly
decorated by a pair of new red mittens. A number of boys were
snowballing gleefully in a field. They hailed him. "Come on,
Horace! We're having a battle."</p>

<p>Horace was sad. "No," he said, "I can't. I've got to go home."
At noon his mother had admonished him: "Now, Horace, you come
straight home as soon as school is out. Do you hear? And don't you
get them nice new mittens all wet, either. Do you hear?" Also his
aunt had said: "I declare, Emily, it's a shame the way you allow
that child to ruin his things." She had meant mittens. To his
mother, Horace had dutifully replied, "Yes'm." But he now loitered
in the vicinity of the group of uproarious boys, who were yelling
like hawks as the white balls flew.</p>

<p>Some of them immediately analyzed this extraordinary hesitancy.
"Hah!" they paused to scoff, "afraid of your new mittens, ain't
you?" Some smaller boys, who were not yet so wise in discerning
motives, applauded this attack with unreasonable vehemence.
"A-fray-ed of his mit-tens! A-fray-ed of his mit-tens." They sang
these lines to cruel and monotonous music which is as old perhaps
as American childhood, and which it is the privilege of the
emancipated adult to completely forget. "Afray-ed of his
mit-tens!"</p>

<p>Horace cast a tortured glance towards his playmates, and then
dropped his eyes to the snow at his feet. Presently he turned to
the trunk of one of the great maple-trees that lined the curb. He
made a pretence of closely examining the rough and virile bark. To
his mind, this familiar street of Whilomville seemed to grow dark
in the thick shadow of shame. The trees and the houses were now
palled in purple.</p>

<p>"A-fray-ed of his mit-tens!" The terrible music had in it a
meaning from the moonlit war-drums of chanting cannibals.</p>

<p>At last Horace, with supreme effort, raised his head. "'Tain't
them I care about," he said, gruffly. "I've got to go home. That's
all."</p>

<p>Whereupon each boy held his left forefinger as if it were a
pencil and began to sharpen it derisively with his right
forefinger. They came closer, and sang like a trained chorus,
"A-fray-ed of his mittens!"</p>

<p>When he raised his voice to deny the charge it was simply lost
in the screams of the mob. He was alone, fronting all the
traditions of boyhood held before him by inexorable
representatives. To such a low state had he fallen that one lad, a
mere baby, outflanked him and then struck him in the cheek with a
heavy snowball. The act was acclaimed with loud jeers. Horace
turned to dart at his assailant, but there was an immediate
demonstration on the other flank, and he found himself obliged to
keep his face towards the hilarious crew of tormentors. The baby
retreated in safety to the rear of the crowd, where he was received
with fulsome compliments upon his daring. Horace retreated slowly
up the walk. He continually tried to make them heed him, but the
only sound was the chant, "A-fray-ed of his mit-tens!" In this
desperate withdrawal the beset and haggard boy suffered more than
is the common lot of man.</p>

<p>Being a boy himself, he did not understand boys at all. He had,
of course, the dismal conviction that they were going to dog him to
his grave. But near the corner of the field they suddenly seemed to
forget all about it. Indeed, they possessed only the malevolence of
so many flitter-headed sparrows. The interest had swung
capriciously to some other matter. In a moment they were off in the
field again, carousing amid the snow. Some authoritative boy had
probably said, "Aw, come on!"</p>

<p>As the pursuit ceased, Horace ceased his retreat. He spent some
time in what was evidently an attempt to adjust his self respect,
and then began to wander furtively down towards the group. He, too,
had undergone an important change. Perhaps his sharp agony was only
as durable as the malevolence of the others. In this boyish life
obedience to some unformulated creed of manners was enforced with
capricious but merciless rigor. However, they were, after all, his
comrades, his friends.</p>

<p>They did not heed his return. They were engaged in an
altercation. It had evidently been planned that this battle was
between Indians and soldiers. The smaller and weaker boys had been
induced to appear as Indians in the initial skirmish, but they were
now very sick of it, and were reluctantly but steadfastly,
affirming their desire for a change of caste. The larger boys had
all won great distinction, devastating Indians materially, and they
wished the war to go on as planned. They explained vociferously
that it was proper for the soldiers always to thrash the Indians.
The little boys did not pretend to deny the truth of this argument;
they confined themselves to the simple statement that, in that
case, they wished to be soldiers. Each little boy willingly
appealed to the others to remain Indians, but as for himself he
reiterated his desire to enlist as a soldier. The larger boys were
in despair over this dearth of enthusiasm in the small Indians.
They alternately wheedled and bullied, but they could not persuade
the little boys, who were really suffering dreadful humiliation
rather than submit to another onslaught of soldiers. They were
called all the baby names that had the power of stinging deep into
their pride, but they remained firm.</p>

<p>Then a formidable lad, a leader of reputation, one who could
whip many boys that wore long trousers, suddenly blew out his
checks and shouted, "Well, all right then. I'll be an Indian
myself. Now." The little boys greeted with cheers this addition to
their wearied ranks, and seemed then content. But matters were not
mended in the least, because all of the personal following of the
formidable lad, with the addition of every outsider, spontaneously
forsook the flag and declared themselves Indians. There were now no
soldiers. The Indians had carried everything unanimously. The
formidable lad used his influence, but his influence could not
shake the loyalty of his friends, who refused to fight under any
colors but his colors.</p>

<p>Plainly there was nothing for it but to coerce the little ones.
The formidable lad again became a soldier, and then graciously
permitted to join him all the real fighting strength of the crowd,
leaving behind a most forlorn band of little Indians. Then the
soldiers attacked the Indians, exhorting them to opposition at the
same time.</p>

<p>The Indians at first adopted a policy of hurried surrender, but
this had no success, as none of the surrenders were accepted. They
then turned to flee, bawling out protests. The ferocious soldiers
pursued them amid shouts. The battle widened, developing all manner
of marvellous detail.</p>

<p>Horace had turned towards home several times, but, as a matter
of fact, this scene held him in a spell. It was fascinating beyond
anything which the grown man understands. He had always in the back
of his head a sense of guilt, even a sense of impending punishment
for disobedience, but they could not weigh with the delirium of
this snow-battle.</p>

<p>One of the raiding soldiers, espying Horace, called out in
passing, "A-fray-ed of his mit-tens!" Horace flinched at this
renewal, and the other lad paused to taunt him again. Horace
scooped some snow, moulded it into a ball, and flung it at the
other. "Ho!" cried the boy, "you're an Indian, are you? Hey,
fellers, here's an Indian that ain't been killed yet." He and
Horace engaged in a duel in which both were in such haste to mould
snowballs that they had little time for aiming.</p>

<p>Horace once struck his opponent squarely in the chest. "Hey," he
shouted, "you're dead. You can't fight any more, Pete. I killed
you. You're dead."</p>

<p>The other boy flushed red, but he continued frantically to make
ammunition. "You never touched me!" he retorted, glowering. "You
never touched me! Where, now?" he added, defiantly. "Where did you
hit me?"</p>

<p>"On the coat! Right on your breast! You can't fight any more!
You're dead!"</p>

<p>"You never!"</p>

<p>"I did, too! Hey, fellers, ain't he dead? I hit 'im square!"</p>

<p>"He never!"</p>

<p>Nobody had seen the affair, but some of the boys took sides in
absolute accordance with their friendship for one of the concerned
parties. Horace's opponent went about contending, "He never touched
me! He never came near me! He never came near me!"</p>

<p>The formidable leader now came forward and accosted Horace.
"What was you? An Indian? Well, then, you're dead&mdash;that's all.
He hit you. I saw him."</p>

<p>"Me?" shrieked Horace. "He never came within a mile of
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment he heard his name called in a certain familiar
tune of two notes, with the last note shrill and prolonged. He
looked towards the sidewalk, and saw his mother standing there in
her widow's weeds, with two brown paper parcels under her arm. A
silence had fallen upon all the boys. Horace moved slowly towards
his mother. She did not seem to note his approach; she was gazing
austerely off through the naked branches of the maples where two
crimson sunset bars lay on the deep blue sky.</p>

<p>At a distance of ten paces Horace made a desperate venture. "Oh,
ma," he whined, "can't I stay out for a while?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered solemnly, "you come with me." Horace knew
that profile; it was the inexorable profile. But he continued to
plead, because it was not beyond his mind that a great show of
suffering now might diminish his suffering later.</p>

<p>He did not dare to look back at his playmates. It was already a
public scandal that he could not stay out as late as other boys,
and he could imagine his standing now that he had been again
dragged off by his mother in sight of the whole world. He was a
profoundly miserable human being.</p>

<p>Aunt Martha opened the door for them. Light streamed about her
straight skirt. "Oh," she said, "so you found him on the road, eh?
Well, I declare! It was about time!"</p>

<p>Horace slunk into the kitchen. The stove, straddling out on its
four iron legs, was gently humming. Aunt Martha had evidently just
lighted the lamp, for she went to it and began to twist the wick
experimentally.</p>

<p>"Now," said the mother, "let's see them mittens."</p>

<p>Horace's chin sank. The aspiration of the criminal, the
passionate desire for an asylum from retribution, from justice, was
aflame in his heart. "I&mdash;I&mdash;don't&mdash;don't know where
they are." he gasped finally, as he passed his hand over his
pockets.</p>

<p>"Horace," intoned his mother, "you are tellin' me a story!"</p>

<p>"'Tain't a story," he answered, just above his breath. He looked
like a sheep-stealer.</p>

<p>His mother held him by the arm, and began to search his pockets.
Almost at once she was able to bring forth a pair of very wet
mittens. "Well, I declare!" cried Aunt Martha. The two women went
close to the lamp, and minutely examined the mittens, turning them
over and over. Afterwards, when Horace looked up, his mother's
sad-lined, homely face was turned towards him. He burst into
tears.</p>

<p>His mother drew a chair near the stove. "Just you sit there now,
until I tell you to git off." He sidled meekly into the chair. His
mother and his aunt went briskly about the business of preparing
supper. They did not display a knowledge of his existence; they
carried an effect of oblivion so far that they even did not speak
to each other. Presently they went into the dining and living room;
Horace could hear the dishes rattling. His Aunt Martha brought a
plate of food, placed it on a chair near him, and went away without
a word.</p>

<p>Horace instantly decided that he would not touch a morsel of the
food. He had often used this ruse in dealing with his mother. He
did not know why it brought her to terms, but certainly it
sometimes did.</p>

<p>The mother looked up when the aunt returned to the other room.
"Is he eatin' his supper?" she asked.</p>

<p>The maiden aunt, fortified in ignorance, gazed with pity and
contempt upon this interest. "Well, now, Emily, how do I know?" she
queried. "Was I goin' to stand over 'im? Of all the worryin' you do
about that child! It's a shame the way you're bringin' up that
child."</p>

<p>"Well, he ought to eat somethin'. It won't do fer him to go
without eatin'," the mother retorted, weakly.</p>

<p>Aunt Martha, profoundly scorning the policy of concession which
these words meant, uttered a long, contemptuous sigh.</p>

<p>Alone in the kitchen, Horace stared with sombre eyes at the
plate of food. For a long time he betrayed no sign of yielding. His
mood was adamantine. He was resolved not to sell his vengeance for
bread, cold ham, and a pickle, and yet it must be known that the
sight of them affected him powerfully. The pickle in particular was
notable for its seductive charm. He surveyed it darkly.</p>

<p>But at last, unable to longer endure his state, his attitude in
the presence of the pickle, he put out an inquisitive finger and
touched it, and it was cool and green and plump. Then a full
conception of the cruel woe of his situation swept upon him
suddenly, and his eyes filled with tears, which began to move down
his cheeks. He sniffled. His heart was black with hatred. He
painted in his mind scenes of deadly retribution. His mother would
be taught that he was not one to endure persecution meekly, without
raising an arm in his defence. And so his dreams were of a
slaughter of feelings, and near the end of them his mother was
pictured as coming, bowed with pain, to his feet. Weeping, she
implored his charity. Would he forgive her? No; his once tender
heart had been turned to stone by her injustice. He could not
forgive her. She must pay the inexorable penalty.</p>

<p>The first item in this horrible plan was the refusal of the
food. This he knew by experience would work havoc in his mother's
heart. And so he grimly waited.</p>

<p>But suddenly it occurred to him that the first part of his
revenge was in danger of failing. The thought struck him that his
mother might not capitulate in the usual way. According to his
recollection, the time was more than due when she should come in,
worried, sadly affectionate, and ask him if he was ill. It had then
been his custom to hint in a resigned voice that he was the victim
of secret disease, but that he preferred to suffer in silence and
alone. If she was obdurate in her anxiety, he always asked her in a
gloomy, low voice to go away and leave him to suffer in silence and
alone in the darkness without food. He had known this maneuvering
to result even in pie.</p>

<p>But what was the meaning of the long pause and the stillness?
Had his old and valued ruse betrayed him? As the truth sank into
his mind, he supremely loathed life, the world, his mother. Her
heart was beating back the besiegers; he was a defeated child.</p>

<p>He wept for a time before deciding upon the final stroke. He
would run away. In a remote corner of the world he would become
some sort of bloody-handed person driven to a life of crime by the
barbarity of his mother. She should never know his fate. He would
torture her for years with doubts and doubts, and drive her
implacably to a repentant grave. Nor would Aunt Martha escape. Some
day, a century hence, when his mother was dead, he would write to
his Aunt Martha, and point out her part in the blighting of his
life. For one blow against him now he would, in time, deal back a
thousand&mdash;aye, ten thousand.</p>

<p>He arose and took his coat and cap. As he moved stealthily
towards the door he cast a glance backward at the pickle. He was
tempted to take it, but he knew that if he left the plate inviolate
his mother would feel even worse.</p>

<p>A blue snow was falling. People, bowed forward, were moving
briskly along the walks. The electric lamps hummed amid showers of
flakes. As Horace emerged from the kitchen, a shrill squall drove
the flakes around the corner of the house. He cowered away from it,
and its violence illumined his mind vaguely in new directions. He
deliberated upon a choice of remote corners of the globe. He found
that he had no plans which were definite enough in a geographical
way, but without much loss of time he decided upon California. He
moved briskly as far as his mother's front gate on the road to
California. He was off at last. His success was a trifle dreadful;
his throat choked.</p>

<p>But at the gate he paused. He did not know if his journey to
California would be shorter if he went down Niagara Avenue or off
through Hogan Street. As the storm was very cold and the point was
very important, he decided to withdraw for reflection to the
wood-shed. He entered the dark shanty, and took seat upon the old
chopping-block upon which he was supposed to perform for a few
minutes every afternoon when he returned from school. The wind
screamed and shouted at the loose boards, and there was a rift of
snow on the floor to leeward of a crack.</p>

<p>Here the idea of starting for California on such a night
departed from his mind, leaving him ruminating miserably upon his
martyrdom. He saw nothing for it but to sleep all night in the
wood-shed and start for California in the morning bright and early.
Thinking of his bed, he kicked over the floor and found that the
innumerable chips were all frozen tightly, bedded in ice.</p>

<p>Later he viewed with joy some signs of excitement in the house.
The flare of a lamp moved rapidly from window to window. Then the
kitchen door slammed loudly and a shawled figure sped towards the
gate. At last he was making them feel his power. The shivering
child's face was lit with saturnine glee as in the darkness of the
wood-shed he gloated over the evidences of consternation in his
home. The shawled figure had been his Aunt Martha dashing with the
alarm to the neighbors.</p>

<p>The cold of the wood-shed was tormenting him. He endured only
because of the terror he was causing. But then it occurred to him
that, if they instituted a search for him, they would probably
examine the wood-shed. He knew that it would not be manful to be
caught so soon. He was not positive now that he was going to remain
away forever, but at any rate he was bound to inflict some more
damage before allowing himself to be captured. If he merely
succeeded in making his mother angry, she would thrash him on
sight. He must prolong the time in order to be safe. If he held out
properly, he was sure of a welcome of love, even though he should
drip with crimes.</p>

<p>Evidently the storm had increased, for when he went out it swung
him violently with its rough and merciless strength. Panting,
stung, half blinded with the driving flakes, he was now a waif,
exiled, friendless, and poor. With a bursting heart, he thought of
his home and his mother. To his forlorn vision they were as far
away as heaven.</p>

<p>Horace was undergoing changes of feeling so rapidly that he was
merely moved hither and then thither like a kite. He was now aghast
at the merciless ferocity of his mother. It was she who had thrust
him into this wild storm, and she was perfectly indifferent to his
fate, perfectly indifferent. The forlorn wanderer could no longer
weep. The strong sobs caught at his throat, making his breath come
in short, quick snuffles. All in him was conquered save the
enigmatical childish ideal of form, manner. This principle still
held out, and it was the only thing between him and submission.
When he surrendered, he must surrender in a way that deferred to
the undefined code. He longed simply to go to the kitchen and
stumble in, but his unfathomable sense of fitness forbade him.</p>

<p>Presently he found himself at the head of Niagara Avenue,
staring through the snow into the blazing windows of Stickney's
butcher-shop. Stickney was the family butcher, not so much because
of a superiority to other Whilomville butchers as because he lived
next door and had been an intimate friend of the father of Horace.
Rows of glowing pigs hung head downward back of the tables, which
bore huge pieces of red beef. Clumps of attenuated turkeys were
suspended here and there. Stickney, hale and smiling, was bantering
with a woman in a cloak, who, with a monster basket on her arm, was
dickering for eight cents' worth of some thing. Horace watched them
through a crusted pane. When the woman came out and passed him, he
went towards the door. He touched the latch with his finger, but
withdrew again suddenly to the sidewalk. Inside Stickney was
whistling cheerily and assorting his knives.</p>

<p>Finally Horace went desperately forward, opened the door, and
entered the shop. His head hung low. Stickney stopped whistling.
"Hello, young man," he cried, "what brings you here?"</p>

<p>Horace halted, but said nothing. He swung one foot to and fro
over the saw-dust floor.</p>

<p>Stickney had placed his two fat hands palms downward and wide
apart on the table, in the attitude of a butcher facing a customer,
but now he straightened.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, "what's wrong? What's wrong, kid?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," answered Horace, huskily. He labored for a moment
with something in his throat, and afterwards added,
"O'ny&mdash;&mdash;I've&mdash;&mdash;I've run away, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Run away!" shouted Stickney. "Run away from what? Who?"</p>

<p>"From&mdash;&mdash;home," answered Horace. "I don't like it
there any more. I&mdash;&mdash;" He had arranged an oration to win
the sympathy of the butcher; he had prepared a table setting forth
the merits of his case in the most logical fashion, but it was as
if the wind had been knocked out of his mind. "I've run away.
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stickney reached an enormous hand over the array of beef, and
firmly grappled the emigrant. Then he swung himself to Horace's
side. His face was stretched with laughter, and he playfully shook
his prisoner. "Come&mdash;&mdash;come&mdash;&mdash;come. What
dashed nonsense is this? Run away, hey? Run away?" Whereupon the
child's long-tried spirit found vent in howls.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Stickney, busily. "Never mind now, never
mind. You just come along with me. It'll be all right. I'll fix it.
Never you mind."</p>

<p>Five minutes later the butcher, with a great ulster over his
apron, was leading the boy homeward.</p>

<p>At the very threshold, Horace raised his last flag of pride.
"No&mdash;&mdash;no," he sobbed. "I don't want to. I don't want to
go in there." He braced his foot against the step and made a very
respectable resistance.</p>

<p>"Now, Horace," cried the butcher. He thrust open the door with a
bang. "Hello there!" Across the dark kitchen the door to the
living-room opened and Aunt Martha appeared. "You've found him!"
she screamed.</p>

<p>"We've come to make a call," roared the butcher. At the entrance
to the living-room a silence fell upon them all. Upon a couch
Horace saw his mother lying limp, pale as death, her eyes gleaming
with pain. There was an electric pause before she swung a waxen
hand towards Horace. "My child," she murmured, tremulously.
Whereupon the sinister person addressed, with a prolonged wail of
grief and joy, ran to her with speed. "Mam-ma! Mam-ma! Oh, mam-ma!"
She was not able to speak in a known tongue as she folded him in
her weak arms.</p>

<p>Aunt Martha turned defiantly upon the butcher because her face
betrayed her. She was crying. She made a gesture half military,
half feminine. "Won't you have a glass of our root-beer, Mr.
Stickney? We make it ourselves."</p>
