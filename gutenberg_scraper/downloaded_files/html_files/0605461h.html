<h1>Nine Ghosts</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>R. H. Malden</h2>

<h4>First published 1943</h4>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The stories in this volume were written at irregular intervals
between the years 1909 and 1942. <i>A Collector's Company</i> is the
earliest; <i>The Priest's Brass</i> the latest.</p>

<p>Anyone familiar with <i>Ghost Stories of an Antiquary</i> will have
no difficulty in recognizing their <i>provenance</i>. It was my good
fortune to know Dr. James for more than thirty years. Among my many
debts to him is an introduction to the work of Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu,
whom he always regarded as The Master.</p>

<p>Sufficient time has now elapsed since Dr. James's death to make some
attempt to continue the tradition admissible or even welcome to his
friends and readers. It is as such that these stories have been
collected and revised now. They are in some sort a tribute to his
memory, if not comparable with his work.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be just worth while to mention that none of them
stands in any relation to anything which ever happened to me, or to
anyone else of whom I have heard. The documents and inscriptions quoted
do not (with one exception) exist, as far as I know.</p>

<p>Three of the stories--<i>The Sundial</i>, <i>Between Sunset</i> and
<i>Moonrise and The Blank Leaves</i>--have been printed in a magazine
which used to appear at Christmas-time under the aegis of the Leeds
Parish Church. I have to thank Canon W. M. Askwith, Vicar of Leeds, for
permission to reproduce them.</p>

<h2><a name="c1"></a>A COLLECTOR'S COMPANY</h2>

<p>The story which follows was told to me rather more than thirty years
ago. The narrator was elderly then. He died very soon after the end of
the last war with Germany, so there can be no harm in repeating it now.
His name, if you want to know, was Arthur Harberton. As he was a young
man when it happened to him I suppose it must be dated not long after
the year 1870. I made notes of it at the time, and reproduce it now as
nearly as I can in his own words.</p>

<p>'Three years after my ordination I was offered a post as a college
lecturer at Cambridge. That was the kind of work which I had always
thought that I should like, at any rate for a few years, so I accepted
the offer very gladly. I have never regretted that I did so; nor that I
did not devote the rest of my life to academic work.</p>

<p>'I was not dean of the college, and as in those days the number of
Fellows in Holy Order was much larger than it is now it was very seldom
necessary for me to be in the Chapel on a Sunday. Accordingly I used to
go about the diocese a good deal, visiting the country churches. I
don't think that I was under any illusion as to my powers as a
preacher, even then. But I thought, without, I hope, undue vanity, that
it might be good for village congregations to hear a fresh voice
occasionally, and even for the incumbent if he were present. That was
not always the case, for I was always willing to take the whole duty of
the day if I were asked, so that the incumbent might secure a short
holiday.</p>

<p>'As a rule I enjoyed these expeditions thoroughly. They began with a
short train journey, followed by a drive from the station, sometimes of
as much as ten miles. Country lanes were country lanes then. They had
not been blackened with tar macadam and motor-cars were, of course,
unknown. An occasional traction engine, preceded by a man on foot
carrying a red flag, was the only disagreeable object likely to be
encountered. From a dog-cart, which was usually the vehicle which came
to meet me, it was possible to see over the hedges and to get a very
fair idea of the country as you went along at eight to ten miles an
hour.</p>

<p>'My hosts were generally interesting. For the most part they were
country-bred men who belonged naturally to their surroundings. Many of
them had a wide variety of interests (and sometimes a store of real
knowledge) on which they were ready to discourse to a stranger. When I
had the house to myself it was amusing to try to deduce what manner of
man the owner might be from his books and pictures.</p>

<p>'Most of the churches and a good many of the houses presented
features of architectural interest, which appealed to me strongly.
Besides, I used to enjoy such conversations as I might have with rural
churchwardens, sextons and other parish officials. I remember one
churchwarden (a farmer, I think) who had heard that Huntingdon was a
fine town. Personally he had never penetrated farther than St. Neots.
When I told him that I lived at Cambridge I might as well have said
Pekin, or Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>'In another place the village school-master was opposed to
elementary education in the abstract: not merely to the particular form
of it which he was required to administer. He thought it unsettled
children and took them off the land. There was, no doubt, something to
be said on behalf of his views; but I couldn't help wondering whether
he were <i>quite</i> the right man in the right place. Well--no doubt
the countryside is more sophisticated now, and I won't bore you with
speculations as to whether the gains outweigh the losses or not.</p>

<p>'So, as you see, I had good reason to look forward to these
excursions. In fact, I only once got to a place which I should not care
to visit again, and that is the one which I am going to tell you about
now. All the same, I don't entirely regret that I did go there. Anyhow,
it was a unique experience.</p>

<p>'Towards the end of one October term I got a letter from the
bishop's chaplain, asking me if I could preach twice on the following
Sunday at a village about twenty-five miles from Cambridge--I don't
think I will tell you in what direction. The incumbent, it appeared,
was not very well, and having no curate was doubtful of his ability to
get through the day single-handed. As it would be the second Sunday in
Advent it would not be difficult for me to preach at short notice. The
collect and epistle for the day provided me with a subject ready-made:
a subject, moreover, which I have always found particularly
congenial.</p>

<p>'I discovered that there was a convenient train to the nearest
station on the Saturday afternoon and from it on the Monday morning, so
I telegraphed Yes, and wrote to my prospective host to say when I might
be expected.</p>

<p>'It was a little after three when I got out at a wayside station. I
was met by a groom with a dog-cart who brought a note from his master
apologizing for not having come in person. As I had understood that he
wasn't well I hadn't expected him. I will call him Melrose.</p>

<p>'As we drove away from the station I said to the groom, "I hope Mr.
Melrose has nothing serious the matter with him?"</p>

<p>'"No," he replied, "but he <i>du</i> come over all queer-like at
times--so he du. When he have one of his turns--well, it's not for me
to be explaining of it, if you take my meaning, Sir."</p>

<p>'I was not at all sure that I did, but thought it would be ill-bred
on my part to ask for details. Also I was inclined to suspect that they
might be copious rather than enlightening. However, as my companion
seemed inclined to talk I did not feel bound to try to suppress
him.</p>

<p>'I gathered that Mr. Melrose was wealthy and a bachelor. He had
"travelled furren," which was regarded locally as a hazardous
proceeding, on the ground that all foreigners are well known to be
black, and that they blackamoors might be up to anything. He was much
took up with reading: also in my companion's opinion a dubious
proceeding. For if there was good in some books there was bad in
others, and how'd you know which till arterwards, and then it was
done.</p>

<p>'The general impression left on my mind was that while Mr. Melrose
might be loved by his parishioners he was certainly feared. I thought
that I might look forward to an unusually interesting week-end. As it
turned out this expectation was not unduly sanguine, as I think you
will agree when you have heard the rest of my story.</p>

<p>'After a drive of about seven miles we arrived. The light was
failing, but I could see that the house was an old one. It was rather
larger than the average, and I judged that there was probably a
considerable garden behind it. I looked forward to examining both more
closely between services on Sunday.</p>

<p>'Mr. Melrose made me very welcome. He was a tall man who stooped a
little. I set him down as about seventy; probably over rather than
under. He had abundant white hair and very prominent white eyebrows.
His eyes were dark and his nose aquiline. The general effect was
scholarly and striking. He would have been noticeable in any company,
and once seen would always be remembered. My first impression was that
he was very handsome.'</p>

<p>Here Mr. Harberton paused for a minute or two and then said rather
abruptly, 'Did you ever see Thompson (W. H. Thompson, 1866-86.), the
Master of Trinity?'</p>

<p>'No,' I said. 'He was some years before my time. But I know the
portrait; by Richmond, I think.'</p>

<p>'No, of course you didn't,' he went on. 'Stupid of me. But one
forgets how time passes. I don't think the portrait really does him
justice. However, if you know it you'll understand what I am going to
say.</p>

<p>'I knew him very well by sight and he was one of the most
distinguished-looking men I have ever seen. He was handsome if you
like, and you couldn't doubt his ability or force of character. You had
only to look at him to see that he was a great man. Yet somehow I never
could think his face a pleasing one. It always seemed to me to contain
great possibilities of evil. I could believe him to be capable of
absolutely diabolical conduct.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I said, 'I believe that when Richmond painted Lightfoot he
declared that he had never had a sitter whose jaw was so obviously and
unmistakably that of a murderer. And I have been told by people who
knew the Bishop well that they could believe that he had a naturally
violent temper, and that his complete mastery of it was part of his
greatness. The same may have been true of Thompson.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Mr. Harberton, 'it may. Anyhow, this was the effect
which Mr. Melrose produced on me. However, I tried to dismiss it from
my mind as foolishness.</p>

<p>'After tea, which we had in a square hall by a log fire, Mr. Melrose
asked me to excuse him until dinner-time as he had some letters to
write and the post went out at six-thirty. He had a small study on the
first floor opening out of his bedroom to which he proposed to betake
himself. The library, which was on the ground floor and opened out of
the hall, was at my disposal and there were writing materials there if
I wanted them.</p>

<p>'The library was a large room, completely lined with bookcases. A
cursory inspection of these showed that my host was a man of wide and
miscellaneous reading. He seemed to be particularly interested in the
later Neoplatonists and to be well supplied with Orphic literature. On
a glass-topped table by the window was a collection of Gnostic gems. An
Egyptian mummy-case stood upright in a corner. On a table by the fire
was a book which he had presumably been reading when I arrived. I
picked it up and found that it was Philostratus' <i>Life</i> of
Apollonius of Tyana. It had been interleaved and was copiously
annotated. I should have liked to read some of the notes, but thought
that would be impertinent.</p>

<p>'Evidently I was in the house of a scholar whose interests were out
of the common run, and the possessor of means which enabled him to
indulge them freely.'</p>

<p>'At dinner he proved very good company. He had travelled widely and
had visited places which were then very much off the beaten track, such
as Sicily and Transylvania. He had spent some considerable time in the
latter country and had made a careful study of its grim folklore.</p>

<p>'The dinner was good, and my host exerted himself to be pleasant.
Interesting he undoubtedly was, but I was not at all sure how much I
liked him. I had a vague feeling that in some way he was playing a
part. But I could find no rational ground for my suspicion. And, after
all, why should he think it worth while to try to impress anyone so
much younger than himself?</p>

<p>'It struck me as curious that a man of his calibre should be content
to bury himself in so obscure a place. Of course the country was much
more prosperous then than it is now and rural life offered more
interests than I fear it does to-day. But this particular neighbourhood
was not specially attractive in any way. Most of the land had belonged
to the see of Ely and was now administered by the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners. I believe that they are always considered to be good
landlords, but naturally there are seldom any country-houses other than
farms on their estates. I could hardly see my host at ease in the
society of farmers, nor could I imagine that they would be able to make
much of him. (I had discovered that he did not shoot or hunt, and in
those days a man who did neither was very much out of it in the
country.)</p>

<p>'When he told me that he had been rector of the parish for more than
thirty years I could not help expressing surprise--rather clumsily, I
fear, and perhaps not too politely, but I was very young then--and
saying something about the solitariness of the life which he led.</p>

<p>'"Yes," he said; "I don't wonder that it strikes you like that. The
road from the station is rather desolate. But I have plenty of
occupation and interests here; and do you know I find some of my
neighbours more companionable than you would expect."</p>

<p>'The last sentence struck me as rather odd, not only in itself but
in the way he said it. I felt that there was more behind the remark
than I was meant to understand, and did not like the feeling. I liked
the laugh which followed it even less. However, there was obviously no
more to be said about that. Perhaps he thought I had been rather
impertinent, and perhaps he was right.</p>

<p>'After dinner we went into the library for coffee, and somehow our
talk drifted to witchcraft, necromancy and kindred topics. I had always
taken an interest in such matters, if not a very serious one, and have
often wondered what foundation, if any, there is or was for the belief
that the powers to which witches lay claim have any real existence.</p>

<p>'At this distance of time I do not mind admitting that as an
undergraduate I had once made an essay in Invultuadon. The object was
the Vice-Chancellor of the day, whom I did not know by sight. He had
annoyed me by refusing to allow a play which I had written to be acted
publicly by the A.D.C., on the ground that it was disrespectful to
authority. I adopted the only method of retaliation which seemed to be
open. I made a waxen image and placed it on my mantelpiece. After some
incantations which I thought appropriate (<i>Flectere si nequeo superos
Acheronta movebo</i> [Aeneid, vii. 12.] is the only line which I
remember now) I inserted a pin into one leg. The very next day I heard
that the Vice-Chancellor had slipped going downstairs in his lodge and
had sprained one of his ankles. I felt that my cause had been
vindicated and took no further steps. But, as you will understand, I
had not been serious in the matter. I never pretended to think that the
accident had been more than a coincidence for which I need not reproach
myself. The story leaked out somehow, and one comment on it which came
to my ears was "Whole religions have been founded upon less evidence."
I will not name the author, but I still think he ought to have known
better.</p>

<p>'Mr. Melrose's discourse seemed to me to be a very different story.
I could not help thinking that he knew more than he ought about a great
deal which was very undesirable. And he spoke with an air of inside
knowledge which I found disquieting. His tone was that of a lecturer on
a subject which he had really made his own, and he gave the impression
of having verified at least some of his knowledge by experiment. I felt
that there was something malign about him, as well as creepy.</p>

<p>'Finally, I came to the conclusion that he was like an evil
caricature of Dr. Hans Emmanuel Bryerley, the Swedenborgian teacher in
<i>Uncle Silas</i>. (By Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu.) Altogether I was
extremely glad when he suggested a move bedwards, and was at pains to
lock the door of my room. Perhaps that would not avail much if it came
to the point. But the illusion of security which it produced was
comforting.</p>

<p>'I do not know how long I had been asleep when I awoke with the
impression which one sometimes has of having been disturbed by a loud
and sudden noise. Probably the church clock, I thought, though I had
not noticed its strike earlier in the evening. I was just disposing
myself for a renewed period of slumber when it struck me that although
my fire had burned low the room was curiously light; not with firelight
either. I had drawn back the window curtains before going to bed, as I
usually did, and the light was coming from the window.</p>

<p>'"Moonlight," you will say. 'But I knew that it was not. In the
first place, the moon was several days short of full, and in the
second, the light was not coming from a particular point. It was evenly
diffused, like daylight on a cloudy day; and no moon could have
produced so much light from behind clouds. It seemed to me to have a
bluish tinge which was unnatural and unpleasant. I went to the window
and looked out. It commanded a view of a good-sized lawn flanked by
dark shrubberies of some sort--rhododendrons, I found out
subsequently.</p>

<p>'This lawn sloped slightly upwards away from the house, and at the
farther end was a low wall with a gateway in it leading to the
churchyard. This and the church itself were as plainly visible as if it
had been midday instead of just after midnight in December. But
everything to right and left was in darkness. I felt as if I were
looking down an illuminated tunnel, and it seemed obvious that
something would appear at the upper end. I took my courage in both
hands and waited. I did not have to wait long. Through the gate in the
churchyard wall came my host. He seemed to be wearing a cassock with a
long black cloak over it. On his head was a high-pointed cap, something
like a mitre, and he carried a short rod in his right hand. He came
straight down the lawn towards the house. I wondered whether I was as
visible to him as he was to me; and hoped not. Anyhow I felt bound to
see the performance through. He was followed by a number of figures: I
think about twelve, but I could not be sure.</p>

<p>'Although there seemed to be plenty of light they were somehow
curiously indistinct. They may have dodged behind each other from time
to time in some odd fashion. Anyhow I found that it was no use to try
to count them. They were dressed in long black cloaks with hoods, which
prevented their faces from being seen. On the whole I felt glad of
that. They moved rather stiffly, like marionettes. Of course their feet
made no sound upon the grass. But I was conscious of a faint creaking,
the source of which was not easy to determine. It might have been
produced by the breeze in the shrubbery; but I did not think that it
was.</p>

<p>'The procession advanced until it had reached the middle of the
lawn. Then the leader stopped and the others formed a circle round him.
Still I could not be sure how many they were. Every time I tried to
count them I became confused and arrived at a different result.</p>

<p>'Then they began to dance while he beat time or conducted, however
you like to put it, with his wand. They moved more quickly than I
should have expected, though they still suggested marionettes. The
faint creaking which I had heard before was more audible. There could
be no doubt now that it came from the dancing figures.</p>

<p>'Do you remember a story told by one of the minor characters in
Stevenson's <i>Catriona</i>? About Tod Lapraik, the warlock weaver of
Leith. He used to fall into a dwam in his house and once while he was
in that state he, or something in his likeness, was seen dancing alone
on the Bass Rock "in the black glory of his heart." Those words rose in
my mind now. The performance which I was watching seemed to be inspired
by an unholy--well, <i>joie de vivre</i> I suppose I must call it,
though I don't know how far the dancers could be considered to be
alive. The whole effect was abominably, indescribably evil. Yet,
curiously enough, I did not feel afraid. I have never considered myself
a particularly courageous person, and have not had many opportunities
of discovering whether I am or not. But anyhow I was not conscious of
any fear then. Partly perhaps I was too deeply interested in what I was
watching to think of anything else. Also, youth and a good digestion
will carry their possessor securely through many of the changes and
chances of this mortal life.</p>

<p>'The dance grew faster, and the ring of dancers contracted. As it
did so the mysterious light contracted too. I could no longer see the
church, or the greater part of the lawn. Only the tall stationary
figure with his black-shrouded companions whirling--it had come to that
now--whirling round him. The group was illuminated as a particular
figure sometimes is upon the stage (spotlight, I think they call it),
but as before the light did not seem to be coming from any particular
direction. Perhaps this was why I could see no shadow upon the
grass.</p>

<p>'In another minute the dancers seemed to have closed in and then (as
was perhaps to be expected) the light went out. I could neither see nor
hear anything. The garden seemed to be as dark and deserted as you
might expect between midnight and 1 a.m. on a moonless night in
December. As I turned away from the window I heard the discordant cry
of a night-jar (at least that was what I thought it sounded like) very
loud and apparently very close to my window. Immediately afterwards I
heard a low chuckle. It was not a pleasant one. I felt pretty sure that
whatever the joke might be I should prefer not to meet the author of
it. I made certain that my door was locked, made up my fire to last
until daylight, got into bed and rather to my surprise fell asleep
almost immediately.</p>

<p>'It was getting light when I woke. I got out of bed and unlocked my
door. As I waited to be called I naturally thought of my experience of
a few hours earlier. The more I considered it the less confident did I
become that I had not dreamed the whole thing. I have always been an
active and vivid dreamer, but have never had a vision of my head upon
my bed worth taking seriously; even by the most nasty-minded
psycho-analyst who ever came out of Vienna or anywhere else.</p>

<p>'At eight o'clock the butler brought me tea and hot water. On the
tray was a note from Mr. Melrose saying that he regretted that he was
unable to leave his room. The clerk would show me where everything was
in the church. Would I make myself at home in the house and ask for
anything I wanted, etc. etc.'</p>

<p>'"Is your master seriously ill?" I asked the man. "Ought a doctor to
be sent for, or can you look after him?"</p>

<p>'"No, Sir, not serious. But he don't come down as a rule, after one
of his nights, not for a day or two."</p>

<p>'For a moment I thought he was going to say more, but he turned away
and began laying out my clothes. So I said something to the effect that
old people often slept badly and that no doubt a wakeful night was very
exhausting.</p>

<p>'To this he merely replied, "Yes, Sir," and left the room.</p>

<p>'While I was drinking my tea I thought I would look at the lessons
for the day, as I should probably have to read them myself. There was a
Bible beside my bed and I opened it at <i>Isaiah</i> (the first lesson
was Chapter 5, as you probably remember), and it so happened that the
first words which caught my eye were from Chapter 8, verse 19</p>

<p><i>Seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto the wizards
that peep and that mutter.</i></p>

<p>'No doubt a coincidence. But as I dressed I became more and more
inclined to think that I had not been dreaming.</p>

<p>'The day passed uneventfully. Evensong was at three, as was not
unusual in the country then during the winter months; I must confess
that I was glad of this as I did not relish the prospect of coming down
the lawn from the church in the dark. Of course it was getting dark by
the time service was over, and as I went through the gate leading from
the churchyard I had an uncomfortable feeling that my movements were
being watched by some person or persons whom I could not see--and not
with any amiable solicitude for my welfare.</p>

<p>'However, nothing untoward happened then or during the evening. I
went to bed early and slept soundly all night. Next morning the butler
brought another note from my host, expressing his regret that he would
be unable to see me before I left, the disappointment which he felt at
having had so little of my society, and a hope that I had been made
comfortable.</p>

<p>'I replied to the first two heads of this communication as politely
as was consistent with the truth. As regards the third I could reassure
him honestly. I left the house soon after breakfast. The butler had not
seemed disposed to be communicative, nor was the groom who drove me to
the station. Three days later I went down for the Christmas
vacation.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Harberton was silent for a minute or two, so I asked--I must
admit with a feeling of disappointment--'Is that all?'</p>

<p>'Not quite,' he replied. 'But for the conclusion of the story you
had better read this.'</p>

<p>He handed me a cutting from a newspaper, probably a local weekly,
which he took from a large old-fashioned pocket-book. I had seen the
book before, as it was his practice to carry it with him. The cutting
was from the bottom of a column, so no date was visible. I judged it to
be about thirty years old. It ran as follows:</p>

<p>'RECTOR'S STRANGE DEATH</p>

<p>'A painful sensation was produced at [the name of the place was
carefully erased] on Christmas morning.</p>

<p>'As soon as it was light the sexton (Mr. Jonas Day) had gone to the
church to make up the fire in the stove. As he approached the south
door he was horrified to observe the body of the rector lying face
downwards on a flight of four steps leading from the churchyard to the
rectory garden. He went at once to the house and summoned the butler
(Mr. Thomas Blogg) and the groom (Mr. Henry Meekin). They carried the
rev. gentleman to his room, but it was all too evident that the vital
spark had ceased to pulsate. Dr. Horridge was sent for and arrived a
little before ten o'clock. He reported that the neck of the deceased
was broken and that death must have intervened some hours before.</p>

<p>'It may be presumed that the unfortunate gentleman had gone to the
church at a late hour to satisfy himself that everything was in order
for the morrow. The steps were slippery with frost and he did not
appear to have taken a lantern.</p>

<p>'The Rev. [name erased] had held the rectory for thirty-two years
and the sad occurrence cast a deep aroma of gloom over the festivities
naturally incidental to the day.</p>

<p>'The inquest was held at the Fox and Grapes on the 30th ult., Dr.
Horridge presiding as Coroner. Mr. Blogg deposed that his master not
infrequently went to the church late at night. When asked by one of the
Jury if he knew for what purpose, he replied that he had never demeaned
himself to curiosity in his master's business. He was warmly commended
by the Coroner for his reply.</p>

<p>'Mr. Day deposed that when he approached the body he saw some
curious marks on the back of the coat. When pressed to describe them he
said "Like muddy claws." Neither Mr. Blogg nor Mr. Meekin had noticed
these. The coat was sent for, but it had been brushed. The Coroner
thought that they might easily have been made by an owl or some other
bird of the night perching upon the body after life was extinct, and by
his direction the Jury returned a verdict of <i>Death by
Misadventure</i>.</p>

<p>'The funereal obsequies were celebrated on the and instant.'</p>

<p>'May I take a copy of this?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, if you like,' said Mr. Harberton. And I did.</p>

<h2><a name="c2"></a>THE DINING-ROOM FIREPLACE</h2>

<p>Anyone who knows the neighbourhood of Dublin will remember the
good-sized country-houses in which it abounds. Most of them date from
the eighteenth century, when Irish landowners were prosperous and
labour was cheap. Some of them incorporate bits of older buildings
which may have begun life as castles of the Pale. Most of them are now
in a state of dilapidation which is not unpicturesque, though it would
be out of place in England.</p>

<p>Perhaps I ought to have used the past tense. I do not know how many
of them have survived the establishment of Eire--or whatever that part
of Ireland chooses to call itself nowadays--and I do not feel tempted
to go and see.</p>

<p>I am writing of things as they were during the closing years of the
reign of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>It was during a visit to one of them in the autumn of the year 1899
that the experience, I can hardly dignify it by the name of adventure,
which I am about to relate befell me.</p>

<p>It belonged to a family named Moore who had inhabited it for several
generations. The present owner was a young man, unmarried and in the
army. Naturally he could not spend much of his time there and was glad
to let it when he could. It had been taken for one summer by some
cousins of mine who lived in Dublin, and it was on their invitation
that I was there.</p>

<p>I need not try your patience by attempting to describe it in detail.
There was nothing very noteworthy about it except an almost ruinous
tower at the north-west angle. This was obviously much older than the
rest of the house, and we young people thought it ought to contain a
ghost. We could not, however, hear of any story to that effect. We
explored it pretty thoroughly, but found nothing more exciting than a
very large quantity of dust and a few bats. We went there once late on
a moonlight evening, but even then could not pretend that we saw or
heard anything unusual.</p>

<p>The south side of the house consisted of three large rooms: a
drawing-room at the western end, then a dining-room opening out of it
and lastly a billiard-room which was also used as a gun-room. Probably,
in fact, it had been built as a gun-room and the billiard-table had
been added afterwards. It had a door leading into the garden, but there
was no access to it from the house except from the dining-room.</p>

<p>The dining-room was hung with portraits of bygone Moores, who had no
doubt played their several parts adequately in their generation. But
none of them had reached fame and the pictures were of no outstanding
artistic merit. The collection as a whole looked well enough, but was
not likely to be of much interest, except to members of the family.</p>

<p>One picture there was, however, which did arouse our curiosity. It
represented a man of about thirty. There was no name or date upon the
frame, but the dress was that of the closing years of the eighteenth
century. The most remarkable thing about it was the attitude which the
sitter had chosen to adopt. He was astride of a chair with his arms
folded and resting on the top rail. His back was towards the spectator,
so that his features would have been invisible if he had not been
looking over his left shoulder. His face, so far as it could be seen,
did not resemble a Moore. The upper part suggested considerable
intellectual power; the lower part was not pleasant. The whole effect
was formidable and bespoke a man who would be a very dangerous
enemy.</p>

<p>The execution was not particularly good; in fact the technique
suggested an amateur. But it was impossible not to feel that the artist
had caught the likeness of his original well; and difficult not to
regret that he had done so. We wondered why such a curious picture,
which did not look like a family portrait, should be displayed so
conspicuously. It looked as if there must be a story of some sort about
it.</p>

<p>A few days later Captain Moore called. He was stationed at the
Curragh, and having some business to transact in Dublin very civilly
looked in to ask after his tenants' comfort. We ventured to put a
question about the curious portrait.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'it's a fantastic thing, isn't it? Clever in a way
though, and I should think a good likeness. But I don't know who it is
any more than you do. It isn't one of the family--you'd guess that, I
hope, by looking at it. All I know about it is that my
great-grandfather--the old boy over there (here he pointed to a
portrait of the same period which hung exactly opposite on the other
side of the room)--stuck it up about the time of the Union. I rather
think he painted it himself. Anyhow he was so keen about it that he
left directions in his will that it was never to be moved. So there
it's been ever since. I expect there is a story, if I knew what it was.
I believe my great-grandfather had been pretty wild in his young days.
A lot of his generation were dazzled by the French Revolution, y'know.
I dare say it looked better at a distance than at close quarters. But
while he was still pretty young--about the turn of the century, I
think--he turned over a new leaf, Model Country Gentleman, Magistrate,
Churchwarden, all that sort of thing, y'know, and I believe a really
good man into the bargain. Very charitable and so on. Not very
hospitable though, by all accounts. In fact during the last years of
his life when he was a widower he would hardly see anybody, and I
believe was nicknamed The Hermit. I remember once when I was a little
chap, about six, I think, I was playing in the dining-room on a winter
afternoon. I think the nursery chimney was being swept; anyhow I had
been sent downstairs for some reason. It was getting dark--and
something gave me a terrible fright. The funny thing was that I
couldn't say what it was and I don't know now. But I think it was
something to do with that picture. I ran screaming into the
drawing-room where my mother was and though I couldn't tell her what
was the matter, I am sure that she thought it was that. When I had been
comforted my father came in (he had been out shooting, I think) and she
began to talk to him very earnestly. I wasn't meant to hear and don't
suppose I should have understood much if I had, but I do recollect that
she said something to the effect that it couldn't go on and that it
wasn't as if this were the first time. And he said that he couldn't
do--whatever it was she wanted him to do. I suppose now she was asking
him to have the picture moved, or perhaps to get rid of it outright and
he was reminding her of the clause in his grandfather's will. Of course
ninety-nine women out of a hundred would see no reason why the wishes
of someone who had been dead for more than fifty years should be
allowed to interfere with their own. Anyhow, that was the nearest
approach to a quarrel which my father and mother ever had, that I can
remember. And the picture stopped in its place, as you see.</p>

<p>'I once asked him about it. He looked very grave and was silent for
a minute or two, as if he were making up his mind about something. Then
he said, "I'll tell you what I know about it some day, but not just
now. You must wait until you are older," and I had to be content with
that.</p>

<p>'Both he and my mother died soon afterwards, and I went to live with
an uncle on her side (my father had been an only son), and the house
was shut up for several years. So I never heard the story, whatever it
may be. I expect old Barton at the lodge knows something about it. He's
been on the place all his life, and his father and grandfather before
him. But I'm pretty sure he wouldn't tell anybody if he did know.'</p>

<p>After Captain Moore had gone I went and examined the picture more
closely than I had ever done before. I came to the conclusion that it
was a cleverer thing, and a more repulsive subject, than I had thought
at first. One thing perplexed me very much. I tried to put myself into
the position of the sitter and found that I could not twist my head
round as far as his. His chin was almost on his left shoulder. Why had
he chosen to be painted in such an unnatural and indeed, as it seemed,
impossible attitude? And how had he contrived to sit for it?</p>

<p>I don't think the expression Rubber-neck (which I believe to be
American for Sightseer) had been coined then. Or if it had it hadn't
crossed the Atlantic. But I can think of no one to whom it would be
more appropriate.</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards I happened to see Barton in his garden and
thought I would try whether there was anything to be got out of him.
Like all his kind his conversational powers were remarkable and he was
never unwilling to exercise them. Eventually, I got him on to the
pictures in the house, and I thought that he seemed to feel that he was
being drawn towards thin ice. How would the like of him know anything
about them, or photygrafts either? Sure, I must ask the young master
about them, and wasn't he in the house only last week?</p>

<p>I recognized that Captain Moore's estimate of him as a source of
information on this point had been accurate. A few nights afterwards
when we were all in the drawing-room after dinner I had occasion to go
to the billiard-room to fetch a book which I had left there. Dinner had
been cleared away, so I took a candle to light me through the deserted
dining-room. Just as I was passing the fireplace I was conscious of so
strong a draught that my candle guttered and was nearly blown out. I
supposed it was a down-draught, due to the large size of the chimney
and to the fact that there was no fire in the grate, and rather
wondered that we had never noticed it before. It was not a windy night,
so that if there were a strong draught now one would suppose that it
was a permanent feature of the room, and that whoever sat on that side
of the table would want a screen behind his chair. But hitherto no one
had made any complaint.</p>

<p>On my way back I was surprised to find the draught equally strong in
the opposite direction. It was now sucking inwards towards the
fireplace. I held my candle high, shielding it with the other hand, and
looked round to see if there were an open window. But the windows were
all securely shuttered, and the doors at each end of the room were
shut. I could not account for any draught, much less for one which
apparently changed its direction, almost as if it were due to the slow
breathing of some gigantic creature crouching in the fireplace. While I
stood there the inward draught suddenly ceased. After a moment's
stillness there came an outward puff--really strong enough to be called
a gust--which blew my candle out. This was too much. I groped my way to
the end of the room as quickly as I could without stopping to light a
match. Once out of the room I felt rather ashamed of myself for having
been so easily scared. I suppose that was why I did not feel inclined
to say anything about what had happened. Probably I said to myself
there was really more wind outside than I had imagined, and of course a
rambling old house was likely to be full of unaccountable draughts.
Most likely this one depended upon the wind being exactly in one
quarter, which was why we had not noticed it before, and more to the
same effect, But I did not find this cogent reasoning convincing.</p>

<p>When I went to bed I looked out and everything seemed to be
perfectly still. This, I was bound to admit, was as I had expected.
Three nights later I had a curious dream. I dreamed that I was in the
dining-room, and that the figure over the mantelpiece had come down
from his frame. He was seated astride of a chair as he was painted,
almost in the fireplace. His back was turned to the room, but instead
of having his head upon his shoulder, it was turned away so that
nothing could be seen of his features. He appeared to be speaking with
great earnestness to an invisible personage who must have been
stationed a few feet up the chimney. I could not catch what he was
saying, for he spoke very rapidly. But his tones were those of a person
in deep distress.</p>

<p>When he had finished speaking there came a rumbling, moaning noise
in the chimney, such as is made by the wind on stormy nights. This
presently began to shape itself into words. At first they were not at
all distinct, but gradually they became clearer, though they seemed to
be in a language unknown to me. I wondered whether it could be Irish.
The voice spoke very deliberately with a cold malignity of tone which
made me feel very thankful that I could not follow what it was saying.
There was something indescribably evil about it. It was the most
unpleasant sound to which I have ever listened, asleep or awake. If
fear can make the hair stand on end I must have resembled a
clothes-brush.</p>

<p>At this point I woke, and it was more in obedience to some automatic
instinct than to any reasoned courage that I decided to visit the
dining-room. I do not know what, if anything, I expected to see. As I
opened the door there was a grating sound, as if a chair were being
hastily dragged across the uncarpeted part of the floor. But I told
myself that that was caused by rats. The house abounded in them and
everyone knows that they can make extraordinary noises. I suspect that
they are at the bottom of a great many ghost stories.</p>

<p>I advanced to the fireplace, but beyond the fact that the hearthrug
was curiously bundled up into a heap--a circumstance which did not for
some reason strike me at the moment, though I wondered about it
afterwards--there was nothing in the least unusual to be seen. My
candle burned quite steadily as I held it high and looked round the
silent empty room. I stared up at the odd, forbidding picture above the
mantelpiece, but there did not seem to be anything to be got out of
him. Upon the whole I was glad of that, for he did not look like the
sort of person I should have chosen for a midnight
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>

<p>'Well,' I said aloud, addressing the portrait, 'I wish I knew rather
more about you. But as you aren't in a position to explain yourself, I
shall go back to bed.'</p>

<p>I did so; and slept soundly for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>Next morning I did not mention my dream to anyone else. Perhaps I
was a little ashamed of it. Also the walls of Irish houses have even
acuter ears than those elsewhere and I did not wish to be responsible
for an outbreak of hysteria among the servants.</p>

<p>It so happened that I had no occasion to be in the dining-room alone
after dark during the next day or two. Perhaps I was at pains not to
be. No one commented upon the curious draught which I had noticed.
Indeed I do not think it was perceptible in the daytime. My dreams,
when I had any, were, as usual, entirely commonplace.</p>

<p>One evening, when my visit was nearly at an end, one of my cousins
and I were sitting talking in the billiard-room after the rest of the
family had gone to bed. Our conversation turned on ghosts and
apparitions of various kinds; a subject in which we both took a keen if
sceptical interest. Dreams and their value (this was before the days of
psychoanalysis) and the possibility of their coming true were also
discussed and it was past midnight when we got up to go to bed. We then
found that there were no bedroom candles for us. Presumably they had
been left in the dining-room or in the hall beyond it. The oil lamp by
which we were sitting was too big and heavy to take with us. As it was
past the middle of September and the day had been wet we had had fires
in the sitting-rooms. The dining-room fire had been burning brightly
when we finished dinner, so that it was probable that there would still
be enough of it left to prevent our passage through the room from
offering any insurmountable obstacles. So we put the lamp out and
prepared to go.</p>

<p>As soon as we opened the door we saw that our surmise had been
correct. There was a sufficient glow in the fireplace to light us down
the room. But we had hardly taken a step before we were startled by a
rapid thudding sound, such as might be produced by a big dog beating
his tail upon the floor. There was a dog about the place, but at night
he had his own quarters in the stable-yard. Even if he had not been put
to bed then properly--as might very well be the case in a household of
Irish servants--he had certainly not been in the dining-room during
dinner and could hardly have got there since.</p>

<p>The thudding ceased as suddenly as it had begun. But next moment we
were even more startled by seeing the fire beginning to disappear. I
remembered a story which I had once read--by H. G. Wells, I think. In
it the lights in a haunted room go out one by one and as the occupant
rushes to the fire to rekindle them that too dies away into absolute
blackness.</p>

<p>But we soon saw that our fire was not going out like that. It was
being obscured by some large dark object which was rising from the
ground between ourselves and it. It was as if the hearthrug were slowly
humping itself into the form of an animal of some kind. It rose and
rose without a sound. Soon it was larger than any dog and its movement
had somehow an uncanny suggestion of deliberate and malign purpose. Its
bulk and outline, so far as we could make them out, suggested a bear
more than anything else. But the head was not shaped like that of a
bear. There was something more than half-human about the outline which
made it peculiarly horrible. There seemed to be a nose not in the least
like the snout of any animal. Presently no vestige of the fire was to
be seen. Then it suddenly reappeared. The creature, whatever it was,
had gone up the chimney.</p>

<p>We felt that the longer we waited there the less we should like it,
so as soon as the coast was clear we ran down the room as hard as we
could go, keeping as close as possible to the side away from the
fireplace.</p>

<p>There was plenty of firelight in the drawing-room and we soon laid
hands on our candles and made our way upstairs. Our bedrooms opened
into each other and we left the door standing wide. I do not think
either of us slept well, but there was nothing to disturb us except the
owls, who (we both thought) were noisier than usual.</p>

<p>Next day we told our story to the rest of the family and I added
what I had to say about the mysterious draught and my dream. Of course
there was only one thing to be done. The whole thing must be laid
before Captain Moore as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the doors of the dining-room must be kept locked and meals
served in another room, which a house-agent would probably have called
The Breakfast Parlour. I was obliged to return to England on the
following day, so it was some weeks before I heard the sequel.</p>

<p>In response to an urgent if guarded letter Captain Moore came over
from the Curragh as soon as he could get a few days' leave. He soon
knew all that there was to tell. His first step was to pay a visit to
the lodge, but unfortunately the day before his arrival Barton had had
a stroke from which he never recovered. He seemed to recognize his
master and to be glad to see him. But he was in no state to be
questioned. He died that night. Next day his daughter, who lived with
him, told us that after Captain Moore's visit her father seemed to have
something on his mind. Just after midnight he sat up and made an effort
to say something. The only words she could make out sounded like
'trouble' and 'back of the picture.' Immediately afterwards he fell
back on his pillow and expired.</p>

<p>This was something to go upon. The queer portrait must be meant. A
step-ladder was procured and Captain Moore and my cousins set to work.
It took them longer than they had expected, as the picture was not hung
in the usual way. A number of long screws had been driven through the
frame, which was very solid, into the panelling of the wall behind. At
last they were all got out; not without difficulty, though they did not
seem to be particularly rusty. The immediate result was disappointing.
There was nothing to be seen either on the back of the picture or the
surface of the wall.</p>

<p>Then somebody noticed what looked like a fine crack running across
the top of one panel just below the raised frame containing it. Closer
examination showed that the wood had been cut through on all four sides
with a very sharp knife. A little picking at the top and out it came,
disclosing a cavity, obviously the work of an amateur mason, in the
thickness of the wall. In it reposed a small book, about nine inches
long by five broad. At the top of the title-page were the two words</p>

<p>THE CLUB</p>

<p>and underneath was a list of twelve names; presumably those of the
members. Several of them belonged to families still represented in the
neighbourhood. The last was Robert Moore, Captain Moore's
great-grandfather.</p>

<p>By this time lunch was ready, so further research was postponed.</p>

<p>When the party returned reinvigorated to their task they discovered,
as was not unexpected, that what they had found was an informal
minute-book.</p>

<p>It was apparently the custom of the Club to dine once each month
with one of the members and discuss topics of general interest. The
first dinner was held on 14 July 1778. There were notes as to the
amount of wine consumed, which need not be recorded here. One would
imagine that the members of the Club must have acted on the principle
which was adopted subsequently by Mr. Jorrocks--'Where I dines I sleeps
and where I sleeps I breakfasts.'</p>

<p>There were also notes of the discussions. These were more
interesting. At first they were principally political. The recent
revolt of the American colonies appeared more than once, and though no
formal vote was ever taken, it was obvious that opinion was divided as
to the character of George Washington. Some members regarded him as a
high-minded patriot; others as a sordid tobacco-planter who did not
want to make any contribution to the cost of the campaigns to which he
and his like owed their security and prosperity.</p>

<p>The revolution in France also aroused much interest. General opinion
seemed to have been more favourable to it than most people--at any rate
in England--would have approved. But the members of the Club were
probably all young enough to feel it their duty as well as their
pleasure to ventilate opinions which would have shocked their elders
could they have heard them.</p>

<p>As time went on the tone of the meetings became less innocent. A
certain amount of profanity began to appear, and once or twice some
rather vague entries suggested some dabbling in black magic. At one
dinner, held in the year 1797, there was a note--'The President's
Health was drunk in bumpers with [probably acclamation,' but the fact
that the writer had changed his mind more than once as to the proper
spelling of the word, added to two considerable blots, had made it
indecipherable]. On the next page was a plan of the table with the name
of each member against his place. There were six on each side; no one
at top or bottom. The top was, however, marked with a X. From this time
onwards there were frequent references to The President, but curiously
his name was never given. The minutes were usually initialled J.B.
James Butler was the first name in the original list, so was presumably
that of the senior member. It was not, however, clear whether he was to
be identified with the President. Near the end of the book was an entry
in a different hand. It ran:</p>

<p>'The Club is dissolved. Lord have mercy upon us.'</p>

<p>It was signed Robt. Moore and dated 23 September, 1799. My odd
experiences had culminated on 23 September, 1899. There was nothing
else in the cavity in the wall except two small scraps of paper. They
had obviously been part of a larger sheet which had been torn up. What
had become of the rest it was impossible to say. On one appeared the
words <i>like a bear</i>, on the other <i>clean broak</i>. That was
all.</p>

<p>Despite his ancestor's wishes Captain Moore felt justified in
destroying the portrait. It was soon hacked to pieces and the bonfire
which it made in the garden consumed the minute-book of the Club as
well. The panel was replaced and another picture hung over it. As far
as I know there were no further disturbances. Perhaps a century is a
kind of statute of limitations in such matters. We do not understand
them sufficiently to be able to speak positively about them.</p>

<p>It seems pretty clear that at its last meeting the Club somehow got
more than it had bargained for. But it is impossible to reconstruct
exactly what had happened. Who was the President, and was the last
meeting the first at which he was actually present? Was the queer
portrait, which was presumably Robert Moore's work, intended to operate
as a warning, like the public executions which were then in vogue?</p>

<p>Some years afterwards I happened to find myself sitting next to an
Irish clergyman at a public dinner. He was incumbent of a parish near
Dublin, he told me. As the evening wore on, and the tide of
speech-making flowed strongly, our talk, in the intervals, turned on
superstitions.</p>

<p>'It's queer,' he said, 'the way they lay hold of people for no
reason that anyone can see. Now there is one grave in my churchyard
that the people won't go near. And when we turn in sheep to keep the
grass down the farmer always sends a boy to see that they don't graze
by it. It's a nuisance, because we always have to scythe that bit--and
the sexton doesn't like doing it either. It's an ugly, pompous thing to
a member of a family that used to be well known there, I believe,
though there's not been any of them about these fifty years. But why
there should be anything unlucky or wrong about it I don't know. I'm
not sure that the people do. Anyhow, if they do you won't get it out of
them.'</p>

<p>'I wonder,' I said, 'whether the occupant is named James Butler and
whether he died on 23 September, 1799?'</p>

<p>'Why, yes,' he said. 'But how in the world do you know anything
about it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I used to have relations with whom I sometimes stayed in that
neighbourhood.'</p>

<p>I thought that was as much as I need tell him.</p>

<h2><a name="c3"></a>STIVINGHOE BANK</h2>

<p>The coast-line of Norfolk is one of those which have altered
considerably in historic times. Along some stretches the sea has
encroached. At low water traces of lost villages can still be seen, and
in stormy weather pieces of wood from drowned forests are sometimes
washed ashore. At Cromer a lighthouse which I remember has disappeared
long since, though it was not very near the edge of the cliff when I
knew it. A new one has been built at some distance inland.</p>

<p>Along other stretches the sea has receded and towns which were once
thriving ports are separated from it by a wide expanse of marsh, where
cattle graze and abundant mushrooms can be found in early autumn. These
marshes are intersected by deep and muddy channels up which the tide
creeps sluggishly. But even at high water nothing larger than an open
boat can use them. The harbours whence the cloth was shipped in the
great days of East Anglia, when Norwich was the third city in the
kingdom and nearly wrested the second place from Bristol, are almost
useless now. The towns which lived by them have dwindled to small
villages. Here and there a fine old house may still be seen on the
water-front. But for the most part the large and magnificent churches
are all that remain of their former glories.</p>

<p>Melancholy as these villages are they have a beauty and dignity of
their own. The wide horizon of marsh, beach and sea beyond gives a
sense of spaciousness which can hardly be found elsewhere. Anyone who
knows them will understand why a Norfolk nurserymaid when taken to
Grasmere complained that she felt unable to breathe and that the
mountains spoilt the view.</p>

<p>They have always been well known to sportsmen as the marshes teem
with wild-fowl in winter.</p>

<p>Of late years artists have begun to discover them. But I must admit
that I hope they will never become popular resorts.</p>

<p>It was at one of them, which I will call Stivinghoe, that the
experience (it hardly deserves to be called an adventure) which is set
down here, befell me some years ago. If, when you have heard the story,
you think it rather pointless, that is not my fault. I do not think
that I should have admired Mr. Chadband (See Bleak House.) had I met
him. But his insistence on what he called <i>The Terewth</i> always
seemed to me worthy of imitation. And I could not make the story more
exciting without departing from the standard set by that eloquent
divine.</p>

<p>Stivinghoe differs from its neighbours in the possession of a bank;
that is to say a causeway some eight feet high running across the marsh
land and projecting beyond it into the sea. I suppose it is natural, as
it is not easy to see why anyone should have taken the trouble to
construct it. There is a rough track along the top. At the shoreward
end the sides are clothed with coarse grass where sea-pinks and yellow
horned poppies grow. The last half-mile is sand and shingle. At high
water the sea comes up to it on both sides. When the tide is out it is
flanked by a wide expanse of wet sand. At the far end there is a little
hillock on which are the remains of a ruined chapel. It is as lonely
and desolate a spot as can well be imagined. I suppose the chapel had
escaped demolition because it had never been worth anyone's while to
pull the walls down and cart the material away. It was a cell of the
great house of Walsingham and had been established as a place where
prayer might be offered continually for fishermen along the coast and
all who got their living from the sea.</p>

<p>After the dissolution of the monasteries a large part of the lands
of Walsingham had gone to the Earl of W., whose descendant is still one
of the magnates of Norfolk. I had reason to believe that some books
from the library had made their way to his great house at Folkham.
There was no adequate catalogue of them and as I had known Lord W.'s
son at Cambridge I ventured to write and ask whether I might come and
look at them. His reply was very cordial. He regretted that he could
not ask me to stay as the family was away and the house shut up. He had
written to the housekeeper telling her to let me see anything I wanted,
and added that while the only inn in the village was not to be
recommended I should be sufficiently comfortable at the <i>Fishmongers'
Arms</i> at Stivinghoe.</p>

<p>The map showed me that the distance from Stivinghoe to Folkham House
was only about three miles. A bicycle would solve the question of
transport. I had never slept at the <i>Fishmongers' Arms</i>, but had
had tea there more than once when exploring the neighbourhood, and my
recollection of it confirmed Lord W.'s opinion.</p>

<p>Accordingly I wrote engaging a bedroom (if possible with a table at
which I could write) for a week and established myself there one fine
afternoon in the middle of September.</p>

<p>The greater part of the next three days was spent in the library at
Folkham. The result was, however, rather disappointing. The manuscripts
were not many. Neither contents nor workmanship were of outstanding
interest. I thought I had got to the end of them when I came upon a
bundle of papers tied up with tape and docketed, in a modern hand,
<i>Stivinghoe Chapel</i>.</p>

<p>The housekeeper had just come into the room with some tea and I
noticed that she seemed to be disconcerted when she saw the bundle in
my hand.</p>

<p>'Are these private papers, do you suppose?' I said. 'They were on
the same shelf as the other manuscripts. Is there any, reason why I
shouldn't read them? I see that somebody had them out not very long
ago.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Sir,' she said. 'That were his lordship's father, that were.
The day before the great storm, not that that had anything to do with
it, I do suppose. No, I don't see there'd be no harm--if so be as
you're careful, Sir.'</p>

<p>Of course I told her that I would take great care of them, that I
was accustomed to handling old books and papers and so forth. But I
couldn't help thinking that that was not quite what she meant.</p>

<p>It was too late to do any more that day. So I said I would come back
and go through them to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>I mounted my bicycle at the front door expecting to enjoy the ride
home as it was a beautiful evening. But somehow I did not. For some
reason I felt uncomfortable and could not get rid of the idea that
there was someone following me. Though after all why shouldn't there be
on a public highroad? And what harm could he do me in broad daylight if
he were evilly disposed? All the same so strong was the feeling that I
looked behind me more than once. But I had the road to myself. All the
same I rode faster than usual and was glad when I found myself at the
<i>Fishmongers' Arms</i>.</p>

<p>After dinner I went into the bar-parlour as usual and got into
conversation with its frequenters. The talk was of the usual
description in such places. Interesting enough to anyone who, like
myself, can find pleasure in listening to reminiscences of past
harvests, speculations as to quality of the next one, the market prices
of beasts and local affairs generally. But not worth attempting to set
down here.</p>

<p>The company broke up early and I went early to bed. Contrary to my
usual custom I did not sleep very well. I was troubled by a recurrent
dream, the details of which eluded me, try as I would to recall them.
The general sense was that I was going somewhere where I expected to
meet, or at least feared that I might meet, somebody whom I did not
want to see, Just as I was on the point of coming face to face with him
I always woke up. This performance was repeated with monotonous
regularity four or five times between midnight (which I heard on the
church clock) and dawn. As soon as it was light I gave up trying to go
to sleep and read until it was time to get up.</p>

<p>After breakfast I bicycled to Folkham House as usual and got out the
bundle of papers.</p>

<p>They proved more interesting than I had expected. They belonged to
the years 1531-2 and appeared to relate to the incumbent of the chapel
at the end of the bank. John of Costessey was his name.</p>

<p>The first document was brief. It was addressed to the Prior and
Convent of Walsingham and was a request bearing about a dozen
signatures, of which three seemed to be those of the rectors of
Stivinghoe and two neighbouring villages, that John might be recalled
to Walsingham and someone else despatched to take his place.</p>

<p>Presumably the Prior wrote, as he was bound to do, to ask the reason
for this request, for the next letter was considerably longer. It
appeared that John was suspected of having entered into a compact with
the powers of evil. He was a man of violent and vindictive temper and
it was noticeable that those who offended him were dogged by persistent
and inexplicable misfortune. Next time they went to sea they met with
no fish; or nets broke mysteriously as a catch was being brought on
board. Unaccountable accidents, some fatal, occurred on board their
boats. More than once a boat had been lost with all hands in a sudden
and very violent storm, which had not been foreseen by the most
weather-wise seamen along the coast.</p>

<p>More than once he had been seen from boats rounding the end of the
bank close inshore to make the harbour, standing at the water's edge
with an imp seated on his shoulder. The said imp had screamed and waved
its arms [here followed an illegible word which I guessed to be meant
for <i>devilishly</i>].</p>

<p>More than once at night-time the window of the Chapel had been seen,
to be brightly lighted, and bursts of song were heard proceeding from
it. These melodies did not suggest the familiar offices of the Church
and more than one voice seemed to be taking part.</p>

<p>Next came a letter from John himself, obviously in answer to a
communication from the Prior. He protested that he could not be
expected to reply in detail to such malicious and unfounded charges
(<i>crimina tam perfida ac dolosa et omnino nugatoria</i>) and hinted
that if his nocturnal vigils had been solaced by celestial company no
fault could be found with him on that score (<i>quid in hoc improperii
vel quae increpationis causa</i>?).</p>

<p>The Prior's answer to this may be inferred to have been a summons to
repair to Walsingham forthwith. John's next letter was to the effect
that his austerities, which it was his delight to practise, had made
him too feeble to undertake the journey on foot, while the
hard-heartedness and irreligion of the countryside, of which the Prior
had had ample proof (<i>litteris supradictis satis probatum</i>), made
it unlikely that any attempt to borrow so much as an ass would be
successful.</p>

<p>The Prior could hardly be expected to put up with this, nor did he.
He must have told John that he proposed to visit him in person, for the
last letter was as follows:</p>

<p><i>Quamquam in rebus humus vitae delectari non fas, attamen cum hic
viderim oculis meis sanctissimum Priorem una cum duo bus fratribus
dilectissimis libenter dicam Domine nunc dimittis servum tuum,
etc.</i></p>

<p>(Although we are forbidden to take pleasure in the things of this
life, yet when I have seen here with my eyes the most holy Prior
together with two of my dearly beloved brethren I shall gladly say,
'Lord, now lettest thou Thy servant depart,' etc.)</p>

<p>'Well,' I said to myself, 'he may have been an impudent rascal if
nothing worse. But he seems to have had a sense of humour and to have
been pretty sure of his ground. I wonder how the story ended?'</p>

<p>Next moment I gave a violent start, for I heard what sounded like a
laugh close behind me. I whipped round in my chair. But there was no
one there. The library was a large room and I was some distance from
the door. Although the carpet was thick I did not think anyone could
have come in without my knowledge. However, I got up, and went all
round the room and even looked behind the window curtains. Of course I
found nobody, and sat down again feeling rather ashamed of myself for
being so fanciful.</p>

<p>There was only one more paper to be examined. Unfortunately the top
had been torn off and the first words remaining were <i>nusquan
inveniri potuit</i> (could not be found anywhere).</p>

<p>Then followed an inventory of the contents of the Chapel and cell.
The only unusual item was <i>Duae cerae nigrae</i> (Two candles of
black wax).</p>

<p>I concluded that the Prior had paid his visit, but that John's nerve
had failed him at the last moment and he had disappeared. He could have
made his way to Lynn without much difficulty and got on board a ship
bound for the Low Countries.</p>

<p>No doubt the Prior was not sorry to be rid of him, and as the
inventory was dated Festo S. Edithae MDXXXII (16 September 1532) the
convent soon had other things to think about.</p>

<p>On my way home I speculated, not for the first time, upon the
question whether there is or can be any foundation for any of the
stories of compacts between human beings and evil spirits. In the
abstract the possibility seems difficult to dispute. The belief is
ancient and widely diffused. The real point seems to be whether the
game could be worth the candle.</p>

<p>As I had finished all I meant to do at Folkham House I decided that
I would spend to-morrow on a visit to the Chapel and perhaps sketch it.
The day after I would return home.</p>

<p>When I imparted my plan to the landlord he naturally expressed a
civil regret that my stay at Stivinghoe was coming to an end. He seemed
doubtful whether the ruins (as I had learned the Chapel was called
locally) were worth visiting, seeing as it were a dull trudge along the
bank to get there. I thought from his manner that that was not his only
reason for trying to discourage me. But he was summoned elsewhere
before he had time to say more. While I was at dinner he looked in to
see if I had everything I wanted. This was an unusual piece of
condescension and I suspected an ulterior motive of some sort. I was
not mistaken. After a moment or two he made an obvious effort.</p>

<p>'You'll excuse me, Sir. But the ruins is a queer place. Rare goings
on there in those ancient times--by what I've heard.'</p>

<p>This was interesting as it suggested that some reminiscence of John
of Costessey lingered on the scene of his activities. But before I
could ask for details he went on rapidly, 'Not that I've any call to
listen to the fishermen's talk--no more than what you 'ave.'</p>

<p>After this there was obviously no more to be got out of him. But I
thought I would try a cast among the company in the parlour later on.
After some miscellaneous conversation I mentioned that I thought of
spending my last day in walking out along the bank and making a sketch
of the ruins. For some reason the company seemed to find this proposal
disturbing. No one made any comment but there was an awkward pause.
Then two ancients near the fireplace held a short muttered
conversation. The only words I could catch sounded like 'not lately,
have he?'</p>

<p>Plainly they knew more than they meant to tell. Presently someone
introduced some ordinary topic, and conversation flowed easily as
before.</p>

<p>I went to bed about eleven and slept soundly.</p>

<p>Next morning I started soon after breakfast. I had ascertained that
the tide would be low between 1 and 2 p.m. so that I should be able to
find a position from which to make a sketch. I could hardly do this if
I were confined to the bank itself. Also the day, though fine, was
windy; windy enough, I thought, to make the top of the bank a wet place
at high water.</p>

<p>I asked for some sandwiches to take with me and said that I should
be back in time for dinner as usual, probably for tea. I thought the
landlord looked at me rather reproachfully, but he said nothing When I
had gone a few steps on my way I found that I had not filled my tobacco
pouch that morning. I turned back to make the omission good and my eye
was caught by a horseshoe nailed over the front door. Nothing
remarkable in that, you may say, but I wondered that I had not noticed
it before, as it now seemed to be unusually conspicuous.</p>

<p>The walk along the bank was pleasant enough. I could see over miles
of marsh on either hand. Inland there were groups of red-roofed
cottages to be seen, with occasional windmills and church towers. In
front of me lay the sea. At the moment no fishing-boats were visible,
but the smoke of one or two large ships could be seen on the
horizon.</p>

<p>Altogether an exhilarating prospect. But somehow or other I did not
feel at all exhilarated. On the contrary I had to admit that I was
nervous and depressed.</p>

<p>Certainly I had had some odd little experiences since I had touched
the Stivinghoe papers, First there was the feeling that I was being
followed on the way home. Then my uncomfortable and inconclusive dream.
Then the laugh which I thought (no, <i>knew</i>) that I had heard in
the library; and last of all the obvious conviction of the
neighbourhood that the ruins were better left alone. What should I do
if I saw a figure emerge from the Chapel and come along the bank to
meet me? Should I enter into conversation or should I get down on to
the sand and hope that he would pass me by? Or should I run for it? Or
could I recall on the spur of the moment any form of exorcism which
might prove effective? Fortunately I did not have to answer any of
these questions.</p>

<p>The Chapel was a small building, roughly built of grey flint. It
measured about twenty-two feet by ten and was lighted by a single
lancet in the east wall. There was a door at the west end, I put its
date at a little before 1350. Of course the roof was gone, but the
walls looked fairly sound. The altar was still in place. But I noticed
that the usual consecration crosses (one in the middle and one at each
corner) had been deliberately obliterated. The chisel marks could be
seen clearly. Such reforming zeal seemed to be almost excessive.</p>

<p>On the south (that is on the landward) side of the Chapel there were
some small mounds which presumably indicated the site of the priest's
dwelling. The superstructure had disappeared so completely that I
wondered whether it had been of wood; also whether it could possibly be
worth while to return with a spade.</p>

<p>I sat down on one of the mounds and ate my sandwiches. Then I
thought it time to set about my sketch. I went down on to the sand and
decided that the best position was a few yards to seaward. (In this
part of Norfolk the coast runs east and west, so that the sea is to the
north. The natives are fond of assuring visitors that there is nothing
between them and the North Pole. No one who has been there in winter is
likely to wish to dispute this statement.) The tide was still ebbing,
so I should have plenty of time to do what I wanted.</p>

<p>I settled myself and my sketching materials, but somehow I did not
make very good progress. I had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there
was somebody behind me, and caught myself wondering what I should do if
a hand (probably a large and bony one) were suddenly laid upon my
shoulder. I said aloud 'ridiculous' and as I did so a gull passed very
close above my head and gave a derisive squawk, which seemed to
indicate his complete concurrence.</p>

<p>The gulls were very many; which was not surprising. But they were so
tame (or impudent, whichever you like to call it) that they were a
positive nuisance. They flapped their wings almost in my face and one
actually perched on my easel. I suppose they had never seen enough of
men to be afraid of them. I had a sandwich or two left which I threw as
far as I could towards the water's edge. This drew them off for a
little, but they were soon as bad as ever. However, I got a sketch of
some sort finished. I thought I would take one more look inside the
Chapel before I started to walk home in case there were any detail of
interest which I had missed. The floor was covered with coarse turf.
Probably it had never been paved; if it had, the paving had been
covered long since. But just in front of the altar I noticed a patch
which somehow looked different from the rest. I had in my knife one of
those curious implements said to be intended for taking stones out of
horses' feet, and it seemed that at last I had a chance of using it. I
scratched at the turf and very soon my hook grated upon a stone. A
little scraping disclosed a small rectangular slab about twenty inches
long by eight broad. A pentacle had been scratched upon it rather
roughly. It was obviously the lid of something, if it were too small
for any kind of coffin. A little more scraping of the earth round its
edges and I got it up with less difficulty than I had expected. It was
the lid of a coffin of sorts after all and in the coffin were some
bones; clearly those of a small monkey. Its forepaws were crossed upon
its breast and from some fragments of stuff which lay about I came to
the conclusion that it had been buried in some sort of monastic
habit.</p>

<p>This discovery explained the stories of the imp. Perhaps John had
been really fond of his pet who must have been his only companion.
Burial before the altar might perhaps be condoned. But the monastic
habit looked like a profane jest. Or was it more than a jest? Taken in
conjunction with the pentacle on the lid, the candles of black wax
found by the Prior and the erasure of the consecration crosses (which I
now began to think was John's handiwork and not the doing of any
zealous follower of Dowsing) there was a definite suggestion of serious
and sinister purpose. What unhallowed rites had been celebrated there,
with what evil intent? And (I could not repress the, further question)
in what company?</p>

<p>However, there seemed to be nothing for me to do but to leave things
as I had found them. Which I did. The afternoon was wearing on, so I
started for home. The tide had probably turned but was still very low.
At the seaward end the line of the bank was curved, so I saw that I
could shorten my walk considerably if I took to the sands and struck
the bank again in about a mile. When I had gone a little way I turned
to take a final look at the Chapel. It was a sunny day with big white
clouds driving before the wind. As I looked the shadow of one passed
across the Chapel, and by some odd trick of light made it seem as if a
dark figure had emerged from the door and dropped down the far side of
the bank. For a moment I was really startled.</p>

<p>I turned and went on with my walk. I have never considered myself a
fanciful person, but it was borne in upon me very forcibly that the
sooner I was sitting down to tea at the <i>Fishmongers' Arms</i> the
happier I should be.</p>

<p>Presently I reached the point at which I must take to the bank
again. Just as I got to the edge of the sand I saw the print of a naked
human foot, pointing towards the bank. It was very recent and could
(apparently) only have been made by someone who had passed me quite
close, having come across the sand as I had, and gone up the bank
before me. This was frankly impossible. Had there been anyone else
about I could not have failed to see him. The sand was too wet to hold
impressions for long. Most of my own tracks had disappeared already.
Yet there was the footprint, unmistakably. I stooped and looked at it
(there was only one, which made it odder still) closely. It struck me
as unusually bony, that is to say, the bones showed more plainly than I
should have expected. I thought of the shadow which I had seen pass
across the end of the Chapel. Had it, after all, emerged from the
inside? If I went on, should I find someone waiting for me, and with
what intent? However, there was nothing for it but to go on. I was
within sight of the village now and there were people about who would
see if any attack were made upon me, though what help they would be
able to give was another matter. So on I went, and in a few minutes had
reached my inn safely.</p>

<p>I turned on the doorstep to take a look over the marshes. Very
lonely and solemn they were and very dark was the little Chapel. There
was no one to be seen; I had not expected that there would be. By this
time the wind had freshened and there was a hard brightness on the
northeastern horizon which foretold a full gale before morning. There
was an old barometer just inside the front door which had fallen so low
that I wondered whether it were trustworthy and hoped not. The landlord
emerged and appeared ill at ease, and at the same time glad to see
me--possibly by reason of the weather; possibly not. He murmured
something to the effect of no harm done, as he returned to his
occupations. I felt curiously tired, and when I had had tea, after a
poor pretence of reading some book (I forget now what) dozed in an
armchair by the fire.</p>

<p>I was roused by a clap of thunder and the storm broke with a roar
like a train. The thunder was unusual, I thought, for the time of year,
especially as the last few days had not been particularly hot. Also,
the wind was off the sea, and I knew that there was a belief along the
coast that when a thunderstorm comes up from the sea, that will be the
beginning of the end of the world.</p>

<p>The <i>Fishmongers' Arms</i> was built to stand weather. But I doubt
whether it ever had a worse buffeting than it got that night. There was
no more thunder, but the rain came down in sheets and the wind tore at
the house till I could almost imagine I felt it swaying to and fro. It
was obvious that there would be no customers at the bar, so after
dinner I invited the landlord to come to my sitting-room to smoke a
cigar and drink a whisky and soda with me. I was really glad of his
company, and he seemed to be of mine. We tried to talk of indifferent
subjects, but could not do much save listen to the wind. We went to bed
about eleven, though there was not much prospect of sleep. I wished
that I had not remembered at that moment that Richard Kidder, Bishop of
Bath and Wells, had been killed in his bed, together with his wife, by
the fall of a chimney-stack through the roof of the palace during the
terrible storm of 26-7 November, 1703.</p>

<p>Soon after midnight there was a screech (I can call it nothing else)
like that of an animal in pain. I could hardly have believed that the
wind could have made such a sound. This seemed to be its last effort,
and the storm died away almost as quickly as it had arisen.</p>

<p>When I looked out next morning the Chapel was gone. The whole end of
the bank had been washed away. The gale had coincided with a spring
tide and I suspect that most of the marsh had been under water for some
hours. Of course the tip of the bank had caught the full force of the
sea.</p>

<p>I must confess that I felt relieved At first I was glad that I had
made a sketch of the Chapel. But after a little reflection I burned it.
Somehow I felt safer as I saw it turn to ashes.</p>

<h2><a name="c4"></a>THE SUNDIAL</h2>

<p>The following story came into my hands by pure chance. I had
wandered into a second-hand book-shop in the neighbourhood of the
Charing Cross Road and was about to leave it empty-handed. On a shelf
near the door my eye fell upon a copy of Hacket's <i>Scrinia
Reserata</i> solidly bound in leather, which I thought well worth the
few shillings which the proprietor was willing to accept for it. It is
not an easy book to come by, and is of real value to anyone who wants
to understand certain aspects of English Church History during the
first half of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>When I opened the book at home a thickish wad of paper fell out. It
proved to consist of several sheets of foolscap covered with writing. I
have reproduced the contents word for word.</p>

<p>From the look of the paper I judged that it had been there for at
least thirty years. The author had not signed it, and there was nothing
to indicate to whom the book had belonged. I think I could make a guess
at the neighbourhood to which the story relates, and if I am right it
should not be difficult to identify the house and discover the name of
the tenant. But as he seems to have wished to remain anonymous he shall
do so, as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>The form of the story suggests that he intended to publish it;
probably in some magazine. As far as I know it has not been printed
before.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>I belong to one of the numerous middle-class English families which
for several generations have followed various professions, with credit,
but without ever attaining any very special distinction. In our own
case India could almost claim us as hereditary bondsmen. For more than
a century most of our men had made their way there, and had served John
Company or the Crown in various capacities. One of my uncles had risen
to be Legal Member of the Viceroy's Council. So when my own time came,
to India I went--in the Civil Service--and there I lived for five and
twenty years.</p>

<p>My career was neither more nor less adventurous than the average.
The routine of my work was occasionally broken by experiences which
would sound incredible to an English reader, and therefore need not be
set down here. Just before the time came for my retirement a legacy
made me a good deal better off than I had had any reason to expect to
be. So upon my return to England I found that it would be possible for
me to adopt the life of a country gentleman, upon a modest scale, but
with the prospect of finding sufficient occupation and amusement.</p>

<p>I was never married, and had been too long out of England to have
any very strong ties remaining. I was free to establish myself where I
pleased, and the advertisements in the <i>Field</i> and <i>Country
Life</i> offered houses of every description in every part of the
kingdom. After much correspondence, and some fruitless journeys, I came
upon one which seemed to satisfy my requirements. It lay about sixty
miles north of London upon a main line of railway. That was an
important point, as I was a Fellow of both the Asiatic and Historical
Societies, and had long looked forward to attending their meetings
regularly. As a boy I had known the neighbourhood slightly and had
liked it, though it is not generally considered beautiful. There were
two packs of hounds within reach, which could be followed with such a
stable as I should be able to afford.</p>

<p>The house was an old one. It had been a good deal larger, but part
had been battered down during the Civil War, when it was besieged by
the Parliamentary troops, and never rebuilt. It belonged to one of the
largest landowners in the county, whom I will call Lord Rye. It
generally served as the dower-house of the family, but as there was at
that moment no dowager Countess, and as Lord Rye himself was a young
man, and both his sisters were married, it was not likely to be wanted
for some time to come. It had been unoccupied for nearly two years. The
last tenant, a retired doctor, had been found dead on the lawn at the
bottom of the steps leading up to the garden door. His heart had been
in a bad condition for some time past, so that his sudden death was not
surprising; but the neighbouring village viewed the incident with some
suspicion. One or two of the older people professed to remember
traditions of 'trouble' there in former years.</p>

<p>This had made it difficult to get a caretaker, and as Lord Rye was
anxious to let again he was willing to take an almost nominal rent. In
fact his whole attitude suggested that I was doing him a favour by
becoming his tenant. About five hundred acres of shooting generally
went with the house, and I was glad to find that I could have them very
cheaply.</p>

<p>I moved in at midsummer, and each day made me more and more pleased
with my new surroundings.</p>

<p>After my years in India the garden was a particular source of
delight to me; but I will not describe it more minutely than is
necessary to make what follows intelligible. Behind the house was a
good-sized lawn, flanked by shrubbery. On the far side, parallel with
the house, ran a splendid yew hedge, nearly fifteen feet high and very
thick. It came up to the shrubbery at either end, but was pierced by
two archways about thirty yards apart, giving access to the
flower-garden beyond. Almost in the middle of the lawn was an old tree
stump, or what looked like one, some three feet high. Though covered
with ivy it was not picturesque, and I told Lord Rye that I should like
to take it up. 'Do by all means,' he said, 'I certainly should if I
lived here. I believe poor Riley (the last tenant) intended to put a
sundial there. I think it would look rather nice, don't you?'</p>

<p>This struck me as a good idea. I ordered a sundial from a well-known
firm of heliological experts in Cockspur Street, and ordered the stump
to be grubbed up as soon as it arrived.</p>

<p>One morning towards the end of September I woke unrefreshed after a
night of troubled dreams. I could not recall them very distinctly, but
I had seemed to be trying to lift a very heavy weight of some kind from
the ground. But, before I could raise it, an overwhelming terror had
taken hold of me--though I could not remember why--and I woke to find
my forehead wet with perspiration. Each time I fell asleep again the
dream repeated itself with mechanical regularity, though the details
did not become any more distinct. So I was heartily glad it had become
late enough to get up. The day was wet and chilly. I felt tired and
unwell, and was, moreover, depressed by a vague sense of impending
disaster. This was accentuated by a feeling that it lay within my power
to avert the catastrophe, if only I could discover what it was.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the weather cleared, and I thought that a ride
would do me good. I rode fairly hard for some distance, and it was past
five o'clock before I had reached my own bounds'-ditch on my way home.
At that particular place a small wood ran along the edge of my property
for about a quarter of a mile. I was riding slowly down the outside,
and was perhaps a hundred yards from the angle where I meant to turn
it, when I noticed a man standing at the corner. The light was
beginning to fail, and he was so close to the edge of the wood that at
first I could not be sure whether it was a human figure, or only an
oddly shaped tree-stump which I had never noticed before. But when I
got a little nearer I saw that my first impression had been correct,
and that it was a man. He seemed to be dressed like an ordinary
agricultural labourer. He was standing absolutely still and seemed to
be looking very intently in my direction. But he was shading his eyes
with his hand, so that I could not make out his face. Before I had got
close enough to make him out more definitely he turned suddenly and
vanished round the corner of the wood. His movements were rapid: but he
somehow gave the impression of being deformed, though in what precise
respect I could not tell. Naturally my suspicions were stirred, so I
put my horse to a canter. But when we had reached the corner he shied
violently, and I had some difficulty in getting him to pass it. When we
had got round, the mysterious man was nowhere to be seen. In front and
on the left hand lay a very large stubble field, without a vestige of
cover of any kind. I could see that he was not crossing it, and unless
he had flown he could not have reached the other side.</p>

<p>On the right hand lay the ditch bounding the wood. As is usual in
that country it was both wide and deep, and had some two or three feet
of mud and water at the bottom. If the man had gone that way he had
some very pressing reason for wishing to avoid me: and I could detect
no trace of his passage at any point.</p>

<p>So there was nothing to be done but go home, and tell the policeman
next day to keep his eyes open for any suspicious strangers. However,
no attempts were made upon any of my belongings, and when October came
my pheasants did not seem to have been unlawfully diminished.</p>

<p>October that year was stormy, and one Saturday night about the
middle of the month it blew a regular gale. I lay awake long listening
to the wind, and to all the confused sounds which fill an old house in
stormy weather. Twice I seemed to hear footsteps in the passage. Once I
could have almost sworn my door was cautiously opened and closed again.
When at last I dropped off I was disturbed by a repetition of my former
dream. But this time the details were rather more distinct. Again I was
trying to lift a heavy weight from the ground: but now I knew that
there was something hidden under it. What the concealed object might be
I could not tell, but as I worked to bring it to light a feeling began
to creep over me that I did not want to see it. This soon deepened into
horror at the bare idea of seeing it: though I had still no notion what
manner of thing it might be. Yet I could not abandon my task. So
presently I found myself in the position of working hard to accomplish
what I would have given the world to have left undone. At this point I
woke, to find myself shaking with fright, and repeating aloud the
apparently meaningless sentence--'If you'll pull, I'll push.'</p>

<p>I did not sleep for the rest of that night. Beside the noise of the
storm the prospect of a repetition of that dream was quite enough to
keep me awake. To add to my discomfort a verse from Ecclesiastes ran in
my head with dismal persistence--'But if a man live many years and
rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the days of darkness, for
they shall be many.' Days of darkness seemed to be coming upon me now,
and my mind was filled with vague alarm.</p>

<p>The next day was fine, and after Church I thought I would see how my
fruit trees had fared during the night. The kitchen-garden was enclosed
by a high brick wall. On the side nearest the house there were two
doors, which were always kept locked on Sunday. In the wall opposite
was a trap-door, about three feet square, giving on to a rather untidy
piece of ground, partly orchard and partly waste. When I had unlocked
the door I saw standing by the opposite wall the figure which I had
seen at the corner of the wood. His neck was abnormally long, and so
malformed that his head lolled sideways on to his right shoulder in a
disgusting and almost inhuman fashion. He was bent almost double; and I
think he was misshapen in some other respect as well. But of that I
could not be certain. He raised his hand with what seemed to be a
threatening gesture, then turned, and slipped through the trap-door
with remarkable quickness. I was after him immediately, but on reaching
the opposite wall received a shock which stopped me like a physical
blow. The trap-door was shut and bolted on the inside. I tried to
persuade myself that a violent slam might make the bolts shoot, but I
knew that that was really impossible. I had to choose between two
explanations. Either my visitor was a complete hallucination, or else
he possessed the unusual power of being able to bolt a door upon the
side on which he himself was not. The latter was upon the whole the
more comforting, and--in view of some of my Indian experiences--the
more probable, supposition.</p>

<p>After a little hesitation I opened the trap and, as there was
nothing to be seen, got through it and went up to the top of the
orchard, where the kennels lay. But neither of my dogs would follow the
scent. When brought to the spot where his feet must have touched the
ground they whined and showed every symptom of alarm. When I let go of
their collars they hurried home in a way which showed plainly what they
thought of the matter.</p>

<p>This seemed to dispose of the idea of hallucination, and, as before,
there was nothing else to be done but await developments as patiently
as I could. For the next fortnight nothing remarkable took place. I had
my usual health and as near an approach to my usual spirits as could
reasonably be expected. I had visitors for part of the time, but no one
to whom I should have cared to confide the story at this stage. I was
not molested further by day, and my dreams, though varied, were not
alarming.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 31st I received a letter announcing that my
sundial had been despatched, and it duly arrived in the course of the
afternoon. It was heavy, so by the time we had got it out of the
railway van and on to the lawn it was too late to place it in position
that day. The men departed to drink my health, and I turned towards the
house. Just as I reached the door I paused. A sensation--familiar to
all men who are much alone--had come over me, and I felt as if I were
being watched from behind. Usually the feeling can be dispelled by
turning round. I did so, but on this occasion the sense that I was not
alone merely increased. Of course the lawn was deserted, but I stood
looking across it for a few moments, telling myself that I must not let
my nerves play me tricks. Then I saw a face detach itself slowly from
the darkness of the hedge at one side of the left-hand arch. For a few
seconds it hung, horribly poised, in the middle of the opening like a
mask suspended by an invisible thread. Then the body to which it
belonged slid into the clear space, and I saw my acquaintance of the
wood and kitchen-garden, this time sharply outlined against a saffron
sky. There could be no mistaking his bowed form and distorted neck, but
now his appearance was made additionally abominable by his expression.
The yellow sunset light seemed to stream all round him, and showed me
features convulsed with fury. He gnashed his teeth and clawed the air
with both hands. I have never seen such a picture of impotent rage.</p>

<p>It was more by instinct than by any deliberate courage that I ran
straight across the lawn towards him. He was gone in a flash, and when
I came through the archway where he had stood he was hurrying down the
side of the hedge towards the other. He moved with an odd shuffling
gait, and I made sure that I should soon overtake him. But to my
surprise I found that I did not gain much. His limping shuffle took him
over the ground as fast as I could cover it. In fact, when I reached
the point from which I had started I thought I had actually lost a
little. When we came round for the second time there was no doubt about
it. This was humiliating, but I persevered, relying now on superior
stamina. But during the third circuit it suddenly flashed upon me that
our positions had become reversed. I was no longer the pursuer.
He--it----whatever the creature was, was now chasing me, and the
distance between us was diminishing rapidly.</p>

<p>I am not ashamed to admit that my nerve failed completely. I believe
I screamed aloud. I ran on stumblingly, helplessly, as one runs in a
dream, knowing now that the creature behind was gaining at every
stride. How long the chase lasted I do not know, but presently I could
hear his irregular footstep close behind me, and a horrible dank breath
played about the back of my neck. We were on the side towards the house
when I looked up and saw my butler standing at the garden door, with a
note in his hand. The sight of his prosaic form seemed to break the
spell which had kept me running blindly round and round the hedge. I
was almost exhausted, but I tore across the lawn, and fell in a heap at
the bottom of the steps.</p>

<p>Parker was an ex-sergeant of Marines, which amounts to saying that
he was incapable of surprise and qualified to cope with any practical
emergency which could arise. He picked me up, helped me into the house,
gave me a tumbler of brandy diluted with soda-water, and fortified
himself with another, without saying a word. How much he saw, or what
he thought of it, I could never learn, for all subsequent approaches to
the question were parried with the evasive skill which seems to be the
birthright of all them that go down to the sea in ships. But his
general view of the situation is indicated by the fact that he sent for
the Rector, not the doctor, and--as I learned afterwards--had a private
conference with him before he left the house. Soon afterwards he joined
the choir--or in his own phrase 'assisted with the singing in the
chancel'--and for many months the village church had no more regular or
vocal attendant.</p>

<p>The Rector heard my story gravely, and was by no means disposed to
make light of it. Something similar had come his way once before, when
he had had the charge of a parish on the Northumbrian Border. He was
confident, he said, that no harm could come to me that night, if I
remained indoors, and departed to look up some of his authorities on
such subjects.</p>

<p>That night was noisy with wind, so the insistent knocking which I
seemed to hear during the small hours at the garden-door and
ground-floor windows, which were secured with outside shutters, may
have had no existence outside my imagination. I had asked Parker to
occupy a dressing-room opening out of my bedroom for the night. He
seemed very ready to do so, but I do not think that he slept very much
either. Early next morning the Rector reappeared, saying that he
thought he had got a clue, though it was impossible to say yet how much
it might be worth. He had brought with him the first volume of the
parish register, and showed me the following note on the inside of the
cover:</p>

<p>'October 31st, 1578. On this day Jn. Croxton a Poore Man hanged
himself from a Beame within his House. He was a very stubborn Popish
Recusant and ye manner of his Death was in accord with his whole Life.
He was buried that evening at ye Cross Roades.'</p>

<p>'It is unfortunate,' continued the Rector, 'that we have no
sixteenth-century map of the parish. But there is a map of 1759 which
marks a hamlet at the cross-roads just outside your gate. The hamlet
doesn't exist now--you know that the population hereabouts is much less
than it used to be--but it used to be called New Cross. I think that
must mean that these particular cross-roads are comparatively recent.
Now this house is known to have been built between 1596 and 1602. The
straight way from Farley to Abbotsholme would lie nearly across its
site. I think, therefore, that the Elizabethan Lord Rye diverted the
old road when he laid out his grounds. That would also account for the
loop which the present road makes'--here he traced its course with his
finger on the map which he had brought.</p>

<p>'Now I strongly suspect that your visitor was Mr. Croxton, and that
he is buried somewhere in your grounds. If we could find the place I
think we could keep him quiet for the future. But I am afraid that
there is nothing to guide us.'</p>

<p>At this point Parker came in. 'Beg your pardon, Sir, but Hardman is
wishful to speak to you. About that there bollard on the quarter-deck,
Sir--stump on the lawn, I should have said, Sir--what you told him to
put over the side.'</p>

<p>We went out, and found Hardman and the boy looking at a large hole
in the lawn. By the side of it lay what we had taken for a tree stump.
But it had never struck root there. It was a very solid wooden stake,
some nine feet in length over all, with a sharp point. It had been
driven some six feet into the ground, passing through a layer of rubble
about three feet from the surface. At the bottom the hole widened,
forming a large, and plainly artificial, cavity. The earth here looked
as if it had been recently disturbed, but the condition of the stake
showed that that was impossible. It was obvious to both of us that we
had come upon Mr. Croxton's grave, at the original cross-roads, and
that what had appeared to be a natural stump was really the stake which
had been driven through it to keep him there. We did not, of course,
take the gardeners into our confidence, but told them to leave the
place for the present as it might contain some interesting
antiques--presumably Roman--which we would get out carefully with our
own hands.</p>

<p>We soon enlarged the shaft sufficiently to explore the cavity at the
bottom. We had naturally expected to find a skeleton, or something of
the sort, there, but we were disappointed. We could not discover the
slightest vestige of bones or body, or of any dust except that of
natural soil. Once while we were working we were startled by a harsh
sound like the cry of a night-jar, apparently very close at hand. But
whatever it was passed away very quickly, as if the creature which had
made it was on the wing, and it was not repeated.</p>

<p>By the Rector's advice we went to the churchyard and brought away
sufficient consecrated earth to fill up the cavity. The shaft was
filled up, and the sundial securely planted on top of it. The pious
mottoes with which it was adorned, according to custom, assumed for the
first time a practical significance.</p>

<p>'It not infrequently happens,' said the Rector, 'that those who for
any reason have not received full Christian Burial are unable, or
unwilling, to remain quiet in their graves, particularly if the
interment has been at all carelessly carried out in the first instance.
They seem to be particularly active on or about the anniversary of
their death in any year. The range of their activities is varied, and
it would be difficult to define the nature of the power which animates
them, or the source from which it is derived. But I incline to think
that it is less their own personality than some force inherent in the
earth itself, of which they become the vehicle. With the exception of
Vampires (who are altogether <i>sui generis</i> and virtually unknown
in this country), they can seldom do much direct physical harm. They
operate indirectly by terrifying, but are commonly compelled to stop
there. But it is always necessary for them to have free access to their
graves. If that is obstructed in any way their power seems to lapse.
That is why I think that their vitality is in some way bred of the
earth: and I am sure that you won't be troubled with any more visits
now.</p>

<p>'Our friend was afraid that your sundial would interfere with his
convenience, and I think he was trying to frighten you into leaving the
house. Of course, if your heart had been weak he might have disposed of
you as he did of your unfortunate predecessor. His projection of
himself into your dreams was part of his general plan: I incline to
think, however, that it was an error of judgment, as it might have put
you on your guard. But I very much doubt whether he could have
inflicted any physical injury on you if he had caught you yesterday
afternoon.'</p>

<p>'H'm,' said I, 'you might be right there. But I am very glad that I
shall never know.'</p>

<p>Next day Parker asked for leave to go to London. He returned with a
large picture representing King Solomon issuing directions to a
corv&eacute;e of demons of repellent aspect whom he had (according to a
well-known Jewish legend) compelled to labour at the building of the
Temple. This he proceeded to affix with drawing-pins to the inside of
the pantry door. He called my attention to it particularly, and said
that he had got it from a Jew whom he had known in Malta, who had
recently opened a branch establishment in the Whitechapel Road. I
ventured to make some comment on the singularity of the subject, but
Parker was, as usual, impenetrable. 'Beggin' your pardon, Sir,' he
said, 'there's some things what a civilian don't never 'ave no chance
of learnin', not even if 'e 'ad the brains for it. I done my twenty-one
years in the Service--<i>in puris naturalibus</i> all the time as the
saying is--and' (pointing to the figure of the King) you may lay to it
that that there man knew 'is business.'</p>

<h2><a name="c5"></a>BETWEEN SUNSET AND MOONRISE</h2>

<p>During the early part of last year it fell to me to act as executor
for an old friend. We had not seen much of each other of late, as he
had been living in the west of England, and my own time had been fully
occupied elsewhere. The time of our intimacy had been when he was vicar
of a large parish not very far from Cambridge. I will call it Yaxholme,
though that is not its name.</p>

<p>The place had seemed to suit him thoroughly. He had been on the best
of terms with his parishioners, and with the few gentry of the
neighbourhood. The church demanded a custodian of antiquarian knowledge
and artistic perception, and in these respects too my friend was
particularly well qualified for his position. But a sudden nervous
breakdown had compelled him to resign. The cause of it had always been
a mystery to his friends, for he was barely middle-aged when it took
place, and had been a man of robust health. His parish was neither
particularly laborious nor harassing; and, as far as was known, he had
no special private anxieties of any kind. But the collapse came with
startling suddenness, and was so severe that, for a time, his reason
seemed to be in danger. Two years of rest and travel enabled him to
lead a normal life again, but he was never the man he had been. He
never revisited his old parish, or any of his friends in the county;
and seemed to be ill at ease if conversation turned upon the part of
England in which it lay. It was perhaps not unnatural that he should
dislike the place which had cost him so much. But his friends could not
but regard as childish the length to which he carried his aversion.</p>

<p>He had had a distinguished career at the University, and had kept up
his intellectual interests in later life. But, except for an occasional
<i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i> in a learned periodical, he had published
nothing. I was not without hope of finding something completed among
his papers which would secure for him a permanent lace in the world of
learning. But in this I was disappointed. His literary remains were
copious, and a striking testimony to the vigour and range of his
intellect. But they were very fragmentary. There was nothing which
could be made fit for publication, except one document which I should
have preferred to suppress. But he had left particular instructions in
his will that it was to be published when he had been dead for a year.
Accordingly I subjoin it exactly as it left his hand. It was dated two
years after he had left Yaxholme, and nearly five before his death. For
reasons which will be apparent to the reader I make no comment of any
kind upon it.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>The solicitude which my friends have displayed during my illness has
placed me under obligations which I cannot hope to repay. But I feel
that I owe it to them to explain the real cause of my breakdown. I have
never spoken of it to anyone, for, had I done so, it would have been
impossible to avoid questions which I should not wish to be able to
answer. Though I have only just reached middle-age I am sure that I
have not many more years to live. And I am therefore confident that
most of my friends will survive me, and be able to hear my explanation
after my death. Nothing but a lively sense of what I owe to them could
have enabled me to undergo the pain of recalling the experience which I
am now about to set down.</p>

<p>Yaxholme lies, as they will remember, upon the extreme edge of the
Fen district. In shape it is a long oval, with a main line of railway
cutting one end. The church and vicarage were close to the station, and
round them lay a village containing nearly five-sixths of the entire
population of the parish. On the other side of the line the Fen proper
began, and stretched for many miles. Though it is now fertile corn
land, much of it had been permanently under water within living memory,
and would soon revert to its original condition if it were not for the
pumping stations. In spite of these it is not unusual to see several
hundred acres flooded in winter.</p>

<p>My own parish ran for nearly six miles, and I had therefore several
scattered farms and cottages so far from the village that a visit to
one of them took up the whole of a long afternoon. Most of them were
not on any road, and could only be reached by means of droves. For the
benefit of those who are not acquainted with the Fen I may explain that
a drove is a very imperfect sketch of the idea of a road. It is bounded
by hedges or dykes, so that the traveller cannot actually lose his way,
but it offers no further assistance to his progress. The middle is
simply a grass track, and as cattle have to be driven along it the mud
is sometimes literally knee-deep in winter. In summer the light peaty
soil rises in clouds of sable dust. In fact I seldom went down one
without recalling Hesiod's unpatriotic description of his native
village in Bceotia. 'Bad in winter; intolerable in summer; good at no
time.'</p>

<p>At the far end of one of these lay a straggling group of half a
dozen cottages, of which the most remote was inhabited by an old woman
whom I will call Mrs. Vries. In some ways she was the most interesting
of all my parishioners, and she was certainly the most perplexing. She
was not a native, but had come to live there some twenty years before,
and it was hard to see what had tempted a stranger to so unattractive a
spot. It was the last house in the parish: her nearest neighbour was a
quarter of a mile away, and she was fully three miles from a hard road
or a shop. The house itself was not at all a good one. It had been
unoccupied, I was told, for some years before she came to it, and she
had found it in a semi-ruinous condition. Yet she had not been driven
to seek a very cheap dwelling by poverty, as she had a good supply of
furniture of very good quality, and, apparently, as much money as she
required. She never gave the slightest hint as to where she had come
from, or what her previous history had been. As far as was known she
never wrote or received any letters. She must have been between fifty
and sixty when she came. Her appearance was striking, as she was tall
and thin, with an aquiline nose, and a pair of very brilliant dark
eyes, and a quantity of hair--snowwhite by the time I knew her. At one
time she must have been handsome; but she had grown rather forbidding,
and I used to think that, a couple of centuries before, she might have
had some difficulty in proving that she was not a witch. Though her
neighbours, not unnaturally, fought rather shy of her, her conversation
showed that she was a clever woman who had at some time received a good
deal of education, and had lived in cultivated surroundings. I used to
think that she must have been an upper servant--most probably lady's
maid--in a good house, and, despite the ring on her finger, suspected
that the 'Mrs.' was brevet rank.</p>

<p>One New Year's Eve I thought it my duty to visit her. I had not seen
her for some months, and a few days of frost had made the drove more
passable than it had been for several weeks. But, in spite of her
interesting personality, I always found that it required a considerable
moral effort to call at her cottage. She was always civil, and
expressed herself pleased to see me. But I could never get rid of the
idea that she regarded civility to me in the light of an insurance,
which might be claimed elsewhere. I always told myself that such
thoughts were unfounded and unworthy, but I could never repress them
altogether, and whenever I left her cottage it was with a strong
feeling that I had no desire to see her again. I used, however, to say
to myself that that was really due to personal pique (because I could
never discover that she had any religion, nor could I instil any into
her), and that the fault was therefore more mine than hers.</p>

<p>On this particular afternoon the prospect of seeing her seemed more
than usually distasteful, and my disinclination increased curiously as
I made my way along the drove. So strong did it become that if any
reasonable excuse for turning back had presented itself I am afraid I
should have seized it. However, none did: so I held on, comforting
myself with the thought that I should begin the New Year with a
comfortable sense of having discharged the most unpleasant of my
regular duties in a conscientious fashion.</p>

<p>When I reached the cottage I was a little surprised at having to
knock three times, and by hearing the sound of bolts cautiously drawn
back. Presently the door opened and Mrs. Vries peered out. As soon as
she saw who it was she made me very welcome as usual. But it was
impossible not to feel that she had been more or less expecting some
other visitor, whom she was not anxious to see. However, she
volunteered no statement, and I thought it better to pretend to have
noticed nothing unusual. On a table in the middle of the room lay a
large book in which she had obviously been reading. I was surprised to
see that it was a Bible, and that it lay open at the Book of Tobit.
Seeing that I had noticed it Mrs. Vries told me--with a little
hesitation, I thought--that she had been reading the story of Sarah and
the fiend Asmodeus. Then--the ice once broken--she plied me almost
fiercely with questions. 'To what cause did I attribute Sarah's
obsession, in the first instance?' 'Did the efficacy of Tobias' remedy
depend upon the fact that it had been prescribed by an angel?' and much
more to the same effect. Naturally my answers were rather vague, and
her good manners could not conceal her disappointment. She sat silent
for a minute or two, while I looked at her--not, I must confess,
without some alarm, for her manner had been very strange--and then said
abruptly, 'Well, will you have a cup of tea with me?' I assented
gladly, for it was nearly half-past four, and it would take me nearly
an hour and a half to get home. She took some time over the
preparations and during the meal talked with even more fluency than
usual. I could not help thinking that she was trying to make it last as
long as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, at about half-past five, I got up and said that I must go,
as I had a good many odds and ends awaiting me at home. I held out my
hand, and as she took it said, 'You must let me wish you a very happy
New Year.'</p>

<p>She stared at me for a moment, and then broke into a harsh laugh,
and said, 'If wishes were horses beggars might ride. Still, I thank you
for your good will. Goodbye.' About thirty yards from her house there
was an elbow in the drove. When I reached it I looked back and saw that
she was still standing in her doorway, with her figure sharply
silhouetted against the red glow of the kitchen fire. For one instant
the play of shadow made it look as if there were another, taller,
figure behind her, but the illusion passed directly. I waved my hand to
her and turned the corner.</p>

<p>It was a fine, still, starlight night. I reflected that the moon
would be up before I reached home, and my walk would not be unpleasant.
I had naturally been rather puzzled by Mrs. Vries' behaviour, and
decided that I must see her again before long, to ascertain whether, as
seemed possible, her mind were giving way.</p>

<p>When I had passed the other cottages of the group I noticed that the
stars were disappearing, and a thick white mist was rolling up. This
did not trouble me. The drove now ran straight until it joined the
high-road, and there was no turn into it on either side. I had
therefore no chance of losing my way, and anyone who lives in the Fens
is accustomed to fogs. It soon grew very thick, and I was conscious of
the slightly creepy feeling which a thick fog very commonly inspires. I
had been thinking of a variety of things, in somewhat desultory
fashion, when suddenly--almost as if it had been whispered into my
ear--a passage from the Book of Wisdom came into my mind and refused to
be dislodged. My nerves were good then, and I had often walked up a
lonely drove in a fog before; but still just at that moment I should
have preferred to have recalled almost anything else. For this was the
extract with which my memory was pleased to present me. 'For neither
did the dark recesses that held them guard them from fears, but sounds
rushing down rang around them; and phantoms appeared, cheerless with
unsmiling faces. And no force of fire prevailed to give them light,
neither were the brightest flames of the stars strong enough to
illumine that gloomy night. And in terror they deemed the things which
they saw to be worse than that sight on which they could not gaze. And
they lay helpless, made the sport of magic art.' (<i>Wisdom</i> xvii.
4-6).</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard a loud snort, as of a beast, apparently at my
elbow. Naturally I jumped and stood still for a moment to avoid
blundering into a stray cow, but there was nothing there. The next
moment I heard what sounded exactly like a low chuckle. This was more
disconcerting: but common sense soon came to my aid. I told myself that
the cow must have been on the other side of the hedge and not really so
close as it had seemed to be. What I had taken for a chuckle must have
been the squelching of her feet in a soft place. But I must confess
that I did not find this explanation as convincing as I could have
wished.</p>

<p>I plodded on, but soon began to feel unaccountably tired. I say
'unaccountably' because I was a good walker and often covered much more
ground than I had done that day.</p>

<p>I slackened my pace, but, as I was not out of breath, that did not
relieve me. I felt as if I were wading through water up to my middle,
or through very deep soft snow, and at last was fairly compelled to
stop. By this time I was thoroughly uneasy, wondering what could be the
matter with me. But as I had still nearly two miles to go there was
nothing for it but to push on as best I might.</p>

<p>When I started again I saw that the fog seemed to be beginning to
clear, though I could not feel a breath of air. But instead of thinning
in the ordinary way it merely rolled back a little on either hand,
producing an effect which I had never seen before. Along the sides of
the drove lay two solid banks of white, with a narrow passage clear
between them. This passage seemed to stretch for an interminable
distance, and at the far end I 'perceived' a number of figures. I say
advisedly 'perceived,' rather than 'saw,' for I do not know whether I
saw them in the ordinary sense of the word or not. That is to say--I
did not know then, and have never been able to determine since, whether
it was still dark. I only know that my power of vision seemed to be
independent of light or darkness. I perceived the figures, as one sees
the creatures of a dream, or the mental pictures which sometimes come
when one is neither quite asleep nor awake.</p>

<p>They were advancing rapidly in orderly fashion, almost like a body
of troops. The scene recalled very vividly a picture of the Israelites
marching across the Red Sea between two perpendicular walls of water,
in a set of Bible pictures which I had had as a child. I suppose that I
had not thought of that picture for more than thirty years, but now it
leapt into my mind, and I found myself saying aloud, 'Yes: of course it
must have been exactly like that. How glad I am to have seen it.'</p>

<p>I suppose it was the interest of making the comparison that kept me
from feeling the surprise which would otherwise have been occasioned by
meeting a large number of people marching down a lonely drove after
dark on a raw December evening.</p>

<p>At first I should have said there were thirty or forty in the party,
but when they had drawn a little nearer they seemed to be not more than
ten or a dozen strong. A moment later I saw to my surprise that they
were reduced to five or six. The advancing figures seemed to be melting
into one another, something after the fashion of dissolving views.
Their speed and stature increased as their numbers diminished,
suggesting that the survivors had, in some horrible fashion, absorbed
the personality of their companions. Now there appeared to be only
three, then one solitary figure of gigantic stature rushing down the
drove towards me at a fearful pace, without a sound. As he came the
mist closed behind him, so that his dark figure was thrown up against a
solid background of white: much as mountain climbers are said sometimes
to see their own shadows upon a bank of cloud. On and on he came, until
at last he towered above me and I saw his face. It has come to me once
or twice since in troubled dreams, and may come again. But I am
thankful that I have never had any clear picture of it in my waking
moments. If I had I should be afraid for my reason. I know that the
impression which it produced upon me was that of intense malignity long
baffled, and now at last within reach of its desire. I believe I
screamed aloud. Then after a pause, which seemed to last for hours, he
broke over me like a wave. There was a rushing and a streaming all
round me, and I struck out with my hands as if I were swimming. The
sensation was not unlike that of rising from a deep dive: there was the
same feeling of pressure and suffocation, but in this case coupled with
the most intense physical loathing. The only comparison which I can
suggest is that I felt as a man might feel if he were buried under a
heap of worms or toads.</p>

<p>Suddenly I seemed to be clear, and fell forward on my face. I am not
sure whether I fainted or not, but I must have lain there for some
minutes. When I picked myself up I felt a light breeze upon my forehead
and the mist was clearing away as quickly as it had come. I saw the rim
of the moon above the horizon, and my mysterious fatigue had
disappeared. I hurried forward as quickly as I could without venturing
to look behind me. I only wanted to get out of that abominable drove on
to the high-road, where there were lights and other human beings. For I
knew that what I had seen was a creature of darkness and waste places,
and that among my fellows I should be safe. When I reached home my
housekeeper looked at me oddly. Of course my clothes were muddy and
disarranged, but I suspect that there was something else unusual in my
appearance. I merely said that I had had a fall coming up a drove in
the dark, and was not feeling particularly well. I avoided the
looking-glass when I went to my room to change.</p>

<p>Coming downstairs I heard through the open kitchen door some scraps
of conversation--or rather of a monologue delivered by my
housekeeper--to the effect that no one ought to be about the droves
after dark as much as I was, and that it was a providence that things
were no worse. Her own mother's uncle had--it appeared--been down just
such another drove on just such another night, forty-two years ago come
next Christmas Eve. 'They brought 'im 'ome on a barrow with both 'is
eyes drawed down, and every drop of blood in 'is body turned. But 'e
never would speak to what 'e see, and wild cats couldn't ha' scratched
it out of him.'</p>

<p>An inaudible remark from one of the maids was met with a long sniff,
and the statement: 'Girls seem to think they know everything nowadays.'
I spent the next day in bed, as besides the shock which I had received
I had caught a bad cold. When I got up on the second I was not
surprised to hear that Mrs. Vries had been found dead on the previous
afternoon. I had hardly finished breakfast when I was told that the
policeman, whose name was Winter, would be glad to see me.</p>

<p>It appeared that on New Year's morning a half-witted boy of
seventeen, who lived at one of the other cottages down the drove, had
come to him and said that Mrs. Vries was dead, and that he must come
and enter her house. He declined to explain how he had come by the
information: so at first Mr. Winter contented himself with pointing out
that it was the first of January not of April. But the boy was so
insistent that finally he went. When repeated knockings at Mrs. Vries'
cottage produced no result he had felt justified in forcing the
back-door. She was sitting in a large wooden armchair quite dead. She
was leaning forward a little and her hands were clasping the arms so
tightly that it proved to be a matter of some difficulty to unloose her
fingers. In front of her was another chair, so close that if anyone had
been sitting in it his knees must have touched those of the dead woman.
The seat cushions were flattened down as if it had been occupied
recently by a solid personage. The tea-things had not been cleared
away, but the kitchen was perfectly clean and tidy. There was no
suspicion of foul play, as all the doors and windows were securely
fastened on the inside. Winter added that her face made him feel 'quite
sickish like,' and that the house smelt very bad for all that it was so
clean.</p>

<p>A post-mortem examination of the body showed that her heart was in a
very bad state, and enabled the coroner's jury to return a verdict of
'Death from Natural Causes.' But the doctor told me privately that she
must have had a shock of some kind. ' In fact,' he said, if anyone ever
died of fright, she did. But goodness knows what can have frightened
her in her own kitchen unless it was her own conscience. But that is
more in your line than mine.'</p>

<p>He added that he had found the examination of the body peculiarly
trying: though he could not, or would not, say why.</p>

<p>As I was the last person who had seen her alive, I attended the
inquest, but gave only formal evidence of an unimportant character. I
did not mention that the second armchair had stood in a corner of the
room during my visit, and that I had not occupied it.</p>

<p>The boy was of course called and asked how he knew she was dead. But
nothing satisfactory could be got from him. He said that there was
right houses and there was wrong houses--not to say persons--and that
'they 'had been after her for a long time. When asked whom he meant by
'they' he declined to explain, merely adding as a general statement
that he could see further into a milestone than what some people could,
for all they thought themselves so clever. His own family deposed that
he had been absolutely silent, contrary to his usual custom, from
tea-time on New Year's Eve to breakfast-time next day. Then he had
suddenly announced that Mrs. Vries was dead; and ran out of the house
before they could say anything to him. Accordingly he was dismissed,
with a warning to the effect that persons who were disrespectful to
Constituted Authorities always came to a bad end.</p>

<p>It naturally fell to me to conduct the funeral, as I could have
given no reason for refusing her Christian burial. The coffin was not
particularly weighty, but as it was being lowered into the grave the
ropes supporting it parted, and it fell several feet with a thud. The
shock dislodged a quantity of soil from the sides of the cavity, so
that the coffin was completely covered before I had had time to say
'Earth to earth: Ashes to ashes: Dust to dust.'</p>

<p>Afterwards the sexton spoke to me apologetically about the
occurrence. 'I'm fair put about, Sir, about them ropes,' he said.
'Nothing o' that sort ever 'appened afore in my time. They was pretty
nigh new too, and I thought they'd a done us for years. But just look
'ere, Sir.' Here he showed two extraordinarily ravelled ends. 'I never
see a rope part like that afore. Almost looks as if it 'ad been
scratted through by a big cat or somethink.'</p>

<p>That night I was taken ill. When I was better my doctor said that
rest and change of scene were imperative. I knew that I could never go
down a drove alone by night again, so tendered my resignation to my
Bishop. I hope that I have still a few years of usefulness before me:
but I know that I can never be as if I had not seen what I have seen.
Whether I met with my adventure through any fault of my own I cannot
tell. But of one thing I am sure. There are powers of darkness which
walk abroad in waste places: and that man is happy who has never had to
face them.</p>

<p>If anyone who reads this should ever have a similar experience and
should feel tempted to try to investigate it further, I commend to him
the counsel of Jesus-ben-Sira.</p>

<p>My son, seek not things that are too hard for thee: and search not
out things that are above thy strength.'</p>

<h2><a name="c6"></a>THE BLANK LEAVES</h2>

<p>Mr. Edward Withington was a gentleman somewhat past middle-age.
Deafness had compelled him to give up a considerable practice at the
Bar, which his friends hoped would have raised him to the Bench. He was
a widower without children, so his existence had become rather
solitary.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, he developed a strong taste for research into
pedigrees and family history of all kinds. This led him to make
numerous journeys to various parts of the country to make extracts from
Parish Registers, copy tombstones and take rubbings of brasses; and so
provided him with exactly the sort of occupation and interest which he
needed.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to picture a much more placid pursuit. Indeed,
to many people it might appear to be almost dull. But one of these
expeditions led to a very curious experience, the history of which is
here set down in his own words. He told it to me about three years
after it had happened.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>I was tracing the history of a family named Bolsover which I knew to
have settled in Lincolnshire some time in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
And I had reason to believe that if I went to a little village, which I
will call Snettersby, I should stand a good chance of gathering some of
the information which I required.</p>

<p>Accordingly upon a fine afternoon towards the end of October I
deposited myself at Scopperland, the nearest railway station, and
having engaged a room at the inn for the night began to make some
preliminary enquiries. I learned that Snettersby was about three miles
off and that it possessed an inn which my landlord did not feel able to
recommend. Having ascertained this much I thought I would walk over and
have a look at it for myself. Unless the inn were quite impossible it
would certainly be more convenient to be actually upon the spot, as
otherwise I should have to waste a good deal of time in getting to and
fro. (There were no motors in those days.)</p>

<p>My first impressions of Snettersby were favourable. It lay
picturesquely enough round a village green--as is common in that part
of England. Many of the cottages were of wood, but some were of old red
brick which had mellowed to a very attractive tint. The church lay at
one end, so screened with trees that only the top of the low square
tower could be seen. The Rectory lay upon the far side of the
churchyard and was not visible from the high-road. An early tea at
<i>The Running Man</i> assured me that I should do well enough there
for a day or two. So I engaged a bedroom for the following night and
arranged to have my bag sent for in the morning.</p>

<p>On my arrival next day I went to the Rectory and explained the
object of my visit. The Rector made no difficulty about letting me have
the keys of the church and of the safe in the vestry where the parish
registers were kept.</p>

<p>I did not spend much time in the church. It was a good-sized
Perpendicular building dating from about 1440, to which some
seventeenth-century additions had been made. It did not differ from
scores of others. The painted glass I judged to have been put in about
1850. The artist had held that Biblical characters are best represented
in yellow or magenta under-garments with cloaks of apple-green. As it
was a bright sunny morning the effect was inexpressibly vivid. There
were no interesting monuments; and as soon as I had made sure that the
mural tablets contained nothing which I wanted I turned to the
safe.</p>

<p>Now those who occupy their business in parochial registers know that
they can never foretell their luck. Sometimes the books have been well
kept and are in good condition. Sometimes, on the other hand, there are
serious gaps in the entries or page after page has become illegible
from damp. Sometimes an entire volume may be missing. But the
Snettersby registers seemed to be as good as any which I have ever come
across. The series was complete from 1558, the books had been carefully
kept and were in perfect condition. To add to my satisfaction I picked
up the Bolsovers almost immediately.</p>

<p>I was at work on the Register of Burials and had got past the middle
of the seventeenth century when I came upon a page which differed from
the rest. The entries did not cover more than two-thirds of it and the
remaining space was filled with a number of meaningless marks. Or at
any rate of marks which meant nothing to me. Some I recognized as
Hebrew letters: one was undoubtedly a Greek <i>Phi</i>. Others
suggested Runes, but I was not sufficiently familiar with Runic
lettering to be sure. There were also a number of other marks which I
thought stood for the signs of the Zodiac or something of that
kind.</p>

<p>In all there were forty-five characters: nine in the top row, eight
in the second and so on. The lines were all exactly the same distance
apart and the characters in each were carefully spaced. Whatever the
purpose of the performance might have been, considerable pains must
have been expended on it.</p>

<p>'Well,' I thought, 'someone must have wasted some of his time over
this. But as it can't help to fix the dates of the deaths of Tobias and
Shelumiel Bolsover, which is what I am after at this moment, I don't
see why it should lead me to waste any of mine.'</p>

<p>I turned over but found the next two pages blank. Probably they had
stuck together when the book was new and so had been turned over as one
by accident. On the third page the entries began again in a different
hand.</p>

<p>At this point I thought it time to return to The Running Man for
lunch. I left the book open upon the table with the written sheets
containing the extracts which I had made beside it.</p>

<p>When I came back I noticed at once that my papers had been
disarranged. I had left them in a neat heap with a sheet half-covered
with writing on top. Now they were strewn all over the table and one or
two were on the floor. A blank sheet lay beside the open volume as if
inviting me to begin upon it.</p>

<p>My first thought was naturally that it had been done by a gust of
wind. But the vestry window was shut, as it had been all the morning. I
had locked the doors leading into the church and churchyard when I left
and had taken the keys with me. But of course the clerk, or whoever was
employed to clean the church, would be likely to have a duplicate set.
He or she must have come in while I was away and disarranged my papers
by accident.</p>

<p>I soon had them in order again and went on with my pursuit of the
Bolsovers. I had found out all I wanted to know, and was just preparing
to put away, as the light was beginning to fail, when it struck me that
I might as well take a copy of the curious cypher or
cryptogram--whichever is the proper name for it. I had a friend at
Cambridge who was keenly interested in such things and would be likely
to be able to tell me what, if anything, it meant.</p>

<p>I had brought some sheets of tracing-paper, so the copy was quickly
made. I was just preparing to shut the book when a voice said very
distinctly in my ear: <i>You ought to copy the blank leaves
too</i>.'</p>

<p>It was low, but of the metallic timbre which even a deaf man can
hear. Naturally I jumped. My first idea was of course that someone had
come in unheard, as they might easily have done, and I looked round.
But there was no one there. I don't think I had really expected that
there would be.</p>

<p>I told myself that it was merely imagination, and prepared for the
second time to close the book. But as I took it up the voice came
again: <i>You must copy the blank leaves too</i>.'</p>

<p>Curiously I was not frightened. Of course I had been startled at
first, but now I felt quite anxious to carry out my invisible friend's
suggestion. But at this point a practical difficulty arose. The leaves
undoubtedly were blank. So how could I or anybody else take a copy of
them?</p>

<p>After a little consideration I hit upon what I thought a very
ingenious device. I laid the book upon the table and spread a sheet of
tracing-paper across it. On this I rested my hand with a pencil held
lightly between my fingers, shut my eyes and waited.</p>

<p>I did not have to wait long. In a few seconds the pencil began to
twitch, much as if someone had taken hold of the end. After a few
feeble scratchings it began to travel rapidly over the paper, and I let
my hand follow it. It went right round the sheet in a decided if
irregular fashion and then stopped.</p>

<p>When I opened my eyes I had no difficulty in recognizing a ground
plan of the church. At one point, just outside the north wall, there
was a dot where the point of the pencil had nearly gone through the
paper.</p>

<p>So far so good. The experiment had proved more interesting than I
had expected. But there was still another leaf to be dealt with. So I
took a second sheet of tracing-paper and arranged myself as before.</p>

<p>This time I did not have to wait at all. The pencil wrote something
very rapidly and then snapped between my fingers. I opened my eyes and
read the following verse from Isaiah. <i>Their houses shall be full of
doleful creatures and owls shall dwell there and satyrs shall dance
there</i>.</p>

<p>The hand was not my own. It was unquestionably identical with one of
those in the register: namely, the one which came to an end at the
blank leaves.</p>

<p>This, I must admit, disquieted me considerably. For it suggested
that I had somehow put myself en rapport with some person unknown who
might presently force a much closer acquaintance upon me. Still, the
mischief, if any, was done now. I collected my papers, put away the
book, locked up everything very carefully and returned the keys to the
Rectory.</p>

<p>It was dark by the time I turned out of the Rectory gate, and though
I had only a few hundred yards to walk to my inn I was glad when I got
there. For on the way I was much annoyed by what seemed to be an
unusually large bat, which kept flitting round my head, almost brushing
my face with its wings. My efforts to drive it off were not successful,
and though I was pretty sure that bats do not eat cats I did not feel
certain that one so audacious as this might not scratch the face or
bite the ears of a human being. When I got near the door of the inn it
made off, and if I had trusted to appearances I could have sworn that
it flitted straight into the house.</p>

<p>But this seemed so unlikely that I felt sure that my eyes must have
been deceived.</p>

<p>Between tea and supper I occupied myself with going over my notes on
the Bolsover family to make sure that I had got them complete. This
done, my thoughts naturally turned to the cryptogram and my copy of the
blank leaves. But I could make nothing of either. Then I must, I
suppose, have fallen asleep. I say 'I suppose' because I can only
ascribe my subsequent experience to a dream, though it was at the time,
and still remains, as vivid as anything which ever befell me in my
waking moments.</p>

<p>First the inn-parlour in which I was sitting seemed to elongate
itself until I found myself gazing down a vista of great length. At the
far end there was considerable activity of some sort, but I could not
discern exactly what was taking place. There appeared to be a number of
people gathered round a raised platform of some kind. On this a
solitary figure presently appeared. Before I could make out more the
whole scene had vanished.</p>

<p>I stared at the darkness for a minute or two. Then a point of light
appeared, as if at the end of a long tunnel. It advanced slowly, and
there could be no doubt that it was a lamp of some kind which some
person unknown was carrying. As it got nearer I felt that there was
something curious and uncanny about it, though I could not have said
exactly what. But I felt very unwilling to see it or its bearer at
close quarters. I tried hard to make him out, but could see nothing of
him at all. Before long this too disappeared and there was nothing but
darkness.</p>

<p>I was sitting beside a fire and had two candles on the table beside
me. But naturally their light did not extend very far. Beyond it the
blackness was impenetrable and gave me a sensation of infinite
distance.</p>

<p>Presently I became aware--I say advisedly became 'aware,' because I
did not see or hear anything--that the room was full of stealthy
movement. Certainly there was somebody there and he seemed to be pacing
softly to and fro, as you may see hungry tigers doing in their cages at
the zoo.</p>

<p>Was he preparing for a spring?</p>

<p>Suddenly from the edge of the darkness what looked like an arm was
protruded and very quickly withdrawn. I noticed that it was naked,
black, and very thin. There was something else unpleasant about it
which I did not take in at the moment. But on thinking it over
afterwards I realized what it was. The arm had no hand. It ended in a
stump at the wrist.</p>

<p>At this point the door burst open and the landlord tumbled into the
room with a scared expression on his usually placid countenance.</p>

<p>'Beg pardon, Sir,' he said, 'but is anything the matter? Did you
want anything?'</p>

<p>'No,' I replied. 'I didn't ring.'</p>

<p>'No, Sir--I know you didn't. There ain't no bell to begin with. But
we thought we 'eard you call out three times, Sir--all on us did.
Something 'orrible it sounded, in a manner of speaking, if you'll
excuse me saying of it.'</p>

<p>I told him that I had fallen asleep in front of the fire and must
have cried out in my sleep. I apologized for the fright I had given to
the household and he withdrew apparently reassured.</p>

<p>But I did not believe that I had been asleep, and was quite sure
that whoever had called out it was not I.</p>

<p>Happening to look up at the ceiling some play of firelight cast a
shadow like the form of a very large bat. But it was only a shadow and
disappeared immediately.</p>

<p>The appearance of the room was now entirely normal and the rest of
the evening passed uneventfully. So did the night, and by the afternoon
of the next day I was back in London.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>The next part of the story begins with two letters which Mr.
Withington received some six weeks after his visit to Snettersby. They
explain themselves so I subjoin them in full:</p>

<p>Sandford College, Cambridge.<br>
Dec. 15th, 1912.</p>

<p>Dear Withington,</p>

<p>Many thanks for the cryptogram. It's a curious thing and I never saw
one quite like it before. Of the forty-five characters, twelve are the
zodiacal signs and seven the planetary symbols. The remaining
twenty-six are letters. You were right in thinking that eleven of them
are Runes. There is one Greek, and the other fourteen are Hebrew.</p>

<p>I thought that the presence of a solitary Greek letter meant that
Greek was the language. I transliterated accordingly and after a little
juggling got the following sentence:</p>

<p>(greek characters displayed in here in the printed book)</p>

<p>(Let us stand in righteousness, let us stand in fear.)</p>

<p>The phrase comes in the Greek liturgies and had a great vogue in the
west as a charm. I don't suppose most of the people who used it knew
what it meant or where it came from.</p>

<p>I don't doubt that is what it is here. It looks as if your friend
had dabbled a bit in unlawful arts. But what precisely he thought he
was up to I can't say.</p>

<p>Yours ever, J. L. Masters. * * *</p>

<p>The Rectory,<br>
Snettersby,<br>
Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>Dec. 16th, 1912.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I must ask you to forgive me for what may seem to be an impertinent
enquiry. But I hope you will recognize that I have good grounds for
making it.</p>

<p>When you examined our Registers in October did you notice anything
remarkable in them, or did anything in any way odd or unusual befall
you? I ask because ever since your visit our quiet village has been
troubled in a curious and quite inexplicable manner. The disturbances,
which it seems difficult to assign to any natural cause, have increased
steadily until life has become almost intolerable.</p>

<p>On the day of your departure a labourer who happened to be passing
the churchyard after dark was pelted with stones and clods of earth.
After this had happened several times to other people we set a
watch--assuming naturally that it was the doing of some mischievous
boy. But we could find no one, and our vigilance seemed only to
increase the activity of our invisible assailant. On other occasions
people have been thrown violently to the ground without being able to
see who had attacked them.</p>

<p>Beside this we have been visited by a perfect plague of owls and
bats. The hooting of the owls makes sleep difficult at night, and the
bats find their way into the houses in a most extraordinary
fashion.</p>

<p>Nothing has as yet occurred during the daytime. But with the
approach of dark the entire village falls into a state of panic which
is evidently shared by the animals. The horses seem to feel it most and
in two or three cases have become quite unmanageable.</p>

<p>So far no serious injury has been inflicted upon anyone: but we
cannot tell what the next development may be. As the beginning of the
disturbances seems to have coincided with your visit I am writing to
you in the hope--I admit a faint one--that you may be able to throw
some light upon them.</p>

<p>Yours very faithfully,<br>
James R. Towers.</p>

<p>Two hours after the receipt of these letters Mr. Withington was in
the train on his way to Cambridge. A long consultation with Masters
resulted in the despatch of a telegram asking whether they could both
be put up at the Rectory for a day or two. The following afternoon
found them at Snettersby, and from this point the story can be most
conveniently continued in Mr. Withington's own words.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>By the time we had finished what we had to tell it was dark, and I
think we were all conscious that a slightly creepy feeling had come
over us. This was evidently shared by an Airedale who was lying
stretched upon the hearth-rug. He made two or three uneasy movements
and sniffed the air in a very suspicious fashion. Suddenly he jumped up
and ran across the room to the right-hand window--we were in the study,
a long room on the ground floor with three windows giving on to the
garden. He then gave several short but furious barks, turned tail and
went back to his place upon the rug.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards we heard a drumming sound upon the pane. For
a moment we thought it might have been made by a bird's wing. But it
was too regular for that. We stole across the room and drew back the
curtains. The sound was now more distinct, though considerably muffled
by the shutters. It was such as might be made by the palm of a human
hand beating steadily against the glass. It reminded me of an episode
in <i>The House by the Churchyard</i>, by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, and
I did not like it any the better for that. It certainly suggested that
there was someone outside particularly anxious to attract our
attention: or possibly to make his way into the house.</p>

<p>We were not at all sure that we were anxious for his company, but
after a moment's hesitation we unbarred the shutters. As we did so the
sound ceased. Directly afterwards it began at the middle window. But as
soon as the shutters were opened it transferred itself to the left-hand
end. Pursued there it returned to the middle. We could see nothing, but
did not like to open a window for fear of what we might admit. When we
separated and each stood at a window the sound ceased altogether. But
as soon as a window was left deserted it began again.</p>

<p>None of us liked it at all. But as we had come to Snettersby to see
the thing through we felt bound to take a bold line. So Masters and I
decided to go round outside while the Rector stayed in the room to
observe what he could. The Airedale absolutely declined to accompany
us.</p>

<p>It was a dark night, cloudy, with no moon. The door was not upon the
same side of the house as the study windows, so we had a corner to
turn. We crept round it cautiously. I was armed with an electric torch
but had not turned it on for fear of scaring our visitor
prematurely.</p>

<p>When we were round the corner we saw the three broad belts of light
coming from the three windows. Mr. Towers was standing at the middle
one and his shadow made a dark smudge upon the grass. There was nothing
else to be seen and nothing to be heard.</p>

<p>Then as we looked the shadow began to change its shape--though we
could see that Mr. Towers had not moved. It contracted to an irregular
blotch like a person--or was it an animal?--crouching upon the ground.
Then it began to oscillate backwards and forwards--as if preparing for
a spring. Then a dark arm or feeler shot out from it and was pressed
against the glass. I turned on my torch and as I did so the whole thing
disappeared, exactly as a real shadow would have done. There was
absolutely nothing there.</p>

<p>When we returned to the house Mr. Towers had not much to add to our
story. As soon as we had left the room the drumming ceased. He had
remained standing at the window to keep a look-out for anything
unusual. But there was nothing to be seen except his own shadow upon
the grass. Then he saw as we had done that it was changing its shape.
It contracted and thickened until he could make out the form of a
person wrapped in a dark cloak of some sort crouching upon the grass. A
head protruded, perfectly bald and lolling horribly as if the neck were
broken. Then an arm shot out and was pressed against the glass. It had
no hand but ended in a black spongy mass which was squeezed against the
pane. The effect of this was so indescribably disgusting that it made
him feel inclined to be sick.</p>

<p>Then the light of my torch fell upon the creature, and there was
nothing there.</p>

<p>We divided the night into watches. Two of us sat up together while
the third slept. But nothing unusual occurred.</p>

<p>Next morning we decided that the only thing which could be done was
to go to the church to see whether any explanation of our experiences
could be found there. We felt pretty sure that nothing further could
happen in the daytime.</p>

<p>Naturally we began with the Register of Burials. But when we turned
to the place from which I had copied the charm it was no longer there.
The entries only covered two-thirds of the page as before. But the
remaining third was blank. The Rector was positive that no one had
touched the volume since I had had it, as he always kept the keys of
the safe himself. And Masters' expert eye could detect no trace of any
erasure.</p>

<p>On turning over we had surprise number two. The next two pages were
no longer blank as I had seen them, but were filled with entries of the
usual kind. There was nothing surprising about the sequence of dates.
The last before the place from which I had copied the charm was 21
July, 1672: the first after it, in a different hand which continued for
several years, was 14 October of the same year.</p>

<p>Our only remaining hope seemed to be in my plan of the church and we
could think of no better course than to dig at the point outside the
north wall where my pencil had made a deep dot in the paper. If this
should involve the illegality of opening a grave that could not be
helped. Fortunately the place was upon the side of the church away from
the village. The churchyard was not a thoroughfare and was well
screened by trees. So we were pretty safe from interruption.</p>

<p>We got three spades from the Rector's potting-shed and set to work.
Being amateurs our progress was rather slow and it was not until we had
got down about three feet that I struck my spade upon something hard.
This proved to be a small object some ten inches square by five deep.
It was thickly coated with pitch and as it was not heavy we judged it
to be a wooden box.</p>

<p>Here at any rate was a find. We took it to the Rectory and got tools
to break it open. This took some little time as we had to chip the
pitch off with a chisel before we could find the fastening of the lid.
But at last we came upon some screws, which proved easier to turn than
we had expected.</p>

<p>The box contained a small and very light package done up in canvas.
We unripped this carefully and Masters unrolled it upon the table. We
found a dried human hand: a right hand which had been severed at the
wrist with a very sharp instrument. The skin was intact but there
seemed to be no vestige of fat or gristle between it and the bones. The
finger-tips were blackened as if they had been scorched by fire.</p>

<p>Of course this made us certain that we were on the right track. But
as there were still a good many gaps to be filled in we turned again to
the box to see whether it had any more information for us. Sticking to
the bottom was a small wad of paper tightly folded. It was not easy to
detach this without tearing it. But at last we got it off in good
condition. The inside contained some lines of writing and though the
ink was a good deal faded, Masters, who was very expert in such
matters, had little difficulty in deciphering it. It was in a late
seventeenth-century hand and ran as follows--</p>

<p>'Ye hande of Richd. Partridge sometyme Clerke of this Parysshe who
was hanged upon September ye Firste in ye yeare of oure Lord 1672. I
have done worse and suffer ye rewarde of my misdedes. Lord, have mercy
upon me. WM. ARCHER.'</p>

<p>'H'm,' I said, 'there's evidently a history here. I wonder what it
is? And we seem to be nearly as far as ever from any satisfactory
explanation. I suppose it was Partridge who came to the house last
night. Are we to offer him his hand if he comes again, or what?'</p>

<p>For the last few minutes Masters had been looking very grave. He now
said suddenly and with great emphasis--Burn those tracings of yours. I
don't think I'm a superstitious man. But I don't like this one little
bit. And so I say burn them.'</p>

<p>We were standing in front of the fire in the study. I took the three
sheets from my pocket and without saying anything further threw them on
to the blaze. I had been intimate with Masters for many years, and knew
that he was not easily moved, and did not say what he did not mean.</p>

<p>They caught at once; a feather of ash whirled up the chimney and was
gone.</p>

<p>'Well,' I said, 'that's the end of them. But now what are we to do
with the hand?'</p>

<p>We turned to look at it, where we had left it lying upon the
table--but it was gone. The box was there, and the canvas wrapper; so
was the paper. But of the hand itself there was not the slightest
trace. Yet we had not had our backs turned for more than a few seconds.
While we stared blankly at one another there came from somewhere
outside the melancholy hoot of an owl.</p>

<p>'There are two things I want to do now,' said Masters, 'and if
you'll both come with me we can just manage them before the light goes.
First, I want to put back the box where it came from, and then I want
to have another look at the Register.'</p>

<p>The first task was quickly performed. We had cut the top sods
carefully, and when we had put them back felt satisfied that in a few
weeks the place would show very few signs of having been disturbed.</p>

<p>Then we adjourned to the vestry. Masters, who had remained silent
since we left the house, took the seventeenth-century volume and began
to read the entries: while we waited. He had hardly had the book in his
hands for more than a minute when he said, half to himself and half to
us--'I thought as much.' Then he read aloud 'September 5th, 1673,
William Archer. Dyed September 1st. The verdict of the Crowner's Quest
was The Visitation of God.'</p>

<p>'Visitation of God,' he went on. Wm. I fancy we are in a position to
correct that verdict. Partridge must have got him all right, on the
anniversary of his own execution too! I wonder how he managed it?
That's all. Let's go back.'</p>

<p>At a later hour in the evening he consented to give us his theory of
what had occurred.</p>

<p>'I have never been able,' he said, to dismiss witchcraft, etcetera,
as lightly as some people do. I don't profess to be able to explain it.
Perhaps there isn't any explanation. Or perhaps it is really too simple
to need one. But anyhow I think it is a force which has to be reckoned
with. More perhaps in the past than to-day. But it isn't dead yet.
Partridge must have been up to devilry of some kind--it would be
interesting to know whether he was hanged for that or for something
commonplace like murder or highway robbery--and he meant something by
that charm. He seems to have had a pretty apt pupil in Mr. Archer
too.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of The Hand of Glory? It comes in one of the
Ingoldsby Legends, you know. If you could get the right hand of a
corpse and turn it into a lamp by fixing a wick steeped in <i>human</i>
fat to each finger-tip the highest walks of burglary were open to you
at once. On the approach of the hand everyone falls into a sleep from
which no noise can wake them, and all locks and bolts fly open of their
own accord. If the original proprietor of the hand does happen to have
been hanged--so much the better. Well--no doubt that was Archer's
game--or one of his games.</p>

<p>Partridge didn't like it, for which I don't blame him myself: and I
expect he gave Archer a pretty bad time. Archer got frightened, and as
he couldn't get at Partridge's body again for some reason did the best
he could by burying the hand.</p>

<p>Well--Partridge got him all right as we know. But he still wanted
his hand and didn't know how to come at that. I expect the fact that it
was in consecrated ground was what defeated him. When you started
digging in his volume of the Registers, which probably hadn't been
touched for a couple of centuries--I noticed that the last entry was
1703--he thought he saw a chance. And when you copied his charm you, as
it were, wound the machine up and he could get to work. He gave you a
clue and a warning--both rather vague I admit--and followed that up
with his show at the inn. When you left Snettersby he had got to get
you back somehow--and he succeeded at last. Well, he's got his hand
now, and I hope he finds it useful wherever he is.'</p>

<p>Here Masters paused for a moment to attend to his whisky-and-soda.
When this had been dealt with satisfactorily he went on--</p>

<p>'Of course there are several gaps in the story which we can't fill
in. I don't know why Partridge, since he could tell you to copy the
blank leaves, couldn't go about the rest of the job more directly. All
that can be said is that gentlemen of his condition always do adopt
what seem to us to be very roundabout methods. Whether that is due to
choice or circumstances, I don't know. But I suspect the latter. In
fact their ways--as the Irish orator observed of those of
Providence--are indeed unscrupulous! However, I think we are rid of him
now.'</p>

<p>A few months later I heard from Mr. Towers that there had been no
further disturbances of any kind. He expressed a hope that I would come
and pay him a visit. But I have never gone to Snettersby again and as I
have learned all I wanted to know about the Bolsover family I don't
suppose I ever shall.</p>

<h2><a name="c7"></a>THE THIRTEENTH TREE</h2>

<p>If, as I incline to think, architecture in general and domestic
architecture in particular is the best expression of the
characteristics of the period to which it belongs, there would be a
good deal to be said in favour of having been born soon after the year
1570.</p>

<p>Late Tudor or early Jacobean houses always seem to me to exhibit the
qualities which I admire most. They are dignified and beautiful without
conscious effort. Both inside and out I find them extraordinarily
satisfying. 'This,' I say to myself, 'is what a country-house ought to
be.' They look as if they had grown from the soil as naturally as the
trees in their parks. They are as they are because the men who planned
them were solid, dignified and sure of themselves.</p>

<p>Castles speak of violence and cruelty, until they have become an
anachronism. Then they are sights to be seen rather than houses to live
in. Early Tudor houses have something upstart about them; as, it may be
suspected, had their owners. The Palladian palaces of the eighteenth
century are not free from ostentation. They were meant to display the
wealth and taste of their owners, most of whom had probably made the
Grand Tour. Despite their dignity and internal comfort I can never feel
that they belong to the English countryside. But the type of house
which was built about twenty years on either side of the year 1600
always seems to me to escape all these defects. One of them was the
scene of the story which I am now going to tell.</p>

<p>It is situated in one of the western counties. That is as much as I
shall say about its geographical position, as I do not want to bring
the <i>Society for Spectral Investigations</i>, or any similar body,
about my ears or those of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I had known the owner when we were boys. Our paths in life had
diverged and for thirty years or more we never met. We came across each
other accidentally in London, and both welcomed the opportunity of
resuming an old friendship. When he asked me to visit him I was very
glad to accept his invitation. Accordingly, a few weeks later, on a
fine day early in October, I caught a train at Paddington for my
journey westwards.</p>

<p>I had made acquaintance with the first twenty miles of the Great
Western in the year 1890, and for some time after that they had been
very familiar to me. But I had not travelled by that route for a good
many years and was horrified to see how the Great Wen (as Cobbett
rudely called London) had spread over what I remembered as pleasant
countryside. One of the few things which did not seem to have altered
since I had passed that way last was a building of really exceptional
ugliness (a hotel, I believe) close to the station at Slough. For, I
think, the first time in my life the sight of it gave me real
pleasure.</p>

<p>I had to change three times in the course of my journey and it was
nearly five o'clock when I got out at the country station where my host
met me. The light was failing when we arrived at the house and I could
only see that it was large, and that it promised to be very
beautiful.</p>

<p>I was introduced to my hostess and her two daughters, and after tea
in the hall in front of a superb log-fire in a large open fireplace my
host took me to the smoking-room.</p>

<p>'I had no idea you were such a territorial magnate,' I said to him
when we had settled down.</p>

<p>'I never expected to be,' he said. My father was a parson in the
north, and I became a solicitor in York--as you know. We lived just
outside York for the first fifteen years after I was married. I knew of
this place, but never saw it until I succeeded a distant cousin (whom I
never saw either) nearly seven years ago. He was unmarried and a
queer-tempered old chap by all accounts. Perhaps the fact that he had
never seen me influenced his choice of an heir. The place isn't
entailed and there were several distant relations beside me. It's a
curious thing, but this property has never passed in the direct male
line since Sir Robert Newton, whose portrait you'll see in the
dining-room, bought it and built the house, about the year 1602 I
believe. He was Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench. His son was drowned
in a pool in the garden. It does not exist now. It was filled in
immediately afterwards. No one could ever understand how the boy got
into it, or why, having got in, he couldn't get out, as it was quite
shallow I believe, and he was more than a child. There was a daughter
who married and brought her family here after her parents' death. But
her son was killed at Naseby, leaving several daughters. And so it has
gone on. Either there has been no son or he hasn't lived to inherit. My
immediate predecessor succeeded a childless uncle, and as we have only
two daughters we keep up the tradition. I'm really almost glad I never
had a son, as I am sure my wife would be nervous about bringing him
here. Indeed, I don't mind admitting that I think I should be. Of
course the village people say there's a curse on the place, but they
don't know why. I can't think that my respected ancestor--he is my
ancestor, if by no means in the direct line--was likely to have done
anything to provoke one.'</p>

<p>Certainly when I looked at the portrait an hour or two later I could
detect nothing evil in it. It suggested that Sir Robert had been a
shrewd and kindly person, who would probably be as lenient on the Bench
as the law allowed him to be. No doubt he had passed many sentences in
his time which we should think harsh or even savage. But that would not
have been the view of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>After dinner we sat in the library. It was a large room completely
lined with well-filled bookcases whose contents looked as if they would
repay examination. There is no saying what may not have wandered into
such a place; just as any oyster may contain a pearl of price. I asked
whether there was a catalogue.</p>

<p>'Not a very good one,' was the answer. 'In fact I'm not sure that I
shan't spend a good part of this winter trying to improve it. You'd
like to have a look round it tomorrow, I expect. A good many of the
books belonged to Sir Robert. By the way, we've put you in what is said
to have been his bedroom. It isn't often used, but we've just had to
take up the floors in some of the rooms nearer ours; dry rot, pretty
bad too. But I think you'll be quite comfortable there. No; there's no
story about it that I ever heard. We don't run to a ghost of any
kind.'</p>

<p>We went upstairs soon afterwards, and while I was undressing I
meditated upon the queer fatality which seemed to have pursued the
family for three hundred years. Was it more than a series of odd and
unfortunate coincidences? Are there, or have there ever been, people
who had some malign power which they could direct against their
enemies? If it were so, how was this power operative after their
lifetime? Did it exhaust itself after a period of time or not?</p>

<p>I had finished undressing before I had arrived at a satisfactory
answer to any of these conundrums. When I was ready for bed I went to
the window, opened it and drew back the curtains as was my custom. It
was a clear night with a good deal of moon. My room was on the first
floor at the back of the house, overlooking a part of the garden which
I had not seen before. Immediately below me lay a gravelled terrace,
bounded on the far side by a stone balustrade. On the other side of
this, at a lower level and reached by a flight of steps, lay a small
formal garden. In the middle was a circular stone basin, where I hoped
there might be a fountain. Round the edge stood a number of dark
clipped trees--yews or cypresses I could not tell which. There were
twelve of these: one at each corner and two in between. On the far side
was a low stone wall separating the garden from the park beyond. Very
white it looked in the moonlight; almost as if it were newly built.
About the middle there was a dark patch; ivy or creeper I supposed. It
made a clump on the coping and then spread sideways, in a way which
almost suggested the head and arms of a person in the act of climbing
the wall. I thought it rather ugly and decided that if I were the owner
I would have it removed. Then I went to bed.</p>

<p>For some reason sleep did not come as quickly as usual and I was
visited with the pictures--half-dreams and halfwaking--which belong to
the border-line of consciousness. Mine made two scenes. In the first I
found myself seated in a large old-fashioned travelling coach. Beside
me was a figure very much wrapped up. He turned towards me once as if
about to speak, and I recognized the original of the portrait in the
dining-room. Presently we were brought to a standstill by a great
concourse of people who seemed to be streaming away from some
spectacle. I put my head out of the window to see what it was, but drew
it in again quickly. A few yards in front of us was a gallows and there
were four bodies dangling from the cross-beam. As I sat down, feeling
as if I should be sick, a head was poked in at the window on the other
side. It belonged to a young man. The face seemed unnaturally pale.
There was something else unusual about it, but I could not take in what
it was. The young man said something in a low tone to my companion. I
could not catch the words, but they seemed to disconcert him very much.
Next moment the face had vanished and we had begun to move again. I
woke fully to find myself murmuring, <i>An eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth</i>.'</p>

<p>The second scene was a churchyard by night. A funeral was taking
place. I could see the bearers and the men with the torches and the
priest. But there appeared to be no mourners, unless I were one. As the
coffin was lowered into the grave some bird of the night gave a long
and dolorous screech very close overhead. At this I woke. I think there
must have been a hunting owl or a night-jar outside my window. As I did
not wish for any repetition of such scenes I got a book and read until
I could feel confident that I should sleep soundly.</p>

<p>When I went to my window next morning I received a surprise. There,
as was to be expected, was the garden on which I had looked the night
before. But there were no trees and no pool, and I could see no growth
upon the wall at the bottom. Yet I <i>knew</i> that I had seen those
things, and that I had not been dreaming at the time. I decided to say
nothing about them. When we went out after breakfast, however, I did
ask my host whether he knew where the pool in which Sir Robert's son
had been drowned had been. But he did not. I noticed that the wall
between the garden and park did not look as new as I had thought it the
night before. It seemed to be the same age as the rest of the house, as
was to be expected. That might, however, be due to the difference
between daylight and moonlight. The day was fine and as the
neighbourhood was new to me, most of the hours of daylight were passed
out-of-doors. After tea, when we were sitting in the library, I asked
my host whether he knew why or by whom the curse had been laid upon Sir
Robert's descendants.</p>

<p>'Well,' said he, 'there is a bit of a story about it. But all I know
is very incomplete and doesn't explain much. It seems that in the old
judge's time there was a woman in the village who was reputed to be a
witch. Nothing very out of the way about that. In fact you wouldn't
have to look very far to find witches (or reputed ones) in these
west-country villages to-day. Her name was Miriam Urch (Urch is quite a
common name in these parts) and they say that she was at the bottom of
it. But I don't know why she should have had a down on the Newtons, and
as nothing was ever proved against her she was given Christian burial
in the churchyard when her time came. You can see what is said to be
her grave close to the north door. I expect it is. Village tradition is
generally pretty accurate on such points. They aren't quite sure
whether she is always in it though, even now. I believe the Rector has
had something to say to old Job Dixon the sexton about its untidiness
more than once. But <i>he</i> says it isn't his fault. There are no
other graves anywhere near it, and I don't think there will be as long
as there is a scrap of room anywhere else.'</p>

<p>No more was said on the topic that evening and the hours after
dinner passed pleasantly with a game of bridge with my host and his two
daughters. We were all agreed that games are games, and though due
respect must be paid to the rules which govern them they ought not to
be transformed into hard and dismal forms of work.</p>

<p>It was near midnight before I found myself in my room, and when I
was ready for bed I admit that I hesitated for a moment before drawing
back my curtains. Finally curiosity prevailed. If there were anything
to be seen I might as well see it. It seemed unlikely that any harm
could come to me, or to the family through me.</p>

<p>I looked out. The moon shone brilliantly, and there, beyond any
possibility of mistake, were the pool and the twelve trees. But were
there only twelve? My first impression was that there were more. That
was absurd. I counted them again just to make sure, and, as I had
thought, there was one at each corner with two in between. But as soon
as I looked at them all together I got the impression that there were
more. But I could not have said where the additional one (I felt sure
it was only one) was, nor even whether it were always in the same
place. And I noticed that the ivy, or whatever it had been on the wall
at the bottom, was gone. It might have been cleared away during the
day, but I had an uncomfortable feeling that someone or something had
come over and was dodging about behind the trees. If so, with what
intent?</p>

<p>I began to feel an overpowering desire to go and investigate. Yet I
could hardly do that. The door leading to the terrace was doubtless
locked and bolted, and I should be sure to disturb someone in getting
it open. What could I say if I did? That I thought it a fine night for
a stroll and that I always found pyjamas the most comfortable wear for
a nocturnal ramble? For I felt quite certain--I don't know why--that
the trees and pool would be invisible to anyone except myself. All the
same, the desire to investigate more closely grew stronger and
stronger. I have never seen or experienced hypnotism, but began to feel
as I imagine a hypnotic subject does. It seemed as if I was being
dragged out by some force which was overpowering my own will, and that
if I could not get the door open I should have to jump from my
first-floor window. This would never do. As an antidote I began to
recite the first thing which came into my head. It happened to be the
<i>Battle of Lake Regillus</i> from Macaulay's <i>Days of Ancient
Rome</i> and not for the first time I blessed the wisdom of my mother
who had made us all learn quantities of poetry by heart as soon as we
could read. This particular poem had been my first major achievement in
this line. It had always remained particularly distinct in my memory
because the recitation of it had won two new half-crowns from a
godfather*, and thereby had enabled me to understand (for the first and
last time in my life) what is meant by 'the possession of wealth beyond
the dreams of avarice.'</p>

<p>[* He subsequently became Chief Justice of Trinidad, and was long
remembered for his patience with garrulous witnesses, and the fervid
eloquence of coloured advocates.]</p>

<p>I am not quite sure whether I declaimed it aloud or not. But I know
that I had only got to the end of the first stanza:</p>

<p><i>But the proud Ides when the squadron rides<br>
Shall be Rome's whitest day</i></p>

<p>when the spell, which I was quite sure had been malevolent, broke
and I was completely my own master again. I felt as one does when a
motor-car or bicycle has skidded and disaster in a ditch has been
escaped by inches. I stopped at the window because I felt sure that
something was going to happen. I did not have to wait long. A figure
appeared on the terrace; where it had come from I did not see. When it
emerged from the shadow of the house I saw that it was that of a young
man; not much more than a boy. He seemed to be dressed as a young
gentleman of quality would have been about the year 1600 or a little
later. For some reason this did not surprise me. I wondered whether I
was spying upon a lovers' meeting. The moonlight was all that could be
desired, if the air were a little chilly. But there was no second
figure to be seen. He went down the stone steps leading from the
terrace to the garden below and advanced to the edge of the pool. He
stood there for a minute or two looking down into the water. Perhaps he
was admiring the reflection of the moon. Then a very horrid thing
happened. A vague black shape darted from behind one of the trees and
flung itself upon him. It lay on top of him and had obviously forced
him into the pool face downwards with intent to drown him. I tried to
shout--though what good that could have done I don't know. But no sound
would come. I thought of going to the rescue, but found myself unable
to move. Of course that would have been equally futile could I have got
there. The next minute a heavy bank of cloud which had been creeping up
from the south-west drove across the moon and I could see no more.
There was no sound to be heard. How long I remained looking out of the
window into blackness and silence, I cannot say. Presently I found that
I could move again, so crept into bed. There was nothing more which I
could have done. I think I slept more than might have been
expected.</p>

<p>Next morning when we went into the library after breakfast, I
decided that I must make an effort and tell my host what I had seen. It
did need an effort, for I felt very unwilling to speak about it. I
don't know why. I don't think I was afraid of being laughed at and if I
were told that I had been dreaming I could only reply that I knew that
I had been awake. Somehow that made me the more reluctant. However, I
took the plunge.</p>

<p>He listened to my story very attentively, and obviously took it
seriously. When I had finished he said--'I think we know now how poor
young Newton came by his end. But who do you suppose it was that fell
upon him? Mrs. Urch? If so, why?'</p>

<p>Neither of us said anything more for a little while. I could see
that, like Odysseus on more than one occasion, he was this way and that
dividing his swift mind. Then he said, Yes. I think there's sufficient
reason. Wait a bit.'</p>

<p>We were sitting beside the fireplace as the morning was chilly. He
went to the other end of the room, climbed to the top of a short
step-ladder and took a smallish tin box from the end of a shelf. I saw
that it was tied up with string or tape and that there was a seal over
the knot. There was a label attached on which was written, in what
looked like an early eighteenth-century hand, <i>Sir Robert Newton.
Secreta. Not to be opened without sufficient reason</i>.'</p>

<p>'Well?' I said.</p>

<p>'Well,' he replied. 'Don't you think there is now?' Of course I
agreed and the string was cut.</p>

<p>The most important part of the contents was a notebook. The
handwriting was Elizabethan, and brief inspection satisfied us that the
book had belonged to the judge. It was not exactly a diary. By no means
were all the entries dated, and there did not seem to have been any
attempt to produce a complete record of the period covered, which
amounted to several years. There were a number of rather cryptic notes,
apparently relating to cases which he had tried. Whether these were
meant to direct his summing up or were merely private memoranda was not
easy to decide. Neither of us was an expert palaeographer, and to
decipher them all would obviously take some time. So we put the book
aside for the moment.</p>

<p>There were several letters from Lady Newton from which it was to be
inferred that she had gone down to the west to supervise the completion
and furnishing of the new house while her husband was detained by work
in London. These told a not unfamiliar tale of dilatory workmen, of
things ordered from a distance which were not delivered on the day
appointed and so forth. She also feared that when all was done the
original estimate would be very much exceeded. (It would have been very
interesting had she mentioned the sums, but unfortunately she did not.)
These belonged to the years 1599-1600. As one of them referred to the
good effect produced by 'your visit' it would appear that the judge had
made an excursion to the scene of action to see whether he could
expedite matters and alleviate some of his wife's troubles.</p>

<p>Underneath these was a largish sheet of paper which had been folded
more than once. This proved to be a plan of the house and
gardens--obviously by a professional hand. You will not be surprised to
hear that in the middle of the small garden below the terrace was a
circle of considerable size, which obviously indicated a pool. At a
distance of some yards were twelve dots at regular intervals forming a
square, to show where it was intended to place statues or plant trees
or something of the sort. The plan itself did not state what form of
ornament the architect had in mind. But I was in a position to say
Trees not Statues.</p>

<p>There was only one more paper. This was merely a list of about a
hundred names, presumably those of the inhabitants of the village, who
were all the judge's tenants. This was dated 7 May, 1603, which my host
thought must have been very soon after Sir Robert had come to reside
permanently in his new home. It suggested that he had begun to devote
himself seriously to the duties of a country gentleman. The name of
Miriam Urch appeared among them. It was marked with an X but there was
no note relating to her to be found. She must have lived alone, as the
names were obviously arranged according to their households and there
were no other Urches in the village. Beyond establishing the
trustworthiness of tradition--up to a point--this did not get us much
farther. Still, it was something to know that, witch or not, she really
had existed. And there did seem to have been some special point of
contact, however small, between her and the judge.</p>

<p>At this moment lunch was announced, so our investigation was
suspended.</p>

<p>When we felt disposed to resume our researches, I suggested that it
might be worth while to ask the Rector for permission to examine the
Register of Burials at the church; supposing it to be in existence. So
much was destroyed wantonly during the Commonwealth period that it is
not uncommon to find no records prior to 1662. Here, however, we were
in luck. The registers were complete from 1558 onwards. 7 May, 1603,
was our <i>terminus a quo</i> and we found the entry of the burial of
Miriam Urch on 4 November in that year. She had died on 31 October.
There was an asterisk in the margin and at the foot of the page (we
thought in another hand but could not be sure)</p>

<p>Under Ye Yew tree by ye north doore.</p>

<p>This was the only note appended to any entry in the volume. It might
be presumed that her estate was not sufficient to provide a headstone
for the grave and that no one else was prepared to bear the expense.
Also that somebody, whether at the time or afterwards, was anxious that
the site should not be forgotten.</p>

<p>We turned on. The entries were few as the population of the village
was small. We found the burial of Philip Newton, aged 19 years, on 7
November, 1604. He had died three days before.</p>

<p>I said, 'coincidences do happen. But this seems a little too close
not to have been arranged. We know, more or less, how it was done. But
I wonder why. There must be a story of some kind behind it.'</p>

<p>Our only remaining source of information was the judge's notebook,
so we returned to that. The next day was so wet that there was nothing
to distract us and as we became familiar with his hand we found that we
could read most of it without much difficulty. The impression which we
had formed on our first cursory inspection was confirmed. There were a
number of disconnected memoranda, relating to a variety of matters.
Some were dated, but not all. They seemed to cover the last ten or
twelve years of his term upon the Bench. Some were concerned with cases
which he had heard; others with purely domestic matters. Some were too
short to be fully intelligible. It looked as if it had been Sir
Robert's practice to put down from time to time whatever happened to be
passing through his mind (not necessarily every day) without attempting
to keep a systematic diary. One of the longest entries was a very noble
prayer (apparently his own composition) that he might be enabled to do
justice 'in the fear of God and with no fear of man.' Shortly after
this was another prayer for forgiveness for any failure. It was clear
that he had been a conscientious judge and had set himself a high
standard. Interesting as much of this was, it was not relevant to our
immediate purpose. We had got to almost the last page before we came
upon anything which threw any light on the subject of our
investigation.</p>

<p>The last case which he heard before his retirement, or at any rate
the last of which there was any record, was of four men for highway
robbery committed on Hounslow Heath. Their names were given: Roger
Hewitson, William Parrett, Edward Backhouse and George Urch. The first
three were bracketed together with the words Taken red-handed written
against them. But for some reason the case against George Urch seems to
have been less clear. His name was followed by a few jottings:</p>

<p><i>Taken next day. No good alibi. Identified on oath.</i></p>

<p>Then followed two or three lines which were quite illegible. Below
them the words <i>Condemned with the others</i>.</p>

<p>The only other entries were purely personal. After this trial, but
at what interval it was impossible to say, both his health and his
spirits seemed to have been affected. Twice he recorded <i>Kept my
chamber all day</i>. Once he had sent for the apothecary (to whom he
had paid two shillings and sixpence). Another entry showed that he had
paid a visit to the rector of S. Margaret's, Westminster. This ended
with the word <i>Comforted</i>. From which it would appear that
whatever his trouble was, it was not entirely physical. At this time
his .wife and family must have been elsewhere, as he spoke of arranging
for his man (whose name was Edward Hilyar) to lie in the little chamber
next to mine '--and more than once had E. H. to sit with me in the
parlour.'</p>

<p>It is a reasonable guess that George Urch the highwayman was the son
of Miriam Urch, and that it was within her knowledge that Sir Robert
had sent him to his death. Whether justly or not would not perhaps have
concerned her very closely. But the judge's own jottings suggested that
there might have been a miscarriage of justice; involuntary on his
part. She seems to have had her revenge; if, in the strict sense of the
word, she did not live to see it.</p>

<p>We returned to the churchyard. What tradition called her grave could
be identified without difficulty as there were no others near it. But
there was no vestige of any yew tree. There was, however, a shallow
depression, roughly circular and of considerable extent close to it. We
had recourse to the Rector again, not without apologies. He was able to
tell us that he believed that there had been a tree there and that
there were one or two old people living in the place who might remember
something about it. He promised to ascertain what he could and added
that, while he did not wish to appear discourteous, he thought he would
be more likely to be successful if he pursued his investigations
alone.</p>

<p>He had some information for us next day. There had been a yew tree
there, which had been blown down in a terrible storm not long after
Victoria became queen. 'It were more than two-under year old, but it
were a good riddance.' (No explanation of this was forthcoming.)</p>

<p>'Wold rector had roots grubbed and tooken away and burned. When the
men got under there was a gurt twod settin', and he spit at they zo
dellish (query devilishly) that they were frit and run for rector. When
they come back he were gone. Never zaw he no more. Rector came back wi'
'em and some things were found; bits o' bone and such-like. Rector he
wrapped up they and took they away to burn.'</p>

<p>This from a very ancient man whose father had been employed on the
work. He had heard his father and mother talking about it once after
they thought he was asleep. There had been more said. But that was all
he could remember.</p>

<p>(I conjectured that the storm was that of 6-7 January, 1839, which
seems to have been little less violent than its better-known forerunner
of November 1703. It came from the north-west. Inter alia it did
considerable damage to Bishop Longley's new palace at Ripon.)</p>

<p>The churchwardens' accounts were available and showed considerable
expenditure on repairs to the church and work (nature not specified) in
the churchyard in the February and March of that year.</p>

<p>'Well,' I said, 'that's about as much as we are ever likely to know.
I doubt whether Mrs. Urch can do any more mischief, if she likes to
give a repetition of her original performance now and again. I expect
the tree, which would have been quite a small one in her time, was
necessary somehow. There seem to be unaccountable but very rigid rules
governing these things. Perhaps we shall understand them better some
day.'</p>

<p>'You may be right,' said Phillipson. (I don't think I have mentioned
his name before.)' Now I come to think of it, there hasn't been a
direct male heir at any time since 1839 for her to try her hand on. All
the same I wonder--'</p>

<p>I was not much surprised to hear a few months later that Mr.
Phillipson thought the house too expensive and that he was conveying it
to the National Trust and going to live elsewhere.</p>

<p>I believe that it is uninhabited now, so that if Mrs. Urch ever
returns to it no one will be any the wiser or the worse.</p>

<p>I have also heard that the trustees would like to restore the sunken
garden according to the plan found amongst Sir Robert's papers. But Mr.
Phillipson is opposed to this, and while they think him rather
unreasonable they feel bound to respect his wishes.</p>

<h2><a name="c8"></a>THE COXSWAIN OF THE LIFEBOAT</h2>

<p>There is upon the coast of Suffolk a church which is locally
believed to be haunted. The rector is a friend of mine, and as I do not
want to expose him to the attentions of the Phantasmagorical
Association or any similar body, I will not describe the place
particularly. I will only say that the church is a large building in
the Perpendicular style of architecture constructed of grey flint. The
neighbourhood is popular with artists. If these details are sufficient
to enable anyone to identify it he is entitled to any reward for his
ingenuity which he can secure.</p>

<p>The ghost has never, so far as I know, had a name put to him and
nobody knows anything of his antecedents. He has never actually been
seen. But he may be heard very often. He dances and chuckles, not upon
the whole malevolently, but is always careful to keep a pillar or some
equally solid object between himself and his audience. He is very agile
and no one has ever succeeded in cornering him. It is on record that
once when the sexton was locking up he chased the ghost (who was being
noisier than usual) from pillar to pillar all down the nave. Then up
the tower staircase as far as the belfry. Still there was nothing to be
seen. By this time the sexton was hot and out of breath, so he said
rather crossly--'Hey, what are you a sniggerin' at?' A clear voice from
amongst the bells replied 'It's not funny enough for two.' The rest, as
Hamlet once remarked, is silence.</p>

<p>If the story of what befell me a good many years ago within sight of
that church is not interesting enough for two, I must apologize. But I
think it sufficiently out of the way to be worth putting on paper.</p>

<p>The church is not particularly rich in monuments. But near the font
there is a mural tablet worth attention. It commemorates the crew of
the lifeboat from 1850-69. During those years they underwent no change
and rescued no less than four hundred and fifty-two shipwrecked
mariners. That particular stretch of coast is still, I believe,
regarded by seafarers as unusually dangerous. There is no anchorage
within thirty miles and about four miles out there is a maze of
sandbanks. A sailing ship which gets among them in bad weather is lost
and even a steamship finds escape difficult. There has been talk of
putting a light there more than once, but nothing has come of it. When
there was more coastwise traffic (for the most part in small brigs)
than there is now, the calls upon the lifeboat must have been incessant
during the winter months.</p>

<p>After nineteen years of beneficent activity (I am quoting from the
tablet) disaster came. On 31 October, 1869, the boat was lost with all
hands. No bodies were recovered except that of Henry Rigg, the
coxswain. I had often wondered what lay behind this. Had they gone on
too long and allowed familiarity with danger to blind them to the fact
that they had become too old for the work--as is said to be not unknown
in the case of Swiss guides? Had the coxswain's nerve and judgment,
upon which everything depended, failed at some critical moment?
Although it was unlikely that anyone would ever be able to answer these
queries, I put them to myself more than once. For some reason, which I
could not explain, I felt sure that there was a story behind this
catastrophe which removed it from the category of ordinary hazards of
the sea, and I wished very much that I knew what it was. Irrational as
I knew the desire to be, it refused to be dislodged. In fact it became
stronger every time I saw the tablet.</p>

<p>One day when I was wandering, rather aimlessly I must admit, in the
churchyard, I suddenly found myself opposite Henry Rigg's grave. I
don't know why I had never thought of looking for it before. Perhaps I
had assumed that in view of his station in life there would be no
headstone, or at least a small and inconspicuous one which would be
difficult to find. In fact, it was a large and massive slab of the pink
granite which was popular for such purposes about the middle of the
last century. Personally I have always thought it one of the ugliest
monumental materials known to man, especially when it is polished so
highly that it looks wet. There is a striking example in the memorial
to the O.W.s who fell in the Crimean War outside Dean's Yard. In 1869
it must have been about the most expensive material which could be
procured. The inscription was brief:</p>

<p>IN MEMORY OF<br>
HENRY RIGG.</p>

<p>For nineteen years coxswain of the Life Boat<br>
Who was drowned with all his crew off the<br>
Anchor Shoal 31 October, 1869, aged 62 years.</p>

<p><i>When thou passest through the waters I will be with thee.</i></p>

<p>There was no suggestion that the stone had been erected by public
subscription. Had it been, the names of the crew would have been
recorded. I concluded that the Rigg family had paid for it, and
wondered idly how they had managed to find the money. This led to some
reflections on funeral expenditure in general. These might have been
prolonged considerably and even have reached a pitch of moral elevation
sufficient to justify their committal to paper, had I not had a sudden
feeling that there was somebody close behind me. Of course the
churchyard was a public place and anyone might have come up without my
hearing his step upon the grass. It might be somebody who had some
business with another grave; or an idler like myself who wondered what
I was staring at so intently and had allowed his curiosity to get the
better of his manners. Nothing could be more reasonable than either of
these hypotheses. But all the same I was conscious of a feeling of
discomfort; almost of alarm. I turned round quickly, but there was no
one there. I think this disturbed me quite as much as any presence,
however malevolent, could have done. I had felt so certain that there
was someone. However, as there was nothing to be seen I walked away.
When I had gone a little distance I glanced back. It was between three
and four on a November afternoon, so the light was failing. But for a
moment I could have sworn that there was an animal of some kind, either
a black cat or a black dog, I couldn't see which, sitting on the grave.
It was gone in a moment whatever it was. 'Some trick of shadow,' I said
aloud, more to reassure myself than because I believed it, and walked
on; perhaps a little more briskly. I did not look behind me again and
was glad when I was out on the high-road and only a few hundred yards
from my inn, <i>The Flood Tide</i>.</p>

<p>I had stayed there often before and was on good terms with the
landlord. If business was slack I would sometimes ask him into my
sitting-room after supper. He knew a good deal about the neighbourhood,
and was seldom reluctant to impart his knowledge. In perpetuity he
might have been a bore. But as an occasional visitor I found him very
good company.</p>

<p>I told him that I had come upon Henry Rigg's grave in the churchyard
that afternoon.</p>

<p>'Ah,' he said, 'that's a fine stone. Must have cost a deal of money
to put that up.'</p>

<p>'Yes, so I thought. Did his family pay for it, or was there a public
subscription?'</p>

<p>'No, Sir. It were not his family, for he hadn't none. Never married
and kep' himself very much to himself, if you take my meaning. When he
die a lawyer chap come over from Saxmundham and say he were executioner
for the Will. And he have the stone put and choose the text. No, there
were no talk of any subscription, for he were not liked. No, he were
not. They couldn't hardly get bearers for the coffin, I believe, and
there was some as said he didn't ought to be buried in the churchyard
at all. But rector he didn't pay no heed to they. All he say
were--Well, he'll be safer there than anywhere else I du suppose. And
so it were done. But no, he were not liked, not even by his own crew,
though he were a good seaman--to give the devil his doo--as the sayin'
goes' (the last four words seemed to be added hurriedly as an obvious
afterthought).</p>

<p>At this point a servant knocked at the door and said that the
landlord was wanted in the bar. I have not mentioned that his name was
Rust. He went off, not altogether unwillingly I thought, and about half
an hour afterwards I went to bed. Sea air always makes me sleepy.</p>

<p>The next two or three days were unusually fine for the time of year
and I spent them bicycling about the country. I was taking a belated
holiday, having been kept in London all through the summer months by a
book which I was writing: an occupation which necessitated frequent and
lengthy visits to the library of the British Museum. The manuscript was
now in the hands of the printer and I felt that a change of air and
scene would equip me to deal with the proof. I took care not to go near
the part of the churchyard where Henry Rigg's body reposed. This seemed
to me to be a wise precaution, though I must confess that I felt rather
ashamed of myself for adopting it. All the same I thought I should like
to elicit some more information about him. So one evening I invited Mr.
Rust to join me again. After a little miscellaneous conversation I came
to the point. I think he was expecting me to do so.</p>

<p>'Well, Sir,' he said, 'I don't know as I can tell you much more. I
were only a lad at the time.' (You could, but don't mean to, was my
unspoken comment.) But by what I've 'eard he was a close-fisted old
chap. And then his language. The fishermen aren't so particular as what
you or me have to be with a position to keep up. But they du say that
the way he went on at his boat's crew was like, well, like nothing--if
you take my meaning. They wouldn't ha' stood it, but that he were a
good seaman: and you don't find them under gooseberry bushes neither;
no nor yet on apple-trees. And he live all alone, with one big black
cat what were fierce enough to scrat your eyes out. And nobody knowed
what he did to pass the time away, except that he were never seen in
church. And then when he die and it come out that he had a mort o'
money in the bank at Saxmundham--well, that made more talk. How'd he
come by it and why didn't he spend it? That's what people wanted to
know. But the lawyer wouldn't tell 'em and the bank wouldn't tell 'em,
so they was as wise as they begun.'</p>

<p>'What happened to the money?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Why, he left it all to an old lady somewhere Acle way. But she
hadn't hardly got it when the house where she lived all alone got on
fire and she were burned dead to a cinder. So she didn't get no good by
it neither. And as she were interstit, what they term, and 'adn't no
relations, Queen Victoria took it. There was some as thought she did
ought to be warned. But I never 'eard that it done 'er no 'arm. You'd
ha' thought she had pretty nigh enough already, wouldn't you, Sir? But
there, she had a long family to put out, and a widow-woman too.</p>

<p>'There were an auction of Rigg's bits of things. But nobody wouldn't
bid for 'em, not a penny piece. So the lawyer chap he have them taken
away in a cart. And the man what drove the cart slip somehow, and the
wheel went over his leg, and broke that in two places. Went lame all
his life, he did.</p>

<p>'Then nobody wouldn't take the house till the agent he got some
strangers. And they didn't stop no more than a week. So then Lord
S.--what own all this part--he say--Pull that down. And it were done.
There's been nothing of it these many years 'cept a few mounds just
outside the village. The old people say it's no place now; specially
after dark. But that's as may be, for what I know.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I said, 'he must have been an odd character. Is there anyone
left who could tell me any more about him?'</p>

<p>Mr. Rust looked at me for a moment without speaking. Then--'Odd,
well, yes he were. And if I was you, Sir, I'd leave it be so. But
there's old Dan Rix what were in the coastguard when that happen. He
come up here now and again and if you was to stand him a pot of beer
and a screw of tobacco he mought get talkin'. And then again he
moughtn't.'</p>

<p>Luckily, Mr. Rix honoured <i>The Flood Tide</i> with a visit about
noon on the following day. I was in as I had happened to have a number
of letters to write. An introduction was effected without difficulty
and I followed Mr. Rust's advice with good results. I will summarize
the story I got in my own words.</p>

<p>Yes. He had known Henry Rigg for several years. Probably as well as
anybody. Nobody knew him well. He did not like him. Nobody did. But as
coxswain of the lifeboat there was no one to touch him. He (Rix)
remembered the day of the disaster very well. He was wakened about dawn
by the distress signals of a ship. One of the worst gales he ever
remembered. Wind north-east by east; the most dangerous quarter. The
lifeboat was launched as quickly as possible, Rigg swearing and cursing
mote than usual. By the time the boat was away it was quite light, so
he watched through his telescope. The ship was a small brig. Foreign
certainly: perhaps Russian. She was on the Anchor Shoal and didn't look
as if she could last an hour. He could see the men clinging to the
rigging. There was a very nasty sea, but Rigg's steering was wonderful.
The devil himself couldn't have bettered it. One funny thing he
noticed. More than once he could have sworn that there was someone
sitting beside the coxswain. Must have been the way the old boat-cloak
he always wore was blown by the wind. All went well until the lifeboat
was nearly up to the distressed ship. Then all of a sudden the helm was
put right over. The boat broached and was gone in a moment. This was
before the days of the modern self-righting boats. (I have omitted some
maritime technicalities with which the story as told to me was
embellished. It will be enough to say that the act amounted to murder
and suicide. A shore-going equivalent would be for the driver of a car
to turn it off the road at fifty miles an hour.)</p>

<p>The ship went to pieces a few minutes afterwards. There were no
survivors, and nothing by which she could be identified ever came
ashore.</p>

<p>'Curious,' I said, 'that Rigg himself, who seems to have been
entirely responsible for the disaster, was the only one who--well, I
can't say "escaped" exactly, but lived (if you can put it that way) to
receive Christian burial.' Mr. Rix took a long draught of beer, and put
down his empty mug.</p>

<p>'Ar: there's some as the sea can't drown, and others as it won't
keep!' With which oracular utterance he stumped off.</p>

<p>After lunch the wind had risen considerably, so I thought that a
walk would be pleasanter than a bicycle ride. I would go northwards
along the top of the low sandy cliffs and return with the wind behind
me along the beach. The tide would not, I knew, be high till six
o'clock, so there would be a strip of firm sand available. I walked for
a little over an hour, and it was past three o'clock when I turned down
to the beach and set my face for home. There was every prospect of a
stormy night, and the white water on the Anchor Shoal was very visible
under a grey and lowering sky. Naturally my mind ran on the story I had
heard. Local opinion evidently held that there was more in it than met
the eye. But what more it seemed unlikely I should find out. It was
solitary down there. On my right hand the cliffs were high enough to
cut off any view inland. On my left lay the sea. Some three miles in
front there was a small projection, you could hardly dignify it by
calling it a headland, screening the village for which I was bound.
Naturally I had the beach to myself. No one was likely to be about in
the gathering dusk and rising storm. On the whole I was glad of that.
The company, or even the sight, of another human being might be
welcome. But on the other hand there might be people about whom I
should not care to meet. Once I thought of turning up to the top of the
cliffs again. But that would be rather silly, and the particular
stretch which I was passing then did not look very accessible. I
certainly wasn't going to turn back to where I had come down. So I held
on.</p>

<p>Presently I saw a figure some little distance in front of me. He was
standing at the very edge of the water. I was surprised that I hadn't
noticed him before, and allowed myself to wonder for a moment whether
he had just come up from the sea. But of course that was nonsense. He
must have been sheltering, resting perhaps, on the lee side of one of
the groynes which crossed the beach at intervals. I could not make out
whether he was going in my direction or coming to meet me. After a time
I saw that he was walking up and down; like a man keeping an
appointment. An odd and uncomfortable rendezvous, I thought, and no one
else in sight. I hope he isn't waiting for me.</p>

<p>I did not like his looks, so decided to strike up along the shingle
until I had passed him, though it meant heavy going and climbing the
groynes, instead of turning them at the seaward end.</p>

<p>When I got a little nearer I saw that he was dressed like a seaman
of the last (by which I mean the eighteenth) century. In fact he
reminded me of the illustrations in a copy of <i>Treasure Island</i>
which I had had when I was a schoolboy. He wore a three-cornered hat, a
boat-cloak wrapped round him and sea-boots. But for the fact that he
had two legs he might have been Long John Silver himself. His hat was
pulled down over his forehead and the collar of his cloak turned up:
naturally enough as the wind had risen to nearly a gale and was very
cold. I could see nothing of his face, for which I was thankful. There
was something indescribably sinister, worse than sinister, downright
evil about him. However, he took no notice of me. I looked back once or
twice when I had passed him to make sure that he was not coming after
me. The last I saw of him he was still pacing up and down.</p>

<p>When I got round the little headland there were, as usual, a number
of fishing-boats drawn up near the bottom of the slipway which led from
the beach to the village. As I made my way through them I received the
impression that there was somebody dodging about among them. But as the
light had now failed considerably I could not see him distinctly. In
fact I could not be sure whether there was anyone there or not. But I
thought so; though whenever I looked steadily at the point where I had
seen him last there was nothing. Anyhow, whoever he was and whatever he
was up to, it was no business of mine and I did not feel called to
interfere. Pusillanimous perhaps. But if, as I more than half
suspected, he had an appointment to keep in the direction from which I
had come, interference on any pretext would not be likely to be very
fruitful. I won't pretend that I was not more than ordinarily glad to
find myself safely back at <i>The Flood Tide</i>.</p>

<p>After tea I settled down to read that grim, if entertaining, work of
Anatole Le Braz--<i>La l&eacute;gende de la Mort en Basse
Bretagne</i>--which was one of the few books I had brought with me. The
inn-library consisted principally of Sunday School prizes acquired from
time to time by various members of the house of Rust. From one
standpoint the collection was very gratifying, but except for <i>Little
Henry and his Bearer</i> (which I was delighted to meet again) it was
not in the first rank as literature. For the moment at any rate I
preferred the sombre stories of Anatole Le Braz. Now, the reader who
gets as far as this may assert, when he has heard the rest of what I
have to say, that I fell asleep. I cannot prove that I did not. I can
only say that I repudiate the suggestion entirely. I <i>know</i> that I
did not. Even if I did, my 'dreams' would not be easy to account
for.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly I seemed to be looking through the pages of my book
at a scene beyond. Every detail was very sharp, though the whole
picture was on a small scale. It was exactly like what one used to see
in the <i>camera obscura</i> when I was a child. Some ingenious
arrangement of lenses, and mirrors too I suppose, threw a picture of
what was passing outside on to a table in a darkened room. I suppose
such a thing hardly exists now. It could not hope to compete with the
films; though as a matter of fact I came upon one only about ten years
ago in a queer old house in Edinburgh, not far from the Castle. The
first thing I saw was a sandy beach. The light was beginning to fail
and there were unmistakable signs of gathering storm. Plainly a
reproduction of what I had looked upon not much more than an hour
before. And here was the queer sinister-looking seaman whom I had
passed. As before, I did not see him come. He was suddenly in the
picture, walking up and down. I was intensely interested, as I felt
sure that the other party to the appointment would make his appearance
before long. I was right. After not more than a minute or two I saw
someone coming from the direction of the village. He kept as close as
possible to the bottom of the cliffs, which suggested that he was
anxious to avoid being seen. That part of the beach consisted of loose
shingle, and if there is worse going than loose shingle to be found
anywhere in the world I should like to know where and what it is. (I
will not dispute the abstract possibility: I merely repeat--I should
like to know where and what it is.) He came on slowly, and presently
the old seaman saw him and stood still near the seaward end of a
groyne. When the newcomer reached the landward end he turned and ran
down it with surprising speed, bending double. He would have been quite
invisible from the far side, and not easy to pick out from the other,
or from the top of the cliff. The general effect suggested an animal
rather than a human being and was extraordinarily repulsive. He seemed
to be dressed like a fisherman, but as he too had a boat-cloak wrapped
about him I could make out no details. I could not see his face. He
struck me as unusually short, almost a dwarf, and I thought he was
slightly hump-backed. When the two men met they spoke a few words.
(Which of course I could not hear.) Then something which looked like a
small bag changed hands. The second man stowed it somewhere about his
person and started to return as he had come. Then everything became
dark and I could see no more.</p>

<p>I felt sure that there was more to come, so waited, looking down at
the pages of my book. I did not have to wait long. The next picture was
the living-room of a cottage; rather larger and better furnished than
the average, but not particularly noteworthy in any way. In the middle
of the room was a small round table above which hung an oil lamp. There
was a good fire of wood and coal on the hearth and I noticed the little
blue flames which old ship-timbers always give off. (Whether this is
due to the salt which they have absorbed, or to the tar, or to both, or
neither, I cannot say.) Between the table and the fire a man was
sitting in an easy chair smoking a long clay pipe. Beside him on the
table was a long tumbler nearly half empty from which an inviting steam
went up. I had no doubt that this was the second man I had seen on the
beach. Now that I could see him plainly I saw that I had been right in
thinking that he was almost a dwarf and, if he were not actually
hump-backed, very round-shouldered. He was swarthy, almost as if he had
gipsy blood in him, and his face was not a pleasant one. It was mean
and sly. At the same time, however, the jaw suggested courage and
determination. I could not decide whether I should dislike him more as
a friend or as an enemy.</p>

<p>His surroundings were comfortable enough, but it was soon obvious
that he was ill at ease. From time to time he fidgeted in his chair and
seemed to mutter something to himself. Once or twice he looked sharply
over his shoulder. The only other occupant of the room was a large
black cat which was pacing to and fro in regular quarter-deck fashion
on the side of the room farthest from the fire. But for the light
catching its eyes from time to time I should not have known that it was
there. They glowed very green and very bright. It seemed fairly clear
that the man was expecting a visitor--and not a welcome one either.
This suspicion was confirmed when he got up, tried the fastenings of
the shutters and satisfied himself that the door was locked and bolted.
When he sat down he mixed himself another drink. Before he had finished
it a very strange thing happened. I saw the key in the lock of the door
turn and I saw the bolts slide back. I am as certain of that as I have
ever been of anything. The door opened slowly and a man came in. Of
course it was the first man I had seen on the beach--and I did not like
him any the better at closer quarters. He did not take off his hat or
turn down the collar of his boat-cloak. So I could make no more of his
face than I had before. But I was quite sure that two more unpleasant
characters can seldom have been found in the same room.</p>

<p>The little man was obviously horribly affected by the entrance of
his visitor. But he stood up as if determined to put the best face upon
it. (By this time I think he was at least half-drunk; or, as he might
have put it himself, Three sheets in the wind.) The men did not shake
hands and no word was spoken. The newcomer drew up a chair to the table
and produced a pack of cards. The little man turned himself towards it
and they began to play. The cat jumped up upon the table and sat
watching with a baleful stare. I do not know what the game was and
could not follow it very well. But it became clear that the ace of
spades was the master-card, and the visitor held it every time. As hand
succeeded hand the face of the little man became more and more ghastly
until it was hardly human. If a cat can laugh I swear that that cat,
which I was coming to dislike as much as either of the men, was
laughing to itself. Suddenly the visitor stood up. He seemed to have
grown larger and his head almost touched the ceiling. He was between me
and the lamp, and his cloak seemed to fly out like the wings of a great
bird, so that I could see nothing but blackness. I thought I understood
what is meant by <i>darkness which may be felt</i> in the account of
the ninth of the plagues of Egypt.</p>

<p>When the scene cleared there was a new picture. I was looking at a
churchyard, which I had no difficulty in recognizing. There was an open
grave and a man standing near it; presumably the sexton. One detail
struck me as curious. There were several spades lying on the grass
beside him as if a whole party of diggers had been at work. Then I saw
the funeral procession, headed by the clergyman, approaching from the
lych-gate. It came straight towards the grave. The corpse was not to be
taken into the church. The coffin was carried by four bearers and there
were no mourners following. As soon as the service was over each of the
bearers took a spade and helped the sexton to fill the grave in. All
five men worked with immense energy, as if there were not a moment to
be lost. The clergyman (this also I thought unusual) stood by and
watched them. As soon as the work was finished the party dispersed as
rapidly as was consistent with decency. In fact they might almost be
said to have run away. Once or twice while this was going on I thought
I saw a figure of some kind just outside the lych-gate. But it was so
indistinct, that I could make nothing of it. I could not even be sure
whether there was anybody there at all.</p>

<p>When this picture disappeared I felt sure there was nothing more to
come, and soon afterwards the maid came in to lay the table for supper.
As this was my last evening I had Mr. Rust in later to help me pass it.
We talked of general matters pleasantly enough and no mention of Henry
Rigg was made. But I think we both felt the other was somehow <i>en
garde</i>. Next morning I returned to London.</p>

<p>Well, there is my story. I could not make it more interesting except
by some unwarrantable excursion into the realm of romance. I cannot
pretend to say why my adventure (if you can call it that) befell me,
nor to explain any of the details. But I think I can guess why Henry
Rigg was not popular in his lifetime and why his memory was still
odious in the pleasant little village of H---- more than thirty years
after his death. And I have sometimes wondered whether the text which
the lawyer from Saxmundham had placed on his tombstone had any secret
and sinister significance.</p>

<h2><a name="c9"></a>THE PRIEST'S BRASS</h2>

<p>The rubbing of monumental brasses in churches is one of the
occupations which attract a large number of schoolboys, but are seldom
pursued for long after reaching man's estate. The collecting of foreign
postage-stamps is another. Some stamp-collectors continue and
eventually amass very large and valuable collections. But I think they
are exceptional. I never remember to have heard of a brass-rubber who
kept on systematically for half a century or more. Yet a complete
collection of rubbings of English monumental brasses would be of great
interest and value. It would provide a record of costume,
ecclesiastical, military, civil and female, such as does not, I think,
exist at present, for a period extending from the middle of the
thirteenth century until the beginning of the sixteenth.</p>

<p>After about the year 1500 brasses become fewer, but they are still
to be found for another couple of centuries. One of the very latest
must be that of William Broderip, Vicar-choral and organist of Wells
Cathedral, who died in 1726. The matrix is all that remains now.</p>

<p>As stamp-collectors are known as Philatelists, for some reason which
I think has never been explained adequately, brass-rubbers might fairly
describe themselves as Chalcotribists--should they wish to do so.</p>

<p>Certainly Chalcotriby can be a pleasant enough occupation during the
long days of summer. It meant sallying out with map and bicycle, if
part of the journey had sometime to be done by train, and making one's
way by little lanes to remote villages, where the appearance of a
stranger is (or perhaps was--I am thinking of the golden days which
were <i>regnante Victoria</i>) an event sufficiently unusual to cause
some interest and even excitement. Whatever the present generation may
have to say against the bicycle, I maintain that there was no better
method of exploring a countryside in the days before the internal
combustion engine had, in the emphatic phrase of Lord Grenfell, 'ruined
the earth, defiled the sea and made the air dangerous.' Even now the
bicyclist can make use of routes where cars cannot follow him, and
probably sees more things worth seeing in a mile than the motorist does
in ten. As everybody knows, the part of England in which the
Chalcotribist will find most to repay him for his trouble is situated
to the east of a line drawn from Hull to Bournemouth. Within this area
there is no district in which a bicycle cannot be used.</p>

<p>My procedure was always pretty much the same. When I had found my
village, which was sometimes not too easy, I began by calling at the
Parsonage. Of course I had always written a few days beforehand, asking
leave for what I wanted to do. (This was only refused once, in a letter
which I thought very oddly worded. Soon afterwards I heard that the
writer had created a considerable sensation by appearing in the pulpit
with an umbrella in his hand. He opened this and held it above his head
during the whole of his sermon. The day was fine and the roof of the
church in good repair. A few weeks later he resigned the benefice, at
the instance of the bishop of the diocese, and (I was told) announced
his intention of devoting the remainder of his days to the cultivation
of parti-coloured roses, and the drilling of ducks. I do not know what
success he met with in either undertaking.)</p>

<p>If the incumbent was at home, I always found him friendly and
usually hospitable; sometimes almost embarrassingly so. If he had to be
out or away, I got a message to the effect that I should find the
church open and that the sexton would be about to give me any help I
wanted. If possible, I used to lunch off bread and cheese and beer at
the inn, as that wasted least time while the light was good. If I was
invited to tea I generally accepted, because by that time I had
finished my work (if you can call it that) and was prepared to enjoy a
little conversation about the place and its people before starting for
home or for wherever I had arranged to pass the night. Not a very
hazardous or very exciting way of spending a day, one would think. All
the same I did once meet with what may fairly be called an adventure,
which might have ended very unpleasantly. I have never understood it
thoroughly and up to now only two people beside myself have heard the
story. I do not think that any harm can come of putting it on paper
after a lapse of more than forty years.</p>

<p>Much Rising will serve as the name of the village concerned, and I
need not indicate its situation more particularly than that it is to be
found within the boundaries of the old diocese of Lincoln, which
anciently extended from the Humber to the Thames.</p>

<p>One fine morning in August, when the last century was nearing its
close, I might have been observed (and in fact probably was) ringing
the door-bell at the Rectory. The Rector made me very welcome. He said
that my name was familiar and I soon discovered that he had been at
Trinity Hall with two of my uncles, and intimate with one of them.
Unfortunately both he and Mrs. Foster (I ought to have mentioned his
name before) had to spend a considerable part of the day at the monthly
meeting of the hospital committee in the market-town some miles away.
As he spoke I heard the sound of a horse's feet and wheels on the
gravel outside the window, as if a trap of some kind were being brought
round to the front door.</p>

<p>'However,' he went on, 'you will find the church open and the sexton
will be about all day as he has got a grave to dig. I've told him to
expect you and give you any help you may want. We ought to be back
about four o'clock, and shall be very glad if you will come in to tea
before you start for home.' At this point, Mrs. Foster came in,
equipped for the expedition. (Roads were often very dusty then.) I will
not attempt any details of her costume, which would appear as
remarkable now as the get-up of to-day would have done then. I was
introduced, and the invitation to tea was repeated very cordially.
Then--'Alfred, my dear, it's high time we were off. You know that if
you are late, you'll find that they have made Lord Merton take the
chair. And he always goes to sleep after the first ten minutes, and
wakes up in a bad temper when we have nearly finished, and wants
everything to be discussed all over again. I can't imagine why he
doesn't resign; especially as when he is awake he never hears more than
half of what is said.'</p>

<p>As I prepared to take my leave I said, 'By the way, what is the
sexton's name? It might be convenient to know and I never like asking
people directly, if I can help it.' 'Nicholas Clenchwarton,' replied
the Rector. 'Odd, isn't it? And not the only odd thing about him
either. However, we needn't go into that now. You can tell me what you
think of him when we meet this afternoon. We really must be off now.' I
thought that the last sentences were added rather hastily. Mrs.
Foster's expression suggested that she had a good deal to say about
Nicholas Clenchwarton's oddity and was quite prepared to say it, even
if it meant finding Lord Merton in the chair at the hospital
committee.</p>

<p>When I reached the churchyard, I found that the grave had made so
much progress that the digger was invisible. The appearance of
spadefuls of earth thrown up from below showed that he was there and
hard at work. I advanced towards the place, but was still several yards
from it when he climbed out, nimbly enough, and came to meet me. It
flitted through my mind that it was a coincidence if he had decided to
knock off work at that moment, and if he had heard my step on the grass
his ears must be preternaturally sharp. Odd was certainly not an
exaggerated description of him. He was very short, almost a dwarf and,
as often happens with such people, very broad and deep in the chest.
Obviously he was extremely powerful. His complexion was swarthy and his
hair black. Both uncommon in that part of England. He looked as if he
might have more than a dash of gipsy blood in him. Had his name been
Mace, or Farr, or Lee, I should not have been surprised. He was not
wearing a hat, and two tufts of black hair stood out above his ears,
almost like horns.</p>

<p>There was something unusual about his face which I did not take in
for a moment. Then I saw that his heavy black eyebrows met in the
middle; as St. Paul's are said to have done in the <i>Acts of Paul and
Thecla</i>. He looked as if he might have been a seaman in earlier life
and I thought he would not have been out of place as one of the ship's
company of the <i>Hispaniola</i>. Gunner's mate to 'that brandy-faced
rascal Israel Hands' would have suited him very well*. [* See
<i>Treasure Island</i>.]</p>

<p>We shook hands, and I mentioned that the day was fine. He assented,
but added that the farmers would be glad of some rain. Then--'Be you
the gentleman rector told me to look for?' and on receiving an answer
in the affirmative, he jerked a thumb in the direction of the church
porch, and said 'All ready.' As he seemed to be a man of few words, I
left him, and he returned to his grave.</p>

<p>The church was small and, except for a fine Norman arch to the
chancel, presented no noteworthy architectural features. There was
little coloured glass (of which I was glad) and none of it old. The
strips of coco-nut matting which covered the floor had been rolled up
so that I could get at what I wanted without delay or difficulty. I
decided that this should be worth half a crown to Clenchwarton.</p>

<p>There were five brasses to be seen. None of them of outstanding
interest or merit, but worth a visit. The largest and most elaborate
was of Thomas Ketton, Lord of the Manor, who died on 9 September, 1513.
I wondered whether he had fallen at Flodden, but if he had, the fact
was not recorded. At the foot were some lines which I think will bear
reproduction.</p>

<p>Livest thou, Thomas? Yea, with God on high.<br>
Art thou not dead? Yea, and here I lie.<br>
I who on earth did live but for to die,<br>
Dyed for to live with Christe eternally.</p>

<p>When I had finished my rubbings, I looked round to see whether there
was another brass which I had overlooked. I could not see one, but I
had a curious feeling that there was one somewhere. The impression
became stronger, and I could almost have sworn that someone had
whispered in my ear, 'Look again.' I turned round sharply. But of
course there was no one. How could there be? I went out into the
churchyard and told the sexton that I thought I had done all I meant to
do and thanked him for his trouble. At this point my half-crown changed
hands, and this may have had something to do with the fact that when I
asked him to come to the church with me for a minute or two he raised
no objection. When we were inside, I said to him, Now, are there any
more brasses beside these five?'</p>

<p>He looked at me rather hard, and then with the air of a man who has
made his mind up after a struggle said, 'Yew arsted me, remember that
if things come orkard.' Having delivered himself of this enigmatic
utterance he turned and stumped up the chancel. Just inside the altar
rails he picked up the edge of the sanctuary carpet and disclosed a
small brass, which I saw at once to be that of a priest, vested and
holding a chalice. There did not seem to be anything unusual about it,
except that it was in bad condition.</p>

<p>'Well, there he be. Du yew fare to take his picture?'</p>

<p>'Why, yes. Why not? I shan't do it any harm.'</p>

<p>Again he paused and looked at me hard. I began to wonder whether he
were quite right in his head.</p>

<p>Then very slowly--'I du suppose not. But every seesaw has two ends,
as the saying is.' With which he took himself off.</p>

<p>Closer inspection of the brass showed that it was very much worn.
The face seemed to be almost entirely obliterated and the inscription
round the edge was largely illegible. But as it appeared to be in its
original matrix, I concluded that slab and brass must have been moved
from some more exposed position: possibly with a view to the
preservation of the figure. I knelt down and spread my paper and began
to rub. But I must admit that as I did so I began to feel
extraordinarily uncomfortable. It was as if I were setting in motion
something which had better be left quiet and once started might be
beyond control. Besides this, I kept fancying that someone was watching
me from outside, through one of the windows, which were of clear glass.
I seemed to get a glimpse of a face (and not a pleasant or friendly one
either) out of the tail of my eye. But when I looked full at this
window (not always the same one) there was nothing to be seen. Once I
got up and went out quickly, but of course there was no one; only the
sexton at work on the grave, which was too far away for him to have got
to it in time.</p>

<p>I ran round to the other side of the church to make certain that
there was no one there and then went back feeling thoroughly ashamed of
my attack of nerves. I found that my paper had been moved to a distance
of two or three feet and I had some little difficulty in replacing it
exactly right. 'Draught from the open door,' I told myself. But I did
not really think so.</p>

<p>Altogether I was heartily glad when I had finished and could make my
way out into the sunshine of the afternoon. As I passed out of the
churchyard I called to the sexton and said, 'I've finished now; you can
lock the church as soon as you like.' His reply was indistinct, but I
thought I caught something to the effect that there's those as locks
and bars won't hold.</p>

<p>On reaching the Rectory, which was only about a couple of hundred
yards away, I found Mr. Foster and his wife in a somewhat exhausted
condition, especially the lady. The committee had been very long and
<i>that</i> Mrs. Shorton (who appeared to be the Archdeacon's wife)
even more tiresome than usual. However, tea and some extremely good
cakes soon produced a more equable frame of mind.</p>

<p>'Well,' said the Rector, 'how did you get on? And what did you make
of Clenchwarton?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I found all I wanted, thank you, and I think my rubbings have
come out quite well. But I can't say that I took to him
particularly.'</p>

<p>'Take to him!' exclaimed the lady, 'I should think not indeed. He
gives me the creeps whenever I look at him. I'm sure he's a dreadful
man. It would never surprise me to hear that he had committed at least
one murder. I don't think he ought to be employed as sexton; and if
I've said so once I've said so a hundred times.'</p>

<p>'Yes, my dear, I know you have,' rejoined her husband. 'But, as you
know, I didn't appoint him. I found him here when we came, ten years
ago, and have no reason for dismissing him. As you saw,' addressing me,
'he keeps the church and churchyard very well. He must have some money
of his own (that kind of man often owns a few cottages somewhere),
because he does no other work, and he could hardly manage on what we
pay him. Of course in a small place like this the sexton's job is only
a part-time one and is paid as such, because it is assumed that he has
another. But Clenchwarton really makes it a whole-time one. He does
more than he need, and more than we pay him for. I know he isn't liked
in the village, but that may be merely because he is a "furriner" and
keeps himself very much to himself. I have no idea where he belongs. If
he has ever been married, he was a widower without children when he
came here. But I don't know even as much as that. There is nothing to
be got out of him about his antecedents.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Foster said nothing, but it was clear that she thought his
reticence prudent.</p>

<p>'They say that he is out too much at night. But if he were a poacher
he wouldn't be the only one in the parish, so I don't see why they
should mind. But I don't think they mean that; in fact, I don't know
what they do mean; and I'm not sure that they do. Anyhow the keepers
have never caught him and I never heard of him getting drunk or
anything of the kind. So I've nothing against him and he is an
extremely useful servant.'</p>

<p>'There's one thing I should like to ask before I go,' I said. 'Why
do you suppose he didn't want me to see the brass of the priest in the
sanctuary?' and I told what had passed.</p>

<p>When he had heard my story the Rector said nothing for a minute or
two. I thought he seemed to be rather disconcerted by it. Then he said,
That's very curious. The man's name was William Codd, and when Bishop
John Russell held a visitation in 1485 he was accused of practising
unlawful arts. Of course the charges were vague and I don't know how
seriously the Bishop took them. Bishops often showed plenty of common
sense in such matters, more than magistrates. Codd died almost
immediately afterwards, so no more was heard of them. There must have
been some feeling against him in the parish though, because he wasn't
buried in the chancel as the rector had a right to be. They put him at
the west end under the tower.'</p>

<p>'I suppose it was then that the brass got so badly worn,' I said,
interrupting, perhaps rather rudely.</p>

<p>Yes: I dare say. But anyhow the place didn't suit him and he seems
to have made himself troublesome in a variety of ways. Eventually they
took him up with the sanction of Bishop William Wickham (about 1590
that was) and put him where he is now. But stories live on in an
extraordinary fashion in these villages, and I believe some of the
people aren't so sure that he always is there; even to-day. I wonder
how much Clenchwarton knows and what he thinks about it. But I don't
suppose that you or I would get much out of him.'</p>

<p>Soon after this I took my leave. I had to bicycle about ten miles to
the town where I had taken a room at the inn for a week. There were
several churches in the neighbourhood which I wished to visit and the
map had showed me that this would be the most convenient centre. I
promised myself a pleasant ride in the cool of the late afternoon.
There was no summer-time, then, and six o'clock really was six. But I
was disappointed. As is usual in that part of England there was a
fairly broad strip of grass on each side of the road. Then a wide and
deep ditch, dry of course now, with a quick-set hedge beyond it.</p>

<p>As I rode along I could hear a rustling in the ditch, such as might
be made by a small animal. Nothing out of the way in that, you will
say. But what was out of the way was that the sound kept up with me, to
be exact it kept about two yards behind, never more or never less. I
put on speed, but even when I got some help from the ground I could not
shake it off. Twice I dismounted and went to the ditch. But there was
nothing to be seen. When I stopped, the rustle stopped. But as soon as
I mounted it began again. I did not like it, but there did not seem to
be anything to be done. When I got into the street of the town it
ceased.</p>

<p>I had company at my supper and afterwards in the shape of a
commercial traveller, who was not indisposed for conversation.
Ordinarily I might have found this rather tiresome. But that night I
must admit that I welcomed it. He gave me a most interesting discourse
on the way in which different kinds of soap go in and out of fashion,
and how the tastes of different villages vary and change. I gathered
that to sell soap successfully in a country district you must have a
considerable endowment of prophetic vision and be a close and
sympathetic student of human nature. He obviously wanted to know what
had brought me there. So I told him that I was having a holiday, and
had spent most of the day at Much Rising.</p>

<p>'A queer place by all accounts,' was his comment, but as it was not
on his ground, he had never been there. The town in which we were was
the limit of his beat.</p>

<p>I went to bed early, but did not sleep very well. I woke up several
times during the night, with an uncomfortable feeling that someone (or
something) was moving about the room. Twice I struck a light, but no
intruder was visible. The house was an old one and might well harbour
rats. As long as they kept behind the wainscot they could do me no
harm. With this reflection, which I did not find quite as comforting as
the sterling common sense by which it was inspired ought to have made
it, I went to sleep again.</p>

<p>The next morning was very wet. The landlord assured me that it would
clear about twelve o'clock. So I thought I would occupy myself by going
over the rubbings I had made yesterday. They had all come out well:
Codd's surprisingly so. In fact I could make out more than I had seen
when looking at the original. (This does sometimes happen, just as a
photograph of a manuscript, especially of a palimpsest, may be easier
to decipher than the manuscript itself.)</p>

<p>The lettering round the edge was very much broken, but I could read
as follows:</p>

<pre>
... ISA AC ...... NDA MORTE PTVS DIE NOV .... INA CE VERE.
</pre>

<p>This I reconstructed--</p>

<pre>
IMPROVISA AC HORRENDA MORTE ABREPTUS XXIXno DIE NOVEMBRIS SATURNINA LUCE VERE.
</pre>

<p><i>He was snatched away by an unforeseen and dreadful death on 29
November, truly a day of ill-omen</i>. (The year was completely
obliterated. But the rector had told me that it was 1485.)</p>

<p>My restoration of the day of the month was conjectural. But I
remembered that 29 November was the day of St. Saturninus of Toulouse,
who was gored to death by a savage bull during the Decian persecution.
And I thought that the coining of an adjective from his name, more or
less equivalent to our <i>saturnime</i>, was not unlikely. I wondered
what had happened to William Codd. Probably an accident, which, in view
of the suspicions which seem to have been entertained with regard to
him, was no doubt looked upon as a divine judgment.</p>

<p>The conventional prayer CVIS ANIME PPTIETVR DEVS (<i>on whose soul
may God have mercy</i>) was not part of the original lettering of this
brass. It was incised on the stone slab, rather roughly, and obviously
by a later hand. This was out of the common and lent some colour to the
idea that the parish discovered that it had not seen the last of him
when his funeral was over.</p>

<p>'Well,' I said, half to myself and half to the rubbing on the table
before me, 'I wonder what you really were like. Pity there's nothing of
your face to be seen.'</p>

<p>And now comes the most remarkable part of my story. As I spoke some
lines began to appear. At first they were very faint. Gradually they
became definite, as a photographic negative takes shape in the
developing dish. Little by little a face emerged, and it was a face I
knew. I had seen it as lately as yesterday. There could be no mistake.
There were the eyebrows meeting in the middle, and the horn-like tufts
of hair over the ears. I was looking at a portrait of Nicholas
Clenchwarton.</p>

<p>For some reason which I cannot quite explain I did not feel
frightened. Partly perhaps because surprise left no room for any other
emotion; partly perhaps on account of the prosaic nature of my
surroundings. The parlour of an inn in a small country-town about
eleven o'clock in the morning does not provide a convincing
mise-en-sc&egrave;ne for supernatural experiences.</p>

<p>While I watched, a further change took place. The face became less
human; the tufts of hair were now definitely horns and I was looking at
a bull's head on a human body.</p>

<p>'Like the Minotaur,' I said to myself. Certainly the eyes and
forehead suggested more than bovine intelligence. In another minute it
had faded away and the face was a blank again.</p>

<p>Had I been dreaming? No: I knew I had not. I saw what I have just
described as plainly as ever I saw anything in my life. Obviously I
must return to Much Rising as soon as might be and talk matters over
with the Rector. As the landlord's forecast of the weather proved
correct I put this plan into execution shortly after lunch.</p>

<p>I must admit that I began to feel a little nervous as I left the
town. The road was a lonely one and I soon discovered that my companion
of the day before was waiting for me in the ditch. However, I must go
and I did not see how I could come to any harm. Presently, when I was
in sight of the village, the rustle passed me, and about a hundred
yards farther on I thought I saw a small animal of some kind leave the
ditch and go through the hedge into a field. I only got a fleeting
glimpse, and cannot say more of it than that it was of a darkish
colour, and about the size of a rabbit. But a rabbit it was not. Nor
was it an unusually large rat. A short distance farther on there was a
gate into the field. As I came up to it, a man opened it and said,
'This is your way.' I saw that there was a large meadow with a
well-trodden track, quite practicable for a bicycle, running across it.
At the far side it disappeared into some bushes and just beyond them I
could see the chimneys of the Rectory. It was part of the general
oddness of the day that I felt no surprise at the fact that the man
knew where I was going, any more than, I think, one is ever surprised
in a dream. I thanked him, turned through the gate, and began to ride
across the field. I only saw him for a moment, and afterwards could not
recall him with any clearness. He had a broad-brimmed hat, so that I
never really saw his face, and was wearing a long light-coloured
garment; at the moment I took it for the smock-frock which was
sometimes to be seen on old labourers then. On subsequent reflection, I
doubt whether this theory was correct. That was as much as I could say,
when I came to tell my story to the Rector, and he could not identify
my description with that of anyone in the parish. Later, I seemed to
remember that the man's voice had been curiously hoarse, as if from
long disuse.</p>

<p>When I was about half-way across the field, I heard a noise behind
me. I looked over my shoulder and saw a large black bull coming after
me; obviously not with any friendly intention. Flight was my only
chance, and the shrubbery or plantation, or whatever it might be, for
which I was heading might aid my escape. I rode for all I was worth,
but the path was narrow and rough, and I judged that the beast was
gaining on me. As I entered the plantation, I saw what looked like a
small disused quarry straight in front of me. There was only one
chance, and that seemed a poor one. I wrenched my front wheel sideways
and rolled over amongst the bushes. As I fell I heard a bellow and a
crash. I picked myself up thankful to be still alive. The bull was
nowhere to be seen. I presumed that he had gone into the quarry, and
was well content to leave him there. I ran as best I could,
staggeringly, blindly, through the bushes, and found myself at the gate
leading into the Rectory garden. I opened it (thank goodness it was not
locked) and ran on a few steps. Then I must have fainted, as the next
thing I knew I was in a basket-chair on the lawn with a taste of brandy
in my mouth and the Rector and Mrs. Foster beside me.</p>

<p>His first remark was very kind and wise. Don't try to tell us what
has happened until you feel like it.'</p>

<p>But, like many people when they have been badly frightened, but not
seriously hurt, I suddenly felt very angry.</p>

<p>'I call it disgraceful,' I said, 'to have a savage bull at large in
that field. And that unfenced quarry, or whatever it is in the
plantation, is an absolute death-trap.'</p>

<p>'Bull? Quarry? What are you talking about? All that land belongs to
me, it's part of the glebe, always has been. The field is called
Bull-Yard; I suspect that goes back to the days when it was part of a
Rector's duty to provide a bull and a boar for the parish (did you know
that, by the way?). But I don't suppose there has been a bull there for
years. Certainly not since I've been here. And there's no quarry in the
plantation. How should there be? There's a small depression where water
collects in winter. It might be nearly up to your knees at times. But
of course it's as dry as a bone now. You could have ridden your bicycle
straight across it. I suppose there might have been more of it once.
There are a number of small quarries in these parts, and some of them
are still worked. But if that was one of them it was filled in, perhaps
by nature, long ago.'</p>

<p>During this speech I became more reasonable. I apologized and said,
'Well, will you come and see?'</p>

<p>He would, and we went, and found it as he had said. The only part of
my story which seemed to have a word of truth in it was that I had
fallen off my bicycle into the bushes. At any rate the bicycle was
there, not much the worse, I am glad to say, and my cap and some broken
twigs. There was no pit or quarry and no trace of any bull.</p>

<p>'But didn't you hear him bellow?' I asked.</p>

<p>'I thought I heard some distant thunder. But it must have been
several miles away,' was the reply.</p>

<p>Wild as my story must have sounded, the Rector did not upbraid me or
laugh at me. He looked thoughtful and then said, 'I expect you'll have
something more to tell me presently,' and led me back into the garden.
We met Mrs. Foster coming from the house and she very kindly asked me
to stay the night. 'You've had a shock of some sort,' she said, 'you
really aren't fit to go. My husband can lend you all you want for the
night, or you can have some of Gerald's things.' (Gerald, I learned
afterwards, was a soldier son, who naturally left most of his
belongings behind him when with his regiment.)</p>

<p>I made some feeble protest, but they both brushed it aside. 'In fact
you must stop,' she went on. 'I have sent a telegram' (telephones
hardly were in the country then) 'to the <i>Woolpack</i>--you told me
yesterday you were there, and of course I know the people quite
well--telling them not to expect you before lunch to-morrow.'</p>

<p>That settled it. I was really grateful to her, as I hardly felt up
to bicycling back alone, even less with such company as I might have.
At her suggestion I went and lay down on the bed in the room I was to
have. I fell asleep and when I was roused about seven o'clock felt much
better. After dinner I told the whole story, very much as I have set it
out here.</p>

<p>As soon as I had finished, Mrs. Foster exclaimed triumphantly to her
husband, There, what did I always tell you? You simply must get rid of
that horrible man now.'</p>

<p>'You never told me that there was any connection between him and
William Codd,' replied the Rector, not unreasonably, 'and if you had, I
doubt whether I should have believed it. But even now, I don't see that
I can dismiss him. What reason could I give? What could I say to
him?'</p>

<p>'Say?--why need you say anything?'</p>

<p>And in fact, as you will hear, the necessity did not arise.</p>

<p>On one point we were agreed. The sooner my rubbing of the brass was
destroyed, the better. So we went to the weed-heap in the
kitchen-garden, deposited the paper there and applied a match. The
flame ran round the edge of the figure in an odd way, and at one moment
the blank face was surrounded by a ring of fire. However, it was all
over soon, and a puff of wind dispersed the ashes. 'And that's that,'
said the Rector as we walked back to the house.</p>

<p>I slept more soundly than I had done at the <i>Woolpack</i> the
night before, though once or twice I thought the owls seemed to be
unusually noisy.</p>

<p>We were finishing breakfast next morning, when the parlourmaid came
in and said that the policeman had called and was wishful to see the
Rector.</p>

<p>'Sorry to disturb you, Sir,' he said as soon as he had been shown
in. 'But would you please come down the village? I think there's summat
wrong to Clenchwarton's.'</p>

<p>As we went, he told us that no one could recall having seen him
since dinner-time the day before. The woman who did for him had gone as
usual in the morning, but had been unable to get in. No knocking or
calling could elicit any response.</p>

<p>His cottage stood by itself, between the end of the village street
and the churchyard. When we arrived, a few people had collected and
were standing about. The Rector, who was a magistrate, directed that
the door should be forced. This was done without much difficulty. The
cottage was of the ordinary four-roomed type, living-room and kitchen
on the ground floor and two bedrooms above. It was clean, but smelt
curiously earthy. We found ourselves in the living-room. At the far
corner a steep and narrow staircase gave access to the upper floor.
Clenchwarton was lying at the bottom in an attitude which showed
plainly enough that he was dead. In view of the narrowness of the
staircase, it was thought better not to try to carry him up. The body
was laid on an old sofa in the living-room and covered with a
counterpane brought down from the bedroom. While this was being done, a
certain amount of murmured conversation went on, and I caught 'Saved
Jack Ketch a job, I reckon,' from one of the men. This appeared to be
the general sense of the meeting.</p>

<p>When the doctor came, he certified that there was a clean fracture
between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae. Death must have been
instantaneous, and had taken place more than twelve hours previously.
Clenchwarton had obviously been killed by falling down the stairs.
Whether he had had any kind of fit which had caused him to fall could
not be determined without a post-mortem, and as there was no suspicion
of foul play it hardly seemed worth while to hold one.</p>

<p>I returned to the <i>Woolpack</i> that afternoon, and went home the
next day. I did not feel inclined to rub any more brasses just then;
especially in that neighbourhood. Afterwards other occupations and
interests supervened, so my collection has remained as incomplete as
many others.</p>

<p>The verdict of the coroner's jury was of course 'Death by
Misadventure' and the body was interred in the churchyard on the south
side of the church.</p>

<p>No relations could be discovered. He had owned some house-property
somewhere in the west of England. But as he had made no will, and the
solicitors who managed it for him and remitted his rents knew no more
about him than anybody else, I suppose it passed to the Crown.</p>

<p>The Rector paid the funeral expenses out of his own pocket, and had
the words REQUIESCAT IN PACE inscribed on the tombstone. Some people in
the village were inclined to object when the meaning was explained to
them, on the ground that the sentiment was popish. But the general
opinion was in favour of them. As far as our knowledge extends, they
seem to have been efficacious.</p>

<p>It is easy to frame a number of questions in connection with the
episode. But I have never been able to arrive at a satisfactory answer
to any of them.</p>
