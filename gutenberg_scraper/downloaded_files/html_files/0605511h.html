<h1>The Problem of Dead Wood Hall</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Dick Donovan</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>"MYSTERIOUS CASE IN CHESHIRE." So ran the heading to a paragraph
in all the morning papers some years ago, and prominence was given to
the following particulars:</p>

<p>A gentleman, bearing the somewhat curious name of Tuscan Trankler,
resided in a picturesque old mansion, known as Dead Wood Hall,
situated in one of the most beautiful and lonely parts of Cheshire,
not very far from the quaint and old-time village of Knutsford. Mr.
Trankler had given a dinner-party at his house, and amongst the
guests was a very well-known county magistrate and landowner, Mr.
Manville Charnworth. It appeared that, soon after the ladies had
retired from the table, Mr. Charnworth rose and went into the
grounds, saying he wanted a little air. He was smoking a cigar, and
in the enjoyment of perfect health. He had drunk wine, however,
rather freely, as was his wont, but though on exceedingly good terms
with himself and every one else, he was perfectly sober. An hour
passed, but Mr. Charnworth had not returned to the table. Though this
did not arouse any alarm, as it was thought that he had probably
joined the ladies, for he was what is called "a ladies' man," and
preferred the company of females to that of men. A tremendous
sensation, however, was caused when, a little later, it was announced
that Charnworth had been found insensible, lying on his back in a
shrubbery. Medical assistance was at once summoned, and when it
arrived the opinion expressed was that the unfortunate gentleman had
been stricken with apoplexy. For some reason or other, however, the
doctors were led to modify that view, for symptoms were observed
which pointed to what was thought to be a peculiar form of poisoning,
although the poison could not be determined. After a time, Charnworth
recovered consciousness, but was quite unable to give any
information. He seemed to be dazed and confused, and was evidently
suffering great pain. At last his limbs began to swell, and swelled
to an enormous size; his eyes sunk, his cheeks fell in, his lips
turned black, and mortification appeared in the extremities.
Everything that could be done for the unfortunate man was done, but
without avail. After six hours' suffering, he died in a paroxysm of
raving madness, during which he had to be held down in the bed by
several strong men.</p>

<p>The post-mortem examination, which was necessarily held, revealed
the curious fact that the blood in the body had become thin and
purplish, with a faint strange odour that could not be identified.
All the organs were extremely congested, and the flesh presented
every appearance of rapid decomposition. In fact, twelve hours after
death putrefaction had taken place. The medical gentlemen who had the
case in hand were greatly puzzled, and were at a loss to determine
the precise cause of death. The deceased had been a very healthy man,
and there was no actual organic disease of any kind. In short,
everything pointed to poisoning. It was noted that on the left side
of the neck was a tiny scratch, with a slightly livid appearance,
such as might have been made by a small sharply pointed instrument.
The viscera having been secured for purposes of analysis, the body
was hurriedly, buried within thirty hours of death.</p>

<p>The result of the analysis was to make clear that the unfortunate
gentleman had died through some very powerful and irritant poison
being introduced into the blood. That it was a case of
blood-poisoning there was hardly room for the shadow of a doubt, but
the science of that day was quite unable to say what the poison was,
or how it had got into the body. There was no reason--so far as could
be ascertained to suspect foul play, and even less reason to suspect
suicide. Altogether, therefore, the case was one of profound mystery,
and the coroner's jury were compelled to return an open verdict. Such
were the details that were made public at the time of Mr.
Charnworth's death; and from the social position of all the parties,
the affair was something more than a nine days' wonder; while in
Cheshire itself, it created a profound sensation. But, as no further
information was forthcoming, the matter ceased to interest the
outside world, and so, as far as the public were concerned, it was
relegated to the limbo of forgotten things.</p>

<p>Two years later, Mr. Ferdinand Trankler, eldest son of Tuscan
Trankler, accompanied a large party of friends for a day's shooting
in Mere Forest. He was a young man, about five and twenty years of
age; was in the most perfect health, and had scarcely ever had a
day's illness in his life. Deservedly popular and beloved, he had a
large circle of warm friends, and was about to be married to a
charming young lady, a member of an old Cheshire family who were
extensive landed proprietors and property owners. His prospects
therefore seemed to be unclouded, and his happiness complete.</p>

<p>The shooting-party was divided into three sections, each agreeing
to shoot over a different part of the forest, and to meet in the
afternoon for refreshments at an appointed rendezvous.</p>

<p>Young Trankler and his companions kept pretty well together for
some little time, but ultimately began to spread about a good deal At
the appointed hour the friends all met, with the exception of
Trankler. He was not there. His absence did not cause any alarm, as
it was thought he would soon turn up. He was known to be well
acquainted with the forest, and the supposition was he had strayed
further afield than the rest. By the time the repast was finished,
however, he had not put in an appearance. Then, for the first time,
the company began to feel some uneasiness, and vague hints that
possibly an accident had happened were thrown out. Hints at last took
the form of definite expressions of alarm, and search parties were at
once organized to go in search of the absent young man, for only on
the hypothesis of some untoward event could his prolonged absence be
accounted for, inasmuch as it was not deemed in the least likely that
he would show such a lack of courtesy as to go off and leave his
friends without a word of explanation. For two hours the search was
kept up without any result. Darkness was then closing in, and the now
painfully anxious searchers' began to feel that they would have to
desist until daylight; returned. But at last some of the more
energetic and active, members of the party came upon Trankler lying
on his sides and nearly entirely hidden by masses of half withered
bracken. He was lying near a little stream that meandered through the
forest, and near a keeper's shelter that was constructed with logs
and thatched with pine boughs. He was stone dead, and his appearance
caused his friends to shrink back with horror, for he was not only
black in the face, but his body was bloated, and his limbs seemed
swollen to twice their natural size.</p>

<p>Amongst the party were two medical men, who, being hastily
summoned, proceeded at once to make an examination. They expressed an
opinion that the young man had been dead for some time, but they
could not account for his death, as there was no wound to be
observed. As a matter of fact, his gun was lying near him with both
barrels loaded. Moreover, his appearance was not compatible at all
with death from a gun-shot wound. How then had he died? The
consternation amongst those who had known him can well be imagined,
and with a sense of suppressed horror, it was whispered that the
strange condition of the dead man coincided with that of Mr. Manville
Charnworth, the county magistrate who had died so mysteriously two
years previously.</p>

<p>As soon as it was possible to do so, Ferdinand Trankler's body was
removed to Dead Wood Hall, and his people were stricken with profound
grief when they realized that the hope and joy of their house was
dead. Of course an autopsy had to be performed, owing to the
ignorance of the medical men as to the cause of death. And this
post-mortem examination disclosed the fact that all the extraordinary
appearances which had been noticed in Mr. Charnworth's case were
present in this one. There was the same purplish coloured blood; the
same gangrenous condition of the limbs; but as with Charnworth, so
with Trankler, all the organs were healthy. There was no organic
disease to account for death. As it was pretty certain, therefore,
that death was not due to natural causes, a coroner's inquest was
held, and while the medical evidence made it unmistakably clear that
young Trankler had been cut down in the flower of his youth and while
he was in radiant health by some powerful and potent means which had
suddenly destroyed his life, no one had the boldness to suggest what
those means were, beyond saying that blood-poisoning of a most
violent character had been set up. Now, it was very obvious that
blood-poisoning could not have originated without some specific
cause, and the most patient investigation was directed to trying to
find out the cause, while exhaustive inquiries were made, but at the
end of them, the solution of the mystery was as far off as ever, for
these investigations had been in the wrong channel, not one scrap of
evidence was brought forward which would have justified a definite
statement that this or that had been responsible for the young man's
death.</p>

<p>It was remembered that when the post-mortem examination of Mr.
Charnworth took place, a tiny bluish scratch was observed on the left
side of the neck. But it was so small, and apparently so unimportant
that it was not taken into consideration when attempts were made to
solve the problem of "How did the man die?" When the doctors examined
Mr. Trankler's body, they looked to see if there was a similar
puncture or scratch, and, to their astonishment, they did find rather
a curious mark on the left side of the neck, just under the ear. It
was a slight abrasion of the skin, about an inch long as if he had
been scratched with a pin, and this abrasion was a faint blue,
approximating in colour to the tattoo marks on a sailor's arm. The
similarity in this scratch to that which had been observed on Mr.
Charnworth's body, necessarily gave rise to a good deal of comment
amongst the doctors, though they could not arrive at any definite
conclusion respecting it. One man went so far as to express an
opinion that it was due to an insect or the bite of a snake. But this
theory found no supporters, for it was argued that the similar wound
on Mr. Charnworth could hardly have resulted from an insect or snake
bite, for he had died in his friend's garden. Besides, there was no
insect or snake in England capable of killing a man as these two men
had been killed. That theory, therefore, fell to the ground; and
medical science as represented by the local gentlemen, had to confess
itself baffled; while the coroner's jury were forced to again return
an open verdict.</p>

<p>"There was no evidence to prove how the deceased had come by his
death."</p>

<p>This verdict was considered highly unsatisfactory, but what other
could have been returned. There was nothing to support the theory of
foul play; on the other hand, no evidence was forthcoming to explain
away the mystery which surrounded the deaths of Charnworth and
Trankler. The two men had apparently died from precisely the same
cause, and under circumstances which were as mysterious as they were
startling, but what the cause was, no one seemed able to
determine.</p>

<p>Universal sympathy was felt with the friends and relatives of
young Trankler, who had perished so unaccountably while in pursuit of
pleasure. Had he been taken suddenly ill at home and had died in his
bed, even though the same symptoms and morbid appearances had
manifested themselves, the mystery would not have been so great. But
as Charnworth's end came in his host's garden after a dinner-party,
so young Trankler died in a forest while he and his friends were
engaged in shooting. There was certainly something truly remarkable
that two men, exhibiting all the same post-mortem effects, should
have died in such a way; their deaths, in point of time, being
separated by a period of two years. On the face of it, it seemed
impossible that it could be merely a coincidence. It will be gathered
from the foregoing, that in this double tragedy were all the elements
of a romance well calculated to stimulate public curiosity to the
highest pitch; while the friends and relatives of the two deceased
gentlemen were of opinion that the matter ought not to be allowed to
drop with the return of the verdict of the coroner's jury. An
investigation seemed to be urgently called for. Of course, an
investigation of a kind had taken place by the local police, but
something more than that was required, so thought the friends. And an
application was made to me to go down to Dead Wood Hall; and bring
such skill as I possessed to bear on the case, in the hope that the
veil of mystery might be drawn aside, and light let in where all was
then dark.</p>

<p>Dead Wood Hall was a curious place, with a certain gloominess of
aspect which seemed to suggest that it was a fitting scene for a
tragedy. It was a large, massive house, heavily timbered in front in
a way peculiar to many of the old Cheshire mansions. It stood in
extensive grounds, and being situated on a rise commanded a very fine
panoramic view which embraced the Derbyshire Hills. How it got its
name of Dead Wood Hall no one seemed to know exactly. There was a
tradition that it had originally been known as Dark Wood Hall; but
the word "Dark" had been corrupted into "Dead". The Tranklers came
into possession of the property by purchase, and the family had been
the owners of it for something like thirty years.</p>

<p>With great circumstantiality I was told the story of the death of
each man, together with the results of the post mortem examination,
and the steps that had been taken by the police. On further inquiry I
found that the police, in spite of the mystery surrounding the case,
were firmly of opinion that the deaths of the two men were, after
all, due to natural causes, and that the similarity in the appearance
of the bodies after death was a mere coincidence. The superintendent
of the county constabulary, who had had charge of the matter, waxed
rather warm; for he said that all sorts of ridiculous stories had
been set afloat, and absurd theories had been suggested, not one of
which would have done credit to the intelligence of an average
schoolboy.</p>

<p>"People lose their heads so, and make such fools of themselves in
matters of this kind," he said warmly; "and of course the police are
accused of being stupid, ignorant, and all the rest of it. They seem,
in fact, to have a notion that we are endowed with superhuman
faculties, and that nothing should baffle us. But, as a matter of
fact, it is the doctors who are at fault in this instance. They are
confronted with a new disease, about which they are ignorant; and, in
order to conceal their want of knowledge, they at once raise the cry
of 'foul play'."</p>

<p>"Then you are clearly of opinion that Mr. Charnworth and Mr.
Trankler died of a disease," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly I am."</p>

<p>"Then how do you explain the rapidity of the death in each case,
and the similarity in the appearance of the dead bodies?"</p>

<p>"It isn't for me to explain that at all. That is doctors' work not
police work. If the doctors can't explain it, how can I be expected
to do so? I only know this, I've put some of my best men on to the
job, and they've failed to find anything that would suggest foul
play."</p>

<p>"And that convinces you absolutely that there has been no foul
play?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"I suppose you were personally acquainted with both gentlemen?
What sort of man was Mr. Charnworth?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, he was right enough, as such men go. He made a good
many blunders as a magistrate; but all magistrates do that. You see,
fellows get put on the bench who are no more fit to be magistrates
than you are, sir. It's a matter of influence more often as not. Mr.
Charnworth was no worse and no better than a lot of others I could
name."</p>

<p>"What opinion did you form of his private character?"</p>

<p>"Ah, now, there, there's another matter," answered the
superintendent, in a confidential tone, and with a smile playing
about his lips. "You see, Mr. Charnworth was a bachelor."</p>

<p>"So are thousands of other men," I answered. "But bachelorhood is
not considered dishonourable in this country."</p>

<p>"No, perhaps not. But they say as how the reason was that Mr.
Charnworth didn't get married was because he didn't care for having
only one wife."</p>

<p>"You mean he was fond of ladies generally. A sort of general
lover."</p>

<p>"I should think he was," said the superintendent, with a twinkle
in his eye, which was meant to convey a good deal of meaning. "I've
heard some queer stories about him."</p>

<p>"What is the nature of the stories?" I asked, thinking that I
might get something to guide me.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I don't attach much importance to them myself," he
said, half-apologetically; "but the fact is, there was some social
scandal talked about Mr. Charnworth."</p>

<p>"What was the nature of the scandal?"</p>

<p>"Mind you," urged the superintendent, evidently anxious to be
freed from any responsibility for the scandal whatever it was, "I
only tell you the story as I heard it. Mr. Charnworth liked his
little flirtations, no doubt, as we all do; but he was a gentleman
and a magistrate, and I have no right to say anything against him
that I know nothing about myself."</p>

<p>"While a gentleman may be a magistrate, a magistrate is not always
a gentleman," I remarked.</p>

<p>"True, true; but Mr. Charnworth was. He was a fine specimen of a
gentleman, and was very liberal. He did me many kindnesses."</p>

<p>"Therefore, in your sight, at least, sir, he was without
blemish."</p>

<p>"I don't go as far as that," replied the superintendent, a little
warmly; "I only want to be just."</p>

<p>"I give you full credit for that," I answered; "but please do tell
me about the scandal you spoke of. It is just possible it may afford
me a clue."</p>

<p>"I don't think that it will. However, here is the story. A young
lady lived in Knutsford by the name of Downie. She is the daughter of
the late George Downie, who for many years carried on the business of
a miller. Hester Downie was said to be one of the prettiest girls in
Cheshire, or, at any rate, in this part of Cheshire, and rumour has
it that she flirted with both Charnworth and Trankler."</p>

<p>"Is that all that rumour says?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, there was a good deal more said. But, as I have told you, I
know nothing for certain, and so must decline to commit myself to any
statement for which there could be no better foundation than common
gossip."</p>

<p>"Does Miss Downie still live in Knutsford?"</p>

<p>"No; she disappeared mysteriously soon after Charnworth's
death."</p>

<p>"And you don't know where she is?"</p>

<p>"No; I have no idea."</p>

<p>As I did not see that there was much more to be gained from the
superintendent I left him, and at once sought a interview with the
leading medical man who had made the autopsy of the two bodies. He
was a man who was somewhat puffed up with the belief in his own
cleverness, but he gave me the impression that, if anything, he was a
little below the average country practitioner. He hadn't a single
theory to advance to account for the deaths of Charnworth and
Trankler. He confessed that he was mystified; that all the
appearances were entirely new to him, for neither in his reading nor
his practice had he ever heard of a similar case.</p>

<p>"Are you disposed to think, sir, that these two men came to their
end by foul play?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, I am not," he answered definitely, "and I said so at the
inquest. Foul play means murder, cool and deliberate; and planned and
carried out with fiendish cunning. Besides, if it was murder how was
the murder committed?"</p>

<p>"If it was murder?" I asked significantly. "I shall hope to answer
that question later on."</p>

<p>"But I am convinced it wasn't murder," returned the doctor, with a
self-confident air. "If a man is shot, or bludgeoned, or poisoned,
there is something to go upon. I scarcely know of a poison that
cannot be detected. And not a trace of poison was found in the organs
of either man. Science has made tremendous strides of late years, and
I doubt if she has much more to teach us in that respect. Anyway, I
assert without fear of contradiction that Charnworth and Trankler did
not die of poison."</p>

<p>"What killed them, then?" I asked, bluntly and sharply.</p>

<p>The doctor did not like the question, and there was a roughness in
his tone as he answered---</p>

<p>"I'm not prepared to say. If I could have assigned a precise cause
of death the coroner's verdict would have been different."</p>

<p>"Then you admit that the whole affair is a problem which you are
incapable of solving?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, I do," he answered, after a pause. "There are certain
peculiarities in the case that I should like to see cleared up. In
fact, in the interests of my profession, I think it is most desirable
that the mystery surrounding the death of the unfortunate men should
be solved. And I have been trying experiments recently with a view to
attaining that end, though without success."</p>

<p>My interview with this gentleman had not advanced matters, for it
only served to show me that the doctors were quite baffled, and I
confess that that did not altogether encourage me. Where they had
failed, how could I hope to succeed? They had the advantage of seeing
the bodies and examining them, and though they found themselves
confronted with signs which were in themselves significant, they
could not read them. All that I had to go upon was hearsay, and I was
asked to solve a mystery which seemed unsolvable. But, as I have so
often stated in the course of my chronicles, the seemingly impossible
is frequently the most easy to accomplish, where a mind specially
trained to deal with complex problems is brought to bear upon it.</p>

<p>In interviewing Mr. Tuscan Trankler, I found that he entertained a
very decided opinion that there had been foul play, though he
admitted that it was difficult in the extreme to suggest even a vague
notion of how the deed had been accomplished. If the two men had died
together or within a short period of each other, the idea of murder
would have seemed more logical. But two years had elapsed, and yet
each man had evidently died from precisely same cause. Therefore, if
it was murder, the same hand that had slain Mr. Charnworth slew Mr.
Trankler. There was no getting away from that; and then of course
arose the question of motive. Granted that the same hand did the
deed, did the same motive prompt in each case? Another aspect of the
affair that presented itself to me was that the crime, if crime it
was, was not the work of any ordinary person. There was an
originality of conception in it which pointed to the criminal being,
in certain respects, a genius. And, moreover, the motive underlying
it must have been a very powerful one; possibly, nay probably, due to
a sense of some terrible wrong inflicted, and which could only be
wiped out with death of the wronger. But this presupposed that each
man, though unrelated, had perpetrated the same wrong. Now, it was
within the grasp of intelligent reasoning that Charnworth, in his
capacity of a county justice, might have given mortal offence to
someone, who, cherishing the memory of it, until a mania had been set
up, resolved that the magistrate should die. That theory was
reasonable when taken singly, but it seemed to lose its
reasonableness when connected with young Trankler, unless it was that
he had been instrumental in getting somebody convicted. To determine
this I made very pointed inquiries, but received the most positive
assurances that never in the whole course of his life had he directly
or indirectly been instrumental in prosecuting any one. Therefore, so
far as he was concerned, the theory fell to the ground; and if the
same person killed both men, the motive prompting in each case was a
different one, assuming that Charnworth's death resulted from revenge
for a fancied wrong inflicted in the course of his administration of
justice.</p>

<p>Although I fully recognized all the difficulties that lay in the
way of a rational deduction that would square in with the theory of
murder, and of murder committed by one any the same hand, I saw how
necessary it was to keep in view the points I have advanced as
factors in the problem that had to be worked out, and I adhered to my
first impression, and felt tolerably certain that, granted the men
had been murdered, they were murdered by the same hand. It may be
said that this deduction required no great mental effort. I admit
that that is so; but it is strange that nearly all the people in the
district were opposed to the theory. Mr. Tuscan Trankler spoke very
highly of Charnworth. He believed him to be an upright, conscientious
man, liberal to a fault with his means, and in his position of
magistrate erring on the side of mercy. In his private character he
was a bon vivant; fond of a good dinner, good wine, and good company.
He was much in request at dinner-parties and other social gatherings,
for he was accounted a brilliant raconteur, possessed of an endless
fund of racy jokes and anecdotes. I have already stated that with
ladies he was an especial favourite, for he had a singularly suave,
winning way, which with most women was irresistible. In age he was
more than double that of young Trankler, who was only five and twenty
at the time of his death, whereas Charnworth had turned sixty, though
I was given to understand that he was a well-preserved, good-looking
man, and apparently younger than he really was.</p>

<p>Coming to young Trankler, there was a consensus of opinion that he
was an exemplary young man. He had been partly educated at home and
partly at the Manchester Grammar School; and, though he had shown a
decided talent for engineering, he had not gone in for it seriously,
but had dabbled in it as an amateur, for he had ample means and good
prospects, and it was his father's desire that he should lead the
life of a country gentleman, devote himself to country pursuits, and
to improving and keeping together the family estates. To the lady who
was to have become his bride, he had been engaged but six months, and
had only known her a year. His premature and mysterious death had
caused intense grief in both families; and his intended wife had been
so seriously affected that her friends had been compelled to take her
abroad.</p>

<p>With these facts and particulars before me, I had to set to work
and try to solve the problem which was considered unsolvable by most
of the people who knew anything about it. But may I be pardoned for
saying very positively that, even at this point, I did not consider
it so. Its complexity could not be gainsaid; nevertheless, I felt
that there were ways and means of arriving at a solution, and I set
to work in my own fashion. Firstly, I started on the assumption that
both men had been deliberately murdered by the same person. If that
was not so, then they had died of some remarkable and unknown disease
which had stricken them down under a set of conditions that were
closely allied, and the coincidence in that case would be one of the
most astounding the world had ever known. Now, if that was correct, a
pathological conundrum was propounded which, it was for the medical
world to answer, and practically I was placed out of the running, to
use a sporting phrase. I found that, with few exceptions--the
exceptions being Mr. Trankler and his friends--there was an
undisguised opinion that what the united local wisdom and skill had
failed to accomplish, could not be accomplished by a stranger. As my
experience, however, had inured me against that sort of thing, it did
not affect me. Local prejudices and jealousies have always to be
reckoned with, and it does not do to be thin-skinned. I worked upon
my own lines, thought with my own thoughts, and, as an expert in the
art of reading human nature, I reasoned from a different set of
premises to that employed by the irresponsible chatterers, who cry
out "Impossible," as soon as the first difficulty presents itself.
Marshalling all the facts of the case so far as I had been able to
gather them, I arrived at the conclusion that the problem could be
solved, and, as a preliminary step to that end, I started off to
London, much to the astonishment of those who had secured my
services. But my reply to the many queries addressed to me was, "I
hope to find the key-note to the solution in the metropolis." This
reply only increased the astonishment, but later on I will explain
why I took the step, which may seem to the reader rather an
extraordinary one.</p>

<p>After an absence of five days I returned to Cheshire, and I was
then in a position to say, "Unless a miracle has happened, Charnworth
and Trankler were murdered beyond all doubt, and murdered by the same
person in such a cunning, novel and devilish manner, that even the
most astute inquirer might have been pardoned for being baffled." Of
course there was a strong desire to know my reasons for the positive
statement, but I felt that it was in the interests of justice itself
that I should not allow them to be known at that stage of the
proceedings.</p>

<p>The next important step was to try and find out what had become of
Miss Downie, the Knutsford beauty, with whom Charnworth was said to
have carried on a flirtation. Here, again, I considered secrecy of
great importance.</p>

<p>Hester Downie was about seven and twenty years of age. She was an
orphan, and was believed to have been born in Macclesfield, as her
parents came from there. Her father's calling was that of a miller.
He had settled in Knutsford about fifteen years previous to the
period I am dealing with, and had been dead about five years. Not
very much was known about the family, but it was thought there were
other children living. No very kindly feeling was shown for Hester
Downie, though it was only too obvious that jealousy was at the
bottom of it. Half the young men, it seemed, had lost their heads
about her, and all the girls in the village were consumed with envy
and jealousy. It was said she was "stuck up," "above her position,"
"a heartless flirt," and so forth. From those competent to speak,
however, she was regarded as a nice young woman, and admittedly
good-looking. For years she had lived with an old aunt, who bore the
reputation of being rather a sullen sort of woman, and somewhat
eccentric. The girl had a little over fifty pounds a year to live
upon, derived from a small property left to her by her father; and
she and her aunt occupied a cottage just on the outskirts of
Knutsford. Hester was considered to be very exclusive, and did not
associate much with the people in Knutsford. This was sufficient to
account for the local bias, and as she often went away from her home
for three and four weeks at a time, it was not considered
extraordinary when it was known that she had left soon after
Trankler's death. Nobody, however, knew where she had gone to; it is
right, perhaps, that I should here state that not a soul breathed a
syllable of suspicion against her, that either directly or indirectly
she could be connected with the deaths of Charnworth or Trankler. The
aunt, a widow by the name of Hislop, could not be described as a
pleasant or genial woman, either in appearance or manner. I was
anxious to ascertain for certain whether there was any truth in the
rumour or not that Miss Downie had flirted with Mr. Charnworth. If it
was true that she did, a clue might be afforded which would lead to
the ultimate unravelling of the mystery. I had to approach Mrs.
Hislop with a good deal of circumspection, for she showed an
inclination to resent any inquiries being made into her family
matters. She gave me the impression that she was an honest woman, and
it was very apparent that she was strongly attached to her niece
Hester. Trading on this fact, I managed to draw her out. I said that
people in the district were beginning to say unkind things about
Hester, and that it would be better for the girl's sake that there
should be no mystery associated with her or her movements.</p>

<p>The old lady fired up at this, and declared that she didn't care a
jot about what the "common people" said. Her niece was superior to
all of them, and she would "have the law on any one who spoke ill of
Hester."</p>

<p>"But there is one thing, Mrs. Hislop," I replied, "that ought to
be set at rest. It is rumoured--in fact, something more than
rumoured--that your niece and the late Mr. Charnworth were on terms
of intimacy, which, to say the least, if it is true, was imprudent
for a girl in her position."</p>

<p>"Them what told you that," exclaimed the old woman, "is like the
adders the woodmen get in Delamere forest: they're full of poison.
Mr. Charnworth courted the girl fair and square, and led her to
believe he would marry her. But, of course, he had to do the thing in
secret. Some folk will talk so, and if it had been known that a
gentleman like Mr. Charnworth was coming after a girl in Hester's
position, all sorts of things would have been said."</p>

<p>"Did she believe that he was serious in his intentions towards
her?"</p>

<p>"Of course she did."</p>

<p>"Why was the match broken off?"</p>

<p>"Because he died."</p>

<p>"Then do you mean to tell me seriously, Mrs. Hislop, that Mr.
Charnworth, had he lived, would have married your niece?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe he would."</p>

<p>"Was he the only lover the girl had?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear no. She used to carry on with a man named Job Panton.
But, though they were engaged to be married, she didn't like him
much, and threw him up for Mr. Charnworth."</p>

<p>"Did she ever flirt with young Mr. Trankler?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about flirting; but he called here now and again,
and made her some presents. You see, Hester is a superior sort of
girl, and I don't wonder at gentlefolk liking her."</p>

<p>"Just so," I replied; "beauty attracts peasant and lord alike. But
you will understand that it is to Hester's interest that there should
be no concealment--no mystery; and I advise that she return here, for
her very presence would tend to silence the tongue of scandal. By the
way, where is she?"</p>

<p>"She's staying in Manchester with a relative, a cousin of hers,
named Jessie Turner."</p>

<p>"Is Jessie Turner a married woman?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes: well, that is, she has been married; but she's a widow
now, and has two little children. She is very fond of Hester, who
often goes to her."</p>

<p>Having obtained Jessie Turner's address in Manchester, I left Mrs.
Hislop, feeling somehow as if I had got the key of the problem, and a
day or two later I called on Mrs. Jessie Turner, who resided in a
small house, situated in Tamworth Street, Hulme, Manchester.</p>

<p>She was a young woman, not more than thirty years of age, somewhat
coarse, and vulgar-looking in appearance, and with an unpleasant,
self-assertive manner. There was a great contrast between her and her
cousin, Hester Downie, who was a remarkably attractive and pretty
girl, with quite a classical figure, and a childish, winning way, but
a painful want of education which made itself very manifest when she
spoke; and a harsh, unmusical voice detracted a good deal from her
winsomeness, while in everything she did, and almost everything she
said, she revealed that vanity was her besetting sin.</p>

<p>I formed my estimate at once of this young woman indeed, of both
of them. Hester seemed to me to be shallow, vain, thoughtless, giddy;
and her companion, artful, cunning, and heartless.</p>

<p>"I want you, Miss Downie," I began, "to tell me truthfully the
story of your connection, firstly, with Job Panton; secondly, with
Mr. Charnworth; thirdly, with Mr. Trankler."</p>

<p>This request caused the girl to fall into a condition of amazement
and confusion, for I had not stated what the nature of my business
was, and, of course, she was unprepared for the question.</p>

<p>"What should I tell you my business for?" she cried snappishly,
and growing very red in the face.</p>

<p>"You are aware," I remarked, "that both Mr. Charnworth and Mr.
Trankler are dead?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea how they came by their death?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest."</p>

<p>"Will you be surprised to hear that some very hard things are
being said about you?"</p>

<p>"About me!" she exclaimed, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why about me?"</p>

<p>"Well, your disappearance from your home, for one thing."</p>

<p>She threw up her hands and uttered a cry of distress and horror,
while sudden paleness took the place of the red flush that had dyed
her cheeks. Then she burst into almost hysterical weeping, and sobbed
out:</p>

<p>"I declare it's awful. To think that I cannot do anything or go
away when I like without all the old cats in the place trying to
blacken my character! It's a pity that people won't mind their own
business, and not go out of the way to talk about that which doesn't
concern them."</p>

<p>"But, you see, Miss Downie, it's the way of the world," I
answered, with a desire to soothe her; "one mustn't be too
thin-skinned. Human nature is essentially spiteful. However, to
return to the subject, you will see, perhaps, the importance of
answering my questions. The circumstances of Charnworth's and
Trankler's deaths are being closely inquired into, and I am sure you
wouldn't like it to be thought that you were withholding information
which, in the interest of law and justice, might be valuable."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," she replied, suppressing a sob. "But I have
nothing to tell you."</p>

<p>"But you knew the three men I have mentioned."</p>

<p>"Of course I did, but Job Panton is an ass. I never, could bear
him."</p>

<p>"He was your sweetheart, though, was he not?"</p>

<p>"He used to come fooling about, and declared that he couldn't live
without me."</p>

<p>"Did you never give him encouragement?"</p>

<p>"I suppose every girl makes a fool of herself sometimes."</p>

<p>"Then you did allow him to sweetheart you?"</p>

<p>"If you like to call it sweethearting you can," she answered, with
a toss of her pretty head. "I did walk out with him sometimes. But I
didn't care much for him. You see, he wasn't my sort at all."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Well, surely I couldn't be expected to marry a gamekeeper, could
I?"</p>

<p>"He is a gamekeeper, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In whose employ is he?"</p>

<p>"Lord Belmere's."</p>

<p>"Was he much disappointed when he found that you would have
nothing to do with him?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know. I didn't trouble myself about him," she
answered, with a coquettish heartlessness.</p>

<p>"Did you do any sweethearting with Mr. Trankler?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not. He used to be very civil to me, and talk to me
when he met me."</p>

<p>"Did you ever walk out with him?"</p>

<p>The question brought the colour back to her face, and her manner
grew confused again.</p>

<p>"Once or twice I met him by accident, and he strolled along the
road with me--that's all."</p>

<p>This answer was not a truthful one. Of that I was convinced by her
very manner. But I did not betray my mistrust or doubts. I did not
think there was any purpose to be served in so doing. So far the
object of my visit was accomplished, and as Miss Downie seemed
disposed to resent any further questioning, I thought it was
advisable to bring the interview to a close; but before doing so, I
said:</p>

<p>"I have one more question to ask you, Miss Downie. Permit me to
preface it, however, by saying I am afraid that, up to this point,
you have failed to appreciate the situation, or grasp the seriousness
of the position in which you are placed. Let me, therefore, put it
before you in a somewhat more graphic way. Two men--gentlemen of good
social position with whom you seem to have been well acquainted, and
whose attentions you encouraged--pray do not look at me so angrily as
that; I mean what I say. I repeat that you encouraged their
attentions, otherwise they would not have gone after you." Here Miss
Downie's nerves gave way again, and she broke into a fit of weeping,
and, holding her handkerchief to her eyes, she exclaimed with almost
passionate bitterness:</p>

<p>"Well, whatever I did, I was egged on to do it by my cousin,
Jessie Turner. She always said I was a fool not to aim at high
game."</p>

<p>"And so you followed her promptings, and really thought that you
might have made a match with Mr. Charnworth; but, he having died, you
turned your thoughts to young Trankler." She did not reply, but
sobbed behind her handkerchief. So I proceeded. "Now the final
question I want to ask you is this: Have you ever had anyone who has
made serious love to you but Job Panton?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Charnworth made love to me," she sobbed out.</p>

<p>"He flirted with you," I suggested.</p>

<p>"No; he made love to me," she persisted. "He promised to marry
me."</p>

<p>"And you believed him?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did."</p>

<p>"Did Trankler promise to marry you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I must repeat the question, but will add Mr. Charnworth's
name. Besides him and Panton, is there anyone else in existence who
has courted you in the hope that you would become his wife?"</p>

<p>"No--no one," she mumbled in a broken voice.</p>

<p>As I took my departure I felt that I had gathered up a good many
threads, though they wanted arranging, and, so to speak, classifying;
that done, they would probably give me the clue I was seeking. One
thing was clear, Miss Downie was a weak-headed, giddy, flighty girl,
incapable, as it seemed to me, of seriously reflecting on anything.
Her cousin was crafty and shallow, and a dangerous companion for
Downie, who was sure to be influenced and led by a creature like
Jessie Turner. But, let it not be inferred from these remarks that I
had any suspicion that either of the two women had in any way been
accessory to the crime, for crime I was convinced it was. Trankler
and Charnworth had been murdered, but by whom I was not prepared to
even hint at at that stage of the proceedings. The two unfortunate
gentlemen had, beyond all possibility of doubt, both been attracted
by the girl's exceptionally good looks, and they had amused
themselves with her. This fact suggested at once the question, was
Charnworth in the habit of seeing her before Trankler made her
acquaintance? Now, if my theory of the crime was correct, it could be
asserted with positive certainty, that Charnworth was the girl's
lover before Trankler. Of course it was almost a foregone conclusion
that Trankler must have been aware of her existence for along time.
The place, be it remembered, was small; she, in her way, was a sort
of local celebrity, and it was hardly likely that young Trankler was
ignorant of some of the village gossip in which she figured. But,
assuming that he was, he was well acquainted with Charnworth, who was
looked upon in the neighbourhood as "a gay dog". The female conquests
of such men are often matters of notoriety; though, even if that was
not the case, it was likely enough that Charnworth may have discussed
Miss Downie in Trankler's presence. Some men--especially those of
Charnworth's characteristics--are much given to boasting of their
flirtations, and Charnworth may have been rather prow of his
ascendency over the simple village beauty. Of course, all this, it
will be said, was mere theorizing. So it was; but it will presently
be seen how it squared in with the general theory of the whole
affair, which I had worked out after much pondering, and a careful
weighing and nice adjustment of all the evidence, such as it was, I
had been able to gather together, and the various parts which were
necessary before the puzzle could be put together.</p>

<p>It was immaterial, however, whether Trankler did or did not know
Hester Downie before or at the same time as Charnworth. A point that
was not difficult to determine was this--he did not make himself
conspicuous as her admirer until after his friend's death, probably
not until some time afterwards. Otherwise, how came it about that the
slayer of Charnworth waited two years before he took the life of
young Trankler? The reader will gather from this remark how my
thoughts ran at that time. Firstly, I was clearly of opinion that
both men had been murdered. Secondly, the murder in each case was the
outcome of jealousy. Thirdly, the murderer must, as a logical
sequence, have been a rejected suitor. This would point necessarily
to Job Panton as the criminal, assuming my information was right that
the girl had not had any other lover. But against that theory this
very strong argument could be used: By what extraordinary and secret
means--means that had baffled all the science of the district--had
Job Panton, who occupied the position of a gamekeeper, been able to
do away with his victims, and bring about death so horrible and so
sudden as to make one shudder to think of it? Herein was displayed a
devilishness of cunning, and a knowledge which it was difficult to
conceive that an ignorant and untravelled man was likely to be in
possession of. Logic, deduction, and all the circumstances of the
case were opposed to the idea of Panton being the murderer at the
first blush; and yet, so far as I had gone, I had been irresistibly
drawn towards the conclusion that Panton was either directly or
indirectly responsible for the death of the two gentlemen. But, in
order to know something more of the man whom I suspected, I disguised
myself as a travelling showman on the look-out for a good pitch for
my show, and I took up my quarters for a day or two at a rustic inn
just on the skirts of Knutsford, and known as the Woodman. I had
previously ascertained that this inn was a favourite resort of the
gamekeepers for miles round about, and Job Panton was to be found
there almost nightly.</p>

<p>In a short time I had made his acquaintance. He was a young,
big-limbed, powerful man, of a pronounced rustic type. He had the
face of a gipsy--swarthy and dark, with keen, small black eyes, and a
mass of black curly hair, and in his ears he wore tiny, plain gold
rings. Singularly enough his expression was most intelligent; but
allied with--as it seemed to me--a certain suggestiveness of latent
ferocity. That is to say, I imagined him liable to outbursts of
temper and passion, during which he might be capable of anything. As
it was, then, he seemed to me subdued, somewhat sullen, and averse to
conversation. He smoked heavily, and I soon found that he guzzled
beer at a terrible rate. He had received, for a man in his position,
a tolerably good education. By that I mean he could write a fair
hand, he read well, and had something more than a smattering of
arithmetic. I was told also that he was exceedingly skilful with
carpenter's tools, although he had had no training that way; he also
understood something about plants, while he was considered an
authority on the habit, and everything appertaining to game. The same
informant thought to still further enlighten me by adding:</p>

<p>"Poor Job be&auml;n't the chap he wur a year or more ago. His gal
cut un, and that kind a took a hold on un. He do&auml;n't say much;
but it wur a terrible blow, it wur."</p>

<p>"How was it his girl cut him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, ma&auml;ster, it wur this way; she thought hersel'
a bit too high for un. Mind you, I b&auml;an't a saying as she wur;
but when a gel thinks hersel' above a chap, it's no use talking to
her."</p>

<p>"What was the girl's name?"</p>

<p>"They call her Downie. Her father was a miller here in Knutsford,
but his gal had too big notions of hersel'; and she chucked poor Job
Panton overboard, and they do say as how she took on wi' Me&auml;ster
Charnworth and also wi' Me&auml;ster Trankler. I do&auml;n't know
nowt for certain myself, but there wursome rum kind o' talk going
about. Leastwise, I know that job took it badly, and he ain't been
the same kind o' chap since. But there, what's the use of a braking
one's 'art about a gal? Gals is a queer lot, I tell you. My old
grandfaither used to say, 'Women folk be curious folk. They be
necessary evils, they be, and pleasant enough in their way, but a
chap mustn't let 'em get the upper hand. They're like harses, they
be, and if you want to manage 'em, you must show 'em you're their
me&auml;ster.'"</p>

<p>The garrulous gentleman who entertained me thus with his views on
women, was a tough, sinewy, weather-tanned old codger, who had lived
the allotted span according to the psalmist, but who seemed destined
to tread the earth for a long time still; for his seventy years had
neither bowed nor shrunk him. His chatter was interesting to me
because it served to prove what I already suspected, which was that
Job Panton had taken his jilting very seriously indeed. Job was by no
means a communicative fellow. As a matter of fact, it was difficult
to draw him out on any subject; and though I should have liked to
have heard his views about Hester Downie, I did not feel warranted in
tapping him straight off. I very speedily discovered, however, that
his weakness was beer. His capacity for it seemed immeasurable. He
soaked himself with it; but when he reached the muddled stage, there
was a tendency on his part to be more loquacious, and, taking
advantage at last of one of these opportunities, I asked him one
night if he had travelled. The question was an exceedingly pertinent
one to my theory, and I felt that to a large extent the theory I had
worked out depended upon the answers he gave. He turned his beady
eyes upon me, and said, with a sort of sardonic grin---</p>

<p>"Yes, I've travelled a bit in my, time, me&auml;ster. I've been to
Manchester often, and I once tramped all the way to Edinburgh. I had
to rough it, I tell thee."</p>

<p>"Yes, I dare say," I answered. "But what I mean is, have you ever
been abroad? Have you ever been to sea?"</p>

<p>"No, me&auml;ster, not me."</p>

<p>"You've been in foreign countries?"</p>

<p>"No. I've never been out of this one. England was good enough for
me. But I would like to go away now to Australia, or some of those
places."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, me&auml;ster, I have my own reasons."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," I said, "and no doubt very sound reasons."</p>

<p>"Never thee mind whether they are, or whether they be&auml;n't,"
he retorted warmly. "All I've got to say is, I wouldn't care where I
went to if I could only get far enough away from this place. I'm
tired of it."</p>

<p>In the manner of giving his answer, he betrayed the latent fire
which I had surmised, and showed that there was a volcanic force of
passion underlying his sullen silence, for he spoke with a suppressed
force which clearly indicated the intensity of his feelings, and his
bright eyes grew brighter with the emotion he felt. I now ventured
upon another remark. I intended it to be a test one.</p>

<p>"I heard one of your mates say that you had been jilted. I suppose
that's why you hate the place?"</p>

<p>He turned upon me suddenly. His tanned, ruddy face took on a
deeper flush of red; his upper teeth closed almost savagely on his
nether lip; his chest heaved, and his great, brawny hands clenched
with the working of his passion. Then, with one great bang of his
ponderous fist, he struck the table until the pots and glasses on it
jumped as if they were sentient and frightened; and in a voice thick
with smothered passion, he growled, "Yes, damn her! She's been my
ruin."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" I said. "You are a young man and a young man should
not talk about being ruined because a girl has jilted him."</p>

<p>Once more he turned that angry look upon me, and said
fiercely---</p>

<p>"Thou knows nowt about it, governor. Thou're a stranger to me; and
I do&auml;n't allow no strangers to preach to me. So shut up! I'll
have nowt more to say to thee."</p>

<p>There was a peremptoriness, a force of character, and a display of
firmness and self-assurance in his tone and manner, which stamped him
with a distinct individualism, and made it evident that in his own
particular way he was distinct from the class in which his lot was
cast. He, further than that, gave me the idea that he was designing
and secretive; and given that he had been educated and well trained,
he might have made his mark in the world. My interview with him had
been instructive, and my opinion that he might prove a very important
factor in working out the problem was strengthened; but at that stage
of the inquiry I would not have taken upon myself to say, with
anything like definiteness, that he was directly responsible for the
death of the two gentlemen, whose mysterious ending had caused such a
profound sensation. But the reader of this narrative will now see for
himself that of all men, so far as one could determine then, who
might have been interested in the death of Mr. Charnworth and Mr.
Trankler, Job Panton stood out most conspicuously. His motive for
destroying them was one of the most powerful of human
passions--namely, jealousy, which in his case was likely to assume a
very violent form, inasmuch as there was no evenly balanced
judgement, no capability of philosophical reasoning, calculated to
restrain the fierce, crude passion of the determined and self-willed
man.</p>

<p>A wounded tiger is fiercer and more dangerous than an unwounded
one, and an ignorant and unreasoning man is far more likely to be led
to excess by a sense of wrong, than one who is capable of reflecting
and moralizing. Of course, if I had been the impossible detective of
fiction, endowed with the absurd attributes of being able to tell the
story of a man's life from the way the tip of his nose was formed, or
the number of hairs on his head, or by the shape and size of his
teeth, or by the way he held his pipe when smoking, or from the kind
of liquor he consumed, or the hundred and one utterly ridiculous and
burlesque signs which are so easily read by the detective prig of
modern creation, I might have come to a different conclusion with
reference to Job Panton. But my work had to be carried out on very
different lines, and I had to be guided by certain deductive
inferences, aided by an intimate knowledge of human nature, and of
the laws which, more or less in every case of crime, govern the
criminal.</p>

<p>I have already set forth my unalterable opinion that Charnworth
and Trankler had been murdered; and so far as I had proceeded up to
this point, I had heard and seen enough to warrant me, in my own
humble judgement, in at least suspecting rob Panton of being guilty
of the murder. But there was one thing that puzzled me greatly. When
I first commenced my inquiries, and was made acquainted with all the
extraordinary medical aspects of the case, I argued with myself that
if it was murder, it was murder carried out upon very original lines.
Some potent, swift and powerful poison must have been suddenly and
secretly introduced into the blood of the victim. The bite of a
cobra, or of the still more fearful and deadly Fer de lance of the
West Indies, might have produced symptoms similar to those observed
in the two men; but happily our beautiful and quiet woods and gardens
of England are not infested with these deadly reptiles, and one had
to search for the causes elsewhere. Now everyone knows that the
notorious Lucrezia Borgia, and the Marchioness of Brinvilliers, made
use of means for accomplishing the death of those whom they were
anxious to get out of the way, which were at once effective and
secret. These means consisted, amongst others, of introducing into
the blood of the intended victim some subtle poison, by the medium of
a scratch or puncture. This little and fatal wound could be given by
the scratch of a pin, or the sharpened stone of a ring, and in such a
way that the victim would be all unconscious of it until the deadly
poison so insidiously introduced began to course through his veins,
and to sap the props of his life. With these facts in my mind, I
asked myself if in the Dead Wood Hall tragedies some similar means
had been used; and in order to have competent and authoritative
opinion to guide me, I journeyed back to London to consult the
eminent chemist and scientist, Professor Lucraft. This gentleman had
made a lifelong study of the toxic effect of ptomaines on the human
system, and of the various poisons used by savage tribes for tipping
their arrows and spears. Enlightened as he was on the subject, he
confessed that there were hundreds of these deadly poisons, of which
the modern chemist knew absolutely nothing; but he expressed a
decided opinion that there were many that would produce all the
effects and symptoms observable in the cases of Charnworth and
Trankler. And he particularly instanced some of theherbal extracts
used by various tribes of Indians, who wander in the interior of the
little known country of Ecuador, and he cited as an authority Mr.
Hart Thompson, the botanist who travelled from Quito right through
Ecuador to the Amazon. This gentleman reported that he found a
vegetable poison in use by the natives for poisoning the tips of
their arrows and spears of so deadly and virulent a nature, that a
scratch even on a panther would bring about the death of the animal
within an hour.</p>

<p>Armed with these facts, I returned to Cheshire, and continued my
investigations on the assumption that some sir deadly destroyer of
life had been used to put Charnworth and Trankler out of the way. But
necessarily I was led to question whether or not it was likely that
an untravelled and ignorant man like Job Panton could have known
anything about such poisons and their uses. This was a stumbling
block; and while I was convinced that Panton had a strong motive for
the crime, I was doubtful if he could have been in possession of the
means for committing it. At last, in order to try and get evidence on
this point, I resolved to search the place in which he lived. He had
for along time occupied lodgings in the house of a widow woman in
Knutsford, and I subjected his rooms to a thorough and critical
search, but without finding a sign of anything calculated to justify
my suspicion.</p>

<p>I freely confess that at this stage I began to feel that the
problem was a hopeless one, and that I should fail to work it out. My
depression, however, did not last long. It was not my habit to
acknowledge defeat so long as there were probabilities to guide me,
so I began to make inquiries about Panton's relatives, and these
inquiries elicited the fact that he had been in the habit of making
frequent journeys to Manchester to see an uncle. I soon found that
this uncle had been a sailor, and had been one of a small expedition
which had travelled through Peru and Ecuador in search of gold. Now,
this was a discovery indeed, and the full value of it will be
understood when it is taken in connection with the information given
to me by Professor Lucraft. Let us see how it works out
logically.</p>

<p>Panton's uncle was a sailor and a traveller. He had travelled
through Peru, and had been into the interior of Ecuador.</p>

<p>Panton was in the habit of visiting his uncle.</p>

<p>Could the uncle have wandered through Ecuador without hearing
something of the marvellous poisons used by the natives?</p>

<p>Having been connected with an exploring expedition, it was
reasonable to assume that he was a man of good intelligence, and of
an inquiring turn of mind.</p>

<p>Equally probable was it that he had brought home some of the
deadly poisons or poisoned implements used by the Indians. Granted
that, and what more likely than that he talked of his knowledge and
possessions to his nephew? The nephew, brooding on his wrongs, and
seeing the means within his grasp of secretly avenging himself on
those whom he counted his rivals, obtained the means from his uncle's
collection of putting his rivals to death, in a way which to him
would seem to be impossible to detect. I had seen enough of Panton to
feel sure that he had all the intelligence and cunning necessary for
planning and carrying out the deed.</p>

<p>A powerful link in the chain of evidence had now been forged, and
I proceeded a step further. After a consultation with the chief
inspector of police, who, however, by no means shared my views, I
applied for a warrant for Panton's arrest, although I saw that to
establish legal proof of his guilt would be extraordinarily
difficult, for his uncle at that time was at sea, somewhere in the
southern hemisphere. Moreover, the whole case rested upon such a
hypothetical basis, that it seemed doubtful whether, even supposing a
magistrate would commit, a jury would convict. But I was not daunted;
and, having succeeded so far in giving a practical shape to my
theory, I did not intend to draw back. So I set to work to endeavour
to discover the weapon which had been used for wounding Charnworth
and Trankler, so that the poison, might take effect. This, of course,
was the crux of the whole affair. The discovery of the medium by
which the death-scratch was given would forge almost the last link
necessary to ensure a conviction.</p>

<p>Now, in each case there was pretty conclusive evidence that there
had been no struggle. This fact justified the belief that the victim
was struck silently, and probably unknown to himself. What were the
probabilities of that being the case? Assuming that Panton was guilty
of the crime, how was it that he, being an inferior, was allowed to
come within striking distance of his victims? The most curious thing
was that both men had been scratched on the left side of the neck.
Charnworth had been killed in his friend's garden on a summer night.
Trankler had fallen in mid-day in the depths of a forest. There was
an interval of two years between the death of the one man and the
death of the other, yet each had a scratch on the left side of the
neck. That could not have been a mere coincidence. It was design.</p>

<p>The next point for consideration was, how did Panton--always
assuming that he was the criminal--get access to Mr. Trankler's
grounds? Firstly, the grounds were extensive, and in connection with
a plantation of young fir trees. When Charnworth was found, he was
lying behind a clump of rhododendron bushes, and near where the
grounds were merged into the plantation, a somewhat dilapidated oak
fence separating the two. These details before us make it clear that
Panton could have had no difficulty in gaining access to the
plantation, and thence to the grounds. But how came it that he was
there just at the time that Charnworth was strolling about? It seemed
stretching a point very much to suppose that he could have been
loafing about on the mere chance of seeing Charnworth. And the only
hypothesis that squared in with intelligent reasoning, was that the
victim had been lured into the grounds. But this necessarily
presupposed a confederate. Close inquiry elicited the fact that
Panton was in the habit of going to the house. He knew most of the
servants, and frequently accompanied young Trankler on his shooting
excursions, and periodically he spent half a day or so in the gun
room at the house, in order that he might clean up all the guns, for
which he was paid a small sum every month. These circumstances
cleared the way of difficulties to a very considerable extent. I was
unable, however, to go beyond that, for I could not ascertain the
means that had been used to lure Mr. Charnworth into the garden--if
he had been lured; and I felt sure that he had been. But so much had
to remain for the time being a mystery.</p>

<p>Having obtained the warrant to arrest Panton, I proceeded to
execute it. He seemed thunderstruck when told that he was arrested on
a charge of having been instrumental in bringing about the death of
Charnworth and Trankler. For a brief space of time he seemed to
collapse, and lose his presence of mind. But suddenly, with an
apparent effort, he recovered himself, and said, with a strange smile
on his face---</p>

<p>"You've got to prove it, and that you can never do."</p>

<p>His manner and this remark were hardly compatible with innocence,
but I clearly recognized the difficulties of proof. From that moment
the fellow assumed a self-assured air, and to those with whom he was
brought in contact he would remark:</p>

<p>"I'm as innocent as a lamb, and them as says I done the deed have
got to prove it."</p>

<p>In my endeavour to get further evidence to strengthen my case, I
managed to obtain from Job Panton's uncle's brother, who followed the
occupation of an engine-minder in a large cotton factory in Oldham,
an old chest containing a quantity of lumber. The uncle, on going to
sea again, had left this chest in charge of his brother. A careful
examination of the contents proved that they consisted of a very
miscellaneous collection of odds and ends, including two or three
small, carved wooden idols from some savage country; some stone
weapons, such as are used by the North American Indians; strings of
cowrie shells, a pair of moccasins, feathers of various kinds; a few
dried specimens of strange birds; and last, though not least, a small
bamboo case containing a dozen tiny sharply pointed darts, feathered
at the thick end; while in a stone box, about three inches square,
was a viscid thick gummy looking substance of a very dark brown
colour, and giving off a sickening and most disagreeable, though
faint odour. These things I at once submitted to Professor Lucraft,
who expressed an opinion that the gummy substance in the stone box
was a vegetable poison, used probably to poison the dares with. He
lost no time in experimentalizing with this substance, as well as
with the darts. With these darts he scratched guinea-pigs, rabbits, a
dog, a cat, a hen, and a young pig, and in each case death ensued in
periods of time ranging from a quarter of an hour to two hours. By
means of a subcutaneous injection into a rabbit of a minute portion
of the gummy substance, about the size of a pea, which had been
thinned with alcohol, he produced death in exactly seven minutes. A
small monkey was next procured, and slightly scratched on the neck
with one of the poisoned darts. In a very short time the poor animal
exhibited the most distressing symptoms, and in half an hour it was
dead, and a post-mortem examination revealed many of the peculiar
effect which had been observed in Charnworth's and Trankler's bodies.
Various other exhaustive experiments were carried out, all of which
confirmed the deadly nature of these minute poison-darts, which could
be puffed through a hollow tube to a great distance, and after some
practice, with unerring aim. Analysis of the gummy substance in the
box proved it to be a violent vegetable poison; innocuous when
swallowed, but singularly active and deadly when introduced direct
into the blood.</p>

<p>On the strength of these facts, the magistrate duly committed Job
Panton to take his trial at the next assizes, on a charge of murder,
although there was not a scrap of evidence forthcoming to prove that
he had ever been in possession of any of the darts or the poison; and
unless such evidence was forthcoming, it was felt that the case for
the prosecution must break down, however clear the mere guilt of the
man might seem.</p>

<p>In due course, Panton was put on his trial at Chester, and the
principal witness against him was Hester Downie, who was subjected to
a very severe cross-examination, which left not a shadow of a doubt
that she and Panton had at one time been close sweethearts. But her
cousin Jessie Turner proved a tempter of great subtlety. It was made
clear that she poisoned the girl's mind against her humble lover.
Although it could not be proved, it is highly probable that Jessie
Turner was a creature of and in the pay of Mr. Charnworth, who seemed
to have been very much attracted by him. Hester's connection with
Charnworth half maddened Panton, who made frantic appeals to her to
be true to him, appeals to which she turned a deaf ear. That Trankler
knew her in Charnworth's time was also brought out, and after
Charnworth's death she smiled favourably on the young man. On the
morning that Trankler's shooting-party went out to Mere Forest,
Panton was one of the beaters employed by the party.</p>

<p>So much was proved; so much was made as clear as daylight, and it
opened the way for any number of inferences. But the last and most
important link was never forthcoming. Panton was defended by an able
and unscrupulous counsel, who urged with tremendous force on the
notice of the jury, that firstly, not one of the medical witnesses
would undertake to swear that the two men had died from the effects
of poison similar to that found in the old chest which had belonged
to the prisoner's uncle; and secondly, there was not one scrap of
evidence tending to prove that Panton had ever been in possession of
poisoned darts, or had ever had access to the chest in which they
were kept. These two points were also made much of by the learned
judge in his summing up. He was at pains to make clear that there was
a doubt involved, and that mere inference ought not to be allowed to
outweigh the doubt when a human being was on trial for his life.
Although circumstantially the evidence very strongly pointed to the
probability of the prisoner having killed both men, nevertheless, in
the absence of the strong proof which the law demanded, the way was
opened for the escape of a suspected man, and it was far better to
let the law be cheated of its due, than that an innocent man should
suffer. At the same time, the judge went on, two gentlemen had met
their deaths in a manner which had baffled medical science, and no
one was forthcoming who would undertake to say that they had been
killed in the manner suggested by the prosecution, and yet it had
been shown that the terrible and powerful poison found in the old
chest, and which there was reason to believe had been brought from
some part of the little known country near the sources of the mighty
Amazon, would produce all the effects which were observed in they
bodies of Charnworth and Trankler. The chest, furthermore, in which
the poison was discovered, was in the possession of Panton's uncle.
Panton had a powerful motive in the shape of consuming jealousy for
getting rid of his more favoured rivals; and though he was one of the
shooting-party in Mere Forest on the day that Trankler lost his life,
no evidence had been produced to prove that he was on the premises of
Dead Wood Hall, on the night that Charnworth died. If, in weighing
all these points of evidence, the jury were of opinion circumstantial
evidence was inadequate, then it was their duty to give the
prisoner--whose life was in their hands the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>The jury retired, and were absent three long hours, and it became
known that they could not agree. Ultimately, they returned into
court, and pronounced a verdict of "Not guilty." In Scotland the
verdict must and would have been non proven.</p>

<p>And so Job Panton went free, but an evil odour seemed to cling
about him; he was shunned by his former companions, and many a
suspicious glance was directed to him, and many a bated murmur was
uttered as he passed by, until in a while he went forth beyond the
seas, to the far wild west, as some said, and his haunts knew him no
more.</p>

<p>The mystery is still a mystery; but how near I came to solving the
problem of Dead Wood Hall it is for the reader to judge.</p>
