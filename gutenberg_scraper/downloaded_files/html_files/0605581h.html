<h2><a name="ch1"></a>The Old Nurse's Story</h2>

<p>YOU know, my dears, that your mother was an orphan, and an only
child; and I dare say you have heard that your grandfather was a
clergyman up in Westmoreland, where I come from. I was just a girl in
the village school, when, one day, your grandmother came in to ask
the mistress if there was any scholar there who would do for a
nurse-maid; and mighty proud I was, I can tell ye, when the mistress
called me up, and spoke to my being a good girl at my needle, and a
steady, honest girl, and one whose parents were very respectable,
though they might be poor. I thought I should like nothing better
than to serve the pretty young lady, who was blushing as deep as I
was, as she spoke of the coming baby, and what I should have to do
with it. However, I see you don't care so much for this part of my
story, as for what you think is to come, so I'll tell you at once. I
was engaged and settled at the parsonage before Miss Rosamond (that
was the baby, who is now your mother) was born. To be sure, I had
little enough to do with her when she came, for she was never out of
her mother's arms, and slept by her all night long; and proud enough
was I sometimes when missis trusted her to me. There never was such a
baby before or since, though you've all of you been fine enough in
your turns; but for sweet, winning ways, you've none of you come up
to your mother. She took after her mother, who was a real lady born;
a Miss Furnivall, a grand-daughter of Lord Furnivall's, in
Northumberland. I believe she had neither brother nor sister, and had
been brought up in my lord's family till she had married your
grandfather, who was just a curate, son to a shopkeeper in
Carlisle--but a clever, fine gentleman as ever was--and one who was a
right-down hard worker in his parish, which was very wide, and
scattered all abroad over the Westmoreland Fells. When your mother,
little Miss Rosamond, was about four or five years old, both her
parents died in a fortnight--one after the other. Ah! that was a sad
time. My pretty young mistress and me was looking for another baby,
when my master came home from one of his long rides, wet and tired,
and took the fever he died of; and then she never held up her head
again, but just lived to see her dead baby, and have it laid on her
breast, before she sighed away her life. My mistress had asked me, on
her death-bed, never to leave Miss Rosamond; but if she had never
spoken a word, I would have gone with the little child to the end of
the world.</p>

<p>The next thing, and before we had well stilled our sobs, the
executors and guardians came to settle the affairs. They were my poor
young mistress's own cousin, Lord Furnivall, and Mr. Esthwaite, my
master's brother, a shopkeeper in Manchester; not so well-to-do then
as he was afterwards, and with a large family rising about him. Well!
I don't know if it were their settling, or because of a letter my
mistress wrote on her death-bed to her cousin, my lord; but somehow
it was settled that Miss Rosamond and me were to go to Furnivall
Manor House, in Northumberland; and my lord spoke as if it had been
her mother's wish that she should live with his family, and as if he
had no objections, for that one or two more or less could make no
difference in so grand a household. So, though that was not the way
in which I should have wished the coming of my bright and pretty pet
to have been looked at--who was like a sunbeam in any family, be it
never so grand--I was well pleased that all the folks in the Dale
should stare and admire, when they heard I was going to be young
lady's maid at my Lord Furnivall's at Furnivall Manor.</p>

<p>But I made a mistake in thinking we were to go and live where my
lord did. It turned out that the family had left Furnivall Manor
House fifty years or more. I could not hear that my poor young
mistress had ever been there, though she had been brought up in the
family; and I was sorry for that, for I should have liked Miss
Rosamond's youth to have passed where her mother's had been.</p>

<p>My lord's gentleman, from whom I asked as many questions as I
durst, said that the Manor House was at the foot of the Cumberland
Fells, and a very grand place; that an old Miss Furnivall, a
great-aunt of my lord's, lived there, with only a few servants; but
that it was a very healthy place, and my lord had thought that it
would suit Miss Rosamond very well for a few years, and that her
being there might perhaps amuse his old aunt.</p>

<p>I was bidden by my lord to have Miss Rosamond's things ready by a
certain day. He was a stern, proud man, as they say all the Lords
Furnivall were; and he never spoke a word more than was necessary.
Folk did say he had loved my young mistress; but that, because she
knew that his father would object, she would never listen to him, and
married Mr. Esthwaite; but I don't know. He never married, at any
rate. But he never took much notice of Miss Rosamond; which I thought
he might have done if he had cared for her dead mother. He sent his
gentleman with us to the Manor House, telling him to join him at
Newcastle that same evening; so there was no great length of time for
him to make us known to all the strangers before he, too, shook us
off; and we were left, two lonely young things (I was not eighteen)
in the great old Manor House. It seems like yesterday that we drove
there. We had left our own dear parsonage very early, and we had both
cried as if our hearts would break, though we were travelling in my
lord's carriage, which I thought so much of once. And now it was long
past noon on a September day, and we stopped to change horses for the
last time at a little smoky town, all full of colliers and miners.
Miss Rosamond had fallen asleep, but Mr. Henry told me to waken her,
that she might see the park and the Manor House as we drove up. I
thought it rather a pity; but I did what he bade me, for fear he
should complain of me to my lord. We had left all signs of a town, or
even a village, and were then inside the gates of a large wild
park--not like the parks here in the south, but with rocks, and the
noise of running water, and gnarled thorn-trees, and old oaks, all
white and peeled with age.</p>

<p>The road went up about two miles, and then we saw a great and
stately house, with many trees close around it, so close that in some
places their branches dragged against the walls when the wind blew,
and some hung broken down; for no one seemed to take much charge of
the place;--to lop the wood, or to keep the moss-covered carriage-way
in order. Only in front of the house all was clear. The great oval
drive was without a weed; and neither tree nor creeper was allowed to
grow over the long, many-windowed front; at both sides of which a
wing projected, which were each the ends of other side fronts; for
the house, although it was so desolate, was even grander than I
expected. Behind it rose the Fells, which seemed unenclosed and bare
enough; and on the left hand of the house, as you stood facing it,
was a little, old-fashioned flower-garden, as I found out afterwards.
A door opened out upon it from the west front; it had been scooped
out of the thick, dark wood for some old Lady Furnivall; but the
branches of the great forest-trees had grown and overshadowed it
again, and there were very few flowers that would live there at that
time.</p>

<p>When we drove up to the great front entrance, and went into the
hall, I thought we should be lost--it was so large, and vast, and
grand. There was a chandelier all of bronze, hung down from the
middle of the ceiling; and I had never seen one before, and looked at
it all in amaze. Then, at one end of the hall, was a great fireplace,
as large as the sides of the houses in my country, with massy
andirons and dogs to hold the wood; and by it were heavy,
old-fashioned sofas. At the opposite end of the hall, to the left as
you went in--on the western side--was an organ built into the wall,
and so large that it filled up the best part of that end. Beyond it,
on the same side, was a door; and opposite, on each side of the
fireplace, were also doors leading to the east front; but those I
never went through as long as I stayed in the house, so I can't tell
you what lay beyond.</p>

<p>The afternoon was closing in, and the hall, which had no fire
lighted in it, looked dark and gloomy; but we did not stay there a
moment. The old servant, who had opened the door for us, bowed to Mr.
Henry, and took us in through the door at the further side of the
great organ, and led us through several smaller halls and passages
into the west drawing-room, where he said that Miss Furnivall was
sitting. Poor little Miss Rosamond held very tight to me, as if she
were scared and lost in that great place; and as for myself, I was
not much better. The west drawing-room was very cheerful-looking,
with a warm fire in it, and plenty of good, comfortable furniture
about. Miss Furnivall was an old lady not far from eighty, I should
think, but I do not know. She was thin and tall, and had a face as
full of fine wrinkles as if they had been drawn all over it with a
needle's point. Her eyes were very watchful, to make up, I suppose,
for her being so deaf as to be obliged to use a trumpet. Sitting with
her, working at the same great piece of tapestry, was Mrs. Stark, her
maid and companion, and almost as old as she was. She had lived with
Miss Furnivall ever since they both were young, and now she seemed
more like a friend than a servant; she looked so cold, and grey, and
stony, as if she had never loved or cared for any one; and I don't
suppose she did care for any one, except her mistress; and, owing to
the great deafness of the latter, Mrs. Stark treated her very much as
if she were a child. Mr. Henry gave some message from my lord, and
then he bowed good-bye to us all--taking no notice of my sweet little
Miss Rosamond's outstretched hand--and left us standing there, being
looked at by the two old ladies through their spectacles.</p>

<p>I was right glad when they rung for the old footman who had shown
us in at first, and told him to take us to our rooms. So we went out
of that great drawing-room, and into another sitting-room, and out of
that, and then up a great flight of stairs, and along a broad
gallery--which was something like a library, having books all down
one side, and windows and writing-tables all down the other--till we
came to our rooms, which I was not sorry to hear were just over the
kitchens; for I began to think I should be lost in that wilderness of
a house. There was an old nursery, that had been used for all the
little lords and ladies long ago, with a pleasant fire burning in the
grate, and the kettle boiling on the hob, and tea-things spread out
on the table; and out of that room was the night-nursery, with a
little crib for Miss Rosamond close to my bed. And old James called
up Dorothy, his wife, to bid us welcome; and both he and she were so
hospitable and kind, that by-and-by Miss Rosamond and me felt quite
at home; and by the time tea was over, she was sitting on Dorothy's
knee, and chattering away as fast as her little tongue could go. I
soon found out that Dorothy was from Westmoreland, and that bound her
and me together, as it were; and I would never wish to meet with
kinder people than were old James and his wife. James had lived
pretty nearly all his life in my lord's family, and thought there was
no one so grand as they. He even looked down a little on his wife;
because, till he had married her, she had never lived in any but a
farmer's household. But he was very fond of her, as well he might be.
They had one servant under them, to do all the rough work. Agnes they
called her; and she and me, and James and Dorothy, with Miss
Furnivall and Mrs. Stark, made up the family; always remembering my
sweet little Miss Rosamond! I used to wonder what they had done
before she came, they thought so much of her now. Kitchen and
drawing-room, it was all the same. The hard, sad Miss Furnivall, and
the cold Mrs. Stark, looked pleased when she came fluttering in like
a bird, playing and pranking hither and thither, with a continual
murmur, and pretty prattle of gladness. I am sure, they were sorry
many a time when she flitted away into the kitchen, though they were
too proud to ask her to stay with them, and were a little surprised
at her taste; though to be sure, as Mrs. Stark said, it was not to be
wondered at, remembering what stock her father had come of. The
great, old rambling house was a famous place for little Miss
Rosamond. She made expeditions all over it, with me at her heels:
all, except the east wing, which was never opened, and whither we
never thought of going. But in the western and northern part was many
a pleasant room; full of things that were curiosities to us, though
they might not have been to people who had seen more. The windows
were darkened by the sweeping boughs of the trees, and the ivy which
had overgrown them; but, in the green gloom, we could manage to see
old china jars and carved ivory boxes, and great heavy books, and,
above all, the old pictures!</p>

<p>Once, I remember, my darling would have Dorothy go with us to tell
us who they all were; for they were all portraits of some of my
lord's family, though Dorothy could not tell us the names of every
one. We had gone through most of the rooms, when we came to the old
state drawing-room over the hall, and there was a picture of Miss
Furnivall; or, as she was called in those days, Miss Grace, for she
was the younger sister. Such a beauty she must have been! but with
such a set, proud look, and such scorn looking out of her handsome
eyes, with her eyebrows just a little raised, as if she wondered how
any one could have the impertinence to look at her, and her lip
curled at us, as we stood there gazing. She had a dress on, the like
of which I had never seen before, but it was all the fashion when she
was young: a hat of some soft white stuff like beaver, pulled a
little over her brows, and a beautiful plume of feathers sweeping
round it on one side; and her gown of blue satin was open in front to
a quilted white stomacher.</p>

<p>"Well, to be sure!" said I, when I had gazed my fill. "Flesh is
grass, they do say; but who would have thought that Miss Furnivall
had been such an out-and-out beauty, to see her now?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dorothy. "Folks change sadly. But if what my master's
father used to say was true, Miss Furnivall, the elder sister, was
handsomer than Miss Grace. Her picture is here somewhere; but, if I
show it you, you must never let on, even to James, that you have seen
it Can the little lady hold her tongue, think you?" asked she.</p>

<p>I was not so sure, for she was such a little sweet, bold,
open-spoken child, so I set her to hide herself; and then I helped
Dorothy to turn a great picture, that leaned with its face towards
the wall, and was not hung up as the others were. To be sure, it beat
Miss Grace for beauty; and I think, for scornful pride, too, though
in that matter it might be hard to choose. I could have looked at it
an hour but Dorothy seemed half frightened at having shown it to me,
and hurried it back again, and bade me run and find Miss Rosamond,
for that there were some ugly places about the house, where she
should like ill for the child to go. I was a brave, high-spirited
girl, and thought little of what the old woman said, for I liked
hide-and-seek as well as any child in the parish; so off I ran to
find my little one.</p>

<p>As winter drew on, and the days grew shorter, I was sometimes
almost certain that I heard a noise as if some one was playing on the
great organ in the hall. I did not hear it every evening; but,
certainly, I did very often, usually when I was sitting with Miss
Rosamond, after I had put her to bed, and keeping quite still and
silent in the bedroom. Then I used to hear it booming and swelling
away in the distance. The first night, when I went down to my supper,
I asked Dorothy who had been playing music, and James said very
shortly that I was a gowk to take the wind soughing among the trees
for music; but I saw Dorothy look at him very fearfully, and Bessy,
the kitchen-maid, said something beneath her breath, and went quite
white. I saw they did not like my question, so I held my peace till I
was with Dorothy alone, when I knew I could get a good deal out of
her. So, the next day, I watched my time, and I coaxed and asked her
who it was that played the organ; for I knew that it was the organ
and not the wind well enough, for all I had kept silence before
James. But Dorothy had had her lesson, I'll warrant, and never a word
could I get from her. So then I tried Bessy, though I had always held
my head rather above her, as I was evened to James and Dorothy, and
she was little better than their servant So she said I must never,
never tell; and if ever told, I was never to say she had told me; but
it was a very strange noise, and she had heard it many a time, but
most of all on winter nights, and before storms; and folks did say it
was the old lord playing on the great organ in the hall, just as he
used to do when he was alive; but who the old lord was, or why he
played, and why he played on stormy winter evenings in particular,
she either could not or would not tell me. Well! I told you I had a
brave heart; and I thought it was rather pleasant to have that grand
music rolling about the house, let who would be the player; for now
it rose above the great gusts of wind, and wailed and triumphed just
like a living creature, and then it fell to a softness most complete,
only it was always music, and tunes, so it was nonsense to call it
the wind. I thought at first, that it might be Miss Furnivall who
played, unknown to Bessy; but one day, when I was in the hall by
myself, I opened the organ and peeped all about it and around it, as
I had done to the organ in Crosthwaite Church once before, and I saw
it was all broken and destroyed inside, though it looked so brave and
fine; and then, though it was noon-day, my flesh began to creep a
little, and I shut it up, and run away pretty quickly to my own
bright nursery; and I did not like hearing the music for some time
after that, any more than James and Dorothy did. All this time Miss
Rosamond was making herself more and more beloved. The old ladies
liked her to dine with them at their early dinner James stood behind
Miss Furnivall's chair, and I behind Miss Rosamond's all in state;
and, after dinner, she would play about in a corner of the great
drawing-room as still as any mouse, while Miss Furnivall slept, and I
had my dinner in the kitchen. But she was glad enough to come to me
in the nursery afterwards; for, as she said Miss Furnivall was so
sad, and Mrs. Stark so dull; but she and were merry enough; and,
by-and-by, I got not to care for that weird rolling music, which did
one no harm, if we did not know where it came from.</p>

<p>That winter was very cold. In the middle of October the frosts
began, and lasted many, many weeks. I remember one day, at dinner,
Miss Furnivall lifted up her sad, heavy eyes, and said to Mrs. Stark,
"I am afraid we shall have a terrible winter," in a strange kind of
meaning way But Mrs. Stark pretended not to hear, and talked very
loud of something else. My little lady and I did not care for the
frost; not we! As long as it was dry, we climbed up the steep brows
behind the house, and went up on the Fells which were bleak and bare
enough, and there we ran races in the fresh, sharp air; and once we
came down by a new path, that took us past the two old gnarled
holly-trees, which grew about half-way down by the east side of the
house. But the days grew shorter and shorter, and the old lord, if it
was he, played away, more and more stormily and sadly, on the great
organ. One Sunday afternoon--it must have been towards the end of
November--I asked Dorothy to take charge of little missy when she
came out of the drawing-room, after Miss Furnivall had had her nap;
for it was too cold to take her with me to church, and yet I wanted
to go, And Dorothy was glad enough to promise and was so fond of the
child, that all seemed well; and Bessy and I set off very briskly,
though the sky hung heavy and black over the white earth, as if the
night had never fully gone away, and the air, though still, was very
biting.</p>

<p>"We shall have a fall of snow," said Bessy to me. And sure enough,
even while we were in church, it came down thick, in great large
flakes--so thick, it almost darkened the windows. It had stopped
snowing before we came out, but it lay soft, thick, and deep beneath
our feet, as we tramped home. Before we got to the hall, the moon
rose, and I think it was lighter then--what with the moon, and what
with the white dazzling snow--than it had been when we went to
church, between two and three o'clock. I have not told you that Miss
Furnivall and Mrs. Stark never went to church; they used to read the
prayers together, in their quiet, gloomy way; they seemed to feel the
Sunday very long without their tapestry-work to be busy at. So when I
went to Dorothy in the kitchen, to fetch Miss Rosamond and take her
upstairs with me, I did not much wonder when the old woman told me
that the ladies had kept the child with them, and that she had never
come to the kitchen, as I had bidden her, when she was tired of
behaving pretty in the drawing-room. So I took off my things and went
to find her, and bring her to her supper in the nursery. But when I
went into the best drawing-room, there sat the two old ladies, very
still and quiet, dropping out a word now and then, but looking as if
nothing so bright and merry as Miss Rosamond had ever been near them.
Still I thought she might be hiding from me; it was one of her pretty
ways,--and that she had persuaded them to look as if they knew
nothing about her; so I went softly peeping under this sofa and
behind that chair, making believe I was sadly frightened at not
finding her.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Hester?" said Mrs. Stark sharply. I don't know
if Miss Furnivall had seen me for, as I told you, she was very deaf,
and she sat quite still, idly staring into the fire, with her
hopeless face. "I'm only looking for my little Rosy Posy," replied I,
still thinking that the child was there, and near me, though I could
not see her.</p>

<p>"Miss Rosamond is not here," said Mrs. Stark. "She went away, more
than an hour ago, to find Dorothy." And she, too, turned and went on
looking into the fire.</p>

<p>My heart sank at this, and I began to wish I had never left my
darling. I went back to Dorothy and told her. James was gone out for
the day, but she, and me, and Bessy took lights, and went up into the
nursery first; and then we roamed over the great, large house,
calling and entreating Miss Rosamond to come out of her hiding-place,
and not frighten us to death in that way. But there was no answer; no
sound.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said I, at last, "can she have got into the east wing and
hidden there?"</p>

<p>But Dorothy said it was not possible, for that she herself had
never been in there; that the doors were always locked, and my lord's
steward had the keys, she believed; at any rate, neither she nor
James had ever seen them: so I said I would go back, and see if,
after all, she was not hidden in the drawing-room, unknown to the old
ladies; and if I found her there, I said, I would whip her well for
the fright she had given me; but I never meant to do it. Well, I went
back to the west drawing-room, and I told Mrs. Stark we could not
find her anywhere, and asked for leave to look all about the
furniture there, for I thought now that she might have fallen asleep
in some warm, hidden corner; but no! we looked--Miss Furnivall got up
and looked, trembling all over--and she was nowhere there; then we
set off again, every one in the house, and looked in all the places
we had searched before, but we could not find her. Miss Furnivall
shivered and shook so much, that Mrs. Stark took her back into the
warm drawing-room; but not before they had made me promise to bring
her to them when she was found. Well-a-day! I began to think she
never would be found, when I bethought me to look into the great
front court, all covered with snow. I was upstairs when I looked out;
but, it was such clear moonlight, I could see, quite plain, two
little footprints, which might be traced from the hall-door and round
the corner of the east wing. I don't know how I got down, but I
tugged open the great stiff hall-door, and, throwing the skirt of my
gown over my head for a cloak, I ran out. I turned the east corner,
and there a black shadow fell on the snow but when I came again into
the moonlight, there were the little footmarks going up--up to the
Fells. It was bitter cold; so cold, that the air almost took the skin
off my face as I ran; but I ran on, crying to think how my poor
little darling must be perished and frightened. I was within sight of
the holly-trees, when I saw a shepherd coming down the hill, bearing
something in his arms wrapped in his maud. He shouted to me, and
asked me if I had lost a bairn; and, when I could not speak for
crying, he bore towards me, and I saw my wee bairnie, lying still,
and white, and stiff in his arms, as if she had been dead. He told me
he had been up the Fells to gather in his sheep, before the deep cold
of night came on, and that under the holly-trees (black marks on the
hill-side, where no other bush was for miles around) he had found my
little lady--my lamb--my queen--my darling--stiff and cold in the
terrible sleep which is frost-begotten. Oh! the joy and the tears of
having her in my arms once again I for I would not let him carry her;
but took her, maud and all, into my own arms, and held her near my
own warm neck and heart, and felt the life stealing slowly back again
into her little gentle limbs. But she was still insensible when we
reached the hall, and I had no breath for speech. We went in by the
kitchen-door.</p>

<p>"Bring the warming-pan," said I; and I carried her upstairs, and
began undressing her by the nursery fire, which Bessy had kept up. I
called my little lammie all the sweet and playful names I could think
of,--even while my eyes were blinded by my tears; and at last, oh! at
length she opened her large blue eyes. Then I put her into her warm
bed, and sent Dorothy down to tell Miss Furnivall that all was well;
and I made up my mind to sit by my darling's bedside the live-long
night. She fell away into a soft sleep as soon as her pretty head had
touched the pillow, and I watched by her till morning light; when she
wakened up bright and clear--or so I thought at first--and, my dears,
so I think now.</p>

<p>She said, that she had fancied that she should like to go to
Dorothy, for that both the old ladies were asleep, and it was very
dull in the drawing-room; and that, as she was going through the west
lobby, she saw the snow through the high window
falling--falling--soft and steady; but she wanted to see it lying
pretty and white on the ground; so she made her way into the great
hall: and then, going to the window, she saw it bright and soft upon
the drive; but while she stood there, she saw a little girl, not so
old as she was, "but so pretty," said my darling; "and this little
girl beckoned to me to come out; and oh, she was so pretty and so
sweet, I could not choose but go." And then this other little girl
had taken her by the hand, and side by side the two had gone round
the east corner.</p>

<p>"Now you are a naughty little girl, and telling stories," said I.
"What would your good mamma, that is in heaven, and never told a
story in her life, say to her little Rosamond, if she heard her--and
I dare say she does--telling stories!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Hester," sobbed out my child, "I'm telling you true.
Indeed I am."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me!" said I, very stern. "I tracked you by your
foot-marks through the snow; there were only yours to be seen: and if
you had had a little girl to go hand-in-hand with you up the hill,
don't you think the footprints would have gone along with yours?"</p>

<p>"I can't help it, dear, dear Hester," said she, crying, "if they
did not; I never looked at her feet, but she held my hand fast and
tight in her little one, and it was very, very cold. She took me up
the Fell-path, up to the holly-trees; and there I saw a lady weeping
and crying; but when she saw me, she hushed her weeping, and smiled
very proud and grand, and took me on her knee, and began to lull me
to sleep, and that's all, Hester--but that is true; and my dear mamma
knows it is," said she, crying. So I thought the child was in a
fever, and pretended to believe her, as she went over her story--over
and over again, and always the same. At last Dorothy knocked at the
door with Miss Rosamond's breakfast; and she told me the old ladies
were down in the eating parlour, and that they wanted to speak to me.
They had both been into the night-nursery the evening before, but it
was after Miss Rosamond was asleep; so they had only looked at
her--not asked me any questions.</p>

<p>"I shall catch it," thought I to myself, as I went along the north
gallery. "And yet," I thought, taking courage, "it was in their
charge I left her; and it's they that's to blame for letting her
steal away unknown and unwatched." So I went in boldly, and told my
story. I told it all to Miss Furnivall, shouting it close to her ear;
but when I came to the mention of the other little girl out in the
snow, coaxing and tempting her out, and wiling her up to the grand
and beautiful lady by the holly-tree, she threw her arms up--her old
and withered arms--and cried aloud, "Oh! Heaven forgive! Have
mercy!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stark took hold of her; roughly enough, I thought; but she
was past Mrs. Stark's management, and spoke to me, in a kind of wild
warning and authority.</p>

<p>"Hester! keep her from that child! It will lure her to her death!
That evil child! Tell her it is a wicked, naughty child." Then, Mrs.
Stark hurried me out of the room; where, indeed, I was glad enough to
go; but Miss Furnivall kept shrieking out, "Oh, have mercy! Wilt Thou
never forgive! It is many a long year ago"--</p>

<p>I was very uneasy in my mind after that. I durst never leave Miss
Rosamond, night or day, for fear lest she might slip off again, after
some fancy or other; and all the more, because I thought I could make
out that Miss Furnivall was crazy, from their odd ways about her; and
I was afraid lest something of the same kind (which might be in the
family, you know) hung over my darling. And the great frost never
ceased all this time; and, whenever it was a more stormy night than
usual, between the gusts, and through the wind we heard the old lord
playing on the great organ. But, old lord, or not, wherever Miss
Rosamond went, there I followed; for my love for her, pretty,
helpless orphan, was stronger than my fear for the grand and terrible
sound. Besides, it rested with me to keep her cheerful and merry, as
beseemed her age. So we played together, and wandered together, here
and there, and everywhere; for I never dared to lose sight of her
again in that large and rambling house. And so it happened, that one
afternoon, not long before Christmas-day, we were playing together on
the billiard-table in the great hall (not that we knew the right way
of playing, but she liked to roll the smooth ivory balls with her
pretty hands, and I liked to do whatever she did); and, by-and-by,
without our noticing it, it grew dusk indoors, though it was still
light in the open air, and I was thinking of taking her back into the
nursery, when, all of a sudden, she cried out--</p>

<p>"Look, Hester! look! there is my poor little girl out in the
snow!"</p>

<p>I turned towards the long narrow windows, and there, sure enough,
I saw a little girl, less than my Miss Rosamond--dressed all unfit to
be out-of-doors such a bitter night--crying, and beating against the
window panes, as if she wanted to be let in. She seemed to sob and
wail, till Miss Rosamond could bear it no longer, and was flying to
the door to open it, when, all of a sudden, and close upon us, the
great organ pealed out so loud and thundering, it fairly made me
tremble; and all the more, when I remembered me that, even in the
stillness of that dead-cold weather, I had heard no sound of little
battering hands upon the window-glass, although the phantom child had
seemed to put forth all its force; and, although I had seen it wail
and cry, no faintest touch of sound had fallen upon my ears. Whether
I remembered all this at the very moment, I do not know; the great
organ sound had so stunned me into terror; but this I know, I caught
up Miss Rosamond before she got the hall-door opened, and clutched
her, and carried her away, kicking and screaming, into the large,
bright kitchen, where Dorothy and Agnes were busy with their
mince-pies.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with my sweet one?" cried Dorothy, as I bore
in Miss Rosamond, who was sobbing as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>"She won't let me open the door for my little girl to come in; and
she'll die if she is out on the Fells all night. Cruel, naughty
Hester," she said, slapping me; but she might have struck harder, for
I had seen a look of ghastly terror on Dorothy's face, which made my
very blood run cold.</p>

<p>"Shut the back-kitchen door fast, and bolt it well," said she to
Agues. She said no more; she gave me raisins and almonds to quiet
Miss Rosamond; but she sobbed about the little girl in the snow, and
would not touch any of the good things. I was thankful when she cried
herself to sleep in bed. Then I stole down to the kitchen, and told
Dorothy I had made up my mind. I would carry my darling back to my
father's house in Applethwaite; where, if we lived humbly, we lived
at peace. I said I had been frightened enough with the old lord's
organ-playing; but now that I had seen for myself this little moaning
child, all decked out as no child in the neighbourhood could be,
beating and battering to get in, yet always without any sound or
noise--with the dark wound on its right shoulder; and that Miss
Rosamond had known it again for the phantom that had nearly lured her
to death (which Dorothy knew was true); I would stand it no
longer.</p>

<p>I saw Dorothy change colour once or twice. When I had done, she
told me she did not think I could take Miss Rosamond with me, for
that she was my lord's ward, and I had no right over her; and she
asked me would I leave the child that I was so fond of just for
sounds and sights that could do me no harm; and that they had all had
to get used to in their turns? I was all in a hot, trembling passion;
and I said it was very well for her to talk, that knew what these
sights and noises betokened, and that had, perhaps, had something to
do with the spectre child while it was alive. And I taunted her so,
that she told me all she knew at last; and then I wished I had never
been told, for it only made me more afraid than ever.</p>

<p>She said she had heard the tale from old neighbours that were
alive when she was first married; when folks used to come to the hall
sometimes, before it had got such a bad name on the country side: it
might not be true, or it might, what she had been told.</p>

<p>The old lord was Miss Furnivall's father--Miss Grace, as Dorothy
called her, for Miss Maude was the elder, and Miss Furnivall by
lights. The old lord was eaten up with pride. Such a proud man was
never seen or heard of; and his daughters were like him. No one was
good enough to wed them, although they had choice enough; for they
were the great beauties of their day, as I had seen by their
portraits, where they hung in the state drawing-room. But, as the old
saying is, "Pride will have a fall;" and these two haughty beauties
fell in love with the same man, and he no better than a foreign
musician, whom their father had down from London to play music with
him at the Manor House. For, above all things, next to his pride, the
old lord loved music. He could play`on nearly every instrument that
ever was heard of; and it was a strange thing it did not soften him;
but he was a fierce, dour old man, and had broken his poor wife's
heart with his cruelty, they said. He was mad after music, and would
pay any money for it. So he got this foreigner to come; who made such
beautiful music, that they said the very birds on the trees stopped
their singing to listen. And, by degrees, this foreign gentleman got
such a hold over the old lord, that nothing would serve him but that
he must come every year; and it was he that had the great organ
brought from Holland, and built up in the hall, where it stood now.
He taught the old lord to play on it; but many and many a time, when
Lord Furnivall was thinking of nothing but his fine organ, and his
finer music, the dark foreigner was walking abroad in the woods, with
one of the young ladies: now Miss Maude, and then Miss Grace.</p>

<p>Miss Maude won the day and carried off the prize, such as it was;
and he and she were married, all unknown to any one; and, before he
made his next yearly visit, she had been confined of a little girl at
a farm-house on the Moors, while her father and Miss Grace thought
she was away at Doncaster Races. But though she was a wife and a
mother, she was not a bit softened, but as haughty and as passionate
as ever; and perhaps more so, for she was jealous of Miss Grace, to
whom her foreign husband paid a deal of court--by way of blinding
her--as he told his wife. But Miss Grace triumphed over Miss Maude,
and Miss Maude grew fiercer and fiercer, both with her husband and
with her sister; and the former--who could easily shake off what was
disagreeable, and hide himself in foreign countries--went away a
month before his usual time that summer, and half-threatened that he
would never come back again. Meanwhile, the little girl was left at
the farm-house, and her mother used to have her horse saddled and
gallop wildly over the hills to see her once every week, at the very
least; for where she loved she loved, and where she hated she hated.
And the old lord went on playing--playing on his organ; and the
servants thought the sweet music he made had soothed down his awful
temper, of which (Dorothy said) some terrible tales could be told. He
grew infirm too, and had to walk with a crutch; and his son--that was
the present Lord Furnivall's father--was with the army in America,
and the other son at sea; so Miss Maude had it pretty much her own
way, and she and Miss Grace grew colder and bitterer to each other
every day; till at last they hardly ever spoke, except when the old
lord was by. The foreign musician came again the next summer, but it
was for the last time; for they led him such a life with their
jealousy and their passions, that he grew weary, and went away, and
never was heard of again. And Miss Maude, who had always meant to
have her marriage acknowledged when her father should be dead, was
left now a deserted wife, whom nobody knew to have been married, with
a child that she dared not own, although she loved it to distraction;
living with a father whom she feared, and a sister whom she hated.
When the next summer passed over, and the dark foreigner never came,
both Miss Maude and Miss Grace grew gloomy and sad; they had a
haggard look about them, though they looked handsome as ever. But,
by-and-by, Miss Maude brightened; for her father grew more and more
infirm, and more than ever carried away by his music, and she and
Miss Grace lived almost entirely apart, having separate rooms, the
one on the west side, Miss Maude on the east--those very rooms which
were now shut up. So she thought she might have her little girl with
her, and no one need ever know except those who dared not speak about
it, and were bound to believe that it was, as she said, a cottager's
child she had taken a fancy to. All this, Dorothy said, was pretty
well known; but what came afterwards no one knew, except Miss Grace
and Mrs. Stark, who was even then her maid, and much more of a friend
to her than ever her sister had been. But the servants supposed, from
words that were dropped, that Miss Maude had triumphed over Miss
Grace, and told her that all the time the dark foreigner had been
mocking her with pretended love--he was her own husband. The colour
left Miss Grace's cheek and lips that very day for ever, and she was
heard to say many a time that sooner or later she would have her
revenge; and Mrs. Stark was for ever spying about the east rooms.</p>

<p>One fearful night, just after the New Year had come in, when the
snow was lying thick and deep; and the flakes were still
falling--fast enough to blind any one who might be out and
abroad--there was a great and violent noise heard, and the old lord's
voice above all, cursing and swearing awfully, and the cries of a
little child, and the proud defiance of a fierce woman, and the sound
of a blow, and a dead stillness, and moans and wailings, dying away
on the hill-side! Then the old lord summoned all his servants, and
told them, with terrible oaths, and words more terrible, that his
daughter had disgraced herself, and that he had turned her out of
doors--her, and her child--and that if ever they gave her help, or
food, or shelter, he prayed that they might never enter heaven. And,
all the while, Miss Grace stood by him, white and still as any stone;
and, when he had ended, she heaved a great sigh, as much as to say
her work was done, and her end was accomplished. But the old lord
never touched his organ again, and died within the year; and no
wonder I for, on the morrow of that wild and fearful night, the
shepherds, coming down the Fell side, found Miss Maude sitting, all
crazy and smiling, under the holly-trees, nursing a dead child, with
a terrible mark on its right shoulder. "But that was not what killed
it," said Dorothy: "it was the frost and the cold. Every wild
creature was in its hole, and every beast in its fold, while the
child and its mother were turned out to wander on the Fells! And now
you know all! and I wonder if you are less frightened now?"</p>

<p>I was more frightened than ever; but I said I was not. I wished
Miss Rosamond and myself well out of that dreadful house for ever;
but I would not leave her, and I dared not take her away. But oh, how
I watched her, and guarded her! We bolted the doors, and shut the
window-shutters fast, an hour or more before dark, rather than leave
them open five minutes too late. But my little lady still heard the
weird child crying and mourning; and not all we could do or say could
keep her from wanting to go to her, and let her in from the cruel
wind and snow. All this time I kept away from Miss Furnivall and Mrs.
Stark, as much as ever I could; for I feared them--I knew no good
could be about them, with their grey, hard faces, and their dreamy
eyes, looking back into the ghastly years that were gone. But, even
in my fear, I had a kind of pity for Miss Furnivall, at least. Those
gone down to the pit can hardly have a more hopeless look than that
which was ever on her face. At last I even got so sorry for her--who
never said a word but what was quite forced from her--that I prayed
for her; and I taught Miss Rosamond to pray for one who had done a
deadly sin; but often, when she came to those words, she would
listen, and start up from her knees, and say, "I hear my little girl
plaining and crying, very sad,--oh, let her in, or she will die!"</p>

<p>One night--just after New Year's Day had come at last, and the
long winter had taken a turn, as I hoped--I heard the west
drawing-room bell ring three times, which was the signal for me. I
would not leave Miss Rosamond alone, for all she was asleep--for the
old lord had been playing wilder than ever--and I feared lest my
darling should waken to hear the spectre child; see her I knew she
could not. I had fastened the windows too well for that. So I took
her out of her bed, and wrapped her up in such outer clothes as were
most handy, and carried her down to the drawing-room, where the old
ladies sat at their tapestry-work as usual. They looked up when I
came in, and Mrs. Stark asked, quite astounded, "Why did I bring Miss
Rosamond there, out of her warm bed?" I had begun to whisper,
"Because I was afraid of her being tempted out while I was away, by
the wild child in the snow," when she stopped me short (with a glance
at Miss Furnivall), and said Miss Furnivall wanted me to undo some
work she had done wrong, and which neither of them could see to
unpick. So I laid my pretty dear on the sofa, and sat down on a stool
by them, and hardened my heart against them, as I heard the wind
rising and howling.</p>

<p>Miss Rosamond slept on sound, for all the wind blew so; and Miss
Furnivall said never a word, nor looked round when the gusts shook
the windows. All at once she started up to her full height, and put
up one hand, as if to bid us listen.</p>

<p>"I hear voices!" said she. "I hear terrible screams--I hear my
father's voice!"</p>

<p>Just at that moment my darling wakened with a sudden start: "My
little girl is crying, oh, how she is crying!" and she tried to get
up and go to her, but she got her feet entangled in the blanket, and
I caught her up; for my flesh had begun to creep at these noises,
which they heard while we could catch no sound. In a minute or two
the noises came, and gathered fast, and filled our ears; we, too,
heard voices and screams, and no longer heard the winter's wind that
raged abroad. Mrs. Stark looked at me, and I at her, but we dared not
speak. Suddenly Miss Furnivall, went towards the door, out into the
ante-room, through the west lobby, and opened the door into the great
hall. Mrs. Stark followed, and I durst not be left, though my heart
almost stopped beating for fear. I wrapped my darling tight in my
arms, and went out with them. In the hall the screams were louder
than ever; they seemed to come from the east wing--nearer and
nearer--close on the other side of the locked-up doors--close behind
them. Then I noticed that the great bronze chandelier seemed all
alight, though the hall was dim, and that a fire was blazing in the
vast hearth-place, though it gave no heat; and I shuddered up with
terror, and folded my darling closer to me. But as I did so the east
door shook, and she, suddenly struggling to get free from me, cried,
"Hester! I must go. My little girl is there I hear her; she is
coming! Hester, I must go!"</p>

<p>I held her tight with all my strength; with a set will, I held
her. If I had died, my hands would have grasped her still, I was so
resolved in my mind. Miss Furnivall stood listening, and paid no
regard to my darling, who had got down to the ground, and whom I,
upon my knees now, was holding with both my arms clasped round her
neck; she still striving and crying to get free.</p>

<p>All at once, the east door gave way with a thundering crash, as if
torn open in a violent passion, and there came into that broad and
mysterious light, the figure of a tall old man, with grey hair and
gleaming eyes. He drove before him, with many a relentless gesture of
abhorrence, a stern and beautiful woman, with a little child clinging
to her dress.</p>

<p>"O Hester! Hester!" cried Miss Rosamond; "it's the lady! the lady
below the holly-trees; and my little girl is with her. Hester!
Hester! let me go to her; they are drawing me to them. I feel them--I
feel them. I must go!"</p>

<p>Again she was almost convulsed by her efforts to get away; but I
held her tighter and tighter, till I feared I should do her a hurt;
but rather that than let her go towards those terrible phantoms. They
passed along towards the great hall-door, where the winds howled and
ravened for their prey; but before they reached that, the lady
turned; and I could see that she defied the old man with a fierce and
proud defiance; but then she quailed--and then she threw up her arms
wildly and piteously to save her child--her little child--from a blow
from his uplifted crutch.</p>

<p>And Miss Rosamond was torn as by a power stronger than mine, and
writhed in my arms, and sobbed (for by this time the poor darling was
growing faint).</p>

<p>"They want me to go with them on to the Fells--they are drawing me
to them. Oh, my little girl! I would come, but cruel, wicked Hester
holds me very tight." But when she saw the uplifted crutch, she
swooned away, and I thanked God for it. Just at this moment--when the
tall old man, his hair streaming as in the blast of a furnace, was
going to strike the little shrinking child--Miss Furnivall, the old
woman by my side, cried out, "O father! father! spare the little
innocent child!" But just then I saw--we all saw--another phantom
shape itself, and grow clear out of the blue and misty light that
filled the hall; we had not seen her till now, for it was another
lady who stood by the old man, with a look of relentless hate and
triumphant scorn. That figure was very beautiful to look upon, with a
soft, white hat drawn down over the proud brows, and a red and
curling lip. It was dressed in an open robe of blue satin. I had seen
that figure before. It was the likeness of Miss Furnivall in her
youth; and the terrible phantoms moved on, regardless of old Miss
Furnivall's wild entreaty,--and the uplifted crutch fell on the right
shoulder of the little child, and the younger sister looked on,
stony, and deadly serene. But at that moment, the dim lights, and the
fire that gave no heat, went out of themselves, and Miss Furnivall
lay at our feet stricken down by the palsy--death-stricken.</p>

<p>Yes! she was carried to her bed that night never to rise again.
She lay with her face to the wall, muttering low, but muttering
always: "Alas! alas! what is done in youth can never be undone in
age! What is done in youth can never be undone in age!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch2"></a>Clopton House</h2>

<p>"I wonder if you know Clopton Hall, about a mile from
Stratford-on-Avon. Will you allow me to tell you of a very happy day
I once spent there? I was at school in the neighbourhood, and one of
my schoolfellows was the daughter of a Mr. W---, who then lived at
Clopton. Mrs. W--asked a party of the girls to go and spend a long
afternoon, and we set off one beautiful autumn day, full of delight
and wonder respecting the place we were going to see. We passed
through desolate half-cultivated fields, till we came within sight of
the house--a large, heavy, compact, square brick building, of that
deep, dead red almost approaching to purple. In front was a large
formal court, with the massy pillars surmounted with two grim
monsters; but the walls of the court were broken down, and the grass
grew as rank and wild within the enclosure as in the raised avenue
walk down which we had come. The flowers were tangled with nettles,
and it was only as we approached the house that we saw the single
yellow rose and the Austrian briar trained into something like order
round the deep-set diamond-paned windows. We trooped into the hall,
with its tesselated marble floor, hung round with strange portraits
of people who had been in their graves two hundred years at least;
yet the colours were so fresh, and in some instances they were so
life-like, that looking merely at the faces, I almost fancied the
originals might be sitting in the parlour beyond. More completely to
carry us back, as it were, to the days of the civil wars, there was a
sort of military map hung up, well finished with pen and ink, shewing
the stations of the respective armies, and with old-fashioned writing
beneath, the names of the principal towns, setting forth the strength
of the garrison, etc. In this hall we were met by our kind hostess,
and told we might ramble where we liked, in the house or out of the
house, taking care to be in the 'recessed parlour' by tea-time. I
preferred to wander up the wide shelving oak staircase, with its
massy balustrade all crumbling and worm-eaten. The family then
residing at the hall did not occupy one-half--no, not one-third of
the rooms; and the old-fashioned furniture was undisturbed in the
greater part of them. In one of the bed-rooms (said to be haunted),
and which, with its close pent-up atmosphere and the long-shadows of
evening creeping on, gave me an 'eirie' feeling, hung a portrait so
singularly beautiful! a sweet-looking girl, with paly gold hair
combed back from her forehead and falling in wavy ringlets on her
neck, and with eyes that 'looked like violets filled with dew,' for
there was the glittering of unshed tears before their deep dark
blue--and that was the likeness of Charlotte Clopton, about whom
there was so fearful a legend told at Stratford church. In the time
of some epidemic, the sweating-sickness or the plague, this young
girl had sickened, and to all appearance died. She was buried with
fearful haste in the vaults of Clopton chapel, attached to Stratford
church, but the sickness was not stayed. In a few days another of the
Cloptons died, and him they bore to the ancestral vault; but as they
descended the gloomy stairs, they saw by the torchlight, Charlotte
Clopton in her grave-clothes leaning against the wall; and when they
looked nearer, she was indeed dead, but not before, in the agonies of
despair and hunger, she had bitten a piece from her white round
shoulder! Of course, she had walked ever since. This was 'Charlotte's
chamber,' and beyond Charlotte's chamber was a state-chamber carpeted
with the dust of many years, and darkened by the creepers which had
covered up the windows, and even forced themselves in luxuriant
daring through the broken panes. Beyond, again, there was an old
Catholic chapel, with a chaplain's room, which had been walled up and
forgotten till within the last few years. I went in on my hands and
knees, for the entrance was very low. I recollect little in the
chapel; but in the chaplain's room were old, and I should think rare,
editions of many books, mostly folios. A large yellow-paper copy of
Dryden's 'All for Love, or the World Well Lost,' date 1686, caught my
eye, and is the only one I particularly remember. Every here and
there, as I wandered, I came upon a fresh branch of a staircase, and
so numerous were the crooked, half-lighted passages, that I wondered
if I could find my way back again. There was a curious carved old
chest in one of these passages, and with girlish curiosity I tried to
open it; but the lid was too heavy, till I persuaded one of my
companions to help me, and when it was opened, what do you think we
saw?--BONES!--but whether human, whether the remains of the lost
bride, we did not stay to see, but ran off in partly feigned, and
partly real terror.</p>

<p>"The last of these deserted rooms that I remember, the last, the
most deserted, and the saddest, was the Nursery,--a nursery without
children, without singing voices, without merry chiming footsteps! A
nursery hung round with its once inhabitants, bold, gallant boys, and
fair, arch-looking girls, and one or two nurses with round, fat
babies in their arms. Who were they all? What was their lot in life?
Sunshine, or storm? or had they been 'loved by the gods, and died
young?' The very echoes knew not. Behind the house, in a hollow now
wild, damp, and overgrown with elder-bushes, was a well called
Margaret's Well, for there had a maiden of the house of that name
drowned herself.</p>

<p>"I tried to obtain any information I could as to the family of
Clopton of Clopton. They had been decaying ever since the civil wars;
had for a generation or two been unable to live in the old house of
their fathers, but had toiled in London, or abroad, for a livelihood;
and the last of the old family, a bachelor, eccentric, miserly, old,
and of most filthy habits, if report said true, had died at Clopton
Hall but a few months before, a sort of boarder in Mr. W---'s family.
He was buried in the gorgeous chapel of the Cloptons in Stratford
church, where you see the banners waving, and the armour hung over
one or two splendid monuments. Mr. W--had been the old man's
solicitor, and completely in his confidence, and to him he left the
estate, encumbered and in bad condition. A year or two afterwards,
the heir-at-law, a very distant relation living in Ireland, claimed
and obtained the estate, on the plea of undue influence, if not of
forgery, on Mr. W---'s part; and the last I heard of our kind
entertainers on that day, was that they were outlawed, and living at
Brussels."</p>

<h2><a name="ch3"></a>The Crooked Branch</h2>

<p>Not many years after the beginning of this century, a worthy
couple of the name of Huntroyd occupied a small farm in the North
Riding of Yorkshire. They had married late in life, although they
were very young when they first began to 'keep company' with each
other. Nathan Huntroyd had been farm-servant to Hester Rose's father,
and had made up to her at a time when her parents thought she might
do better; and so, without much consultation of her feelings, they
had dismissed Nathan in somewhat cavalier fashion. He had drifted far
away from his former connections, when an uncle of his died, leaving
Nathan--by this time upwards of forty years of age--enough money to
stock a small farm, and yet have something over, to put in the bank
against bad times. One of the consequences of this bequest was, that
Nathan was looking out for a wife and housekeeper, in a kind of
discreet and leisurely way, when one day he heard that his old love,
Hester, was not married and flourishing, as he had always supposed
her to be, but a poor maid-of-all-work, in the town of Ripon. For her
father had had a succession of misfortunes, which had brought him in
his old age to the workhouse; her mother was dead; her only brother
struggling to bring up a large family; and Hester herself a
hard-working, homely-looking (at thirty-seven) servant. Nathan had a
kind of growling satisfaction (which only lasted a minute or two,
however) in hearing of these turns of fortune's wheel. He did not
make many intelligible remarks to his informant, and to no one else
did he say a word. But, a few days afterwards, he presented himself,
dressed in his Sunday best, at Mrs Thompson's back-door in Ripon.</p>

<p>Hester stood there, in answer to the good sound knock his good
sound oak-stick made: she, with the light full upon her, he in
shadow. For a moment there was silence. He was scanning the face and
figure of his old love, for twenty years unseen. The comely beauty of
youth had faded away entirely; she was, as I have said,
homely-looking, plain-featured, but with a clean skin, and pleasant
frank eyes. Her figure was no longer round, but tidily draped in a
blue and white bed-gown, tied round her waist by her white
apron-strings, and her short red linsey petticoat showed her tidy
feet and ankles. Her former lover fell into no ecstasies. He simply
said to himself, 'She'll do'; and forthwith began upon his
business.</p>

<p>'Hester, thou dost not mind me. I am Nathan, as thy father turned
off at a minute's notice, for thinking of thee for a wife, twenty
year come Michaelmas next. I have not thought much upon matrimony
since. But Uncle Ben has died leaving me a small matter in the bank;
and I have taken Nab-End Farm, and put in a bit of stock, and shall
want a missus to see after it. Wilt like to come? I'll not mislead
thee. It's dairy, and it might have been arable. But arable takes
more horses nor it suited me to buy, and I'd the offer of a tidy lot
of kine. That's all. If thou'll have me, I'll come for thee as soon
as the hay is gotten in'.</p>

<p>Hester only said, 'Come in, and sit thee down'.</p>

<p>He came in, and sat down. For a time, she took no more notice of
him than of his stick, bustling about to get dinner ready for the
family whom she served. He meanwhile watched her brisk sharp
movements, and repeated to himself, 'She'll do!' After about twenty
minutes of silence thus employed, he got up, saying--</p>

<p>'Well, Hester, I'm going. When shall I come back again?'</p>

<p>'Please thysel', and thou'll please me,' said Hester, in a tone
that she tried to make light and indifferent; but he saw that her
colour came and went, and that she trembled while she moved about. In
another moment Hester was soundly kissed; but, when she looked round
to scold the middle-aged farmer, he appeared so entirely composed
that she hesitated. He said--</p>

<p>'I have pleased mysel', and thee too, I hope. Is it a month's
wage, and a month's warning? To-day is the eighth. July eighth is our
wedding-day. I have no time to spend a-wooing before then, and
wedding must na take long. Two days is enough to throw away, at our
time o' life.'</p>

<p>It was like a dream; but Hester resolved not to think more about
it till her work was done. And when all was cleaned up for the
evening, she went and gave her mistress warning, telling her all the
history of her life in a very few words. That day month she was
married from Mrs Thompson's house.</p>

<p>The issue of the marriage was one boy, Benjamin. A few years after
his birth, Hester's brother died at Leeds, leaving ten or twelve
children. Hester sorrowed bitterly over this loss; and Nathan showed
her much quiet sympathy, although he could not but remember that Jack
Rose had added insult to the bitterness of his youth. He helped his
wife to make ready to go by the waggon to Leeds. He made light of the
household difficulties, which came thronging into her mind after all
was fixed for her departure. He filled her purse, that she might have
wherewithal to alleviate the immediate wants of her brother's family.
And, as she was leaving, he ran after the waggon. 'Stop, stop!' he
cried. 'Hetty, if thou wilt--if it wunnot be too much for thee--bring
back one of Jack's wenches for company, like. We've enough and to
spare; and a lass will make the house winsome, as a man may say.'</p>

<p>The waggon moved on; while Hester had such a silent swelling of
gratitude in her heart, as was both thanks to her husband and
thanksgiving to God.</p>

<p>And that was the way that little Bessy Rose came to be an inmate
of the Nab's-End Farm.</p>

<p>Virtue met with its own reward in this instance, and in a clear
and tangible shape, too; which need not delude people in general into
thinking that such is the usual nature of virtue's rewards! Bessy
grew up a bright affectionate, active girl; a daily comfort to her
uncle and aunt. She was so much a darling in the household that they
even thought her worthy of their only son Benjamin, who was
perfection in their eyes. It is not often the case that two plain,
homely people have a child of uncommon beauty; but it is so
sometimes, and Benjamin Huntroyd was one of these exceptional cases.
The hard-working, labour-and-care-marked farmer, and the mother, who
could never have been more than tolerably comely in her best days,
produced a boy who might have been an earl's son for grace and
beauty. Even the hunting squires of the neighbourhood reined up their
horses to admire him, as he opened the gates for them. He had no
shyness, he was so accustomed from his earliest years to admiration
from strangers and adoration from his parents. As for Bessy Rose, he
ruled imperiously over her heart from the time she first set eyes on
him. And, as she grew older, she grew on in loving, persuading
herself that what her uncle and aunt loved so dearly it was her duty
to love dearest of all. At every unconscious symptom of the young
girl's love for her cousin, his parents smiled and winked: all was
going on as they wished; no need to go far a-field for Benjamin's
wife. The household could go on as it was now; Nathan and Hester
sinking into the rest of years, and relinquishing care and authority
to those dear ones, who, in the process of time, might bring other
dear ones to share their love.</p>

<p>But Benjamin took it all very coolly. He had been sent to a
day-school in the neighbouring town--a grammar-school in the high
state of neglect in which the majority of such schools were thirty
years ago. Neither his father nor his mother knew much of learning.
All they knew (and that directed their choice of a school) was that
they could not, by any possibility, part with their darling to a
boarding-school; that some schooling he must have, and that Squire
Pollard's son went to Highminster Grammar School. Squire Pollard's
son, and many another son destined to make his parents' hearts ache,
went to this school. If it had not been so utterly a bad place of
education, the simple farmer and his wife might have found it out
sooner. But not only did the pupils there learn vice, they also
learnt deceit. Benjamin was naturally too clever to remain a dunce;
or else, if he had chosen so to be, there was nothing in Highminster
Grammar School to hinder his being a dunce of the first water. But,
to all appearance, he grew clever and gentleman-like. His father and
mother were even proud of his airs and graces, when he came home for
the holidays; taking them for proofs of his refinement, although the
practical effect of such refinement was to make him express his
contempt for his parents' homely ways and simple ignorance. By the
time he was eighteen, an articled clerk in an attorney's office at
Highminster,--for he had quite declined becoming a 'mere
clod-hopper,' that is to say, a hard-working, honest farmer like his
father--Bessy Rose was the only person who was dissatisfied with him.
The little girl of fourteen instinctively felt there was something
wrong about him. Alas! two years more, and the girl of sixteen
worshipped his very shadow, and would not see that aught could be
wrong with one so soft-spoken, so handsome, so kind as Cousin
Benjamin. For Benjamin had discovered that the way to cajole his
parents out of money for every indulgence he fancied, was to pretend
to forward their innocent scheme, and make love to his pretty cousin,
Bessy Rose. He cared just enough for her to make this work of
necessity not disagreeable at the time he was performing it. But he
found it tiresome to remember her little claims upon him, when she
was no longer present. The letters he had promised her during his
weekly absence at Highminster, the trifling commissions she had asked
him to do for her, were all considered in the light of troubles; and,
even when he was with her, he resented the inquiries she made as to
his mode of passing his time, or what female acquaintances he had in
Highminster.</p>

<p>When his apprenticeship was ended, nothing would serve him but
that he must go up to London for a year or two. Poor Farmer Huntroyd
was beginning to repent of his ambition of making his son Benjamin a
gentleman. But it was too late to repine now. Both father and mother
felt this; and, however sorrowful they might be, they were silent,
neither demurring nor assenting to Benjamin's proposition when first
he made it. But Bessy, through her tears, noticed that both her uncle
and aunt seemed unusually tired that night, and sat hand-in-hand on
the fireside settle, idly gazing into the bright flame, as if they
saw in it pictures of what they had once hoped their lives would have
been. Bessy rattled about among the supper-things, as she put them
away after Benjamin's departure, making more noise than usual--as if
noise and bustle was what she needed to keep her from bursting out
crying--and, having at one keen glance taken in the position and
looks of Nathan and Hester, she avoided looking in that direction
again, for fear the sight of their wistful faces should make her own
tears overflow.</p>

<p>'Sit thee down, lass--sit thee down! Bring the creepie-stool to
the fireside, and let's have a bit of talk over the lad's plans,'
said Nathan, at last rousing himself to speak. Bessy came and sat
down in front of the fire, and threw her apron over her face, as she
rested her head on both hands. Nathan felt as if it was a chance
which of the two women burst out crying first. So he thought he would
speak, in hopes of keeping off the infection of tears.</p>

<p>'Didst ever hear of this mad plan afore, Bessy?'</p>

<p>'No, never!' Her voice came muffled and changed from under her
apron. Hester felt as if the tone, both of question and answer,
implied blame; and this she could not bear.</p>

<p>'We should ha' looked to it when we bound him; for of necessity it
would ha' come to this. There's examins, and catechizes, and I dunno
what all for him to be put through in London. It's not his
fault.'</p>

<p>'Which on us said it were?' asked Nathan, rather put out. 'Tho',
for that matter, a few weeks would carry him over the mire, and make
him as good a lawyer as any judge among 'em. Oud Lawson the attorney
told me that, in a talk I had wi' him a bit sin. Na, na! it's the
lad's own hankering after London that makes him want for to stay
there for a year, let alone two.'</p>

<p>Nathan shook his head.</p>

<p>'And if it be his own hankering,' said Bessy, putting down her
apron, her face all flame, and her eyes swollen up, 'I dunnot see
harm in it. Lads aren't like lasses, to be teed to their own fireside
like th' crook yonder. It's fitting for a young man to go abroad and
see the world, afore he settles down.'</p>

<p>Hester's hand sought Bessy's; and the two women sat in sympathetic
defiance of any blame that should be thrown on the beloved absent.
Nathan only said--</p>

<p>'Nay, wench, dunnot wax up so; whatten's done's done; and worse,
it's my doing. I mun needs make my bairn a gentleman; and we mun pay
for it.'</p>

<p>'Dear Uncle! he wunna spend much, I'll answer for it; and I'll
scrimp and save i' the house, to make it good.'</p>

<p>'Wench!' said Nathan Solemnly, 'it were not paying in cash I were
speaking on: it were paying in heart's care, and heaviness of soul.
Lunnon is a place where the devil keeps court as well as King George;
and my poor chap has more nor once welly fallen into his clutches
here. I dunno what he'll do, when he gets close within sniff of
him.'</p>

<p>'Don't let him go, father!' said Hester, for the first time taking
this view. Hitherto she had only thought of her own grief at parting
with him. 'Father, if you think so, keep him here, safe under your
own eye!'</p>

<p>'Nay!' said Nathan, 'he's past time o' life for that. Why, there's
not one on us knows where he is at this present time, and he not gone
out of our sight an hour. He's too big to be put back i' th' go-cart,
mother, or to keep within doors, with the chair turned
bottom-upwards.'</p>

<p>'I wish he were a wee bairn lying in my arms again! It were a sore
day when I weaned him; and I think life's been gettin' sorer and
sorer at every turn he's ta'en towards manhood.'</p>

<p>'Coom, lass; that's noan the way to be talking. Be thankful to
Marcy that thou'st getten a man for thy son as stands five foot
eleven in's stockings, and never a sick piece about him. We wunnot
grudge him his fling, will we, Bess, my wench? He'll be coming back
in a year, or, may be, a bit more, and be a' for settling in a quiet
town like, wi' a wife that's noan so fur fra' me at this very minute.
An' we oud folk, as we get into years, must gi' up farm, and tak a
bit on a house near Lawyer Benjamin.'</p>

<p>And so the good Nathan, his own heart heavy enough, tried to
soothe his women-kind. But, of the three, his eyes were longest in
closing, his apprehensions the deepest founded.</p>

<p>'I misdoubt me I hanna done well by th' lad. I misdoubt me sore,'
was the thought that kept him awake till day began to dawn. 'Summat's
wrong about him, or folk would na look me wi' such piteous-like een,
when they speak on him. I can see th' meaning of it, thof I'm too
proud to let on. And Lawson, too, he holds his tongue more nor he
should do, when I ax him how my lad's getting on, and whatten sort of
a lawyer he'll mak. God be marciful to Hester an' me, if th' lad's
gone away! God be marciful! But, may be, it's this lying waking a'
the night through, that maks me so fearfu'. Why, when I were his age,
I daur be bound I should ha' spent money fast enoof, i' I could ha'
come by iy. But I had to arn it; that maks a great differ'. Well! It
were hard to thwart th' child of our old age, and we waitin' so long
for to have 'un!' Next morning, Nathan rode Moggy, the cart-horse,
into Highminster to see Mr Lawson. Anybody who saw him ride out of
his own yard would have been struck with the change in him which was
visible when he returned: a change greater than a day's unusual
exercise should have made in a man of his years. He scarcely held the
reins at all. One jerk of Moggy's head would have plucked them out of
his hands. His head was bent forward, his eyes looking on some unseen
thing, with long, unwinking gaze. But, as he drew near home on his
return, he made an effort to recover himself.</p>

<p>'No need fretting them,' he said; 'lads will be lads. But I didna
think he had it in him to be so thowtless, young as he is. Well,
well! he'll, may be, get more wisdom i' Lunnon. Anyways, it's best to
cut him off fra such evil lads as Will Hawker, and such-like. It's
they as have led my boy astray. He were a good chap till he knowed
them--a good chap till he knowed them.' But he put all his cares in
the background, when he came into the house-place, where both Bessy
and his wife met him at the door, and both would fain lend a hand to
take off his great-coat.</p>

<p>'Theer, wenches, theer! ye might let a man alone for to get out
on's clothes! Why, I might ha' struck thee, lass. 'And he went on
talking, trying to keep them off for a time from the subject that all
had at heart. But there was no putting them off for ever; and, by
dint of repeated questioning on his wife's part, more was got out
than he had ever meant to tell--enough to grieve both his hearers
sorely: and yet the brave old man still kept the worst in his own
breast.</p>

<p>The next day, Benjamin came home for a week or two, before making
his great start to London. His father kept him at a distance, and was
solemn and quiet in his manner to the young man. Bessy, who had shown
anger enough at first, and had uttered many a sharp speech, began to
relent, and then to feel hurt and displeased that her uncle should
persevere so long in his cold, reserved manner--and Benjamin just
going to leave them! Her aunt went, tremblingly busy, about the
clothes-presses and drawers, as if afraid of letting herself think
either of the past or the future; only once or twice, coming behind
her son, she suddenly stopped over his sitting figure, and kissed his
cheek, and stroked his hair. Bessy remembered afterwards--long years
afterwards--how he had tossed his head away with nervous irritability
on one of these occasions, and had muttered--her aunt did not hear
it, but Bessy did--</p>

<p>'Can't you leave a man alone?'</p>

<p>Towards Bessy herself he was pretty gracious. No other words
express his manner.. it was not warm, nor tender, nor cousinly, but
there was an assumption of underbred politeness towards her as a
young, pretty woman; which politeness was neglected in his
authoritative or grumbling manner towards his mother, or his sullen
silence before his father. He once or twice ventured on a compliment
to Bessy on her personal appearance. She stood still, and looked at
him with astonishment.</p>

<p>'Have my eyes changed sin' last thou saw'st them,' she asked,
'that thou must be telling me about 'em i' that fashion? I'd rayther
by a deal see thee helping thy mother, when she's dropped her
knitting-needle and canna see i' th' dusk for to pick it up.'</p>

<p>But Bessy thought of his pretty speech about her eyes, long after
he had forgotten making it, and when he would have been puzzled to
tell the colour of them. Many a day, after he was gone, did she look
earnestly in the little oblong looking-glass, which hung up against
the wall of her little sleeping-chamber, but which she used to take
down in order to examine the eyes he had praised, murmuring to
herself, 'Pretty, soft grey eyes! Pretty, soft grey eyes!' until she
would hang up the glass again, with a sudden laugh and a rosy
blush.</p>

<p>In the days when he had gone away to the vague distance and vaguer
place--the city called London--Bessy tried to forget all that had
gone against her feeling of the affection and duty that a son owed to
his parents; and she had many things to forget of this kind that
would keep surging up into her mind. For instance, she wished that he
had not objected to the home-spun, home-made shirts which his mother
and she had had such pleasure in getting ready for him. He might not
know, it was true--and so her love urged--how carefully and evenly
the thread had been spun: how, not content with bleaching the yarn in
the sunniest meadow, the linen, on its return from the weaver's, had
been spread out afresh on the sweet summer grass, and watered
carefully, night after night, when there was no dew to perform the
kindly office. He did not know--for no one but Bessy herself did--how
many false or large stitches, made large and false by her aunt's
failing eyes (who yet liked to do the choicest part of the stitching
all by herself), Bessy had unpicked at night in her own room, and
with dainty fingers had re-stitched; sewing eagerly in the dead of
night. All this he did not know; or he could never have complained of
the coarse texture, the old-fashioned make of these shirts, and urged
on his mother to give him part of her little store of egg--and
butter-money, in order to buy newer-fashioned linen in
Highminster.</p>

<p>When once that little precious store of his mother's was
discovered, it was well for Bessy's peace of mind that she did not
know how loosely her aunt counted up the coins, mistaking guineas for
shillings, or just the other way, so that the amount was seldom the
same in the old black spoutless teapot. Yet this son, this hope, this
love, had still a strange power of fascination over the household.
The evening before he left, he sat between his parents, a hand in
theirs on either side, and Bessy on the old creepie-stool, her head
lying on her aunt's knee, and looking up at him from time to time, as
if to learn his face off by heart; till his glances, meeting hers,
made her drop her eyes, and only sigh.</p>

<p>He stopped up late that night with his father, long after the
women had gone to bed. But not to sleep; for I will answer for it the
grey-haired mother never slept a wink till the late dawn of the
autumn day; and Bessy heard her uncle come upstairs with heavy,
deliberate footsteps, and go to the old stocking which served him for
bank, and count out the golden guineas; once he stopped, but again he
went on afresh, as if resolved to crown his gift with liberality.
Another long pause--in which she could but indistinctly hear
continued words, it might have been advice, it might be a prayer, for
it was in her uncle's voice--and then father and son came up to bed.
Bessy's room was but parted from her cousin's by a thin wooden
partition; and the last sound she distinctly heard, before her eyes,
tired out with crying, closed themselves in sleep, was the guineas
clinking down upon each other at regular intervals, as if Benjamin
were playing at pitch and toss with his father's present.</p>

<p>After he was gone, Bessy wished that he had asked her to walk part
of the way with him into Highminster. She was all ready, her things
laid out on the bed; but she could not accompany him without
invitation.</p>

<p>The little household tried to close over the gap as best they
might. They seemed to set themselves to their daily work with unusual
vigour; but somehow, when evening came there had been little done.
Heavy hearts never make light work, and there was no telling how much
care and anxiety each had had to bear in secret in the field, at the
wheel, or in the dairy. Formerly, he was looked for every
Saturday--looked for, though he might not come; or, if he came, there
were things to be spoken about that made his visit anything but a
pleasure: still, he might come, and all things might go right; and
then what sunshine, what gladness to those humble people! But now he
was away, and dreary winter was come on; old folks' sight fails, and
the evenings were long and sad, in spite of all Bessy could do or
say. And he did not write so often as he might--so each one thought;
though each one would have been ready to defend him from either of
the others who had expressed such a thought aloud. 'Surely,' said
Bessy to herself, when the first primroses peeped out in a sheltered
and sunny hedge-bank, and she gathered them as she passed home from
afternoon church--surely, there never will be such a dreary,
miserable winter again as this has been.' There had been a great
change in Nathan and Hester Huntroyd during this last year. The
spring before, when Benjamin was yet the subject of more hopes than
fears, his father and mother looked what I may call an elderly
middle-aged couple: people who had a good deal of hearty work in them
yet. Now--it was not his absence alone that caused the change--they
looked frail and old, as if each day's natural trouble was a burden
more than they could bear. For Nathan had heard sad reports about his
only child, and had told them solemnly to his wife--as things too bad
to be believed, and yet, 'God help us if he is indeed such a lad as
this!' Their eyes were become too dry and hollow for many tears; they
sat together, hand in hand; and shivered, and sighed, and did not
speak many words, or dare to look at each other: and then Hester had
said--</p>

<p>'We mauna tell th' lass. Young folks' hearts break wi' a little,
and she'd be apt to fancy it were true.' Here the old woman's voice
broke into a kind of piping cry; but she struggled, and her next
words were all right. 'We mauna tell her: he's bound to be fond on
her, and, may be, if she thinks well on him, and loves him, it will
bring him straight!'</p>

<p>'God grant it!' said Nathan.</p>

<p>'God shall grant it!' said Hester, passionately moaning out her
words; and then repeating them, alas! with a vain repetition.</p>

<p>'It's a bad place for lying, is Highminster,' said she at length,
as if impatient of the silence. 'I never knowed such a place for
getting up stories. But Bessy knows nought on 'em and nother you nor
me belie'es 'em, that's one blessing.'</p>

<p>But, if they did not in their hearts believe them, how came they
to look so sad and worn, beyond what mere age could make them?</p>

<p>Then came round another year, another winter, yet more miserable
than the last. This year, with the primroses, came Benjamin; a bad,
hard, flippant young man, with yet enough of specious manners and
handsome countenance to make his appearance striking at first to
those to whom the aspect of a London fast young man of the lowest
order is strange and new. Just at first, as he sauntered in with a
swagger and an air of indifference, which was partly assumed, partly
real, his old parents felt a simple kind of awe of him, as if he were
not their son, but a real gentleman; but they had too much fine
instinct in their homely natures not to know, after a very few
minutes had passed, that this was not a true prince.</p>

<p>'Whatten ever does he mean,' said Hester to her niece, as soon as
they were alone, 'by a' them maks and wear-locks? And he minces his
words, as if his tongue were clipped short, or split like a magpie's.
Hech! London is as bad as a hot day i' August for spoiling good
flesh; for he were a good-looking lad when he went up; and now, look
at him, with his skin gone into lines and flourishes, just like the
first page on a copybook.'</p>

<p>'I think he looks a good deal better, aunt, for them new-fashioned
whiskers!' said Bessy, blushing still at the remembrance of the kiss
he had given her on first seeing her--a pledge, she thought, poor
girl, that, in spite of his long silence in letter-writing, he still
looked upon her as his troth-plight wife. There were things about him
which none of them liked, although they never spoke of them; yet
there was also something to gratify them in the way in which he
remained quiet at Nab-End, instead of seeking variety, as he had
formerly done, by constantly stealing off to the neighbouring town.
His father had paid all the debts that he knew of, soon after
Benjamin had gone up to London; so there were no duns that his
parents knew of to alarm him, and keep him at home. And he went out
in the morning with the old man, his father, and lounged by his side,
as Nathan went round his fields, with busy yet infirm gait; having
heart, as he would have expressed it, in all that was going on,
because at length his son seemed to take an interest in the farming
affairs, and stood patiently by his side, while he compared his own
small galloways with the great shorthorns looming over his
neighbour's hedge.</p>

<p>'It's a slovenly way, thou seest, that of selling th' milk; folk
don't care whether its good or not, so that they get their
pint-measure of stuff that's watered afore it leaves th' beast,
instead o' honest cheating by the help o' th' pump. But look at
Bessy's butter, what skill it shows! part her own manner o' making,
and part good choice o' cattle. It's a pleasure to see her basket, a'
packed ready to go to market; and it's noan o' a pleasure for to see
the buckets fu' of their blue starch-water as yon beasts give. I'm
thinking they crossed th' breed wi' a pump not long sin'. Hech! but
our Bessy's a clever canny wench! I sometimes think thou'lt be for
gie'ing up th' law, and taking to th' oud trade, when thou wedst wi'
her!' This was intended to be a skilful way of ascertaining whether
there was any ground for the old farmer's wish and prayer, that
Benjamin might give up the law and return to the primitive occupation
of his father. Nathan dared to hope it now, since his son had never
made much by his profession, owing, as he had said, to his want of a
connection; and the farm, and the stock, and the clean wife, too,
were ready to his hand; and Nathan could safely rely on himself
never, in his most unguarded moments, to reproach his son with the
hardly-earned hundreds that had been spent on his education. So the
old man listened with painful interest to the answer which his son
was evidently struggling to make, coughing a little and blowing his
nose before he spoke.</p>

<p>'Well, you see, father, law is a precarious livelihood; a man, as
I may express myself, has no chanes in the profession unless he is
known--known to the judges, and tip-top barristers, and that sort of
thing. Now, you see, my mother and you have no acquaintance that you
may call exactly in that line. But luckily I have met with a man, a
friend, as I may say, who is really a first-rate fellow, knowing
everybody, from the Lord Chancellor downwards; and he has offered me
a share in his business--a partnership, in short'--He hesitated a
little.</p>

<p>'I'm sure that's uncommon kind of the gentleman,' said Nathan. I
should like for to thank him mysen; for it's not many as would pick
up a young chap out o' th' dirt, as it were, and say "Here's hauf my
good fortune for you, sir, and your very good health!" Most on 'em
when they're gettin' a bit o' luck, run off wi' it to keep it a' to
themselves, and gobble it down in a corner. What may be his name? for
I should like to know it.'</p>

<p>'You don't quite apprehend me, father. A great deal of what you've
said is true to the letter. People don't like to share their good
luck, as you say.'</p>

<p>'The more credit to them as does,' broke in Nathan.</p>

<p>'Ay, but, you see, even such a fine fellow as my friend Cavendish
does not like to give away half his good practice for nothing. He
expects an equivalent.'</p>

<p>'"An equivalent?"' said Nathan; his voice had dropped down an
octave.' And what may that be? There's always some meaning in grand
words, I take it; though I am not book-larned enough to find it
out.'</p>

<p>'Why, in this case, the equivalent he demands for taking me into
partnership, and afterwards relinquishing the whole business to me,
is three hundred pounds down.'</p>

<p>Benjamin looked sideways from under his eyes, to see how his
father took the proposition. His father struck his stick deep down in
the ground; and, leaning one hand upon it, faced round at him.</p>

<p>'Then thy fine friend may go and be hanged. Three hunder pounds!
I'll be darned an' danged too, if I know where to get 'em, if I'd be
making a fool o' thee an' mysen too.'</p>

<p>He was out of breath by this time. His son took his father's first
words in dogged silence; it was but the burst of surprise he had led
himself to expect, and did not daunt him for long.</p>

<p>'I should think, sir'--</p>

<p>'"Sir"--whatten for dost thou "sir" me? Is them your manners? I'm
plain Nathan Huntroyd, who never took on to be a gentleman; but I
have paid my way up to this time, which I shannot do much longer, if
I'm to have a son coming an' asking me for three hundred pound, just
meet same as if I were a cow, and had nothing to do but let down my
milk to the first person as strokes me.'</p>

<p>'Well, father,' said Benjamin, with an affectation of frankness;
'then there's nothing for me but to do as I have often planned
before--go and emigrate.'</p>

<p>'And what?' said his father, looking sharply and steadily at
him.</p>

<p>'Emigrate. Go to America, or India, or some colony where there
would be an opening for a young man of spirit.'</p>

<p>Benjamin had reserved this proposition for his trump card,
expecting by means of it to carry all before him. But, to his
surprise, his father plucked his stick out of the hole he had made
when he so vehemently thrust it into the ground, and walked on four
or five steps in advance; there he stood still again, and there was a
dead silence for a few minutes.</p>

<p>'It 'ud, may be, be the best thing thou couldst do,' the father
began. Benjamin set his teeth hard to keep in curses. It was well for
poor Nathan he did not look round then, and see the look his son gave
him. 'But it would come hard like upon us, upon Hester and me; for,
whether thou'rt a good 'un or not, thou'rt our flesh and blood, our
only bairn; and, if thou'rt not all as a man could wish, it's may be,
been the fault on our pride i' the--It 'ud kill the missus, if he
went off to Amerikay, and Bess, too, the lass as thinks so much on
him!' The speech, originally addressed to his son, had wandered off
into a monologue--as keenly listened to by Benjamin, however, as if
it had all been spoken to him. After a pause of consideration, his
father turned round:</p>

<p>'Yon man--I wunnot call him a friend o' yourn, to think of asking
you for such a mint o' money--is not th' only one, I'll be bound, as
could give ye a start i' the law? Other folks 'ud, may be, do it for
less?'</p>

<p>'Not one of 'em; to give me equal advantages,' said Benjamin,
thinking he perceived signs of relenting.</p>

<p>'Well, then, thou may'st tell him that it's nother he nor thee as
'll see th' sight o' three hundred pound o' my money. I'll not deny
as I've a bit laid up again' a rainy day; it's not so much as
thatten, though; and a part on it is for Bessy, as has been like a
daughter to us.'</p>

<p>'But Bessy is to be your real daughter some day, when I've a home
to take her to,' said Benjamin; for he played very fast and loose,
even in his own mind, with his engagement with Bessy. Present with
her, when she was looking her brightest and best, he behaved to her
as if they were engaged lovers; absent from her, he looked upon her
rather as a good wedge, to be driven into his parents' favour on his
behalf Now, however, he was not exactly untrue in speaking as if he
meant to make her his wife; for the thought was in his mind, though
he made use of it to work upon his father.</p>

<p>'It will be a dree day for us, then,' said the old man. 'But
God'll have us in His keeping, and'll, may-happen, be taking more
care on us i' heaven by that time than Bess, good lass as she is, has
had on us at Nab-End. Her heart is set on thee, too. But, lad, I
hanna gotten the three hunder; I keeps my cash i' th' stocking, thous
know'st, till it reaches fifty pound, and then I takes it to Ripon
Bank. Now the last scratch they'n gi'en me made it just two-hunder,
and I hanna but on to fifteen pound yet i' the stockin', and I meant
one hunder an' the red cow's calf to be for Bess, she's ta'en such
pleasure like i' rearing it'.</p>

<p>Benjamin gave a sharp glance at his father, to see if he was
telling the truth; and, that a suspicion of the old man, his father,
had entered into the son's head, tells enough of his own
character.</p>

<p>'I canna do it, I canna do it, for sure; although I shall like to
think as I had helped on the wedding. There's the black heifer to be
sold yet, and she'll fetch a matter of ten pound; but a deal on't
will be needed for seed-corn, for the arable did but bad last year,
and I thought I would try--I'll tell thee what, lad! I'll make it as
though Bess lent thee her hunder, only thou must give her a writ of
hand for it; and thou shalt have a' the money i' Ripon Bank, and see
if the lawyer wunnot let thee have a share of what he offered thee at
three hunder for two. I dunnot mean for to wrong him; but thou must
get a fair share for the money. At times, I think thou'rt done by
folk; now I wadna have you cheat a bairn of a brass farthing; same
time, I wadna have thee so soft as to be cheated.'</p>

<p>To explain this, it should be told that some of the bills, which
Benjamin had received money from his father to pay, had been altered
so as to cover other and less creditable expenses which the young man
had incurred; and the simple old farmer, who had still much faith
left in him for his boy, was acute enough to perceive that he had
paid above the usual price for the articles he had purchased.</p>

<p>After some hesitation, Benjamin agreed to receive the two hundred,
and promised to employ it to the best advantage in setting himself up
in business. He had, nevertheless, a strange hankering after the
additional fifteen pounds that was left to accumulate in the
stocking. It was his, he thought, as heir to his father; and he soon
lost some of his usual complaisance for Bessy that evening, as he
dwelt on the idea that there was money being laid by for her, and
grudged it to her even in imagination. He thought more of this
fifteen pounds that he was not to have than of all the hardly-earned
and humbly-saved two hundred that he was to come into possession of.
Meanwhile, Nathan was in unusual spirits that evening. He was so
generous and affectionate at heart, that he had an unconscious
satisfaction in having helped two people on the road to happiness by
the sacrifice of the greater part of his property. The very fact of
having trusted his son so largely seemed to make Benjamin more worthy
of trust in his father's estimation. The sole idea he tried to banish
was, that, if all came to pass as he hoped, both Benjamin and Bessy
would be settled far away from Nab-End; but then he had a child-like
reliance that 'God would take care of him and his missus, somehow or
anodder. It wur o' no use looking too far ahead.'</p>

<p>Bessy had to hear many unintelligible jokes from her uncle that
night, for he made no doubt that Benjamin had told her all that had
passed.' whereas the truth was, his son had said never a word to his
cousin on the subject.</p>

<p>When the old couple were in bed, Nathan told his wife of the
promise he had made to his son, and the plan in life which the
advance of the two hundred was to promote. Poor Hester was a little
startled at the sudden change in the destination of the sum, which
she had long thought of with secret pride as money i' th' bank'. But
she was willing enough to part with it, if necessary, for Benjamin.
Only, how such a sum could be necessary, was the puzzle. But even the
perplexity was jostled out of her mind by the overwhelming idea, not
only of 'our Ben' settling in London, but of Bessy going there too as
his wife. This great trouble swallowed up all care about money, and
Hester shivered and sighed all the night through with distress. In
the morning, as Bessy was kneading the bread, her aunt, who had been
sitting by the fire in an unusual manner, for one of her active
habits, said--</p>

<p>'I reckon we maun go to th' shop for our bread; an' that's a thing
I never thought to come to so long as I lived.'</p>

<p>Bessy looked up from her kneading, surprised.</p>

<p>'I'm sure, I'm noan going to cat their nasty stuff. What for do ye
want to get baker's bread, aunt? This dough will rise as high as a
kite in a south wind.'</p>

<p>'I'm not up to kneading as I could do once; it welly breaks my
back; and, when tou'rt off in London, I reckon we maun buy our bread,
first time in my life.'</p>

<p>'I'm not a-goin to London,' said Bessy, kneading away with fresh
resolution, and growing very red, either with the idea or the
exertion.</p>

<p>'But our Ben is going partner wi' a great London lawyer; and thou
know'st he'll not tarry long but what he'll fetch thee.'</p>

<p>'Now, aunt,' said Bessy, stripping her arms of the dough, but
still not looking up, 'if that's all, don't fret yourself Ben will
have twenty minds in his head, afore he settles, eyther in business
or in wedlock. I sometimes wonder,' she said, with increasing
vehemence, 'why I go on thinking on him; for I dunnot think he thinks
on me, when I'm out o' sight. I've a month's mind to try and forget
him this time, when he leaves us--that I have!'</p>

<p>'For shame, wench! and he to be planning and purposing, all for
thy sake! It wur only yesterday as he wur talking to thy uncle, and
mapping it out so clever; only, thou seest, wench, it'll be dree work
for us when both thee and him is gone.'</p>

<p>The old woman began to cry the kind of tearless cry of the aged.
Bessy hastened to comfort her; and the two talked, and grieved, and
hoped, and planned for the days that now were to be, till they ended,
the one in being consoled, the other in being secretly happy.</p>

<p>Nathan and his son came back from Highminster that evening, with
their business transacted in the round-about way which was most
satisfactory to the old man. If he had thought it necessary to take
half as much pains in ascertaining the truth of the plausible details
by which his son bore out the story of the offered partnership, as he
did in trying to get his money conveyed to London in the most secure
manner, it would have been well for him. But he knew nothing of all
this, and acted in the way which satisfied his anxiety best. Hecame
home tired, but content; not in such high spirits as on the night
before, but as easy in his mind as he could be on the eve of his
son's departure. Bessy, pleasantly agitated by her aunt's tale of the
morning of her cousin's true love for her ('what ardently we wish we
long believe') and the plan which was to end in their marriage--end
to her, the woman, at least--looked almost pretty in her bright,
blushing comeliness, and more than once, as she moved about from
kitchen to dairy, Benjamin pulled her towards him, and gave her a
kiss. To all such proceedings the old couple were wilfully blind;
and, as night drew on, every one became sadder and quieter, thinking
of the parting that was to be on the morrow. As the hours slipped
away, Bessy too became subdued; and, by and by, her simple cunning
was exerted to get Benjamin to sit down next his mother, whose very
heart was yearning after him, as Bessy saw. When once her child was
placed by her side, and she had got possession of his hand, the old
woman kept stroking it, and murmuring long unused words of
endearment, such as she had spoken to him while he was yet a little
child. But all this was wearisome to him. As long as he might play
with, and plague, and caress Bessy, he had not been sleepy; but now
he yawned loudly. Bessy could have boxed his cars for not curbing
this gaping; at any rate, he need not have done it so openly--so
almost ostentatiously. His mother was more pitiful.</p>

<p>'Thou'rt tired, my lad!' said she, putting her hand fondly on his
shoulder; but it fell off, as he stood up suddenly, and said--</p>

<p>'Yes, deuced tired! I'm off to bed.' And with a rough, careless
kiss all round, even to Bessy, as if he was 'deuced tired' of playing
the lover, he was gone; leaving the three to gather up their thoughts
slowly, and follow him upstairs.</p>

<p>He seemed almost impatient at them for rising betimes to see him
off the next morning, and made no more of a good-bye than some such
speech as this: 'Well, good folk, when next I see you, I hope you'll
have merrier faces than you have to-day. Why, you might be going to a
funeral; it's enough to scare a man from the place; you look quite
ugly to what you did last night, Bess.'</p>

<p>He was gone; and they turned into the house, and settled to the
long day's work without many words about their loss. They had no time
for unnecessary talking, indeed; for much had been left undone,
during his short visit, that ought to have been done, and they had
now to work double tides. Hard work was their comfort for many a long
day.</p>

<p>For some time Benjamin's letters, if not frequent, were full of
exultant accounts of his well-doing. It is true that the details of
his prosperity were somewhat vague; but the fact was broadly and
unmistakenly stated. Then came longer pauses; shorter letters,
altered in tone. About a year after he had left them, Nathan received
a letter which bewildered and irritated him exceedingly. Something
had gone wrong--what, Benjamin did not say--but the letter ended with
a request that was almost a demand, for the remainder of his father's
savings, whether in the stocking or in the bank. Now, the year had
not been prosperous with Nathan; there had been an epidemic among
cattle, and he had suffered along with his neighbours; and, moreover,
the price of cows, when he had bought some to repair his wasted
stock, was higher than he had ever remembered it before. The fifteen
pounds in the stocking, which Benjamin left, had diminished to little
more than three; and to have that required of him in so peremptory a
manner! Before Nathan imparted the contents of this letter to anyone
(Bessy and her aunt had gone to market in a neighbour's cart that
day), he got pen and ink and paper, and wrote back an ill-spelt, but
very explicit and stem negative. Benjamin had had his portion; and if
he could not make it do, so much the worse for him; his father had no
more to give him. That was the substance of the letter.</p>

<p>The letter was written, directed, and sealed, and given to the
country postman, returning to Highminster after his day's
distribution and collection of letters, before Hester and Bessy came
back from market. It had been a pleasant day of neighbourly meeting
and sociable gossip; prices had been high, and they were in good
spirits--only agreeably tired, and full of small pieces of news. It
was some time before they found out how flatly all their talk fell on
the cars of the stay-at-home listener. But, when they saw that his
depression was caused by something beyond their powers of accounting
for by any little every-day cause, they urged him to tell them what
was the matter. His anger had not gone off. It had rather increased
by dwelling upon it, and he spoke it out in good, resolute terms;
and, long ere he had ended, the two women were as sad, if not as
angry, as himself. Indeed, it was many days before either feeling
wore away in the minds of those who entertained them. Bessy was the
soonest comforted, because she found a vent for her sorrow in action:
action that was half as a kind of compensation for many a sharp word
that she had spoken, when her cousin had done anything to displease
her on his last visit, and half because she believed that he never
could have written such a letter to his father, unless his want of
money had been very pressing and real; though how he could ever have
wanted money so soon, after such a heap of it had been given to him,
was more than she could justly say. Bessy got out all her savings of
little presents of sixpences and shillings, ever since she had been a
child--of all the money she had gained for the eggs of two hens,
called her own; she put the whole together, and it was above two
pounds--two pounds five and seven-pence, to speak accurately--and,
leaving out the penny as a nest-egg for her future savings, she made
up the rest in a little parcel, and sent it, with a note, to
Benjamin's address in London:</p>

<p>'From a well-wisher.</p>

<p>'Dr BENJAMIN,--Unkle has lost 2 cows and a vast of monney. He is a
good deal Angored, but more Troubled. So no more at present. Hopeing
this will finding you well As it leaves us. Tho' lost to Site, To
Memory Dear. Repayment not kneeded.--Your effectonet cousin.</p>

<p>'ELIZABETH ROSE'</p>

<p>When this packet was once fairly sent off, Bessy began to sing
again over her work. She never expected the mere form of
acknowledgement; indeed, she had such faith in the carrier (who took
parcels to York, whence they were forwarded to London by coach), that
she felt sure he would go on purpose to London to deliver anything
intrusted to him, if he had not full confidence in the person,
persons, coach and horses, to whom he committed it. Therefore she was
not anxious that she did not hear of its arrival. 'Giving a thing to
a man as one knows,' said she to herself, 'is a vast different to
poking a thing through a hole into a box, th' inside of which one has
never clapped eyes on; and yet letters get safe, some ways or
another.' (The belief in the infallibility of the post was destined
to a shock before long.) But she had a secret yearning for Benjamin's
thanks, and some of the old words of love that she had been without
so long. Nay, she even thought--when, day after day, week after week,
passed by without a line--that he might be winding up his affairs in
that weary, wasteful London, and coming back to Nab-End to thank her
in person.</p>

<p>One day--her aunt was upstairs, inspecting the summer's make of
cheeses, her uncle out in the fields--the postman brought a letter
into the kitchen to Bessy. A country postman, even now, is not much
pressed for time; and in those days there were but few letters to
distribute, and they were only sent out from Highminster once a week
into the district in which Nab-End was situated; and, on those
occasions, the letter-carrier usually paid morning calls on the
various people for whom he had letters. So, half-standing by the
dresser, half-sitting on it, he began to rummage out his bag.</p>

<p>'It's a queer-like thing I've got for Nathan this time. I am
afraid it will bear ill news in it; for there's 'Dead Letter Office'
stamped on the top of it.'</p>

<p>'Lord save us!' said Bessy, and sat down on the nearest chair, as
white as a sheet. In an instant, however, she was up; and, snatching
the ominous letter out of the man's hands, she pushed him before her
out of the house, and said, 'Be off wi' thee, afore aunt comes down';
and ran past him as hard as she could, till she reached the field
where she expected to find her uncle.</p>

<p>'Uncle,' said she, breathiess, 'what is it? Oh, uncle, speak! Is
he dead?'</p>

<p>Nathan's hands trembled, and his eyes dazzled, 'Take it,' he said,
'and tell me what it is.'</p>

<p>'It's a letter--it's from you to Benjamin, it is--and there's
words written on it, 'Not known at the address given;' so they've
sent it back to the writer--that's you, uncle. Oh, it gave me such a
start, with them nasty words written outside!'</p>

<p>Nathan had taken the letter back into his own hands, and was
turning it over, while he strove to understand what the quick-witted
Bessy had picked up at a glance. But he arrived at a different
conclusion.</p>

<p>'He's dead!' said he. 'The lad is dead, and he never knowed how as
I were sorry I wrote to 'un so sharp. My lad! my lad!' Nathan sat
down on the ground where he stood, and covered his face with his old,
withered hands. The letter returned to him was one which he had
written, with infinite pains and at various times, to tell his child,
in kinder words and at greater length than he had done before, the
reasons why he could not send him the money demanded. And now
Benjamin was dead; nay, the old man immediately jumped to the
conclusion that his child had been starved to death, without money,
in a wild, wide, strange place. All he could say at first was--</p>

<p>'My heart, Bess--my heart is broken!' And he put his hand to his
side, still keeping his shut eyes covered with the other, as though
he never wished to see the light of day again. Bessy was down by his
side in an instant, holding him in her arms, chafing and kissing
him.</p>

<p>'It's noan so bad, uncle; he's not dead; the letter does not say
that, dunnot think it. He's flitted from that lodging, and the lazy
tykes dunna know where to find him; and so they just send y' back th'
letter, instead of trying fra' house to house, as Mark Benson would.
I've alwayds heerd tell on south-country folk for laziness. He's noan
dead, uncle; he's just flitted; and he'll let us know afore long
where he's gotten to. May be, it's a cheaper place; for that lawyer
has cheated him, ye reck'lect, and he'll be trying to live for as
little as he can, that's all, uncle. Dunnot take on so; for it doesna
say he's dead.'</p>

<p>By this time Bessy was crying with agitation, although she firmly
believed in her own view of the case, and had felt the opening of the
ill-favoured letter as a great relief. Presently she began to urge,
both with word and action, upon her uncle, that he should sit no
longer on the damp grass, She pulled him up; for he was very stiff,
and, as he said, 'all shaken to dithers.' She made him walk about,
repeating over and over again her solution of the case, always in the
same words, beginning again and again, 'He's noan dead; it's just
been a flitting,' and so on. Nathan shook his head, and tried to be
convinced; but it was a steady belief in his own heart for all that.
He looked so deathly ill on his return home with Bessy (for she would
not let him go on with his day's work), that his wife made sure he
had taken cold; and he, weary and indifferent to life, was glad to
subside into bed and the rest from exertion which his real bodily
illness gave him. Neither Bessy nor he spoke of the letter again,
even to each other, for many days; and she found means to stop Mark
Benson's tongue and satisfy his kindly curiously, by giving him the
rosy side of her own view of the case.</p>

<p>Nathan got up again, an older man in looks and constitution by ten
years for that week of bed. His wife gave him many a scolding on his
imprudence for sitting down in the wet field, if ever so tired. But
now she, too, was beginning to be uneasy at Benjamin's long-continued
silence. She could not write herself; but she urged her husband many
a time to send a letter to ask for news of her lad. He said nothing
in reply for some time; at length, he told her he would write next
Sunday afternoon. Sunday was his general day for writing, and this
Sunday he meant to go to church for the first time since his illness.
On Saturday he was very persistent, against his wife's wishes (backed
by Bessy as hard as she could), in resolving to go into Highminster
to market. The change would do him good, he said. But he came home
tired, and a little mysterious in his ways. When he went to the
shippon the last thing at night, he asked Bessy to go with him, and
hold the lantern, while he looked at an ailing cow; and, when they
were fairly out of the car-shot of the house, he pulled a little
shop-parcel from his pocket and said--</p>

<p>'Thou'lt put that on ma Sunday hat, wilt 'on, lass? It'll be a bit
on a comfort to me; for I know my lad's dead and gone, though I dunna
speak on it, for fear o' grieving th' old woman and ye.'</p>

<p>'I'll put it on, uncle, if--But he's noan dead.' (Bessy was
sobbing.)</p>

<p>'I know--I know, lass. I dunnot wish other folk to hold my
opinion; but Id like to wear a bit o' crape out o' respect to my boy.
It 'ud have done me good for to have ordered a black coat; but she'd
see if I had na' on my wedding-coat, Sundays, for a' she's losing her
eyesight, poor old wench! But she'll ne'er take notice o' a bit o'
crape. Thou'lt put it on all canny and tidy.'</p>

<p>So Nathan went to church with a strip of crape, as narrow as Bessy
durst venture to make it, round his hat. Such is the
contradictoriness of human nature that, though he was most anxious
his wife should not hear of his conviction that their son was dead,
he was half-hurt that none of his neighbours noticed his sign of
mourning so far as to ask him for whom he wore it.</p>

<p>But after a while, when they never heard a word from or about
Benjamin, the household wonder as to what had become of him grew so
painful and strong, that Nathan no longer kept the idea to himself
Poor Hester, however, rejected it with her whole will, heart, and
soul. She could and would not believe--nothing should make her
believe--that her only child Benjamin had died without some sign of
love or farewell to her. No arguments could shake her in this. She
believed that, if all natural means of communication between her and
him had been cut off at the last supreme moment--if death had come
upon him in an instant, sudden and unexpected--her intense love would
have been supernaturally made conscious of the blank. Nathan at times
tried to feel glad that she should still hope to see the lad again;
but at other moments he wanted her sympathy in his grief, his
self-reproach, his weary wonder as to how and what they had done
wrong in the treatment of their son, that he had been such a care and
sorrow to his parents. Bessy was convinced, first by her aunt, and
then by her uncle--honestly convinced--on both sides of the argument,
and so, for the time, able to sympathise with each. But she lost her
youth in a very few months; she looked set and middle-aged, long
before she ought to have done, and rarely smiled and never sang
again.</p>

<p>All sorts of new arrangements were required by the blow which told
so miserably upon the energies of all the household at Nab-End.
Nathan could no longer go about and direct his two men, taking a good
rum of work himself at busy times. Hester lost her interest in the
dairy; for which, indeed, her increasing loss of sight unfitted her.
Bessy would either do field-work, or attend to the cows and the
shippon, or chum, or make cheese; she did all well, no longer
merrily, but with something of stem cleverness. But she was not sorry
when her uncle, one evening, told her aunt and her that a
neighbouring farmer, job Kirkby, had made him an offer to take so
much of his land off his hands as would leave him only pasture enough
for two cows, and no arable to attend to; while Farmer Kirkby did not
wish to interfere with anything in the house, only would be glad to
use some of the out-building for his Battening cattle.</p>

<p>'We can do wi' Hawky and Daisy; it'll leave us eight or ten pound
o' butter to take to market i' summer time, and keep us fra' thinking
too much, which is what I'm dreading on as I get into years.'</p>

<p>'Ay,' said his wife. 'Thou'll not have to go so far a-field, if
it's only the Aster-Toft as is on thy hands. And Bess will have to
gie up her pride i' cheese, and tak' to making cream-butter. I'd
allays a fancy for trying at cream-butter; but th' whey had to be
used; else, where I come fra', they'd never ha' looked near
whey-butter.'</p>

<p>When Hester was left alone with Bessy, she said, in allusion to
this change of plan--</p>

<p>'I'm thankful to the Lord that it is as it is; for I were allays
afeared Nathan would have to gie up the house and farm altogether,
and then the lad would na know where to find us when he came back
fra' Merikay. He's gone there for to make his fortune, I'll be bound.
Keep up thy heart, lass, he'll be home some day; and have sown his
wild oats. Eh! but thatten's a pretty story i' the Gospel about the
Prodigal, who'd to cat the pigs' vittle at one time, but ended i'
clover in his father's house. And I'm sure our Nathan 'll be ready to
forgive him, and love him, and make much of him--may be, a deal more
nor me, who never gave in to 's death. It'll be liken to a
resurrection to our Nathan.'</p>

<p>Farmer Kirkby, then, took by far the greater part of the land
belonging to Nab-End Farm; and the work about the rest, and about the
two remaining cows, was easily done by three pairs of willing hands,
with a little occasional assistance. The Kirkby family were pleasant
enough to have to deal with. There was a son, a stiff, grave
bachelor, who was very particular and methodical about his work, and
rarely spoke to any one. But Nathan took it into his head that John
Kirkby was looking after Bessy, and was a good deal troubled in his
mind in consequence; for it was the first time he had to face the
effects of his belief in his son's death; and he discovered, to his
own surprise, that he had not that implicit faith which would make it
easy for him to look upon Bessy as the wife of another man than the
one to whom she had been betrothed in her youth. As, however, John
Kirkby seemed in no hurry to make his intentions (if indeed he had
any) clear to Bessy, it was only now and then that his jealousy on
behalf of his lost son seized upon Nathan.</p>

<p>But people, old, and in deep hopeless sorrow, grow irritable at
times, however they may repent and struggle against their
irritability. There were days when Bessy had to bear a good deal from
her uncle; but she loved him so dearly and respected him so much,
that, high as her temper was to all other people, she never returned
him a rough or impatient word. And she had a reward in the conviction
of his deep, true affection for her, and her aunt's entire and most
sweet dependence upon her.</p>

<p>One day, however--it was near the end of November--Bessy had had a
good deal to bear, that seemed more than usually unreasonable, on the
part of her uncle. The truth was, that one of Kirkby's cows was ill,
and John Kirkby was a good deal about in the farmyard; Bessy was
interested about the animal, and had helped in preparing a mash over
their own fire, that had to be given warm to the sick creature. If
John had been out of the way, there would have been no one more
anxious about the affair than Nathan: both because he was naturally
kind-hearted and neighbourly, and also because he was rather proud of
his reputation for knowledge in the diseases of cattle. But because
John was about, and Bessy helping a little in what had to be done,
Nathan would do nothing, and chose to assume that nothing to think on
ailed th' beast; but lads and lasses were allays fain to be feared on
something.' Now John was upwards of forty, and Bessy nearly
eight-and-twenty; so the terms lads and lasses did not exactly apply
to their case.</p>

<p>When Bessy brought the milk in from their own cows, towards
half-past five o'clock, Nathan bade her make the doors, and not be
running out i' the dark and cold about other folks' business; and,
though Bessy was a little surprised and a good deal annoyed at his
tone, she sat down to her supper without making a remonstrance. It
had long been Nathan's custom to look out the last thing at night, to
see 'what mak' o' weather it wur'; and when, towards half-past eight,
he got his stick and went out--two or three steps from the door,
which opened into the house-place where they were sitting--Hester put
her hand on her niece's shoulder and said--</p>

<p>'He's gotten a touch o' rheumatics, as twinges him and makes him
speak so sharp. I didna like to ask thee afore him, but how's yon
poor beast?'</p>

<p>'Very ailing, belike. John Kirkby wur off for th' cow-doctor when
I cam in. I reckon they'll have to stop up wi 't a' night.'</p>

<p>Since their sorrows, her uncle had taken to reading a chapter in
the Bible aloud, the last thing at night. He could not read fluently,
and often hesitated long over a word, which he miscalled at length;
but the very fact of opening the book seemed to soothe those old
bereaved parents; for it made them feel quiet and safe in the
presence of God, and took them out of the cares and troubles of this
world into that futurity which, however dim and vague, was to their
faithful hearts as a sure and certain rest. This little quiet
time--Nathan sitting with his hem spectacles, the tallow candle
between him and the Bible throwing a strong light on his reverent,
earnest face; Hester sitting on the other side of the fire, her head
bowed in attentive listening; now and then shaking it, and moaning a
little, but when a promise came, or any good tidings of great joy,
saying 'Amen' with fervour; Bessy by her aunt, perhaps her mind a
little wandering to some household cares, or it might be on thoughts
of those who were absent--this little quiet pause, I say, was
grateful and soothing to this household, as a lullaby to a tired
child. But this night, Bessy, sitting opposite to the long, low
window, only shaded by a few geraniums that grew in the sill, and to
the door alongside that window through which her uncle had passed not
a quarter of an hour before, saw the wooden latch of the door gently
and almost noiselessly lifted up, as if some one were trying it from
the outside.</p>

<p>She was startled, and watched again, intently; but it was
perfectly still now. She thought it must have been that it had not
fallen into its proper place, when her uncle had come in and locked
the door. It was just enough to make her uncomfortable, no more; and
she almost persuaded herself it must have been fancy. Before going
upstairs, however, she went to the window, to look out into the
darkness; but all was still. Nothing to be seen; nothing to be heard.
So the three went quietly upstairs to bed.</p>

<p>The house was little better than a cottage. The front door opened
on a house-place, over which was the old couple's bed-room. To the
left, as you entered this pleasant house-place, and at close right
angles with the entrance, was a door that led into the small parlour,
which was Hester's and Bessy's pride, although not half as
comfortable as the house-place, and never on any occasion used as a
sitting-room. There were shells and bunches of honesty in the
fireplace; the best chest of drawers, and a company set of
gaudy-coloured china, and a bright common carpet on the floor; but
all failed to give it the aspect of the homely comfort and delicate
cleanliness of the house-place. Over this parlour was the bedroom
which Benjamin had slept in when a boy, when at home. It was kept,
still, in a kind of readiness for him. The bed was yet there, in
which none had slept since he had last done, eight or nine years ago;
and every now and then a warming-pan was taken quietly and silently
up by his old mother, and the bed thoroughly aired. But this she did
in her husband's absence, and without saying a word to anyone; nor
did Bessy offer to help her, though her eyes often filled with tears,
as she saw her aunt still going through the hopeless service. But the
room had become a receptacle for all unused things; and there was
always a corner of it appropriated to the winter's store of apples.
To the left of the house-place, as you stood facing the fire, on the
side opposite to the window and outer door, were two other doors; the
one on the right led into a kind of back kitchen, and had a lean-to
roof, and a door opening on to the farm-yard and back-premises; the
left-hand door gave on the stairs, underneath which was a closet, in
which various house-hold treasures were kept; and beyond that was the
dairy, over which Bessy slept, her little chamber window opening just
above the sloping roof of the back-kitchen. There were neither blinds
nor shutters to any of the windows, either upstairs or down; the
house was built of stone; and there was heavy framework of the same
material around the little casement windows, and the long, low window
of the house-place was divided by what, in grander dwellings, would
be called mullions.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock this night of which I am speaking, all had gone
upstairs to bed; it was even later than usual, for the burning of
candles was regarded so much in the light of an extravagance, that
the household kept early hours even for country-folk. But, somehow,
this evening, Bessy could not sleep; although in general she was in
deep slumber five minutes after her head touched the pillow. Her
thoughts ran on the chances for John Kirkby's cow, and a little fear
lest the disorder might be epidemic and spread to their own cattle.
Across all these homely cares came a vivid, uncomfortable
recollection of the way in which the door-latch went up and down,
without any sufficient agency to account for it. She felt more sure
now than she had done downstairs, that it was a real movement, and no
effect of her imagination. She wished that it had not happened just
when her uncle was reading, that she might at once have gone quick to
the door, and convinced herself of the cause. As it was, her thoughts
ran uneasily on the supernatural; and thence to Benjamin, her dear
cousin and playfellow, her early lover. She had long given him up as
lost for ever to her, if not actually dead; but this very giving him
up for ever involved a free, full forgiveness of all his wrongs to
her. She thought tenderly of him, as of one who might have been led
astray in his later years, but who existed rather in her recollection
as the innocent child, the spirited lad, the handsome, dashing young
man. If John Kirkby's quiet attentions had ever betrayed his wishes
to Bessy--if indeed he ever had any wishes on the subject--her first
feeling would have been to compare his weather-beaten, middle-aged
face and figure with the face and figure she remembered well, but
never more expected to see in this life. So thinking, she became very
restless, and weary of bed, and, after long tossing and turning,
ending in a belief that she should never get to sleep at all that
night, she went off soundly and suddenly.</p>

<p>As suddenly she was wide awake, sitting up in bed, listening to
some noise that must have awakened her, but which was not repeated
for some time. Surely it was in her uncle's room--her uncle was up;
but, for a minute or two, there was no further sound. Then she heard
him open his door, and go downstairs, with hurried, stumbling steps.
She now thought that her aunt must be ill, and hastily sprang out of
bed, and was putting on her petticoat with hurried, trembling hands,
and had just opened her chamber door, when she heard the front door
undone, and a scuffle, as of the feet of several people, and many
rude, passionate words, spoken hoarsely below the breath. Quick as
thought she understood it all--the house was lonely--her uncle had
the reputation of being well-to-do--they had pretended to be belated,
and had asked their way or something. What a blessing that John
Kirkby's cow was sick, for there were several men watching with him!
She went back, opened her window, squeezed herself out, slid down the
lean-to roof, and ran barefoot and breathless to the shippon--</p>

<p>'John, John, for the love of God, come quick; there's robbers in
the house, and uncle and aunt 'll be murdered!' she whispered, in
terrified accents, through the closed and barred shippon door. In a
moment it was undone, and John and the cow-doctor stood there, ready
to act, if they but understood her rightly. Again she repeated her
words, with broken, half-unintelligible explanations of what she as
yet did not rightly understand.</p>

<p>'Front door is open, say'st thou?' said John, arming himself with
a pitchfork, while the cow-doctor took some other implement. 'Then I
reckon we'd best make for that way o' getting into th' house, and
catch 'em all in a trap.'</p>

<p>'Run! run!' was all Bessy could say, taking hold of John Kirkby's
arm, and pulling him along with her. Swiftly did the three run to the
house round the corner, and in at the open front-door. The men
carried the hem lantern they had been using in the shippon; and, by
the sudden oblong light that it threw, Bessy saw the principal object
of her anxiety, her uncle, lying stunned and helpless on the
kitchen-floor. Her first thought was for him; for she had no idea
that her aunt was in any immediate danger, although she heard the
noise of feet, and fierce, subdued voices upstairs.</p>

<p>'Make th' door behind us, lass. We'll not let 'em escape!' said
brave John Kirkby, dauntless in a good cause, though he knew not how
many there might be above. The cow-doctor fastened and locked the
door, saying, 'There!' in a defiant tone, as he put the key in his
pocket. It was to be a struggle for life or death, or, at any rate,
for effectual capture or desperate escape. Bessy kneeled down by her
uncle, who did not speak or give any sign of consciousness. Bessy
raised his head by drawing a pillow off the settle, and putting it
under him; she longed to go for water into the back kitchen, but the
sound of a violent struggle, and of heavy blows, and of low, hard
curses spoken through closed teeth, and muttered passion, as though
breath were too much needed for action to be wasted in speech, kept
her still and quiet by her uncle's side in the kitchen, where the
darkness might almost be felt, so thick and deep was it. Once--in a
pause of her own heart's beating--a sudden terror came over her; she
perceived, in that strange way in which the presence of a living
creature forces itself on our consciousness in the darkest room, that
someone was near her, keeping as still as she. It was not the poor
old man's breathing that she heard, nor the radiation of his presence
that she felt; someone else was in the kitchen; another robber,
perhaps, left to guard the old man, with murderous intent if his
consciousness returned. Now Bessy was fully aware that
self-preservation would keep her terrible companion quiet, as there
was no motive for his betraying himself stronger than the desire of
escape; any effort for which he, the unseen witness, must know would
be rendered abortive by the fact of the door being locked.</p>

<p>Yet, with the knowledge that he was there, close to her still,
silent as the grave--with fearful, it might be deadly, unspoken
thoughts in his heart--possibly even with keener and stronger sight
than hers, as longer accustomed to the darkness, able to discern her
figure and posture, and glaring at her like some wild beast--Bessy
could not fail to shrink from the vision that her fancy presented!
And still the struggle went on upstairs; feet slipping, blows
sounding, and the wrench of intentioned aims, the strong gasps for
breath, as the wrestlers paused for an instant. In one of these
pauses, Bessy felt conscious of a creeping movement close to her,
which ceased when the noise of the strife above died away, and was
resumed when it again began. She was aware of it by some subtle
vibration of the air, rather than by touch or sound. She was sure
that he who had been close to her one minute as she knelt, was, the
next, passing stealthily towards the inner door which led to the
staircase. She thought he was going to join and strengthen his
accomplices, and, with a great cry, she sprang after him; but just as
she came to the doorway, through which some dim portion of light from
the upper chambers came, she saw one man thrown downstairs, with such
violence that he fell almost at her very feet, while the dark,
creeping figure glided suddenly away to the left, and as suddenly
entered the closet beneath the stairs. Bessy had no time to wonder as
to his purpose in so doing, whether he had at first designed to aid
his accomplices in their desperate fight or not. He was an enemy, a
robber, that was all she knew, and she sprang to the door of the
closet, and in a trice had locked it on the outside. And then she
stood frightened, panting in that dark corner, sick with terror lest
the man who lay before her was either John Kirkby or the cow-doctor.
If it were either of those friendly two, what would become of the
other--of her uncle, her aunt, herself? But, in a very few minutes,
this wonder was ended; her two defenders came slowly and heavily down
the stairs, dragging with them a man, fierce, sullen,
despairing--disabled with terrible blows, which had made his face one
bloody, swollen mass. As for that, neither John nor the cow-doctor
was much more presentable. One of them bore the lantern in his teeth;
for all their strength was taken up by the weight of the fellow they
were bearing.</p>

<p>'Take care,' said Bessy, from her corner; 'there's a chap just
beneath your feet. I dunno know if he's dead or alive; and uncle lies
on the floor just beyond.'</p>

<p>They stood still on the stairs for a moment, just then the robber
they had thrown downstairs stirred and moaned.</p>

<p>'Bessy,' said John, 'run off to th' stable and fetch ropes and
gearing for us to bind 'em; and we'll rid the house on 'em, and thou
can'st go see after th' oud folks, who need it sadly.'</p>

<p>Bessy was back in a very few minutes. When she came in, there was
more light in the house-place, for someone had stirred up the raked
fire.</p>

<p>'That felly makes as though his leg were broken,' said John,
nodding towards the man still lying on the ground. Bessy felt almost
sorry for him as they handled him--not over-gently--and bound him,
only half-conscious, as hardly and tightly as they had done his
fierce, surly companion. She even felt sorry for his evident agony,
as they turned him over and over, that she ran to get him a cup of
water to moisten his lips.</p>

<p>'I'm loth to leave yo' with him alone,' said John, 'though I'm
thinking his leg is broken for sartin, and he can't stir, even if he
comes to hissel, to do yo' any harm. But we'll just take off this
chap, and mak sure of him, and then one on us 'll come back to yo',
and we can, may be, find a gate or so for yo' to get shut on him o'
th' house. This felly's made safe enough, I'll be bound,' said he,
looking at the burglar, who stood, bloody and black, with fell hatred
on his sullen face. His eye caught Bessy's, as hers fell on him with
dread so evident that it made him smile; and the look and the smile
prevented the words from being spoken which were on Bessy's lips.</p>

<p>She dared not tell, before him, that an able-bodied accomplice
still remained in the house; lest, somehow, the door which kept him a
prisoner should be broken open and the fight renewed. So she only
said to John, as he was leaving the house--</p>

<p>'Thou'll not be long away, for I'm afeared of being left wi' this
man.'</p>

<p>'He'll noan do thee harm,' said John.</p>

<p>'No! but I'm feared lest he should die. And there's uncle and
aunt. Come back soon, John!'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay!' said he, half-pleased; 'I'll be back, never fear
me.'</p>

<p>So Bessy shut the door after them, but did not lock it, for fear
of mischances in the house, and went once more to her uncle, whose
breathing, by this time, was easier than when she had first returned
into the house-place with John and the doctor. By the light of the
fire, too, she could now see that he had received a blow on the head,
which was probably the occasion of his stupor. Round this wound,
which was bleeding pretty freely, Bessy put cloths dipped in cold
water; and then, leaving him for a time, she lighted a candle, and
was about to go upstairs to her aunt, when, just as she was passing
the bound and disabled robber, she heard her name softly, urgently
called--</p>

<p>'Bessy, Bessy!' At first the voice sounded so close that she
thought it must be the unconscious wretch at her feet. But, once
again, that voice thrilled through her-</p>

<p>'Bessy, Bessy! for God's sake, let me out!'</p>

<p>She went to the stair-closet door, and tried to speak, but could
not, her heart beat so terribly. Again, close to her ear--</p>

<p>'Bessy, Bessy! they'll be back directly; let me out, I say! For
God's sake, let me out!' And he began to kick violently against the
panels.</p>

<p>'Hush! hush!' she said, sick with a terrible dread, yet with a
will strongly resisting her conviction. 'Who are you?' But she
knew--knew quite well.</p>

<p>'Benjamin.' An oath. 'Let me out, I say, and I'll be off, and out
of England by to-morrow night, never to come back, and you'll have
all my father's money.'</p>

<p>'D'ye think I care for that?' said Bessy vehemently, feeling with
trembling hands for the lock; 'I wish there was noan such a thing as
money i' the world, afore yo'd come to this. There, yo 're free, and
I charge yo' never to let me see your face again. I'd ne'er ha' let
yo' loose but for fear o' breaking their hearts, if yo' hanna killed
him already.' But, before she had ended her speech, he was gone--off
into the black darkness, leaving the door open wide. With a new
terror in her mind, Bessy shut it afresh--shut it and bolted it this
time. Then she sat down on the first chair, and relieved her soul by
giving a great and exceeding bitter cry. But she knew it was no time
for giving way; and, lifting herself up with as much effort as if
each of her limbs was a heavy weight, she went into the back kitchen,
and took a drink of cold water. To her surprise, she heard her
uncle's voice saying feebly--</p>

<p>'Carry me up, and lay me by her.'</p>

<p>But Bessy could not carry him; she could only help his faint
exertions to walk upstairs; and, by the time he was there, sitting
panting on the first chair she could find, John Kirkby and Atkinson
returned. John came up now to her aid. Her aunt lay across the bed in
a fainting-fit, and her uncle sat in so utterly broken-down a state
that Bessy feared immediate death for both. But John cheered her up,
and lifted the old man into his bed again; and, while Bessy tried to
compose poor Hester's limbs into a position of rest, John went down
to hunt about for the little store of gin which was always kept in a
corner cupboard against emergencies.</p>

<p>'They've had a sore fright,' said he, shaking his head, as he
poured a little gin and hot water into their mouths with a tea-spoon,
while Bessy chafed their cold feet; 'and it and the cold have been
welly too much for 'em, poor old folk!'</p>

<p>He looked tenderly at them, and Bessy blessed him in her heart for
that look.</p>

<p>'I maun be off. I sent Atkinson up to th' farm for to bring down
Bob, and Jack came wi' him back to th' shippon, for to look after
t'other man. He began blackguarding us all round, so Bob and Jack
were gagging him wi' bridles when I left.'</p>

<p>'Ne'er give heed to what he says,' cried poor Bessy, a new panic
besetting her. 'Folks o' his sort are allays for dragging other folk
into their mischief. I'm right glad he were well gagged.'</p>

<p>'Well! but what I were saying were this: Atkinson and me will take
t'other chap, who seems quiet enough, to th' shippon, and it'll be
one piece o' work for to mind them and the cow; and I'll saddle t'
old bay mare and ride for constables and doctor fra' Highminster.
I'll bring Dr Preston up to see Nathan and Hester first; and then, I
reckon, th' broken-legged chap down below must have his turn for all
as he's met wi' his misfortunes in a wrong line o' life.'</p>

<p>'Ay!' said Bessy. 'We maun ha' the doctor sure enough, for look at
them how they lie--like two stone statues on a church monument, so
sad and solemn!'</p>

<p>'There's a look o' sense come back into their faces though, sin'
they supped that gin-and-water. I'd keep on a-bathing his head and
giving them a sup on't fra' time to time, if I was you, Bessy.'</p>

<p>Bessy followed him downstairs, and lighted the men out of the
house. She dared not light them carrying their burden even, until
they passed round the corner of the house; so strong was her fearful
conviction that Benjamin was lurking near, seeking again to enter.
She rushed back into the kitchen, bolted and barred the door, and
pushed the end of the dresser against it, shutting her eyes as she
passed the uncurtained window, for fear of catching a glimpse of a
white face pressed against the glass, and gazing at her. The poor old
couple lay quiet and speechless, although Hester's position had
slightly altered: she had turned a little on her side towards her
husband, and had laid one shrivelled arm around his neck. But he was
just as Bessy had left him, with the wet cloths around his head, his
eyes not wanting in a certain intelligence, but solemn, and
unconscious to all that was passing around as the eyes of death.</p>

<p>His wife spoke a little from time to time--said a word of thanks,
perhaps, or so; but he, never. All the rest of that terrible night,
Bessy tended the poor old couple with constant care, her own heart so
stunned and bruised in its feelings that she went about her pious
duties almost like one in a dream. The November morning was long in
coming; nor did she perceive any change, either for the worse or the
better, before the doctor came, about eight o'clock. John Kirkby
brought him; and was full of the capture of the two burglars.</p>

<p>As far as Bessy could make out, the participation of that
unnatural Third was unknown. It was a relief, almost sickening in the
revulsion it gave her from her terrible fear, which now she felt had
haunted and held possession of her all night long, and had, in fact,
paralysed her from thinking. Now she felt and thought with acute and
feverish vividness, owing, no doubt, in part, to the sleepless night
she had passed. She felt almost sure that her uncle (possibly her
aunt, too) had recognised Benjamin; but there was a faint chance that
they had not done so, and wild horses should never tear the secret
from her, nor should any inadvertent word betray the fact that there
had been a third person concerned. As to Nathan, he had never uttered
a word. It was her aunt's silence that made Bessy fear lest Hester
knew, somehow, that her son was concerned.</p>

<p>The doctor examined them both closely; looked hard at the wound on
Nathan's head; asked questions which Hester answered shortly and
unwillingly, and Nathan not at all--shutting his eyes, as if even the
sight of a stranger was pain to him. Bessy replied, in their stead,
to all that she could answer respecting their state, and followed the
doctor downstairs with a beating heart. When they came into the
house-place, they found John had opened the outer door to let in some
fresh air, had brushed the hearth and made up the fire, and put the
chairs and table in their right places. He reddened a little, as
Bessy's eye fell upon his swollen and battered face, but tried to
smile it off in a dry kind of way--</p>

<p>'Yo' see, I'm an ould bachelor, and I just thought as I'd redd up
things a bit. How dun yo' find 'em, doctor?'</p>

<p>'Well, the poor old couple have had a terrible shock. I shall send
them some soothing medicine to bring down the pulse, and a lotion for
the old man's head. It is very well it bled so much; there might have
been a good deal of inflammation.' And so he went on, giving
directions to Bessy for keeping them quietly in bed through the day.
From these directions she gathered that they were not, as she had
feared all night long, near to death. The doctor expected them to
recover, though they would require care. She almost wished it had
been otherwise, and that they, and she too, might have just lain down
to their rest in the churchyard--so cruel did life seem to her; so
dreadful the recollection of that subdued voice of the hidden robber
smiting her with recognition.</p>

<p>All this time, John was getting things ready for breakfast, with
something of the handiness of a woman. Bessy half-resented his
officiousness in pressing Dr Preston to have a cup of tea, she did so
want him to be gone and leave her alone with her thoughts. She did
not know that all was done for love of her; that the hard-featured,
short-spoken John was thinking all the time how ill and miserable she
looked, and trying with tender artifices to make it incumbent upon
her sense of hospitality to share Dr Preston's meal.</p>

<p>'I've seen as the cows is milked,' said he, 'yourn and all; and
Atkinson's brought ours round fine. Whatten a marcy it were as she
were sick this very night! Yon two chaps 'ud ha' made short work
on't, if yo' hadna fetched us in; and, as it were, we had a sore
tussle. One on 'em 'll bear the marks on't to his dying day, wunnot
he, doctor?'</p>

<p>'He'll barely have his leg well enough to stand his trial at York
Assizes; they're coming off in a fortnight from now.'</p>

<p>'Ay, and that reminds me, Bessy, yo'll have to go witness before
Justice Royds. Constables bade me tell yo' and gie yo' this summons.
Dunnot be feared: it will not be a long job, though I'm not saying as
it'll be a pleasant one. Yo'll have to answer questions as to how,
and all about it; and Jane' (his sister) 'will come and stop wi' th'
oud folks; and I'll drive yo' in the shandry.'</p>

<p>No one knew why Bessy's colour blenched, and her eye clouded. No
one knew how she apprehended lest she should have to say that
Benjamin had been of the gang; if indeed, in some way, the law had
not followed on his heels quick enough to catch him.</p>

<p>But that trial was spared her; she was warned by John to answer
questions, and say no more than was necessary, for fear of making her
story less clear; and, as she was known, by character at least, to
justice Royds and his clerk, they made the examination as little
formidable as possible.</p>

<p>When all was over, and John was driving her back again, he
expressed his rejoicing that there would be evidence enough to
convict the men, without summoning Nathan and Hester to identify
them. Bessy was so tired that she hardly understood what an escape it
was; how far greater than even her companion understood.</p>

<p>Jane Kirkby stayed with her for a week or more, and was an
unspeakable comfort. Otherwise she sometimes thought she should have
gone mad, with the face of her uncle always reminding her, in its
stony expression of agony, of that fearful night. Her aunt was softer
in her sorrow, as became one of her faithful and pious nature; but it
was easy to see how her heart bled inwardly. She recovered her
strength sooner than her husband; but, as she recovered, the doctor
perceived the rapid approach of total blindness. Every day, nay,
every hour of the day, that Bessy dared, without fear of exciting
their suspicions of her knowledge, she told them, as she had
anxiously told them at first, that only two men, and those perfect
strangers, had been discovered as being concerned in the burglary.
Her uncle would never have asked a question about it, even if she had
withheld all information respecting the affair; but she noticed the
quick, watching, waiting glance of his eye, whenever she returned
from any person or place where she might have been supposed to gain
intelligence if Benjamin were suspected or caught: and she hastened
to relieve the old man's anxiety, by always telling all that she had
heard; thankful that, as the days passed on, the danger she sickened
to think of grew less and less.</p>

<p>Day by day, Bessy had ground for thinking that her aunt knew more
than she had apprehended at first. There was something so very humble
and touching in Hester's blind way of feeling about for her
husband--stern, woe-begone Nathan--and mutely striving to console him
in the deep agony of which Bessy learnt, from this loving, piteous
manner, that her aunt was conscious. Her aunt's face looked blankly
up into his, tears slowly running down from her sightless eyes; while
from time to time, when she thought herself unheard by any save him,
she would repeat such texts as she had heard at church in happier
days, and which she thought, in her true, simple piety, might tend to
console him. Yet, day by day, her aunt grew more and more sad.</p>

<p>Three or four days before assize-time, two summonses to attend the
trial at York were sent to the old people. Neither Bessy, nor John,
nor Jane, could understand this: for their own notices had come long
before, and they had been told that their evidence would be enough to
convict.</p>

<p>But, alas! the fact was, that the lawyer employed to defend the
prisoners had heard from them that there was a third person engaged,
and had heard who that third person was; and it was this advocate's
business to diminish, if possible, the guilt of his clients, by
proving that they were but tools in the hands of one who had, from
his superior knowledge of the premises and the daily customs of the
inhabitants, been the originator and planner of the whole affair. To
do this, it was necessary to have the evidence of the parents, who,
as the prisoners had said, must have recognised the voice of the
young man, their son. For no one knew that Bessy, too, could have
borne witness to his having been present; and, as it was supposed
that Benjamin had escaped out of England, there was no exact betrayal
of him on the part of his accomplices.</p>

<p>Wondering, bewildered, and weary, the old couple reached York, in
company with John and Bessy, on the eve of the day of the trial.
Nathan was still so self-contained that Bessy could never guess what
had been passing in his mind. He was almost passive under his old
wife's trembling caresses. He seemed hardly conscious of them, so
rigid was his demeanour.</p>

<p>She, Bessy feared at times, was becoming childish; for she had
evidently so great and anxious a love for her husband, that her
memory seemed going in her endeavours to melt the stoniness of his
aspect and manners; she appeared occasionally to have forgotten why
he was so changed, in her piteous little attempts to bring him back
to his former self.</p>

<p>'They'll, for sure, never torture them, when they see what old
folks they are!' cried Bessy, on the morning of the trial, a dim fear
looming over her mind. 'They'll never be so cruel, for sure?'</p>

<p>But 'for sure' it was so. The barrister looked up at the judge,
almost apologetically, as he saw how hoary-headed and woeful an old
man was put into the witness-box, when the defence came on, and
Nathan Huntroyd was called on for his evidence.</p>

<p>'It is necessary, on behalf of my clients, my lord, that I should
pursue a course which, for all other reasons, I deplore.'</p>

<p>'Go on!' said the judge. 'What is right and legal must be done.'
But, an old man himself, he covered his quivering mouth with his hand
as Nathan, with grey, unmoved face, and solemn, hollow eyes, placing
his two hands on each side of the witness-box, prepared to give his
answers to questions, the nature of which he was beginning to
foresee, but would not shrink from replying to truthfully; 'the very
stones' (as he said to himself, with a kind of dulled sense of the
Eternal justice) 'rise up against such a sinner.'</p>

<p>'Your name is Nathan Huntroyd, I believe?'</p>

<p>'It is.'</p>

<p>'You live at Nab-End Farm?'</p>

<p>'I do.'</p>

<p>'Do you remember the night of November the twelfth?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'You were awakened that night by some noise, I believe. What was
it?'</p>

<p>The old man's eyes fixed themselves upon his questioner with the
look of a creature brought to bay. That look the barrister never
forgets. It will haunt him till his dying day.</p>

<p>'It was a throwing-up of stones against our window.'</p>

<p>'Did you hear it at first?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'What awakened you, then?'</p>

<p>'She did.'</p>

<p>'And then you both heard the stones. Did you hear anything
else?'</p>

<p>A long pause. Then a low, clear 'Yes.'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Our Benjamin asking us for to let him in. She said as it were
him, leastways.'</p>

<p>'And you thought it was him, did you not?'</p>

<p>'I told her' (this rime in a louder voice) 'for to get to sleep,
and not be thinking that every drunken chap as passed by were our
Benjamin, for that he were dead and gone.'</p>

<p>'And she?'</p>

<p>'She said as though she'd heerd our Benjamin, afore she were welly
awake, axing for to be let in. But I bade her ne'er heed her dreams,
but turn on her other side and get to sleep again.'</p>

<p>'And did she?'</p>

<p>A long pause--judge, jury, bar, audience, all held their breath.
At length Nathan said--</p>

<p>'No!'</p>

<p>'What did you do then? (My lord, I am compelled to ask these
painful questions.)'</p>

<p>'I saw she wadna be quiet: she had allays thought he would come
back to us, like the Prodigal i' th' Gospels.' (His voice choked a
little; but he tried to make it steady, succeeded, and went on.) 'She
said, if I wadna get up, she would; and just then I heerd a voice.
I'm not quite mysel', gentlemen--I've been ill and i' bed, an' it
makes me trembling-like. Someone said, "Father, mother, I'm here,
starving i' the cold--wunnot yo' get up and let me in?"'</p>

<p>'And that voice was--?'</p>

<p>'It were like our Benjamin's. I see whatten yo're driving at, sir,
and I'll tell yo' truth, though it kills me to speak it. I dunnot say
it were our Benjamin as spoke, mind yo'--I only say it were
like'--</p>

<p>'That's all I want, my good fellow. And on the strength of that
entreaty, spoken in your son's voice, you went down and opened the
door to these two prisoners at the bar, and to a third man?'</p>

<p>Nathan nodded assent, and even that counsel was too merciful to
force him to put more into words.</p>

<p>'Call Hester Huntroyd.'</p>

<p>An old woman, with a face of which the eyes were evidently blind,
with a sweet, gentle, careworn face, came into the witness-box, and
meekly curtseyed to the presence of those whom she had been taught to
respect--a presence she could not see.</p>

<p>There was something in her humble, blind aspect, as she stood
waiting to have something done to her--what her poor troubled mind
hardly knew--that touched all who saw her, inexpressibly. Again the
counsel apologised, but the judge could not reply in words; his face
was quivering all over, and the jury looked uneasily at the
prisoner's counsel. That gentleman saw that he might go too far, and
send their sympathies off on the other side; but one or two questions
he must ask. So, hastily recapitulating much that he had learned from
Nathan, he said, 'You believed it was your son's voice asking to be
let in?'</p>

<p>'Ay! Our Benjamin came home, I'm sure; choose where he is
gone.'</p>

<p>She turned her head about, as if listening for the voice of her
child, in the hushed silence of the court.</p>

<p>'Yes; he came home that night--and your husband went down to let
him in?'</p>

<p>'Well! I believe he did. There was a great noise of folk
downstair.'</p>

<p>'And you heard your son Benjamin's voice among the others?'</p>

<p>'Is it to do him harm, sir?' asked she, her face growing more
intelligent and intent on the business in hand.</p>

<p>'That is not my object in questioning you. I believe he has left
England; so nothing you can say will do him any harm. You heard your
son's voice, I say?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir. For sure I did.'</p>

<p>'And some men came upstairs into your room? What did they
say?'</p>

<p>'They axed where Nathan kept his stocking.'</p>

<p>'And you--did you tell them?'</p>

<p>'No, sir, for I knew Nathan would not like me to.'</p>

<p>'What did you do then?'</p>

<p>A shade of reluctance came over her face, as if she began to
perceive causes and consequences.</p>

<p>'I just screamed on Bessy--that's my niece, sir.'</p>

<p>'And you heard someone shout out from the bottom of the
stairs?'</p>

<p>She looked piteously at him, but did not answer.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen of the jury, I wish to call your particular attention
to this fact; she acknowledges she heard someone shout--some third
person, you observe--shout out to the two above. What did he say?
That is the last question I shall trouble you with. What did the
third person, left behind, downstairs, say?'</p>

<p>Her face worked--her mouth opened two or three times as if to
speak--she stretched out her arms imploringly; but no word came, and
she fell back into the arms of those nearest to her. Nathan forced
himself forward into the witness-box--</p>

<p>'My Lord judge, a woman bore ye, as I reckon; it', a cruel shame
to serve a mother so. It wur my son, my only child, as called out for
us t' open door, and who shouted out for to hold th' oud woman's
throat if she did na stop her noise, when hoo'd fain ha' cried for
her niece to help. And now yo've truth, and a' th' truth, and I'll
leave yo' to th' judgement o' God for th' way yo've getten at
it.'</p>

<p>Before night the mother was stricken with paralysis, and lay on
her death-bed. But the broken-hearted go Home, to be comforted of
God.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4"></a>Crowley Castle</h2>

<p>Sir Mark Crowley was the last baronet of his name, and it is now
nearly a century since he died. Last year I visited the ruins of his
great old Norman castle; and loitered in the village near, where I
heard some of the particulars of the following tale from old
inhabitants, who had heard them from their fathers; no further
back.</p>

<p>We drove from our little sea-bathing place, in Sussex, to see the
massive ruins of Crowley Castle, which is the show-excursion of
Merton. We had to alight at a field gate: the road further on being
too bad for the slightly-built carriage, or the poor tired Merton
horse: and we walked for about a quarter of a mile through uneven
ground, which had once been an Italian garden; and then we came to a
bridge over a dry moat, and went over the groove of a portcullis that
had once closed the massive entrance, into an empty space surrounded
by thick walls, draperied with ivy, unroofed, and open to the sky. We
could judge of the beautiful tracery that had been in the windows, by
the remains of the stonework here and there; and an old man--'ever so
old,' he called himself when we inquired his exact age--who scrambled
and stumbled out of some lair in the least devastated part of the
ruins at our approach, and who established himself as our guide,
showed us a scrap of glass yet lingering in what was the window of
the great drawing-room not above seventy years ago. After he had done
his duty, he hobbled with us to the neighbouring church, where the
knightly Crowleys lie buried: some commemorated by ancient brasses,
some by altar-tombs, some by fine Latin epitaphs, bestowing upon them
every virtue under the sun. He had to take the church-key back to the
adjoining parsonage at the entrance of the long straggling street
which forms the village of Crowley. The castle and the church were on
the summit of a hill, from which we could see the distant line of sea
beyond the misty marshes. The village fell away from the church and
parsonage, down the hill. The aspect of the place was little, if at
all, changed, from its aspect in the year 1772.</p>

<p>But I must begin a little earlier. From one of the Latin epitaphs
I learnt that Amelia Lady Crowley died in 1756, deeply regretted by
her loving husband, Sir Mark. He never married again, though his wife
had left him no heir to his name or his estate--only a little tiny
girl--Theresa Crowley. This child would inherit her mother's fortune,
and all that Sir Mark was free to leave; but this little was not
much; the castle and all the lands going to his sister's son,
Marmaduke, or as he was usually called Duke, Brownlow. Duke's parents
were dead, and his uncle was his guardian, and his guardian's house
was his home. The lad was some seven or eight years older than his
cousin; and probably Sir Mark thought it not unlikely that his
daughter and his heir might make a match. Theresa's mother had bad
some foreign blood in her, and had been brought up in France--not so
far away but that its shores might be seen by any one who chose to
take an easy day's ride from Crowley Castle for the purpose.</p>

<p>Lady Crowley had been a delicate elegant creature, but no great
beauty, judging from all accounts; Sir Mark's family were famous for
their good looks; Theresa, an unusually lucky child, inherited the
outward graces of both her parents. A portrait which I saw of her,
degraded to a station over the parlour chimney-piece in the village
inn, showed me black hair, soft yet arch grey eyes with brows and
lashes of the same tint as her hair, a full pretty pouting passionate
mouth, and a round slender throat. She was a wilful little creature,
and her father's indulgence made her more wayward. She had a nurse,
too, a French bonne, whose mother had been about my lady from her
youth, who had followed my lady to England, and who had died there.
Victorine had been in attendance on the young Theresa from her
earliest infancy, and almost took the place of a parent in power and
affection--in power, as to ordering and arranging almost what she
liked, concerning the child's management--in love, because they speak
to this day of the black year when virulent smallpox was rife in
Crowley, and when, Sir Mark being far away on some diplomatic
mission--in Vienna, I fancy--Victorine shut herself up with Miss
Theresa when the child was taken ill with the disease, and nursed her
night and day. She only succumbed to the dreadful illness when all
danger to the child was over. Theresa came out of it with unblemished
beauty; Victorine barely escaped with life, and was disfigured for
life.</p>

<p>This disfigurement put a stop to much unfounded scandal which had
been afloat respecting the French servant's great influence over Sir
Mark. He was, in fact, an easy and indolent man, rarely excited to
any vehemence of emotion, and who felt it to be a point of honour to
carry out his dead wife's wish that Victorine should never leave
Theresa, and that the management of the child should be confided to
her. Only once had there been a struggle for power between Sir Mark
and the bonne, and then she had won the victory. And no wonder, if
the old butler's account were true; for he had gone into the room
unawares, and had found Sir Mark and Victorine at high words; and he
said that Victorine was white with rage, that her eyes were blazing
with passionate fire, that her voice was low, and her words were few,
but that, although she spoke in French, and he the butler only knew
his native English, he would rather have been sworn at by a drunken
grenadier with a sword in his hand, than have had those words of
Victorine's addressed to him.</p>

<p>Even the choice of Theresa's masters was left to Victorine. A
little reference was occasionally made to Madam Hawtrey, the parson's
wife and a distant relation of Sir Mark's, but, seeing that, if
Victorine chose so to order it, Madam Hawtrey's own little daughter
Bessy would have been deprived of the advantages resulting from
gratuitous companionship in all Theresa's lessons, she was careful
how she opposed or made an enemy of Mademoiselle Victorine. Bessy was
a gentle quiet child, and grew up to be a sensible sweet-tempered
girl, with a very fair share of English beauty; fresh-complexion,
brown-eyed round-faced, with a stiff though well-made figure, as
different as possible from Theresa's slight lithe graceful form. Duke
was a young man to these two maidens, while they to him were little
more than children. Of course he admired his cousin Theresa the
most--who would not?--but he was establishing his first principles of
morality for himself, and her conduct towards Bessy sometimes jarred
against his ideas of right. One day, after she had been tyrannizing
over the self-contained and patient Bessy so as to make the latter
cry--and both the amount of the tyranny and the crying were unusual
circumstances, for Theresa was of a generous nature when not put out
of the way--Duke spoke to his cousin:</p>

<p>'Theresa! You had no right to blame Bessy as you did. It was as
much your fault as hers. You were as much bound to remember Mr
Dawson's directions about the sums you were to do for him, as she
was.'</p>

<p>The girl opened her great grey eyes in surprise. She to blame!</p>

<p>'What does Bessy come to the castle for, I wonder? They pay
nothing--we pay all. The least she can do, is to remember for me what
we are told. I shan't trouble myself with attending to Mr Dawson's
directions; and if Bessy does not like to do so, she can stay away.
She already knows enough to earn her bread as a maid: which I suppose
is what she'll have to come to.'</p>

<p>The moment Theresa had said this, she could have bitten her tongue
out for the meanness and rancour of the speech. She saw pain and
disappointment clearly expressed on Duke's face; and, in another
moment, her impulses would have carried her to the opposite extreme,
and she would have spoken out her self-reproach. But Duke thought it
his duty to remonstrate with her, and to read her a homily, which,
however true and just, weakened the effect of the look of distress on
his face. Her wits were called into play to refute his arguments; her
head rather than her heart took the prominent part in the
controversy; and it ended unsatisfactorily to both; he, going away
with dismal though unspoken prognostics touching what she would
become as a woman if she were so supercilious and unfeeling as a
girl; she, the moment his back was turned, throwing herself on the
floor and sobbing as if her heart would break. Victorine heard her
darling's passionate sobs, and came in.</p>

<p>'What hast thou, my angel! Who has been vexing thee,--tell me, my
cherished?'</p>

<p>She tried to raise the girl, but Theresa would not be raised;
neither would she speak till she chose, in spite of Victorine's
entreaties. When she chose, she lifted herself up, still sitting on
the floor, and putting her tangled hair off her flushed tear-stained
face, said:</p>

<p>'Never mind, it was only something Duke said; I don't care for it
now.' And refusing Victorine's aid, she got up, and stood
thoughtfully looking out of the window.</p>

<p>'That Duke!' exclaimed Victorine. 'What business has that Mr Duke
to go vex my darling? He is not your husband yet, that he should
scold you, or that you should mind what he says.'</p>

<p>Theresa listened and gained a new idea; but she gave no outward
sign of attention, or of her now hearing for the first time how that
she was supposed to be intended for her cousin's wife. She made no
reply to Victorine's caresses and speeches; one might almost say she
shook her off. As soon as she was left to herself, she took her hat,
and going out alone, as she was wont, in the pleasure-grounds, she
went down the terrace steps, crossed the bowling-green, and opened a
little wicket-gate which led into the garden of the parsonage. There,
were Bessy and her mother, gathering fruit. It was Bessy whom Theresa
sought; for there was something in Madam Hawtrey's silky manner that
was always rather repugnant to her. However, she was not going to
shrink from her resolution because Madam Hawtrey was there. So she
went up to the startled Bessy, and said to her, as if she were
reciting a prepared speech: 'Bessy, I behaved very crossly to you; I
had no business to have spoken to you as I did.'--'Will you forgive
me?' was the predetermined end of this confession; but somehow, when
it came to that, she could not say it with Madam Hawtrey standing by,
ready to smile and to curtsey as soon as she could catch Theresa's
eye. There was no need to ask forgiveness though; for Bessy had put
down her half filled basket, and came softly up to Theresa, stealing
her brown soil-stained little hand into the young lady's soft white
one, and looking up at her with loving brown eyes.</p>

<p>'I am so sorry, but I think it was the sums on page 108. I have
been looking and looking, and I am almost sure.'</p>

<p>Her exculpatory tone caught her mother's ear, although her words
did not.</p>

<p>'I am sure, Miss Theresa, Bessy is so grateful for the privileges
of learning with you! It is such an advantage to her! I often tell
her, "Take pattern by Miss Theresa, and do as she does, and try and
speak as she does, and there'll not be a parson's daughter in all
Sussex to compare with you." Don't I, Bessy?'</p>

<p>Theresa shrugged her shoulders--a trick she had caught from
Victorine--and, turning to Bessy, asked her what she was going to do
with those gooseberries she was gathering? And as Theresa spoke, she
lazily picked the ripest out of the basket, and ate them.</p>

<p>'They are for a pudding,' said Bessy. 'As soon as we have gathered
enough, I am going in to make it.'</p>

<p>'I'll come and help you,' said Theresa, eagerly. 'I should so like
to make a pudding. Our Monsieur Antoine never makes gooseberry
puddings.'</p>

<p>Duke came past the parsonage an hour or so afterwards: and,
looking in by chance through the open casement windows of the
kitchen, saw Theresa pinned up in a bib and apron, her arms all over
flour, flourishing a rolling-pin, and laughing and chattering with
Bessy similarly attired. Duke had spent his morning ostensibly in
fishing; but in reality in weighing in his own mind what he could do
or say to soften the obdurate heart of his cousin. And here it was,
all inexplicably right, as if by some enchanter's wand!</p>

<p>The only conclusion Duke could come to was the same that many a
wise (and foolish) man had come to before his day:</p>

<p>'Well! Women are past my comprehension, that's all!'</p>

<p>When all this took place, Theresa was about fifteen; Bessy was
perhaps six months older; Duke was just leaving Oxford. His uncle,
Sir Mark, was excessively fond of him; yes! and proud, too, for he
had distinguished himself at college, and every one spoke well of
him. And he, for his part, loved Sir Mark, and, unspoiled by the fame
and reputation he had gained at Christ Church, paid respectful
deference to Sir Mark's opinions.</p>

<p>As Theresa grew older, her father supposed that he played his
cards well in singing Duke's praises on every possible occasion. She
tossed her head, and said nothing. Thanks to Victorine's revelations,
she understood the tendency of her father's speeches. She intended to
make her own choice of a husband when the time came; and it might be
Duke, or it might be some one else. When Duke did not lecture or
prose, but was sitting his horse so splendidly at the meet, before
the huntsman gave the blast, 'Found;' when Duke was holding his own
in discourse with other men; when Duke gave her a short sharp word of
command on any occasion; then she decided that she would marry him,
and no one else. But when he found fault, or stumbled about awkwardly
in a minuet, or talked moralities against duelling, then she was sure
that Duke should never be her husband. She wondered if he knew about
it; if any one had told him, as Victorine had told her; if her father
had revealed his thoughts and wishes to his nephew, as plainly as he
had done to his daughter? This last query made her cheeks burn; and,
on days when the suspicion had been brought by any chance prominently
before her mind, she was especially rude and disagreeable to
Duke.</p>

<p>He was to go abroad on the grand tour of Europe, to which young
men of fortune usually devoted three years. He was to have a tutor,
because all young men of his rank had tutors; else he was quite wise
enough, and steady enough, to have done without one, and probably
knew a good deal more about what was best to be observed in the
countries they were going to visit, than Mr Roberts, his appointed
bear-leader. He was to come back full of historical and political
knowledge, speaking French and Italian like a native, and having a
smattering of barbarous German, and he was to enter the House as a
county member, if possible--as a borough member at the worst; and was
to make a great success; and then, as every one understood, he was to
marry his cousin Theresa.</p>

<p>He spoke to her father about it, before starting on his travels.
It was after dinner in Crowley Castle. Sir Mark and Duke sat alone,
each pensive at the thought of the coming parting.</p>

<p>'Theresa is but young,' said Duke, breaking into speech after a
long silence, 'but if you have no objection, uncle, I should like to
speak to her before I leave England, about my--my hopes.'</p>

<p>Sir Mark played with his glass, poured out some more wine, drank
it off at a draught, and then replied:</p>

<p>'No, Duke, no. Leave her in peace with me. I have looked forward
to having her for my companion through these three years; they'll
soon pass away' (to age, but not to youth), 'and I should like to
have her undivided heart till you come back. No, Duke! Three years
will soon pass away, and then we'll have a royal wedding.'</p>

<p>Duke sighed, but said no more. The next day was the last. He
wanted Theresa to go with him to take leave of the Hawtreys at the
Parsonage, and of the villagers; but she was wilful, and would not.
He remembered, years afterwards, how Bessy's gentle peaceful manner
had struck him as contrasted with Theresa's, on that last day. Both
girls regretted his departure. He had been so uniformly gentle and
thoughtful in his behaviour to Bessy, that, without any idea of love,
she felt him to be her pattern of noble chivalrous manhood; the only
person, except her father, who was steadily kind to her. She admired
his sentiments, she esteemed his principles, she considered his long
evolvement of his ideas as the truest eloquence. He had lent her
books, he had directed her studies; all the advice and information
which Theresa had rejected had fallen to Bessy's lot, and she had
received it thankfully.</p>

<p>Theresa burst into a passion of tears as soon as Duke and his
suite were out of sight. She had refused the farewell kiss her father
had told her to give him, but had waved her white handkerchief out of
the great drawing-room window (that very window in which the old
guide showed me the small piece of glass still lingering). But Duke
had ridden away with slack rein and downcast head, without looking
back.</p>

<p>His absence was a great blank in Sir Mark's life. He had never
sought London much as a place of residence; in former days he had
been suspected of favouring the Stuarts; but nothing could be proved
against him, and he had subsided into a very tolerably faithful
subject of King George the Third. Still, a cold shoulder having been
turned to him by the court party at one time, he had become
prepossessed against the English capital. On the contrary, his wife's
predilections and his own tendencies had always made Paris a very
agreeable place of residence to him. To Paris he at length resorted
again, when the blank in his life oppressed him; and from Paris,
about two years after Duke's departure, he returned after a short
absence from home, and suddenly announced to his daughter and the
household that he had taken an apartment in the Rue Louis le Grand
for the coming winter, to which there was to be an immediate removal
of his daughter, Victorine, and certain other personal attendants and
servants.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed Theresa's mad joy at this unexpected news.
She sprang upon her father's neck, and kissed him till she was
tired--whatever he was. She ran to Victorine, and told her to guess
what 'heavenly bliss' was going to befall them, dancing round the
middle-aged woman until she, in her spoilt impatience, was becoming
angry, when, kissing her, she told her, and ran off to the Parsonage,
and thence to the church, bursting in upon morning prayers--for it
was All Saints' Day, although she had forgotten it--and filliping a
scrap of paper on which she had hastily written, 'We are going to
Paris for the winter--all of us,' rolled into a ball, from the castle
pew to that of the parson. She saw Bessy redden as she caught it, put
it into her pocket unread, and, after an apologetic glance at the
curtained seat in which Theresa was, go on with her meek responses.
Theresa went out by the private door in a momentary fit of passion.
'Stupid cold-blooded creature!' she said to herself. But that
afternoon Bessy came to the castle, so sorry--and so losing her own
sorrow in sympathy with her friend's gladness, that Theresa took her
into favour again. The girls parted with promises of correspondence,
and with some regret: the greatest on Bessy's side. Some grand
promises of Paris fashion, and presents of dress, Theresa made in her
patronizing way; but Bessy did not seem to care much for them--which
was fortunate, for they were never fulfilled.</p>

<p>Sir Mark had an idea in his head of perfecting Theresa's
accomplishments and manners by Parisian masters and Parisian society.
English residents in Venice, Florence, Rome, wrote to their friends
at home about Duke. They spoke of him as of what we should, at the
present day, call a 'rising young man.' His praises ran so high, that
Sir Mark began to fear lest his handsome nephew, feted by princes,
courted by ambassadors, made love to by lovely Italian ladies, might
find Theresa too country-bred for his taste.</p>

<p>Thus had come about, the engaging of the splendid apartment in the
Rue Louis le Grand. The street itself is narrow, and now-a-days we
are apt to think the situation close; but in those days it was the
height of fashion; for, the great arbiter of fashion, the Duc de
Richelieu, lived there, and, to inhabit an apartment in that street,
was in itself a mark of bon ton. Victorine seemed almost crazy with
delight when they took possession of their new abode. 'This dear
Paris! This lovely France! And now I see my young lady, my darling,
my angel, in a room suited to her beauty and her rank: such as my
lady her mother would have planned for her, if she had lived.' Any
allusion to her dead mother always touched Theresa to the quick. She
was in her bed, under the blue silk curtains of an alcove, when
Victorine said this,--being too much fatigued after her journey to
respond to Victorine's rhapsodies; but now she put our her little
hand and gave Victorine's a pressure of gratitude and pleasure. Next
day she wandered about the rooms and admired their splendour almost
to Victorine's content. Her father, Sir Mark, found a handsome
carriage and horses for his darling's use; and also found that not
less necessary article--a married lady of rank who would take his
girl under her wing. When all these preliminary arrangements were
made, who so wildly happy as Theresa! Her carriage was of the newest
fashion, fit to vie with any on the Cours de la Reine, the then
fashionable drive. The box at the Grand Opera, and at the Francais,
which she shared with Madame la Duchesse de G., was the centre of
observation; Victorine was in her best humour, Theresa's credit at
her dressmaker's was unlimited, her indulgent father was charmed with
all she did and said. She had masters, it is true; but, to a rich and
beautiful young lady, masters were wonderfully complaisant, and with
them as with all the world, she did what she pleased. Of Parisian
society, she had enough and more than enough. The duchess went
everywhere, and Theresa went too. So did a certain Count de la
Grange: some relation or connection of the duchess: handsome, with a
south of France handsomeness: with delicate features, marred by an
oversoftness of expression, from which (so men said) the tiger was
occasionally seen to peep forth. But, for elegance of dress and
demeanour he had not his fellow in Paris--which of course meant, not
in the world.</p>

<p>Sir Mark heard rumours of this man's conduct, which were not
pleasing to him; but when he accompanied his daughter into society,
the count was only as deferential as it became a gentleman to be to
so much beauty and grace, When Theresa was taken out by the duchess
to the opera, to balls, to petits soupers, without her father, then
the count was more than deferential; he was adoring. It was a little
intoxicating for a girl brought up in the solitude of an English
village, to have so many worshippers at her feet all at once, in the
great gay city; and the inbred coquetry of her nature came out,
adding to her outward grace, if taking away from the purity and
dignity of her character. It was Victorine's delight to send her
darling out arrayed for conquest; her hair delicately powdered, and
scented with marechale; her little 'mouches' put on with skill; the
tiny half-moon patch, to lengthen the already almond-shaped eye; the
minute star to give the effect of a dimple at the corner of her
scarlet lips; the silver gauze looped up over the petticoat of blue
brocade, distended over a hoop, much as gowns are worn in our days;
the coral ornaments of her silver dress, matching with the tint of
the high heels to her shoes. And, at night, Victorine was never tired
of listening and questioning; of triumphing in Theresa's triumphs; of
invariably reminding her that she was bound to marry the absent
cousin, and return to the half-feudal state of the old castle in
Sussex.</p>

<p>Still, even now, if Duke had returned from Italy, all might have
gone well; but when Sir Mark, alarmed by the various proposals he
received for Theresa's hand from needy French noblemen, and by the
admiration she was exciting everywhere, wrote to Duke, and urged him
to join them in Paris on his return from his travels, Duke answered
that three months were yet unexpired of the time allotted for the
grand tour; and that he was anxious to avail himself of that interval
to see something of Spain. Sir Mark read this letter aloud to
Theresa, with many expressions of annoyance as he read. Theresa
merely said, 'Of course, Duke does what he likes,' and turned away to
see some new lace brought for her inspection. She heard her father
sigh over a re-perusal of Duke's letter, and she set her teeth in the
anger she would not show in acts or words. That day the Count de
Grange met with gentler treatment from her than he had done for many
days--than he had done since her father's letter to Duke had been
sent off to Genoa. As ill fortune would have it, Sir Mark had
occasion to return to England at this time, and he, guileless
himself, consigned Theresa and her maid Victorine, and her man Felix,
to the care of the duchess for three weeks. They were to reside at
the Hotel de G. during this time. The duchess welcomed them in her
most caressing manner, and showed Theresa the suite of rooms, with
the little private staircase, appropriated to her use.</p>

<p>The Count de Grange was an habitual visitor at the house of his
cousin the duchess, who was a gay Parisian, absorbed in her life of
giddy dissipation. The count found means of influencing Victorine in
his favour; not by money; so coarse a bribe would have had no power
over her; but by many presents, accompanied with sentimental letters,
breathing devotion to her charge, and extremest appreciation of the
faithful friend whom Theresa looked upon as a mother, and whom for
this reason he, the count, revered and loved. Intermixed, were wily
allusions to his great possessions in Provence, and to his ancient
lineage:--the one mortgaged, the other disgraced. Victorine, whose
right hand had forgotten its cunning in the length of her dreary
vegetation at Crowley Castle, was deceived, and became a vehement
advocate of the dissolute Adonis of the Paris saloons, in his suit to
her darling. When Sir Mark came back, he was dismayed and shocked
beyond measure by finding the count and Theresa at his feet,
entreating him to forgive their stolen marriage--a marriage which,
though incomplete as to its legal forms, was yet too complete to be
otherwise than sanctioned by Theresa's nearest friends. The duchess
accused her cousin of perfidy and treason. Sir Mark said nothing. But
his health failed from that time, and he sank into an old querulous
grey-haired man.</p>

<p>There was some ado, I know not what, between Sir Mark and the
count regarding the control and disposition of the fortune which
Theresa inherited from her mother. The count gained the victory,
owing to the different nature of the French laws from the English;
and this made Sir Mark abjure the country and the city he had loved
so long. Henceforward, he swore, his foot should never touch French
soil; if Theresa liked to come and see him at Crowley Castle, she
should be as welcome as a daughter of the house ought to be, and ever
should be; but her husband should never enter the gates of the house
in Sir Mark's lifetime.</p>

<p>For some months he was out of humour with Duke, because of his
tardy return from his tour and his delay in joining them in Paris:
through which, so Sir Mark fancied, Theresa's marriage had been
brought about. But--when Duke came home, depressed in spirits and
submissive to his uncle, even under unjust blame--Sir Mark restored
him to favour in the course of a summer's day, and henceforth added
another injury to the debtor side of the count's reckoning.</p>

<p>Duke never told his uncle of the woeful ill-report he had heard of
the count in Paris, where he had found all the better part of the
French nobility pitying the lovely English heiress who had been
entrapped into a marriage with one of the most disreputable of their
order, a gambler and a reprobate. He could not leave Paris without
seeing Theresa, whom he believed to be as yet unacquainted with his
arrival in the city, so he went to call upon her one evening. She was
sitting alone, splendidly dressed, ravishingly beautiful; she made a
step forward to meet him, hardly heeding the announcement of his
name; for she had recognized a man's tread, and fancied it was her
husband, coming to accompany her to some grand reception. Duke saw
the quick change from hope to disappointment on her mobile face, and
she spoke out at once her reason. 'Adolphe promised to come and fetch
me; the princess receives to-night. I hardly expected a visit from
you, cousin Duke,' recovering herself into a pretty proud reserve.
'It is a fortnight, I think, since I heard you were in Paris. I had
given up all expectation of the honour of a visit from you!'</p>

<p>Duke felt that, as she had heard of his being there, it would be
awkward to make excuses which both she and he must know to be false,
or explanations the very truth of which would be offensive to the
loving, trusting, deceived wife. So, he turned the conversation to
his travels, his heart aching for her all the time, as he noticed her
wandering attention when she heard any passing sound. Ten, eleven,
twelve o'clock; he would not leave her. He thought his presence was a
comfort and a pleasure to her. But when one o'clock struck, she said
some unexpected business must have detained her husband, and she was
glad of it, as she had all along felt too much tired to go out: and
besides, the happy consequence of her husband's detention had been
that long talk with Duke.</p>

<p>He did not see her again after this polite dismissal, nor did he
see her husband at all. Whether through ill chance, or carefully
disguised purpose, it did so happen that he called several times, he
wrote several notes requesting an appointment when he might come with
the certainty of finding the count and countess at home, in order to
wish them farewell before setting out for England. All in vain. But
he said nothing to Sir Mark of all this. He only tried to fill up the
blank in the old man's life. He went between Sir Mark and the tenants
to whom he was unwilling to show himself unaccompanied by the
beautiful daughter, who had so often been his companion in his walks
and rides, before that ill-omened winter in Paris. He was thankful to
have the power of returning the long kindness his uncle had shown him
in childhood; thankful to be of use to him in his desertion; thankful
to atone in some measure for his neglect of his uncle's wish that he
should have made a hasty return to Paris.</p>

<p>But it was a little dull after the long excitement of travel,
after associating with all that was most cultivated and seeing all
that was most famous, in Europe, to be shut up in that vast
magnificent dreary old castle, with Sir Mark for a perpetual
companion--Sir Mark, and no other. The parsonage was near at hand,
and occasionally Mr Hawtrey came in to visit his parishioner in his
trouble. But Sir Mark kept the clergyman at bay; he knew that his
brother in age, his brother in circumstances (for had not Mr Hawtrey
an only child and she a daughter?), was sympathizing with him in his
sorrow, and he was too proud to bear it; indeed, sometimes he was so
rude to his old neighbour, that Duke would go next morning to the
parsonage, to soothe the smart.</p>

<p>And so--and so--gradually, imperceptibly, at last his heart was
drawn to Bessy. Her mother angled and angled skilfully; at first
scarcely daring to hope; then remembering her own descent from the
same stock as Duke, she drew herself up, and set to work with fresh
skill and vigour. To be sure, it was a dangerous game for a mother to
play; for her daughter's happiness was staked on her success. How
could simple country-bred Bessy help being attracted to the courtly
handsome man, travelled and accomplished, good and gentle, whom she
saw every day, and who treated her with the kind familiarity of a
brother; while he was not a brother, but in some measure a
disappointed man, as everybody knew? Bessy was a daisy of an English
maiden; pure good to the heart's core and most hidden thought;
sensible in all her accustomed daily ways, yet not so much without
imagination as not to desire something beyond the narrow range of
knowledge and experience in which her days had hitherto been passed.
Add to this her pretty figure, a bright healthy complexion, lovely
teeth, and quite enough of beauty in her other features to have
rendered her the belle of a country town, if her lot had been cast in
such a place; and it is not to be wondered at, that, after she had
been secretly in love with Duke with all her heart for nearly a year,
almost worshipping him, he should discover that, of all the women he
had ever known--except perhaps the lost Theresa--Bessy Hawtrey had it
in her power to make him the happiest of men.</p>

<p>Sir Mark grumbled a little; but now-a-days he grumbled at
everything, poor disappointed, all but childless, old man! As to the
vicar he stood astonished and almost dismayed. 'Have you thought
enough about it, Mr Duke?' the parson asked. 'Young men are apt to do
things in a hurry, that they repent at leisure. Bessy is a good girl,
a good girl, God bless her: but she has not been brought up as your
wife should have been: at least as folks will say your wife should
have been. Though I may say for her she has a very pretty sprinkling
of mathematics. I taught her myself, Mr Duke.'</p>

<p>'May I go and ask her myself? I only want your permission,' urged
Duke.</p>

<p>'Ay, go! But perhaps you'd better ask Madam first. She will like
to be told everything as soon as me.'</p>

<p>But Duke did not care for Madam. He rushed through the open door
of the parsonage, into the homely sitting-rooms, and softly called
for Bessy. When she came, he took her by the hand and led her forth
into the field-path at the back of the orchard, and there he won his
bride to the full content of both their hearts.</p>

<p>All this time the inhabitants of Crowley Castle and the quiet
people of the neighbouring village of Crowley, heard but little of
'The Countess,' as it was their fashion to call her. Sir Mark had his
letters from her, it is true, and he read them over and over again,
and moaned over them, and sighed, and put them carefully away in a
bundle. But they were like arrows of pain to him. None knew their
contents; none, even knowing them, would have dreamed, any more than
he did, for all his moans and sighs, of the utter wretchedness of the
writer. Love had long since vanished from the habitation of that
pair; a habitation, not a home, even in its brightest days. Love had
gone out of the window, long before poverty had come in at the door:
yet that grim visitant who never tarries in tracking a disreputable
gambler, had now arrived. The count lost the last remnants of his
character as a man who played honourably, and thenceforth--that being
pretty nearly the only sin which banished men from good society in
those days--he had to play where and how he could. Theresa's money
went as her poor angry father had foretold. By-and-by, and without
her consent, her jewel-box was rifled; the diamonds round the locket
holding her mother's picture were wrenched and picked out by no
careful hand. Victorine found Theresa crying over the poor
relics;--crying at last, without disguise, as if her heart would
break.</p>

<p>'Oh, mamma! mamma! mamma!' she sobbed out, holding up the smashed
and disfigured miniature as an explanation of her grief. She was
sitting on the floor, on which she had thrown herself in the first
discovery of the theft. Victorine sat down by her, taking her head
upon her breast, and soothing her. She did not ask who had done it;
she asked Theresa no question which the latter would have shrunk from
answering; she knew all in that hour, without the count's name having
passed the lips of either of them. And from that time she watched him
as a tiger watches his prey.</p>

<p>When the letters came from England, the three letters from Sir
Mark and the affianced bride and bridegroom, announcing the
approaching marriage of Duke and Bessy, Theresa took them straight to
Victorine. Theresa's lips were tightened, her pale cheeks were paler.
She waited for Victorine to speak. Not a word did the Frenchwoman
utter; but she smoothed the letters one over the other, and tore them
in two, throwing the pieces on the ground, and stamping on them.</p>

<p>'Oh, Victorine!' cried Theresa, dismayed at passion that went so
far beyond her own, 'I never expected it--I never thought of it--but,
perhaps, it was but natural.'</p>

<p>'It was not natural; it was infamous! To have loved you once, and
not to wait for chances, but to take up with that mean poor girl at
the parsonage. Pah! and her letter! Sir Mark is of my mind though, I
can see. I am sorry I tore up his letter. He feels, he knows, that Mr
Duke Brownlow ought to have waited, waited, waited. Some one waited
fourteen years, did he not? The count will not live for ever.'</p>

<p>Theresa did not see the face of wicked meaning as those last words
were spoken.</p>

<p>Another year rolled heavily on its course of wretchedness to
Theresa. That same revolution of time brought increase of peace and
joy to the English couple, striving humbly, striving well, to do
their duty as children to the unhappy and deserted Sir Mark. They had
their reward in the birth of a little girl. Yet, close on the heels
of this birth, followed a great sorrow. The good parson died, after a
short sudden illness. Then came the customary trouble after the death
of a clergyman. The widow had to leave the parsonage, the home of a
lifetime, and seek a new resting-place for her declining years.</p>

<p>Fortunately for all parties, the new vicar was a bachelor; no
other than the tutor who had accompanied Duke on his grand tour; and
it was made a condition that he should allow the widow of his
predecessor to remain at the parsonage as his housekeeper. Bessy
would fain have had her mother at the castle, and this course would
have been infinitely preferred by Madam Hawtrey, who, indeed,
suggested the wish to her daughter. But Sir Mark was obstinately
against it; nor did he spare his caustic remarks on Madam Hawtrey,
even before her own daughter. He had never quite forgiven Duke's
marriage, although he was personally exceedingly fond of Bessy. He
referred this marriage, in some part, and perhaps to no greater
extent than was true, to madam's good management in throwing the
young people together; and he was explicit in the expression of his
opinion.</p>

<p>Poor Theresa! Every day she more and more bitterly rued her
ill-starred marriage. Often and often she cried to herself, when she
was alone in the dead of the night, 'I cannot bear it--I cannot bear
it!' But again in the daylight her pride would help her to keep her
woe to herself. She could not bear the gaze of pitying eyes; she
could not bear even Victorine's fierce sympathy. She might have gone
home like a poor prodigal to her father, if Duke and Bessy had not,
as she imagined, reigned triumphant in her place, both in her
father's heart and in her father's home. And all this while, that
father almost hated the tender attentions which were rendered to him
by those who were not his Theresa, his only child, for whose presence
he yearned and longed in silent misery. Then again (to return to
Theresa), her husband had his fits of kindness towards her. If he had
been very fortunate in play, if he had heard other men admire her, he
would come back for a few moments to his loyalty, and would lure back
the poor tortured heart, only to crush it afresh. One day--after a
short time of easy temper, caresses, and levity--she found out
something, I know not what, in his life, which stung her to the
quick. Her sharp wits and sharper tongue spoke out most cutting
insults; at first he smiled, as if rather amused to see how she was
ransacking her brain to find stabbing speeches; but at length she
touched some sore; he scarcely lost the mocking smile upon his face,
but his eyes flashed lurid fire, and his heavy closed hand fell on
her white shoulder with a terrible blow!</p>

<p>She stood up, facing him, tearless, deadly white. 'The poor old
man at home!' was all she said, trembling, shivering all over, but
with her eyes fixed on his coward face. He shrank from her look,
laughed aloud to hide whatever feeling might be hidden in his bosom,
and left the room. She only said again, 'The poor old man--the poor
old deserted, desolate man!' and felt about blindly for a chair.</p>

<p>She had not sat down a minute though, before she started up and
rang her bell. It was Victorine's office to answer it; but Theresa
looked almost surprised to see her. 'You!--I wanted the others--I
want them all! They shall all see how their master treats his wife!
Look here!' she pushed the gauze neckerchief from her shoulder--the
mark was there red and swollen. 'Bid them all come here--Victorine,
Amadee, Jean, Adele, all--I will be justified by their testimony,
whatever I do!' Then she fell to shaking and crying.</p>

<p>Victorine said nothing, but went to a certain cupboard where she
kept medicines and drugs of which she alone knew the properties, and
there she mixed a draught, which she made her mistress take. Whatever
its nature was, it was soothing. Theresa leaned back in her chair,
still sobbing heavily from time to time, until at last she dropped
into a kind of doze. Then Victorine softly lifted the neckerchief,
which had fallen into its place, and looked at the mark. She did not
speak; but her whole face was a fearful threat. After she had looked
her fill, she smiled a deadly smile. And then she touched the soft
bruised flesh with her lips, much as though Theresa were the child
she had been twenty years ago. Soft as the touch was Theresa
shivered, and started and half awoke. 'Are they come?' she murmured;
'Amadee, Jean, Adele?' but without waiting for an answer she fell
asleep again.</p>

<p>Victorine went quietly back to the cupboard where she kept her
drugs, and stayed there, mixing something noiselessly. When she had
done what she wanted, she returned to her mistress's bedroom, and
looked at her, still sleeping. Then she began to arrange the room. No
blue silk curtains and silver mirrors, now, as in the Rue Louis le
Grand. A washed-out faded Indian chintz, and an old battered toilette
service of japan-ware; the disorderly signs of the count's late
presence; an emptied flask of liqueur.</p>

<p>All the time Victorine arranged this room she kept saying to
herself, 'At last! At last!' Theresa slept through the daylight,
slept late into the evening, leaning back where she had fallen in her
chair. She was so motionless that Victorine appeared alarmed. Once or
twice she felt her pulse, and gazed earnestly into the tear-stained
face. Once, she very carefully lifted one of the eyelids, and holding
a lighted taper near, peered into the eye. Apparently satisfied, she
went out and ordered a basin of broth to be ready when she asked for
it. Again she sat in deep silence; nothing stirred in the closed
chamber; but in the street the carriages began to roll, and the
footmen and torch-bearers to cry aloud their masters' names and
titles, to show what carriage in that narrow street below, was
entitled to precedence. A carriage stopped at the hotel of which they
occupied the third floor. Then the bell of their apartment rang
loudly--rang violently. Victorine went out to see what it was that
might disturb her darling--as she called Theresa to herself--her
sleeping lady as she spoke of her to her servants.</p>

<p>She met those servants bringing in their master, the count, dead.
Dead with a swordwound received in some infamous struggle. Victorine
stood and looked at him. 'Better so,' she muttered. 'Better so. But,
monseigneur, you shall take this with you, whithersoever your wicked
soul is fleeing.' And she struck him a stroke on his shoulder, just
where Theresa's bruise was. It was as light a stroke as well could
be; but this irreverence to the dead called forth indignation even
from the hardened bearers of the body. Little recked Victorine. She
turned her back on the corpse, went to her cupboard, took out the
mixture she bad made with so much care, poured it out upon the bare
wooden floor, and smeared it about with her foot.</p>

<p>A fortnight later, when no news had come from Theresa for many
weeks, a poor chaise was seen from the castle windows lumbering
slowly up the carriage road to the gate. No one thought much of it;
perhaps it was some friend of the housekeeper's; perhaps it was some
humble relation of Mrs Duke's (for many such had found out their
cousin since her marriage). No one noticed the shabby carriage much,
until the hall-porter was startled by the sound of the great bell
pealing, and, on opening wide the hall-doors, saw standing before him
the Mademoiselle Victorine of old days--thinner, sallower, in
mourning. In the carriage sat Theresa, in the deep widow's weeds of
those days. She looked out of the carriage-window wistfully, in
beyond Joseph, the hall-porter.</p>

<p>'My father!' she cried eagerly, before Victorine could speak. 'Is
Sir Mark--well?' ('alive' was her first thought, but she dared not
give the word utterance.)</p>

<p>'Call Mr. Duke!' said Joseph, speaking to some one unseen. Then he
came forward. 'God bless you, Miss! God bless you! And this day of
all days! Sir Mark is well--leastways he's sadly changed. Where's Mr
Duke? Call him! My young lady's fainting!'</p>

<p>And this was Theresa's return home. None ever knew how much she
had suffered since she had left home. If any one had known, Victorine
would never have stood there dressed in that mourning. She put it on,
sorely against her will, for the purpose of upholding the lying
fiction of Theresa's having been a happy prosperous marriage. She was
always indignant if any of the old servants fell back into the once
familiar appellation of Miss Theresa. 'The countess,' she would say,
in lofty rebuke.</p>

<p>What passed between Theresa and her father at that first interview
no one ever knew. Whether she told him anything of her married life,
or whether she only soothed the tears he shed on seeing her again, by
sweet repetition of tender words and caresses--such as are the
sugared pabulum of age as well as of infancy--no one ever knew.
Neither Duke nor his wife ever heard her allude to the time she had
passed in Paris, except in the most cursory and superficial manner.
Sir Mark was anxious to show her that all was forgiven, and would
fain have displaced Bessy from her place as lady of the castle, and
made Theresa take the headship of the house, and sit at table where
the mistress ought to be. And Bessy would have given up her onerous
dignities without a word; for Duke was always more jealous for his
wife's position than she herself was, but Theresa declined to assume
any such place in the household, saying, in the languid way which now
seemed habitual to her, that English house-keeping, and all the
domestic arrangements of an English country house were cumbrous and
wearisome to her; that if Bessy would continue to act as she had done
hitherto, and would so forestall what must be her natural duties at
some future period, she, Theresa, should be infinitely obliged.</p>

<p>Bessy consented, and in everything tried to remember what Theresa
liked, and how affairs were ordered in the old Theresa days. She
wished the servants to feel that 'the countess' had equal rights with
herself in the management of the house. But she, to whom the
housekeeper takes her accounts--she in whose hands the power of
conferring favours and privileges remains de facto--will always be
held by servants as the mistress; and Theresa's claims soon sank into
the background. At first, she was too broken--spirited, too languid,
to care for anything but quiet rest in her father's companionship.
They sat sometimes for hours hand in hand; or they sauntered out on
the terraces, hardly speaking, but happy; because they were once more
together, and once more on loving terms. Theresa grew strong during
this time of gentle brooding peace. The pinched pale face of anxiety
lined with traces of suffering, relaxed into the soft oval; the light
came into the eyes, the colour came into the cheeks.</p>

<p>But, in the autumn after Theresa's return, Sir Mark died; it had
been a gradual decline of strength, and his last moments were passed
in her arms. Her new misfortune threw her back into the wan worn
creature she had been when she first came home, a widow, to Crowley
Castle; she shut herself up in her rooms, and allowed no one to come
near her but Victorine. Neither Duke nor Bessy was admitted into the
darkened rooms, which she had hung with black cloth in solemn
funereal state.</p>

<p>Victorine's life since her return to the castle had been anything
but peaceable. New powers had arisen in the housekeeper's room. Madam
Brownlow had her maid, far more exacting than Madam Brownlow herself;
and a new housekeeper reigned in the place of her who was formerly
but an echo of Victorine's opinions. Victorine's own temper, too, was
not improved by her four years abroad, and there was a general
disposition among the servants to resist all her assumption of
authority. She felt her powerlessness after a struggle or two, but
treasured up her vengeance. If she had lost power over the household,
however, there was no diminution of her influence over her mistress.
It was her device at last that lured the countess out of her gloomy
seclusion.</p>

<p>Almost the only creature Victorine cared for, besides Theresa, was
the little Mary Brownlow. What there was of softness in her woman's
nature, seemed to come out towards children; though, if the child had
been a boy instead of a girl, it is probable that Victorine might not
have taken it into her good graces. As it was, the French nurse and
the English child were capital friends; and when Victorine sent Mary
into the countess's room, and bade her not be afraid, but ask the
lady in her infantine babble to come out and see Mary's snow-man, she
knew that the little one, for her sake, would put her small hand into
Theresa's, and thus plead with more success, because with less
purpose, than any one else had been able to plead. Out came Theresa,
colourless and sad, holding Mary by the hand. They went, unobserved
as they thought, to the great gallery-window, and looked out into the
court-yard; then Theresa returned to her rooms. But the ice was
broken, and before the winter was over, Theresa fell into her old
ways, and sometimes smiled, and sometimes even laughed, until chance
visitors again spoke of her rare beauty and her courtly grace.</p>

<p>It was noticeable that Theresa revived first out of her lassitude
to an interest in all Duke's pursuits. She grew weary of Bessy's
small cares and domestic talk--now about the servants, now about her
mother and the parsonage, now about the parish. She questioned Duke
about his travels, and could enter into his appreciation and
judgement of foreign nations; she perceived the latent powers of his
mind; she became impatient of their remaining dormant in country
seclusion. She had spoken of leaving Crowley Castle, and of finding
some other home, soon after her father's death; but both Duke and
Bessy had urged her to stay with them, Bessy saying, in the pure
innocence of her heart, how glad she was that, in the probably
increasing cares of her nursery, Duke would have a companion so much
to his mind.</p>

<p>About a year after Sir Mark's death, the member for Sussex died,
and Theresa set herself to stir up Duke to assume his place. With
some difficulty (for Bessy was passive: perhaps even opposed to the
scheme in her quiet way), Theresa succeeded, and Duke was elected.
She was vexed at Bessy's torpor, as she called it, in the whole
affair; vexed as she now often was with Bessy's sluggish interest in
all things beyond her immediate ken. Once, when Theresa tried to make
Bessy perceive how Duke might shine and rise in his new sphere, Bessy
burst into tears, and said, 'You speak as if his presence here were
nothing, and his fame in London everything. I cannot help fearing
that he will leave off caring for all the quiet ways in which we have
been so happy ever since we were married.'</p>

<p>'But when he is here,' replied Theresa, 'and when he wants to talk
to you of politics, of foreign news, of great public interests, you
drag him down to your level of woman's cares.'</p>

<p>'Do I?' said Bessy. 'Do I drag him down? I wish I was cleverer;
but you know, Theresa, I was never clever in anything but
housewifery.'</p>

<p>Theresa was touched for a moment by this humility.</p>

<p>'Yet, Bessy, you have a great deal of judgement, if you will but
exercise it. Try and take an interest in all he cares for, as well as
making him try and take an interest in home affairs.'</p>

<p>But, somehow, this kind of conversation too often ended in
dissatisfaction on both sides; and the servants gathered, from
induction rather than from words, that the two ladies were not on the
most cordial terms; however friendly they might wish to be, and might
strive to appear. Madam Hawtrey, too, allowed her jealousy of Theresa
to deepen into dislike. She was jealous because, in some unreasonable
way, she had taken it into her head that Theresa's presence at the
castle was the reason why she was not urged to take up her abode
there on Sir Mark's death: as if there were not rooms and suites of
rooms enough to lodge a wilderness of dowagers in the building, if
the owner so wished. But Duke had certain ideas pretty strongly fixed
in his mind; and one was a repugnance to his mother-in-law's constant
company. But he greatly increased her income as soon as he had it in
his power, and left it entirely to herself how she should spend
it.</p>

<p>Having now the means of travelling about, Madam Hawtrey betook
herself pretty frequently to such watering-places as were in vogue at
that day, or went to pay visits at the houses of those friends who
occasionally came lumbering up in shabby vehicles to visit their
cousin Bessy at the castle. Theresa cared little for Madam Hawtrey's
coldness; perhaps, indeed, never perceived it. She gave up striving
with Bessy, too; it was hopeless to try to make her an intellectual
ambitious companion to her husband. He had spoken in the House; he
had written a pamphlet that made much noise; the minister of the day
had sought him out, and was trying to attach him to the government.
Theresa, with her Parisian experience of the way in which women
influenced politics, would have given anything for the Brownlows to
have taken a house in London. She longed to see the great
politicians, to find herself in the thick of the struggle for place
and power, the brilliant centre of all that was worth hearing and
seeing in the kingdom. There had been some talk of this same London
house; but Bessy had pleaded against it earnestly while Theresa sat
by in indignant silence, until she could bear the discussion no
longer; going off to her own sitting-room, where Victorine was at
work. Here her pent-up words found vent--not addressed to her
servant, but not restrained before her:</p>

<p>'I cannot bear it--to see him cramped in by her narrow mind, to
hear her weak selfish arguments, urged because she feels she would be
out of place beside him. And Duke is hampered with this woman: he
whose powers are unknown even to himself, or he would put her feeble
nature on one side, and seek his higher atmosphere, How he would
shine! How he does shine! Good Heaven! To think--'</p>

<p>And here she sank into silence, watched by Victorine's furtive
eyes.</p>

<p>Duke had excelled all he had previously done by some great burst
of eloquence, and the country rang with his words. He was to come
down to Crowley Castle for a parliamentary recess, which occurred
almost immediately after this. Theresa calculated the hours of each
part of the complicated journey, and could have told to five minutes
when he might be expected; but the baby was ill and absorbed all
Bessy's attention. She was in the nursery by the cradle in which the
child slept, when her husband came riding up to the castle gate. But
Theresa was at the gate; her hair all out of powder, and blowing away
into dishevelled curls, as the hood of her cloak fell back; her lips
parted with a breathless welcome, her eyes shining out love and
pride. Duke was but mortal. All London chanted his rising fame, and
here in his home Theresa seemed to be the only person who appreciated
him.</p>

<p>The servants clustered in the great hall; for it was now some
length of time since he had been at home. Victorine was there, with
some headgear for her lady; and when, in reply to his inquiry for his
wife, the grave butler asserted that she was with young master, who
was, they feared, very seriously ill, Victorine said, with the
familiarity of an old servant, and as if to assuage Duke's anxiety:
'Madam fancies the child is ill, because she can think of nothing but
him, and perpetual watching has made her nervous.' The child,
however, was really ill; and after a brief greeting to her husband,
Bessy returned to her nursery, leaving Theresa to question, to hear,
to sympathize. That night she gave way to another burst of
disparaging remarks on poor motherly homely Bessy, and that night
Victorine thought she read a deeper secret in Theresa's heart.</p>

<p>The child was scarcely ever out of its mother's arms; but the
illness became worse, and it was nigh unto death. Some cream had been
set aside for the little wailing creature, and Victorine had
unwittingly used it for the making of a cosmetic for her mistress.
When the servant in charge of it reproved her, a quarrel began as to
their respective mistress's right to give orders in the household.
Before the dispute ended, pretty strong things had been said on both
sides.</p>

<p>The child died. The heir was lifeless; the servants were in
whispering dismay, and bustling discussion of their mourning; Duke
felt the vanity of fame, as compared to a baby's life. Theresa was
full of sympathy, but dared not express it to him; so tender was her
heart becoming. Victorine regretted the death in her own way. Bessy
lay speechless, and tearless; not caring for loving voices, nor for
gentle touches; taking neither food nor drink; neither sleeping nor
weeping. 'Send for her mother,' the doctor said; for Madam Hawtrey
was away on her visits, and the letters telling her of her
grandchild's illness had not reached her in the slow-delaying
cross-country posts of those days. So she was sent for; by a man
riding express, as a quicker and surer means than the post.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the nurses, exhausted by their watching, found the care
of little Mary by day, quite enough. Madam's maid sat up with Bessy
for a night or two; Duke striding in from time to time through the
dark hours to look at the white motionless face, which would have
seemed like the face of one dead, but for the long-quivering sighs
that came up from the overladen heart. The doctor tried his drugs, in
vain, and then he tried again. This night, Victorine at her own
earnest request, sat up instead of the maid. As usual, towards
midnight, Duke came stealing in with shaded light. 'Hush!' said
Victorine, her finger on her lips. 'She sleeps at last.' Morning
dawned faint and pale, and still she slept. The doctor came, and
stole in on tip-toe, rejoicing in the effect of his drugs. They all
stood round the bed; Duke, Theresa, Victorine. Suddenly the doctor--a
strange change upon him, a strange fear in his face--felt the
patient's pulse, put his ear to her open lips, called for a glass--a
feather. The mirror was not dimmed, the delicate fibres stirred not.
Bessy was dead.</p>

<p>I pass rapidly over many months. Theresa was again overwhelmed
with grief, or rather, I should say, remorse; for now that Bessy was
gone, and buried out of sight, all her innocent virtues, all her
feminine homeliness, came vividly into Theresa's mind--not as
wearisome, but as admirable, qualities of which she had been too
blind to perceive the value. Bessy had been her own old companion
too, in the happy days of childhood, and of innocence. Theresa rather
shunned than sought Duke's company now. She remained at the castle,
it is true, and Madam Hawtrey, as Theresa's only condition of
continuing where she was, came to live under the same roof. Duke felt
his wife's death deeply, but reasonably, as became his character. He
was perplexed by Theresa's bursts of grief, knowing, as he dimly did,
that she and Bessy had not lived together in perfect harmony. But he
was much in London now; a rising statesman; and when, in autumn, he
spent some time at the castle, he was full of admiration for the
strangely patient way in which Theresa behaved towards the old lady.
It seemed to Duke that in his absence Madam Hawtrey had assumed
absolute power in his household, and that the high-spirited Theresa
submitted to her fantasies with even more docility than her own
daughter would have done. Towards Mary, Theresa was always kind and
indulgent.</p>

<p>Another autumn came; and before it went, old ties were renewed,
and Theresa was pledged to become her cousin's wife.</p>

<p>There were two people strongly affected by this news when it was
promulgated; one--and this was natural under the circumstances--was
Madam Hawtrey; who chose to resent the marriage as a deep personal
offence to herself as well as to her daughter's memory, and who
sternly rejecting all Theresa's entreaties, and Duke's invitation to
continue her residence at the castle, went off into lodgings in the
village. The other person strongly affected by the news, was
Victorine.</p>

<p>From being a dry active energetic middle-aged woman, she now, at
the time of Theresa's engagement, sank into the passive languor of
advanced life. It seemed as if she felt no more need of effort, or
strain, or exertion. She sought solitude; liked nothing better than
to sit in her room adjoining Theresa's dressing-room, sometimes sunk
in a reverie, sometimes employed on an intricate piece of knitting
with almost spasmodic activity. But wherever Theresa went, thither
would Victorine go. Theresa had imagined that her old nurse would
prefer being left at the castle, in the soothing tranquillity of the
country, to accompanying her and her husband to the house in
Grosvenor-square, which they had taken for the parliamentary season.
But the mere offer of a choice seemed to irritate Victorine
inexpressibly. She looked upon the proposal as a sign that Theresa
considered her as superannuated--that her nursling was weary of her,
and wished to supplant her services by those of a younger maid. It
seemed impossible to dislodge this idea when it had once entered into
her head, and it led to frequent bursts of temper, in which she
violently upbraided Theresa for her ingratitude towards so faithful a
follower.</p>

<p>One day, Victorine went a little further in her expressions than
usual, and Theresa, usually so forbearing towards her, turned at
last. 'Really, Victorine!' she said, 'this is misery to both of us.
You say you never feel so wicked as when I am near you; that my
ingratitude is such as would be disowned by fiends; what can I, what
must I do? You say you are never so unhappy as when you are near me;
must we, then, part? Would that be for your happiness?'</p>

<p>'And is that what it has come to!' exclaimed Victorine. 'In my
country they reckon a building secure against wind and storm and all
the ravages of time, if the first mortar used has been tempered with
human blood. But not even our joint secret, though it was tempered
well with blood, can hold our lives together! How much less all the
care, all the love, that I lavished upon you in the days of my youth
and strength!'</p>

<p>Theresa came close to the chair in which Victorine was seated. She
took hold of her hand and held it fast in her own. 'Speak,
Victorine,' said she, hoarsely, 'and tell me what you mean. What is
our joint secret? And what do you mean by its being a secret of
blood? Speak out. I will know.'</p>

<p>'As if you do not know!' replied Victorine, harshly. 'You don't
remember my visits to Bianconi, the Italian chemist in the Marais,
long ago?' She looked into Theresa's face, to see if her words had
suggested any deeper meaning than met the ear. No; Theresa's look was
stern, but free and innocent.</p>

<p>'You told me you went there to learn the composition of certain
unguents, and cosmetics, and domestic medicines.'</p>

<p>'Ay, and paid high for my knowledge, too,' said Victorine, with a
low chuckle. 'I learned more than you have mentioned, my lady
countess. I learnt the secret nature of many drugs--to speak plainly,
I learnt the art of poisoning. And,' suddenly standing up, 'it was
for your sake I learnt it. For your service--you--who would fain cast
me off in my old age. For you!'</p>

<p>Theresa blanched to a deadly white. But she tried to move neither
feature nor limb, nor to avert her eyes for one moment from the eyes
that defied her. 'For my service, Victorine?'</p>

<p>'Yes! The quieting draught was all ready for your husband, when
they brought him home dead.'</p>

<p>'Thank God his death does not lie at your door!'</p>

<p>'Thank God?' mocked Victorine. 'The wish for his death does lie at
your door; and the intent to rid you of him does lie at my door. And
I am not ashamed of it. Not I! It was not for myself I would have
done it, but because you suffered so. He had struck you, whom I had
nursed on my breast.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Victorine!' said Theresa, with a shudder. 'Those days are
past. Do not let us recall them. I was so wicked because I was so
miserable; and now I am so happy, so inexpressibly happy, that--do
let me try to make you happy too!'</p>

<p>'You ought to try,' said Victorine, not yet pacified; 'can't you
see how the incomplete action once stopped by Fate, was tried again,
and with success; and how you are now reaping the benefit of my sin,
if sin it was?'</p>

<p>'Victorine! I do not know what you mean!' But some terror must
have come over her, she so trembled and so shivered.</p>

<p>'Do you not indeed? Madame Brownlow, the country girl from Crowley
Parsonage, needed sleep, and would fain forget the little child's
death that was pressing on her brain. I helped the doctor to his end.
She sleeps now, and she has met her baby before this, if priests'
tales are true. And you, my beauty, my queen, you reign in her stead!
Don't treat the poor Victorine as if she were mad, and speaking in
her madness. I have heard of tricks like that being played, when the
crime was done, and the criminal of use no longer.'</p>

<p>That evening, Duke was surprised by his wife's entreaty and
petition that she might leave him, and return with Victorine and her
other personal servants to the seclusion of Crowley Castle. She, the
great London toast, the powerful enchantress of society, and most of
all, the darling wife and true companion, with this sudden fancy for
this complete retirement, and for leaving her husband when he was
first fully entering into the comprehension of all that a wife might
be! Was it ill health? Only last night she had been in dazzling
beauty, in brilliant spirits; this morning only, she had been so
merry and tender. But Theresa denied that she was in any way
indisposed; and seemed suddenly so unwilling to speak of herself, and
so much depressed, that Duke saw nothing for it but to grant her wish
and let her go. He missed her terribly. No more pleasant tete-a-tete
breakfasts, enlivened by her sense and wit, and cheered by her pretty
caressing ways. No gentle secretary now, to sit by his side through
long long hours, never weary. When he went into society, he no longer
found his appearance watched and waited for by the loveliest woman
there. When he came home from the House at night, there was no one to
take an interest in his speeches, to be indignant at all that annoyed
him, and charmed and proud of all the admiration he had won. He
longed for the time to come when he would be able to go down for a
day or two to see his wife; for her letters appeared to him dull and
flat after her bright companionship. No wonder that her letters came
out of a heavy heart, knowing what she knew.</p>

<p>She scarcely dared to go near Victorine, whose moods were becoming
as variable as though she were indeed the mad woman she had
tauntingly defied Theresa to call her. At times she was miserable
because Theresa looked so ill, and seemed so deeply unhappy. At other
times she was jealous because she fancied Theresa shrank from her and
avoided her. So, wearing her life out with passion, Victorine's
health grew daily worse and worse during that summer.</p>

<p>Theresa's only comfort seemed to be little Mary's society. She
seemed as though she could not lavish love enough upon the motherless
child, who repaid Theresa's affection with all the pretty
demonstrativeness of her age. She would carry the little
three-year-old maiden in her arms when she went to see Victorine, or
would have Mary playing about in her dressing-room, if the old
Frenchwoman, for some jealous freak, would come and arrange her
lady's hair with her trembling hands. To avoid giving offence to
Victorine, Theresa engaged no other maid; to shun over-much or
over-frank conversation with Victorine, she always had little Mary
with her when there was a chance of the French waiting-maid coming
in. For, the presence of the child was a holy restraint even on
Victorine's tongue; she would sometimes check her fierce temper, to
caress the little creature playing at her knees; and would only dart
a covert bitter sting at Theresa under the guise of a warning against
ingratitude, to Mary.</p>

<p>Theresa drooped and drooped in this dreadful life. She sought out
Madam Hawtrey, and prayed her to come on a long visit to the castle.
She was lonely, she said, asking for madam's company as a favour to
herself. Madam Hawtrey was difficult to persuade; but the more she
resisted, the more Theresa entreated; and, when once madam was at the
castle, her own daughter had never been so dutiful, so humble a slave
to her slightest fancy as was the proud Theresa now.</p>

<p>Yet, for all this, the lady of the castle drooped and drooped, and
when Duke came down to see his darling he was in utter dismay at her
looks. Yet she said she was well enough, only tired. If she had
anything more upon her mind, she refused him her confidence. He
watched her narrowly, trying to forestall her smallest desires. He
saw her tender affection for Mary, and thought he had never seen so
lovely and tender a mother to another woman's child. He wondered at
her patience with Madam Hawtrey, remembering how often his own stock
had been exhausted by his mother-in-law, and how the brilliant
Theresa had formerly scouted and flouted at the vicar's wife. With
all this renewed sense of his darling's virtues and charms, the idea
of losing her was too terrible to bear.</p>

<p>He would listen to no pleas, to no objections. Before he returned
to town, where his presence was a political necessity, he sought the
best medical advice that could be had in the neighbourhood. The
doctors came; they could make but little out of Theresa, if her
vehement assertion were true that she had nothing on her mind.
Nothing.</p>

<p>'Humour him at least, my dear lady!' said the doctor, who had
known Theresa from her infancy, but who, living at the distant county
town, was only called in on the Olympian occasions of great state
illnesses. 'Humour your husband, and perhaps do yourself some good
too, by consenting to his desire that you should have change of air.
Brighthelmstone is a quiet village by the sea-side. Consent, like a
gracious lady, to go there for a few weeks.'</p>

<p>So, Theresa, worn out with opposition, consented, and Duke made
all the arrangements for taking her, and little Mary, and the
necessary suite of servants, to Brighton, as we call it now. He
resolved in his own mind that Theresa's personal attendant should be
some woman young enough to watch and wait upon her mistress, and not
Victorine, to whom Theresa was in reality a servant. But of this
plan, neither Theresa nor Victorine knew anything until the former
was in the carriage with her husband some miles distant from the
castle. Then he, a little exultant in the good management by which he
supposed he had spared his wife the pain and trouble of decision,
told her that Victorine was left behind, and that a new accomplished
London maid would await her at her journey's end.</p>

<p>Theresa only exclaimed, 'O! What will Victorine say?' and covered
her face, and sat shivering and speechless.</p>

<p>What Victorine did say, when she found out the trick, as she
esteemed it, that had been played upon her, was too terrible to
repeat. She lashed herself up into an ungoverned passion; ark then
became so really and seriously ill that the servants went to fetch
Madam Hawtrey in terror and dismay. But when that lady came,
Victorine shut her eyes, and refused to look at her. 'She has got her
daughter in her hand! I will not look!' Shaking all the time she
uttered these awe-stricken words, as if she were in an ague-fit.
'Bring the countess back to me. Let her face the dead woman standing
there, I will not do it. They wanted her to sleep--and so did the
countess, that she might step into her lawful place. Theresa,
Theresa, where are you? You tempted me. What I did, I did in your
service. And you have gone away, and left me alone with the dead
woman! It was the same drug as the doctor gave, after all--only he
gave little, and I gave much. My lady the countess spent her money
well, when she sent me to the old Italian to learn his trade' Lotions
for the complexion, and a discriminating use of poisonous drugs. I
discriminated, and Theresa profited; and now she is his wife, and has
left me here alone with the dead woman. Theresa, Theresa, come back
and save me from the dead woman!'</p>

<p>Madam Hawtrey stood by, horror-stricken. 'Fetch the vicar,' said
she, under her breath, to a servant.</p>

<p>'The village doctor is coming,' said some one near. 'How she
raves! Is it delirium?'</p>

<p>'It is no delirium,' said Bessy's mother. 'Would to Heaven it
were!'</p>

<p>Theresa had a happy day with her husband at Brighthelmstone before
he set off on his return to London. She watched him riding away, his
servant following with his portmanteau. Often and often did Duke look
back at the figure of his wife, waving her handkerchief, till a turn
of the road hid her from his sight. He had to pass through a little
village not ten miles from his home, and there a servant, with his
letters and further luggage, was to await him. There he found a
mysterious, imperative note, requiring his immediate presence at
Crowley Castle. Something in the awe-stricken face of the servant
from the castle, led Duke to question him. But all he could say was,
that Victorine lay dying, and that Madam Hawtrey had said that after
that letter the master was sure to return, and so would need no
luggage. Something lurked behind, evidently. Duke rode home at speed.
The vicar was looking out for him. 'My dear boy,' said he, relapsing
into the old relations of tutor and pupil, 'prepare yourself.'</p>

<p>'What for?' said Duke, abruptly: for the being told to prepare
himself, without being told for what, irritated him in his present
mood. 'Victorine is dead?'</p>

<p>'No! She says she will not die until she has seen you, and got you
to forgive her, if Madam Hawtrey will not. But first read this: it is
a terrible confession, made by her before me, a magistrate, believing
herself to be on the point of death!'</p>

<p>Duke read the paper--containing little more in point of detail
than I have already given--the horrible words taken down in the
short-hand in which the vicar used to write his mild prosy sermons:
his pupil knew the character of old. Duke read it twice. Then he
said: 'She is raving, poor creature!' But for all that, his heart's
blood ran cold, and he would fain not have faced the woman, but would
rather have remained in doubt to his dying day.</p>

<p>He went up the stairs three steps at a time, and then turned and
faced the vicar, with a look like the stern calmness of death. 'I
wish to see her alone.' He turned out all the watching women, and
then he went to the bedside where Victorine sat, half propped up with
pillows, watching all his doings and his looks, with her hollow awful
eyes. 'Now, Victorine, I will read this paper aloud to you. Perhaps
your mind has been wandering; but you understand me now?' A feeble
murmur of assent met his listening ear. 'If any statement in this
paper be not true, make me a sign. Hold up your hand--for God's sake
hold up your hand. And if you can do it with truth in this, your hour
of dying, Lord have mercy upon you; but if you cannot hold up your
hand, then Lord have mercy upon me!'</p>

<p>He read the paper slowly; clause by clause he read the paper. No
sign; no uplifted hand. At the end she spoke, and he bent his head to
listen. 'The Countess--Theresa you know--she who has left me to die
alone--she'--then mortal strength failed, and Duke was left alone in
the chamber of death.</p>

<p>He stayed in the chamber many minutes, quite still. Then he left
the room, and said to the first domestic he could find, 'The woman is
dead. See that she is attended to.' But he went to the vicar, and had
a long long talk with him. He sent a confidential servant for little
Mary--on some pretext, hardly careful, or plausible enough; but his
mood was desperate, and he seemed to forget almost everything but
Bessy, his first wife, his innocent girlish bride.</p>

<p>Theresa could ill spare her little darling, and was perplexed by
the summons; but an explanation of it was to come in a day or two. It
came.</p>

<p>'Victorine is dead; I need say no more. She could not carry her
awful secret into the next world, but told all. I can think of
nothing but my poor Bessy, delivered over to the cruelty of such a
woman. And you, Theresa, I leave you to your conscience, for you have
slept in my bosom. Henceforward I am a stranger to you. By the time
you receive this, I, and my child, and that poor murdered girl's
mother, will have left England. What will be our next step I know
not. My agent will do for you what you need.'</p>

<p>Theresa sprang up and rang her bell with mad haste. 'Get me a
horse!' she cried, 'and bid William be ready to ride with me for his
life--for my life--along the coast, to Dover!'</p>

<p>They rode and they galloped through the night, scarcely staying to
bait their horses. But when they came to Dover, they looked out to
sea upon the white sails that bore Duke and his child away. Theresa
was too late, and it broke her heart. She lies buried in Dover
churchyard. After long years Duke returned to England; but his place
in parliament knew him no more, and his daughter's husband sold
Crowley Castle to a stranger.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5"></a>Curious, If True</h2>

<p>You were formerly so much amused at my pride in my descent from
that sister of Calvin's, who married a Whittingham, Dean of Durham,
that I doubt if you will be able to enter into the regard for my
distinguished relation that has led me to France, in order to examine
registers and archives, which, I thought, might enable me to discover
collateral descendants of the great reformer, with whom I might call
cousins. I shall not tell you of my troubles and adventures in this
research; you are not worthy to hear of them; but something so
curious befel me one evening last August, that if I had not been
perfectly certain I was wide awake, I might have taken it for a
dream.</p>

<p>For the purpose I have named, it was necessary that I should make
Tours my head-quarters for a time. I had traced descendants of the
Calvin family out of Normandy into the centre of France; but I found
it was necessary to have a kind of permission from the bishop of the
diocese before I could see certain family papers, which had fallen
into the possession of the Church; and, as I had several English
friends at Tours, I awaited the answer to my request to Monseigneur
de---, at that town. I was ready to accept any invitation; but I
received very few; and was sometimes a little at a loss what to do
with my evenings. The table d'hote was at five o'clock; I did not
wish to go to the expense of a private sitting-room, disliked the
dinnery atmosphere of the salle a manger, could not play either at
pool or billiards, and the aspect of my fellow guests was
unprepossessing enough to make me unwilling to enter into any
tete-a-tete gamblings with them. So I usually rose from table early,
and tried to make the most of the remaining light of the August
evenings in walking briskly off to explore the surrounding country;
the middle of the day was too hot for this purpose, and better
employed in lounging on a bench in the Boulevards, lazily listening
to the distant band, and noticing with equal laziness the faces and
figures of the women who passed by.</p>

<p>One Thursday evening, the 18th of August it was, I think, I had
gone further than usual in my walk, and I found that it was later
than I had imagined when I paused to turn back. I fancied I could
make a round; I had enough notion of the direction in which I was, to
see that by turning up a narrow, straight lane to my left I should
shorten my way back to Tours. And so I believe I should have done,
could I have found an outlet at the right place, but field-paths are
almost unknown in that part of France, and my lane, stiff and
straight as any street, and marked into terribly vanishing
perspective by the regular row of poplars on each side, seemed
interminable. Of course night came on, and I was in darkness. In
England I might have had a chance of seeing a light in some cottage
only a field or two off, and asking my way from the inhabitants; but
here I could see no such welcome sight; indeed, I believe French
peasants go to bed with the summer daylight, so if there were any
habitations in the neighbour hood I never saw them. At last--I
believe I must have walked two hours in the darkness,--I saw the
dusky outline of a wood on one side of the weariful lane, and,
impatiently careless of all forest laws and penalties for
trespassers, I made my way to it, thinking that if the worst came to
the worst, I could find some covert--some shelter where I could lie
down and rest, until the morning light gave me a chance of finding my
way back to Tours. But the plantation, on the outskirts of what
appeared to me a dense wood, was of young trees, too closely planted
to be more than slender stems growing up to a good height, with
scanty foliage on their summits. On I went towards the thicker
forest, and once there I slackened my pace, and began to look about
me for a good lair. I was as dainty as Lochiel's grandchild, who made
his grandsire indignant at the luxury of his pillow of snow: this
brake was too full of brambles, that felt damp with dew; there was no
hurry, since I had given up all hope of passing the night between
four walls; and I went leisurely groping about, and trusting that
there were no wolves to be poked up Out of their summer drowsiness by
my stick, when all at once I saw a chateau before me, not a quarter
of a mile off, at the end of what seemed to be an ancient avenue (now
overgrown and irregular), which I happened to be crossing, when I
looked to my right, and saw the welcome sight. Large, stately, and
dark was its outline against the dusky night-sky; there were
pepper-boxes and tourelles and what-not fantastically going up into
the dim starlight. And more to the purpose still, though I could not
see the details of the building that I was now facing, it was plain
enough that there were lights in many windows, as if some great
entertainment was going on.</p>

<p>'They are hospitable people, at any rate,' thought I. 'Perhaps
they will give me a bed. I don't suppose French proprietaires have
traps and horses quite as plentiful as English gentlemen; but they
are evidently having a large party, and some of their guests may be
from Tours, and will give me a cast back to the Lion d'Or. I am not
proud, and I am dog-tired. I am not above hanging on behind, if need
be.'</p>

<p>So, putting a little briskness and spirit into my walk, I went up
to the door, which was standing open, most hospitably, showing a
large, lighted hall, all hung round with spoils of the chase, armour,
and co., the details of which I had not time to notice, for the
instant I stood on the threshold a huge porter appeared, in a
strange, old-fashioned dress, a kind of livery which well befitted
the general appearance of the house. He asked me, in French (so
curiously pronounced that I thought I had hit upon a new kind of
patois), my name, and whence I came. I thought he would not be much
the wiser, still it was but civil to give it before I made my request
for assistance; so, in reply, I said,---</p>

<p>'My name is Whittingham--Richard Whittingham, an English
gentleman, staying at---' To my infinite surprise, a light of pleased
intelligence came over the giant's face; he made me a low bow, and
said (still in the same curious dialect) that I was welcome, that I
was long expected.</p>

<p>'Long expected!' what could the fellow mean? Had I stumbled on a
nest of relations by John Calvin's side, who had heard of my
genealogical inquiries, and were gratified and interested by them?
But I was too much pleased to be under shelter for the night to think
it necessary to account for my agreeable reception before I enjoyed
it. Just as he was opening the great, heavy battants of the door that
led from the hall to the interior, he turned round and said,---</p>

<p>'Apparently Monsieur le Geanquilleur is not come with you.'</p>

<p>'No! I am all alone; I have lost my way,'--and I was going on with
my explanation, when he, as if quite indifferent to it, led the way
up a great stone staircase, as wide as many rooms, and having on each
landing-place massive iron wickets, in a heavy framework; these the
porter unlocked with the solemn slowness of age. Indeed, a strange,
mysterious awe of the centuries that had passed away since this
chateau was built, came over me as I waited for the turning of the
ponderous keys in the ancient locks. I could almost have fancied that
I heard a mighty rushing murmur (like the ceaseless sound of a
distant sea, ebbing and flowing for ever and for ever), coming forth
from the great, vacant galleries that opened out on each side of the
broad staircase, and were to be dimly perceived in the darkness above
us. It was as if the voices of generations of men yet echoed and
eddied in the silent air. It was strange, too, that my friend the
porter going before me, ponderously in firm, with his feeble old
hands striving in vain to keep the tall flambeau he held steadily
before him,--strange, I say, that he was the only domestic I saw in
the vast halls and passages, or met with on the grand staircase. At
length we stood before the gilded doors that led into the saloon
where the family--or it might be the company, so great was the buzz
of voices--was assembled. I would have remonstrated when I found he
was going to introduce me, dusty and travel-smeared, in a morning
costume that was not even my best, into this grand salon, with nobody
knew how many ladies and gentlemen assembled; but the obstinate old
man was evidently bent upon taking me straight to his master, and
paid no heed to my words.</p>

<p>The doors flew open, and I was ushered into a saloon curiously
full of pale light, which did not culminate on any spot, nor proceed
from any centre, nor flicker with any motion of the air, but filled
every nook and corner, making all things deliciously distinct;
different from our light of gas or candle, as is the difference
between a clear southern atmosphere and that of our misty
England.</p>

<p>At the first moment, my arrival excited no attention, the
apartment was so full of people, all intent on their own
conversation. But my friend the porter went up to a handsome lady of
middle age, richly attired in that antique manner which fashion has
brought round again of late years, and, waiting first in an attitude
of deep respect till her attention fell upon him, told her my name
and something about me, as far as I could guess from the gestures of
the one and the sudden glance of the eye of the other.</p>

<p>She immediately came towards me with the most friendly actions of
greeting, even before she had advanced near enough to speak.
Then,--and was it not strange?--her words and accent were that of the
commonest peasant of the country. Yet she herself looked highbred,
and would have been dignified had she been a shade less restless, had
her countenance worn a little less lively and inquisitive expression.
I had been poking a good deal about the old parts of Tours, and had
had to understand the dialect of the people who dwelt in the Marche
au Vendredi and similar places, or I really should not have
understood my handsome hostess, as she offered to present me to her
husband, a henpecked, gentlemanly man, who was more quaintly attired
than she in the very extreme of that style of dress. I thought to
myself that in France, as in England, it is the provincials who carry
fashion to such an excess as to become ridiculous.</p>

<p>However, he spoke (still in the patois) of his pleasure in making
my acquaintance, and led me to a strange, uneasy easy-chair, much of
a piece with the rest of the furniture, which might have taken its
place without any anachronism by the side of that in the Hotel Cluny.
Then again began the clatter of French voices, which my arrival had
for an instant interrupted, and I had leisure to look about me.
Opposite to me sat a very sweet-looking lady, who must have been a
great beauty in her youth, I should think, and would be charming in
old age, from the sweetness of her countenance. She was, however,
extremely fat, and on seeing her feet laid up before her on a
cushion, I at once perceived that they were so swollen as to render
her incapable of walking, which probably brought on her excessive
embonpoint. Her hands were plump and small, but rather coarse-grained
in texture, not quite so clean as they might have been, and
altogether not so aristocratic-looking as the charming face. Her
dress was of superb black velvet, ermine-trimmed, with diamonds
thrown all abroad over it.</p>

<p>Not far from her stood the least little man I had ever seen; of
such admirable proportions no one could call him a dwarf, because
with that word we usually associate something of deformity; but yet
with an elfin look of shrewd, hard, worldly wisdom in his face that
marred the impression which his delicate, regular, little features
would otherwise have conveyed. Indeed, I do not think he was quite of
equal rank with the rest of the company, for his dress was
inappropriate to the occasion (and he apparently was an invited,
while I was an involuntary guest); and one or two of his gestures and
actions were more like the tricks of an uneducated rustic than
anything else. To explain what I mean: his boots had evidently seen
much service, and had been re-topped, re-heeled, resoled to the
extent of cobbler's powers. Why should he have come in them if they
were not his best--his only pair? And what can be more ungenteel than
poverty? Then again he had an uneasy trick of putting his hand up to
his throat, as if he expected to find something the matter with it;
and he had the awkward habit--which I do not think he could have
copied from Dr Johnson, because most probably he had never heard of
him--of trying always to retrace his steps on the exact boards on
which he had trodden to arrive at any particular part of the room.
Besides, to settle the question, I once heard him addressed as
Monsieur Poucet, without any aristocratic 'de' for a prefix; and
nearly every one else in the room was a marquis, at any rate.</p>

<p>I say, 'nearly every one'; for some strange people had the entree;
unless, indeed, they were, like me, benighted. One of the guests I
should have taken for a servant, but for the extraordinary influence
he seemed to have over the man I took for his master, and who never
did anything without, apparently, being urged thereto by this
follower. The master, magnificently dressed, but ill at ease in his
clothes, as if they had been made for some one else, was a
weak-looking, handsome man, continually sauntering about, and I
almost guessed an object of suspicion to some of the gentlemen
present, which, perhaps, drove him on the companionship of his
follower, who was dressed something in the style of an ambassador's
chasseur; yet it was not a chasseur's dress after all; it was
something more thoroughly old-world; boots half way up his
ridiculously small legs, which clattered as he walked along, as if
they were too large for his little feet; and a great quantity of grey
fur, as trimming to coat, court-mantle, boots, cap--everything. You
know the way in which certain countenances remind you perpetually of
some animal, be it bird or beast! Well, this chasseur (as I will call
him for want of a better name) was exceedingly like the great Tom-cat
that you have seen so often in my chambers, and laughed at almost as
often for his uncanny gravity of demeanour. Grey whiskers has my
Tom--grey whiskers had the chasseur: grey hair overshadows the upper
lip of my Tom--grey mustachios hid that of the chasseur. The pupils
of Tom's eyes dilate and contract as I had thought cats' pupils only
could do, until I saw those of the chasseur. To be sure, canny as Tom
is, the chasseur had the advantage in the more intelligent
expression. He seemed to have obtained most complete sway over his
master or patron, whose looks he watched, and whose steps he
followed, with a kind of distrustful interest that puzzled me
greatly.</p>

<p>There were several other groups in the more distant part of the
saloon, all of the stately old school, all grand and noble, I
conjectured from their bearing. They seemed perfectly well acquainted
with each other, as if they were in the habit of meeting. But I was
interrupted in my observations by the tiny little gentleman on the
opposite side of the room coming across to take a place beside me. It
is no difficult matter to a Frenchman to slide into conversation, and
so gracefully aid my pigmy friend keep up the character of the
nation, that we were almost confidential before ten minutes had
elapsed.</p>

<p>Now I was quite aware that the welcome which all had extended to
me, from the porter up to the vivacious lady and meek lord of the
castle, was intended for some other person. But it required either a
degree of moral courage, of which I cannot boast, or the
self-reliance and conversational powers of a bolder and cleverer man
than I, to undeceive people who had fallen into so fortunate a
mistake for me. Yet the little man by my side insinuated himself so
much into my confidence, that I had half a mind to tell him of my
exact situation, and to turn him into a friend and an ally.</p>

<p>'Madame is perceptibly growing older,' said he, in the midst of my
perplexity, glancing at our hostess.</p>

<p>'Madame is still a very fine woman,' replied I.</p>

<p>'Now, is it not strange,' continued he, lowering his voice, 'how
women almost invariably praise the absent, or departed, as if they
were angels of light, while as for the present, or the living'--here
he shrugged up his little shoulders, and made an expressive pause.
'Would you believe it! Madame is always praising her late husband to
monsieur's face; till, in fact, we guests are quite perplexed how to
look: for, you know, the late M. de Retz's character was quite
notorious,--everybody has heard of him.' All the world of Touraine,
thought I, but I made an assenting noise.</p>

<p>At this instant, monsieur our host came up to me, and with a civil
look of tender interest (such as some people put on when they inquire
after your mother, about whom they do not care one straw), asked if I
had heard lately how my cat was? 'How my cat was!' what could the man
mean? My cat! Could he mean the tailless Tom, born in the Isle of
Man, and now supposed to be keeping guard against the incursions of
rats and mice into my chambers in London? Tom is, as you know, on
pretty good terms with some of my friends, using their legs for
rubbing-posts without scruple, and highly esteemed by them for his
gravity of demeanour, and wise manner of winking his eyes. But could
his fame have reached across the Channel? However, an answer must be
returned to the inquiry, as monsieur's face was bent down to mine
with a look of polite anxiety; so I, in my turn, assumed an
expression of gratitude, and assured him that, to the best of my
belief, my cat was in remarkably good health.</p>

<p>'And the climate agrees with her?'</p>

<p>'Perfectly,' said I, in a maze of wonder at this deep solicitude
in a tailless cat who had lost one foot and half an ear in some cruel
trap. My host smiled a sweet smile, and, addressing a few words to my
little neighbour, passed on.</p>

<p>'How wearisome those aristocrats are!' quoth my neighbour, with a
slight sneer. 'Monsieur's conversation rarely extends to more than
two sentences to any one. By that time his faculties are exhausted,
and he needs the refreshment of silence. You and I, monsieur, are, at
any rate, indebted to our own wits for our rise in the world!'</p>

<p>Here again I was bewildered! As you know, I am rather proud of my
descent from families which, if not noble themselves, are allied to
nobility,--and as to my 'rise in the world'--if I had risen, it would
have been rather for balloon-like qualities than for mother-wit, to
being unencumbered with heavy ballast either in my head or my
pockets. However, it was my cue to agree: so I smiled again.</p>

<p>'For my part,' said he, 'if a man does not stick at trifles, if he
knows how to judiciously add to, or withhold facts, and is not
sentimental in his parade of humanity, he is sure to do well; sure to
affix a de or von to his name, and end his days in comfort. There is
an example of what I am saying'--and he glanced furtively at the
weak-looking master of the sharp, intelligent servant, whom I have
called the chasseur.</p>

<p>'Monsieur le Marquis would never have been anything but a miller's
son, if it had not been for the talents of his servant. Of course you
know his antecedents?'</p>

<p>I was going to make some remarks on the changes in the order of
the peerage since the days of Louis XVI--going, in fact, to be very
sensible and historical--when there was a slight commotion among the
people at the other end of the room. Lacqueys in quaint liveries must
have come in from behind the tapestry, I suppose (for I never saw
them enter, though I sate right opposite to the doors), and were
handing about the slight beverages and slighter viands which are
considered sufficient refreshments, but which looked rather meagre to
my hungry appetite. These footmen were standing solemnly opposite to
a lady,--beautiful, splendid as the dawn, but--sound asleep in a
magnificent settee. A gentleman who showed so much irritation at her
ill-timed slumbers, that I think he must have been her husband, was
trying to awaken her with actions not far removed from shakings. All
in vain; she was quite unconscious of his annoyance, or the smiles of
the company, or the automatic solemnity of the waiting footman, or
the perplexed anxiety of monsieur and madame.</p>

<p>My little friend sat down with a sneer, as if his curiosity was
quenched in contempt.</p>

<p>'Moralists would make an infinity of wise remarks on that scene,'
said he. 'In the first place, note the ridiculous position into which
their superstitious reverence for rank and title puts all these
people. Because monsieur is a reigning prince over some minute
principality, the exact situation of which no one has as yet
discovered, no one must venture to take their glass of eau sucre till
Madame la Princesse awakens; and, judging from past experience, those
poor lacqueys may have to stand for a century before that happens.
Next--always speaking as a moralist, you will observe--note how
difficult it is to break off bad habits acquired in youth!'</p>

<p>Just then the prince succeeded, by what means I did not see, in
awaking the beautiful sleeper. But at first she did not remember
where she was, and looking up at her husband with loving eyes, she
smiled and said,---</p>

<p>'Is it you, my prince?'</p>

<p>But he was too conscious of the suppressed amusement of the
spectators and his own consequent annoyance, to be reciprocally
tender, and turned away with some little French expression, best
rendered into English by 'Pooh, pooh, my dear!'</p>

<p>After I had had a glass of delicious wine of some unknown quality,
my courage was in rather better plight than before, and I told my
cynical little neighbour--whom I must say I was beginning to
dislike--that I had lost my way in the wood, and had arrived at the
chateau quite by mistake.</p>

<p>He seemed mightily amused at my story; said that the same thing
had happened to himself more than once; and told me that I had better
luck than he had on one of these occasions, when, from his account,
he must have been in considerable danger of his life. He ended his
story by making me admire his boots, which he said he still wore,
patched though they were, and all their excellent quality lost by
patching, because they were of such a first-rate make for long
pedestrian excursions. 'Though, indeed,' he wound up by saying, 'the
new fashion of railroads would seem to supersede the necessity for
this description of boots.'</p>

<p>When I consulted him as to whether I ought to make myself known to
my host and hostess as a benighted traveller, instead of the guest
whom they had taken me for, he exclaimed, 'By no means! I hate such
squeamish morality.' And he seemed much offended by my innocent
question, as if it seemed by implication to condemn something in
himself. He was offended and silent; and just at this moment I caught
the sweet, attractive eyes of the lady opposite--that lady whom I
named at first as being no longer in the bloom of youth, but as being
somewhat infirm about the feet, which were supported on a raised
cushion before her. Her looks seemed to say, 'Come here, and let us
have some conversation together'; and, with a bow of silent excuse to
my little companion, I went across to the lame old lady. She
acknowledged my coming with the prettiest gesture of thanks possible;
and, half apologetically, said, 'It is a little dull to be unable to
move about on such evenings as this; but it is a just punishment to
me for my early vanities. My poor feet, that were by nature so small,
are now taking their revenge for my cruelty in forcing them into such
little slippers... Besides, monsieur,' with a pleasant smile, 'I
thought it was possible you might be weary of the malicious sayings
of your little neighbour. He has not borne the best character in his
youth, and such men are sure to be cynical in their old age.'</p>

<p>'Who is he?' asked I, with English abruptness.</p>

<p>'His name is Poucet, and his father was, I believe, a woodcutter,
or charcoal burner, or something of the sort. They do tell sad
stories of connivance at murder, ingratitude, and obtaining money on
false pretences--but you will think me as bad as he if I go on with
my slanders. Rather let us admire the lovely lady coming up towards
us, with the roses in her hand--I never see her without roses, they
are so closely connected with her past history, as you are doubtless
aware. Ah, beauty!' said my companion to the lady drawing near to us,
'it is like you to come to me, now that I can no longer go to you.'
Then turning to me, and gracefully drawing me into the conversation,
she said, 'You must know that, although we never met until we were
both married, we have been almost like sisters ever since. There have
been so many points of resemblance in our circumstances, and I think
I may say in our characters. We had each two elder sisters--mine were
but half-sisters, though--who were not so kind to us as they might
have been.'</p>

<p>'But have been sorry for it since,' put in the other lady.</p>

<p>'Since we have married princes,' continued the same lady, with an
arch smile that had nothing of unkindness in it, 'for we both have
married far above our original stations in life; we are both
unpunctual in our habits, and, in consequence of this failing of
ours, we have both had to suffer mortification and pain.'</p>

<p>'And both are charming,' said a whisper close behind me. 'My lord
the marquis, say it--say, "And both are charming."'</p>

<p>'And both are charming,' was spoken aloud by another voice. I
turned, and saw the wily, cat-like chasseur, prompting his master to
make civil speeches.</p>

<p>The ladies bowed with that kind of haughty acknowledgment which
shows that compliments from such a source are distasteful. But our
trio of conversation was broken up, and I was sorry for it. The
marquis looked as if he had been stirred up to make that one speech,
and hoped that he would not be expected to say more; while behind him
stood the chasseur, half impertinent and half servile in his ways and
attitudes. The ladies, who were real ladies, seemed to be sorry for
the awkwardness of the marquis, and addressed some trifling questions
to him, adapting themselves to the subjects on which he could have no
trouble in answering. The chasseur, meanwhile, was talking to himself
in a growling tone of voice. I had fallen a little into the
background at this interruption in a conversation which promised to
be so pleasant, and I could not help hearing his words.</p>

<p>'Really, De Carabas grows more stupid every day. I have a great
mind to throw off his boots, and leave him to his fate. I was
intended for a court, and to a court I will go, and make my own
fortune as I have made his. The emperor will appreciate my
talents.'</p>

<p>And such are the habits of the French, or such his forgetfulness
of good manners in his anger, that he spat right and left on the
parquetted floor.</p>

<p>Just then a very ugly, very pleasant-looking man, came towards the
two ladies to whom I had lately been speaking, leading up to them a
delicate, fair woman, dressed all in the softest white, as if she
were vouee au blanc. I do not think there was a bit of colour about
her. I thought I heard her making, as she came along, a little noise
of pleasure, not exactly like the singing of a tea-kettle, nor yet
like the cooing of a dove, but reminding me of each sound.</p>

<p>'Madame de Mioumiou was anxious to see you,' said he, addressing
the lady with the roses, 'so I have brought her across to give you a
pleasure!' What an honest, good face! but oh! how ugly! And yet I
liked his ugliness better than most persons' beauty. There was a look
of pathetic acknowledgment of his ugliness, and a deprecation of your
too hasty judgment, in his countenance that was positively winning.
The soft, white lady kept glancing at my neighbour the chasseur, as
if they had had some former acquaintance, which puzzled me very much,
as they were of such different rank. However, their nerves were
evidently strung to the same tune, for at a sound behind the
tapestry, which was more like the scuttering of rats and mice than
anything else, both Madame de Mioumiou and the chasseur started with
the most eager look of anxiety on their countenances, and by their
restless movements--madame's panting, and the fiery dilation of his
eyes--one might see that commonplace sounds affected them both in a
manner very different to the rest of the company. The ugly husband of
the lovely lady with the roses now addressed himself to me.</p>

<p>'We are much disappointed,' he said, 'in finding that monsieur is
not accompanied by his countryman--le grand Jean d'Angleterre; I
cannot pronounce his name rightly'--and he looked at me to help him
out.</p>

<p>'Le grand Jean d'Angleterre!' Now who was le grand Jean
d'Angleterre? John Bull? John Russell? John Bright?</p>

<p>'Jean--Jean'--continued the gentleman, seeing my embarrassment.
'Ah, these terrible English names--"Jean de Geanquilleur!"</p>

<p>I was as wise as ever. And yet the name struck me as familiar, but
slightly disguised. I repeated it to myself. It was mighty like John
the Giant-killer, only his friends always call that worthy, 'Jack'. I
said the name aloud.</p>

<p>'Ah, that is it!' said he. 'But why has he not accompanied you to
our little reunion to-night?'</p>

<p>I had been rather puzzled once or twice before, but this serious
question added considerably to my perplexity. Jack the Giant-killer
had once, it is true, been rather an intimate friend of mine, as far
as (printer's) ink and paper can keep up a friendship, but I had not
heard his name mentioned for years; and for aught I knew he lay
enchanted with King Arthur's knights, who lie entranced until the
blast of the trumpets of four mighty kings shall call them to help at
England's need. But the question had been asked in serious earnest by
that gentleman, whom I more wished to think well of me than I did any
other person in the room. So I answered respectfully that it was long
since I had heard anything of my countryman; but that I was sure it
would have given him as much pleasure as it was doing myself to have
been present at such an agreeable gathering of friends. He bowed, and
then the lame lady took up the word.</p>

<p>'To-night is the night when, of all the year, this great old
forest surrounding the castle is said to be haunted by the phantom of
a little peasant girl who once lived hereabouts; the tradition is
that she was devoured by a wolf. In former days I have seen her on
this night out of yonder window at the end of the gallery. Will you,
ma belie, take monsieur to see the view outside by the moonlight (you
may possibly see the phantom-child); and leave me to a little
tete-a-tete with your husband?'</p>

<p>With a gentle movement the lady with the roses complied with the
other's request, and we went to a great window, looking down on the
forest, in which I had lost my way. The tops of the far-spreading and
leafy trees lay motionless beneath us in that pale, wan light, which
shows objects almost as distinct in form, though not in colour, as by
day. We looked down on the countless avenues, which seemed to
converge from all quarters to the great old castle; and suddenly
across one, quite near to us, there passed the figure of a little
girl, with the 'capuchon' on, that takes the place of a peasant
girl's bonnet in France. She had a basket on one arm, and by her, on
the side to which her head was turned, there went a wolf. I could
almost have said it was licking her hand, as if in penitent love, if
either penitence or love had ever been a quality of wolves,--but
though not of living, perhaps it may be of phantom wolves.</p>

<p>'There, we have seen her!' exclaimed my beautiful companion.
'Though so long dead, her simple story of household goodness and
trustful simplicity still lingers in the hearts of all who have ever
heard of her; and the country-people about here say that seeing that
phantom-child on this anniversary brings good luck for the year. Let
us hope that we shall share in the traditionary good fortune. Ah!
here is Madame de Retz--she retains the name of her first husband,
you know, as he was of higher rank than the present.' We were joined
by our hostess.</p>

<p>'If monsieur is fond of the beauties of nature and art,' said she,
perceiving that I had been looking at the view from the great window,
'he will perhaps take pleasure in seeing the picture.' Here she
sighed, with a little affectation of grief. 'You know the picture I
allude to,' addressing my companion, who bowed assent, and smiled a
little maliciously, as I followed the lead of madame.</p>

<p>I went after her to the other end of the saloon, noting by the way
with what keen curiosity she caught up what was passing either in
word or action on each side of her. When we stood opposite to the end
wall, I perceived a full-length picture of a handsome,
peculiar-looking man, with--in spite of his good looks--a very fierce
and scowling expression. My hostess clasped her hands together as her
arms hung down in front, and sighed once more. Then, half in
soliloquy, she said,---</p>

<p>'He was the love of my youth; his stern yet manly character first
touched this heart of mine. When--when shall I cease to deplore his
loss!'</p>

<p>Not being acquainted with her enough to answer this question (if,
indeed, it were not sufficiently answered by the fact of her second
marriage), I felt awkward; and, by way of saying something, I
remarked,---</p>

<p>'The countenance strikes me as resembling something I have seen
before--in an engraving from an historical picture, I think; only, it
is there the principal figure in a group: he is holding a lady by her
hair, and threatening her with his scimitar, while two cavaliers are
rushing up the stairs, apparently only just in time to save her
life.'</p>

<p>'Alas, alas!' said she, 'you too accurately describe a miserable
passage in my life, which has often been represented in a false
light. The best of husbands'--here she sobbed, and became slightly
inarticulate with her grief--'will sometimes be displeased. I was
young and curious, he was justly angry with my disobedience--my
brothers were too hasty--the consequence is, I became a widow!'</p>

<p>After due respect for her tears, I ventured to suggest some
commonplace consolation. She turned round sharply.</p>

<p>'No, monsieur: my only comfort is that I have never forgiven the
brothers who interfered so cruelly, in such an uncalled-for manner,
between my dear husband and myself. To quote my friend Monsieur
Sganarelle--"Ce sont petites choses qui sont de temps en temps
necessaires dans l'amitie; et cinq ou six coups d'epee entre gens qui
s'aiment ne font que ragaillardir l'affection." You observe the
colouring is not quite what it should be?'</p>

<p>'In this light the beard is of rather a peculiar tint,' said
I.</p>

<p>'Yes: the painter did not do it justice. It was most lovely, and
gave him such a distinguished air, quite different from the common
herd. Stay, I will show you the exact colour, if you will come near
this flambeau!' And going near the light, she took off a bracelet of
hair, with a magnificent clasp of pearls. It was peculiar, certainly.
I did not know what to say. His precious lovely beard!' said she.
'And the pearls go so well with the delicate blue!'</p>

<p>Her husband, who had come up to us, and waited till her eye fell
upon him before venturing to speak, now said, 'It is strange Monsieur
Ogre is not yet arrived!'</p>

<p>'Not at all strange,' said she, tartly. 'He was always very
stupid, and constantly falls into mistakes, in which he comes worse
off; and it is very well he does, for he is a credulous and cowardly
fellow. Not at all strange! If you will'--turning to her husband, so
that I hardly heard her words, until I caught--'Then everybody would
have their rights, and we should have no more trouble. Is it not,
monsieur?' addressing me.</p>

<p>'If I were in England, I should imagine madame was speaking of the
reform bill, or the millennium,--but I am in ignorance.'</p>

<p>And just as I spoke, the great folding-doors were thrown open
wide, and every one started to their feet to greet a little old lady,
leaning on a thin, black wand--and---</p>

<p>'Madame la Feemarraine,' was announced by a chorus of sweet shrill
voices.</p>

<p>And in a moment I was lying in the grass close by a hollow
oak-tree, with the slanting glory of the dawning day shining full in
my face, and thousands of little birds and delicate insects piping
and warbling out their welcome to the ruddy splendour.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6"></a>Disappearances</h2>

<p>I am not in the habit of seeing the Household Words regularly; but
a friend, who lately sent me some of the back numbers, recommended me
to read "all the papers relating to the Detective and Protective
Police," which I accordingly did--not as the generality of readers
have done, as they appeared week by week, or with pauses between, but
consecutively, as a popular history of the Metropolitan Police; and,
as I suppose it may also be considered, a history of the police force
in every large town in England. When I had ended these papers, I did
not feel disposed to read any others at that time, but preferred
falling into a train of reverie and recollection.</p>

<p>First of all I remembered, with a smile, the unexpected manner in
which a relation of mine was discovered by an acquaintance, who had
mislaid or forgotten Mr. B.'s address. Now my dear cousin, Mr. B.,
charming as he is in many points, has the little peculiarity of
liking to change his lodgings once every three months on an average,
which occasions some bewilderment to his country friends, who have no
sooner learnt the 19 Belle Vue Road, Hampstead, than they have to
take pains to forget that address, and to remember the 27 1/2 Upper
Brown Street, Camberwell; and so on, till I would rather learn a page
of "Walker's Pronouncing Dictionary," than try to remember the
variety of directions which I have had to put on my letters to Mr. B.
during the last three years. Last summer it pleased him to remove to
a beautiful village not ten miles out of London, where there is a
railway station. Thither his friend sought him. (I do not now speak
of the following scent there had been through three or four different
lodgings, where Mr. B. had been residing, before his country friend
ascertained that he was now lodging at R---.) He spent the morning in
making inquiries as to Mr. B.'s whereabouts in the village; but many
gentlemen were lodging there for the summer, and neither butcher nor
baker could inform him where Mr. B. was staying; his letters were
unknown at the post-office, which was accounted for by the
circumstance of their always being directed to his office in town. At
last the country friend sauntered back to the railway-office, and
while he waited for the train he made inquiry, as a last resource, of
the book-keeper at the station. "No, sir, I cannot tell you where Mr.
B. lodges--so many gentlemen go by the trains; but I have no doubt
but that the person standing by that pillar can inform you." The
individual to whom he directed the inquirer's attention had the
appearance of a tradesman--respectable enough, yet with no
pretensions to "gentility," and had, apparently, no more urgent
employment than lazily watching the passengers who came dropping in
to the station. However, when he was spoken to, he answered civilly
and promptly. "Mr. B.? tall gentleman, with light hair? Yes, sir, I
know Mr. B. He lodges at No. 8 Morton Villas--has done these three
weeks or more; but you'll not find him there, sir, now. He went to
town by the eleven o'clock train, and does not usually return until
the half-past four train."</p>

<p>The country friend had no time to lose in returning to the
village, to ascertain the truth of this statement. He thanked his
informant, and said he would call on Mr. B. at his office in town;
but before he left R--station, he asked the book-keeper who the
person was to whom he had referred him for information as to his
friend's place of residence. "One of the Detective Police, sir," was
the answer. I need hardly say that Mr. B., not without a little
surprise, confirmed the accuracy of the policeman's report in every
particular. When I heard this anecdote of my cousin and his friend, I
thought that there could be no more romances written on the same kind
of plot as Caleb Williams; the principal interest of which, to the
superficial reader, consists in the alternation of hope and fear,
that the hero may, or may not, escape his pursuer. It is long since I
have read the story, and I forget the name of the offended and
injured gentleman whose privacy Caleb has invaded; but I know that
his pursuit of Caleb--his detection of the various hiding-places of
the latter--his following up of slight clues--all, in fact, depended
upon his own energy, sagacity, and perseverance. The interest was
caused by the struggle of man against man; and the uncertainty as to
which would ultimately be successful in his object: the unrelenting
pursuer, or the ingenious Caleb, who seeks by every device to conceal
himself. Now, in 1851, the offended master would set the Detective
Police to work; there would be no doubt as to their success; the only
question would be as to the time that would elapse before the
hiding-place could be detected, and that could not be a question
long. It is no longer a struggle between man and man, but between a
vast organised machinery, and a weak, solitary individual; we have no
hopes, no fears--only certainty. But if the materials of pursuit and
evasion, as long as the chase is confined to England, are taken away
from the store-house of the romancer, at any rate we can no more be
haunted by the idea of the possibility of mysterious disappearances;
and any one who has associated much with those who were alive at the
end of the last century, can testify that there was some reason for
such fears.</p>

<p>When I was a child, I was sometimes permitted to accompany a
relation to drink tea with a very clever old lady, of one hundred and
twenty--or so I thought then; I now think she, perhaps, was only
about seventy. She was lively, and intelligent, and had seen and
known much that was worth narrating. She was a cousin of the Sneyds,
the family whence Mr. Edgeworth took two of his wives; had known
Major Andre; had mixed in the Old Whig Society that the beautiful
Duchess of Devonshire and Mrs. Crewe of "Buff and Blue" fame gathered
round them; and her father had been one of the early patrons of the
lovely Miss Linley. I name these facts to show that she was too
intelligent and cultivated by association, as well as by natural
powers, to lend an over-easy credence to the marvellous; and yet I
have heard her relate stories of disappearances which haunted my
imagination longer than any tale of wonder. One of her stories was
this:--Her father's estate lay in Shropshire, and his park-gates
opened right on to a scattered village of which he was landlord. The
houses formed a straggling irregular street--here a garden, next a
gable-end of a farm, there a row of cottages, and so on. Now, at the
end house or cottage lived a very respectable man and his wife. They
were well known in the village, and were esteemed for the patient
attention which they paid to the husband's father, a paralytic old
man. In winter, his chair was near the fire; in summer, they carried
him out into the open space in front of the house to bask in the
sunshine, and to receive what placid amusement he could from watching
the little passings to and fro of the villagers. He could not move
from his bed to his chair without help. One hot and sultry June day,
all the village turned out to the hay-fields. Only the very old and
the very young remained.</p>

<p>The old father of whom I have spoken was carried out to bask in
the sunshine that afternoon as usual, and his son and daughter-in-law
went to the hay-making. But when they came home in the early evening,
their paralysed father had disappeared--was gone! and from that day
forwards, nothing more was ever heard of him. The old lady, who told
this story, said, with the quietness that always marked the
simplicity of her narration, that every inquiry which her father
could make was made, and that it could never be accounted for.' No
one had observed any stranger in the village; no small household
robbery, to which the old man might have been supposed an obstacle,
had been committed in his son's dwelling that afternoon. The son and
daughter-in-law (noted, too, for their attention to the helpless
father) had been a-field among all the neighbours the whole of the
time. In short, it never was accounted for; and left a painful
impression on many minds.</p>

<p>I will answer for it, the Detective Police would have ascertained
every fact relating to it in a week.</p>

<p>This story, from its mystery, was painful, but had no consequences
to make it tragical. The next which I shall tell (and although
traditionary, these anecdotes of disappearances which I relate in
this paper are correctly repeated, and were believed by my informants
to be strictly true) bad consequences, and melancholy ones, too. The
scene of it is in a little country-town, surrounded by the estates of
several gentlemen of large property. About a hundred years ago there
lived in this small town an attorney, with his mother and sister. He
was agent for one of the squires near, and received rents for him on
stated days, which, of course, were well known. He went at these
times to a small public-house, perhaps five miles from--, where the
tenants met him, paid their rents, and were entertained at dinner
afterwards. One night he did not return from this festivity. He never
returned. The gentleman whose agent he was, employed the Dogberrys of
the time to find him, and the missing cash; the mother, whose support
and comfort he was, sought him with all the perseverance of faithful
love. But he never returned; and by-and-by the rumour spread that he
must have gone abroad with the money; his mother heard the whispers
all around her, and could not disprove it; and so her heart broke,
and she died. Years after, I think as many as fifty, the well-to-do
butcher and grazier of--died; but, before his death, he confessed
that he had waylaid Mr.--on the heath, close to the town, almost
within call of his own house, intending only to rob him, but, meeting
with more resistance than he anticipated, had been provoked to stab
him; and had buried him that very night deep under the loose sand of
the heath. There his skeleton was found; but too late for his poor
mother to know that his fame was cleared. His sister, too, was dead,
unmarried, for no one liked the possibilities which might arise from
being connected with the family. None cared if he were guilty or
innocent now. If our Detective Police had only been in existence!</p>

<p>This last is hardly a story of unaccounted-for disappearance. It
is only unaccounted for in one generation. But disappearances never
to be accounted for on any supposition are not uncommon among the
traditions of the last century. I have heard (and I think I have read
it in one of the earlier numbers of Chambers's Journal) of a marriage
which took place in Lincolnshire about the year 1750. It was not then
de rigueur that the happy couple should set out on a wedding journey;
but instead, they and their friends had a merry jovial dinner at the
house of either bride or groom; and in this instance the whole party
adjourned to the bridegroom's residence, and dispersed, some to
ramble in the garden, some to rest in the house until the
dinner-hour. The bridegroom, it is to be supposed, was with his
bride, when he was suddenly summoned away by a domestic, who said he
was never seen more. The same tradition hangs about that a stranger
wished to speak to him; and henceforward an old deserted Welsh hall
standing in a wood near Festiniog; there, too, the bridegroom was
sent for to give audience to a stranger on his wedding-day, and
disappeared from the face of the earth from that time; but there,
they tell in addition, that the bride lived long--that she passed her
three-score years and ten, but that daily, during all those years,
while there was light of sun or moon to lighten the earth, she sat
watching--watching at one particular window which commanded a view of
the approach to the house. Her whole faculties, her whole mental
powers, became absorbed in that weary watching; long before she died,
she was childish, and only conscious of one wish--to sit in that long
high window, and watch the road along which he might come. She was as
faithful as Evangeline, if pensive and inglorious.</p>

<p>That these two similar stories of disappearance on a wedding-day
"obtained," as the French say, shows us that anything which adds to
our facility of communication, and organisation of means, adds to our
security of life. Only let a bridegroom try to disappear from an
untamed Katherine of a bride, and he will soon be brought home, like
a recreant coward, overtaken by the electric telegraph, and clutched
back to his fate by a detective policeman.</p>

<p>Two more stories of disappearance and I have done. I will give you
the last in date first, because it is the most melancholy; and we
will wind up cheerfully (after a fashion). Some time between 1820 and
1830, there lived in North Shields a respectable old woman, and her
son, who was trying to struggle into sufficient knowledge of medicine
to go out as ship-surgeon in a Baltic vessel, and perhaps in this
manner to earn money enough to spend a session in Edinburgh. He was
furthered in all his plans by the late benevolent Dr. G. of that
town. I believe the usual premium was not required in his case; the
young man did many useful errands and offices which a finer young
gentleman would have considered beneath him; and he resided with his
mother in one of the alleys (or "chares") which lead down from the
main street of North Shields to the river. Dr. G. had been with a
patient all night, and left her very early on a winter's morning to
return home to bed; but first he stepped down to his apprentice's
home, and bade him get up, and follow him to his own house, where
some medicine was to be mixed, and then taken to the lady.
Accordingly, the poor lad came, prepared the dose, and set off with
it some time between five and six on a winter's morning. He was never
seen again. Dr. G. waited, thinking he was at his mother's house; she
waited, considering that he had gone to his day's work. And
meanwhile, as people remembered afterwards, the small vessel bound to
Edinburgh sailed out of port. The mother expected him back her whole
life long; but some years afterwards occurred the discoveries of the
Hare and Burke horrors, and people seemed to gain a dark glimpse at
his fate; but I never heard that it was fully ascertained, or indeed
more than surmised. I ought to add that all who knew him spoke
emphatically as to his steadiness of purpose and conduct, so as to
render it improbable in the highest degree that he had run off to
sea, or suddenly changed his plan of life in any way.</p>

<p>My last story is one of a disappearance which was accounted for
after many years. There is a considerable street in Manchester
leading from the centre of the town to some of the suburbs. This
street is called at one part Garratt, and afterwards--where it
emerges into gentility and, comparatively, country--Brook Street. It
derives its former name from an old black-and-white hall of the time
of Richard the Third, or thereabouts, to judge from the style of
building; they have closed in what is left of the old hall now; but a
few years since this old house was visible from the main road; it
stood low on some vacant ground, and appeared to be half in ruins. I
believe it was occupied by several poor families, who rented
tenements in the tumble-down dwelling. But formerly it was Gerrard
Hall (what a difference between Gerrard and Garratt!) and was
surrounded by a park with a clear brook running through it, with
pleasant fish-ponds (the name of these was preserved, until very
lately, on a street near), orchards, dovecots, and similar
appurtenances to the manor-houses of former days. I am almost sure
that the family to whom it belonged were Mosleys, probably a branch
of the tree of the Lord of the Manor of Manchester. Any topographical
work of the last century relating to their district would give the
name of the last proprietor of the old stock, and it is to him that
my story refers.</p>

<p>Many years ago there lived in Manchester two old maiden ladies of
high respectability. All their lives had been spent in the town, and
they were fond of relating the changes which had taken place within
their recollection, which extended back to seventy or eighty years
from the present time. They knew much of its traditionary history
from their father, as well; who, with his father before him, had been
respectable attorneys in Manchester during the greater part of the
last century; they were, also, agents for several of the county
families, who, driven from their old possessions by the enlargement
of the town, found some compensation in the increased value of any
land which they might choose to sell. Consequently the Messrs. S.,
father and son, were conveyancers in good repute, and acquainted with
several secret pieces of family history, one of which related to
Garratt Hall.</p>

<p>The owner of this estate, some time in the first half of the last
century, married young; he and his wife had several children, and
lived together in a quiet state of happiness for many years. At last,
business of some kind took the husband up to London; a week's journey
in those days. He wrote and announced his arrival; I do not think he
ever wrote again. He seemed to be swallowed up in the abyss of the
metropolis, for no friend (and the lady had many powerful friends)
could ever ascertain for her what had become of him; the prevalent
idea was that he had been attacked by some of the street-robbers who
prowled about in those days, that he had resisted, and had been
murdered. His wife gradually gave up all hopes of seeing him again,
and devoted herself to the care of her children; and so they went on,
tranquilly enough, until the heir came of age, when certain deeds
were necessary before he could legally take possession of the
property. These deeds Mr. S. (the family lawyer) stated had been
given up by him into the missing gentleman's keeping just before the
last mysterious journey to London, with which I think they were in
some way concerned. It was possible that they were still in
existence; some one in London might have them in possession, and be
either conscious or unconscious of their importance. At any rate, Mr.
S.'s advice to his client was that he should put an advertisement in
the London papers, worded so skilfully that any one who might hold
the important documents should understand to what it referred, and no
one else. This was accordingly done; and, although repeated at
intervals for some time, it met with no success. But at last a
mysterious answer was sent: to the effect that the deeds were in
existence, and should be given up; but only on certain conditions,
and to the heir himself. The young man, in consequence, went up to
London, and adjourned, according to directions, to an old house in
Barbican, where he was told by a man, apparently awaiting him, that
he must submit to be blindfolded, and must follow his guidance. He
was taken through several long passages before he left the house; at
the termination of one of these he was put into a sedan-chair, and
carried about for an hour or more; he always reported that there were
many turnings, and that he imagined he was set down finally not very
far from his starting-point.</p>

<p>When his eyes were unbandaged, he was in a decent sitting-room,
with tokens of family occupation lying about. A middle-aged gentleman
entered, and told him that, until a certain time had elapsed (which
should be indicated to him in a particular way, but of which the
length was not then named), he must swear to secrecy as to the means
by which he obtained possession of the deeds. This oath was taken;
and then the gentleman, not without some emotion, acknowledged
himself to be the missing father of the heir. It seems that he had
fallen in love with a damsel, a friend of the person with whom he
lodged. To this young woman he had represented himself as unmarried;
she listened willingly to his wooing, and her father, who was a
shopkeeper in the City, was not averse to the match, as the
Lancashire squire had a goodly presence, and many similar qualities,
which the shopkeeper thought might be acceptable to his customers.
The bargain was struck; the descendant of a knightly race married the
only daughter of the City shopkeeper, and that he had never repented
the step, he had taken; that his became the junior partner in the
business. Ho told his son lowly-born wife was sweet, docile, and
affectionate; that his family by her was large; and that he and they
were thriving and happy. He inquired after his first (or rather, I
should say, his true) wife with friendly affection; approved of what
she had done with regard to his estate, and the education of his
children; but said that he considered he was dead to her as she was
to him. When he really died he promised that a particular message,
the nature of which he specified, should be sent to his son at
Garratt; until then they would not hear more of each other, for it
was of no use attempting to trace him under his incognito, even if
the oath did not render such an attempt forbidden. I dare say the
youth had no great desire to trace out the father, who had been one
in name only. He returned to Lancashire; took possession of the
property at Manchester; and many years elapsed before he received the
mysterious intimation of his father's real death. After that, he
named the particulars connected with the recovery of the title-deeds
to Mr. S., and one or two intimate friends. When the family became
extinct, or removed from Garratt, it became no longer any very
closely-kept secret, and I was told the tale of the disappearance by
Miss S., the aged daughter of the family agent.</p>

<p>Once more, let me say, I am thankful I live in the days of the
Detective Police; if I am murdered, or commit bigamy, at any rate my
friends will have the comfort of knowing all about it.</p>

<p>... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...</p>

<p>A correspondent has favoured us with the sequel of the
disappearance of the pupil of Dr. G., who vanished from North
Shields, in charge of certain potions he was entrusted with, very
early one morning, to convey to a patient: "Dr. G.'s son married my
sister, and the young man who disappeared was a pupil in the house.
When he went out with the medicine, he was hardly dressed, having
merely thrown on some clothes; and he went in slippers--which
incidents induced the belief that he was made away with. After some
months his family put on mourning; and the G.'s (very timid people)
were so sure that he was murdered, that they wrote verses to his
memory, and became sadly worn by terror. But, after a long time (I
fancy, but am not sure, about a year and a half), came a letter from
the young man, who was doing well in America. His explanation was,
that a vessel was lying at the wharf about to sail in the morning,
and the youth, who had long meditated evasion, thought it a good
opportunity, and stepped on board, after leaving the medicine at the
proper door. I spent some weeks at Dr. G.'s after the occurrence; and
very doleful we used to be about it. But the next time I went they
were, naturally, very angry with the inconsiderate young man."</p>

<h2><a name="ch7"></a>Two Fragments of Ghost Stories</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>I have no objection to tell you to what I alluded the other night,
as I am too rational, I trust, to believe in ghosts; at the same
time, I own it has ever remained an unexplained circumstance; and the
impression it left on my own mind was so vivid and so painful that
for years I could not bear to think at all on the subject. To you,
even, I do not mind owning that I once made a considerable round to
avoid Birmingham as a sleeping-place. This was thoroughly ridiculous;
and so I felt it at the time. I think you know enough of my father
and mother to recall a little of the gentle formality of the Society
to which they used to belong. Don't you remember how my mother would
check any "vain talking" in her own mild, irresistible way? All tales
and stories which were not true were excluded from the dear old
nursery-library at Heverington. Much more so were ghosts and fairies
prohibited; though the knowledge that there were such things to be
talked about came to us, I don't know how. Do you know, I even now
draw back from telling the story of my fright! I do believe I am
making this preamble, in order to defer the real matter of my letter.
But now I will begin at once.</p>

<p>I was going back to school at Dunchurch; and my father could not
go with me, because of some special jury-case at Chester which he was
obliged to attend; so I was to be put in charge of the guard of the
coach as far as Birmingham, where a friend of my father's was to meet
me, and take me to sleep at his house. It was on the 26th of January;
so you may be sure it was dark when we got into Birmingham about
seven o'clock. The coach rumbled into an inn-yard, and I was wakened
out of my sleep by some one popping in a broad-brimmed hat (with a
head under it, I suppose; only the hat stood out in relief against
the light) and asking if Hannah Johnson was there? I remember feeling
frightened at saying "Yes," and wishing that some one were there to
answer for me; and at last I spoke sadly too loud--but I had tried
twice before, and no voice had come.</p>

<p>Well! I was soon bundled, more asleep than awake, into a gig; and
my luggage was all stowed away till morning, in the booking-office, I
suppose. We had a drive of two miles, or it might be two miles and a
half, out of the very thick of the town into a sort of suburb on a
hill-side. The houses were plain and commonplace enough (red-brick, I
saw the next morning, they were), with a long slip of garden, up
which we had to walk. A woman Friend came to the steps, with a candle
in her hand, to meet us; and I liked her from the first better than
her silent husband, who did his duty, but never spoke. She made me
take off my shoes; felt my stockings to see if they were wet; then
she hurried tea, to which I remember I had no sugar, because of the
slave-trade, which many good people were then striving to put down.
She talked a good deal to me; and, if her husband had not been there,
I should have talked much more openly back again; but, as it was, I
remember feeling sure he was listening behind his newspaper; and very
uncomfortable it made me. I recollect she had let the cat jump on her
knee and was stroking it, and it was purring; but he gave it a slap
and sent it down, saying, "Esther, thee hadst three drab gowns last
year. That cat will cost me as many this." I don't remember his
speaking again; but I know I was as glad as the cat to get out of the
room, and upstairs to my snug bedroom. The house was joined to
another; and, somehow, they dove-tailed together; so that, though
there was but one room in the front, there were two in width behind;
one on each side of the passage.</p>

<p>We breakfasted in the left-hand room at the back next morning; but
I never knew what the right-hand room was. Only, over it on the first
floor, was the chamber I was to sleep in that night; and very
comfortable it looked, with a pleasant fire, and a great deal of
crimson and white about the room. You went in, and had the fire on
your right-hand and the bed opposite to you, and the large window,
with the dressing-table under it, on the left. The house altogether
must have been eighty or ninety years old; I judge from the
chimney-pieces, which, I recollect, were very high, with narrow
shelves, and made of painted wood, with garlands tied with ribbons,
carved, not very well, upon them. The bed, I remember, was a great,
large one--too large for the room, I should think; but you heard me
say I have never seen it since that time. Judging from my
recollections, I should imagine the furniture had been picked up at
sales, in accordance with the thriftiness of the master of the house.
(I do not mention his name, because he has a nephew, a respectable
tea-dealer in Bull Street, and a member of the Society of Friends,
who would not, I am sure, like to have his name connected with a
ghost-story.)</p>

<p>All these things I was too tired to notice that night. I put my
feet into hot water--though I would much rather have gone straight to
bed--because my kind hostess urged it; and then it was found out I
had left my carpet-bag at the inn; so I had to wait till a night-gown
and night-cap of hers was aired. And at last I tumbled into bed.</p>

<p>I think I fell asleep directly; at any rate, I don't remember
anything of being awake. But, by-and-by, I wakened up suddenly. To
this day, I don't know what wakened me; but I was all at once
perfectly conscious, although at first I was puzzled to remember
where I was. The fire had burnt down, but not very much; there was,
however, not a great deal of light from it. But it seemed as if there
were some light behind the right-hand curtain at the head of the bed;
just as if some one had been in and put a candle down on the drawers,
which stood between the bed and the window. I thought I must have
forgotten to put the candle out, though I did not remember putting it
there. I had some debates with myself as to whether I would leave my
warm bed, and get up into the cold and put it out; and I think I
should never have troubled myself about it, if I had not remembered
that the candle would be burnt down before morning, and that perhaps
I might get a scolding from my host. Still, I was so lazy! and I
thought I could perhaps stretch out of bed far enough to put it out
without fairly getting up. So I shuffled to the cold side of the bed
(which was fully large enough, and indeed prepared for two
people).</p>

<p>I name this, because I remember the wide-awake feeling which the
icy coldness of the fine linen sheets gave me, when I was lying
across them; stretching out, I undrew the crimson moreen curtain.
There was no candle; but a bright light--very red; more like the very
earliest blush of dawn on a summer's morning than anything else; but
very red and glowing. It seemed to come from, or out of--I don't know
how--the figure of a woman, who sat in the easy chair by the head of
the bed. I think she was a young woman, but I did not see her face;
it was bent down over a little child which she held in her arms, and
rocked backwards and forwards, as if she were getting it to sleep,
with her cheek on its head. She took no notice of my drawing back the
curtain, though it made a rustling noise, and the rings grated a
little on the rod. I could draw the pattern of the chintz gown she
wore; of a kind called by my mother, a palampore: an Indian thing,
with a large straggling print on it, but which had been in fashion
many years before.</p>

<p>I don't think I was frightened then; at least, I looked curiously,
and did not drop the curtain, as I should have done if I had been
frightened, I think. I thought of her as somebody in great distress;
her gesture and the way she hung her head all showed that. I knew
very little about the people I was staying with; they might have
babies, for aught I knew, and this might be some friend or visitor,
who was soothing a restless child. I knew my mother often walked
about with my little brother who was teething. But it was rather
strange I had not seen this lady at tea; and a little strange too
that her dress was so very gay and bright-coloured, because in
general such dress would be considered by Friends to savour too much
of the world, and would be remonstrated against. While these thoughts
were passing through my mind--of course in much less time than it
takes me to write them down-the lady rose, and I dropped the curtain
and ...</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Well, my dear Bob, let those laugh who win! You, who were so much
amused at my being captivated by the queerly-worded advertisement of
lodgings in the "Guardian," would be glad enough, I fancy, to
exchange your small, dingy, smoky rooms in Manchester (even granted
the delights of a railway excursion every day during Whitsun-week)
for my Lorton Grange, though my host cannot write grammar, any more
than my hostess can speak it. I do like the spice which the
uncertainty of the result gives to any adventure; and therefore my
spirits grew higher and more boisterous, the wilder and more desolate
grew the hills and the moors, over which I passed in the shandry my
landlord had sent to meet me at the station.</p>

<p>When I say the "station," you are not to picture to yourself
anything like a Euston or a Victoria; but just a modest neat kind of
turnpike-house, with no other dwelling near it; no passengers
crowding for tickets, no pyramids of luggage. I myself was the only
person to alight, and the train whizzed away, leaving me standing and
gazing (rather sadly I must confess) at the last relic of a town I
was to see for a whole week. But the delicious mountain-air blew away
melancholy; and I had not gone many paces before I saw the shandry,
jogging along on its approach to the station. Worthy Mr. Jackson
fancied he had an hour to spare for a chat with his friend at the
station, and a rest for his horse. No wonder! for, when I arrived at
Lorton Grange, I found the clocks differed by two hours from one
another, and each an hour from the real time of day. Does not this
speak volumes as to the way in which life is dreamt away in these
dales?</p>

<p>Good-man Jackson was taciturn enough on the drive--a circumstance
I did not dislike, as it gave me leisure to look about. The road
wound up among brown heathery hills, with scarce a bush to catch a
stray light, or a passing shadow; the few fences there were to be
seen were made of loose stones piled on one another, and cemented
solely by the moss and ferns which filled up every crevice. I do not
intend to worry you by description of scenery, any more than will be
absolutely necessary to give you an idea of my locale; so I shall
only say that, after about an hour's drive over these hills, "fells"
and "knots" as my landlord called them, we dropped down by a most
precipitous road into the valley in which Lorton Grange is
situated.</p>

<p>The dale is about half a mile in breadth, with a brawling,
dashing, brilliant, musical stream dividing it into unequal halves.
At places, the grey rocks hem the noisy, sparkling waters in, and
absolutely encroach upon their territory; again they recede and leave
bays of the greenest of green meadows between rock and river. On one
of these Lorton Grange was erected some three hundred years ago; and
rather a stately place it must have been in those days. It is built
around a hollow square, and must have been roomy enough, when all the
sides were appropriated to the use of the family. Now two are
occupied as farm-buildings, and one is almost in ruins; it has been
gutted to serve as a large barn, and the rain evidently comes in,
every here and there, through the neglected roof. The front of the
quadrangular building is used as the dwelling-place of the farmer's
family. Formerly, a short avenue must have led up to the ivy-covered
porch from the road which is flanked by the afore-mentioned river.
Now, all the trees are felled, except one noble beech, which sweeps
the ground close to the walls of the house, and throws into green
obscurity one charming window-seat in my sitting-room. All over the
front of the house clamber roses, flaunting their branches above the
very eaves; but they seem to grow by sufferance now, and to flower
from summer to summer without imparting pleasure to any one.</p>

<p>You must not suppose that we drove up to the grand entrance; the
old carriage-road has long been ploughed up, and grass now grows
where once the Lortons paced daintily along their avenue. Mr. Jackson
took me to the back-door in the inner square, fluttering two or three
dozen hens and turkeys, and evoking a barking welcome from almost as
many dogs and whelps. I steered my way through the dim confusion of a
large crowded kitchen, having for guide the voice of some female, who
at the end of a dark passage kept calling, "This way, sir; this way;"
and at last I arrived at the room in which I now write--the ancient
hall, I take it.</p>

<p>I could write down an inventory of the furniture and description
of any room in a lodging-house in Manchester; but I think I might
defy you to return the compliment, and form even a guess at the
apartment I am now occupying. Think of four windows, and five doors,
to begin with! Two of my windows look to the front, and are
casements, draperied with ivy; through one the glancing waters of the
stream glint into my room, when the sun shines as it does now; the
other two look into the noisy farm-yard; but on these window-seats
are placed enormous unpruned geraniums and fuchsias, which form an
agreeable blind. As to the doors, two of them are mysteries to me at
this present; one is the back entrance to the room through which
...</p>

<h2><a name="ch8"></a>The Heart of John Middleton</h2>

<p>I was born at Sawley, where the shadow of Pendle Hill falls at
sunrise. I suppose Sawley sprang up into a village in the time of the
monks, who had an abbey there. Many of the cottages are strange old
places; others, again, are built of the abbey stones, mixed up with
the shale from the neighbouring quarries; and you may see many a
quaint bit of carving worked into the walls, or forming the lintels
of the doors. There is a row of houses, built still more recently,
where one Mr Peel came to live there for the sake of the water-power,
and gave the place a fillip into something like life; though a
different kind of life, as I take it, from the grand, slow ways folks
had when the monks were about.</p>

<p>Now it was--six o'clock, ring the bell, throng to the factory;
sharp home at twelve; and even at night, when work was done, we
hardly knew how to walk slowly, we had been so bustled all day long.
I can't recollect the time when I did not go to the factory. My
father used to drag me there when I was quite a little fellow, in
order to wind reels for him. I never remember my mother. I should
have been a better man than I have been, if I had only had a notion
of the sound of her voice, or the look on her face.</p>

<p>My father and I lodged in the house of a man who also worked in
the factory. We were sadly thronged in Sawley, so many people came
from different parts of the country to earn a livelihood at the new
work; and it was some time before the row of cottages I have spoken
of could be built. While they were building, my father was turned out
of his lodgings for drinking and being disorderly, and he and I slept
in the brick-kiln; that is to say, when we did sleep o' nights; hut,
often and often, we went poaching; and many a hare and pheasant have
I rolled up in clay, and roasted in the embers of the kiln. Then, as
followed to reason, I was drowsy next day over my work; but father
had no mercy on me for sleeping, for all he knew the cause of it, but
kicked me where I lay, a heavy lump on the factory floor, and cursed
and swore at me till I got up for very fear, and to my winding again.
But, when his back was turned, I paid him off with heavier curses
than he had given me, and longed to be a man, that I might be
revenged on him. The words I then spoke I would not now dare to
repeat; and worse than hating words, a hating heart went with them. I
forget the time when I did not know how to hate. When I first came to
read, and learnt about Ishmael, I thought I must be of his doomed
race, for my hand was against every man, and every man's against me.
But I was seventeen or more before I cared for my book enough to
learn to read.</p>

<p>After the row of works was finished, lather took one, and set up
for himself, in letting lodgings. I can't say much for the
furnishing; but there was plenty of straw, and we kept up good fires;
and there is a set of people who value warmth above everything. The
worst lot about the place lodged with us. We used to have a supper in
the middle of the night; there was game enough, or if there was not
game, there was poultry to be had for the stealing. By day, we all
made a show of working in the factory. By night, we feasted and
drank.</p>

<p>Now this web of my life was black enough, and coarse enough; but,
by-and-by, a little golden, filmy thread began to be woven in; the
dawn of God's mercy was at hand.</p>

<p>One blowy October morning, as I sauntered lazily along to the
mill, I came to the little wooden bridge over a brook that falls into
the Bribble. On the plank there stood a child, balancing the pitcher
on her head, with which she had been to fetch water. She was so light
on her feet that, had it not been for the weight of the pitcher, I
almost believe the wind would have taken her up, and wafted her away
as it carries off a blow-ball in seed-time; her blue cotton dress was
blown before her, as if she were spreading her wings for a flight;
she turned her face round, as if to ask me for something, but when
she saw who it was, she hesitated, for I had a bad name in the
village, and I doubt not she had been warned against me. But her
heart was too innocent to be distrustful; so she said to me,
timidly,--</p>

<p>'Please, John Middleton, will you carry me this heavy jug just
over the bridge?'</p>

<p>It was the very first time I had ever been spoken to gently. I was
ordered here and there by my father and his rough companions; I was
abused, and cursed by them if I failed in doing what they wished; if
I succeeded, there came no expression of thanks or gratitude. I was
informed of facts necessary for me to know. But the gentle words of
request or entreaty were aforetime unknown to me, and now their tones
fell on my ear soft and sweet as a distant peal of bells. I wished
that I knew how to speak properly in reply; but though we were of the
same standing as regarded worldly circumstances, there was some
mighty difference between us, which made me unable to speak in her
language of soft words and modest entreaty. There was nothing for me
but to take up the pitcher in a kind of gruff, shy silence, and carry
it over the bridge, as she had asked me. When I gave it her back
again, she thanked me and tripped away, leaving me, wordless, gazing
after her like an awkward lout as I was. I knew well enough who she
was. She was grandchild to Eleanor Hadfield, an aged woman, who was
reputed as a witch by my father and his set, for no other reason,
that I can make out, than her scorn, dignity, and fearlessness of
rancour. It was true we often met her in the grey dawn of the
morning, when we returned from poaching, and my father used to curse
her, under his breath, for a witch, such as were burnt long ago on
Pendle Hill top; but I had heard that Eleanor was a skilful sick
nurse, and ever ready to give her services to those who were ill; and
I believe that she had been sitting up through the night (the night
that we had been spending under the wild heavens, in deeds as wild),
with those who were appointed to die. Nelly was her orphan
granddaughter; her little hand-maiden; her treasure; her one ewe
lamb. Many and many a day have I watched by the brook-side, hoping
that some happy gust of wind, coming with opportune bluster down the
hollow of the dale, might make me necessary once more to her. I
longed to hear her speak to me again. I said the words she had used
to myself, trying to catch her tone; but the chance never came again.
I do not know that she ever knew how I watched for her there. I found
out that she went to school, and nothing would serve me but that I
must go too. My father scoffed at me; I did not care. I knew nought
of what reading was, nor that it was likely that I should be laughed
at; I, a great hulking lad of seventeen or upwards, for going to
learn my A, B, C, in the midst of a crowd of little ones. I stood
just this way in my mind. Nelly was at school; it was the best place
for seeing her, and hearing her voice again. Therefore I would go
too. My father talked, and swore, and threatened, but I stood to it.
He said I should leave school, weary of it in a month. I swore a
deeper oath than I like to remember, that I would stay a year, and
come out a reader and a writer. My father hated the notion of folks
learning to read, and said it took all the spirit out of them;
besides, he thought he had a right to every penny of my wages, and
though, when he was in good humour, he might have given me many a jug
of ale, he grudged my twopence a week for schooling. However, to
school I went. It was a different place to what I had thought it
before I went inside. The girls sat on one side, and the boys on the
other; so I was not near Nelly. She, too, was in the first class; I
was put with the little toddling things that could hardly tun alone.
The master sat in the middle, and kept pretty strict watch over us.
But I could see Nelly, and hear her read her chapter; and even when
it was one with a long list of hard names, such as the master was
very fond of giving her, to show how well she could hit them off
without spelling, I thought I had never heard a prettier music. Now
and then she read other things. I did not know what they were, true
or false; but I listened because she read; and, by-and-by, I began to
wonder. I remember the first word I ever spoke to her was to ask her
(as we were coming out of school) who was the Father of whom she had
been reading, for when she said the words 'Our Father,' her voice
dropped into a soft, holy kind of low sound, which struck me more
than any loud reading, it seemed so loving and tender. When I asked
her this, she looked at me with her great blue wondering eyes, at
first shocked; and then, as it were, melted down into pity and
sorrow, she said in the same way, below her breath, in which she read
the words, 'Our Father,'--</p>

<p>'Don't you know? It is God.'</p>

<p>'God?'</p>

<p>'Yes; the God that grandmother tells me about.'</p>

<p>'Tell me what she says, will you?' So we sat down on the
hedge-bank, she a little above me, while I looked up into her face,
and she told me all the holy texts her grandmother had taught her, as
explaining all that could be explained of the Almighty. I listened in
silence, for indeed I was overwhelmed with astonishment. Her
knowledge was principally rote-knowledge; she was too young for much
more; but we, in Lancashire, speak a rough kind of Bible language,
and the texts seemed very clear to me. I rose up, dazed and
overpowered. I was going away in silence, when I bethought me of my
manners, and turned hack, and said, 'Thank you,' for the first time I
ever remember saying it in my life. That was a great day for me, in
more ways than one.</p>

<p>I was always one who could keep very steady to an object when once
I had set it before me. My object was to know Nelly. I was conscious
of nothing more. But it made me regardless of all other things. The
master might scold, the little ones might laugh; I bore it all
without giving it a second thought. I kept to my year, and came out a
reader and writer; more, however, to stand well in Nelly's good
opinion, than because of my oath. About this time, my father
committed some bad, cruel deed, and had to fly the country. I was
glad he went; for I had never loved or cared for him, and wanted to
shake myself clear of his set. But it was no easy matter. Honest folk
stood aloof; only bad men held out their arms to me with a welcome.
Even Nelly seemed to have a mixture of fear now with her kind ways
towards me. I was the son of John Middleton, who, if he were caught,
would be hung at Lancaster Castle. I thought she looked at me
sometimes with a sort of sorrowful horror. Others were not forbearing
enough to keep their expression of feeling confined to looks. The son
of the overlooker at the mill never ceased twitting me with my
father's crime; he now brought up his poaching against him, though I
knew very well how many a good supper he himself had made on game
which had been given him to make him and his lather wink at late
hours in the morning. And how were such as my father to come honestly
by game?</p>

<p>This lad, Dick Jackson, was the bane of my life. He was a year or
two older than I was, and had much power over the men who worked at
the mill, as he could report to his lather what he chose. I could not
always hold my peace when he 'threaped' me with my father's sins, but
gave it him back sometimes in a storm of passion. It did me no good;
only threw me farther from the company of better men, who looked
aghast and shocked at the oaths I poured out--blasphemous words
learnt in my childhood, which I could not forger now that I would
fain have purified myself of them; while all the time Dick Jackson
stood by, with a mocking smile of intelligence; and when I had ended,
breathless and weary with spent passion, he would rum to those whose
respect I longed to earn, and ask if I were not a worthy son of my
lather, and likely to tread in his steps. But this smiling
indifference of his to my miserable vehemence was not all, though it
was the worst part of his conduct, for it made the rankling hatred
grow up in my heart, and overshadow it like the great gourd-tree of
the prophet Jonah. But his was a merciful shade, keeping out the
burning sun; mine blighted what it fell upon.</p>

<p>What Dick Jackson did besides, was this. His father was a skilful
overlooker, and a good man. Mr Peel valued him so much, that he was
kept on, although his health was failing; and when he was unable,
through illness, to come to the mill, he deputed his son to watch
over, and report the men. It was too much power for one so young--I
speak it calmly now. Whatever Dick Jackson became, he had strong
temptations when he was young, which will be allowed for hereafter.
But at the time of which I am telling, my hate raged like a fire. I
believed that he was the one sole obstacle to my being received as
fit to mix with good and honest men. I was sick of crime and
disorder, and would fain have come over to a different kind of life,
and have been industrious, sober, honest, and right-spoken (I had no
idea of higher virtue then), and at every turn Dick Jackson met me
with his sneers. I have walked the night through, in the old abbey
field, planning how I could outwit him, and win men's respect in
spite of him. The first time I ever prayed, was underneath the silent
stars, kneeling by the old abbey walls, throwing up my arms, and
asking God for the power of revenge upon him.</p>

<p>I had heard that if I prayed earnestly, God would give me what I
asked for, and I looked upon it as a kind of chance for the
fulfilment of my wishes. If earnestness would have won the boon for
me, never were wicked words so earnestly spoken. And oh, later on, my
prayer was heard, and my wish granted! All this time I saw little of
Nelly. Her grandmother was failing, and she had much to do in-doors.
Besides, I believed I had read her looks aright, when I took them to
speak of aversion; and I planned to hide myself from her sight, as it
were, until I could stand upright before men, with fearless eyes,
dreading no face of accusation. It was possible to acquire a good
character; I would do it--I did it: but no one brought up among
respectable untempted people can tell the unspeakable hardness of the
task. In the evenings I would not go forth among the village throng;
for the acquaintances that claimed me were my father's old
associates, who would have been glad enough to enlist a strong young
man like me in their projects; and the men who would have shunned me
and kept aloof, were the steady and orderly. So I stayed in-doors,
and practised myself in reading. You will say, I should have found it
easier to earn a good character away from Sawley, at some place where
neither I nor my father was known. So I should; but it would not have
been the same thing to my mind. Besides, representing all good men,
all goodness to me, in Sawley Nelly lived. In her sight I would work
out my life, and fight my way upwards to men's respect. Two years
passed on. Every day I strove fiercely; every day my struggles were
made fruitless by the son of the overlooker; and I seemed but where I
was--but where I must ever be esteemed by all who knew me--but as the
son of the criminal--wild, reckless, ripe for crime myself Where was
the use of my reading and writing? These acquirements were
disregarded and scouted by those among whom I was thrust back to take
my portion. I could have read any chapter in the Bible now; and Nelly
seemed as though she would never know it. I was driven in upon my
books; and few enough of them I had. The pedlars brought them round
in their packs, and I bought what I could. I had the Seven Champions,
and the Pilgrim's Progress, and both seemed to me equally wonderful,
and equally founded on fact. I got Byron's Narrative, and Milton's
Paradise Lost; but I lacked the knowledge which would give a clue to
all. Still they afforded me pleasure, because they took me out of
myself, and made me forget my miserable position, and made me
unconscious (for the time at least) of my one great passion of hatred
against Dick Jackson.</p>

<p>When Nelly was about seventeen her grandmother died. I stood aloof
in the churchyard, behind the great yew-tree, and watched the
funeral. It was the first religious service that ever I heard; and,
to my shame, as I thought, it affected me to tears. The words seemed
so peaceful and holy that I longed to go to church, but I durst not,
because I had never been. The parish church was at Bolton, far enough
away to serve as an excuse for all who did not care to go. I heard
Noel's sobs filling up every pause in the clergyman's voice; and
every sob of hers went to my heart. She passed me on her way out of
the churchyard; she was so near I might have touched her; but her
head was hanging down, and I dourest not speak to her. Then the
question arose, what was to become of her? She must earn her living!
was it to be as a farm-servant, or by working at the mill? I knew
enough of both kinds of life to make me tremble for her. My wages
were such as to enable me to marry, if I chose; and I never thought
of woman, for my wife, but Nelly. Still, I would not have married her
now, if I could; for, as yet, I had not risen up to the character
which I determined it was fit that Nelly's husband should have. When
I was rich in good report, I would come forwards, and take my chance,
but until then I would hold my peace. I had faith in the power of my
long-continued dogged breasting of opinion. Sooner or later it must,
it should, yield, and I be received among the ranks of good men. But,
meanwhile, what was to become of Nelly? I reckoned up my wages; I
went to inquire what the board of a girl would be who should help her
in her household work, and live with her as a daughter, at the house
of one of the most decent women of the place; she looked at me
suspiciously. I kept down my temper, and told her I would never come
near the place; that I would keep away from that end of the village,
and that the girl for whom I made the inquiry should never know but
what the parish paid for her keep. It would not do; she suspected me;
but I know I had power over myself to have kept my word; and besides,
I would not for worlds have had Nelly put under any obligation to me,
which should speck the purity of her love, or dim it by a mixture of
gratitude,--the love that I craved to earn, not for my money, not for
my kindness, but for myself. I heard that Nelly had met with a place
in Bolland; and I could see no reason why I might not speak to her
once before she left our neighbourhood. I meant it to be a quiet
friendly telling her of my sympathy in her sorrow. I felt I could
command myself. So, on the Sunday before she was to leave Sawley, I
waited near the wood-path, by which I knew that she would return from
afternoon church. The birds made such a melodious warble, such a busy
sound among the leaves, that I did not hear approaching footsteps
till they were close at hand; and then there were sounds of two
persons' voices. The wood was near that part of Sawley where Nelly
was staying with friends; the path through it led to their house, and
theirs only, so I knew it must be she, for I had watched her setting
out to church alone.</p>

<p>But who was the other?</p>

<p>The blood went to my heart and head, as if I were shot, when I saw
that it was Dick Jackson. Was this the end of it all? In the steps of
sin which my father had trod, I would rush to my death and my doom.
Even where I stood I longed for a weapon to slay him. How dared he
come near my Nelly? She too.--I thought her faithless, and forgot how
little I had ever been to her in outward action; how few words, and
those how uncouth, I had ever spoken to her; and I hated her for a
traitress. These feelings passed through me before I could see, my
eyes and head were so dizzy and blind. When I looked I saw Dick
Jackson holding her hand, and speaking quick and low and thick, as a
man speaks in great vehemence. She seemed white and dismayed; but all
at once, at some word of his (and what it was she never would tell
me), she looked as though she defied a fiend, and wrenched herself
out of his grasp. He caught hold of her again, and began once more
the thick whisper that I loathed. I could bear it no longer, nor did
I see why I should. I stepped out from behind the tree where I had
been lying. When she saw me, she lost her look of one strung up to
desperation, and came and clung to me; and I felt like a giant in
strength and might. I held her with one arm, but I did not take my
eyes off him; I felt as if they blazed down into his soul, and
scorched him up. He never spoke, but tried to look as though he
defied me. At last, his eyes fell before mine, I dared not speak; for
the old horrid oaths thronged up to my mouth; and I dreaded giving
them way, and terrifying my poor, trembling Nelly.</p>

<p>At last, he made to go past me: I drew her out of the pathway. By
instinct she wrapped her garments round her, as if to avoid his
accidental touch; and he was stung by this, I suppose--I believe--to
the mad, miserable revenge he took. As my back was turned to him, in
an endeavour to speak some words to Nelly that might soothe her into
calmness, she, who was looking after him, like one fascinated with
terror, saw him take a sharp, shaley stone, and aim it at me. Poor
darling! she clung round me as a shield, making her sweet body into a
defence for mine. It hit her, and she spoke no word, kept back her
cry of pain, but fell at my feet in a swoon. He--the coward!--ran off
as soon as he saw what he had done. I was with Nelly alone in the
green gloom of the wood. The quivering and leaf-tinted light made her
look as if she were dead. I carried her, not knowing if I bore a
corpse or not, to her friend's house. I did not stay to explain, but
ran madly for the doctor.</p>

<p>Well! I cannot bear to recur to that time again. Five weeks I
lived in the agony of suspense; from which my only relief was in
laying savage plans for revenge. If I hated him before, what think ye
I did now? It seemed as if earth could not hold us twain, but that
one of us must go down to Gehenna. I could have killed him; and would
have done it without a scruple, but that seemed too poor and bold a
revenge. At length--oh! the weary waiting--oh! the sickening of my
heart--Nelly grew better; as well as she was ever to grow. The bright
colour had left her cheek; the mouth quivered with repressed pain,
the eyes were dim with tears that agony had forced into them; and I
loved her a thousand times better and more than when she was bright
and blooming! What was best of all, I began to perceive that she
cared for me. I know her grandmother's friends warned her against me,
and told her I came of a bad stock; but she had passed the point
where remonstrance from bystanders can take effect--she loved me as I
was, a strange mixture of bad and good, all unworthy of her. We spoke
together now, as those do whose lives are bound up in each other. I
told her I would marry her as Soon as she had recovered her health.
Her friends shook their heads; but they saw she would be unfit for
farm-service or heavy work, and they perhaps thought, as many a one
does, that a bad husband was better than none at all. Anyhow, we were
married; and I learnt to bless God for my happiness, so far beyond my
deserts. I kept her like a lady. I was a skilful workman, and earned
good wages; and every want she had I tried to gratify. Her wishes
were few and simple enough, poor Nelly! If they had been ever so
fanciful, I should have had my reward in the new feeling of the
holiness of home. She could lead me as a little child, with the charm
of her gentle voice, and her ever-kind words. She would plead for all
when I was frill of anger and passion; only Dick Jackson's name
passed never between our lips during all that time. In the evening
she lay back in her beehive chair, and read to me. I think I see her
now, pale and weak, with her sweet, young face, lighted by her holy,
earnest eyes, telling me of the Saviour's life and death, till they
were filled with tears. I longed to have been there, to have avenged
him on the wicked Jews. I liked Peter the best of all the disciples.
But I got the Bible myself, and read the mighty act of God's
vengeance, in the Old Testament, with a kind of triumphant faith
that, sooner or later, He would take my cause in hand, and revenge me
on mine enemy.</p>

<p>In a year or so, Nelly had a baby--a little girl, with eyes just
like Nelly recovered but slowly. It was just before winter, the
cotton-crop had failed, and master had to turn off many hands. I
thought I was sure of being kept on, for I had earned a steady
character, and did my work well; but once again it was permitted that
Dick Jackson should do me wrong. He induced his father to dismiss me
among the first in my branch of the business; and there was I, just
before winter set in, with a wife and new-born child, and a small
enough store of money to keep body and soul together, till I could
get to work again. All my savings had gone by Christmas Eve, and we
sat in the house, foodless for the morrow's festival. Nelly looked
pinched and worn; the baby cried for a larger supply of milk than its
poor, starving mother could give it. My right hand had not forgot its
cunning, and I went out once more to my poaching. I knew where the
gang met; and I knew what a welcome back I should have,--a far warmer
and more hearty welcome than good men had given me when I tried to
enter their ranks. On the road to the meeting-place I fell in with an
old man,--one who had been a companion to my father in his early
days.</p>

<p>'What, lad!' said he, 'art thou turning back to the old trade?
It's the better business, now that cotton has failed.'</p>

<p>'Ay,' said I, 'cotton is starving us outright. A man may bear a
deal himself, but he'll do aught bad and sinful to save his wife and
child.'</p>

<p>'Nay, lad,' said he, 'poaching is not sinful; it goes against
man's laws, but not against God's.'</p>

<p>I was too weak to argue or talk much. I had not tasted food for
two days. But I murmured, 'At any rate, I trusted to have been clear
of it for the rest of my days. It led my father wrong at first. I
have tried and I have striven. Now I give all up. Right or wrong
shall be the same to me. Some are foredoomed; and so am I.' And as I
spoke, some notion of the futurity that would separate Nelly, the
pure and holy, from me, the reckless and desperate one, came over me
with an irrepressible burst of anguish. Just then the bells of
Bolton-in-Bolland struck up a glad peal, which came over the woods,
in the solemn midnight air, like the sons of the morning shouting for
joy--they seemed so clear and jubilant. It was Christmas Day: and I
felt like an outcast from the gladness and the salvation. Old Jonah
spoke out:--</p>

<p>'Yon's the Christmas bells. I say, Johnny, my lad, I've no notion
of taking such a spiritless chap as thou into the thick of it, with
thy rights and thy wrongs. We don't trouble ourselves with such fine
lawyer's stuff, and we bring down the "varmint" all the better. Now,
I'll not have thee in our gang, for thou art not up to the fun, and
thou'd hang fire when the time came to be doing. But I've a shrewd
guess that plaguy wife and child of thine are at the bottom of thy
half-and-half joining. Now, I was thy father's friend afore he took
to them helter-skelter ways, and I've five shillings and a neck of
mutton at thy service. I'll not list a fasting man; but if thou'lt
come to us with a full stomach, and say, "I like your life, my lads,
and I'll make one of you with pleasure, the first shiny night," why,
we'll give you a welcome and a half; but, to-night, make no more ado,
but turn back with me for the mutton and the money.'</p>

<p>I was not proud: nay, I was most thankful. I took the meat, and
boiled some broth for my poor Nelly. She was in a sleep, or a faint,
I know not which; but I roused her, and held her up in bed, and fed
her with a teaspoon, and the light came back to her eyes, and the
faint. moonlight smile to her lips; and when she had ended, she said
her innocent grace, and fell asleep, with her baby on her breast. I
sat over the fire, and listened to the bells, as they swept past my
cottage on the gusts of the wind. I longed and yearned for the second
coming of Christ, of which Nelly had told me. The world seemed cruel,
and hard, and strong--too strong for me; and I prayed to cling to the
hem of His garment, and be borne over the rough places when I
fainted, and bled, and found no man to pity or help me, but poor old
Jonah, the publican and sinner. All this time my own woes and my own
self were uppermost in my mind, as they are in the minds of most who
have been hardly used. As I thought of my wrongs, and my sufferings,
my heart burned against Dick Jackson; and as the bells rose and fell,
so my hopes waxed and waned, that in those mysterious days, of which
they were both the remembrance and the prophecy, he would be purged
from off the earth. I took Nelly's Bible, and turned, not to the
gracious story of the Saviour's birth, but to the records of the
former days, when the Jews took such wild revenge upon all their
opponents. I was a Jew,--a leader among the people. Dick Jackson was
as Pharaoh, as the King Agag, who walked delicately, thinking the
bitterness of death was past,--in short, he was the conquered enemy,
over whom I gloated, with my Bible in my hand--that Bible which
contained our Saviour's words on the Cross. As yet, those words
seemed faint and meaningless to me, like a tract of country seen in
the starlight haze; while the histories of the Old Testament were
grand and distinct in the blood-red colour of sunset. By-and-by that
night passed into day, and little piping voices came round,
carol-singing. They wakened Nelly. I went to her as soon as I heard
her stirring.</p>

<p>'Nelly,' said I, 'there's money and food in the house; I will be
off to Padiham seeking work, while thou hast something to go
upon.</p>

<p>'Not to-day,' said she; 'stay to-day with me. If thou wouldst only
go to church with me this once'--for you see I had never been inside
a church but when we were married, and she was often praying me to
go; and now she looked at me, with a sigh just creeping forth from
her lips, as she expected a refusal. But I did not refuse. I had been
kept away from church before because I dared not go; and now I was
desperate, and dared do anything. If I did look like a heathen in the
face of all men, why, I was a heathen in my heart; for I was falling
back into all my evil ways. I had resolved if my search of work at
Padiham should fail, I would follow my father's footsteps, and take
with my own right hand and by my strength of arm what it was denied
me to obtain honestly. I had resolved to leave Sawley, where a curse
seemed to hang over me; so, what did it matter if I went to church,
all unbeknowing what strange ceremonies were there performed? I
walked thither as a sinful man--sinful in my heart. Nelly hung on my
arm, but even she could not get me to speak. I went in; she found my
places, and pointed to the words, and looked up into my eyes with
hers, so frill of faith and joy. But I saw nothing but Richard
Jackson--I heard nothing but his loud nasal voice, making response,
and desecrating all the holy words. He was in broadcloth of the
best--I in my fustian jacket. He was prosperous and glad--I was
starving and desperate. Nelly grew pale, as she saw the expression in
my eyes; and she prayed ever, and ever more fervently as the thought
of me tempted by the Devil even at that very moment came more fully
before her.</p>

<p>By-and-by she forgot even me, and laid her soul bare before God,
in a long, silent, weeping prayer, before we left the church. Nearly
all had gone; and I stood by her, unwilling to disturb her, unable to
join her. At last she rose up, heavenly calm. She took my arm, and we
went home through the woods, where all the birds seemed tame and
familiar. Nelly said she thought all living creatures knew it was
Christmas Day, and rejoiced, and were loving together. I believed it
was the frost that had tamed them; and I felt the hatred that was in
me, and knew that whatever else was loving, I was full of malice and
uncharitableness, nor did I wish to be otherwise. That afternoon I
bade Nelly and our child farewell, and tramped to Padiham. I got
work--how I hardly know; for stronger and stronger came the force of
the temptation to lead a wild, free life of sin; legions seemed
whispering evil thoughts to me, and only my gentle, pleading Newly to
pull me back from the great gulf. However, as I said before, I got
work, and set off homewards to move my wife and child to that
neighbourhood. I hated Sawley, and yet I was fiercely indignant to
leave it, with my purposes unaccomplished. I was still an outcast
from the more respectable, who stood afar off from such as I; and
mine enemy lived and flourished in their regard. Padiham, however,
was not so far away for me to despair--to relinquish my fixed
determination. It was on the eastern side of the great Pendle Hill,
ten miles away--maybe. Hate will overleap a greater obstacle. I took
a cottage on the Fell, high up on the side of the hill. We saw a long
black moorland slope before us, and then the grey stone houses of
Padiham, over which a black cloud hung, different from the blue wood
or turf smoke about Sawley. The wild winds came down and whistled
round our house many a day when all was still below. But I was happy
then. I rose in men's esteem. I had work in plenty. Our child lived
and throve. But I forgot not our country proverb--'Keep a stone in
thy pocket for seven years: turn it, and keep it seven years more;
but have it ever ready to cast at thine enemy when the time
comes.'</p>

<p>One day a fellow-workman asked me to go to a hill-side preaching.
Now, I never cared to go to church; but there was something newer and
freer in the notion of praying to God right under His great dome; and
the open air had had a charm to me ever since my wild boyhood.
Besides, they said, these ranters had strange ways with them, and I
thought it would be fun to see their way of setting about it; and
this ranter of all others had made himself a name in our parts.
Accordingly we went; it was a fine summer's evening, after work was
done. When we got to the place we saw such a crowd as I never saw
before--men, women, and children; all ages were gathered together,
and sat on the hill-side. They were care-worn, diseased, sorrowful,
criminal'. all that was told on their faces, which were hard and
strongly marked. In the midst, standing in a cart, was the ranger.
When I first saw him, I said to my companion, 'Lord! what a little
man to make all this pother! I could trio him up with one of my
fingers,' and then I sat down, and looked about me a bit. All eves
were fixed on the preacher; and I turned mine upon him too. He began
to speak; it was in no fine-drawn language, but in words such as we
heard every day of our lives, and about things we did every day of
our lives. He did nor call our shortcomings pride or worldliness, or
pleasure-seeking, which would have given us no clear notion of what
he meant, but he just told us outright what we did, and then he gave
it a name, and said that it was accursed, and that we were lost if we
went on so doing.</p>

<p>By this time the tears and sweat were running down his face; he
was wrestling for our souls. We wondered how he knew our innermost
lives as he did, for each one of us saw his sin set before him in
plain-spoken words. Then he cried out to us to repent; and spoke
first to us, and then to God, in a way that would have shocked
many--but it did not shock me. I liked strong things; and I liked the
bare, hill truth: and I felt brought nearer to God in that hour--the
summer darkness creeping over us, and one after one the stars coming
out above us, like the eyes of the angels watching us--than I had
ever done in my life before. When he had brought us to our tears and
sighs, he stopped his loud voice of upbraiding, and there was a hush,
only broken by sobs and quivering moans, in which I heard through the
gloom the voices of strong men in anguish and supplication, as well
as the shriller tones or women. Suddenly he was heard again; by this
time we could not see him; but his voice was now tender as the voice
of an angel, and he told us of Christ, and implored us to come to
Him. I never heard such passionate entreaty. He spoke as if he saw
Satan hovering near us in the dark, dense night, and as if our only
safety lay in a very present coming to the Cross; I believe he did
see Satan; we know he haunts the desolate old hills, awaiting his
time, and now or never it was with many a soul. At length there was a
sudden silence; and by the cries of those nearest to the preacher, we
heard that he had fainted. We had all crowded round him, as if he
were our safety and our guide; and he was overcome by the heat and
the fatigue, for we were the fifth set of people whom he had
addressed that day. I left the crowd who were leading him down, and
took a lonely path myself.</p>

<p>Here was the earnestness I needed. To this weak and weary fainting
man, religion was a life and a passion. I look back now, and wonder
at my blindness as to what was the took of all my Noel's patience and
long-suffering; for I thought, now I had found out what religion was,
and that hitherto it had been all an unknown thing to me.</p>

<p>Henceforward, my life was changed. I was zealous and fanatical.
Beyond the set to whom I had affiliated myself, I had no sympathy. I
would have persecuted all who differed from me, if I had only had the
power. I became an ascetic in all bodily enjoyments. And, strange and
inexplicable mystery, I had some thoughts that by every act of
self-denial I was attaining to my unholy end, and that, when I had
fasted and prayed long enough, God would place my vengeance in my
hands. I have knelt by Nelly's bedside, and vowed to live a
self-denying life, as regarded all outward things, if so that God
would grant my prayer. I left it in His hands. I felt sure He would
trace out the token and the word; and Nelly would listen to my
passionate words, and lie awake sorrowful and heart-sore through the
night; and I would get up and make her tea, and rearrange her
pillows, with a strange and willful blindness that my bitter words
and blasphemous prayers had cost her miserable, sleepless nights. My
Nelly was suffering yet from that blow. How or where the stone had
hurt her, I never understood; but in consequence of that one moment's
action, her limbs became numb and dead, and, by slow degrees, she
took to her bed, from whence she was never carried alive. There she
lay, propped up by pillows, her meek face ever bright, and smiling
forth a greeting; her white, pale hands ever busy with some kind of
work; and our little Grace was as the power of motion to her. Fierce
as I was away from her, I never could speak to her but in my gentlest
tones. She seemed to me as if she had never wrestled for salvation as
I had; and when away from her, I resolved many a time and oft, that I
would rouse her up to her state of danger when I returned home that
evening--even if strong reproach were required I would rouse her up
to her soul's need. But I came in and heard her voice singing softly
some holy word of patience, some psalm which, maybe, had comforted
the martyrs, and when I saw her face like the face of an angel, full
of patience and happy faith, I put off my awakening speeches nil
another time.</p>

<p>One night, long ago, when I was yet young and strong, although my
years were past forty, I sat alone in my houseplace. Nelly was always
in bed, as I have told you, and Grace lay in a cot by her side. I
believed them to be both asleep; though how they could sleep I could
not conceive, so wild and terrible was the night. The wind came
sweeping down from the hill-top in great beats, like the pulses of
heaven; and, during the pauses, while I listened for the coming roar,
I felt the earth shiver beneath me. The rain heat against windows and
doors, and sobbed for entrance. I thought the Prince of the Air was
abroad; and I heard, or fancied I heard, shrieks come on the blast.
like the cries of sinful souls given over to his power.</p>

<p>The sounds came nearer and neater. I got up and saw to the
fastenings of the door, for though I cared not for mortal man, I did
care for what I believed was surrounding the house, in evil might and
power. But the door shook as though it, too, were in deadly terror,
and I thought the fastenings would give way. I stood facing the
entrance, lashing my heart up to defy the spiritual enemy that I
looked to see, every instant, in bodily presence; and the door did
burst open; and before me stood--what was it? man or demon? a
grey-haired man, with poor, worn clothes all wringing wet, and he
himself battered and piteous to look upon, from the storm he had
passed through.</p>

<p>'Let me in!' he said. 'Give me shelter. I am poor, or I would
reward you. And I am friendless, too,' he said, looking up in my
face, like one seeking what he cannot find. In that look, strangely
changed, I knew that God had heard me; for it was the old cowardly
look of my life's enemy. Had he been a stranger, I might not have
welcomed him; but as he was mine enemy, I gave him welcome in a
lordly dish. I sat opposite to him. 'Whence do you come?' said I. 'It
is a strange night to be out on the fells.'</p>

<p>He looked up at me sharp; but in general he held his head down
like a beast or hound.</p>

<p>You won't betray me. I'll not trouble you long. As soon as the
storm abates, I'll go.'</p>

<p>'Friend!' said I, 'what have I to betray?' and I trembled lest he
should keep himself out of my power and not tell me. 'You come for
shelter, and I give you of my best. Why do you suspect me?'</p>

<p>'Because,' said he, in his abject bitterness, all the world is
against me. I never met with goodness or kindness; and now I am
hunted like a wild beast. I'll tell you--I'm a convict returned
before my time. I was a Sway man' (as if I, of all men, did nor know
it!), 'and I went back, like a fool, to the old place. They've hunted
me out where I would fain have lived rightly and quietly, and they'll
send me back to that hell upon earth, if they catch me. I did nor
know it would be such a night. Only let me rest and get warm once
more, and I'll go away. Good, kind man, have pity upon me!' I smiled
all his doubts away; I promised him a bed on the floor, and I thought
of Jael and Sisera. My heart leaped up like a war-horse at the sound
of the trumpet, and said, 'Ha, ha, the Lord hath heard my prayer and
supplication; I shall have vengeance at last!'</p>

<p>He did not dream who I was. He was changed; so that I, who had
learned his features with all the diligence of hatred, did not, at
first, recognize him; and he thought not of me, only of his own woe
and affright. He looked into the fire with the dreamy gaze of one
whose strength of character, if he had any, is beaten out of him, and
cannot return at any emergency whatsoever. He sighed and pitied
himself, yet could not decide on what to do. I went softly about my
business, which was to make him up a bed on the floor, and, when he
was lulled to sleep and security, to make the best of my way to
Padiham, and summon the constable, into whose hands I would give him
up, to be taken back to his 'hell upon earth.' I went into Nelly's
room. She was awake and anxious. I saw she had been listening to the
voices.</p>

<p>'Who is there?' said she. 'John, tell me; it sounded like a voice
I knew. For God's sake, speak!'</p>

<p>I smiled a quiet smile. It is a poor man, who has lost his way. Go
to sleep, my dear--I shall make him up on the floor. I may not come
for some time. Go to sleep;' and I kissed her. I thought she was
soothed, but nor fully satisfied. However, I hastened away before
there was any further time for questioning. I made up the bed, and
Richard Jackson, tired out, lay down and fell asleep. My contempt for
him almost equalled my hate. If I were avoiding return to a place
which I thought to be a hell upon earth, think you I would have taken
a quiet sleep under any man's roof till, somehow or another, I was
secure. Now comes this man, and, with incontinence of tongue, blabs
out the very thing he most should conceal, and then lies down to a
good, quiet, snoring sleep. I looked again. His face was old, and
worn, and miserable. So should mine enemy look. And yet it was sad to
gaze upon him, poor, hunted creature!</p>

<p>I would gaze no more, lest I grew weak and pitiful. Thus I took my
hat, and softly opened the door. The wind blew in, but did not
disturb him, he was so utterly weary. I was our in the open air of
night. The storm was ceasing, and, instead of the black sky of doom
that I had seen when I last looked forth, the moon was come out, wan
and pale, as if wearied with the fight in the heavens, and her white
light fell ghostly and calm on many a well-known object. Now and
then, a dark, torn cloud was blown across her home in the sky; but
they grew fewer and fewer, and at last she shone out steady and
clear. I could see Padiham down before me. I heard the noise of the
watercourses down the hill-side. My mind was hill of one thought, and
strained upon that one thought, and yet my senses were most acute and
observant. When I came to the brook, it was swollen to a rapid,
tossing river; and the little bridge, with its hand-rail, was utterly
swept away. It was like the bridge at Sway, where I had first seen
Newly; and I remembered that day even then in the midst of my
vexation at having to go round. I turned away from the brook, and
there stood a little figure facing me. No spirit from the dead could
have affrighted me as it did; for I saw it was Grace, whom I had left
in bed by her mother's side.</p>

<p>She came to me, and took my hand. Her bare feet glittered white in
the moonshine, and sprinkled the light upwards, as they plashed
through the pool.</p>

<p>'Father,' said she, 'mother bade me say this.' Then pausing to
gather breath and memory, she repeated these words, like a lesson of
which she feared to forget a syllable:--</p>

<p>'Mother says, "There is a God in heaven; and in His house are many
mansions. If you hope to meet her there, you will come back and speak
to her; if you are to be separate for ever and ever, you will go on,
and may God have mercy on her and on you!" Father, I have said it
right--every word.' I was silent. At last, I said,--</p>

<p>'What made mother say this? How came she to send you out?'</p>

<p>'I was asleep, father, and I heard her cry. I wakened up, and I
think you had but just left the house, and that she was calling for
you. Then she prayed, with the tears rolling down her cheeks, and
kept saying--"Oh, that I could walk!--oh, that for one hour I could
run and walk!" So I said, "Mother, I can run and walk. Where must I
go?" And she clutched at my arm, and bade God bless me, and told me
not to fear, for that He would compass me about, and taught me my
message: and now, father, dear father, you will meet mother in
heaven, won't you, and not be separate for ever and ever?' She clung
to my knees, and pleaded once more in her mother's words. I took her
up in my arms, and turned homewards.</p>

<p>'Is yon man there, on the kitchen floor?' asked I.</p>

<p>'Yes!' she answered. At any rate, my vengeance was not out of my
power yet.</p>

<p>When we got home I passed him, dead asleep.</p>

<p>In our room, to which my child guided me, was Nelly. She sat up in
bed, a most unusual attitude for her, and one of which I thought she
had been incapable of attaining to without help. She had her hands
clasped, and her face rapt, as if in prayer; and when she saw me, she
lay back with a sweet ineffable smile. She could not speak at first;
but when I came near, she took my hand and kissed it, and then she
called Grace to her, and made her take off her cloak and her wet
things, and dressed in her short scanty nightgown, she slipped in to
her mother's warm side; and all this time my Nelly never told me why
she summoned me: it seemed enough that she should hold my hand, and
feel that I was there. I believed she had read my heart; and yet I
durst not speak to ask her. At last, she looked up. 'My husband,'
said she, 'God has saved you and me from a great sorrow this night.'
I would not understand, and I felt her look die away into
disappointment.</p>

<p>'That poor wanderer in the house-place is Richard Jackson, is it
not?'</p>

<p>I made no answer. Her face grew white and wan. 'Oh,' said she,
'this is hard to bear. Speak what is in your mind, I beg of you. I
will not thwart you harshly; dearest John, only speak to me.'</p>

<p>'Why need I speak? You seem to know all.'</p>

<p>'I do know that his is a voice I can never forget; and I do know
the awful prayers you have prayed; and I know how I have lain awake,
to pray that your words might never be heard; and I am a powerless
cripple. I put my cause in God's hands. You shall not do the man any
harm. What you have it in your thoughts to do, I cannot tell. But I
know that you cannot do it. My eyes are dim with a strange mist; but
some voice tells me that you will forgive even Richard Jackson. Dear
husband--dearest John, it is so dark, I cannot see you: but speak
once to me.</p>

<p>I moved the candle; but when I saw her face, I saw what was
drawing the mist over those loving eyes--how strange and woeful that
she could die! Her little girl lying by her side looked in my face,
and then at her; and the wild knowledge of death shot through her
young heart, and she screamed aloud.</p>

<p>Nelly opened her eyes once more. They fell upon the gaunt,
sorrow-worn man who was the cause of all. He roused him from his
sleep, at that child's piercing cry, and stood at the doorway,
looking in. He knew Nelly, and understood where the storm had driven
him to shelter. He came towards her--</p>

<p>'Oh, woman--dying woman--you have haunted me in the loneliness of
the Bush far away--you have been in my dreams for ever--the hunting
of men has not been so terrible as the hunting of your spirit,--that
stone--that stone!' He fell down by her bedside in an agony; above
which her saint-like face looked on us all, for the last time,
glorious with the coming light of heaven. She spoke once again:--</p>

<p>'It was a moment of passion; I never bore you malice for it. I
forgive you; and so does John, I trust.'</p>

<p>Could I keep my purpose there? It faded into nothing. But, above
my choking tears, I strove to speak clear and distinct, for her dying
ear to hear, and her sinking heart to be gladdened.</p>

<p>'I forgive you, Richard; I will befriend you in your trouble.'</p>

<p>She could not see; but, instead of the dim shadow of death
stealing over her face, a quiet light came over it, which we knew was
the look of a soul at rest.</p>

<p>That night I listened to his tale for her sake; and I learned that
it is better to be sinned against than to sin. In the storm of the
night mine enemy came to me; in the calm of the grey morning I led
him forth, and bade him 'God speed.' And a woe had come upon me, but
the burning burden of a sinful, angry heart was taken off. I am old
now, and my daughter is married. I try to go about preaching and
teaching in my rough, rude way; and what I teach is, how Christ lived
and died, and what was Nelly's faith of love.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9"></a>Morton Hall</h2>

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<p>Our old Hall is to be pulled down, and they are going to build
streets on the site. I said to my sister, 'Ethelinda! if they really
pull down Morton Hall, it will be a worse piece of work than the
Repeal of the Corn Laws.' And, after some consideration, she replied,
that if she must speak what was on her mind, she would own that she
thought the Papists had something to do with it; that they had never
forgiven the Morton who had been with Lord Monteagle when he
discovered the Gunpowder Plot; for we knew that, somewhere in Rome,
there was a book kept, and which had been kept for generations,
giving an account of the secret private history of every English
family of note, and registering the names of those to whom the
Papists owed either grudges or gratitude.</p>

<p>We were silent for some time; but I am sure the same thought was
in both our minds; our ancestor, a Sidebotham, had been a follower of
the Morton of that day; it had always been said in the family that he
had been with his master when he went with the Lord Monteagle, and
found Guy Fawkes and his dark lantern under the Parliament House; and
the question flashed across our minds, were the Sidebothams marked
with a black mark in that terrible mysterious book which was kept
under lock and key by the Pope and the Cardinals in Rome? It was
terrible, yet, somehow, rather pleasant to think of. So many of the
misfortunes which had happened to us through life, and which we had
called 'mysterious dispensations,' but which some of our neighbours
had attributed to our want of prudence and foresight, were accounted
for at once, if we were objects of the deadly hatred of such a
powerful order as the Jesuits, of whom we had lived in dread ever
since we had read the Female Jesuit. Whether this last idea suggested
what my sister said next I can't tell; we did know the female
Jesuit's second cousin, so might be said to have literary
connections, and from that the startling thought might spring up in
my sister's mind, for, said she, 'Biddy!' (my name is Bridget, and no
one but my sister calls me Biddy) 'suppose you write some account of
Morton Hall; we have known much in our time of the Mortons, and it
will be a shame if they pass away completely from men's memories
while we can speak or write.' I was pleased with the notion, I
confess; but I felt ashamed to agree to it ill at once, though even,
as I objected for modesty's sake, it came into my mind how much I had
heard of the old place in its former days, and how it was, perhaps,
all I could now do for the Mortons, under whom our ancestors had
lived as tenants for more than three hundred years. So at last I
agreed; and, for fear of mistakes, I showed it to Mr Swinton, our
young curate, who has put it quite in order for me.</p>

<p>Morton Hall is situated about five miles from the centre of
Drumble. It stands on the outskirts of a village, which, when the
Hall was built, was probably as large as Drumble in those days; and
even I can remember when there was a long piece of rather lonely
road, with high hedges on either side, between Morton village and
Drumble. Now, it is all street, and Morton seems but a suburb of the
great town near. Our farm stood where Liverpool Street runs now; and
people used to come snipe-shooting just where the Baptist chapel is
built. Our farm must have been older than the Hall, for we had a date
of 1460 on one of the cross-beams. My father was rather proud of this
advantage, for the Hall had no date older than 1554; and I remember
his affronting Mrs Dawson, the house-keeper, by dwelling too much on
this circumstance one evening when she came to drink tea with my
mother, when Ethelinda and I were mere children. But my mother,
seeing that Mrs Dawson would never allow that any house in the parish
could be older than the Hall, and that she was getting very warm, and
almost insinuating that the Sidebothams had forged the date to
disparage the squire's family, and set themselves up as having the
older blood, asked Mrs Dawson to tell us the story of old Sir John
Morton before we went to bed. I slily reminded my father that jack,
our man, was not always so careful as might be in housing the
Alderney in good time in the autumn evenings. So he started up, and
went off to see after jack; and Mrs Dawson and we drew nearer the
fire to hear the story about Sir John.</p>

<p>Sir John Morton had lived some time about the Restoration. The
Mortons had taken the right side; so when Oliver Cromwell came into
power, he gave away their lands to one of his Puritan followers--a
man who had been but a praying, canting, Scotch pedlar till the war
broke out; and Sir John had to go and live with his royal master at
Bruges. The upstart's name was Carr, who came to live at Morton Hall;
and, I'm proud to say, we--I mean our ancestors--led him a pretty
life. He had hard work to get any rent at all from the tenantry, who
knew their duty better than to pay it to a Roundhead. If he took the
law to them, the law officers fared so badly, that they were shy of
coming out to Morton--all along that lonely road I told you
of--again. Strange noises were heard about the Hall, which got the
credit of being haunted; but, as those noises were never heard before
or since that Richard Carr lived there, I leave you to guess if the
evil spirits did not know well over whom they had power--over
schismatic rebels, and no one else. They durst not trouble the
Mortons, who were true and loyal, and were faithful followers of King
Charles in word and deed. At last, Old Oliver died; and folks did say
that, on that wild and stormy night, his voice was heard high up in
the air, where you hear the flocks of wild geese skirl, crying out
for his true follower Richard Carr to accompany him in the terrible
chase the fiends were giving him before carrying him down to hell.
Anyway, Richard Carr died within a week--summoned by the dead or not,
he went his way down to his master, and his master's master.</p>

<p>Then his daughter Alice came into possession. Her mother was
somehow related to General Monk, who was beginning to come into power
about that time. So when Charles the Second came back to his throne,
and many of the sneaking Puritans had to quit their ill-gotten land,
and turn to the right about, Alice Carr was still left at Morton Hall
to queen it there. She was taller than most women, and a great
beauty, I have heard. But, for all her beauty, she was a stern, hard
woman. The tenants had known her to be hard in her father's lifetime,
but now that she was the owner, and had the power, she was worse than
ever. She hated the Stuarts worse than ever her father bad done; had
calves' head for dinner every thirtieth of January; and when the
first twenty-ninth of May came round, and every mother's son in the
village gilded his oak-leaves, and wore them in his hat, she closed
the windows of the great hall with her own hands, and sat throughout
the day in darkness and mourning. People did not like to go against
her by force, because she was a young and beautiful woman. It was
said the King got her cousin, the Duke of Albemarle, to ask her to
court, just as courteously as if she had been the Queen of Sheba, and
King Charles, Solomon, praying her to visit him in Jerusalem. But she
would not go; not she! She lived a very lonely life, for now the King
had got his own again, no servant but her nurse would stay with her
in the Hall; and none of the tenants would pay her any money for all
that her father had purchased the lands from the Parliament, and paid
the price down in good red gold.</p>

<p>All this time, Sir John was somewhere in the Virginian
plantations; and the ships sailed from thence only twice a year: but
his royal master had sent for him home; and home he came, that second
summer after the restoration. No one knew if Mistress Alice had heard
of his landing in England or not; all the villagers and tenantry
knew, and were not surprised, and turned out in their best dresses,
and with great branches of oak, to welcome him as he rode into the
village one July morning, with many gay-looking gentlemen by his
side, laughing, and talking, and making merry, and speaking gaily and
pleasantly to the village people. They came in on the opposite side
to the Drumble Road; indeed Drumble was nothing of a place then, as I
have told you. Between the last cottage in the village and the gates
to the old Hall, there was a shady part of the road, where the
branches nearly met overhead, and made a green gloom. If you'll
notice, when many people are talking merrily out of doors in
sunlight, they will stop talking for an instant, when they come into
the cool green shade, and either be silent for some little time, or
else speak graver, and slower, and softer. And so old people say
those gay gentlemen did; for several people followed to see Alice
Carr's pride taken down. They used to tell how the cavaliers had to
how their plumed hats in passing under the unlopped and drooping
boughs. I fancy Sir John expected that the lady would have rallied
her friends, and got ready for a sort of battle to defend the
entrance to the house; but she had no friends. She had no nearer
relations than the Duke of Albemarle, and he was mad with her for
having refused to come to court, and so save her estate, according to
his advice.</p>

<p>Well, Sir John rode on in silence; the tramp of the many horses'
feet, and the clumping sound of the clogs of the village people were
all that was heard. Heavy as the great gate was, they swung it wide
on its hinges, and up they rode to the Hall steps, where the lady
stood, in her close, plain, Puritan dress, her cheeks one crimson
flush, her great eyes flashing fire, and no one behind her, or with
her, or near her, or to be seen, but the old trembling nurse,
catching at her gown in pleading terror. Sir John was taken aback; he
could not go out with swords and warlike weapons against a woman; his
very preparations for forcing an entrance made him ridiculous in his
own eyes, and, he well knew, in the eyes of his gay, scornful
comrades too; so he turned him round about, and bade them stay where
they were, while he rode close to the steps, and spoke to the young
lady; and there they saw him, hat in hand, speaking to her; and she,
lofty and unmoved, holding her own as if she had been a sovereign
queen with an army at her back. What they said, no one heard; but he
rode back, very grave and much changed in his look, though his grey
eye showed more hawk-like than ever, as if seeing the way to his end,
though as yet afar off. He was not one to be jested with before his
face; so when he professed to have changed his mind, and not to wish
to disturb so fair a lady in possession, he and his cavaliers rode
back to the village inn, and roystered there all day, and feasted the
tenantry, cutting down the branches that had incommoded them in their
morning's ride, to make a bonfire of on the village green, in which
they burnt a figure, which some called Old Noll, and others Richard
Carr: and it might do for either, folks said, for unless they had
given it the name of a man, most people would have taken it for a
forked log of wood. But the lady's nurse told the villagers
afterwards that Mistress Alice went in from the sunny Hall steps into
the chill house shadow, and sat her down and wept as her poor
faithful servant had never seen her do before, and could not have
imagined her proud young lady ever doing. All through that summer's
day she cried; and if for very weariness she ceased for a time, and
only sighed as if her heart was breaking, they heard through the
upper windows--which were open because of the heat--the village bells
ringing merrily through the trees, and bursts of choruses to gay
cavalier songs, all in favour of the Stuarts. All the young lady said
was once or twice, 'Oh God! I am very friendless!'--and the old nurse
knew it was true, and could not contradict her; and always thought,
as she said long after, that such weary weeping showed there was some
great sorrow at hand.</p>

<p>I suppose it was the dreariest sorrow that ever a proud woman had;
but it came in the shape of a gay wedding. How, the village never
knew. The gay gentlemen rode away from Morton the next day as lightly
and carelessly as if they had attained their end, and Sir John had
taken possession; and, by-and-by, the nurse came timorously out to
market in the village, and Mistress Alice was met in the wood walks
just as grand and as proud as ever in her ways, only a little more
pale, and a little more sad. The truth was, as I have been told, that
she and Sir John had each taken a fancy to each other in that parley
they held on the Hall steps; she, in the deep, wild way in which she
took the impressions of her whole life, deep down, as if they were
burnt in. Sir John was a gallant-looking man, and had a kind of
foreign grace and courtliness about him. The way he fancied her was
very different--a man's way, they tell me. She was a beautiful woman
to be tamed, and made to come to his beck and call; and perhaps he
read in her softening eyes that she might be won, and so all legal
troubles about the possession of the estate come to an end in an
easy, pleasant manner. He came to stay with friends in the
neighbourhood; he was met in her favourite walks, with his plumed hat
in his hand, pleading with her, and she looking softer and far more
lovely than ever; and lastly, the tenants were told of the marriage
then nigh at hand.</p>

<p>After they were wedded, he stayed for a time with her at the Hall,
and then off back to court. They do say that her obstinate refusal to
go with him to London was the cause of their first quarrel; but such
fierce, strong wills would quarrel the first day of their wedded
life. She said that the court was no place for an honest woman; but
surely Sir John knew best, and she might have trusted him to take
care of her. However, he left her all alone; and at first she cried
most bitterly, and then she took to her old pride, and was more
haughty and gloomy than ever. By-and-by she found out hidden
conventicles; and, as Sir John never stinted her of money, she
gathered the remnants of the old Puritan party about her, and tried
to comfort herself with long prayers, snuffled through the nose, for
the absence of her husband, but it was of no use. Treat her as he
would, she loved him still with a terrible love. Once, they say, she
put on her waiting-maid's dress, and stole up to London to find out
what kept him there; and something she saw or heard that changed her
altogether, for she came back as if her heart was broken. They say
that the only person she loved with all the wild strength of her
heart, had proved false to her; and if so, what wonder! At the best
of times she was but a gloomy creature, and it was a great honour for
her father's daughter to be wedded to a Morton. She should not have
expected too much.</p>

<p>After her despondency came her religion. Every old Puritan
preacher in the country was welcome at Morton Hall. Surely that was
enough to disgust Sir John. The Mortons had never cared to have much
religion, but what they had, had been good of its kind hitherto. So,
when Sir John came down wanting a gay greeting and a tender show of
love, his lady exhorted him, and prayed over him, and quoted the last
Puritan text she had heard at him; and he swore at her, and at her
preachers; and made a deadly oath that none of them should find
harbour or welcome in any house of his. She looked scornfully back at
him, and said she had yet to learn in what county of England the
house he spoke of was to be found; but in the house her father
purchased, and she inherited, all who preached the Gospel should be
welcome, let kings make what laws, and kings' minions swear what
oaths they would. He said nothing to this--the worst sign for her;
but he set his teeth at her; and in an hour's time he rode away back
to the French witch that had beguiled him.</p>

<p>Before he went away from Morton he set his spies. He longed to
catch his wife in his fierce clutch, and punish her for defying him.
She had made him hate her with her Puritanical ways. He counted the
days till the messenger came, splashed up to the top of his deep
leather boots, to say that my lady had invited the canting Puritan
preachers of the neighbourhood to a prayer-meeting, and a dinner, and
a night's rest at her house. Sir John smiled as he gave the messenger
five gold pieces for his pains; and straight took post-horses, and
rode long days till he got to Morton; and only just in time; for it
was the very day of the prayer-meeting. Dinners were then at one
o'clock in the country. The great people in London might keep late
hours, and dine at three in the afternoon or so; but the Mortons they
always clung to the good old ways, and as the church bells were
ringing twelve when Sir John came riding into the village, he knew he
might slacken bridle; and, casting one glance at the smoke which came
hurrying up as if from a newly-mended fire, just behind the wood,
where he knew the Hall kitchen chimney stood, Sir John stopped at the
smithy, and pretended to question the smith about his horse's shoes;
but he took little heed of the answers, being more occupied by an old
serving-man from the Hall, who had been loitering about the smithy
half the morning, as folk thought afterwards to keep some appointment
with Sir John. When their talk was ended, Sir John lifted himself
straight in his saddle; cleared his throat, and spoke out
aloud:--</p>

<p>'I grieve to hear your lady is so ill.' The smith wondered at
this, for all the village knew of the coming feast at the Hall; the
spring-chickens had been bought up, and the cade-lambs killed; for
the preachers in those days, if they fasted they fasted, if they
fought they fought, if they prayed they prayed, sometimes for three
hours at a standing; and if they feasted they feasted, and knew what
good eating was, believe me.</p>

<p>'My lady ill?' said the smith, as if he doubted the old prim
serving-man's word. And the latter would have chopped in with an
angry asseveration (he had been at Worcester and fought on the right
side), but Sir John cut him short.</p>

<p>'My lady is very ill, good Master Fox. It touches her here,'
continued he, pointing to his head. 'I am come down to take her to
London, where the King's own physician shall prescribe for her.' And
he rode slowly up to the hall.</p>

<p>The lady was as well as ever she had been in her life, and happier
than she had often been; for in a few minutes some of those whom she
esteemed so highly would be about her, some of those who had known
and valued her father--her dead father, to whom her sorrowful heart
turned in its woe, as the only true lover and friend she had ever had
on earth. Many of the preachers would have ridden far,--was all in
order in their rooms, and on the table in the great dining parlour?
She had got into restless hurried ways of late. She went round below,
and then she mounted the great oak staircase to see if the tower
bed-chamber was all in order for old Master Hilton, the oldest among
the preachers. Meanwhile, the maidens below were carrying in mighty
cold rounds of spiced beef, quarters of lamb, chicken pies, and all
such provisions, when, suddenly, they knew not how, they found
themselves each seized by strong arms, their aprons thrown over their
heads, after the manner of a gag, and themselves borne out of the
house on to the poultry green behind, where, with threats of what
worse might befall them, they were sent with many a shameful word
(Sir John could not always command his men, many of whom had been
soldiers in the French wars) back into the village. They scudded away
like frightened hares. My lady was strewing the white-headed
preacher's room with the last year's lavender, and stirring up the
sweet-pot on the dressing-table, when she heard a step on the echoing
stairs. It was no measured tread of any Puritan; it was the clang of
a man of war coming nearer and nearer, with loud rapid strides. She
knew the step; her heart stopped beating, not for fear, but because
she loved Sir John even yet; and she took a step forward to meet him,
and then stood still and trembled, for the flattering false thought
came before her that he might have come yet in some quick impulse of
reviving love, and that his hasty step might be prompted by the
passionate tenderness of a husband. But when he reached the door, she
looked as calm and indifferent as ever.</p>

<p>'My lady,' said he, 'you are gathering your friends to some feast.
May I know who are thus invited to revel in my house? Some graceless
fellows, I see, from the store of meat and drink below--wine-bibbers
and drunkards, I fear.'</p>

<p>But, by the working glance of his eye, she saw that he knew all;
and she spoke with a cold distinctness.</p>

<p>'Master Ephraim Dixon, Master Zerubbabel Hopkins, Master
Help-me-or-I-perish Perkins, and some other godly ministers, come to
spend the afternoon in my house.'</p>

<p>He went to her, and in his rage he struck her. She put up no arm
to save herself, but reddened a little with the pain, and then
drawing her neckerchief on one side, she looked at the crimson mark
on her white neck.</p>

<p>'It serves me right,' she said. 'I wedded one of my father's
enemies; one of those who would have hunted the old man to death. I
gave my father's enemy house and lands, when he came as a beggar to
my door; I followed my wicked, wayward heart in this, instead of
minding my dying father's words. Strike again, and avenge him yet
more!'</p>

<p>But he would not, because she bade him. He unloosed his sash, and
bound her arms tight,--tight together, and she never struggled or
spoke. Then pushing her so that she was obliged to sit down on the
bed side,--</p>

<p>'Sit there,' he said, 'and hear how I will welcome the old
hypocrites you have dared to ask to my house--my house and my
ancestors' house, long before your father--a canting pedlar--hawked
his goods about, and cheated honest men.'</p>

<p>And, opening the chamber window right above those Hall steps where
she had awaited him in her maiden beauty scarce three short years
ago, he greeted the company of preachers as they rode up to the Hall
with such terrible hideous language (my lady had provoked him past
all bearing, you see), that the old men turned round aghast, and made
the best of their way back to their own places.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sir john's serving-men below had obeyed their master's
orders. They had gone through the house, closing every window, every
shutter, and every door, but leaving all else just as it was--the
cold meats on the table, the hot meats on the spit, the silver
flagons on the side-board, all just as if it were ready for a feast;
and then Sir john's head-servant, he that I spoke of before, came up
and told his master all was ready.</p>

<p>'Is the horse and the pillion all ready? Then you and I must be my
lady's tire-women;' and as it seemed to her in mockery, but in
reality with a deep purpose, they dressed the helpless woman in her
riding things all awry, and strange and disorderly, Sir John carried
her down stairs; and he and his man bound her on the pillion; and Sir
John mounted before. The man shut and locked the great house-door,
and the echoes of the clang went through the empty Hall with an
ominous sound. 'Throw the key,' said Sir John, 'deep into the mere
yonder. My lady may go seek it if she lists, when next I set her arms
at liberty. Till then I know whose house Morton Hall shall be
called.'</p>

<p>'Sir John! it shall be called the Devil's House, and you shall be
his steward.'</p>

<p>But the poor lady had better have held her tongue; for Sir John
only laughed, and told her to rave on. As he passed through the
village, with his serving-men riding behind, the tenantry came out
and stood at their doors, and pitied him for having a mad wife, and
praised him for his care of her, and of the chance he gave her of
amendment by taking her up to be seen by the King's physician. But,
somehow, the Hall got an ugly name; the roast and boiled meats, the
ducks, the chickens had time to drop into dust, before any human
being now dared to enter in; or, indeed, had any right to enter in,
for Sir John never came back to Morton; and as for my lady, some said
she was dead, and some said she was mad, and shut up in London, and
some said Sir John had taken her to a convent abroad.</p>

<p>'And what did become of her?' asked we, creeping up to Mrs
Dawson.</p>

<p>'Nay, how should I know?'</p>

<p>'But what do you think?' we asked pertinaciously.</p>

<p>'I cannot tell. I have heard that after Sir John was killed at the
battle of the Boyne she got loose, and came wandering back to Morton,
to her old nurse's house; but, indeed, she was mad then, out and out,
and I've no doubt Sir John had seen it coming on. She used to have
visions and dream dreams: and some thought her a prophetess, and some
thought her fairly crazy. What she said about the Mortons was awful.
She doomed them to die out of the land, and their house to be razed
to the ground, while pedlars and huxters, such as her own people, her
father, had been, should dwell where the knightly Mortons had once
lived. One winter's night she strayed away, and the next morning they
found the poor crazy woman frozen to death in Drumble meeting-house
yard; and the Mr Morton who had succeeded to Sir John had her
decently buried where she was found, by the side of her father's
grave.'</p>

<p>We were silent for a time. 'And when was the old Hall opened, Mrs
Dawson, please?'</p>

<p>'Oh! when the Mr Morton, our Squire Morton's grandfather, came
into possession. He was a distant cousin of Sir john's, a much
quieter kind of man. He had all the old rooms opened wide, and aired,
and fumigated; and the strange fragments of musty food were collected
and burnt in the yard; but somehow that old dining-parlour had always
a charnel-house smell, and no one ever liked making merry in
it--thinking of the grey old preachers, whose ghosts might be even
then scenting the meats afar off, and trooping unbidden to a feast,
that was not that of which they were baulked. I was glad for one when
the squire's father built another dining-room; and no servant in the
house will go an errand into the old dining-parlour after dark, I can
assure ye.'</p>

<p>'I wonder if the way the last Mr Morton had to sell his land to
the people at Drumble had anything to do with old Lady Morton's
prophecy,' said my mother, musingly.</p>

<p>'Not at all,' said Mrs Dawson, sharply. 'My lady was crazy, and
her words not to be minded. I should like to see the cotton-spinners
of Drumble offer to purchase land from the squire. Besides, there's a
strict entail now. They can't purchase the land if they would. A set
of trading pedlars, indeed!'</p>

<p>I remember Ethelinda and I looked at each other at this word
pedlars;' which was the very word she had put into Sir john's mouth
when taunting his wife with her father's low birth and calling. We
thought, 'We shall see.'</p>

<p>Alas! we have seen.</p>

<p>Soon after that evening our good old friend Mrs Dawson died. I
remember it well, because Ethelinda and I were put into mourning for
the first time in our lives. A dear little brother of ours had died
only the year before, and then my father and mother had decided that
we were too young; that there was no necessity for their incurring
the expense of black frocks. We mourned for the little delicate
darling in our hearts, I know; and to this day I often wonder what it
would have been to have had a brother. But when Mrs Dawson died it
became a sort of duty we owed to the squire's family to go into
black, and very proud and pleased Ethelinda and I were with our new
frocks. I remember dreaming Mrs Dawson was alive again, and crying,
because I thought my new frock would be taken away from me. But all
this has nothing to do with Morton Hall.</p>

<p>When I first became aware of the greatness of the squire's station
in life, his family consisted of himself, his wife (a frail, delicate
lady), his only son, 'little master,' as Mrs Dawson was allowed to
call him, 'the young squire,' as we in the village always termed him.
His name was John Marmaduke. He was always called John; and after Mrs
Dawson's story of the old Sir John, I used to wish he might not bear
that ill-omened name. He used to ride through the village in his
bright scarlet coat, his long fair curling hair falling over his lace
collar, and his broad black hat and feather shading his merry blue
eyes, Ethelinda and I thought then, and I always shall think, there
never was such a boy. He had a fine high spirit, too, of his own, and
once horsewhipped a groom twice as big as himself who had thwarted
him. To see him and Miss Phillis go tearing through the village on
their pretty Arabian horses, laughing as they met the west wind, and
their long golden curls flying behind them, you would have thought
them brother and sister, rather than nephew and aunt; for Miss
Phillis was the squire's sister, much younger than himself; indeed,
at the time I speak of, I don't think she could have been above
seventeen, and the young squire, her nephew, was nearly ten. I
remember Mrs Dawson sending for my mother and me up to the Hall that
we might see Miss Phillis dressed ready to go with her brother to a
ball given at some great lord's house to Prince William of
Gloucester, nephew to good old George the Third.</p>

<p>When Mrs Elizabeth, Mrs Morton's maid, saw us at tea in Mrs
Dawson's room, she asked Ethelinda and me if we would not like to
come into Miss Phillis's dressing-room, and watch her dress; and then
she said, if we would promise to keep from touching anything, she
would make interest for us to go. We would have promised to stand on
our heads, and would have tried to do so too, to earn such a
privilege. So in we went, and stood together, hand-in-hand, up in a
corner out of the way, feeling very red, and shy, and hot, till Miss
Phillis put us at our case by playing all manner of comical tricks,
just to make us laugh, which at last we did outright, in spite of all
our endeavours to be grave, lest Mrs Elizabeth should complain of us
to my mother. I recollect the scent of the marechale powder with
which Miss Phillis's hair was just sprinkled; and how she shook her
head, like a young colt, to work the hair loose which Mrs Elizabeth
was straining up over a cushion. Then Mrs Elizabeth would try a
little of Mrs Morton's rouge; and Miss Phillis would wash it off with
a wet towel, saying that she liked her own paleness better than any
performer's colour; and when Mrs Elizabeth wanted just to touch her
cheeks once more, she hid herself behind the great arm-chair, peeping
out, with her sweet, merry face, first at one side and then at
another, till we all heard the squire's voice at the door, asking
her, if she was dressed, to come and show herself to madam, her
sister-in-law; for, as I said, Mrs Morton was a great invalid, and
unable to go out to any grand parties like this. We were all silent
in an instant; and even Mrs Elizabeth thought no more of the rouge,
but how to get Miss Phillis's beautiful blue dress on quick enough.
She had cherry-coloured knots in her hair, and her breast-knots were
of the same ribbon. Her gown was open in front, to a quilted white
silk skirt. We felt very shy of her as she stood there fully
dressed--she looked so much grander than anything we had ever seen;
and it was like a relief when Mrs Elizabeth told us to go down to Mrs
Dawson's parlour, where my mother was sitting all this time.</p>

<p>Just as we were telling how merry and comical Miss Phillis had
been, in came a footman. 'Mrs Dawson,' said he, 'the squire bids me
ask you to go with Mrs Sidebotham into the west parlour, to have a
look at Miss Morton before she goes.' We went, too, clinging to my
mother. Miss Phillis looked rather shy as we came in, and stood just
by the door. I think we all must have shown her that we had never
seen anything so beautiful as she was in our lives before; for she
went very scarlet at our fixed gaze of admiration, and, to relieve
herself, she began to play all manner of antics--whirling round, and
making cheeses with her rich silk petticoat; unfurling her fan (a
present from madam, to complete her dress), and peeping first on one
side and then on the other, just as she had done upstairs; and then
catching hold of her nephew, and insisting that he should dance a
minuet with her until the carriage came; which proposal made him very
angry, as it was an insult to his manhood (at nine years old) to
suppose he could dance. 'It was all very well for girls to make fools
of themselves,' he said, 'but it did not do for men.' And Ethelinda
and I thought we had never heard so fine a speech before. But the
carriage came before we had half feasted our eyes enough; and the
squire came from his wife's room to order the little master to bed,
and hand his sister to the carriage.</p>

<p>I remember a good deal of talk about royal dukes and unequal
marriages that night. I believe Miss Phillis did dance with Prince
William; and I have often heard that she bore away the bell at the
ball, and that no one came near her for beauty and pretty, merry
ways. In a day or two after I saw her scampering through the village,
looking just as she did before she had danced with a royal duke. We
all thought she would marry some one great, and used to look out for
the lord who was to take her away. But poor madam died, and there was
no one but Miss Phillis to comfort her brother, for the young squire
was gone away to some great school down south; and Miss Phillis grew
grave, and reined in her pony to keep by the squire's side, when he
rode out on his steady old mare in his lazy, careless way.</p>

<p>We did not hear so much of the doings at the Hall now Mrs Dawson
was dead; so I cannot tell how it was; but, by-and-by, there was a
talk of bills that were once paid weekly, being now allowed to run to
quarter-day; and then, instead of being settled every quarter-day,
they were put off to Christmas; and many said they had hard enough
work to get their money then. A buzz went through the village that
the young squire played high at college, and that he made away with
more money than his father could afford. But when he came down to
Morton, he was as handsome as ever; and I, for one, never believed
evil of him; though I'll allow others might cheat him, and he never
suspect it. His aunt was as fond of him as ever; and he of her. Many
is the time I have seen them out walking together, sometimes sad
enough, sometimes merry as ever. By-and-by, my father heard of sales
of small pieces of land, not included in the entail; and, at last,
things got so bad, that the very crops were sold yet green upon the
ground, for any price folks would give, so that there was but ready
money paid. The squire at length gave way entirely, and never left
the house; and the young master in London; and poor Miss Phillis used
to go about trying to see after the workmen and labourers, and save
what she could. By this time she would be above thirty; Ethelinda and
I were nineteen and twenty-one when my mother died, and that was some
years before this. Well, at last the squire died; they do say of a
broken heart at his son's extravagance; and, though the lawyers kept
it very close, it began to be rumoured that Miss Phillis's fortune
had gone too. Any way, the creditors came down on the estate like
wolves. It was entailed, and it could not be sold; but they put it
into the hands of a lawyer, who was to get what he could out of it,
and have no pity for the poor young squire, who had not a roof for
his head. Miss Phillis went to live by herself in a little cottage in
the village, at the end of the property, which the lawyer allowed her
to have because he could not let it to any one, it was so tumble-down
and old. We never knew what she lived on, poor lady; but she said she
was well in health, which was all we durst ask about. She came to see
my father just before he died, and he seemed made bold with the
feeling that he was a dying man; so he asked, what I had longed to
know for many a year, where was the young squire? he had never been
seen in Morton since his father's funeral. Miss Phillis said he was
gone abroad; but in what part he was then, she herself hardly knew;
only she had a feeling that, sooner or later, he would come back to
the old place; where she should strive to keep a home for him
whenever he was tired of wandering about, and trying to make his
fortune.</p>

<p>'Trying to make his fortune still?' asked my father, his
questioning eyes saying more than his words. Miss Phillis shook her
head, with a sad meaning in her face; and we understood it all. He
was at some French gaming-table, if he was not at an English one.</p>

<p>Miss Phillis was right. It might be a year after my father's death
when he came back, looking old and grey and worn. He came to our door
just after we had barred it one winter's evening. Ethelinda and I
still lived at the farm, trying to keep it up, and make it pay; but
it was hard work. We heard a step coming up the straight pebble walk;
and then it stopped right at our door, under the very porch, and we
heard a man's breathing, quick and short.</p>

<p>'Shall I open the door?' said I.</p>

<p>'No, wait!' said Ethelinda; for we lived alone, and there was no
cottage near us. We held our breaths. There came a knock.</p>

<p>'Who's there?' I cried.</p>

<p>'Where does Miss Morton live--Miss Phillis?'</p>

<p>We were not sure if we would answer him; for she, like us, lived
alone.</p>

<p>'Who's there?' again said I.</p>

<p>'Your master,' he answered, proud and angry. 'My name is John
Morton. Where does Miss Phillis live?'</p>

<p>We had the door unbarred in a trice, and begged him to come in; to
pardon our rudeness. We would have given him of our best, as was his
due from us; but he only listened to the directions we gave him to
his aunt's, and took no notice of our apologies.</p>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>Up to this time we had felt it rather impertinent to tell each
other of our individual silent wonder as to what Miss Phillis lived
on; but I know in our hearts we each thought about it, with a kind of
respectful pity for her fallen low estate. Miss Phillis--that we
remembered like an angel for beauty, and like a little princess for
the imperious sway she exercised, and which was such sweet compulsion
that we bad all felt proud to be her slaves--Miss Phillis was now a
worn, plain woman, in homely dress, tending towards old age; and
looking--(at that time I dared not have spoken so insolent a thought,
not even to myself)--but she did look as if she had hardly the proper
nourishing food she required. One day, I remember Mrs Jones, the
butcher's wife (she was a Drumble person) saying, in her saucy way,
that she was not surprised to see Miss Morton so bloodless and pale,
for she only treated herself to a Sunday's dinner of meat, and lived
on slop and bread-and-butter all the rest of the week. Ethelinda put
on her severe face--a look that I am afraid of to this day--and said,
'Mrs Jones, do you suppose Miss Morton can eat your half-starved
meat? You do not know how choice and dainty she is, as becomes one
born and bred like her. What was it we had to bring for her only last
Saturday from the grand new butcher's, in Drumble, Biddy?'--(We took
our eggs to market in Drumble every Saturday, for the cotton-spinners
would give us a higher price than the Morton people: the more fools
they!)</p>

<p>I thought it rather cowardly of Ethelinda to put the story-telling
on me; but she always thought a great deal of saving her soul; more
than I did, I am afraid, for I made answer, as bold as a lion, 'Two
sweet breads, at a shilling a-piece; and a forequarter of house-lamb,
at eighteen-pence a pound.' So off went Mrs Jones, in a huff, saying,
'their meat was good enough for Mrs Donkin, the great mill-owner's
widow, and might serve a beggarly Morton any day.' When we were
alone, I said to Ethelinda, 'I'm afraid we shall have to pay for our
lies at the great day of account;' and Ethelinda answered, very
sharply--(she's a good sister in the main)--'Speak for yourself,
Biddy. I never said a word. I only asked questions. How could I help
it if you told lies? I'm sure I wondered at you, how glib you spoke
out what was not true. 'But I knew she was glad I told the lies, in
her heart.</p>

<p>After the poor squire came to live with his aunt, Miss Phillis, we
ventured to speak a bit to ourselves. We were sure they were pinched.
They looked like it. He had a bad hacking cough at times; though he
was so dignified and proud he would never cough when any one was
near. I have seen him up before it was day, sweeping the dung off the
roads, to try and get enough to manure the little plot of ground
behind the cottage, which Miss Phillis had let alone, but which her
nephew used to dig in and till; for, said he, one day, in his grand,
slow way, 'he was always fond of experiments in agriculture.'
Ethelinda and I do believe that the two or three score of cabbages he
raised were all they had to live on that winter, besides the bit of
meal and tea they got at the village shop.</p>

<p>One Friday night I said to Ethelinda, 'It is a shame to take these
eggs to Drumble to sell, and never to offer one to the squire, on
whose lands we were born.' She answered, 'I have thought so many a
time; but how can we do it? I, for one, dare not offer them to the
squire; and as for Miss Phillis, it would seem like impertinence.'
'I'll try at it,' said I.</p>

<p>So that night I took some eggs--fresh yellow eggs from our own
pheasant hen, the like of which there were not for twenty miles
round--and I laid them softly after dusk on one of the little stone
seats in the porch of Miss Phillis's cottage. But, alas! when we went
to market at Drumble, early the next morning, there were my eggs all
shattered and splashed, making an ugly yellow pool in the road just
in front of the cottage. I had meant to have followed it up by a
chicken or so; but I saw now that it would never do. Miss Phillis
came now and then to call on us; she was a little more high and
distant than she had been when a girl, and we felt we must keep our
place. I suppose we had affronted the young squire, for he never came
near our house.</p>

<p>Well, there came a hard winter, and provisions rose; and Ethelinda
and I had much ado to make ends meet. If it had not been for my
sister's good management, we should have been in debt, I know; but
she proposed that we should go without dinner, and only have a
breakfast and a tea, to which I agreed, you may be sure.</p>

<p>One baking day I had made some cakes for tea--potato-cakes we
called them. They had a savoury, hot smell about them; and, to tempt
Ethelinda, who was not quite well, I cooked a rasher of bacon. Just
as we were sitting down, Miss Phillis knocked at our door. We let her
in. God only knows how white and haggard she looked. The heat of our
kitchen made her totter, and for a while she could not speak. But all
the time she looked at the food on the table as if she feared to shut
her eyes lest it should all vanish away. It was an eager stare like
that of some animal, poor soul! 'If I durst,' said Ethelinda, wishing
to ask her to share our meal, but being afraid to speak out. I did
not speak, but handed her the good, hot, buttered cake; on which she
seized, and putting it up to her lips as if to taste it, she fell
back in her chair, crying.</p>

<p>We had never seen a Morton cry before.' and it was something
awful. We stood silent and aghast. She recovered herself, but did not
taste the food; on the contrary, she covered it up with both her
hands, as if afraid of losing it. 'If you'll allow me,' said she, in
a stately kind of way, to make up for our having seen her crying,
'I'll take it to my nephew.' And she got up to go away; but she could
hardly stand for very weakness, and had to sit down again; she smiled
at us, and said she was a little dizzy, but it would soon go off; but
as she smiled, the bloodless lips were drawn far back over her teeth,
making her face seem somehow like a death's head. 'Miss Morton,' said
I, 'do honour us by taking tea with us this once. The squire, your
father, once took a luncheon with my father, and we are proud of it
to this day.' I poured her out some tea, which she drank; the food
she shrank away from as if the very sight of it turned her sick
again. But when she rose to go, she looked at it with her sad,
wolfish eyes, as if she could not leave it; and at last she broke
into a low cry, and said, 'Oh, Bridget, we are starving! we are
starving for want of food! I can bear it; I don't mind; but he
suffers--oh, how he suffers! let me take him food for this one
night.'</p>

<p>We could hardly speak; our hearts were in our throats, and the
tears ran down our cheeks like rain. We packed up a basket, and
carried it to her very door, never venturing to speak a word, for we
knew what it must have cost her to say that. When we left her at the
cottage, we made her our usual deep courtesy, but she fell upon our
necks, and kissed us. For several nights after she hovered round our
house about dusk, but she would never come in again, and face us in
candle or fire light, much less meet us by daylight. We took out food
to her as regularly as might be, and gave it to her in silence, and
with the deepest courtesies we could make, we felt so honoured. We
had many plans now she had permitted us to know of her distress. We
hoped she would allow us to go on serving her in some way as became
us as Sidebothams. But one night she never came; we stayed out in the
cold, bleak wind, looking into the dark for her thin, worn figure;
all in vain. Late the next afternoon, the young squire lifted the
latch, and stood right in the middle of our houseplace. The roof was
low overhead, and made lower by the deep beams supporting the floor
above; he stooped as he looked at us, and tried to form words, but no
sound came out of his lips. I never saw such gaunt woe; no, never! At
last he took me by the shoulder, and led me out of the house.</p>

<p>'Come with me!' he said, when we were in the open air, as if that
gave him strength to speak audibly. I needed no second word. We
entered Miss Phillis's cottage; a liberty I had never taken before.
What little furniture was there, it was clear to be seen were
cast-off fragments of the old splendour of Morton Hall. No fire. Grey
wood ashes lay on the hearth. An old settee, once white and gold, now
doubly shabby in its fall from its former estate. On it lay Miss
Phillis, very pale; very still; her eyes shut.</p>

<p>'Tell me!' he gasped. 'Is she dead? I think she is asleep; but she
looks so strang--as if she might be--' He could not say the awful
word again. I stooped, and felt no warmth; only a cold chill
atmosphere seemed to surround her.</p>

<p>'She is dead!' I replied at length. 'Oh, Miss Phillis! Miss
Phillis!' and, like a fool, I began to cry. But he sat down without a
tear, and looked vacantly at the empty hearth. I dared not cry any
more when I saw him so stony sad. I did not know what to do. I could
not leave him; and yet I had no excuse for staying. I went up to Miss
Phillis, and softly arranged the grey ragged locks about her
face.</p>

<p>'Ay!' said he. 'She must be laid out, Who so fit to do it as you
and your sister, children of good old Robert Sidebotham?'</p>

<p>'Oh, my master,' I said, 'this is no fit place for you. Let me
fetch my sister to sit up with me all night; and honour us by
sleeping at our poor little cottage.'</p>

<p>I did not expect he would have done it; but after a few minutes'
silence he agreed to my proposal. I hastened home, and told
Ethelinda, and both of us crying, we heaped up the fire, and spread
the table with food, and made up a bed in one corner of the floor.
While I stood ready to go, I saw Ethelinda open the great chest in
which we kept our treasures; and out she took a fine Holland shift
that had been one of my mother's wedding shifts; and, seeing what she
was after, I went upstairs and brought down a piece of rare old lace,
a good deal darned to be sure, but still old Brussels point,
bequeathed to me long ago by my god-mother, Mrs Dawson. We huddled
these things under our cloaks, locked the door behind us, and set out
to do all we could now for poor Miss Phillis. We found the squire
sitting just as we left him; I hardly knew if he understood me when I
told him how to unlock our door, and gave him the key, though I spoke
as distinctly as ever I could for the choking in my throat. At last
he rose and went; and Ethelinda and I composed her poor thin limbs to
decent rest, and wrapped her in the fine Holland shift; and then I
plaited up my lace into a close cap to tie up the wasted features.
When all was done we looked upon her from a little distance.</p>

<p>'A Morton to die of hunger!' said Ethelinda solemnly. 'We should
not have dared to think that such a thing was within the chances of
life. Do you remember that evening, when you and I were little
children, and she a merry young lady peeping at us from behind her
fan?'</p>

<p>We did not cry any more; we felt very still and awestruck. After a
while I said, 'I wonder if, after all, the young squire did go to our
house. He had a strange look about him. If I dared I would go and
see.' I opened the door; the night was black as pitch; the air very
still. 'I'll go,' said I; and off I went, not meeting a creature, for
it was long past eleven. I reached our house; the window was long and
low, and the shutters were old and shrunk. I could peep between them
well, and see all that was going on. He was there, sitting over the
fire, never shedding a tear; but seeming as if he saw his past life
in the embers. The food we had prepared was untouched. Once or twice,
during my long watch (I was more than an hour away), he turned
towards the food, and made as though he would have eaten it, and then
shuddered back; but at last he seized it, and tore it with his teeth,
and laughed and rejoiced over it like some starved animal. I could
not keep from crying then. He gorged himself with great morsels; and
when he could eat no more, it seemed as if his strength for suffering
had come back. He threw himself on the bed, and such a passion of
despair I never heard of, much less ever saw. I could not bear to
witness it. The dead Miss Phillis lay calm and still. Her trials were
over. I would go back and watch with Ethelinda.</p>

<p>When the pale grey morning dawn stole in, making us shiver and
shake after our vigil, the squire returned. We were both mortal
afraid of him, we knew not why. He looked quiet enough--the lines
were worn deep before--no new traces were there. He stood and looked
at his aunt for a minute or two. Then he went up into the loft above
the room where we were; he brought a small paper parcel down; bade us
keep on our watch yet a little time. First one and then the other of
us went home to get some food. It was a bitter black frost; no one
was out who could stop indoors; and those who were out cared not to
stop to speak. Towards afternoon the air darkened, and a great
snow-storm came on. We durst not be left only one alone; yet, at the
cottage where Miss Phillis had lived, there was neither fire nor
fuel. So we sat and shivered and shook till morning. The squire never
came that night nor all next day.</p>

<p>'What must we do?' asked Ethelinda, broken down entirely. 'I shall
die if I stop here another night. We must tell the neighbours and get
help for the watch.'</p>

<p>'So we must,' said I, very low and grieved. I went out and told
the news at the nearest house, taking care, you may be sure, never to
speak of the hunger and cold Miss Phillis must have endured in
silence. It was bad enough to have them come in, and make their
remarks on the poor bits of furniture; for no one had known their
bitter straits even as much as Ethelinda and me, and we had been
shocked at the bareness of the place. I did hear that one or two of
the more ill-conditioned had said, it was not for nothing we had kept
the death to ourselves for two nights; that, to judge from the lace
on her cap, there must have been some pretty pickings. Ethelinda
would have contradicted this, but I bade her let it alone; it would
save the memory of the proud Mortons from the shame that poverty is
thought to be; and as for us, why we could live it down. But, on the
whole, people came forward kindly; money was not wanting to bury her
well, if not grandly, as became her birth; and many a one was bidden
to the funeral who might have looked after her a little more in her
life-time. Among others was Squire Hargreaves from Bothwick Hall over
the moors. He was some kind of far-away cousin to the Morton's; so
when he came he was asked to go chief mourner in Squire Morton's
strange absence, which I should have wondered at the more if I had
not thought him almost crazy when I watched his ways through the
shutter that night. Squire Hargreaves started when they paid him the
compliment of asking him to take the head of the coffin.</p>

<p>'Where is her nephew?' asked he.</p>

<p>'No one has seen him since eight o'clock last Thursday
morning.'</p>

<p>'But I saw him at noon on Thursday,' said Squire Hargreaves, with
a round oath. 'He came over the moors to tell me of his aunt's death,
and to ask me to give him a little money to bury her, on the pledge
of his gold shirt-buttons. He said I was a cousin, and could pity a
gentleman in such sore need; that the buttons were his mother's first
gift to him; and that I was to keep them safe, for some day he would
make his fortune, and come back to redeem them. He had not known his
aunt was so ill, or he would have parted with these buttons sooner,
though he held them as more precious than he could tell me. I gave
him money; but I could not find in my heart to take the buttons. He
bade me not tell of all this; but when a man is missing it is my duty
to give all the clue I can.'</p>

<p>And so their poverty was blazoned abroad! But folk forgot it all
in the search for the squire on the moor-side. Two days they searched
in vain; the third, upwards of a hundred men turned out,
hand-in-hand, step to step, to leave no foot of ground unsearched.
They found him stark and stiff, with Squire Hargreaves' money, and
his mother's gold buttons, safe in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>And we laid him down by the side of his poor aunt Phillis.</p>

<p>After the squire, John Marmaduke Morton, had been found dead in
that sad way, on the dreary moors, the creditors seemed to lose all
hold on the property; which indeed, during the seven years they had
had it, they had drained as dry as a sucked orange. But for a long
time no one seemed to know who rightly was the owner of Morton Hall
and lands. The old house fell out of repair; the chimneys were full
of starlings' nests; the flags in the terrace in front were hidden by
the long grass; the panes in the windows were broken, no one knew how
or why, for the children of the village got up a tale that the house
was haunted. Ethelinda and I went sometimes in the summer mornings,
and gathered some of the roses that were being strangled by the
bindweed that spread over all; and we used to try and weed the old
flower-garden a little; but we were no longer young, and the stooping
made our backs ache. Still we always felt happier if we cleared but
ever such a little space. Yet we did not go there willingly in the
afternoons, and left the garden always long before the first slight
shade of dusk.</p>

<p>We did not choose to ask the common people--many of them were
weavers for the Drumble manufacturers, and no longer decent hedgers
and ditchers--we did not choose to ask them, I say, who was squire
now, or where he lived. But one day, a great London lawyer came to
the Morton Arms, and made a pretty stir. He came on behalf of a
General Morton, who was squire now, though he was far away in India.
He had been written to, and they had proved him heir, though he was a
very distant cousin, farther back than Sir John, I think. And now he
had sent word they were to take money of his that was in England, and
put the house in thorough repair; for that three maiden sisters of
his, who lived in some town in the north, would come and live at
Morton Hall till his return. So the lawyer sent for a Drumble
builder, and gave him directions. We thought it would have been
prettier if he had hired John Cobb, the Morton builder and joiner, he
that had made the squire's coffin, and the squire's father's before
that. Instead, came a troop of Drumble men, knocking and tumbling
about in the Hall, and making their jests up and down all those
stately rooms. Ethelinda and I never went near the place till they
were gone, bag and baggage. And then what a change! The old casement
windows, with their heavy leaded panes half overgrown with vines and
roses, were taken away, and great staring sash windows were in their
stead. New grates inside; all modern, newfangled, and smoking,
instead of the brass dogs which held the mighty logs of wood in the
old squire's time. The little square Turkey carpet under the
dining-table, which had served Miss Phillis, was not good enough for
these new Mortons; the dining-room was all carpeted over. We peeped
into the old dining-parlour--that parlour where the dinner for the
Puritan preachers had been laid out; the flag parlour, as it had been
called of late years. But it had a damp, earthy smell, and was used
as a lumber-room. We shut the door quicker than we had opened it. We
came away disappointed. The Hall was no longer like our own honoured
Morton Hall.</p>

<p>'After all, these three ladies are Morrons,' said Ethelinda to me.
'We must not forget that: we must go and pay our duty to them as soon
as they have appeared in church.'</p>

<p>Accordingly we went. But we had heard and seen a little of them
before we paid our respects at the Hall. Their maid had been down in
the village; their maid, as she was called now; but a
maid-of-all-work she had been until now, as she very soon let out
when we questioned her. However, we were never proud; and she was a
good honest farmer's daughter out of Northumberland. What work she
did make with the Queen's English! The folk in Lancashire are said to
speak broad, but I could always understand our own kindly tongue;
whereas, when Mrs Turner told me her name, both Ethelinda and I could
have sworn she said Donagh, and were afraid she was an Irishwoman.
Her ladies were what you may call past the bloom of youth; Miss
Sophronia--Miss Morton, properly--was just sixty; Miss Annabella,
three years younger; and Miss Dorothy (or Baby, as they called her
when they were by themselves), was two years younger still. Mrs
Turner was very confidential to us, partly because, I doubt not, she
had heard of our old connection with the family, and partly because
she was an arrant talker, and was glad of anybody who would listen to
her. So we heard the very first week how each of the ladies had
wished for the east bed-room--that which faced the north-east--which
no one slept in in the old squire's days; but there were two steps
leading up into it, and, said Miss Sophronia, she would never let a
younger sister have a room more elevated than she had herself She was
the eldest, and she bad a right to the steps. So she bolted herself
in for two days, while she unpacked her clothes, and then came out,
looking like a hen that has laid an egg, and defies any one to take
that honour from her.</p>

<p>But her sisters were very deferential to her in general; that must
be said. They never had more than two black feathers in their
bonnets; while she had always three. Mrs Turner said that once, when
they thought Miss Annabella had been going to have an offer of
marriage made her, Miss Sophronia had not objected to her wearing
three that winter; but when it all ended in smoke, Miss Annabella had
to pluck it out as became a younger sister. Poor Miss Annabella! She
had been a beauty (Mrs Turner said), and great things had been
expected of her. Her brother, the general, and her mother had both
spoilt her, rather than cross her unnecessarily, and so spoil her
good looks; which old Mrs Morton had always expected would make the
fortune of the family. Her sisters were angry with her for not having
married some great rich gentleman; though, as she used to say to Mrs
Turner, how could she help it? She was willing enough, but no rich
gentleman came to ask her. We agreed that it really was not her
fault; but her sisters thought it was; and now, that she had lost her
beauty, they were always casting it up what they would have done if
they had had her gifts. There were some Miss Burrells they had heard
of, each of whom had married a lord; and these Miss Burrells had not
been such great beauties. So Miss Sophronia used to work the question
by the rule of three; and put it in this way--If Miss Burrell, with a
tolerable pair of eyes, a snub nose, and a wide mouth, married a
baron, what rank of peer ought our pretty Annabella to have espoused?
And the worst was, Miss Annabella--who had never had any
ambition--wanted to have married a poor curate in her youth; but was
pulled up by her mother and sisters, reminding her of the duty she
owed to her family. Miss Dorothy had done her best--Miss Morton
always praised her for it. With not half the good looks of Miss
Annabella, she had danced with an honourable at Harrogate three times
running; and, even now, she persevered in trying; which was more than
could be said of Miss Annabella, who was very broken-spirited.</p>

<p>I do believe Mrs Turner told us all this before we had ever seen
the ladies. We had let them know, through Mrs Turner, of our wish to
pay them our respects.' so we ventured to go up to the front door,
and rap modestly. We had reasoned about it before, and agreed that if
we were going in our every-day clothes, to offer a little present of
eggs, or to call on Mrs Turner (as she had asked us to do), the back
door would have been the appropriate entrance for us. But going,
however humbly, to pay our respects, and offer our reverential
welcome to the Miss Mortons, we took rank as their visitors, and
should go to the front door. We were shown up the wide stairs, along
the gallery, up two steps, into Miss Sophronia's room. She put away
some papers hastily as we came in. We heard afterwards that she was
writing a book, to be called The Female Chesterfield; or, Letters
from a Lady of Quality to her Niece. And the little niece sat there
in a high chair, with a flat board tied to her back, and her feet in
stocks on the tail of the chair; so that she had nothing to do but
listen to her aunt's letters; which were read aloud to her as they
were written, in order to mark their effect on her manners. I was not
sure whether Miss Sophronia liked our interruption; but I know little
Miss Cordelia Mannisty did.</p>

<p>'Is the young lady crooked?' asked Ethelinda, during a pause in
our conversation. I had noticed that my sister's eyes would rest on
the child; although, by an effort, she sometimes succeeded in looking
at something else occasionally.</p>

<p>'No! indeed, ma'am,' said Miss Morton. 'But she was born in India,
and her backbone has never properly hardened. Besides, I and my two
sisters each take charge of her for a week; and their systems of
education--I might say non-education--differ so totally and entirely
from my ideas, that when Miss Mannisty comes to me, I consider myself
fortunate if I can undo the--hem!--that has been done during a
fortnight's absence. Cordelia, my dear, repeat to these good ladies
the geography lesson you learnt this morning.'</p>

<p>Poor little Miss Mannisty began to tell us a great deal about some
river in Yorkshire of which we had never heard, though I dare say we
ought to, and then a great deal more about the towns that it passed
by, and what they were famous for; and all I can remember--indeed,
could understand at the time--was that Pomfret was famous for Pomfret
cakes; which I knew before. But Ethelinda gasped for breath before it
was done, she was so nearly choked up with astonishment; and when it
was ended, she said, 'Pretty dear; it's wonderful!' Miss Morton
looked a little displeased, and replied, 'Not at all. Good little
girls can learn anything they choose, even French verbs. Yes,
Cordelia, they can. And to be good is better than to be pretty. We
don't think about looks here. You may get down, child, and go into
the garden; and take care you put your bonnet on, or you'll be all
over freckles.' We got up to take leave at the same time, and
followed the little girl out of the room. Ethelinda fumbled in her
pocket.</p>

<p>'Here's a sixpence, my dear, for you. Nay, I am sure you may take
it from an old woman like me, to whom you've told over more geography
than I ever thought there was out of the Bible.' For Ethelinda always
maintained that the long chapters in the Bible which were all names,
were geography; and though I knew well enough they were not, yet I
had forgotten what the right word was, so I let her alone; for one
hard word did as well as another. Little miss looked as if she was
not sure if she might take it; but I suppose we had two kindly old
faces, for at last the smile came into her eyes--not to her mouth,
she had lived too much with grave and quiet people for that--and,
looking wistfully at us, she said,--</p>

<p>'Thank you. But won't you go and see aunt Annabella?' We said we
should like to pay our respects to both her other aunts if we might
take that liberty; and perhaps she would show us the way. But, at the
door of a room, she stopped short, and said, sorrowfully, 'I mayn't
go in; it is not my week for being with aunt Annabella;' and then she
went slowly and heavily towards the garden-door.</p>

<p>'That child is cowed by somebody,' said I to Ethelinda.</p>

<p>'But she knows a deal of geography'--Ethelinda's speech was cut
short by the opening of the door in answer to our knock. The once
beautiful Miss Annabella Morton stood before us, and bade us enter.
She was dressed in white, with a turned-up velvet hat, and two or
three short drooping black feathers in it. I should not like to say
she rouged, but she had a very pretty colour in her cheeks; that much
can do neither good nor harm. At first she looked so unlike anybody I
had ever seen, that I wondered what the child could have found to
like in her; for like her she did, that was very clear. But, when
Miss Annabella spoke, I came under the charm. Her voice was very
sweet and plaintive, and suited well with the kind of things she
said; all about charms of nature, and tears, and grief, and such sort
of talk, which reminded me rather of poetry--very pretty to listen
to, though I never could understand it as well as plain, comfortable
prose. Still I hardly know why I liked Miss Annabella. I think I was
sorry for her; though whether I should have been if she had not put
it in my head, I don't know. The room looked very comfortable; a
spinnet in a corner to amuse herself with, and a good sofa to lie
down upon. By-and-by, we got her to talk of her little niece, and
she, too, had her system of education. She said she hoped to develop
the sensibilities and to cultivate the tastes. While with her, her
darling niece read works of imagination, and acquired all that Miss
Annabella could impart of the fine arts. We neither of us quite knew
what she was hinting at, at the time; but afterwards, by dint of
questioning little miss, and using our own eyes and ears, we found
that she read aloud to her aunt while she lay on the sofa. Santo
Sebastiano; or, the Young Protector, was what they were deep in at
this time; and, as it was in five volumes and the heroine spoke
broken English--which required to be read twice over to make it
intelligible--it lasted them a long time. She also learned to play on
the spinnet; not much, for I never heard above two tunes, one of
which was God save the King, and the other was not. But I fancy the
poor child was lectured by one aunt, and frightened by the other's
sharp ways and numerous fancies. She might well be fond of her
gentle, pensive (Miss Annabella told me she was pensive, so I know I
am right in calling her so) aunt, with her soft voice, and her
never-ending novels, and the sweet scents that hovered about the
sleepy room.</p>

<p>No one tempted us towards Miss Dorothy's apartment when we left
Miss Annabella; so we did not see the youngest Miss Morton this first
day. We had each of us treasured up many little mysteries to be
explained by our dictionary, Mrs Turner.</p>

<p>'Who is little Miss Mannisty?' we asked in one breath, when we saw
our friend from the Hall. And then we learnt that there had been a
fourth--a younger Miss Morton, who was no beauty, and no wit, and no
anything; so Miss Sophronia, her eldest sister, had allowed her to
marry a Mr Mannisty, and ever after spoke of her as 'my poor sister
Jane.' She and her husband had gone out to India, and both had died
there; and the general had made it a sort of condition with his
sisters that they should take charge of the child, or else none of
them liked children except Miss Annabella.</p>

<p>'Miss Annabella likes children,' said I. 'Then that's the reason
children like her.'</p>

<p>'I can't say she likes children; for we never have any in our
house but Miss Cordelia; but her she does like dearly.'</p>

<p>'Poor little miss!' said Ethelinda, 'does she never get a game of
play with other little girls?' And I am sure from that time Ethelinda
considered her in a diseased state from this very circumstance, and
that her knowledge of geography was one of the symptoms of the
disorder; for she used often to say, 'I wish she did not know so much
geography! I'm sure it is not quite right.'</p>

<p>Whether or not her geography was right, I don't know; but the
child pined for companions. A very few days after we had called--and
yet long enough to have passed her into Miss Annabella's week--I saw
Miss Cordelia in a corner of the church green, playing, with awkward
humility, along with some of the rough village girls, who were as
expert at the game as she was unapt and slow. I hesitated a little,
and at last I called to her.</p>

<p>'How do you, my dear?' I said. 'How come you here, so far from
home?'</p>

<p>She reddened, and then looked up at me with her large, serious
eyes.</p>

<p>'Aunt Annabel sent me into the wood to meditate--and--and--it was
very dull--and I heard these little girls playing and laughing--and I
had my sixpence with me, and--it was not wrong, was it, ma'am?--I
came to them, and told one of them I would give it to her if she
would ask the others to let me play with them.'</p>

<p>'But, my dear, they are--some of them--very rough little children,
and not fit companions for a Morton.'</p>

<p>'But I am a Mannisty, ma'am!' she pleaded, with so much entreaty
in her ways, that if I had not known what naughty, bad girls some of
them were, I could not have resisted her longing for companions of
her own age. As it was, I was angry with them for having taken her
sixpence; but, when she had told me which it was, and saw that I was
going to reclaim it, she clung to me, and said,--</p>

<p>'Oh! don't, ma'am--you must not. I gave it to her quite of my own
self.'</p>

<p>So I turned away; for there was truth in what the child said. But
to this day I have never told Ethelinda what became of her sixpence.
I took Miss Cordelia home with me while I changed my dress to be fit
to take her back to the Hall. And on the way, to make up for her
disappointment, I began talking of my dear Miss Phillis, and her
bright, pretty youth, I had never named her name since her death to
any one but Ethelinda--and that only on Sundays and quiet times. And
I could not have spoken of her to a grown-up person; but somehow to
Miss Cordelia it came out quite natural. Not of her latter days, of
course; but of her pony, and her little black King Charles's dogs,
and all the living creatures that were glad in her presence when
first I knew her. And nothing would satisfy the child but I must go
into the Hall garden and show her where Miss Phillis's garden had
been. We were deep in our talk, and she was stooping down to clear
the plot from weeds, when I heard a sharp voice cry out, 'Cordelia!
Cordelia! Dirtying your frock with kneeling on the wet grass! It is
not my week; but I shall tell your aunt Annabella of you.'</p>

<p>And the window was shut down with a jerk. It was Miss Dorothy. And
I felt almost as guilty as poor little Miss Cordelia; for I had heard
from Mrs Turner that we had given great offence to Miss Dorothy by
not going to call on her in her room that day on which we had paid
our respects to her sisters; and I had a sort of an idea that seeing
Miss Cordelia with me was almost as much of a fault as the kneeling
down on the wet grass. So I thought I would take the bull by the
horns.</p>

<p>'Will you take me to your aunt Dorothy, my dear?' said I.</p>

<p>The little girl had no longing to go into her aunt Dorothy's room,
as she had so evidently had at Miss Annabella's door. On the
contrary, she pointed it out to me at a safe distance, and then went
away in the measured step she was taught to use in that house; where
such things as running, going upstairs two steps at a time, or
jumping down three, were considered undignified and vulgar. Miss
Dorothy's room was the least prepossessing of any. Somehow it had a
north-east look about it, though it did face direct south; and as for
Miss Dorothy herself, she was more like a 'cousin Berry' than
anything else; if you know what a cousin Berry is, and perhaps it is
too old-fashioned a word to be understood by any one who has learnt
the foreign languages: but when I was a girl, there used to be poor
crazy women rambling about the country, one or two in a district.
They never did any harm that I know of; they might have been born
idiots, poor creatures! or crossed in love, who knows? But they
roamed the country, and were well known at the farm-houses, where
they often got food and shelter for as long a time as their restless
minds would allow them to stay in any one place; and the farmer's
wife would, maybe, rummage up a ribbon, or a feather, or a smart old
breadth of silk, to please the harmless vanity of these poor crazy
women; and they would go about so bedizened sometimes that, as we
called them always 'cousin Betty,' we made it into a kind of proverb
for any one dressed in a fly-away, showy style, and said they were
like a cousin Berry. So now you know what I mean that Miss Dorothy
was like. Her dress was white, like Miss Annabella's; but, instead of
the black velvet hat her sister wore, she had on, even in the house,
a small black silk bonnet. This sounds as if it should be less like a
cousin Berry than a hat; but wait till I tell you how it was
lined--with strips of red silk, broad near the face, narrow near the
brim; for all the world like the rays of the rising sun, as they are
painted on the public-house sign. And her face was like the sun; as
round as an apple; and with rouge on, without any doubt: indeed, she
told me once, a lady was not dressed unless she had put her rouge on.
Mrs Turner told us she studied reflections a great deal; not that she
was a thinking woman in general, I should say; and that this rayed
lining was the fruit of her study. She had her hair pulled together,
so that her forehead was quite covered with it; and I won't deny that
I rather wished myself at home, as I stood facing her in the doorway.
She pretended she did not know who I was, and made me tell all about
myself; and then it turned out she knew all about me, and she hoped I
had recovered from my fatigue the other day.</p>

<p>'What fatigue?' asked I, immovably. Oh! she had understood I was
very much tired after visiting her sisters; otherwise, of course, I
should not have felt it too much to come on to her room. She kept
hinting at me in so many ways, that I could have asked her gladly to
slap my face and have done with it, only I wanted to make Miss
Cordelia's peace with her for kneeling down and dirtying her frock. I
did say what I could to make things straight; but I don't know if I
did any good. Mrs Turner told me how suspicious and jealous she was
of everybody, and of Miss Annabella in particular, who had been set
over her in her youth because of her beauty; but since it had faded,
Miss Morton and Miss Dorothy had never ceased pecking at her; and
Miss Dorothy worst of all. If it had not been for little Miss
Cordelia's love, Miss Annabella might have wished to die; she did
often wish she had had the small-pox as a baby. Miss Morton was
stately and cold to her, as one who had not done her duty to her
family, and was put in the corner for her bad behaviour. Miss Dorothy
was continually talking at her, and particularly dwelling on the fact
of her being the older sister. Now she was but two years older; and
was still so pretty and gentle-looking, that I should have forgotten
it continually but for Miss Dorothy.</p>

<p>The rules that were made for Miss Cordelia! She was to eat her
meals standing, that was one thing! Another was, that she was to
drink two cups of cold water before she had any pudding; and it just
made the child loathe cold water. Then there were ever so many words
she might not use; each aunt bad her own set of words which were
ungenteel or improper for some reason or another. Miss Dorothy would
never let her say 'red;' it was always to be pink, or crimson, or
scarlet. Miss Cordelia used at one time to come to us, and tell us
she had a 'pain at her chest' so often, that Ethelinda and I began to
be uneasy, and questioned Mrs Turner to know if her mother had died
of consumption; and many a good pot of currant jelly have I given
her, and only made her pain at the chest worse; for--would you
believe it?--Miss Morton told her never to say she had got a
stomach-ache, for that it was not proper to say so, I had heard it
called by a worse name still in my youth, and so had Ethelinda; and
we sat and wondered to ourselves how it was that some kinds of pain
were genteel and others were not. I said that old families, like the
Mortons, generally thought it showed good blood to have their
complaints as high in the body as they could--brain-fevers and
headaches had a better sound, and did perhaps belong more to the
aristocracy. I thought I had got the right view in saying this, when
Ethelinda would put in that she had often heard of Lord Toffey having
the gout and being lame, and that nonplussed me. If there is one
thing I do dislike more than another, it is a person saying something
on the other side when I am trying to make up my mind--how can I
reason if I am to be disturbed by another person's arguments?</p>

<p>But though I tell all these peculiarities of the Miss Mortons,
they were good women in the main: even Miss Dorothy had her times of
kindness, and really did love her little niece, though she was always
laying traps to catch her doing wrong. Miss Morton I got to respect,
if I never liked her. They would ask us up to tea; and we would put
on our best gowns; and taking the house-key in my pocket, we used to
walk slowly through the village, wishing that people who had been
living in our youth could have seen us now, going by invitation to
drink tea with the family at the Hall--not in the housekeeper's room,
but with the family, mind you. But since they began to weave in
Morton, everybody seemed too busy to notice us; so we were fain to be
content with reminding each other how we should never have believed
it in our youth that we could have lived to this day. After tea, Miss
Morton would set us to talk of the real old family, whom they had
never known; and you may be sure we told of all their pomp and
grandeur and stately ways: but Ethelinda and I never spoke of what
was to ourselves like the memory of a sad, terrible dream. So they
thought of the squire in his coach-and-four as high sheriff, and
madam lying in her morning-room in her Genoa velvet wrapping-robe,
all over peacock's eyes (it was a piece of velvet the squire brought
back from Italy, when he had been the grand tour), and Miss Phillis
going to a ball at a great lord's house and dancing with a royal
duke. The three ladies were never tired of listening to the tale of
the splendour that had been going on here, while they and their
mother had been starving in genteel poverty up in Northumberland; and
as for Miss Cordelia, she sat on a stool at her aunt Annabella's
knee, her hand in her aunt's, and listened, open-mouthed and
unnoticed, to all we could say.</p>

<p>One day, the child came crying to our house. It was the old story;
aunt Dorothy had been so unkind to aunt Annabella! The little girl
said she would run away to India, and tell her uncle the general, and
seemed in such a paroxysm of anger, and grief, and despair, that a
sudden thought came over me. I thought I would try and teach her
something of the deep sorrow that lies awaiting all at some part of
their lives, and of the way in which it ought to be borne, by telling
her of Miss Phillis's love and endurance for her wasteful, handsome
nephew. So from little, I got to more, and I told her all; the
child's great eyes filling slowly with tears, which brimmed over and
came rolling down her cheeks unnoticed as I spoke. I scarcely needed
to make her promise not to speak about all this to any one. She said,
'I could not--no! not even to aunt Annabella.' And to this day she
never has named it again, not even to me; but she tried to make
herself more patient, and more silently helpful in the strange
household among whom she was cast.</p>

<p>By-and-by, Miss Morton grew pale, and grey, and worn, amid all her
stiffness. Mrs Turner whispered to us that for all her stern, unmoved
looks, she was ill unto death; that she had been secretly to see the
great doctor at Drumble; and he had told her she must set her house
in order. Not even her sisters knew this; but it preyed upon Mrs
Turner's mind and she told us. Long after this, she kept up her week
of discipline with Miss Cordelia; and walked in her straight,
soldier-like way about the village, scolding people for having too
large families, and burning too much coal, and eating too much
butter. One morning she sent Mrs Turner for her sisters; and, while
she was away, she rummaged out an old locket made of the four Miss
Mortons' hair when they were all children; and, threading the eye of
the locket with a piece of brown ribbon, she tied it round Cordelia's
neck, and kissing her, told her she had been a good girl, and had
cured herself of stooping; that she must fear God and honour the
king; and that now she might go and have a holiday. Even while the
child looked at her in wonder at the unusual tenderness with which
this was said, a grim spasm passed over her face, and Cordelia ran in
affright to call Mrs Turner. But when she came, and the other two
sisters came, she was quite herself again. She had her sisters in her
room alone when she wished them good-by; so no one knows what she
said, or how she told them (who were thinking of her as in health)
that the signs of near-approaching death, which the doctor had
foretold, were upon her. One thing they both agreed in saying--and it
was much that Miss Dorothy agreed in anything--that she bequeathed
her sitting-room, up the two steps, to Miss Annabella as being next
in age. Then they left her room crying, and went both together into
Miss Annabella's room, sitting hand in hand (for the first time since
childhood I should think), listening for the sound of the little
hand-bell which was to be placed close by her, in case, in her agony,
she required Mrs Turner's presence. But it never rang. Noon became
twilight. Miss Cordelia stole in from the garden with its long,
black, green shadows, and strange eerie sounds of the night wind
through the trees, and crept to the kitchen fire. At last Mrs Turner
knocked at Miss Morton's door, and hearing no reply, went in and
found her cold and dead in her chair.</p>

<p>I suppose that some time or other we had told them of the funeral
the old squire had; Miss Phillis's father, I mean. He had had a
procession of tenantry half-a-mile long to follow him to the grave.
Miss Dorothy sent for me to tell her what tenantry of her brother's
could follow Miss Morton's coffin; but what with people working in
mills, and land having passed away from the family, we could but
muster up twenty people, men and women and all; and one or two were
dirty enough to be paid for their loss of time.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Annabella did not wish to go into the room up two steps;
nor yet dared she stay behind; for Miss Dorothy, in a kind of spite
for not having had it bequeathed to her, kept telling Miss Annabella
it was her duty to occupy it; that it was Miss Sophronia's dying
wish, and that she should not wonder if Miss Sophronia were to haunt
Miss Annabella, if she did not leave her warm room, full of ease and
sweet scent, for the grim north-east chamber. We told Mrs Turner we
were afraid Miss Dorothy would lord it sadly over Miss Annabella, and
she only shook her head; which, from so talkative a woman, meant a
great deal. But, just as Miss Cordelia had begun to droop, the
general came home, without any one knowing he was coming. Sharp and
sudden was the word with him. He sent Miss Cordelia off to school;
but not before she had had time to tell us that she loved her uncle
dearly, in spite of his quick, hasty ways. He carried his sisters off
to Cheltenham; and it was astonishing how young they made themselves
look before they came back again. He was always here, there, and
everywhere: and very civil to us into the bargain; leaving the key of
the Hall with us whenever they went from home. Miss Dorothy was
afraid of him, which was a blessing, for it kept her in order, and
really I was rather sorry when she died; and, as for Miss Annabella,
she fretted after her till she injured her health, and Miss Cordelia
had to leave school to come and keep her company. Miss Cordelia was
not pretty; she had too sad and grave a look for that; but she had
winning ways, and was to have her uncle's fortune some day, so I
expected to hear of her being soon snapped up. But the general said
her husband was to take the name of Morton; and what did my young
lady do but begin to care for one of the great mill-owners at
Drumble, as if there were not all the lords and commons to choose
from besides? Mrs Turner was dead; and there was no one to tell us
about it; but I could see Miss Cordelia growing thinner and paler
every time they came back to Morton Hall; and I longed to tell her to
pluck up a spirit, and he above a cotton-spinner. One day, not half a
year before the general's death, she came to see us, and told us,
blushing like a rose, that her uncle had given his consent; and so,
although 'he' had refused to take the name of Morton, and had wanted
to marry her without a penny, and without her uncle's leave, it had
all come right at last, and they were to be married at once; and
their house was to be a kind of home for her aunt Annabella, who was
getting tired of being perpetually on the ramble with the
general.</p>

<p>'Dear old friends!' said our young lady, 'you must like him. I am
sure you will; he is so handsome, and brave, and good. Do you know,
he says a relation of his ancestors lived at Morton Hall in the time
of the Commonwealth.'</p>

<p>'His ancestors,' said Ethelinda. 'Has he got ancestors? That's one
good point about him, at any rate. I didn't know cotton-spinners had
ancestors.'</p>

<p>'What is his name?' asked I.</p>

<p>'Mr Marmaduke Carr,' said she, sounding each r with the old
Northumberland burr, which was softened into a pretty pride and
effort to give distinctness to each letter of the beloved name.</p>

<p>'Carr,' said I, 'Carr and Morton! Be it so! It was prophesied of
old!' But she was too much absorbed in the thought of her own secret
happiness to notice my poor sayings.</p>

<p>He was and is a good gentleman; and a real gentleman, too. They
never lived at Morton Hall. Just as I was writing this, Ethelinda
came in with two pieces of news. Never again say I am superstitious!
There is no one living in Morton that knows the tradition of Sir John
Morton and Alice Carr; yet the very first part of the Hall the
Drumble builder has pulled down is the old stone dining-parlour where
the great dinner for the preachers mouldered away--flesh from flesh,
crumb from crumb! And the street they are going to build right
through the rooms through which Alice Carr was dragged in her agony
of despair at her husband's loathing hatred, is to be called Carr
Street.</p>

<p>And Miss Cordelia has got a baby; a little girl; and writes in
pencil two lines at the end of her husband's note, to say she means
to call it Phillis.</p>

<p>Phillis Carr! I am glad he did not take the name of Morton. I like
to keep the name of Phillis Morton in my memory very still and
unspoken.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10"></a>The Well of Pen-Morfa</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p>Of a hundred travellers who spend a night at Tre-Madoc, in North
Wales, there is not one, perhaps, who goes to the neighbouring
village of Pen-Morfa. The new town, built by Mr Maddocks, Shelley's
friend, has taken away all the importance of the ancient
village--formerly, as its name imports, 'the head of the marsh;' that
marsh which Mr Maddocks drained and dyked, and reclaimed from the
Traeth Mawr, till Pen-Morfa, against the walls of whose cottages the
winter tides lashed in former days, has come to stand, high and dry,
three miles from the sea, on a disused road to Caernarvon. I do not
think there has been a new cottage built in Pen-Morfa this hundred
years, and many an old one has dates in some obscure corner which
tell of the fifteenth century. The joists of timber, where they meet
overhead, are blackened with the smoke of centuries. There is one
large room, round which the beds are built like cupboards, with
wooden doors to open and shut, somewhat in the old Scotch fashion, I
imagine; and below the bed (at least in one instance I can testify
that this was the case, and I was told it was not uncommon) is a
great wide wooden drawer, which contained the oat-cake, baked for
some months' consumption by the family. They call the promontory of
Llyn (the point at the end of Caernarvonshire), Welsh Wales. I think
they might call Pen-Morfa a Welsh Welsh village; it is so national in
its ways, and buildings, and inhabitants, and so different from the
towns and hamlets into which the English throng in summer. How these
said inhabitants of Pen-Morfa ever are distinguished by their names,
I, uninitiated, cannot tell. I only know for a fact, that in a family
there with which I am acquainted, the eldest son's name is John
Jones, because his father's was John Thomas; that the second son is
called David Williams, because his grandfather was William Wynn; and
that the girls are called indiscriminately by the names of Thomas and
Jones. I have heard some of the Welsh chuckle over the way in which
they have baffled the barristers at Caernarvon assizes, denying the
name under which they had been subpoenaed to give evidence, if they
were unwilling witnesses. I could tell you of a great deal which is
peculiar and wild in these true Welsh people, who are what I suppose
we English were a century ago; but I must hasten on to my tale.</p>

<p>I have received great, true, beautiful kindness from one of the
members of the family of whom I just now spoke as living at
Pen-Morfa; and when I found that they wished me to drink tea with
them, I gladly did so, though my friend was the only one in the house
who could speak English at all fluently. After tea, I went with them
to see some of their friends; and it was then I saw the interiors of
the houses of which I have spoken. It was an autumn evening: we left
mellow sunset-light in the open air when we entered the houses, in
which all seemed dark, save in the ruddy sphere of the firelight, for
the windows were very' small, and deep-set in the thick walls. Here
were an old couple, who welcomed me in Welsh; and brought forth milk
and oat-cake with patriarchal hospitality. Sons and daughters had
married away from them; they lived alone; he was blind, or nearly so;
and they sat one on each side of the fire, so old and so still (till
we went in and broke the silence) that they seemed to be listening
for death. At another house lived a woman stern and severe-looking.
She was busy hiving a swarm of bees, alone and unassisted. I do not
think my companion would have chosen to speak to her; but seeing her
out in her hill-side garden, she made some inquiry in Welsh, which
was answered in the most mournful tone I ever heard in my life; a
voice of which the freshness and 'timbre' had been choked up by tears
long years ago. I asked who she was. I dare say the story is common
enough; but the sight of the woman and her few words had impressed
me. She had been the beauty of Pen-Morfa; had been in service; had
been taken to London by the family whom she served; had come down, in
a year or so, back to Pen-Morfa, her beauty gone into that sad, wild,
despairing look which I saw; and she about to become a mother. Her
father had died during her absence, and left her a very little money;
and after her child was born, she took the little cottages where I
saw her, and made a scanty living by the produce of her bees. She
associated with no one. One event had made her savage and distrustful
to her kind. She kept so much aloof that it was some time before it
became known that her child was deformed, and had lost the use of its
lower limbs. Poor thing! When I saw the mother, it had been for
fifteen years bedridden. But go past when you would, in the night,
you saw a light burning; it was often that of the watching mother,
solitary and friendless, soothing the moaning child; or you might
hear her crooning some old Welsh air, in hopes to still the pain with
the loud monotonous music. Her sorrow was so dignified, and her mute
endurance and her patient love won her such respect, that the
neighbours would fain have been friends; but she kept alone and
solitary. This a most true story. I hope that woman and her child are
dead now, and their souls above.</p>

<p>Another story which I heard of these old primitive dwellings I
mean to tell at somewhat greater length:--</p>

<p>There are rocks high above Pen-Morfa; they are the same that hang
over Tre-Madoc, but near Pen-Morfa they sweep away, and are lost in
the plain. Everywhere they are beautiful. The great, sharp ledges,
which would otherwise look hard and cold, are adorned with the
brightest-coloured moss, and the golden lichen. Close to, you see the
scarlet leaves of the crane's-bill, and the tufts of purple heather,
which fill up every cleft and cranny; but, in the distance, you see
only the general effect of infinite richness of colour, broken, here
and there, by great masses of ivy. At the foot of these rocks come a
rich, verdant meadow or two; and then you are at Pen-Morfa. The
village well is sharp down under the rocks. There are one or two
large sloping pieces of stone in that last field, on the road leading
to the well, which are always slippery; slippery in the summer's
heat, almost as much as in the frost of winter, when some little
glassy stream that runs over them is turned into a thin sheet of ice.
Many, many years back--a lifetime ago--there lived in Pen-Morfa a
widow and her daughter. Very little is required in those
out-of-the-way Welsh villages. The wants of the people are very
simple. Shelter, fire, a little oat-cake and buttermilk, and garden
produce; perhaps some pork and bacon from the pig in winter;
clothing, which is principally of home manufacture, and of the most
enduring kind: these take very little money to purchase, especially
in a district into which the large capitalists have not yet come, to
buy up two or three acres of the peasants; and nearly every man about
Pen-Morfa owned, at the time of which I speak, his dwelling and some
land beside.</p>

<p>Eleanor Gwynn inherited the cottage (by the roadside, on the left
hand as you go from Tre-Madoc to Pen-Morfa) in which she and her
husband had lived all their married life, and a small garden sloping
southwards, in which her bees lingered before winging their way to
the more distant heather. She took rank among her neighbours as the
possessor of a moderate independence--not rich, and not poor. But the
young men of Pen-Morfa thought her very rich in the possession of a
most lovely daughter. Most of us know how very pretty Welsh women
are; but, from all accounts Nest Gwynn (Nest, or Nesta, is the Welsh
for Agnes) was more regularly beautiful than any one for miles round.
The Welsh are still fond of triads, and 'as beautiful as a summer's
morning at sunrise, as a white seagull on the green sea wave, and as
Nest Gwynn,' is yet a saying in that district. Nest knew she was
beautiful, and delighted in it. Her mother sometimes checked her in
her happy pride, and sometimes reminded her that beauty was a great
gift of God (for the Welsh are a very pious people); but when she
began her little homily, Nest came dancing to her, and knelt down
before her, and put her face up to be kissed, and so, with a sweet
interruption, she stopped her mother's lips. Her high spirits made
some few shake their heads, and some called her a flirt and a
coquette; for she could not help trying to please all, both old and
young, both men and women. A very little from Nest sufficed for this;
a sweet, glittering smile, a word of kindness, a merry glance, or a
little sympathy; all these pleased and attracted: she was like the
fairy-gifted child, and dropped inestimable gifts. But some, who had
interpreted her smiles and kind words rather as their wishes led
them, than as they were really warranted, found that the beautiful,
beaming Nest could be decided and saucy enough; and so they revenged
themselves by calling her a flirt. Her mother heard it, and sighed;
but Nest only laughed.</p>

<p>It was her work to fetch water for the day's use from the well I
told you about. Old people say it was the prettiest sight in the
world to see her come stepping lightly and gingerly over the stones
with the pail of water balanced on her head; she was too adroit to
need to steady it with her hand. They say, now that they can afford
to be charitable and speak the truth, that in all her changes to
other people, there never was a better daughter to a widowed mother
than Nest. There is a picturesque old farmhouse under Moel Gwynn, on
the road from Tre-Madoc to Criccaeth, called by some Welsh name which
I now forget; but its meaning in English is 'The End of Time;' a
strange, boding, ominous name. Perhaps, the builder meant his work to
endure till the end of time. I do not know; but there the old house
stands, and will stand for many a year. When Nest was young, it
belonged to one Edward Williams; his mother was dead, and people said
he was on the look-out for a wife. They told Nest so, but she tossed
her head and reddened, and said she thought he might look long before
he got one; so it was not strange that one morning when she went to
the well, one autumn morning when the dew lay heavy on the grass, and
the thrushes were busy among the mountain-ash berries, Edward
Williams happened to be there, on his way to the coursing match near,
and somehow his greyhounds threw her pail of water over in their
romping play, and she was very long in filling it again; and when she
came home she threw her arms round her mother's neck, and, in a
passion of joyous tears, told her that Edward Williams, of 'The End
of Time,' had asked her to marry him, and that she had said
'Yes.'</p>

<p>Eleanor Gwynn shed her tears too; but they fell quietly when she
was alone. She was thankful Nest had found a protector--one suitable
in age and apparent character, and above her in fortune; but she knew
she should miss her sweet daughter in a thousand household ways; miss
her in the evenings by the fireside; miss her when at night she
wakened up with a start from a dream of her youth, and saw her fair
face lying calm in the moonlight, pillowed by her side. Then she
forgot her dream, and blessed her child, and slept again. But who
could be so selfish as to be sad when Nest was so supremely happy;
she danced and sang more than ever; and then sat silent, and smiled
to herself: if spoken to, she started and came back to the present
with a scarlet blush, which told what she had been thinking of.</p>

<p>That was a sunny, happy, enchanted autumn. But the winter was nigh
at hand; and with it came sorrow. One fine frosty morning, Nest went
out with her lover--she to the well, he to some farming business,
which was to be transacted at the little inn of Pen-Morfa. He was
late for his appointment; so he left her at the entrance of the
village, and hastened to the inn; and she, in her best cloak and new
hat (put on against her mother's advice; but they were a recent
purchase, and very becoming), went through the Dol Mawr, radiant with
love and happiness. One who lived until lately, met her going down
towards the well that morning, and said 'he turned round to look'
after her--she seemed unusually lovely. He wondered at the time at
her wearing her Sunday clothes; for the pretty, hooded blue-cloth
cloak is kept among the Welsh women as a church and market garment,
and not commonly used, even on the coldest days of winter, for such
household errands as fetching water from the well. However, as he
said, 'It was not possible to look in her face, and "fault" anything
she wore.' Down the sloping stones the girl went blithely with her
pail. She filled it at the well; and then she took off her hat, tied
the strings together, and slung it over her arm. She lifted the heavy
pail and balanced it on her head. But, alas! in going up the smooth,
slippery, treacherous rock, the encumbrance of her cloak--it might be
such a trifle as her slung hat--something, at any rate, took away her
evenness of poise; the freshet had frozen on the slanting stone, and
was one coat of ice; poor Nest fell, and put out her hip. No more
flushing rosy colour on that sweet face; no more look of beaming
innocent happiness; instead, there was deadly pallor, and filmy eyes,
over which dark shades seemed to chase each other as the shoots of
agony grew more and more intense. She screamed once or twice; but the
exertion (involuntary, and forced out of her by excessive pain)
overcame her, and she fainted. A child, coming an hour or two
afterwards, on the same errand, saw her lying there, ice-glued to the
stone, and thought she was dead. It flew crying back.</p>

<p>'Nest Gwynn is dead! Nest Gwynn is dead!' and, crazy with fear, it
did not stop until it had hid its head in its mother's lap. The
village was alarmed, and all who were able went in haste towards the
well. Poor Nest had often thought she was dying in that dreary hour;
had taken fainting for death, and struggled against it; and prayed
that God would keep her alive till she could see her lover's face
once more; and when she did see it, white with terror, bending over
her, she gave a feeble smile, and let herself faint away into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Many a month she lay on her bed unable to move. Sometimes she was
delirious, sometimes worn-out into the deepest depression. Through
all, her mother watched her with tenderest care. The neighbours would
come and offer help. They would bring presents of country dainties;
and I do not suppose that there was a better dinner than ordinary
cooked in any household in Pen-Morfa parish, but a portion of it was
sent to Eleanor Gwynn, if not for her sick daughter, to try and tempt
her herself to eat and' be strengthened; for to no one would she
delegate the duty of watching over her child. Edward Williams was for
a long time most assiduous in his inquiries and attentions; but
by-and-by (ah! you see the dark fate of poor Nest now), he slackened,
so little at first that Eleanor blamed herself for her jealousy on
her daughter's behalf, and chid her suspicious heart. But as spring
ripened into summer, and Nest was still bedridden, Edward's coolness
was visible to more than the poor mother. The neighbours would have
spoken to her about it, but she shrunk from the subject as if they
were probing a wound. 'At any rate,' thought she, 'Nest shall be
strong before she is told about it. I will tell lies--I shall be
forgiven--but I must save my child; and when she is stronger, perhaps
I may be able to comfort her. Oh! I wish she would not speak to him
so tenderly and trustfully, when she is delirious. I could curse him
when she does.' And then Nest would call for her mother, and Eleanor
would go and invent some strange story about the summonses Edward had
had to Caernarvon assizes, or to Harlech cattle market. But at last
she was driven to her wits' end; it was three weeks since he had even
stopped at the door to inquire, and Eleanor, mad with anxiety about
her child, who was silently pining off to death for want of tidings
of her lover, put on her cloak, when she had lulled her daughter to
sleep one fine June evening, and set off to 'The End of Time.' The
great plain which stretches out like an amphitheatre, in the
half-circle of hills formed by the ranges of Moel Gwynn and the
Tre-Madoc Rocks, was all golden-green in the mellow light of sunset.
To Eleanor it might have been black with winter frost--she never
noticed outward things till she reached 'The End of Time;' and there,
in the little farm-yard, she was brought to a sense of her present
hour and errand by seeing Edward. He was examining some hay, newly
stacked; the air was scented by its fragrance, and by the lingering
sweetness of the breath of the cows. When Edward turned round at the
footstep and saw Eleanor, he coloured and looked confused; however,
he came forward to meet her in a cordial manner enough.</p>

<p>'It's a fine evening,' said he. 'How is Nest? But, indeed, your
being here is a sign she is better. Won't you come in and sit down?'
He spoke hurriedly, as if affecting a welcome which he did not
feel.</p>

<p>'Thank you. I'll just take this milking-stool and sit down here.
The open air is like balm, after being shut up so long.'</p>

<p>'It is a long time,' he replied, 'more than five months.'</p>

<p>Mrs Gwynn was trembling at heart. She felt an anger which she did
not wish to show; for, if by any manifestations of temper or
resentment she lessened or broke the waning thread of attachment
which bound him to her daughter, she felt she should never forgive
herself. She kept inwardly saying, 'Patience, patience! he may be
true, and love her yet;' but her indignant convictions gave her words
the lie.</p>

<p>'It's a long time, Edward Williams, since you've been near us to
ask after Nest,' said she. 'She may be better, or she may be worse,
for aught you know.' She looked up at him reproachfully, but spoke in
a gentle, quiet tone.</p>

<p>'I--you see the hay has been a long piece of work. The weather has
been fractious--and a master's eye is needed. Besides,' said he, as
if he had found the reason for which he sought to account for his
absence, 'I have heard of her from Rowland Jones. I was at the
surgery for some horse-medicine--he told me about her:' and a shade
came over his face, as he remembered what the doctor had said. Did he
think that shade would escape the mother's eye?</p>

<p>'You saw Rowland Jones! Oh, man-alive, tell me what he said of my
girl! He'll say nothing to me, but just hems and haws the more I pray
him. But you will tell me. You must tell me.' She stood up and spoke
in a tone of command, which his feeling of independence, weakened
just then by an accusing conscience, did not enable him to resist. He
strove to evade the question, however.</p>

<p>'It was an unlucky day that ever she went to the well!'</p>

<p>'Tell me what the doctor said of my child,' repeated Mrs Gwynn.
'Will she live, or will she die?' He did not dare to disobey the
imperious tone in which this question was put.</p>

<p>'Oh, she will live, don't be afraid. The doctor said she would
live.' He did not mean to lay any peculiar emphasis on the word
'live,' but somehow he did, and she, whose every nerve vibrated with
anxiety, caught the word.</p>

<p>'She will live!' repeated she. 'But there is something behind.
Tell me, for I will know. If you won't say, I'll go to Rowland Jones
to-night, and make him tell me what he has said to you.'</p>

<p>There had passed something in this conversation between himself
and the doctor, which Edward did not wish to have known; and Mrs
Gwynn's threat had the desired effect. But he looked vexed and
irritated.</p>

<p>'You have such impatient ways with you, Mrs Gwynn,' he
remonstrated.</p>

<p>'I am a mother asking news of my sick child,' said she. 'Go on.
What did he say? She'll live--' as if giving the clue.</p>

<p>'She'll live, he has no doubt of that. But he thinks--now don't
clench your hands so--I can't tell you if you look in that way; you
are enough to frighten a man.'</p>

<p>'I'm not speaking,' said she, in a low, husky tone. 'Never mind my
looks: she'll live--'</p>

<p>'But she'll be a cripple for life. There! you would have it out,'
said he, sulkily.</p>

<p>'A cripple for life,' repeated she, slowly. 'And I'm
one-and-twenty years older than she is!' She sighed heavily.</p>

<p>'And, as we're about it, I'll just tell you what is in my mind,'
said he, hurried and confused. 'I've a deal of cattle; and the farm
makes heavy work, as much as an able healthy woman can do. So you
see--' He stopped, wishing her to understand his meaning without
words. But she would not. She fixed her dark eyes on him, as if
reading his soul, till he flinched under her gaze.</p>

<p>'Well,' said she, at length, 'say on. Remember, I've a deal of
work in me yet, and what strength is mine is my daughter's.'</p>

<p>'You're very good. But, altogether, you must be aware, Nest will
never be the same as she was.'</p>

<p>'And you've not yet sworn in the face of God to take, her for
better, for worse; and, as she is worse'--she looked in his face,
caught her breath, and went on--'as she is worse, why, you cast her
off, not being church-tied to her. Though her body may be crippled,
her poor heart is the same--alas!--and full of love for you. Edward,
you don't mean to break it off because of our sorrows. You're only
trying me, I know,' said she, as if begging him to assure her that
her fears were false. 'But, you see, I'm a foolish woman--a poor,
foolish woman--and ready to take fright at a few words.' She smiled
up in his face; but it was a forced, doubting smile, and his face
still retained its sullen, dogged aspect.</p>

<p>'Nay, Mrs Gwynn,' said he, 'you spoke truth at first. Your own
good sense told you Nest would never be fit to be any man's
wife--unless, indeed, she could catch Mr Griffiths of Tynwntyrybwlch;
he might keep her a carriage, maybe.' Edward really did not mean to
be unfeeling; but he was obtuse, and wished to carry off his
'embarrassment by a kind of friendly joke, which he had no idea would
sting the poor mother as it did. He was startled at her manner.</p>

<p>'Put it in words like a man. Whatever you mean by my child, say it
for yourself, and don't speak as if my good sense had told me
anything. I stand here, doubting my own thoughts, cursing my own
fears. Don't be a coward. I ask you whether you and Nest are
troth-plight?'</p>

<p>'I am not a coward. Since you ask me, I answer, Nest and I were
troth-plight; but we are not. I cannot--no one would expect me to wed
a cripple. It's your own doing I've told you now; I had made up my
mind, but I should have waited a bit before telling you.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' said she, and she turned to go away; but her wrath
burst the flood-gates, and swept away discretion and forethought. She
moved, and stood in the gateway. Her lips parted, but no sound came;
with an hysterical motion, she threw her arms suddenly up to heaven,
as if bringing down lightning towards the grey old house to which she
pointed as they fell, and then she spoke--</p>

<p>'The widow's child is unfriended. As surely as the Saviour brought
the son of a widow from death to life, for her tears and cries, so
surely will God and His angels watch over my Nest, and avenge her
cruel wrongs.' She turned away weeping, and wringing her hands.</p>

<p>Edward went in-doors; he had no more desire to reckon his stores;
he sat by the fire, looking gloomily at the red ashes. He might have
been there half an hour or more, when some one knocked at the door.
He would not speak. He wanted no one's company. Another knock, sharp
and loud. He did not speak. Then the visitor opened the door, and, to
his surprise--almost to his affright--Eleanor Gwynn came in.</p>

<p>'I knew you were here. I knew you could not go out into the clear,
holy night as if nothing had happened. Oh! did I curse you? If I did,
I beg you to forgive me; and I will try and ask the Almighty to bless
you, if you will but have a little mercy--a very little. It will kill
my Nest if she knows the truth now--she is so very weak. Why, she
cannot feed herself, she is so low and feeble. You would not wish to
kill her, I think, Edward!' She looked at him, as if expecting an
answer; but he did not speak. She went down on her knees on the flags
by him.</p>

<p>'You will give me a little time, Edward, to get her strong, won't
you, now? I ask it on my bended knees! Perhaps, if I promise never to
curse you again, you will come sometimes to see her, till she is well
enough to know how all is over, and her heart's hopes crushed. Only
say you'll come for a month or so, as if you still loved her--the
poor cripple, forlorn of the world. I'll get her strong, and not tax
you long.' Her tears fell too fast for her to go on.</p>

<p>'Get up, Mrs Gwynn,' Edward said. 'Don't kneel to me. I have no
objection to come and see Nest, now and then, so that all is clear
between you and me. Poor thing! I'm sorry, as it happens, she's so
taken up with the thought of me.'</p>

<p>'It was likely, was not it? and you to have been her husband
before this time, if--oh, miserable me! to let my child go and dim
her bright life! But you'll forgive me, and come sometimes, just for
a little quarter of an hour, once or twice a week. Perhaps she'll be
asleep sometimes when you call, and then, you know, you need not come
in. If she were not so ill, I'd never ask you.'</p>

<p>So low and humble was the poor widow brought, through her
exceeding love for her daughter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>Nest revived during the warm summer weather. Edward came to see
her, and stayed the allotted quarter of an hour; but he dared not
look her in the face. She was, indeed, a cripple: one leg was much
shorter than the other, and she halted on a crutch. Her face,
formerly so brilliant in colour, was wan and pale with suffering; the
bright roses were gone, never to return. Her large eyes were sunk
deep down in their hollow, cavernous sockets; but the light was in
them still, when Edward came. Her mother dreaded her returning
strength--dreaded, yet desired it; for the heavy burden of her secret
was most oppressive at times, and she thought Edward was beginning to
weary of his enforced attentions. One October evening she told her
the truth. She even compelled her rebellious heart to take the cold,
reasoning side of the question; and she told her child that her
disabled frame was a disqualification for ever becoming a farmer's
wife. She spoke hardly, because her inner agony and sympathy was
such, she dared not trust herself to express the feelings that were
rending her. But Nest turned away from cold reason; she revolted from
her mother; she revolted from the world. She bound her sorrow tight
up in her breast, to corrode and fester there.</p>

<p>Night after night, her mother heard her cries and moans--more
pitiful, by far, than those wrung from her by bodily pain a year
before; and night after night, if her mother spoke to soothe, she
proudly denied the existence of any pain but what was physical, and
consequent upon her accident.</p>

<p>'If she would but open her sore heart to me--to me, her mother,'
Eleanor wailed forth in prayer to God, 'I would be content. Once it
was enough to have my Nest all my own. Then came love, and I knew it
would never be as before; and then I thought the grief I felt, when
Edward spoke to me, was as sharp a sorrow as could be; but this
present grief, O Lord, my God, is worst of all; and Thou only, Thou,
canst help!'</p>

<p>When Nest grew as strong as she was ever likely to be on earth,
she was anxious to have as much labour as she could bear. She would
not allow her mother to spare her anything. Hard work--bodily
fatigue--she seemed to crave. She was glad when she was stunned by
exhaustion into a dull insensibility of feeling. She was almost
fierce when her mother, in those first months of convalescence,
performed the household tasks which had formerly been hers; but she
shrank from going out of doors. Her mother thought that she was
unwilling to expose her changed appearance to the neighbours'
remarks, but Nest was not afraid of that; she was afraid of their
pity, as being one deserted and cast off. If Eleanor gave way before
her daughter's imperiousness, and sat by while Nest 'tore' about her
work with the vehemence of a bitter heart, Eleanor could have cried,
but she durst not; tears, or any mark of commiseration, irritated the
crippled girl so much, she even drew away from caresses. Everything
was to go on as it had been before she had known Edward; and so it
did, outwardly; but they trod carefully, as if the ground on which
they moved was hollow--deceptive. There was no more careless ease,
every word was guarded, and every action planned. It was a dreary
life to both. Once, Eleanor brought in a little baby, a neighbour's
child, to try and tempt Nest out of herself, by her old love of
children. Nest's pale face flushed as she saw the innocent child in
her mother's arms; and, for a moment, she made as if she would have
taken it; but then she turned away, and hid her face behind her
apron, and murmured, 'I shall never have a child to lie in my breast,
and call me mother!' In a minute she arose, with compressed and
tightened lips, and went about her household work, without her
noticing the cooing baby again, till Mrs Gwynn, heart-sick at the
failure of her little plan, took it back to its parents.</p>

<p>One day the news ran through Pen-Morfa that Edward Williams was
about to be married. Eleanor had long expected this intelligence. It
came upon her like no new thing, but it was the filling-up of her cup
of woe. She could not tell Nest. She sat listlessly in the house, and
dreaded that each neighbour who came in would speak about the village
news. At last some one did. Nest looked round from her employment,
and talked of the event with a kind of cheerful curiosity as to the
particulars, which made her informant go away, and tell others that
Nest had quite left off caring for Edward Williams. But when the door
was shut, and Eleanor and she were left alone, Nest came and stood
before her weeping mother like a stern accuser.</p>

<p>'Mother, why did not you let me die? Why did you keep me alive for
this?' Eleanor could not speak, but she put her arms out towards her
girl. Nest turned away, and Eleanor cried aloud in her soreness of
spirit. Nest came again.</p>

<p>'Mother, I was wrong. You did your best. I don't know how it is I
am so hard and cold. I wish I had died when I was a girl, and had a
feeling heart.'</p>

<p>'Don't speak so, my child. God has afflicted you sore, and your
hardness of heart is but for a time. Wait a little. Don't reproach
yourself, my poor Nest. I understand your ways. I don't mind them,
love. The feeling heart will come back to you in time. Anyways, don't
think you're grieving me; because, love, that may sting you when I'm
gone; and I'm not grieved, my darling. Most times, we're very
cheerful, I think.'</p>

<p>After this, mother and child were drawn more together. But Eleanor
had received her death from, these sorrowful, hurrying events. She
did not conceal the truth from herself, nor did she pray to live, as
some months ago she had done, for her child's sake; she had found out
that she had no power to console the poor wounded heart. It seemed to
her as if her prayers had been of no avail; and then she blamed
herself for this thought.</p>

<p>There are many Methodist preachers in this part of Wales. There
was a certain old man, named David Hughes, who was held in peculiar
reverence because he had known the great John Wesley. He had been
captain of a Caernarvon slate-vessel; he had traded in the
Mediterranean, and had seen strange sights. In those early days (to
use his own expression) he had lived without God in the world; but he
went to mock John Wesley, and was converted by the white-haired
patriarch, and remained to pray. Afterwards he became one of the
earnest, self-denying, much-abused band of itinerant preachers who
went forth under Wesley's direction, to spread abroad a more earnest
and practical spirit of religion. His rambles and travels were of use
to him. They extended his knowledge of the circumstances in which men
are sometimes placed, and enlarged his sympathy with the tried and
tempted. His sympathy, combined with the thoughtful experience of
fourscore years, made him cognizant of many of the strange secrets of
humanity; and when younger preachers upbraided the hard hearts they
met with, and despaired of the sinners, he 'suffered long, and was
kind.'</p>

<p>When Eleanor Gwynn lay low on her death-bed, David Hughes came to
Pen-Morfa. He knew her history, and sought her out. To him she
imparted the feelings I have described.</p>

<p>'I have lost my faith, David. The tempter has come, and I have
yielded. I doubt if my prayers have been heard. Day and night have I
prayed that I might comfort my child in her great sorrow; but God has
not heard me. She has turned away from me, and refused my poor love.
I wish to die now; but I have lost my faith, and have no more
pleasure in the thought of going to God. What must I do, David?'</p>

<p>She hung upon his answer; and it was long in coming.</p>

<p>'I am weary of earth,' said she, mournfully, 'and can I find rest
in death even, leaving my child desolate and broken-hearted?'</p>

<p>'Eleanor,' said David, 'where you go, all things will be made
clear; and you will learn to thank God for the end of what now seems
grievous and heavy to be borne. Do you think your agony has been
greater than the awful agony in the Garden--or your prayers more
earnest than that which He prayed in that hour when the great drops
of blood ran down his face like sweat? We know that God heard Him,
although no answer came to Him through the dread silence of that
night. God's times are not our times. I have lived eighty and one
years, and never yet have I known an earnest prayer fall to the
ground unheeded. In an unknown way, and when no one looked for it,
maybe, the answer came; a fuller, more satisfying answer than heart
could conceive of, although it might be different to what was
expected. Sister, you are going where in His light you will see
light; you will learn there that in very faithfulness he has
afflicted you!'</p>

<p>'Go on--you strengthen me,' said she.</p>

<p>After David Hughes left that day, Eleanor was calm as one already
dead, and past mortal strife. Nest was awed by the change. No more
passionate weeping--no more sorrow in the voice; though it was low
and weak, it sounded with a sweet composure. Her last look was a
smile; her last word a blessing.</p>

<p>Nest, tearless, streaked the poor worn body. She laid a plate with
salt upon it on the breast, and lighted candles for the head and
feet. It was an old Welsh custom; but when David Hughes came in, the
sight carried him back to the time when he had seen the chapels in
some old Catholic cathedral. Nest sat gazing on the dead with dry,
hot eyes.</p>

<p>'She is dead,' said David, solemnly; 'she died in Christ. Let us
bless God, my child. He giveth and He taketh away.'</p>

<p>'She is dead,' said Nest, 'my mother is dead. No one loves me
now.</p>

<p>She spoke as if she were thinking aloud, for she did not look at
David, or ask him to be seated.</p>

<p>'No one loves you now? No human creature, you mean. You are not
yet fit to be spoken to concerning God's infinite love. I, like you,
will speak of love for human creatures. I tell you if no one loves
you, it is time for you to begin to love.' He spoke almost severely
(if David Hughes ever did); for, to tell the truth, he was repelled
by her hard rejection of her mother's tenderness, about which the
neighbours had told him.</p>

<p>'Begin to love!' said she, her eyes flashing. 'Have I not loved?
Old man, you are dim, and worn-out. You do not remember what love
is.' She spoke with a scornful kind of pitying endurance. 'I will
tell you how I have loved by telling you the change it has wrought in
me. I was once the beautiful Nest Gwynn; I am now a cripple, a poor,
wan-faced cripple, old before my time. That is a change, at least
people think so.' She paused and then spoke lower. 'I tell you, David
Hughes, that outward change is as nothing compared to the change in
my nature caused by the love I have felt--and have had rejected. I
was gentle once, and if you spoke a tender word, my heart came
towards you as natural as a little child goes to its mammy. I never
spoke roughly, even to the dumb creatures, for I had a kind feeling
for all. Of late (since I loved, old man), I have been cruel in my
thoughts to every one. I have turned away from tenderness with bitter
indifference. Listen!' she spoke in a hoarse whisper. 'I will own it.
I have spoken hardly to her,' pointing towards the corpse,--'her who
was ever patient, and full of love for me. She did not know,' she
muttered, 'she is gone to the grave without knowing how I loved
her--I had such strange, mad, stubborn pride in me.'</p>

<p>'Come back, mother! Come back,' said she, crying wildly to the
still, solemn corpse; 'come back as a spirit or a ghost--only come
back, that I may tell you how I have loved you.'</p>

<p>But the dead never come back.</p>

<p>The passionate adjuration ended in tears--the first she had shed.
When they ceased, or were absorbed into long quivering sobs, David
knelt down. Nest did not kneel, but bowed her head. He prayed, while
his own tears fell fast. He rose up. They were both calm.</p>

<p>'Nest,' said he, 'your love has been the love of
youth--passionate, wild, natural to youth. Henceforward, you must
love like Christ, without thought of self, or wish for return. You
must take the sick and the weary to your heart, and love them. That
love will lift you up above the storms of the world into God's own
peace. The very vehemence of your nature proves that you are capable
of this. I do not pity you. You do not require pity. You are powerful
enough to trample down your own sorrows into a blessing for others;
and to others you will be a blessing. I see it before you, I see in
it the answer to your mother's prayer.'</p>

<p>The old man's dim eyes glittered as if they saw a vision; the
fire-light sprang up, and glinted on his long white hair. Nest was
awed as if she saw a prophet, and a prophet he was to her.</p>

<p>When next David Hughes came to Pen-Morfa, he asked about Nest
Gwynn, with a hovering doubt as to the answer. The inn-folk told him
she was living still in the cottage, which was now her own.</p>

<p>'But would you believe it, David,' said Mrs Thomas, 'she has gone
and taken Mary Williams to live with her? You remember Mary Williams,
I'm sure.'</p>

<p>No! David Hughes remembered no Mary Williams at Pen-Morfa.</p>

<p>'You must have seen her, for I know you've called at John
Griffiths', where the parish boarded her?'</p>

<p>'You don't mean the half-witted woman--the poor crazy
creature?'</p>

<p>'But I do!' said Mrs Thomas.</p>

<p>'I have seen her sure enough, but I never thought of learning her
name. And Nest Gwynn has taken her to live with her.'</p>

<p>'Yes! I thought I should surprise you. She might have had many a
decent girl for companion. My own niece, her that is an orphan, would
have gone, and been thankful. Besides, Mary Williams is a regular
savage at times: John Griffiths says there were days when he used to
beat her till she howled again, and yet she would not do as he told
her. Nay, once, he says, if he had not seen her eyes glare like a
wild beast, from under the shadow of the table where she had taken
shelter, and got pretty quickly out of her way, she would have flown
upon him, and throttled him. He gave Nest fair warning of what she
must expect, and he thinks some day she will be found murdered.'</p>

<p>David Hughes thought a while. 'How came Nest to take her to live
with her?' asked he.</p>

<p>'Well! Folk say John Griffiths did not give her enough to eat.
Half-wits, they tell me, take more to feed them than others, and
Eleanor Gwynn had given her oat-cake, and porridge a time or two, and
most likely spoken kindly to her (you know Eleanor spoke kind to
all), so some months ago, when John Griffiths had been beating her,
and keeping her without food to try and tame her, she ran away, and
came to Nest's cottage in the dead of night, all shivering and
starved, for she did not know Eleanor was dead, and thought to meet
with kindness from her, I've no doubt; and Nest remembered how her
mother used to feed and comfort the poor idiot, and made her some
gruel, and wrapped her up by the fire. And, in the morning, when John
Griffiths came in search of Mary, he found her with Nest, and Mary
wailed so piteously at the sight of him, that Nest went to the parish
officers, and offered to take her to board with her for the same
money they gave to him. John says he was right glad to be off his
bargain.'</p>

<p>David Hughes knew there was a kind of remorse which sought relief
in the performance of the most difficult and repugnant tasks. He
thought he could understand how, in her bitter repentance for her
conduct towards her mother, Nest had taken in the first helpless
creature that came seeking shelter in her name. It was not what he
would have chosen, but he knew it was God that had sent the poor
wandering idiot there.</p>

<p>He went to see Nest the next morning. As he drew near the
cottage--it was summer time, and the doors and windows were all
open--he heard an angry passionate kind of sound that was scarcely
human. That sound prevented his approach from being heard; and,
standing at the threshold, he saw poor Mary Williams pacing backwards
and forwards in some wild mood. Nest, cripple as she was, was walking
with her, speaking low soothing words, till the pace was slackened,
and time and breathing was given to put her arm around the crazy
woman's neck, and soothe her by this tender caress into the quiet
luxury of tears--tears which give the hot brain relief. Then David
Hughes came in. His first words, as he took off his hat, standing on
the lintel, were--'The peace of God be upon this house.' Neither he
nor Nest recurred to the past, though solemn recollections filled
their minds. Before he went, all three knelt and prayed; for, as Nest
told him, some mysterious influence of peace came over the poor
half-wit's mind, when she heard the holy words of prayer; and often
when she felt a paroxysm coming on, she would kneel and repeat a
homily rapidly over, as if it were a charm to scare away the Demon in
possession; sometimes, indeed, the control over herself requisite for
this effort was enough to dispel the fluttering burst. When David
rose up to go, he drew Nest to the door.</p>

<p>'You are not afraid, my child?' asked he.</p>

<p>'No,' she replied. 'She is often very good and quiet. When she is
not, I can bear it.'</p>

<p>'I shall see your face on earth no more,' said he. 'God bless
you!' He went on his way. Not many weeks after, David Hughes was
borne to his grave.</p>

<p>The doors of Nest's heart were opened--opened wide by the love she
grew to feel for crazy Mary, so helpless, so friendless, so dependent
upon her. Mary loved her back again, as a dumb animal loves its blind
master. It was happiness enough to be near her. In general, she was
only too glad to do what she was bidden by Nest. But there were times
when Mary was overpowered by the glooms and fancies of her poor
disordered brain. Fearful times! No one knew how fearful. On those
days, Nest warned the little children who loved to come and play
around her, that they must not visit the house. The signal was a
piece of white linen hung out of a side window. On those days, the
sorrowful and sick waited in vain for the sound of Nest's lame
approach. But what she had to endure was only known to God, for she
never complained. If she had given up the charge of Mary, or if the
neighbours had risen, out of love and care for her life, to compel
such a step, she knew what hard curses and blows, what starvation and
misery, would await the poor creature.</p>

<p>She told of Mary's docility, and her affection, and her innocent,
little sayings; but she never told the details of the occasional days
of wild disorder, and driving insanity.</p>

<p>Nest grew old before her time, in consequence of her accident. She
knew that she was as old at fifty as many are at seventy. She knew it
partly by the vividness with which the remembrance of the days of her
youth came back to her mind, while the events of yesterday were dim
and forgotten. She dreamt of her girlhood and youth. In sleep, she
was once more the beautiful Nest Gwynn, the admired of all beholders,
the light-hearted girl, beloved by her mother. Little circumstances
connected with those early days, forgotten since the very time when
they occurred, came back to her mind, in her waking hours. She had a
scar on the palm of her left hand, occasioned by the fall of a branch
of a tree, when she was a child. It had not pained her since the
first two days after the accident; but now it began to hurt her
slightly; and clear in her ears was the crackling sound of the
treacherous, rending wood; distinct before her rose the presence of
her mother, tenderly binding up the wound. With these remembrances
came a longing desire to see the beautiful, fatal well once more
before her death. She had never gone so far since the day when, by
her fall there, she lost love and hope, and her bright glad youth.
She yearned to look upon its waters once again. This desire waxed as
her life waned. She told it to poor crazy Mary.</p>

<p>'Mary!' said she, 'I want to go to the Rock Well. If you will help
me, I can manage it. There used to be many a stone in the Dol Mawr on
which I could sit and rest. We will go to-morrow morning before folks
are astir.'</p>

<p>Mary answered briskly, 'Up, up! To the Rock Well. Mary will go.
Mary will go.' All day long she kept muttering to herself, 'Mary will
go.'</p>

<p>Nest had the happiest dream that night. Her mother stood beside
her--not in the flesh, but in the bright glory of a blessed spirit.
And Nest was no longer young--neither was she old--'they reckon not
by days, nor years, where she was gone to dwell;' and her mother
stretched out her arms to her with a calm, glad look of welcome. She
awoke; the woodlark was singing in the near copse--the little birds
were astir, and rustling in their leafy nests. Nest arose, and called
Mary. The two set out through the quiet lane. They went along slowly
and silently. With many a pause they crossed the broad Dol Mawr, and
carefully descended the sloping stones, on which no trace remained of
the hundreds of feet that had passed over them since Nest was last
there. The clear water sparkled and quivered in the early sunlight,
the shadows of the birch-leaves were stirred on the ground; the
ferns--Nest could have believed that they were the very same ferns
which she had seen thirty years before--hung wet and dripping where
the water overflowed--a thrush chanted matins from a hollybush
near--and the running stream made a low, soft, sweet accompaniment.
All was the same. Nature was as fresh and young as ever. It might
have been yesterday that Edward Williams had overtaken her, and told
her his love--the thought of his words--his handsome looks--(he was a
gray, hard-featured man by this time), and then she recalled the
fatal wintry morning when joy and youth had fled; and as she
remembered that faintness of pain, a new, a real faintness--no echo
of the memory--came over her. She leant her back against a rock,
without a moan or sigh, and died! She found immortality by the
well-side, instead of her fragile, perishing youth. She was so calm
and placid that Mary (who had been dipping her fingers in the well,
to see the waters drop off in the gleaming sunlight), thought she was
asleep, and for some time continued her amusement in silence. At
last, she turned, and said,--</p>

<p>'Mary is tired. Mary wants to go home.' Nest did not speak, though
the idiot repeated her plaintive words. She stood and looked till a
strange terror came over her--a terror too mysterious to be
borne.</p>

<p>'Mistress, wake! Mistress, wake!' she said, wildly, shaking the
form.</p>

<p>But Nest did not awake. And the first person who came to the well
that morning found crazy Mary sitting, awestruck, by the poor dead
Nest. They had to get the poor creature away by force, before they
could remove the body.</p>

<p>Mary is in Tre-Madoc workhouse. They treat her pretty kindly, and,
in general, she is good and tractable. Occasionally, the old
paroxysms come on; and, for a time, she is unmanageable. But some one
thought of speaking to her about Nest. She stood arrested at the
name; and, since then, it is astonishing to see what efforts she
makes to curb her insanity; and when the dread time is past, she
creeps up to the matron, and says, 'Mary has tried to be good. Will
God let her go to Nest now?'</p>

<h2><a name="ch11"></a>The Shah's English Gardener</h2>

<p>The facts of the following narration were communicated to me by
Mr. Burton, the head gardener at Teddesley Park, in Staffordshire. I
had previously been told that he had been for a year or two in the
service of the Shah of Persia; and this induced me to question him
concerning the motives which took him so far from England, and the
kind of life which he led at Teheran. I was so much interested in the
details he gave me, that I made notes at the time, which have enabled
me to draw up the following account:---</p>

<p>Mr. Burton is a fine-looking, healthy man, in the prime of life,
whose appearance would announce his nation all the world over. He had
completed his education as a gardener at Knight's, when, in 1848, an
application was made to him, on behalf of the Shah of Persia, by
Colonel Sheil, the English envoy at the court of Teheran; who
proposed to Mr. Burton that he should return to Persia with the
second Persian secretary to the embassy, Mirza Oosan Koola, and take
charge of the Royal Gardens at Teheran, at a salary of a hundred
pounds a year, with rooms provided for him, and an allowance of two
shillings a day for the food of himself and the native servant whom
he would find it necessary to employ. This prospect, and the desire,
which is so natural to young men, to see countries beyond their own,
led Mr. Burton to accept the proposal. The Mirza Oosan Koola and he
left Southampton on the twenty-ninth of September, 1848, and went by
steam to Constantinople. Thence they journeyed without accident to
the capital of Persia. The seat of government was removed to Teheran
about seventy years ago, when the Kujur dynasty became possessed of
the Persian throne. Their faction was predominant in the North of
Persia, and they, consequently, felt more secure in Teheran than in
the ancient southern capital Teheran is situated in the midst of a
wide plain, from two to three hundred miles long, which has a most
dreary appearance, being totally uncultivated, and the soil of which
is a light kind of reddish loam, that becomes pulverised after a long
continuance of dry weather, and then rises as great clouds of sand,
sometimes even obscuring the sun several hours in a day for several
successive clays.</p>

<p>Bad news awaited Mr. Burton on his arrival at Teheran. The Shah,
who had commissioned Colonel Sheil to engage an English gardener, was
dead. His successor cared little either about gardening or his
predecessor's engagements. Colonel Sheil was in England. Mr. Burton's
heart sank a little within him; but, having a stout English spirit,
and great faith in the British embassy, he insisted on a partial
fulfilment of the contract. Until this negotiation was completed, Mr.
Burton was lodged in the house of Mirza Ocean Koola. Mr. Burton was,
therefore, for a month, a member of a Persian household belonging to
one of the upper middle classes.</p>

<p>The usual mode of living in one house seemed pretty nearly the
same in all that fell under the range of Mr. Burton's observation.
The Persians get up at sunrise, when they have a cup of coffee. The
few hours in the day in which they condescend to labour in any way,
are from sunrise until seven or eight o'clock in the morning. After
that, the heat becomes so intense (frequently one hundred and eight
or one hundred and nine degrees in the shade) that all keep within
doors, lying about on mats in passages or rooms. At ten they have
their first substantial meal; which consists of mutton and rice,
stewed together in a rude saucepan over a charcoal fire, built out of
doors. Sometimes, in addition to this dish, they have a kind of soup,
or "water-meat" (which is the literal translation of the Persian
name), made of water, mutton, onions, parsley, fowls, rice, dried
fruits, apricots, almonds, and walnuts, stewed together. But this, as
we may guess from the multiplicity of the ingredients, is a dainty
dish. At four o'clock, the panting Persians, nearly worn out by the
heat of the day, take a cup of strongly perfumed tea, with a little
bitter-orange juice squeezed into it; and after this tonic they
recover strength enough to smoke and lounge. Dinner was the grand
meal of the clay, to which they invited friends. It wan not unlike
breakfast, but was preceded by a dessert, at which wine was
occasionally introduced, but which always consisted of melons and
dried fruits. The dinner was brought in on a pewter tray; but Mr.
Burton remarked that the pewter dishes were very dingy. A piece of
common print was spread on the ground, and cakes of bread put on it.
They had no spoons for the soup, or "water-meat," but soaked their
bread in it, or curled it round into a hollow shape, and fished up
what they could out of the abyss. At the Mirza's they had spoons for
the sour goat's-milk, with ice, which seemed to be one of their
delicacies. The ice is brought down from the mountains, and sold
pretty cheaply in the bazaars. Sugar and salt are eaten together with
this iced sour goat's-milk. Smoking narghilahs beguiles the evening
hours very pleasantly. They pluck a quantity of rose-blossoms and put
them into the water through which the smoke passes; but the roses
last in season only a month. Mirza Ocean Koola had a few chairs in
the house for the use of the gentlemen of the Embassy.</p>

<p>At last the negotiation respecting Mr. Burton's engagement was
ended. His friends at the Embassy bad insisted that the present Shah
should install him in the office of royal gardener at the salary
proposed by his predecessor. Accordingly, about a month after his
arrival at Teheran, he took possession of two rooms, appropriated to
his use, in the garden of El Kanai. This garden consisted of six
acres, with a mud-wall all around. There were avenues of fruit-trees
planted, with lucerne growing under them, which was cut for the food
of the horses in the royal stable; but the lucerne and the trees gave
this royal garden very much the aspect of an English orchard, and
must have been a very disenchanting prospect for a well-trained
gardener, accustomed to our flower-beds, and vegetable-gardens. The
fruit trees were apricots, apples, pears, and cherries--the latter of
the same description as ours, but finer in quality; the apricots were
of a kind which Mr. Burton had never seen before, with large sweet
kernels. He brought some of the stones with him to England, and gave
them to his old master, Mr. Knight. If this square plot of
orchard-ground, surrounded by a mud-wall, was the cheerless prospect
outside, the two rooms which Mr. Burton was to inhabit were not much
more attractive. Bare of all furniture, with floors of mud and chaff
beaten together, they did not even contain the mats which play so
many parts in Persian houses. Mr. Burton's first care was to purchase
mats, and hire a servant to market and cook for him. The people at
the Embassy sent him the various bales of seeds, roots, and
implements, which he had brought with him from England; and he hoped
before long to introduce some improvements into Persian gardening; so
little did he as yet know the nature of the people with whom he had
to deal. But before he was well settled in his two rooms, while he
was yet unpacking his English bales, some native plasterers told him
that, outside of his wooden door (which fastened only with a slight
chain), six men lay in wait for him to do him evil, partly prompted
by the fact of his being a foreigner, partly in hopes of obtaining
possession of some of the contents of these bales.</p>

<p>It was two miles to the Embassy, and Mr. Burton was without a
friend nearer; his very informants would not stand by him, but would
rather rejoice in his discomfiture. But, being a brave, resolute man,
he picked out a scythe from among his English implements, threw open
the door, and began to address the six men (who, sure enough, lay
crouched near the entrance) in the best Persian he could muster. His
Persian eloquence, or possibly the sight of the scythe wielded by a
stout, resolute man, produced the desired effect: the six men,
fortunately, went away, without having attacked him, for any effort
at self-defence on his part would have strengthened the feeling of
hostility already strong against him. Once more, he was left in quiet
to unpack his goods, with such shaded light as two windows, covered
over with paper and calico, could give. But when his tools were
unpacked--tools selected with such care and such a hoping heart in
England--who were to use them? The men appointed as gardeners under
him would not work, because they were never paid. If Mr. Burton made
them work, he should pay them, they said. At length he did persuade
them to labour, during the hours in which exertion was possible, even
to a native. Mr. Burton began to inquire how these men were paid, or
if their story was true, that they never were. It was true that wages
for labour done for the Shah were most irregularly given. And, when
the money could no longer be refused, it was paid in the form of
bills upon some gate to a town, or some public bath, a hundred or a
hundred and twenty miles away, such gates and baths being royal
property. Honest payment of wages being rare, of course stealing is
plentiful; and it is even winked at by the royal officers. The
gardeners under Mr. Burton, for instance, would gather the flowers he
had cherished with care, and present them to any chief who came into
the Baugh-el-Kanai; and the present they received in turn constituted
their only means of livelihood. Sometimes, Mr. Burton was the sole
labourer in this garden, and he had the charge of Baugh-el-Colleza,
twenty square acres in size, and at some distance from El Kanai,
where he lived. When the hot weather came on, he fell ill of
diarrhea, and for three months lay weary and ill on his mat, unable
to superintend, if there were gardeners, or to work himself, if there
were none.</p>

<p>After he recovered, he seems to have been hopeless of doing any
good in such a climate, and among such a people. The Shah took little
interest in horticulture. He sometimes came into the gardens of El
Kanai (in which his palace was situated), and would ask, some
questions, through an interpreter, in a languid, weary kind of way.
Sometimes, when Mr. Burton had any vegetables ready, he requested
leave to present them himself to the Shah; when this was accorded, he
wove a basket out of the twigs of the white poplar (the tree which
most abounded on the great barren plain surrounding Teheran); and,
filling this with lettuces, or peas, or similar garden produce, he
was ushered with much ceremony into one of the courts ("small yards,"
as Mr. Burton once irreverently called them) belonging to the palace.
There, in a kind of balcony projecting from one of the windows, the
Shah sat; and the English gardener, without shoes, but with the
lamb's-skin fez covering his head, bowed low three times, as he gave
up his basket to be handed to the Shah. Mr. Burton did not perform
the Persian salaam, considering such a slave-like obeisance
unbefitting a European. The Shah received these baskets of
vegetables, some of which were new to him, with great indifference,
not caring to ask any questions. The spirit of curiosity, however,
was alive in the harem, if nowhere else; and, one clay, Mr. Burton
was surprised to receive a command to go and sow some annuals in one
of the courts of the harem, for such was the Queen-mother's desire.
So, taking a few packets of common flower-seeds, he went through some
rooms in the palace, before he arrived at the courts, which open one
out of another. These rooms Mr. Burton considered as little better,
whether in size, construction, or furniture, than his own
garden-dwelling; but there are some apartments in this royal palace
which are said to be splendid--one lined with plate-glass, and
several fitted up with the beautiful painted windows for which Persia
is celebrated. On entering the courts belonging to the harem, Mr.
Burton found himself attended by three or four soldiers and two
eunuchs--all with drawn swords, which they made a little parade of
holding above him, rather to his amusement, especially as he seems to
have had occasional glimpses of peeping ladies, who ought rather to
have had the swords held over them. Before pawing from one yard to
another, one or two soldiers would precede him, to ace that the coast
was clear. And if a veiled lady chanced, through that ignorance which
is bliss all the world over, to come into the very yard where he was,
the soldiers seized him, huddled him into a dark corner, and turned
his face to the wall; she, meanwhile, passing through under the cover
of her servant's large cloak, something like a chicken peeping from
under the wing of the hen. Whatever might have been their danger from
the handsome young Englishman, he, at least, was not particularly
attracted, by their appearance. The utmost praise he could bestow
was, that "one or two were tolerably good-looking;" and, on being
pressed for details, he said that those ladies of the harem of whom
he caught a glimpse resembled all other Persian women, in having very
large features, very coarse complexions, and large eyes. They (as
well as the men) paint the eyebrows, so as to make them appear to
meet. They are stoutly-built. Such were the observations which Mr.
Burton made, as he was passing through the yards, or courts, which
led into the small garden where he was to sow his flower-seeds. Here
the Queen-mother sat in a projecting balcony; but, as soon as she saw
the stranger, she drew back. She is about thirty-five years of age,
and possesses much influence in the country; which, as she is a cruel
and ambitious woman, has produced great evils.</p>

<p>One day, Mrs. Sheil's maid, who had accompanied her mistress on a
visit to the ladies in the harem, fell in with a Frenchwoman who had
been an inhabitant there for more than twenty years. She seemed
perfectly contented with her situation, and had no wish to exchange
it for any other.</p>

<p>Every now and then Mr. Burton sent flowers to the harem: such as
he could cultivate in the dry, hot garden, with no command of labour.
Marvel of Peru, African marigolds, single stocks, and violets planted
along the sides of the walks between planes and poplars, were the
flowers he gathered to form his nosegays. But all gardening was weary
and dreary work; partly owing to the great heat of the climate,
partly to the scarcity of water, but most especially because there
was no service or assistance to be derived from any other man. The
men appointed to assist him grew more careless and lazy than ever as
time rolled on; he had no means of enforcing obedience, or attention,
and, if he had had, he would not have dared to use it, and so to
increase the odium that attached to him as a foreigner. Moreover, no
one cared whether the gardens flourished or decayed. If it had not
been for the kindness of some of the English residents, among whom he
especially mentioned Mr. Reads, his situation would have been utterly
intolerable.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the external life of the place which could
compensate for his individual disappointment; at least, he perceived
nothing. One day, in crossing the market-place, he saw eight men
lying with their heads cut off; executed for being religious
fanatics, who had assumed the character of prophets. At another time,
there were six men put to death for highway robbery; and the mode of
death was full of horror, whatever their crimes might be. They were
hung head downwards, with the right arm and leg cut off; one of them
dragged out life in this state for three days. Even the minor
punishments are cruel and vindictive, as they always are where the
power and execution of the laws is uncertain. One of the penalties
inflicted for slight offences, is to have a string passed through the
nostrils, and to be led for three successive days through the bazaars
and market-places by a crier, proclaiming the nature of the
misdemeanour committed. Blindness is very common: Mr. Burton has
often seen six or eight blind men walking in a string, each with his
right arm on the shoulder of his precursor. It is partly caused by
ophthalmia, produced by the dust, and partly clue to the Shah having
it in his power to inflict the punishment of pulling out both, or one
of, the eyes. The great-grandfather of the present Shah, Aga
Mohammed, the founder of the Kujur dynasty, had large baskets-full of
the eyes of his enemies presented to him after his accession to the
throne.</p>

<p>Let us change the subject to attar of roses; though all the
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten the memory of that last sentence.
Attar of roses is made and sold in the bazaars; the rose employed is
the common single pink one, which must be gathered before the sudden
rise of the hot sun causes the clew to evaporate. By the side of the
attar-sellers may be seen the Jew, selling trinkets; the
Armenians--Christians in name, and, as such, bound by no laws of
Mohammed--selling a sweetish red wine and arrakee, a spirit made from
the refuse of grapes and resembling gin; while through the bazaars
men go, having leathern bags on their backs containing bad, dirty
water, and a lump of ice in a basin, into which they pour out
draughts for their customers. Ice is brought clown from the
mountains, and sold at the rate of a large lump for two or three
pools--a pool being a small copper coin, of which thirty make one
koraun (silver), value eleven-pence; and ten korauns make one tomaun,
a gold coin of the value of nine shillings. The drinking-water is
procured from open drains, or from tanks, in which all the washing
the Persians ever give their clothes is done. They use no soap even
for shaving; but soapy water would be preferable to the beverage
obtained from these sources, with vermin floating on its surface. No
wonder that the cholera returns every three years, and is a fatal
scourge; especially when we learn that the doctors and barbers in
Teheran, as formerly in England, unite the two professions and that
the great resource in all cases of illness is the lancet.</p>

<p>Besides the shops in the bazaars, where provisions and beverages
of various kinds are sold, there are others for silks, carpets,
embroidered pieces, something like the Indian shawls, but smaller in
size, and purchased by the Europeans for waistcoats; and Cashmere
shawls, which even there, and though not always new, bear the high
prices of from fifty pounds to one hundred pounds. Those which were
presented to the ladies of the Embassy were worth, at Teheran, one
hundred pounds apiece. There are also lamb's-skin caps, or fezzes,
about half a yard high, conical in shape, and open, or crownless, at
the top; heavier than a hat, but much cooler, owing to the
ventilation produced by this opening. No Europeans wear hats, except
one or two at the Embassy. Cotton materials are used for dresses by
the common people, manufactured at Teheran. There are very few
articles of British manufacture Bold in the bazaars; but French,
German, and Russian things abound. A fondness for watches seems to be
a Persian weakness; some of the higher classes will wear two at a
time, like the English dandies sixty years ago; and sometimes both
these watches will be in a state of stand-still. It is therefore no
wonder that a little German watchmaker, who is settled at Teheran, is
making his fortune. The mode of reckoning time is from sunrise to
sunset--prayers being said by the faithful before each of these. The
day and night are each divided into "watches" of three hours long;
subdividing the time between sunrise and mid-day, mid-day and
sunset.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton saw little of the religious ceremonies of the Persians.
He had never been inside a mosque; but had seen people saying their
prayers at the appointed times (at the expiration of every watch
through the day, he believed), on raised platforms, erected for the
purpose, up and down the town. The form of washing the hands before
they say their prayers is gone through by country-people on the dusty
plain, using soil instead of water--the more purifying article of the
two, one would suppose, after hearing Mr. Burton's account of the
state of the drains and tanks in Teheran. The priests are recognised
by the white turbans which they wear as a class distinction; and our
English gardener does not seem to have come in contact with any of
them, excepting in occasional rencontres in the streets; where the
women, veiled and shrouded, shuffle along--their veils being
transparent just at the eyes, so as to enable them to see without
being seen; while their clumsy, shapeless mantles effectually prevent
all recognition, even from husband or father. The higher class (the
wives of Mirzas, or noblemen) are conveyed in a kind of covered
hand-barrow from place to place. This species of rude carriage will
hold two ladies sitting upright, and has a small door on either side;
it is propelled by one before and one behind.</p>

<p>As long as these national peculiarities were novel enough to
excite curiosity, Mr. Burton had something to relieve the monotony of
his life, which was very hopeless in the horticultural line.
By-and-by it sank into great sameness. The domestic changes were of
much the same kind as the Vicar of Wakefield's migration from the
blue bed to the brown: for three or four months in the hot season,
Mr. Burton conveyed his mat up the mud-staircase, which led from his
apartments through a trap-door on to the flat roof, and slept there.
When the hot weather was over, Mr. Burton came down under cover. He
felt himself becoming utterly weary and enervated; and probably
wondered less than he had done on his first arrival at the lazy way
in which the natives worked; sitting down, for instance, to build a
wall. Indifference, which their religion may dignify in some things
into fatalism, seemed to prevail everywhere and in every person. They
ate their peas and beans unshelled, rather than take any unnecessary
trouble; a piece of piggism which especially scandalised him.</p>

<p>Twice in the year there were great religious festivals, which
roused the whole people into animation and enthusiasm. One in the
spring was the Noorooz, when a kind of miracle-play was acted
simultaneously upon the various platforms in the city; the grandest
representation of all being in the market-place, where thirty or
forty thousand attended. The subject of this play is the death of the
sons of Ali; the Persians being Sheeah, or followers of Ali, and, as
such, regarded as schismatics by the more orthodox Turks, who do not
believe in the three successors of Mohammed. This "mystery" is
admirably performed, and excites the Persians to passionate weeping.
A Frank ambassador is invariably introduced, who comes to intercede
for the sons of Ali. This is the tradition of the Persians; and,
although not corroborated by any European legend, it is so faithfully
believed in by the Persians, that it has long procured for the
Europeans a degree of kindly deference, very different from the
feeling with which they are regarded by the Ali-hating Turks. The
other religious festival occurs some time in August, and is of much
the came description; some event (Mr. Burton believed it was the
death of Mohammed) being dramatised, and acted in all the open public
places. The weeping and wailing are as general at this representation
as at the other. Mr. Burton himself said, "he was so out up by it, he
could not help crying;" and excused himself for what he evidently
considered a weakness, by saying that everybody there was doing the
same.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Shah rode abroad; he and his immediate attendants
were well mounted; but behind, around, came a rabble rout to the
number of one, two, or even three thousand, on broken-down horses, on
mules, on beggarly donkeys, or running on foot, their rags waving in
the wind, everybody, anybody, anyhow. The soldiers in attendance did
not contribute to the regularity or uniformity of the scene, as there
is no regulation height, and the dwarf of four feet ten jostles his
brother in arms who towers above him at the stature of six feet
six.</p>

<p>In strange contrast with this wild tumult and disorderly crowd
must be one of the Shah's amusements, which consists in listening to
Mr. Burgess (the appointed English interpreter), who translates the
Times, Illustrated News, and, occasionally, English books, for the
pleasure of the Shah. One wonders what ideas certain words convey,
representative of the order and uniform regularity of England.</p>

<p>In October, 1849, Colonel Shiel returned to Teheran, after his
sojourn in England; and soon afterwards it was arranged that Mr.
Burton should leave Persia, and shorten his time of engagement to the
Shah by one-half. Accordingly, as soon as he had completed a year in
Teheran, he began to make preparations for returning to Europe; and
about March, 1850, he arrived at Constantinople, where he remained
another twelvemonth. The remembrance of Mr. Burton's Oriental life
must be in strange contrast to the regular, well-ordered comfort of
his present existence.</p>
