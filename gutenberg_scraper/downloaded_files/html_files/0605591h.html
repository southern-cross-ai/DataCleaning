<h2><a name="ch1"></a>The Phantom Coach</h2>

<p>The circumstances I am about to relate to you have truth to
recommend them. They happened to myself, and my recollection of them
is as vivid as if they had taken place only yesterday. Twenty years,
however, have gone by since that night. During those twenty years I
have told the story to but one other person. I tell it now with a
reluctance which I find it difficult to overcome. All I entreat,
meanwhile, is that you will abstain from forcing your own conclusions
upon me. I want nothing explained away. I desire no arguments. My
mind on this subject is quite made up, and, having the testimony of
my own senses to rely upon, I prefer to abide by it.</p>

<p>Well! It was just twenty years ago, and within a day or two of the
end of the grouse season. I had been out all day with my gun, and had
had no sport to speak of. The wind was due east; the month, December;
the place, a bleak wide moor in the far north of England. And I had
lost my way. It was not a pleasant place in which to lose one's way,
with the first feathery flakes of a coming snowstorm just fluttering
down upon the heather, and the leaden evening closing in all around.
I shaded my eyes with my hand, and staled anxiously into the
gathering darkness, where the purple moorland melted into a range of
low hills, some ten or twelve miles distant. Not the faintest
smoke-wreath, not the tiniest cultivated patch, or fence, or
sheep-track, met my eyes in any direction. There was nothing for it
but to walk on, and take my chance of finding what shelter I could,
by the way. So I shouldered my gun again, and pushed wearily forward;
for I had been on foot since an hour after daybreak, and had eaten
nothing since breakfast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the snow began to come down with ominous steadiness,
and the wind fell. After this, the cold became more intense, and the
night came rapidly up. As for me, my prospects darkened with the
darkening sky, and my heart grew heavy as I thought how my young wife
was already watching for me through the window of our little inn
parlour, and thought of all the suffering in store for her throughout
this weary night. We had been married four months, and, having spent
our autumn in the Highlands, were now lodging in a remote little
village situated just on the verge of the great English moorlands. We
were very much in love, and, of course, very happy. This morning,
when we parted, she had implored me to return before dusk, and I had
promised her that I would. What would I not have given to have kept
my word!</p>

<p>Even now, weary as I was, I felt that with a supper, an hour's
rest, and a guide, I might still get back to her before midnight, if
only guide and shelter could be found.</p>

<p>And all this time, the snow fell and the night thickened. I
stopped and shouted every now and then, but my shouts seemed only to
make the silence deeper. Then a vague sense of uneasiness came upon
me, and I began to remember stories of travellers who had walked on
and on in the falling snow until, wearied out, they were fain to lie
down and sleep their lives away. Would it be possible, I asked
myself, to keep on thus through all the long dark night? Would there
not come a time when my limbs must fail, and my resolution give way?
When I, too, must sleep the sleep of death. Death! I shuddered. How
hard to die just now, when life lay all so bright before me! How hard
for my darling, whose whole loving heart but that thought was not to
be borne! To banish it, I shouted again, louder and longer, and then
listened eagerly. Was my shout answered, or did I only fancy that I
heard a far-off cry? I halloed again, and again the echo followed.
Then a wavering speck of light came suddenly out of the dark,
shifting, disappearing, growing momentarily nearer and brighter.
Running towards it at full speed, I found myself, to my great joy,
face to face with an old man and a lantern.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" was the exclamation that burst involuntarily from my
lips.</p>

<p>Blinking and frowning, he lifted his lantern and peered into my
face.</p>

<p>"What for?" growled he, sulkily.</p>

<p>"Well--for you. I began to fear I should be lost in the snow."</p>

<p>"Eh, then, folks do get cast away hereabouts fra' time to time,
an' what's to hinder you from bein' cast away likewise, if the Lord's
so minded?"</p>

<p>"If the Lord is so minded that you and I shall be lost together,
friend, we must submit," I replied; "but I don't mean to be lost
without you. How far am I now from Dwolding?"</p>

<p>"A gude twenty mile, more or less."</p>

<p>"And the nearest village?"</p>

<p>"The nearest village is Wyke, an' that's twelve mile t'other
side."</p>

<p>"Where do you live, then?"</p>

<p>"Out yonder," said he, with a vague jerk of the lantern.</p>

<p>"You're going home, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I am."</p>

<p>"Then I'm going with you."</p>

<p>The old man shook his head, and rubbed his nose reflectively with
the handle of the lantern.</p>

<p>"It ain't o' no use," growled he. "He 'ont let you in--not
he."</p>

<p>"We'll see about that," I replied, briskly. "Who is He?"</p>

<p>"The master."</p>

<p>"Who is the master?"</p>

<p>"That's nowt to you," was the unceremonious reply.</p>

<p>"Well, well; you lead the way, and I'll engage that the master
shall give me shelter and a supper to-night."</p>

<p>"Eh, you can try him!" muttered my reluctant guide; and, still
shaking his head, he hobbled, gnome-like, away through the falling
snow. A large mass loomed up presently out of the darkness, and a
huge dog rushed out, barking furiously.</p>

<p>"Is this the house?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ay, it's the house. Down, Bey!" And he fumbled in his pocket for
the key.</p>

<p>I drew up close behind him, prepared to lose no chance of
entrance, and saw in the little circle of light shed by the lantern
that the door was heavily studded with iron nails, like the door of a
prison. In another minute he had turned the key and I had pushed past
him into the house.</p>

<p>Once inside, I looked round with curiosity, and found myself in a
great raftered hall, which served, apparently, a variety of uses. One
end was piled to the roof with corn, like a barn. The other was
stored with flour-sacks, agricultural implements, casks, and all
kinds of miscellaneous lumber; while from the beams overhead hung
rows of hams, flitches, and bunches of dried herbs for winter use. In
the centre of the floor stood some huge object gauntly dressed in a
dingy wrapping-cloth, and reaching half way to the rafters. Lifting a
corner of this cloth, I saw, to my surprise, a telescope of very
considerable size, mounted on a rude movable platform, with four
small wheels. The tube was made of painted wood, bound round with
bands of metal rudely fashioned; the speculum, so far as I could
estimate its size in the dim light, measured at least fifteen inches
in diameter. While I was yet examining the instrument, and asking
myself whether it was not the work of some self-taught optician, a
bell rang sharply.</p>

<p>"That's for you," said my guide, with a malicious grin. "Yonder's
his room."</p>

<p>He pointed to a low black door at the opposite side of the hall. I
crossed over, rapped somewhat loudly, and went in, without waiting
for an invitation. A huge, white-haired old man rose from a table
covered with books and papers, and confronted me sternly.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said he. "How came you here? What do you want?"</p>

<p>"James Murray, barrister-at-law. On foot across the moor. Meat,
drink, and sleep."</p>

<p>He bent his bushy brows into a portentous frown.</p>

<p>"Mine is not a house of entertainment," he said, haughtily.
"Jacob, how dared you admit this stranger?"</p>

<p>"I didn't admit him," grumbled the old man. "He followed me over
the muir, and shouldered his way in before me. I'm no match for six
foot two."</p>

<p>"And pray, sir, by what right have you forced an entrance into my
house?"</p>

<p>"The same by which I should have clung to your boat, if I were
drowning. The right of self-preservation."</p>

<p>"Self-preservation?"</p>

<p>"There's an inch of snow on the ground already," I replied,
briefly; "and it would be deep enough to cover my body before
daybreak."</p>

<p>He strode to the window, pulled aside a heavy black curtain, and
looked out.</p>

<p>"It is true," he said. "You can stay, if you choose, till morning.
Jacob, serve the supper."</p>

<p>With this he waved me to a seat, resumed his own, and became at
once absorbed in the studies from which I had disturbed him.</p>

<p>I placed my gun in a corner, drew a chair to the hearth, and
examined my quarters at leisure. Smaller and less incongruous in its
arrangements than the hall, this room contained, nevertheless, much
to awaken my curiosity. The floor was carpetless. The whitewashed
walls were in parts scrawled over with strange diagrams, and in
others covered with shelves crowded with philosophical instruments,
the uses of many of which were unknown to me. On one side of the
fireplace, stood a bookcase filled with dingy folios; on the other, a
small organ, fantastically decorated with painted carvings of
medi&aelig;val saints and devils. Through the half-opened door of a
cupboard at the further end of the room, I saw a long array of
geological specimens, surgical preparations, crucibles, retorts, and
jars of chemicals; while on the mantelshelf beside me, amid a number
of small objects, stood a model of the solar system, a small galvanic
battery, and a microscope. Every chair had its burden. Every corner
was heaped high with books. The very floor was littered over with
maps, casts, papers, tracings, and learned lumber of all conceivable
kinds.</p>

<p>I stared about me with an amazement increased by every fresh
object upon which my eyes chanced to rest. So strange a room I had
never seen; yet seemed it stranger still, to find such a room in a
lone farmhouse amid those wild and solitary moors! Over and over
again, I looked from my host to his surroundings, and from his
surroundings back to my host, asking myself who and what he could be?
His head was singularly fine; but it was more the head of a poet than
of a philosopher. Broad in the temples, prominent over the eyes, and
clothed with a rough profusion of perfectly white hair, it had all
the ideality and much of the ruggedness that characterises the head
of Louis von Beethoven. There were the same deep lines about the
mouth, and the same stern furrows in the brow. There was the same
concentration of expression. While I was yet observing him, the door
opened, and Jacob brought in the supper. His master then closed his
book, rose, and with more courtesy of manner than he had yet shown,
invited me to the table.</p>

<p>A dish of ham and eggs, a loaf of brown bread, and a bottle of
admirable sherry, were placed before me.</p>

<p>"I have but the homeliest farmhouse fare to offer you, sir," said
my entertainer. "Your appetite, I trust, will make up for the
deficiencies of our larder."</p>

<p>I had already fallen upon the viands, and now protested, with the
enthusiasm of a starving sportsman, that I had never eaten anything
so delicious.</p>

<p>He bowed stiffly, and sat down to his own supper, which consisted,
primitively, of a jug of milk and a basin of porridge. We ate in
silence, and, when we had done, Jacob removed the tray. I then drew
my chair back to the fireside. My host, somewhat to my surprise, did
the same, and turning abruptly towards me, said:</p>

<p>"Sir, I have lived here in strict retirement for three-and-twenty
years. During that time, I have not seen as many strange faces, and I
have not read a single newspaper. You are the first stranger who has
crossed my threshold for more than four years. Will you favour me
with a few words of information respecting that outer world from
which I have parted company so long?"</p>

<p>"Pray interrogate me," I replied. "I am heartily at your
service."</p>

<p>He bent his head in acknowledgment; leaned forward, with his
elbows resting on his knees and his chin supported in the palms of
his hands; stared fixedly into the fire; and proceeded to question
me.</p>

<p>His inquiries related chiefly to scientific matters, with the
later progress of which, as applied to the practical purposes of
life, he was almost wholly unacquainted. No student of science
myself, I replied as well as my slight information permitted; but the
task was far from easy, and I was much relieved when, passing from
interrogation to discussion, he began pouring forth his own
conclusions upon the facts which I had been attempting to place
before him. He talked, and I listened spellbound. He talked till I
believe he almost forgot my presence, and only thought aloud. I had
never heard anything like it then; I have never heard anything like
it since. Familiar with all systems of all philosophies, subtle in
analysis, bold in generalisation, he poured forth his thoughts in an
uninterrupted stream, and, still leaning forward in the same moody
attitude with his eyes fixed upon the fire, wandered from topic to
topic, from speculation to speculation, like an inspired dreamer.
From practical science to mental philosophy; from electricity in the
wire to electricity in the nerve; from Watts to Mesmer, from Mesmer
to Reichenbach, from Reichenbach to Swedenborg, Spinoza, Condillac,
Descartes, Berkeley, Aristotle, Plato, and the Magi and mystics of
the East, were transitions which, however bewildering in their
variety and scope, seemed easy and harmonious upon his lips as
sequences in music. By-and-by--I forget now by what link of
conjecture or illustration--he passed on to that field which lies
beyond the boundary line of even conjectural philosophy, and reaches
no man knows whither. He spoke of the soul and its aspirations; of
the spirit and its powers; of second sight; of prophecy; of those
phenomena which, under the names of ghosts, spectres, and
supernatural appearances, have been denied by the sceptics and
attested by the credulous, of all ages.</p>

<p>"The world," he said, "grows hourly more and more sceptical of all
that lies beyond its own narrow radius; and our men of science foster
the fatal tendency. They condemn as fable all that resists
experiment. They reject as false all that cannot be brought to the
test of the laboratory or the dissecting-room. Against what
superstition have they waged so long and obstinate a war, as against
the belief in apparitions? And yet what superstition has maintained
its hold upon the minds of men so long and so firmly? Show me any
fact in physics, in history, in arch&aelig;ology, which is supported
by testimony so wide and so various. Attested by all races of men, in
all ages, and in all climates, by the soberest sages of antiquity, by
the rudest savage of to-day, by the Christian, the Pagan, the
Pantheist, the Materialist, this phenomenon is treated as a nursery
tale by the philosophers of our century. Circumstantial evidence
weighs with them as a feather in the balance. The comparison of
causes with effects, however valuable in physical science, is put
aside as worthless and unreliable. The evidence of competent
witnesses, however conclusive in a court of justice, counts for
nothing. He who pauses before he pronounces, is condemned as a
trifler. He who believes, is a dreamer or a fool."</p>

<p>He spoke with bitterness, and, having said thus, relapsed for some
minutes into silence. Presently he raised his head from his hands,
and added, with an altered voice and manner, "I, sir, paused,
investigated, believed, and was not ashamed to state my convictions
to the world. I, too, was branded as a visionary, held up to ridicule
by my contemporaries, and hooted from that field of science in which
I had laboured with honour during all the best years of my life.
These things happened just three-and-twenty years ago. Since then, I
have lived as you see me living now, and the world has forgotten me,
as I have forgot--ten the world. You have my history."</p>

<p>"It is a very sad one," I murmured, scarcely knowing what to
answer.</p>

<p>"It is a very common one," he replied. "I have only suffered for
the truth, as many a better and wiser man has suffered before
me."</p>

<p>He rose, as if desirous of ending the conversation, and went over
to the window.</p>

<p>"It has ceased snowing," he observed, as he dropped the curtain,
and came back to the fireside.</p>

<p>"Ceased!" I exclaimed, starting eagerly to my feet. "Oh, if it
were only possible--but no! it is hopeless. Even if I could find my
way across the moor, I could not walk twenty miles to-night."</p>

<p>"Walk twenty miles to-night!" repeated my host. "What are you
thinking of?"</p>

<p>"Of my wife," I replied, impatiently. "Of my young wife, who does
not know that I have lost my way, and who is at this moment breaking
her heart with suspense and terror."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"At Dwolding, twenty miles away."</p>

<p>"At Dwolding," he echoed, thoughtfully. "Yes, the distance, it is
true, is twenty miles; but--are you so very anxious to save the next
six or eight hours?"</p>

<p>"So very, very anxious, that I would give ten guineas at this
moment for a guide and a horse."</p>

<p>"Your wish can be gratified at a less costly rate," said he,
smiling. "The night mail from the north, which changes horses at
Dwolding, passes within five miles of this spot, and will be due at a
certain cross-road in about an hour and a quarter. If Jacob were to
go with you across the moor, and put you into the old coach-road, you
could find your way, I suppose, to where it joins the new one?"</p>

<p>"Easily--gladly."</p>

<p>He smiled again, rang the bell, gave the old servant his
directions, and, taking a bottle of whisky and a wineglass from the
cupboard in which he kept his chemicals, said:</p>

<p>"The snow lies deep, and it will be difficult walking to-night on
the moor. A glass of usquebaugh before you start?"</p>

<p>I would have declined the spirit, but he pressed it on me, and I
drank it. It went down my throat like liquid flame, and almost took
my breath away.</p>

<p>"It is strong," he said; "but it will help to keep out the cold.
And now you have no moments to spare. Good night!"</p>

<p>I thanked him for his hospitality, and would have shaken hands,
but that he had turned away before I could finish my sentence. In
another minute I had traversed the hall, Jacob had locked the outer
door behind me, and we were out on the wide white moor.</p>

<p>Although the wind had fallen, it was still bitterly cold. Not a
star glimmered in the black vault overhead. Not a sound, save the
rapid crunching of the snow beneath our feet, disturbed the heavy
stillness of the night. Jacob, not too well pleased with his mission,
shambled on before in sullen silence, his lantern in his hand, and
his shadow at his feet. I followed, with my gun over my shoulder, as
little inclined for conversation as himself. My thoughts were full of
my late host. His voice yet rang in my ears. His eloquence yet held
my imagination captive. I remember to this day, with surprise, how my
over-excited brain retained whole sentences and parts of sentences,
troops of brilliant images, and fragments of splendid reasoning, in
the very words in which he had uttered them. Musing thus over what I
had heard, and striving to recall a lost link here and there, I
strode on at the heels of my guide, absorbed and unobservant.
Presently--at the end, as it seemed to me, of only a few minutes--he
came to a sudden halt, and said:</p>

<p>"Yon's your road. Keep the stone fence to your right hand, and you
can't fail of the way."</p>

<p>"This, then, is the old coach-road?"</p>

<p>"Ay, 'tis the old coach-road."</p>

<p>"And how far do I go, before I reach the cross-roads?"</p>

<p>"Nigh upon three mile."</p>

<p>I pulled out my purse, and he became more communicative.</p>

<p>"The road's a fair road enough," said he, "for foot passengers;
but 'twas over steep and narrow for the northern traffic. You'll mind
where the parapet's broken away, close again the sign-post. It's
never been mended since the accident."</p>

<p>"What accident?"</p>

<p>"Eh, the night mail pitched right over into the valley below--a
gude fifty feet an' more--just at the worst bit o' road in the whole
county."</p>

<p>"Horrible! Were many lives lost?"</p>

<p>"All. Four were found dead, and t'other two died next
morning."</p>

<p>"How long is it since this happened?"</p>

<p>"Just nine year."</p>

<p>"Near the sign-post, you say? I will bear it in mind. Good
night."</p>

<p>"Gude night, sir, and thankee." Jacob pocketed his half-crown,
made a faint pretence of touching his hat, and trudged back by the
way he had come.</p>

<p>I watched the light of his lantern till it quite disappeared, and
then turned to pursue my way alone. This was no longer matter of the
slightest difficulty, for, despite the dead darkness overhead, the
line of stone fence showed distinctly enough against the pale gleam
of the snow. How silent it seemed now, with only my footsteps to
listen to; how silent and how solitary! A strange disagreeable sense
of loneliness stole over me. I walked faster. I hummed a fragment of
a tune. I cast up enormous sums in my head, and accumulated them at
compound interest. I did my best, in short, to forget the startling
speculations to which I had but just been listening, and, to some
extent, I succeeded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the night air seemed to become colder and colder, and
though I walked fast I found it impossible to keep myself warm. My
feet were like ice. I lost sensation in my hands, and grasped my gun
mechanically. I even breathed with difficulty, as though, instead of
traversing a quiet north country highway, I were scaling the
uppermost heights of some gigantic Alp. This last symptom became
presently so distressing, that I was forced to stop for a few
minutes, and lean against the stone fence. As I did so, I chanced to
look back up the road, and there, to my infinite relief, I saw a
distant point of light, like the gleam of an approaching lantern. I
at first concluded that Jacob had retraced his steps and followed me;
but even as the conjecture presented itself, a second light flashed
into sight--a light evidently parallel with the first, and
approaching at the same rate of motion. It needed no second thought
to show me that these must be the carriage-lamps of some private
vehicle, though it seemed strange that any private vehicle should
take a road professedly disused and dangerous.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt, however, of the fact, for the lamps grew
larger and brighter every moment, and I even fancied I could already
see the dark outline of the carriage between them. It was coming up
very fast, and quite noiselessly, the snow being nearly a foot deep
under the wheels.</p>

<p>And now the body of the vehicle became distinctly visible behind
the lamps. It looked strangely lofty. A sudden suspicion flashed upon
me. Was it possible that I had passed the cross-roads in the dark
without observing the sign-post, and could this be the very coach
which I had come to meet?</p>

<p>No need to ask myself that question a second time, for here it
came round the bend of the road, guard and driver, one outside
passenger, and four steaming greys, all wrapped in a soft haze of
light, through which the lamps blazed out, like a pair of fiery
meteors.</p>

<p>I jumped forward, waved my hat, and shouted. The mail came down at
full speed, and passed me. For a moment I feared that I had not been
seen or heard, but it was only for a moment. The coachman pulled up;
the guard, muffled to the eyes in capes and comforters, and
apparently sound asleep in the rumble, neither answered my hail nor
made the slightest effort to dismount; the outside passenger did not
even turn his head. I opened the door for myself, and looked in.
There were but three travellers inside, so I stepped in, shut the
door, slipped into the vacant corner, and congratulated myself on my
good fortune.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the coach seemed, if possible, colder than that
of the outer air, and was pervaded by a singularly damp and
disagreeable smell. I looked round at my fellow-passengers. They were
all three, men, and all silent. They did not seem to be asleep, but
each leaned back in his corner of the vehicle, as if absorbed in his
own reflections. I attempted to open a conversation.</p>

<p>"How intensely cold it is to-night," I said, addressing my
opposite neighbour.</p>

<p>He lifted his head, looked at me, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"The winter," I added, "seems to have begun in earnest."</p>

<p>Although the corner in which he sat was so dim that I could
distinguish none of his features very clearly, I saw that his eyes
were still turned full upon me. And yet he answered never a word.</p>

<p>At any other time I should have felt, and perhaps expressed, some
annoyance, but at the moment I felt too ill to do either. The icy
coldness of the night air had struck a chill to my very marrow, and
the strange smell inside the coach was affecting me with an
intolerable nausea. I shivered from head to foot, and, turning to my
left-hand neighbour, asked if he had any objection to an open
window?</p>

<p>He neither spoke nor stirred.</p>

<p>I repeated the question somewhat more loudly, but with the same
result. Then I lost patience, and let the sash down. As I did so, the
leather strap broke in my hand, and I observed that the glass was
covered with a thick coat of mildew, the accumulation, apparently, of
years. My attention being thus drawn to the condition of the coach, I
examined it more narrowly, and saw by the uncertain light of the
outer lamps that it was in the last stage of dilapidation. Every part
of it was not only out of repair, but in a condition of decay. The
sashes splintered at a touch. The leather fittings were crusted over
with mould, and literally rotting from the woodwork. The floor was
almost breaking away beneath my feet. The whole machine, in short,
was foul with damp, and had evidently been dragged from some outhouse
in which it had been mouldering away for years, to do another day or
two of duty on the road.</p>

<p>I turned to the third passenger, whom I had not yet addressed, and
hazarded one more remark.</p>

<p>"This coach," I said, "is in a deplorable condition. The regular
mail, I suppose, is under repair?"</p>

<p>He moved his head slowly, and looked me in the face, without
speaking a word. I shall never forget that look while I live. I
turned cold at heart under it. I turn cold at heart even now when I
recall it. His eyes glowed with a fiery unnatural lustre. His face
was livid as the face of a corpse. His bloodless lips were drawn back
as if in the agony of death, and showed the gleaming teeth
between.</p>

<p>The words that I was about to utter died upon my lips, and a
strange horror--a dreadful horror--came upon me. My sight had by this
time become used to the gloom of the coach, and I could see with
tolerable distinctness. I turned to my opposite neighbour. He, too,
was looking at me, with the same startling pallor in his face, and
the same stony glitter in his eyes. I passed my hand across my brow.
I turned to the passenger on the seat beside my own, and saw--oh
Heaven! how shall I describe what I saw? I saw that he was no living
man--that none of them were living men, like myself! A pale
phosphorescent light--the light of putrefaction--played upon their
awful faces; upon their hair, dank with the dews of the grave; upon
their clothes, earth-stained and dropping to pieces; upon their
hands, which were as the hands of corpses long buried. Only their
eyes, their terrible eyes, were living; and those eyes were all
turned menacingly upon me!</p>

<p>A shriek of terror, a wild unintelligible cry for help and mercy;
burst from my lips as I flung myself against the door, and strove in
vain to open it.</p>

<p>In that single instant, brief and vivid as a landscape beheld in
the flash of summer lightning, I saw the moon shining down through a
rift of stormy cloud--the ghastly sign-post rearing its warning
finger by the wayside--the broken parapet--the plunging horses--the
black gulf below. Then, the coach reeled like a ship at sea. Then,
came a mighty crash--a sense of crushing pain--and then,
darkness.</p>

<p>It seemed as if years had gone by when I awoke one morning from a
deep sleep, and found my wife watching by my bedside I will pass over
the scene that ensued, and give you, in half a dozen words, the tale
she told me with tears of thanksgiving. I had fallen over a
precipice, close against the junction of the old coach-road and the
new, and had only been saved from certain death by lighting upon a
deep snowdrift that had accumulated at the foot of the rock beneath.
In this snowdrift I was discovered at daybreak, by a couple of
shepherds, who carried me to the nearest shelter, and brought a
surgeon to my aid. The surgeon found me in a state of raving
delirium, with a broken arm and a compound fracture of the skull. The
letters in my pocket-book showed my name and address; my wife was
summoned to nurse me; and, thanks to youth and a fine constitution, I
came out of danger at last. The place of my fall, I need scarcely
say, was precisely that at which a frightful accident had happened to
the north mail nine years before.</p>

<p>I never told my wife the fearful events which I have just related
to you. I told the surgeon who attended me; but he treated the whole
adventure as a mere dream born of the fever in my brain. We discussed
the question over and over again, until we found that we could
discuss it with temper no longer, and then we dropped it. Others may
form what conclusions they please--I know that twenty years ago I was
the fourth inside passenger in that Phantom Coach.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2"></a>An Engineer's Story</h2>

<p>His name, sir, was Matthew Price; mine is Benjamin Hardy. We were
born within a few days of each other; bred up in the same village;
taught at the same school. I cannot remember the time when we were
not close friends. Even as boys, we never knew what it was to
quarrel. We had not a thought, we had not a possession, that was not
in common. We would have stood by each other, fearlessly, to the
death. It was such a friendship as one reads about sometimes in
books: fast and firm as the great Tors upon our native moorlands,
true as the sun in the heavens.</p>

<p>The name of our village was Chadleigh. Lifted high above the
pasture flats which stretched away at our feet like a measureless
green lake and melted into mist on the furthest horizon, it nestled,
a tiny stone-built hamlet, in a sheltered hollow about midway between
the plain and the plateau. Above us, rising ridge beyond ridge, slope
beyond slope, spread the mountainous moor-country, bare and bleak for
the most part, with here and there a patch of cultivated field or
hardy plantation, and crowned highest of all with masses of huge grey
crag, abrupt, isolated, hoary, and older than the deluge. These were
the Tors--Druids' Tor, King's Tor, Castle Tor, and the like; sacred
places, as I have heard, in the ancient time, where crownings,
burnings, human sacrifices, and all kinds of bloody heathen rites
were performed. Bones, too, had been found there, and arrow-heads,
and ornaments of gold and glass. I had a vague awe of the Tors in
those boyish days, and would not have gone near them after dark for
the heaviest bribe.</p>

<p>I have said that we were born in the same village. He was the son
of a small farmer, named William Price, and the eldest of a family of
seven; I was the only child of Ephraim Hardy, the Chadleigh
blacksmith--a well-known man in those parts, whose memory is not
forgotten to this day. Just so far as a farmer is supposed to be a
bigger man than a blacksmith, Mat's father might be said to have a
better standing than mine; but William Price with his small holding
and his seven boys, was, in fact, as poor as many a day-labourer;
whilst, the blacksmith, well-to-do, bustling, popular, and
open-handed, was a person of some importance in the place. All this,
however, had nothing to do with Mat and myself. It never occurred to
either of us that his jacket was out at elbows, or that our mutual
funds came altogether from my pocket. It was enough for us that we
sat on the same school-bench, conned our tasks from the same primer,
fought each other's battles, screened each other's faults, fished,
nutted, played truant, robbed orchards and birds' nests together, and
spent every half-hour, authorised or stolen, in each other's society.
It was a happy time; but it could not go on for ever. My father,
being prosperous, resolved to put me forward in the world. I must
know more, and do better, than himself. The forge was not good
enough, the little world of Chadleigh not wide enough, for me. Thus
it happened that I was still swinging the satchel when Mat was
whistling at the plough, and that at last, when my future course was
shaped out, we were separated, as it then seemed to us, for life.
For, blacksmith's son as I was, furnace and forge, in some form or
other, pleased me best, and I chose to be a working engineer. So my
father by-and-by apprenticed me to a Birmingham iron-master; and,
having bidden farewell to Mat, and Chadleigh, and the grey old Tors
in the shadow of which I had spent all the days of my life, I turned
my face northward, and went over into "the Black Country."</p>

<p>I am not going to dwell on this part of my story. How I worked out
the term of my apprenticeship; how, when I had served my full time
and become a skilled workman, I took Mat from the plough and brought
him over to the Black Country, sharing with him lodging, wages,
experience--all, in short, that I had to give; how he, naturally
quick to learn and brimful of quiet energy, worked his way up a step
at a time, and came by-and-by to be a "first hand" in his own
department; how, during all these years of change, and trial, and
effort, the old boyish affection never wavered or weakened, but went
on, growing with our growth and strengthening with our strength--are
facts which I need do no more than outline in this place.</p>

<p>About this time--it will be remembered that I speak of the days
when Mat and I were on the bright side of thirty--it happened that
our firm contracted to supply six first-class locomotives to run on
the new line, then in process of construction, between Turin and
Genoa. It was the first Italian order we had taken. We had had
dealings with France, Holland, Belgium, Germany; but never with
Italy. The connection, therefore, was new and valuable--all the more
valuable because our Transalpine neighbours had but lately begun to
lay down the iron roads, and would be safe to need more of our good
English work as they went on. So the Birmingham firm set themselves
to the contract with a will, lengthened our working hours, increased
our wages, took on fresh hands, and determined, if energy and
promptitude could do it, to place themselves at the head of the
Italian labour-market, and stay there. They deserved and achieved
success. The six locomotives were not only turned out to time, but
were shipped, despatched, and delivered with a promptitude that
fairly amazed our Piedmontese consignee. I was not a little proud,
you may be sure, when I found myself appointed to superintend the
transport of the engines. Being allowed a couple of assistants, I
contrived that Mat should be one of them; and thus we enjoyed
together the first great holiday of our lives.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful change for two Birmingham operatives fresh from
the Black Country. The fairy city, with its crescent background of
Alps; the port crowded with strange shipping; the marvellous blue sky
and the bluer sea; the painted houses on the quays; the quaint
cathedral, faced with black and white marble; the street of
jewellers, like an Arabian Nights' bazaar; the street of palaces,
with its Moorish courtyards, its fountains and orange-trees; the
women veiled like brides; the galley-slaves chained two and two; the
processions of priests and friars; the everlasting clangour of bells;
the babble of a strange tongue; the singular lightness and brightness
of the climate--made, altogether, such a combination of wonders that
we wandered about, the first day, in a kind of bewildered dream, like
children at a fair. Before that week was ended, being tempted by the
beauty of the place and the liberality of the pay, we had agreed to
take service with the Turin and Genoa Railway Company, and to turn
our backs upon Birmingham for ever.</p>

<p>Then began a new life--a life so active and healthy, so steeped in
fresh air and sunshine, that we sometimes marvelled how we could have
endured the gloom of the Black Country. We were constantly up and
down the line: now at Genoa, now at Turin, taking trial trips with
the locomotives, and placing our old experiences at the service of
our new employers.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile we made Genoa our headquarters, and hired a
couple of rooms over a small shop in a by-street sloping down to the
quays. Such a busy little street--so steep and winding that no
vehicles could pass through it, and so narrow that the sky looked
like a mere strip of deep-blue ribbon overhead! Every house in it,
however, was a shop, where the goods encroached on the footway, or
were piled about the door, or hung like tapestry from the balconies;
and all day long, from dawn to dusk, an incessant stream of
passers-by poured up and down between the port and the upper quarter
of the city.</p>

<p>Our landlady was the widow of a silver-worker, and lived by the
sale of filigree ornaments, cheap jewellery, combs, fans, and toys in
ivory and jet. She had an only daughter named Gianetta, who served in
the shop, and was simply the most beautiful woman I ever beheld.
Looking back across this weary chasm of years, and bringing her image
before me (as I can and do) with all the vividness of life, I am
unable, even now, to detect a flaw in her beauty. I do not attempt to
describe her. I do not believe there is a poet living who could find
the words to do it; but I once saw a picture that was somewhat like
her (not half so lovely, but still like her), and, for aught I know,
that picture is still hanging where I last looked at it--upon the
walls of the Louvre. It represented a woman with brown eyes and
golden hair, looking over her shoulder into a circular mirror held by
a bearded man in the background. In this man, as I then understood,
the artist had painted his own portrait; in her, the portrait of the
woman he loved. No picture that I ever saw was half so beautiful, and
yet it was not worthy to be named in the same breath with Gianetta
Coneglia.</p>

<p>You may be certain the widow's shop did not want for customers.
All Genoa knew how fair a face was to be seen behind that dingy
little counter; and Gianetta, flirt as she was, had more lovers than
she cared to remember, even by name. Gentle and simple, rich and
poor, from the red-capped sailor buying his ear-rings or his amulet,
to the nobleman carelessly purchasing half the filigrees in the
window, she treated them all alike--encouraged them, laughed at them,
led them on and turned them off at her pleasure. She had no more
heart than a marble statue; as Mat and I discovered by-and-by, to our
bitter cost.</p>

<p>I cannot tell to this day how it came about, or what first led me
to suspect how things were going with us both; but long before the
waning of that autumn a coldness had sprung up between my friend and
myself. It was nothing that could have been put into words. It was
nothing that either of us could have explained or justified, to save
his life. We lodged together, ate together, worked together, exactly
as before; we even took our long evening's walk together, when the
day's labour was ended; and except, perhaps, that we were more silent
than of old, no mere looker-on could have detected a shadow of
change. Yet there it was, silent and subtle, widening the gulf
between us every day.</p>

<p>It was not his fault. He was too true and gentle-hearted to have
willingly brought about such a state of things between us. Neither do
I believe--fiery as my nature is--that it was mine. It was all
hers--hers from first to last--the sin, and the shame, and the
sorrow.</p>

<p>If she had shown a fair and open preference for either of us, no
real harm could have come of it. I would have put any constraint upon
myself, and, Heaven knows! have borne any suffering, to see Mat
really happy. I know that he would have done the same, and more if he
could, for me. But Gianetta cared not one sou for either. She never
meant to choose between us. It gratified her vanity to divide us; it
amused her to play with us. It would pass my power to tell how, by a
thousand imperceptible shades of coquetry--by the lingering of a
glance, the substitution of a word, the flitting of a smile--she
contrived to turn our heads, and torture our hearts, and lead us on
to love her. She deceived us both. She buoyed us both up with hope;
she maddened us with jealousy; she crushed us with despair. For my
part, when I seemed to wake to a sudden sense of the ruin that was
about our path and I saw how the truest friendship that ever bound
two lives together was drifting on to wreck and ruin, I asked myself
whether any woman in the world was worth what Mat had been to me and
I to him. But this was not often. I was readier to shut my eyes upon
the truth than to face it; and so lived on, wilfully, in a dream.</p>

<p>Thus the autumn passed away, and winter came--the strange,
treacherous Genoese winter, green with olive and ilex, brilliant with
sunshine, and bitter with storm. Still, rivals at heart and friends
on the surface, Mat and I lingered on in our lodging in the Vicolo
Balba. Still Gianetta held us with her fatal wiles and her still more
fatal beauty. At length there came a day when I felt I could bear the
horrible misery and suspense of it no longer. The sun, I vowed,
should not go down before I knew my sentence. She must choose between
us. She must either take me or let me go. I was reckless. I was
desperate. I was determined to know the worst, or the best. If the
worst, I would at once turn my back upon Genoa, upon her, upon all
the pursuits and purposes of my past life, and begin the world anew.
This I told her, passionately and sternly, standing before her in the
little parlour at the back of the shop, one bleak December
morning.</p>

<p>"If it's Mat whom you care for most," I said, "tell me so in one
word, and I will never trouble you again. He is better worth your
love. I am jealous and exacting; he is as trusting and unselfish as a
woman. Speak, Gianetta; am I to bid you good-bye for ever and ever,
or am I to write home to my mother in England, bidding her pray to
God to bless the woman who has promised to be my wife?"</p>

<p>"You plead your friend's cause well," she replied, haughtily.
"Matteo ought to be grateful. This is more than he ever did for
you."</p>

<p>"Give me my answer, for pity's sake," I exclaimed, "and let me
go!"</p>

<p>"You are free to go or stay, Signor Inglese," she replied. "I am
not your jailor."</p>

<p>"Do you bid me leave you?"</p>

<p>"Beata Madre! not I."</p>

<p>"Will you marry me, if I stay?"</p>

<p>She laughed aloud--such a merry, mocking, musical laugh, like a
chime of silver bells!</p>

<p>"You ask too much," she said.</p>

<p>"Only what you have led me to hope these five or six months
past!"</p>

<p>"That is just what Matteo says. How tiresome you both are!"</p>

<p>"O, Gianetta," I said, passionately, "be serious for one moment! I
am a rough fellow, it is true--not half good enough or clever enough
for you; but I love you with my whole heart, and an Emperor could do
no more."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," she replied; "I do not want you to love me
less."</p>

<p>"Then you cannot wish to make me wretched! Will you promise
me?"</p>

<p>"I promise nothing," said she, with another burst of laughter;
"except that I will not marry Matteo!"</p>

<p>Except that she would not marry Matteo! Only that. Not a word of
hope for myself. Nothing but my friend's condemnation. I might get
comfort, and selfish triumph, and some sort of base assurance out of
that, if I could. And so, to my shame, I did. I grasped at the vain
encouragement, and, fool that I was! let her put me off again
unanswered. From that day, I gave up all effort at self-control, and
let myself drift blindly on--to destruction.</p>

<p>At length things became so bad between Mat and myself that it
seemed as if an open rupture must be at hand. We avoided each other,
scarcely exchanged a dozen sentences in a day, and fell away from all
our old familiar habits. At this time--I shudder to remember
it!--there were moments when I felt that I hated him.</p>

<p>Thus, with the trouble deepening and widening between us day by
day, another month or five weeks went by; and February came; and,
with February, the Carnival. They said in Genoa that it was a
particularly dull carnival; and so it must have been; for, save a
flag or two hung out in some of the principal streets, and a sort of
festa look about the women, there were no special indications of the
season. It was, I think, the second day when, having been on the line
all the morning, I returned to Genoa at dusk, and, to my surprise,
found Mat Price on the platform. He came up to me, and laid his hand
on my arm.</p>

<p>"You are in late," he said. "I have been waiting for you
three-quarters of an hour. Shall we dine together to-day?"</p>

<p>Impulsive as I am, this evidence of returning goodwill at once
called up my better feelings.</p>

<p>"With all my heart, Mat," I replied; "shall we go to
Gozzoli's?"</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, hurriedly. "Some quieter place--some place
where we can talk. I have something to say to you."</p>

<p>I noticed now that he looked pale and agitated, and an uneasy
sense of apprehension stole upon me. We decided on the "Pescatore," a
little out-of-the-way trattoria, down near the Molo Vecchio. There,
in a dingy salon, frequented chiefly by seamen, and redolent of
tobacco, we ordered our simple dinner. Mat scarcely swallowed a
morsel; but, calling presently for a bottle of Sicilian wine, drank
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, Mat," I said, as the last dish was placed on the table,
"what news have you?"</p>

<p>"Bad."</p>

<p>"I guessed that from your face."</p>

<p>"Bad for you--bad for me. Gianetta."</p>

<p>"What of Gianetta?"</p>

<p>He passed his hand nervously across his lips.</p>

<p>"Gianetta is false--worse than false," he said, in a hoarse voice.
"She values an honest man's heart just as she values a flower for her
hair--wears it for a day, then throws it aside for ever. She has
cruelly wronged us both."</p>

<p>"In what way? Good Heavens, speak out!"</p>

<p>"In the worst way that a woman can wrong those who love her. She
has sold herself to the Marchese Loredano."</p>

<p>The blood rushed to my head and face in a burning torrent. I could
scarcely see, and dared not trust myself to speak.</p>

<p>"I saw her going towards the cathedral," he went on, hurriedly.
"It was about three hours ago. I thought she might be going to
confession, so I hung back and followed her at a distance. When she
got inside, however, she went straight to the back of the pulpit,
where this man was waiting for her. You remember him--an old man who
used to haunt the shop a month or two back. Well, seeing how deep in
conversation they were, and how they stood close under the pulpit
with their backs towards the church, I fell into a passion of anger
and went straight up the aisle, intending to say or do something: I
scarcely knew what; but, at all events, to draw her arm through mine,
and take her home. When I came within a few feet, however, and found
only a big pillar between myself and them, I paused. They could not
see me, nor I them; but I could hear their voices distinctly,
and--and I listened."</p>

<p>"Well, and you heard--"</p>

<p>"The terms of a shameful bargain--beauty on the one side, gold on
the other; so many thousand francs a year; a villa near
Naples----Pah! it makes me sick to repeat it."</p>

<p>And, with a shudder, he poured out another glass of wine and drank
it at a draught.</p>

<p>"After that," he said, presently, "I made no effort to bring her
away. The whole thing was so cold-blooded, so deliberate, so
shameful, that I felt I had only to wipe her out of my memory, and
leave her to her fate. I stole out of the cathedral, and walked about
here by the sea for ever so long, trying to get my thoughts straight.
Then I remembered you, Ben; and the recollection of how this wanton
had come between us and broken up our lives drove me wild. So I went
up to the station and waited for you. I felt you ought to know it
all; and--and I thought, perhaps, that we might go back to England
together."</p>

<p>"The Marchese Loredano!"</p>

<p>It was all that I could say; all that I could think. As Mat had
just said of himself, I felt "like one stunned."</p>

<p>"There is one other thing I may as well tell you," he added,
reluctantly, "if only to show you how false a woman can be. We--we
were to have been married next month."</p>

<p>"We? Who? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that we were to have been married--Gianetta and I."</p>

<p>A sudden storm of rage, of scorn, of incredulity, swept over me at
this, and seemed to carry my senses away.</p>

<p>"You!" I cried. "Gianetta marry you! I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"I wish I had not believed it," he replied, looking up as if
puzzled by my vehemence. "But she promised me; and I thought, when
she promised it, she meant it."</p>

<p>"She told me, weeks ago, that she would never be your wife!"</p>

<p>His colour rose, his brow darkened; but when his answer came, it
was as calm as the last.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" he said. "Then it is only one baseness more. She told me
that she had refused you; and that was why we kept our engagement
secret."</p>

<p>"Tell the truth, Mat Price," I said, well-nigh beside myself with
suspicion. "Confess that every word of this is false! Confess that
Gianetta will not listen to you, and that you are afraid I may
succeed where you have failed. As perhaps I shall--as perhaps I
shall, after all!"</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" he exclaimed. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That I believe it's just a trick to get me away to England--that
I don't credit a syllable of your story. You're a liar, and I hate
you!"</p>

<p>He rose, and, laying one hand on the back of his chair, looked me
sternly in the face.</p>

<p>"If you were not Benjamin Hardy," he said, deliberately, "I would
thrash you within an inch of your life."</p>

<p>The words had no sooner passed his lips than I sprang at him. I
have never been able distinctly to remember what followed. A curse--a
blow--a struggle--a moment of blind fury--a cry--a confusion of
tongues--a circle of strange faces. Then I see Mat lying back in the
arms of a bystander; myself trembling and bewildered--the knife
dropping from my grasp; blood upon the floor; blood upon my hands;
blood upon his shirt. And then I hear those dreadful words:</p>

<p>"O, Ben, you have murdered me!"</p>

<p>He did not die--at least, not there and then. He was carried to
the nearest hospital, and lay for some weeks between life and death.
His case, they said, was difficult and dangerous. The knife had gone
in just below the collar-bone, and pierced down into the lungs. He
was not allowed to speak or turn--scarcely to breathe with freedom.
He might not even lift his head to drink. I sat by him day and night
all through that sorrowful time. I gave up my situation on the
railway; I quitted my lodging in the Vicolo Balba; I tried to forget
that such a woman as Gianetta Coneglia had ever drawn breath. I lived
only for Mat; and he tried to live more, I believe, for my sake than
his own. Thus, in the bitter silent hours of pain and penitence, when
no hand but mine approached his lips or smoothed his pillow, the old
friendship came back with even more than its old trust and
faithfulness. He forgave me, fully and freely; and I would thankfully
have given my life for him.</p>

<p>At length there came one bright spring morning, when, dismissed as
convalescent, he tottered out through the hospital gates, leaning on
my arm, and feeble as an infant. He was not cured; neither, as I then
learned to my horror and anguish, was it possible that he ever could
be cured. He might live, with care, for some years; but the lungs
were injured beyond hope of remedy, and a strong or healthy man he
could never be again. These, spoken aside to me, were the parting
words of the chief physician, who advised me to take him further
south without delay.</p>

<p>I took him to a little coast-town called Rocca, some thirty miles
beyond Genoa--a sheltered lonely place along the Riviera, where the
sea was even bluer than the sky, and the cliffs were green with
strange tropical plants, cacti, and aloes, and Egyptian palms. Here
we lodged in the house of a small tradesman; and Mat, to use his own
words, "set to work at getting well in good earnest." But, alas! it
was a work which no earnestness could forward. Day after day he went
down to the beach, and sat for hours drinking the sea air and
watching the sails that came and went in the offing. By-and-by he
could go no further than the garden of the house in which we lived. A
little later, and he spent his days on a couch beside the open
window, waiting patiently for the end. Ay, for the end! It had come
to that. He was fading fast, waning with the waning summer, and
conscious that the Reaper was at hand. His whole aim now was to
soften the agony of my remorse, and prepare me for what must shortly
come.</p>

<p>"I would not live longer, if I could," he said, lying on his couch
one summer evening, and looking up to the stars. "If I had my choice
at this moment, I would ask to go. I should like Gianetta to know
that I forgave her."</p>

<p>"She shall know it," I said, trembling suddenly from head to
foot.</p>

<p>He pressed my hand.</p>

<p>"And you'll write to father?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>I had drawn a little back, that he might not see the tears raining
down my cheeks; but he raised himself on his elbow, and looked
round.</p>

<p>"Don't fret, Ben," he whispered; laid his head back wearily upon
the pillow--and so died.</p>

<p>And this was the end of it. This was the end of all that made life
life to me. I buried him there, in hearing of the wash of a strange
sea on a strange shore. I stayed by the grave till the priest and the
bystanders were gone. I saw the earth filled in to the last sod, and
the gravedigger stamped it down with his feet. Then, and not till
then, I felt that I had lost him for ever--the friend I had loved,
and hated, and slain. Then, and not till then, I knew that all rest,
and joy, and hope were over for me. From that moment my heart
hardened within me, and my life was filled with loathing. Day and
night, land and sea, labour and rest, food and sleep, were alike
hateful to me. It was the curse of Cain, and that my brother had
pardoned me made it lie none the lighter. Peace on earth was for me
no more, and goodwill towards men was dead in my heart for ever.
Remorse softens some natures; but it poisoned mine. I hated all
mankind; but above all mankind I hated the woman who had come between
us two, and ruined both our lives.</p>

<p>He had bidden me seek her out, and be the messenger of his
forgiveness. I had sooner have gone down to the port of Genoa and
taken upon me the serge cap and shotted chain of any galley-slave at
his toil in the public works; but for all that I did my best to obey
him. I went back, alone and on foot. I went back, intending to say to
her, "Gianetta Coneglia, he forgave you; but God never will." But she
was gone. The little shop was let to a fresh occupant; and the
neighbours only knew that mother and daughter had left the place
quite suddenly, and that Gianetta was supposed to be under the
"protection" of the Marchese Loredano. How I made inquiries here and
there--how I heard that they had gone to Naples--and how, being
restless and reckless of my time, I worked my passage in a French
steamer, and followed her--how, having found the sumptuous villa that
was now hers, I learned that she had left there some ten days and
gone to Paris, where the Marchese was ambassador for the Two
Sicilies--how, working my passage back again to Marseilles, and
thence, in part by the river and in part by the rail, I made my way
to Paris--how, day after day, I paced the streets and the parks,
watched at the ambassador's gates, followed his carriage, and at
last, after weeks of waiting, discovered her address--how, having
written to request an interview, her servants spurned me from her
door and flung my letter in my face--how, looking up at her windows,
I then, instead of forgiving, solemnly cursed her with the bitterest
curses my tongue could devise--and how, this done, I shook the dust
of Paris from my feet, and became a wanderer upon the face of the
earth, are facts which I have now no space to tell.</p>

<p>The next six or eight years of my life were shifting and unsettled
enough. A morose and restless man, I took employment here and there,
as opportunity offered, turning my hand to many things, and caring
little what I earned, so long as the work was hard and the change
incessant. First of all I engaged myself as chief engineer in one of
the French steamers plying between Marseilles and Constantinople. At
Constantinople I changed to one of the Austrian Lloyd's boats, and
worked for some time to and from Alexandria, Jaffa, and those parts
After that, I fell in with a party of Mr. Layard's men at Cairo, and
so went up the Nile and took a turn at the excavations of the mound
of Nimroud. Then I became a working engineer on the new desert line
between Alexandria and Suez; and by-and-by I worked my passage out to
Bombay, and took service as an engine fitter on one of the great
Indian railways. I stayed a long time in India; that is to say, I
stayed nearly two years, which was a long time for me; and I might
not even have left so soon, but for the war that was declared just
then with Russia. That tempted me. For I loved danger and hardship as
other men love safety and ease; and as for my life, I had sooner have
parted from it than kept it, any day. So I came straight back to
England; betook myself to Portsmouth, where my testimonials at once
procured me the sort of berth I wanted. I went out to the Crimea in
the engine-room of one of her Majesty's war steamers.</p>

<p>I served with the fleet, of course, while the war lasted; and when
it was over, went wandering off again, rejoicing in my liberty. This
time I went to Canada, and after working on a railway then in
progress near the American frontier. I presently passed over into the
States; journeyed from north to south; crossed the Rocky Mountains;
tried a month or two of life in the gold country; and then, being
seized with a sudden, aching, unaccountable longing to revisit that
solitary grave so far away on the Italian coast, I turned my face
once more towards Europe.</p>

<p>Poor little grave! I found it rank with weeds, the cross half
shattered, the inscription half effaced. It was as if no one had
loved him, or remembered him. I went back to the house in which we
had lodged together. The same people were still living there, and
made me kindly welcome. I stayed with them for some weeks. I weeded,
and planted, and trimmed the grave with my own hands, and set up a
fresh cross in pure white marble. It was the first season of rest
that I had known since I laid him there; and when at last I
shouldered my knapsack and set forth again to battle with the world,
I promised myself that, God willing, I would creep back to Rocca,
when my days drew near to ending, and be buried by his side.</p>

<p>From hence, being, perhaps, a little less inclined than formerly
for very distant parts, and willing to keep within reach of that
grave, I went no further than Mantua, where I engaged myself as an
engine-driver on the line, then not long completed, between that city
and Venice. Somehow, although I had been trained to the working
engineering, I preferred in these days to earn my bread by driving. I
liked the excitement of it, the sense of power, the rush of the air,
the roar of the fire, the flitting of the landscape. Above all, I
enjoyed to drive a night express. The worse the weather, the better
it suited with my sullen temper. For I was as hard, and harder than
ever. The years had done nothing to soften me. They had only
confirmed all that was blackest and bitterest in my heart.</p>

<p>I continued pretty faithful to the Mantua line, and had been
working on it steadily for more than seven months when that which I
am now about to relate took place.</p>

<p>It was in the month of March. The weather had been unsettled for
some days past, and the nights stormy; and at one point along the
line, near Ponte di Brenta, the waters had risen and swept away some
seventy yards of embankment. Since this accident, the trains had all
been obliged to stop at a certain spot between Padua and Ponte di
Brenta, and the passengers, with their luggage, had thence to be
transported in all kinds of vehicles, by a circuitous country road,
to the nearest station on the other side of the gap, where another
train and engine awaited them. This, of course, caused great
confusion and annoyance, put all our time-tables wrong, and subjected
the public to a large amount of inconvenience. In the mean while an
army of navvies was drafted to the spot, and worked day and night to
repair the damage. At this time I was driving two through trains each
day; namely, one from Mantua to Venice in the early morning, and a
return train from Venice to Mantua in the afternoon--a tolerably full
days' work, covering about one hundred and ninety miles of ground,
and occupying between ten and eleven hours. I was therefore not best
pleased when, on the third or fourth day after the accident, I was
informed that, in addition to my regular allowance of work, I should
that evening be required to drive a special train to Venice. This
special train, consisting of an engine, a single carriage, and a
break-van, was to leave the Mantua platform at eleven; at Padua the
passengers were to alight and find post-chaises waiting to convey
them to Ponte di Brenta; at Ponte di Brenta another engine, carriage,
and break-van were to be in readiness, I was charged to accompany
them throughout.</p>

<p>"Corpo di Bacco," said the clerk who gave me my orders, "you need
not look so black, man. You are certain of a handsome gratuity. Do
you know who goes with you?"</p>

<p>"Not I."</p>

<p>"Not you, indeed! Why, it's the Duca Loredano, the Neapolitan
ambassador."</p>

<p>"Loredano!" I stammered. "What Loredano? There was a
Marchese--"</p>

<p>"Certo. He was the Marchese Loredano some years ago; but he has
come into his dukedom since then."</p>

<p>"He must be a very old man by this time."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is old; but what of that? He is as hale, and bright, and
stately as ever. You have seen him before?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, turning away; "I have seen him--years ago."</p>

<p>"You have heard of his marriage?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>The clerk chuckled, rubbed his hands, and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"An extraordinary affair," he said. "Made a tremendous esclandre
at the time. He married his mistress--quite a common, vulgar girl--a
Genoese--very handsome; but not received, of course. Nobody visits
her."</p>

<p>"Married her!" I exclaimed. "Impossible."</p>

<p>"True, I assure you."</p>

<p>I put my hand to my head. I felt as if I had had a fall or a
blow.</p>

<p>"Does she--does she go to-night?" I faltered.</p>

<p>"O dear, yes--goes everywhere with him--never lets him out of her
sight. You'll see her--la bella Duchessa!"</p>

<p>With this my informant laughed, and rubbed his hands again, and
went back to his office.</p>

<p>The day went by, I scarcely know how, except that my whole soul
was in a tumult of rage and bitterness. I returned from my
afternoon's work about 7.25, and at 10.30 I was once again at the
station. I had examined the engine; given instructions to the
Fochista, or stoker, about the fire; seen to the supply of oil; and
got all in readiness, when, just as I was about to compare my watch
with the clock in the ticket-office, a hand was laid upon my arm, and
a voice in my ear said:</p>

<p>"Are you the engine-driver who is going on with this special
train?"</p>

<p>I had never seen the speaker before. He was a small, dark man,
muffled up about the throat, with blue glasses, a large black beard,
and his hat drawn low upon his eyes.</p>

<p>"You are a poor man, I suppose," he said, in a quick, eager
whisper, "and, like other poor men, would not object to be better
off. Would you like to earn a couple of thousand florins?"</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Hush! You are to stop at Padua, are you not, and to go on again
at Ponte di Brenta?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"Suppose you did nothing of the kind. Suppose, instead of turning
off the steam, you jump off the engine, and let the train run
on?"</p>

<p>"Impossible. There are seventy yards of embankment gone,
and--"</p>

<p>"Basta! I know that. Save yourself, and let the train run on. It
would be nothing but an accident."</p>

<p>I turned hot and cold; I trembled; my heart beat fast, and my
breath failed.</p>

<p>"Why do you tempt me?" I faltered.</p>

<p>"For Italy's sake," he whispered; "for liberty's sake. I know you
are no Italian; but, for all that, you may be a friend. This Loredano
is one of his country's bitterest enemies. Stay, here are the two
thousand florins."</p>

<p>I thrust his hand back fiercely.</p>

<p>"No--no," I said. "No blood-money. If I do it, I do it neither for
Italy nor for money; but for vengeance."</p>

<p>"For vengeance!" he repeated.</p>

<p>At this moment the signal was given for backing up to the
platform. I sprang to my place upon the engine without another word.
When I again looked towards the spot where he had been standing, the
stranger was gone.</p>

<p>I saw them take their places--Duke and Duchess, secretary and
priest, valet and maid. I saw the station-master bow them into the
carriage, and stand, bareheaded, beside the door. I could not
distinguish their faces; the platform was too dusk, and the glare
from the engine fire too strong; but I recognised her stately figure,
and the poise of her head. Had I not been told who she was, I should
have known her by those traits alone. Then the guard's whistle
shrilled out, and the station-master made his last bow; I turned the
steam on; and we started.</p>

<p>My blood was on fire. I no longer trembled or hesitated. I felt as
if every nerve was iron, and every pulse instinct with deadly
purpose. She was in my power, and I would be avenged. She should
die--she, for whom I had stained my soul with my friend's blood! She
should die, in the plenitude of her wealth and her beauty, and no
power upon earth should save her!</p>

<p>The stations flew past. I put on more steam; I bade the fireman
heap in the coke, and stir the blazing mass. I would have outstripped
the wind, had it been possible. Faster and faster--hedges and trees,
bridges, and stations, flashing past--villages no sooner seen than
gone--telegraph wires twisting, and dipping, and twining themselves
in one, with the awful swiftness of our pace! Faster and faster, till
the fireman at my side looks white and scared, and refuses to add
more fuel to the furnace. Faster and faster, till the wind rushes in
our faces and drives the breath back upon our lips.</p>

<p>I would have scorned to save myself. I meant to die with the rest.
Mad as I was--and I believe from my very soul that I was utterly mad
for the time--I felt a passing pang of pity for the old man and his
suite. I would have spared the poor fellow at my side, too, if I
could; but the pace at which we were going made escape
impossible.</p>

<p>Vicenza was passed--a mere confused vision of lights. Pojana flew
by. At Padua, but nine miles distant, our passengers were to alight.
I saw the fireman's face turned upon me in remonstrance; I saw his
lips move, though I could not hear a word; I saw his expression
change suddenly from remonstrance to a deadly terror, and
then--merciful Heaven! then, for the first time, I saw that he and I
were no longer alone upon the engine.</p>

<p>There was a third man--a third man standing on my right hand, as
the fireman was standing on my left--a tall, stalwart man, with short
curling hair, and a flat Scotch cap upon his head. As I fell back in
the first shock of surprise, he stepped nearer; took my place at the
engine, and turned the steam off. I opened my lips to speak to him;
he turned his head slowly, and looked me in the face.</p>

<p>Matthew Price!</p>

<p>I uttered one long wild cry, flung my arms wildly up above my
head, and fell as if I had been smitten with an axe.</p>

<p>I am prepared for the objections that may be made to my story. I
expect, as a matter of course, to be told that this was an optical
illusion, or that I was suffering from pressure on the brain, or even
that I laboured under an attack of temporary insanity. I have heard
all these arguments before, and, if I may be forgiven for saying so,
I have no desire to hear them again. My own mind has been made up
upon this subject for many a year. All that I can say--all that I
know is--that Matthew Price came back from the dead, to save my soul
and the lives of those whom I, in my guilty rage, would have hurried
to destruction. I believe this as I believe in the mercy of Heaven
and the forgiveness of repentant sinners.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3"></a>A Service of Danger</h2>

<p>I, FREDERICK GEORGE BYNG, who write this narrative with my own
hand, without help of spectacles, am so old a man that I doubt if I
now have a hundred living contemporaries in Europe. I was born in
1780, and I am eighty-nine years of age. My reminiscences date so far
back that I almost feel, when I speak of them, as if I belonged to
another world. I remember when news first reached England of the
taking of the Bastille in 1789. I remember when people, meeting each
other in the streets, talked of Danton and Robespierre, and the last
victims of the guillotine. I remember how our whole household was put
into black for the execution of Louis XVI., and how my mother who was
a devout Roman Catholic, converted her oratory for several days into
a chapelle ardente. That was in 1793, when I was just thirteen years
of age.</p>

<p>Three years later, when the name of General Bonaparte was fast
becoming a word of power in European history, I went abroad, and
influenced by considerations which have nothing to do with my story,
entered the Austrian army.</p>

<p>A younger son of a younger branch of an ancient and noble house,
and distantly connected, moreover, with more than one great Austrian
family, I presented myself at the Court of Vienna under peculiarly
favourable auspices. The Archduke Charles, to whom I brought letters
of recommendation, accorded me a gracious welcome, and presented me
almost immediately upon my arrival with a commission in a cavalry
corps commanded by a certain Colonel von Beust, than whom a more
unpopular officer did not serve in the Imperial army.</p>

<p>Hence, I was glad to exchange, some months later, into
Lichtenstein's Cuirassiers. In this famous corps which was commanded
by his uncle the Prince of Lichtenstein, my far-off cousin, Gustav
von Lichtenstein, had lately been promoted to a troop. Serving in the
same corps, sharing the same hardships, incurring the same dangers,
we soon became sworn friends and comrades. Together we went through
the disastrous campaign of 1797, and together enjoyed the brief
interval of peace that followed upon the treaty of Campo Formio and
the cession of Venice. Having succeeded in getting our leave of
absence at the same time, we then travelled through Styria and
Hungary. Our tour ended, we came back together to winter quarters in
Vienna.</p>

<p>When hostilities were renewed in 1800, we joyfully prepared to
join the army of the Inn. In peace or war, at home or abroad, we two
held fast by each other. Let the world go round as it might, we at
least took life gaily, accepted events as they came, and went on
becoming truer and stauncher friends with every passing day. Never
were two men better suited. We understood each other perfectly. We
were nearly of the same age; we enjoyed the same sports, read the
same books, and liked the same people. Above all, we were both
passionately desirous of military glory, and we both hated the
French.</p>

<p>Gustav von Lichtenstein, however, was in many respects, both
physically and mentally, my superior. He was taller than myself, a
finer horseman, a swifter runner, a bolder swimmer, a more graceful
dancer. He was unequivocally better-looking; and having to great
natural gifts superadded a brilliant University career at both
G&ouml;ttingen and Leipzig, he was as unequivocally better educated.
Fair-haired, blue-eyed, athletic--half dreamer and poet, half
sportsman and soldier--now lost in mists of speculative
philosophy--now given up with keen enthusiasm to military
studies--the idol of his soldiers--the beau sabreur of his
corps--Gustav von Lichtenstein was then, and has ever since remained,
my ideal of a true and noble gentleman. An orphan since his early
childhood, he owned large estates in Franconia, and was, moreover,
his uncle's sole heir. He was just twenty when I first came to know
him personally in Vienna in 1796; but his character was already
formed, and he looked at least four years older than his age. When I
say that he was even then, in accordance with a family arrangement of
long standing, betrothed to his cousin, Constance von Adelheim, a
rich and beautiful Franconian heiress, I think I shall have told all
that need be told of my friend's private history.</p>

<p>I have said that we were rejoiced by the renewal of hostilities in
1800; and we had good reason to rejoice, he as an Austrian, I as an
Englishman; for the French were our bitterest enemies, and we were
burning to wipe out the memory of Marengo. It was in the month of
November that Gustav and I received orders to join our regiment; and,
commanded by Prince Lichtenstein in person, we at once proceeded, in
great haste and very inclement weather, to fall in with the main body
of the Imperial forces near Landshut on the Inn. The French, under
Moreau, came up from the direction of Ampfing and M&uuml;hldorf;
while the Austrians, sixty thousand strong, under the Archduke John,
advanced upon them from Dorfen.</p>

<p>Coming upon the French by surprise in the close neighbourhood of
Ampfing on the 30th, we fell upon them while in line of march, threw
them into confusion, and put them to the rout. The next day they fell
back upon that large plateau which lies between the Isar and the Inn,
and took up their position in the forest of Hohenlinden. We ought
never to have let them so fall back. We ought never to have let them
entrench themselves in the natural fastnesses of that immense forest
which has been truly described as "a great natural stockade between
six and seven leagues long, and from a league to a league and a half
broad."</p>

<p>We had already achieved a brilliant coup, and had our General
known how to follow up his success, the whole fortune of the campaign
would in all probability have been changed. But the Archduke John,
though a young man of ability and sound military training, wanted
that boldness which comes of experience, and erred on the side of
over-caution.</p>

<p>All that day (the 2nd of December) it rained and sleeted in
torrents. An icy wind chilled us to the bone. We could not keep our
camp-fires alight. Our soldiers, however, despite the dreadful state
of the weather, were in high spirits, full of yesterday's triumph,
and longing for active work. Officers and men alike, we all
confidently expected to be on the heels of the enemy soon after
daybreak, and waited impatiently for the word of command. But we
waited in vain. At midday the Archduke summoned a council of his
generals. But the council by-and-by broke up; the afternoon wore on;
the early Winter dusk closed in; and nothing was done.</p>

<p>That night there was discontent in the camp. The officers looked
grave. The men murmured loudly, as they gathered round the sputtering
embers and tried in vain to fence off the wind and rain. By-and-by
the wind ceased blowing and the rain ceased falling, and it began to
snow.</p>

<p>At midnight, my friend and I were sitting together in our little
tent, trying to kindle some damp logs, and talking over the day's
disappointment.</p>

<p>"It is a brilliant opportunity lost," said Gustav, bitterly. "We
had separated them and thrown them into confusion; but what of that,
when we have left them this whole day to reassemble their scattered
forces and reform their broken battalions? The Archduke Charles would
never have been guilty of such an oversight. He would have gone on
forcing them back, column upon column, till soon they would have been
unable to fly before us. They would have trampled upon each other,
thrown down their arms, and been all cut to pieces or taken
prisoners."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is not yet too late," said I.</p>

<p>"Not yet too late!" he repeated. "Gott im Himmel! Not too late,
perhaps to fight hard and get the worst of the fight; but too late to
destroy the whole French army, as we should have destroyed it this
morning. But, there! of what use is it to talk? They are all safe now
in the woods of Hohenlinden."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we must rout them out of the woods of Hohenlinden, as
we routed the wild boars last Winter in Franconia," I said,
smiling.</p>

<p>But my friend shook his head.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, tearing a leaf from his pocket-book, and,
with a few bold strokes, sketching a rough plan of the plateau and
the two rivers. "The forest is pierced by only two great roads--the
road from Munich to Wasserburg, and the road from Munich to
M&uuml;hldorf. Between the roads, some running transversely, some in
parallel lines, are numbers of narrow footways, known only to the
peasants, and impassable in Winter. If the French have had recourse
to the great thoroughfares, they have passed through ere this, and
taken up their position on some good ground beyond; but if they have
thrown themselves into the forest on either side, they are either
taking refuge in thickets whence it will be impossible to dislodge
them, or they are lying in wait to fall upon our columns when we
attempt to march through."</p>

<p>I was struck by the clearness of his insight and his perfect
mastery of the situation.</p>

<p>"What a general you will make by-and-by, Lichtenstein!" I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I shall never live to be a general, my dear fellow," he replied
gloomily. "Have I not told you before now that I shall die
young?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!--a mere presentiment!"</p>

<p>"Ay--a mere presentiment; but a presentiment of which you will
some day see the fulfilment."</p>

<p>I shook my head and smiled incredulously; but Lichtenstein,
stooping over the fire, and absorbed in his own thoughts, went on,
more, as it were, to himself than to me.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I shall die before I have done anything for which
it might be worth while to have lived. I am conscious of power--I
feel there is the making of a commander in me--but what chance have
I? The times are rich in great soldiers .... Ah, if I could but once
distinguish myself--if I could but achieve one glorious deed before I
die!.... My uncle could help me if he would. He could so easily
appoint me to some service of danger; but he will not--it is in vain
to ask him. There was last year's expedition--you remember how I
implored him to let me lead the assaulting party at Mannheim. He
refused me. Von Ranke got it, and covered himself with glory! Now if
we do have a battle to-morrow"....</p>

<p>"Do you really think we shall have a battle to-morrow?" I said
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I fancy so; but who can answer for what the Archduke may do? Were
we not confident of fighting to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes--but the Prince of Lichtenstein was at the council."</p>

<p>"My uncle tells me nothing," replied Gustav, drily.</p>

<p>And then he went to the door of the tent and looked out. The snow
was still coming down in a dense drifting cloud, and notwithstanding
the heavy rains of the last few days, was already beginning to lie
upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Pleasant weather for a campaign!" said Gustav. "I vote we get a
few hours' sleep while we can."</p>

<p>And with this he wrapped himself up in his cloak and lay down
before the fire. I followed his example, and in a few moments we were
both fast asleep.</p>

<p>Next day--the memorable 3rd of December A.D. 1800--was fought the
famous battle of Hohenlinden; a day great and glorious in the annals
of French military history, yet not inglorious for those who bravely
suffered defeat and disaster.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe the conflict in detail--that has
been done by abler pens than mine. It will be enough if I briefly
tell what share we Lichtensteiners bore in the fray. The bugles
sounded to arms before daylight, and by grey dawn the whole army was
in motion. The snow was still falling heavily; but the men were in
high spirits and confident of victory.</p>

<p>Divided into three great columns--the centre commanded by the
Archduke, the right wing under Latour, and the left under Riesch--we
plunged into the forest. The infantry marched first, followed by the
artillery and caissons, and the cavalry brought up the rear. The
morning, consequently, had far advanced, and our comrades in the van
had already reached the farther extremity of the forest, when we,
with the rest of the cavalry, crossed, if I may so express it, the
threshold of those fatal woods.</p>

<p>The snow was now some fourteen inches deep upon the ground, and
still falling in such thick flakes as made it impossible to see
twenty yards ahead. The gloomy pine-trees closed round our steps in
every direction, thick-set, uniform, endless. Except the broad
chauss&eacute;e, down which the artillery was lumbering slowly and
noiselessly, no paths or side-tracks were distinguishable. Below, all
was white and dazzling; above, where the wide-spreading pine-branches
roofed out the leaden sky, all was dark and oppressive. Presently the
Prince of Lichtenstein rode up, and bade us turn aside under the
trees on either side of the road till Kollowrath's reserves had
passed on. We did so; dismounted; lit our pipes; and waited till our
turn should come to follow the rest.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without a moment's warning, as if they had sprung from
the earth, an immense body of the enemy's foot poured in upon us from
the very direction in which our left wing, under Riesch, had lately
passed along. In an instant the air was filled with shouts, and
smoke, and shots, and gleaming sabres--the snow was red with
blood--men, horses, and artillery were massed together in
inextricable confusion, and hundreds of our brave fellows were cut
down before they could even draw their swords to strike a single
blow.</p>

<p>"Call up the Bavarian reserve!" shouted the Prince, sitting his
horse like a statue and pointing up the road with his sword.</p>

<p>The next instant I was rolling under my own horse's feet, with a
murderous grip upon my throat, a pistol at my head, and in my ears a
sound like the rushing of a mighty sea. After this I remember nothing
more, till by-and-by I came to my senses, and found myself, with some
five or six wounded cuirassiers, lying in an open cart, and being
transported along a country road apparently skirting the forest. I
thought at first that I also was wounded and that we were all
prisoners, and so closed my eyes in despair.</p>

<p>But as the tide of consciousness continued to flow back, I
discovered that we were in the care of our own people, and in the
midst of a long string of ambulances bringing up the rear of the
Imperial army. And I also found that, more fortunate than my
companions, I had been stunned and badly bruised, but was otherwise
unhurt.</p>

<p>Presently Gustav came riding up, and with a cry of joy
exclaimed:--</p>

<p>"How now, lieber Freund! No broken bones? All well and safe this
time?"</p>

<p>"All well and safe," I replied; "but sore from head to foot, and
jolted almost to death. Where's my horse, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Dead, no doubt; but if you can ride, take mine, and I'll secure
the first I can get."</p>

<p>"Is the battle over?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Ay," he said, gloomily. "The battle is over--and lost."</p>

<p>"Lost!--utterly?"</p>

<p>"Utterly."</p>

<p>And then, still riding beside the cart and bending towards me as
he rode, he told, in a few bitter sentences, all he knew of the day's
disaster.</p>

<p>Moreau, the Generals Groucy and Grandjean, had, it seemed, lain in
wait with the main body of his army at the farther end of the forest,
where the great Munich and Wasserburg road debouches upon the open
plain, in order to drive our forces back as soon as the heads of the
first columns should emerge on that side; while Ney, prepared to
execute a similar manoeuvre with his division, was stationed for the
same purpose at the mouth of the other great chauss&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Richepanse, meanwhile, separated by an accident from half his
brigade, instead of retreating, advanced with great intrepidity, and
fell upon us flank and rear, as I have said, when we least expected
danger. Thus it was that the Imperial army was attacked and driven
back upon itself from three points, and defeated with great
slaughter.</p>

<p>"As for our losses," said Lichtenstein, "Heaven only knows what
they are! It seems to me that we have scarcely a gun or a
baggage-waggon left; while our men, herded together, trampled, cut
down by thousands--Herr Gott! I cannot bear to think of it."</p>

<p>That night we retired across the Inn and halted upon the Tyrolean
side, making some show of defence along the line of the river, in the
direction of Saltzburg. Our men, however, had none of the spirit of
resistance left in them. They seemed as if crushed by the magnitude
of their defeat. Hundreds deserted daily. The rest clamoured
impatiently for a retreat. The whole camp was in dismay and
disorder.</p>

<p>Suddenly, none could exactly tell how, a rumour went about that
Moreau was about to attempt the passage of the Lower Inn.</p>

<p>This rumour soon became more definite.</p>

<p>The point chosen was distant some three or four marches from that
where we were now posted.</p>

<p>All the boats upon the Isar had been seized and sent down the
river as far as Munich.</p>

<p>From Munich they were about to be transported overland to the
nearest point upon the Inn.</p>

<p>Two bridges of boats were then to be thrown across the river, and
the French battalions were to march over to our attack.</p>

<p>Such was the information which the peasantry brought to our camp,
and which was confirmed by the scouts whom we sent out in every
direction. The enemy's movements were open and undisguised. Confident
of success and secure in our weakness, he disdained even the
semblance of strategy.</p>

<p>On the 4th of December the Archduke called another council of war;
and some hours before daybreak on the morning of the 5th, our whole
right wing was despatched to the point at which we anticipated an
attack.</p>

<p>At dawn, Gustav, who had been out all night on duty, came in wet
and weary, and found me still asleep.</p>

<p>"Rouse up dreamer!" he said. "Our comrades are gone, and now we
can sing 'De Profundis' for ourselves."</p>

<p>"Why for ourselves?" I asked, raising myself upon my elbow.</p>

<p>"Because Riesch is gone; and, if I am not very much mistaken, we
shall have to fight the French without him."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Riesch is gone to repulse the threatened attack
down the river?"</p>

<p>"I mean that my mind misgives me about that attack. Moreau is not
wont to show his cards so plainly. I have been thinking about it all
night; and the more I think of it, the more I suspect that the French
have laid a trap, and the Archduke has walked into it."</p>

<p>And then, while we lit our fire and breakfasted together off our
modest rations of black bread and soup, my friend showed me, in a few
words, how unlikely it was that Moreau should conduct any important
operation in so ostentatious a fashion. His object, argued
Lichtenstein, was either to mislead us with false rumours, and then,
in the absence of Riesch's division, to pour across the river and
attack us unexpectedly, or, more probably still, it was his design to
force the passage of the Upper Inn and descend upon us from the hills
to our rear.</p>

<p>I felt a sudden conviction that he was right.</p>

<p>"It is so--it must be so!" I exclaimed. "What is to be done?"</p>

<p>"Nothing--unless to die hard when the time comes."</p>

<p>"Will you not lay your suspicions before the Archduke?"</p>

<p>"The Archduke would not thank me, perhaps, for seeing farther than
himself. Besides, suspicions are nothing. If I had proof--proof
positive .... if my uncle would but grant me a party of
reconnoissance .... By Heaven! I will ask him."</p>

<p>"Then ask him one thing more--get leave for me to go with
you!"</p>

<p>At this moment three or four drums struck up the rappel--were
answered by others--and again by others far and near, and in a few
seconds the whole camp was alive and stirring. In the meanwhile,
Lichtenstein snatched up his cap and rushed away, eager to catch the
Prince before he left his tent.</p>

<p>In about half an hour he came back, radiant with success. His
uncle had granted him a troop of twenty men, with permission to cross
the Inn and reconnoitre the enemy's movements.</p>

<p>"But he will not consent to let thee join, mein Bruder," said
Gustav, regretfully.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it is a service of danger, and he will not risk the life
of a second officer when one is enough."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! as if my life were worth anything! But there--it's just my
luck. I might have been certain he would refuse. When do you go?"</p>

<p>"At midday. We are to keep on this side following the road to
Neubevern till we find some point narrow enough to swim our horses
over. After that, we shall go round by any unfrequented ways and
bridle-paths we can find; get near the French camp as soon as it is
dusk; and find out all we can."</p>

<p>"I'd have given my black mustang to be allowed to go with
you."</p>

<p>"I don't half forgive the Prince for refusing," said Gustav. "But
then, you see, not a man of us may come back; and after all, it's
more satisfactory to get one's bullet on the open battle-field than
to be caught and shot for a spy."</p>

<p>"I should prefer to take my chance of that."</p>

<p>"I am not quite sure that I should prefer it for you," said my
friend. "I have gained my point--I am glad to go: but I have an
impression of coming disaster."</p>

<p>"Ah! you know I don't believe in presentiments."</p>

<p>"I do know it, of old. But the sons of the house of Lichtenstein
have reason to believe in them. I could tell you many a strange story
if I had time..... But it is already ten, and I must write some
letters and put my papers in order before I start."</p>

<p>With this he sat down to his desk, and I went out, in order to
leave him alone while he wrote. When I came back, his charger was
waiting outside in care of an orderly; the troop had already
assembled in an open space behind the tent; and the men were busy
tightening their horses' girths, looking to the locks of their
pistols, and gaily preparing to be gone.</p>

<p>I found Lichtenstein booted and spurred and ready. A letter and a
sealed packet lay upon the table, and he had just opened a locker to
take a slice of bread and a glass of kirschwasser before
starting.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven you are come!" he said. "In three minutes more I
should have been gone. You see this letter and packet?--I entrust
them to you. The packet contains my watch, which was my father's,
given to him by the Empress Catherine of Russia; my hereditary star
and badge as a Count of the early Roman Empire; my will; my
commission; and my signet ring. If I fall to-day, the packet is to be
given to my uncle. The letter is for Constance, bidding her farewell.
I have enclosed in it my mother's portrait and a piece of my hair.
You will forward it, lieber Freund...."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>He took a locket from his bosom, opened it, kissed it, and gave it
to me with a sigh.</p>

<p>"I would not have her portrait fall into rude and sacrilegious
hands," he said; "if I never come back, destroy it. And now for a
parting glass, and good bye!"</p>

<p>We then chinked our glasses together, drank to each other in
silence, clasped hands, and parted.</p>

<p>Away they rode through the heavy mire and beating rain, twenty
picked men, two and two, with their Captain at their head. I watched
them as they trotted leisurely down the long line of tents, and when
the last man had disappeared, I went in with a heavy heart, telling
myself that I should perhaps never see Gustav von Lichtenstein
again.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the day it continued to rain incessantly.
It was my turn that night to be on duty for five hours; to go the
round of the camp, and to visit all the outposts. I therefore made up
the best fire I could, stopped indoors, and, following my friend's
example, wrote letters all the afternoon.</p>

<p>About six in the evening the rain ceased, and it began to snow. It
was just the Hohenlinden weather over again.</p>

<p>At eight, having cooked and eaten my solitary supper, I wrapped
myself in my rug, lay down before the fire, and slept till midnight,
when the orderly came, as usual, to wake me and accompany me on my
rounds.</p>

<p>"Dreadful weather, I suppose, Fritz?" I said, getting up
unwillingly, and preparing to face the storm.</p>

<p>"No, mein Herr; it is a beautiful night."</p>

<p>I could hardly believe him.</p>

<p>But so it was. The camp lay around us, one sheet of smooth
dazzling snow; the clouds had parted, and were clearing off rapidly
in every direction; and just over the Archduke's tent where the
Imperial banner hung drooping and heavy, the full moon was rising in
splendour.</p>

<p>A magnificent night--cold, but not piercing--pleasant to ride
in--pleasant to smoke in as one rode. A superb night for trotting
leisurely round about a peaceful camp; but a bad night for a
reconnoitring party on hostile ground,--a fatal night for Austrian
white-coats in danger of being seen by vigilant French sentries.</p>

<p>Where now were Gustav and his troop? What had they done? What had
happened since they left? How soon would they come back? I asked
myself these questions incessantly.</p>

<p>I could think of nothing else. I looked at my watch every few
minutes. As the time wore on, the hours appeared to grow longer. At
two o'clock, before I had gone half my round, it seemed to me that I
had been all night in the saddle. From two to three, from three to
four, the hours dragged by as if every minute were weighted with
lead.</p>

<p>"The Graf von Lichtenstein will be coming back this way, mein
Herr," said the orderly, spurring his horse up beside mine, and
saluting with his hand to the side of his helmet as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Which way? Over the hill, or down in the hollow?"</p>

<p>"Through the hollow, mein Herr. That is the road by which the Herr
Graf rode out; and the river is too wide for them to cross anywhere
but upstream."</p>

<p>"Then they must come this way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mein Herr."</p>

<p>We were riding along the ridge of a long hill, one side of which
sloped down towards the river, while on the other side it terminated
in an abrupt precipice overhanging a narrow road or ravine, some
forty feet below. The opposite bank was also steep, though less steep
than that on our side; and beyond it the eye travelled over a wide
expanse of dusky pine-woods, now white and heavy with snow.</p>

<p>I reined in my horse the better to observe the scene. Yonder
flowed the Inn, dark and silent, a river of ink winding through
meadow flats of dazzling silver. Far away upon the horizon rose the
mystic outlines of the Franconian Alps. A single sentry, pacing to
and fro some four hundred yards ahead, was distinctly visible in the
moonlight; and such was the perfect stillness of the night that,
although the camp lay at least two miles and a half away, I could
hear the neighing of the horses and the barking of the dogs.</p>

<p>Again I looked at my watch, again calculated how long my friend
had been absent. It was now a quarter past four A.M., and he had left
the camp at midday.</p>

<p>If he had not yet returned--and of course he might have done so at
any moment since I had been out on duty--he had now been gone sixteen
hours and a quarter.</p>

<p>Sixteen hours and quarter! Time enough to have ridden to Munich
and back!</p>

<p>The orderly again brought his horse up abreast with mine.</p>

<p>"Pardon, mein Herr," he said, pointing up the ravine with his
sabre; "but do you see nothing yonder--beyond the turn of the
road--just where there is a gap in the trees?"</p>

<p>I looked; but I saw nothing.</p>

<p>"What do you think you see?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"I scarcely know, mein Herr;--something moving close against the
trees, beyond the hollow way."</p>

<p>"Where the road emerges upon the plain and skirts the
pine-woods?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mein Herr; several dark objects--Ah! they are horsemen!"</p>

<p>"It is the Graf von Lichtenstein and his troop!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Nay, mein Herr; see how slowly they ride, and how they keep close
under the shade of the woods! The Graf von Lichtenstein would not
steal back so quietly."</p>

<p>I stood up in my stirrups, shaded my eyes with my hand, and stared
eagerly at the approaching cavalcade.</p>

<p>They were perhaps half-a-mile away as the crow flies, and would
not have been visible from this point but for a long gap in the trees
on this side of the hill. I could see that they were soldiers. They
might be French; but, somehow, I did not think they were. I fancied,
I hoped, they were our own Lichtensteiners come back again.</p>

<p>"They are making for the hollow way, mein Herr," said the
orderly.</p>

<p>They were evidently making for the hollow way. I watched them past
the gap till the last man had gone by, and it seemed to me they were
about twenty in number.</p>

<p>I dismounted, flung my reins to the orderly, and went to where the
edge of the precipice overhung the road below. Hence, by means of
such bushes and tree-stumps as were rooted in the bank, I clambered
down a few feet lower, and there lay concealed till they should pass
through.</p>

<p>It now seemed to me that they would never come. I do not know how
long I waited. It might have been ten minutes--it might have been
half an hour; but the time that elapsed between the moment when I
dismounted and the moment when the first helmet came in sight seemed
interminable.</p>

<p>The road, as I have already said, lay between a steep declivity on
the one side and a less abrupt height, covered with pine-trees, on
the other--a picturesque winding gorge or ravine, half dark as night,
half bright as day; here deep in shadow, there flooded with
moonlight; and carpeted a foot deep with fresh-fallen snow. After I
had waited and watched till my eyes ached with staring in the gloom,
I at last saw a single horseman coming round the turn of the road,
about a hundred yards from the spot where I was lying. Slowly, and as
it seemed to me, dejectedly, he rode in advance of his comrades. The
rest followed, two and two.</p>

<p>At the first glance, while they were yet in deep shadow, and, as I
have said, a hundred yards distant, I recognised the white cloaks and
plumes and the black chargers of my own corps. I knew at once that it
was Lichtenstein and his troop.</p>

<p>Then a sudden terror fell upon me. Why were they coming back so
slowly? What evil tidings did they bring? How many were returning?
How many were missing? I knew well, if there had been a skirmish, who
was sure to have been foremost in the fight. I knew well, if but
three or four had fallen, who was sure to be one of the fallen.</p>

<p>These thoughts flashed upon me in the first instant when I
recognised the Lichtenstein uniform. I could not have uttered a word,
or have done anything to attract the men's attention, if it had been
to save my life. Dread paralyzed me.</p>

<p>Slowly, dejectedly, noiselessly, the first cuirassier emerged into
the moonlight, passed on again into the gloom, and vanished in the
next turn of the road. It was but for a moment that the moonlight
streamed full upon him; yet in that moment I saw there had been a
fray, and that the man had been badly wounded.</p>

<p>As slowly, as dejectedly, as noiselessly, with broken plumes and
battered helmets, and cloaks torn and blood-stained, the rest came
after, two and two; each pair, as they passed, shining out
momentarily, distinctly, like the images projected for an instant
upon the disc of a magic-lantern.</p>

<p>I held my breath and counted them as they went by--first one
alone; then two and two, till I had counted eighteen riding in pairs.
Then one alone, bringing up the rear. Then ....</p>

<p>I waited--I watched--I refused to believe that this could be all.
I refused to believe that Gustav must not presently come galloping up
to overtake them. At last, long after I knew it was in vain to wait
and watch longer, I clambered up again--cramped, and cold, and sick
at heart--and found the orderly walking the horses up and down on the
brow of the hill. The man looked me in the face, as if he would fain
have asked me what I had seen.</p>

<p>"It was the Graf von Lichtenstein's troop," I said, by an effort;
"but--but the Graf von Lichtenstein is not with them."</p>

<p>And with this I sprang into the saddle, clapped spurs to my horse,
and said no more.</p>

<p>I had still two outposts to visit before finishing my round; but
from that moment to this I have never been able to remember any one
incident of my homeward ride. I visited those outposts, without
doubt; but I was an unconscious of the performance of my duty as a
sleeper is unconscious of the act of breathing.</p>

<p>Gustav was the only man missing. Gustav was dead. I repeated it to
myself over and over again. I felt that it was true. I had no hope
that he was taken prisoner. No--he was dead. He had fallen, fighting
to the last. He had died like a hero. But--he was dead.</p>

<p>At a few minutes after five, I returned to camp. The first person
I met was von Blumenthal, the Prince of Lichtenstein's secretary. He
was walking up and down outside my tent, waiting for me. He ran to me
as I dismounted.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven you are come!" he said. "Go at once to the
prince--the Graf von Lichtenstein is dying. He has fought a troop of
French lancers three times as many as his own, and carried off a
bundle of despatches. But he has paid for them with his life, and
with the lives of all his men. He rode in, covered with wounds, a
couple of hours ago, and had just breath enough left to tell the
tale."</p>

<p>"His own life, and the lives of all his men!" I repeated
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Yes, he left every man on the field--himself the only survivor.
He cut his way out with the captured despatches in one hand and his
sword in the other--and there he lies in the Prince's
tent--dying."</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>He was unconscious--had been unconscious ever since he was laid
upon his uncle's bed--and he died without again opening his eyes or
uttering a word. I saw him breathe his last, and that was all. Even
now, old man as I am, I cannot dwell upon that scene. He was my first
friend, and I may say my best friend. I have known other friendships
since then; but none so intimate--none so precious.</p>

<p>But now comes a question which I yet ask myself "many a time and
oft," and which, throughout all the years that have gone by since
that night, I have never yet been able to answer. Gustav von
Lichtenstein met and fought a troop of French Lancers; saw his own
twenty cuirassiers cut to pieces before his eyes; left them all for
dead upon a certain hillside on the opposite bank of the Inn; and
rode back into camp, covered with wounds--the only survivor!</p>

<p>What, then, was that silent cavalcade that I saw riding through
the hollow way--twenty men without their leader? Were those the dead
whom I met, and was it the one living man who was absent?</p>

<h2><a name="ch4"></a>The Story of Salome</h2>

<p>A few years ago, no matter how many, I, Harcourt Blunt, was
travelling with my friend Coventry Turnour, and it was on the steps
of our hotel that I received from him the announcement-he sent one to
me-that he was again in love.</p>

<p>'I tell you, Blunt,' said my fellow-traveller, 'she's the
loveliest creature I ever beheld in my life.'</p>

<p>I laughed outright.</p>

<p>'My dear fellow,' I replied, 'you've so often seen the loveliest
creature you ever beheld in your life.'</p>

<p>'Ay, but I am in earnest now for the first time.'</p>

<p>'And you have so often been in earnest for the first time!
Remember the innkeeper's daughter at Cologne.</p>

<p>'A pretty housemaid, whom no training could have made
presentable.'</p>

<p>'Then there was the beautiful American at Interlachen.'</p>

<p>'Yes; but-'</p>

<p>'And the Bella Marchesa at Prince Torlonia's ball.'</p>

<p>'Not one of them worthy to be named in the same breath with my
imperial Venetian. Come with me to the Merceria and be convinced. By
taking a gondola to St Mark's Place we shall be there in a quarter of
an hour.'</p>

<p>I went, and he raved of his new flame all the way. She was a
Jewess-he would convert her.</p>

<p>Her father kept a shop in the Merceria-what of that? He dealt only
in costliest Oriental merchandise, and was as rich as a Rothschild.
As for any probable injury to his own prospects, why need he hesitate
on that account? What were 'prospects' when weighed against the
happiness of one's whole life? Besides, he was not ambitious. He
didn't care to go into Parliament. If his uncle Sir Geoffrey cut him
off with a shilling, what then? He had a moderate independence of
which no one living could deprive him, and what more could any
reasonable man desire?</p>

<p>I listened, smiled, and was silent. I knew Coventry Turnour too
well to attach the smallest degree of importance to anything that he
might say or do in a matter of this kind. To be distractedly in love
was his normal condition. We had been friends from boyhood; and since
the time when he used to cherish a hopeless attachment to the young
lady behind the counter of the tart-shop at Harrow, I had never known
him 'fancy-free' for more than a few weeks at a time. He had gone
through every phase of no less than three grandes passions during the
five months that we had now been travelling together; and having left
Rome about eleven weeks before with every hope laid waste, and a
heart so broken that it could never by any possibility be put
together again, he was now, according to the natural course of
events, just ready to fall in love again.</p>

<p>We landed at the traghetto San Marco. It was a cloudless morning
towards the middle of April, just ten years ago. The ducal palace
glowed in the hot sunshine; the boatmen were clustered, gossiping,
about the Mob; the orange-vendors were busy under the arches of the
piazzetta; the fl&acirc;neurs were already eating ices and smoking
cigarettes outside the cafes. There was an Austrian military band,
strapped, buckled, moustachioed, and white-coated, playing just in
front of St Mark's; and the shadow of the great bell-tower slept all
across the square..Passing under the low round archway leading to the
Merceria, we plunged at once into that cool labyrinth of narrow,
intricate, and picturesque streets, where the sun never
penetrates--where no wheels are heard, and no beast of burden is
seen-where every house is a shop, and every shop-front is open to the
ground, as in an Oriental bazaar-where the upper balconies seem
almost to meet overhead, and are separated by only a strip of burning
sky-and where more than three people cannot march abreast in any
part. Pushing our way as best we might through the motley crowd that
here chatters, cheapens, buys, sells, and perpetually bustles to and
fro, we came presently to a shop for the sale of Eastern goods. A few
glass jars filled with spices, and some pieces of stuff, untidily
strewed the counter next the street; but within, dark and narrow
though it seemed, the place was crammed with costliest merchandise.
Cases of gorgeous Oriental jewellery, embroideries and fringes of
massive gold and silver bullion, precious drugs and spices, exquisite
toys in filigree, miracles of carving in ivory, sandal-wood, and
amber, jewelled yataghans, scimitars of state rich with 'barbaric
pearl and gold', bales of Cashmere shawls, China silks, India
muslins, gauzes, and the like, filled every inch of available space
from floor to ceiling, leaving only a narrow lane from the door to
the counter, and a still narrower passage to the rooms beyond the
shop.</p>

<p>We went in. A young woman, who was sifting reading on a low seat
behind the counter, laid aside her book, and rose slowly. She was
dressed wholly in black. I cannot describe the fashion of her
garments. I only know that they fell about her in long, soft,
trailing folds, leaving a narrow band of fine cambric visible at the
throat and wrists; and that, however graceful and unusual this dress
may have been, I scarcely observed it, so entirely was I taken up
with admiration of her beauty.</p>

<p>For she was indeed very beautiful-beautiful in a way that I had
not anticipated. Coventry Turnour, with all his enthusiasm, had
failed to do her justice. He had raved of her eyes-her large,
lustrous, melancholy eyes-of the transparent paleness of her
complexion, of the faultless delicacy of her features; but he had not
prepared me for the unconscious dignity, the perfect nobleness and
refinement, that informed her every look and gesture. My friend
requested to see a bracelet at which he had been looking the day
before. Proud, stately, silent, she unlocked the case in which it was
kept, and laid it before him on the counter. He asked permission to
take it over to the light. She bent her head, but answered not a
word. It was like being waited upon by a young empress.</p>

<p>Turnour took the bracelet to the door and affected to examine it.
It consisted of a double row of gold coins linked together at
intervals by a bean-shaped ornament, studded with pink coral and
diamonds. Coming back into the shop he asked me if I thought it would
please his sister, to whom he had promised a remembrance of
Venice.</p>

<p>'It is a pretty trifle,' I replied; 'but surely a remembrance of
Venice should be of Venetian manufacture. This, I suppose, is
Turkish.'</p>

<p>The beautiful Jewess looked up. We spoke in English; but she
understood and replied:</p>

<p>'E Greco, signore,' she said coldly.</p>

<p>At this moment an old man came suddenly forward from some dark
counting-house at the back-a grizzled, bearded, eager-eyed Shylock,
with a pen behind his ear.</p>

<p>'Go in, Salome-go in, my daughter,' he said hurriedly. 'I will
serve these gentlemen.'</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to his for one moment-then moved silently
away, and vanished in the gloom of the room beyond..We saw her no
more. We lingered awhile, looking over the contents of the
jewel-cases; but in vain. Then Turnour bought his bracelet, and we
went out again into the narrow streets, and back to the open daylight
of the Gran' Piazza.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said breathlessly, 'what do you think of her?'</p>

<p>'She is very lovely.'</p>

<p>'Lovelier than you expected?'</p>

<p>'Much lovelier. But-'</p>

<p>'The sooner you succeed in forgetting her, the better.'</p>

<p>He vowed, of course, that he never would and never could forget
her. He would hear of no incompatibilities, listen to no objections,
believe in no obstacles. That the beautiful Salome was herself not
only unconscious of his passion and indifferent to his person, but
ignorant of his very name and station, were facts not even to be
admitted on the list of difficulties. Finding him thus deaf to
reason, I said no more.</p>

<p>It was all over, however, before the week was out.</p>

<p>'Look here, Blunt,' he said, coming up to me one morning in the
coffee-room of our hotel just as I was sitting down to answer a pile
of home-letters; 'would you like to go on to Trieste tomorrow? There,
don't look at me like that-you can guess how it is with me. I was a
fool ever to suppose she would care for me-a stranger, a foreigner, a
Christian. Well, I'm horribly out of sorts anyhow-and-and I wish I
was a thousand miles off at this moment!'</p>

<p>We travelled on together to Athens, and there parted, Turnour
being bound for England, and I for the East. My own tour lasted many
months longer. I went first to Egypt and the Holy Land; then joined
an exploring party on the Euphrates; and at length, after just twelve
months of Oriental life, found myself back again at Trieste about the
middle of April in the year following that during which occurred the
events I have just narrated. There I found that batch of letters and
papers to which I had been looking forward for many weeks past; and
amongst the former, one from Coventry Turnour. This time he was not
only irrecoverably in love, but on the eve of matrimony. The letter
was rapturous and extravagant enough. The writer was the happiest of
men; his destined bride the loveliest and most amiable of her sex;
the future a paradise; the past a melancholy series of mistakes. As
for love, he had never, of course, known what it was till now.</p>

<p>And what of the beautiful Salome?</p>

<p>Not one word of her from beginning to end. He had forgotten her as
utterly as if she had never existed. And yet how desperately in love
and how desperately in despair he was 'one little year ago'! Ah, yes;
but then it was 'one little year ago'; and who that had ever known
Coventry Turnour would expect him to remember la plus grande des
grandes passions for even half that time?</p>

<p>I slept that night at Trieste, and went on next day to Venice.
Somehow, I could not get Turnour and his love affairs out of my head.
I remembered our visit to the Merceria. I was haunted by the image of
the beautiful Jewess. Was she still so lovely? Did she still sit
reading in her wonted seat by the open counter, with the gloomy shop
reaching away behind, and the cases of rich robes and jewels all
around?</p>

<p>An irresistible impulse prompted me to go to the Merceria and see
her once again. I went. It had been a busy morning with me, and I did
not get there till between three and four o'clock in the afternoon.
The place was crowded. I passed up the well-remembered street,
looking out on both sides for the gloomy little shop with its
unattractive counter; but in vain. When I had gone so far that I
thought I must have passed it, I turned back..House by house I
retraced my steps to the very entrance, and still could not find it.
Then, concluding that I had not gone far enough at first, I turned
back again till I reached a spot where several streets diverged. Here
I came to a standstill, for beyond this point I knew I had not passed
before.</p>

<p>It was now only too evident that the Jew no longer occupied his
former shop in the Merceria, and that my chance of discovering his
whereabouts was exceedingly slender. I could not inquire of his
successor, because I could not identify the house. I found it
impossible even to remember what trades were carried on by his
neighbours on either side. I was ignorant of his very name.</p>

<p>Convinced, therefore, of the inutility of making any further
effort, I gave up the search, and comforted myself by reflecting that
my own heart was not made of adamant, and that it was, perhaps,
better for my peace not to see the beautiful Salome again. I was
destined to see her again, however, and that ere many days had passed
over my head.</p>

<p>A year of more than ordinarily fatiguing Eastern travel had left
me in need of rest, and I had resolved to allow myself a month's
sketching in Venice and its neighbourhood before turning my face
homewards. As, therefore, it is manifestly the first object of a
sketcher to select his points of view, and as no more luxurious
machine than a Venetian gondola was ever invented for the use of man,
I proceeded to employ the first days of my stay in endless boatings
to and fro: now exploring all manner of canals and canaletti; rowing
out in the direction of Murano; now making for the islands beyond San
Pietro Castello, and in the course of these pilgrimages noting down
an infinite number of picturesque sites, and smoking an infinite
number of cigarettes. It was, I think, about the fourth or fifth day
of this pleasant work, when my gondolier proposed to take me as far
as the Lido. It wanted about two hours to sunset, and the great
sandbank lay not more than three or four miles away; so I gave the
word, and in another moment we had changed our route and were gliding
farther and farther from Venice at each dip of the oar. Then the long
dull distant ridge that had all day bounded the shallow horizon rose
gradually above the placid level of the Lagune, assumed a more broken
outline, resolved itself into hillocks and hollows of tawny sand,
showed here and there a patch of parched grass and tangled brake, and
looked like the coasts of some inhospitable desert beyond which no
traveller might penetrate. My boatman made straight for a spot where
some stakes at the water's edge gave token of a landing-place; and
here, though with some difficulty, for the tide was low, ran the
gondola aground. I landed. My first step was among graves.</p>

<p>'E'l cimeterio giudaico, signore,' said my gondolier, with a touch
of his cap.</p>

<p>The Jewish cemetery! The ghetto of the dead! I remembered now to
have read or heard long since how the Venetian Jews, cut off in death
as in life from the neighbourhood of their Christian rulers, had been
buried from immemorial time upon this desolate waste. I stooped to
examine the headstone at my feet. It was but a shattered fragment,
crusted over with yellow lichens, and eaten away by the salt sea air.
I passed on to the next, and the next. Some were completely matted
over with weeds and brambles; some were half-buried in the drifting
sand; of some, only a corner remained above the surface. Here and
there a name, a date, a fragment of heraldic carving, or part of a
Hebrew inscription, was yet legible; but all were more or less broken
and effaced.</p>

<p>Wandering on thus among graves and hillocks, ascending at every
step, and passing some three or four glassy pools overgrown with
gaunt-looking reeds, I presently found that I had reached the central
and most elevated part of the Lido, and that I commanded an
uninterrupted view on every side. On the one hand lay the broad,
silent Lagune bounded by Venice and the Euganean hills--on the other,
stealing up in long, lazy folds, and breaking noiselessly against the
endless shore, Fthe blue Adriatic. An old man gathering shells on the
seaward side, a distant gondola on the Lagune, were the only signs of
life for miles around.</p>

<p>Standing on the upper ridge of this narrow barrier, looking upon
both waters, and watching the gradual approach of what promised to be
a gorgeous sunset, I fell into one of those wandering trams of
thought in which the real and unreal succeed each other as
capriciously as in a dream. I remembered how Goethe here conceived
his vertebral theory of the skull-how Byron, too lame to walk, kept
his horse on the Lido. and here rode daily to and fro-how Shelley
loved the wild solitude of the place, wrote of it in Julian and
Maddalo, listened, perhaps from this very spot, to the mad-house bell
on the island of San Giorgio. Then I wondered if Titian had ever come
hither from his gloomy house on the other side of Venice, to study
the gold and purple of these western skies-if Othello had walked here
with Desdemona-if Shylock was buried yonder, and Leah whom he loved
'when he was a bachelor'.</p>

<p>And then in the midst of my reverie, I came suddenly upon another
Jewish cemetery.</p>

<p>Was it indeed another, or but an outlying portion of the first? It
was evidently another, and a more modern one. The ground was better
kept. The monuments were newer. Such dates as I had succeeded in
deciphering on the broken sepulchres lower down were all of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; but the inscriptions upon these
bore reference to quite recent interments.</p>

<p>I went on a few steps farther. I stopped to copy a quaint Italian
couplet on one tomb-to gather a wild forget-me-not from the foot of
another-to put aside a bramble that trailed across a third-and then I
became aware for the first time of a lady sitting beside a grave not
a dozen yards from the spot on which I stood.</p>

<p>I had believed myself so utterly alone, and was so taken by
surprise, that for the first moment I could almost have persuaded
myself that she also was 'of the stuff that dreams are made of'. She
was dressed from head to foot in the deepest mourning; her face
turned from me, looking towards the sunset; her cheek resting in the
palm of her hand. The grave by which she sat was obviously recent.
The scant herbage round about had been lately disturbed, and the
marble headstone looked as if it had not yet undergone a week's
exposure to wind and weather.</p>

<p>Persuaded that she had not observed me, I lingered for an instant
looking at her. Something in the grace and sorrow of her attitude,
something in the turn of her head and the flow of her sable
draperies, arrested my attention. Was she young? I fancied so. Did
she mourn a husband?-a lover?-a parent? I glanced towards the
headstone. It was covered with Hebrew characters; so that, had I even
been nearer, it could have told me nothing.</p>

<p>But I felt that I had no right to stand there, a spectator of her
sorrow, an intruder on his privacy.</p>

<p>I proceeded to move noiselessly away. At that moment she turned
and looked at me.</p>

<p>It was Salome.</p>

<p>Salome, pale and worn as from some deep and wasting grief, but
more beautiful, if that could be, than ever. Beautiful, with a still
more spiritual beauty than of old; with cheeks so wan and eyes so
unutterably bright and solemn, that my very heart seemed to stand
still as I looked upon them. For one second I paused, half fancying,
half hoping that there was recognition in her glance; then, not
daring to look or linger longer, turned away. When I had gone far
enough to do so without discourtesy, I stopped and gazed back. She
had resumed her former attitude, and was looking over towards Venice
and the setting sun. The stone by which she watched was not more
motionless.</p>

<p>The sun went down in glory. The last flush faded from the domes
and bell-towers of Venice; the western peaks changed from rose to
purple, from gold to grey; a scarcely perceptible film of mist became
all at once visible upon the surface of the Lagune; and overhead, the
first star trembled into light. I waited and watched till the shadows
had so deepened that I could no longer distinguish one distant object
from another. Was that the spot? Was she still there? Was she moving?
Was she gone? I could not tell. The more I looked, the more uncertain
I became. Then, fearing to miss my way in the fast-gathering
twilight, I struck down towards the water's edge, and made for the
point at which I had landed.</p>

<p>I found my gondolier fast asleep, with his head on a cushion, and
his bit of gondola-carpet thrown over him for a counterpane. I asked
if he had seen any other boat put off from the Lido since I left? He
rubbed his eyes, started up, and was awake in a moment.</p>

<p>'Per Bacco, signore, I have been asleep,' he said apologetically:
'I have seen nothing.'</p>

<p>'Did you observe any other boat moored hereabouts when we
landed?'</p>

<p>'None, signore.</p>

<p>'And you have seen nothing of a lady in black?'</p>

<p>He laughed and shook his head.</p>

<p>'Consolatevi, signore,' he said archly. 'She will come
tomorrow.'</p>

<p>Then, finding that I looked grave, he touched his cap, and with a
gentle, 'Scusate, signore,' took his place at the stern, and there
waited. I bade him row to my hotel; and then, leaning dreamily back
in my little dark cabin, I folded my arms, closed my eyes, and
thought of Salome.</p>

<p>How lovely she was! How infinitely more lovely than even my first
remembrance of her! How was it that I had not admired her more that
day in the Merceria? Was I blind, or had she become indeed more
beautiful? It was a sad and strange place in which to meet her again.
By whose grave was she watching? By her father's? Yes, surely by her
father's. He was an old man when I saw him, and in the course of
nature had not long to live. He was dead: hence my unavailing search
in the Merceria. He was dead. His shop was let to another occupant.
His stock-in-trade was sold and dispersed. And Salome-was she left
alone? Had she no mother? no brother?-no lover? Would her eyes have
had that look of speechless woe in them if she had any very near or
dear tie left on earth? Then I thought of Coventry Turnour, and his
approaching marriage. Did he ever really love her? I doubted it.
'True love,' saith an old song, 'can ne'er forget'; but he had
forgotten, as though the past had been a dream. And yet he was in
earnest while it lasted-would have risked all for her sake, if she
would have listened to him. Ah, if she had listened to him!</p>

<p>And then I remembered that he had never told me the particulars of
that affair. Did she herself reject him, or did he lay his suit
before her father? And was he rejected only because he was a
Christian? I had never cared to ask these things while we were
together; but now I would have given the best hunter in my stables to
know every minute detail connected with the matter.</p>

<p>Pondering thus, travelling over the same ground again and again,
wondering whether she remembered me, whether she was poor, whether
she was indeed alone in the world, how long the old man had been
dead, and a hundred other things of the same kind-I scarcely noticed
how the watery miles glided past, or how the night closed in. One
question, however, recurred oftener than any other: How was I to see
her again?</p>

<p>I arrived at my hotel; I dined at the table d'h&ocirc;te; I
strolled out, after dinner, to my favourite cafe in the piazza; I
dropped in for half an hour at the Fenice, and heard one act of an
extremely poor opera; I came home restless, uneasy, wakeful; and
sitting for hours before my bedroom fire, asked myself the same
perpetual question, How was I to see her again?</p>

<p>Fairly tired out at last, I fell asleep in my chair, and when I
awoke the sun was shining upon my window.</p>

<p>I started to my feet. I had it now. It flashed upon me, as if it
came with the sunlight. I had but to go again to the cemetery, copy
the inscription upon the old man's tomb, ask my learned friend
Professor Nicolai, of Padua, to translate it for me, and then, once
in possession of names and dates, the rest would be easy.</p>

<p>In less than an hour, I was once more on my way to the Lido.</p>

<p>I took a rubbing of the stone. It was the quickest way, and the
surest; for I knew that in Hebrew everything depended on the pointing
of the characters, and I feared to trust my own untutored skill. This
done, I hastened back, wrote my letter to the professor, and
dispatched both letter and rubbing by the midday train.</p>

<p>The professor was not a prompt man. On the contrary he was a
pre-eminently slow man; dreamy, indolent, buried in Oriental lore.
From any other correspondent one might have looked for a reply in the
course of the morrow; but from Nicolai of Padua it would have been
folly to expect one under two or three days. And in the meanwhile?
Well, in the meanwhile there were churches and palaces to be seen,
sketches to be made, letters of introduction to be delivered. It was,
at all events, of no use to be impatient.</p>

<p>And yet I was impatient-so impatient that I could neither sketch,
nor read, nor sit still for ten minutes together. Possessed by an
uncontrollable restlessness, I wandered from gallery to gallery, from
palace to palace, from church to church. The imprisonment of even a
gondola was irksome to me. I was, as it were, impelled to be moving
and doing; and even so, the day seemed endless.</p>

<p>The next was even worse. There was just the possibility of a reply
from Padua, and the knowledge of that possibility unsettled me for
the day. Having watched and waited for every post from eight to four,
I went down to the traghetto of St Mark's, and was there hailed by my
accustomed gondolier.</p>

<p>He touched his cap and waited for orders.</p>

<p>'Where to, signore?' he asked, finding that I remained silent.</p>

<p>'To the Lido.'</p>

<p>It was an irresistible temptation, and I yielded to it; but I
yielded in opposition to my judgment.</p>

<p>I knew that I ought not to haunt the place. I had resolved that I
would not. And yet I went.</p>

<p>Going along, I told myself that I had only come to reconnoitre. It
was not unlikely that she might be going to the same spot about the
same hour as before; and in that case I might overtake her gondola by
the way, or find it moored somewhere along the shore. At all events,
I was determined not to land. But we met no gondola beyond San Pietro
Castello; saw no sign of one along the shore. The afternoon was far
advanced; the sun was near going down; we had the Lagune and the Lido
to ourselves.</p>

<p>My boatman made for the same landing-place, and moored his gondola
to the same stake as before. He took it for granted that I meant to
land; and I landed. After all, however, it was evident that Salome
could not be there, in which case I was guilty of no intrusion. I
might stroll in the direction of the cemetery, taking care to avoid
her, if she were anywhere about, and keeping well away from that part
where I had last seen her. So I broke another resolve, and went up
towards the top of the Lido. Again I came to the salt pools and the
reeds; again stood with the sea upon my left hand and the Lagune upon
my right, and the endless sandbank reaching on for miles between the
two. Yonder lay the new cemetery. Standing thus I overlooked every
foot of the ground. I could even distinguish the headstone of which I
had taken the rubbing the morning before. There was no living thing
in sight. I was, to all appearance, as utterly alone as Enoch Arden
on his desert island..Then I strolled on, a little nearer, and a
little nearer still; and then, contrary to all my determinations, I
found myself standing upon the very spot, beside the very grave,
which I had made my mind on no account to approach.</p>

<p>The sun was now just going down-had gone down, indeed, behind a
bank of golden-edged cumuli-and was flooding earth, sea, and sky with
crimson. It was at this hour that I saw her. It was upon this spot
that she was sitting. A few scant blades of grass had sprung up here
and there upon the grave. Her dress must have touched them as she sat
there-her dress; perhaps her hand.</p>

<p>I gathered one, and laid it carefully between the leaves of my
note-book.</p>

<p>At last I turned to go, and, turning, met her face to face!</p>

<p>She was distant about six yards, and advancing slowly towards the
spot on which I was standing. Her head drooped slightly forward; her
hands were clasped together; her eyes were fixed upon the ground. It
was the attitude of a null. Startled, confused, scarcely knowing what
I did, I took off my hat, and drew aside to let her pass.</p>

<p>She looked up-hesitated-stood still-gazed at me with a strange,
without another glance, and resumed her former place and attitude
beside her father's grave.</p>

<p>I turned away. I would have given worlds to speak to her; but I
had not dared, and the opportunity was gone. Yet I might have spoken!
She looked at me-looked at me with so strange and piteous an
expression in her eyes-continued looking at me as long as one might
have counted five...I might have spoken. I surely might have spoken!
And now-ah! now it was impossible. She had fallen into the old
thoughtful attitude with her cheek resting on her hand.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were far away. She had forgotten my very
presence.</p>

<p>I went back to the shore, more disturbed and uneasy than ever. I
spent all the remaining daylight in rowing up and down the margin of
the Lido, looking for her gondola-hoping, at all events, to see her
put off-to follow her, perhaps, across the waste of waters. But the
dusk came quickly on, and then darkness, and I left at last without
having seen any further sign or token of her presence.</p>

<p>Lying awake that night, tossing uneasily upon my bed, and thinking
over the incidents of the last few days, I found myself perpetually
recurring to that long, steady, sorrowful gaze which she fixed upon
me in the cemetery. The more I thought of it, the more I seemed to
feel that there was in it some deeper meaning than I, in my
confusion, had observed at the time. It was such a strange look-a
look almost of entreaty, I asking for help or sympathy; like the dumb
appeal in the eyes of a sick animal. Could this really be? What,
after all, more possible than that, left alone in the world-with,
perhaps, not a single male relation to advise her-she found herself
in some position of present difficulty, and knew not where to turn
for help? All this might well be. She had even, perhaps, some
instinctive feeling that she might trust me. Ah! if she would indeed
trust me...</p>

<p>I had hoped to receive my Paduan letter by the morning delivery;
but morning and afternoon went by as before, and still no letter
came. As the day began to decline, I was again on my way to the Lido;
this time for the purpose, and with the intention, of speaking to
her. I landed, and went direct to the cemetery. It had been a dull
day. Lagune and sky were both one leaden uniform grey, and a mist
hung over Venice.</p>

<p>I saw her from the moment I reached the upper ridge. She was
walking slowly to and fro among the graves, like a stately shadow. I
had felt confident, somehow, that she would be there; and now, for
some reason that I could not have defined for my life, I felt equally
confident that she expected me..Trembling and eager, yet half
dreading the moment when she should discover my presence, I hastened
on, printing the loose sand at every noiseless step. A few moments
more, and I should overtake her, speak to her, hear the music of her
voice-that music which I remembered so well, though a year had gone
by since I last heard it. But how should I address her? What had I to
say?</p>

<p>I knew not. I had no time to think. I could only hurry on till
within some ten feet of her trailing garments; stand still when she
turned, and uncover before her as if she were a queen.</p>

<p>She paused and looked at me, just as she had paused and looked at
me the evening before.</p>

<p>With the same sorrowful meaning in her eyes; with even more than
the same entreating expression. But she waited for me to speak.</p>

<p>I did speak. I cannot recall what I said; I only know that I
faltered something of an apology--mentioned that I had had the honour
of meeting her before, many months ago; and, trying to say
more-trying to express how thankfully and proudly I would devote
myself to any service.</p>

<p>However humble, however laborious, I failed both in voice and
words, and broke down utterly.</p>

<p>Having come to a stop, I looked up, and found her eyes still fixed
upon me.</p>

<p>'You are a Christian,' she said.</p>

<p>A trembling came upon me at the first sound of her voice. It was
the same voice; distinct, melodious, scarce louder than a whisper-and
yet it was not quite the same. There was a melancholy in the music,
and, if I may use a word which, after all, fails to express my
meaning, a remoteness, that fell upon my ear like the plaintive
cadence in an autumnal wind.</p>

<p>I bent my head, and answered that I was.</p>

<p>She pointed to the headstone of which I had taken a rubbing a day
or two before.</p>

<p>'A Christian soul lies there,' she said, 'laid in earth without
one Christian prayer-with Hebrew rites-in a Hebrew sanctuary. Will
you, stranger, perform an act of piety towards the dead?'</p>

<p>'The Signora has but to speak,' I said. 'All that she wishes shall
be done.'</p>

<p>'Read one prayer over this grave; trace a cross upon this
stone.'</p>

<p>'I will.'</p>

<p>She thanked me with a gesture, slightly bowed her head, drew her
outer garment more closely round her, and moved away to a rising
ground at some little distance. I was dismissed. I had no excuse for
lingering-no right to prolong the interview-no business to remain
there one moment longer. So I left her there, nor once looked back
till I reached the last point from which I knew I should be able to
see her. But when I turned for that last look she was no longer in
sight.</p>

<p>I had resolved to speak to her, and this was the result. A
stranger interview never, surely, fell to the lot of man! I had said
nothing that I meant to say-had learnt nothing that I sought to
know.</p>

<p>With regard to her circumstances, her place of residence, her very
name, I was no wiser than before. And yet I had, perhaps, no reason
to be dissatisfied. She had honoured me with her confidence, and
entrusted to me a task of some difficulty and importance. It now only
remained for me to execute that task as thoroughly and as quickly as
possible. That done, I might fairly hope to win some place in her
remembrance-by and by, perhaps, in her esteem.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the old question rose again-whose grave could it be? I
had settled this matter so conclusively in my own mind from the
first, that could scarcely believe even now that it was not her
father's. Yet that he should have died a secret convert to
Christianity was incredible. Whose grave could it be? A lover's? a
Christian lover's? Alas! it might be. Or a sister's? In either of
these cases it was more than probable that Salome was herself a
convert. But I had no time to waste in conjecture. I must act, and
act promptly..I hastened back to Venice as fast as my gondolier could
row me; and as we went along I promised myself that all her wishes
should be carried out before she visited the spot again. To at once
secure the services of a clergyman who would go with me to the Lido
at early dawn, and there read some portion, at least, of the
burial-service! and at the same time to engage a stonemason to cut
the cross-to have all done before she, or anyone, should have
approached the place next day, was my especial object. And that
object I was resolved to carry out, though I had to search Venice
through before I laid my head upon the pillow.</p>

<p>I found my clergyman without difficulty. He was a young man
occupying rooms in the same hotel, and on the same floor as myself. I
had met him each day at the table d'h&ocirc;te, and conversed with
him once or twice in the reading-room. He was a North countryman, had
not long since taken orders, and was both gentlemanly and obliging.
He promised in the readiest manner to do all that I required, and to
breakfast with me at six the next morning, in order that we might
reach the cemetery by eight.</p>

<p>To find my stonemason, however, was not so easy; and yet I went to
work methodically enough. I began with the Venetian Directory; then
copied a list of stonemasons' names and addresses; then took a
gondola a due rame, and started upon my voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>But a night's voyage of discovery among the intricate back
canaletti of Venice is no very easy and no very safe enterprise.
Narrow, tortuous, densely populated, often blocked by huge hay, wood,
and provision barges, almost wholly unlighted, and so perplexingly
alike that no mere novice in Venetian topography need ever hope to
distinguish one from another, they baffle the very gondoliers, and
are a terra incognita to all but the dwellers therein.</p>

<p>I succeeded, however, in finding three of the places entered on my
list. At the first I was told that the workman of whom I was in quest
was working by the week somewhere over by Murano, and would not be
back again till Saturday night. At the second and third, I found the
men at home, supping with their wives and children at the end of the
day's work; but neither would consent to undertake my commission.
One, after a whispered consultation with his son, declined
reluctantly. The other told me plainly that he dared not do it, and
that he did not believe I should find a stonemason in Venice who
would be bolder than himself.</p>

<p>The Jews, he said, were rich and powerful; no longer an oppressed
people; no longer to be insulted even in Venice with impunity. To cut
a Christian cross upon a Jewish headstone in the Jewish cemetery,
would be 'a sort of sacrilege', and punishable, no doubt, by the law.
This sounded like truth; so finding that my rowers were by no means
confident of their way, and that the canaletti were dark as the
catacombs, I prevailed upon the stonemason to sell me a small mallet
and a couple of chisels, and made up my mind to commit the sacrilege
myself.</p>

<p>With this single exception, all was done next morning as I had
planned to do. My new acquaintance breakfasted with me, accompanied
me to the Lido, read such portions of the burial-service as seemed
proper to him, and then, having business in Venice, left me to my
task. It was by no means an easy one. To a skilled hand it would have
been, perhaps, the work of half an hour; but it was my first effort,
and rude as the thing was-a mere grooved attempt at a Latin cross,
about two inches and a half in length, cut close at the bottom of the
stone, where it could be easily concealed by a little piling of the
sand-it took me nearly four hours to complete.</p>

<p>While I was at work, the dull grey morning grew duller and greyer;
a thick sea fog drove up from the Adriatic, and a low moaning wind
came and went like the echo of a distant requiem. More than once I
started, believing that she had surprised me there-fancying I saw the
passing of a shadow-heard the rustling of a garment-the breathing of
a sigh. But no. The mists and the moaning wind deceived me. I was
alone..When at length I got back to my hotel, it was just two
o'clock. The hall-porter put a letter into my hand as I passed
through. One glance at that crabbed superscription was enough. It was
from Padua. I hastened to my room, tore open the envelope, and read
these words:</p>

<p>'CARO SIGNORE,-The rubbing you send is neither ancient nor
curious, as I fear you suppose it to be. Altro; it is of yesterday.
It merely records that one Salome, the only and beloved child of a
certain Isaac da Costa, died last autumn on the eighteenth of
October, aged twenty-one years, and that by the said Isaac da Costa
this monument is erected to the memory of her virtues and his
grief.</p>

<p>'I pray you caro signore, to receive the assurance of my sincere
esteem.</p>

<p>NICOLO NICOIAI.</p>

<p>'Padua, April 27th, 1857.'</p>

<p>The letter dropped from my hand. I seemed to have read without
understanding it. I picked it up; went through it again, word by
word; sat down; rose up; took a turn across the room; felt confused,
bewildered, incredulous.</p>

<p>Could there, then, be two Salomes? or was there some radical and
extraordinary mistake?</p>

<p>I hesitated; I knew not what to do. Should I go down to the
Merceria, and see whether the name of da Costa was known in the
quartier? Or find out the registrar of births and deaths for the
Jewish district? Or call upon the principal rabbi, and learn from him
who this second Salome had been, and in what degree of relationship
she stood towards the Salome whom I knew? I decided upon the last
course. The chief rabbi's address was easily obtained. He lived in an
ancient house on the Giudecca, and there I found him-a grave, stately
old man, with a grizzled beard reaching nearly to his waist.</p>

<p>I introduced myself, and stated my business. I came to ask if he
could give me any information respecting the late Salome da Costa,
who died on the 18th of October last, and was buried on the Lido.</p>

<p>The rabbi replied that he had no doubt he could give me any
information I desired, as he had known the lady personally, and was
the intimate friend of her father.</p>

<p>'Can you tell me,' I asked, 'whether she had any dear friend or
female relative of the same name-Salome?' The rabbi shook his head.
'I think not, he said. 'I remember no other maiden of that name.'</p>

<p>'Pardon me, but I know there was another,' I replied. 'There was a
very beautiful Salome living in the Merceria when I was last in
Venice, just this time last year.'</p>

<p>'Salome da Costa was very fair,' said the rabbi; 'and she dwelt
with her father in the Merceria.</p>

<p>Since her death, he hath removed to the neighbourhood of the
Rialto.'</p>

<p>'This Salome's father was a dealer in Oriental goods,' I said,
hastily.</p>

<p>'Isaac da Costa is a dealer in Oriental goods,' replied the old
man very gently. 'We are speaking, my son, of the same persons.'</p>

<p>'Impossible!'</p>

<p>He shook his head again.</p>

<p>'But she lives!' I exclaimed, becoming greatly agitated. 'She
lives. I have seen her. I have spoken to her. I saw her only last
evening.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' he said compassionately, 'this is some dream. She of whom
you speak is indeed no more.'</p>

<p>'I saw her only last evening,' I repeated.</p>

<p>'Where did you suppose you beheld her?'</p>

<p>'On the Lido.'.'On the Lido?'</p>

<p>'And she spoke to me. I heard her voice-heard it as distinctly as
I hear my own at this moment.'</p>

<p>The rabbi stroked his beard thoughtfully, and looked at me. 'You
think you heard her voice!' he ejaculated. 'That is strange. What
said she?'</p>

<p>I was about to answer. I checked myself-a sudden thought flashed
upon me-I trembled from head to foot. 'Have you-have you any reason
for supposing that she died a Christian?' I faltered.</p>

<p>The old man started, and changed colour.</p>

<p>'I-I-that is a strange question,' he stammered. 'Why do you ask
it?'</p>

<p>'Yes or no?' I cried wildly. 'Yes or no?'</p>

<p>He frowned, looked down, hesitated. 'I admit,' he said, after a
moment or two-'I admit that I may have heard something tending that
way. It may be that the maiden cherished some secret doubt. Yet she
was no professed Christian.'</p>

<p>'Laid in earth without one Christian prayer; with Hebrew rites; in
a Hebrew sanctuary!' I repeated to myself.</p>

<p>'But I marvel how you come to have heard of this,' continued the
rabbi. 'It was known only to her father and myself.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' I said solemnly, 'I know now that Salome da Costa is dead;
I have seen her spirit thrice, haunting the spot where-'</p>

<p>My voice broke. I could not utter the words.</p>

<p>'Last evening, at sunset,' I resumed, 'was the third time. Never
doubting that-that I indeed beheld her in the flesh, I spoke to her.
She answered me. She-she told me this.'</p>

<p>The rabbi covered his face with his hands, and so remained for
some time, lost in meditation.</p>

<p>Young man,' he said at length, 'your story is strange, and you
bring strange evidence to bear upon it. It may be as you say; it may
be that you are the dupe of some waking dream-I know not.'</p>

<p>He knew not; but I-ah! I knew, only too well. I knew now why she
had appeared to me clothed with such unearthly beauty. I understood
now that look of dumb entreaty in her eyes-that tone of strange
remoteness in her voice. The sweet soul could not rest amid the dust
of its kinsfolk, 'unhousel'd, unanointed, unaneal'd', lacking even
'one Christian prayer above its grave. And now-was it all over?
Should I never see her more?</p>

<p>Never-ah! never. How I haunted the Lido at sunset for many a
month, till spring had blossomed into autumn, and autumn had ripened
into summer; how I wandered back to Venice year after year, at the
same season, while yet any vestige of that wild hope remained alive;
how my heart has never throbbed, my pulse never leaped, for love of
mortal woman since that time--are details into which I need not enter
here. Enough that I watched and waited but that her gracious spirit
appeared to me no more. I wait still, but I watch no longer. I know
now that our place of meeting will not be here.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5"></a>Was it an Illusion? A Parson's Story</h2>

<p>The facts which I am about to relate happened to myself some
sixteen or eighteen years ago, at which time I served Her Majesty as
an Inspector of Schools. Now, the Provincial Inspector is perpetually
on the move; and I was still young enough to enjoy a life of constant
travelling.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, many less agreeable ways in which an
unbeneficed parson may contrive to scorn delights and live laborious
days. In remote places where strangers are scarce, his annual visit
is an important event; and though at the close of a long day's work
he would sometimes prefer the quiet of a country inn, he generally
finds himself the destined guest of the rector or the squire. It
rests with himself to turn these opportunities to account. If he
makes himself pleasant, he forms agreeable friendships and sees
English home-life under one of its most attractive aspects; and
sometimes, even in these days of universal common-placeness, he may
have the luck to meet with an adventure.</p>

<p>My first appointment was to a West of England district largely
peopled with my personal friends and connections. It was, therefore,
much to my annoyance that I found myself, after a couple of years of
very pleasant work, transferred to what a policeman would call 'a new
beat,' up in the North. Unfortunately for me, my new beat-a rambling,
thinly populated area of something under 1,800 square miles-was three
times as large as the old one, and more than pro-portionately
unmanageable. Intersected at right angles by two ranges of barren
hills and cut off to a large extent from the main lines of railway,
itunited about every inconvenience that a district could possess. The
villages lay wide apart, often separated by long tracts of moorland;
and in place of the well-warmed railway compartment and the frequent
manor-house, I now spent half my time in hired vehicles and lonely
country inns.</p>

<p>I had been in possession of this district for some three months or
so, and winter was near at hand, when I paid my first visit of
inspection to Pit End, an outlying hamlet in the most northerly
corner of my county, just twenty-two miles from the nearest station.
Haying slept overnight at a place called Drumley, and inspected
Drumley schools in the morning, I started for Pit End, with fourteen
miles of railway and twenty-two of hilly cross-roads between myself
and my journey's end. I made, of course, all the enquiries I could
think of before leaving; but neither the Drumley schoolmaster nor the
landlord of the Drumley 'Feathers' knew much more of Pit End than its
name. My predecessor, it seemed, had been in the habit of taking Pit
End 'from the other side', the roads, though longer, being less hilly
that way. That the place boasted some kind of inn was certain; but it
was an inn unknown to fame, and to mine host of the 'Feathers'. Be it
good or bad, however, I should have to put up at it.</p>

<p>Upon this scant information I started. My fourteen miles of
railway journey soon ended at a place called Bramsford Road, whence
an omnibus conveyed passengers to a dull little town called Bramsford
Market. Here I found a horse and 'trap' to carry me on to my
destination; the horse being a rawboned grey with a profile like a
camel, and the trap a ricketty high gig which had probably done
commercial travelling in the days of its youth. From Bramsford Market
the way lay over a succession of long hills, rising to a barren,
high-level plateau. It was a dull, raw afternoon of mid-November,
growing duller and more raw as the day waned and the east wind blew
keener...'How much further now, driver?' I asked, as we alighted at
the foot of a longer and a stiffer hill than any we had yet passed
over.</p>

<p>He turned a straw in his mouth, and grunted something about 'fewer
or foive mile by the rooad'.</p>

<p>And then I learned that by turning off at a point which he
described as 't'owld tollus', and taking a certain footpath across
the fields, this distance might be considerably shortened. I decided,
therefore, to walk the rest of the way; and, setting off at a good
pace, I soon left driver and trap behind. At the top of the hill I
lost sight of them, and coming presently to a little road-side ruin
which I at once recognized as the old toll-house, I found the
footpath without difficulty.</p>

<p>It led me across a barren slope divided by stone fences, with here
and there a group of shattered sheds, a tall chimney, and a blackened
cinder-mound, marking the site of a deserted mine. A light fog,
meanwhile, was creeping up from the east, and the dusk was gathering
fast.</p>

<p>Now, to lose one's way in such a place and at such an hour would
be disagreeable enough, and the footpath-a trodden track already half
obliterated-would be indistinguishable in the course of another ten
minutes. Looking anxiously ahead, therefore, in the hope of seeing
some sign of habitation, I hastened on, scaling one stone stile after
another, till I all at once found myself skirting a line of
park-palings. Following these, with bare boughs branching out
overhead and dead leaves rustling underfoot, I came presently to a
point where the path divided; here continuing to skirt the enclosure,
and striking off yonder across a space of open meadow.</p>

<p>Which should I take?</p>

<p>By following the fence, I should be sure to arrive at a lodge
where I could enquire my way to Pit End; but then the park might be
of any extent, and I might have a long distance to go before I came
to the nearest lodge. Again, the meadow-path, instead of leading to
Pit End, might take me in a totally opposite direction. But there was
no time to be lost in hesitation; so I chose the meadow, the further
end of which was lost to sight in a fleecy bank of fog.</p>

<p>Up to this moment I had not met a living soul of whom to ask my
way; it was, therefore, with no little sense of relief that I saw a
man emerging from the fog and coming along the path. As we neared
each other-I advancing rapidly; he slowly-I observed that he dragged
the left foot, limping as he walked. It was, however, so dark and so
misty, thatt not till we were within half a dozen yards of each other
could I see hat he wore a dark suit and an Anglican felt hat, and
looked something like a dissenting minister. As soon as we were
within speaking distance, I addressed him.</p>

<p>'Can you tell me', I said, 'if I am right for Pit End, and how far
I have to go?'</p>

<p>He came on, looking straight before him; taking no notice of my
question; apparently not hearing it.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon,' I said, raising my voice; 'but will this path
take me to Pit End, and if so'--He had passed on without pausing;
without looking at me; I could almost have believed, without seeing
me!</p>

<p>I stopped, with the words on my lips; then turned to look
after-perhaps, to follow-him.</p>

<p>But instead of following, I stood bewildered.</p>

<p>What had become of him? And what lad was that going up the path by
which I had just come-that tall lad, half-running, half-walking, with
a fishing-rod over his shoulder? I could have taken my oath that I
had neither met nor passed him. Where then had he come from? And
where was the man to whom I had spoken not three seconds ago, and
who, at his limping pace, could not have made more than a couple of
yards in the time? My stupefaction was such that I stood quite still,
looking after the lad with the fishing-rod till he disappeared in the
gloom under the park-palings.</p>

<p>Was I dreaming?</p>

<p>Darkness, meanwhile, had closed in apace, and, dreaming or not
dreaming, I must push on, or find myself benighted. So I hurried
forward, turning my back on the last gleam of daylight, and plunging
deeper into the fog at every step. I was, however, close upon my
journey's end. The path ended at a turnstile; the turnstile opened
upon a steep lane; and at the bottom of the lane, down which I
stumbled among stones and ruts, I came in sight of the welcome glare
of a blacksmith's forge.</p>

<p>Here, then, was Pit End. I found my trap standing at the door of
the village inn; the rawboned grey stabled for the night; the
landlord watching for my arrival.</p>

<p>The 'Greyhound' was a hostelry of modest pretensions, and I shared
its little parlour with a couple of small farmers and a young man who
informed me that he 'travelled in' Thorley's Food for Cattle. Here I
dined, wrote my letters, chatted awhile with the landlord, and picked
up such scraps of local news as fell in my way.</p>

<p>There was, it seemed, no resident parson at Pit End; the incumbent
being a pluralist with three small livings, the duties of which, by
the help of a rotatory curate, he discharged in a somewhat easy
fashion. Pit End, as the smallest and furthest off, came in for but
one service each Sunday, and was almost wholly relegated to the
curate. The squire was a more confirmed absentee than even the vicar.
He lived chiefly in Paris, spending abroad the wealth of his Pit End
coal-fields.</p>

<p>He happened to be at home just now, the landlord said, after five
years' absence; but he would be off again next week, and another five
years might probably elapse before they should again see him at
Blackwater Chase.</p>

<p>Blackwater Chase!-the name was not new to me; yet I could not
remember where I had heard it. When, however, mine host went on to
say that, despite his absenteeism, Mr Wolstenholme was 'a pleasant
gentleman and a good landlord', and that, after all, Blackwater Chase
was 'a lonesome sort of world-end place for a young man to bury
himself in', then I at once remembered Phil Wolstenholme of Balliol,
who, in his grand way, had once upon a time given me a general
invitation to the shooting at Blackwater Chase. That was twelve years
ago, when I was reading hard at Wadham, and Wolstenholme-the idol of
a clique to which I did not belong-was boating, betting, writing
poetry, and giving wine parties at Balliol.</p>

<p>Yes; I remembered all about him-his handsome face, his luxurious
rooms, his boyish prodigality, his utter indolence, and the blind
faith of his worshippers, who believed that he had only 'to pull
himself together' in order to carry off every honour which the
University had to bestow. He did take the Newdigate; but it was his
first and last achievement, and he left college with the reputation
of having narrowly escaped a plucking. How vividly it all came back
upon my memory-the old college life, the college friendships, the
pleasant time that could never come again! It was but twelve years
ago; yet it seemed like half a century. And now, after these twelve
years, here were Wolstenholme and I as near neighbours as in our
Oxford days! I wondered if he was much changed, and whether, if
changed, it were for the better or the worse.</p>

<p>Had his generous impulses developed into sterling virtues, or had
his follies hardened into vices?</p>

<p>Should I let him know where I was, and so judge for myself?
Nothing would be easier than to pencil a line upon a card tomorrow
morning, and send it up to the big house. Yet, merely to satisfy a
purposeless curiosity, was it worthwhile to reopen the
acquaintanceship? Thus musing, I sat late over the fire, and by the
time I went to bed, I had well nigh forgotten my adventure with the
man who vanished so mysteriously and the boy who seemed to come from
nowhere.</p>

<p>Next morning, finding I had abundant time at my disposal, I did
pencil that line upon my card-a mere line, saving that I believed we
had known each other at Oxford, and that I should be inspecting the
National Schools from nine till about eleven. And then, having
dispatched it by one of my landlord's sons, I went off to my work.
The day was brilliantly fine. The wind had shifted round to the
north, the sun shone clear and cold, and the smoke-grimed hamlet, and
the gaunt buildings clustered at the mouths of the coalpits round
about, looked as bright as they could look at any time of the year.
The village was built up a long hill-side; the church and schools
being at the top, and the 'Greyhound' at the bottom. Looking vainly
for the lane by which I had come the night before, I climbed the one
rambling street, followed a path that skirted the churchyard, and
found myself at the schools. These, with the teachers' dwellings,
formed three sides of a quadrangle; the fourth side consisting of an
iron railing and a gate. An inscribed tablet over the main
entrance-door recorded how 'These school-houses were re-built by
Philip Wolstenholme, Esquire: AD 18-.'</p>

<p>Mr Wolstenholme, sir, is the Lord of the Manor,' said a soft,
obsequious voice.</p>

<p>I turned, and found the speaker at my elbow, a square-built,
sallow man, all in black, with a bundle of copy-books under his
arm.</p>

<p>'You are the-the schoolmaster?' I said; unable to remember his
name, and puzzled by a vague recollection of his face.</p>

<p>'Just so, sir. I conclude I have the honour of addressing Mr
Frazer?'</p>

<p>It was a singular face, very pallid and anxious-looking. The eyes,
too, had a watchful, almost a startled, look in them, which struck me
as peculiarly unpleasant.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I replied, still wondering where and when I had seen him.
'My name is Frazer. Yours, I believe, is-is-,' and I put my hand into
my pocket for my examination papers.</p>

<p>'Skelton-Ebenezer Skelton. Will you please to take the boys first,
sir?'</p>

<p>The words were commonplace enough, but the man's manner was
studiously, disagreeably deferential; his very name being given, as
it were, under protest, as if too insignificant to be mentioned.</p>

<p>I said I would begin with the boys; and so moved on. Then, for we
had stood still till now, I saw that the schoolmaster was lame. In
that moment I remembered him. He was the man I met in the fog.</p>

<p>'I met you yesterday afternoon, Mr Skelton,' I said, as we went
into the school-mom.</p>

<p>'Yesterday afternoon, sir?' he repeated.</p>

<p>'You did not seem to observe me,' I said, carelessly. 'I spoke to
you, in fact; but you did not reply to me.'</p>

<p>'But-indeed, I beg your pardon, sir-it must have been someone
else,' said the schoolmaster, 'I did not go out yesterday
afternoon.'</p>

<p>How could this be anything but a falsehood? I might have been
mistaken as to the man's face; though it was such a singular face,
and I had seen it quite plainly. But how could I be mistaken as to
his lameness? Besides, that curious trailing of the right foot, as if
the ankle was broken, was not an ordinary lameness.</p>

<p>I suppose I looked incredulous, for he added, hastily:.'Even if I
had not been preparing the boys for inspection, sir, I should not
have gone out yesterday afternoon. It was too damp and foggy. I am
obliged to be careful-I have a very delicate chest.'</p>

<p>My dislike to the man increased with every word he uttered. I did
not ask myself with what motive he went on heaping lie upon lie; it
was enough that, to serve his own ends, whatever those ends might be,
he did lie with unparallelled audacity.</p>

<p>'We will proceed to the examination, Mr Skelton,' I said,
contemptuously.</p>

<p>He turned, if possible, a shade paler than before, bent his head
silently, and called up the scholars in their order.</p>

<p>I soon found that, whatever his shortcomings as to veracity, Mr
Ebenezer Skelton was a capital schoolmaster. His boys were uncommonly
well taught, and as regarded attendance, good conduct, and the like,
left nothing to be desired. When, therefore, at the end of the
examination, he said he hoped I would recommend the Pit End Boys'
School for the Government grant, I at once assented. And now I
thought I had done with Mr Skelton for, at all events, the space of
one year. Not so, however. When I came out from the Girls' School, I
found him waiting at the door.</p>

<p>Profusely apologizing, he begged leave to occupy five minutes of
my valuable time. He wished, under correction, to suggest a little
improvement. The boys, he said, were allowed to play in the
quadrangle, which was too small, and in various ways inconvenient;
but round at the back there was a piece of waste land, half an acre
of which, if enclosed, would admirably answer the purpose. So saying,
he led the way to the back of the building, and I followed him.</p>

<p>'To whom does this ground belong?' I asked.</p>

<p>'To Mr Wolstenholme, sir.'</p>

<p>'Then why not apply to Mr Wolstenholme? He gave the schools, and I
dare say he would be equally willing to give the ground.'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, sir. Mr Wolstenholme has not been over here
since his return, and it is quite possible that he may leave Pit End
without honouring us with a visit. I could not take the liberty of
writing to him, sir.'</p>

<p>'Neither could I in my report suggest that the Government should
offer to purchase a portion of Mr Wolstenholme's land for a
playground to schools of Mr Wolstenholme's own building.' I replied.
'Under other circumstances'.</p>

<p>I stopped and looked round.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster repeated my last words.</p>

<p>'You were saying, sir-under other circumstances?'</p>

<p>I looked round again.</p>

<p>'It seemed to me that there was someone here,' I said; 'some third
person, not a moment ago.'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, sir-a third person?'</p>

<p>'I saw his shadow on the ground, between yours and mine.'</p>

<p>The schools faced due north, and we were standing immediately
behind the buildings, with our backs to the sun. The place was bare,
and open, and high; and our shadows, sharply defined, lay stretched
before our feet.</p>

<p>'A-a shadow?' he faltered. 'Impossible.'</p>

<p>There was not a bush or a tree within half a mile. There was not a
cloud in the sky. There was nothing, absolutely nothing, that could
have cast a shadow.</p>

<p>I admitted that it was impossible, and that I must have fancied
it; and so went back to the matter of the playground..'Should you see
Mr Wolstenholme,' I said, 'you are at liberty to say that I thought
it a desirable improvement.'</p>

<p>'I am much obliged to you, sir. Thank you-thank you very much,' he
said, cringing at every word. 'But-but I had hoped that you might
perhaps use your influence'-'Look there!' I interrupted. 'Is that
fancy?'</p>

<p>We were now close under the blank wall of the boys' schoolroom. On
this wall, lying to the full sunlight, our shadows-mine and the
schoolmaster's-were projected. And there, too-no longer between his
and mine, but a little way apart, as if the intruder were standing
back-there, as sharply defined as if cast by lime-light on a prepared
background, I again distinctly saw, though but for a moment, that
third shadow. As I spoke, as I looked round, it was gone!</p>

<p>'Did you not see it?' I asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>'I-I saw nothing,' he said, faintly. 'What was it?'</p>

<p>His lips were white. He seemed scarcely able to stand.</p>

<p>'But you must have seen it!' I exclaimed. 'It fell just
there-where that bit of ivy grows. There must be some boy hiding-it
was a boy's shadow, I am confident.'</p>

<p>'A boy's shadow!' he echoed, looking round in a wild, frightened
way. 'There is no place-for a boy-to hide.'</p>

<p>'Place or no place,' I said, angrily, 'if I catch him, he shall
feel the weight of my cane!'</p>

<p>I searched backwards and forwards in event direction, the
schoolmaster, with his scared face, limping at my heels; but, rough
and irregular as the ground was, there was not a hole in it big
enough to shelter a rabbit.</p>

<p>'But what was it?' I said, impatiently.</p>

<p>'An-an illusion. Begging your pardon, sir-an illusion.'</p>

<p>He looked so like a beaten hound, so frightened, so fawning, that
I felt I could with lively satisfaction have transferred the
threatened caning to his own shoulders.</p>

<p>'But you saw it?' I said again.</p>

<p>'No, sir. Upon my honour, no, sir. I saw nothing-nothing
whatever.'</p>

<p>His looks belied his words. I felt positive that he had not only
seen the shadow, but that he knew more about it than he chose to
tell. I was by this time really angry. To be made the object of a
boyish trick, and to be hoodwinked by the connivance of the
schoolmaster, was too much. It was an insult to myself and my
office.</p>

<p>I scarcely knew what I said; something short and stern at all
events. Then, having said it, I turned my back upon Mr Skelton and
the schools, and walked rapidly back to the village.</p>

<p>As I neared the bottom of the hill, a dog-cart drawn by a
high-stepping chestnut dashed up to the door of the 'Greyhound', and
the next moment I was shaking hands with Wolstenholme, of Balliol.
Wolstenholme, of Balliol, as handsome as ever, dressed with the same
careless dandyism, looking not a day older than when I last saw him
at Oxford! He gripped me by both hands, vowed that I was his guest
for the next three days, and insisted on carrying me off at once to
Backwater Chase. In vain I urged that I had two schools to inspect
tomorrow ten miles the other side of Drumley; that I had a horse and
trap waiting; and that my room was ordered at the 'Feathers'.
Wolstenholme laughed away my objections.</p>

<p>My dear fellow,' he said, 'you will simply send your horse and
trap back with a message to the "Feathers", and a couple of telegrams
to be dispatched to the two schools from Drumley station.</p>

<p>Unforeseen circumstances compel you to defer those inspections
till next week!'.And with this, in his masterful way, he shouted to
the landlord to send my portmanteau up to the manor-house, pushed me
up before him into the dog-cart, gave the chestnut his head, and
rattled me off to Backwater Chase.</p>

<p>It was a gloomy old barrack of a place, standing high in the midst
of a sombre deer-park some six or seven miles in circumference. An
avenue of oaks, now leafless, led up to the house; and a mournful
heron-haunted tarn in the loneliest part of the park gave to the
estate its name of Blackwater Chase. The place, in fact, was more
like a border fastness than an English north-country mansion.
Wolstenholme took me through the picture gallery and reception rooms
after luncheon, and then for a canter round the park; and in the
evening we dined at the upper end of a great oak hall hung with
antlers, and armour, and antiquated weapons of warfare and sport.</p>

<p>'Now, tomorrow,' said my host, as we sat over our claret in front
of a blazing log-fire; 'tomorrow, if we have decent weather, you
shall have a day's shooting on the moors; and on Friday, if you will
but be persuaded to stay a day longer, I will drive you over to
Broomhead and give you a run with the Duke's hounds. Not hunt? My
dear fellow, what nonsense! All our parsons hunt in this part of the
world. By the way, have you ever been down a coal pit? No?</p>

<p>Then a new experience awaits you. I'll take you down Carshalton
shaft, and show you the home of the gnomes and trolls.'</p>

<p>'Is Carshalton one of your own mines?' I asked.</p>

<p>'All these pits are mine,' he replied. 'I am king of Hades, and
rule the under world as well as the upper. There is coal everywhere
underlying these moors. The whole place is honeycombed with shafts
and galleries. One of our richest seams runs under this house, and
there are upwards of forty men at work in it a quarter of a mile
below our feet here every day. Another leads right away under the
park, heaven only knows how far! My father began working it
five-and-twenty years ago, and we have gone on working it ever since;
yet it shows no sign of failing.'</p>

<p>'You must be as rich as a prince with a fairy godmother!'</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said, lightly, 'I am rich enough to commit what follies
I please; and that is saying a good deal. But then, to be always
squandering money-always rambling about the world--always gratifying
the impulse of the moment-is that happiness? I have been trying the
experiment for the last ten years; and with what result? Would you
like to see?'</p>

<p>He snatched up a lamp and led the way through a long suite of
unfurnished rooms, the floors of which were piled high with packing
cases of all sizes and shapes, labelled with the names of various
foreign ports and the addresses of foreign agents innumerable. What
did they contain?</p>

<p>Precious marbles from Italy and Greece and Asia Minor; priceless
paintings by old and modern masters; antiquities from the Nile, the
Tigris, and the Euphrates; enamels from Persia, porcelain from China,
bronzes from Japan, strange sculptures from Peru; arms, mosaics,
ivories, wood-carvings, skins, tapestries, old Italian cabinets,
painted bride-chests, Etruscan terracottas; treasures of all
countries, of all ages, never even unpacked since they crossed that
threshold which the master's foot had crossed but twice during the
ten years it had taken to buy them!</p>

<p>Should he ever open them, ever arrange them, ever enjoy them?
Perhaps-if he became weary of wandering-if he married-if he built a
gallery to receive them. If not-well, he might found and endow a
museum; or leave the things to the nation. What did it matter?
Collecting was like fox-hunting; the pleasure was in the pursuit, and
ended with it!</p>

<p>We sat up late that first night, I can hardly say conversing, for
Wolstenholme did the talking, while I, willing to be amused, led him
on to tell me something of his wanderings by land and sea.</p>

<p>So the time passed in stories of adventure, of perilous peaks
ascended, of deserts traversed, of unknown ruins explored, of
'hairbreadth 'scapes' from icebergs and earthquakes and storms; and
when at last he flung the end of his cigar into the fire and
discovered that it was time to go to bed, the clock on the
mantel-shelf pointed far on among the small hours of the morning.</p>

<p>Next day, according to the programme made out for my
entertainment, we did some seven hours' partridge-shooting on the
moors; and the day next following I was to go down Carshalton shaft
before breakfast, and after breakfast ride over to a place some
fifteen miles distant called Picts' Camp, there to see a stone circle
and the ruins of a prehistoric fort.</p>

<p>Unused to field sports, I slept heavily after those seven hours
with the guns, and was slow to wake when Wolstenholme's valet came
next morning to my bedside with the waterproof suit in which I was to
effect my descent into Hades.</p>

<p>'Mr Wolstenholme says, sir, that you had better not take your bath
till you come back,' said this gentlemanly vassal, disposing the
ungainly garments across the back of a chair as artistically as if he
were laying out my best evening suit. 'And you will be pleased to
dress warmly underneath the waterproofs, for it is very chilly in the
mine.'</p>

<p>I surveyed the garments with reluctance. The morning was frosty,
and the prospect of being lowered into the bowels of the earth, cold,
tasting, and unwashed, was anything but attractive.</p>

<p>Should I send word that I would rather not go? I hesitated; but
while I was hesitating, the gentlemanly valet vanished, and my
opportunity was lost. Grumbling and shivering, I got up, donned the
cold and shiny suit, and went downstairs.</p>

<p>A murmur of voices met my ear as I drew near the breakfast-room.
Going in, I found some ten or a dozen stalwart colliers grouped near
the door, and Wolstenholme, looking somewhat serious, standing with
his back to the fire.</p>

<p>'Look here, Frazer,' he said, with a short laugh, 'here's a
pleasant piece of news. A fissure has opened in the bed of Blackwater
tarn; the lake has disappeared in the night; and the mine is flooded!
No Carshalton shaft for you today!'</p>

<p>'Seven foot o' wayter in Jukes's seam, an' eight in th' owd north
and south galleries,' growled a huge red-headed fellow, who seemed to
be the spokesman.</p>

<p>'An' it's the Lord's own marcy a' happened o' noight-time, or we'd
be dead men all,' added another.</p>

<p>'That's true, my man,' said Wolstenholme, answering the last
speaker. 'It might have drowned you like rats in a trap; so we may
thank our stars it's no worse. And now, to work with the pumps! Lucky
for us that we know what to do, and how to do it.'</p>

<p>So saying, he dismissed the men with a good-humoured nod, and an
order for unlimited ale.</p>

<p>I listened in blank amazement. The tarn vanished! I could not
believe it. Wolstenholme assured me, however, that it was by no means
a solitary phenomenon. Rivers had been known to disappear before now,
in mining districts; and sometimes, instead of merely cracking, the
ground would cave in, burying not merely houses, but whole hamlets in
one common ruin. The foundations of such houses were, however,
generally known to be insecure long enough before the crash came; and
these accidents were not therefore often followed by loss of
life.</p>

<p>'And now,' he said, lightly, 'you may doff your fancy costume; for
I shall have time this morning for nothing but business. It is not
every day that one loses a lake, and has to pump it up again!'</p>

<p>Breakfast over, we went round to the mouth of the pit, and saw the
men fixing the pumps.</p>

<p>Later on, when the work was fairly in train, we started off across
the park to view the scene of the catastrophe. Our way lay far from
the house across a wooded upland, beyond which we followed a broad
glade leading to the tarn. Just as we entered this glade-Wolstenholme
rattling on and turning the whole affair into jest-a tall, slender
lad, with a fishing-rod across his shoulder, came out from one of the
side paths to the right, crossed the open at a long slant, and
disappeared among the tree-trunks on the opposite side. I recognized
him instantly. It was the boy whom I saw the other day, just after
meeting the schoolmaster in the meadow.</p>

<p>'If that boy thinks he is going to fish in your tarn,' I said, 'he
will find out his mistake.'</p>

<p>'What boy?' asked Wolstenholme, looking back.</p>

<p>'That boy who crossed over yonder, a minute ago.'</p>

<p>'Yonder!-in front of us?'</p>

<p>'Certainly. You must have seen him?'</p>

<p>'Not I.'</p>

<p>'You did not see him?-a tall, thin boy, in a grey suit, with a
fishing-rod over his shoulder. He disappeared behind those Scotch
firs.'</p>

<p>Wolstenholme looked at me with surprise.</p>

<p>'You are dreaming!' he said. 'No living thing-not even a
rabbit-has crossed our path since we entered the park gates.'</p>

<p>'I am not in the habit of dreaming with my eyes open,' I replied,
quickly.</p>

<p>He laughed, and put his arm through mine.</p>

<p>'Eyes or no eyes,' he said, 'you are under an illusion this
time!'</p>

<p>An illusion-the very word made use of by the schoolmaster! What
did it mean? Could I, in truth, no longer rely upon the testimony of
my senses? A thousand half-formed apprehensions flashed across me in
a moment. I remembered the illusions of Nicolini, the bookseller, and
other similar cases of visual hallucination, and I asked myself if I
had suddenly become afflicted in like manner.</p>

<p>'By Jove! this is a queer sight!' exclaimed Wolstenholme. And then
I found that we had emerged from the glade, and were looking down
upon the bed of what yesterday was Blackwater Tarn.</p>

<p>It was indeed a queer sight-an oblong, irregular basin of blackest
slime, with here and there a sullen pool, and round the margin an
irregular fringe of bulrushes. At some little distance along the
bank-less than a quarter of a mile from where we were standing-a
gaping crowd had gathered. All Pit End, except the men at the pumps,
seemed o have turned out to stare at the bed of the vanished
tarn.</p>

<p>Hats were pulled off and curtsies dropped at Wolstenholme's
approach. He, meanwhile, came up smiling, with a pleasant word for
everyone.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said, 'are you looking for the lake, my friends? You'll
have in go down Carshalton shaft to find it! It's an ugly sight
you've come to sue, anyhow!'</p>

<p>'Tes an ugly soight, squoire,' replied a stalwart blacksmith in a
leathern apron; 'but thar's summat uglier, mebbe, than the mud, ow'r
yonder.'</p>

<p>'Something uglier than the mud?' Wolstenholme repeated.</p>

<p>'Wull yo be pleased to stan' this way, squoire, an' look strite
across at yon little tump o' bulrashes-doan't yo see nothin'?'</p>

<p>I see a log of rotten timber sticking half in and half out of the
mud,' said Wolstenholme; 'and something-a long reed, apparently...by
love! I believe it's a fishing rod!'</p>

<p>'It is a fishin' rod, squoire,' said the blacksmith with rough
carnesmess; 'an' if yon rotten timber bayn't an unburied corpse, mun
I never stroike hammer on anvil agin!'</p>

<p>There was a buzz of acquiescence from the bystanders. 'Twas an
unburied corpse, sure enough. Nobody doubted it..Wolstenholme made a
funnel with his hands, and looked through it long and
steadfastly.</p>

<p>'It must come out, whatever it is,' he said presently. 'Five feet
of mud, do you say? Then here's a sovereign apiece for the first two
fellows who wade through it and bring that object to land!'</p>

<p>The blacksmith and another pulled off their shoes and stockings,
turned up their trousers, and went in at once.</p>

<p>They were over their ankles at the first plunge, and, sounding
their way with sticks, went deeper at every tread. As they sank, our
excitement rose. Presently they were visible from only the waist
upwards. We could see their chests heaving, and the muscular efforts
by which each step was gained. They were yet full twenty yards from
the goal when the mud mounted to their armpits...a few feet more, and
only their heads would remain above the surface!</p>

<p>An uneasy movement ran through the crowd.</p>

<p>'Call 'em back, for God's sake!' cried a woman's voice.</p>

<p>But at this moment-having reached a point where the ground
gradually sloped upwards-they began to rise above the mud as rapidly
as they had sunk into it. And now, black with clotted slime, they
emerge waist-high...now they are within three or four yards of the
spot...and now...now they are there!</p>

<p>They part the reeds-they stoop low above the shapeless object on
which all eyes are turned--they half-lift it from its bed of mud-they
hesitate-lay it down again-decide, apparently, to leave it there; and
turn their faces shorewards. Having come a few paces, the blacksmith
remembers the fishing-rod; turns back; disengages the tangled line
with some difficulty, and brings it over his shoulder.</p>

<p>They had not much to tell-standing, all mud from head to heel, on
dry land again-but that little was conclusive. It was, in truth, an
unburied corpse; part of the trunk only above the surface. They tried
to lift it; but it had been so long under water, and was in so
advanced a stage of decomposition, that to bring it to shore without
a shutter was impossible. Being cross-questioned, they thought, from
the slenderness of the form, that it must be the body of a boy.</p>

<p>'Thar's the poor chap's rod, anyhow,' said the blacksmith, laying
it gently down upon the turf.</p>

<p>I have thus far related events as I witnessed them. Here, however,
my responsibility ceases. I give the rest of my story at second-hand,
briefly, as I received it some weeks later, in the following letter
from Philip Wolstenholme:</p>

<p>'Blackwater Chase, Dec. 20th, 18-.</p>

<p>Dear Frazer, My promised letter has been a long time on the road,
but I did not see the use of writing till I had something definite to
tell you. I think, however, we have now found out all that we are
ever likely to know about the tragedy in the tarn; and it seems
that-but, no; I will begin at the beginning. That is to say, with the
day you left the Chase, which was the day following the discovery of
the body.</p>

<p>You were but just gone when a police inspector arrived from
Drumley (you will remember that I had immediately sent a man over to
the sitting magistrate); but neither the inspector nor anyone else
could do anything till the remains were brought to shore, and it took
us the best part of a week to accomplish this difficult operation. We
had to sink no end of big stones in order to make a rough and ready
causeway across the mud. This done, the body was brought over
decently upon a shutter. It proved to be the corpse of a boy of
perhaps fourteen or fifteen years of age.</p>

<p>There was a fracture three inches long at the back of the skull,
evidently fatal. This might, of course, have been an accidental
injury; but when the body came to be raised from where it lay, it was
found to be pinned down by a pitchfork, the handle of which had been
afterwards whittled off, so as not to show above the water, a
discovery tantamount to evidence of murder. The features of the
victim were decomposed beyond recognition; but enough of the hair
remained to show that it had been short and sandy As for the
clothing, it was a mere mass of rotten shreds; but on being subjected
to some chemical process, proved to have once been a suit of lightish
grey cloth.</p>

<p>A crowd of witnesses came forward at this stage of the inquiry-for
I am now giving you the main facts as they came out at the coroner's
inquest-to prove that about a year or thirteen months ago, Skelton
the schoolmaster had staying with him a lad whom he called his
nephew, and to whom it was supposed that he was not particularly
kind. This lad was described as tall, thin, mud sandy-haired. He
habitually wore a suit corresponding in colour and texture to the
shreds of clothing discovered on the body in the tarn; and he was
much addicted to angling about the pools and streams, wherever he
might have the chance of a nibble.</p>

<p>And now one thing led quickly on to another. Our Pit End shoemaker
identified the boy's boots as being a pair of his own making and
selling. Other witnesses testified to angry scenes between the uncle
and nephew. Finally, Skelton gave himself up to justice, confessed
the deed, and was duly committed to Drumley gaol for wilful
murder.</p>

<p>And the motive? Well, the motive is the strangest part of my
story. The wretched lad was, after all, not Skelton's nephew, but
Skelton's own illegitimate son. The mother was dead, and the boy
lived with his maternal grandmother in a remote part of Cumberland.
The old woman was poor, and the schoolmaster made her an annual
allowance for his son's keep and clothing. He had not seen the boy
for some years, when he sent for him to come over on a visit to Pit
End. Perhaps he was weary of the tax upon his purse. Perhaps, as he
himself puts it in his confession, he was disappointed to find the
boy, if not actually half-witted, stupid, wilful, and ill brought-up.
He at all events took a dislike to the poor brute, which dislike by
and by developed into positive hatred.</p>

<p>Some amount of provocation there would seem to have been. The boy
was as backward as a child of five years old. That Skelton put him
into the Boys' School, and could do nothing with him; that he defied
discipline, had a passion for fishing, and was continually wandering
about the country with his rod and line, are facts borne out by the
independent testimony of various witnesses. Having hidden his
fishing-tackle, he was in the habit of slipping away at school-hours,
and showed himself the more cunning and obstinate the more he was
punished.</p>

<p>At last there came a day when Skelton tracked him to the place
where his rod was concealed, and thence across the meadows into the
park, and as far as the tarn. His (Skelton's) account of what
followed is wandering and confused. He owns to having beaten the
miserable lad about the head and arms with a heavy stick that he had
brought with him for the purpose; but denies that he intended to
murder him. When his son fell insensible and ceased to breathe, he
for the first time realized the force of the blows he had dealt. He
admits that his first impulse was one, not of remorse for the deed,
but of fear for his own safety. He dragged the body in among the
bulrushes by the water's edge, and there concealed it as well as he
could. At night, when the neighbours were in bed and asleep, he stole
out by starlight, taking with him a pitchfork, a coil of rope, a
couple of old iron-bars, and a knife. Thus laden, he struck out
across the moor, and entered the park by a stile and footpath on the
Stoneleigh side; so making a circuit of between three and four miles.
A rotten old punt used at that time to be kept on the tarn. He loosed
this punt from its moorings, brought it round, hauled in the body,
and paddled his ghastly burden out into the middle of the lake as far
as a certain clump of reeds which he had noted as a likely spot for
his purpose. Here he weighted and sunk the corpse, and pinned it down
by the neck with his pitchfork. He then cut away the handle of the
fork; hid the fishing-rod among the reeds; and believed, as murderers
always believe, that discovery was impossible. As regarded the Pit
End folk, he simply gave out that his nephew had gone back to
Cumberland; and no one doubted it.</p>

<p>Now, however, he says that accident has only anticipated him; and
that he was on the point of voluntarily confessing his crime. His
dreadful secret had of late become intolerable. He was haunted by an
invisible Presence. That Presence sat with him at table, followed him
in his walks stood behind him in the school-room, and watched by his
bedside. He never saw it; but he felt that it was always there.
Sometimes he raves of a shadow on the wall of his cell. The gaol
authorities are of opinion that he is of unsound mind.</p>

<p>I have now told you all that there is at present to tell. The
trial will not take place till the spring assizes. In the meanwhile I
am off tomorrow to Paris, and thence, in about ten days, on to Nice,
where letters will find me at the Hotel des Empereurs.</p>

<p>Always, dear Frazer.</p>

<p>Yours, e., c..</p>

<p>P. W.</p>

<p>P.S.-Since writing the above, I have received a telegram from
Drumley to say that Skelton has committed suicide. No particulars
given. So ends this strange eventful history.</p>

<p>By the way, that was a curious illusion of yours the other day
when we were crossing the park; and I have thought of it many times.
Was it an illusion?-that is the question.'</p>

<p>Ay, indeed! that is the question; and it is a question which I
have never yet been able to answer.</p>

<p>Certain things I undoubtedly saw-with my mind's eye, perhaps-and
as I saw them, I have described them; withholding nothing, adding
nothing, explaining nothing. Let those solve the mystery who can. For
myself, I but echo Wolstenholme's question: Was it an illusion?</p>

<h2><a name="ch6"></a>How the Third Floor Knew the Potteries</h2>

<p>I am a plain man, Major, and you may not dislike to hear a plain
statement of facts from me.</p>

<p>Some of those facts lie beyond my understanding. I do not pretend
to explain them. I only know that they happened as I relate them, and
that I pledge myself for the truth of every word of them.</p>

<p>I began life roughly enough, down among the Potteries. I was an
orphan; and my earliest recollections are of a great porcelain
manufactory in the country of the Potteries, where I helped about the
yard, picked up what halfpence fell in my way, and slept in a
harness-loft over the stable. Those were hard times; but things
bettered themselves as I grew older and stronger, especially after
George Barnard had come to be foreman of the yard.</p>

<p>George Barnard was a Wesleyan--we were mostly dissenters in the
Potteries--sober, clear-headed, somewhat sulky and silent, but a good
fellow every inch of him, and my best friend at the time when I most
needed a good friend. He took me out of the yard, and set me to the
furnace-work. He entered me on the books at a fixed rate of wages. He
helped me to pay for a little cheap schooling four nights a week; and
he led me to go with him on Sundays to the chapel down by the
river-side, where I first saw Leah Payne. She was his sweetheart, and
so pretty that I used to forget the preacher and everybody else, when
I looked at her. When she joined in the singing, I heard no voice but
hers. If she asked me for the hymn-book, I used to blush and tremble.
I believe I worshipped her, in my stupid ignorant way; and I think I
worshipped Barnard almost as blindly, though after a different
fashion. I felt I owed him everything. I knew that he had saved rue,
body and mind; and I looked up to him as a savage might look up to a
missionary.</p>

<p>Leah was the daughter of a plumber, who lived close by the chapel.
She was twenty, and George about seven or eight-and-thirty. Some
captious folks said there was too much difference in their ages; but
she was so serious-minded, and they loved each other so earnestly and
quietly, that, if nothing had come between them during their
courtship, I don't believe the question of disparity would ever have
troubled the happiness of their married lives. Something did come,
however; and that something was a Frenchman, called Louis Laroche. He
was a painter on porcelain, from the famous works at S&egrave;vres;
and our master, it was said, had engaged him for three years certain,
at such wages as none of our own people, however skilful, could hope
to command. It was about the beginning or middle of September when he
first came among us. He looked very young; was small, dark, and well
made; had little white soft hands, and a silky moustache; and spoke
English nearly as well as I do. None of us liked him; but that was
only natural, seeing how he was put over the head of every Englishman
in the place. Besides, though he was always smiling and civil, we
couldn't help seeing that he thought himself ever so much better than
the rest of us; and that was not pleasant. Neither was it pleasant to
see him strolling about the town, dressed just like a gentleman, when
working hours were over; smoking good cigars, when we were forced to
be content with a pipe of common tobacco; hiring a horse on Sunday
afternoons, when we were trudging a-foot; and taking his pleasure as
if the world was made for him to enjoy, and us to work in.</p>

<p>"Ben, boy," said George, "there's something wrong about that
Frenchman."</p>

<p>It was on a Saturday afternoon, and we were sitting on a pile of
empty seggars against the door of my furnace-room, waiting till the
men should all have cleared out of the yard. Seggars are deep earthen
boxes in which the pottery is put, while being fired in the kiln. I
looked up, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"About the Count?" said I, for that was the nickname by which he
went in the pottery.</p>

<p>George nodded, and paused for a moment with his chin resting on
his palms.</p>

<p>"He has an evil eye," said he; "and a false smile. Something wrong
about him."</p>

<p>I drew nearer, and listened to George as if he had been an oracle.
"Besides," added he, in his slow quiet way, with his eyes fixed
straight before him as if he was thinking aloud, "there's a young
look about him that isn't natural. Take him just at sight, and you'd
think he was almost a boy; but look close at him--see the little fine
wrinkles under his eyes, and the hard lines about his mouth, and then
tell me his age, if you can! Why, Ben boy, he's as old as I am,
pretty near; ay, and as strong, too. You stare; but I tell you that,
slight as he looks, he could fling you over his shoulder as if you
were a feather. And as for his hands, little and white as they are,
there are muscles of iron inside them, take my word for it."</p>

<p>"But, George, how can you know?"</p>

<p>"Because I have a warning against him," replied George, very
gravely. "Because, whenever he is by, I feel as if my eyes saw
clearer, and my ears heard keener, than at other times. Maybe it's
presumption, but I sometimes feel as if I had a call to guard myself
and others against him. Look at the children, Ben, how they shrink
away from him; and see there, now! Ask Captain what he thinks of him!
Ben, that dog likes him no better than I do."</p>

<p>I looked, and saw Captain crouching by his kennel with his ears
laid back, growling audibly, as the Frenchman came slowly down the
steps leading from his own workshop at the upper end of the yard. On
the last step he paused; lighted a cigar; glanced round, as if to see
whether anyone was by; and then walked straight over to within a
couple of yards of the kennel. Captain gave a short angry snarl, and
laid his muzzle close clown upon his paws, ready for a spring. The
Frenchman folded his arms deliberately, fixed his eyes on the dog,
and stood calmly smoking.</p>

<p>He knew exactly how far he dared go, and kepi just that one foot
out of harm's way. All at once he stooped, puffed a mouthful of smoke
in the dog's eyes, burst into a mocking laugh, turned lightly on his
heel, and walked away; leaving Captain straining at his chain, and
barking after him like a mad creature.</p>

<p>Days went by, and I, at work in my own department, saw no more of
the Count. Sunday came--the third, I think, after I had talked with
George in the yard. Going with George to chapel, as usual, in the
morning, I noticed that there was something strange and anxious in
his voice, and that he scarcely opened his lips to me on the way.
Still I said nothing. It was not my place to question him; and I
remember thinking to myself that the cloud would all clear off as
soon as he found himself by Leah's side, holding the same book, and
joining in the same hymn.</p>

<p>It did not, however, for no Leah was there. I looked every moment
to the door, expecting to see her sweet face coming in; but George
never lifted his eyes from his book, or seemed to notice that her
place was empty. Thus the whole service went by, and my thoughts
wandered continually from the words of the preacher. As soon as the
last blessing was spoken, and we were fairly across the threshold, I
turned to George, and asked if Leah was ill?</p>

<p>"No," said he, gloomily. "She's not ill."</p>

<p>"Then why wasn't she--?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why," he interrupted, impatiently. "Because you've
seen her here for the last time. She's never coming to chapel
again."</p>

<p>"Never coming to the chapel again?" I faltered, laying my hand on
his sleeve in the earnestness of my surprise. "Why, George, what is
the matter?"</p>

<p>But he shook my hand off and stamped with his iron heel till the
pavement rang again.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," said he, roughly. "Let me alone. You'll know soon
enough."</p>

<p>And with this he turned off down a by-lane leading towards the
hills, and left me without another word.</p>

<p>I had had plenty of hard treatment in my time; but never, until
that moment, an angry look or syllable from George. I did not know
how to bear it. That day my dinner seemed as if it would choke me;
and in the afternoon I went out and wandered restlessly about the
fields till the hour for evening prayers came round. I then returned
to the chapel, and sat down on a tomb outside, waiting for George. I
saw the congregation go in by twos and threes; I heard the first
psalm-tune echo solemnly through the evening stillness; but no George
came. Then the service began, and I knew that, punctual as his habits
were, it was of no use to expect him any longer. Where could he be?
What could have happened? Why should Leah Payne never come to chapel
again? Had she gone over to some other sect, and was that why George
seemed so unhappy?</p>

<p>Sitting there in the little dreary churchyard with the darkness
fast gathering around me, I asked myself these questions over and
over again, till my brain ached; for I was not much used to thinking
about anything in those times. At last, I could bear to sit quiet no
longer. The sudden thought struck me that I would go to Leah, and
learn what the matter was, from her own lips. I sprang to my feet,
and set off at once towards her home.</p>

<p>It was quite dark, and a light rain was beginning to fall. I found
the garden-gate open, and a quick hope flashed across me that George
might be there. I drew back for a moment, hesitating whether to knock
or ring, when a sound of voices in the passage, and the sudden
gleaming of a bright line of light under the door, warned me that
someone was coming out. Taken by surprise, and quite unprepared for
the moment with anything to say, I shrank back behind the porch, and
waited until those within should have passed out. The door opened,
and the light streamed suddenly upon the roses and the wet
gravel.</p>

<p>"It rains," said Leah, bending forward and shading the candle with
her hand.</p>

<p>"And is as cold as Siberia," added another voice, which was not
George's, and yet sounded strangely familiar. "Ugh! what a climate
for such a flower as my darling to bloom in!"</p>

<p>"Is it so much finer in France?" asked Leah, softly.</p>

<p>"As much finer as blue skies and sunshine can make it. Why, my
angel, even your bright eyes will be ten times brighter, and your
rosy cheeks ten times rosier, when they are transplanted to Paris. Ah
I I can give you no idea of the wonders of Paris--the broad streets
planted with trees, the palaces, the shops, the gardens!--it is a
city of enchantment."</p>

<p>"It must be, indeed!" said Leah. "And you will really take me to
see all those beautiful shops?"</p>

<p>"Every Sunday, my darling--Bah! don't look so shocked. The shops
in Paris are always open on Sunday, and everybody makes holiday. You
will soon get over these prejudices."</p>

<p>"I fear it is very wrong to take so much pleasure in the things of
this world," sighed Leah.</p>

<p>The Frenchman laughed, and answered her with a kiss.</p>

<p>"Good night, my sweet little saint!" and he ran lightly down the
path, and disappeared in the darkness. Leah sighed again, lingered a
moment, and then closed the door.</p>

<p>Stupefied and bewildered, I stood for some seconds like a stone
statue, unable to move; scarcely able to think. At length, I roused
myself, as it were mechanically, and went towards the gate. At that
instant a heavy hand was laid upon my shoulder, and a hoarse voice
close beside my ear, said:</p>

<p>"Who are you? What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>It was George. I knew him at once, in spite of the darkness, and
stammered his name. He took his hand quickly from my shoulder.</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?" said he, fiercely. "What right have
you to lurk about, like a spy in the dark? God help me, Ben--I'm half
mad. I don't mean to be harsh to you."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you don't," I cried, earnestly.</p>

<p>"It's that cursed Frenchman," he went on, in a voice that sounded
like the groan of one in pain.</p>

<p>"He's a villain. I know he's a villain; and I've had a warning
against him ever since the first moment he came among us. He'll make
her miserable, and break her heart some day--my pretty Leah--and I
loved her so! But I'll be revenged--as sure as there's a sun in
heaven, I'll be revenged!"</p>

<p>His vehemence terrified me. I tried to persuade him to go home;
but he would not listen to me.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said. "Go home yourself, boy, and let me be. My blood
is on fire: this rain is good for me, and I am better alone."</p>

<p>"If I could only do something to help you--"</p>

<p>"You can't," interrupted he. "Nobody can help me. I'm a ruined
man, and I don't care what becomes of me. The Lord forgive me I my
heart is full of wickedness, and my thoughts are the promptings of
Satan. There go--for Heaven's sake, go. I don't know what I say, or
what I do!"</p>

<p>I went, for I did not dare refuse any longer; but I lingered a
while at the corner of the street, and watched him pacing to and fro,
to and fro in the driving rain. At length I turned reluctantly away,
and went home.</p>

<p>I lay awake that night for hours, thinking over the events of the
day, and hating the Frenchman from my very soul. I could not hate
Leah. I had worshipped her too long and too faithfully for that; but
I looked upon her as a creature given over to destruction. I fell
asleep towards morning, and woke again shortly after daybreak. When I
reached the pottery, I found George there before me, looking very
pale, but quite himself, and setting the men to their work the same
as usual. I said nothing about what had happened the day before.
Something in his face silenced me; but seeing him so steady and
composed, I took heart, and began to hope he had fought through the
worst of his trouble. By-and-by the Frenchman came through the yard,
gay and off-hand, with his cigar in his mouth, and his hands in his
pockets. George turned sharply away into one of the workshops, and
shut the door. I drew a deep breath of relief. My dread was to see
them come to an open quarrel; and I felt that as long as they kept
clear of that, all would be well.</p>

<p>Thus the Monday went by, and the Tuesday; and still George kept
aloof from mc. I had sense enough not to be hurt by this. I felt he
had a good right to be silent, if silence helped him to bear his
trial better; and I made up my mind never to breathe another syllable
on the subject, unless he began.</p>

<p>Wednesday came. I had overslept myself that morning, and came to
work a quarter after the hour, expecting to be fined; for George was
very strict as foreman of the yard, and treated friends and enemies
just the same. Instead of blaming me, however, he called me up, and
said:</p>

<p>"Ben, whose turn is it this week to sit up?"</p>

<p>"Mine, sir," I replied. (I always called him "Sir" in working
hours.)</p>

<p>"Well, then, you may go home to-day, and the same on Thursday and
Friday; for there's a large batch of work for the ovens to-night, and
there'll be the same to-morrow night and the night after."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said I. "Then I'll be here by seven this
evening."</p>

<p>"No, half-past nine will be soon enough. I've some accounts to
make up, and I shall be here myself till then. Mind you are true to
time, though."</p>

<p>"I'll be as true as the clock, sir," I replied, and was turning
away when he called me back again.</p>

<p>"You're a good lad, Ben," said he. "Shake hands."</p>

<p>I seized his hand, and pressed it warmly.</p>

<p>"If I'm good for anything, George," I answered with all my heart,
"it's you who have made me so. God bless you for it!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" said he, in a troubled voice, putting his hand to his
hat.</p>

<p>And so we parted.</p>

<p>In general, I went to bed by day when I was attending to the
firing by night; but this morning I had already slept longer than
usual, and wanted exercise more than rest. So I ran home; put a bit
of bread and meat in my pocket; snatched up my big thorn stick; and
started off for a long day in the country. When I came home, it was
quite dark and beginning to rain, just as it had begun to rain at
about the same time that wretched Sunday evening: so I changed my wet
boots, had an early supper and a nap in the chimney-corner, and went
down to the works at a few minutes before half-past nine. Arriving at
the factory-gate, I found it ajar, and so walked in and closed it
after me. I remember thinking at the time that it was unlike George's
usual caution to leave it so but it passed from my mind next moment.
Having slipped in the bolt, I then went straight over to George's
little counting-house, where the gas was shining cheerfully in the
window. Here also, somewhat to my surprise, I found the door open,
and the room empty. I went in. The threshold and part of the floor
was wetted by the driving rain. The wages-book was open on the desk,
George's pen stood in the ink, and his hat hung on its usual peg in
the corner. I concluded, of course, that he had gone round to the
ovens; so, following him, I took down his hat and carried it with me,
for it was now raining fast.</p>

<p>The baking-houses lay just opposite, on the other side of the
yard. There were three of them, opening one out of the other; and in
each, the great furnace filled all the middle of the room.</p>

<p>These furnaces are, in fact, large kilns built of brick, with an
oven closed in by an iron door in the centre of each, and a chimney
going up through the roof. The pottery, enclosed in seggars, stands
round inside on shelves, and has to be turned from time to time while
the firing is going on. To turn these seggars, test the heat, and
keep the fires up, was my work at the period of which I am now
telling you, Major.</p>

<p>Well! I went through the baking-houses one after the other, and
found all empty alike. Then a strange, vague, uneasy feeling came
over me, and I began to wonder what could have become of George. It
was possible that he might be in one of the workshops; so I ran over
to the counting-house, lighted a lantern, and made a thorough survey
of the yards. I tried the doors; they were all locked as usual. I
peeped into the open sheds; they were all vacant. I called "George!
George!" in every part of the outer premises; but the wind and rain
drove back my voice, and no other voice replied to it. Forced at last
to believe that he was really gone, I took his hat back to the
counting-house, put away the wages-book, extinguished the gas, and
prepared for my solitary watch.</p>

<p>The night was mild, and the heat in the baking-rooms intense. I
knew, by experience, that the ovens had been overheated, and that
none of the porcelain must go in at least for the next two hours; so
I carried my stool to the door, settled myself in a sheltered corner
where the air could reach me, but not the rain, and fell to wondering
where George could have gone, and why he should not have waited till
the time appointed. That he had left in haste was clear--not because
his hat remained behind, for he might have had a cap with him--but
because he had left the book open, and the gas lighted. Perhaps one
of the workmen had met with some accident, and he had been summoned
away so urgently that he had no time to think of anything; perhaps he
would even now come back presently to see that all was right before
he went home to his lodgings.</p>

<p>Turning these things over in my mind, I grew drowsy, my thoughts
wandered, and I fell asleep.</p>

<p>I cannot tell how long my nap lasted. I had walked a great
distance that day, and I slept heavily; but I awoke all in a moment,
with a sort of terror upon me, and, looking up, saw George Barnard
sitting on a stool before the oven door, with the firelight full upon
his face.</p>

<p>Ashamed to be found sleeping, I started to my feet. At the same
instant, he rose, turned away without even looking towards me, and
went out into the next room.</p>

<p>"Don't be angry, George!" I cried, following him. "None of the
seggars are in. I knew the fires were too strong, and--"</p>

<p>The words died on my lips. I had followed him from the first room
to the second, from the second to the third, and in the third--I lost
him!</p>

<p>I could not believe my eyes. I opened the end door leading into
the yard, and looked out; but he was nowhere in sight. I went round
to the back of the baking-houses, looked behind the furnaces, ran
over to the counting-house, called him by his name over and over
again; but all was dark, silent, lonely, as ever.</p>

<p>Then I remembered how I had bolted the outer gate, and how
impossible it was that he should have come in without ringing. Then,
too, I began again to doubt the evidence of my own senses, and to
think I must have been dreaming.</p>

<p>I went back to my old post by the door of the first baking-house,
and sat down for a moment to collect my thoughts.</p>

<p>"In the first place," said I to myself, "there is but one outer
gate. That outer gate I bolted on the inside, and it is bolted still.
In the next place, I searched the premises, and found all the sheds
empty, and the workshop-doors padlocked as usual on the outside. I
proved that George was nowhere about, when I came, and I know he
could not have come in since, without my knowledge. Therefore it is a
dream. It is certainly a dream, and there's an end of it."</p>

<p>And with this I trimmed my lantern and proceeded to test the
temperature of the furnaces. We used to do this, I should tell you,
by the introduction of little roughly-moulded lumps of common
fire-clay. If the heat is too great, they crack; if too little, they
remain damp and moist; if just right, they become firm and smooth all
over, and pass into the biscuit stage. Well! I took my three little
lumps of clay, put one in each oven, waited while I counted five
hundred, and then went round again to see the results. The two first
were in capital condition, the third had flown into a dozen pieces.
This proved that the seggars might at once go into ovens One and Two,
but that number Three had been overheated, and must be allowed to go
on cooling for an hour or two longer.</p>

<p>I therefore stocked One and Two with nine rows of seggars, three
deep on each shelf; left the rest waiting till number Three was in a
condition to be trusted; and, fearful of falling asleep again, now
that the firing was in progress, walked up and down the rooms to keep
myself awake.</p>

<p>This was hot work, however, and I could not stand it very long; so
I went back presently to my stool by the door, and fell to thinking
about my dream. The more I thought of it, the more strangely real it
seemed, and the more I felt convinced that I was actually on my feet,
when I saw George get up and walk into the adjoining room. I was also
certain that I had still continued to see him as he passed out of the
second room into the third, and that at that time I was even
following his very footsteps. Was it possible, I asked myself, that I
could have been up and moving, and yet not quite awake? I had heard
of people walking in their sleep. Could it be that I was walking in
mine, and never waked till I reached the cool air of the yard? All
this seemed likely enough, so I dismissed the matter from my mind,
and passed the rest of the night in attending to the seggars, adding
fresh fuel from time to time to the furnaces of the first and second
ovens, and now and then taking a turn through the yards. As for
number Three, it kept up its heat to such a degree that it was almost
day before I dared trust the seggars to go in it.</p>

<p>Thus the hours went by; and at half-past seven on Thursday
morning, the men came to their work. It was now my turn to go off
duty, but I wanted to see George before I left, and so waited for him
in the counting-house, while a lad named Steve Storr took my place at
the ovens. But the clock went on from half-past seven to a quarter to
eight; then to eight o'clock; then to a quarter-past eight--and still
George never made his appearance. At length, when the hand got round
to half-past eight, I grew weary of waiting, took up my hat, ran
home, went to bed, and slept proloundly until past four in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>That evening I went down to the factory quite early; for I had a
restlessness upon me, and I wanted to sec George before he left for
the night. This time, I found the gate bolted, and I rang for
admittance.</p>

<p>"How early you are, Ben!" said Steve Storr, as he let me in.</p>

<p>"Mr. Barnard's not gone?" I asked, quickly; for I saw at the first
glance that the gas was out in the counting-house.</p>

<p>"He's not gone," said Steve, "because he's never been."</p>

<p>"Never been?"</p>

<p>"No and what's stranger still, he's not been home either, since
dinner yesterday."</p>

<p>"But he was here last night."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he was here last night, making up the books. John Parker
was with him till past six; and you found him here, didn't you, at
half-past nine?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Well, he's gone, anyhow. Good night!"</p>

<p>"Good night!"</p>

<p>I took the lantern from his hand, bolted him out mechanically, and
made my way to the baking-houses like one in a stupor. George gone?
Gone without a word of warning to his employer, or of farewell to his
fellow-workmen? I could not understand it. I could not believe it. I
sat down bewildered, incredulous, stunned. Then came hot tears,
doubts, terrifying suspicions. I remembered the wild words he had
spoken a few nights back; the strange calm by which they were
followed; my dream of the evening before. I had heard of men who
drowned themselves for love; and the turbid Severn ran close by--so
close, that one might pitch a stone into it from some of the workshop
windows.</p>

<p>These thoughts were too horrible. I dared not dwell upon them. I
turned to work, to free myself from them, if I could; and began by
examining the ovens. The temperature of all was much higher than on
the previous night, the heat having been gradually increased during
the last twelve hours. It was now my business to keep the heat on the
increase for twelve more; after which it would be allowed, as
gradually, to subside, until the pottery was cool enough for removal.
To turn the seggars, and add fuel to the two first furnaces, was my
first work. As before, I found number Three in advance of the others,
and so left it for half an hour, or an hour. I then went round the
yard; tried the doors; let the dog loose; and brought him back with
me to the baking-houses, for company. After that, I set my lantern on
a shelf beside the door, took a book from my pocket, and began to
read.</p>

<p>I remember the title of the book as well as possible. It was
called Bowlker's Art of Angling, and contained little rude cuts of
all kinds of artificial flies, hooks, and other tackle. But I could
not keep my mind to it for two minutes together; and at last I gave
it up in despair, covered my face with my hands, and fell into a long
absorbing painful train of thought. A considerable time had gone by
thus--maybe an hour--when I was roused by a low whimpering howl from
Captain, who was lying at my feet. I looked up with a start, just as
I had started from sleep the night before, and with the same vague
terror; and saw, exactly in the same place and in the same attitude,
with the firelight full upon him--George Barnard!</p>

<p>At this sight, a fear heavier than the fear of death fell upon me,
and my tongue seemed paralysed in my mouth. Then, just as last night,
he rose, or seemed to rise, and went slowly out into the next room. A
power stronger than myself appeared to compel me, reluctantly, to
follow him. I saw him pass through the second room--cross the
threshold of the third room--walk straight up to the oven--and there
pause. He then turned, for the first time, with the glare of the red
firelight pouring out upon him from the open door of the furnace, and
looked at me, face to face. In the same instant, his whole frame and
countenance seemed to glow and become transparent, as if the fire
were all within him and around him--and in that glow he became, as it
were, absorbed into the furnace, and disappeared I uttered a wild
cry, tried to stagger from the room, and fell insensible before I
reached the door.</p>

<p>When I next opened my eyes, the grey dawn was in the sky; the
furnace-doors were all closed as I had left them when I last went
round; the dog was quietly sleeping not far from my side; and the men
were ringing at the gate, to be let in.</p>

<p>I told my tale from beginning to end, and was laughed at, as a
matter of course, by all who heard it. When it was found, however,
that my statements never varied, and, above all, that George Barnard
continued absent, some few began to talk it over seriously, and among
those few, the master of the works. He forbade the furnace to be
cleared out, called in the aid of a celebrated naturalist, and had
the ashes submitted to a scientific examination. The result was as
follows:</p>

<p>The ashes were found to have been largely saturated with some kind
of fatty animal matter. A considerable portion of those ashes
consisted of charred bone. A semi-circular piece of iron, which
evidently had once been the heel of a workman's heavy boot, was
found, half fused, at one corner of the furnace. Near it, a tibia
bone, which still retained sufficient of its original form and
texture to render identification possible. This bone, however, was so
much charred, that it fell into powder on being handled.</p>

<p>After this, not many doubted that George Barnard had been foully
murdered, and that his body had been thrust into the furnace.
Suspicion fell upon Louis Laroche. He was arrested, a coroner's
inquest was held, and every circumstance connected with the night of
the murder was as thoroughly sifted and investigated as possible. All
the sifting in the world, however, failed either to clear or to
condemn Louis Laroche. On the very night of his release, he left the
place by the mail-train, and was never seen or heard of there, again.
As for Leah, I know not what became of her. I went away myself before
many weeks were over, and never have set foot among the Potteries
from that hour to this.</p>
