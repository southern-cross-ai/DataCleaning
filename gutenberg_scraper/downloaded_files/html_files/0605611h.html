<h3>THE SEARCH</h3>

<p>On a mighty blaze on a mighty tree are cut two initials and a
date. The initials are mine, the date is when I began an eight years'
lonely residence among the most backward race of people in the whole
of the tropical South Pacific, which is a place where backward
peoples abound.</p>

<p>This experience was mine primarily because in the midst of an
adventurous South Seas wandering the urge came upon me to settle
awhile. It was not that I was weary of the South Seas, for I loved
them. Nor was it that I was weary of adventuring, for youth was mine,
and to my particular kind of youth adventuring was Life. It was
merely that I was weary of adventuring in many places and desired
greatly to adventure in one place for a change.</p>

<p>But for long I saw no means of satisfying this urge. There was
always something--usually financial--to hinder me. Indeed, the number
and force of circumstances apparently especially designed to prevent
a wandering young man giving up his wandering was astonishing. Then
one day I came again to Thursday Island, the place of pearls and
pearl-shell which sits astride the strait that makes of New Guinea
and Australia two separate lands, and encountered a man with a
proposal which suited me exactly.</p>

<p>It was that we should establish a coconut plantation at Cape
York--that is to say, at Australia's uttermost north, the apex of
that tremendous and almost completely unknown peninsula which, after
half a thousand miles of paralleling the mighty Barrier Reef, thrusts
up amid the islands of Torres Strait and towards New Guinea like a
pointing finger.</p>

<p>This great land, it appeared, had a peculiarity all its own. It
was a South Sea land without coconut palms--insignia of a South Sea
land. You could sail its shore for days, said my friend, for weeks if
you liked, and never once see a palm.</p>

<p>In one place only were there a few, planted by a man named
Jardine. The beaches were edged instead by jungle and open forest and
tall indigenous grasses. He'd seen them often enough--he'd been much
up and down that coast--and every time it had somehow seemed strange.
As you went along you kept looking ahead for the green of clustered
palms, for sight of tall boles all bent with the wind. It didn't seem
right that there shouldn't be any, for you were sailing all the while
a land washed by the waters of the Coral Sea and fanned by
trade-winds and inhabited by natives--a land with all the features of
a true part of the tropical Pacific, except the most outstanding.</p>

<p>But, said my friend, there was no reason why the palms should not
be made abundantly to grow there. No reason at all. He'd given a deal
of thought to the matter, considered all the details, garnered
information wherever he could. He was sure that with discretion and
judgement it could be done. The great land lay squarely within the
latitudes coconuts favoured. It was affluent in the matter of
rainfall and, so far as was known, fertility of soil. It was not
within any area of cyclonic or other palm-destroying winds. Indeed,
had it been tenanted by agriculturists like the Solomon Islanders or
Papuans, instead of by Australian aborigines--Palaeolithic nomads who
grew nothing whatever, but lived by the chase--its beaches would have
had their miles upon miles of palm groves. A fine plantation indeed
could be made there! enthused my friend. There would be all manner of
advantages. The most suitable site could be had for the choosing. In
a land so great suitable sites would be innumerable. The labour of
the natives would cost little. They would be eager to work and thus
obtain European foods and goods. A man would labour a whole month for
a few shillings' worth of 'trade' goods. They were a poverty-stricken
lot, who seldom saw strangers, and would jump at a chance like this.
What did I think of the idea? I had had experience of coconut
planting in New Guinea and elsewhere, and if I would become the
working partner, he would provide certain necessary moneys.</p>

<p>But it would be no easy task, he warned when I promptly agreed. I
should consider the disadvantages involved. He didn't want me to
begin the task only to abandon it unfinished. That would be no good
to either of us. I would have to live there eight years. It would be
like going into a kind of exile, cutting myself off from the rest of
the world, and all that. There would be hardships of various kinds,
and perhaps danger from natives. From all accounts, the natives were
a pretty wild and savage crowd. And it would be difficult to teach
them plantation work. Then there was the loneliness. I would see
white men only at long intervals. Loneliness would be hard to stick
in such a place...</p>

<p>But this was just the kind of life I craved. Also it came to me
that there would be something romantic in being the first
systematically to plant coconuts in so great a land and thereby bring
it into its own. I felt I could not begin quickly enough. A day or
two later all arrangements were made, and I boarded a small
sailing-craft and set forth to spy out the land in general and a spot
suitable for the venture in particular.</p>

<p>It was not an imposing craft for a voyage of discovery, being a
craft dirty, ill-found and worse-kept, even to the matter of
sun-cracked decks and straggling rope-ends and blistered paint-work.
Also it had been used in the fishing of trepang. Trepang is a
sea-slug of repulsive appearance when alive and of great
malodorousness when smoke-dried for export as a Chinese edible; and
the malodorousness had impregnated itself into the very timbers, so
that never for a moment was I free from it.</p>

<p>Further, the captain was a thin-faced yellow-eyed Cingalese who
spent much of his time in the cabin dallying in turn with an
opium-pipe and a newly acquired native wife with a tendency to
obesity; and the smell of the opium mingled with the smell of the
trepang and produced a third smell unlike but viler than either of
its components.</p>

<p>Again, the crew, of various crossed breedings, with black
predominant, had before leaving drunk much of Thursday Island's
strange liquors and now drank more on board, to the displaying of the
several savage characteristics of their black heredity incongruously
mingled with the vices of their white heredity.</p>

<p>But these things mattered little to me. Too often before had I
seen their like. As trader, gold-seeker, pearler, recruiter of
plantation labourers, as a general South Seas Odysseus, the crudities
of life had been commoner to me than the refinements, and I had
become accustomed to them. Besides, the real significance of the
venture burned within me. I was setting out to discover a new
possibility in a new land. It was like setting out to discover a new
land itself. I was a pioneer, an explorer, a Columbus--a Columbus in
a trepang-craft.</p>

<p>It was the height of the trade-wind season, and all through that
first day we lay up to the blustering seas, sailing tack for tack
across the breeze, taking four miles sidewise to gain one of forward
progress; and at sundown we anchored behind a tall and rocky island
which kept from us both wind and sea; and here the drinking of the
crewboys was ended, for soon after dark they went into an alcoholic
sleep and the thin-faced captain quietly confiscated their store of
liquor--to their tremendous discontent when they awoke, and to their
accusing one another of having stolen it.</p>

<p>With the first of the sunrise the anchor came clanking up--a
sunrise which filled me with the joy of life, so clear and fresh and
warm was it--and on rounding the sheltering isand's shoulder we fell
in with a score or more luggers working a bed of pearl-shell, all of
them bright, brisk craft, tall of mast and wide of sail. Everywhere
was colour--small flecks of it, great splashes of it, colours that
ranged from the scarlet of a loin-cloth to the broad
gold-and-blueness of the sea. In the low rays of the sun the luggers'
sails were white as paper, the green of their rails the green of
jade, the gleaming of their protecting copper, just above the water
or awash, the gleaming of wet gold. On each vessel's either bow, so
placed that it was an eye, was a distinguishing disc of blue, or
white, or crimson. The red wheel-handles of the divers' air-pumps
were as flashes of reflected flame, and the nude backs of the men who
turned them bits of bronze. All about the smoothness of the sea were
bursting bubbles of silver--betrayers of the divers' positions on the
bottom--and from each vessel's rail an air-pipe and life-line
overside and down like a thick grey snake and a thin one incredibly
long.</p>

<p>I remarked to the captain's wife to the effect that this was a
sight worth while; and she agreed with me, and with her fat hand
pointed to various small colours I had missed, and showed me a cloud
which she said was shaped like a stout woman's breast. But her
husband shook his fist at the vessels and spat voluminously.</p>

<p>'Japanee!' he said. 'All bloody Japanee!'</p>

<p>He didn't like Japanese, he told me later. They'd got hold of all
the pearling. One time there was hardly any of them in the Strait;
but now they were all over the place. They'd got hold of all the
luggers, and an outsider hadn't a chance of getting one. He'd tried
and tried. He was a good diver; he'd dived for various lugger-owning
firms years ago, and done well at it, too, what with the pearls he
found and forgot to hand over, and all that. There was a lot of money
in pearling, if you had a bit of luck. But he couldn't get a lugger.
The Japanese blocked him every time he tried. So he had to take on
trepanging. It wasn't much of a game, trepanging. There were too many
boats at it. The trepang was getting too hard to find.</p>

<p>'It's harder work than pearlin',' he said. 'Not only is there a
lot of divin' to get the trepang, but afterwards their guts have to
be taken out, and the trepang boiled and smoked; and we've got to go
ashore every now and then and cut heaps of wood for the smoking and
boiling; and the fire's got to be looked after; and what with the
smokehouse and the boiler there ain't any room on deck, and
everything's stinking like hell and--and--oh! b--them Japanese!'</p>

<p>At noon we sighted low down against the sky a long grey smear
which the captain said was the Peninsula's western shore; and that
afternoon we lay along it but did not stop, for the land, so far as
could be seen from the sea, was mainly steep-sided hills covered with
tall, coarse grasses which I knew from experience to betoken
agriculturally unfit soil. So on we went, that day and the next,
winding between sandbanks and reefs and islands, on past a hill where
stood a telegraph station which by linking a submarine cable to a
land-line of exceeding length joined Thursday Island and its pearlers
to the rest of the world--a single, lonely-looking building it was,
on tall piles, with a wide verandah which had at its corners
loop-holed shooting-shelters of spear-proof galvanized iron. Then we
came to the Peninsula's utmost extremity, and after a stout battle
with an adverse tide rounded it and made through an island-bordered
pass where jungle-dad cliffs stood steeply to the water's edge and
made of the sea a place of purple shadows with light in them.</p>

<p>It was the pass through which Captain Cook sailed his tiny
inadequate <i>Endeavour</i> and thereby established definitely that
Australia was not joined to New Guinea; and I thrilled absurdly to
the knowledge that a century and a half later I, also on a voyage of
discovery, should be sailing in a tiny inadequate craft through this
self-same pass, should be looking at scenes unaltered as when that
prince of navigators looked at them.</p>

<p>I remarked on this to the captain. But he wasn't at all impressed.
He didn't think Captain Cook had any particular virtues as a
navigator. There were many better, he thought, and to prove it gave
me the names of some of them; whereupon I discovered he thought I had
referred to a remarkably dissolute trepanger of his acquaintance, he
never having heard of the <i>Endeavour</i> and having no conception
whatever of what the term a century and a half conveyed.</p>

<p>Nor when I explained was he very greatly impressed. In coming
safely through this maze of then uncharted shoals, he said in effect,
the <i>&gt;Endeavour</i> no doubt performed a worthy feat, but only a
week or two ago these same waters had seen one absolutely remarkable.
Whereupon he related the adventure of a pearling-cutter--an adventure
which recalled, even in the matter of nomenclature, the adventure of
the Marie Celeste, the sailing-ship which was found adrift in the
Atlantic, abandoned intact and with all sail set and nothing to
indicate what had happened.</p>

<p>The cutter was called the <i>Marie Esebia</i>, and one day in a
calm at the farther limit of the strait her native crew of three went
overside for a swim. Suddenly a breeze sprang up and and filled the
sails, and the vessel was off towards the skyline before the men in
the water realized what had happened. The men were picked up later
none the worse, but by then the cutter was well over the curve and
out of sight, and it was only after an extended search that the
runaway was found on the eastern side of Cape York. She was quite
unharmed, for manless and all as she was, she had travelled more than
a hundred miles to <i>windward</i>, through a most tremendous tangle
of reefs and sandbanks and islands, where there were scarcely two
consecutive half-miles of open water--and missed them all!</p>

<p>This region had a very definite interest for my captain. As we sat
on the rail, with the vessel swimming so smoothly to the last of the
day-wind as to make scarcely a ripple, he told me of it. It concerned
the wreck of the <i>Quetta</i>, a British-India passenger-steamer of
a full ten thousand tons which hereabouts one calm and moonlight
night so ripped out her bottom on an uncharted rock that within five
minutes she plunged completely under, to the losing of some hundreds
of lives. My captain was then a pearl-diver, and soon after the
disaster went down to the vessel in the dress.</p>

<p>He told me he would not care to see again what he saw down there.
He didn't think he could stand it, what with the opium and all. The
passengers had just started a dance, and there was an awning along
the deck, all hung with red electric globes and blue ones and flags
and things, and the ship was sitting straight up on the bottom, like
she was sailing along. Some of the people was caught up under the
awning. The tide was making them bump it. You'd have thought they was
alive, the way they moved. There was a lot of women. Beautiful, some
of them, and young, too. There was a man with a cigar in his hand. He
had a round face and his eyes was open, staring-like, and the cigar
was all in loose bits, like bits of paper. All sorts of people, and
they was all bumping the awning as if they was trying to get up; and
some of their faces was like they was asleep and happy, and some was
frowning, and some looked frightened. There was a girl with her dress
washed up over her head like she'd put it there so's she couldn't see
them others...</p>

<p>My captain gave a little shiver, glanced at the land for a bearing
and gave an order to the steersman. Then when the vessel had swung
downwind a little he extended a long brown finger over the side and
said, in a tone which had in it more than a little of awe, that we
were now directly over the spot where the <i>Quetta</i> still lay,
and that if I cared to look down steadily awhile maybe I would see
something of the grey uncertain shadow which was her hull. But
somehow I did not care to look; and my captain with a nervous laugh
rose and went down into the cabin, whence came presently the acrid
scent of burning opium.</p>

<p>The finding of a site suitable for the establishment of a pioneer
coconut plantation was not the simple matter my partner and I had
thought. Despite the fact that for many weary days I sailed up and
down the Peninsula's eastern shore, making inspection of every likely
spot, never once did I come across the combination I sought--arable
land and shelter for shipping--though these qualities existed
separately in exasperating numbers. Indeed, never before had I seen
so many fine harbours edged by soil of absolute barrenness, and so
many unsheltered beaches edged by land which would grow anything at
all. To me the outstanding feature of the country was a remarkable
dearth of suitable plantation sites. It was extremely
discouraging.</p>

<p>And to add to the discouragement there was the opinion of the crew
that the land wouldn't grow coconuts anyway. If it would, why were
none there now? they asked, thereby revealing the conservative native
belief that what never was never could be. There must be something
wrong with the land, they said decisively--to all of which the
captain's wife nodded agreement, and one evening, greatly daring,
warned me privately that my venture was a foolish one, and then,
fearing my displeasure and as something in the way of conciliation,
took from behind her ear a cigarette of crude tobacco rolled in dried
bana-leaf and placed it between my lips and lit it, striking the
match on the hardened sole of her foot.</p>

<p>And to add further to the discouragement, there was the opinion of
a white man I met on the shore of one of the exasperatingly unfertile
harbours. He was a sandalwood-cutter who had brought to the coast,
for shipment to China for use as joss-sticks and as fuel for the
everlasting temple-fires, a quantity of the scented wood on the backs
of a string of horses. It was a dam-fool idea--growing coconuts, he
said. They took too flaming long to come into bearing. Seven years
was a hell of a big slice out of a man's life. And the damn things
mightn't fruit in this country at all. I might have all my labour for
nothing. I was taking a big risk. Sounded a mug's game, if you asked
him. He'd rather have sandalwood-cuttin'. Of course,
sandalwood-cuttin' had its drawbacks. It wasn't all beer and
skittles, sandalwood-cuttin'. The wood took a lot of finding, and the
bloody Chinks had a way of rigging the market and making prices come
down. Still, a man had some sort of an idea where he stood most
times. If he was me he'd get this coconut growing nonsense out of his
head and go in for something that gave a more certain return. And a
quicker one.</p>

<p>And to add to the discouragement still further I had in this
region a taste of what it was to be absolutely alone. It was on an
uninhabited island, called Turtlehead Island, which lay close to the
coast, and I determined to explore while my captain took his vessel
to a place where a trepang cargo awaited him. As the sails went up
and the vessel fanned out from the anchorage, there came the voice of
my captain calling that within three days he would most faithfully
return. I think I scarcely heard him. My first experience of being
utterly alone had aroused in me a sensation I had never felt before
or have ever felt since.</p>

<p>It was a sensation of smallness and frailty. It was as though
everything but me was big and strong. The sea was a thing of
immensity and power. The hills of the two-miles-distant mainland were
mighty and rugged. Never had I seen hills so mighty and rugged. The
trees about the beach were thick of bole and tall. They had resisted
the vicissitudes of maybe a hundred years. While I--I was a thing of
but a few score pounds of bone and muscle and flesh which even the
most trifling mishap could for ever destroy. As I stood there on the
beach beside the little heap which was my sufficiency of arms and
rations, I felt more incompetent than ever I had felt in my life.</p>

<p>Then on rounding a corner of the beach I discovered a native
hut--a preposterously tiny hut built of bark and amazingly crooked
saplings, with two sides only and a most inadequate roof--and at once
the sensation of smallness and frailty left me and the hills and the
trees and the sea lost their seeming superiority. My interest centred
on this thing of human association. Here was a link with the world of
men, something I appreciated and understood; and with a curious
ecstatic pleasure I fell to wondering who was its owner and why he
had chosen to live in a solitude such as this, natives being
gregarious in the extreme. Then I put the matter from me for the time
and gave myself to examining the island.</p>

<p>It was an island large for those waters, being some twelve miles
round, and at first I thought I had discovered the place I sought,
for on the shore of the well-sheltered harbour was an area of arable
land. Then I found it was as unsuitable as any of the other places I
had inspected--the area of arable land was far too small. It was
another disappointment; but by now I was becoming accustomed to
disappointments, and complacently enough I sat in my tent beside the
empty hut and awaited the end of the three days and the
trepang-vessel's return.</p>

<p>But at the end of the three days the vessel did not come, nor did
she come at the end of a week, nor of two weeks. At first I did not
greatly care. The Tropics were the land of lots of time and I was a
child of the Tropics. There was always tomorrow. Anything might
happen tomorrow, and it didn't much matter if it didn't.</p>

<p>Besides, I was now enjoying this my first taste of solitude. There
being nothing else to give it to, my attention was given wholly to
Nature and natural things. Hitherto I had carelessly generalized with
regard to Nature. Now I particularized. I noted individuals and
individual characters. A bird, from being merely a member of a
certain species, became a thing of peculiarities which made it
interestingly different from other birds. I found that no animal was
exactly the same as its fellows, any more than any man is exactly the
same as his fellows. Even a tree, I discovered, was not just one of a
thousand trees, but an individual with a history of its own. These
things engaged me so greatly that the days passed quickly.</p>

<p>But at length my interest in things human revived. I became
anxious at the trepang-vessel's failure to return. I put myself on
short rations, for I had brought food sufficient only for a week, and
abandoned the discovering of individual characteristics in birds and
things for watching from the seaward beach for the returning vessel's
sail.</p>

<p>In the course of adventuring in many places I had more than once
been made aware of the fact that in the face of a pressing human need
beauty lost much of its charm. But as I watched from that seaward
beach it seemed to me that never had I been aware of it so acutely as
now. I knew that the great blue spread of the sea was a great blue
spread of loveliness, that the infrequent cloud-shadows upon it and
the white flecking of the waves were things of swift beauty. But I
knew it only as something by the way. The thing that impressed me
most about that sea was its emptiness. Never, I thought, had I seen a
sea so thoroughly empty of ships. Not only was there no sign of the
sail I sought, but there was no sign of any kind of sail. The
dissociation of that sea from things human was astoundingly complete.
Sometimes at the end of a long day's watching I thought of it as a
sea that had never been sailed at all, and never would be sailed, a
despairingly virgin sea. Its beauty meant to me nothing at all. I was
a hungry man. I was a starveling in a palace of loveliness.</p>

<p>My anxiety developed to serious alarm. I put myself on shorter
rations still, having one meal daily and only half a meal at that. On
the seaward beach I built a great stack of dry, dead wood and all day
stood by ready to ignite it as a signal of distress should a sail
perchance appear. But the sea retained its dreadful emptiness. Its
beauty began to mock me.</p>

<p>Then, on the twelfth evening, I returned to the tent to see
approaching across the harbour an object of indeterminate shape which
for a time puzzled me, and at length I saw was a canoe. Eagerly as a
castaway of fiction, I ran to the water's edge and awaited its
coming.</p>

<p>There were three natives in it--two women and a man--each with
skin of a dull dead blackness and short curly hair lying exceedingly
close to the head. Of clothing the man wore nothing at all, and one
of the women was clad in a garment that left her naked from the waist
upwards, and the other in a garment that left her naked from the
waist down.</p>

<p>I was prepared for astonishment at sight of me; but as though it
were the commonest thing imaginable to find white men on lonely and
otherwise uninhabited islands, they calmly went about making fast the
canoe to a stake driven upright in the sand, and then came up to me,
the man in front, and in turn held out their hands in greeting, one
of the women in a mistaken effort at cleanliness first rubbing her
palm on her naked thigh.</p>

<p>The hut was his property, the man informed me in an English in
which the words 'feller' and 'belong' were considerably overworked,
and he had come from the camp of his tribe, a day and a half's
journey down the coast. He had come here to fish, he went on. There
was very good fishing here. Very good indeed, he repeated, and with a
nod and quick movement of his arm indicated where the gold of the
harbour was creased by series of flowing ripples. After which he
ordered the women to go out after the fish; and when they had
obediently launched the canoe and gone he said that the younger was
his wife and the elder his daughter, which reversal of the usual
order was due to the fact that he had had another wife but she had
abandoned him recently for a Japanese pearlfisher, whereupon he had
neither grieved nor worried, but promptly annexed another woman of
the tribe and considered himself none the loser by the affair, as the
second wife was younger and more handsome than the one he had
lost.</p>

<p>Then he asked what were the circumstances pertaining to my
presence on the island; and when I told him, emphasizing my poverty,
he looked disappointed and said he had hoped to beg from me, and
immediately afterwards betrayed deep concern for my well-being. On
the return of the women he bade them cook for me some of the fish,
which they did by burying them in the hot ashes of a fire, viscera
and scales and all; and he told me that in the morning, when the tide
would be favourable for making the passage, he would take me in his
canoe to the mainland and personally escort me across the Peninsula
to a harbour where there would be opportunity of hailing a passing
boat.</p>

<p>I liked that Stone Age man. He seemed so considerate and kind,
such a real good fellow. I felt I could have trusted him anywhere.
Yet, as I authoritatively learned later, he was one of the worst
characters in a land where bad characters abounded. The water-police
had wanted him for long. Charged against him was a list of offences
ranging from murder to petty theft, and it was only his exercise of
an astonishing bushcraft that saved him from capture. Also he was
outcast from his tribe for being a persistent stealer of other men's
wives and for making disturbances generally. Still, he was willing,
quite without hope of reward, and merely in order to relieve my
distress, to make a long and dangerous journey. I consider him the
most kindly intentioned murderer I have ever met.</p>

<p>But I had no need to make the journey across the Peninsula, for
early next morning the trepang-vessel's white wing showed round the
corner of the island; and presently she was through the shallows of
the channel and anchored close inshore, and the thin-faced captain was
standing with me on the beach and apologizing profusely for the
delay, which, he explained, was due to the crewboys recovering their
store of confiscated liquor and drinking to such an extent that they
ran the vessel on a reef from which she could not be freed for twelve
full days.</p>

<p>A little later I had bidden farewell to my friend of the young
wife and not-so-young-daughter, made them a present from the
trepang-vessel's stores, and was heading back towards the pass
through which the <i>Endeavour</i> had sailed and where the
<i>Quetta</i> made a dull uncertain shadow on the bottom.</p>

<p>For by this time, I knew there was on the Peninsula's eastern
shore no place suited to my purpose, and I was setting out to inspect
more closely the western shore--the shore which formed one of the
boundaries of the Gulf of Carpentaria, one of the most extensive
waterways in the world. Wherefore on rounding Cape York once more the
vessel headed on past the telegraph station, and on past rounded
rocky points that projected seaward with aimless menace, past islands
edged by broad and sloping beaches, past coral reefs whose branching
arms showed brown to the falling of the tide, past river-mouths which
sent a yellow swirling to the blueness of the sea, with all the while
among the Peninsula's runts of hills and inconsequential valleys, and
sometimes on its beach, the smoke of native fires.</p>

<p>Sometimes opposite one of these beach-fires we anchored and I went
ashore--to see what manner of folk these natives were, and to ask
them if they knew of a place such as I sought. But always when I
reached the huts they were deserted, and there was only the
smouldering of the fire to show they had been lately occupied; and I
was uneasily conscious that from the adjoining jungle numerous eyes
watched my every movement, and I was glad I had brought with me a
rifle.</p>

<p>'They think we water-police boat,' one of the crewboys who rowed
the dinghy for me said once. They wild fellers. They always doin'
some bad thing, and the police-boat chase them plenty times. Wild
fellers too much! They not like you and me!' And he went on to
illustrate the wildness of those wild fellers with tales of tribal
raidings, of stealthy death and sudden death, and of dreadful
nocturnes, turning now and then to his companions for corroboration
or elaboration, and at the end remarking that he wouldn't care to
live there among them, as I intended to do. But as he told all this
in the tone of one whose own civilized state was so advanced that he
could regard such backward people only as subjects for contemptuous
scorn, I didn't take him very seriously. He was one of a class of
coloured men who took every opportunity to convey the impression that
they were most civilized indeed. I had met men like that who were
less than ten years removed from cannibalism.</p>

<p>The Peninsula's western shore seemed as unsuited to my purpose as
the eastern shore. I landed on many beaches, examined many hundreds
of acres; I entered river-mouths and narrow winding creeks; and
always it was the same old story of arable land and shelter for
shipping being never in conjunction. It began to be borne in on me
that it was not to be my lot to bring this great land into its
own.</p>

<p>And then one morning we sailed into a harbour created by the
vicinity of two large islands and several small ones, so placed as to
give shelter from every direction--and all along the shore was a
jungle, a thick, tall jungle, purple in the early light, and subtly
tingeing the breeze with the scent of flowers. I looked at it
delightedly. Jungle-land was agriculturally the best land. Ground
which would grow a jungle so tall and thick as this would grow
anything. I could not have wished for a better place. Nevertheless as
I went ashore I was prepared for disillusionment. I had been
disappointed so often before. This place seemed just a little too
satisfactory to be true. I suspected a catch in it somewhere. But
there was no catch. The jungle-land was even better than it looked
from the sea; and the amount of it was more than enough for my
purpose, and the soil had a richness such as nowhere I had seen in
this land, and there was abundance of fresh water--a long the beach
were several springs of it, and traversing the jungle was a tiny
gurgling creek. I examined the place thoroughly, taking two days over
it, becoming familiar with all its details, taking rough measurements
of the area of the arable land, and sounding the anchoring depths of
the harbour. There was no doubt whatever that I had come at last to
the place I sought. The only thing wrong with it was its name--which,
according to the more or less inadequate chart of the region, was
Simpson's Bay. Simpson's Bay seemed so utterly commonplace and
inappropriate. After that long search of mine it should have been
called something with a note of triumph in it. Even Eureka would have
been better than Simpson's Bay, though I don't like Eureka as a name.
As the vessel raced back before the wind to Thursday Island, I
determined to discover the native name of the place and let it be
known henceforth by that.</p>

<p>At Thursday Island I made the necessary negotiations with the Land
authorities and became possessed of a large document importantly
sealed and stamped and a plan inscribed to the effect that I was
part-owner of the section shaded in red; then a supply of stores and
tools was obtained; and in a few days I boarded an outward-bound
vessel which in due course landed me at the ill-named Simpson's Bay
and then went on her way. My task was begun.</p>

<p>I was entirely alone. I had not even a dog. From the presence of
numerous bark huts along the beach I knew the place as an habitual
native camping-spot. But the ashes of the cooking-fires were cold and
there were no fresh foot-tracks. I knew, however, the natives would
sometime return. Meanwhile I made myself as comfortable as I could,
and between two of the great trees about the high-water mark slung a
hammock, placed beneath it most of my stores and tools and personal
belongings, and soon after dark, with rifle and revolver beside me,
turned in and began a night in which the outstanding features were
the wailing of curlews along the beach, the guttural barking of
crocodiles in an adjacent creek, the howling of distant wild-dogs,
and the imagined voices of stealthily approaching natives. I have
been in many strange and dangerous situations; but I don't think I
was ever so fearful for my personal safety as I was that night.</p>

<p>But with the coming of daylight my fears all vanished. I looked at
my domain with the eye of a conqueror-to-be; and in so looking I saw
the black-and-purple tangle of the jungle replaced by symmetrical
lines of waving, fruiting palms, and myself on the verandah of a
magnificent bungalow, saying proudly to myself: 'I did it! I--who was
once a wanderer of neither means nor purpose! I am a creator! From a
black man's jungle have I made a white man's garden!'</p>

<p>Indeed, so strong upon me was this envisioning that it was with
the eager delight of a child that I selected a site for my residence.
And it was exultingly that on a mighty blaze on a mighty tree I cut
the initials and the date:</p>

<p>J.M.<br>
7/10/11.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2"></a>Chapter Two</h2>

<h3>THE NATIVES ARRIVE</h3>

<p>I began the clearing of the site and the building of the house
alone, for as the days went by no natives appeared, though far along
the beaches smokes from their fires continually trickled up, and from
among the inland hills a favouring night-wind brought always sounds
as of drums. Often was I tempted to take rifle and revolver and go in
search of them. But that would have meant leaving my outfit entirely
unguarded--a risk I could not possibly take. So it was that I was
compelled to await their spontaneous coming and meanwhile do what I
could myself.</p>

<p>I don't think I ever have been so much thrown upon my own
resources as I was in the days immediately following. In my
vagabonding among the islands there were always natives to do things.
There I merely managed and supervised. I performed no heavy manual
labour. It was mine only to order the doing of a task and to see that
it was done. For, I was a White Man among a multitude of black men,
and therefore a Master and a Superior Person.</p>

<p>Here it was very different. Here I was master and labourer too. I
not only made the plan, but I executed the plan. And in the executing
of the plan I found my resources extremely poor. I found that my
status as a Superior Person had been based on dependence on others.
My muscles, long out of training, so revolted at the unaccustomed
work that a single hour of felling the heavy jungle-trees left me
aching all over and made by body crave rest as never it had craved
anything before; and all the while I gushed with perspiration; and
the smooth handle of the axe lifted the skin from my soft palms; and
so inefficient was I that I took twice as long over a task as any
labourer would have taken, and made absurd mistakes and used
cumbersome methods and no methods whatever. All of which surprised me
very considerably and led me to taking stock of myself and my
capabilities, to consequent humiliation and chastening of spirit, for
I had long been regarded as a Superior Person that I had come to
believe I really was one, whereas it was now revealed to me that I
was far less competent than the humblest of coolies.</p>

<p>But despite these things the work went forward; and in due course
I began on the framework of the house--a framework of exceedingly
simple design, yet quite unlike that of an ordinary house, the
unlikeness lying in the fact that instead of resting on the ground in
the usual manner it had to stand on stout, hard piles a yard in
height at least, with between the top of each pile and the supports
of the floor a cap of thick flat iron. For white ants were
everywhere, and their favourite diet was wood--dead wood for
preference, but green if dead was not available, as was evinced by
their occasional attacking of growing jungle-tree--and stout hard
piles capped with iron was the only device I knew to protect the
building against them.</p>

<p>I hated those ants, and saw nothing absurd in the fact that a
full-grown man should hate a thing so insignificant as an ant. I
feared that despite my protective device they would get at my
building and destroy it; and more than once the dreadful thought came
to me that when my palms were grown maybe they would attack and
devour them as at times they attacked and devoured living trees in
the jungle. I derived but little comfort from the knowledge that
palm-wood, being shreddy and teeth-entangling, was not at all to
their liking, or from the recollection that in the whole of my
considerable experience I had never heard of a plantation being
destroyed by them.</p>

<p>For it was as though they resented my coming to this place of
theirs and were determined to drive me away. If I left a box on the
ground for even an hour or two they would be at it, riddling it
through. They did their best to ruin various timbers I had cut and
dressed ready for erection. They attacked the handles of my tools
whenever they found them within reach, and as though destruction of
the handles were not enough deposited a corroding acid which ate
deeply into the metal. They made onslaughts on the stout supporting
piles and despite their hardness injured them--a circumstance which
caused me to protect them further by charring their outsides thickly.
They even ravaged my clothes where I flung them overnight, and, as
though to bring me tumbling down, gnawed at the trees to which my
hammock was slung, and also devoured the sacks containing my
food-supplies, so that tea and rice and flour became irretrievably
mixed. Indeed, so persistent was their onslaught that at times I came
nigh to believing that were I to stand for long in one place they
would surely attack my person. And all this despite the fact that
they were tiny squashy things, slow-moving and sightless; despite the
fact also that because of a peculiar aversion from light they
travelled only in tubes built along the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>These tubes were about the thickness of a man's finger and were
divided into two compartments, one for going and one for coming; and
some of them had such directness of line that they surmounted
obstacles rather than went around them; and some had a length of a
full five hundred yards or more; and such was the persistence of
their builders that when I retributively destroyed a portion of one
there was neither abandonment of purpose nor even change of
direction, but merely a halt in the processional comings and goings
while repairs were effected with neatness and dispatch. In the matter
of definiteness of purpose these ants had nothing whatever in common
with those species of ants which appear to spend most of their time
running aimlessly and stupidly around; while in the matter of
engineering skill they were the craftsmen of the insect world.</p>

<p>So, fighting against ants and bodily unfitness, the while feeling
most tremendously alone, I worked at the building of my home. Then
one mid-afternoon I straightened myself from a task--to look straight
into the eyes of a man.</p>

<p>He was tall and muscular, smoky black of skin and entirely naked,
and he had a lithe erectness of carriage which sometimes I think
belongs only to primitive man. My first ordered thought was to spring
for my rifle, which lay some yards away. But somehow I could not take
my gaze from his face. For his eyes were curiously expressionless,
the eyes of a man who looked but cared not whether he looked at all,
the eyes of a man absolutely sure of himself and not at all afraid of
what I might attempt--an expressionlessness so menacing that it came
to me that though his hands were empty he might be dragging between
his toes a spear which, by a quick raising of his foot, he could
place in his hand, a trick, I had heard, that these people were wont
to play. For a full half-minute we stood there, the white and the
black; then the native grunted and uttered a word of English he had
somewhere picked up, a word which, I learned later, he thought was a
greeting: 'Tomorrow!' and at sound of it the spell of his eyes were
broken and I looked at his feet and saw that a spear was truly
there.</p>

<p>I produced a piece of 'trade' tobacco, and at the same time got my
rifle. He took the tobacco, smelt it, broke it in two pieces and
placed one behind each ear. Then he made an almost imperceptible
sign, and another native, nude and smoky black as the first, stepped
from out of the jungle so silently that there was not even the
crackling of leaves beneath his feet. I gave him a piece of tobacco
also, and he returned to the jungle and a moment later reappeared
with a number of spears and throwing-clubs, which he laid in a heap
on the ground before me; whereupon the first man came right up to me
and held out his hand in the European manner of greeting, save only
that it was the left hand instead of the right, and in an English the
most mutilated and full of antiphrasis I have ever heard said that he
was my friend and that his companion was my friend, and then with
engaging frankness asked had I any more tobacco.</p>

<p>When I told them that I had, they produced some tree-bark thin as
paper and made cigarettes and lit them with a coal from my
cooking-fire and squatting on their haunches smoked them. And as they
smoked they told me that this was their main camping-ground, that the
name of the spot was Utingu, which meant the Place of Many Big Trees,
and that they had been down-coast on a fishing expedition, this being
the time of the year when certain fish were numerous in a certain
river-mouth. Then they asked the reason of my building a house here,
and whether it was to be a trepang station or a place wherein to
store pearl-shell, but asking it as though they were only slightly
curious about these things, and were more interested in the fact that
I possessed a considerable quantity of tobacco.</p>

<p>In an English carefully chosen so as to be as bad as theirs, I
told them of my object, adding that I needed labourers for the work
and was depending on the natives to supply that need. They shook
their heads; they were hunters, they said in effect, not workers--a
statement which caused me to deliver a homily on the advantages of
working, and having a regular supply of food, over the uncertainties
of the chase, which they considered to the extent of agreeing with me
and declaring that while they themselves were disinclined for work,
no doubt there were some in the tribe who would like it. There were a
lot of people in the tribe, said one. More than he had fingers and
toes. More than his friend had fingers and toes. Some of them would
surely want to work, said the other, adding that the whole of the
tribe would be along soon. Meanwhile, they would like some more
tobacco.</p>

<p>A little before sundown the first of the tribe appeared along the
beach, then the others, mostly one behind the other, each with a
head-burden of personal effects and the men their weapons besides,
accompanying them an extra-ordinary number of dejected and
part-starved dogs. They seemed at first glance exceedingly ill-kempt
and uncared for. The women, thin-legged and narrow-chested, wore
dresses contrived from scraps of cloth that had come their way, and
while some of the men were nude, others were dressed to the extent of
a pair of trousers and still others to the extent of a shirt--cast
off oddments of pearl- and trepang-fishers and others who travelled
the coast. On the dress of one woman was stencilled 'Lily
White'--indicating that her garment had been once a flour-bag; and
the coat of one man had on it a brass button whose inscription showed
that its original wearer had been a member of the Japanese Navy.</p>

<p>And, besides their unkemptness, the expressions of their faces
seemed remarkably ferocious. Indeed, they were the savagest-looking
savages I had seen. Later, I became so accustomed to this appearance
of ferocity as to take no heed of it at all; but this first sight of
it disturbed me considerably; and that night and for several
following nights I lay much awake watching the flickering of their
camp-fires and listening to the murmur of their voices and the
half-hearted quarrelling of their dogs, the while disconcertingly
recalling the stories I had heard of the barbarity of these selfsame
people.</p>

<p>I rose earlier than usual next morning. I expected a day of great
busyness, a day of engaging labourers, informing them of the wages
and rations they would receive, appointing and explaining tasks, and
so forth. But the hours went by without a native appearing. In the
camp along the beach was no hint of life. There was nothing to
indicate that I was no longer alone in this place of mine. I wondered
at this quiet. It was so unlike the behaviour of the natives to whom
I was accustomed; had this been a beach in, say, New Guinea, I would
have been surrounded long since by a chattering, excited crowd
pouring out questions with an impatience which allowed no pausing for
replies. I feared there was something wrong; and about ten o'clock I
went to the camp to discover what it was.</p>

<p>There was nothing wrong. It was merely that the tribe had not yet
risen; they were asleep, the whole of them--asleep with such
thoroughness that the sprawling of them about the Wet of the trees
and under various crude bark shelters they had built was as the
sprawling of a community of mostly-naked dead. But the dogs were
awake; and at my coming they set up such a snarling and barking that
presently a girl stirred and sat up, and a youth near her opened his
eyes and stared at me dully, and an elderly man muttered what was
patently a petulant rebuking of the dogs, and others moved uneasily
and gradually and reluctantly awoke, and a child or two wailed
loudly; and soon the whole tribe were more or less stretching wide
their arms and yawning extravagantly, their manner the while
indicating that they thought it most inconsiderate of me that I
should disturb them so early.</p>

<p>I approached a man who appeared to be a chief or leader of some
kind, he being easily the tallest and broadest of them all, besides
much the savagest of expression, and by gestures and by words I hoped
he would understand, but feared greatly that he wouldn't, explained
my purpose and intentions, saying that I would make of this place of
jungles a beautiful and extensive garden so filled with foods that
there would be abundance for everyone, and that I needed men to help
with the work and would give them all manner of things from my stores
in payment--tobacco and cloth and sheathknives and tomahawks and many
other things, all of which I had in plenty, as anyone could see for
himself if he liked to come to my tent.</p>

<p>He made no answer, neither did the one or two others who had
casually approached, and, thinking maybe I had not been understood, I
repeated the whole medley of words and gestures, changing their order
here and there and adding a few new ones, thinking all the time that
the employing of these people was not to be the easy matter I had
thought in Thursday Island, and fearing acutely for the success of
the venture; without the assistance of these savages the making of
the plantation was impossible.</p>

<p>But the interview turned out quite satisfactorily, for presently,
when I had given him a piece of tobacco--which in the most casual
fashion he placed behind his ear--my listener gave me to understand
that the thing did not rest with him, but with the individual members
of the tribe: that they could please themselves in the matter;
whereupon the others, who had stood listening in silence, informed me
that they would be willing to accept the things I spoke of in return
for a little work; and with that they wandered away and returned with
a number of others, who addressed me in similar terms, though quite
without eagerness or delight, but almost as though they were merely
obliging me, as though they didn't like to see me stranded, so to
speak. This appearance of indifference, however, was but expression
of the philosophy of the nomad. As befitted members of the most
casual race of people in the world, casualness was one of their
outstanding characteristics.</p>

<p>I was soon to discover that they were perfectly willing to work,
anxious even, for when I selected a dozen or so of the strongest and
seemingly most intelligent and took them to my tent for a ration of
flour preparatory to beginning their labourings, they were followed
by a long procession of old men and young men, grand-mothers and
girls, children of all sizes, each of whom held out to me a broad
piece of bark, or an old jam-tin or other receptacle they had found
washed up on the beach, and asked for flour, and intimated that he,
or she, was going to work for me too. I wanted people to work--well,
here they were, the whole tribe, said one. They would all like some
of the tomahawks and knives I had spoken about, said another; and a
woman put out a finger and touched one of my bales of red cloth to
discover whether the colour would come off, and smiled when she found
it wouldn't.</p>

<p>They took for granted I would employ them, and regarded me
suspiciously when I gave flour only to the men I had engaged. One man
made remarks and gestures to the effect that he couldn't understand
why this was so. Why had I given flour to the others and not to him?
he asked. Had I not said I would give flour to those who worked for
me? He pushed a jam-tin insistently at me and towards the opened bag
of flour. Another--the large and savage-looking gentleman whom I had
first addressed on the subject of obtaining labourers--pointed out in
a mildly complaining fashion that a man could not work without food,
as he spoke shaking his head with the satisfied air of one uttering a
new truth of great wisdom and profundity.</p>

<p>I explained as best I could that I had not meant to employ them
all--that I couldn't employ them all, pointing to the flour-bags in
illustration of the fact that I had not sufficient to feed a number
such as this for more than a few days. I said also I hadn't work for
so many, and added that perhaps later I would be able to engage them.
I don't think these arguments impressed them at all. They had no idea
whatever of how many rations there were in a bag of flour, while as
for my statement that I hadn't work for so many they dearly thought
that the more people there were to do it the easier would be the
work. But they made no really serious complaint; and when I gave them
each a piece of tobacco and to one or two a ration of flour, they
lapsed into their old casualness and straggled back to the camp
perfectly content.</p>

<p>And now I encountered my first real difficulty, a difficulty
indeed which in all the years I was there I never wholly succeeded in
overcoming. It was that of teaching the natives the use of European
tools. As people accustomed to the implements of the Stone Age in
which they lived, implements such as a saw, chisel, hammer, and auger
were completely beyond them. Though they were quick to grasp the
purposes of these tools, they were exceedingly slow to learn to use
them effectively and without damage. Even the most intelligent was
liable to buckle a saw within two minutes, the repairing of which
would cost me, maybe, a full two hours' work. In fact, half my time
was occupied in repairing damage caused by my well-intentioned
Palaeolithic carpenters.</p>

<p>And after the house was completed and the felling of the jungle in
the making of the plantation was begun it was the same. Axe-handles
were broken with exasperating frequency and the edges chipped.
Sometimes half the labourers would be idle while I put in new
handles--a task I had always to undertake myself, for to delegate it
to one of the natives meant damage to the repairing tools. It was a
heart-breaking business, and as a means of remedying it I tried the
infliction of penalties--reducing a man's tobacco-ration, making him
work longer hours, and so forth--but all to no purpose, and I had at
last to remove the penalties, for the natives began to murmur at
being punished for accidents, and it was highly desirable that I
avoided letting them think I was a harsh and unjust man, for
primitive though they were they were profoundly aware that blame
should be attached to intention rather than to effect.</p>

<p>Another difficulty was in inducing them to rise early in the
morning. Each night it was the custom of the whole tribe to sit round
the camp-fires, chatting desultorily and now and then droning
fragments of dance-tunes, till midnight or later, with the result
that in the morning they were exceedingly loath to rise. Further,
they were accustomed to huge quantities of sleep. In their wild
roaming of the bush they slept whenever inclined. A man successful in
the chase, more or less cooked his capture, ate it and then went to
sleep. If when he awoke he was hungry, he went out on the chase once
more; if not, he turned over and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Also, they slept with such soundness that to awaken a man was
quite an achievement. The native way of doing it was to squat beside
the sleeper and in a low monotone continually repeat his name. Once
when I remarked that this seemed a slow process and made to shake the
sleeper awake, I was told in an alarmed tone that that would not do
at all.</p>

<p>The waking of a sleeper, it was explained, was a serious matter.
When a man slept, his spirit left his body and went roaming; a spirit
after being enclosed in a body for several hours, I was told, became
restless and liable to do its owner a mischief; and the awaking was
done slowly in order to give the spirit time to return, a body
without a spirit being a most dreadful phenomenon.</p>

<p>Instances were related to me of sleepers being awakened before
their spirits returned; and while most were of the mythical,
out-of-place and out-of-time order and devoid of significant details,
there was one with detail in plenty, and was besides a tale of Love
and Tragedy.</p>

<p>It was told to me by one of the Old Men of the tribe as he sat on
the verandah of the house one evening, with before us the darkling
spread of the sea and on either hand the tall black wall which was
the face of the jungle. The Old Man was very old, with a body so thin
that the bones of his shoulders showed pale through the dull
blackness of his skin; and he told the story with a sincerity and
impressiveness I have seldom seen excelled, despite the fact that his
exceedingly limited knowledge of English caused him to halt
frequently in search of a word, which more often than not he would so
utterly fail to find that he would resort to gestures and fragments
of native speech, some of which I by this time knew.</p>

<p>The chief actor in the affair, it appeared, was the Old Man's
brother, at the time a tall and strapping youth much skilled with the
spear and a warrior of such renown that in all the camps along the
beaches songs were made of him and his prowess. The Old Man
remembered some of these songs, though it was all so long ago; and in
a quavering, guttural voice he sang a little of one, the while
swaying his thin body to the simple rhythm of the tune. It was a
great song, that one, he said at the end, and had it been made about
himself he would have been a proud man indeed. But he had not been a
great spearman and warrior like his brother.. .</p>

<p>Then his brother took to wife a girl of a neighbouring tribe--a
handsome girl, straight of body and long of leg, with breasts firm
and round--a girl who had never had a man before, though many had
sought her, among them another warrior, a youth, who on the day of
the marriage fought her lover for her, only to be badly beaten. As
this happened in the presence of the whole tribe, the warrior-youth's
humiliation was great, and he resolved to be avenged; and that night,
spear in hand, he crept to where lay the newly married pair. The
bridegroom was asleep, but not so the girl; and she saw the other's
black form loom up clear against the sky, saw him stop a pace from
the sleeping man and raise his arm, the spear quivering like a living
thing. For a moment she lay there nerveless with fright; then with a
great cry she sprang up and over her husband, and diverted the point
of the descending spear.</p>

<p>And with that, said the Old Man tremulously, his brother awakened
and others of the tribe came running; and then commenced a great
wailing and beating of hands on foreheads, for though the bridegroom
was awake his eyes had no brightness in them, and his tongue hung out
as though it had no strength, and when he spoke there was no meaning
in his words. And from then on his wife went with him always, tending
his every want; and because of the great grief that was hers the
straightness of her body soon left her and her breasts lost their
firmness and roundness and drooped like those of an old, old woman;
and once at the full of the moon and once at the new she would cover
her body with ashes and with clay and go the place of her bridal
night and moan of her foolishness in so suddenly awakening her man,
though the touch of her foot on his body as she sprang, and her great
cry, had been engendered only by desire to protect him. And in the
pathetic hope that the roaming and homeless spirit might chance upon
its owner, she took her husband to sleep in a different place each
night.</p>

<p>But the spirit never returned, said the Old Man sadly, adding that
no doubt it still wandered homeless through the jungle, moaning
perhaps as that young bride had moaned. After which he for a time sat
silent, staring at the tall black wall of the trees, with his thin
head a little sidewise, as though listening. Then he rose stiffly and
after begging a piece of tobacco went down the steps and towards the
camp, the while singing gutturally to himself the song the tribes had
made of his brother's remarkable prowess.</p>

<p>As the time went on, the difficulties of my task increased. It
was, for instance, no easy matter to persuade the natives to work on
succeeding days. We worked yesterday and are tired and would rest,
they would say, adding pointedly that in their habitual mode of life
they worked not at all, and hunted only when need for food was on
them. Whereupon I would point out that in their wild life they had no
tobacco, or flour, or coloured cloth, or tinned meats or tinned fish,
or any other of the luxuries they coveted, and that the only way to
obtain them was by working all day and every day; and it would be
only after further and more elaborate argument of the kind that they
would take up again the hated tools of labour.</p>

<p>Then, they took an exceedingly long time over their meals. Even
when they rose early in the morning, they so dawdled over breakfast
as to be late for work. They ate with remarkable slowness, consuming
the food in small pieces, and masticating it most thoroughly--this
application of the principles of Fletcherism being due, no doubt, to
the need in their wanderings in parts where food was scarce to make
the most of whatever edibles they found. The midday meal was an even
lengthier affair, it being the principal meal of the day, and after
it, it was their wont immediately to go to sleep--and sleep away the
whole afternoon had I not gone to the camp and awakened them. A
lunchtime visit to the camp was one of my daily duties--and a most
irksome one, there being few things I disliked more than the lengthy
and provoking business of awakening sleeping natives. It was such a
dreadfully thankless task.</p>

<p>Again, their labours were often interrupted by the fact that it
was their age-old habit never to pass by food. Should a man in the
course of his cutting away the undergrowth come across the thin
trailing vine of a wild yam, he would at once abandon his attack on
the undergrowth in favour of digging the tuber, a matter which might
occupy an hour or more. Should a tree when it was felled prove to
have in it a wild bees' nest, the men who found it would do no more
felling till the nest was cut out. Should they disturb a wallaby or
other animal, all hands would immediately set off in pursuit,
abandoning their axes for the spears they kept always by them,
streaming off through the timber, calling directions one to another
regarding flanking the quarry and heading it off, and returning not
for an hour, or several hours maybe. To my remonstrances concerning
these interruptions they paid little heed, save to remark that the
wasting of food was not their fashion, and that because they worked
for me was no reason why they should no longer dig yams, dig out bees
or hunt wallabies.</p>

<p>Further, those of the labourers who were married were in the habit
of going off to the camp every now and then to see that all was well
with their wives. These people had a most absolute distrust of their
women. They believed no woman should be out of her husband's sight
for long. There was always some other man who desired her, I was
told, and as often as not the woman desired the man. It was quite an
easy matter to lose a woman, and the only thing for a husband to do
was to keep alert. There was one labourer who was missing several
times a day for this reason; but why he should have worried I do not
know, for his wife was by far the most unattractive woman in the camp
and somewhat elderly besides, in fact I suspected his anxiety was
merely a ruse to gain respite from his labouring--till one afternoon
I came across him spying the camp from behind a conveniently
concealing tree. I don't know, however, whether he was afraid or
merely hopeful.</p>

<p>Then, too, the heat distressed them--a circumstance which
surprised me. Cape York being so close to the Equator, the heat was,
of course, considerable; but I did not expect that the natives would
suffer from it. The trouble was that in their ordinary way of life
they stayed always in the shade when the sun was hottest, doing their
hunting and travelling only in the cool of the morning and evening,
while their duties at the plantation involved their being in the sun
all day, and, further, working in it--and till now they had never
performed work so hard as this. They gushed perspiration even more
freely than I had gushed it what time I worked at the building of the
house alone. They became quickly exhausted and had frequently to seek
rest and time for the gaining of breath. In ordinary circumstances
sustained effort of any kind was much to their distaste; but
sustained effort with an axe in the full blaze of midday was beyond
their powers. After a week or two I lengthened the midday interval
from one to three hours--an arrangement which shortened the
working-day accordingly, for it was quite useless to attempt getting
them to rise earlier in the morning and therefore start work earlier,
and the briefness of the tropical twilight made it impossible that
labours should be continued after sunset.</p>

<p>There was also need for constant supervision while they worked,
for if I left them at any time they would immediately sit down and
smoke or go to sleep--if they didn't chase wallabies or go spying on
their wives. They had an astonishing facility for going to sleep at
an instant's notice at any time or in any place. Often in those early
days did I return from a brief absence to find the whole of the
labourers stretched like black shadows on the ground. I tried
upbraiding them. It was no use. I tried ridiculing them--saying
scornfully that they worked like women or children, that they had
neither strength nor endurance. That was no use either; they had none
of that acute sense of shame I had noted among the Papuans and
Solomon Islanders and others. There were, in fact, no means by which
I could persuade them into sudden acceptance of a daily routine of
toil; and at last I saw that my only chance lay in gradually
accustoming them to it.</p>

<p>For a time the task appalled me. Never, I thought, would I succeed
in teaching regular habits to these nomadic creatures of impulse. I
was attempting the impossible. I was attempting to alter and fashion
to my liking the characters and habits of a people whose characters
and habits were as different from mine as the many thousand years
between our periods could possibly make them. The thing seemed
ridiculous--so much so that, despairing, I concluded there was much
wisdom in the warning of the wife of the trepang-vessel's captain and
in the sandalwood-cutter's adjectival declaration that I was a fool;
at these times I considered abandoning the whole venture as it stood,
that phrase of business advice, 'Let the first loss be the last,'
repeating itself to me with an insistence which would not be
denied.</p>

<p>But matters began to improve, and I took heart again and felt I
could not go. The place was growing on me. It was a most beautiful
spot. Straight in front, across two miles of smooth blue sea, was an
island, a large island with a backbone of gentle-sloped hills which
to each rising and setting of the sun were tipped with gold with fire
in it, and a white beach which at this distance was as a thread of
cotton tying the land to the sea. Beside it was another island, a
smaller one, but higher, with a row of brown serrated peaks, and its
nearest side a towering cliff which cast wide shadows on the blueness
of the sea. And in between and all about were various other islands,
some of them treeless dots of sand and coral, and sand-banks that
showed only at lowest tides, and reefs that showed not at all save in
a thin amorphous greening of the sea.</p>

<p>Then there was the beach, three miles or more of it, a broad and
sloping beach most generously curved and for the whole of its length
a pure french-grey, with at one end a rocky point, which gleamed
whitely with shells, and at the other the mangrove-fringed mouth of a
stream, which made across the greyness of the sand a thread of
silver. And back from the beach in one place were hills that invited
one to drink from cool streams about their feet and then ascend their
easy slopes and rest on the softness of their grass; and in another
place was a serpentine lagoon, five or more acres in extent, edged
wholly by thickly foliaged vines with scarlet berries bunched about
the greenness of their leaves, and all of it covered by water-lilies
like great blue plates, with upright in the centre of each a small
white flower shaped perfectly in the manner of an egg-cup and as
delicately translucent as finest china.</p>

<p>And added to all this there was the thought that while it would be
a fine thing indeed if I succeeded in making of this black man's
jungle a white man's garden, it would be a finer thing still if I
succeeded in turning a whole people from wandering idleness to habits
of industry. With my taking of heart, it seemed to me that it might
possibly be done after all. It did not occur to me that the natives
were happier as they were. It did not occur to me that the creating
in them of needs and desires hitherto utterly foreign would also
create in them the necessity for satisfying those needs and desires,
to the consequent destruction of the more or less complacent ease of
their existence.</p>

<p>Nor did it occur to me there was anything incongruous in the fact
that I who had for so long been a wandering idler should set such a
store on industriousness.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3"></a>Chapter Three</h2>

<h3>THE PEOPLE WHO STOOD STILL</h3>

<p>I made myself as comfortable as possible. I was not at all minded
to endure personal discomfort such as I had seen others endure in the
wilds. Often in my wanderings I had told myself that should I ever
settle down I would make my house a Home, not just a shelter from the
weather and a place wherein to sleep. So it was that, liking
roominess I made the house a full sixty feet each way--an extravagant
size for a one-man dwelling--and built along the front and down one
side a verandah of satisfying width. There was one large room, in
which I ate in solitary state and listened to the troubles of the
natives, and a smaller room, in which I slept. The floors were
covered entirely with closely woven mats I had garnered in Papua and
elsewhere--mats that were love-gifts, mats that were tokens of
blood-brotherhood, and mats that had come to me by the unromantic
ways of trade, with dexterously attached to each a fringe of beaten
hibiscus-bark dyed cunningly a dozen hues. Furniture I contrived from
packing-cases and the like, and covered it with cloth from my stores.
At the back was the kitchen with in one corner a fireplace having a
chimney of galvanized iron laboriously rounded, and on the walls
shelves made from the flattened bark of trees; and a little above the
beach, near an everlasting fresh-water spring, I made a bathroom and
installed a homemade shower.</p>

<p>And all about the house I planted a fence of growing shrubs, some
with such variegation of leaf that in the brightness of the sun they
made a twinkling of gold and green and bronze, some that gave forth
continually strings of entwined blue flowers, and some that were
crested by spiralled leaves pointing directly upwards--with through
them and about shrubs of no outstanding beauty, but remarkable for
the variety and subtlety of their scents. And the great wide verandah
I enclosed with a screen of jungle-canes and hung with growing
orchids--blue orchids and red orchids, and orchids yellow like
sunsets, and orchids whose leaves were lost in a smother of small
pink-and-white blossoms that were as the faces of laughing baby imps.
And as a further comfort and convenience I had a lugger-captain who
occasionally came my way bringing me from Thursday Island an
acetylene-gas outfit and piping, which I installed in each of the
rooms and at three places on the verandah, so that when all the jets
were lit the place was one white blaze of light.</p>

<p>I had thought that at least this light would surprise the natives
out of the nonchalance with which they accepted unusual things. But
after a gasp of astonishment at the first quick flaring of the jets,
they made neither remark nor comment, but regarded the light as idly
as though this turning of night into day was the most ordinary
circumstance of their lives. The fact was that they considered the
thing inexplicable, and it was not their fashion to attempt solving
the inexplicable. They merely accepted it as something beyond their
understanding, and let it go at that.</p>

<p>But they showed a decided interest for things they did understand.
There was, for instance, the fact that I should build a house. They
could see no necessity for building a house, and still less a house
so elaborate as this; and they asked why I should not be content with
a dwelling such as they themselves used--dwellings which were merely
a sheet or two of tree-bark so laid on a crude frame of sticks as to
be scarcely more than a sloping wall--dwellings which they built
always back to wind or rain and in response to change of direction in
wind or rain merely turned bodily around. There seemed to them no
sense whatever in taking such trouble as I was taking.</p>

<p>They were interested, too, in the hibiscus fringes of my Papuan
mats, at first sight of them exclaiming in wonder and calling one to
another to come and look, and often thereafter coming individually to
the house in order to peer at them closely and feel their texture and
smell them even, and to ask me the manner and habits of the plants
from which they came--the reason for all this interest being that
they knew the fringes for things of a tropical growth, but, there
being no hibiscus in their own jungles, as a tropical growth new to
them, a matter therefore deserving of the greatest attention.</p>

<p>For they had a remarkably intimate knowledge and understanding of
the bush and the ways and the life of the bush. Indeed, they were
more conversant with their environment than any natives I had seen.
In New Guinea a man might know a deal about fish and crabs and other
creatures of the sea, and but little about the creatures of the land,
because he was a member of that section of tribe which did little
else than fish. In the Solomons a man might have an immense knowledge
of the animal- and bird-life of his island, and but a superficial
knowledge of its vegetable-life. These Cape York people all knew all
there was to know of their surroundings--a circumstance due to the
fact that being nomads who lived on what they could catch or find
there was need to know where these things could be found, and be
informed of their edible or non-edible qualities, for in the matter
of food-hunting it was mainly a case of each man for himself. Though
in some ways they lived communally, in this way they were strongly
individualistic.</p>

<p>But this wide knowledge of theirs was in nowise ragged or untidy.
It was systematized and regulated. For each department of animate and
inanimate nature they had a system of nomenclature as comprehensively
complete as that which any trained scientist could have devised; and
they knew the relationships of the various departments, and the
significance of the relationships one to another. And all this
information they carried in their heads, they having no means of
writing whatever, and so indelibly was it impressed upon their
memories that any one of them, even the children, could at any time
deliver an impromptu and most enlightening dissertation regarding,
say, a weed plucked haphazard, telling of its flowering and seeding
times, its habitats and habits, of its preference for one kind of
soil and aversion from another kind of soil, with the reasons for
this preference and aversion, and so on through a multitude of
details, all told with a simple matter-of-factness tinged with wonder
that I should need to be told these things at all. I think they
thought me a most ignorant person.</p>

<p>Indeed, one man asked me how it was I knew so little of these
things; and I told him that what to him were the simplest facts of
life were to us matters for investigation by learned men. Whereupon
he looked at me for a time as though doubting that such a state of
affairs could really be, and at length remarked that he had not
thought that among whites it was the fashion for the many to be
ignorant and only the few to be wise, and opined decisively that
there must be something wrong with the constitution and government of
my tribe.</p>

<p>Then he said it was not right I should go about without knowing of
the things about me, and if I liked he would appoint himself my
teacher, so that in due course I should become as knowledgeable as he
and his fellows. I accepted the offer. It was, I thought, a fine
opportunity of gaining a knowledge of matters of which I knew little
or nothing. So, from then on I spent much of what spare time I had in
the native's company, while he taught me from his amazing store of
knowledge in a language made up of gutturally produced native words
and words he thought were English, but were quite unlike any English
I had heard, at the meaning of which medley I was sometimes driven to
make flying guesses and sometimes understood, and as often was driven
to abandon as quite beyond me. Even his name was such a confusion of
mostly consonant sounds that very soon I changed it to Jimmy, a
change which he accepted with the casualness with which his race
accepted most things.</p>

<p>But Jimmy soon tired of teaching me the ordinary and commonplace.
Perhaps he found I was not so apt a pupil as he had hoped. Perhaps he
privately concluded that it was hopeless to attempt teaching one of a
race where all were ignorant save a few. He developed a flair for
telling me of the extraordinary and bizarre. On the shore-reef he
showed me a rifle-fish--so called because of its habit of shooting
with a drop of water insects which flew close to the water. He showed
me, among the roots of the mangrove trees edging the mouth of the
creek at the beach's end, queer slimy fish which dung to the wood or
climbed about it. From the beach he pointed across the sea and asked
if I saw there, upright, an inch or two above the surface, a thing
like the hand of a man; and when I had found it, he said it was the
sail of a fish which used the wind to propel it, but that it was
something in the way of being a fool of a fish, in that it had no way
of steering, and so was quite unable to avoid an enemy.</p>

<p>He showed me the Dance of the Birds. The Birds, of a kind known
colloquially as Native Companions, were long-legged creatures, tall
almost as storks, and white and grey of feather; and the dance took
place in the centre of a broad, dry swamp, from the edge of which, in
a place of concealment, we watched. There were some hundreds of them,
and their dance was in the manner of quadrille, but in the matter of
rhythm and grace excelling any quadrille that ever was. In groups of
a score or more they advanced and retreated, lifting high their long
legs and standing on their toes, now and then bowing gracefully one
to another, now and then one pair encircling with prancing daintiness
a group whose heads moved upwards and downwards and sidewise in time
to the stepping of the pair. At times they formed into one great
prancing mass, with their long necks thrust upward; and the wide
swaying of their backs was like the swaying of the sea. Then,
suddenly, as if in response to an imperative command, they would sway
apart, some of them to rise in low, encircling flight, and some to
stand as in little gossiping groups; and presently they would form in
pairs and sets of pairs, and the prancing and the bowing, and
advancing and retreating would begin all over again.</p>

<p>Then, from the unusual and spectacular Jimmy proceeded to the
mystical and superstitious. He told engagingly of many quaint and
wholly unbelievable myths, though believing in them himself
thoroughly the while. There was the story of the Listening and Seeing
Trees--trees half of whose leaves were the ears and half the eyes of
a certain spirit charged with the duty of reporting to husbands the
unfaithfulness of their wives. They grew dangerously convenient to
the camps, said Jimmy, but the trouble was that no man knew them from
their fellows--a condition of affairs which imposed upon philanderers
need for extreme caution. The cunning with which the spirit concealed
itself was disconcerting, Jimmy added a little complainingly.</p>

<p>There was the story of the God Without a Job--a deity which
wandered disconsolately about the jungles and the neighbourhood of
the camp, moaning softly, like a woman wailing, the reason of his
workless condition being that far back in the beginning of things,
when man first learned to walk upright like a kangaroo, instead of on
all fours like a dog, and gods were first appointed, upon him was
laid the duty of punishing pre-marriage promiscuity, which was then a
sin, but now was a sin no more. Jimmy said he almost felt sorry for
this god whom the converting of a vice into a virtue had deprived of
his occupation; and in case I should doubt the truth of the story, he
gave me a wooden shield upon which was carved a likeness of the
homeless spirit's face; and he said that should I doubt still further
I had but to listen keenly on the first still, dark night, and maybe
I would hear him wailing.</p>

<p>These natives had the lowest sexual standards of any I had met. In
fact, save in the manner of adultery, they seemed to have no
standards at all--and even adultery was regarded more as an
encroachment on a man's possessive right than an infringement of any
ethical code. Freely and without concealment the unmarried girls gave
themselves to the young men of the tribe and to visitors from other
tribes, sometimes in exchange for a coveted article of ornament or
use, but oftener because such acts were to them as natural as eating
or sleeping.</p>

<p>But though in promiscuity as promiscuity no evil was seen, it was
distinctly a sin for an unmarried woman to bear a child, so much so
that usually the woman would be speared to death and the child's
brain dashed out with a dub, the reason for this dreadful treatment
being that with all this traffic among the non-married there was no
telling who the father of the child might be, and that were the child
allowed to grow up inbreeding might result. Inbreeding, and
consequent lowering of physical standards, was to them a cardinal
sin, for their very existence, individually and racially, depended on
bodily fitness. But because of their knowledge of the abortive
qualities of herbs and the like, illegitimate children were extremely
rare. In all my eight years at Cape York they happened only twice,
and in each case the girls were saved from being speared to death by
the fact that their babies were born dead and undeveloped.</p>

<p>These people were possessed of a remarkable physical endurance.
Any one of them was able to exist without food for periods up to a
week, and, camel-like, could go without a drink for days. They were
tireless travellers; journeying through the jungles they would swing
along hour after hour with an ease of gait which made light of
obstructions and took no heed of even the steepest slope, walking
from the hips and with their bodies stiffly erect, the while making
for their objective with astonishing directness of line.</p>

<p>It was impossible for them to be lost in the bush, even in bush
unfamiliar to them. A most unfailing sense of direction and locality
was theirs. One of them, a man named Kaio, furnished an illustration
of this. He was an old man, sixty or more maybe, which among these
short-lived people was a very considerable age, but still well set up
and with a breadth of shoulder which told of a strength that had once
been his; and he told me the story himself, though neither boastingly
nor with pseudo-casualness calculated to heighten the effect, but in
the manner of one who tells of his natural performance of a natural
act.</p>

<p>It happened some time before my arrival at Cape York. Kaio had
killed a man who, he said with great and impressive simplicity, the
Spirit of a Listening and Seeing Tree de-dared was the paramour of
his wife; and the killing of a man in such circumstances being in no
way remarkable, Kaio had soundly thrashed his wife, added one to the
number of the notches on the haft of his spear, washed its point
clean of blood, and put the matter from his mind. But, presently, a
police-boat, cruising the coast, put in at the camp, and the captain,
hearing the story of the slaying, arrested Kaio on a charge of murder
and set off with him on the long sail down the Peninsula's coast, for
a place of civilization and courts and magistrates.</p>

<p>This proceeding puzzled Kaio extremely. He could not understand
this law of the whites which said: 'Thou shalt not kill.' Why should
he not kill the man who had stolen his wife? he asked the
police-boat's captain again and again, the while begging for release.
He had merely obeyed the law of the tribe, he said, adding that
surely there was no evil in obeying the law. But the captain took no
heed, and at last Kaoi determined to release himself.</p>

<p>So, one dark night when the craft lay anchored offshore, some four
hundred miles from his home, Kaio avoided the vigilance of his
watchers, blackened the soles of his feet with charcoal, so that they
would be as invisible to sharks as the rest of him, abandoned his
prisoner's dress and, naked as on the day of his nativity, slipped
overside and away.</p>

<p>He told me that when he reached the beach he was more exhausted
than ever he had been in his life. The swim had been one of three
full miles--a not very remarkable distance for one accustomed to the
water as he was--but there was against him all the way a tide of such
swinging strength that he would have never reached the shore at all
had he not been well-versed in the tricks of swimming against a
tide--tricks such as lying half across its direction, somewhat in the
manner of a ship sailing on a head-wind; and discovering and using
favouring cross-currents that swirled about scraps of reef and other
comparative shallows; and diving beneath a surface current and
progressing in the dead water beneath.</p>

<p>But compared with his long tramp home, that swim was as a trifle.
Those four hundred miles overflowed with difficulties for a naked and
unarmed traveller. The only inhabitants were tribes as savage as
Kaio's own, and in their attitude to strangers as hostile. Always was
he in danger of being seen, for the tribes were to be met often in
unsuspected places. Sometimes he averted discovery only by the
narrowest margin; once he had scarcely time to crawl into a hollow
log to escape a party of hunters swinging along, spears in hand;
another time he blundered almost directly on top of a camp hidden
behind a clump of jungle--so close was he indeed that the dogs smelt
him and set up a loud barking, and some of the men lounging about the
huts took their throwing clubs and came out a little way to search,
the women of the tribe chattering excitedly the while; but--because
of Kaio's great skill in concealing himself--they found nothing and
went back and abused the dogs for raising a false alarm.</p>

<p>Then there were rivers with banks so high that the finding of a
crossing-place added many weary miles to his journey; and near the
coast were creeks whose beaches bore spoor of man-eating crocodiles,
which he had no means of crossing other than by taking the dreadful
risk of swimming.</p>

<p>Then there was the task of obtaining food. Much of the vegetation
of this land was foreign to him, and, fearing to poison himself, he
left it mostly alone. So, on coming to a place of hard flints, he
spent a full day fashioning a cutting-tool of stone; then he sought
and found a long straight stick and spent another full day with his
cutting-tool making it into a spear; and with this he hunted birds
and the smaller of the marsupials he now and then came across, eating
them raw for he feared to make a fire.</p>

<p>And all the while he headed north. The North was Home. No matter
what deviations he made in search of food or in the avoidance of
danger, he came back to the north-line as though it had been a
straight, broad highway, instead of mere direction through the
trackless bush. Often he travelled at night, for darkness made no
difference to the straightness of his course. It was not a matter of
taking bearings. He knew direction as a horse is said to know it, or
a homing pigeon, and all the twistings and turnings of his
journeyings and all the unfamiliarities of the land could not confuse
him.</p>

<p>And so at last, after seeing on the way the rising of two full
moons and almost that of a third, he came Home, somewhat thin from
privation, but strong and healthy and eager for the welcome of his
friends and acclamation of his skill in traversing four hundred miles
of hostile country without having once been seen.</p>

<p>But, said Kaio, his friends were not at all pleased to see him.
They were, in fact, considerably disconcerted; when he strode
triumphantly into the camp; his rough-made spear in his hand and the
scars of jungle-thorns fresh and numerous on the nakedness of his
skin, there was instead of a shout of welcome only the chorused
barking of the dogs and a wide astonished staring from the people.
Then it was explained that they had not thought he would return; the
captain of the police-boat, they said, had told them he would be hung
with a rope till he died, as would happen to any others of the tribe
who killed a man. Wherefore his wife had taken to herself another
husband; and the tribe had made a sorrow-dance for Kaio and a
joy-dance and feast in honour of the marriage; and from the manner in
which they told him these things it appeared they thought it most
inconsiderate of him to return.</p>

<p>But, Kaio went on brightly, although he was at first greatly
angered and was quick to take the woman away from her new husband and
thrash her even more soundly than he had thrashed her before, it all
turned out for the best. For his feat in returning safely home made
him renowned for skill in bushcraft and as a possessor of all the
manly qualities, and brought from the other women of the tribe such
admiring glances and expressions that his wife never looked again at
another man, but remained most faithful and dutiful for fear she
should lose him. And the police-boat captain thereafter left him in
peace, thinking, no doubt, that a man who could come safely through a
journey like that fully deserved to escape.</p>

<p>Like their neighbours, the Torres Islanders, these people were
great dancers--so much so that often the work of the plantation would
be held up for days, for once they began their dancing there was not
telling when they would cease; intoxicated by rhythm and tune, they
went on and on till utterly exhausted. Also, anything made an excuse
for an outbreak of dancing--a birth, a death, the capture of a
kangaroo. And often there was no excuse at all. In the cool of the
dusk the tribe would be about their camp, the women tending the
cooking-fires and gossiping, the men lying on their sides on the
sand, smoking or sleeping, the children splashing in the shallows of
the beach--when suddenly, as though something had stung him, a man
would begin singing in a high falsetto which had in it a curiously
challenging note; and for a space of maybe half a minute he would
sing; then he would rise slowly, dreamily, with in his eyes an empty
stare, and alternately beat his hands against his sides and raise
them wide apart above his head; and in a slow succession of rounded
notes the falsetto would go down, down, down, down, half an octave at
a time, to a living throbbing drone. Then another would vent the
curiously challenging note, then another and another, each making the
play with his hands as he rose; and soon the women would abandon
their cooking and join in, and the children come running from the
beach; and presently the men would whiten their faces and their
bodies with day and adorn their heads with feathers of coloured
birds, and the women hang about their breasts strings of
orchid-flowers and with white ashes make phallic markings on their
groins; and then, to the accompaniment of the Old Men beating one
piece of flat wood sharply against another, the dancing would
begin--a mad, glad dancing, highly sexual and sensual, full of
rhythmic leaps and swayings, with all the while a roaring four-note
song which brought echoes from the jungle and went out across the sea
like sounds of devils screaming.</p>

<p>And I, watching and listening, would think despondently of work
not done and curse heartily the man who began the uproar and wish
fervently I knew some way of stopping them.</p>

<p>For it was highly inadvisable that I should attempt personally to
intervene. At any ordinary time the risk was present that they would
spear me, if only in order to possess themselves of coveted goods in
my store-room. At any ordinary time the risk was present that they
might take it into their heads that I was an interloper, and avenge
with clubs my usurpation of their land and destruction of their
food-producing jungles. These were ordinary, everyday risks which
might at any time become acute. But to attempt stopping their dancing
was to take a risk I did not dare to take, for with their eyes
rolling extravagantly, their faces working grotesquely, and about
their mouths the wetness of foam, they were as madmen--indeed,
perhaps they were truly madmen for the time--who in their frenzy
might have thought nothing of driving a spear through my heart.
Anything was possible from savages so worked up as these were when
dancing. The ordinary, everyday risks of my life were quite enough
without one like this.</p>

<p>There were other practices with which I was careful not to
interfere, though often I was impelled to. One was their custom of
keeping the bodies of their dead for months before burying them. At
some period during the dance following a death, the body was bound
tightly with jungle-canes so split and shredded as to be pliable
almost as silk, and then wrapped in many thicknesses of paper-bark,
and placed in a more or less secluded part of the camp, where it
would remain till such time as it was reduced to somewhat a third of
its original size. Then a blood-relative of the deceased took
possession of the dreadful parcel and kept it in his hut, sleeping
and eating beside it; and when the tribe went on its wanderings the
parcel went with them, being carried on the head of a woman were it
light enough, otherwise a man taking it upon his back, or two men
reeving it on a pole and suspending it between them on their
shoulders. Sometimes I found one of the bundles on the ground near
the labourers as they worked--a bundle which someone would perhaps
inform me contained the body of his father, and he would remove it
from the way of a falling tree with the same casual roughness as he
would remove, say, a heap of tools.</p>

<p>They were an extremely affectionate people, and I think this
keeping with them of their dead was due to reluctance so to sever
association with their relatives as by burying them. There may have
been, however, some tribal significance in the practice, some
superstitious belief--such a belief that a man who was dead was very
much like a man asleep, in so far that his spirit was wandering, and
that if they carried him about maybe the spirit would discover him
and bring him to life again. In fact, I once gathered a hint that a
belief like this had something to with the practice.</p>

<p>But I never could gather any definite knowledge of the reason, for
though I frequently inquired, I was answered only with frowns and
pretended non-understanding and much fingering of weapons; and I
became acutely aware that I was one man among a multitude and that
discretion was a thing of greater value than curiosity.</p>

<p>Another of their customs was to remove the central incisor tooth
of their female adolescents, the removing being done by placing on
the tooth the edge of a thin, flat stone and striking it repeatedly
with another and heavier stone--an operation which necessitated the
girl being held forcibly on her back on the ground, a man to each of
her legs and arms and another to her head, and brought from her such
agonizing yells that the first time I heard it I thought someone was
being slowly murdered, and, arming myself, hastened to try and
prevent it.</p>

<p>The operation was over when I arrived, and the mother of the girl
was laving her daughter's mouth with a mixture of sea-water and clay
and sand, and with her naked forearm wiping away the blood. A number
of women were gathered about them, looking at the tooth, passing it
from one to another, and apparently commenting on its shape and size.
One tried to fit it to the place from where her own incisor tooth had
been removed at the time of her reaching womanhood. A man seated in
the shade had the operating-stones in his hands and was making
phallic markings with them on the ground. Every now and then he would
beat the stones together and utter a single singing note. No one took
heed of my presence--till I asked the meaning of the dentistry.</p>

<p>Then there was a general moving away from me and looks of
consternation, and the only one who would answer was my old friend
Jimmy, who said that the tooth was removed in order that the girl
could 'drink water more better', but saying it as though he
considered me a most inquisitive person regarding matters which did
not concern me, and therefore deserving of a snub. I think, however,
that the custom had something of a totemic significance.</p>

<p>From fondness for their dogs arose a most objectionable custom.
They valued their dogs quite as much as they valued their children;
wherefore a woman thought it quite in order to suckle at her breast a
pup which had lost its mother, or one sickly and in need of special
attention.</p>

<p>'This poor feller small-dog not much strong feller, and brothers
belong him not let him drink longa his mother,' was what a woman
nourishing a pup in this way said when I asked her to explain the
occurrence.</p>

<p>In my early days at Cape York this practice was exceedingly
common. I frequently saw a woman with a pup at one breast and a child
at the other--and often the pup was receiving more attention than the
child. But in response to my earnest solicitations regarding the
liability of disease to children so reared, the custom became less
and less common, till at last it was abandoned altogether. They were
always ready to listen to anything I might say regarding bodily
fitness. The primitive conditions of their lives demanded that
everyone should be fit as possible.</p>

<p>Long of snout and body, and in gait and general appearance
curiously wolf-like, the dogs were of an inbred species of wild-dog,
or 'dingo'--of which in this country there were considerable
numbers--and were nasty, slinking things which snapped rather than
bit, snarled rather than barked, and were given to sitting on their
haunches and howling in single notes which were each sustained for
periods of almost incredible length--and howl so upon any occasion
and apparently for no reason. Often in the middle of the night I was
awakened by the sudden howling of a dog, and kept awake indefinitely,
for presently others would join in, each venting a note in a
different key, and still others, till at length the whole of them
were at it; then would come the gruff and angered voices of men
disturbed from sleep, and the shrill rebuking of women; and the quiet
of the night was gone utterly in a confusion of discordant sounds
which would become harsher, louder, and more intense till I felt I
could bear it no longer. Then, at the end of half an hour perhaps,
the howling of the dogs would slowly die and the shrill and angered
voices cease, and the night resume in solemn brooding; and in the
morning someone or other would explain that the dogs had come 'sorry
along themselves', and remark that it was only with great difficulty
that he had refrained from thrashing them.</p>

<p>Seldom were the dogs thrashed or treated with other than the
greatest indulgence. A man would himself go hungry rather than his
dog should go hungry. At mealtimes the animals took their haunched
positions in the circle of the eating natives and shared morsel for
morsel with them, and insistently demanded more--and received
it--when they were not getting enough. Should one of them become
injured in any way, it was treated with infinite care and tenderness;
I knew a woman once to sit up all through a night macerating herbs
into poultices and applying them to the broken leg of a dog so old,
attenuated and scaly that it would have been better dead. In the
matter of having kindness lavished upon them and being pampered
generally, these slinking, snarling creatures were quite as well off
as any fashionable lap-dog. These dogs were intensely disliked by a
dog which was presented to me by the captain of the store-ship--a
hefty and well-bred bull-terrier named Togo. Togo would have nothing
whatever to do with the camp's dogs. He considered himself their
infinite superior, and upon every occasion showed it, repulsing their
friendly approaches and ignoring their attempts to quarrel with him,
walking past them as though he hadn't seen them, with his head held
high and in his gait a curious disdainful stiffness--all of which led
the natives to remark of him scornfully that because he belonged to a
white man he thought himself a white man too. They resented Togo's
slighting of their dogs much more than they would have resented any
slighting of themselves.</p>

<p>Despite their non-morality and revolting practices, they were
possessed of many admirable qualities. As their vices were abundant,
so were their virtues abundant. Like certain cannibal friends of mine
in New Guinea and elsewhere, they respected age and the wisdom that
accompanied age, were seldom guilty of mean actions and of cowardly
ones not at all. Lying was most infrequent, and stealing--other than
the stealing of women--more infrequent still; with perfect safety I
could leave my house unlocked and open and its contents entirely
unguarded in my absence. They tended to their sick or injured with
infinite solicitude. I knew them to make great sacrifices for one
another; on one occasion I saw a youth go to the rescue of a man who,
swimming a creek, was attacked and wounded by a shark, and with his
bare hands fight back the shark till he had the injured man in
safety.</p>

<p>And they did these things without quite any idea of displaying a
virtue. They didn't know there were such things as virtues. They
didn't know there were such things as vices. An act was just an
act--neither virtuous nor vicious. To them there was no distinction
between original sin and original good.</p>

<p>For, as members of perhaps the oldest living race of people in the
world, they were ten thousand years behind the times. They had not
reached the stage of ethical and moral distinctions. While the rest
of the world strode forward to the age of steel, they had remained
far back in the age of stone.</p>

<p>They were the People Who Stood Still.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4"></a>Chapter Four</h2>

<h3>MARY BROWN</h3>

<p>But there was one who had made considerable progress in the
civilized arts, even to having a civilized name--a woman called Mary
Brown, who, a half-year after my arrival, landed at the camp from a
Thursday Island lugger and presently came to me declaring herself an
efficient house-servant--a little woman, old, pleasing of expression
though distinctly unhandsome of feature, bareheaded and barefooted in
the manner of her kind, and dressed in a skirt of printed cotton and
a blouse which came down not quite far enough, and so revealed at her
waist, like a belt, a strip of her dull black skin.</p>

<p>Hitherto I had had no one to attend my personal needs--but not
because of any scarcity of would-be servants, for perquisites so made
the position a coveted one that almost every day someone or other
would apply, usually a woman, but now and then a man, often a wild
and woolly person with smears of clay from the last dance still about
his naked body. But as house-servants they were even more
unsatisfactory than they were as plantation-labourers. The only
cooking they knew was the cooking of the camp, which wasn't cooking
at all, but merely throwing the raw food on an open fire and, if
hunger pressed, taking it off when scarcely warmed, otherwise leaving
it an indefinite time, till perhaps it was unrecognizably shrivelled
and burned. In the matter of cleanliness they were just as casual;
their bodies were washed only when the rains came drenching
down--which, however, was frequently enough--or when fishing they
waded deeply, or in journeying swam a stream; and their huts they
neither swept nor tidied, but from time to time moved them bodily to
cleaner patches of ground. Indeed, their usefulness as house-servants
was, in round figures, nil; and after various trials and attempts at
teaching them I was at last compelled to reject their applications
and 'do' for myself in every way, even to scraping the pots and
washing the clothes, all of which caused me exceeding
dissatisfaction, for the heat and burden of the plantation day were
sufficient without a round of domestic offices.</p>

<p>Wherefore it was with considerable doubting that I engaged Mary
Brown. But the doubting soon vanished. Mary was fully as efficient as
she claimed to be. For her experience as a servant had begun as a
child, she having been stolen from the camp by a pearler needing
house-help for his half-caste wife in his Thursday Island home.</p>

<p>In the best English I had heard any of these natives use, Mary
said it was a long time ago. A very long time ago. Thursday Island
was now a place of streets and shops and houses of wood and iron, and
the people were quiet people who never made rows or killed one
another, or anything--at least not often. But in those days there
were no streets, and many of the houses were of grass-thatch, and the
people were a wild and angry people, always drinking and fighting and
shooting and doing like that. That would tell me how long ago it
was.</p>

<p>'But,' she went on, 'that pearler, he was not like them others.
No! He was a quiet, good man, and kind like anything, and when I was
growed-up a little bit he made me his wife, and I thinked inside
myself that I would stay with him always.</p>

<p>'But his half-caste wife, she thinked 'nother way, and made
trouble. Big trouble. She came jealous. Half-caste women, they come
proper bad when they come jealous; and one night when I sleeped she
sticked me two times with a knife. You look this mark here on middle
of my chest, and here on my leg. And she sticked the pearler too,
cause he waked up and tried to stop her; and always after he got one
mark on his arm. My word, Master, I close up dead that night!</p>

<p>'After that I ran 'way and not go back to that good pearler any
more, 'cause I fright' of that half-caste; and I go to work for one
missionary missus, who make me wear proper clothes and look out
always I not play round with man, which is fashion of missionary
missus. And she make me call myself Mary Brown, like I got white skin
and straight hair, and tell me I not heathen girl any more, and make
me go to church like anything and pray Our Father in Heaven, and wash
plates and scrub floors and make beds and skin potatoes, and do like
that always, always--till by and by I get plenty tired and think
inside myself of the camp and of my father and of my mother, and
after six months I sneaked on board a cutter and came back here and
talked inside I never go 'way any more.'</p>

<p>She went back, nevertheless, for though she had promptly and
completely shed her refinements and become as much one of her tribe
as if she had never left it, there came a time when those refinements
returned, when the crude foods and crude housing repelled her, and
hunting appeared a most unreliable method of obtaining a meal, and
the dirt seemed unnecessarily excessive and the plethora of dogs a
nuisance, and she longed acutely for the civilization she had
deserted, and wages to spend, and new dresses of print with bright
flowers on it, and many things besides. She went back--to various
adventures and experiences, one of which was employment by a Chinese
storekeeper, and because of his fiercely amorous approaches running
away from him at the end of three days, and, another, serving as a
waitress at a sly-grog hotel, a matter which brought her into
conflict with the police and to a week's imprisonment--and after a
time the wild and the freedom of the wild called to her again, and
she returned to the camp and her people; but only in due course again
to become dissatisfied and restless once more to long acutely for the
things she had not, so that there was nothing for it but to cross the
strait again to jobs and adventures and experiences. And so, for more
years than she knew, she had come and gone, alternating between
desire for the old life of the camp and the new life of the town, the
while being satisfied with neither.</p>

<p>So it was that she was eager for me to employ her and to employ
her always, for by so doing she would obtain the things she craved
and at the same time be amid her beloved wilds and with her
people.</p>

<p>'I think,' she said once, with pathetic earnestness, 'that God He
tell you to come here and give me job, so that no more I go 'way and
come back all the time. I tired of doin' like that. Tired. For, my
body it comes old. Yes--God He good friend to me, like I heard
missionary man say plenty times, though I not believe him
before.'</p>

<p>Mary Brown made a deal of difference to my life at Cape York. In
fact, but for her I don't think I would have stayed there so long as
I did. Not only did she relieve me of the domestic offices--Mary
Brown was something a great deal more than a mere washer of dishes
and a cooker of foods, though she performed these services with an
excellence I had long since ceased to expect in a woman of her
race--she was a Personality, and the note of her personality was
Cheerfulness. Never did this cheerfulness desert her, and in a way
nothing else could have done, it pervaded the house and deprived it
of that dull and depressing sameness which is a feature of one-man
dwellings such as mine. Many a time did it win me from the cross
humours of a long and weary day. Many a time did it cause me to smile
when I thought nothing in the world would have caused me to smile.
And when, as frequently happened, I lay ill with New Guinea fever and
cared not whether I lived, but feared rather that I would, she would
stay beside me always, now and then rising from her cross-legged
position on the floor to lay a thin hand on my face and exclaim in
well-simulated surprise that the fire in my blood was cooling
quickly; or maybe she would place on my forehead a poultice of herbs
she herself had collected and lovingly macerated, the while with
buoyant decisiveness declaring the herbs unfailing defeaters of
fever; and then she would squat again and with elaborate unconcern
strive to hide the anxiety in her eyes. There was a great,
whole-hearted courage beneath the cheerfulness of black, unhandsome
Mary Brown.</p>

<p>Holding to the belief that it was not good for a woman to live
alone, Mary in the course of her career had had a husband or two,
besides a varied assortment of lovers; but by reason of her many
comings and goings each of these attachments had been of a more or
less temporary nature. Now that she was definitely settled, however,
she determined on what she called a 'long-time' marriage, and one day
brought to the house the man of her choice--a sinuously-limbed
individual, some years her junior, with a trick of screwing up his
mouth and one eye and holding his head sidewise--and asked would I
mind marrying them in the white-man manner.</p>

<p>When I replied that I had no power to perform marriages, she was
not at all distressed, but said she knew I had not the power, and had
come to me only because she had thought I might like to be asked, she
being my personal servant and me a white man, and all that, and that
it didn't matter a bit. They could marry in the native manner.
Indeed, she doubted whether she would have cared for the white-man
manner, as she had seen it performed at the mission and found it a
mournful business, the priest and everybody, even the bride, having
straight and solemn faces, and the singing being like a wail, and
some of the women crying as though it were a funeral.</p>

<p>Certainly there was nothing sad or solemn about the native manner
of marrying. But that was chiefly because there was no ceremony, or
anything approaching a ceremony, not even a public announcing of the
pair as man and wife; for in the matter of taking a life-partner
these natives were as casual as they were in all else, and all that
was needed was that the man gave it out to his friends--in the manner
of one making a statement of but passing interest--that he had made
arrangements with the woman and that from then on the lady was his
wife; and there the matter ended, save for a feast, accompanied by a
dance, at a date to be determined by unusual abundance of food.</p>

<p>In Mary's case there was neither feast nor dance, then or at any
other time, for Mary in her great affection for me was so keen on
seeing the making of the plantation progress that she refused to
allow it to be interrupted by a dance lasting perhaps for several
days. Indeed, the only feature about the marriage at all was the
coming to me of her husband a short while later to ask were it
permissible for him to change his name. It was a good name, he said,
hitherto quite suitable and serviceable. But now that he was married
it was different, he explained. It was not right that a man with a
native name should be married to a woman named Mary Brown--a
white-man name; when a wife had a white-man name, the husband should
have a white-man name, too. I told him that in European marriages it
was the fashion for the woman to change her name, not for the man to
change his, but that if he wished to invert this procedure I had no
objection whatever. Whereupon he thanked me extravagantly and went
thoughtfully away, and at the end of two days returned and informed
me that after much consideration he had determined that henceforth he
would answer to the name of 'Willie'. It did not occur to him that
such a 'pretty-pretty' name as this was ridiculously incongruous with
the grim significance of the name he had abandoned, which,
translated, was--Alligator.</p>

<p>Mary gave a deal of thought and attention to ensuring that I was
properly fed. She would have nothing of my habit of being satisfied
with something out of a tin. She believed in a variety of foods. 'You
all-time eat from tin three times one day,' she said once; 'that's
'leven times a week, about twenty times a year--my word! that make
your belly come angry feller and you come sick. Belly not like have
one-kind food all-time.' She sent her husband into the jungle in
search of wild-turkeys--which in places were plentiful, and were
comparatively easy of capture, being large birds which made
mound-nests the size of a house and stayed chiefly about them, and
were capable only of short low flight--and his captures she roasted
perfectly, basting them even, and stuffing them. She sent him to the
great mound-nests to hunt for eggs, and the most recent in the
collections he brought she fried or boiled for me, or made into
omelets, and the others gave to friends in the tribe--to the natives
any egg was an edible egg, whether ancient or modern. Each morning
she sent him along the beach with a spear in search of fish for my
breakfast, and whenever the tribe obtained one of the sea-turtles,
which at various places came ashore to nest, she was always at hand
to secure a piece of it for me. Mary Brown's turtle cutlets were the
finest cutlets possible, and her turtle-soup a soup to be regarded
very highly indeed.</p>

<p>Then, too, she kept me provided with fresh vegetables and fruits,
some of them wild, some of them grown on the plantation, but all of
them so served that they were always a delight; and she had me obtain
by the storeship things such as jelly-powders and cornflour and
castor-sugar and various spices, and all manner of odds and ends and
small luxuries, none of which it had ever occurred to me to have, and
the names of which Mary so mispronounced that I did not recognize
them till she gave illustrations of their uses or imitations of their
appearance. Her causing of tremors to run through her thin body in
order to show me what a jelly was like was a thing to be
remembered.</p>

<p>The captain of one of the vessels which brought my stores was very
much attracted by Mary Brown's abilities, and remarked to her that he
would like to have her at his Thursday Island home to assist his
wife. But Mary would have nothing of it. Indeed, she was indignant at
the suggestion that she should leave me, saying that if she went I
wouldn't look after myself, but eat only tin' foods and make my belly
come angry, and get plenty big sickness, and have plenty hard work
cleaning altogether pots all-time, and washing clothes, and sweeping
floors, and doing like that every day.</p>

<p>'S'pose he got missus, then he all right,' she said. 'But he not
got missus--only me.'</p>

<p>There was no doubt whatever of the strength of her affection for
me; nevertheless, I think her refusal of this offer was somewhat
influenced by the fact that acceptance would involve separation from
her tribe.</p>

<p>These natives were more affected by the presence of a white man,
even a solitary white man, than any I had known. In my wanderings in
wild New Guinea I found that the daily lives of the Papuans were
affected but little by the fact that a European lived in the village,
while in the Solomons it made scarcely any difference at all, in both
instances the strangers being regarded as a curiosity rather than as
an example. But with these North Australian aborigines it was as
though they realized they had been left far behind in the march of
events and were desirous of catching up, to which end they were at
all times prepared to abandon, for anything they thought better,
habits and beliefs which had come to them unchanged down the
centuries.</p>

<p>The having of a European name came to be regarded as one means of
catching up, and the example set by Mary Brown's husband was quickly
followed. But just any European name would not do. They desired names
with as few consonants as possible, for in their own tongue
consonants predominated, and they were reacting against their own
tongue. They desired names filled with vowels--'soft-one words, like
white-man talk,' was how Mary translated their need--and came to me
for suggestions, which suggestions they considered and discussed at
great length, with the result that the men became Olivers and
Charlies and Andies and Eugenes even, and the women Adas and Edies
and Ritas and Ivys; and so keen were they on memorizing the unusual
vowels, and accustoming themselves to them, that often a woman would
sit alone for long periods repeating them, and a man unnecessarily
hail a companion, the while expecting to be hailed in return.</p>

<p>They changed the manner of their huts, making them with walls on
all four sides, instead of on one side only, for they realized that
though the new style involved greater labour in building, there was
no subsequent turning around of the edifice in response to change of
direction in the weather. For the first time in their lives they were
using the present to make provision for the future. For the first
time in their lives they were realizing there was any such thing as
the future.</p>

<p>They saw, too, that some foods were more advantageously cooked in
pots than on the coals, for with their awaking sensibilities eating
became something more than mere satisfying of hunger. Their sense of
taste developed. A glimmering of aesthetics was theirs. Turtle boiled
was immensely superior to turtle flung on a fire, and provided a
delicious soup besides. Wild-duck stewed developed a flavour entirely
absent from duck ill-grilled with viscera intact, while jungle-fruit
when boiled afforded a sweet syrup whose existence till then had not
been suspected. In fact, so greatly did 'cooking in water' as they
termed it, appeal to them that they became prone to making tribal
feasts solely in order to exploit the delectableness of some
new-discovered dish; and no sooner did I empty a biscuit-tin or other
container than it was spirited away for transformation into a
saucepan of sorts.</p>

<p>But though they were quick to see advantages in these and other
usages, they failed completely to see any advantages in agriculture.
It was not that they were averse from the labour the growing of food
involved; it was mainly that they could see no need for growing it.
For, all through the jungle plant-food was to be had for the
taking--red apples and white apples, which were apple-like only in
shape and tasted like a blend of wonderful apricots and pears; fruits
called 'wangais', date-like, but subtler of flavour than dates from
Smyrna ever were; yams whose long thin vines trailed the ground as
though to attract a seeker's attention by tripping him; bananas whose
ripened fruit made gold of the jungle's green; arrowroot that bulged
the soil as though impatient of the dilatoriness of diggers; and many
other vegetables and fruits, all of them indigenous and needing
neither planting nor care, yet no two fruiting at once, but bearing
with a regularity of succession scarcely to be attained by even the
most scientific of cultivators.</p>

<p>In view of this spontaneous abundance, I think the natives held
privately that in taking such pains to make things grow where already
things grew of their own accord I was maybe a little mad. As for
myself, there were times when, viewing the slow process of the work,
it came to me with considerable force that perhaps in this private
opinion there was a deal of truth that, after all, simplicity of
outlook was saner than complex philosophies, that inasmuch as his
mode of thinking was perfectly direct, primeval man derived fuller
satisfaction from life than civilized man. The trouble was that my
civilized heredity had taken me too far along the road to allow me to
turn back without getting lost.</p>

<p>But though the natives possessed remarkable directness of thought,
they had but little directness of verbal expression, a circumstance
for which the limitations of their language were responsible. It was
a most inadequate language. Some concrete things could be expressed
in concrete terms, but there were many which could be expressed only
by similes, or by roundabout illustration, while for abstract things
they had no expression at all--this because in their great
backwardness they hadn't reached necessity for the abstract; in fact,
they didn't know there was any such thing. Further, the opposite of a
word, and sometimes even its corollary, was often a matter for great
redundancy. Thus, though they had a word for 'hot', a man's only
means of intimating that he felt cold was by describing heat and the
physical sensations caused by heat and then saying he did not feel
like that at all.</p>

<p>Their system of counting was also most inadequate--even to the
extent that they had no means of estimating their ages, or the tally
of the days which made up the cycle of the seasons, or the number of
the nights between one full moon and another, or how many people were
in the tribe, or how many dogs, the reason for all this being that
the only numbers they knew were the numbers of the fingers of the
hand, a limitation which imposed upon them the necessity for
designating an amount greater than five as 'a lot' or a 'great lot',
according to quantity, and often compelled me to the exercise of
considerable mental ingenuity in order to discover what the devil
they meant.</p>

<p>Their singing also suffered from limitations, it having four notes
only, and their octaves, and knowing nothing whatever of half-tones,
but only a play on those four full notes, the effect of which was to
give to the tunes such similarity that at first hearing all the tunes
seemed the same tune.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they had appreciations of wider ranges of musical
sounds. During the second year of my life at Cape York I had brought
me from Thursday Island a piano, which I installed in the large room
and in the evenings more or less played. It wasn't much of a piano,
being one I obtained for two pounds, this low cost being due to the
fact that it was old, outworn and, in addition to other defects, had
several notes which produced no sound at all and several which
produced sounds they had no business to produce. Also, I was an
exceedingly bad player, and more accustomed to playing with one hand
than with two.</p>

<p>But the natives thought delightful the noises I produced, and as I
played a number of them would come from the camp, walk softly,
reverently, along the verandah and crowd about the open doorway and
listen intently. A favourite piece of theirs was the 'Tell Me Pretty
Maiden' Sextet from Florodora, though what there was appealing about
a piece picked out mostly with one finger on notes that were mute and
notes which should have been, I don't know. They even attempted to
sing it, but the need to get that gay music within the compass of
their four notes only made of the attempt sounds worse even than my
'playing' of it. But they were not discouraged; instead, they would
ask me to play it over and over again and shyly yet eagerly come
right in as I did so, and stand behind me in silence to the end, and
then, with much approving nodding, declare it 'proper nice-one song',
and remark one to another to the effect that I was a remarkably
clever person, inasmuch as I could play on the black notes as well as
on the white.</p>

<p>But whatever the limitations of their camp-tunes, there were no
limitations to the subject-matter of their songs, for the range of
them began with accounts of heroic deeds performed by legendary
persons possessed of dorsal horns and superfluity of limbs, and of
still more heroic deeds performed by persons who had really lived,
and went on through a long list, recounting more or less recent
marriages and deaths of importance, and some of no importance at all,
and events of all kinds, more gay ones among them than grave ones,
and ended with a song which was not so much a song as a vehement
exulting in the repetitive declaration that they were glad, glad,
glad, glad.</p>

<p>And as though these subjects were not enough, they made songs of
happenings of the moment--and made them very successfully, they
having a surprising aptitude for charging with interest even the most
trifling incident. Some of this <i>vers d'occasion</i> concerned
quite definite events--the leaping of a fish, the crying of a child,
a shower of rain--and was possessed of a recurrent rhythm and now and
then a rhyme; and some concerned nothing in particular at all, but
merely rambled on through a series of unrelated events, amorphous of
design and empty of meaning, yet all the while giving forth a strange
and subtle beauty of its own.</p>

<p>This aptitude for making songs about anything and everything led
them sometimes to making songs about myself. As pieces of
versification, these songs were wholly bad. They lacked 'story' and
continuity of idea, had neither details nor elaboration, and were
confined to bald statement contained in a single sentence, which
sentence was repeated and repeated till the variations and
combinations of their four singing notes were exhausted. Yet,
listening, I was often most profoundly moved, for that single
sentence was always to the effect that I was an excellent fellow and
that they loved me.</p>

<p>'This white man is good and kind, and our hearts are glad he is
here,' is a rough translation of the sentence. A suspicion that they
sang it only because of a temporary scarcity of good song-subjects,
and a belief that they would have sung it about any other white man
who lived among them as I did, made no difference to my emotional
reaction. To be affectionately acclaimed in song by primeval savages
who carried their dead about with them and suckled pups as they
suckled children was a distinction of no mean order.</p>

<p>They had, too, a keen appreciation of the dramatic, and were given
to occasional--though very occasional--performance of plays. These
performances took place always at night, on a cleared space in the
centre of the camp, with the ground for a stage, and the audience
squatted in a circle about the actors and illuminating their doings
by means of small fires of a wood which made a bright-red
flaring.</p>

<p>Some of the plays were put forward purely as light entertainment,
being broadly humorous and concerned with events such as the foolish
efforts of a foolish man to escape a series of wholly incredible
misfortunes. Others were sharply pointed, and had a social
significance besides. There was one which exhibited the enormity of
consanguinity as a social and personal crime--in its representation
of the anguish of a woman at being forced to an unnatural intimacy,
this play had points of contact with Shelley's The Cenci. Another
denounced emphatically the seducing of married women, with the
seductive acts mimicked so circumstantially as to omit not even the
lewdest detail, and with the climax of the betrayed husband clubbing
the seducer to death, preceded by vivid representation of a dreadful
sterilizing punishment the said betrayed husband declared he would be
delighted to inflict if only he had his way.</p>

<p>Still other plays were ingenious blends of actuality and fantasy
tinged with symbolism. One I saw concerned a happening of some months
before on the plantation--the falling of a tree in so unexpected a
direction that its feller was crushed by a limb and almost killed.
They made quite a good play of that happening. They made of the tree
a thing of human significance. They translated its creaks, as the axe
bit home, into groans and cries of pain. They turned its tottering
into the trembling of a thing affrighted. And the roar of its
crashing fall became a roar of sudden anger; and its great side-slip,
and the veer in the direction of its descent, deliberate attempt at
revenge on the man who had slain it. The final scene showed the
crushed man's wives cutting their foreheads with shells, and wailing
loudly, and denouncing the axe as a monstrously evil thing, inasmuch
as without it their husband could never have attacked the tree and
brought this disaster upon them. The first time I saw this play I
thought it the work of propagandists who, disliking the heavy labour
of tree-felling, sought to foment a strike. But I discovered that
this was not so; while as for the moral of the play, no one took any
heed of it at all.</p>

<p>This play was constructed in the way all their plays were
constructed. At the suggestion one night of someone or other as they
sat about the camp-fires that the accident would make a play, a man
rose and depicted the anger of the tree; then another took the part
of the man with the axe, and others the part of the weeping
wives--the whole being filled with irrelevancies, and pointless
speeches, and back-to-front action, and general muddle. But with
repeated performance, order evolved from this chaos, and words,
gestures and grimaces attained their proper order and became fixed,
and always afterwards were performed in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>The plays were produced without 'properties', or any appurtenances
whatever, and the costumes varied from nothing at all to feathers and
flower-petals stuck about the body with tree-gum, and the 'make-up'
was coloured clay and white ashes, and ran to the making of great
circles about the eyes and mouth, and sometimes to the whitening of
individual ribs, so that in the red flaring of the fires the actor
had the appearance of a skeleton strangely and dreadfully
fleshed.</p>

<p>The actors were always men, usually young men, though now and then
there would appear among them an aged person whose bearing seemed to
indicate that he considered the stage had degenerated since his day,
and that it was his duty to show these young bloods what acting
really was.</p>

<p>There was one elderly person who scarcely ever witnessed a play
without leaving his position in the circle of the audience, striding
among the actors and duplicating one of the parts, speeches,
gestures, facial contortions and all. He was a little man, with thin,
claw-like hands and a nose immensely broad, and the manner of his
entry was that of one who could endure the badness of the acting no
longer. But his interference caused no interruption to the progress
of the play, for no one seemed to see anything ridiculous in the fact
that there were now two heroes, or two villains, as the case may be.
Instead, it was as though they considered that this doubling of the
part doubled the heroism--or villainy--of the character. I consider
that little old person with the broad nose a dramatic critic with
methods of commendable directness. He seemed to be fully grasped of
the truth that there was no more effective criticism than criticism
by example.</p>

<p>The plays, however, appeared to be performed more for the
satisfaction of the actors than for the satisfaction of the audience.
As a rule, the audience paid but little heed to the performance, some
sitting with their backs to the actors, some lying face-down on the
sand, asleep and snoring, some assiduously searching their dogs for
vermin, and the rest watching the doings of the actors mostly with
the casual disinterest with which they might have watched the doings
of children scampering about the beach. Indeed, they appeared to
regard the whole show as utterly boring, and to suggest that they
were present only out of politeness, and that they would have much
rather preferred a dance, or, failing a dance, an evening's
'yarning'--all of which was due, no doubt, to their having witnessed
the plays so often before.</p>

<p>'Yarning' was one of their principal occupations. From dark to
midnight it was their habit to sit about the camps in groups and talk
and talk and talk, the men telling one another loudly of the trees
they had felled and how they felled them, or of fish they had caught,
or of birds they had seen, the women whispering whatever scandal
there was to be whispered--most of which concerned adulteries
committed or threatening--the while their fingers worked dexterously
and automatically at the making of small grass bags in which they
kept and carried their few personal possessions--bags remarkable for
the evenness of their weaving and the regularity of their pattern,
for their enduring properties, and for a pliableness of such quality
that they could be rolled and folded like a piece of cloth.</p>

<p>Sometimes one of the men would come to the house at the end of the
day and spend an hour or two 'yarning' with me, talking on anything
and everything, on subjects mostly unrelated one to another, and
every now and then asking for a small piece of tobacco. There was
one--a young man--whose 'yarning' took the form of asking a multitude
of questions about myself and the life I lived before I came to Cape
York. Some of these questions were of a most intimate nature, being
chiefly questions relating to my amorous experiences, if any; and
some were concerned with discovering whether unmarried white girls
were as--er--accessible as unmarried black girls, and if not, why
not, and some with discovering whether it were true, as he had heard,
that among whites it was a case of one man one wife, no matter how
many women he may desire or how many women desired him, and with
discovering what happened when a man tired of his wife and wanted to
be rid of her, and also with discovering whether my coming to live at
Cape York was due to my having such a wife and running away as the
only means of being rid of her.</p>

<p>That young man was as interested in the civilized life as I was
interested in the Palaeolithic life. But I'm afraid the information I
gave him of the position of woman in civilization disappointed him,
for, as I spoke, he would from time to time shake his head and remark
to the effect that he wouldn't live in such a place for anything, the
restrictions being too numerous and extreme. He was a great believer
in Freedom, was that stone-age Lothario.</p>

<h3>THE JUNGLE'S REVENGE</h3>

<p>Meanwhile the making of the plantation progressed, slowly perhaps,
and with many interruptions and delays, but nevertheless with such
sureness as to give definite promise of actuality to the envisioning
which was mine when I cut my initials on the tree.</p>

<p>For, by the first year's ending half a hundred acres of
flourishing young coconuts stood where only jungle stood before, and
a similarly large area was cleared ready for planting when the
seed-coconuts in a nursery I had made were sufficiently grown; and
there were, besides, several extensive plots of sweet-potatoes and
yams and tapioca-plants and other vegetables, which I fed to the
labourers and so augmented my supplies of flour--the labourers'
principal diet. It was a promising plantation indeed, and looking at
it I was often pervaded by a feeling of utmost satisfaction, and
would tell myself that a planter's life was the life for me. The
immobility of the life disturbed me not at all, but seemed, rather,
to be what I had always craved. Indeed, at times I was given to
reproaching myself for having wasted so many years in idle
wanderings, and to denouncing the wanderlust as a demoralizing agent
of considerable tonnage. From an aimless roamer I had become a
Settled and Respectable Person, a man of property, with a vote in the
local council--had there been a local council; a Ratepayer--had there
been anyone to pay rates to; and altogether a self-satisfied young
man who hoped, trusted and believed that the aforementioned
wanderlust was well and truly dead.</p>

<p>And Authority confirmed my standing as a man of property and
position, for the Government Resident of Thursday Island appointed me
to a post which I can describe only as Honorary Distributor of Tribal
Blankets--that is to say, the Resident sent me a great bale of grey
blankets marked importantly with a Government stamp, and a letter
informing me that it was the custom of the Government annually to
present a blanket to each accessible aboriginal native of the
country, and that the nomadic habits and general wildness of the
people of my neighbourhood had hitherto made the presenting of the
gift a matter of great difficulty, and asking would I mind taking
upon myself the task of distribution.</p>

<p>I had the bale carried to the camp and there opened, and to the
natives one by one I presented a blanket, the while pointing to the
important-looking stamp and saying what fine fellers the Government
were to give them such good-one blankets with big-one marks on them,
and didn't ask them for pay or nothin', but gave them all as presents
because they proper good-one friend along the natives and think about
them kind-one all the time.</p>

<p>The tribe, however, were impressed neither by the gift nor by my
remarks, but took the blankets just as a matter of course, and that
night slept in them, and next day complained to me that the things
made their skins too prickly, and after that slept in them no more,
but used them instead of bark for roofing their huts.</p>

<p>Supplies of food and general stores were brought me by occasional
passing vessels--pearling-luggers, trepang-craft, and the like--and
the seed-coconuts and vegetable-cuttings came from New Guinea in a
chartered cutter manned by natives of that country. These cutter-men
were the first of their race some of my natives had seen; and my
natives were the first of their race some of the cutter-men had seen;
for though their respective lands were apart a two-days' sail or
less, the two peoples were given but little to exchanging visits.
Indeed, there were among my people some who were in the habit of
referring to New Guinea as to a somewhat legendary place inhabited by
monsters rather than by men, some of whom had tails and others feet
like birds. When I told them that this was not so, they doubted me
plainly; and when, in proof of my statement, I said I had lived and
wandered there for a very considerable time, they showed their teeth
in admiring smile and declared me more courageous than they had
thought--an ingenious, but ambiguous, statement which caused me to
wonder what their previous estimate of my courage had been.</p>

<p>Still, they were not at all astounded to discover that the New
Guinea men were human like themselves; they were interested only in
the facts that the skin of the strangers was brown, and that they had
great fuzzed-out masses of hair, and boars' tusks in their noses, and
tattooing on their foreheads; and after a few brief conversations
about the strangeness of these things, they put the subject from
their minds.</p>

<p>And the New Guinea men were just as matter-of-fact, being neither
supercilious nor self-satisfied towards my natives, as I had expected
they would be, seeing that they lived in well-built houses, made
food-gardens, kept chickens, and hunted with bows and arrows, while
my folk lived in crude huts, grew nothing and kept nothing, and
hunted with roughly fashioned spears. They just accepted them as they
themselves had been accepted; and the interesting display of
contrasting attitudes which I had expected would result from this
confronting of one savage race with another savage race failed
completely to eventuate.</p>

<p>With the beginning of the second year I found that while the
making of a plantation was one thing, the keeping of it made was
another thing. For all about the clearing a riot of vegetation sprang
up and savagely attacked my young and struggling palms--half-aerial
vines which drew their fronds together in twisting, strangling grips;
thick-foliaged bushes which crowded in on them, jostling them aside;
intertwined masses of broad-leaved plants which shut out from them
light and air; rank weeds which ate at their roots; strange things
with spiky tentacles which they put forth and wounded the palms, to
the bringing-out of drops of sap in the manner of drops of blood.
Even the stumps of the slain trees came mysteriously to life and
thrust up clusters of tall saplings, which in a night seemed taller
by several feet; and all about appeared plants which existed nowhere
save in the clearing--plants which the natives, with all their
knowledge of the bush, had never seen before.</p>

<p>These strange plants interested the natives immensely; at every
opportunity they would study them in detail--examining the shape of
their leaves and the texture of them, gaining knowledge of the length
of their feeding-roots and the roots which afforded the plants
mechanical support, the while speculating on their edible qualities,
and, whenever there were berries or fruit, making cautious and
tentative experiment. And at night, squatted by the camp-fires, they
would talk much about them, and maybe speak of their having found
during a wandering to other parts plants which had points of
resemblance to these, and the Old Men would give names to the
strangers, names more or less suggestive of their general appearance
or some outstanding characteristic, names by which they were to be
known by the generations to come.</p>

<p>There was one species of these new plants which the labourers were
much averse from cutting down--tall, thick shrubs, they were, with
green and yellow variegation of leaf somewhat in the manner of a
croton--so much averse indeed that at times they would refuse to cut
them at all, and it would be only with great difficulty that at
length I persuaded them.</p>

<p>It was a bad-luck plant, that one, was the burden of what they
said when I asked the reason of this aversion. The wife of the man
who cut one down would, like as not, bear him always girl-children.
One of the Old Men had told them so. No man wanted a family of girls.
To have a family of girls would be bad luck indeed. Sons were all
right--they grew into warriors and hunters and dancers. But girls?
they couldn't do anything. Anyway, there was quite enough girls in
the tribe already, more girls than men. If I didn't believe the story
about the power of the strange plant, I could ask the Old Man for
myself.</p>

<p>The Old Man told me all about it willingly enough. He was a very
old Old Man, and incredibly thin besides, and so feeble that he
scarcely walked at all, but sat crouched within his hut, now and then
sucking at the ruins of a day pipe someone had given him, and staring
always at the small embers of a small fire at his feet. Through
another native--for he had no English whatever--he told me he had
seen that plant with the green and yellow leaves when he was a boy;
at some place far down-coast, it was, but where exactly he had
forgotten, so long ago was it. He had remembered the plant all
through that long, long time; it was the fashion of the natives, he
said, to remember a plant; and he remembered that one of the Old Men
of those days had said that the wife of him who cut that plant would
never bear a son. He had forgotten many things since then--places and
names and events--ah! many things, for he was very, very old, and
when a man grew old as he was, forgetfulness was easy. But never had
he forgotten about that plant, for before he was told of its strange
power, he had cut one of them down, and when at length he grew up and
married there were born to him only girls.</p>

<p>The reason for this riot of vegetation was that the surface of the
ground had recovered from the severe baking it had suffered by the
burning of the felled trees and thick undergrowth, and the heavy
rains had driven in the deep coating of ashes--thus fertilizing the
soil as never it had been fertilized before--and the everlasting heat
of the sun, steaming it, had made of it all a forcing-bed.</p>

<p>That was the reason, simple and easy of understanding. Yet,
somehow, at times it seemed to me as though the jungle had resented
my slaying and ignominious burning of its great trees, and was
determined to slay my young palms in revenge. The attack seemed so
deliberate and insistent and vicious. Those plants which the natives
had never seen before were as specially created forces of assault. I
felt that the jungle was behind it all; and I came to hating the
jungle as I might have hated a thing of flesh and blood. I felt that
it had set out to defeat me, to ruin me, to drive me away. I would
look at the tall wall of it edging the clearing, and see it as a grim
parent gazing approvingly down on its offspring's attacking of my
palms. I would see it as a menace, a creeping, slimy menace,
stealthily advancing on my clearing. I would see it as the van of a
tall army about to sweep forward in one great conquering rush. And at
night in my sleep I would see it as all these things again; and worse
things--the end of the attacking and the menace: I would see my poor
palms all choked and dead, and my clearing so utterly gone that there
was not even a break in the tangle of the sell-avenged jungle to show
where once it had been.</p>

<p>The repulsing of this attack became the most pressing need of the
day. It was no easy task. Such was the fructivity of the soil that
almost as soon as they were cut away, the entangling vines and
choking bushes thrust up as vigorously as before. By the time the end
of clearing an area was reached, it was time to commence again at its
beginning. Sometimes at the end of a full day's work there would be
scarcely any sign of where the workers had been. Never were there
growths of such persistence. And all the while the summer rains came
drenching down--rains which were as one wide screen of grey water,
and struck the earth with such force as to bounce to the height of a
man's knees, and made such a crashing uproar on the galvanized-iron
roof of any house as to make the hearing of speech impossible. And
the rain blinded the labourers as they worked, and so flattened the
attacking growths to the ground that the cutting of them was a matter
of greatest difficulty; and many of the young palms were washed from
the slight hold of the ground and swept away by torrential streams
which were none the less torrential because they had been made in a
minute. The salvaging and replanting of those part-drowned palms was
another pressing need.</p>

<p>And then, just when victory against the encroaching growths was in
hand, the nomadic instinct of the natives awoke, and one midday they
came to me at the house, asked for the store-goods due to them as
pay, and announced their intention of going away. They had been here
a long time, they said, longer than any of them could remember
staying in one place before, and now they were tired of it and wanted
some other of their haunts awhile.</p>

<p>'Must go for walk-about,' one explained shortly when, aghast, I
offered remonstrance.</p>

<p>'Must have spell from hard work too much,' grunted another.</p>

<p>I stormed at them, and threatened, saying that if they went, I
would never employ them again, that I would bring labourers from some
other part of the coast. They made no answer, but stood staring
sullenly, one or two muttering, and some so fingering their spears
that I thought it best to let them see I had my revolver in my
pocket.</p>

<p>Then I spoke to them softly, and, pointing to the plantation,
begged that they should not leave me just as the fruit of our recent
hard labourings was in sight; and asked had I not been a good master
to them, giving them in plenty of the good things in my store; and
drew their attention to the fact that if they went away they would
have none of these good things, and would miss them very much.</p>

<p>And still they stood there, a sullen, silent crowd, the women by
gestures hushing their children, the men scowling up at me, the dogs
sniffing in and about the array of thin, black legs.</p>

<p>Then I turned to Mary Brown, who had come from the kitchen and
stood behind me at the head of the verandah steps. I told her to
point out to them in her own language and in her own way the folly of
their leaving me, to use all the arguments she knew to induce them to
stay, to do her best for me, as often she had done her best for me
before. Then I stood back and made room for her to speak to the
sullen, silent crowd on the ground.</p>

<p>But Mary, who had never failed me before, failed me now. She made
no speech to those on the ground, but looked at me earnestly awhile,
and hesitatingly and stumblingly said that they would have to go--and
that she would have to go with them.</p>

<p>It was the fashion for natives to go for 'walk-about', she said,
in the manner of one who excuses, but does not intend to allow the
excuse to interfere with a fixed determination. Always had they been
like that. Always, she repeated. With white men it was different.
White men could stay long times in one place. But with natives, their
eyes came tired of looking always at the same things. And their feet
came tired walking always on the same ground. And their bodies came
tired from sleeping always in the same camp. They wanted to look at
other places, walk on other ground. They would have to go. Yes. They
would go to a place three days' walk down the coast. And she would go
with them, because she was one of them, and felt the same as they
did--though her heart was sore that she should leave me, and the
heart of Willie, her husband, was sore, too, and she would like to
stay, only...only...</p>

<p>'But I will come back,' she ended. 'I will come back in three
months--two months--and make all them others come back then,
too...Please, please, Master...you keep this job for me...</p>

<p>And with that she seized my hand and pressed it to her, as a
mother might press to her the hand of her child, and hurried away,
her head averted to hide the swimming fullness of her eyes.</p>

<p>I paid them their wages, and at sundown they left for that other
haunt, whose call would not be denied, the whole of them, going as
they had come--in straggling procession along the beach, the men with
their spears and clubs, the women with their poor possessions bundled
on their heads, the part-starved dogs trailing dejectedly. But now,
with the sinking of the sun, the sea was a shield of red and gold and
flitting lights, and the figures on the beach stood softly clear
against it, like shadows cast by a mellowed glow, with the gleaming
of the sea showing between the swinging of their arms, and their
heads black flat ovals cut in a sheet of gold. Then, on their winding
down into a dip of the beach, the red of the sea lay on them fairly,
and made of them things of mobile bronze; and the head-bundles became
as red baskets of red fruits, and a cloth waved in farewell by Mary
Brown a small dull flame.</p>

<p>I watched them out of sight, and, till the sinking of the sun was
done, stared at the empty beach. Then I looked at the deserted camp
and the wavering smoke of one of its dying fires, and at the
plantation and the jungle's tall, grim wall, and at a rain-squall
sweeping up with a great rustling of leaves, and around my quiet and
lonely house; and I wondered if, after all, there was anything so
tremendously satisfying in being a Settled and Respectable
Person.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6"></a>Chapter Six</h2>

<h3>IN THE ABSENCE OF HUMANS</h3>

<p>It took three and a half months to sate the natives of their other
haunt and bring them back gladly to labouring and consequent enjoying
of white men's foods and goods; and for the whole of that time I was
completely alone--save only for the companionship of Togo, my
dog--seeing not one human being and having no communication
whatsoever with the outside world.</p>

<p>I set out upon that period with a great fear in me. I guessed I
would see no man, for I had obtained my quarterly supply of stores
only a little while before, and there was no reason why another
vessel should call. I was afraid of that great loneliness. I saw it
as a long, long line of succeeding sameness, broken nowhere by
anything new or strange. I recalled that it was a well-observed fact
that without the new and the strange the minds of men died. I
recalled the parallel fact that Man was essentially gregarious.
Solitude made men mad. In my far roamings I had seen cases of it, and
heard of many others--of men whom need for companionship had driven
to holding long and involved dialogue with themselves, with their
dogs, with the stumps of trees; of men who, conversely, had lost
almost entirely power of speech; of men who fled from approach of
other men, as from something fearsome; of men who mingled actuality
with queer imaginings and knew not how to separate them, or even that
there was need to separate them. The fear in me that I might become
as they was so strong that the first few nights I could scarcely
sleep for thoughts of it, and often during the day I sought to catch
myself in the act of soliloquy.</p>

<p>Maybe the surroundings of those other isolated men were peculiarly
empty of interesting things. Maybe these surroundings of mine were
peculiarly full. Maybe my gregarious instinct was only partially
developed. I don't know. All I know is that I found there was no
long, long line of succeeding sameness at all. I found that all about
me were things so engaging of my attention as to compensate very
considerably for lack of human association. As during those weeks I
was alone on Turtlehead Island I discovered that everywhere was
engaging variety, so did I discover that everywhere here was engaging
variety also. My solitude was filled with tragedies and comedies and
dramas, with wise deeds and foolish ones, with beauties and
ugliness--just as the haunts of men were filled with them. It was a
crowded solitude.</p>

<p>There was, for instance, the engrossing behaviour of the birds.
There was one group inhabiting a tree close to the house, which I
christened 'The School Kids'. A dozen or more there were of them,
little grey creatures, smooth of feather and a little shiny; and soon
after dawn each day they would come forth and perch in a row on a
conveniently horizontal limb--the largest at one end, the next
largest at the other, and the rest graded according to size--and make
such an uproar of quarrelling as to awaken me and send me forth to
look; and at my presence, as though in deference to it, they would at
once come silent, each looking straight before it and never moving.
But after a while one of the little ones would begin to fidget,
moving from one leg to the other, or maybe turn and face the other
way; whereupon the large one at the end would mutter disapprovingly,
and the next largest at the other end vent a shrill rebuke--to both
of which the rebellious one would chirp back cheekily. Then others in
the row would begin to fidget and turn the other way and preen their
small wings and whisper noisily to one another; and the head
teacher's muttering would become an angry shouting, and the
lady-assistant's shrill rebuking rise to a loud thin screech; and
soon the whole class would be in a frenzy of screaming revolt, with
much changing places and fluttering of wings and cries of
indignation, and perhaps a giggle or two. Then, after the using by
the teachers of a multitude of harsh, commanding words, the disorder
would die down, and the class return to its quiet and decorous
demeanour--till such time as another young imp disturbed it all by
fidgeting.</p>

<p>There were birds to whom life seemed mostly one long
joke--laughing-jackasses--in other parts of Australia drab things of
grey and white, but here gay riots of twinkling hues--which came with
the rising of the sun, singly, in pairs, in scores, in any old number
at all, flying from out the jungle with a great free flapping of
wings and throwing laughter as they flew--laughter wholly
uncontrollable, cackling laughter, giggling, chuckling, schoolgirl
laughter, all the different kinds of laughter, obese Bacchanalian
laughter, laughter that made great high crescendos, obscene laughter,
choking, hissing, bursting laughter, laughter that set me laughing
also, laughter that greets a smoke-room story, guttural, gurgling
haw! haw! laughter--filling all the sky with it, flinging it out
across the sea, making the dour jungle echo it, flooding all the
world with ribaldry.</p>

<p>They had their quarrels, though, did those gay laughers. One
morning I saw one of them, hunting alone, catch with its beak a small
green snake and, laughing uproariously, carry it high up a tree, from
where, according to custom, he repeatedly dropped it and caught it
again before it reached the ground. Presently some of his fellows
came and joined in the game, taking it in turns to drop and catch the
snake, and enjoying themselves thoroughly the while. Then one made
off with the snake, instead of returning it to the tree top. The
others for a moment were silent, as with astonishment; then came from
them an outburst of indignation, and they went after the thief and,
cornering him, denounced him--harshly, threateningly, accusingly,
telling him he was a traitor to his tribe, one who could not be
trusted, that he was no sport--and then, suddenly, one of the crowd
boldly snatched away the snake and, with the others in pursuit, fled
as the first thief had fled. And for the rest of the day the silence
of the bush was so repeatedly fractured in a different place each
time, by an outbreak of that harsh and threatening denunciation that
it seemed to me as though every one of these feathered reprobates had
a turn at embezzling the snake, and that the matter remained
unsettled so long as the reptile withstood the strain.</p>

<p>There were birds which neither quarrelled not laughed, indeed made
scarcely any sound at all, but seemed content with a quiet revealing
of a beauty and a daintiness and a grace which was theirs. Among them
was a kind so small that I could have concealed one completely within
my hand; yet their colours were expansive, complete, ranging from
subtle greens and subtler blues to the red of oranges and to blacks
with hints of fire in them, with all in between half tones and shades
of half-tones and shades of those again, and the whole so perfectly
blended and matched that never was there a touch of conflict or
harshness. And, as though they knew their beauty showed not to the
full in the shade, they flew mostly in the sun; and the twinkling of
their wings was in sweet rhythm to the twinkling of their hues; and
when they rested among the flowering shrubs of my hedge, as often
they did, they looked like flowers themselves. I called them the
Birds of the Sun.</p>

<p>Another decorative bird was one called the Rifle Bird (Ptiloris
Magnifica Alberti), a true Bird of Paradise, and one of the very few
known to have a habitat outside New Guinea. In the vicinity of the
plantation there were not many of them, but most of what there were
lived in trees near the house; and early of a morning they would call
one to another with a soft and rounded whistling; and presently one
or two would come forth and perch so that the sun shone full upon
them and gave life and sparkle to the great blue spread of their
breasts--a blue like blue of an old church-window, but brighter--and
touched with flitting red the collars of gold about their necks, and
lent to the blackness of their bodies a sheen as of new coal. And
there they would stay, an hour, or more perhaps, admiring themselves
and one another, turning this way and that so that the light would be
upon them at varying angles, holding themselves vainly, giving to
each movement a deliberate grace. And I, entranced would watch them
all the while, but always from between the canes of my verandah's
lattice, for despite their vanity they were keenly shy of man.</p>

<p>There was a bird which defied all precedent and cast tradition to
the dogs; a cuckoo it was--a true cuckoo (Centrophus Phasianus),
though large as a barnyard fowl--and its revolt against things as
they were was contained in the fact that, instead of, in the manner
of its kind, depositing its eggs in some other bird's nest for
hatching, it built a nest of its own and did all its hatching itself.
It was the most independent bird of my acquaintance.</p>

<p>There were certain little friendly birds, cheery, cheeky, cadging
birds, which took possession of a clear space of ground before the
house, and became so used to my giving them scraps of food whenever I
appeared they would flutter about me expectantly, and whenever I was
absent go up the steps, along the verandah, into the kitchen and
steal. I came to know those birds so intimately that I gave them
individual names; and they so came to regard the space before the
house as their own that if a strange bird appeared among them, he was
immediately driven away.</p>

<p>And there were flocks of birds which came from distant lands--from
Java, from Japan, from islands away to the eastward--for this was a
great resting-place for birds in migratory flight; strange birds they
were, some of them; birds evidently ill at ease in these, to them,
foreign surroundings, and not a little afraid; birds that scarcely
knew where to search for their own particular food; and birds that,
because of previous flights, knew the place so well that they stayed
here quite a while.</p>

<p>Once I saw two of these stranger-birds come in from across the
sea--a queer pair, for one was of one species, and one of another,
one being grey of feather and thick of bill, and the other blue and
brown of feather and long of bill; and for a time I wondered why two
such probable enemies should fly in company. Then it came to me that,
stragglers from their respective flocks, they had met in their
solitary flight, and determined to sink their antipathies in the need
to protect themselves and one another till they came to land once
more. Their arrival was the end of an epic of sorts, of dangers
endured and survived; and when they dropped exhausted in the grass
above the beach, I watched to see what would happen. And the only
thing that happened was when they were rested a bit, first one rose,
and then the other, and as casually as may be, went off in different
ways in search of their long-lost flocks. A common danger had made of
these two enemies friends; and now that the danger was passed their
intimacy was done.</p>

<p>But while I derived great interest from romantic imaginings such
as these, there was always before me the plantation and the jungle's
attacking growths. Those growths were a hard actuality, though by now
the rains were nearly done and the attack was considerably less
insistent and vicious. Sometimes I took a tool and slashed at the
growths myself; but one man could do nothing against such a multitude
of hostile vegetations. I consoled myself with the thought that the
natives when they returned would be fresh from their long resting and
be able to give the task of clearing the palms a vigour they had not
given it before.</p>

<p>At times, too, there came to me a desire to see a human being--not
an overwhelming desire; more a liking than a desire, but sufficiently
strong to make me think of various populous places in which I had
been, of men in thousands, and tens of thousands, of the crowds I had
passed in streets, sat with in trains, in buses, in tramcars, and to
whom I had never addressed a word. Here I would have talked for hours
to any one of them. It seemed to me that in my time I had wasted a
distressing number of opportunities of companionship.</p>

<p>As for Togo, my dog, he was very distinctly lonely. He didn't find
interest all about him, as I did; the new and strange in his
surroundings he had exhausted long before. He seemed to long for the
company of other dogs--even the natives' dogs, which, though he
treated them more or less disdainfully, were at least companions of a
sort, with whom if need be he could have quarrelled or fought. Now,
all he could do was growl at the little friendly birds, with a great
display of ferocity, drive them away, after which he would come to me
with on his face an expression which seemed clearly to ask what the
deuce had happened to the world that a dog of his breeding and
attainments was reduced to the frightening of small and harmless
birds. I had never seen a dog so bored as he was.</p>

<p>I wrote much in my diary during that period of solitude, and also
read a great deal--I had a plentiful supply of books--always for many
hours at night, and often for most of a day. But my primary interest
was the interest in the things outdoors. A book was, after all,
merely a record of life, and often much of the record was blatantly
untrue; outdoors was life itself, and all of it was vividly true.</p>

<p>Even the insects had engaging aspects. In the dry sand of the
upper part of the beach, between the high-tide mark and where the
vegetation began, was a kind of earth-fly which lived precariously by
trapping ants. The trap was a hole shaped in the manner of a
wide-mouthed funnel, six or more inches across the top and only half
as deep, and at first seeming was merely an accidental depression in
the sand. But when it was entered by an ant, the fly, from a place of
concealment at the bottom, threw up immediately a puff of sand in
such a manner that it fell on the ant directly from above; then it
sent up other and other puffs, and flurries of puffs, and columns
that went up and descended like fountains; and with all this sand
falling on him the ant would be forced down and down the slope of the
hole, swept off his feet, sent rolling, tumbling, staggering,
battered and weak and entirely helpless to where the ingenious
engineer of the contrivance awaited him. But that subterranean fly
must have often gone hungry, for though the trap lay directly in the
midst of thick ant-traffic, only rarely did one enter it. Perhaps a
word of warning had gone round among the ants.</p>

<p>In a clear space near the back of the house lived a ground-spider
whose home was a tube-like hole fitted with a door on a hinge--the
door being composed of grass cut into diamond shaped fragments and
bound with a intricacy of silver web. He was a little, grey person,
that spider, with small eyes wrinkled like those of a querulous old
man; and often did I watch him come home from his hunting of
leaf-insects and the like, lift the door and close it after him,
exactly as a man lifts and closes the door of a cellar. And as often
I would tap the door with a tiny stick, get back out of sight and
watch; whereupon the door would open a bit and the little grey person
put out his head, turn his wrinkled eyes in all directions as though
wonderingly, and then, apparently concluding he had been mistaken
about hearing a knock, go down indoors again. After which I would
give a further knock; and this time the little grey person would come
right out and make an exhaustive investigation of the neighbourhood,
going even to the grass edging of his cleared space and looking
behind the tufts, moving quickly, jerkily, like a man exasperated and
exceedingly annoyed, the while seeming vehemently to exclaim: 'Drat
those boys!' and when at last he returned to his home it was as
though he had determined not to be fooled again, for no amount of
knocking would bring him forth once more.</p>

<p>There was a lizard with whom I became quite intimate, even to the
extent of naming him George. He was a grey-brown slip of a thing,
four or less inches in length, delicately graceful of body and
movement both; and each morning, as I breakfasted on the verandah, he
would climb the leg of the table and perch at the edge of the cloth,
his head high and arched and his tongue showing from between his lips
like a triangle of thin pink paper; and there he would remain without
stirring--taking no heed of the various noises and movements I
made--till the meal was done and I had pushed back my chair. Then he
would immediately set to work cleaning up the crumbs, with almost
incredible swiftness darting over the plates and between them,
circling the saucer and the cup, making diagonal traverses of the
table's whole width, flashing this way and that, his slim body
twisting and curving and doubling, and the pink triangle of his
tongue a skeltering spot of colour--and never once pausing a moment,
but taking the food in his stride. George's exhibition of nimbleness
put me always in good humour for the day, and when at last some
accident befell him and he came again no more, I missed him as I
would have missed any highly entertaining friend.</p>

<p>I became intimate with the habits and manners of many such
creatures as these--creatures which hitherto I had scarcely thought
of possessing habits and manners at all. They became to me companions
almost as satisfying as any humans could have been. It was not that I
was interested only in the spectacular and peculiar; others of these
companions of mine led lives as dull and drab as the lives of men can
be dull and drab--small animals which went about their daily
food-hunting quietly and without display; birds which sat
unobtrusively among the trees and picked humbly at whatever fruits
and berries they could find; insects which performed their
commonplace tasks in a commonplace kind of way. Nor was it of any
great importance to me that it was only by the exercise of the
imagination that the doings of the others were as doings of
humans--that the little ground-spider was not really annoyed, that
'The School Kids' were not really at school as they sat in a row on
their limb. It was merely that I was viewing Life in another--and
maybe truer--perspective, understanding and sympathizing where
hitherto I had not thought there was need to understand and
sympathize at all. If only I could have attained the perspective in
which the birds and insects and things saw Man, my vision of Things
As They Are would have been complete.</p>

<p>But there were creatures with which I had no sympathy at
all--snakes. At any time snakes were sufficiently numerous to make
journeying through the bush a matter for carrying a stout and springy
stick and keeping a wary eye. They were of all kinds and lengths.
There were carpet-snakes--so called because of their skin being
regularly patterned--a dozen or more feet long and as thick as the
leg of a man, which held no poison in their fangs, but bit as a dog
might bite, and as severely, and destroyed their prey by constricting
it, afterwards sliming it with saliva and swallowing it whole; in the
interior of one I once shot I found the complete body of a kangaroo
as large almost as a man. There were brown snakes, also of
considerable length, whose bite could have fatal results within four
hours; beautiful and glossy they were, and more noiseless of movement
than any reptile in my experience. There were black snakes, slim and
of the evenness of a piece of rope, some of them having a length of
eight or nine feet, but most of them very much shorter; and
tiger-snakes, striped black on a red-brown background; and yellow
snakes splotched with black; and several others of many colours and
patterns, lengths and thicknesses, and all of them exceedingly
venomous.</p>

<p>But though snakes were so numerous, in all the years I was there
cases of people being bitten were extremely rare, the reason for this
being that the snakes were timid things, which, despite their
venomousness, avoided so far as they could all contact with man.
'Plenty snake look you and me when we walk about, but they run 'way
quick feller like hell,' a native explained to me once. ''Cause man
all-time fight them, they damn bloody fright' longa man. 'S'pose
plenty man live this place, then no more snake.' He said this,
incidentally, in the tone of one who considered that the
disappearance of the snakes would be something he would not care to
see happen, for to the tribe snake was an article of diet, and the
disappearance of an article of diet was distinctly a serious
misfortune.</p>

<p>As evidence of this timidity, the snakes when the natives were
about kept so almost entirely to the bush that the finding of one in
the neighbourhood of the camp or the house was a matter which called
from the people cries of astonishment mingled with expressions of
belief that some evil-minded spirit had sent it. Now, with the camp
deserted, I saw them often about the huts, and their tracks in the
sand were numerous. Also, for the reason that there was now but one
man present, and no comings and goings of many men, they came
frequently to the cleared space about the house--came boldly,
insolently, scarcely stirring out of my way when I went forth. In the
third month of my solitude I shot eleven of them. But this did not
deter them greatly. Indeed, some of them became bolder, coming right
up to the front of the verandah and basking casually as though
contemptuous of my gun. I began to think that snakes were not so
timid after all. One night one entered the house itself.</p>

<p>That snake provided me with one of the most dreadful experiences
of my life, and with certainly the most outstanding event in my
period of solitude. It was a little after midnight when it came--a
dark night, it was, so close and hot that for an hour or more I had
lain restlessly on my bed in the little room, naked save for a
Malayan sarong, and so still was it that the lapping of the tide on
the beach made a clear and round tinkling, and the breathing of Togo,
my dog, as he lay asleep on the floor in the other, and larger room,
was a sad sighing, and all other sounds came to me isolated one from
another and distinct. Suddenly I heard a slight rustling on the
Papuan mats on the floor of the other room. I threw up the
mosquito-net, rose, took my gun, lit the gas and stepped to the open
doorway, guessing the while what had caused the rustling.</p>

<p>I had only a glimpse of the other room, for the gasometer was
empty, and there was only a breath of gas in the pipes, but the
flicker of light was sufficient to show me, in the middle of the
floor, making straight for the sleeping dog, a carpet-snake a full
two fathoms long. I shouted, and Togo awoke at once into barking and
snapping and snarling activity and much rushing hither and thither;
then the gas gave its final flicker and went out, but not before I
saw the snake make for the wall and up towards the roof. Evidently it
considered that while a dog asleep was one thing, a dog very much
awake and filled with active antagonism was another thing
altogether.</p>

<p>I made a bonfire of matches on the table which occupied the centre
of the room. To have recharged the gasometer would have taken such a
time that the snake would probably have disappeared before I
finished. The bonfire of matches discovered for me the snake lying
along the ridge-pole of the house; and when with a spear that hung on
the wall I had poked it till its head was in such a position as to
allow me to get at it, I shot it--both barrels of a 12-bore shotgun.
And with that the snake's great long length came down and down, till
it hung straight over the table and the flaring of the matches like a
mighty rope. And then it stopped. Despite that its head was shot
almost completely away, it was still filled with life and vigour, and
with the end of its tail had taken a good, strong grip of the
ridge-pole.</p>

<p>Togo sprang up on the table and sunk his teeth in it. I beat at it
with the gun. I jabbed the spear into it. I was more than a little
unstrung. Those long weeks of solitude had affected my nerves. That
horrible, slightly swaying rope was something from a place of slimy
demons. In the now flickering light its diamond patternings shone
like dreadful eyes; when a match exploded they gave quick and vicious
gleamings. I could have screamed. I think I did scream. Blood from
its shot head dripped on to the bonfire, spluttering. Snake's blood!
Frenzied, I beat at its thick, long length; then I dropped both gun
and spear and grasped it with my hands and pulled.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the thing released its grip of the ridge and came
tumbling down in a mighty monstrous mass that blotted out the bonfire
and splashed my face with blood; and the next moment I was hanging on
to the doorpost as never I had hung on to anything before, for in
falling, the Thing had taken around my arm a full round turn,
covering it from elbow to shoulder, and with its tail got a grip of
the further side of the table in order to give it 'purchase'--and was
constricting with all its strength. I know I screamed now. I remember
screaming, distinctly. The great coil about my arm was hard as iron,
and as cold. It was a little slimy. I felt the muscles tauten against
mine. The power was terrific. My arm was paralysed. My reason was
paralysed. I tried to bite that awful coil. It was like biting steel.
With my bare foot I tried to kick at where it stretched to the table.
I tried to wrench my arm sidewise and free. I knew these efforts were
futile. Still, I tried them. And all the while that cold, hard grip
became harder, and seemingly colder. The pain must have been very
great; but I was not aware of it. Mental shock had rendered physical
shock subservient.</p>

<p>The Thing's half-head hung down from my arm a little way. The
blood from it dripped on my foot. My sarong came off, fell on my foot
and caught the blood instead. I was thankful for that. Togo was
snapping at the head, now and then gripping it and pulling. Sometimes
he brushed my naked leg; and the warmth of his body was gratifying
after the coldness of the coil about my arm. I shouted words of
encouragement and praise to him, though why I should have shouted
them I did not know, for, willing though he was, he could do
nothing.</p>

<p>Then, when it seemed to me I had clung to the door-post for
hours--though it was really only a few moments, as I saw afterwards
by my watch--and when my arm was near the breaking, the coil began to
slacken. With the pull of the snake upon it, the table was turning
over. The snake was losing its 'purchase'. A moment later the table
crashed over, the coil slackened completely, dropped heavily on to
the floor, and my arm was free. I sprang into my bedroom, found some
matches and struck one. The Thing was making slowly out of the main
doorway, on to the verandah, Togo still hanging at its head. By the
time it had reached the ground, where I could see it more or less
plainly in the dear darkness, I was ready and waiting for it, and
with charges of buckshot blew it to pieces. Then I recharged the
gasometer, and lay in the brightness of the light till daylight,
trembling as from fever or from cold, afraid to shut my eyes for fear
I should see again that monstrous gleaming rope. And for many nights
afterwards I lay fitfully awake because of thoughts of it, while as
for Togo, I am sure he knew full well that he himself had been the
object of the snake's intrusion of the house, for often he would
awaken with a short and sudden yelp and spring up bristling, exactly
as though he, too, had imagined a quiet rustling on the Papuan mats
of the floor.</p>

<p>That experience disrupted my interest in the life about me. I felt
I was a fool to live here like this. My crowded solitude was too
crowded altogether. I came to hating it, and so to ache for the
presence of humans that for hours at a time I would sit on the beach
and stare far down-coast at occasional smokes from the natives' fires
and try to persuade myself they were a little nearer than when I saw
them last; and whenever the sail of a vessel showed on the shining
field of the sea, I would speculate eagerly as to whether it were
coming my way. But the smokes stayed always so distant that they were
as hints of cloud, and the sails passed steadily on; and I would
think again of the men with whom I had sat dumbly in trains and buses
and trams, and call myself a fool once more.</p>

<p>And then, early in the fourth month, I had an experience which
made on me an impression almost as enduring as the episode of the
snake, and rather eerie perhaps--an experience which finally
determined me never again to live in an extended time far from haunts
of men. It came about through an attack of my old enemy, New Guinea
fever--an attack which for days I fought with quinine and other
febrifuges, but at last so overcame me as to compel me to take to
bed.</p>

<p>It was morning when I thus gave in, and hour after hour I lay
there, with the fever mounting and mounting and setting fire to my
blood, and the quinine giving to my head a mighty throbbing ache, and
at sundown came a merciful coma; and when I came out of it the grey
of dawn was in the room, and, despite that I was feeble as a
month-old child, the fever was utterly gone, and, though I was more
than a little awed by the thought that for twelve full hours I had
lain there in my solitude as a dead man might have lain there, I was
exceedingly thankful for this safe ending of a rather distressing
experience.</p>

<p>But there was more to it than that. Some weeks later, the captain
of the quarterly store-ship, sitting with me on the verandah, made
passing reference to the day of the week as being Thursday. I
corrected him--it was Wednesday, I said; and on his repeating it was
Thursday and declaring I must have made a mistake, I brought out my
diary and showed him each day and the events of each day carefully
entered. That diary was my only means of keeping positive record of
the passing of the days, and I was proud of the meticulousness with
which I kept it entered up. I almost felt slighted that this man
should doubt it. I could have sworn he was wrong.</p>

<p>But he persisted, and in proof that he was right brought forth
documentary evidence the truth of which there was no denying, and as
further proof called up members of his crew and bade them tell me the
name of the day of the week; and at last I knew there was no doubt
about my diary being wrong. It was Thursday. From my carefully kept
record a day was missing. But how that omission had come about I did
not guess till some time later, when I realized that instead of
awakening from the coma in the dawn of the day following the evening
I became unconscious, <i>it was in the dawn of the day after
that</i>. Instead of lying there like a dead man for twelve hours, I
had lain there thirty-six. I had lost a day out of my life, and but
for the diary would have never known it. There's something very
creepy in being in such circumstances that one could lose a day from
one's life and never know it.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7"></a>Chapter Seven</h2>

<h3>A FATHER BY PURCHASE</h3>

<p>The natives returned on a day in which there was never a hint of
the sun or splash of dear blue sky, but only succeeding skelters of
nimbus clouds and squalls of thin hard rain, and bursts of vicious
wind which scurried the sand of the beach and kicked the sheen from
the sea and trampled it the hue of lead--an unhappy, angry kind of
day.</p>

<p>But I was happy as ever I had been in my life, for I was once more
among my kind, withal the most primeval of my kind, revelling in
their crowding presence about the house, delighting in the flow of
their voices and sight of their queer, familiar faces--the while Mary
Brown was declaring earnestly, and with the emphasis of repetition,
she would never leave me again, and telling me most positively she
had known I was ill, and known it at the time, she being possessed of
the power to know such things; and babies were being shown me that I
might appreciate their growth; and some of the men were presenting me
with fish freshly speared, and others with bundles of jungle-fruit
and jams; and I was handing out largesse in the form of tobacco to
those who asked it, and also to the few who did not; and Togo was
racing with the dogs he had hitherto despised, his aloofness for the
time completely forgotten.</p>

<p>Thus, in a burst of human noises, did my fourteen weeks of
solitude end; and so strange did it all seem that for hours that
night I sat on the verandah and stared along the beach at the
camp-fires flicking holes in the darkness, as I might have stared at
something extremely fascinating, but maybe wholly untrue.</p>

<p>The natives were as as glad to be back as I was to have them back.
Besides having missed their regular ration of tobacco, and the
trade-goods which were their wages, they had found the wild, free
life not nearly so satisfying as it once had been. In that other
haunt of theirs things to eat were far less abundant than they were
here in this one; and though at one time this would have mattered but
little to them, it mattered a great deal now, causing them often to
go hungry, for they had depended so long on being fed from my
store-room therefore neglecting their bushcraft, that at least some
of their skill in hunting was gone.</p>

<p>Further, various misfortunes had attended them. During the day of
their arrival, and the next, they told me of them, now and then
interrupting the telling with wails and fragments of mourning chants.
One of the young men had been taken by a shark when swimming a
river-mouth--taken so quickly that those on the shore saw only a
flash of fin, a downward jerk of the man's black head and then a
wide, pink stain; there was not even time for a cry.</p>

<p>Another of the young men had been found back a little from the
beach with a spear through his chest and another in his throat--the
work of a raiding bush-tribe. And according to custom they had
brought the body with them, wrapped in paper-bark, the young man's
father carrying the burden most of the time, but occasionally his
mother lending a hand; and as the story was being told to me, the
dreadful parcel lay close beside my feet, and I was hard put to it to
dissuade the father from opening it in order to enlist my further
sympathy by sight of the holes the spears had made.</p>

<p>And one of the Old Men had been bitten on the finger by a
brown-snake and his life saved only by prompt sucking of the puncture
and the forcibly keeping of him awake for three full days and nights,
the reason for the latter treatment being that a man awake was always
alive; and a stingaree with a width of half a fathom or more had
lashed open with its sharp barbed tail the leg of a child playing in
the shallows of the beach; and two of the dogs had died--this an
almost as much lamented misfortune as any of the others.</p>

<p>And a man had surprised his youngest, newest and favourite wife in
the embrace of a lover; and with fine attention to detail I was given
a description of the surprising and embrace both, and a translation
of sorts of various epithets hurled at the lover by the husband,
which epithets were all most thoroughly obscene, and told that the
reason for him hurling epithets instead of a spear was that he was
aged and slow of movement, while the lover was young and strong.</p>

<p>And a scarcely adolescent girl had been carried off by one of the
raiding bush-tribe which had speared the young man; and though, by
means of a return-raid, she was duly recovered, a result of her
experience was that it was highly probable she would become a mother,
and bring herself therefore within the ambit of the law which
prescribed death to bearers of illegitimate children. But in the end
no child resulted at all; and when, tremendously relieved, I remarked
on this Mary Brown replied admiringly and knowingly:</p>

<p>'Mother belong that girl smart women. You understand? Very cle-ver
like anything!' from which combination of hint and comment I knew
that the girl's escape from the dreadful operation of that dreadful
law was due to a wide knowledge of abortifacients possessed by her
mother.</p>

<p>They had had misfortunes which to them were subject-matter for
considerable mirth. In one instance a young man had slept so close to
his camp-fire that the hair from one side of his head was singed
completely away, giving him an appearance so strange that he was
promptly given a nickname of twenty or more consonant sounds, which,
translated, meant: The Man Who is Half Old Because He Is Half
Bald--an appellation acutely resented by the young person concerned,
who was rather vain and something of a favourite among the girls. But
the more he resented it, the more it was used; and it was only when
other words were added--words relating to the influence of age on
sexual power--that he agreed to treat the matter as a joke.</p>

<p>Again, a man and his wife awakened one morning to find that their
lean-to hut had collapsed on them in the night, and to find the whole
of the tribe gathered around and making jests about the protruding of
their feet from the ruined dwelling, and asking how they liked
sleeping beneath a blanket of bark. They seemed to think sleeping
beneath a blanket of bark an extremely funny joke. In another
instance, a man had stood accidentally on a live coal from a fire,
and stood there quite an appreciable time without knowing it was
there, so hard and calloused was the sole his foot. But those who saw
him uttered no warning. Instead, they watched breathlessly,
expectantly, awaiting the shock which would come to the man when the
coal ate through to sensitive flesh. They thought this a very fine
joke indeed. With such laughter that they could scarcely get out the
words, they told me how he stood there, sniffing at the smell of
burning and asking what caused it, and how he was told it came from a
piece of wallaby roasting in the hot ashes; and how at last he gave a
most tremendous yell and a spring and began plucking frenziedly at
the fiery thing in his foot; and how the whole tribe burst into an
uproar of laughter, and ribald comment and jeering advice, crying
that they had not thought he was so poor a hunter that he could
obtain nothing to eat in the bush and was therefore driven to cooking
a part of himself, and telling him to take out the coal at once,
before he forgot.</p>

<p>In that it was based on the misfortunes of others, their sense of
humour was full brother to that civilized sense of humour which so
appreciates a spectacle such as that of a stout, elderly, top-hatted
person being cast heavily to the pavement through stepping on a
banana-skin.</p>

<p>They had had further experiences in this eventful sojourn of
theirs. They told me of a big wind driving a pearling lugger high up
on the beach near their camp, and so damaged her forefoot that it was
many days before she was repaired and refloated; and of the Japanese
captain and crew shooting at them when they approached; and of an
agitation among one section of the tribe that they should sweep down
on the strangers and retaliate, and of the firm resolve of another
section that they should do nothing of the kind, for the expressed
reason that clubs and spears were of little avail against guns; and
of a quarrel arising between the two sections, the Yeas accusing the
Noes of cowardice, and the Noes accusing the Yeas of being utter
fools. By the demeanour of the men who told me this story, I judged
that the quarrel was simmering still.</p>

<p>They gave me an account of the murder by natives of a white man at
a spot three hundred miles or more from where they had camped--an
account so remarkable for multiplicity of details, even to the number
of the club-blows, that I thought they referred to some happening of
years before. With tremendous surprise, I then learned that it had
occurred only a few days before--the day they had left on their
return.</p>

<p>The news had come to them by means of smoke-signals, they
explained. The signals had gone up farther along the coast, and the
makers of the signals had obtained the information from signals they
had seen still farther along. The tidings had been thus relayed right
from the place of the tragedy.</p>

<p>I questioned them closely. It seemed to me ridiculous that they
should have learned all this by means of threads of smoke. I told
them it was ridiculous. They shook their heads and maintained stoutly
it was true. They had read the signals perfectly, they said. There
was no mistake. I questioned them again and again. I asked them
cunning, roundabout questions. I asked them questions so arranged as
to bring forth contradictions, were there any to bring forth. But the
story remained in all essentials the same; and at length I put the
matter from me.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the story was true. I heard it from the captain of
the store-ship when it came. A tragedy had happened at the identical
spot the natives had named, and at the identical time they had
stated, and in the identical manner described. In newspapers brought
by the store-ship I read of the stir the tragedy had made, for the
victim was a well-known missionary, renowned for his courage, his
largeness of heart, and the fineness of his work among the natives. I
think I was the first white man to hear of his cruel slaying.</p>

<p>In the course of my eight years among these people, I had many
examples of their ability to converse by means of smoke. Any morning
I might see them make on the beach, close to the edge of the
water--that being the position from where a signal could best be
seen--a bright, quick-flaring fire which presently they would so
overlay with green boughs that a thick grey mass of smoke went up.
Then, a man to each side of it, a wide sheet of bark was so held
across the fire, and removed again, that the general uprising of the
smoke was cut abruptly off, and as abruptly released; and for maybe
half an hour these movements would be repeated, the periodicity of
the intervals varying considerably the while. Then someone would
explain to me that they were informing a neighbouring friendly tribe
that, say, a son had been born to the wife of one of the Old Men,
that a dance was to be held that night in honour of the event, and
that three kangaroos had been speared for the feast.</p>

<p>Or maybe a labourer would drop his axe and look steadily awhile
along the shore, explaining, when I asked him what he saw, that a
certain man of a certain tribe had died within the hour; and in order
to prove to me that this was not merely an excuse to rest awhile from
his labours; he would point far down-coast to a vanishing and
reappearing rod of silvered smoke.</p>

<p>On one occasion that distant rod of smoke gave news of a momentous
kind, though I did not know it at the time. By now some of the
natives had picked up from me various scraps of English, and one of
these interpreted the message, and commented on it, something like
this:</p>

<p>'Plenty fellers fight. Them people who make the smoke been hear
the news from one 'nother people what been hear it from the men
belong one cutter what been anchor at their camp. Plenty fellers
fight. They fight like big hell, and plenty come dead. And all them
fellers, they white fellers. Yes--white fellers. And they too much
plenty, my word! Them people who make the smoke, they say them white
fellers more plenty than the people longa their camp, more plenty
than the people longa this camp, more plenty than altogether people
longa altogether camps. Ah-ugh! I no' believe! It's yarn, Master--you
know, gammon-talk. I no' believe there's so many white fellers as all
that.'</p>

<p>I, too, inclined to the belief that it was a 'yarn', an
elaborately exaggerated report of perhaps a quarrel between two men
on a vessel, or something of the kind; and it was not till weeks
later that I learned it was true--terribly true. That pidgin-English
interpretation of a message in smoke was my intimation of the
beginning of the Great War.</p>

<p>I would have given much to know how they translated those
smoke-movements into intelligibility, to know what was the code. But
I never knew, for whenever I asked them to tell me they steadily
refused, saying it was no use them trying to explain it, as I could
never understand it, any more than they could understand the white
lights of my house, which gave to night the brightness of day. But as
they intimated they would consider it a favour if I allowed the
matter to drop at that, I guessed that--rather than being
difficult--the secret of 'smoke-talking', like the reason of their
carrying about with them the bodies of their dead, was a secret
which, for some peculiar reason of their own, they were determined to
keep to themselves.</p>

<p>They could converse, also, by gestures; but about this means of
communication they made no secret at all, and there came a time when
I was as familiar with it as they were themselves. At first sight the
gestures were somewhat puzzling. But really they were quite
simple.</p>

<p>For instance, it was the custom about midday of one of the men
whose job it was to cook for the others to stand in the camp in so
prominent a position that he would be seen clearly by the labourers
as they worked in the plantation, maybe a quarter of a mile away, and
(1) raise his hands wide apart above his head; (2) bring them down
and describe a circle; (3) draw them towards him as though clawing;
(4) touch his breast on either side; (5) stroke the front of his legs
from groin to knee; and (6) wave a hand from him.</p>

<p>These movements meant:</p>

<p>Hands above heads--All.</p>

<p>Circle--Damper (a large circular scone cooked in the coals).</p>

<p>Clawing--Cooking completed (the clawing represented the scratching
of a damper from a fire).</p>

<p>Touching breast--Women.</p>

<p>Stroking legs--Men.</p>

<p>Wave of hand--Come (they beckoned by waving the hand <i>from</i>
them).</p>

<p>Thus the message read:</p>

<p>'All the dampers are cooked. Women and men come.'</p>

<p>Incidentally, I noticed that that man had a firm belief in the
inequality of the sexes, for whenever it happened that the dampers
were not all cooked, he omitted the women from the message.</p>

<p>On the way back from their other haunt the natives had collected
and brought along with them various members of other coastal
tribes--a score or more men, five or six women, and a spattering of
children--and the coming of these people had several outstanding
results.</p>

<p>One was that I became a father by purchase, so to speak. A day or
two after the home-coming, Mary Brown came to me and asked would I
like a little boy.</p>

<p>'He belongs to them other people, and his mother is dead, and his
father not want him,' she explained. 'His father he not want to be
bothered with him. He want kill him. Kill him yes; like it is the
fashion of men who not want baby. In his camp away there along the
beach he tell me he want kill him like anything. He proper bad man, I
think. I telled him no, he must not do that. It was bad, I said. Very
bad. I speak that missionary and Government not like that kind of
thing. But he not know anything 'bout missionary and Government. I
talked him plenty. And I telled him that s'pose he bring that small
boy here, might be you buy him. Give him plenty somethings from
store. That feller greedy man, and he like plenty somethings from the
store. That boy he nice little feller. S'pose he get killed, I cry
plenty. Ah--plenty.'</p>

<p>I had the man and his son brought to me. The child was a sturdy
little chap, two years old or less, with skin glossy black and a
rounded stomach, which, later I found, swelled visibly when he ate.
The father was a tall, thin-shanked savage, obtrusively nude, with
eyebrows of astonishing heaviness and a nose so wide and flat that
the nostrils were in line with the corners of the mouth--altogether
exactly an idea of a man who would slay his son because he 'not want
to be bothered with him', though till then I had had no idea at all
of what a man who would slay his son would be like. We conversed by
gestures, fragments of native speech and translations by Mary Brown,
for he knew no English at all. He didn't see any harm in killing the
boy, he said, in reply to my attempts to convince him of the dreadful
iniquity of the thing. He had neither the inclination nor the ability
to look after him. It was a woman's job. He wasn't a woman. He was a
man and a hunter and a warrior. Nursing a child was not his
business.</p>

<p>Seeing it was useless to talk further, I took him into the
store-room, leaving the boy on the verandah, and laid on a table near
him a tomahawk, a pound of tobacco, and a fathom of red cloth, and
said I would exchange them for the child.</p>

<p>He looked eagerly at the things and examined them, turning over
the tomahawk, unfolding the cloth a little, smelling the tobacco.
Then he shook his head and looked about him, and presently began
pointing a long black finger at half the things in the room, taking
them singly, shelf by shelf, indiscriminately indicating articles
which would be of little use to him at all, such as a carpenter's
plane, and articles of no use to him at all, such as a box of burners
for my gas. Then he went over them again, adding a few more, and
finally extended his hand wide apart above his head--the gesture
meaning 'ALL'.</p>

<p>Whereupon there burst from Mary Brown, who had followed us in, a
tornado of native speech--far too rapid for my poor understanding of
the tongue--but plainly denunciatory, rebuking, threatening, and
other things besides; and for a full five minutes she continued it,
her eyes glaring, her black face twisted with rage as never I had
seen it twisted before, stamping her small black foot on the floor,
shaking her small black fist in the man's face; then she thrust the
tomahawk, the pound of tobacco, and the fathom of cloth into his
hands and pushed him through the doorway--to which treatment he
showed no resentment at all, but went meekly, uncomplainingly, like a
man bewildered and not a little afraid, as any man might be
bewildered and afraid after being denounced, rebuked and threatened
by one of a sex from which hitherto he had had only great
humility.</p>

<p>'He too much greedy devil!' Mary exclaimed; then the twist of rage
went from her face, and a soft smile in her eyes, she picked up the
boy and placed him in my arms.</p>

<p>I called him Fitzherbert. He seemed to me such a comic little chap
that only a comic name could suit him. There was nothing comic about
Fitzherbert as a name, so far as I knew; but as applied to my
purchase it was distinctly so; perhaps it was because he was so
utterly unlike what I imagined a Fitzherbert would be like. But the
name proved something of a trial to the natives. They found it most
difficult to pronounce. The aspirate worried them, and the 'tz' sound
they could not manage at all. The best they could do was 'Ferbet', or
'Ferbit'; and finally this was reduced to 'Fit'. Mary, however,
disapproved of this easy snipping of the word, and upon all occasion
strove to pronounce the name in full, despite that it gave her as
much trouble as it did any of the others.</p>

<p>'I not like them make fool of name belong that boy,' she said to
me once, indignantly. 'He not boy belong the camp, like them other
childrens. He boy belong you and me.'</p>

<p>Mary, in the bigness of her heart, had a tremendous affection for
Fitzherbert. To her he was exactly as a son. She gave to him the
whole of what spare time she had, besides tending his every want,
making clothes for him and teaching him English from her own poor
store of that tongue, impressing him that he was now the son of a
white man and must therefore grow up like one; and each night when
she returned to the camp, she carried him straddled across her
shoulders, and laid him in a dean bed she had made for him in her
hut. And she made Willie, her husband, teach him something of the
craft of the bush and of the things of the sea, and fashion for him
toy spears and instruct him in their use, and tell him tribal
folk-tales and of the meaning of social institutions.</p>

<p>'When he grows up, he will know all about white men's ways and of
black men's ways, too,' Mary said to me once in explanation of this
method of training. 'He will be cle-ver man like anything!'</p>

<p>In all of this I had but little say. I was, it seemed,
Fitzherbert's nominal possessor only, and had I not definitely
asserted my authority I would have seen but little of my property
indeed. In fact, it was only because Mary Brown had had nothing
wherewith to purchase the boy that the opportunity was mine of buying
him at all. A wonderful mother was lost when it ordained Mary Brown
should be childless.</p>

<p>Fitzherbert accepted the changed condition of his life with all
the casualness of his race, bewailing the absence of his father not
at all, making himself perfectly at home in my house, eating European
foods as complacently as though never he had eaten any other, and so
developing a liking for sweetmeats I obtained for him that no sooner
did I appear from my room at any time than he would come toddling
along the verandah to me, with in his round clear eyes a deep
beseeching, and with one fat hand open and extended and the other
making circular, expectant rubbings of his stomach. The only thing he
disliked in this new existence of his was clothing; on every possible
occasion he promptly shed the garments Mary Brown so lovingly made
him, and delightedly went nude; and such was his distress when Mary
reclothed him that I was impelled to order the he be allowed to
please himself in the matter. With respect to covering his limbs,
Fitzherbert was well and truly a savage, and he maintained this
attitude for so many years that Mary nearly broke her heart about it.
She would never make him all-same white man if he didn't wear
clothes, she said. All white men wore clothes. She had never seen one
naked. Never.</p>

<p>I fully expected that Fitzherbert's father would attempt to
wheedle further goods from me. But he didn't. Neither did he
interfere with his son in any way. In fact, during his stay at the
plantation camp he took scarcely any notice of him, and after he
returned to his own haunt I never saw him again. He seemed perfectly
satisfied with the deal. He was the most superbly indifferent father
I ever came across, and also the most nonchalant member of a race
whose almost greatest characteristic quality was nonchalance.</p>

<p>Another outstanding result of the coming of those other coastal
people was that my natives rose against me, being stirred thereto by
one of the visitors. He was a young man, broadly built and long of
arm, with a head a great deal too large for his body, and an
expression of face exceedingly ill-favoured. He made no offer to work
awhile on the plantation, as did his companions, neither did he
assist my men whenever they went hunting, Instead, he stayed always
about the camp, gossiping with the Old Men and the women, and taking
a full share of the labourers' food; and for long after the others of
his tribe returned to their home he remained there--showing indeed
every symptom of becoming a fixture in the place.</p>

<p>For a time I made no objection to him staying. It was no business
of mine if the natives chose to allow him to batten on them in this
way. But one day some of the labourers came to me complaining they
were not receiving sufficient food; and on inquiring I found that the
shortage was due to their giving the young gentleman with the large
head part of their share. It was not their fashion to see a stranger
hungry, they said when I told them that this was foolish. If a man
needed food, and they had it, they gave it him. The fact the man
neither hunted nor worked made no difference. It was their fashion.
Meanwhile would I increase the size of their portions?</p>

<p>I went at once to the camp and found the cause of the trouble, and
told him, by means of the usual medley of speech and gesture, that I
definitely refused to have him on my hands as a guest, and that he
was forthwith to cease sharing the labourers' food, that he was to
return whence he came, and that if he didn't start immediately I
would myself drive him forth--to all of which he listened in silence,
though with a curious leer on his ill-favoured face, and at the end
remarked that he would leave next day. Whereupon, I nodded agreement
and returned to the house, pleasantly surprised at this tame ending
to what I had expected would be a somewhat troublesome affair.</p>

<p>But it didn't end there. Next morning there was none of the usual
procession of women coming to the house for supplies of flour for
breakfast, and when I looked out upon the plantation not a labourer
was to be seen, though they should have been at work a full hour
before; and Mary Brown, when she came, was strangely ill at ease, and
filled with affrighted mutterings that something was wrong, but what
it was she didn't know.</p>

<p>'The men been talk last night--talk like anything--quiet among
themselves,' she said. 'They not let me hear and they not tell me,
because I good friend for you.'</p>

<p>Again I went to the camp, this time with a revolver in my pocket.
The people, grouped about their fires, took no heed of my presence,
but sat silently looking one at another, or across the sea, or at the
jungle, their faces sullen, frowning; my only welcome was a great
barking from the dogs. I spoke to the group nearest me--spoke
quietly, unheatedly, asking what was wrong that they were not at work
as usual, There was no reply--only that sullen staring. More than a
little uneasy, I spoke to another group, singling out various of its
members, addressing them by name. Still there was no reply; and the
only movement among them was that of a child trying to make towards
me, and its mother's withdrawing hand. Then as I made to speak again,
a man sitting by himself turned his head and looked at me defiantly,
and in the tone of one who exclaims at remembrance of something long
forgotten, cried loudly:</p>

<p>'No work! Finish work!'</p>

<p>And I knew definitely they had gone on strike.</p>

<p>I went back to the house soon after that, for I knew that in their
present sullenness neither coaxing nor rebuke would be of any use.
When they realized that going on strike meant going hungry, they
would be ready enough to work, I told myself. But presently from the
verandah I saw some of them, spears and dubs in hand, straggle out
into the bush, and others make towards a fishing-pool in the mouth of
the creek along the beach; and I knew that their giving-in would not
be so speedy a matter after all.</p>

<p>On my visit to the camp I had seen nothing of the large-headed
youth who had battened so freely on the labourers; but I wondered if
he had anything to do with the revolt. There seemed to me something
of a connexion between my ordering of him off the premises and this
sudden cessation of work.</p>

<p>There was. A little before sundown that day, the whole of the
males of the tribe trooped up to the house and arranged themselves in
the dear space in front. At their approach Mary Brown caught up
Fitzherbert, who was playing near, and with her husband hurried to
the kitchen. I stepped to one of the wide window-like openings in the
cane screening of the verandah, a rifle in my hands, and my revolver
still in my pocket, and asked what they wanted. A glance at the camp
showed me the women standing watching in a group; I could almost see
the strained attention of their faces; the frightened crying of a
child or two came clearly.</p>

<p>The men were all armed, some with their spears loosely beneath
their arms, others grasping them with their hands, mostly about the
middle--the favourite throwing position--while one or two trailed
them between their toes. Those with clubs held them menacingly by the
handle. I so swung the rifle in the crook of my arm that it pointed
towards them tentatively, carelessly, singling out no one in
particular, yet ready for definite and immediate aim.</p>

<p>For a while we stood there, facing one another, the natives more
sullen of expression than ever, I anxious, horribly afraid, filled to
overflowing with the knowledge that one man would have no chance of
keeping back such a horde should they choose to rush, and cursing the
hour when I entered upon an undertaking entailing such risks as
this.</p>

<p>Again I asked what they wanted, and allowed the rifle-point to
wander aimlessly. Then a man laid down his spear, stepped forth a
pace or two and began to speak.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable oration. It was filled with guttural
mutterings and mumblings and splutterings. It was punctuated by
various wild movements of hands and feet and head. But its meaning
was plain. It was a demand that I should hail the first vessel that
came in sight, and go away!</p>

<p>The people of the Place of Many Big Trees were tired of having a
white man on their ground, he said in effect. What right had the
white man to take their ground like this? It was the natives' ground.
It had always been their ground. And their fathers' ground. The white
man had no right to cut down and burn the jungle as he had done. No
right at all. Many food-trees had the white man destroyed--white
apple trees, and wangai trees--very many. They were the natives'
trees--not the white man's. They wondered they had not thought of
this before. It was he with the large head who had told them of it.
He was a great man, he of the large head, though but a youth. And
what right had the white man to tell that same youth to go away? It
was their camp--not the white man's. They could have in their camp
whom they liked. It was too much. They were determined to drive the
white man away.</p>

<p>The crowd greeted this speech with many 'Ah-ughs!' and other
noises intended to signify appreciation, and when the speaker was
done there burst from them a welter of strange cries, accompanied by
much thudding of clubs on the ground, and the rattling of spears.
Many of them surged forward. There was a vicious gleaming in their
eyes. A laughing-jackass giggled from a tree near by. In the kitchen
Fitzherbert was crying and Mary Brown crooning to him. I raised my
rifle, fitted the butt to my shoulder and took aim at the nearest of
the crowd.</p>

<p>And with that those in front shrank back, while the man at whom I
aimed turned and dived back through them; whereupon I realized gladly
that by reason of the fact that no one was willing to be in front,
there was not likely to be any rush. And neither there was, for after
a time they drew away from the house and went straggling off to their
camp, though not before various menacing speeches had been hurled at
me and I had made decisively-toned threats in return.</p>

<p>That night was a dreadful night to me, also to Mary Brown and
Willie, who went not to the camp, but stayed with me instead, for
fear of what might happen to them for being my great friends. We lay
on the mats of the floor, the three of us--Fitzherbert being put to
sleep in my bed--with all lights out, and keeping very still--and
listening, listening, listening. For my part, I heard all manner of
sounds charged with menace. Never, it seemed to me, had there been a
night so filled with small and menacing sounds. I heard them
continuously, the ordinary sounds of the jungle night, distant sounds
and near sounds and nearing sounds, and sounds born of a mating of
fear with strained intentness of the senses; and all of them as
sounds of stealthily approaching blacks. And I knew Mary Brown and
Willie heard them, too.</p>

<p>The night passed, slowly, infinitely slowly; and with the coming
of dawn I slept, as seldom in my life I had slept, the while Mary and
Willie took turns at keeping watch; and at midday when I awoke I
hailed the natives as they idled about the camp; and when they
came--suspiciously, haltingly--I made parley with them, telling them
they were right in saying I had no right to their land, though the
Government man at Thursday Island had told me the land was mine and
given me a paper, stamped with a great red seal, to that effect. It
wasn't the Government man's land to give, I told them. They were the
real owners, and the best thing I could do was buy the land from
them. What did they think of that as a way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>They thought it a very fine way out indeed, and at my invitation
the chiefs followed me into the storeroom to receive payment at once,
the amount of which they left entirely to me, but suggested two
pounds of tobacco as a fair thing. Whereupon, in order to make a good
fellow of myself, I gave them tobacco to double that quantity, added
a half-dozen sheath-knives, a roll of cloth and one or two other
things--all of which they took without expression either of gratitude
or delight, but carried them outside and shared them with the others
forthwith; and never again was there any dispute as to who was the
owner of the land.</p>

<p>As for the youth with the outsize in heads, he begged what he
could of the tobacco and things I had paid, and that day returned to
the place of his own tribe, and troubled me no more. While as for the
night I had feared the natives' attack--I discovered long afterwards
that they, too, had stayed awake hour after hour, listening,
watching, armed and ready. They were afraid that I would attack
them!</p>

<h2><a name="ch8"></a>Chapter Eight</h2>

<h3>BILLY NUMBER FIVE</h3>

<p>In so far as it was a matter of clearing, planting, and fighting
back jungle-growths, the second year was a replica of the first.</p>

<p>But it was a much more satisfactory year. The area cleared was
twice as great--mainly because the natives were now more familiar
with axes and other tools, though still far from completely familiar
with them. The jungle growths' attack was less than half as
fierce--result of our persistent counterattack being aided by partial
failure of the rains. And the number of the palms planted was so many
that the cultivated area extended inland for more than a quarter of a
mile and for twice that distance paralleled the beach--a not very
large area as plantation areas go, but one which gave me considerable
satisfaction nevertheless. I felt a Settled and Respectable Person
more than ever.</p>

<p>Then, too, there were but few of the trials and difficulties of
those earlier days. Never again was I left wholly alone. The natives
still went on their wanderings, but never did the whole of them go at
once. They went in batches, of a score or more perhaps, and going
rather hesitatingly at that, for by now they had become so accustomed
to European foods and goods that voluntarily doing without them was
not a matter to be lightly undertaken. Their nomadic instinct,
powerful though it was, was trammelled by their new desires and need
to satisfy those desires.</p>

<p>One of them told me wistfully of his idea of an ideal existence:
'Spose I all-time got them things you give me, then I all-time
walk-about,' and another remarked that it was strange that I,
actually having these coveted things in abundance, should be content
to remain so long in one place. All of which caused me to speculate
whether, in being responsible for the implanting of those desires and
needs, I was not guilty of a social wrong. There may have been
something altruistic in raising a people a little from the depths of
a great primitiveness. There was something definitely immoral in
destroying their peace of mind.</p>

<p>Mary Brown was true to her promise never to leave me again. But
the wanderlust tugged strongly at her at times; more than once I saw
her watching the departure of a batch of the tribe, waving to them
farewells profoundly wistful, gazing up at the beach long after they
had passed from sight, the light of a great desiring in her eyes the
while; more than once after such a departure was her cheerfulness for
a time displaced by an air of dissatisfaction, and restlessness, and
periods of glum silence. I think that but for an order I had given
that Fitzherbert was never to be taken on any of these wanderings,
she would have gone at least once. I don't think her fidelity to me
would have been equal to the strain. But she could not endure to be
parted from Fitzherbert. Her love for that child of my purchasing was
stronger than the power of the mighty nomadic instinct.</p>

<p>But Willie, her husband, went upon almost every occasion. Save
only in the matter of changing his name, Willie was effected by the
civilizing influence less than any of the others--this despite the
fact that he was brought into closer contact with it, having a wife
whose outlook was considerably European, and spending most of his
time at my house. Willie was a thoroughly conservative savage. So far
as was possible, he allowed nothing to interfere with his primeval
urgings. He liked Fitzherbert immensely, and he liked the European
foods and goods quite as much as the rest of the tribe liked them.
But he did not allow these likings to override his nomadic instinct.
If it occurred to him to join a party setting forth, he neither
hesitated nor thought of the future, but joined it forthwith, making
a head-bundle of whatever of his few possessions lay to hand, and
grunting a farewell to his wife and Fitzherbert, and informing me:
'Might be I come back sometime,' by which doubly indefinite statement
he meant that his absence would be purely temporary.</p>

<p>And Mary would watch him go in the same sad manner she watched any
of them go; but her period of depression would last longer; and when
I tried to cheer her, saying he would surely return and that quickly
perhaps, she would reply that she knew that, and confess a fear that
maybe he would be attracted to some other woman in his journeying, a
younger woman and more handsome than she, there being many such, and
add despondently that her limbs were thin and her breasts quite flat,
that she was getting old...so old...</p>

<p>Then at length she would brighten and become her cheerful self
again, saying light-heartedly that it would be a peculiar woman
indeed who would look admiringly upon this wandering husband of hers,
he being entirely unbeautiful in every way and having a most
unbeautiful habit of screwing up one side of his face, besides being
nearly as old as she was herself. And with that she would put the
matter from her till such time as the wanderers returned, when she
would question closely the women and others of the party as to her
husband's conduct. But never once was there even a breath of
suspicion against him. I think he was as fond of his wife as ever a
savage can be fond of his wife, and respected her besides, and was
always faithful to her.</p>

<p>By the end of the third year the plantation was made--that is to
say, I cleared and planted no more, but gave all my attention to
tending the palms, of which there were now five thousand or more, all
of them flourishing even more sturdily than I had hoped they would
flourish. The converting of a black man's jungle into a white man's
garden was accomplished. It was a matter now only of waiting for the
palms to fruit, meanwhile keeping them clear of weeds and interfering
growths. Life became easier and more comfortable for me. I looked
forward to five years of comfort and ease, when the gathering of the
harvest would begin.</p>

<p>In my wilding days such a prospect would have appalled me. In five
years of waiting for a harvest I would have seen only dreadful
inaction, dreary monotony. The daily routine of serving out rations
and overseeing hoeing and weeding would have driven me near to
frenzy. But I was a wilding no longer. Assuredly I was a wilding no
longer. I liked comfort and ease. The restfulness of the agricultural
life appealed to me. I developed the agricultural habit. The growth
of the palms interested me tremendously. I watch them as intimately
as a suburban dweller watches the flowers in his tiny suburban
garden. The fact that a certain palm had at last thrust forth its
fifth frond interested me more than the fact that I lived in one of
the least-known parts of the world. The knowledge that a palm had
grown so sturdily that already its bole was pushing above the ground
was more to me than the knowledge that I, a product of modernity,
mingled hourly with people ten thousand years, and more, behind the
times. I gain an agricultural perspective, so to speak.</p>

<p>I had now far more labour than I needed, for with only hoeing and
weeding to be done, less than half the tribe were employed. And the
surplusage was increased by the coming of tribes from other parts of
the coas--tribes of a score or less, tribes of a hundred or
more--tribes which came merely on a wandering, tribes which came from
curiosity to see the white man's garden, which by now was the talk of
all the beaches; and while some of them stayed a week or two only,
some of them stayed for months; and always when they departed various
of their numbers remained behind--some because they had formed
attachments with girls and women of my tribe, some because they
couldn't be bothered to shift, some for no discoverable reason at
all. So many were there of them that among the trees fringing the
beach a second camp was formed, and eventually a third. The Place of
the Many Big Trees became a populous centre. It contained more people
than ever it had contained before, and more were arriving all the
while.</p>

<p>And as is usual in populous centres, there arose the problem of
everyone obtaining a sufficiency of food. So many were the hunters
that game grew exceedingly scarce; indeed there were more hunters
than game. The jungle was a supplier of vegetables and fruit, but not
for such numbers as these. The sea was abundant with fish, but only
for certain periods of the year, and those periods were wide apart.
The new people were driven to begging from me whatever they could,
and to sharing in the rations of my labourers, which sharing sent the
labourers to me for increased supplies and made for such general
dissatisfaction that at length I advised the strangers it would be
much to their advantage if they returned whence they came.</p>

<p>But they were not at all anxious to go, nor were my people anxious
for them to go, being essentially gregarious and fond of numbers. I
did not press the matter; I saw the departure of the strangers would
unsettle my people somewhat, and I did not want to unsettle them in
the least. Instead, I conceived an alternative--that of inducing them
to grow their food; and one night I went to the camp to make
revelation of a plan I formed to this end.</p>

<p>That night stands out in my memory. I had intended to put the
matter to one or two of the chief men and leave them to explain it to
the rest of the tribes, merely to implant the seed of my idea and
allow it to fructify of itself--the most successful means I knew of
inducing these people to accept an innovation. But when I reached the
camp I was seized with the knowledge that this was far more than a
mere relieving of a pressing food question. It had a deeper and a
wider significance than that. It had a tremendously important social
significance. I was about to attempt changing the chief habit of a
people whose chief habit was far older than recorded history. I was
about to attempt bridging the ages-wide gap between nomadism and
husbandry, between living by the chase and living by the hoe, between
thriftless wandering and responsible industriousness. I was about to
attempt persuading a whole people to accept their heritage of the
earth. This was no matter to be given forth at second-hand by one or
two chiefs. It was too big an innovation for that. I flamed with
desire to tell the people myself.</p>

<p>Some of them were gathered about their huts, some asleep on their
faces, their folded arms for pillows, their dull black bodies as
smudges on the greyness of the sand; others sat in idly talking
groups; others, spear in hand, paraded the beach in search of small
fish seeking the shallows. On my calling to them, they came
wonderingly and formed an irregular ring about me in the centre of
the camp, the men in front, the women behind, the children all over
the place. Here and there a small uncertain fire blinked like a
sleepy eye. The scent of wood-smoke wandered vaguely on the still
air. A screen of white clouds hid the zenith moon, and with edgings
of brightest silver revealed that she was there. The sea was a carpet
of softest purple and the beach its wide grey border. The irregular
ring of the natives was as an enclosure of strangely substantial
shadows.</p>

<p>I gave myself whole-heartedly to my task. I began with a
dissertation on improvidence. It is difficult to deliver a
dissertation on improvidence in a language made up of gestures, an
English of a kind, and scraps of an exceedingly limited native
tongue; but I did it. I rubbed it in about improvidence, giving
various illustrations of its grievous effects, and of the foolishness
in general of taking no thought for the future, but first explaining
what the future was.</p>

<p>I proceeded then to the evil of wandering, and from wandering to
the evil of living by the chase or by whatever lay to hand, asking
them to recall the weariness of resultless buntings, the hungers they
had endured, the constant alternation between well-filled and
starved--by pantomime I showed them the hunter on a successful day as
a person with a stomach aggressively protruded, and the hunter on an
unsuccessful day as a person straight up and down as a spear. For
maybe half an hour I continued in this strain.</p>

<p>Then I paused for comment or appreciation, if any. There was none;
the only sounds were the sudden crying of a child and the snarling of
a pair of dogs. The moon rent the screen of white clouds and made of
the carpet of the sea a silver plate and laid on the ground a tracery
of branches. The enclosure of strangely substantial shadows was
spotted with the shine of eyes.</p>

<p>I then spoke of the advantages of growing food instead of
haphazardly seeking it. The earth, I told them, was theirs for the
using, and if they chose to use it they would never go hungry again.
I said I would help them in every way I could. I offered to give them
a piece of my cleared land, and to lend them tools with which to till
it, and to supply them with various cuttings and seeds, and to teach
them to plant and tend them. I enthused on the number and size of the
things they could grow. I gave wings to description and let
exaggeration run free. I described bunches of bananas taller than I
was, sweet-potatoes thicker than my leg, yams larger than my head. I
mimicked men bent double carrying home the harvest, women staggering
beneath loads of it, children with their arms burdened full. I
indicated piles of food as high as a tree and higher, and huts so
filled with edibles that their owners slept outside, and drew a
gesticulated picture of a condition wherein every night was a
feasting night and everyone's stomach protruded aggressively all the
time. Then I dramatically ceased and asked what they thought of
it.</p>

<p>At first it seemed that my gymnastic oratory had thoroughly failed
to impress them; they just sat there silently as ever, and scarcely
moving, the moonlight showing their expressions seemingly as sullen.
But presently one spoke to his neighbour, then another and another,
and a great chattering arose among the women, and a youth opined
loudly that an abundance of food such as I had described would be a
most excellent thing, and a number of the others called corroboration
of that opinion and declaration that they had thought out the matter
carefully, and various of them rose and crowded about me, mostly all
talking at once, some stating they were fools not to have thought of
such a plan themselves, some asking if I could let them have the land
at once, and all of them wedging in remarks to the effect that I was
a darn' good fellow indeed.</p>

<p>I had not expected such prompt appreciation. At best I had
expected they would agree to consider the matter at their leisure
among themselves, that it would be necessary to lecture them again
and again, that the inducing of them to change their way of life so
completely would be a task needing considerable pains and time. This
ready response gratified me exceedingly. It was, I felt, a tribute to
my power of oratory. By a speech of an hour I had converted a
community of nomads into a community of husbandmen. Sitting on my
verandah that night, listening to the voices of the natives talking
eagerly of the well-fed existence which was to be theirs, I told
myself I had achieved something very remarkable indeed.</p>

<p>I was soon to discover I had done nothing of the kind. They were
the worst farmers that ever were--though they were quick enough to
use the land I gave them, working it enthusiastically, digging and
planting even through the hottest parts of the day. Instead of
awaking an agricultural instinct, I found there was none to be
awakened. They planted, but with that considered there was no more to
be done; the routine of weeding was abhorrent to them, as all
routines were abhorrent to them. They could not await the ripening of
what they planted; the yams and sweet-potatoes they dug up almost as
soon as formed. Their enthusiasm waned, and finally died. One by one
they abandoned their plots of land, taking no heed of my
remonstrating or advising, but declaring (1) the things took too long
to grow, and that hunting was quicker; (2) they didn't like such
constant work; (3) it was not their fashion. They returned to sharing
my labourers' rations and to begging what they could from me; and
when they discovered that I was steadfast in my refusal to accede to
their demands, the majority of them made a camp a few miles down the
coast, where jungle-foods were more or less abundant. My grand scheme
had utterly collapsed. As an uplifter of primitive peoples I was a
thoroughly complete failure.</p>

<p>About this time it came to me that I should have an overseer. The
work being now mainly a simple routine, the only reason for my
continual presence in the field was to see that the labourers kept at
their tasks--and another could do that quite as well as I. Besides,
overseers were outstanding features of plantations. Whoever heard of
a plantation without an overseer? Attending to such details as
supervising labourers at their tasks should be beneath my dignity as
a fully developed Planter. It should be mine to attend only to the
Higher Management and to matters of Policy. As The Master, The Big
Boss, I should be a languid gentleman who rose late, strolled
casually a while about the property, and spent the remainder of the
day in a lounge-chair on the verandah. Most certainly I should have
an overseer. To be without at least one was not like being a Planter
at all.</p>

<p>I offered the post to the apparently most intelligent of the
labourers, who was something of a leader besides. I explained that he
would perform no manual labour himself, but only see that others
performed it, and I promised that, in view of his raised estate, I
would pay him two sticks of tobacco extra each week and supplement
his rations with such coveted things as a tin or two of fish, cups of
sugar, a pot of jam.</p>

<p>He accepted with profound enthusiasm. That would be good-one job,
he declared. No work like hell--only watch them other poor fellers
work--and all-time have plenty flour and tobac' and--my word--tin'
fish! That was proper good-one job! He would never come tired of job
like that.</p>

<p>He proved completely unsatisfactory. He had no sense of mastership
whatever. That he was invested with authority meant nothing to him.
He allowed the labourers to come and depart early, to rest as often
as they wished and for as long as they wished, to sleep away whole
afternoons, perhaps. Who was he to rebuke them? was the burden of
what he said when I reproached him. They were his own people, his
brothers, his friends. He could not speak harshly to them. They would
think him a hard and cruel person, and dislike him. And he doubted if
they would obey him, anyway, for he was not really a Master, but
merely one of themselves. I explained to him carefully and at
considerable length that in having my authority behind him, he had
the same power as I had, and ordered him to use it; and to the
labourers I explained it all over again, and ordered them to obey.
But it was of no use, and after a time I reduced the overseer to the
position of labourer again--which reducing he accepted cheerfully
enough--willingly almost--his only regret at the loss of his higher
estate being the loss of increased rations and tobacco.</p>

<p>At various periods I tried others of them--half a dozen of them,
including two of the Old Men, and a strapping young person reputed a
gifted leader in time of battle. None of them was of the least use;
and at length I came to understanding of the fact that it was
contrary to the communalism of their lives that one of them should be
raised above the others by an agency outside the tribe. The only
power one of them had over another was wholly within the tribe, and
was either inherited or earned--inherited, as in the case of
chieftainship; earned, as in the case of prowess in battle or in
hunting. Power from an extraneous source was not recognized as power
at all. My nominating of an individual as a person of authority meant
nothing whatever; as a maker of rulers I had no standing. In view of
this, I abandoned the attempt to make one of them an overseer, and
resumed my personal supervision of the labourers at their tasks.</p>

<p>Some time later, however, I obtained a quite excellent overseer.
When I returned from the plantation one afternoon, I found sitting on
the verandah steps a native I had never seen before--a strongly built
man, he was, maybe forty years of age, dully black as the rest of his
race, but sharper-looking and more intelligent of expression, and
dressed in trousers, shirt, and a hat, none of which had the
'cast-offs' appearance which clothes worn by natives usually had, but
were quite new and well-fitting. At sight of me he rose, came to meet
me, took off his hat politely, held out his hand and remarked in
quite good English that it was a fine day.</p>

<p>Then he said his name was Billy Number Five, but if I liked I
could call him Charlie, or Tommy, or Henry, or anything at all. He
didn't mind. He'd been called all those names at one time or
another--and other ones, too--not such nice ones. The white men he'd
worked for called a native by the first name they thought of, but
they liked Billy best. Lots of natives were named Billy. Among the
crew of a lugger he'd worked in were six Billys, and, so's he know
which was which, the captain gave them numbers besides. He was number
five. That was a long time ago; but the name had stuck to him.
Perhaps I'd better call him Billy Number Five. He was more used to
it, like.</p>

<p>I made some commonplace remark, and asked him what he did here,
and how he came here, and what he wanted. But I did not address him
in the rough-and-ready manner in which I addressed the labourers.
This native's manner and bearing were as the manner and bearing of a
white man. I had an uncomfortable feeling that I was not speaking to
a native at all, but to a kind of white black-man. That a native
should speak English with such ease, disconcerted me somewhat. I had
so long been accustomed to wild and uncouth blacks that it was almost
as if I believed there was no other kind of black.</p>

<p>He made no direct answers to my questions, but, looking across the
plantation and then at the house, remarked that I had a damn' fine
place here, and that he wouldn't mind taking a job from me, if I had
one to give him. He'd worked for whites all his life, he went on.
He'd been born and reared close to a settlement. He worked in cutters
and luggers--pearling and all that. He'd been at all kinds of jobs,
even on a farm--milking cows. Not much of a game, that. Too constant.
Too much Sunday work. He liked to be free of a Sunday, if he could.
No; he wasn't religious, or a mission man, or anything. Missions were
no good to him. But Sunday was a day of spell, when a feller liked to
put on his best pants and all that, and stroll about the township.
But milking cows was not as constant as the last job he'd had. A
month ago, he'd signed on for a year in the stokehold of a small
steamer running the coast--a cargo-ship. It was a rotten job. Damn'
rotten.</p>

<p>'I chucked it at Thursday Island,' he said. 'It was too hot down
there in that stokehold. And dirty! I was black with coal all over.
And the engineers was always goin' sore on me. You should 'a' heard
them! It was all the time: "Billy Number Five, you black bastid,
where are you?" "Billy, if you don't trim the coal better than this,
I'll ram some of it down your bloody throat." "Billy, shake it up
there, blarst you!" Billy--Billy--all over the place. Talk about a
constant job! It was too constant for me. You'd 'a' thought I was
running the flamin' engine-room! It was no good to me. Two nights ago
I cleared from her, got a passage in a cutter coming this way, and
landed a coupler miles along the beach there. I don't reckon they'll
come looking for me. Glad to get rid of me, I 'spect. The old woman
who cooks for you told me you wanted someone to work your niggers.
How'll I do?</p>

<p>I appointed him on trial, but very soon took him on permanently,
for he proved a most efficient overseer. Despite the fact that he was
as full-blooded a native as any of the others, he had none of their
belief in the impotence of conferred power. His long association with
whites had knocked such ideas out of him completely. He had no
difficulty in making the natives work. He liked being a Boss. He
revelled in his vesture of authority. As in the stokehold he had been
cursed by those above him, so now did he curse those beneath him. But
there was no real sting in his curses, and his anger was oftener
pretended than not; and the labourers knew it, and resented his
seeming harshness not at all, but seemingly were all the cheerier for
it.</p>

<p>Billy Number Five became one of the fixtures of the property. Like
me, he discovered he was tired of roaming and that the settled life
was the life for him. He married one of the girls of the tribe--the
girl who had been captured by the bush-tribe and had been in
considerable danger of being done to death as the bearer of an
illegitimate child--and I had erected for them a small house a little
distance from my own. Billy furnished the house in white-man fashion,
and patiently instructed his wife in white-man ways, and loved her so
devotedly that he was wont to declare that if ever a missionary
should come this way, he would ask him to marry them properly with
ring and paper.</p>

<p>Despite his civilized attributes, however, Billy in certain
respects was entirely a native. Dear to him was the native habit of
squatting about the camp when the day's work was done, and gossiping
over the events, and droning fragments of chants, or maybe staring
aimlessly out across the sea; the earlier part of each of his
evenings was usually spent thus. He joined always in the dances,
giving himself to the sensual swayings and leapings and prancings
with all the abandon with which the others gave themselves to them,
the while savagely roaring the four-note song. And, though he
affected to me to mock at such legends and beliefs, I had various
convincing proofs that he really believed in the existence of the
Listening Trees, and the story of the God Without a Job was a true
story, and that various wholly incredible myths were faithful
narrations of facts. In these respects the influence of his heredity
was far too powerful for the influence of a superimposed
civilization.</p>

<p>Life was for now easier and more comfortable still. I had an
overseer, and the plantation was therefore a real plantation, and I
was a real Planter who could be the languid gentleman as much as I
wished. The virtues of the settled life appealed to me more than
ever, and with increasing puzzlement I wondered I should have found
in roaming any satisfaction at all. Wandering from place to place,
trying occupation after occupation, seemed the most futile and
footling existence possible. I was convinced I was born for the life
I now led. I had a plantation, a house, furniture, an overseer, a
cook, a crowd of workmen, and a son of sorts. Never before had I had
anything like so many possessions. The pleasure of acquisition was
mine. I was an extremely self-satisfied young person indeed.</p>

<p>There was, however, little of the monotonous about my existence.
This place of mine was still a place of adventure. I was still in a
land of savages, a land where something was always liable to happen.
In fact, there was always something happening. My tribe quarrelled
much with those of the strange tribes who remained--quarrelled
usually about women, quarrelled bitterly, brutally, with
spear-thrusts and club-blows following their shouted exchange of
insult and obscenity. And the quarrels were seldom confined to the
principals, but extended to people more or less indefinitely
concerned, and to some maybe not concerned in the original dispute at
all, so that for hours on end the whole camp would be in uproar; and
for fully half of the following day I would be kept busy tending
their innumerable bruises and cuts. On one such occasion the
disturbance threatened to become so serious that, accompanied by
Billy Number Five, I was compelled to arm myself and go to the camp
and quell the uproar by the only means I knew--forcing the principals
at revolver-point to the house and tying them to the verandah-posts
till such time as their hot anger was somewhat cooled. This treatment
they resented afterwards not at all; indeed, I think each was
secretly gratified that the offensive propensities of his enemy had
been rendered powerless. In their normal, unheated state of mind,
these people were curiously afraid of one another; they would, in
fact, go to all manner of pains to avoid giving such offence as would
lead to a quarrel. It was only when their blood was up, when stirred
by a real, or imagined, wrong that they didn't care what they
did.</p>

<p>These quarrels, however, were as nothing compared with a tribal
war they indulged in--an attack on the bush-tribe which had slain the
young man whose body was found in the jungle with spear-holes in his
chest and throat, and had stolen the girl who was now the wife of
Billy Number Five. The bush-tribe, in the course of its wanderings,
had camped within a half-day's journey of the plantation, and one of
my men when hunting saw them from a hill-top and hurried back to
report.</p>

<p>Despite my remonstrances and the bullying commands of Billy Number
Five, an attack was promptly decided upon. Those bushmen were their
hereditary enemies, I was told in effect, and this was too good an
opportunity to miss. Always did they fight bushmen when they could.
Always. Besides, had not this tribe killed the young man and stolen
the girl?</p>

<p>That night there was a strange quiet in the camp. There was
neither dancing nor singing of war-songs, as I had expected there
would be. Mary Brown explained to me that this was because they
wanted to surprise the bushmen.</p>

<p>'Them bush fellers walk about plenty in night-time, and might be
they hear if people belong you and me sing war-songs. 'Spose they
hear them, then tomorrow they gone.'</p>

<p>In another attempt to dissuade them, I went again to the camp. The
fires had all been carefully extinguished--in case any of the
night-wandering bushmen should see. The women were in the huts,
chanting disjointedly. By the light of the stars men were smearing
their bodies with white clay and white ashes, and with tree-gum
sticking feathers on their arms and in their hair. Some had whitened
their faces, but had so left circles about their eyes that they
appeared to be wearing dark grotesque spectacles. Some had so smeared
red ochre on the white smearing of their bodies that they were as
though splashed with blood. One whose face was so overlaid with white
and red markings that he seemed to be wearing a mask was sharpening a
number of spears with a flint. There was a sinister determination
about his movements.</p>

<p>There was a sinister determination about the movements of them
all. No one answered me when I spoke; they took no heed of me at all.
I was completely ignored, and the ignoring was of a quality which was
decisive warning that it would be much to my advantage if I refrained
from interference. It was plain also that it was only with great
difficulty that they maintained their quiet. Everywhere was apparent
a tremendous tension; if only one of them had broken into a loud
war-chant, I am sure the whole of them would have been transformed in
a moment into a crowd of frenzied, yelling demons. The tension, the
unnatural quiet, the darkness, the disjointed chanting of the women
gave to the scene a peculiar eeriness.</p>

<p>There was nothing I could do. Neither threats nor cajolery were of
any avail. I returned to the house; and all that night lay awake
thinking of those hideous painted faces and bodies, and listening
vainly for some sound to disturb the ominous silence of the camp. At
dawn I rose, went out on to the verandah, and watched for their
departure.</p>

<p>With the rising of the sun they came out from the camp--about
forty of them all told--each with his clubs and spears so held that
they made no rattling one against another; and walking in single
file, they struck across the plantation straight inland, the dull
dead whiteness of their bodies in sharp relief to the sunlit
greenness of the palms; then they entered the jungle and disappeared.
Back in the camp the women stood grouped, watching, their small
children straddled on their hips, the others clinging about their
legs. There came to me sound of a high-pitched wailing, and a
long-drawn howling of dogs.</p>

<p>It was two days before they returned, and for the whole of that
time there was no news of them. I think I was as anxious as any of
their women. I discovered that I had quite an affection for them. I
forgot their various revolting and disgusting practices. I forgot
they were red, raw savages. I remembered that they were in the habit
of affectionately acclaiming me in song. I remembered that it was
their hands which had made this satisfying plantation of mine. The
fact of their being in danger brought them closer to me than ever
they had been before--closer indeed than ever I had thought they
could be.</p>

<p>More than once I thought of following them, and at least trying to
persuade them to return. But the knowledge of how useless it would be
deterred me. No power short of overwhelming force could induce
war-excited savages to abandon an attack. They would recognize no
other persuasion.</p>

<p>They returned in the night-time--about midnight--returned with an
exultant shouting and singing and yelling which announced their
coming long before they appeared. And the moment they reached the
camp there began a great singing of victory songs and a wild, mad
dancing which continued all that night and the next day and the day
after that, a dancing and singing in which Mary Brown joined as
vigorously as any of the others, and Billy Number Five was often a
leading performer.</p>

<p>But they spoke to me little of what had happened away there in the
bush, beyond remarking briefly that they had been victorious in their
attack. Each time I questioned them on the subject they pretended not
to hear or understand, and even Mary Brown answered vaguely to the
effect that she had heard no details.</p>

<p>But when at last its festivities were done and work was resumed
once more, there were two of the labourers missing, and though I was
told when I asked that they had gone on a visit to another tribe I
made guess as to what was wrong; and some time later I found in one
of the huts, lying side by side, two ominous-looking bundles of
paper-bark wrapped tightly with shredded jungle-canes, and knew that
my guess was right.</p>

<h3>SOME VISITORS</h3>

<p>January of the fifth year was a momentous month--it saw the coming
into bearing of one of the palms. I had not expected reproduction so
soon; not till the seventh year was it usual for a planter to have
his eyes gladdened by such a tight. This quick fruiting was extremely
gratifying. It was token of the fructivity of the soil of this place
of mine, and of suitableness of conditions in general for
coconut-growing. It made of the future a thing burthened with
promise. It was definite confounding of those who had believed my
venture sure to fail.</p>

<p>That palm gave me a special delight. It was to me like a child. I
knew it more intimately than I knew any other of the palms, for it
grew nearest of all to the house--indeed, within five yards of
it--and right from the time of its planting it had been daily beneath
my eyes. I had watched every stage of its growth from a raw uncertain
stripling to a buoyantly beautiful adolescent. I had seen the slow
unfolding of every one of its fronds, each longer and wider than the
rest, seen them make their downward curvings till in their numbers
they were an encircling drooping, seen them extend till the lower
ones swept the ground and the higher ones swished my roof. Often in
my wanderings had I seen young palms like this, but never, it seemed
to me, one so beautiful. I took photographs of it, as I might have
taken photographs of something beautiful beyond expression and
strange and new besides. I took portraits of its clustering fruits as
I might have taken portraits of a beloved child. It was more of a
child to me than was Fitzherbert. I had bought Fitzherbert; but I had
made that palm.</p>

<p>From now on my isolation was considerably less extreme. My place
was becoming known, and scarcely a month went by without some
Thursday Island boat or other bringing me at least one visitor. I
enjoyed these visits immensely. I was no longer fully contented with
interest in the things about me. I wanted companionship of my kind,
to talk on subjects entirely unconnected with natives and
agriculture, to hear and discuss the happenings of the outer
world--that is to say, of Thursday Island, which wasn't much of an
outer world, being merely a speck of rock smaller than the area of my
plantation, but to me a Centre of Things. Besides, I liked to play
the host. As a Settled and Respectable Person, as a Planter with an
overseer and a crowd of workmen, it was befitting that I played the
host.</p>

<p>A thing I noticed about my visitors was that each seemed a
remarkably clear-cut personality. They appeared to stand right out of
the community of men as I had known it. There was about them nothing
of the commonplace at all. Yet I knew many of them for most ordinary
individuals, remarkable for nothing in particular--just the everyday
persons one passes in a crowded street and never notices. For a long
time I puzzled over this. Then I understood that while one notices a
crowd without noticing its component individuals, here in the
solitudes one gave to individuals such concentration of attention
that various small and inconsequential characteristics were not only
apparent, but highly magnified and exaggerated.</p>

<p>Some, however, were interesting in their own right. One or two
were famous. There was one whose life-work was the study of the races
of mankind--he was the holder of the Chair of Ethnology at a great
American University--one who in the investigation of material at
first-hand had been in many strange and scarcely accessible places,
and was possessed of a remarkable collection of anecdotes relating to
those places, but, because of the depth of his interest in his work,
could seldom be induced to relate them. He talked folk-lore and
migrations and heads--dolichocephalics, brachycephalics, all kinds of
heads. If ever there was a man alight with fire of enthusiasm it was
he. He was glad of an audience, of someone to whom he could expound
his theories. He stayed with me two months, and there was scarcely a
night in the whole of those-two months when he did not treat me to a
most illuminating dissertation on some phase or other of mankind as
it was, is, or would be. It did not occur to me as strange that far
away there in the wilds I should be listening to the discourse of a
famous scientist. I think I scarcely thought of the famous aspect of
it at all. I knew only I was in the presence of a man wholly in love
with his job.</p>

<p>As for the natives, they didn't know what to make of him at first.
When he began measuring their heads, they were somewhat afraid of
him. When he spoke to them of their legends and mythology, they
thought him unduly curious, and were not a little resentful. Some of
them complained to me, asking what had their heads to do with him, or
the tales they had learned from their fathers. But at length they
accepted him cheerfully enough--for the reason, I discovered, that
Billy Number Five had privately informed them that he was completely
mad. They had a most curious respect for madness and were therefore
content to allow him to do what he wished with them. I would have
liked to tell the Professor this reason of their acquiescence, but
didn't dare. A man so wholly in love with his job was not likely to
appreciate a joke like that.</p>

<p>Another scientific visitor was an ornithologist of worldwide
experience who had been attracted to Cape York by reason of the fact
that not only was it a common resting-place for all manner of birds
in migratory flight, but also the habitat of birds about which
nothing or exceedingly little was known. He was a small, slightly
built man, and so sharp of feature, bright of eye and alert of
movement that the natives christened him the 'Man-Bird', meaning
thereby that so long had he been among birds that he had come to grow
like one--an appellation which the scientist resented not at all, but
regarded rather as a complimentary jest.</p>

<p>As in the case of the ethnologist, the natives knew not what to
make of the bird-man. It puzzled them extremely that he should be at
great pains to obtain birds, not to eat them, but merely to take
their skins. It seemed to them utterly foolish that he should be at
further pains still merely to watch a bird building its nest, or
sitting on it, or feeding its young. It all seemed so wasteful and
purposeless. But his skill as a hunter impressed them exceedingly. In
the matter of stalking a bird he was more expert than they were. He
could move through the jungle more silently than they could. He could
more closely approach his quarry. They could remain motionless for
long periods, but he could remain motionless for longer periods. With
leaves and bushes he could so disguise himself that not even the most
alert bird could distinguish him from a bit of the jungle. His bright
eyes could detect the presence of a bird from an astonishing
distance, and the merest glimpse of even a portion of its body was
sufficient for him to determine its species and sex. The Man-Bird
might be purposeless and wasteful, but of a truth he was a mighty
hunter, said the natives in effect, and more than once made
dance-songs of his skill.</p>

<p>There was a gold-prospector who made my house his headquarters
while he examined the adjacent country for sign of auriferous
deposits--without finding a payable one, however. A prospector of the
tough old school, he was, a man well past middle age, but sinewy and
firm of muscle still; and each morning he would make up for himself a
ration of flour and tea and sugar and a tin of meat, take his
gold-dish and pick, buckle on a revolver, and set forth
alone--sometimes to return with the setting of the sun, sometimes not
to return till the following day, in which case I would be fearful
for his safety, thinking he had been lost in the bush or maybe fallen
foul of a wandering tribe of natives, and consider sending out a
party to search for him. When he returned at such times he would
remark casually that he had come across a likely bit of ground but
had been unable to finish prospecting in that day, so had camped
where he was till morning.</p>

<p>'No good making another tramp away there just to finish a bit of a
job like that,' he would add in explanation.</p>

<p>Sleeping on the ground, entirely without cover of any kind, and in
the midst of a wild and unknown land meant nothing to him at all.</p>

<p>A prospector all his life, he had been literally on dozens of
goldfields. In the whole of Australia there was scarcely one he had
not visited, and there were few in New Guinea and other of the South
Sea Islands where he had not driven his pick. He knew goldfields as
another man might know towns. They were the main features of his
geography. And his speech was so embellished with 'poppets', and
'winzes', and 'shafts', and 'ounces to the ton', and 'fitchering',
and 'stamper-batteries', and other mining terms that the natives
understood him hardly at all, and came to me asking if there were
more kinds of the English language than one.</p>

<p>Financially his career had been a chequered one. For months,
years, at a time he made barely a living, upon occasion having not
even sufficient food, and of tobacco none at all, and hope his only
prospect. Sometimes the hope was quite without satisfaction, and the
lean months would drag on interminably; but sometimes it would be
gloriously justified, and gold would be his in abundance, gold in
handfuls, in tinfuls, gold that he knew not where to put in safety
till he could get it to a buyer or a bank, and which gave him great
anxiety accordingly. A half-dozen times he had been a rich man, and a
score of times one with sufficient to keep him for the rest of his
life.</p>

<p>'But it went,' he said, saying it without appearance of regret,
but as though the spending of a hard-won fortune was inevitable in
the game of life. 'Booze, mostly. And women. What else is there for a
feller to do who comes to city life after gord-knows-how-long in the
bush? You know the old saying: "Easy come, easy go." It's no good
tryin' to go agin them old sayin's.' I wondered where the 'easy come'
came in.</p>

<p>He was fond of talking about his experiences. Unlike the
ethnologist, he was a fountain of anecdote. Of an evening he would
sit with me on the verandah and tell story after story, the while
sucking desultorily at a much-blackened pipe, which more than half
the time was out. Some of the stories were quite non-repeatable,
being concerned with disgraceful amours in his times of riches, or
with similarly disgraceful amours of his friends; but mostly they
concerned happenings experienced in his gold-seeking. One was about
pushing his wheelbarrow, loaded with tools and rations, to a Western
Australian goldfield, he having no means of obtaining a
horse--pushing it for more than three weeks, over two hundred miles
of sand-dune country, where there was seldom a speck of shade, and
all day long a red-hot, semi-tropical sun. Another was about the
tombstone the miners of a small and isolated field obtained from the
nearest town, engraved ready for erection, as a tribute to one of
their number recently dead. On the day of its arrival the stone was
accidentally broken in half and was therefore useless for the purpose
intended; but it was not altogether wasted, for the man who baked for
the camp used it as a floor for his oven; wherefore every loaf of
bread baked in that camp was liable to bear a portion of the
inscription: Sacred to the Memory of William Smith.</p>

<p>Still another was about what he described as the most dreadful
situation in which he had ever been.</p>

<p>'It was at Kalgoorlie--West Australia, y'know,' he said. 'Me and
Big Roberts was mates. Y' mighter heard of Big Roberts? No? Well
known on all the fields. Well, we was doin' well. Down twenty-five
feet and gettin' on to the real good gold; we could see it sticking
out in lumps in certain places. One day we drilled the holes in the
floor of the shaft, and I went to the surface and got the dynamite
charges ready, and sent 'em down to Big in the bucket. He sent up the
tools and charged the holes. I took off the windlass barrel, so's to
save it from the bits of flying rock. We always done that, and the
feller below climbed a ladder we'd built up the side of the shaft.
Well, Big seen that all the fuses was spittin', and goin' strong,
then he started to climb. But when he got about halfway up, a lashing
carried away and the ladder crashed down the shaft, and Big was
thrown backwards down on to the stone floor.</p>

<p>'There he lay, stunned, on top of and between the smoking fuses.
And here was me, shaking like a circus elephant, leaning down looking
at him and unable to do a flamin' thing. I couldn't lower the rope,
because the windlass barrel was unshipped, and there was no one to
help me put it on. A whole lot of wild schemes came into my head--but
not one of 'em was any good. Nice sorter position for a man to be in!
My mate layin' there on top of enough dynamite to blow him up so's
he'd never come down again, and me nothin' to do but look at him, and
at them fuses gettin' shorter and shorter. I never knew till then how
quick a fuse could burn. They was racin'. Racin'. And there was poor
old Big lyin' so peaceful like. I wanted to pray or somethin'. P'raps
I did pray. I dunno.</p>

<p>'Anyway, I got a sorter inspiration. Near by was a bucket of
water. I grabs it and empties it down the shaft, on top of Big's
head. Big groans and sits up slowly, and wipes the water from his
face and looks up and around wondering like. I chucked down my knife.
"Cut the fuses!" I roars. "Cut 'em! Cut 'em! The fuses!" Big's wits
comes back with a rush. He grabs the knife and snips 'em off--quite
cool though, no getting excited, or nothin'. He was just in time--the
shortest was just disappearing down the collar of the hole when Big
got to it. Another two seconds and the fire would have been below the
surface, and then nothing would have stopped the row. I lowers the
rope, and Big comes up hand over hand, and stands and looks at me and
doesn't say nothin', and I looks at him and don't say nothin' either,
like a pair of dummies...He was a good bloke Big.'</p>

<p>Another visitor was an itinerant missionary, young and
considerably inexperienced, but filled with a great and abiding
optimism for the success of his work, who spent several evenings with
my tribe in their camp, telling them that their heathenish ways were
the ways of error, and instructing them in the rudiments of the white
man's religious belief. But it seemed to me that in this instance at
least his optimism was not particularly well founded, for after he
had gone the natives told me they had no intention of departing from
their old and original ways, and said, further, that they doubted
whether what he had told them was altogether true, the story of the
creation of Eve being particularly hard to believe, it being clearly
impossible, they said, to make a woman from the rib of a man, to say
nothing of the fact that the legends which had been handed down from
their fathers and their fathers' fathers right back to the beginning
of things there was no mention of such an occurrence. I looked
forward to the return of that missionary with considerable interest,
for it appeared that a full-dress debate would be staged on this and
other matters. But the itinerary which involved a visit to Cape York
was abandoned soon after his departure, and he never returned.</p>

<p>Sometimes soldiers from the garrison at Thursday Island would come
over on furlough--come in a chartered cutter, in a sea-going
motor-boat, in any available craft, a score or more of them at a
time, all good fellows and gay, bringing with them abundance of drink
and good foods, and for a space of maybe a fortnight so filling my
solitude with sound of European speech and with companionship and
merriment that when at length they departed it seemed to me that life
had been emptied of its joys and desolation remained in their stead.
There was nothing so forlorn, I thought, as a one-man dwelling
suddenly deprived of its guests. At such times it came to me that I
was more gregarious than I had thought.</p>

<p>Upon occasion various persons who cruised the coast in small craft
would anchor off my beach and come ashore for a 'yarn'. Most of them
were coloured men, trepangers--Japanese, Indians, Cingalese, Kanaka
half-castes--and it was the habit of each to bring me a present of
fish, or a piece of a turtle or a dugong he had caught, and squat on
my verandah steps and tell of what boats he had seen and passed, and
relate various happenings of which he had heard--such as that Jimmy
the Dog was working the shore-reef at Night Island for trepang and
doing well; that Cingalese Sammy's cutter was ashore on a sandbank
near the Cook Passage in the Barrier Reef; that old Bill Johnson had
been attacked by natives as he lay at anchor at Breakfast Creek and
shot two of them, and that the police-boat was on her way there to
inquire into the affair. After which I would relate what news I had
heard from the men of similarly calling boats, and present him with a
bunch of bananas, or some sweet-potatoes; and after a somewhat
desultory talk he would go to the camp to gossip a while with the
natives before boarding his craft and setting forth once more on his
farming of the products of the sea.</p>

<p>The visit of one of these men--a somewhat stupid halfcaste--ended
in disaster. Being a stranger to the place, he anchored his cutter in
the wrong spot, right over a bed of strongly growing coral, which so
fouled the anchor that when he tried to heave it, it could not be
moved. After various unsuccessful efforts, including the sending down
of a naked native diver, he came ashore and appealed to me. I gave
him a half-dozen plugs of dynamite and a fuse, told him to take one
of the cane rings which held the sail to the mast, affix the dynamite
to it, place it round the chain, which was straight up and down,
light the fuse and let the affair go, the idea being that the ring,
carrying the charge, would slide down the chain, explode on the
bottom and thereby destroy the obstructing coral. The half-caste
thanked me and returned to his craft; and I watched from the verandah
to see how the idea would work. Presently, there came an excited
shouting, and cries of fear and consternation, and a general rushing
back from the cutter's bows, and a jumping overboard of all hands;
then there was the crackling crash of a surface explosion, and the
cutter staggered and began to dip by the head and go down; and soon
afterwards the half-caste, dripping wet, was standing on my verandah
and more or less incoherently informing me he had not thought to
attach a weight wherewith to sink the dynamite, wherefore the
explosion had happened on the surface and blown the cutter's bow in.
With the assistance of my tribe, the cutter was lifted from her place
on the bottom, and repaired sufficiently to allow the half-caste to
take her back to Thursday Island. He seemed reluctant about going,
however. I think he thought the explosion a remarkably mild affair to
the one which would happen when he told the whole story to his
owners.</p>

<p>Another of these men who in small craft sailed the coast was a
European who spent all his spare time writing plays. He was a big,
muscular individual, burned by the sun and wind to the colour of an
old penny, fifty years of age maybe, with a face so curiously thin
that it seemed not to belong to him at all, but to some other person.
Sitting on my verandah one still evening, he told me how he had come
to take up play-writing. The hobby had been engendered by visits to
theatres during his last sojourn in civilization, some fifteen years
before. It seemed so easy to write a play, he said. There was nothing
in it at all. As he had sat in the theatre he felt he could write a
better one than he was watching, without any trouble. And he would
have stayed there in civilization and done it, too, only that he had
no means of sustenance in the meantime, his bit of money being almost
done, and there were no jobs offering that he could see. Besides, he
wasn't cut out for city life. Been too long in these far-away parts,
knocking round in small boats and so forth. He had felt there was
nothing to prevent a man writing plays here. Nothing at all. He had
plenty of time. A man in a small craft always had plenty of time.
He'd written any number of plays. He'd written them for fifteen
years. But so far he'd had no luck with them, though he'd sent them
all over the place. There was scarcely a manager he hadn't sent one
to at some time or another. It was hard to understand these managers.
They were good plays. A damn' sight better than most of the rubbish
that was staged. He'd read me a bit of one if I liked.</p>

<p>And he took from his pocket a number of sheets of paper covered
with small, neat writing, stood directly beneath one of the gas-jets,
and began. It was a remarkable performance. Away there in the wilds,
in an environment of jungle and palm-trees and sea, I was treated to
as good an exhibition of semblanced emotions as ever I had witnessed
in a theatre, or have witnessed since. He had an astounding facility
for the expressing of passion, for giving subtlety to an aside, for
heroic declamation. Very soon he threw down the papers and continued
from memory. His modulations of tone were perfect. His characters
were real characters, the conflict was a real conflict, everything
was vivid, true. That he was handicapped by having to play each of
the parts himself, change from character to character, meant nothing.
His thin face was transformed exactly at the right moment.</p>

<p>I thought it a wonderful play, and said so enthusiastically, and
picked up the MS. that I might read it for myself. And then I
received a disappointment. On paper, the play was a wholly incredible
thing--and almost incoherent. That man was not a playwright at all,
but an actor, and the only one in the world who could have acted that
play.</p>

<p>Another visitor was a youth, of twenty or less, who was
adventuring his way round the world, journeying from job to job,
staying long enough in one place to earn his fare to some other
place, a bright-spirited young Englishman who revelled in life and
the constant change which is the essence of life, delightfully
improvident, thoroughly satisfied with the present, and carelessly
regarding the future as a reservoir of pleasures to come.</p>

<p>And this despite the fact that he was 'up against it', as he put
it. He hadn't been able to obtain a situation of any kind whatever in
Thursday Island, and hearing of my plantation and thinking maybe I
might employ him, he had spent his last pound on a passage across. He
didn't know what would happen to him, he replied when I asked what he
would do if I didn't employ him. He wasn't worrying about it.
Something would turn up. Something always did.</p>

<p>I had no particular need for another white man on the plantation,
but I employed him for long enough to allow him to earn his fare to
Thursday Island and across to New Guinea, from where he intended to
work his way through Java and Timor and Malaya. It was not a matter
of philanthropy. It was one of selfishness. For that young man was
very much the kind of young man I used to be, and listening to his
account of his varied wanderings recalled vividly my own wanderings
and part-forgotten happenings, stirred memories of things which once
had thrilled me, and in recalling them thrilled me once again. The
hearing of his adventures gave me a curiously ecstatic pleasure--and
a somewhat eerie one besides. It was as though I were listening to
someone telling me the story of my life. And when at length he
departed, I thought a deal of where he might be, and pictured him
sailing the New Guinea coast, and mingling with the crowded humanity
of some Javanese seaport, and landing on a beach in Timor, and seeing
some grand landscape from an inland Malayan hill, pictured him in all
manner of places and adventures--and envied him.</p>

<p>Another visitor was a pearler friend who would come ashore for no
particular reason, and stay ashore for three or four days, a week
maybe, doing nothing save sitting on my verandah and reading novels,
and his crew doing less, he having mixed so long with natives that he
had become as casual as they and as regardless of the passing of
time. Such idling would have made another man bankrupt long before,
but this man flourished exceedingly, for the god of good fortune
attended him always on his attacks of the pearling-beds, and he
obtained more shells and pearls than did any of the others. A luck
that seldom attends the idler was his, and it was his firm belief
that nothing came of 'busting yerself', as he put it.</p>

<p>I had a call from some well-to-do people travelling the Coral Sea
in a steamer they had chartered on a kind of Letters of Marque,
people who in wide, free wandering of the wild sought relaxation from
the stress of civilized life, and fell in love with the wildness and
the freedom, and declared my existence an ideal existence, and my
place and its environs wholly delightful and enviable, and I a person
exceedingly fortunate in being able to live the kind of life they
would willingly live if they could--all of which showed that besides
finding the relaxation they sought, they had had awakened in them for
the time the primitive instinct which slumbers in most men, no matter
how civilized they may be.</p>

<p>The visit of these people was of great interest to my natives, for
among them were three women, and the sight of European women was to
them the rarest thing imaginable. Wherever those women went there was
a group of natives near by, staring at them wonderingly, whispering
comments on the fact that their manner of dress concealed their
bodies almost entirely, and on the fact that their hair was
fair--this a feature of more interest than any of the others--and
remarking on the whiteness of their skins and the smallness of their
feet. At first the white women were eager to make friends with the
native women and talk with them, but these advances very soon
discontinued, for the native women, in order to show their deep
interest in friendliness, reciprocated by asking all manner of
exceedingly intimate questions, taking no heed whatever that I, or
some other white man, was present.</p>

<p>Another vessel that called in was a Chinese junk bound originally
from Hong Kong to San Francisco to form an exhibit in an exposition
there, but because of the persistence of bad weather and adverse
winds, and because of the fact that the rig of the cumbersome craft
was such that little or no progress could be made against the wind,
was blown many hundreds of miles out of her course, sent on a
chartless driving southwards down the Pacific, week after week, till
at length it came to the North Australian coast, miraculously escaped
the dangers of the Barrier Reef, and finally came to anchor off my
house.</p>

<p>On board were five people--a white man, his Chinese wife and three
adult Eurasian sons--all of them emaciated from privation and general
hardship, and the woman ill besides. Their only food for weeks, they
told me, was a fish or two they managed to catch, and for the last
few days the menace of thirst had confronted them, for until they
sighted my house they had been too afraid of hostility from natives,
whose smokes they had seen continually, to go ashore and search for a
stream.</p>

<p>I relieved their necessity as best I could and tended the woman to
recovery--a circumstance due mainly to the strength of her
constitution, my ignorance of medicine being enormous--and in due
course they went to Thursday Island, where the junk was sold and the
people who had so perilously voyaged in her took steamer back to Hong
Kong. I thought that was the end of them so far as I was concerned.
But it wasn't, for I have ever since received at irregular intervals
a postcard bearing from the man a message of greeting and
remembrance, with at the bottom a scrawl by his wife in the Chinese
character, which, I'm told, is expression of affection and
regard.</p>

<p>I had a visit from a writer-man--a world-touring American
journalist, who in due course published in various English and United
States papers articles descriptive of my life in the wilds, my
plantation, and myself--the last in such complimentary terms that,
reading them, I was amazed to discover what a remarkable young person
I was--and as a result of this publicity all manner of persons wrote
me from all manner of places, and in a vein which showed that the age
of adventure was far from being dead.</p>

<p>I had a letter from a man at Toronto, Canada, stating that he was
'tired to death of cold countries, and longed for the sun', and
asking would I mind 'arranging with the natives for a bit of land'. A
youth at Boston declared his intention of coming to my part of the
world as soon as he was of age and therefore could ignore the
opposition of his parents, and querying hopefully if the natives were
really dangerous. A Portland hotel-clerk asked if I needed a
book-keeper, and stated that if I didn't, he would be willing to
serve in any capacity whatever--'the wild-man life is the life for
me', he said in a paraphrase--and a gentleman of the same town told
me I was foolish to take such risks with my life by living in such a
remote and unsettled spot. A pious lady informed me she was
considerably grieved to note that in all she had read about me, there
was no mention of my attending to the 'soul-welfare of the dear
natives'.</p>

<p>From Yorkshire, England, I had a conjoint letter from a young man
and his wife asking would I mind giving full details regarding
coconut-growing in my part of the world, and if they could obtain
some land with a 'beach like yours, and near by a green hill with a
stream at its foot'. From Edinburgh came a photograph of a lassie in
a kilt--'perhaps looking at me on those long, quiet nights will cheer
you', was inscribed on the back. A shop-girl at Leeds offered to send
a photograph and to enter into a regular correspondence. A lady
school-teacher in London wrote that she 'thought it so romantic that
a young man should be living alone among the wild savages of North
Australia', and sent me a copy of the school magazine--why, I don't
know. A young Londoner who confessed to being a hairdresser and
thoroughly tired of it, asked if it were at all possible I could
employ him--'I would cook, or scrub floors, or anything', he wrote,
adding, 'I find it costs a good deal to get out to you, but if you
would advance the fare, you could take it out of my wages', and
adding further that he had never been ill in his life, 'except for a
bit of a cough I've got', that he was five feet four in height, 'but
fairly broad'.</p>

<p>And there were the kindly members of a Chicago Society for the
Dissemination of Literature who sent me a piano-case filled with
books of all kinds, and a long letter in which it was hoped the books
would be a treasure and delight to me, that they would do something
towards materially relieving 'your great and lonely solitude'.</p>

<p>I appreciated those books immensely. So many of them were there
that my large room was transformed into a library. Indeed, no gift
could have been more to my liking, and for the kindly members of that
society I have entertained ever since a warm and profound
affection.</p>

<p>But 'lonely solitude'! If only they had known how crowded was my
solitude!</p>

<h2><a name="ch10"></a>Chapter Ten</h2>

<h3>THE WILDING THAT WAS ME</h3>

<p>At the end of the eighth year it came to me I should take a
holiday--nothing extensive or of any great duration, just a week or
two's jaunt somewhere, just a week or two's freedom from the cares
and routine of the agricultural life. The plantation was now a
thoroughly accomplished fact. Where once had been only the purple
tangle of a jungle was now the green of palms in ordered array--palms
of fronds, palms so opulent in their fructivity that the grey of the
soil about their bases was dotted always with the brown of ripened,
fallen nuts. I felt I deserved a holiday. I had done what I had set
out to do.</p>

<p>So it was that in due course I appointed Billy Number Five manager
in my stead, bade gay farewell to the natives--and received sorrowful
farewell in return, particularly from Mary Brown and
Fitzherbert--sailed in a visiting lugger to Thursday Island and there
took a passage in a steamer across the Gulf of Carpentaria's wide
mouth to Port Darwin--the capital of the Northern Territory of
Australia.</p>

<p>I chose Port Darwin as the scene of my holiday partly because it
was conveniently near, being distant only a three days' sail, and
partly because it was a place to which I had never been, mainly
because it was something as strange in the way of tropical places as
was Cape York without its coconut palms. For Port Darwin was a
tropical place where white men predominated, where white men
performed almost the whole of the manual tasks, where white men had
taken it upon themselves to prove that they were as well suited as
black men to lands of Equatorial suns. In various tropics I had seen
white men at manual labouring--miners in New Guinea, some impecunious
beachcombers in Java helping natives with the building of a stone
wall of a canal. But these instances were so few that sociologically
they meant nothing at all. In the sugar-country of Queensland white
men had lived and worked thus for a generation or more; but that
sugar country was not so tropical as Port Darwin. The experiment at
Port Darwin was the first real experiment of a whole community of
whites living and working in a real tropics; and I was interested to
discover how it was shaping. As a Man with a Stake in the Country, it
was natural I should be interested in such things.</p>

<p>But before I reached Port Darwin this interest faded. A feeling
came to me that I would like to journey on to a little farther than I
had intended. The steamer in which I travelled was a China steamer,
with a Chinese name and a Chinese crew and a number of Chinese
passengers who squatted on the for'rd deck and played fantan, and
sucked great bamboo pipes and ate fish and rice from dexterously
manipulated chop-sticks. In my wilding days I had seen in China
innumerable scenes like that, and desire to see them there again was
mine. Further, among the European passengers were men who knew people
I knew at Hong Kong and Shanghai and Honan, and we spoke much about
them; and I thought how fine it would be to be with those friends
again, and that it would give me great pleasure indeed once more to
be aboard a wandering cargo-steamer threading the sampan traffic of
the Shanghai River going nowhere in particular and returning when I
wished; and I recalled with a thrill that Hong Kong was but ten days
from Port Darwin; and only with an effort told myself I must put such
thoughts ruthlessly from me, that I had long ago shed desire for
irresponsible wandering, that I was a Settled and Respectable Person,
a Planter, and a Man of Affairs.</p>

<p>We came into harbour with the first of a dawn odorous of jungles
and beaches, and at sunrise made fast to a jutting wharf at the foot
of a town such as never had I seen before. Port Darwin stood on a
plateau, eighty or more feet high--a steep plateau draped with the
green and purple of a riot of indigenous flora, with way of access a
series of winding steps cut deep in the plateau's wall--steps edged
by flowering trees and coloured shrubs and hibiscuses red like
blood--and houses stood about the edge of that great height--small,
straggling houses perched precariously like daring impatient
children; and groups of larger houses which stood back a little and
looked down upon the harbour and the ships, politely curious; and
houses which stared dully in rows, their windows like strangely
expressionless eyes. As I went ashore and mounted the foliaged ladder
of stone which gave access to a town, I felt as though those houses
had come forth to watch me and wonder at the reason of my coming.</p>

<p>Port Darwin was not much of a town as towns go, being a straggling
kind of place, with streets which wandered untidily nowhere in
particular, save to somewhere in the bush, with four or five hotels
of sorts, a scattering of shops, a thoroughly insanitary Chinese
quarter, and an undue number of dwellings built of that most
unsuitable material for tropical houses--corrugated galvanized iron.
But I enjoyed my first sight of it immensely. It was a place where
congregated far more people of my own skin than I had seen for eight
full years. It was to me a place of great busyness, of comings and
goings extraordinary; there were motorcars, and even railway trains.
It was a place filled with civilized sights and sounds which to me
had for so long been only memories.</p>

<p>I thought I could stay there indefinitely. I thought it would be
long indeed before my interest was exhausted. There was the matter of
how this settling a tropical land with whites was progressing. There
were planters to visit and talk to on subjects like fruiting-times,
the advantages of red loam as compared with black mould, the uses and
abuses of fertilizers. There were new people to be met each day, new
sights to see, new things to hear.</p>

<p>But I tired of it in a week. By that time I had lost all desire to
talk fertilizers and loam, and the new people were new no longer, and
the new sights stale, while as for the experiment of white settlement
I noted that the people seemed remarkably healthy and the children
among the finest I had seen, and let it go at that. Port Darwin was
right enough in its way; but I had had enough of it. I wanted some
other place--any place. Desire was once more upon me to wander in
many places.</p>

<p>In this mood I received invitation to accompany some of my new
friends in a small auxiliary craft a hundred and fifty miles or so
down the coast of Arnhem Land--that is to say, the great unknown land
which forms the western shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria. It would be
a leisurely wandering from place to place, they said, anchoring every
day or two, staying ashore an hour, a day, a week, any old time at
all.</p>

<p>I promptly accepted. A wandering like this was just what I craved.
It reminded me of my Odyssey of New Guinea, the Solomons, Torres
Strait, of the days when I was in turn trader, gold-seeker, pearler,
recruiter of plantation labourers, of the times that were mine before
the urge came upon me to settle awhile. It would do me good to drift
about for a week or two. All the good in the world. It would make me
all the gladder to return to being a Settled and Respectable Person,
make me absolutely contented with the agriculturist's life.</p>

<p>We left on a day as clear and sparkling and lovely as a gem--some
wondrous cosmic gem--a day which ended with a sunset even more lovely
still. It was an evening filled with daintiness and small
prettinesses, with little aimless breezes which gave to the sea a
quick irregular crinkling; and in the north was a scattering of white
and lazy clouds, and in the west an arch of subtle blue through which
the sun went down and down and down, clean-edged like a plate. But
just as the rim of it touched the clear-cut line of the water, the
lazy clouds lost their laziness and came hurrying--small clouds and
large clouds, clouds thin like hints of smoke, clouds that were as
great rolls of superfluous fat, clouds that moved with dignity,
clouds that went gaily like urchins; and as they reached the place of
the departed sun, they stayed there and joined one to another and
formed into grottoes and castles and wide fields; and the whiteness
of them gave place to reds like the reds of oranges and yellows like
the yellows of new gold; and the quick crinkling of the sea was a
wideness of little lapping flames. Then the grottoes and castles and
wide fields mingled and made of the west a mighty golden gateway
banked with bronze; and through the gateway showed the spires and
turrets of a city built of precious stones, and beyond the city a
plain of silver. And there for a space of minutes the gateway and the
city stood, all lit with rare, slow lights, and the brightness of the
silver plain growing to the brightness of glass. Then the new gold
dulled to old gold and the reds to paling pinks, and the city and its
plain became no more, and the mighty gateway crumbled and its banking
of bronze dissolved, and the grey of the night crept up. The pageant
of the sky was done. But I saw still that gateway and that city and
that plain, and was filled with a surge of emotion and the pull of a
strange unrest, and for long just stood there, staring; and one of my
friends said quietly: 'It was the gateway to Kingdom Come.'</p>

<p>That journey was much like journeys I had made in my wilding days.
It overflowed with variety. Never were there a few hours the same as
any other few hours. In the morning we would sail passages where
tides raced like flooded rivers, and in the afternoon lie along
winding beaches where crocodiles we had thought were bits of
driftwood went clumsily to the water at sound of our engine's beat.
One midday we would be standing up to the bluster of head-seas which
swept us end to end, and the next making a wide and oily wake up a
river smooth as glass. One night we would lie at anchor in a harbour
so steeply deep that the vessel sat upright against the shore as it
might have sat upright against a wharf, and the next night perhaps
stick on a seaward sandbank and have to get out and push.</p>

<p>We were gloriously and delightfully indolent, and none was more
indolent than I was, for in the busyness of my life as a planter I
had forgotten that indolence had its completely satisfying joys, and
the re-discovering of those joys thrilled me through. Never did we do
anything if we could help it, and sometimes didn't do it even then.
Never were we clad other than in pyjamas, or in singlets and shorts;
never did we desire to be otherwise dad. At night as we sailed along
we lay about the deck and 'yarned' about anything and everything,
from horse-racing and war to books and women, while the skipper
ambidextrously steered with one hand and with tie other balanced a
pannikin of rum, and, in his turn, told tales of wild happenings in
the great unknown land whose coast we sailed; and later we would lie
part-awake, listening to the look-out native chanting some camp-fire
ditty and thereby letting the skipper know he was not asleep, but
keeping diligent watch.</p>

<p>We were perfectly irresponsible. Time, distance, and place meant
to us nothing. We went anywhere we wished to go. Sometimes we went
ashore for a half-day and shot wild pigs and ducks and pigeons and
turkeys and other game. Sometimes we drag-netted a beach for fish.
The sea was burdened with fish; at one place we gathered in a single
haul more than half a ton--and had a three-days' task repairing the
net. Sometimes we spent a morning gathering oysters, which were as
plentiful as the fish; indeed, I had never seen a place so abundant
with them; at certain places the low tides uncovered them by the
acre.</p>

<p>Natives were scarce; but whenever we saw a camp-fire in an
accessible spot we anchored and went ashore to it. The people were a
wild and savage lot--as wild and savage as were my tribe at Cape York
when I first went there. But there was about their savagery a curious
touch of civilization, for Malays from Macassar and from Java had for
centuries come here in their praus in search of sandalwood and cedar
and cypress and trepang and pearl-shell, coming at the end of one
trade-wind season and returning with the beginning of the next,
thereby having a favouring wind each way--a matter of great
importance to a craft so ill suited to headwinds as a prau.</p>

<p>Each year they came, whole fleets of them, and each time they
stayed for several months, employing the natives when they could,
mingling with them, using their women, by virtue of association
instilling into them something of the civilization which was
theirs--which, though by no means an advanced civilization, was
nevertheless thousands of years ahead of the natives' mode of
existence.</p>

<p>So it was that these natives as I found them were often
semi-Oriental of feature, and were possessed of hair long and
straight instead of short and crinkly, and had in the dull blackness
of their skins a queer hint of yellow, and in their language and
place names Malayan words. Further, many had learned to smoke opium
and to love it to such an extent that they besought us for it upon
every occasion, and only with an air of dissatisfaction took tobacco
instead.</p>

<p>They told stories of these Malays and their doings--dreadful
stories, most of them; there were stories of orgies in which liquor
and native girls were prominent features, and stories of women stolen
and taken to Java or Macassar, never to return, and stories of the
warriors of the tribes to whom the women belonged avenging themselves
on the stealers when they came again the next year--one such avenging
resulted in the slaying and mutilating of a prau's whole crew with a
savagery apparently wholly unnecessary, and the account of it was
given to me by a man who had taken a principal part in the raid. I
have never seen the eyes of a man so resemble the eyes of a wild
beast as did the eyes of that man as he related the details of the
surprising of the prau. Nor have I heard anything so realistically
horrible as his imitating of the cries of the Malays, and his slow
intaking of breath to indicate the passage of a spear through human
flesh, and the curious, grinding noise he made with his teeth in the
semblancing of bones grinding beneath club-blows viciously
repeated.</p>

<p>The difference between these people and the Cape York people
interested me immensely. I had not expected to find such differences
of habit and custom among members of the same race. So long had I
been accustomed to one tribe, or set of tribes, that I had come to
thinking all other tribes must be as they. Eight years' residence in
one place had made me parochial, had made my outlook something
resembling that of the man from whom living all his life in a small
and unimportant town judges the rest of the world by the standards of
that same small and unimportant town. My discovery of this unsettled
me still further, and I asked myself that if in eight years I could
become so parochial, what dreadful kind of person would I be in
sixteen years, or twenty-four years. Thought of living away there in
the wilds of Cape York for all that time appalled me.</p>

<p>The dancing of these natives was not at all like that of the Cape
York natives. Instead of being about nothing in particular, and more
or less impromptu, it was imitative of the prancing of birds, or of
fights between animals. One I saw was representation of a battle
between two reptiles--iguanas.</p>

<p>It was on a coastal island a fortnight's sail from Port Darwin--a
large island with a fragment of beach and the rest of its littoral
mud and mangroves and oyster-beds--and at the time of our coming
there was on the fragment of beach no one at all. But presently from
the two-miles-distant mainland came numbers of bark canoes
considerably overladen, and we were surrounded by a mostly-nude crowd
who said in their curiously part-Malayan tongue that they had seen
our sail and come to know if we had any opium, and that if we had
they would give on the beach that night a dance. They exhibited the
usual dissatisfaction when we gave them tobacco instead, and gave us
to understand that they didn't believe we had no opium, and hung
around hoping we would produce some at length, and finally announced
that they would give the dance anyway, and if afterwards we cared to
give them some of the drug--well, we could, and that in any case some
tobacco and flour would be acceptable.</p>

<p>The setting and general circumstances of the dance were similar to
many others I had seen; there were the usual circle of illuminating
fires, the drum-like chanting of the men, the usual falsetto
screeching of the women. But in point of strenuousness and general
agility it stood alone. In the centre of the ring of fires some
two-score men, their faces and bodies smudged with red and yellow
clay, formed a circle, in the midst of which stood the two principals
of the dance; men bigger than the rest they were, tall, big-muscled,
their bearing the bearing of athletes; and for a time there was a
general chattering and disordered movement. Then suddenly an
extremely disreputable old person squatted on the ground in a
prominent position, raised to his lips a long bamboo tube and,
blowing, produced a short, drum-like note, and the chattering gave
place to an abrupt silence, and the members of the painted circle
stopped, hands on knees, and the two principals similarly painted
knelt facing each other, their tongues out in imitation, I was told,
of an iguana in a temper, and two fingers of each hand raised upright
to represent claws.</p>

<p>Then the disreputable old person blew another short note, and
began a series of jerky and exceedingly discordant sounds; and the
onlookers beat their hands against their sides and chorused a
resonant chant; and the imitation iguanas began their fighting,
charging one another at full speed, missing by narrow margins,
wheeling, flanking, leaping backward with astonishing agility,
feinting, prancing, hissing, shouting and screaming, dementedly
locking one another in their arms, rolling in an entwined mass of
struggling limbs, continuing it for an hour or more, never once
pausing for breath, the fact that all this strenuousness was
performed in the kneeling position in soft loose sand being no
apparent hindrance, and all of it strangely rhythmical besides. Then,
as suddenly as it had begun, it stopped, and the singers and the old
person with the tube came and begged tobacco, and one of the dancers
explained to us at considerable length that the dance would have
continued much longer, only that the clay on the dancers' faces had
become mingled with perspiration and formed a sticky mess which
obscured their sight. So far as I could understand it, the dance
ended in a draw.</p>

<p>Day after day we made our wandering way, seeing nothing of ships,
meeting no one save natives--and then but rarely--with on one side
always the wide emptiness of the sea, and on the other the green and
brown spread of the land, and ahead an island, or a jutting-point, or
a river-mouth, where we might anchor, or might not anchor, just as we
were inclined, but where for sure there would be change of scene and
circumstance. Never did we know what we might find. Once, for
instance, we sailed into a perfectly sheltered harbour, which our
chart of sorts said was called Port Essington, and found on its shore
the ruins of an old-time attempt to settle with whites this wild and
savage land--the ruins of a town called Victoria, which more than
eighty years before had been built by soldiers and convicts from Van
Diemen's Land, and after ten years abandoned.</p>

<p>The ruins were mostly those of stone and brick dwellings and
fortifications and a prison, the bricks having been made on the spot,
and the stone quarried from a hillside close by; and the whole of it
was example of how Nature can recover its own, for among the rows of
broken chimneys were tall trees and jungle growth, and what once were
streets were now the standing-places of masses of indigenous foliage.
A little while before our coming, a native, needing bark for a hut,
had stripped some trees growing between the roofless walls of what
once had been the drawing-room of Government House!</p>

<p>In a hollow back from the town a little we found the burying-place
of some of these high-spirited adventurers who gave their lives to
this attempt to create a white-man settlement in this terra incognita
of a tropics. Their graves were covered with weeds and bushes and
their deeds forgotten long since. But their names were more or less
perpetuated on the tombstones. As the inscriptions were becoming
indecipherable, Authority, some ten years before our visit, sent
someone to reinscribe them--someone illiterate, I take it, as the
misspellings of these examples show:</p>

<i>Visitors are requested not to look for relices.</i>
</pre>

<p>Visitors!--and we the first to call at that place since those
words were inscribed ten years before!</p>

<p>I gloried in the freedom of those days, in the lack of routine, in
the indefiniteness of our daily destinations, and in the fact that I
was always going somewhere and that when I came to a place I was not
bound to remain in it for long; and all the while it seemed to me
stranger and stranger that I should have been content to remain in
one place through eight full years. I wondered how on earth I could
have done it.</p>

<p>'You must have got tired of it at times,' remarked the vessel's
skipper, who was an adventurer such as I had been; and from his tone
I gathered he thought me a very queer person indeed. 'It wouldn't
have done me! I don't reckon I would have been able to stand
it--stuck away there by myself!'</p>

<p>As the vessel headed back for Port Darwin, I was given much to
wondering whether I would be able to 'stand it' again. That life on
the plantation, once so delightful and satisfying, was delightful and
satisfying no longer. The instinct of the wilding which I had told
myself was dead, had but drowsed, and now was thoroughly awake. I was
tired of being a Settled and Respectable Person. Thought of seeing
the same scenes and people day after day, for months, years, many
years, appalled me. I couldn't face a future like that. There was
about it too much monotony and immobility, to say nothing of
responsibility. I wanted frequent change, and mobility, and
irresponsibleness. I wanted to be a wanderer again, an adventurer in
many places, instead of in one place. The urge to settle had been
satisfied and now was utterly dead.</p>

<p>At Darwin a Japanese steamer lay at the wharf. The mud of Java was
on her anchors, and men of Nippon walked her deck. I would have liked
to take passage in her, to go with her whither she was bound--it
didn't matter where. I had sufficient money. But I couldn't go. There
was the plantation. Already I was past my time for returning. Things
at the plantation would be all upside-down if I didn't return at
once. I met some cattle-drovers about to set out for Boorooloola. I
could have gone with them. This place with all the o's in its name
was said to be the most out-back town in Australia and one of the
smallest in the world, as it consisted only of an hotel and a store.
There would be all manner of adventures on the way. But I couldn't
go. There was the plantation. There was always the plantation, and on
present appearances there would always <i>be</i> the plantation.</p>

<p>I damned the plantation, telling myself I had been a fool to
hamper myself with a thing like that, and that a man's possessions
were nothing more than restrictions upon his liberty of action.
Besides, I was no agriculturist, no earthbound son of the soil. My
desire to plant things and see them grow was but a transient phase. I
was a roamer, and nothing but a roamer.</p>

<p>In this condition of mind I returned to Thursday Island and
crossed the Strait to Cape York and to my old familiar scenes--and
received such welcome from the tribe and Mary Brown and Fitzherbert
and Billy Number Five as to cause me to wonder how I could leave them
for ever, should opportunity arise. I looked at the tree which bore
my initials and the date of my coming to the solitudes, and thought
of the exulting which was mine when I cut those letters and figures.
I looked at the buoyant palm which was the first to fruit, the palm
which had been to me more a child that was Fitzherbert, and I looked
at the other palms, the thousands of them, and thrilled to the
knowledge that I was the agent of their being. Never, I thought,
would I find it in me to abandon all this. This place I had made and
its associations were too personal, too much a part of the thing that
was me. To give it all up would be like giving up a part of
myself.</p>

<p>But when, some time later, a good price was offered me for my
share in it all, I was far from being so sure. A confusion of desire
was mine, and a confusion of thought. I saw myself journeying to the
places to which I would journey were I free of the restriction of
possessions. I saw myself happy and content down the years in this
place of mine. I wanted to go, and I wanted to stay, and knew not
which to do. To the offer I made an indeterminate reply. The price
was increased.</p>

<p>And then the wanderlust welled up in me, strongly, insistently,
and grew to a tidal wave which drowned all other thought, flooded all
other desire, washed clear away the dead debris of the urge which had
caused me to settle at all. The wilding that was ME would not be
denied. I accepted the price--and set forth on my wanderings once
more.</p>
