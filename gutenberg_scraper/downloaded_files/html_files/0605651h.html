<BR>

  <p class="first">WHEN the student of medicine, Richard Bracquemont, decided
  to move into room No. 7 of the small Hotel Stevens, Rue Alfred Stevens (Paris
  6), three persons had already hanged themselves from the cross-bar of the
  window in that room on three successive Fridays.</p>

  <p>The first was a Swiss traveling salesman. They found his corpse on
  Saturday evening. The doctor determined that the death must have occurred
  between five and six o'clock on Friday afternoon. The corpse hung on a strong
  hook that had been driven into the window's cross-bar to serve as a hanger
  for articles of clothing. The window was closed, and the dead man had used
  the curtain cord as a noose. Since the window was very low, he hung with his
  knees practically touching the floor&mdash;a sign of the great discipline the
  suicide must have exercised in carrying out his design. Later, it was learned
  that he was a married man, a father. He had been a man of a continually happy
  disposition; a man who had achieved a secure place in life. There was not one
  written word to be found that would have shed light on his suicide... not
  even a will.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, none of his acquaintances could recall hearing anything at
  all from him that would have permitted anyone to predict his end.</p>

  <p><br>
  The second case was not much different. The artist, Karl Krause, a high-wire
  cyclist in the nearby Medrano Circus, moved into room No. 7 two days later.
  When he did not show up at Friday's performance, the director sent an
  employee to the hotel. There, he found Krause in the unlocked room hanging
  from the window cross-bar in circumstances exactly like those of the previous
  suicide. This death was as perplexing as the first. Krause was popular. He
  earned a very high salary, and had appeared to enjoy life at its fullest.
  Once again, there was no suicide note; no sinister hints. Krause's sole
  survivor was his mother to whom the son had regularly sent 300 marks on the
  first of the month.</p>

  <p><br>
  For Madame Dubonnet, the owner of the small, cheap guest-house whose
  clientele was composed almost completely of employees in a nearby Montmartre
  vaudeville theater, this second curious death in the same room had very
  unpleasant consequences. Already several of her guests had moved out, and
  other regular clients had not come back. She appealed for help to her
  personal friend, the inspector of police of the Ninth Precinct, who assured
  her that he would do everything in his power to help her. He pushed zealously
  ahead not only with the investigation into the grounds for the suicides of
  the two guests, but he also placed an officer in the mysterious room.</p>

  <p>This man, Charles-Maria Chaumié, actually volunteered for the task.
  Chaumié was an old "Marsouin," a marine sergeant with eleven years of
  service, who had lain so many nights at posts in Tonkin and Annam, and had
  greeted so many stealthily creeping river pirates with a shot from his rifle
  that he seemed ideally suited to encounter the "ghost" that everyone on Rue
  Alfred Stevens was talking about.</p>

  <p>From then on, each morning and each evening, Chaumié paid a brief visit to
  the police station to make his report, which, for the first few days,
  consisted only of his statement that he had not noticed anything unusual. On
  Wednesday evening, however, he hinted that he had found a clue.</p>

  <p>Pressed to say more, he asked to be allowed more time before making any
  comment, since he was not sure that what he had discovered had any
  relationship to the two deaths, and he was afraid he might say something that
  would make him look foolish.</p>

  <p><br>
  On Thursday, his behavior seemed a bit uncertain, but his mood was noticeably
  more serious. Still, he had nothing to report. On Friday morning, he came in
  very excited and spoke, half humorously, half seriously, of the strangely
  attractive power that his window had. He would not elaborate this notion and
  said that, in any case, it had nothing to do with the suicides; and that it
  would be ridiculous of him to say any more. When, on that same Friday, he
  failed to make his regular evening report, someone went to his room and found
  him hanging from the cross-bar of the window.</p>

  <p><br>
  All the circumstances, down to the minutest detail, were the same here as in
  the previous cases. Chaumié's legs dragged along the ground. The curtain cord
  had been used for a noose. The window was closed, the door to the room had
  not been locked and death had occurred at six o'clock. The dead man's mouth
  was wide open, and his tongue protruded from it.</p>

  <p>Chaumié's death, the third in as many weeks in room No. 7, had the
  following consequences: all the guests, with the exception of a German
  high-school teacher in room No. 16, moved out. The teacher took advantage of
  the occasion to have his rent reduced by a third. The next day, Mary Garden,
  the famous Opéra Comique singer, drove up to the Hotel Stevens and paid two
  hundred francs for the red curtain cord, saying it would bring her luck. The
  story, small consolation for Madame Dubonnet, got into the papers.</p>

  <p><br>
  If these events had occurred in summer, in July or August, Madame Dubonnet
  would have secured three times that price for her cord, but as it was in the
  middle of a troubled year, with elections, disorders in the Balkans, bank
  crashes in New York, the visit of the King and Queen of England, the result
  was that the <i>affaire</i> Rue Alfred Stevens was talked of less than it
  deserved to be. As for the newspaper accounts, they were brief, being
  essentially the police reports word for word.</p>

  <p>These reports were all that Richard Bracquemont, the medical student, knew
  of the matter.</p>

  <p>There was one detail about which he knew nothing because neither the
  police inspector nor any of the eyewitnesses had mentioned it to the press.
  It was only later, after what happened to the medical student, that anyone
  remembered that when the police removed Sergeant Charles-Maria Chaumié's body
  from the window cross-bar a large black spider crawled from the dead man's
  open mouth. A hotel porter flicked it away, exclaiming, "Ugh, another of
  those damned creatures."</p>

  <p>When in later investigations which concerned themselves mostly with
  Bracquemont the servant was interrogated, he said that he had seen a similar
  spider crawling on the Swiss traveling salesman's shoulder when his body was
  removed from the window cross-bar. But Richard Bracquemont knew nothing of
  all this.</p>

  <p>It was more than two weeks after the last suicide that Bracquemont moved
  into the room. It was a Sunday. Bracquemont conscientiously recorded
  everything that happened to him in his journal. That journal now
  follows.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Monday, February 28.</p>

  <p class="journal">I moved in yesterday evening. I unpacked my two wicker
  suitcases and straightened the room a little. Then I went to bed. I slept so
  soundly that it was nine o'clock the next morning before a knock at my door
  woke me. It was my hostess, bringing me breakfast herself. One could read her
  concern for me in the eggs, the bacon and the superb <i>café au lait</i> she
  brought me. I washed and dressed, then smoked a pipe as I watched the servant
  make up the room.</p>

  <p class="journal">So, here I am. I know well that the situation may prove
  dangerous, but I think I may just be the one to solve the problem. If, once
  upon a time, Paris was worth a mass (conquest comes at a dearer rate these
  days), it is well worth risking my life <i>pour un si bel enjeu</i>. I have
  at least one chance to win, and I mean to risk it. As it is, I'm not the only
  one who has had this notion. Twenty-seven people have tried for access to the
  room. Some went to the police, some went directly to the hotel owner. There
  were even three women among the candidates. There was plenty of competition.
  No doubt the others are poor devils like me.</p>

  <p class="journal">And yet, it was I who was chosen. Why? Because I was the
  only one who hinted that I had some plan&mdash;or the semblance of a plan.
  Naturally, I was bluffing.</p>

  <p class="journal">These journal entries are intended for the police. I must
  say that it amuses me to tell those gentlemen how neatly I fooled them. If
  the Inspector has any sense, he'll say, "Hm. This Bracquemont is just the man
  we need." In any case, it doesn't matter what he'll say. The point is I'm
  here now, and I take it as a good sign that I've begun my task by bamboozling
  the police.</p>

  <p class="journal">I had gone first to Madame Dubonnet, and it was she who
  sent me to the police. They put me off for a whole week&mdash;as they put off
  my rivals as well. Most of them gave up in disgust, having something better
  to do than hang around the musty squad room. The Inspector was beginning to
  get irritated at my tenacity. At last, he told me I was wasting my time. That
  the police had no use for bungling amateurs. "Ah, if only you had a plan.
  Then... "</p>

  <p class="journal">On the spot, I announced that I had such a plan, though
  naturally I had no such thing. Still, I hinted that my plan was brilliant,
  but dangerous, that it might lead to the same end as that which had overtaken
  the police officer, Chaumié. Still, I promised to describe it to him if he
  would give me his word that he would personally put it into effect. He made
  excuses, claiming he was too busy but when he asked me to give him at least a
  hint of my plan, I saw that I had picqued his interest.</p>

  <p class="journal">I rattled off some nonsense made up of whole cloth. God
  alone knows where it all came from.</p>

  <p class="journal">I told him that six o'clock of a Friday is an occult hour.
  It is the last hour of the Jewish week; the hour when Christ disappeared from
  his tomb and descended into hell. That he would do well to remember that the
  three suicides had taken place at approximately that hour. That was all I
  could tell him just then, I said, but I pointed him to The Revelations of St.
  John.</p>

  <p class="journal">The Inspector assumed the look of a man who understood all
  that I had been saying, then he asked me to come back that evening.</p>

  <p class="journal">I returned, precisely on time, and noted a copy of the New
  Testament on the Inspector's desk. I had, in the meantime, been at the
  Revelations myself without however having understood a syllable. Perhaps the
  Inspector was cleverer than I. Very politely&mdash;nay&mdash;deferentially,
  he let me know that, despite my extremely vague intimations, he believed he
  grasped my line of thought and was ready to expedite my plan in every
  way.</p>

  <p class="journal">And here, I must acknowledge that he has indeed been
  tremendously helpful. It was he who made the arrangement with the owner that
  I was to have anything I needed so long as I stayed in the room. The
  Inspector gave me a pistol and a police whistle, and he ordered the officers
  on the beat to pass through the Rue Alfred Stevens as often as possible, and
  to watch my window for any signal. Most important of all, he had a desk
  telephone installed which connects directly with the police station. Since
  the station is only four minutes away, I see no reason to be afraid.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Wednesday, March 1.</p>

  <p class="journal">Nothing has happened. Not yesterday. Not today.</p>

  <p class="journal">Madame Dubonnet brought a new curtain cord from another
  room&mdash; the rooms are mostly empty, of course. Madame Dubonnet takes
  every opportunity to visit me, and each time she brings something with her. I
  have asked her to tell me again everything that happened here, but I have
  learned nothing new. She has her own opinion of the suicides. Her view is
  that the music hall artist, Krause, killed himself because of an unhappy love
  affair. During the last year that Krause lived in the hotel, a young woman
  had made frequent visits to him. These visits had stopped, just before his
  death. As for the Swiss gentleman, Madame Dubonnet confessed herself baffled.
  On the other hand, the death of the policeman was easy to explain. He had
  killed himself just to annoy her.</p>

  <p class="journal">These are sad enough explanations, to be sure, but I let
  her babble on to take the edge off my boredom.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Thursday, March 3.</p>

  <p class="journal">Still nothing. The Inspector calls twice a day. Each time,
  I tell him that all is well. Apparently, these words do not reassure him.</p>

  <p class="journal">I have taken out my medical books and I study, so that my
  self-imposed confinement will have some purpose.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Friday. March 4.</p>

  <p class="journal">I ate uncommonly well at noon. The landlady brought me
  half a bottle of champagne. It seemed a meal for a condemned man. Madame
  Dubonnet looked at me as if I were already three-quarters dead. As she was
  leaving, she begged me tearfully to come with her, fearing no doubt that I
  would hang myself 'just to annoy her.'</p>

  <p class="journal">I studied the curtain cord once again. Would I hang myself
  with it? Certainly, I felt little desire to do so. The cord is stiff and
  rough&mdash;not the sort of cord one makes a noose of. One would need to be
  truly determined before one could imitate the others.</p>

  <p class="journal">I am seated now at my table. At my left, the telephone. At
  my right, the revolver. I'm not frightened; but I am curious.</p>

  <p class="journal">Six o'clock, the same evening Nothing has happened. I was
  about to add, "Unfortunately." The fatal hour has come&mdash;and has gone,
  like any six o'clock on any evening. I won't hide the fact that I
  occasionally felt a certain impulse to go to the window, but for a quite
  different reason than one might imagine.</p>

  <p class="journal">The Inspector called me at least ten times between five
  and six o'clock. He was as impatient as I was. Madame Dubonnet, on the other
  hand, is happy. A week has passed without someone in No. 7 hanging himself.
  Marvelous.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Monday, March 7.</p>

  <p class="journal">I have a growing conviction that I will learn nothing;
  that the previous suicides are related to the circumstances surrounding the
  lives of the three men. I have asked the Inspector to investigate the cases
  further, convinced that someone will find their motivations. As for me, I
  hope to stay here as long as possible. I may not conquer Paris here, but I
  live very well and I'm fattening up nicely. I'm also studying hard, and I am
  making real progress. There is another reason, too, that keeps me
  here.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Wednesday, March 9.</p>

  <p class="journal">So! I have taken one step more. Clarimonda.</p>

  <p class="journal">I haven't yet said anything about Clarimonda. It is she
  who is my "third" reason for staying here. She is also the reason I was
  tempted to go to the window during the "fateful" hour last Friday. But of
  course, not to hang myself.</p>

  <p class="journal">Clarimonda. Why do I call her that? I have no idea what
  her name is, but it ought to be Clarimonda. When finally I ask her name, I'm
  sure it will turn out to be Clarimonda.</p>

  <p class="journal">I noticed her almost at once... in the very first days.
  She lives across the narrow street; and her window looks right into mine. She
  sits there, behind her curtains.</p>

  <p class="journal">I ought to say that she noticed me before I saw her; and
  that she was obviously interested in me. And no wonder. The whole
  neighborhood knows I am here, and why. Madame Dubonnet has seen to that.</p>

  <p class="journal">I am not of a particularly amorous disposition. In fact,
  my relations with women have been rather meager. When one comes from Verdun
  to Paris to study medicine, and has hardly money enough for three meals a
  day, one has something else to think about besides love. I am then not very
  experienced with women, and I may have begun my adventure with her stupidly.
  Never mind. It's exciting just the same.</p>

  <p class="journal">At first, the idea of establishing some relationship with
  her simply did not occur to me. It was only that, since I was here to make
  observations, and, since there was nothing in the room to observe, I thought
  I might as well observe my neighbor&mdash;openly, professionally. Anyhow, one
  can't sit all day long just reading.</p>

  <p class="journal">Clarimonda, I have concluded, lives alone in the small
  flat across the way. The flat has three windows, but she sits only before the
  window that looks into mine. She sits there, spinning on an old-fashioned
  spindle, such as my grandmother inherited from a great aunt. I had no idea
  anyone still used such spindles. Clarimonda's spindle is a lovely object. It
  appears to be made of ivory; and the thread she spins is of an exceptional
  fineness. She works all day behind her curtains, and stops spinning only as
  the sun goes down. Since darkness comes abruptly here in this narrow street
  and in this season of fogs, Clarimonda disappears from her place at five
  o'clock each evening.</p>

  <p class="journal">I have never seen a light in her flat.</p>

  <p class="journal">What does Clarimonda look like? I'm not quite sure. Her
  hair is black and wavy; her face pale.</p>

  <p class="journal">Her nose is short and finely shaped with delicate nostrils
  that seem to quiver. Her lips, too, are pale: and when she smiles, it seems
  that her small teeth are as keen as those of some beast of prey.</p>

  <p class="journal">Her eyelashes are long and dark; and her huge dark eyes
  have an intense glow. I guess all these details more than I know them. It is
  hard to see clearly through the curtains.</p>

  <p class="journal">Something else: she always wears a black dress embroidered
  with a lilac motif; and black gloves, no doubt to protect her hands from the
  effects of her work. It is a curious sight: her delicate hands moving
  perpetually, swiftly grasping the thread, pulling it, releasing it, taking it
  up again; as if one were watching the indefatigable motions of an insect.</p>

  <p class="journal">Our relationship? For the moment, still very superficial,
  though it feels deeper. It began with a sudden exchange of glances in which
  each of us noted the other. I must have pleased her, because one day she
  studied me a while longer, then smiled tentatively. Naturally, I smiled back.
  In this fashion, two days went by, each of us smiling more frequently with
  the passage of time. Yet something kept me from greeting her directly.</p>

  <p class="journal">Until today. This afternoon, I did it. And Clarimonda
  returned my greeting. It was done subtly enough, to be sure, but I saw her
  nod.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Thursday, March 10.</p>

  <p class="journal">Yesterday, I sat for a long time over my books, though I
  can't truthfully say that I studied much. I built castles in the air and
  dreamed of Clarimonda.</p>

  <p class="journal">I slept fitfully.</p>

  <p class="journal">This morning, when I approached my window, Clarimonda was
  already in her place. I waved, and she nodded back. She laughed and studied
  me for a long time.</p>

  <p class="journal">I tried to read, but I felt much too uneasy. Instead, I
  sat down at my window and gazed at Clarimonda. She too had laid her work
  aside. Her hands were folded in her lap. I drew my curtain wider with the
  window cord, so that I might see better. At the same moment, Clarimonda did
  the same with the curtains at her window. We exchanged smiles.</p>

  <p class="journal">We must have spent a full hour gazing at each other.</p>

  <p class="journal">Finally, she took up her spinning.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Saturday, March 12.</p>

  <p class="journal">The days pass. I eat and drink. I sit at the desk. I light
  my pipe; I look down at my book but I don't read a word, though I try again
  and again. Then I go to the window where I wave to Clarimonda. She nods. We
  smile. We stare at each other for hours.</p>

  <p class="journal">Yesterday afternoon, at six o'clock, I grew anxious. The
  twilight came early, bringing with it something like anguish. I sat at my
  desk. I waited until I was invaded by an irresistible need to go to the
  window&mdash;not to hang myself; but just to see Clarimonda. I sprang up and
  stood beside the curtain where it seemed to me I had never been able to see
  so clearly, though it was already dark.</p>

  <p class="journal">Clarimonda was spinning, but her eyes looked into mine. I
  felt myself strangely contented even as I experienced a light sensation of
  fear.</p>

  <p class="journal">The telephone rang. It was the Inspector tearing me out of
  my trance with his idiotic questions.</p>

  <p class="journal">I was furious.</p>

  <p class="journal">This morning, the Inspector and Madame Dubonnet visited
  me. She is enchanted with how things are going. I have now lived for two
  weeks in room No. 7. The Inspector, however, does not feel he is getting
  results. I hinted mysteriously that I was on the trail of something most
  unusual.</p>

  <p class="journal">The jackass took me at my word and fulfilled my dearest
  wish. I've been allowed to stay in the room for another week. God knows it
  isn't Madame Dubonnet's cooking or wine-cellar that keeps me here. How
  quickly one can be sated with such things. No. I want to stay because of the
  window Madame Dubonnet fears and hates. That beloved window that shows me
  Clarimonda.</p>

  <p class="journal">I have stared out of my window, trying to discover whether
  she ever leaves her room, but I've never seen her set foot on the street.</p>

  <p class="journal">As for me, I have a large, comfortable armchair and a
  green shade over the lamp whose glow envelopes me in warmth. The Inspector
  has left me with a huge packet of fine tobacco&mdash;and yet I cannot work. I
  read two or three pages only to discover that I haven't understood a word. My
  eyes see the letters, but my brain refuses to make any sense of them. Absurd.
  As if my brain were posted: 'No Trespassing.' It is as if there were no room
  in my head for any other thought than the one: Clarimonda. I push my books
  away; I lean back deeply into my chair. I dream.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Sunday, March 13.</p>

  <p class="journal">This morning I watched a tiny drama while the servant was
  tidying my room. I was strolling in the corridor when I paused before a small
  window in which a large garden spider had her web.</p>

  <p class="journal">Madame Dubonnet will not have it removed because she
  believes spiders bring luck, and she's had enough misfortunes in her house
  lately. Today, I saw a much smaller spider, a male, moving across the strong
  threads towards the middle of the web, but when his movements alerted the
  female, he drew back shyly to the edge of the web from which he made a second
  attempt to cross it. Finally, the female in the middle appeared attentive to
  his wooing, and stopped moving. The male tugged at a strand gently, then more
  strongly till the whole web shook. The female stayed motionless. The male
  moved quickly forward and the female received him quietly, calmly, giving
  herself over completely to his embraces. For a long minute, they hung
  together motionless at the center of the huge web.</p>

  <p class="journal">Then I saw the male slowly extricating himself, one leg
  over the other. It was as if he wanted tactfully to leave his companion alone
  in the dream of love, but as he started away, the female, overwhelmed by a
  wild life, was after him, hunting him ruthlessly. The male let himself drop
  from a thread; the female followed, and for a while the lovers hung there,
  imitating a piece of art. Then they fell to the window-sill where the male,
  summoning all his strength, tried again to escape. Too late. The female
  already had him in her powerful grip, and was carrying him back to the center
  of the web. There, the place that had just served as the couch for their
  lascivious embraces took on quite another aspect. The lover wriggled, trying
  to escape from the female's wild embrace, but she was too much for him. It
  was not long before she had wrapped him completely in her thread, and he was
  helpless. Then she dug her sharp pincers into his body, and sucked full
  draughts of her young lover's blood. Finally, she detached herself from the
  pitiful and unrecognizable shell of his body and threw it out of her web.</p>

  <p class="journal">So that is what love is like among these creatures. Well
  for me that I am not a spider.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Monday, March 14.</p>

  <p class="journal">I don't look at my books any longer. I spend my days at
  the window. When it is dark, Clarimonda is no longer there, but if I close my
  eyes, I continue to see her.</p>

  <p class="journal">This journal has become something other than I intended.
  I've spoken about Madame Dubonnet, about the Inspector; about spiders and
  about Clarimonda. But I've said nothing about the discoveries I undertook to
  make. It can't be helped.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Tuesday, March 15.</p>

  <p class="journal">We have invented a strange game, Clarimonda and I. We play
  it all day long. I greet her; then she greets me. Then I tap my fingers on
  the windowpanes. The moment she sees me doing that, she too begins tapping. I
  wave to her; she waves back. I move my lips as if speaking to her; she does
  the same. I run my hand through my sleep-disheveled hair and instantly her
  hand is at her forehead. It is a child's game, and we both laugh over it.
  Actually, she doesn't laugh. She only smiles a gently contained smile. And I
  smile back in the same way.</p>

  <p class="journal">The game is not as trivial as it seems. It's not as if we
  were grossly imitating each other&mdash;that would weary us both. Rather, we
  are communicating with each other. Sometimes, telepathically, it would seem,
  since Clarimonda follows my movements instantaneously almost before she has
  had time to see them. I find myself inventing new movements, or new
  combinations of movements, but each time she repeats them with disconcerting
  speed. Sometimes. I change the order of the movements to surprise her, making
  whole series of gestures as rapidly as possible; or I leave out some motions
  and weave in others, the way children play "Simon Says." What is amazing is
  that Clarimonda never once makes a mistake, no matter how quickly I change
  gestures.</p>

  <p class="journal">That's how I spend my days... hut never for a moment do I
  feel that I'm killing time. It seems, on the contrary, that never in my life
  have I been better occupied.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Wednesday. March 16.</p>

  <p class="journal">Isn't it strange that it hasn't occurred to me to put my
  relationship with Clarimonda on a more serious basis than these endless
  games. Last night, I thought about this... I can, of course, put on my hat
  and coat, walk down two flights of stairs, take five steps across the street
  and mount two flights to her door which is marked with a small sign that says
  "Clarimonda." Clarimonda what? I don't know. Something. Then I can knock
  and...</p>

  <p class="journal">Up to this point I imagine everything very clearly, but I
  cannot see what should happen next. I know that the door opens. But then I
  stand before it, looking into a dark void. Clarimonda doesn't come. Nothing
  comes. Nothing is there, only the black, impenetrable dark.</p>

  <p class="journal">Sometimes, it seems to me that there can be no other
  Clarimonda but the one I see in the window; the one who plays gesture-games
  with me. I cannot imagine a Clarimonda wearing a hat, or a dress other than
  her black dress with the lilac motif. Nor can I imagine a Clarimonda without
  black gloves. The very notion that I might encounter Clarimonda somewhere in
  the streets or in a restaurant eating, drinking or chatting is so improbable
  that it makes me laugh.</p>

  <p class="journal">Sometimes I ask myself whether I love her. It's impossible
  to say, since I have never loved before. However, if the feeling that I have
  for Clarimonda is really&mdash;love, then love is something entirely
  different from anything I have seen among my friends or read about in
  novels.</p>

  <p class="journal">It is hard for me to be sure of my feelings and harder
  still to think of anything that doesn't relate to Clarimonda or, what is more
  important, to our game. Undeniably, it is our game that concerns me. Nothing
  else&mdash;and this is what I understand least of all.</p>

  <p class="journal">There is no doubt that I am drawn to Clarimonda, but with
  this attraction there is mingled another feeling, fear. No. That's not it
  either. Say rather a vague apprehension in the presence of the unknown. And
  this anxiety has a strangely voluptuous quality so that I am at the same time
  drawn to her even as I am repelled by her. It is as if I were moving in giant
  circles around her, sometimes coming close, sometimes retreating... back and
  forth, back and forth.</p>

  <p class="journal">Once, I am sure of it, it will happen, and I will join
  her.</p>

  <p class="journal">Clarimonda sits at her window and spins her slender,
  eternally fine thread, making a strange cloth whose purpose I do not
  understand. I am amazed that she is able to keep from tangling her delicate
  thread. Hers is surely a remarkable design, containing mythical beasts and
  strange masks.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Thursday, March 17.</p>

  <p class="journal">I am curiously excited. I don't talk to people any more. I
  barely say "hello" to Madame Dubonnet or to the servant. I hardly give myself
  time to eat. All I can do is sit at the window and play the game with
  Clarimonda. It is an enthralling game. Overwhelming.</p>

  <p class="journal">I have the feeling something will happen tomorrow.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Friday, March 18.</p>

  <p class="journal">Yes. Yes. Something will happen today. I tell
  myself&mdash;as loudly as I can&mdash;that that's why I am here. And yet,
  horribly enough, I am afraid. And in the fear that the same thing is going to
  happen to me as happened to my predecessors, there is strangely mingled
  another fear: a terror of Clarimonda. And I cannot separate the two
  fears.</p>

  <p class="journal">I am frightened. I want to scream.</p>

  <p class="journal">Six o'clock, evening I have my hat and coat on. Just a
  couple of words.</p>

  <p class="journal">At five o'clock, I was at the end of my strength. I'm
  perfectly aware now that there is a relationship between my despair and the
  "sixth hour" that was so significant in the previous weeks. I no longer laugh
  at the trick I played the Inspector.</p>

  <p class="journal">I was sitting at the window, trying with all my might to
  stay in my chair, but the window kept drawing me. I had to resume the game
  with Clarimonda. And yet, the window horrified me. I saw the others hanging
  there: the Swiss traveling salesman, fat, with a thick neck and a grey
  stubbly beard; the thin artist; and the powerful police sergeant. I saw them,
  one after the other, hanging from the same hook, their mouths open, their
  tongues sticking out. And then, I saw myself among them.</p>

  <p class="journal">Oh, this unspeakable fear. It was clear to me that it was
  provoked as much by Clarimonda as by the cross-bar and the horrible hook. May
  she pardon me... but it is the truth. In my terror, I keep seeing the three
  men hanging there, their legs dragging on the floor.</p>

  <p class="journal">And yet, the fact is I had not felt the slightest desire
  to hang myself; nor was I afraid that I would want to do so. No, it was the
  window I feared; and Clarimonda. I was sure that something horrid was going
  to happen. Then I was overwhelmed by the need to go to the window&mdash;to
  stand before it. I had to...</p>

  <p class="journal">The telephone rang. I picked up the receiver and before I
  could hear a word, I screamed, "Come. Come at once."</p>

  <p class="journal">It was as if my shrill cry had in that instant dissipated
  the shadows from my soul. I grew calm.</p>

  <p class="journal">I wiped the sweat from my forehead. I drank a glass of
  water. Then I considered what I should say to the Inspector when he arrived.
  Finally, I went to the window. I waved and smiled. And Clarimonda too waved
  and smiled.</p>

  <p class="journal">Five minutes later, the Inspector was here. I told him
  that I was getting to the bottom of the matter, but I begged him not to
  question me just then. That very soon I would be in a position to make
  important revelations. Strangely enough, though I was lying to him. I myself
  had the feeling that I was telling the truth. Even now, against my will, I
  have that same conviction.</p>

  <p class="journal">The Inspector could not help noticing my agitated state of
  mind, especially since I apologized for my anguished cry over the telephone.
  Naturally, I tried to explain it to him, and yet I could not find a single
  reason to give for it. He said affectionately that there was no need ever to
  apologize to him; that he was always at my disposal; that that was his duty.
  It was better that he should come a dozen times to no effect rather than fail
  to be here when he was needed. He invited me to go out with him for the
  evening. It would be a distraction for me. It would do me good not to be
  alone for a while. I accepted the invitation though I was very reluctant to
  leave the room.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Saturday, March 19.</p>

  <p class="journal">We went to the Gaieté Rochechouart, La Cigale, and La Lune
  Rousse. The Inspector was right: It was good for me to get out and breathe
  the fresh air. At first, I had an uncomfortable feeling, as if I were doing
  something wrong; as if I were a deserter who had turned his back on the flag.
  But that soon went away. We drank a lot, laughed and chatted. This morning,
  when I went to my window, Clarimonda gave me what I thought was a look of
  reproach, though I may only have imagined it. How could she have known that I
  had gone out last night? In any case, the look lasted only for an instant,
  then she smiled again.</p>

  <p class="journal">We played the game all day long.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Sunday, March 20.</p>

  <p class="journal">Only one thing to record: we played the game.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Monday, March 21.</p>

  <p class="journal">We played the game&mdash;all day long.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Tuesday, March 22.</p>

  <p class="journal">Yes, the game. We played it again. And nothing else.
  Nothing at all.</p>

  <p class="journal">Sometimes I wonder what is happening to me? What is it I
  want? Where is all this leading? I know the answer: there is nothing else I
  want except what is happening. It is what I want... what I long for. This
  only.</p>

  <p class="journal">Clarimonda and I have spoken with each other in the course
  of the last few days, but very briefly; scarcely a word. Sometimes we moved
  our lips, but more often we just looked at each other with deep
  understanding.</p>

  <p class="journal">I was right about Clarimonda's reproachful look because I
  went out with the Inspector last Friday. I asked her to forgive me. I said it
  was stupid of me, and spiteful to have gone. She forgave me, and I promised
  never to leave the window again. We kissed, pressing our lips against each of
  our windowpanes.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Wednesday, March 23.</p>

  <p class="journal">I know now that I love Clarimonda. That she has entered
  into the very fiber of my being. It may be that the loves of other men are
  different. But does there exist one head, one ear, one hand that is exactly
  like hundreds of millions of others? There are always differences, and it
  must be so with love. My love is strange, I know that, but is it any the less
  lovely because of that? Besides, my love makes me happy.</p>

  <p class="journal">If only I were not so frightened. Sometimes my terror
  slumbers and I forget it for a few moments, then it wakes and does not leave
  me. The fear is like a poor mouse trying to escape the grip of a powerful
  serpent. Just wait a bit, poor sad terror. Very soon, the serpent love will
  devour you.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Thursday, March 24.</p>

  <p class="journal">I have made a discovery: I don't play with Clarimonda. She
  plays with me.</p>

  <p class="journal">Last night, thinking as always about our game, I wrote
  down five new and intricate gesture patterns with which I intended to
  surprise Clarimonda today. I gave each gesture a number. Then I practiced the
  series, so I could do the motions as quickly as possible, forwards or
  backwards. Or sometimes only the even- numbered ones, sometimes the odd. Or
  the first and the last of the five patterns. It was tiring work, but it made
  me happy and seemed to bring Clarimonda closer to me. I practiced for hours
  until I got all the motions down pat, like clockwork.</p>

  <p class="journal">This morning, I went to the window. Clarimonda and I
  greeted each other, then our game began. Back and forth! It was incredible
  how quickly she understood what was to be done; how she kept pace with
  me.</p>

  <p class="journal">There was a knock at the door. It was the servant bringing
  me my shoes. I took them. On my way back to the window, my eye chanced to
  fall on the slip of paper on which I had noted my gesture patterns. It was
  then that I understood: in the game just finished, I had not made use of a
  single one of my patterns.</p>

  <p class="journal">I reeled back and had to hold on to the chair to keep from
  falling. It was unbelievable. I read the paper again&mdash;and again. It was
  still true: I had gone through a long series of gestures at the window, and
  not one of the patterns had been mine.</p>

  <p class="journal">I had the feeling, once more, that I was standing before
  Clarimonda's wide open door, through which, though I stared. I could see
  nothing but a dark void. I knew, too, that if I chose to turn from that door
  now. I might be saved; and that I still had the power to leave. And yet, I
  did not leave&mdash;because I felt myself at the very edge of the mystery: as
  if I were holding the secret in my hands.</p>

  <p class="journal">"Paris! You will conquer Paris," I thought. And in that
  instant, Paris was more powerful than Clarimonda.</p>

  <p class="journal">I don't think about that any more. Now, I feel only love.
  Love, and a delicious terror.</p>

  <p class="journal">Still, the moment itself endowed me with strength. I read
  my notes again, engraving the gestures on my mind. Then I went back to the
  window only to become aware that there was not one of my patterns that I
  wanted to use. Standing there, it occurred to me to rub the side of my nose;
  instead I found myself pressing my lips to the windowpane. I tried to drum
  with my fingers on the window sill; instead, I brushed my fingers through my
  hair. And so I understood that it was not that Clarimonda did what I did.
  Rather, my gestures followed her lead and with such lightning rapidity that
  we seemed to be moving simultaneously. I, who had been so proud because I
  thought I had been influencing her, I was in fact being influenced by her.
  Her influence... so gentle... so delightful.</p>

  <p class="journal">I have tried another experiment. I clenched my hands and
  put them in my pockets firmly intending not to move them one bit. Clarimonda
  raised her hand and, smiling at me, made a scolding gesture with her finger.
  I did not budge, and yet I could feel how my right hand wished to leave my
  pocket. I shoved my fingers against the lining, but against my will, my hand
  left the pocket; my arm rose into the air. In my turn, I made a scolding
  gesture with my finger and smiled.</p>

  <p class="journal">It seemed to me that it was not I who was doing all this.
  It was a stranger whom I was watching.</p>

  <p class="journal">But, of course, I was mistaken. It was I making the
  gesture, and the person watching me was the stranger; that very same stranger
  who, not long ago, was so sure that he was on the edge of a great discovery.
  In any case, it was not I.</p>

  <p class="journal">Of what use to me is this discovery? I am here to do
  Clarimonda's will. Clarimonda, whom I love with an anguished heart.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Friday, March 25.</p>

  <p class="journal">I have cut the telephone cord. I have no wish to be
  continually disturbed by the idiotic inspector just as the mysterious hour
  arrives.</p>

  <p class="journal">God. Why did I write that? Not a word of it is true. It is
  as if someone else were directing my pen.</p>

  <p class="journal">But I want to... want to... to write the truth here...
  though it is costing me great effort. But I want to... once more... do what I
  want.</p>

  <p class="journal">I have cut the telephone cord... ah...</p>

  <p class="journal">Because I had to... there it is. Had to...</p>

  <p class="journal">We stood at our windows this morning and played the game,
  which is now different from what it was yesterday. Clarimonda makes a
  movement and I resist it for as long as I can. Then I give in and do what she
  wants without further struggle. I can hardly express what a joy it is to be
  so conquered; to surrender entirely to her will.</p>

  <p class="journal">We played. All at once, she stood up and walked back into
  her room, where I could not see her; she was so engulfed by the dark. Then
  she came back with a desk telephone, like mine, in her hands. She smiled and
  set the telephone on the window sill, after which she took a knife and cut
  the cord. Then I carried my telephone to the window where I cut the cord.
  After that, I returned my phone to its place.</p>

  <p class="journal">That's how it happened...</p>

  <p class="journal">I sit at my desk where I have been drinking tea the
  servant brought me. He has come for the empty teapot, and I ask him for the
  time, since my watch isn't running properly. He says it is five fifteen. Five
  fifteen...</p>

  <p class="journal">I know that if I look out of my window, Clarimonda will be
  there making a gesture that I will have to imitate. I will look just the
  same. Clarimonda is there, smiling. If only I could turn my eyes away from
  hers.</p>

  <p class="journal">Now she parts the curtain. She takes the cord. It is red,
  just like the cord in my window. She ties a noose and hangs the cord on the
  hook in the window cross-bar.</p>

  <p class="journal">She sits down and smiles.</p>

  <p class="journal">No. Fear is no longer what I feel. Rather, it is a sort of
  oppressive terror which I would not want to avoid for anything in the world.
  Its grip is irresistible, profoundly cruel, and voluptuous in its
  attraction.</p>

  <p class="journal">I could go to the window, and do what she wants me to do,
  but I wait. I struggle. I resist though I feel a mounting fascination that
  becomes more intense each minute.</p><br>

  <p class="journal">Here I am once more. Rashly, I went to the window where I
  did what Clarimonda wanted. I took the cord, tied a noose, and hung it on the
  hook...</p>

  <p class="journal">Now, I want to see nothing else&mdash;except to stare at
  this paper. Because if I look. I know what she will do... now... at the sixth
  hour of the last day of the week. If I see her, I will have to do what she
  wants. Have to...</p>

  <p class="journal">I won't see her...</p>

  <p class="journal">I laugh. Loudly. No. I'm not laughing. Something is
  laughing in me, and I know why. It is because of my... I won't...</p>

  <p class="journal">I won't, and yet I know very well that I have to... have
  to look at her. I must... must... and then... all that follows.</p>

  <p class="journal">If I still wait, it is only to prolong this exquisite
  torture. Yes, that's it. This breathless anguish is my supreme delight. I
  write quickly, quickly... just so I can continue to sit here; so I can
  attenuate these seconds of pain.</p>

  <p class="journal">Again, terror. Again. I know that I will look toward her.
  That I will stand up. That I will hang myself.</p>

  <p class="journal">That doesn't frighten me. That is beautiful... even
  precious.</p>

  <p class="journal">There is something else. What will happen afterwards? I
  don't know, but since my torment is so delicious. I feel... feel that
  something horrible must follow.</p>

  <p class="journal">Think... think... Write something. Anything at all... to
  keep from looking toward her...</p>

  <p class="journal">My name... Richard Bracquemont. Richard Bracquemont...
  Richard Bracquemont... Richard... I can't... go on. I must... no... no...
  must look at her... Richard Bracquemont... no... no more... Richard...
  Richard Bracque&mdash;...</p>

  <p><br>
  The inspector of the ninth precinct, after repeated and vain efforts to
  telephone Richard, arrived at the Hotel Stevens at 6:05. He found the body of
  the student Richard Bracquemont hanging from the cross-bar of the window in
  room No. 7, in the same position as each of his three predecessors.</p>

  <p>The expression on the student's face, however, was different, reflecting
  an appalling fear.</p>

  <p>Bracquemont's eyes were wide open and bulging from their sockets. His lips
  were drawn into a rictus, and his jaws were clamped together. A huge black
  spider whose body was dotted with purple spots lay crushed and nearly bitten
  in two between his teeth.</p>

  <p>On the table, there lay the student's journal. The inspector read it and
  went immediately to investigate the house across the street. What he learned
  was that the second floor of that building had not been lived in for many
  months.</p>
