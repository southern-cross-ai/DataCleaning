<h1>The Vampire of Croglin Grange</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Augustus Hare</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>An intriguing account of vampirism was related by a certain Captain
Fisher, to Augustus Hare, who who wrote of it in the Story of My
Life.</p>

<p>"Fisher," said the Captain, "may sound a very plebeian name, but
this family is of a very ancient lineage, and for many hundreds of
years they have possessed a very curious old place in Cumberland, which
bears the weird name of Croglin Grange. The great characteristic of the
house is that never at any period of its very long existence has it
been more than one story high, but it has a terrace from which large
grounds sweep away towards the church in the hollow, and a fine distant
view.</p>

<p>"When, in lapse of years, the Fishers outgrew Croglin Grange in
family and fortune, they were wise enough not to destroy the
long-standing characteristic of the place by adding another story to
the house, but they went away to the south, to reside at Thorncombe
near Guildford, and they let Croglin Grange.</p>

<p>"They were extremely fortunate in their tenants, two brothers and a
sister. They heard their praises from all quarters. To their poorer
neighbours they were all that is most kind and beneficent, and their
neighbours of a higher class spoke of them as a most welcome addition
to the little society of the neighbourhood. On their part, the tenants
were greatly delighted with their new residence. The arrangement of the
house, which would have been a trial to many, was not so to them. In
every respect Croglin Grange was exactly suited to them.</p>

<p>"The winter was spent most happily by the new inmates of Croglin
Grange, who shared in all the little social pleasures of the district,
and made themselves very popular. In the following summer there was one
day which was dreadfully, annihilatingly hot. The brothers lay under
the trees with their books, for it was too hot for any active
occupation. The sister sat in the veranda and worked, or tried to work,
for in the intense sultriness of that summer day, work was next to
impossible. They dined early, and after dinner they still sat out on
the veranda, enjoying the cool air which came with the evening, and
they watched the sun set, and the moon rise over the belt of trees
which separated the grounds from the churchyard, seeing it mount the
heavens till the whole lawn was bathed in silver light, across which
the long shadows from the shrubbery fell as if embossed, so vivid and
distinct were they.</p>

<p>"When they separated for the night, all retiring to their rooms on
the ground floor (for, as I said, there was no upstairs in that house),
the sister felt that the heat was still so great that she could not
sleep, and having fastened her window, she did not close the
shutters--in that very quiet place it was not necessary--and, propped
against the pillows, she still watched the wonderful, the marvellous
beauty of that summer night. Gradually she became aware of two lights,
two lights which flickered in and out in the belt of trees which
separated the lawn from the churchyard, and, as her gaze became fixed
upon them, she saw them emerge, fixed in a dark substance, a definite
ghastly something, which seemed every moment to become nearer,
increasing in size and substance as it approached. Every now and then
it was lost for a moment in the long shadows which stretched across the
lawn from the trees, and then it emerged larger than ever, and still
coming on. As she watched it, the most uncontrollable horror seized
her. She longed to get away, but the door was close to the window, and
the door was locked on the inside, and while she was unlocking it she
must be for an instant nearer to it. She longed to scream, but her
voice seemed paralysed, her tongue glued to the roof of her mouth.</p>

<p>"Suddenly--she could never explain why afterwards--the terrible
object seemed to turn to one side, seemed to be going round the house,
not to be coming to her at all, and immediately she jumped out of bed
and rushed to the door, but as she was unlocking it she heard scratch,
scratch, scratch upon the window, and saw a hideous brown face with
flaming eyes glaring in at her. She rushed back to the bed, but the
creature continued to scratch, scratch, scratch upon the window.</p>

<p>She felt a sort of mental comfort in the knowledge that the window
was securely fastened on the inside. Suddenly the scratching sound
ceased, and a kind of pecking sound took its place. Then, in her agony,
she became aware that the creature was unpicking the lead! The noise
continued, and a diamond pane of glass fell into the room. Then a long
bony finger of the creature came in and turned the handle of the
window, and the window opened, and the creature came in; and it came
across the room, and her terror was so great that she could not scream,
and it came up to the bed, and it twisted its long, bony fingers into
her hair, and it dragged her head over the side of the bed, and--it bit
her violently in the throat.</p>

<p>"As it bit her, her voice was released, and she screamed with all
her might and main. Her brothers rushed out of their rooms, but the
door was locked on the inside. A moment was lost while they got a poker
and broke it open. Then the creature had already escaped through the
window, and the sister, bleeding violently from a wound in the throat,
was lying unconscious over the side of the bed. One brother pursued the
creature, which fled before him through the moonlight with gigantic
strides, and eventually seemed to disappear over the wall into the
churchyard. Then he rejoined his brother by the sister's bedside. She
was dreadfully hurt, and her wound was a very definite one, but she was
of strong disposition, not even given to romance or superstition, and
when she came to herself she said, 'What has happened is most
extraordinary and I am very much hurt. It seems inexplicable, but of
course there is an explanation, and we must wait for it. It will turn
out that a lunatic has escaped from some asylum and found his way
here.' The wound healed, and she appeared to get well, but the doctor
who was sent for to her would not believe that she could bear so
terrible a shock so easily, and insisted that she must have change,
mental and physical; so her brothers took her to Switzerland.</p>

<p>"Being a sensible girl, when she went abroad she threw herself at
once into the interests of the country she was in. She dried plants,
she made sketches, she went up mountains, and as autumn came on, she
was the person who urged that they should return to Croglin Grange. 'We
have taken it,' she said, 'for seven years, and we have only been there
one; and we shall always find it difficult to let a house which is only
one story high, so we had better return there; lunatics do not escape
every day.' As she urged it, her brothers wished nothing better, and
the family returned to Cumberland. From there being no upstairs in the
house it was impossible to make any great change in their arrangements.
The sister occupied the same room, but it is unnecessary to say she
always closed the shutters, which, however, as in many old houses,
always left one top pane of the window uncovered. The brothers moved,
and occupied a room together, exactly opposite that of their sister,
and they always kept loaded pistols in their room.</p>

<p>"The winter passed most peacefully and happily. In the following
March, the sister was suddenly awakened by a sound she remembered only
too well--scratch, scratch, scratch upon the window, and, looking up,
she saw, climbed up to the topmost pane of the window, the same hideous
brown shrivelled face, with glaring eyes, looking in at her. This time
she screamed as loud as she could. Her brothers rushed out of their
room with pistols, and out of the front door.</p>

<p>The creature was already scudding away across the lawn. One of the
brothers fired and hit it in the leg, but still with the other leg it
continued to make way, scrambled over the wall into the churchyard, and
seemed to disappear into a vault which belonged to a family long
extinct.</p>

<p>"The next day the brothers summoned all the tenants of Croglin
Grange, and in their presence the vault was opened. A horrible scene
revealed itself. The vault was full of coffins; they had been broken
open, and their contents, horribly mangled and distorted, were
scattered over the floor. One coffin alone remained intact. Of that the
lid had been lifted, but still lay loose upon the coffin. They raised
it, and there, brown, withered, shrivelled, mummified, but quite
entire, was the same hideous figure which had looked in at the windows
of Croglin Grange, with the marks of a recent pistol-shot in the leg:
and they did the only thing that can lay a vampire--they burnt it."</p>

<h3>THE END</h3>
