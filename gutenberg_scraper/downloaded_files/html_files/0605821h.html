<h1>Mlle de Scuderi</h1>

<h3>A Tale of the Times of Louis the Fourteenth</h3>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>E. T. A. Hoffman</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Magdaleine de Scud&eacute;ri, so famous for her charming poetical
and other writings, lived in a small mansion in the Rue St.
Honor&eacute;, by favour of Louis the XIVth and Madame de
Maintenon.</p>

<p>Late one night--about midnight--in the autumn of the year 1680,
there came a knocking at the door of this house, so loud and violent
that it shook the very ground. Baptiste, who filled the offices of
cook, butler and doorkeeper in the lady's modest establishment, had
gone, by her leave, to the country to his sister's wedding, so that
La Martini&egrave;re, the femme de chambre, was the only person still
awake in the house. She heard this knocking, which went on without
ceasing almost, and she remembered that, as Baptiste was away, she
and her mistress were alone and unprotected. She thought of the
housebreakings, robberies and murders which were so frequent in Paris
at that time, and felt convinced that some of the numerous bands of
malefactors, knowing the defenceless state of the house that night,
were raising this alarm at the door, and would commit some outrage if
it were opened; so she remained in her room, trembling and terrified,
anathematising Baptiste, and his sister's marriage into the
bargain.</p>

<p>Meantime the thundering knocking went on at the door, and she
thought she heard a voice calling in the intervals, "Open, for the
love of Christ Open!--open!" At last, her alarm increasing, she took
her candle and ran out on to the landing, where she distinctly heard
the voice crying, "Open the door, for the love of Christ!"</p>

<p>"After all," she said to herself, "one knows that a robber would
not be crying out in that way. Perhaps it is somebody who is being
pursued and is come to my lady for refuge. She is known to be always
ready to do a kind action--but we must be very careful!"</p>

<p>She opened a window and called down into the street, asking who it
was who was making such a tremendous thundering at the door at that
time of the night, rousing everybody from their sleep. This she did
in a voice which she tried to make as like a man's as she could. By
the glimmer of the moon, which was beginning to break through dark
clouds, she could make out a tall figure in a long grey cloak, with a
broad hat drawn down over his forehead.</p>

<p>Then she cried, in a loud voice, so that this person in the street
should hear, "Baptiste! Claude! Pierre! Get up, and see who this
rascal is who is trying to get in at this time of night."</p>

<p>But a gentle, entreating voice spoke from beneath, saying, "Ah, La
Martini&egrave;re, I know it is you, you kind soul, though you are
trying to alter your voice; and I know well enough that Baptiste is
away in the country, and that there is nobody in the house but your
mistress and yourself. Let me in. I must speak with your lady this
instant."</p>

<p>"Do you imagine," asked La Martini&egrave;re, "that my lady is
going to speak to you in the middle of the night? Can't you
understand that she has been in bed ever so long, and that it is as
much as my place is worth to awaken her out of her first sweet sleep,
which is so precious to a person at her time of life?"</p>

<p>"I know," answered the person beneath, "that she has just this
moment put away the manuscript of the novel Clelia, at which she is
working so hard, and is writing some verses which she means to read
tomorrow at Madame de Maintenon's. I implore you, Madame La
Martini&egrave;re, be so compassionate as to open the door. Upon your
doing so depends the escape of an unfortunate creature from
destruction. Nay, honour, freedom, a human life, depend on this
moment in which I must speak with your lady. Remember, her anger will
rest upon you for ever when she comes to know that it was you who
cruelly drove away from her door the unfortunate wretch who came to
beg for her help."</p>

<p>"But why should you come for her help at such an extraordinary
time of the night?" asked La Martini&egrave;re. "Come back in the
morning at a reasonable hour." But the reply came up, "Does destiny,
when it strikes like the destroying lightning, consider hours and
times? When there is but one moment when rescue is possible, is help
to be put off? Open the door to me. Have no fear of a wretched being
who is without defence, hunted, hard pressed by a terrible fate, and
flies to your lady for succour from the most imminent peril."</p>

<p>La Martini&egrave;re heard the stranger moaning and groaning as he
uttered those words in the deepest sorrow. The tone of his voice was
that of a youth, soft and gentle, and most touching to the heart; and
so, deeply moved. she went without much more hesitation and fetched
the key.</p>

<p>As soon as she opened the door, the form shrouded in the mantle
burst violently in and, passing La Martini&egrave;re, cried in a wild
voice, "Take me to your lady!" La Martini&egrave;re held up the light
which she was carrying, and the glimmer fell on the face of a very
young man, distorted and frightfully drawn, and as pale as death. She
almost fell down on the landing for terror when he opened his cloak
and showed the glittering hilt of a stiletto sticking out of his
doublet. He flashed his gleaming eyes at her, and cried, more wildly
than before, "Take me to your lady, I tell you."</p>

<p>La Martini&egrave;re saw that her mistress was in the utmost
danger. All her affection for her, who was to her as the kindest of
mothers, flamed up and created a courage which she herself would
scarcely have thought herself capable of. She quickly closed the door
of her room, moved rapidly in front of it, and said in a brave, firm
voice, "Your furious behaviour, now that you have got into the house,
is very different from what I should have expected from the way you
spoke down in the street. I see now that I had pity on you a little
too easily. You shall not see or speak with my lady at this hour. If
you have no bad designs, and are not afraid to show yourself in
daylight, come and tell her your business tomorrow; but take yourself
off out of this house now."</p>

<p>He heaved a hollow sigh, glared at La Martini&egrave;re with a
terrible expression, and grasped his dagger. She silently commended
her soul to God, but stood firm and looked him straight in the face,
pressing herself more firmly against the door through which he would
have to pass in order to reach her mistress.</p>

<p>"Let me get to your lady, I tell you!" he cried once more.</p>

<p>"Do what you will," said La Martini&egrave;re, "I shall not move
from this spot. Complete the crime which you have begun. A shameful
death on the Place de la Gr&egrave;ve will overtake you, as it has
your accursed comrades in wickedness."</p>

<p>"Ha! you are right, La Martini&egrave;re," he cried. "I am armed,
and I look as if I were an accursed robber and murderer. But my
comrades are not executed--are not executed," and he drew his dagger,
advancing with poisonous looks towards the terrified woman.</p>

<p>"Jesus!" she cried, expecting her death-wound; but at that moment
there came up from the street below the clatter and the ring of arms,
and the hoof-tread of horses.</p>

<p>"La Marechaus&eacute;e! La Marechaus&eacute;e! Help! help!" she
cried.</p>

<p>"Wretched woman, you will be my destruction," he cried. "All is
over now--all over! Here, take it; take it. Give this to your lady
now, or tomorrow if you like it better." As he said this in a
whisper, he took the candelabra from her, blew out the tapers, and
placed a casket in her hands. "As you prize your eternal salvation,"
he cried, "give this to your lady." He dashed out of the door, and
was gone.</p>

<p>La Martini&egrave;re had sunk to the floor. She raised herself
with difficulty, and groped her way back in the darkness to her room,
where she fell into an arm-chair, wholly overcome and unable to utter
a sound. Presently she heard the rattling of the bolts, which she had
left unfastened when she closed the house door. The house was
therefore now shut up, and soft unsteady steps were approaching her
room. Like one under a spell, unable to move, she was preparing for
the very worst, when to her inexpressible joy the door opened, and by
the pale light of the night-lamp she saw it was Baptiste. He was
deadly pale, and much upset.</p>

<p>"For the love of all the saints," he exclaimed, "tell me what has
happened! Oh, what a state I am in. Something--don't know what it
was--told me to come away from the wedding yesterday--forced me to
come away. So when I got to this street, I thought, Madame
Martini&egrave;re isn't a heavy sleeper; she'll hear me if I knock
quietly at the door, and let me in. Then up came a strong patrol,
horsemen and foot, armed to the teeth. They stopped me, and wouldn't
let me go. Luckily Desgrais was there, the lieutenant of the
Marechauss&eacute;e. He knows me, and as they were holding their
lanterns under my nose, he said, 'Ho, Baptiste! How come you here in
the streets at this time of the night? You ought to be at home,
taking care of the house. This is not a very safe spot just at this
moment. We're expecting to make a fine haul, and important arrest,
tonight.' You can't think, Madame La Martini&egrave;re, how I felt
when he said that. And when I got to the door, lo! and behold! a man
in a cloak comes bursting out with a drawn dagger in his hand, dodges
me, and makes off. The door was open, the keys in the lock. What, in
the name of all that's holy, is the meaning of it all?"</p>

<p>La Martini&egrave;re, relieved from her alarm, told him all that
had happened, and both she and he went back to the hall; and there
they found the candelabra on the floor, where the stranger had thrown
it on taking his flight. "There can't be the slightest doubt that our
mistress was within an ace of being robbed, and murdered too very
likely," Baptiste said. "According to what you say, the scoundrel
knew well enough that there was nobody in the house but her and you,
and even that she was still sitting up at her writing. Of course he
was one of those infernal blackguards who pry into folks' houses and
spy out everything that can be of use to them in their devilish
designs. And the little casket, Madame Martini&egrave;re, that I
think we'll throw into the Seine where it's deepest. Who shall be our
warrant that some monster or other isn't lying in wait for our
mistress's life? Very likely, if she opens the casket, she may tumble
down dead, as the old Marquis de Tournay did when he opened a letter
which came to him, he didn't know where from."</p>

<p>After a long consultation, they came to the conclusion that next
morning they would tell their lady everything that had happened, and
even hand her the mysterious casket, which might, perhaps, be opened
if proper precautions were taken. On carefully weighing all the
circumstances connected with the appearance of the stranger, they
thought that there must be some special secret or mystery involved in
the affair, which they were not in a position to unravel, but must
leave to be elucidated by their superiors.</p>

<p>There were good grounds for Baptiste's fears. Paris, at the time
in question, was the scene of atrocious deeds of violence, and that
just at a period when the most diabolical inventions of hell provided
the most facile means for their execution.</p>

<p>Glaser, a German apothecary, the most learned chemist of his day,
occupied himself--as people who cultivate his science often do--with
alchemical researches and experiments. He had set himself the task of
discovering the philosopher's stone. An Italian of the name of Exili
associated himself with him; but to him the art of goldmaking formed
a mere pretext. What he aimed at mastering was the blending,
preparation, and sublimation of the various poisonous substances
which Glaser hoped would give him the results he was in search of;
and at length Exili discovered how to prepare that delicate poison
which has no odour nor taste, and which, killing either slowly or in
a moment, leaves not the slightest trace in the human organism, and
baffles the utmost skill of the physician who, not suspecting poison
as the means of death, ascribes it to natural causes. But cautiously
as Exili went about this, he fell under suspicion of dealing with
poisons, and was thrown into the Bastille.</p>

<p>In the same cell with him there was presently quartered an officer
of the name of Godin de Sainte-Croix, who had long lived in relations
with the Marquise de Brinvilliers; which brought shame upon all her
family, till at length, as her husband cared nothing about her
conduct, her father (Dreux d'Aubray, Civil Lieutenant of Paris) had
to part the guilty pair by means of a lettre de cachet against
Sainte-Croix. The captain was a passionate man without character or
religion, a hypocrite given to all manner of vice from his youth.
What is more, he was addicted to the most furious jealousy and envy.
So nothing could be more welcome to him than Exili's devilish secret,
which gave him the power of destroying all his enemies. He became
Exili's assiduous pupil, and soon equalled his instructor; so that
when he was released from prison he was in a position to carry on
operations by himself on his own account.</p>

<p>La Brinvilliers was a depraved woman, and Sainte-Croix made her a
monster. She managed, by degrees, to poison first her own father
(with whom she was living in the hypocritical presence of taking care
of him in his declining years), next her two brothers, and then her
sister; the father out of revenge, and the others for their fortunes.
The histories of more than one poisoner bear terrible evidence that
crimes of this description assume the form of an irresistible
passion. Just as a chemist makes experiments for the pleasure and the
interest of watching them, poisoners have often, without the smallest
ulterior object, killed persons whose living or dying was to them a
matter of complete indifference. The sudden deaths of a number of
paupers, patients at the H&ocirc;tel Dieu, a little time after the
events just alluded to, led to suspicion that the bread which La
Brinvilliers was in the habit of giving them every week (so as to
appear a model of piety and benevolence) was poisoned. And it is
certain that she poisoned pigeon pasties which were served up to her
own invited guests. The Chevalier du Guet, and many more, were the
victims of those diabolical entertainments. Sainte-Croix, his
accomplice La Chauss&eacute;e, and La Brinvilliers, managed to hide
their crimes for a long while under a veil of impenetrable secrecy.
But, however the wicked may brazen matters out, there comes a time
when the Eternal Power of Heaven punishes the criminal, even here on
earth.</p>

<p>The poisons which Sainte-Croix prepared were so marvellously
delicate that if the powder (which the Parisians appositely named
"poudre de succession") were uncovered while being made, a single
inhalation of it was sufficient to cause immediate death. Therefore
Sainte-Croix always wore a glass mask when at work. This mask fell
off one day just as he was shaking a finished powder into a phial,
and, having inhaled some of the powder, he fell dead in an instant.
As he had no heirs, the law courts at once placed his property under
seal, when the whole diabolical arsenal of murder which had been at
the villain's disposal was discovered, and also the letters of Madame
de Brinvilliers, which left no doubt as to her crimes. She fled to a
convent at Li&egrave;ge. Desgrais, an officer of the
Marechauss&eacute;e, was sent after her. Disguised as a priest, he
got admitted into the convent, and succeeded in involving the
terrible woman in a love-affair, and in getting her to grant him a
clandestine meeting in a sequestered garden outside the town. When
she arrived there she found herself surrounded by Desgrais'
myrmidons; and her ecclesiastical gallant speedily transformed
himself into the officer of the Marechauss&eacute;e. He compelled her
to get into the carriage which was waiting outside the garden, and
drove straight away to Paris, surrounded by an ample guard. La
Chauss&eacute;e had been beheaded previously to this, and La
Brinvilliers suffered the same death. Her body was burnt, and its
ashes scattered to the winds.</p>

<p>The Parisians breathed freely again when the world was freed from
the presence of this monster, who had so long wielded with impunity
the weapon of secret murder against friend and foe. But it soon
became bruited abroad that the terrible art of the accursed La Croix
had been, somehow, handed down to a successor, who was carrying it on
triumphantly. Murder came gliding like an invisible, capricious
spectre into the narrowest and most intimate circles of relationship,
love and friendship, pouncing securely and swiftly upon its unhappy
victims. Men who today, were seen in robust health, were tottering
about on the morrow feeble and sick; and no skill of physicians could
restore them. Wealth, a good appointment or office, a nice-looking
wife, perhaps a little too young for her husband, were ample reasons
for a man's being dogged to death. The most frightful mistrust
snapped the most sacred ties. The husband trembled before his wife;
the father dreaded the son; the sister the brother. When your friend
asked you to dinner, you carefully avoided tasting the dishes and
wines which he set before you; and where joy and merriment used to
reign, there were now nothing but wild looks, watching to detect the
secret murderer. Fathers of families were to be seen with anxious
faces, buying supplies of food in out-of-the-way places where they
were not known, and cooking them themselves in dirty cook-shops, for
dread of treason in their own homes. And yet often the most careful
and ingenious precautions were unavailing.</p>

<p>For the repression of this ever-increasing disorder the King
constituted a fresh tribunal, to which he entrusted the special
investigation and punishment of those secret crimes. This was the
Chambre Ardente, which held its sittings near the Bastille. La Regnie
was its president. For a considerable time La Regnie's efforts,
assiduous as they were, were unsuccessful, and it was the lot of the
much overworked Desgrais to discover the most secret den of that foul
crime.</p>

<p>In the Faubourg Saint-Germain there lived an old woman, named La
Voisin, who followed the calling of teller of fortunes and summoner
of spirits, and she, assisted by her accomplices Le Sage and Le
Vigoureux, managed to alarm and astonish people who were by no means
to be considered weak or superstitious. But she did more than this.
She was, like La Croix, a pupil of Exili's and, like him, prepared
the delicate, traceless poison, which helped wicked sons to speedy
inheritances and unprincipled wives to other, younger husbands.
Desgrais fathomed her secrets; she made full confession; the Chambre
Ardente sentenced her to be burned, and the sentence was carried out
on the Place de la Gr&egrave;ve. Amongst her effects was found a list
of those who had availed themselves of her services; whence it
followed, not only that execution succeeded execution, but that
strong suspicion fell on persons in important positions. Thus it was
believed that Cardinal Bonzy had obtained from La Voisin the means of
disembarrassing himself of all the persons to whom, in his capacity
of Archbishop of Narbonne, he was bound to pay pensions. Similarly,
the Duchess de Bouillon and the Countess de Soissons (their names
having been found in La Voisin's list) were accused of having had
relations with her; and even Fran&ccedil;ois Henri de
Montmorenci-Boudebelle, Duc de Luxembourg, Peer and Marshal of the
realm, did not escape arraignment before the Chambre Ardente. He
surrendered himself to imprisonment in the Bastille, where the hatred
of Louvois and La Regnie immured him in a cell only six feet long.
Months elapsed before it was proved that his offences did not deserve
so severe a punishment. He had once gone to La Voisin to have his
horoscope drawn.</p>

<p>What is certain is that an excess of inconsiderate zeal led
President La Regnie into violently illegal and barbarous measures.
His Court assumed the character of the Inquisition. The very
slightest suspicion rendered any one liable to severe imprisonment,
and the establishment of the innocence of a person tried for his life
was often only a matter of the merest chance. Besides, La Regnie was
repulsive to behold, and of malicious disposition, so that he excited
the hatred of those whose avenger or protector he was called upon to
be. When he asked the Duchess de Bouillon if she had ever seen the
devil, she answered, "I think I see him at this moment."</p>

<p>Whilst now, on the Place de la Gr&egrave;ve, the blood of the
guilty and of the merely suspected was flowing in streams, and secret
deaths by poison were, at last, becoming more and more rare, a
trouble of another description showed itself, spreading abroad fresh
consternation. It seemed that a gang of robbers had made up their
minds to possess themselves of all the jewels in the city. Whenever a
valuable set of ornaments was bought, it disappeared in an
inexplicable manner, however carefully preserved and protected. And
everybody who dared to wear precious stones in the evening was
certain to be robbed, either in the public streets or in the dark
passages of houses. Very often they were not only robbed, but
murdered. Such of them as escaped with their lives said they had been
felled by the blow of a clenched fist on the head, which came on them
like a thunderbolt. And when they recovered their senses they found
that they had been robbed, and were in a totally different place from
where they had been knocked down.</p>

<p>Those who were murdered--and they were found nearly every morning
lying in the streets or in houses--had all the selfsame mortal
wound--a dagger-thrust, right through the heart, which the surgeons
said must have been delivered with such swiftness and certainty that
the victim would have fallen dead without the power of uttering a
sound. Now who, in all the luxurious Court of Louis Quatorze, was
there who was not implicated in some secret love-affair and,
consequently, often gliding about the streets late at night with
valuable presents in his pockets? Just as if this robber-gang were in
intercourse with spirits, they always knew perfectly well when
anything of this kind was going on. Often the fortunate lover
wouldn't reach the house where his lady was expecting him; often he
would fall at her threshold, at her very door, where, to her horror,
she would discover his bleeding body lying.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Argenson, the Minister of Police, arrested
every individual, in all Paris, who seemed to be touched by the very
faintest suspicion; in vain La Regnie raged, striving to compel
confession; in vain were guards and patrols reinforced. Not a trace
of the perpetrators of those outrages was to be discovered. The only
thing which was of a certain degree of use was to go about armed to
the teeth, and have a light carried before you; and yet there were
cases in which the servant who carried the light had his attention
occupied by having stones thrown at him, whilst at that very instant
his master was being robbed and murdered.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable feature of this business that, notwithstanding
all search and investigation in every quarter where there seemed to
be any chance of dealing in jewels going on, not a trace of even the
smallest of the plundered precious stones ever came to light.</p>

<p>Desgrais foamed in fury that even his acumen and skill were
powerless to prevent the escape of those scoundrels. Whatever part of
the town he happened to be in was let alone for the time, whilst in
some other quarter robbery and murder were lying in wait for their
rich prey.</p>

<p>Desgrais hit upon the clever idea of setting several facsimiles of
himself on foot--various Desgrais, exactly alike in gait, speech,
figure, face, etc.; so that his own men could not tell the one of
them from the other, or say which was the real Desgrais. Meanwhile,
at the risk of his life, he watched alone in the most secret
hiding-places, and followed, at a distance, this or the other person
who seemed, by the looks of him, to be likely to have jewels about
him. But those whom he was watching were unharmed, so that this
artifice of his was as well known to the culprits as everything else
seemed to be. Desgrais was in utter despair.</p>

<p>One morning he came to President La Regnie, pale, strained, almost
out of his mind.</p>

<p>"What is it--what news? Have you come upon the clue?" the
President cried to him as he came in.</p>

<p>"Ah, Monsieur!" said Desgrais, stammering in fury, "last night,
near the Louvre, the Marquis de la Fare was set upon under my very
nose!"</p>

<p>"Heaven and earth!" cried La Regnie, overjoyed, "we have got
them!"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, listen," said Desgrais, with a bitter smile. "I
was standing near the Louvre, watching and waiting, with hell itself
in my heart, for those devils who have been baffling me for such a
length of time. There came a figure close by me--not seeing me--with
uncertain steps, always looking behind him. By the moonlight I
recognised the Marquis de la Fare. I expected that he would be
passing. I knew where he was gliding to. Scarcely had he got ten or
twelve paces beyond me when, out of the ground apparently, springs a
figure, dashes the Marquis to the ground, falls down upon him. Losing
my self-control at this occurrence, which seemed to be likely to
deliver the murderer into my hands, I cried out aloud, and meant to
spring from my hiding-place with a great bound and seize hold of him.
But I tripped up on my cloak and fell down. I saw the fellow flee
away as if on the wings of the wind. I picked myself up, and made off
after him as fast as I could. As I ran, I sounded my horn. Out of the
distance the whistles of my men answered me. Things grew
lively--clatter of arms, tramp of horses on all sides. 'Here!--come
to me!--Desgrais!' I cried, till the streets re-echoed. All the time
I saw the man before me in the bright moonlight, turning off
right--left--to get away from me. We came to the Rue Ni&ccedil;aise.
There his strength seemed to begin to fail. I gathered mine up. He
was not more than fifteen paces ahead of me."</p>

<p>"You got hold of him!--your men came up!" cried La Regnie, with
flashing eyes, grasping Desgrais by the arm as if he were the fleeing
murderer himself.</p>

<p>"Fifteen paces ahead of me," said Desgrais, in a hollow voice, and
drawing his breath hard, "this fellow, before my eyes, dodged to one
side, and vanished through the wall."</p>

<p>"Vanished!--through the wall! Are you out of your senses?" La
Regnie cried, taking three steps backwards, and striking his hands
together.</p>

<p>"Call me as great a madman as you please, Monsieur," said
Desgrais, rubbing his forehead like one tortured by evil thoughts.
"Call me a madman, or a fool that sees spooks; but what I have told
you is the literal truth. I stood staring at the wall, while several
of my men came up out of breath, and with them the Marquis de la Fare
(who had picked himself up), with his drawn sword in his hand. We
lighted torches, we examined the wall all over. There was not the
trace of a door, a window, any opening. It is the strong stone wall
of a courtyard, belonging to a house in which people are
living--against whom there is not the slightest suspicion. I have
looked into the whole thing again this morning in broad daylight. It
must be the very devil himself who is at work befooling us in the
matter."</p>

<p>This story got bruited abroad through Paris, where all heads were
full of the sorceries, callings up of spirits and pacts with the
devil indulged in by La Voisin, Le Vigoureux, and the wicked priest
Le Sage; and as it lies in our eternal nature that the bent towards
the supernatural and the marvellous overpasses all reason, people
soon positively believed what Desgrais had only said in his
impatience--that the very devil himself must protect the rascals, and
that they had sold their souls to him. We can readily understand that
Desgrais' story soon received many absurd embellishments. It was
printed, and hawked about the town, with a woodcut at the top
representing a horrible figure of the devil sinking into the ground
before the terrified Desgrais. Quite enough to frighten the people,
and so terrify Desgrais' men that they lost all courage, and went
about the streets behung with amulets, and sprinkled with holy
water.</p>

<p>Seeing that the Chambre Ardente was unsuccessful, Argenson applied
to the King to constitute--with special reference to this novel
description of crime a tribunal armed with greater powers for
tracking and punishing offenders. The King, thinking he had already
given too ample powers to the Chambre Ardente, and shocked at the
horrors of the numberless executions carried out by the bloodthirsty
La Regnie, refused.</p>

<p>Then another method of influencing His Majesty was devised.</p>

<p>In the apartments of Madame de Maintenon--where the King was in
the habit of spending much of his time in the afternoons--and also,
very often, would be at work with his Ministers till late at night--a
poetical petition was laid before him, on the part of the "Endangered
Lovers," who complained that when "galanterie" rendered it incumbent
on them to be the bearers of some valuable present to the ladies of
their hearts, they had always to do it at the risk of their lives.
They said that, of course, it was honour and delight to pour out
their blood for the lady of their heart in knightly encounter, but
that the treacherous attack of the assassin, against which it was
impossible to guard, was quite a different matter. They expressed
their hope that Louis, the bright pole-star of love and gallantry,
might deign--arising end staining in fullest splendour--to dispel the
darkness of night, and thus reveal the black mysteries hidden
thereby; that the God-like hero, who had hurled his foes to the dust,
would now once more wave his flashing falchion and, as did Hercules
in the case of the Laernean Hydra, and Theseus in that of the
Minotaur, vanquish the threatening monster who was consuming all the
delights of love, and darkening all joy into deep sorrow and
inconsolable mourning.</p>

<p>Serious as the subject was, this poem was not deficient in most
wittily-turned phrases, particularly where it described the state of
watchful anxiety in which lovers had to glide to their mistresses,
and how this mental strain necessarily destroyed all the delights of
love, and nipped all adventures of "galanterie" in the very bud. And,
as it wound up with a high-flown panegyric of Louis XIV, the King
could not but read it with visible satisfaction. When he had perused
it, he turned to Madame de Maintenon--without taking his eyes from
it--read it again--aloud this time--and then asked, with a pleased
smile, what she thought of the petition of the "Endangered
Lovers."</p>

<p>Madame de Maintenon, faithful to her serious turn, and ever
wearing the garb of a certain piousness, answered that secret and
forbidden practices did not deserve much in the form of protection,
but that the criminals probably did require special laws for their
punishment. The King, not satisfied with this answer, folded the
paper up, and was going back to the Secretary of State, who was at
work in the ante-room, when, happening to glance sideways, his eyes
rested on Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri who was present, seated in a
little arm-chair. He went straight to her and the pleased smile which
had at first been playing about his mouth and cheeks--but had
disappeared--resumed the ascendency again. Standing close before her,
with his face unwrinkling itself, he said--</p>

<p>"The Marquise does not know, and has no desire to learn, anything
about the 'galanteries' of our enamoured gentlemen, and evades the
subject in ways which are nothing less than forbidden. But,
Mademoiselle, what do you think of this poetical petition?"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri rose from her chair; a transient
blush, like the purple of the evening sky, passed across her pale
cheeks and, gently bending forward, she answered with downcast
eyes:</p>

<p>"Un amant qui craint les voleurs</p>

<p>N'est point digne d'amour."</p>

<p>The King, surprised, and struck with admiration at the chivalrous
spirit of those few words--which completely took the wind out of the
sails of the poem, with all its lengthy tirades--cried, with flashing
eyes: "By Saint Denis, you are right, Mademoiselle! No blind laws,
touching the innocent and the guilty alike, shall shelter cowardice.
Argenson and La Regnie must do their best."</p>

<p>Next morning La Martini&egrave;re enlarged upon the terrors of the
time, painting them in glowing colours to her lady, when she told her
all that had happened the previous night, and handed her the
mysterious casket, with much fear and trembling. Both she and
Baptiste (who stood in the corner as white as a sheet, kneading his
cap in his hand from agitation and anxiety) implored her, in the name
of all the saints, to take the greatest precautions in opening
it.</p>

<p>Weighing and examining the unopened mystery in her hand, she said
with a smile, "You are a couple of bogies! The wicked scoundrels
outside who, as you say yourselves, spy out all that goes on in every
house know, no doubt, quite as well as you and I do, that I am not
rich, and that there are no treasures in this house worth committing
a murder for. Is my life in danger, do you think? Who could have any
interest in the death of an old woman of seventy-three, who never
persecuted any evildoers except those in her own novels; who writes
mediocre poetry, incapable of exciting anyone's envy; who has nothing
to leave behind her but the belongings of an old maid who sometimes
goes to Court, and two or three dozen handsomely-bound books with
gilt edges. And, alarming as your account is, La Martini&egrave;re,
of this man's appearance, I cannot believe that he meant me any harm,
so ____"</p>

<p>La Martini&egrave;re sprang three paces backwards, and Baptiste
fell on one knee with a hollow, "Ah!" as Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri pressed a projecting steel knob, and the lid of the
casket flew open with a certain amount of noise.</p>

<p>Great was her surprise to see that it contained a pair of
bracelets, and a necklace richly set in jewels. She took them out
and, as she spoke in admiration of the marvellous workmanship of the
necklace, La Martini&egrave;re cast glances of wonder at the
bracelets, and cried, again and again, that Madame de Montespan
herself did not possess such jewellery.</p>

<p>"But why is it brought to me?" cried Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri. "What can this mean?" She saw, however, a little
folded note at the bottom of the casket, and in this she rightly
thought she would find the key to the mystery. When she had read what
was written in the note, it fell from her trembling hands; she raised
an appealing look to heaven, and then sank down half fainting in her
chair. Baptiste and La Martini&egrave;re hurried to her, in
alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, in a voice stifled by tears, "the mortification!
The deep humiliation! Has it been reserved for me to undergo this in
my old age? Have I ever been frivolous, like some of the foolish
young creatures; are words, spoken half in jest, to be found capable
of such a terrible interpretation? Am I, who have been faithful to
all that is pure and good from my childhood, to be made virtually an
accomplice in the crimes of this terrible confederation ."</p>

<p>She held her handkerchief to her eyes, so that Baptiste and La
Martini&egrave;re, altogether at sea in their anxious conjectures,
felt powerless to set about helping her who was so dear to them, as
the best and kindest of mistresses, in her bitter affliction.</p>

<p>La Martini&egrave;re picked up the paper from the floor. On it was
written:</p>

<p>"'Un amant qui craint les voleurs</p>

<p>N'est point digne d'amour.'</p>

<p>"Your brilliant intellect, most honoured lady, has delivered us,
who exercise on weakness and cowardice the rights of the stronger,
and possess ourselves of treasures which would otherwise be
unworthily wasted, from much bitter persecution. As a proof of our
gratitude, be pleased kindly to accept this set of ornaments. It is
the most valuable that we have been enabled to lay hands on for many
a day. Although far more beautiful and precious jewels should adorn
you, yet we pray you not to deprive us of your future protection and
remembrance.--THE INVISIBLES."</p>

<p>"Is it possible," cried Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, when she
had partially recovered herself, "that shameless wickedness and
abandoned insult can be carried further by human beings?"</p>

<p>The sun was shining brightly through the window curtains of
crimson silk, and consequently the brilliants, which were lying on
the table beside the open casket, were flashing a rosy radiance.
Looking at them, Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri covered her face in
horror, and ordered La Martini&egrave;re instantly to take those
terrible jewels away, steeped, as they seemed to be, in the blood of
the murdered. La Martini&egrave;re, having at once put the necklace
and bracelets back into their case, thought the best thing to do
would be to give them to the Minister of Police, and tell him all
that had happened.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri rose, and walked up and down slowly
and in silence, as if considering what it was best to do. Then she
told Baptiste to bring a sedan chair, and La Martini&egrave;re to
dress her, as she was going straight to the Marquise de
Maintenon.</p>

<p>She repaired thither at the hour when she knew Madame de Maintenon
would be alone, taking the casket and jewels with her.</p>

<p>Madame de Maintenon might well wonder to see this dear old lady
(who was always kindness, sweetness and amiability personified),
pale, distressed, upset, coming in with uncertain steps. "In heaven's
name, what has happened to you?" she cried to her visitor, who was
scarcely able to stand upright, striving to reach the chair which the
Marquise drew forward for her. At last, when she could find words,
she told her what a deep, irremediable insult and outrage the
thoughtless speech which she had made in reply to the King had
brought upon her.</p>

<p>Madame de Maintenon, when she had heard the whole affair properly
related, thought Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri was taking it far too
much to heart, strange as the occurrence was--that the insult of a
pack of wretched rabble could not hurt an upright, noble heart; and
finally begged that she might see the ornaments.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri handed her the open casket, and
when she saw the splendid and valuable stones and the workmanship of
them she could not repress a loud expression of admiration. She took
the bracelets and necklace to the window, letting the sunlight play
on the jewels, and holding the beautiful goldsmith's work close to
her eyes so as to see with what wonderful skill each little link of
the chains was formed.</p>

<p>She turned suddenly to Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, and cried,
"Do you know, there is only one man who can have done this work--and
that is Ren&eacute; Cardillac."</p>

<p>Ren&eacute; Cardillac was then the cleverest worker in gold in all
Paris, one of the most artistic, and at the same time extraordinary
men of his day. Short rather than tall, but broad-shouldered and of
strong and muscular build, Cardillac, now over fifty, had still the
strength and activity of a youth. To this vigour, which was to be
called unusual, testified also his thick, curling, reddish hair and
his massive, shining face. Had he not been known to be the most
upright and honourable of men, unselfish, open, without reserve,
always ready to help, his altogether peculiar glance out of his
grimly sparkling eyes might have brought him under suspicion of being
secretly ill-tempered and wicked. In his art he was the most skilful
worker, not only in Paris, but probably in the world at that time.
Intimately acquainted with every kind of precious stones, versed in
all their special peculiarities, he could so handle and treat them
that ornaments which at a first glance promised to be poor and
insignificant, came from his workshop brilliant and splendid. He
accepted every commission with burning eagerness, and charged prices
so moderate as to seem out of all proportion to the work. And the
work left him no rest. Day and night he was to be heard hammering in
his shop; and often, when a job was nearly finished, he would
suddenly be dissatisfied with the form--would have doubts whether
some of the settings were delicate enough; some little link would not
be quite to his mind--in fine, the whole affair would be thrown into
the melting-pot, and begun all over again. Thus every one of his
works was a real, unsurpassable chef-d'oeuvre, which sent the person
who had ordered it into amazement.</p>

<p>But then, it was hardly possible to get the finished work out of
his hands. He would put the customer off from one week to another by
a thousand excuses--even from month to month. He might be offered
twice the price he had agreed upon, but it was useless; he would take
no more; and when, ultimately, he was obliged to yield to the
customer's remonstrances, and deliver the work, he could not conceal
the vexation--nay, the rage--which seethed within him. If he had to
deliver some specially valuable and unusually rich piece of
workmanship, worth perhaps several thousand francs, he would get into
such a condition that he ran up and down like one demented, cursing
himself, his work, and every thing and person about him; but should,
then, someone come running up behind him, crying, "Ren&eacute;
Cardillac, would you be so kind as to make me a beautiful necklace
for the lady I am going to marry?" or "a pair of bracelets for my
girl?" or the like, he would stop in a moment, flash his small eyes
upon the speaker, and say, "Let me see what you have got." The latter
would take out a little case and say "Here are jewels; they are not
worth much; only every-day affairs, but in your hands" Cardillac
would interrupt him, snatch the casket from his hands, take out the
stones (really not very valuable) hold them up to the light, and cry,
"Ho! ho! common stones, you say! Nothing of the kind!--very fine,
splendid stones! Just see what I shall make of them; and if a handful
of Louis are no object to you, I will put two or three others along
with them which will shine in your eyes like the sun himself!" The
customer would say: "I leave the matter entirely in your hands,
Master Ren&eacute;; make what change you please." Whether the
customer were a rich burgher or a gallant of quality, Cardillac would
then throw himself violently on his neck, embrace him and kiss him,
and say he was perfectly happy again, and that the work would be
ready in eight days' time. Then he would run home as fast as he could
to his workshop, where he would set to work hammering away; and in
eight days' time there would be a masterpiece ready.</p>

<p>But as soon as the customer arrived, glad to pay the moderate
price demanded and take away his prize, Cardillac would become
morose, ill-tempered, rude and insolent. "But consider, Master
Cardillac," the customer would say, "tomorrow is my wedding-day."
"What do I care?, Cardillac would answer; "what is your wedding-day
to me? Come back in a fortnight." "But it is finished!--here is the
money; I must have it." "And I tell you that there are many
alterations which I must make before I let it leave my hands, and I
am not going to let you have it today." "And I tell you, that if you
don't give me my jewels--which I am ready to pay you for--quietly,
you will see me come back with a file of D'Argenson's men." "Now, may
the devil seize you with a hundred red-hot pincers, and hang three
hundredweight on to the necklace, that it may throttle your bride!"
With which he would cram the work into the customer's breast-pocket,
seize him by the arm, push him out of the door, so that he would go
stumbling all the way downstairs. Then he would laugh like a fiend,
out of the window, when he saw the poor wretch go limping out,
holding his handkerchief to his bleeding nose. It was not easy to
explain either why, when Cardillac had undertaken a commission with
alacrity and enthusiasm, he would sometimes suddenly implore the
customer, with every sign of the deepest emotion--with the most
moving adjurations, even with sobs and tears--not to ask him to go on
with it. Many persons, amongst those most highly considered by the
King and nation, had in vain offered large sums for the smallest
specimen of Cardillac's work. He threw himself at the King's feet,
and begged him, of his mercy, not to command him to work for him; and
he declined all orders of Madame de Maintenon's; once, when she
wished him to make a little ring, with emblems of the arts on it,
which she wanted to give to Racine, he refused with expressions of
abhorrence and terror.</p>

<p>"I would wager, therefore," said Madame de Maintenon, "that even
if I were to send for Cardillac, to find out, at least, for whom he
had made those ornaments, he would somehow avoid coming, for fear
that I should give him an order; nothing will induce him to work for
me. Yet he does seem to have been rather less obstinate of late, for
I hear he is working more than ever, and allows his customers to take
away their jewellery at once, though he does so with deep annoyance,
and turns away his face when he hands them over."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, who was exceedingly anxious that
the jewels which came into her possession in such an extraordinary
manner should be restored to their owner as speedily as possible,
thought that this wondrous Ren&eacute; Cardillac should be informed
at once that no work was required of him, but simply his opinion as
to certain stones. The Marquise agreed to this; he was sent for, and
he came into the room in a very brief space, almost as if he had been
on the way when sent for.</p>

<p>When he saw Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, he appeared perplexed,
like one confronted with the unexpected, who for the time loses sight
of the demands of courtesy; he first of all made a profound reverence
to her, and then turned, in the second place, to the Marquise. Madame
de Maintenon impetuously asked him if the jewelled ornaments--to
which she pointed as they lay sparkling on the dark-green cover of
the table--were of his workmanship. Cardillac scarcely glanced at
them but, fixedly staring in her face, he hastily packed the necklace
and bracelets into their case, and shoved them away with some
violence.</p>

<p>Then with an evil smile gleaming on his red face, he said, "The
truth is, Madame la Marquise, that one must know Ren&eacute;
Cardillac's handiwork very little to suppose, even for a moment, that
any other goldsmith in the world made those. Of course, I made
them."</p>

<p>"Then," continued the Marquise, "say whom you made them for."</p>

<p>"For myself alone," he answered. "You may think this strange," he
continued, as they both gazed at him with amazement, Madame de
Maintenon incredulous, and Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri all anxiety
as to how the matter was going to turn out, "but I tell you the
truth, Madame la Marquise. Merely for the sake of the beauty of the
work, I collected some of my finest stones together, and worked for
the enjoyment of so doing, more carefully and diligently than usual.
Those ornaments disappeared from my workshop a short time since, in
an incomprehensible manner."</p>

<p>"Heaven be thanked!" cried Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, her
eyes sparkling with joy. With a smile she sprang up from her seat
and, going up to Cardillac quickly and actively as a young girl, she
laid her hands on his shoulder, saying, "Take back your treasure,
Master Ren&eacute;, which the villains have robbed you of!" And she
circumstantially related how the ornaments had come into her
possession.</p>

<p>Cardillac listened in silence, with downcast eyes, merely from
time to time uttering a scarcely audible "Hm! Indeed! Ah! Ho, ho!",
sometimes placing his hands behind his back, or again stroking his
chin and cheeks. When she had ended, he appeared to be struggling
with strange thoughts which had come to him during her story, and
seemed unable to come to any decision satisfactory to himself. He
rubbed his brow, sighed, passed his hand over his eyes--perhaps to
keep back tears. At last he seized the casket (which Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri had been holding out to him), sank slowly on one knee,
and said: "Esteemed lady! Fate destined this casket for you; and I
now feel, for the first time, that I was thinking of you when I was
at work upon it--nay, was making it expressly for you. Do not disdain
to accept this work, and to wear it; it is the best I have done for a
very long time."</p>

<p>"Ah! Master Ren&eacute;," said Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri,
jesting pleasantly, "how think you it would become me at my age to
bedeck myself with those beautiful jewels?--and what should put it in
your mind to make me such a valuable present? Come, come! If I were
as beautiful and as rich as the Marquise de Fontange, I should
certainly not let them out of my hands. But what have my withered
arms, and my wrinkled neck, to do with all that splendour?"</p>

<p>Cardillac had risen, and said with wild looks, like a man beside
himself, still holding the casket out towards her, "Do me the
kindness to take it, Mademoiselle! You have no notion how profound a
reverence I bear in my heart for your virtues and your high deserts.
Do but accept my little offering, as an attempt, on my part, to prove
to you the warmth of my regard."</p>

<p>As Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri was still hesitating, Madame de
Maintenon took the casket from Cardillac's hands, saying, "Now, by
heaven, Mademoiselle, you are always talking of your great age What
have you and I to do with years and their burden? You are like some
bashful young thing who would gladly reach out for forbidden fruit,
if she could gather it without hands or fingers. Do not hesitate to
accept good Master Ren&eacute;'s present, which thousands of others
could not obtain for money or entreaty."</p>

<p>As she spoke she continued to press the casket on Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri; and now Cardillac sank again on his knees, kissed her
dress, her hands, sighed, wept, sobbed, sprang up, and ran off in
frantic haste, upsetting chairs and tables, so that the glass and
porcelain crashed and clattered together.</p>

<p>"In the name of all the saints, what is the matter with the man?"
cried Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri in great alarm.</p>

<p>But the Marquise, in particularly happy temper, laughed aloud,
saying, "What is it, Mademoiselle? That Master Ren&eacute; is over
head and ears in love with you and, according to the laws of
galanterie, begins to lay siege to your heart with a valuable
present."</p>

<p>She carried this jest further, begging Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri not to be too obdurate towards this despairing lover
of hers; and Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, in her turn, borne away
on a current of merry fancies, said that if it were so, she would not
be able to refrain from delighting the world with the unprecedented
spectacle of a goldsmith's bride of three-and-seventy summers and
unexceptionable descent. Madame de Maintenon offered to twine the
bridal wreath herself, and give her a few hints as to the duties of a
housewife, a subject on which such a poor inexperienced little chit
could not be expected to know very much.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding all the jesting and the laughter, when
Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri rose to depart, she became very grave
again as her hand rested upon the jewel casket. "Whatever happens,"
she said, "I shall never be able to bring myself to wear these
ornaments. They have, in any event, been in the hands of one of those
diabolical men, who rob and slay with the audacity of the evil one
himself and are very probably in league with him. I shudder at the
thought of the blood which seems to cling to those glittering
stones--even Cardillac's behaviour had something about it which
struck me as singularly wild and strange. I cannot drive away from me
a gloomy foreboding that there is some terrible and frightful mystery
hidden behind all this; and yet, when I bring the whole affair, with
all the circumstances of it, as clearly as I can before my mental
vision, I cannot form the slightest idea what that mystery can
be--and, above all, how the good, honourable Master Ren&eacute;--the
very model of all a good, well-behaved citizen ought to be--can have
anything to do with what is wicked or guilty. But at all events, I
distinctly feel that I never can wear those jewels."</p>

<p>The Marquise considered that this was carrying scruples rather too
far; yet, when Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri asked her to say, on
her honour, what she would do in her place, she replied, firmly and
earnestly, "Far rather throw them into the Seine than ever put them
on."</p>

<p>The scene with Master Ren&eacute; inspired Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri to write some pleasant verses, which she read to the
King the following evening at Madame de Maintenon's. Perhaps it was
the thought of Master Ren&eacute; carrying off a bride of
seventy-three of unimpeachable quarterings--that enabled her to
conquer her evil forebodings; but conquer them she did,
completely--and the King laughed with all his heart, vowing that
Boileau Despreaux had met with his master. So de Scud&eacute;ri's
poem was reckoned the very wittiest that ever was written.</p>

<p>Several months had elapsed, when chance so willed it that
Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri was crossing the Pont Neuf in the
glass coach of the Duchesse de Montpensier. The invention of those
delightful glass coaches was then so recent that the people came
together in crowds whenever one of them made its appearance in the
streets. Consequently a gaping crowd gathered about the Duchesse's
carriage on the Pont Neuf, so that the horses could hardly make their
way along. Suddenly Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri heard a sound of
quarrelling and curses, and saw a man making a way for himself
through the crowd, by means of fisticuffs and blows in the ribs; and
as he came near they were struck by the piercing eyes of a young
face, deadly pale, and drawn by sorrow. This young man, gazing
fixedly upon them, vigorously fought his way to them by help of fists
and elbows, till he reached the carriage door, threw it open with
much violence, and flung a note into Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri's
lap; after which, he disappeared as he had come, distributing and
receiving blows and fisticuffs.</p>

<p>La Martini&egrave;re, who was with her mistress, fell back
fainting in the carriage with a shriek of terror, as soon as she saw
the young man. In vain Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri pulled the
string, and called out to the driver. As if urged by the foul fiend,
he kept lashing his horses till, scattering the foam from their
nostrils, they kicked, plunged and reared, finally thundering over
the bridge at a rapid trot. Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri emptied
the contents of her smelling-bottle over the fainting La
Martini&egrave;re, who at last opened her eyes and, shuddering and
quaking, clinging convulsively to her mistress, with fear and horror
in her pale face, groaned out with difficulty, "For the love of the
Virgin, what did that terrible man want? It was he who brought you
the jewels on that awful night." Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri
calmed her, pointing out that nothing very dreadful had happened
after all, and that the immediate business in hand was to ascertain
the contents of the letter. She opened it, and read as follows:</p>

<p>"A dark and cruel fatality, which you could dispel, is driving me
into an abyss. I conjure you--as a son would a mother, in the glow of
filial affection--to send the necklace and bracelets to Master
Ren&eacute; Cardillac, on some pretence or other--say, to have
something altered or improved. Your welfare, your very life--depend
on your doing this. If you do not comply before the day after
tomorrow, I will force my way into your house, and kill myself before
your eyes."</p>

<p>"Thus much is certain, at all events," said Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri, when she had read this letter, "whether this
mysterious man belongs to be band of robbers and murderers or not, he
has no very evil designs against me. If he had been able to see me
and speak to me on that night, who knows what strange events, what
dark concatenation of circumstances, would have been made known to
me, of which, at present, I seek, in my soul, the very faintest
inkling in vain. But, be the matter as it may, that which I am
enjoined in this letter to do, I certainly shall do, were it only to
be rid of those fatal jewels, which seem to me as if they must be
some diabolical talisman of the Prince of Darkness's very own.
Cardillac is not very likely to let them out of his hands again, if
once he gets hold of them."</p>

<p>She intended to take them to him next day; but it seemed as if all
the beaux esprits of Paris had entered into a league to assail and
besiege her with verses, dramas and anecdotes. Scarce had La Chapelle
finished reading the scenes of a tragedy, and declared that he
considered he had now vanquished Racine, when the latter himself came
in, and discomfited him with the pathetic speech of one of his kings,
until Boileau sent some of his fireballs soaring up into the dark sky
of the tragedies, by way of changing the subject from that eternal
one of the colonnade of the Louvre, to which the architectural Dr.
Perrault was shackling him.</p>

<p>When high noon arrived, Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri had to go
to Madame de Montansier; so the visit to Ren&eacute; Cardillac had to
be put off till the following day.</p>

<p>But the young man was always present to her mind, and a species of
dim remembrance seemed to be trying to arise in the depths of her
being that she had, somehow and at some time, seen that face and
those features before. Troubled dreams disturbed her broken slumbers.
It seemed to her that she had acted thoughtlessly, and was to blame
for her delay in grasping the hands which the unfortunate man was
holding out to her for help. She felt, in fact, as if it had depended
on her to prevent some atrocious crime. As soon as it was fairly
light, she had herself dressed and set off to the goldsmith's with
the jewels in her hand.</p>

<p>A crowd was streaming towards the Rue Ni&ccedil;aise (where
Cardillac lived), trooping together at the door, shouting, raging,
surging, striving to storm into the house, kept back with difficulty
by the Marechauss&eacute;e, who were guarding the place. Amid the
wild distracted uproar, voices were heard crying, "Tear him in
pieces! Drag him limb from limb, the accursed murderer!" At length
Desgrais came up, with a number of his men, and formed a lane through
the thickest of the crowd. The door flew open, and a man loaded with
irons was brought out, and marched off amid the most frightful
imprecations of the raging populace. At the moment when Mademoiselle
de Scud&eacute;ri, half dead with terror and gloomy foreboding,
caught sight of him, a piercing shriek of lamentation struck upon her
ears.</p>

<p>"Go forward!" she cried to the coachman and, with a clever, rapid
turn of his horses, he scattered the thick masses of the crowd aside,
and pulled up close to Ren&eacute; Cardillac's door. Desgrais was
there, and at his feet a young girl, beautiful as the day,
half-dressed, with her hair dishevelled and wild inconsolable despair
in her face, clinging to his knees, and crying in tones of the
bitterest and profoundest anguish, "He is innocent! He is
innocent!"</p>

<p>Desgrais and his men tried in vain to shake her off and raise her
from the ground, till at length a rough, powerful fellow, gripping
her arms with his strong hands, dragged her away from Desgrais by
sheer force. Stumbling awkwardly, he let the girl go, and she went
rolling down the stone steps, and lay like one dead on the
pavement.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri could contain herself no longer.
"In Christ's name!" she cried, "what has happened? What is going
forward here?" She hastily opened the carriage-door and stepped out.
The crowd made way for her deferentially; and when she saw that one
or two compassionate women had lifted the girl up, laid her on the
steps, and were rubbing her brow with strong waters, she went up to
Desgrais, and angrily repeated her question.</p>

<p>"A terrible thing has happened," said Desgrais. "Ren&eacute;
Cardillac was found this morning, killed by a dagger-thrust. His
journeyman, Olivier, is the murderer, and has just been taken to
prison."</p>

<p>"And the girl--"</p>

<p>"Is Madelon," interrupted Desgrais, "Cardillac's daughter. The
wretched culprit was her sweetheart, and now she is crying and
howling, and screaming over and over again that Olivier is
innocent--quite innocent; but she knows all about this crime, and I
must have her taken to prison too."</p>

<p>As he spoke he cast one of his baleful, malignant looks at the
girl, which made Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri shudder. The girl was
now beginning to revive, and breathe again faintly, though still
incapable of speech or motion. There she lay with closed eyes, and
people did not know what to do, whether to take her indoors, or leave
her where she was a little longer till she recovered. Deeply moved,
Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri looked upon this innocent creature,
with tears in her eyes. She felt a horror of Desgrais and his men.
Presently heavy footsteps came downstairs, those of the men bearing
Cardillac's body.</p>

<p>Coming to a rapid decision, Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri cried
out, "I shall take this girl home with me. What you do next is up to
you, Desgrais."</p>

<p>A murmur of approval ran through the crowd. The women raised the
girl; everyone crowded up; a hundred hands were proffered to help,
and she was borne lightly to the carriage, whilst from every lip
broke blessings on the kind lady who had saved her from arrest and
criminal trial.</p>

<p>Madelon lay for many hours in a deep swoon, but at length the
efforts of Seron--then the most celebrated physician in Paris--were
successful in restoring her. Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri completed
what Seron had begun, by letting the gentle rays of hope stream into
the girl's heart; till at length a violent flood of tears, which
started to her eyes, brought her relief, and she was able to tell her
story, with only occasional interruptions when the overmastering
might of her sorrow turned her words into sobbing.</p>

<p>She had been awakened at midnight by a soft knocking at her door,
and had recognised the voice of Olivier, imploring her to get up at
once, as her father lay dying. She sprang up, terrified, and opened
the door. Olivier, pale, strained and bathed in perspiration, led the
way, with tottering steps, to the workshop; she followed. There was
her father lying with his eyes glazed, and the death-rattle in his
throat. She threw herself upon him, weeping wildly, and then observed
that his shirt was covered with blood. Olivier gently lifted her
away, and busied himself in bathing a wound on her father's left
breast with balsam, and bandaging it. As he was doing so, her
father's consciousness came back; the rattle in his throat ceased
and, looking first on her and then on Olivier with most expressive
glances, he took her hand and placed it in Olivier's, pressing them
both together. The pair of them were kneeling beside her father's bed
when he raised himself with a piercing cry, but immediately fell back
again, and with a deep sigh departed this life. On this they both
wept and lamented.</p>

<p>Olivier told her how her father had been murdered in his presence
during an expedition on which he had accompanied him that night by
his order, and how he had with the utmost difficulty carried him
home, not supposing him to be mortally wounded. As soon as it was
day, the people of the house--who had heard the sounds of their
footsteps and of the weeping and lamenting during the night--came up,
and found them still kneeling, inconsolable by the goldsmith's body.
Then an uproar began, the Marechauss&eacute;e broke in, and Olivier
was taken to prison as her father's murderer. Madelon added the most
touching account of Olivier's virtues, goodness, piety and sincerity,
telling how he had honoured his master as if he had been his own
father, and how the latter returned his affection in the fullest
measure, choosing him for his son-in-law in spite of his poverty,
because his skill and fidelity were equal to the nobility of his
heart. All this Madelon saw out of the fulness of her love, and added
that if Olivier had thrust a dagger into her father's heart before
her very eyes, she would rather have thought it a delusion of Satan's
than have believed Olivier capable of such a terrible crime.</p>

<p>Most deeply touched by Madelon's unspeakable sufferings, and quite
disposed to believe in poor Olivier's innocence, Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri made inquiries, and found everything confirmed which
Madelon had said as to the domestic relations between the master and
his workman. The people of the house and the neighbours all spoke of
Olivier as the very model of good, steady, exemplary behaviour. No
one knew anything whatever against him, and yet, when the crime was
alluded to, every one shrugged his shoulders, and thought there was
something incomprehensible about it.</p>

<p>Olivier, brought before the Chambre Ardente, most steadfastly
denied--as Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri learned--the crime of which
he was accused, and maintained that his master had been attacked in
the street in his presence, and borne down, and that he had carried
him home still alive, although he did not long survive. This agreed
with Madelon's statement.</p>

<p>Over and over again Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri had the very
minutest circumstances of the awful event related to her. She
specially inquired if there had ever been any quarrel between Olivier
and the father, whether Olivier was altogether exempt from that
propensity to hastiness which often attacks the best tempered people
like a blind madness, and leads them to commit deeds which seem to
exclude all freewill; but the more enthusiastically Madelon spoke of
the peaceful home-life which the three had led together, united in
the most sincere affection, the more did every vestige of suspicion
against Olivier disappear from her mind. Closely examining and
considering everything, starting from the assumption that,
notwithstanding all that spoke so loudly for his innocence, Olivier
yet had been Cardillac's murderer, Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri
could find, in all the realm of possibility, no motive for the
terrible deed, which, in any case, was bound to destroy his
happiness. Poor though skilful, he succeeds in gaining the good will
of the most renowned of masters; he loves the daughter--his master
favours his love. Happiness, good fortune for the rest of his life
are laid open before him. Supposing, then, that--God knows on what
impulse--in an outburst of anger, he should have made this murderous
attack on his master, what diabolical hypocrisy it required to behave
as he had done after the deed! With the firmest conviction of his
innocence, Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri resolved to save Olivier at
whatever cost.</p>

<p>It seemed to her most advisable, before perhaps appealing to the
King in person, to go to the President La Regnie, point out for his
consideration all the circumstances which made for Olivier's
innocence, and so, perhaps, kindle in his mind a conviction
favourable to the accused, which might communicate itself
beneficially to the judges.</p>

<p>La Regnie received her with all the consideration which was the
due of a lady of her worth, held in high esteem by His Majesty
himself. He listened in silence to all she had to say concerning
Olivier's circumstances, relationships and character; and also
concerning the crime itself. A delicate, almost malignant, smile,
however, was all the token he gave that her adjurations, her
reminders (accompanied by plentiful tears) that a judge ought to be,
not the enemy of the accused, but ready to listen, also, to whatever
spoke in his favour, were not falling upon deaf ears. When at length
Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri concluded, quite exhausted and wiping
the tears from her cheeks, La Regnie began:</p>

<p>"It is quite characteristic of your excellent heart,
Mademoiselle," he said, that, moved by the tears of a young girl in
love, you should credit all she says; nay, be incapable of grasping
the idea of a fearful crime such as this. But it is otherwise with
the Judge, who is accustomed to tear off the mask from vile and
unblushing hypocrisy and deception. It is, of course, not incumbent
on me to disclose the course of a criminal trial to everyone who
chooses to inquire. I do my duty, Mademoiselle! The world's opinion
troubles me not at all. Evildoers should tremble before the Chambre
Ardente, which knows no punishments save blood and fire. But by you,
Mademoiselle, I would not be looked upon as a monster of severity and
barbarism; therefore, permit me briefly to present to you the
evidence of this young criminal's guilt. Heaven be thanked that
vengeance has fallen upon him. With your acute intelligence, you will
then disown your kindly and generous feelings, which do honour to
you, but in me would be out of place.</p>

<p>"Eh bien! this morning Ren&eacute; Cardillac is found murdered by
a dagger thrust, no one is by him except his workman, Olivier
Brusson, and the daughter. In Olivier's room there is found, amongst
other things, a dagger covered with fresh blood which exactly fits
into the wound. Olivier says, 'Cardillac was attacked in the street
before my eyes' 'Was the intention to rob him?' 'I do not know.' 'You
were walking with him and you could not drive off the murderer or
detain him?' 'My master was walking fifteen or perhaps sixteen paces
in front of me; I was following him.' 'Why, in all the world, so far
behind?' 'My master wished it so.' 'And what had Master Cardillac to
do in the streets so late?' 'That I cannot say.' 'But he was never in
the habit of being out after nine o'clock at other times, was he?' At
this Olivier hesitates, becomes confused, sighs, sheds tears, vows by
all that is sacred that Cardillac did go out that night, and met with
his death.</p>

<p>"Now observe, Mademoiselle, it is proved with the most absolute
certainty that Cardillac did not leave the house that night;
consequently Olivier's assertion that he went with him is a barefaced
falsehood. The street door of the house fastens with a heavy lock,
which makes a piercing noise in opening and closing, also the door
itself creaks and groans on its hinges, so that, as experiments have
proved, the noise is heard quite distinctly in the upper stories of
the house. Now, there lives in the lower story, that is to say, close
to the street door, old Ma&icirc;tre Claude Patru with his
housekeeper, a person of nearly eighty years of age, but still hale
and active. Both of them heard Cardillac come downstairs at nine
o'clock exactly, according to his usual custom, close and bolt the
door with a great deal of noise, go upstairs again, read the evening
prayer, and then (as was to be presumed by the shutting of the door)
go into his bedroom.</p>

<p>"Ma&icirc;tre Claude suffers from sleeplessness like many other
old people; and on the night in question he could not close an eye.
Therefore, about half-past nine the housekeeper struck a light in the
kitchen, which she reached by crossing the passage, and sat down at
the table beside her master with an old chronicle-book, from which
she read aloud, whilst the old man, fixing his thoughts on the
reading, sometimes sat in his arm-chair, sometimes walked slowly up
and down the room to try and bring on sleepiness. All was silence in
the house till nearly midnight; but then they heard overhead rapid
footsteps, a heavy fall, as of something on to the floor, and
immediately after that a hollow groaning. They were both struck by a
peculiar alarm and anxiety, the horror of the terrible deed which had
just been committed seemed to sweep over them. When day came what had
been done in the darkness was brought clearly to light."</p>

<p>"But, in the name of all the Saints," cried Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri, "considering all the circumstances which I have told
you at such length, can you think of any motive for this diabolical
deed?"</p>

<p>"Hm!" answered La Regnie. "Cardillac was anything but a poor man.
He had valuable jewels in his possession."</p>

<p>"But all he had would go to the daughter! You forget that Olivier
was to be Cardillac's son-in-law."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was compelled to share with others," said La Regnie,
"or to do the deed wholly for them!"</p>

<p>"Share!--murder for others," cried Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri,
in utter amazement.</p>

<p>"You must learn, Mademoiselle," continued La Regnie, "that
Olivier's blood would have been flowing on the Place de la
Gr&egrave;ve before this time, but that his crime is connected with
that deeply-hidden mystery which has so long brooded over Paris. It
is clear that Olivier belongs to that infamous band which, baffling
all our attempts at observation or discovery, carries on its
nefarious practices with perfect immunity. Through him everything
will, must be, discovered. Cardillac's wound is precisely the same as
those of all the persons who have been robbed and murdered in the
streets and houses; and most conclusive of all since Olivier's
arrest, the robberies and murders have ceased, the streets are as
safe by night as by day. Proof enough that Olivier was most probably
the chief of the band. As yet he will not confess, but there are
means of making him speak against his will."</p>

<p>"And Madelon!" cried Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, "that
truthful innocent creature."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried La Regnie, with one of his venomous smiles, "who will
answer to me that she is not in the plot, too? She does not care so
very much about her father. Her tears are all for the young
murderer."</p>

<p>"What?" cried Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, "not for her
father?--that girl--impossible!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" continued La Regnie, "remember la Brinvilliers! You must
pardon me, if by-and-by I have to carry off your
prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, and put her in the Conciergerie."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri shuddered at this grisly notion. It
seemed to her that no truth or virtue could endure before this
terrible man; as if he spied out murder and dark-guilt in the deepest
and most hidden thoughts of people's hearts. She rose. "Be human!"
was all that she was able, with difficulty, to say in her state of
anxiety and oppression. As she was just going to descend the stairs,
to which the President had attended her with ceremonious courtesy, a
strange idea came to her--she knew not how.</p>

<p>"Might I be allowed to see this unfortunate Olivier Brusson?" she
inquired, turning round sharply.</p>

<p>He scrutinised her face thoughtfully, and then distorted his
features into the repulsive smile which was characteristic of
him.</p>

<p>"Doubtless, Mademoiselle," he said, "your idea is that, trusting
your own feelings--the inward voice more than what happened before
our eyes, you would like to examine into Olivier's guilt or innocence
for yourself. If you do not fear that gloomy abode of crime if it is
not hateful to you to see those types of depravity in all their
gradations--the doors of the Conciergerie shall be opened to you in
two hours time. Olivier, whose fate excites your sympathy, shall be
brought to you."</p>

<p>In truth, Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri could not bring herself
to believe in Olivier's guilt. Everything spoke against him. Indeed,
no judge in the world would have thought otherwise than La Regnie, in
the face of what had happened. But the picture of domestic happiness
which Madelon had called before her eyes in such vivid colours,
outweighed and outshone all suspicion, so that she preferred to adopt
the hypothesis of some inscrutable mystery rather than believe what
her whole nature revolted against.</p>

<p>She thought she would hear Olivier's narrative of the events of
that night of mystery, and in this manner, possibly, penetrate
farther into a secret which the judges, perhaps, did not see into,
because they thought it unworthy of investigation.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Conciergerie, she was taken into a large,
well-lighted room. Presently she heard the ring of fetters. Olivier
Brusson was brought in; but as soon as she saw him she fell down
fainting. When she recovered, he was gone. She demanded impetuously
to be taken to her carriage; she would not remain another moment in
that place of crime and wickedness. Alas! at the first glance she had
recognised in Olivier Brusson the young man who had thrown the letter
into her carriage on the Pont Neuf, and who had brought her the
casket with the jewels. Now all doubt was gone, La Regnie's terrible
suspicions completely justified. Olivier belonged to the atrocious
band, and had, doubtless, murdered his master!</p>

<p>And Madelon! Never before so bitterly deceived by her kind
feelings, Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, under this deadly attack
upon her by the power of the evil one here below--in whose very
existence she had not believed--doubted if there was such a thing as
truth. She gave admittance to the fearful suspicion that Madelon,
too, was forsworn, and might have had a hand in the bloody deed. And
as it is the nature of the human mind that, when an idea has dawned
upon it, it eagerly seeks, and finds, colours in which to paint that
idea more and more vividly; as she weighed and considered all the
circumstances of the crime along with Madelon's behaviour, she found
a very great deal to nourish suspicion. Many things which had
hitherto been considered proofs of innocence and purity now became
evidences of studied hypocrisy and deep, corrupt wickedness. Those
heartrending cries of sorrow and bitter tears might well have been
caused by the deathly dread of her lover's bleeding--nay, of her own
falling into the executioner's hands.</p>

<p>With a resolve at once to cast away the serpent she had been
cherishing, Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri alighted from her
carriage. Madelon threw herself at her feet Her heavenly eyes--as
candid as an angel's--raised to her, her hands pressed to her heaving
breast, she wept, imploring help and consolation. Controlling herself
with difficulty and speaking with as much calmness and gravity as she
could, Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri said, "Go! go!--be thankful
that the murderer awaits the just punishment of his crime. May the
Holy Virgin grant that guilt does not weigh heavily on your own head
also." With a bitter cry of "Alas! then all is over!" Madelon fell
fainting to the ground. Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri left her to
the care of La Martini&egrave;re and went to another room.</p>

<p>Much distressed and estranged from all earthly things, she longed
to depart from a world filled with diabolical treachery and
falsehood. She complained of the destiny which had granted her so
many years in which to strengthen her belief in truth and virtue,
only to shatter in her old age the beautiful fancies which had
illumined her path.</p>

<p>She heard Madelon, as La Martini&egrave;re was leading her away,
murmur in broken accents, "Her, too, have the terrible men deceived.
Ah! wretched me!--miserable Olivier!" The tones of her voice went to
her heart, and again there dawned within her a belief in the
existence of some mystery, in Olivier's innocence. Torn by the most
contradictory feelings, she cried, "What spirit of the pit has mixed
me up in this terrible story, which will be my very death!"</p>

<p>At this moment Baptiste came in, pale and terrified, to say that
Desgrais was at the door. Since the dreadful La Voisin trial the
appearance of Desgrais in a house was the sure precursor of some
criminal accusation. Hence Baptiste's terror, as to which his
mistress asked him with a gentle smile, "What is the matter,
Baptiste? Has the name of Scud&eacute;ri been found in La Voisin's
lists?"</p>

<p>"Ah! For Christ's sake," cried Baptiste, trembling in every limb,
"how can you say such a thing? But Desgrais--the horrible
Desgrais--is looking so mysterious, and is so insistent--he seems
hardly able to wait till he can see you."</p>

<p>"Well. Baptiste," she said, "bring him in at once, this gentleman
who so frightens you. To me, at all events, he can cause no
anxiety."</p>

<p>"President La Regnie sends me to you, Mademoiselle," said
Desgrais, when he entered, "with a request which he scarce would dare
to make if he did not know your goodness and bravery, and if the last
hope of bringing to light an atrocious deed of blood did not lie in
your hands; had you not already taken such interest (as well as
bearing a part) in this case, which is keeping the Chambre Ardente,
and all of us, in a state of such breathless suspense. Since he saw
you, Olivier Brusson has been almost out of his mind. He still swears
by all that is sacred, that he is completely innocent of Ren&eacute;
Cardillac's death, though he is ready to suffer the punishment he has
deserved. Observe, Mademoiselle, that the latter admission clearly
refers to other crimes of which he has been guilty. But all attempts
to get him to utter anything further have been vain. He begs and
implores to be allowed to have an interview with you. To you alone
will he divulge everything. Vouchsafe then, Mademoiselle, to listen
to Brusson's confession."</p>

<p>"What?" cried Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, in indignation, "I
become an organ of the criminal court, and abuse the confidence of
this unfortunate fellow to bring him to the scaffold! No, Desgrais!
Ruffian and murderer though he may be, I could never deceive and
betray him thus villainously. I will have nothing to do with his
avowal. If I did, it would be locked up in my heart, as if made to a
priest under the seal of the confessional."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Mademoiselle," said Desgrais, with a subtle smile, "you
might alter your opinion after hearing Brusson. Did you not beg the
President to be human? This he is, in yielding to Brusson's foolish
desire, and thus trying one more expedient--the last--before
resorting to the rack, for which Brusson is long since ripe."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri shuddered involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Understand, Mademoiselle," he continued, "you would by no means
be expected to revisit those gloomy dungeons, which lately inspired
you with such horror and loathing. Olivier would be brought to your
own house, in the night, like a free man; what he should say would
not be listened to; though, of course, there would be a proper guard
with him. He could thus tell you freely and unconstrainedly all he
had to say. As regards any risk which you might run in seeing the
wretched being, my life shall answer for that. He speaks of you with
the deepest veneration; he vows that it is the dark mystery that
prevented him seeing you earlier which has brought him to
destruction. Moreover, it would rest with you entirely to repeat as
much or as little as you pleased of what Brusson confessed to you.
How could you be constrained to more?"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri sat with eyes fixed on the ground,
in deep reflection. It seemed to her that she could not but obey that
Higher Power which demanded of her the clearing up of this
mystery--as if there were no escape for her from the wondrous toils
in which she had become enmeshed against her will.</p>

<p>Coming to a rapid decision, she solemnly replied, "God will give
me self-command and firm resolution. Bring Brusson here; I will see
him."</p>

<p>As on the night when the jewel-casket had been brought, so now at
midnight there came a knocking at the door. Baptiste, duly
instructed, opened. Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri's blood ran cold
when she heard the heavy tread of the guards who had brought Brusson
stationing themselves about the passages.</p>

<p>At length the door opened, Desgrais came in, and after him Olivier
Brusson, without irons, and respectably dressed.</p>

<p>"Here is Brusson, Mademoiselle," said Desgrais, bowing
courteously; he then departed at once.</p>

<p>Brusson sank down on both knees before Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri. The pure, clear expression of a most truthful soul
beamed from his face, though it was drawn and distorted by terror and
bitter pain. The longer she looked at him, the more vivid became a
remembrance of some well-loved person--she could not say whom. When
the first feeling of shuddering left her, she forgot that Cardillac's
murderer was kneeling before her and, speaking in the pleasant tone
of quiet goodwill which was natural to her, said: "Now, Brusson, what
have you to say to me?"</p>

<p>He--still on his knees--sighed deeply, from profound sorrow, and
then said: "Oh, Mademoiselle, you whom I so honour and worship, is
there no trace of recollection of me left in your mind?"</p>

<p>Still looking at him attentively, she answered that she had
certainly detected in his face a likeness to someone whom she had
held in affection, and it was to this that he owed it that she had
overcome her profound horror of a murderer so far as to be able to
listen to him quietly. Much pained by her words, Brusson rose
quickly, and stepped backwards a pace, with his gloomy glance fixed
on the ground.</p>

<p>Then, in a hollow voice, he said: "Have you quite forgotten Anne
Guiot? Her son, Olivier, the boy whom you used to dandle on your
knee, is he who is now before you."</p>

<p>"Oh! For the love of all the Saints!" she cried, covering her face
with both hands and sinking back in her chair. She had reason for
being thus horrified. Anne Guiot, the daughter of a citizen who had
fallen into poverty, had lived with Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri
from her childhood; she had brought her up like a daughter, with all
affection and care. When she grew up, a handsome, well-conducted
young man named Claude Bresson fell in love with her. Being a
first-rate workman at his trade of a watchmaker, sure to make a
capital living in Paris and Anne being very fond of him, Mademoiselle
de Scud&eacute;ri saw no reason to object to their marrying. They set
up house accordingly, lived a most quiet and happy domestic life, and
the bond between them was knitted more closely still by the birth of
a most beautiful boy, the image of his pretty mother.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri made an idol of little Olivier,
whom she would take away from his mother for hours and days, to pet
him and kiss him. Hence he attached himself to her, and was as
pleased to be with her as with his mother. When three years had
passed, the depressed state of Brusson's trade brought it about that
job-work was scarcer every day, so that at last it was all he could
do to get bread to eat. In addition to this came home-sickness for
his beautiful native Geneva so the little household went there, in
spite of Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri's dissuasions and promises of
all needful assistance. Anne wrote once or twice to her
foster-mother, and then ceased; so that Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri thought she was forgotten in the happiness of the
Brussons' life.</p>

<p>It was now just three and twenty years since the Brussons had left
Paris for Geneva.</p>

<p>"Horrible!" cried Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, when she had to
some extent recovered herself, "You, Olivier! the son of my Anne! And
now!"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle!" said Olivier, quietly and composedly, "doubtless
you never thought that the boy whom you cherished like the tenderest
of mothers, whom you dandled on your knee, and to whom you gave
sweetmeats, would when grown to manhood stand before you accused of a
terrible murder. I am completely innocent! The Chambre Ardente
charges me with a crime; but, as I hope to die a Christian's death,
though it may be by the executioner's hand--I am free from all guilt.
Not by my hand--not by any crime of my committing, was it that the
unfortunate Cardillac came to his end."</p>

<p>As he said this, Olivier began to tremble and shake so, that
Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri motioned him to a little seat which
was near him.</p>

<p>"I have had sufficient time," he went on, "to prepare myself for
this interview with you--which I look upon as the last favour of a
merciful Heaven--and to acquire as much calmness and self-control as
are necessary to tell you the story of my terrible, unheard-of
misfortunes. Be so compassionate as to listen to me calmly, whatever
may be your horror at the disclosure of a mystery of which you
certainly have not the smallest inkling. Ah! would to Heaven my poor
father had never left Paris! As far as my recollections of Geneva
carry me, I remember only the tears of my inconsolable parents and my
own tears at the sight of their lamentations, which I was unable to
understand. Later, there came to me a clear sense a full
comprehension--of the bitterest and most grinding poverty, want and
privation in which they were living. My father was deceived in all
his expectations; bowed down and broken with sorrow, he died, just
when he had managed to place me as apprentice with a goldsmith. My
mother spoke much of you; she longed to tell you all her misfortunes,
but the despondency which springs from poverty prevented her. That,
and also, no doubt, false modesty, which often gnaws at a mortally
wounded heart, kept her from carrying out her idea. She followed my
father to the grave a few months after his death."</p>

<p>"Poor Anne! Poor Anne!" said Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri,
overwhelmed by sorrow.</p>

<p>"I thank and praise the Eternal Power that she has gone where she
cannot see her beloved son fall, branded with disgrace, by the hand
of the executioner," cried Olivier loudly, raising a wild and
terrible glance to the skies. Outside there was a sudden agitation; a
sound of people moving about made itself heard. "Ho, ho!" said he,
with a bitter laugh, "Desgrais is waking up his people, as if I could
possibly escape. But, let me go on. My master treated me harshly,
though I was very soon one of the best of workmen and, indeed, much
better than himself. Once a stranger came to our workshop to buy some
of our work.</p>

<p>"When he saw a necklace of my making, he patted my shoulder in a
kind way, and said, looking at the necklace with admiration, 'Ah, ha!
my young friend, this is really first-class work. I don't know
anybody who could beat it but Ren&eacute; Cardillac, who is the
greatest of all goldsmiths, of course. You ought to go to him; he
would be delighted to get hold of you, for there's nobody but
yourself who would be of such use to him; and again, there's nobody
but he who can teach you anything.'</p>

<p>"The words of this stranger sunk deep into my heart. There was no
more peace for me Geneva. I was powerfully impelled to leave it, and
at length I succeeded in getting free from my master. I came to
Paris, where Ren&eacute; Cardillac received me coldly and harshly.
But I stuck to my point. He was obliged to give me something to try
my hand at, however trifling. So I got a ring to finish. When I took
it back to him finished, he gazed at me with those sparkling eyes of
his, as if he would look me through and through. Then he said, 'You
are a first-rate man--a splendid fellow; you may come and work with
me. I'll pay you well; you'll be satisfied with me.' And he kept his
word. I had been several weeks with him before I saw Madelon who, I
think, had been visiting an aunt of his in the country. At last she
came home. O eternal power of Heaven, how was it with me when I saw
that angelic creature! Has ever a man so loved as I! And now! Oh
Madelon!"</p>

<p>Olivier could speak no more for sorrow. He held both hands over
his face, and sobbed violently. At last he conquered the wild pain
with a mighty effort, and went on:</p>

<p>"Madelon looked on me with favour, and came oftener and oftener
into the workshop. Her father watched closely but many a stolen
hand-clasp marked our covenant. Cardillac did not seem to notice. My
idea was, that if I could gain his good-will and attain Master's
rank, I should ask his consent to our marriage. One morning, when I
was going in to begin work, he came to me with anger and contempt in
his face.</p>

<p>"'I don't want any more of your work,' he said. 'Get out of this
house, and don't let my eyes ever rest on you again. I have no need
to tell you the reason. The dainty fruit you are trying to gather is
beyond the reach of a beggar like you!'</p>

<p>"I tried to speak, but he seized me and pitched me out of the door
with such violence that I fell, and hurt my head and my arm. Furious,
and smarting with the pain, I went off, and at last found a
kindhearted acquaintance in the Faubourg St. Germain, who gave me
quarters in his garret. I had no peace nor rest. At night I wandered
round Cardillac's house, hoping that Madelon would hear my sighs and
lamentations, and perhaps manage to speak to me at the window,
undiscovered. All sorts of desperate plans, to which I thought I
might persuade her, jostled each other in my brain. Cardillac's house
in the Rue Ni&ccedil;aise abuts on to a high wall with niches,
containing old, partly-broken statues.</p>

<p>"One night I was standing close to one of those figures, looking
up at the windows of the house which open on the courtyard which the
wall encloses. Suddenly I saw a light in Cardillac's workshop. It was
midnight, and he was never awake at that time, as he always went to
bed exactly at nine. My heart beat anxiously: I thought something
might be going on which would let me get into the house. But the
light disappeared again immediately. I pressed myself closely into
the niche, and against the statue; but I started back in alarm,
feeling a return of my pressure, as if the statue had come to life.
In the faint moonlight I saw that the stone was slowly turning, and
behind it appeared a dark form, which crept softly out and went down
the street with stealthy tread. I sprang to the statue: it was
standing close to the wall again, as before. Involuntarily, as if
impelled by some power within me, I followed the receding dark
figure. In passing an image of the Virgin, this figure looked round,
the light of the lamp before the image falling upon his face. It was
Cardillac! An indescribable fear fell upon me; an eerie shudder came
over me.</p>

<p>"As if driven by some spell, I felt I must follow this
spectre-like sleep-walker--for that was what I thought my master was,
though it was not full moon, the time when that kind of impulse falls
upon sleepers. At length Cardillac disappeared in a deep shadow; but
by a certain easily distinguishable sound I knew that he had gone
into the entry of a house. What was the meaning of this? I asked
myself in amazement; what was he going to do? I pressed myself close
to the wall. Presently there came up a gentleman, trilling and
singing, with a white plume distinct in the darkness, and clanking
spurs. Cardillac darted out upon him from the darkness, like a tiger
on his prey; the man fell to the ground gasping. I rushed up with a
cry of terror. Cardillac was leaning over him as he lay on the
ground.</p>

<p>"'Master Cardillac, what are you about?' I cried aloud. 'Curses
upon you!' he cried and, running by me with lightning speed,
disappeared. Quite out of my senses--scarcely able to walk a step--I
went up to the gentleman on the ground, and knelt down beside him,
thinking it might still be possible to save him. But there was no
trace of life left in him. In my alarm I scarcely noticed that the
Marechauss&eacute;e had come up and surrounded me.</p>

<p>"'Another one laid low by the demons!' they cried, all speaking at
once. 'Ah! ha! youngster! what are you doing here?--are you one of
the band?' and they seized me. I stammered out in the best way I
could that I was incapable of such a terrible deed, and that they
must let me go. Then one of them held a lantern to my face, and said,
with a laugh: 'This is Olivier Brusson; the goldsmith who works with
our worthy Master Ren&eacute; Cardillac. He murder folks in the
street!--very likely story! Who ever heard of a murderer lamenting
over the body, and letting himself be nabbed? Tell us all about it,
my lad; out with it straight.'</p>

<p>"'Right before my eyes,' I said, 'someone sprang out upon this
man, stabbed him and ran off like lightning. I cried as loud as I
could. I tried to see if he could be saved.'</p>

<p>"'No, my son,' cried one of those who had lifted up the body,
'he's done for!--the dagger-stab right through his heart, as usual.'
'The deuce!' said another; 'just too late again, as we were the day
before yesterday.' And they went away with the body.</p>

<p>"What I thought of all this I really cannot tell you. I pinched
myself, to see if I were not in some horrible dream. I felt as if I
must wake up directly, and marvel at the absurdity of what I had been
dreaming. Cardillac--my Madelon's father--an atrocious murderer! I
had sunk down powerless on the stone steps of a house; the daylight
was growing brighter and brighter. An officer's hat with a fine plume
was lying before me on the pavement. Cardillac's deed of blood,
committed on the spot, came clearly back to my mental vision. I ran
away in horror.</p>

<p>"With my mind in a whirl, almost unconscious, I was sitting in my
garret, when the door opened, and Ren&eacute; Cardillac came in. 'For
Christ's sake! what do you want?' I cried. Paying no heed to this,
however, he came up smiling with a calmness and urbanity which
increased my inward horror. He drew forward an old rickety stool, and
sat down beside me; for I was unable to rise from my straw bed, where
I had thrown myself. 'Well, Olivier,' he began, 'how is it with you,
my poor boy? I really was too hasty in turning you out of doors. I
miss you at every turn. Just now I nave a job in hand which I shall
never be able to finish without you; won't you come back and work
with me? You don't answer. Yes, I know very well I insulted you. I
won't pretend that I was not angry about your making up to my
Madelon; but I have been thinking matters well over, and I see that I
couldn't have a better son-in-law than you, with your abilities, your
skill, diligence and trustworthiness. Come back with me, and see how
soon you and Madelon can make a match of it.'</p>

<p>"His words pierced my heart; I shuddered at his wickedness; I
could not utter a syllable.</p>

<p>"'You hesitate,' he said sharply, while his sparkling eyes
transfixed me. 'Perhaps you can't come today. You have other things
to do. Perhaps you want to go and see Desgrais, or have an interview
with D'Argenson or La Regnie. Take care, my boy, that the talons you
are thinking of calling down on others, don't tear you.' At this my
sorely tried spirit found vent.</p>

<p>"'Those,' I said, 'who are conscious of horrible crimes may dread
the names which you have mentioned, but I do not. I have nothing to
do with them.'</p>

<p>"'Remember, Olivier,' he resumed, 'that it is an honour to you to
work with me--the most renowned Master of his time everywhere highly
esteemed for his truth and goodness; any foul calumny would fall back
on the head of its originator. As to Madelon, I must tell you that it
is her alone whom you have to thank for my yielding. She loves you
with a devotion that I should never have believed her capable of. As
soon as you were gone, she fell at my feet, clasped my knees and
vowed with copious tears, that she could never live without you. I
thought this was mere imagination, for those young things always
think they're going to die of love whenever a young wheyface looks at
them a little kindly. But my Madelon really did fall quite sick and
ill; and when I tried to talk her out of the silly nonsense, she
called out your name a thousand times. Last evening I told her I gave
in and agreed to everything, and would go to fetch you today; so this
morning she is blooming again like any rose, and waiting for you,
quite beside herself with longing.'</p>

<p>"May the eternal power of Heaven forgive me, but--I don't know how
it came about--I suddenly found myself in Cardillac's house, where
Madelon, with loud cries of 'Olivier!--my Olivier!--my beloved! my
husband!' clasped both her arms about me, and pressed me to her
heart; whilst I, in the plenitude of my bliss, swore by the Virgin
and all the Saints never, never to leave her."</p>

<p>Overcome by the remembrance of this decisive moment, Olivier was
obliged to pause. Horrified at the crime of a man whom she had looked
on as the incarnation of probity and goodness, Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri cried: "Dreadful!--Ren&eacute; Cardillac a member of
that band of murderers who have so long made Paris into a robbers'
den!"</p>

<p>"A member of the band, do you say, Mademoiselle?" said Olivier.
"There never was any band; it was Ren&eacute; Cardillac alone who
sought and found his victims with such diabolical ingenuity and
activity. It was in the fact of his being alone that his impunity
lay--the practical impossibility of coming upon the murderer's track.
But let me go on. What is coming will clear up the mystery, and
reveal the secrets of the wickedest and at the same time most
wretched of all mankind. You at once see the position in which I now
stood towards my master. The step was taken, and I could not go back.
At times it seemed to me that I had rendered myself Cardillac's
accomplice in murder, and it was only in Madelon's love that I
temporarily forgot the inward pain which tortured me; only in her
society could I drive away all outward traces of the nameless horror.
When I was at work with the old man in the workshop, I could not look
him in the face could--scarcely speak a word--for the horror which
pervaded me in the presence of this terrible being, who fulfilled all
the duties of the tender father and the good citizen, while the night
shrouded his atrocities. Madelon, pure and pious as an angel, hung
upon him with the most idolatrous affection. It pierced my heart when
I thought that, if ever vengeance should overtake this masked
criminal she would be the victim of the most terrible despair. That,
of itself closed my lips, though the consequence of my silence should
be a criminal's death for myself. Although much was to be gathered
from what the Marechauss&eacute;e had said, still Cardillac's crimes,
their motive and the manner in which he carried them out, were a
riddle to me. The solution of it soon came."</p>

<p>"One day Cardillac--who usually excited my horror by laughing and
jesting during our work, in the highest of spirits--was very grave
and thoughtful. Suddenly he threw the piece of work he was engaged on
aside, so that the pearls and other stones rolled about the floor,
started to his feet, and said: 'Olivier! things cannot go on between
us like this; the situation is unendurable What the ablest and most
ingenious efforts of Desgrais and his myrmidons failed to find out,
chance has thrown into your hands. You saw me at my nocturnal work,
to which my Evil Star compels me, so that no resistance is possible
for me; and it was your own Evil Star, moreover which led you to
follow me; which wrapped and hid you in an impenetrable mantle; which
gave that lightness to your footfall that enabled you to move along
with the noiselessness of the smaller animals, so that I--who see
clear by night, as doth the tiger, and hear the smallest sound, the
humming of the gnats, streets away--did not observe you. Your Evil
Star brought you to me, my comrade--my accomplice! You see, now, that
you can't betray me; therefore you shall know all."</p>

<p>"I would have cried out: 'Never, never shall I be your comrade
your accomplice, you atrocious miscreant.' But the inward horror
which I felt at his words paralysed my tongue. Instead of words I
could only utter an unintelligible noise. Cardillac sat down in his
working chair again, wiped the perspiration from his brow, and seemed
to find it difficult to pull himself together, hard beset by the
recollection of the past. At length he began: 'Wise men have much to
say of the strange impulses which come to women when they are
enceinte, and the strange influence which those vivid, involuntary
impulses exercise upon the child. A wonderful tale is told of my
mother. When she was a month gone with me she was looking on, with
other women, at a court pageant at the Trianon, and saw a certain
cavalier in Spanish dress, with a glittering chain of jewels about
his neck, from which she could not remove her eyes. Her whole being
longed for those sparkling stones, which seemed to her more than
earthly. This same cavalier had at a previous time, before my mother
was married, had designs on her virtue, which she rejected with
indignation. She recognised him, but now, irradiated by the light of
the gems, he seemed to her a creature of a higher sphere, the very
incarnation of beauty. The cavalier noticed the longing, fiery looks
which she was bending on him, and thought he was in better luck now
than of old.</p>

<p>"'He managed to get near her, to separate her from her companions,
and entice her to a lonely place. There he clasped her eagerly in his
arms. My mother grasped at the beautiful chain; but at that moment he
fell down, dragging her with him. Whether it was apoplexy, or what, I
do not know; but he was dead. My mother struggled in vain to free
herself from the clasp of the arms, stiffened as they were in death.
With the hollow eyes, whence vision had departed, fixed on her, the
corpse rolled with her to the ground. Her shrieks at length reached
people who were passing at some distance; they hastened to her, and
rescued her from the embrace of this gruesome lover.</p>

<p>"'Her fright laid her on a bed of dangerous sickness. Her life was
despaired of as well as mine; but she recovered, and her confinement
was more prosperous than had been thought possible. But the terrors
of that awful moment had set their mark on me. My Evil Star had
risen, and darted into me those rays which kindled in me one of the
strangest and most fatal of passions. Even in my earliest childhood I
thought there was nothing to compare with glittering diamonds in
golden settings. This was looked upon as a childish fancy; but it was
otherwise, for as a boy I stole gold and jewels wherever I could lay
hands on them, and I knew the difference between good ones and bad,
instinctively, like the most accomplished connoisseur. Only the pure
and valuable attracted me; I would not touch alloyed or coined gold.
Those inborn cravings were kept in check by my father's severe
chastisements; but, so that I might always have to do with gold and
precious stones, I took up the goldsmith's calling. I worked at it
with passion, and soon became the first living master of that art.
Then began a period when the natural bent within me, so long
restrained, shot forth in power, and waxed with might, bearing
everything away before it. As soon as I finished a piece of work and
delivered it, I fell into a state of restlessness and
disconsolateness which prevented my sleeping, ruined my health, and
left me no enjoyment in my life. The person for whom I made the work
haunted me day and night like a spectre. I saw that person
continually before my mental vision, with my beautiful jewels on, and
a voice kept whispering to me: "They belong to you! take them; what's
the use of diamonds to the dead?" At last I betook myself to
thieving. I had access to the houses of the great; I took advantage
quickly of every opportunity. No locks withstood my skill, and I soon
had my work back in my hands again. But this was not enough to calm
my unrest. That mysterious voice made itself heard again, jeering at
me, and saying: "Ho, ho! one of the dead is wearing your jewels." I
did not know whence it came, but I had an indescribable hatred for
all those for whom I made jewellery. More than that, in the depths of
my heart I began to long to kill them; this frightened me. Just then
I bought this house. I had concluded the bargain with the owner: here
in this very room we were sitting, drinking a bottle of wine in
honour of the transaction.'"</p>

<p>"'Night had come on, he was going to leave when he said to me:
"Look here, Ma&icirc;tre Ren&eacute; before I go I must let you into
a secret about this house." He opened that cupboard, which is built
into the wall there, and pushed the back of it in; this let him into
a little closet, where he bowed down and raised a trap-door. This
showed us a steep, narrow stair, which we went down, and at the
bottom of it was a little narrow door, which let us out into the open
courtyard. There he went up to the wall, pushed a piece of iron which
projected a very little, and immediately a piece of the wall turned
round, so that a person could get out through the opening into the
street. You must see this contrivance sometime, Olivier; the sly old
monks of the convent, which this house once was, must have had it
made so as to be able to slip in and out secretly. It is wood but
covered with lime and mortar on the outside, and to the outer side of
it is fitted a statue, also of wood, through looking exactly like
stone, which turns on wooden hinges. When I saw this arrangement,
dark ideas surged up in my mind; it seemed to me that deeds, as yet
mysterious to myself, were here prearranged for.</p>

<p>"'I had just finished a splendid set of ornaments for a gentleman
of the court who, I knew, was going to give them to an opera dancer.
Soon my deadly torture was on me; the spectre dogged my steps, the
whispering devil was at my ear. I went back into the house, bathed in
a sweat of agony; I rolled about on my bed, sleepless. In my mind's
eye I saw the man riding to his dancer with my beautiful jewels. Full
of fury I sprang up, threw my cloak round me, went down the secret
stair, out through the wall into the Rue Ni&ccedil;aise. He came, I
fell upon him, he cried out; but, seizing him from behind, I plunged
my dagger into his heart. The jewels were mine. When this was done, I
felt a peace, a contentment within me which I had never known before.
The spectre had vanished--the voice of the demon was still. Now I
knew what was the behest of my Evil Star, which I had to obey, or
perish.</p>

<p>"'You know all now, Olivier. Don't think that, because I must do
that which I cannot avoid, I have clean renounced all sense of that
mercy or kindly feeling which is the portion of all humanity, and
inherent in man's nature. You know how hard I find it to let any of
my work go out of my hands, many there are to whom I would not bring
death, and for them nothing will induce me to work; indeed, in cases
when I feel that my spectre will have to be exorcised with blood on
the morrow, I settle the business that day by a smashing blow, which
lays the holder of my jewels on the ground, so that I get them back
into my own hands.'</p>

<p>"Having said all this, Cardillac took me into his secret
strong-room and showed me his collection of jewels; the King does not
possess its equal. To each ornament was fastened a small label
stating for whom it had been made, and when taken back--by theft,
robbery, or murder.</p>

<p>"'On your wedding day, Olivier,' he said, in a solemn tone, 'you
will swear me a solemn oath, with your hand on the crucifix, that as
soon as I am dead you will at once convert all these treasures into
dust by a process which I will tell you of. I will not have any human
being, least of all Madelon and you, come into possession of those
stones that have been bought with blood.'</p>

<p>"Shut up in this labyrinth of crime, torn in twain by love and
abhorrence, I was like one of the damned to whom a glorified angel
points, with gentle smile, the upward way, whilst Satan holds him
down with red-hot talons, and the angel's loving smile, reflecting
all the bliss of paradise, becomes, to him, the very keenest of his
tortures I thought of flight, even of suicide, but Madelon! Blame me,
blame me, Mademoiselle, for having been too weak to overcome a
passion which fettered me to my destruction. I shall be atoning for
my weakness by a shameful death. One day Cardillac came in in
unusually fine spirits. He kissed and caressed Madelon, cast most
affectionate looks at me, drank a bottle of good wine at table, which
he only did on high-days and holidays, sang and made merry. Madelon
had left us and I was going to the workshop.</p>

<p>"'Sit still, lad,' cried Cardillac, 'no more work today; let's
drink the health of the most worthy and charming lady in all
Paris.'</p>

<p>"When we had clinked our glasses, and he had emptied a bumper, he
said: 'Tell me, Olivier, how do you like these lines?</p>

<p>"Un amant qui craint les voleurs</p>

<p>N'est point digne d'amour."'</p>

<p>"And he told me what had transpired between you and the King in
Madame de Maintenon's salon, adding that he had always respected you
more than any other human being, and that his reverence and esteem
for your qualities was such that his Evil Star paled before you," and
he would have no fear that, were you to wear the finest piece of his
work that ever he made, the spectre would ever prompt him to thoughts
of murder.</p>

<p>"'Listen, Olivier,' he said, 'to what I am going to do. A
considerable time ago I had to make a necklace and bracelets for
Henrietta of England, supplying the stones myself. I made of this the
best piece of work that ever I turned out, and it broke my heart to
part with the ornaments, which had become the very treasures of my
soul. You know of her unfortunate death by assassination. The things
remained with me, and now I shall send them to Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri, in the name of the dreaded band, as a token of
respect and gratitude. Besides its being an unmistakable mark of her
triumph, it will be a richly deserted sign of my contempt for
Desgrais and his men. You shall take her the jewels.'</p>

<p>"When he mentioned your name, Mademoiselle, dark veils seemed to
be lifted, revealing the bright memory of my happy childhood, which
rose again in glowing colours before me. A wonderful comfort came
into my soul, a ray of hope, driving the dark shadows away. Cardillac
saw the effect his words had produced upon me, and gave it his own
interpretation. 'My idea seems to please you,' he said. 'I must
declare that a deep inward voice, very unlike that which cries for
blood like a raving wild beast, commanded me to do this thing. Many
times I feel the strangest ideas come into my mind--an inward fear,
the dread of something terrible, the awe whereof seems to come
breathing into this present time from some distant other world,
seizes powerfully upon me. I even feel, at such times, that the deeds
which my Evil Star has committed by means of me may be charged to the
account of my immortal soul, though it has no part in them. In one of
those moods I determined that I would make a beautiful diamond crown
for the Virgin in the Church of St. Eustache. But the indescribable
dread always came upon me, stronger than ever, when I set to work at
it, so that I have abandoned it altogether. Now it seems to me that
in presenting Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri with the finest work I
have ever turned out, I am offering a humble sacrifice to goodness
and virtue personified, and imploring their powerful
intercession.'</p>

<p>"Cardillac, well acquainted with all the minutiae of your manner
of life told me how and when to take the ornaments to you. My whole
being rejoiced, for Heaven seemed to be showing me, through the
atrocious Cardillac, the way to escape from the hell in which I was
being tortured. Quite contrary to Cardillac's wish, I resolved that I
would get access to you and speak with you. As Anne Brusson's son and
your former pet, I thought I would throw myself at your feet and tell
you everything. I knew that you would keep the secret, out of
consideration for the unheard-of misery which its disclosure would
bring upon Madelon, but that your grand and brilliant intellect would
be sure to find means to put an end to Cardillac's wickedness without
disclosing it. Do not ask me what those means were to have been; I
cannot tell. But that you would rescue Madelon and me I believed as
firmly as I do in the intercession of the Holy Virgin. You know,
Mademoiselle, that my intention was frustrated that night; but I did
not lose hope of being more fortunate another time.</p>

<p>"By-and-by Cardillac suddenly lost all his good spirits; he crept
moodily about, uttered unintelligible words, and worked his arms as
if warding off something hostile. His mind seemed full of evil
thoughts. For a whole morning he had been going on in this way. At
last he sat down at the worktable, sprang up again angrily, looked
out of window, and then said gravely and gloomily: 'I wish Henrietta
of England had had my jewels.' Those words filled me with terror. I
knew that his diseased mind was again possessed by a terrible lust
for murder, that the voice of the demon was again loud in his ears. I
saw your life threatened by that dread spirit of murder. If Cardillac
could get his jewels back again into his hands you were safe. The
danger grew greater every instant. I met you on the Pont Neuf, made
my way to your carriage, threw you the note which implored you to
give the jewels back to Cardillac immediately. You did not come. My
fear became despair, when next day Cardillac spoke of nothing but the
priceless jewels he had seen last night in his dreams. I could only
suppose that this referred to your jewels, and I felt sure he was
brooding over some murderous attack, which he had determined to carry
out that night. Save you I must, should it cost Cardillac's life.</p>

<p>"After the evening prayer when he had shut himself up in his room
as usual, I got into the courtyard through a window, slipped out
through the opening of the wall, and stationed myself close at hand,
in the deepest shadow. Very soon Cardillac came out, and went gliding
softly down the street. I followed him. He took the direction of the
Rue St. Honor&eacute;. My heart beat fast. All at once he disappeared
from me. I determined to place myself at your door. Just as fate had
ordered matters on the first occasion of my witnessing one of his
crimes, there came along past me an officer, trilling and singing; he
did not see me. Instantly a dark form sprang out and attacked him.
Cardillac! I determined to prevent this murder. I gave a loud shout,
and was on the spot in a couple of paces. Not the officer, but
Cardillac, fell gasping to the ground, mortally wounded. The officer
let his dagger fall, drew his sword, and stood on the defensive,
thinking I was the murderer's accomplice. But he hastened away when
he saw that, instead of concerning myself about him, I was examining
the fallen man. Cardillac was still alive. I took up the dagger
dropped by the officer, stuck it in my belt and, lifting Cardillac on
to my shoulders, carried him with difficulty to the house, and up the
secret stair to the workshop. The rest you know.</p>

<p>"You perceive, Mademoiselle, that my only crime was that I
refrained from giving Madelon's father up to justice, thereby making
an end of his crimes. I am quite innocent of murder. No torture will
draw from me the secret of Cardillac's iniquities. Not through any
action of mine shall that Eternal Power, which has for all this time
hidden from Madelon her father's gruesome crimes, break in upon her
now, to her destruction; nor shall earthly vengeance drag the corpse
of Cardillac out of the soil which covers it, and brand his
mouldering bones with infamy. No; the beloved of my soul shall mourn
me as an innocent victim. Time will mitigate her sorrow for me, but
her grief for her father's terrible crimes nothing would ever
assuage."</p>

<p>Olivier ceased, and a torrent of tears fell down his cheeks. He
threw himself at Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri's feet, saying
imploringly: "You are convinced that I am innocent; I know you are.
Be merciful to me. Tell me how Madelon is faring."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri summoned La Martini&egrave;re, and
in a few minutes Madelon was clinging to Olivier's neck.</p>

<p>"Now that you are here, all is well. I knew that this
noble-hearted lady would save you," Madelon cried over and over
again; and Olivier forgot his fate, and all that threatened him.</p>

<p>He was free and happy. In the most touching manner they bewailed
what each had suffered for the other, and embraced afresh, and wept
for joy at being together again.</p>

<p>Had Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri not been convinced of Olivier's
innocence before, she must have been so when she saw those two lovers
forgetting, in the rapture of the moment, the world, their sufferings
and their indescribable sorrows.</p>

<p>"None but a guiltless heart," she cried, "would be capable of such
blissful forgetfulness."</p>

<p>The morning light came breaking into the room, and Desgrais
knocked gently at the door, reminding them that it was time to take
Olivier away, as it could not be done later without attracting
attention. The lovers had to part.</p>

<p>The dim anticipations which Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri had
felt when Olivier first came in had now embodied themselves in
reality--in a terrible fashion. The son of her much-loved Anne was,
though innocent, implicated in a manner which apparently made it
impossible to save him from a shameful death. She admired his
heroism, which led him to prefer death, loaded with the imputation of
guilt, to the betrayal of a secret which would kill Madelon. In the
whole realm of possibility, she could see no mode of saving the
unfortunate lad from his gruesome prison and the dreadful trial. Yet
it was firmly impressed on her mind that she must not shrink from any
sacrifice to prevent this most crying injustice.</p>

<p>She tortured herself with all kinds of plans and projects, which
were chiefly of the most impracticable and impossible kind--rejected
as soon as formed. Every glimmer of hope grew fainter and fainter,
and she well-nigh despaired. But Madelon's pious, absolute, childlike
confidence, the inspired manner in which she spoke of her lover, soon
to be free and to take her to his heart as his wife, restored
Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri's hopes to some extent.</p>

<p>By way of beginning to do something, she wrote to La Regnie a long
letter, in which she said that Olivier Brusson had proved to her in
the most credible manner his entire innocence of Cardillac's murder,
and that nothing but a heroic resolution to carry to the grave with
him a secret, the disclosure of which would bring destruction upon an
innocent and virtuous person, withheld him from laying a statement
before the Court, which would completely clear him from all guilt and
show that he had never belonged to the band at all. With the best
eloquence at her command, she said everything she could think of
which might be expected to soften La Regnie's hard heart.</p>

<p>He replied to this in a few hours, saying he was very glad that
Olivier had so thoroughly justified himself in the eyes of his kind
patron and protector; but, as for his heroic resolution to carry to
the grave with him a secret relating to the crime with which he was
charged, he regretted that the Chambre Ardente could feel no
admiration for heroism of that description, but must endeavour to
dispel it by powerful means. In three days' time, he had little
doubt, he would be in possession of the wondrous secret, which would
probably bring many strange matters to light.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri knew well what the terrible La
Regnie meant by the "powerful means," which were to break down
Olivier's heroism. It was but too clear that the unfortunate wretch
was threatened with the torture. In her mortal anxiety it at last
occurred to her that, were it only to gain time, the advice of a
lawyer would be of some service.</p>

<p>Pierre Arnaud d'Andilly was at that time the most celebrated
advocate in Paris. His goodness of heart and his highly honourable
character were on a par with his professional skill and his
comprehensive mind. To him she repaired, and told him the whole tale,
as far as it was possible to do so without divulging Olivier's
secret. She expected that d'Andilly would warmly espouse the cause of
this innocent man, but in this she was woefully disappointed. He
listened silently to what she had to say, and then, with a quiet
smile, answered in the words of Boileau, "Le vrai peut quelquefois
n'&ecirc;tre point vraisemblable." He showed her that there were the
most grave and marked suspicions against Olivier; that La Regnie's
action was by no means severe or premature, but wholly regular;
indeed, that to act otherwise would be to neglect his duty as a
Judge. He did not believe that he--d'Andilly--could save Brusson from
the rack, by the very ablest of pleading. Nobody could do that but
Brusson himself, either by making the fullest confession, or by
accurately relating the circumstances of Cardillac's murder, which
might lead to further discoveries.</p>

<p>"Then I will throw myself at the King's feet and sue for mercy,"
cried Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, her voice choked by
weeping.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, do not do that," cried d'Andilly. "Keep that
in reserve for the last extremity. If it fails you once, it is lost
for ever. The King will not pardon a criminal like Brusson; the
people would justly complain of the danger to them. Possibly Brusson
may manage to dispel the suspicion against him, by revealing his
secret, or in some other way. Then would be the time to resort to the
King, who would not ask what was or was not legally proved, but be
guided by his own conviction."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri could not but agree with what
d'Andilly's great experience dictated. She was sitting in her room,
pondering as to what--in the name of the Virgin and all the
saints--she should try next to do, when La Martini&egrave;re came to
say that the Count de Miossens, Colonel of one of the King's Body
Guard, was most anxious to speak with her.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mademoiselle," said the Colonel, bowing with a
soldier's courtesy, "for disturbing you, and breaking in upon you at
such an hour. Two words will be sufficient excuse for me. I come
about Olivier Brusson."</p>

<p>"Olivier Brusson," cried Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, eagerly
anticipating what she was going to hear; "that most unfortunate of
men! What have you to say of him?"</p>

<p>"I knew," said Miossens, laughing again, "that your
prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s name would ensure me a favourable hearing.
Everybody is convinced of Brusson's guilt. I know you think
otherwise, and it is said your opinion rests on what he himself has
told you. With me the case is different. Nobody can be more certain
than I that Brusson is innocent of Cardillac's death."</p>

<p>"Speak! Oh, speak!" cried Mademoiselle Scud&eacute;ri.</p>

<p>"I was the man who stabbed the old goldsmith in the Rue St
Honor&eacute;, close to your door," said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"You--you!" cried Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri. "In the name of
all the Saints, how?"</p>

<p>"And I vow to you, Mademoiselle, that I am very proud of my
achievement. Cardillac, I must tell you, was a most abandoned
hypocritical old ruffian, who went about at night robbing and
murdering people, and was never suspected of anything of the kind. I
don't myself know from whence it came that I felt a suspicion of the
old scoundrel, when he seemed so distressed at handing me over some
work which I had got him to do for me; when he carefully wormed out
of me for whom I designed it, and cross-questioned my valet as to the
times when I was in the habit of going to see a certain lady. It
struck me long ago, that everyone who was murdered by these unknown
hands had the selfsame wound, and I saw quite clearly that the
murderer had practiced to the utmost perfection of certainty that
particular thrust, which must kill instantaneously--and that he
reckoned upon it; so that, if it were to fail, the fight would be
fair. This led me to employ a precaution so very simple and obvious
that I cannot imagine how somebody else did not think of it long ago.
I wore a light breastplate of steel under my dress. Cardillac set
upon me from behind. He grasped me with the strength of a giant, but
his finely directed thrust glided off the steel breastplate. I then
freed myself from his clutch, and planted my dagger in his
heart."</p>

<p>"And you have said nothing?" said Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri.
"You have not told the authorities anything about this?"</p>

<p>"Allow me to point out to you, Mademoiselle," said he, "that to
have done that would have involved me in a most terrible legal
investigation, probably ending in my ruin. La Regnie, who scents out
crime everywhere, would not have been at all likely to believe me at
once, when I accused the good, respectable, exemplary Cardillac of
being an habitual murderer. The sword of Justice would, most
probably, have turned its point against me."</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri. "Your
rank--your position--"</p>

<p>"Oh!" interrupted Miossens, "remember the Mar&eacute;chal de
Luxembourg; he took it into his head to have his horoscope cast by Le
Sage, and was suspected of poisoning, and put in the Bastille. No; by
Saint Dionys! not one moment of freedom--not the tip of one of my
ears, would I trust to that raging La Regnie, who would be delighted
to put his knife to all our throats."</p>

<p>"But this brings an innocent man to the scaffold," said
Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri.</p>

<p>"Innocent, Mademoiselle!" cried Miossens. "Do you call Cardillac's
accomplice an innocent man? He who assisted him in his crimes, and
has deserved death a hundred times? No, in verity; he suffers justly;
although I told you the true state of the case in the hope that you
might somehow make use of it in the interests of your
prot&eacute;g&eacute;, without bringing me into the clutches of the
Chambre Ardente."</p>

<p>Delighted at having her conviction of Olivier's innocence
confirmed in such a decided manner, Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri
had no hesitation in telling the Count the whole affair, since he
already knew all about Cardillac's crimes, and in begging him to go
with her to d'Andilly, to whom everything should be communicated
under the seal of secrecy and who should advise what was next to be
done.</p>

<p>When Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri had told him at full length
all the circumstances, D'Andilly inquired again into the very
minutest particulars. He asked Count Miossens if he was quite
positive as to its having been Cardillac who attacked him, and if he
would recognise Olivier as the person who carried away the body.</p>

<p>"Not only," said Miossens, "was the moon shining brightly, so that
I recognised the old goldsmith perfectly well, but this morning, at
La Regnie's, I saw the dagger with which he was stabbed. It is mine;
I know it by the ornamentation of the handle. And as I was within a
pace of the young man, I saw his face quite distinctly, all the more
because his hat had fallen off. As a matter of course I should know
him in a moment."</p>

<p>D'Andilly looked before him meditatively for a few moments, and
said: "There is no way of getting Brusson out of the hands of justice
by any ordinary means. On Madelon's account, nothing will induce him
to admit that Cardillac was a robber and a murderer. And even were he
to do so, and succeed in proving the truth of it by pointing out the
secret entrance and the collection of stolen jewels, death would be
his own lot, as an accomplice. The same consequence would follow if
Count Miossens related to the judges the adventure with Cardillac.
Delay is what we must aim at. Let Count Miossens go to the
Conciergerie, be confronted with Olivier, and recognise him as the
person who carried off Cardillac's body; let him then go to La Regnie
and say, 'I saw a man stabbed in the Rue St. Honor&eacute;, and was
close to the body when another man darted up, bent down over it, and
finding life still in it, took it on his shoulders and carried it
away. I recognised Olivier Brusson as that man.'</p>

<p>"This will lead to a further examination of Brusson, to his being
confronted with Count Miossens; the torture will be postponed, and
further investigations made. Then will be the time to have recourse
to the King. Your brilliant intellect, Mademoiselle, will point out
the most fitting way to do this. I think it would be best to tell His
Majesty the whole story. Count Miossens' statement will support
Olivier's. Perhaps, too, an examination of Cardillac's house would
help matters. The King might then follow the bent of his own
judgment--of his kind heart, which might pardon where justice could
only punish." Count Miossens closely followed D'Andilly's advice, and
everything fell out just as he had said it would.</p>

<p>It was now time to repair to the King; and this was the chief
difficulty of all, as he had such an intense horror of Brusson--whom
he believed to be the man who had for so long kept Paris in a state
of terror--that the least allusion to him threw him at once into the
most violent anger. Madame de Maintenon, faithful to her system of
never mentioning unpleasant subjects to him, declined all
intermediation; so that Brusson's fate was entirely in Mademoiselle
de Scud&eacute;ri's hands. After long reflection, she hit upon a
scheme which she put into execution at once. She put on a heavy black
silk dress, with Cardillac's jewels, and a long black veil, and
appeared at Madame de Maintenon's at the time when she knew the King
would be there. Her noble figure in this mourning garb excited the
reverential respect even of those frivolous persons who pass their
days in Court antechambers. They all made way for her and, when she
came into the presence, the King himself rose, astonished, and came
forward to meet her.</p>

<p>The splendid diamonds of the necklace and bracelets flashed in his
eyes, and he cried: "By Heavens! Cardillac's work!" Then, turning to
Madame de Maintenon, he said, with a pleasant smile, "See, Madame la
Marquise, how our fair lady mourns for her affianced husband."</p>

<p>"Ah, Sire!" said Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, as if keeping up
the jest, "it would ill become a mourning bride to wear such bravery.
No; I have done with the goldsmith; nor would I remember him, but
that the gruesome spectacle of his corpse carried off before my eyes
keeps coming back to my memory."</p>

<p>"What!" said the King, "did you actually see him, poor
fellow?"</p>

<p>She then told him in few words (not introducing Brusson into the
business at all) how chance had brought her to Cardillac's door just
when the murder had been discovered. She described Madelon's wild
terror and sorrow; the impression made upon her by the beautiful
girl; how she had taken her out of Desgrais's hands and borne her
away amid the applause of the crowd. The scenes with La Regnie, with
Desgrais, with Olivier Brusson himself, now followed, the interest
constantly increasing. The King, carried away by the vividness with
which Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri told the tale, did not notice
that the Brusson case, which he so abominated, was in question,
listened breathlessly, occasionally expressing his interest by an
ejaculation. And ere he was well aware, still amazed by the marvels
which he was hearing, not yet able to arrange them all in his mind,
behold! Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri was at his feet, imploring
mercy for Olivier Brusson.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" broke out the King, seizing both her hands
and making her sit down. "This is a strange way of taking us by
storm. It is a most terrible story! Who is to answer for the truth of
Brusson's extraordinary tale?"</p>

<p>"Miossens' deposition proves it," she cried; "the searching of
Cardillac's house; my own firm conviction, and, ah! Madelon's pure
heart, which recognises equal purity in poor Brusson."</p>

<p>The King, about to say something, was interrupted by a noise in
the direction of the door. Louvois, who was at work in the next room,
put his head in with an anxious expression. The King rose, and
followed him out. Both Madame de Maintenon and Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri thought this interruption of evil augury; for, though
once surprised into interest, the King might take care not to fall
into the snare a second time. But he came back in a few minuses,
walked quickly up and down the room two or three times; and then,
pausing with his hands behind his back before Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri, he said, in a half-whisper, without looking at her:
"I should like to see this Madelon of yours."</p>

<p>On this Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri said: "Oh! gracious Sire!
what a marvellous honour you vouchsafe to the poor unfortunate child.
She will be at your feet in an instant."</p>

<p>She tripped to the door as quickly as her heavy dress allowed, and
called to those in the anteroom that the King wished to see Madelon
Cardillac. She came back weeping and sobbing with delight and
emotion. Having expected this, she had brought Madelon with her,
leaving her to wait with the Marquise's maid, with a short petition
in her hand drawn up by D'Andilly. In a few moments she had
prostrated herself, speechless, at the King's feet. Awe, confusion,
shyness, love and sorrow sent the blood coursing faster and faster
through her veins; her cheeks glowed, her eyes sparkled with the
bright tear-drops, which now and again fell from her silken lashes
down upon her beautiful lily-white breast. The King was moved by the
wonderful beauty of the girl. He raised her gently, and stooped down
as if about to kiss her hand, which he had taken in his; but he let
the hand go, and gazed at her with tears in his eyes, evincing deep
emotion.</p>

<p>Madame de Maintenon whispered to Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri,
"Is she not exactly like La Valli&egrave;re, the little thing? The
King is indulging in the sweetest memories: you have gained the
day."</p>

<p>Though she spoke softly, the King seemed to hear.</p>

<p>A blush came to his cheek; he scanned Madame de Maintenon with a
glance, and then said, gently and kindly: "I am quite sure that you,
my dear child, think your lover is innocent; but we must hear what
the Chambre Ardente has to say."</p>

<p>A gentle wave of his hand dismissed Madelon, bathed in tears.
Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri saw, to her alarm, that the
resemblance to La Valli&egrave;re, advantageous as it had seemed to
be at first, had nevertheless changed the King's intention as soon as
Madame de Maintenon had spoken of it. Perhaps he felt himself
somewhat ungently reminded that he was going to sacrifice strict
justice to beauty; or he may have been like a dreamer who, when
loudly addressed by his name, finds that the beautiful, magic visions
by which he thought he was surrounded vanish away. Perhaps he no
longer saw his La Valli&egrave;re before him, but thought only of
Soeur Louise de la Mis&eacute;ricorde--La Valli&egrave;re's cloister
name among the Carmelite nuns--paining him with her piety and
repentance. There was nothing for it now but to wait patiently for
the King's decision.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Count Miossens' statement before the Chambre Ardente had
become known; and, as often happens, popular opinion soon flew from
one extreme to the other, so that the person whom it had stigmatized
as the most atrocious of murderers, and would fain have torn in
pieces before he reached the scaffold, was now bewailed as the
innocent victim of a barbarous sacrifice. His old neighbours now only
remembered his admirable character and behaviour, his love for
Madelon, and the faithfulness and devotion of body and soul with
which he had served his master. Crowds of people, in threatening
temper, often collected before La Regnie's Palais, crying, "Give us
out Olivier Brusson!--he is innocent!", even throwing stones at the
windows, so that La Regnie had to seek the protection of the
Marechauss&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Many days elapsed without Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri's hearing
anything on the subject of Olivier Brusson. In her anxiety she went
to Madame de Maintenon, who said the King was keeping silence on the
subject, and it was not advisable to remind him of it. When she then,
with a peculiar smile, asked after the "little La Valli&egrave;re,"
Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri saw that this proud lady felt, in the
depths of her heart, some slight annoyance at a matter which had the
power of drawing the fickle King into a province whose charm was
beyond her own sphere. Consequently nothing was to be hoped from
Madame de Maintenon.</p>

<p>At length Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri managed to find out, with
D'Andilly's help, that the King had had a long interview with Count
Miossens; further, that Bontems, the King's confidential groom of the
chamber and secret agent, had been to the Conciergerie, and spoken
with Brusson; that, finally, the said Bontems, with several other
persons, had paid a long visit to Cardillac's house. Claude Patru,
who lived in the lower story, said he had heard banging noises above
his head in the night, and that he had recognised Olivier's voice
amongst others. So far it was certain that the King was, himself,
causing the matter to be investigated; but what was puzzling was the
long delay in coming to a decision. La Regnie was most probably
trying all in his power to prevent his prey from slipping through his
fingers; and this nipped all hope in the bud.</p>

<p>Nearly a month had elapsed, when Madame de Maintenon sent to tell
Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri that the King wished to see her that
evening in her salon. Her heart beat fast. She knew that Olivier's
fate would be decided that night. She told Madelon so, and the latter
prayed to the Virgin and all the Saints that Mademoiselle de
Scud&eacute;ri might succeed in convincing the King of her lover's
innocence.</p>

<p>And yet it appeared as if he had forgotten the whole affair, for
he passed the time in chatting pleasantly with Madame de Maintenon
and Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, without a single word of poor
Olivier Brusson.</p>

<p>At length Bontems appeared, approached the King, and spoke a few
words so softly that the ladies could not hear them.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri trembled; but the King rose, went
up to her, and said, with beaming eyes: "I congratulate you,
Mademoiselle. Your prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Olivier Brusson, is
free."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, with tears streaming down her
cheeks, unable to utter a word, would have cast herself at the King's
feet; but he prevented her, saying: "Come, Come! Mademoiselle, you
ought to be my Attorney-General and plead my causes, for nobody on
earth can resist your eloquence and powers of persuasion. He who is
shielded by virtue," he added more gravely, "may snap his fingers at
every accusation, by the Chambre Ardente, or any other tribunal on
earth."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri, now finding words, poured forth a
most glowing tribute of gratitude. But the King interrupted her,
saying there were warmer thanks awaiting her at home than any he
could expect from her, as at that moment doubtless Olivier was
embracing his Madelon. "Bontems," added His Majesty, "will hand you a
thousand Louis, which you will give the little one from me as a
wedding portion. Let her marry her Brusson, who does not deserve such
a treasure, and then they must both leave Paris. That is my
will."</p>

<p>La Martini&egrave;re came to meet her mistress with eager steps,
followed by Baptiste, their faces beaming with joy, and both crying
out: "He is here! he is free! Oh, the dear young couple!"</p>

<p>The happy pair fell at Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri's feet, and
Madelon cried: "Ah! I knew that you, and you only, would save my
husband."</p>

<p>"You have been my mother," cried Olivier, "my belief in you never
wavered." They kissed her hands, and shed many tears; and then they
embraced again, and vowed that the heavenly bliss of that moment was
worth all the nameless sufferings of the days that were past.</p>

<p>In a few days the priest pronounced his blessing upon them. Even
had it not been the King's command that they were to leave Paris,
Brusson could not have remained there, where everything reminded him
of the dreadful epoch of Cardillac's atrocities, and where any
accident might have disclosed the evil secret, already known to
several persons, and destroyed the peace of his life for ever.
Immediately after the wedding he started with his young wife for
Geneva, sped on his way by Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri's
blessings. Handsomely provided with Madelon's portion, his own skill
at his calling, and every civic virtue, he there led a happy life,
without a care. The hopes, whose frustration had sent the father to
his grave, were fulfilled in the son.</p>

<p>A year after Brusson left Paris, a public proclamation, signed by
Harloy de Chauvalon, Archbishop of Paris, and by Pierre Arnaud
D'Andilly, Advocate of the Parliament, appeared, stating that a
repentant sinner had, under seal of confession, made over to the
Church a valuable stolen treasure of gold and jewels. All those who,
up to about the end of the year 1680, had been robbed of property of
this description, particularly if by murderous attack in the street,
were directed to apply to D'Andilly, when they would receive it back,
provided that anything in the said collection agreed with the
description to be by them given, and provided that there was no doubt
of the genuineness of the application. Many whose names occurred in
Cardillac's list as having been merely stunned, not murdered, came
from time to time to D'Andilly to reclaim their property, and
received it back, to their no small surprise. The remainder became
the property of the Church of St. Eustache.</p>
