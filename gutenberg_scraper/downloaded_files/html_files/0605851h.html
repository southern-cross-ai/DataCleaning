<h1>The Devil Stone</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Beatrice Heron-Maxwell</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>It was in the dusky, tepid twilight of a particularly hot,
vaporous, drowsy day at Aix-les-bains, in Savoy, that I passed
through the hotel garden, and prepared to take a languid stroll
through the streets of the little town. I was tired of having nothing
to do and no one to talk to; the other people staying at the Hotel de
l'Europe were mostly foreigners, and, apart from that, entirely
uninteresting; and as to my father, he was almost a nonentity to me
at present, till his "course" was completed. From early morn to dewy
eve he was immersed in the waters, either outwardly or inwardly, or
both; and beyond occasional glimpses of him, arrayed in a costume
resembling that of an Arab sheikh, being conveyed in pomp and a sedan
chair to or from the baths, I was, figuratively speaking, an orphan
until table d' h&ocirc;te.</p>

<p>As I crossed the verandah some one rose from a long chair, and,
throwing his book down, said, "Where are you going, Miss Durant? May
I come too?"</p>

<p>"If you like," I answered, politely but indifferently; "I am only
going to look for spoons."</p>

<p>"For--?"</p>

<p>"Spoons. I am collecting, you know; it is something to do--and one
can always give them away when one is tired of them."</p>

<p>So we sauntered along, side by side; and as we did so I began to
feel less bored, and more reconciled to the trouble of existence, and
finally amused and interested and flattered.</p>

<p>For this quiet-looking middle-aged man--to whom my father had
introduced me two days before, as an old friend of his, and whom I
had mentally summed tip as "Rather handsome, clever perhaps,
conceited possibly, and married probably"--was making himself
agreeable as only a cultivated, polished man of the world, who wishes
to make a favourable impression, can; and gradually I found myself
acknowledging that his dark, intellectual face, with its crown of
waving, iron-grey hair, was something more than handsome, and that
his cleverness was suflicient to carry him beyond conceit, while
apparently it did not set him above a very evident enjoyment of a
girl's society and conversation. He had already learnt most of my
tastes and occupations, and drawn from me, by a magnetic sympathy,
some confessions as to my inmost thoughts and aspirations, telling me
in return that he was travelling wearily in search of rest,
authoritatively ordered by his doctor; and he was deploring his
lonely bachelorhood, when my attention was attracted by some quaint
spoons half hidden amongst other dull silver things in a
forsaken-looking little shop to which our wanderings had led us
through narrow, dingy byways.</p>

<p>"I wonder how much they are," I said; and, asking me to wait
outside, Colonel Haughton disappeared into the obscure interior. I
remained gazing through the window for a moment, then, impelled by
what idle impulse I know not, I walked slowly on.</p>

<p>The sound of a casement opening just over my head and a feminine
laugh arrested me, and I looked up. It was a curious laugh, low and
controlled, but with a malicious mockery in it that seemed a fit
ending to some scathing speech; and just inside the open lattice, her
arms resting on the sill and chin dropped lightly on her clasped
hands, leant the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. It was but a
glimpse of auburn hair on a white forehead, of eyes like brown
pansies, and parted lips that looked like scarlet petals against the
perfect pallor of her rounded cheeks, but it is photographed for ever
on my brain. For, as I looked, a man's hand and arm, brown, lean, and
very supple, with nervous fingers, on one of which a green stone
flashed, clutching a poniard, came round her neck, and plunged the
dagger, slanting-wise, deep down into her heart. The smile on the
beautiful lips quivered and fixed, but no sound came from them, and
the eyes turned up and closed; and as she swayed towards the open
window, the spell that was upon me broke, and with a shuddering cry I
fled. On, on--blindly, madly, desperately--with no sense or thought
or feeling save an overwhelming horror. A red mist seemed to close
round me and wall me in, and as I fought against it I felt my
strength fail, and all was dark and still.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the darkness a voice speaking, the touch of a hand on
my face, a glimpse of light, a sense of pain that some one was
suffering, then consciousness and memory. My father's anxious face
bent over me, and his voice, as though from a distance, said, "Theo,
are you better, dear? No, don't get up--rest, and take this." And,
sinking back, I vaguely understood that I was in my own room at the
hotel, and that a stranger, a doctor no doubt, was present. He
enjoined absolute quiet till he saw me again, and asked that he
should be informed at once if there was any recurrence of fainting.
Later, when I was in a condition to explain the origin of this
attack, he would be able to prescribe for me. The light of dawn was
struggling through the curtains, and I knew that I must have been
unconscious for many hours. With the effort to banish all
recollections of the terrible scene I had witnessed, came lethargy,
and later, deep and dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>Some days of seclusion and rest partially restored my health and
spirits, and I began to feel that what had passed had been a sort of
evil dream, a terror that were best forgotten. My father when he
heard my story was at first incredulous; then, impressed in spite of
himself by my earnestness, he gave an unwilling belief to it, but he
entreated me to mention it to no one save himself. He could find no
account of a murder in the local papers, nor could he ascertain
whether the tragedy I saw was known to have taken place, and as be
did not wish my name to be introduced in any inquiry he allowed the
matter to drop. To him I spoke of it no more, but the remembrance of
it would not be wholly banished. I was haunted by the sight of that
lovely face, and the sound of that laugh with its dreadful sequel.
And a strange fancy had come to me also that the face was in some way
familiar to me; I would lie with closed eyes for hours, seeking in
vain to recall the resemblance that just eluded me. One day
meditating thus I roused myself from my reverie, and met my own
reflection in a mirror that hung opposite. Breathless I gazed, while
a new terror took possession of me. There was the resemblance I had
sought: there were the auburn hair, the deep dark eyes, the
colourless face with scarlet lips just parted. Not so beautiful,
perhaps, as the ofle I had seen at the window; indeed, as I gradually
comprehended it was myself I gazed upon, I could see no beauty in the
familiar features; but so like--so wonderfully, terribly like! And
then for the first time I began to doubt the reality of my vision,
and to long eagerly for the power to put it from me. I determined to
rest and dream no longer, and that afternoon I descended to the
garden.</p>

<p>"At last!" said Colonel Haughton, taking both my hands. "I thought
we were never going to see you again. I have been reproaching myself
with having overtired you that day--with having left you: I had no
intention of remaining away from you for more than a moment, and I
want to explain what detained me. When I came out and found you gone,
I concluded you had returned here, and hurrying on I was fortunate
enough to reach you just before you fainted. Your father tells me you
have had a touch of malaria, and I hope---But I distress you, Miss
Durant; I am tiring you. Let me find you a comfortable chair and
leave you to rest."</p>

<p>"No, no," I cried eagerly; "stay;--I will sit here. Tell me, where
did you get that ring?"</p>

<p>On his finger shone a curious green stone, that seemed the
counter-part of the one I had noticed on the hand that held the
dagger.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I want to tell you," he said. "After getting
your spoons for you, I noticed, resting on a carved bracket, this
ring. It is a very curious stone. You see it looks quite dull now,
yet it can sparkle with all the brilliancy of a diamond. And on the
back of it is cut part of the head of a snake. I have only seen a
ring like this once before, and that was long ago in a hill temple in
India. They called it the Devil Stone, and worshipped it, and they
told me the tradition of it. Centuries before, this stone had been
discovered by a holy man, embedded in a sacred relic, and he made a
shrine for it, whence it was stolen by robbers. The next stage in its
history was its division into two equal parts by a Maharajah, who had
them set into rings, one of which he wore always himself, and the
other he bestowed on his Maharanee, whom he loved greatly. One day he
found it missing from her finger, and in a fit of jealousy he killed
her, afterwards destroying himself. His ring passed into the
possession of the Brahmins, but hers could never be traced."</p>

<p>"They say that eventually the two will be reunited, and that until
this happens the lost ring will fufil its mission. It is supposed to
impel its wearer to deeds of violence, and to his own destruction;
and when the evil spirit within it is gratified, it flashes and
sparkles. They say, too, that if you cast it from you, you throw away
with it the greatest happiness of your life and lose the chance of it
for ever. Yet, if you wear it, it dominates your fate. The instant I
saw it, I recognised the lost ring, and asked the man his price for
it. He refused to tell me--said it was not for sale; and I left the
shop, because I did not wish to keep you waiting longer; but I
returned next day, and succeeded in obtaining it. The old man, a
curious old Italian, was very reticent about it, but he seemed to
have gathered some knowledge of the tradition, and said it had the
"evil eye," and was neither good to sell nor to wear. It had been
sold to him by a compatriot, he said, who had a dark history--a man
who was ever too ready with his knife, and who had come to a bad end.
I told him I would steal it, and he might charge me what he liked for
some other purchases, so we settled it that way."</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid to wear it?" I asked. "It makes me shudder to
look at it. There is some deadly fascination about it, I am
sure."</p>

<p>"I am afraid of nothing," he said lightly, "except your
displeasure, Miss Theo. If it annoys you I will not wear it, but I
confess it has a very great fascination for me. I do not believe in
superstition, but I like the stone for its antiquity and strange
history. Some day I will send it to my friends the Brahmins;
meanwhile it inspires me with no evil propensity, and since it has
interested you I am grateful to it so far."</p>

<p>So I resolved to put the ring and its story out of my mind, and to
occupy myself only with the new interest that had dawned upon my
life. The next few days went by so happily, and it seemed so natural
to me that Lionel Haughton should be always at my side, that I did
not stay to ask myself the reason for our close companionship--yet I
think within my heart of hearts I knew.</p>

<p>And each day, each hour I spent with him, was bringing us nearer
together and binding us with ties that would not easily be
broken.</p>

<p>"Haughton is very much improved," said my father one day, "since I
knew him many years ago--his brother was my great friend, and I did
not, see much of this one--he seems to have spent a good deal of his
life in India, and I fancy it has affected his health. I suppose he
won't return there. I must persuade him to come and pay us a visit
when we go home, eh, Theo?"</p>

<p>One evening, when our stay was drawing to a close, we proposed to
go to the Casino, where I wished to try my luck at gambling. "I am
always lucky if things go by chance," I said, "and I have neglected
my opportunity here sadly. Let us go and gamble tonight, and I will
win fortunes for all of us." Colonel Haughton did not, however, join
us as usual at table d'h&ocirc;te that evening, and a note handed to
me afterwards from him told me that he had been feeling ill, but was
now better, and would meet us later at the Casino. It was the first
time I had ever played, and before long it became apparent that my
prophecy about my luck was being fulfilled: I won, and won, and won
again, till a heap of gold and notes was in front of me, and I was
the centre of all eyes at the table. I played recklessly, and yet I
could not lose, till suddenly my attention was distracted by the
arrival of Colonel Haughton, who leant over my shoulder and placed
his stake next to mine. As he did so the ring seemed me to emit a
faint sparkle, and I felt as if my careless good fortune had deserted
me. I wanted to win now, whereas before I had played for the
excitement only, with the true gambler spirit. And yet from that
moment I lost. He also lost, heavily--so heavily that I wondered if
he were rich enough to take it as philosophically as he appeared
to.</p>

<p>Nevertheless so large a sum had I won at first that, though much
diminished, it was still a small fortune that I gathered up when we
left the tables.</p>

<p>"You brought me bad luck," I said to Colonel Haughton, as we
walked back to the hotel. "Do you know, I think it was your
ring."</p>

<p>"I would never wear it again if I thought that," he answered. Then
as we reached the garden, and my father passed on to the salon,
"Theo," he continued, "stay a moment. I have something to tell you My
darling, I love you; I love you more than life: will you try to care
for me a little in return? I want you for my wife. I worship
you!"</p>

<p>Ah, Lionel! beloved! it scarcely needed the assurance of your love
for me to bring me the certainty of mine for you! If ever the gates
of Heaven open to mortal eyes, they stood ajar for us that night; the
starlit garden was changed into a veritable Eden, and we walked with
wondering joy therein, and thought not of an angel with flaming
sword, who waited silently to drive us from our Paradise into outer
darkness.</p>

<p>It was scarcely noon, the following day, when we began the ascent
of the Dent du Chat, one of the mountain peaks that tower above
Aix.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I had wings, and must soar into a higher
atmosphere," I had said gaily; "and since we cannot fly, let us
climb. I want to reach the top of that mountain with you, and leave
the world behind us. Let us go."</p>

<p>We were to ride up to a certain distance, and then dismount and
gain the highest point on foot.</p>

<p>Three guides accompanied us, following leisurely, talking and
gesticulating to each other, and paying little heed to us, save an
occasional frantic rush at the mules when we approached an awkward
corner of the zigzag pathway, which had the effect of adding a
momentary uncertainity and danger to our otherwise tranquil ascent.
We were not sorry when, after two or three hours of this progress,
the guides told us we must halt, and that they would remain in charge
of the mules till we returned to them. It was rather a toilsome
climb, and the sun was beating fiercely down upon us; but we felt
rewarded when, not far from the top, we reached a plateau where we
could rest, while a cool breeze from the distant snowy peaks revived
us.</p>

<p>"Here is an arm-chair all ready for you," Lionel said, leading me
to where a soft couch of mossy turf lay beneath the shadow of an
upright, projecting piece of rock. A yard or two farther on, the
precipitous side of the mountain descended, sheer and impassable down
almost to its foot, terminating in a dark and narrow gorge between
two ridges. Away on the left far below us nestled Aix, and by its
side the Lac du Bourget, with its island monastery surrounded by
water as blue as Geneva's own.</p>

<p>"How lovely it is!" I exclaimed; "I never knew before how
beautiful life could be."</p>

<p>"Nor I," he answered; "I have been waiting for my wife to teach
me." And then he told me of his life in India, and of many adventures
he had had, and finally we spoke again of the ring and of my strange
and sudden illness on that day.</p>

<p>"Some day I will tell you all about it," I said, "and why I have
such a curious feeling against the ring. I wish you would not wear
it; yet now that you possess it I have a sort of superstitious dread
that if you part from it, it will revenge itself upon you in some
way. I am sure I saw it sparkle last night when the cards went
against us. You were so terribly unlucky."</p>

<p>"Unlucky at cards, lucky in love," he quoted; but I noticed a
shadow on his face. "What have you done with all your wealth, little
gambler?--you have not had time to spend it yet."</p>

<p>"Here it is," I answered, drawing out my pocket-book, in which I
had stuffed the notes; "but I have taken a dislike to it--I shall
give it away, I think. I would rather be lucky in another way. "</p>

<p>and I laid it down beside me on the grass.</p>

<p>"I will send the ring to India on my wedding day," Lionel
exclaimed; "till then will you wear it for me?" and, drawing it from
his finger, he was about to place it upon mine.</p>

<p>But I would not allow him to do so, and laying it on the bank
notes I said, "There's a contradiction! Good luck and bad luck side
by side! Let us leave them there," I added, half laughing, half in
earnest, "and start again fresh."</p>

<p>He turned suddenly away, and, fearing he was vexed, I laid my hand
upon his arm; but he shook it gently off and then I saw he was
singularly pale, and that his breathing was quick and short, and his
eyes had a strangely troubled and intent look. "Lionel, you are ill,"
I cried. "Oh, what is it, love? what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"It is nothing," he said faintly, but his voice was changed: "it
will pass off. I will return to the guides and get some water. Wait
here till I come back."</p>

<p>"Let me come with you," I entreated, but he shook his head, and
said he was better and would be quite well if I would do as he
wished; then he began the descent. I watched him for a few moments,
till he was lost to view at a bend of the mountain, before returning
to my seat. But the sun had gone in, and it seemed cold and dark, and
a dull heavy weight rested on my heart. I was lonely there without
him, and the moments dragged on slowly and drearily, till I felt the
suspense and stillness unendurable.</p>

<p>I decided I would wait only five minutes more and then I would
follow him, and, leaning back wearily, I closed my eyes. A sort of
faintness came over me--for I was tired, and the sudden change from
perfect happiness to this anxiety, this vague alarm, had chilled and
stupefied me.</p>

<p>It may have been a few moments after, or longer (I cannot tell),
but I became aware suddenly that, although no sound of footsteps had
reached me, there was some one near. I remained absolutely still and
listened intently, and though there was no tangible movement or
sound, there was an impalpable stir in the stillness round me, some
vague breath that seemed to speak of danger. I felt paralysed with
the same powerlessness that had seized me when the tragedy at the
window was enacted before my eyes. It flashed into my mind that
perhaps it was a thief, attracted by the notes and ring lying beside
me, who had crept behind believing that I slept. My hand was almost
touching them, and as I glanced down to see if I could reach them
without moving, I noticed with a thrill of indescribable horror that
the green stone was sparkling brilliantly with a thousand rays of
scintillating light.</p>

<p>And then--something stirred behind me, and round my neck crept a
hand, holding a short sharp knife such as Indians carry, and poised
it over my heart as if to strike. With an instantaneous desperate
throb of agonised revolt against my impending fate, I grasped the
ring and flung it towards the precipice. As it flashed through the
air the knife dropped, and the murderer sprang to the edge in a vain
effort to catch the stone ere it fell. He stumbled, missed his
footing, and, with one terrible cry and his hands grasping the air
wildly, he fell backwards into the abyss.</p>

<p>And it was Lionel--my beloved!</p>

<p>When the guides came to look for us I told them smilingly that the
English gentleman had dropped his ring and in trying to find it had
slipped and fallen over the precipice.</p>

<p>They led me down the mountain with reverent care and hushed steps
and voices; for they said to each other, "Figure to yourself this
English colonel was in love with the beautiful young lady, and he has
perished before her eyes,--it is a terrible thing, and it has turned
her brain."</p>

<p>And when my father told me gently, some days after, that they had
found him and he was to be buried that day in the little cemetery, I
laughed outright.</p>

<p>But I have never smiled since--and I am quite sane now--only I
think I have done with laughter for the rest of my life. And I
some-times wonder why these things should have been; and if there is
any explanation of them, save one.</p>

<h3>THE END</h3>
