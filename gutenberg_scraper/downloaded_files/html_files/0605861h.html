<h1>The Flayed Hand</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Guy De Maupassant</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>One evening about eight months ago I met with some college
comrades at the lodgings of our friend Louis R. We drank punch and
smoked, talked of literature and art, and made jokes like any other
company of young men. Suddenly the door flew open, and one who had
been my friend since boyhood burst in like a hurricane.</p>

<p>"Guess where I come from?" he cried.</p>

<p>"I bet on the Mabille," responded one. "No," said another, "you
are too gay; you come from borrowing money, from burying a rich
uncle, or from pawning your watch." "You are getting sober," cried a
third, "and, as you scented the punch in Louis' room, you came up
here to get drunk again."</p>

<p>"You are all wrong," he replied. "I come from P., in Normandy,
where I have spent eight days, and whence I have brought one of my
friends, a great criminal, whom I ask permission to present to
you."</p>

<p>With these words he drew from his pocket a long, black hand, from
which the skin had been stripped. It had been severed at the wrist.
Its dry and shriveled shape, and the narrow, yellowed nails still
clinging to the fingers, made it frightful to look upon. The muscles,
which showed that Its first owner had been possessed of great
strength, were bound in place by a strip of parchment-like skin.</p>

<p>"Just fancy," said my friend, "the other day they sold the effects
of an old sorcerer, recently deceased, well known in all the country.
Every Saturday night he used to go to witch gatherings on a
broomstick; he practised the white magic and the black, gave blue
milk to the cows, and made them wear tails like that of the companion
of Saint Anthony. The old scoundrel always had a deep affection for
this hand, which, he said, was that of a celebrated criminal,
executed in 1736 for having thrown his lawful wife head first into a
well--for which I do not blame him--and then hanging in the belfry
the priest who had married him. After this double exploit he went
away, and, during his subsequent career, which was brief but
exciting, he robbed twelve travelers, smoked a score of monks in
their monastery, and made a seraglio of a convent."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do with this horror?" we cried.</p>

<p>"Eh! parbleu! I will make it the handle to my door-bell and
frighten my creditors."</p>

<p>"My friend," said Henry Smith, a big, phlegmatic Englishman, "I
believe that this hand is only a kind of Indian meat, preserved by a
new process; I advise you to make bouillon of it."</p>

<p>"Rail not, messieurs," said, with the utmost sang froid, a medical
student who was three-quarters drunk, "but if you follow my advice,
Pierre, you will give this piece of human debris Christian burial,
for fear lest its owner should come to demand it. Then, too, this
hand has acquired some bad habits, for you know the proverb, 'Who has
killed will kill.'"</p>

<p>"And who has drank will drink," replied the host as he poured out
a big glass of punch for the student, who emptied it at a draught and
slid dead drunk under the table. His sudden dropping out of the
company was greeted with a burst of laughter, and Pierre, raising his
glass and saluting the hand, cried:</p>

<p>"I drink to the next visit of thy master."</p>

<p>Then the conversation turned upon other subjects, and shortly
afterward each returned to his lodgings..About two o'clock the next
day, as I was passing Pierre's door, I entered and found him reading
and smoking.</p>

<p>"Well, how goes it?" said I. "Very well," he responded. "And your
hand?" "My hand? Did you not see it on the bell-pull? I put it there
when I returned home last night. But, apropos of this, what do you
think? Some idiot, doubtless to play a stupid joke on me, came
ringing at my door towards midnight. I demanded who was there, but as
no one replied, I went back to bed again, and to sleep."</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and the landlord, a fat and
extremely impertinent person, entered without saluting us.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, "I pray you to take away immediately that carrion
which you have hung to your bell-pull. Unless you do this I shall be
compelled to ask you to leave."</p>

<p>"Sir," responded Pierre, with much gravity, "you insult a hand
which does not merit it. Know you that it belonged to a man of high
breeding?"</p>

<p>The landlord turned on his heel and made his exit, without
speaking. Pierre followed him, detached the hand and affixed it to
the bell-cord hanging in his alcove.</p>

<p>"That is better," he said. "This hand, like the 'Brother, all must
die,' of the Trappists, will give my thoughts a serious turn every
night before I sleep."</p>

<p>At the end of an hour I left him and returned to my own
apartment.</p>

<p>I slept badly the following night, was nervous and agitated, and
several times awoke with a start. Once I imagined, even, that a man
had broken into my room, and I sprang up and searched the closets and
under the bed. Towards six o'clock in the morning I was commencing to
doze at last, when a loud knocking at my door made me jump from my
couch. It was my friend Pierre's servant, half dressed, pale and
trembling.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir!" cried he, sobbing, "my poor master. Someone has
murdered him."</p>

<p>I dressed myself hastily and ran to Pierre's lodgings. The house
was full of people disputing together, and everything was in a
commotion. Everyone was talking at the same time, recounting and
commenting on the occurrence in all sorts of ways. With great
difficulty I reached the bed-room, made myself known to those
guarding the door and was permitted to enter. Four agents of police
were standing in the middle of the apartment, pencils in hand,
examining every detail, conferring in low voices and writing from
time to time in their note-books. Two doctors were in consultation by
the bed on which lay the unconscious form of Pierre. He was not dead,
but his face was fixed in an expression of the most awful terror. His
eyes were open their widest, and the dilated pupils seemed to regard
fixedly, with unspeakable horror, something unknown and frightful.
His hands were clinched. I raised the quilt, which covered his body
from the chin downward, and saw on his neck, deeply sunk in the
flesh, the marks of fingers. Some drops of blood spotted his shirt.
At that moment one thing struck me. I chanced to notice that the
shriveled hand was no longer attached to the bell-cord. The doctors
had doubtless removed it to avoid the comments of those entering the
chamber where the wounded man lay, because the appearance of this
hand was indeed frightful. I did not inquire what had become of
it.</p>

<p>I now clip from a newspaper of the next day the story of the crime
with all the details that the police were able to procure:</p>

<p>"A frightful attempt was made yesterday on the life of young M.
Pierre B., student, who belongs to one of the best families in
Normandy. He returned home about ten o'clock in the evening, and
excused his valet, Bouvin, from further attendance upon him, saying
that he felt fatigued and was going to bed. Towards midnight Bouvin
was suddenly awakened by the furious ringing of his master's bell. He
was afraid, and lighted a lamp and waited. The bell was silent about
a minute, then rang again with such vehemence that the domestic, mad
with fright, flew from his room to awaken the concierge, who ran to
summon the police, and, at the end of about fifteen minutes, two
policemen forced open the door. A horrible sight met their eyes. The
furniture was overturned, giving evidence of a fearful struggle
between the victim and his assailant. In the middle of the room, upon
his back, his body rigid, with livid face and frightfully dilated
eyes, lay, motionless, young Pierre B., bearing upon his neck the
deep imprints of five fingers. Dr. Bourdean was called immediately,
and his report says that the aggressor must have been possessed of
prodigious strength and have had an extraordinarily thin and sinewy
hand, because the fingers left in the flesh of the victim five holes
like those from a pistol ball, and had penetrated until they almost
met. There is no clue to the motive of the crime or to its
perpetrator. The police are making a thorough investigation."</p>

<p>The following appeared in the same newspaper next day:</p>

<p>"M. Pierre B., the victim of the frightful assault of which we
published an account yesterday, has regained consciousness after two
hours of the most assiduous care by Dr. Bourdean. His life is not in
danger, but it is strongly feared that he has lost his reason. No
trace has been found of his assailant."</p>

<p>My poor friend was indeed insane. For seven months I visited him
daily at the hospital where we had placed him, but he did not recover
the light of reason. In his delirium strange words escaped him, and,
like all madmen, he had one fixed idea: he believed himself
continually pursued by a specter. One day they came for me in haste,
saying he was worse, and when I arrived I found him dying. For two
hours he remained very calm, then, suddenly, rising from his bed in
spite of our efforts, he cried, waving his arms as if a prey to the
most awful terror: "Take it away! Take it away! It strangles me!
Help! Help!" Twice he made the circuit of the room, uttering horrible
screams, then fell face downward, dead.</p>

<p>As he was an orphan I was charged to take his body to the little
village of P., in Normandy, where his parents were buried. It was the
place from which he had arrived the evening he found us drinking
punch in Louis R.'s room, when he had presented to us the flayed
hand. His body was inclosed in a leaden coffin, and four days
afterwards I walked sadly beside the old cur&eacute;, who had given
him his first lessons, to the little cemetery where they dug his
grave. It was a beautiful day, and sunshine from a cloudless sky
flooded the earth. Birds sang from the blackberry bushes where many a
time when we were children we had stolen to eat the fruit. Again I
saw Pierre and myself creeping along behind the hedge and slipping
through the gap that we knew so well, down at the end of the little
plot where they bury the poor. Again we would return to the house
with cheeks and lips black with the juice of the berries we had
eaten. I looked at the bushes; they were covered with fruit;
mechanically I picked some and bore it to my mouth. The cur&eacute;
had opened his breviary, and was muttering his prayers in a low
voice. I heard at the end of the walk the spades of the grave-diggers
who were opening the tomb. Suddenly they called out, the cur&eacute;
closed his book, and we went to see what they wished of us. They had
found a coffin; in digging a stroke of the pickaxe had started the
cover, and we perceived within a skeleton of unusual stature, lying
on its back, its hollow eyes seeming yet to menace and defy us. I was
troubled, I know not why, and almost afraid.</p>

<p>"Hold!" cried one of the men, "look there! One of the rascal's
hands has been severed at the wrist. Ah, here it is!" and he picked
up from beside the body a huge withered hand, and held it out to
us.."See," cried the other, laughing, "see how he glares at you, as
if he would spring at your throat to make you give him back his
hand."</p>

<p>"Go," said the cur&eacute;, "leave the dead in peace, and close
the coffin. We will make poor Pierre's grave elsewhere."</p>

<p>The next day all was finished, and I returned to Paris, after
having left fifty francs with the old cur&eacute; for masses to be
said for the repose of the soul of him whose sepulchre we had
troubled.</p>
