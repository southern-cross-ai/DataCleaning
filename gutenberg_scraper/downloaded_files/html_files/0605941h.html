<h2><a name="s1"></a>The Ghostly Rental</h2>

<p>I was in my twenty-second year, and I had just left college. I was
at liberty to choose my career, and I chose it with much promptness.
I afterward renounced it, in truth, with equal ardor, but I have
never regretted those two youthful years of perplexed and excited,
but also of agreeable and fruitful experiment. I had a taste for
theology, and during my college term I had been an admiring reader of
Dr. Channing. This was theology of a grateful and succulent savor; it
seemed to offer one the rose of faith delightfully stripped of its
thorns. And then (for I rather think this had something to do with
it), I had taken a fancy to the old Divinity School. I have always
had an eye to the back scene in the human drama, and it seemed to me
that I might play my part with a fair chance of applause (from myself
at least), in that detached and tranquil home of mild casuistry, with
its respectable avenue on one side, and its prospect of green fields
and contact with acres of woodland on the other. Cambridge, for the
lovers of woods and fields, has changed for the worse since those
days, and the precinct in question has forfeited much of its mingled
pastoral and scholastic quietude. It was then a College-hall in the
woods--a charming mixture.</p>

<p>What it is now has nothing to do with my story; and I have no
doubt that there are still doctrine-haunted young seniors who, as
they stroll near it in the summer dusk, promise themselves, later, to
taste of its fine leisurely quality. For myself, I was not
disappointed. I established myself in a great square, low-browed
room, with deep window-benches; I hung prints from Overbeck and Ary
Scheffer on the walls; I arranged my books, with great refinement of
classification, in the alcoves beside the high chimney-shelf, and I
began to read Plotinus and St. Augustine. Among my companions were
two or three men of ability and of good fellowship, with whom I
occasionally brewed a fireside bowl; and with adventurous reading,
deep discourse, potations conscientiously shallow, and long country
walks, my initiation into the clerical mystery progressed agreeably
enough.</p>

<p>With one of my comrades I formed an especial friendship, and we
passed a great deal of time together. Unfortunately he had a chronic
weakness of one of his knees, which compelled him to lead a very
sedentary life, and as I was a methodical pedestrian, this made some
difference in our habits. I used often to stretch away for my daily
ramble, with no companion but the stick in my hand or the book in my
pocket. But in the use of my legs and the sense of unstinted open
air, I have always found company enough. I should, perhaps, add that
in the enjoyment of a very sharp pair of eyes, I found something of a
social pleasure. My eyes and I were on excellent terms; they were
indefatigable observers of all wayside incidents, and so long as they
were amused I was contented. It is, indeed, owing to their
inquisitive habits that I came into possession of this remarkable
story. Much of the country about the old College town is pretty now,
but it was prettier thirty years ago. That multitudinous eruption of
domiciliary pasteboard which now graces the landscape, in the
direction of the low, blue Waltham Hills, had not yet taken place;
there were no genteel cottages to put the shabby meadows and scrubby
orchards to shame--a juxtaposition by which, in later years, neither
element of the contrast has gained. Certain crooked cross-roads,
then, as I remember them, were more deeply and naturally rural, and
the solitary dwellings on the long grassy slopes beside them, under
the tall, customary elm that curved its foliage in mid-air like the
outward dropping ears of a girdled wheat-sheaf, sat with their
shingled hoods well pulled down on their ears, and no prescience
whatever of the fashion of French roofs--weather-wrinkled old peasant
women, as you might call them, quietly wearing the native coif, and
never dreaming of mounting bonnets, and indecently exposing their
venerable brows.</p>

<p>That winter was what is called an "open" one; there was much cold,
but little snow; the roads were firm and free, and I was rarely
compelled by the weather to forego my exercise. One gray December
afternoon I had sought it in the direction of the adjacent town of
Medford, and I was retracing my steps at an even pace, and watching
the pale, cold tints--the transparent amber and faded
rose-color--which curtained, in wintry fashion, the western sky, and
reminded me of a sceptical smile on the lips of a beautiful woman. I
came, as dusk was falling, to a narrow road which I had never
traversed and which I imagined offered me a short cut homeward. I was
about three miles away; I was late, and would have been thankful to
make them two. I diverged, walked some ten minutes, and then
perceived that the road had a very unfrequented air. The wheel-ruts
looked old; the stillness seemed peculiarly sensible. And yet down
the road stood a house, so that it must in some degree have been a
thoroughfare. On one side was a high, natural embankment, on the top
of which was perched an apple-orchard, whose tangled boughs made a
stretch of coarse black lace-work, hung across the coldly rosy west.
In a short time I came to the house, and I immediately found myself
interested in it. I stopped in front of it gazing hard, I hardly knew
why, but with a vague mixture of curiosity and timidity. It was a
house like most of the houses thereabouts, except that it was
decidedly a handsome specimen of its class. It stood on a grassy
slope, it had its tall, impartially drooping elm beside it, and its
old black well-cover at its shoulder. But it was of very large
proportions, and it h--a striking look of solidity and stoutness of
timber. It had lived to a good old age, too, for the wood-work on its
door-way and under its eaves, carefully and abundantly carved,
referred it to the middle, at the latest, of the last century.</p>

<p>All this had once been painted white, but the broad back of time,
leaning against the door-posts for a hundred years, had laid bare the
grain of the wood. Behind the house stretched an orchard of
apple-trees, more gnarled and fantastic than usual, and wearing, in
the deepening dusk, a blighted and exhausted aspect. All the windows
of the house had rusty shutters, without slats, and these were
closely drawn. There was no sign of life about it; it looked blank,
bare and vacant, and yet, as I lingered near it, it seemed to have a
familiar meaning--an audible eloquence. I have always thought of the
impression made upon me at first sight, by that gray colonial
dwelling, as a proof that induction may sometimes be near akin to
divination; for after all, there was nothing on the face of the
matter to warrant the very serious induction that I made.</p>

<p>I fell back and crossed the road. The last red light of the sunset
disengaged itself, as it was about to vanish, and rested faintly for
a moment on the time-silvered front of the old house. It touched,
with perfect regularity, the series of small panes in the fan-shaped
window above the door, and twinkled there fantastically. Then it died
away, and left the place more intensely somber. At this moment, I
said to myself with the accent of profound conviction--"The house is
simply haunted!"</p>

<p>Somehow, immediately, I believed it, and so long as I was not shut
up inside, the idea gave me pleasure. It was implied in the aspect of
the house, and it explained it. Half an hour before, if I had been
asked, I would have said, as befitted a young man who was explicitly
cultivating cheerful views of the supernatural, that there were no
such things as haunted houses. But the dwelling before me gave a
vivid meaning to the empty words: it had been spiritually
blighted.</p>

<p>The longer I looked at it, the intenser seemed the secret that it
held. I walked all round it, I tried to peep here and there, through
a crevice in the shutters, and I took a puerile satisfaction in
laying my hand on the door-knob and gently turning it. If the door
had yielded, would I have gone in?---would I have penetrated the
dusty stillness? My audacity, fortunately, was not put to the test.
The portal was admirably solid, and I was unable even to shake it. At
last I turned away, casting many looks behind me. I pursued my way,
and, after a longer walk than I had bargained for, reached the
high-road. At a certain distance below the point at which the long
lane I have mentioned entered it, stood a comfortable, tidy dwelling,
which might have offered itself as the model of the house which is in
no sense haunted--which has no sinister secrets, and knows nothing
but blooming prosperity. Its clean white paint stared placidly
through the dusk, and its vine-covered porch had been dressed in
straw for the winter. An old, one-horse chaise, freighted with two
departing visitors, was leaving the door, and through the undraped
windows, I saw the lamp-lit sitting-room, and the table spread with
the early "tea," which had been improvised for the comfort of the
guests. The mistress of the house had come to the gate with her
friends; she lingered there after the chaise had wheeled creakingly
away, half to watch them down the road, and half to give me, as I
passed in the twilight, a questioning look. She was a comely, quick
young woman, with a sharp, dark eye, and I ventured to stop and speak
to her.</p>

<p>"That house down that side-road," I said, "about a mile from
here--the only one--can you tell me whom it belongs to?"</p>

<p>She stared at me a moment, and, I thought, colored a little. "Our
folks never go down that road," she said, briefly.</p>

<p>"But it's a short way to Medford," I answered.</p>

<p>She gave a little toss of her head. "Perhaps it would turn out a
long way. At any rate, we don't use it."</p>

<p>This was interesting. A thrifty Yankee household must have good
reasons for this scorn of time-saving processes. "But you know the
house, at least?" I said.</p>

<p>"Well, I have seen it."</p>

<p>"And to whom does it belong?"</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh and looked away, as if she were aware
that, to a stranger, her words might seem to savor of agricultural
superstition. "I guess it belongs to them that are in it."</p>

<p>"But is there any one in it? It is completely closed."</p>

<p>"That makes no difference. They never come out, and no one ever
goes in." And she turned away.</p>

<p>But I laid my hand on her arm, respectfully. "You mean," I said,
"that the house is haunted?"</p>

<p>She drew herself away, colored, raised her finger to her lips, and
hurried into the house, where, in a moment, the curtains were dropped
over the windows.</p>

<p>For several days, I thought repeatedly of this little adventure,
but I took some satisfaction in keeping it to myself. If the house
was not haunted, it was useless to expose my imaginative whims, and
if it was, it was agreeable to drain the cup of horror without
assistance. I determined, of course, to pass that way again; and a
week later--it was the last day of the year--I retraced my steps. I
approached the house from the opposite direction, and found myself
before it at about the same hour as before. The light was failing,
the sky low and gray; the wind wailed along the hard, bare ground,
and made slow eddies of the frost-blackened leaves. The melancholy
mansion stood there, seeming to gather the winter twilight around it,
and mask itself in it, inscrutably. I hardly knew on what errand I
had come, but I had a vague feeling that if this time the door-knob
were to turn and the door to open, I should take my heart in my
hands, and let them close behind me. Who were the mysterious tenants
to whom the good woman at the corner had alluded? What had been seen
or heard---what was related? The door was as stubborn as before, and
my impertinent fumblings with the latch caused no upper window to be
thrown open, nor any strange, pale face to be thrust out. I ventured
even to raise the rusty knocker and give it half-a-.dozen raps, but
they made a flat, dead sound, and aroused no echo. Familiarity breeds
contempt; I don't know what I should have done next, if, in the
distance, up the road (the same one I had followed), I had not seen a
solitary figure advancing. I was unwilling to be observed hanging
about this ill-famed dwelling, and I sought refuge among the dense
shadows of a grove of pines near by, where I might peep forth, and
yet remain invisible. Presently, the new-coiner drew near, and I
perceived that he was making straight for the house. He was a little,
old man, the most striking feature of whose appearance was a
voluminous cloak, of a sort of military cut. He carried a
walking-stick, and advanced in a slow, painful, somewhat hobbling
fashion, but with an air of extreme resolution. He turned off from
the road, and followed the vague wheel-track, and within a few yards
of the house he paused. He looked up at it, fixedly and searchingly,
as if he were counting the windows, or noting certain familiar marks.
Then he took off his hat, and bent over slowly and solemnly, as if he
were performing an obeisance. As he stood uncovered, I had a good
look at him. He was, as I have said, a diminutive old man, but it
would have been hard to decide whether he belonged to this world or
to the other. His head reminded me, vaguely, of the portraits of
Andrew Jackson. He had a crop of grizzled hair, as still as a brush,
a lean, pale, smooth-shaven face, and an eye of intense brilliancy,
surmounted with thick brows, which had remained perfectly black. His
face, as well as his cloak, seemed to belong to an old soldier; he
looked like a retired military man of a modest rank; but he struck me
as exceeding the classic privilege of even such a personage to be
eccentric and grotesque. When he had finished his salute, he advanced
to the door, fumbled in the folds of his cloak, which hung down much
further in front than behind, and produced a key. This he slowly and
carefully inserted into the lock, and then, apparently, he turned it.
But the door did not immediately open; first he bent his head, turned
his ear, and stood listening, and then he looked up and down the
road. Satisfied or re-assured, he applied his aged shoulder to one of
the deep-set panels, and pressed a moment. The door yielded--opening
into perfect darkness. He stopped again on the threshold, and again
removed his hat and made his bow. Then he went in, and carefully
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Who in the world was he, and what was his errand? He might have
been a figure out of one of Hoffmann's tales. Was he vision or a
reality--an inmate of the house, or a familiar, friendly visitor?
What had been the meaning, in either case, of his mystic
genuflexions, and how did he propose to proceed, in that inner
darkness? I emerged from my retirement, and observed narrowly,
several of the windows. In each of them, at an interval, a ray of
light became visible in the chink between the two leaves of the
shutters. Evidently, he was lighting up; was he going to give a
party--a ghostly revel? My curiosity grew intense, but I was quite at
a loss how to satisfy it. For a moment I thought of rapping
peremptorily at the door; but I dismissed this idea as unmannerly,
and calculated to break the spell, if spell there was. I walked round
the house and tried, without violence, to open one of the lower
windows. It resisted, but I had better fortune, in a moment, with
another. There was a risk, certainly, in the trick I was playing--a
risk of being seen from within, or (worse) seeing, myself, something
that I should repent of seeing. But curiosity, as I say, had become
an inspiration, and the risk was highly agreeable. Through the
parting of the shutters I looked into a lighted room--a room lighted
by two candles in old brass flambeaux, placed upon the mantel-shelf.
It was apparently a sort of back parlor, and it had retained all its
furniture. This was of a homely, old-fashioned pattern, and consisted
of hair-cloth chairs and sofas, spare mahogany tables, and framed
samplers hung upon the walls. But although the room was furnished, it
had a strangely uninhabited look; the tables and chairs were in rigid
positions, and no small, familiar objects were visible. I could not
see everything, and I could only guess at the existence, on my right,
of a large folding-door. It was apparently open, and the light of the
neighboring room passed through it. I waited for some time, but the
room remained empty.</p>

<p>At last I became conscious that a large shadow was projected upon
the wall opposite the folding-door---the shadow, evidently, of a
figure in the adjoining room. It was tall and grotesque, and seemed
to represent a person sitting perfectly motionless, in profile. I
thought I recognized the perpendicular bristles and far-arching nose
of my little old man. There was a strange fixedness in his posture;
he appeared to be seated, and looking intently at something. I
watched the shadow a long time, but it never stirred. At last,
however, just as my patience began to ebb, it moved slowly, rose to
the ceiling, and became indistinct. I don't know what I should have
seen next, but by an irresistible impulse, I closed the shutter. Was
it delicacy?--was it pusillanimity? I can hardly say. I lingered,
nevertheless, near the house, hoping that my friend would re-appear.
I was not disappointed; for he at last emerged, looking just as when
he had gone in, and taking his leave in the same ceremonious fashion.
(The lights, I had already observed, had disappeared from the crevice
of each of the windows.) He faced about before the door, took off his
hat, and made an obsequious bow. As he turned away I had a hundred
minds to speak to him, but I let him depart in peace. This, I may
say, was pure delicacy;--you will answer, perhaps, that it came too
late. It seemed to me that he had a right to resent my observation;
though my own right to exercise it (if ghosts were in the question)
struck me as equally positive. I continued to watch him as he hobbled
softly down the bank, and along the lonely road. Then I musingly
retreated in the opposite direction. I was tempted to follow him, at
a distance, to see what became of him; but this, too, seemed
indelicate; and I confess, moreover, that I felt the inclination to
coquet a little, as it were, with my discovery--to pull apart the
petals of the flower one by one.</p>

<p>I continued to smell the flower, from time to time, for its oddity
of perfume had fascinated me.</p>

<p>I passed by the house on the crossroad again, but never
encountered the old man in the cloak or any other way-farer. It
seemed to keep observers at a distance, and I was careful not to
gossip about it: one inquirer, I said to myself, may edge his way
into the secret, but there is no room for two. At the same time, of
course, I would have been thankful for any chance sidelight that
might fall across the matter--though I could not well see whence it
was to come. I hoped to meet the old man in the cloak elsewhere, but
as the days passed by without his re-appearing, I ceased o expect it.
And yet I reflected that he probably lived n that neighorhood,
inasmuch as he had made his pilgrimage to the vacant house on foot.
If he had come from a distance, he would have been sure to arrive in
some old deep-hooded gig with yellow wheels--a vehicle as venerably
grotesque as himself. One day I took a stroll in Mount Auburn
cemetery--an institution at that period in its infancy, and full of a
sylvan charm which it has now completely forfeited. It contained more
maple and birch than willow and cypress, and the sleepers had ample
elbow room. It was not a city of the dead, but at the most a village,
and a meditative pedestrian might stroll there without too
importunate reminder of the grotesque side of our claims to
posthumous consideration. I had come out to enjoy the first foretaste
of Spring--one of those mild days of late winter, when the torpid
earth seems to draw the first long breath that marks the rupture of
the spell of sleep. The sun was veiled in haze, aid yet warm, and the
frost was oozing from its deepest lurking-place. I had been treading
for half an hour the winding ways of the cemetery, when suddenly I
perceived a familiar figure seated on a bench against a
southward-facing evergreen hedge. I call the figure familiar, because
I had seen it often in memory and in fancy; in fact, I had beheld it
but once. Its back was turned to me, but it wore a voluminous cloak,
which there was no mistaking. Here, at last, was my fellow-visitor at
the haunted house, and here was my chance, if I wished to approach
him! I made a circuit, and came toward him from in front. He saw me,
at the end of the alley, and sat motionless, with his hands on the
head of his stick, watching me from under his black eyebrows as I
drew near. At a distance these black eyebrows looked formidable; they
were the only thing I saw in his face. But on a closer view I was
re-assured, simply because I immediately felt that no man could
really be as fantastically fierce as this poor old gentleman looked.
His face was a kind of caricature of martial truculence. I stopped in
front of him, and respectfully asked leave to sit and rest upon his
bench. He granted it with a silent gesture, of much dignity, and I
placed myself beside him. In this position I was able, covertly, to
observe him. He was quite as much an oddity in the morning sunshine,
as he had been in the dubious twilight. The lines in his face were as
rigid as if they had been hacked out of a block by a clumsy
wood-carver. His eyes were flamboyant, his nose terrific, his mouth
implacable. And yet, after awhile, when he slowly turned and looked
at me, fixedly, I perceived that in spite of this portentous mask, he
was a very mild old man. I was sure he even would have been glad to
smile, but, evidently, his facial muscles were too stiff--they had
taken a different fold, once for all. I wondered whether he was
demented, but I dismissed the idea; the fixed glitter in his eye was
not that of insanity. What his face really expressed was deep and
simple sadness; his heart perhaps was broken, but his brain was
intact. His dress was shabby but neat, and his old blue cloak had
known half a century's brushing.</p>

<p>I hastened to make some observation upon the exceptional softness
of the day, and he answered me in a gentle, mellow voice, which it
was almost startling to hear proceed from such bellicose lips.</p>

<p>"This is a very comfortable place," he presently added.</p>

<p>"I am fond of walking in graveyards," I rejoined deliberately;
flattering myself that I had struck a vein that might lead to
something.</p>

<p>I was encouraged; he turned and fixed me with his duskily glowing
eyes. Then very gravely,---"Walking, yes. Take all your exercise now.
Some day you will have to settle down in a graveyard in a fixed
position."</p>

<p>"Very true," said I. "But you know there are some people who are
said to take exercise even after that day."</p>

<p>He had been looking at me still; at this he looked away.</p>

<p>"You don't understand?" I said, gently.</p>

<p>He continued to gaze straight before him.</p>

<p>"Some people, you know, walk about after death," I went on.</p>

<p>At last he turned, and looked at me more portentously than ever.
"You don't believe that," he said simply.</p>

<p>"How do you know I don't?"</p>

<p>"Because you are young and foolish." This was said without
acerbity--even kindly; but in the tone of an old man whose
consciousness of his own heavy experience made everything else seem
light.</p>

<p>"I am certainly young," I answered; "but I don't think that, on
the whole, I am foolish. But say I don't believe in ghosts--most
people would be on my side."</p>

<p>"Most people are fools!" said the old man.</p>

<p>I let the question rest, and talked of other things. My companion
seemed on his guard, he eyed me defiantly, and made brief answers to
my remarks; but I nevertheless gathered an impression that our
meeting was an agreeable thing to him, and even a social incident of
some importance.</p>

<p>He was evidently a lonely creature, and his opportunities for
gossip were rare. He had had troubles, and they had detached him from
the world, and driven him back upon himself; but the social chord in
his antiquated soul was not entirely broken, and I was sure he was
gratified to find that it could still feebly resound. At last, he
began to ask questions himself; he inquired whether I was a
student.</p>

<p>"I am a student of divinity," I answered.</p>

<p>"Of divinity?"</p>

<p>"Of theology. I am studying for the ministry."</p>

<p>At this he eyed me with peculiar intensity after which his gaze
wandered away again. "There are certain things you ought to know,
then," he said at last.</p>

<p>"I have a great desire for knowledge," I answered. "What things do
you mean?"</p>

<p>He looked at me again awhile, but without heeding my question.</p>

<p>"I like your appearance," he said. "You seem to me a sober
lad."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am perfectly sober!" I exclaimed yet departing for a moment
from my soberness.</p>

<p>"I think you are fair-minded," he went on.</p>

<p>"I don't any longer strike you as foolish, then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I stick to what I said about people who deny the power of
departed spirits to return. They are fools!" And he rapped fiercely
with his staff on the earth.</p>

<p>I hesitated a moment, and then, abruptly, "You have seen a ghost!"
I said.</p>

<p>He appeared not at all startled.</p>

<p>"You are right, sir!" he answered with great dignity. "With me
it's not a matter of cold theory--I have not had to pry into old
books to learn what to believe. I know! With these eyes I have beheld
the departed spirit standing before me as near as you are!" And his
eyes, as he spoke, certainly looked as if they had rested upon
strange things.</p>

<p>I was irresistibly impressed--I was touched with credulity.</p>

<p>"And was it very terrible?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am an old soldier--I am not afraid!"</p>

<p>"When was it?--where was it?" I asked.</p>

<p>He looked at me mistrustfully, and I saw that I was going too
fast.</p>

<p>"Excuse me from going into particulars," he said. "I am not at
liberty to speak more fully. I have told you so much, because I
cannot bear to hear this subject spoken of lightly. Remember in
future, that you have seen a very honest old man who told you--on his
honor--that he had seen a ghost!" And he got up, as if he thought he
had said enough. Reserve, shyness, pride, the fear of being laughed
at, the memory, possibly, of former strokes of sarcasm--all this, on
one side, had its weight with him; but I suspected that on the other,
his tongue was loosened by the--garrulity of old age, the sense of
solitude, and the need of sympathy--and perhaps, also, by the
friend-liness which he had been so good as to express toward myself.
Evidently it would be unwise to press him, but I hoped to see him
again.</p>

<p>"To give greater weight to my words," he added, "let me mention my
name--Captain Diamond, sir. I have seen service."</p>

<p>"I hope I may have the pleasure of meeting you again," I said.</p>

<p>"The same to you, sir!" And brandishing his stick
portentously--though with the friendliest intentions--he marched
stiffly away.</p>

<p>I asked two or three persons--selected with discretion--whether
they knew anything about Captain Diamond, but they were quite unable
to enlighten me. At last, suddenly, I smote my forehead, and, dubbing
myself a dolt, remembered that I was neglecting a source of
information to which I had never applied in vain. The excellent
person at whose table I habitually dined, and who dispensed
hospitality to students at so much a week, had a sister as good as
herself, and of conversational powers more varied. This sister, who
was known as Miss Deborah, was an old maid in all the force of the
term. She was deformed, and she never went out of the house; she sat
all day at the window, between a bird-cage and a flower-pot,
stitching small linen articles---mysterious bands and frills. She
wielded, I was assured, an exquisite needle, and her work was highly
prized. In spite of her deformity and her confinement, she had a
little, fresh, round face, and an imperturbable serenity of spirit.
She had also a very quick little wit of her own, she was extremely
observant, and she had a high relish for a friendly chat. Nothing
pleased her so much as to have you--especially, I think, if you were
a young divinity student--move your chair near her sunny window, and
settle yourself for twenty minutes' "talk." "Well, sir," she used
always to say "what is the latest monstrosity in Biblical
criticism?"--for she used to pretend to be horrified at the
rationalistic tendency of the age. But she was an inexorable little
philosopher, and I am convinced that she was a keener rationalist
than any of us, and that, if she had chosen, she could have
propounded questions that would have made the boldest of us wince.
Her window commanded the whole town--or rather, the whole country.
Knowledge came to her as she sat singing, with her little, cracked
voice, in her low rocking-chair. She was the first to learn
everything, and the last to forget it. She had the town gossip at her
fingers' ends, and she knew everything about people she had never
seen. When I asked her how she had acquired her learning, she said
simply--"Oh, I observe!" "Observe closely enough," she once said,
"and it doesn't matter where you are. You may be in a pitch-dark
closet. All you want is something to start with; one thing leads to
another, and all things are mixed up. Shut me up in a dark closet and
I will observe after a while, that some places in it are darker than
others. After that (give me time), and I will tell you what the
President of the United States is going to have for dinner."</p>

<p>Once I paid her a compliment. "Your observation," I said, "is as
fine as your needle, and your statements are as true as your
stitches."</p>

<p>Of course Miss Deborah had heard of Captain Diamond. He had been
much talked about many years before, but he had survived the scandal
that attached to his name.</p>

<p>"What was the scandal?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He killed his daughter."</p>

<p>"Killed her?" I cried; "how so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not with a pistol, or a dagger, or a dose of arsenic! With
his tongue. Talk of women's tongues! He cursed her--with some
horrible oath--and she died!"</p>

<p>"What had she done?"</p>

<p>"She had received a visit from a young man who loved her, and whom
he had forbidden the house."</p>

<p>"The house," I said--"ah yes! The house is out in the country, two
or three miles from here, on a lonely cross-road."</p>

<p>Miss Deborah looked sharply at me, as she bit her thread.</p>

<p>"Ah, you know about the house?" she said.</p>

<p>"A little," I answered; "I have seen it. But I want you to tell me
more."</p>

<p>But here Miss Deborah betrayed an incommunicativeness which was
most unusual.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't call me superstitious, would you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You?--you are the quintessence of pure reason."</p>

<p>"Well, every thread has its rotten place, and every needle its
grain of rust. I would rather not talk about that house."</p>

<p>"You have no idea how you excite my curiosity!" I said.</p>

<p>"I can feel for you. But it would make me very nervous."</p>

<p>"What harm can come to you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Some harm came to a friend of mine." And Miss Deborah gave a very
positive nod.</p>

<p>"What had your friend done?"</p>

<p>"She had told me Captain Diamond's secret, which he had told her
with a mighty mystery. She had been an old flame of his, and he took
her into his confidence. He bade her tell no one, and assured her
that if she did, something dreadful would happen to her."</p>

<p>"And what happened to her?"</p>

<p>"She died."</p>

<p>"Oh, we are all mortal!" I said. "Had she given him a
promise?"</p>

<p>"She had not taken it seriously, she had not believed him. She
repeated the story to me, and three days afterward, she was taken
with inflammation of the lungs. A month afterward, here where I sit
now, I was stitching her grave-clothes. Since then, I have never
mentioned what she told me."</p>

<p>"Was it very strange?"</p>

<p>"It was strange, but it was ridiculous too. It is a thing to make
you shudder and to make you laugh, both. But you can't worry it out
of me. I am sure that if I were to tell you, I should immediately
break a needle in my finger, and die the next week of lock-jaw."</p>

<p>I retired, and urged Miss Deborah no further; but every two or
three days, after dinner, I came and sat down by her rocking chair. I
made no further allusion to Captain Diamond; I sat silent, clipping
tape with her scissors. At last, one day, she told me I was looking
poorly. I was pale.</p>

<p>"I am dying of curiosity," I said. "I have lost my appetite. I
have eaten no dinner."</p>

<p>"Remember Bluebeard's wife!" said Miss Deborah.</p>

<p>"One may as well perish by the sword as by famine!" I
answered.</p>

<p>Still she said nothing, and at last I rose with a melo-dramatic
sigh and departed. As I reached the door she called me and pointed to
the chair I had vacated. "I never was hard-hearted," she said. "Sit
down, and if we are to perish, may we at least perish together." And
then, in very few words, she communicated what she knew of Captain
Diamond's secret. "He was a very high-tempered old man, and though he
was very fond of his daughter, his will was law. He had picked out a
husband for her, and given her due notice. Her mother was dead, and
they lived alone together. The house had been Mrs. Diamond's own
marriage portion; the Captain, I believe, hadn't a penny. After his
marriage they had come to live there, and he had begun to work the
farm. The poor girl's lover was a young man with whiskers from
Boston. The Captain came in one evening and found them together; he
collared the young man, and hurled a terrible curse at the poor girl.
The young man cried that she was his wife, and he asked her if it was
true. She said, No! Thereupon Captain Diamond, his fury growing
fiercer, repeated his imprecation, ordered her out of the house, and
disowned her forever. She swooned away, but her father went raging
off and left her. Several hours later, he came back and found the
house empty. On the table was a note from the young man telling him
that he had killed his daughter, repeating the assurance that she was
his own wife, and declaring that he himself claimed the sole right to
commit her remains to earth. He had carried the body away in a gig!
Captain Diamond wrote him a dreadful note in answer, saying that he
didn't believe his daughter was dead, but that, whether or no, she
was dead to him. A week later, in the middle of the night, he saw her
ghost. Then, I suppose, he was convinced. The ghost re-appeared
several times, and finally began regularly to haunt the house. It
made the old man very uncomfortable, for little by little his passion
had passed away, and he was given up to grief. He determined at last
to leave the place, and tried to sell it or rent it; but meanwhile
the story had gone abroad, the ghost had been seen by other persons
the house had a bad name, and it was impossible to dispose of it.
With the farm, it was the old man's only property, and his only means
of subsistence; if he could neither live in it nor rent it he was
beggared. But the ghost had no mercy, as he had had none. He
struggled for six months, and at last he broke down. He put on his
old blue cloak and took up his staff, and prepared to wander sway and
beg his bread. Then the ghost relented, and proposed a compromise.
'Leave the house to me!' it said; 'I have marked it for my own. Go
off and live elsewhere. But to enable you to live, I will be your
tenant, since you can find no other. I will hire the house of you and
pay you a certain rent.' And the ghost named a sum. The old man
consented, and he goes every quarter to collect his rent!"</p>

<p>I laughed at this recital, but I confess I shuddered too, for my
own observation had exactly confirmed it. Had I not been witness of
one of the Captain's quarterly visits, had I not all but seen him sit
watching his spectral tenant count out the rent-money, and when he
trudged away in the dark, had he not a little bag of strangely gotten
coin hidden in the folds of his old blue cloak? I imparted none of
these reflections to Miss Deborah, for I was determined that my
observations should have a sequel, and I promised myself the pleasure
of treating her to my story in its full maturity. "Captain Diamond,"
I asked, "has no other known means of subsistence?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. He toils not, neither does he spin--his ghost
supports him. A haunted house is valuable property!"</p>

<p>"And in what coin does the ghost pay?"</p>

<p>"In good American gold and silver. It has only this
peculiarity---that the pieces are all dated before the young girl's
death. It's a strange mixture of matter and spirit!"</p>

<p>"And does the ghost do things handsomely; is the rent large?"</p>

<p>"The old man, I believe, lives decently, and has his pipe and his
glass. He took a little house down by the river; the door is sidewise
to the street, and there is a little garden before it. There he
spends his days, and has an old colored woman to do for him. Some
years ago, he used to wander about a good deal, he was a familiar
figure in the town, and most people knew his legend. But of late he
has drawn back into his shell; he sits over his fire, and curiosity
has forgotten him. I suppose he is falling into his dotage. But I am
sure, I trust," said Miss Deborah in conclusion, "that he won't
outlive his faculties or his powers of locomotion, for, if I remember
rightly, it was part of the bargain that he should come in person to
collect his rent."</p>

<p>We neither of us seemed likely to suffer any especial penalty for
Miss Deborah's indiscretion; I found her, day after day, singing over
her work, neither more nor less active than usual. For myself, I
boldly pursued my observations. I went again, more than once, to the
great graveyard, but I was disappointed in my hope of finding Captain
Diamond there. I had a prospect, however, which afforded me
compensation. I shrewdly inferred that the old man's quarterly
pilgrimages were made upon the last day of the old quarter. My first
sight of him had been on the 31 st of December, and it was probable
that he would return to his haunted home on the last day of March.
This was near at hand; at last it arrived. I betook myself late in
the afternoon to the old house on the cross-road, supposing that the
hour of twilight was the appointed season. I was not wrong. I had
been hovering about for a short time, feeling very much like a
restless ghost myself, when he appeared in the same manner as before,
and wearing the same costume. I again concealed myself, and saw him
enter the house with the ceremonial which he had used on the former
occasion. A light appeared successively in the crevice of each pair
of shutters, and I opened the window which had yielded to my
importunity before. Again I saw the great shadow on the wall,
motionless and solemn. But I saw nothing else. The old man
re-appeared at last, made his fantastic salaam before the house, and
crept away into the dusk.</p>

<p>One day, more than a month after this, I met him again at Mount
Auburn. The air was full of the voice of Spring; the birds had come
back and were twittering over their Winter's travels, and a mild west
wind was making a thin murmur in the raw verdure. He was seated on a
bench in the sun, still muffled in his enormous mantle, and he
recognized me as soon as I approached him. He nodded at me as if he
were an old Bashaw giving the signal for my decapitation, but it was
apparent that he was pleased to see me.</p>

<p>"I have looked for you here more than once," I said. "You don't
come often."</p>

<p>"What did you want of me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I wanted to enjoy your conversation. I did so greatly when I met
you here before."</p>

<p>"You found me amusing?"</p>

<p>"Interesting!" I said.</p>

<p>"You didn't think me cracked?"</p>

<p>"Cracked? My dear sir--!" I protested.</p>

<p>"I'm the sanest man in the country. I know that is what insane
people always say; but generally they can't prove it. I can!"</p>

<p>"I believe it," I said. "But I am curious to know how such a thing
can be proved."</p>

<p>He was silent awhile.</p>

<p>"I will tell you. I once committed, unintentionally, a great
crime. Now I pay the penalty. I give up my life to it. I don't shirk
it; I face it squarely, knowing perfectly what it is. I haven't tried
to bluff it off; I haven't begged off from it; I haven't run away
from it. The penalty is terrible, but I have accepted it. I have been
a philosopher!</p>

<p>"If I were a Catholic, I might have turned monk, and spent the
rest of my life in fasting and praying. That is no penalty; that is
an evasion. I might have blown my brains out--I might have gone mad.
I wouldn't do either. I would simply face the music, take the
consequences. As I say, they are awful! I take them on certain days,
four times a year. So it has been these twenty years; so it will be
as long as I last. It's my business; it's my avocation. That's the
way I feel about it. I call that reasonable!"</p>

<p>"Admirably so!" I said. "But you fill me with curiosity and with
compassion."</p>

<p>"Especially with curiosity," he said, cunningly.</p>

<p>"Why," I answered, "if I know exactly what you suffer I can pity
you more."</p>

<p>"I'm much obliged. I don't want your pity; it won't help me. I'll
tell you something, but it's not for myself; it's for your own sake."
He paused a long time and looked all round him, as if for chance
eaves-droppers. I anxiously awaited his revelation, but he
disappointed me. "Are you still studying theology?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," I answered, perhaps with a shade of irritation. "It's a
thing one can't learn in six months."</p>

<p>"I should think not, so long as you have nothing but your books.
Do you know the proverb, 'A grain of experience is worth a pound of
precept?' I'm a great theologian."</p>

<p>"Ah, you have had experience," I murmured sympathetically.</p>

<p>"You have read about the immortality of the soul; you have seen
Jonathan Edwards and Dr. Hopkins chopping logic over it, and
deciding, by chapter and verse, that it is true. But I have seen it
with these eyes; I have touched it with these hands!" And the old man
held up his rugged old fists and shook them portentously. "That's
better!" he went on; "but I have bought it dearly."</p>

<p>"You had better take it from the books--evidently you always will.
You are a very good young man; you will never have a crime on your
conscience." I answered with some juvenile fatuity, that I certainly
hoped I had my share of human passions, good young man and
prospective Doctor of Divinity as I was.</p>

<p>"Ah, but you have a nice, quiet little temper," he said. "So have
I--now! But once I was very brutal--very brutal. You ought to know
that such things are. I killed my own child."</p>

<p>"Your own child?"</p>

<p>"I struck her down to the earth and left her to die. They could
not hang me, for it was not with my hand I struck her. It was with
foul and damnable words. That makes a difference; it's a grand law we
live under! Well, sir, I can answer for it that her soul is immortal.
We have an appointment to meet four times a year, and then I catch
it!"</p>

<p>"She has never forgiven you?"</p>

<p>"She has forgiven me as the angels forgive! That's what I can't
stand--the soft, quiet way she looks at me. I'd rather she twisted a
knife about in my heart--O Lord, Lord, Lord!" and Captain Diamond
bowed his head over his stick, and leaned his forehead on his crossed
hands.</p>

<p>I was impressed and moved, and his attitude seemed for the moment
a check to further questions. Before I ventured to ask him anything
more, he slowly rose and pulled his old cloak around him. He was
unused to talking about his troubles, and his memories overwhelmed
him. "I must go my way," he said; "I must be creeping along."</p>

<p>"I shall perhaps meet you here again," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm a stiff-jointed old fellow," he answered, "and this is
rather far for me to come. I have to reserve myself. I have sat
sometimes a month at a time smoking my pipe in my chair. But I should
like to see you again." And he stopped and looked at me, terribly and
kindly. "Some day, perhaps, I shall be glad to be able to lay my hand
on a young, unperverted soul. If a man can make a friend, it is
always something gained. What is your name?"</p>

<p>I had in my pocket a small volume of Pascal's "Thoughts," on the
fly-leaf of which were written my name and address. I took it out and
offered it to my old friend. "Pray keep this little book," I said.
"It is one I am very fond of, and it will tell you something about
me."</p>

<p>He took it and turned it over slowly, then looking up at me with a
scowl of gratitude, "I'm not much of a reader," he said; "but I won't
refuse the first present I shall have received since--my troubles;
and the last. Thank you, sir!" And with the little book in his hand
he took his departure.</p>

<p>I was left to imagine him for some weeks after that sitting
solitary in his arm-chair with his pipe. I had not another glimpse of
him. But I was awaiting my chance, and on the last day of June,
another quarter having elapsed, I deemed that it had come. The
evening dusk in June falls late, and I was impatient for its coming.
At last, toward the end of a lovely summer's day, I revisited Captain
Diamond's property. Everything now was green around it save the
blighted or-chard in its rear, but its own immitigable grayness and
sadness were as striking as when I had first beheld it beneath a
December sky. As I drew near it, I saw that I was late for my
purpose, for my purpose had simply been to step forward on Captain
Diamond's arrival, and bravely ask him to let me go in with him. He
had preceded me, and there were lights already in the windows.</p>

<p>I was unwilling, of course, to disturb him during his ghostly
interview, and I waited till he came forth. The lights disappeared in
the course of time, then the door opened and Captain Diamond stole
out. That evening he made no bow to the haunted house, for the first
object he beheld was his fair-minded young friend planted, modestly
but firmly, near the door-step. He stopped short, looking at me, and
this time his terrible scowl was in keeping with the situation.</p>

<p>"I knew you were here," I said. "I came on purpose."</p>

<p>He seemed dismayed, and looked round at the house uneasily.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon if I have ventured too far," I added, "but you
know you have encouraged me."</p>

<p>"How did you know I was here?"</p>

<p>"I reasoned it out. You told me half your story, and I guessed the
other half. I am a great observer, and I had noticed this house in
passing. It seemed to me to have a mystery. When you kindly confided
to me that you saw spirits, I was sure that it could only be here
that you saw them."</p>

<p>"You are mighty clever," cried the old man. "And what brought you
here this evening?"</p>

<p>I was obliged to evade this question.</p>

<p>"Oh, I often come; I like to look at the house--it fascinates
me."</p>

<p>He turned and looked up at it himself. "It's nothing to look at
outside." He was evidently quite unaware of its peculiar outward
appearance, and this odd fact, communicated to me thus in the
twilight, and under the very brow of the sinister dwelling, seemed to
make his vision of the strange things within more real.</p>

<p>"I have been hoping," I said, "for a chance to see the inside. I
thought I might find you here, and that you would let me go in with
you. I should like to see what you see." He seemed confounded by my
boldness, but not altogether displeased. He laid his hand on my arm.
"Do you know what I see?" he asked.</p>

<p>"How can I know, except as you said the other day, by experience?
I want to have the experience. Pray, open the door and take me
in."</p>

<p>Captain Diamond's brilliant eyes expanded beneath their dusky
brows, and after holding his breath a moment, he indulged in the
first and last apology for a laugh by which I was to see his solemn
visage contorted. It was profoundly grotesque, but it was perfectly
noiseless. "Take you in?" he softly growled. "I wouldn't go in again
before my time's up for a thousand times that sum." And he thrust out
his hand from the folds of his cloak and exhibited a small
agglommeration of coin, knotted into the corner of an old silk
pocket-handkerchief. "I stick to my bargain no less, but no
more!"</p>

<p>"But you told me the first time I had the pleasure of talking with
you that it was not so terrible."</p>

<p>"I don't say it's terrible--now. But it's damned
disagreeable!"</p>

<p>This adjective was uttered with a force that made me hesitate and
reflect. While I did so, I thought I heard a slight movement of one
of the window-shutters above us. I looked up, but everything seemed
motionless. Captain Diamond, too, had been thinking; suddenly he
turned toward the house. "If you will go in alone," he said, "you are
welcome."</p>

<p>"Will you wait for me here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you will not stop long."</p>

<p>"But the house is pitch dark. When you go you have lights."</p>

<p>He thrust his hand into the depths of his cloak and produced some
matches. "Take take," he said. "You will find two candlesticks with
candles on the table in the hall. Light them, take one in each hand
and go ahead."</p>

<p>"Where shall I go?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere--everywhere. You can trust the ghost to find you." I
will not pretend to deny that by this time my heart was beating. And
yet I imagine I motioned the old man with a sufficiently dignified
gesture to open the door. I had made up my mind that there was in
fact a ghost. I had conceded the premise. Only I had assured myself
that once the mind was prepared, and the thing was not a surprise, it
was possible to keep cool. Captain Diamond turned the lock, flung
open the door, and bowed low to me as I passed in. I stood in the
darkness, and heard the door close behind me. For some moments, I
stirred neither finger nor toe; I stared bravely into the
impenetrable dusk. But I saw nothing and heard nothing, and at last I
struck a match. On the table were two old brass candlesticks rusty
from disuse. I lighted the candles and began my tour of
exploration.</p>

<p>A wide staircase rose in front of me, guarded by an antique
balustrade of that rigidly delicate carving which is found so often
in old New England houses. I postponed ascending it, and turned into
the room on my right. This was an old-fashioned parlor, meagerly
furnished, and musty with the absence of human life. I raised my two
lights aloft and saw nothing but its empty chairs and its blank
walls. Behind it was the room into which I had peeped from without,
and which, in fact, communicated with it, as I had supposed, by
folding doors. Here, too, I found myself confronted by no menacing
specter. I crossed the hall again, and visited the rooms on the other
side; a dining-room in front, where I might have written my name with
my finger in the deep dust of the great square table; a kitchen
behind with its pots and pans eternally cold. All this was hard and
grim, but it was not formidable. I came back into the hall, and
walked to the foot of the staircase, holding up my candles; to ascend
required a fresh effort, and I was scanning the gloom above.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with an inexpressible sensation, I became aware that
this gloom was animated; it seemed to move and gather itself
together. Slowly--I say slowly, for to my tense expectancy the
instants appeared ages--it took the shape of a large, definite
figure, and this figure advanced and stood at the top of the stairs.
I frankly confess that by this time I was conscious of a feeling to
which I am in duty bound to apply the vulgar name of fear. I may
poetize it and call it Dread, with a capital letter; it was at any
rate the feeling that makes a man yield ground. I measured it as it
grew, and it seemed perfectly irresistible; for it did not appear to
come from within but from without, and to be embodied in the dark
image at the head of the staircase. After a fashion I reasoned--I
remember reasoning. I said to myself, "I had always thought ghosts
were white and transparent; this is a thing of thick shadows, densely
opaque." I reminded myself that the occasion was momentous, and that
if fear were to overcome me I should gather all possible impressions
while my wits remained. I stepped back, foot behind foot, with my
eyes still on the figure and placed my candles on the table. I was
perfectly conscious that the proper thing was to ascend the stairs
resolutely, face to face with the image, but the soles of my shoes
seemed sud-denly to have been transformed into leaden weights. I had
got what I wanted; I was seeing the ghost. I tried to look at the
figure distinctly so that I could remember it, and fairly claim,
afterward, not to have lost my self-possession. I even asked myself
how long it was expected I should stand looking, and how soon I could
honorably retire. All this, of course, passed through my mind with
extreme rapidity, and it was checked by a further movement on the
part of the figure. Two white hands appeared in the dark
perpendicular mass, and were slowly raised to what seemed to be the
level of the head. Here they were pressed together, over the region
of the face, and then they were removed, and the face was disclosed.
It was dim, white, strange, in every way ghostly. It looked down at
me for an instant, after which one of the hands was raised again,
slowly, and waved to and fro before it. There was something very
singular in this gesture; it seemed to denote resentment and
dismissal, and yet it had a sort of trivial, familiar motion.</p>

<p>Familiarity on the part of the haunting Presence had not entered
into my calculations, and did not strike me pleasantly. I agreed with
Captain Diamond that it was "damned disagreeable." I was pervaded by
an intense desire to make an orderly, and, if possible, a graceful
retreat. I wished to do it gallantly, and it seemed to me that it
would be gallant to blow out my candles. I turned and did so,
punctiliously, and then I made my way to the door, groped a moment
and opened it. The outer light, almost extinct as it was, entered for
a moment, played over the dusty depths of the house and showed me the
solid shadow.</p>

<p>Standing on the grass, bent over his stick, under the early
glimmering stars, I found Captain Diamond. He looked up at me fixedly
for a moment, but asked no questions, and then he went and locked the
door. This duty performed, he discharged the other--made his
obeisance like the priest before the altar--and then without heeding
me further, took his departure.</p>

<p>A few days later, I suspended my studies and went off for the
summer's vacation. I was absent for several weeks, during which I had
plenty of leisure to analyze my impressions of the supernatural. I
took some satisfaction in the reflection that I had not been ignobly
terrified; I had not bolted nor swooned--I had proceeded with
dignity. Nevertheless, I was certainly more comfortable when I had
put thirty miles between me and the scene of my exploit, and I
continued for many days to prefer the daylight to the dark. My nerves
had been powerfully excited; of this I was particularly conscious
when, under the influence of the drowsy air of the sea-side, my
excitement began slowly to ebb. As it disappeared, I attempted to
take a sternly rational view of my experience. Certainly I had seen
something--that was not fancy; but what had I seen? I regretted
extremely now that I had not been bolder, that I had not gone nearer
and inspected the apparition more minutely. But it was very well to
talk; I had done as much as any man in the circumstances would have
dared; it was indeed a physical impossibility that I should have
advanced. Was not this paralyzation of my powers in itself a
supernatural influence? Not necessarily, perhaps, for a sham ghost
that one accepted might do as much execution as a real ghost. But why
had I so easily accepted the sable phantom that waved its hand? Why
had it so impressed itself? Unquestionably, true or false, it was a
very clever phantom. I greatly preferred that it should have been
true--in the first place because I did not care to have shivered and
shaken for nothing, and in the second place because to have seen a
well-authenticated goblin is, as things go, a feather in a quiet
man's cap. I tried, therefore, to let my vision rest and to stop
turning it over. But an impulse stronger than my will recurred at
intervals and set a mocking question on my lips. Granted that the
apparition was Captain Diamond's daughter; if it was she it certainly
was her spirit. But was it not her spirit and something more? The
middle of September saw me again established among the theologic
shades, but I made no haste to revisit the haunted house.</p>

<p>The last of the month approached--the term of another quarter with
poor Captain Diamond---and found me indisposed to disturb his
pilgrimage on this occasion; though I confess that I thought with a
good deal of compassion of the feeble old man trudging away, lonely,
in the autumn dusk, on his extraordinary errand. On the thirtieth of
September, at noonday, I was drowsing over a heavy octavo, when I
heard a feeble rap at my door. I replied with an invitation to enter,
but as this produced no effect I repaired to the door and opened it.
Before me stood an elderly negress with her head bound in a scarlet
turban, and a white handkerchief folded across her bosom. She looked
at me intently and in silence; she had that air of supreme gravity
and decency which aged persons of her race so often wear. I stood
interrogative, and at last, drawing her hand from her ample pocket,
she held up a little book. It was the copy of Pascal's "Thoughts"
that I had given to Captain Diamond.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," she said, very mildly, "do you know this book?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said I, "my name is on the fly-leaf."</p>

<p>"It is your name--no other?"</p>

<p>"I will write my name if you like, and you can compare them," I
answered.</p>

<p>She was silent a moment and then, with dignity--"It would be
useless, sir," she said, "I can't read. If you will give me your word
that is enough. I come," she went on, "from the gentleman to whom you
gave the book. He told me to carry it as a token--a token--that is
what he called it. He is right down sick, and he wants to see
you."</p>

<p>"Captain Diamond--sick?" I cried. "Is his illness serious?"</p>

<p>"He is very bad--he is all gone."</p>

<p>I expressed my regret and sympathy, and offered to go to him
immediately, if his sable messenger would show me the way. She
assented deferentially, and in a few moments I was following her
along the sunny streets, feeling very much like a personage in the
Arabian Nights, led to a postern gate by an Ethiopian slave. My own
conductress directed her steps toward the river and stopped at a
decent little yellow house in one of the streets that descend to it.
She quickly opened the door and led me in, and I very soon found
myself in the presence of my old friend. He was in bed, in a darkened
room, and evidently in a very feeble state. He lay back on his pillow
staring before him, with his bristling hair more erect than ever, and
his intensely dark and bright old eyes touched with the glitter of
fever. His apartment was humble and scrupulously neat, and I could
see that my dusky guide was a faithful servant. Captain Diamond,
lying there rigid and pale on his white sheets, resembled some
ruggedly carven figure on the lid of a Gothic tomb. He looked at me
silently, and my companion withdrew and left us alone.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's you," he said, at last, "it's you, that good young man.
There is no mistake, is there?"</p>

<p>"I hope not; I believe I'm a good young man. But I am very sorry
you are ill. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"I am very bad, very bad; my poor old bones ache so!" and,
groaning portentously, he tried to turn toward me.</p>

<p>I questioned him about the nature of his malady and the length of
time he had been in bed, but he barely heeded me; he seemed impatient
to speak of something else. He grasped my sleeve, pulled me toward
him, and whispered quickly:</p>

<p>"You know my time's up!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I trust not," I said, mistaking his meaning. "I shall
certainly see you on your legs again."</p>

<p>"God knows!" he cried. "But I don't mean I'm dying; not yet a bit.
What I mean is, I'm due at the house. This is rent-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, exactly! But you can't go."</p>

<p>"I can't go. It's awful. I shall lose my money. If I am dying, I
want it all the same. I want to pay the doctor. I want to be buried
like a respectable man."</p>

<p>"It is this evening?" I asked.</p>

<p>"This evening at sunset, sharp."</p>

<p>He lay staring at me, and, as I looked at him in return, I
suddenly understood his motive in sending for me. Morally, as it came
into my thought, I winced. But, I suppose I looked unperturbed, for
he continued in the same tone. "I can't lose my money. Some one else
must go. I asked Belinda; but she won't hear of it."</p>

<p>"You believe the money will be paid to another person?"</p>

<p>"We can try, at least. I have never failed before and I don't
know. But, if you say I'm as sick as a dog, that my old bones ache,
that I'm dying, perhaps she'll trust you. She don't want me to
starve!"</p>

<p>"You would like me to go in your place, then?"</p>

<p>"You have been there once; you know what it is. Are you
afraid?"</p>

<p>I hesitated.</p>

<p>"Give me three minutes to reflect," I said, "and I will tell you."
My glance wandered over the room and rested on the various objects
that spoke of the threadbare, decent poverty of its occupant. There
seemed to be a mute appeal to my pity and my resolution in their
cracked and faded sparseness. Meanwhile Captain Diamond continued,
feebly:</p>

<p>"I think she'd trust you, as I have trusted you; she'll like your
face; she'll see there is no harm in you. It's a hundred and
thirty-three dollars, exactly. Be sure you put them into a safe
place."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said at last, "I will go, and, so far as it depends upon
me, you shall have the money by nine o'clock to-night."</p>

<p>He seemed greatly relieved; he took my hand and faintly pressed
it, and soon afterward I withdrew. I tried for the rest of the day
not to think of my evening's work, but, of course, I thought of
nothing else. I will not deny that I was nervous; I was, in fact,
greatly excited, and I spent my time in alternately hoping that the
mystery should prove less deep than it appeared, and yet fearing that
it might prove too shallow. The hours passed very slowly, but, as the
afternoon began to wane, I started on my mission. On the way, I
stopped at Captain Diamond's modest dwelling, to ask how he was
doing, and to receive such last instructions as he might desire to
lay upon me. The old negress, gravely and inscrutably placid,
admitted me, and, in answer to my inquiries, said that the Captain
was very low; he had sunk since the morning.</p>

<p>"You must be right smart," she said, "if you want to get back
before he drops off."</p>

<p>A glance assured me that she knew of my projected expedition,
though, in her own opaque black pupil, there was not a gleam of
self-betrayal.</p>

<p>"But why should Captain Diamond drop off'?" I asked. "He certainly
seems very weak; but I cannot make out that he has any definite
disease."</p>

<p>"His disease is old age," she said, sententiously.</p>

<p>"But he is not so old as that; sixty-seven or sixty-eight, at
most."</p>

<p>She was silent a moment.</p>

<p>"He's worn out; he's used up; he can't stand it any longer."</p>

<p>"Can I see him a moment?" I asked; upon which she led me again to
his room.</p>

<p>He was lying in the same way as when I had left him, except that
his eyes were closed. But he seemed very "low," as she had said, and
he had very little pulse. Nevertheless, I further learned the doctor
had been there in the afternoon and professed himself satisfied. "He
don't know what's been going on," said Belinda, curtly.</p>

<p>The old man stirred a little, opened his eyes, and after some time
recognized me.</p>

<p>"I'm going, you know," I said. "I'm going for your money. Have you
anything more to say?"</p>

<p>He raised himself slowly, and with a painful effort, against his
pillows; but he seemed hardly to understand me. "The house, you
know," I said. "Your daughter."</p>

<p>He rubbed his forehead, slowly, awhile, and at last, his
comprehension awoke. "Ah, yes," he murmured, "I trust you. A hundred
and thirty-three dollars. In old pieces--all in old pieces."</p>

<p>Then he added more vigorously, and with a brightening eye: "Be
very respectful--be very polite. If not--if not--" and his voice
failed again.</p>

<p>"Oh, I certainly shall be," I said, with a rather forced smile.
"But, if not?"</p>

<p>"If not, I shall know it!" he said, very gravely. And with this,
his eyes closed and he sunk down again.</p>

<p>I took my departure and pursued my journey with a sufficiently
resolute step. When I reached the house, I made a propitiatory bow in
front of it, in emulation of Captain Diamond. I had timed my walk so
as to be able to enter without delay; night had already fallen. I
turned the key, opened the door and shut it behind me. Then I struck
alight, and found the two candlesticks I had used before, standing on
the tables in the entry. I applied a match to both of them, took them
up and went into the parlor. It was empty, and though I waited
awhile, it remained empty. I passed then into the other rooms on the
same floor, and no dark image rose before me to check my steps. At
last, I came out into the halt again, and stood weighing the question
of going upstairs.</p>

<p>The staircase had been the scene of my discomfiture before, and I
approached it with profound mistrust. At the foot, I paused, looking
up, with my hand on the balustrade. I was acutely expectant, and my
expectation was justified. Slowly, in the darkness above, the black
figure that I had seen before took shape. It was not an illusion; it
was a figure, and the same. I gave it time to define itself, and
watched it stand and look down at me with its hidden face. Then,
deliberately, I lifted up my voice and spoke.</p>

<p>"I have come in place of Captain Diamond, at his request," I said.
"He is very ill; he is unable to leave his bed. He earnestly begs
that you will pay the money to me; I will immediately carry it to
him." The figure stood motionless, giving no sign. "Captain Diamond
would have come if he were able to move," I added, in a moment,
appealingly; "but, he is utterly unable."</p>

<p>At this the figure slowly unveiled its face and showed me a dim,
white mask; then it began slowly to descend the stairs. Instinctively
I fell back before it, retreating to the door of the front
sitting-room. With my eyes still fixed on it, I moved backward across
the threshold; then I stopped in the middle of the room and set down
my lights. The figure advanced; it seemed to be that of a tall woman,
dressed in vaporous black crape. As it drew near, I saw that it had a
perfectly human face, though it looked extremely pale and sad. We
stood gazing at each other; my agitation had completely vanished; I
was only deeply interested.</p>

<p>"Is my father dangerously ill?" said the apparition.</p>

<p>At the sound of its voice--gentle, tremulous, and perfectly
human--I started forward; I felt a rebound of excitement. I drew a
long breath, I gave a sort of cry, for what I saw before me was not a
disembodied spirit, but a beautiful woman, an audacious actress.
Instinctively, irresistibly, by the force of reaction against my
credulity, I stretched out my hand and seized the long veil that
muffled her head. I gave it a violent jerk, dragged it nearly off,
and stood staring at a large fair person, of about five-and-thirty. I
comprehended her at a glance; her long black dress, her pale,
sorrow-worn face, painted to look paler, her very fine eyes,--the
color of her father's,---and her sense of outrage at my movement.</p>

<p>"My father, I suppose," she cried, "did not send you here to
insult me!" and she turned away rapidly, took up one of the candles
and moved toward the door. Here she paused, looked at me again,
hesitated, and then drew a purse from her pocket and flung it down on
the floor. "There is your money!" she said, majestically.</p>

<p>I stood there, wavering between amazement and shame, and saw her
pass out into the hall.</p>

<p>Then I picked up the purse. The next moment, I heard a loud shriek
and a crash of something dropping, and she came staggering back into
the room without her light.</p>

<p>"My father--my father!" she cried; and with parted lips and
dilated eyes, she rushed toward me.</p>

<p>"Your father--where?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"In the hall, at the foot of the stairs."</p>

<p>I stepped forward to go out, but she seized my arm.</p>

<p>"He is in white," she cried, "in his shirt. It's not he!"</p>

<p>"Why, your father is in his house, in his bed, extremely ill," I
answered.</p>

<p>She looked at me fixedly, with searching eyes.</p>

<p>"Dying?"</p>

<p>"I hope not," I stuttered.</p>

<p>She gave a long moan and covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens, I have seen his ghost!" she cried.</p>

<p>She still held my arm; she seemed too terrified to release it.
"His ghost!" I echoed, wondering.</p>

<p>"It's the punishment of my long folly!" she went on.</p>

<p>"Ah," said I, "it's the punishment of my indiscretion--of my
violence!"</p>

<p>"Take me away, take me away!" she cried, still clinging to my arm.
"Not there"--as I was turning toward the hall and the front
door--"not there, for pity's sake! By this door--the back entrance."
And snatching the other candles from the table, she led me through
the neighboring room into the back part of the house. Here was a door
opening from a sort of scullery into the orchard. I turned the rusty
lock and we passed out and stood in the cool air, beneath the
stars.</p>

<p>Here my companion gathered her black drapery about her, and stood
for a moment, hesitating. I had been infinitely flurried, but my
curiosity touching her was uppermost. Agitated, pale, picturesque,
she looked, in the early evening light, very beautiful.</p>

<p>"You have been playing all these years a most extraordinary game,"
I said.</p>

<p>She looked at me somberly, and seemed disinclined to reply. "I
came in perfect good faith," I went on. "The last time--three months
ago--you remember?--you greatly frightened me."</p>

<p>"Of course it was an extraordinary game," she answered at last.
"But it was the only way."</p>

<p>"Had he not forgiven you?"</p>

<p>"So long as he thought me dead, yes. There have been things in my
life he could not forgive."</p>

<p>I hesitated and then--"And where is your husband?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I have no husband--I have never had a husband."</p>

<p>She made a gesture which checked further questions, and moved
rapidly away. I walked with her round the house to the road, and she
kept murmuring--"It was he--it was he!" When we reached the road she
stopped, and asked me which way I was going. I pointed to the road by
which I had come, and she said--"I take the other. You are going to
my father's?" she added.</p>

<p>"Directly," I said.</p>

<p>"Will you let me know to-morrow what you have found?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure. But how shall I communicate with you?"</p>

<p>She seemed at a loss, and looked about her, "Write a few words,"
she said, "and put them under that stone." And she pointed to one of
the lava slabs that bordered the old well. I gave her my promise to
comply, and she turned away. "I know my road," she said. "Everything
is arranged. It's an old story."</p>

<p>She left me with a rapid step, and as she receded into the
darkness, resumed, with the dark flowing lines of her drapery, the
phantasmal appearance with which she had at first appeared to me. I
watched her till she became invisible, and then I took my own leave
of the place. I returned to town at a swinging pace, and marched
straight to the little yellow house near the river. I took the
liberty of entering without a knock, and, encountering no
interruption, made my way to Captain Diamond's room. Outside the
door, on a low bench, with folded arms, sat the sable Belinda.</p>

<p>"How is he?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He's gone to glory."</p>

<p>"Dead?" I cried.</p>

<p>She rose with a sort of tragic chuckle.</p>

<p>"He's as big a ghost as any of them now!".I passed into the room
and found the old man lying there irredeemably rigid and still. I
wrote that evening a few lines which I proposed on the morrow to
place beneath the stone, near the well; but my promise was not
destined to be executed. I slept that night very ill--it was
natural---and in my restlessness left my bed to walk about the room.
As I did so I caught sight, in passing my window, of a red glow in
the north-western sky. A house was on fire in the country, and
evidently burning fast. It lay in the same direction as the scene of
my evening's adventures, and as I stood watching the crimson horizon
I was startled by a sharp memory. I had blown out the candle which
lighted me, with my companion, to the door through which we escaped,
but I had not accounted for the other light, which she had carried
into the hall and dropped--heaven knew where--in her consternation.
The next day I walked out with my folded letter and turned into the
familiar cross-road. The haunted house was a mass of charred beams
and smoldering ashes; the well cover had been pulled off, in quest of
water, by the few neighbors who had had the audacity to contest what
they must have regarded as a demon-kindled blaze, the loose stones
were completely displaced, and the earth had been trampled into
puddles.</p>

<h2><a name="s2"></a>The Romance of Certain Old Clothes</h2>

<p>Towards the middle of the eighteenth century there lived in the
Province of Massachusetts a widowed gentlewoman, the mother of three
children, by name Mrs Veronica Wingrave. She had lost her husband
early in life, and had devoted herself to the care of her progeny.
These young persons grew up in a manner to reward her tenderness and
to gratify her highest hopes. The first-born was a son, whom she had
called Bernard, after his father. The others were daughters--born at
an interval of three years apart. Good looks were traditional in the
family, and this youthful trio were not likely to allow the tradition
to perish. The boy was of that fair and ruddy complexion and that
athletic structure which in those days (as in these) were the sign of
good English descent--a frank, affectionate young fellow, a
deferential son, a patronizing brother, a steadfast friend. Clever,
however, he was not; the wit of the family had been apportioned
chiefly to his sisters. The late Mr Wingrave had been a great reader
of Shakespeare, at a time when this pursuit implied more freedom of
thought than at the present day, and in a community where it required
much courage to patronize the drama even in the closet: and he had
wished to call attention to his admiration of the great poet by
calling his daughters out of his favourite plays.</p>

<p>Upon the elder he had bestowed the romantic name of Rosalind, and
the younger he had called Perdita, in memory of a little girl born
between them, who had lived but a few weeks.</p>

<p>When Bernard Wingrave came to his sixteenth year his mother put a
brave face upon it and prepared to execute her husband's last
injunction. This had been a formal command that, at the proper age,
his son should be sent out to England, to complete his education at
the university of Oxford, where he himself had acquired his taste for
elegant literature. It was Mrs Wingrave's belief that the lad's equal
was not to be found in the two hemispheres, but she had the old
traditions of literal obedience. She swallowed her sobs, and made up
her boy's trunk and his simple provincial outfit, and sent him on his
way across the seas. Bernard presented himself at his father's
college, and spent five years in England, without great honour,
indeed, but with a vast deal of pleasure and no discredit. On leaving
the university he made the journey to France.</p>

<p>In his twenty-fourth year he took ship for home, prepared to find
poor little New England (New England was very small in those days) a
very dull, unfashionable residence. But there had been changes at
home, as well as in Mr Bernard's opinions. He found his mother's
house quite habitable, and his sisters grown into two very charming
young ladies, with all the accomplishments and graces of the young
women of Britain, and a certain native-grown originality and
wildness, which, if it was not an accomplishment, was certainly a
grace the more.</p>

<p>Bernard privately assured his mother that his sisters were fully a
match for the most genteel young women in the old country; whereupon
poor Mrs Wingrave, you may be sure, bade them hold up their heads.
Such was Bernard's opinion, and such, in a tenfold higher degree, was
the opinion of Mr Arthur Lloyd. This gentleman was a college-mate of
Mr Bernard, a young man of reputable family, of a good person and a
handsome inheritance; which latter appurtenance he proposed to invest
in trade in the flourishing colony. He and Bernard were sworn
friends; they had crossed the ocean together, and the young American
had lost no time in presenting him at his mother's house, where he
had made quite as good an impression as that which he had received
and of which I have just given a hint.</p>

<p>The two sisters were at this time in all the freshness of their
youthful bloom; each wearing, of course, this natural brilliancy in
the manner that became her best. They were equally dissimilar in
appearance and character. Rosalind, the elder--now in her
twenty-second year--was tall and white, with calm grey eyes and
auburn tresses; a very faint likeness to the Rosalind of
Shakespeare's comedy, whom I imagine a brunette (if you will), but a
slender, airy creature, full of the softest, quickest impulses. Miss
Wingrave, with her slightly lymphatic fairness, her fine arms, her
majestic height, her slow utterance, was not cut out for adventures.
She would never have put on a man's jacket and hose; and, indeed,
being a very plump beauty, she may have had reasons apart from her
natural dignity. Perdita, too, might very well have exchanged the
sweet melancholy of her name against something more in consonance
with her aspect and disposition.</p>

<p>She had the cheek of a gypsy and the eye of an eager child, as
well as the smallest waist and lightest foot in all the country of
the Puritans. When you spoke to her she never made you wait, as her
handsome sister was wont to do (while she looked at you with a cold
fine eye), but gave you your choke of a dozen answers before you had
uttered half your thought.</p>

<p>The young girls were very glad to see their brother once more; but
they found themselves quite able to spare part of their attention for
their brother's friend. Among the young men their friends and
neighbours, the belle jeunesse of the Colony, there were many
excellent fellows, several devoted swains, and some two or three who
enjoyed the reputation of universal charmers and conquerors. But the
homebred arts and somewhat boisterous gallantry of these honest
colonists were completely eclipsed by the good looks, the fine
clothes, the punctilious courtesy, the perfect elegance, the immense
information, of Mr Arthur Lloyd. He was in reality no paragon; he was
a capable, honourable, civil youth, rich in pounds sterling, in his
health and complacency and his little capital of uninvested
affections. But he was a gentleman; he had a handsome person; he had
studied and travelled; he spoke French, he played the flute, and he
read verses aloud with very great taste. There were a dozen reasons
why Miss Wingrave and her sister should have thought their other male
acquaintance made but a poor figure before such a perfect man of the
world. Mr Lloyd's anecdotes told our little New England maidens a
great deal more of the ways and means of people of fashion in
European capitals than he had any idea of doing. It was delightful to
sit by and hear him and Bernard talk about the fine people and fine
things they had seen. They would all gather round the fire after tea,
in the little wainscoted parlour, and the two young men would remind
each other, across the rug, of this, that and the other adventure.
Rosalind and Perdita would often have given their ears to know
exactly what adventure it was, and where it happened, and who was
there, and what the ladies had on; but in those days a well-bred
young woman was not expected to break into the conversation of her
elders, or to ask too many questions; and the poor girls used
therefore to sit fluttering behind the more languid--or more
discreet--curiosity of their mother.</p>

<p>II That they were both very fine girls Arthur Lloyd was not slow
to discover; but it took him some time to make up his mind whether he
liked the big sister or the little sister best. He had a strong
presentiment--an emotion of a nature entirely too cheerful to be
called a foreboding--that he was destined to stand up before the
parson with one of them; yet he was unable to arrive at a preference,
and for such a consummation a preference was certainly necessary, for
Lloyd had too much young blood in his veins to make a choice by lot
and be cheated of the satisfaction of falling in love. He resolved to
take things as they came--to let his heart speak. Meanwhile he was on
very pleasant footing. Mrs Wingrave showed a dignified indifference
to his 'intentions', equally remote from a carelessness of her
daughter's honour and from that sharp alacrity to make him come to
the point, which, in his quality of young man of property, he had too
often encountered in the worldly matrons of his native islands. As
for Bernard, all that he asked was that his friend should treat his
sisters as his own; and as for the poor girls themselves, however
each may have secretly longed that their visitor should do or say
something 'marked', they kept a very modest and contented
demeanour.</p>

<p>Towards each other, however, they were somewhat more on the
offensive. They were good friends enough, and accommodating
bed-fellows (they shared the same four-poster), betwixt whom it would
take more than a day for the seeds of jealousy to sprout and bear
fruit; but they felt that the seeds had been sown on the day that Mr
Lloyd came into the house. Each made up her mind that, if she should
be slighted, she would bear her grief in silence, and that no one
should be any the wiser; for if they had a great deal of ambition,
they had also a large share of pride. But each prayed in secret,
nevertheless, that upon her the selection, the distinction, might
fall. They had need of a vast deal of patience, of self-control, of
dissimulation. In those days a young girl of decent breeding could
make no advances whatever, and barely respond, indeed, to those that
were made. She was expected to sit still in her chair, with her eyes
on the carpet, watching the spot where the mystic handkerchief should
fall. Poor Arthur Lloyd was obliged to carry on his wooing in the
little wainscoted parlour, before the eyes of Mrs Wingrave, her son,
and his prospective sister-in-law. But youth and love are so cunning
that a hundred signs and tokens might travel to and fro, and not one
of these three pairs of eyes detect them in their passage. The two
maidens were almost always together, and had plenty of chances to
betray themselves. That each knew she was being watched, made not a
grain of difference in the little offices they mutually rendered, or
in the various household tasks they performed in common.</p>

<p>Neither flinched nor fluttered beneath the silent battery of her
sister's eyes. The only apparent change in their habits was that they
had less to say to each other. It was impossible to talk about Mr
Lloyd, and it was ridiculous to talk about anything else. By tacit
agreement they began to wear all their choice finery, and to devise
such little implements of conquest, in the way of ribbons and
top-knots and kerchiefs, as were sanctioned by indubitable modesty.
They executed in the same inarticulate fashion a contract of fair
play in this exciting game. 'Is it better so?'</p>

<p>Rosalind would ask, tying a bunch of ribbons on her bosom, and
turning about from her glass to her sister. Perdita would look up
gravely from her work and examine the decoration. 'I think you had
better give it another loop,' she would say, with great solemnity,
looking hard at her sister with eyes that added, 'upon my honour!' So
they were for ever stitching and turning their petticoats, and
pressing out their muslins, and contriving washes and ointments and
cosmetics, like the ladies in the household of the vicar of
Wakefield. Some three or four months went by; it grew to be
midwinter, and as yet Rosalind knew that if Perdita had nothing more
to boast of than she, there was not much to be feared from her
rivalry. But Perdita by this time--the charming Perdita--felt that
her secret had grown to be tenfold more precious than her
sister's.</p>

<p>One afternoon Miss Wingrave sat alone--that was a rare
accident--before her toilet-glass, combing out her long hair. It was
getting too dark to see; she lit the two candles in their sockets, on
the frame of her mirror, and then went to the window to draw her
curtains. It was a grey December evening; the landscape was bare and
bleak, and the sky heavy with snowclouds. At the end of the large
garden into which her window looked was a wall with a little postern
door, opening into a lane. The door stood ajar, as she could vaguely
see in the gathering darkness, and moved slowly to and fro, as if
someone were swaying it from the lane without. It was doubtless a
servant-maid who had been having a tryst with her sweetheart. But as
she was about to drop her curtain Rosalind saw her sister step into
the garden and hum' along the path which led to the house. She
dropped the curtain, all save a little crevice for her eyes. As
Perdita came up the path she seemed to be examining something in her
hand, holding it close to her eyes. When she reached the house she
stopped a moment, looked intently at the object, and pressed it to
her lips.</p>

<p>Poor Rosalind slowly came back to her chair and sat down before
her glass where, if she had looked at it less abstractly, she would
have seen her handsome features sadly disfigured by jealousy. A
moment afterwards the door opened behind her and her sister came into
the room, out of breath, her cheeks aglow with the chilly air.</p>

<p>Perdita started. 'Ah,' said she, 'I thought you were with our
mother.' The ladies were to go to a tea-party, and on such occasions
it was the habit of one of the girls to help their mother to
dress.</p>

<p>Instead of coming in, Perdita lingered at the door.</p>

<p>'Come in, come in,' said Rosalind. 'We have more than an hour yet.
I should like you very much to give a few strokes to my hair.' She
knew that her sister wished to retreat, and that she could see in the
glass all her movements in the room. 'Nay, just help me with my
hair,' she said, 'and I will go to mamma.'</p>

<p>Perdita came reluctantly, and took the brush. She saw her sister's
eyes, in the glass, fastened hard upon her hands. She had not made
three passes when Rosalind clapped her own right hand upon her
sister's left, and started out of her chair. "Whose ring is that?"
she cried, passionately, drawing her towards the light.</p>

<p>On the young girl's third finger glistened a little gold ring,
adorned with a very small sapphire.</p>

<p>Perdita felt that she need no longer keep her secret, yet that she
must put a bold face on her avowal. 'It's mine,' she said
proudly.</p>

<p>'Who gave it to you?' cried the other.</p>

<p>Perdita hesitated a moment. 'Mr Lloyd.'</p>

<p>'Mr Lloyd is generous, all of a sudden.'</p>

<p>'Ah no,' cried Perdita, with spirit, 'not all of a sudden! He
offered it to me a month ago.'</p>

<p>'And you needed a month's begging to take it?' said Rosalind,
looking at the little trinket, which indeed was not especially
elegant, although it was the best that the jeweller of the Province
could furnish. 'I wouldn't have taken it in less than two.'</p>

<p>'It isn't the ring,' Perdita answered, 'it's what it means!'</p>

<p>'It means that you are not a modest girl!' cried Rosalind. 'Pray,
does your mother know of your intrigue? does Bernard?'</p>

<p>'My mother has approved my "intrigue", as you call it. My Lloyd
has asked for my hand, and mamma has given it. Would you have had him
apply to you, dearest sister?'</p>

<p>Rosalind gave her companion a long look, full of passionate envy
and sorrow. Then she dropped her lashes on her pale cheeks and turned
away. Perdita felt that it had not been a pretty scene; but it was
her sister's fault. However, the elder girl rapidly called back her
pride, and turned herself about again. 'You have my very best
wishes,' she said, with a low curtsey. 'I wish you every happiness,
and a very long life.'</p>

<p>Perdita gave a bitter laugh. 'Don't speak in that tone!' she
cried. 'I would rather you should curse me outright. Come, Rosy,' she
added, 'he couldn't marry both of us.'</p>

<p>'I wish you very great joy,' Rosalind repeated, mechanically,
sitting down to her glass again, 'and a very long life, and plenty of
children.' There was something in the sound of these words not at all
to Perdita's taste, 'Will you give me a year to live at least?' she
said. 'In a year I can have one little boy--or one little girl at
least.</p>

<p>If you will give me your brush again I will do your hair.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said Rosalind. 'You had better go to mamma. It isn't
becoming that a young lady with a promised husband should wait on a
girl with none.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' said Perdita good-humouredly, 'I have Arthur to wait upon
me. You need my service more than I need yours.'</p>

<p>But her sister motioned her away, and she left the room. When she
had gone poor Rosalind fell on her knees before her dressing-table,
buried her head in her arms, and poured out a flood of tears and
sobs. She felt very much the better for this effusion of sorrow. When
her sister came back she insisted on helping her to dress--on her
wearing her prettiest things. She forced upon her acceptance a bit of
lace of her own, and declared that now that she was to be married she
should do her best to appear worthy of her lover's choice. She
discharged these offices in stern silence; but, such as they were,
they had to do duty as an apology and an atonement; she never made
any other.</p>

<p>Now that Lloyd was received by the family as an accepted suitor
nothing remained but to fix the wedding-day. It was appointed for the
following April, and in the interval preparations were diligently
made for the marriage. Lloyd, on his side, was buss with his
commercial arrangements, and with establishing a correspondence with
the great mercantile house to which he had attached himself in
England. He was therefore not so frequent a visitor at Mrs Wingrave's
as during the months of his diffidence and irresolution, and poor
Rosalind had less to suffer than she had feared from the sight of the
mutual endearments of the young lovers. Touching his future
sister-in--law Lloyd had a perfectly clear conscience. There had not
been a particle of love-making between them, and he had not the
slightest suspicion that he had dealt her a terrible blow. He was
quite at his ease; life promised so well, both domestically and
financially. The great revolt of the Colonies Was not yet in the air,
and that his connubial felicity should take a tragic turn it was
absurd, it was blasphemous, to apprehend. Meanwhile, at Mrs
Wingrave's, there was a greater rustling of silks, a more rapid
clicking of scissors and flying of needles, than ever. The good lady
had determined that her daughter should carry from home the
genteelest outfit that her money could buy or that the country could
furnish. All the sage women in the Province were convened, and their
united taste was brought to bear on Perdita's wardrobe. Rosalind's
situation, at this moment, was assuredly not to be envied. The poor
girl had an inordinate love of dress, and the very best taste in the
world, as her sister perfectly well knew. Rosalind was tall, she was
stately and sweeping, she was made to earn stiff brocade and masses
of heavy lace, such as belong to the toilet of a rich man's wife. But
Rosalind sat aloof with her beautiful arms folded and her head
averted, while her mother and sister and the venerable women
aforesaid worried and wondered over their materials, oppressed by the
multitude of their resources. One day there came in a beautiful piece
of white silk, brocaded with heavenly blue and silver sent by the
bridegroom himself--it not being thought amiss in those days that the
husband-elect should contribute to the bride's trousseau. Perdita
could think of no form or fashion which would do sufficient honour to
the splendour of the material.</p>

<p>'Blue's your colour, sister, more than mine,' she said, with
appealing eyes. 'It is a pity it's not for you. You would know what
to do with it.'</p>

<p>Rosalind got up from her place and looked at the great shining
fabric, as it lay spread over the back of a chair. Then she took it
up in her hands and felt it--lovingly, as Perdita could see--and
turned about towards the mirror with it. She let it roll down to her
feet, and flung the other end over her shoulder, gathering it in
about her waist with her white arm, which was bare to the elbow. She
threw back her head, and looked at her image, and a hanging tress of
her auburn hair fell upon the gorgeous surface of the silk. It made a
dazzling picture. The women standing about uttered a little 'Look,
look!' of admiration. 'Yes, indeed,' said Rosalind, quietly, 'blue is
my colour.' But Perdita could see that her fancy had been stirred,
and that she would now fall to work and solve all their silken
riddles. And indeed she behaved very well, as Perdita, knowing her
insatiable love of millinery, was quite ready to declare. Innumerable
yards of lustrous silk and satin, of muslin, velvet and lace, passed
through her cunning hands, without a jealous word coming from her
lips. Thanks to her industry, when the wedding-day came Perdita was
prepared to espouse more of the vanities of life than any fluttering
young bride who had yet received the sacramental blessing of a New
England divine.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that the young couple should go out and spend
the first days of their wedded life at the country-house of an
English gentleman--a man of rank and a very kind friend to Arthur
Lloyd. He was a bachelor; he declared he should be delighted to give
up the place to the influence of Hymen. After the ceremony at
church--it had been performed by an English clergyman--young Mrs
Lloyd hastened back to her mother's house to change her nuptial robes
for a riding-dress. Rosalind helped her to effect the change, in the
little homely room in which they had spent their undivided younger
years. Perdita then hurried off to bid farewell to her mother,
leaving Rosalind to follow. Then parting was short; the horses were
at the door, and Arthur was impatient to start. But Rosalind had not
followed, and Perdita hastened back to her room, opening the door
abruptly. Rosalind, as usual, was before the glass, but in a position
which caused the other to stand still, amazed. She had dressed
herself in Perdita's cast-off wedding veil and wreath, and on her
neck she had hung the full string of pearls which the young girl had
received from her husband as a wedding-gift. These things had been
hastily laid aside, to await their possessor's disposal on her return
from the country. Bedizened by this unnatural garb Rosalind stood
before the mirror, plunging a long look into its depths and reading
heaven knows what audacious visions. Perdita was horrified. It was a
hideous image of their old rivalry come to life again. She made a
step towards her sister, as if to pull off the veil and the flowers.
But catching her eyes in the glass, she stopped.</p>

<p>'Farewell, sweetheart,' she said. 'You might at least have waited
till I had got out of the house!' And she hurried away from the
room.</p>

<p>Mr Lloyd had purchased in Boston a house which to the taste of
those days appeared as elegant as it was commodious; and here he very
soon established himself with his young wife. He was thus separated
by a distance of twenty miles from the residence of his
mother-in-law. Twenty miles, in that primitive era of roads and
conveyances, were as serious a matter as a hundred at the present
day, and Mrs Wingrave saw but little of her daughter during the first
twelvemonth of her marriage. She suffered in no small degree from
Perdita's absence; and her affliction was not diminished by the fact
that Rosalind had fallen into terribly low spirits and was not to be
roused or cheered but by change of air and company. The real cause of
the young lady's dejection the reader will not be slow to suspect.
Mrs Wingrave and her gossips, however, deemed her complaint a mere
bodily ill, and doubted not that she would obtain relief from the
remedy just mentioned. Her mother accordingly proposed, on her
behalf, a visit to certain relatives on the paternal side,
established in New York, who had long complained that they were able
to see so little of their New England cousins. Rosalind was
despatched to these good people, under a suitable escort, and
remained with them for several months. In the interval her brother
Bernard, who had begun the practice of the law, made up his mind to
take a wife. Rosalind came home to the wedding, apparently cured of
her heartache, with bright roses and lilies in her face and a proud
smile on her lips. Arthur Lloyd came over from Boston to see his
brother-in-law married, but without his wife, who was expecting very
soon to present him with an heir. It was nearly a year since Rosalind
had seen him. She was glad--she hardly knew why--that Perdita had
stayed at home. Arthur looked happy, but he was more grave and
important than before his marriage.</p>

<p>She thought he looked 'interesting'--for although the word, in its
modern sense, was not then invented, we may be sure that the idea
was. The truth is, he was simply anxious about his wife and her
coming ordeal, Nevertheless, he by no means failed to observe
Rosalind's beauty and splendour, and to note how she effaced the poor
little bride. The allowance that Perdita had enjoyed for her dress
had now been transferred to her sister, who turned it to wonderful
account.</p>

<p>On the morning after the wedding he had a lady's saddle put on the
horse of the servant who had come with him from town, and went out
with the young girl for a ride. It was a keen, clear morning in
January; the ground was bare and hard, and the horses in good
condition--to say nothing of Rosalind, who was charming in her hat
and plume, and her dark blue riding coat, trimmed with fur. They rode
all the morning, lost their way and were obliged to stop for dinner
at a farmhouse. The early winter dusk had fallen when they got home.
Mrs Wingrave met them with a long face. A messenger had arrived at
noon from Mrs Lloyd; she was beginning to be ill, she desired her
husband's immediate return. The young man, at the thought that he had
lost several hours, and that by hard riding he might already have
been with his wife, uttered a passionate oath. He barely consented to
stop for a mouthful of supper, but mounted the messenger's horse and
started off at a gallop.</p>

<p>He reached home at midnight. His wife had been delivered of a
little girl. 'Ah, why weren't you with me?' she said, as he came to
her bedside.</p>

<p>'I was out of the house when the man came. I was with Rosalind,'
said Lloyd, innocently.</p>

<p>Mrs Lloyd made a little moan, and turned away. But she continued
to do very well, and for a week her improvement was uninterrupted.
Finally, however, through some indiscretion in the way of diet or
exposure, it was checked, and the poor lady grew rapidly worse. Lloyd
was in despair. It very soon became evident that she was breathing
her last. Mrs Lloyd came to a sense of her approaching end, and
declared that she was reconciled with death. On the third evening
after the change took place she told her husband that she felt she
should not get through the night. She dismissed her servants, and
also requested her mother to withdraw--Mrs Wingrave having arrived on
the preceding day. She had had her infant placed on the bed beside
her, and she lay on her side, with the child against her breast,
holding her husband's hands. The night-lamp was hidden behind the
heavy curtains of the bed, but the room was illuminated with a red
glow from the immense fire of logs on the hearth.</p>

<p>'It seems strange not to be warmed into life by such a fire as
that,' the young woman said, feebly trying to smile. 'If I had but a
little of it in my veins! But I have given all my fire to this little
spark of mortality.' And she dropped her eyes on her child. Then
raising them she looked at her husband with a long, penetrating gaze.
The last feeling which lingered in her heart was one of suspicion.
She had not recovered from the shock which Arthur had given her by
telling her that in the hour of her agony he had been with Rosalind.
She trusted her husband very nearly as well as she loved him; but now
that she was called away forever she felt a cold horror of her
sister. She felt in her soul that Rosalind had never ceased to be
jealous of her good fortune; and a year of happy security had not
effaced the young girl's image, dressed in her wedding-garments, and
smiling with simulated triumph. Now that Arthur was to be alone, what
might not Rosalind attempt? She was beautiful, she was engaging; what
arts might she not use, what impression might she not make upon the
young man's saddened heart? Mrs Lloyd looked at her husband in
silence. It seemed hard, after all, to doubt of his constancy. His
fine eyes were filled with tears; his face was convulsed with
weeping; the clasp of his hands was warm and passionate. How noble he
looked, how tender, how faithful and devoted! 'Nay,' thought Perdita,
'he's not for such a one as Rosalind. He'll never forget me. Nor does
Rosalind truly care for him; she cares only for vanities and finery
and jewels.' And she lowered her eyes on her white hands, which her
husband's liberality had covered with rings, and on the lace ruffles
which trimmed the edge of her nightdress. 'She covets my rings and my
laces more than she covets my husband.'</p>

<p>At this moment the thought of her sister's rapacity seemed to cast
a dark shadow between her and the helpless figure of her little girl.
'Arthur,' she said, 'you must take off my rings. I shall not be
buried in them. One of these days my daughter shall wear them--my
rings and my laces and silks. I had them all brought out and shown me
today. It's a great wardrobe--there's not such another in the
Province; I can say it without vanity, now that I have done with it.
It will be a great inheritance for my daughter when she grows into a
young woman. There are things there that a man never buys twice, and
if they are lost you will never again see the like. So you will watch
them well. Some dozen things I have left to Rosalind: I have named
them to my mother. I have given her that blue and silver; it was
meant for her; I wore it only once, I looked ill in it.</p>

<p>But the rest are to be sacredly kept for this little innocent.
It's such a providence that she should be my colour; she can wear my
gowns; she has her mother's eyes. You know the same fashions come
back even twenty years. She can wear my gowns as they are. They will
lie there quietly waiting till she grows into them--wrapped in
camphor and rose-leaves, and keeping their colours in the
sweetscented darkness. She shall have black hair, she shall wear my
carnation satin. Do you promise me, Arthur?'</p>

<p>'Promise you what, dearest?'</p>

<p>'Promise me to keep your poor little wife's old gowns.'</p>

<p>'Are you afraid I shall sell them?'</p>

<p>'No, but that they may get scattered, My mother will have them
properly wrapped up, and you shall lay them away under a double-lock.
Do you know the great chest in the attic, with the iron bands? There
is no end to what it will hold. You can put them all there. My mother
and the housekeeper will do it, and give you the key. And you will
keep the key in your secretary, and never give it to anyone but your
child. Do you promise me?'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes, I promise you,' said Lloyd, puzzled at the intensity
with which his wife appeared to cling to this idea.</p>

<p>'Will you swear?' repeated Perdita.</p>

<p>'Yes, I swear.'</p>

<p>'Well--I trust you--I trust you,' said the poor lady, looking into
his eyes with eyes in which, if he had suspected her vague
apprehensions, he might have read an appeal quite as much as an
assurance.</p>

<p>Lloyd bore his bereavement rationally and manfully. A month after
his wife's death, in the course of business, circumstances arose
which offered him an opportunity of going to England.</p>

<p>He took advantage of it, to change the current of his thoughts. He
was absent nearly a year, during which his little girl was tenderly
nursed and guarded by her grandmother. On his return he had his house
again thrown open, and announced his intention of keeping the same
state as during his wife's lifetime. It very soon came to be
predicted that he would marry again, and there were at least a dozen
young women of whom one may say that it was by no fault of theirs
that, for six months after his return, the prediction did not come
true. During this interval he still left his little daughter in Mrs
Wingrave's hands, the latter assuring him that a change of residence
at so tender an age would be full of danger for her health. Finally,
however, he declared that his heart longed for his daughter's
presence and that she must be brought up to town. He sent his coach
and his housekeeper to fetch her home. Mrs Wingrave was in terror
lest something should befall her on the road; and, in accordance with
this feeling. Rosalind offered to accompany her.</p>

<p>She could return the next day. So she went up to town with her
little niece, and Mr Lloyd met her on the threshold of his house,
overcome with her kindness and with paternal joy. Instead of
returning the next day Rosalind stayed out the week; and when at last
she reappeared, she had only come for her clothes. Arthur would not
hear of her coming home, nor would the baby. That little person cried
and choked if Rosalind left her; and at the sight of her grief Arthur
lost his wits, and swore that she was going to die. In fine, nothing
would suit them but that the aunt should remain until the little
niece had grown used to strange faces.</p>

<p>It took two months to bring this consummation about; for it was
not until this period had elapsed that Rosalind took leave of her
brother-in-law. Mrs Wingrave had shaken her head over her daughter's
absence; she had declared that it was not becoming, that it was the
talk of the whole country. She had reconciled herself to it only
because, during the girl's visit, the household enjoyed an unwonted
term of peace. Bernard Wingrave had brought his wife home to live,
between whom and her sister-in-law there was as little love as you
please. Rosalind was perhaps no angel; but in the daily practice of
life she was a sufficiently good-natured girl, and if she quarrelled
with Mrs Bernard, it was not without provocation. Quarrel, however,
she did, to the great annoyance not only of her antagonist, but of
the two spectators of these constant altercations. Her stay in the
household of her brother-in-law, therefore, would have been
delightful, if only because it removed her from contact with the
object of her antipathy at home.</p>

<p>It was doubly--it was ten times--delightful, in that it kept her
near the object of her early passion. Mrs Lloyd's sharp suspicions
had fallen very far short of the truth. Rosalind's sentiment had been
a passion at first, and a passion it remained--a passion of whose
radiant heat, tempered to the delicate state of his feelings, Mr
Lloyd very soon felt the influence. Lloyd, as I have hinted, was not
a modern Petrarch; it was not in his nature to practise an ideal
constancy. He had not been many days in the house with his
sister-in-law before he began to assure himself that she was, in the
language of that day, a devilish fine woman. Whether Rosalind really
practised those insidious arts that her sister had been tempted to
impute to her it is needless to enquire. It is enough to say that she
found means to appear to the very best advantage. She used to seat
herself every morning before the big fireplace in the dining-room, at
work upon a piece of tapestry, with her little niece disporting
herself on the carpet at her feet, or on the train of her dress, and
playing with her woollen balls. Lloyd would have been a very stupid
fellow if he had remained insensible to the rich suggestions of this
charming picture. He was exceedingly fond of his little girl, and was
never weary of taking her in his arms and tossing her up and down,
and making her crow with delight. Very often, however, he would
venture upon greater liberties than the young lady was yet prepared
to allow, and then she would suddenly vociferate her displeasure.</p>

<p>Rosalind, at this, would drop her tapestry, and put out her
handsome hands with the serious smile of the young girl whose virgin
fancy has revealed to her all a mother's healing arts. Lloyd would
give up the child, their eyes would meet, their hands would touch,
and Rosalind would extinguish the little girl's sobs upon the snowy
folds of the kerchief that crossed her bosom. Her dignity was
perfect, and nothing could be more discreet than the manner in which
she accepted her brother-in-law's hospitality. It may almost be said,
perhaps, that there was something harsh in her reserve. Lloyd had a
provoking feeling that she was in the house and yet was
unapproachable. Half-an-hour after supper, at the very outset of the
long winter evenings, she would light her candle, make the young man
a most respectful curtsey, and march off to bed. If these were arts,
Rosalind was a great artist. But their effect was so gentle, so
gradual, they were calculated to work upon the young widower's fancy
with a crescendo so finely shaded, that, as the reader has seen,
several weeks elapsed before Rosalind began to feel sure that her
returns would cover her outlay. When this became morally certain she
packed up her trunk and returned to her mother's house. For three
days she waited: on the fourth Mr Lloyd made his appearance---a
respectful but pressing suitor, Rosalind heard him to the end, with
great humility, and accepted him with infinite modesty. It is hard to
imagine that Mrs Lloyd would have forgiven her husband; but if
anything might have disarmed her resentment it would have been the
ceremonious continence of this interview. Rosalind imposed upon her
lover but a short probation. They were married, as was becoming, with
great privacy--almost with secrecy--in the hope perhaps, as was
waggishly remarked at the time, that the late Mrs Lloyd wouldn't hear
of it.</p>

<p>The marriage was to all appearance a happy one, and each party
obtained what each had desired--Lloyd 'a devilish fine woman', and
Rosalind--but Rosalind's desires, as the reader will have observed,
had remained a good deal of a mystery. There were, indeed, two blots
upon their felicity, but time would perhaps efface them. During the
first three years of her marriage Mrs Lloyd failed to become a
mother, and her husband on his side suffered heavy losses of
money.</p>

<p>This latter circumstance compelled a material retrenchment in his
expenditure, and Rosalind was perforce less of a fine lady than her
sister had been. She contrived, however, to carry it like a woman of
considerable fashion. She had long since ascertained that her
sister's copious wardrobe had been sequestrated for the benefit of
her daughter, and that it lay languishing in thankless gloom in the
dusty attic. It was a revolting thought that these exquisite fabrics
should await the good pleasure of a little girl who sat in a high
chair and ate bread-and-milk with a wooden spoon. Rosalind had the
good taste, however, to say nothing about the matter until several
months had expired. Then, at last, she timidly broached it to her
husband. Was it not a pity that so much finery should be lost?--for
lost it would be, what with colours fading, and moths eating it up,
and the change of fashions. But Lloyd gave her so abrupt and
peremptory a refusal, that she saw, for the present, her attempt was
vain. Six months went by, however, and brought with them new needs
and new visions. Rosalind's thoughts hovered lovingly about her
sister's relies. She went up and looked at the chest in which they
lay imprisoned. There was a sullen defiance in its three great
padlocks and its iron bands which only quickened her cupidity.</p>

<p>There was something exasperating in its incorruptible immobility.
It was like a grim and grizzled old household servant, who locks his
jaws over a family secret. And then there was a look of capacity in
its vast extent, and a sound as of dense fullness, when Rosalind
knocked its side with the toe of her little shoe, which caused her to
flush with baffled longing. 'It's absurd,' she cried; 'it's improper,
it's wicked'; and she forthwith resolved upon another attack upon her
husband.</p>

<p>On the following day, after dinner, when he had had his wine, she
boldly began it. But he cut her short with great sternness.</p>

<p>'Once for all, Rosalind,' said he, 'it's out of the question. I
shall be gravely displeased if you return to the matter.'</p>

<p>'Very good,' said Rosalind. 'I am glad to learn the esteem in
which I held. Gracious heaven,' she cried, 'I am a very happy woman!
It's an agreeable thing to feel one's self sacrificed to a caprice!'
And her eyes filled with tears of anger and disappointment.</p>

<p>Lloyd had a good-natured man's horror of a woman's sobs, and he
attempted--I may say he condescended--to explain. 'It's not a
caprice, dear, it's a promise,' he said--'an oath.'</p>

<p>'An oath? It's a pretty matter for oaths! and to whom, pray?'</p>

<p>'To Perdita,' said the young man, raising his eyes for an instant,
and immediately dropping them.</p>

<p>'Perdita--ah, Perdita!' and Rosalind's tears broke forth. Her
bosom heaved with stormy sobs--sobs which were the long-deferred
sequel of the violent fit of weeping in which she had indulged
herself on the night when she discovered her sister's betrothal. She
had hoped, in her better moments, that she had done with her
jealousy; but her temper, on that occasion, had taken an ineffaceable
hold, 'And pray, what right had Perdita to dispose of my future?' she
cried.</p>

<p>'What right had she to bind you to meanness and cruelty? Ah, I
occupy a dignified place, and I make a very fine figure! I am welcome
to what Perdita has left! And what has she left? I never knew till
now how little! Nothing, nothing, nothing.'</p>

<p>This was very poor logic, but it was very good as a 'scene'. Lloyd
put his arm around his wife's waist and tried to kiss her, but she
shook him off with magnificent scorn. Poor fellow! he had coveted a
'devilish fine woman', and he had got one. Her scorn was intolerable.
He walked away with his ears tingling--irresolute, distracted. Before
him was his secretary, and in it the sacred key which with his own
hand he had turned in the triple lock. He marched up and opened it,
and took the key from a secret drawer, wrapped in a little packet
which he had sealed with his own honest bit of glazonry. Je garde,
said the motto--'I keep.' But he was ashamed to put it back. He flung
it upon the table beside his wife.</p>

<p>'Put it back!' she cried. 'I want it not. I hate it!'</p>

<p>'I wash my hands of it,' cried her husband. 'God forgive me!'</p>

<p>Mrs Lloyd gave an indignant shrug of her shoulders, and swept out
of the room, while the young man retreated by another door. Ten
minutes later Mrs Lloyd returned, and found the room occupied by her
little stepdaughter and the nursery-maid. The key was not on the
table. She glanced at the child. Her little niece was perched on a
chair, with the packet in her hands. She had broken the seal with her
own small fingers. Mrs Lloyd hastily took possession of the key.</p>

<p>At the habitual supper-hour Arthur Lloyd came back from his
counting-room. It was the month of June, and supper was served by
daylight. The meal was placed on the table, but Mrs Lloyd failed to
make her appearance. The servant whom his master sent to call her
came back with the assurance that her room was empty, and that the
women informed him that she had not been seen since dinner. They had,
in truth, observed her to have been in tears, and, supposing her to
be shut up in her chamber, had not disturbed her. Her husband called
her name in various parts of the house, but without response. At last
it occurred to him that he might find her by taking the way to the
attic. The thought gave him a strange feeling of discomfort, and he
bade his servants remain behind, wishing no witness in his quest. He
reached the foot of the staircase leading to the topmost flat, and
stood with his hands on the banisters, pronouncing his wife's name.
His voice trembled. He called again louder and more firmly. The only
sound which disturbed the absolute silence was a faint echo of his
own tones, repeating his question under the great eaves.</p>

<p>He nevertheless felt irresistibly moved to ascend the staircase.
It opened upon a wide hall, lined with wooden closets, and
terminating in a window which looked westward, and admitted the last
rays of the sun. Before the window stood the great chest. Before the
chest, on her knees, the young man saw with amazement and horror the
figure of his wife. In an instant he crossed the interval between
them, bereft of utterance. The lid of the chest stood open, exposing,
amid their perfumed napkins, its treasure of stuffs and jewels.
Rosalind had fallen backward from a kneeling posture, with one hand
supporting her on the floor and the other pressed to her heart.</p>

<p>On her limbs was the stiffness of death, and on her face, in the
fading light of the sun, the terror of something more than death. Her
lips were parted in entreaty, in dismay, in agony; and on her
blanched brow and cheeks there glowed the marks of ten hideous wounds
from two vengeful ghostly hands.</p>
