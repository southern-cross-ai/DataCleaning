The Coming Of Hagar</b>
</h2>

<p>JACOB DIX was a pawnbroker, but not a Jew, notwithstanding his
occupation and the Hebraic sound of his baptismal name. He was so
old that no one knew his real age; so grotesque in looks that
children jeered at him in the streets; so avaricious that
throughout the neighborhood he was called "Skinflint."
If he possessed any hidden good qualities to counterbalance his
known bad ones, no person had ever discovered them, or even had
taken the trouble to look for them. Certainly Jacob, surly and
uncommunicative, was not an individual inclined to encourage
uninvited curiosity. In his pawn-shop he lived like an ogre in a
fairy-tale castle, and no one ever came near him save to transact
business, to wrangle during the transaction thereof, and to curse
him at its conclusion. Thus it may be guessed that Jacob drove hard
bargains.</p>

<p>The pawn-shop&mdash;situated in Carby's Crescent,
Lambeth&mdash;furthermore resembled an ogre's castle inasmuch
as, though not filled with dead men's bones, it contained the
relics and wreckage, the flotsam and jetsam, of many lives, of many
households. Placed in the center of the dingy crescent, it faced a
small open space, and the entrance of the narrow lane which led
therefrom to the adjacent thoroughfare. In its
windows&mdash;begrimed with the dust of years&mdash;a heterogeneous
mixture of articles was displayed, ranging from silver teapots to
well-worn saucepans; from gold watches to rusty flatirons; from the
chisel of a carpenter to the ivory framed mirror of a fashionable
beauty. The contents of Dix's window typified in little the
luxury, the meanness, the triviality and the decadence of
latter-day civilization.</p>

<p>There was some irony, too, in the disposition of incongruous
articles; for the useful and useless were placed significantly in
proximity, and the trifles of frivolity were mingled with the
necessaries of life. Here a Dresden china figure, bright-hued and
dainty, simpered everlastingly at a copper warming-pan; there a
silver-handled dagger of the Renaissance lay with a score of those
cheap dinner-knives whose bluntness one execrates in third-rate
restaurants. The bandaged hand of a Pharaohonic mummy touched an
agate saucer holding defaced coins of all ages, of all nations.
Watches, in alternate rows of gold and silver, dangled over
fantastic temples and ships of ivory carved by laborious Chinese
artificers. On a square of rich brocade, woven of silks,
multi-colored as a parrot's plumage, were piled in careless
profusion medals, charms, old-fashioned rings set with dim gems,
and the frail glass bangles of Indian nautch-girls. A small cabinet
of Japanese lacquer, black, with grotesque gilded figures thereon;
talismans of coral from Southern Italy, designed to avert the evil
eye; jeweled pipes of Turkey, set roughly with blue turquoise
stones; Georgian caps with embroideries of tarnished gold; amulets,
earrings, bracelets, snuff-boxes and mosaic brooches from
Florence&mdash;all these frivolities were thrown the one on top of
the other, and all were overlaid with fine gray dust. Wreckage of
many centuries; dry bones of a hundred social systems, dead or
dying! What a commentary on the durability of empire&mdash;on the
inherent pride of pigmy man!</p>

<p>Within doors the shop was small and dark. A narrow counter,
running lengthways, divided the whole into two parts. On the side
nearest the entrance three wooden screens by their disposition
formed four sentry-boxes, into which customers stepped when bent on
business. Jacob, wizen, cunning, and racked by an eternal cough,
hovered up and down the space within the counter, wrangling
incessantly with his customers, and cheating them on every
occasion. He never gave the value of a pawned article: he fought
over every farthing; and even when he obtained the goods at his own
price he grudged payment; for every coin he put down was a drop of
blood wrung from his withered heart. He rarely went outside the
shop; he never mingled with his fellow-creatures; and, the
day's chicanery ended, he retired invariably into a gloomy
back parlor, the principal adornment of which was a gigantic safe
built into the wall. Here he counted his gains, and saw doubtful
customers not receivable in the shop, who came by stealth to
dispose of stolen goods. Here, also, in his lighter moments, he
conversed with the only friend he possessed in Carby's
Crescent&mdash;or, indeed, in London. Jacob was in no danger of
becoming a popular idol.</p>

<p>This particular friend was a solicitor named Vark, who carried
on a shady business, in a shady manner, for shady clients. His
name&mdash;as he declared himself&mdash;proved him to be of Polish
descent; but it was commonly reported in the neighborhood that Vark
was made to rhyme with shark, as emblematic of the estimation in
which he was held. He was hated only one degree less than Jacob,
and the two,&mdash;connected primarily as lawyer and
client,&mdash;later on, had struck up a mistrustful friendship by
reason of their mutual reputation and isolation. Neither one
believed in the other; each tried to swindle on his own account,
and never succeeded; yet the two met nightly and talked over their
divers rascalities in the dingy parlor, with a confidence begotten
by an intimate knowledge of each other's character. The
reputations of both were so bad that the one did not dare to betray
the other. Only on this basis is honor possible among thieves.</p>

<p>Late one foggy November night Jacob was seated with his crony
over a pinched little fire which burnt feebly in a rusty iron
grate. The old pawnbroker was boiling some gruel, and Vark, with
his own private bottle of gin beside him, was drinking a wineglass
of it, mixed sparingly with water. Mr. Dix supplied this latter
beverage, as it cost nothing, but Vark&mdash;on an understanding
which dated from the commencement of their
acquaintance&mdash;always brought his own liquor. A gutterring
candle in a silver candlestick&mdash;a pawned article&mdash;was
placed on the deal table, and gave forth a miserable light. The fog
from without had percolated into the room, so that the pair sat in
a kind of misty atmosphere, hardly illuminated by the farthing dip.
Such discomfort, such squalor, was only possible in a penurious
establishment like that of Jacob.</p>

<p>Vark was a little, lean, wriggling creature, more like a worm
than a man made in the image of his Creator. He had a sharp nose, a
pimply face, and two shifty, fishy eyes, green in hue like those of
a cat. His dress was of rusty black, with a small&mdash;very
small&mdash;display of linen; and he rubbed his hands together with
a cringing bow every time Jacob croaked out a remark between his
coughs. Mr. Dix coughed in a rich but faded dressing-gown, the
relic of some dandy of the Regency; and every paroxysm threatened
to shake his frail form to pieces. But the ancient was wonderfully
tough, and clung to life with a kind of desperate
courage&mdash;though Heaven only knows what attraction the old
villain found in his squalid existence. This tenacity was not
approved of by Vark, who had made Jacob's will, and now
wished his client to die, so that he, as executor, might have the
fingering of the wealth which Dix was reported to possess. The heir
to these moneys was missing, and Vark was determined that he should
never be found. Meanwhile, with many schemes in his head, he
cringed to Jacob, and watched him cough over his gruel.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, dear!" sighed Mr. Vark, speaking of his
client in the third person, as he invariably did, "how bad
Mr. Dix's cough is to-night! Why doesn't he try a taste
of gin to moisten his throat?"</p>

<p>"Can't afford it!" croaked Jacob, pouring the
gruel into a bowl. "Gin's worth money, and money I
ain't got. Make me a little present of a glass, Mr. Vark,
just to show that you're glad of my company."</p>

<p>Vark complied very unwillingly with this request, and poured as
little as he well could into the proffered bowl. "What an
engaging man he is!" said the lawyer,
smirking&mdash;"so convivial, so full of spirits!"</p>

<p>"Your spirits!" retorted Jacob, drinking his
gruel.</p>

<p>"What wit!" cried Vark, slapping his thin knees.
"It's better than <i>Punch!"</i></p>

<p>"Gin-punch! gruel-punch!" said Dix, encouraged by
this praise.</p>

<p>"He, he! I shall die with laughing! I've paid for
worse than that at the theater!"</p>

<p>"More fool you!" growled Jacob, taking up the tongs.
"You shouldn't pay for anything. Here, get out!
I'm going to put out the fire. I ain't going to burn
this expensive coal to warm you. And the candle's half-burnt
too!" concluded Jacob, resentfully.</p>

<p>"I'm going&mdash;I'm going," said Vark,
slipping his bottle into his pocket. "But to leave this
pleasant company&mdash;what a wrench!"</p>

<p>"Here, stop that stuff, you inkpot! Has my son answered
that advertisement yet?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Dix's son hasn't sent a line to his
sorrowing parent," returned the lawyer. "Oh, what a
hard-hearted offspring!"</p>

<p>"You're right there, man," muttered Jacob,
gloomily. "Jimmy's left me to die all alone, curse
him!"</p>

<p>"Then why leave him your money?" said Vark, changing
into the first person, as he always did when business was being
discussed.</p>

<p>"Why, you fool?&mdash;'cause he's
Hagar's son&mdash;the bad son of a good mother."</p>

<p>"Hagar Stanley&mdash;your wife&mdash;your gipsy wife! Hey,
Mr. Dix?"</p>

<p>Jacob nodded. "A pure-blooded Romany. I met her when I was
a Crocus."</p>

<p>"Crocus for Cheap Jack!" whined Vark; "the wit
this man has!"</p>

<p>"She came along o' me to London when I set up
here," continued Jacob, without heeding the interruption,
"and town killed her; she couldn't breathe in bricks
and mortar after the free air of the road. Dead&mdash;poor
soul!&mdash;dead; and she left me Jimmy&mdash;Jimmy, who's
left me."</p>

<p>"What a play of fancy&mdash;" began Vark; when,
seeing from the fierce look of Jacob that compliments on the score
of the dead wife were not likely to be well received, he changed
his tone. "He'll spend your money, Mr. Dix."</p>

<p>"Let him! Hagar's dead, and when I die&mdash;let
him."</p>

<p>"But, my generous friend, if you gave me more power as
executor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd take my money to yourself," interrupted
Dix with irony. "Not if I know it, you shark! Your duty is to
administer the estate by law for Jimmy. I pay you!"</p>

<p>"But so little!" whined Vark, rising; "if
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment there came a sharp knock at the door of the shop,
and the two villains, always expectant of the police, stared at one
another, motionless with terror for the moment. Vark, who always
took care of his skin, snatched up his hat and made for the
back-door, whence, in the fog, he could gain his own house
unquestioned and unseen. Like a ghost he vanished, leaving Jacob
motionless until aroused by a repetition of the knock.</p>

<p>"Can't be peelers," he muttered, taking a
pistol out of a cupboard, "but it might be thieves. Well, if
it is&mdash;" He smiled grimly, and without finishing his
sentence he shuffled along to the door, candle in hand. A third
knock came, as the clock in the shop struck eleven.</p>

<p>"Who is there, so late?" demanded Jacob,
sharply.</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;Hagar Stanley!"</p>

<p>With a cry of terror, Mr. Dix let the candle fall, and in the
darkness dropped also. For the moment,&mdash;so much had his
thoughts been running on the dead wife,&mdash;the unexpected
mention of her name made him believe that she was standing rigid in
her winding-sheet on the other side of the door. One frail
partition between the living and the dead! It was terrible!</p>

<p>"The ghost of Hagar!" muttered Dix, white and
shaking. "Why has she come out of her grave?&mdash;and so
expensive it was; bricked; with a marble tombstone."</p>

<p>"Let me in! let me in, Mr. Dix!" cried the visitor,
again rapping.</p>

<p>"She never called me by that name," said Jacob,
reassured, and scrambling for the candle; then, having lighted it,
he added aloud: "I don't know any one called Hagar
Stanley."</p>

<p>"Open the door, and you will. I'm your wife's
niece."</p>

<p>"Flesh and blood!" said the old man, fumbling at the
lock&mdash;"I don't mind that."</p>

<p>He flung wide the door, and out of the fog and darkness a young
girl of twenty years stepped into the shop. She was dressed in a
dark red garment made of some coarse stuff, and over this she wore
a short black cloak. Her hands were bare, and also her head, save
for a scarlet handkerchief, which was carelessly twisted round her
magnificent black hair. The face was of the true Romany type
Oriental in its contour and hue, with arched eyebrows over large
dark eyes, and a thin-lipped mouth beautifully shaped, under a
delicately-curved nose. Face and figure were those of a woman who
needed palms and desert sands and golden sunshine, hot and sultry,
for an appropriate background; yet this Eastern beauty appeared out
of the fog like some dead Syrian princess, and presented herself in
all her rich loveliness to the astonished eyes of the old
pawnbroker.</p>

<p>"So you are the niece of my dead Hagar?" he said,
staring earnestly at her in the thin yellow light of the candle.
"Yes, it's true. She looked like you when I met her in
the New Forest. What d'ye want?"</p>

<p>"Food and shelter," replied the girl, curtly.
"But you'd better shut the door; it might be bad for
your reputation if any passer-by saw you speaking to a woman at
this time of night."</p>

<p>"My reputation!" chuckled Jacob, closing end bolting
the door. "Lord! that's past spoiling. If you knew how
bad it is, you wouldn't come here."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can look after myself, Mr. Dix, especially as
you're old enough to be my great-grandfather twice
over."</p>

<p>"Come, come! Civil words, young woman!"</p>

<p>"I'm civil to those who are civil to me,"
retorted Hagar, taking the candle out of her host's hands.
"Go on, Mr. Dix, show me in; I'm tired, and want to
sleep. I'm hungry, and wish food. You must give me bed and
board."</p>

<p>"Infernal insolence, young woman! Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm kin to your dead Hagar."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, there's something in that,"
muttered Dix, and dominated, in spite of his inherent obstinacy, by
the imperious spirit of the girl, he led her into the dingy parlor.
Here she removed her cloak and sat down, while Jacob, in an unusual
spirit of hospitality, induced by the mention of his late wife,
produced some coarse victuals.</p>

<p>Without a word he placed the food before his guest; without a
word she ate, and was refreshed. Jacob marveled at the
self-possession of the gipsy, and was rather pleased than otherwise
with her bold coolness. Only when she had finished the last scrap
of bread and cheese did he speak. His first remark was curt and
rude&mdash;designedly so.</p>

<p>"You can't stay here!" said the amiable old
man</p>

<p>The girl retorted in kind: "I can, and I shall, Mr.
Dix."</p>

<p>"For what reason, you jade?"</p>

<p>"For several&mdash;and all good ones," said Hagar
leaning her chin on her hands and looking steadily at his wrinkled
face. "I know all about you from a Romany chal who was up
here six months ago. Your wife is dead; your son has left you; and
here you live alone, disliked and hated by all. You are old and
feeble and solitary; but you are by marriage akin to the gentle
Romany. For that reason, and because I am of your dead rani's
blood, I have come to look after you."</p>

<p>"Jezebel! That is, if I'll let you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll let me fast enough," replied the
woman, carelessly. "You are a miser, I have heard; so you
won't lose the chance of getting a servant for
nothing."</p>

<p>"A servant! You?" said Dix, admiring her imperial
air.</p>

<p>"Even so, Mr. Dix. I'll look after you and your
house. I'll scrub and cook and mend. If you'll teach me
your trade, I'll drive a bargain with any one&mdash;and as
hard and fast a one as you could drive yourself. And all these
things I'll do for nothing."</p>

<p>"There's food and lodging, you hussy."</p>

<p>"Give me dry bread and cold water, your roof to cover me,
and a bundle of straw to sleep on. These won't cost you much,
and I ask for nothing more&mdash;Skinflint."</p>

<p>"How dare you call me that, you wild cat!"</p>

<p>"It's what they call you hereabouts," said
Hagar with a shrug. "I think it suits you. Well, Mr. Dix, I
have made my offer."</p>

<p>"I haven't accepted it yet," snapped Jacob,
puzzled by the girl. "Why do you come to me? Why don't
you stay with your tribe?"</p>

<p>"I can explain that in five minutes, Mr. Dix. We Stanleys
are just now in the New Forest. You know it?"</p>

<p>"Truly lass," said Dix, sadly. "'Twas
there I met my Hagar."</p>

<p>"And it is from there that I, the second Hagar,
come," replied the girl. "I was with my tribe and I was
happy till Goliath came."</p>

<p>"Goliath?" inquired Jacob, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"He is half a Gorgio and half Romany&mdash;a red-haired
villain, who chose to fall in love with me. I hated him. I hate him
still!"&mdash;the woman's bosom rose and fell in short,
hurried pantings&mdash;"and he would have forced me to be his
wife. Pharaoh&mdash;our king, you know&mdash;would have forced me
also to be this man's rani, so I had no one to protect me,
and I was miserable. Then I recalled what the chal had told me
about you who wed with one of us; so I fled hither for your
protection, and to be your servant."</p>

<p>"But Goliath&mdash;this red-haired brute?"</p>

<p>"He does not know where I have gone, he will never find me
here. Let me stay, Mr. Dix, and be your servant. I have nowhere to
go to, no one to seek, save you, the husband of the dead Hagar,
after whom I am named. Am I to stay or go, now that I have told you
the truth?"</p>

<p>Jacob looked thoughtfully at the girl, and saw tears glistening
in her heavy eyelashes, although her pride kept them from falling.
Moved by her helplessness, mindful of the wife whom he had loved so
well, and alive to the advantage of possessing a white slave whom
he could trust the astute ancient made up his mind.</p>

<p>"Stay," said he, quietly. "I shall see if you
will be useful to me&mdash;useful and faithful, my girl so, bread
and bed shall be yours."</p>

<p>"It's a bargain," said Hagar, with a sigh of
relief. "And now, old man, let me rest in peace, am weary,
and have walked many a long mile."</p>

<p>So in this fashion came Hagar to the pawnshop; and it was for
this reason that Vark, to his great astonishment, found a
woman&mdash;and what is more, a young and beautiful
woman&mdash;established in the house of Jacob Dix. The news
affected the neighborhood like a miracle, and new tales were
repeated about Dix and his housekeeper, who, report said, was no
better than she should be. But Hagar did not mind evil tongues; nor
did the old man. Without a spark of love or affection between them,
they worked together on a basis of mutual interest; and all the
days that Jacob lived Hagar served him faithfully. Whereat Vark
wondered.</p>

<p>It was not an easy life for the girl. Jacob was a hard master,
and made her pay dearly for bed and board. Hagar scrubbed walls and
floors; she mended such pawned dresses as required attention; and
cooked the frugal meals of herself and master. The old pawnbroker
taught her how to depreciate articles brought to be pawned, how to
haggle with their owners, and how to wring the last sixpence out of
miserable wretches who came to redeem their pledges. In a short
time Hagar became as clever as Jacob himself, and he was never
afraid to trust her with the task of making bargains, or with the
care of the shop. She acquired a knowledge of pictures, gems,
silverware, china&mdash;in fact, all the information about such
things necessary to an expert. Without knowing it, the untaught
gipsy girl became a connoisseur.</p>

<p>It required all Hagar's patience to bear cheerfully the
lot which she had chosen voluntarily. Her bed was hard, her food
meager; and the old man's sharp tongue was perpetually
goading her by its bitterness. Jacob, indeed,&mdash;sure of his
slave, since she had no other roof save his to cover
her,&mdash;exercised all the petty arts of a tyrant. He vented on
her all the rage he felt against the son who had deserted him. Once
he went so far as to attempt a blow; but a single glance from the
fierce eyes of Hagar made him change his intention; and, cowed for
once in his tyranny, Jacob never lifted his hand again against her.
He saw plainly enough that if he once raised the devil in this
child of the free gipsy race, there would be no laying it again.
But, actual violence apart, Hagar's life was as miserable as
a human being's well could be.</p>

<p>Stifled in the narrow shop in the crowded neighborhood, she
longed at times for the free life of the road. Her thoughts
recalled the green woods, so cool and shady in summer; they dwelt
on the brown heath lonely in the starlight, with the red flare of
the gipsy fire casting fantastic shadows on caravan and tent. In
the darkness of night she would murmur the strange words of the
"calo jib," like some incantation to compel memory. To
herself, while arranging the curiosities in the shop window, she
would sing fragments of Romany songs set in minor keys. The
nostalgia of the wilds, of the encampment and the open road,
tortured her in the heats of summer; and when winter descended she
longed for the chill breath of country winds sweeping across moors
laden with snow, over pools rigid in the cold embrace of smooth and
glassy ice. In the pawn-shop she was an exile from her dream
paradise of roaming liberty.</p>

<p>To make bad worse, Vark fell in love with her. For the first
time in his narrow, selfish life, a divine passion touched the
gross soul of the thieves' lawyer. Ravished by the dark
loveliness of the girl, dominated by her untamed spirit, astonished
by her clear mind and unerring judgment, Vark wished to possess
this treasure. There was also another reason for the offer of
marriage which he made, and this reason he put into words when he
asked Hagar to become his wife. It took Vark twelve months to make
up his mind to this course; and his wrath may be guessed when Hagar
refused him promptly. The miserable wretch could not believe that
she was in earnest.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, sweet Hagar!" he whined, trying to clasp
her hand, "you cannot have heard what your slave
said!"</p>

<p>Hagar, who was mending some lace and minding the shop in the
absence of Jacob, looked up with a scornful smile. "What you
call yourself in jest," said she quietly, "I am in
reality; I sold myself into bondage for bare existence a year ago.
Do you want to marry a slave, Mr. Vark?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! Then you will no longer need to work like a
servant."</p>

<p>"I would rather be a servant than your wife, Mr.
Vark."</p>

<p>"The girl's mad! Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you are a scoundrel."</p>

<p>Vark grinned amiably, in no wise disturbed by this
plain-speaking. "My Cleopatra, we are all scoundrels in these
parts. Jacob Dix is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is my master!" interrupted Hagar, sharply.
"So leave him alone. But this offer of yours, my friend. What
benefit do you propose to gain if I accept it? You're not
asking me to be your wife without some motive."</p>

<p>"Why, that's true enough, my beauty!" chuckled
Vark. "Lord, how cunning you are to guess! The motive is
double: one part love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll say nothing about that, man! You don't
know what love is! The other motive?"</p>

<p>"Money!" said Vark, curtly, and without wasting
words.</p>

<p>"H'm!" replied Hagar, with irony. "Mr.
Dix's money?"</p>

<p>"What penetration!" said the lawyer, slapping his
knee. "My word, here's intelligence!"</p>

<p>"We'll pass over the usual compliments, Mr. Vark.
Well, how is Mr. Dix's money to benefit you through
me?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Vark, blinking his green eyes,
"the old man's got a fancy for you, my dear; and all
the liking he had for me he's given to you. Before you came,
he made a will in favor of his lost son, and appointed me executor.
Now that he sees what a sharp one you are, he has made a new
will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leaving all the money to me, I suppose? That's a
lie!"</p>

<p>"It is a lie," retorted Vark, "but one I
wasn't going to tell you. No; the money is still left to the
son; but you are the executor under the new will. Now d'ye
see?"</p>

<p>"No," said Hagar, folding up her work, "I
don't."</p>

<p>"Well, if I marry you, I'll administer the estate in
your name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the benefit of the lost heir? Well?"</p>

<p>"That's just it," said Vark, laying a lean
finger on her knee&mdash;"the lost heir. Don't you
understand? We needn't look for him, so we can keep the
moneys in our own hands, and have some fine pickings out of the
estate."</p>

<p>Hagar rose, and smiled darkly. "A nice little scheme, and
worthy of you," said she, contemptuously; "but there
are two obstacles. I'm not your wife, and I am an honest
girl. Try some of your lady clients, Mr. Vark. I'm not for
sale!"</p>

<p>When she walked away Vark scowled. A scoundrel himself, he could
not understand this honesty which stood in the way of its own
advancement. Biting his fingers, he stared after Hagar, and
wondered how he could catch her in his net.</p>

<p>"If that old miser would only leave her his
heiress!" he thought; "she'd have no scruples
about taking the money then; and if she had the money, I'd
force her to be my wife. But Jacob is set on giving all his wealth
to that infernal son of his, who so often wished his father to die.
Aha!" sighed Vark, rubbing his hands, "I wish I could
prove that he tried to kill the old man. Jacob wouldn't leave
him a penny then, and Hagar should have the money, and I would have
her. What a lovely dream! Why can't it come true?"</p>

<p>It was such a lovely dream, and offered such opportunities for
scoundrelly dealings, that Vark set to work at once to translate it
into actual facts. He had many of the letters and bills of the
absent Jimmy, who had been accustomed to come to him for the money
refused by the paternal Dix. Counting on the old man's death,
Vark had lent the son money for his profligacy at a heavy
percentage, and intended to repay himself out of the estate. Now
that Hagar was to handle the money instead of himself, he thought
that there might be some difficulty over his usury, owing to the
girl's absurd honesty. He therefore determined to give proofs
to Jacob that the absent son had designed to rid himself of a
troublesome father by secret murder. Once Dix got such an idea into
his head, he might leave his wealth to Hagar. The heiress would
then be wooed and won by skilful, scheming Mr. Vark. It was a
beautiful idea, and quite simple.</p>

<p>Among his many shady clients Vark possessed one who was a clever
forger, and who occasionally retired to one of Her Majesty's
prisons for too frequently exercising his talents in that
direction. At the present moment he was at large. Vark gave him a
bundle of Jimmy's letters, and the draft of a memorandum
which he wished to be imitated in the handwriting of the absent
heir. When this was ready, Vark watched his opportunity and slipped
it into a Chinese jar in the back parlor, in which he knew Jimmy
had been accustomed to keep tobacco. This receptacle stood on a
high shelf, and had not been touched by Jacob since his son's
departure. Vark, like the clever scoundrel he was, ascertained this
fact by the thick and undisturbed dust which coated jar and shelf.
The trap being thus prepared, it only remained to lead Jacob into
it; and this Mr. Vark arranged to do in the most skilful manner. He
quite counted on success, but one necessary element thereto he
overlooked, and that was the aid of Hagar. But as he had designed
the whole scheme primarily for her benefit, he never thought she
would refuse to forward its aim. Which blindness showed that he was
incapable of appreciating or even understanding the honesty of the
girl's character.</p>

<p>According to his custom, he came one evening to converse with
Jacob. The room with its solitary candle, the starved fire, and the
foggy atmosphere, were the same as on the night when Hagar had
arrived, save that now Hagar herself sat sewing by the table. She
frowned when Vark came cringing into the room, but beyond greeting
him with a slight nod she took no notice of the smiling scoundrel.
Vark produced his bottle of gin, and set down near the fire,
opposite to Jacob, who on this night looked very old and feeble.
The old man was breaking up fast, and was more querulous and
crabbed than ever. As usual, he asked Vark if Jimmy had answered
the advertisement, and as usual he received a negative reply. Jacob
groaned.</p>

<p>"I'll die this winter," said he, with moody
face, "and no one will be by to close my eyes."</p>

<p>"What is this I hear Mr. Dix say!" cried Vark,
smilingly. "He forgets our beautiful Hagar."</p>

<p>"Hagar is all very well, but she is not Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, if our dear friend knew all, he would be pleased
that she isn't."</p>

<p>Hagar looked up in surprise at the significant tones of Vark,
and Jacob scowled. "What d'ye mean, you shark?"
he demanded, a light coming into his faded eyes.</p>

<p>"Why," replied the lawyer, luring on the old
pawnbroker, "Jimmy was a scoundrel."</p>

<p>"I know that, man!" snapped Jacob.</p>

<p>"He wanted your money."</p>

<p>"I know that also."</p>

<p>"He wished for your death."</p>

<p>"It's probable he did," retorted Jacob,
nodding; "but he was content to let me take my own time to
die."</p>

<p>"H'm! I'm not so sure of that!"</p>

<p>Guessing that Vark had some scheme in his head which he was
striving to bring to fulfilment, Hagar dropped her sewing, and
looked sharply at him. As Vark spoke she saw him glance at the
Chinese jar, and mentally wondered what possible connection that
could have with the subject of conversation. On this point she was
soon enlightened.</p>

<p>"Vark," said Dix, seriously, "are you going to
tell me that Jimmy wished to kill me?"</p>

<p>The lawyer held up his hands in horror. "Oh, dear, that I
should be so misunderstood!" he said in a piteous tone.
"Jimmy was not so bad as that, my venerable friend. But if
some one else had put you out of the way, he would not have been
sorry."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Hagar?"</p>

<p>"Let him dare to say so!" cried the girl, leaping to
her feet with flaming eyes. "I do not know your son, Mr.
Dix."</p>

<p>"What!" said Vark, softly; "not red-haired
Jimmy!"</p>

<p>Hagar sat down with a pale face. "Red-haired!" she
muttered. "Goliath! No, it is impossible!"</p>

<p>Vark looked at Hagar, and she stared back at him again. With the
approaching senility of old age, Jacob had ceased to take part in
the conversation, and was moodily staring at the miserable fire, a
trembling and palsied creature. The idea hinted at by
Vark&mdash;that Hagar had been employed by Jimmy to destroy
him&mdash;so stupefied his brain that he was incapable of even
expressing an opinion. Seeing this, the lawyer glided away from the
dangerous topic, to carry out the second part of his scheme.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, dear!" he said, hunting in his pockets.
"My pipe is empty, and I have no tobacco with me."</p>

<p>"Then go without it, Mr. Vark!" said Hagar, sharply.
"There's no tobacco here."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I think in that jar," said the lawyer,
pointing one lean finger at the high
shelf&mdash;"Jimmy's jar."</p>

<p>"Leave Jimmy's jar alone!" mumbled Jacob,
savagely.</p>

<p>"What! will not Mr. Dix spare one tiny pipe of tobacco for
his old friend?" whined Vark, going towards the shelf.
"Oh, I think so; I am certain," and with this one of
his long arms shot upwards to seize the jar. Jacob rose unsteadily
as Vark took down the article, and he scowled fiercely at the
daring of his visitor. Indifferent to what was going on, Hagar
continued her sewing.</p>

<p>"Leave that jar of Jimmy's alone, I tell you!"
snarled Dix, seizing the poker. "I'll break your
fox's head if you don't!"</p>

<p>"Violence&mdash;and from gentle Mr. Dix!" cried
Vark, still gripping the jar. "Oh, no, no, not at all! If
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment Jacob lost patience, and delivered a swinging
blow at the lawyer's head.</p>

<p>Ever watchful, Vark threw himself to one side, and the poker
crashed down on the jar, which he held in his hands. In a moment it
lay in fragments on the floor. A pile of broken china, a loose bit
of dried tobacco, and a carelessly folded paper.</p>

<p>"See what your angry passion has done!" said Vark,
pointing reproachfully to the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. "You have
broken poor Jimmy's jar!"</p>

<p>Jacob threw the poker inside the fender, and bent to pick up the
folded paper, which he opened in a mechanical manner. Always
methodical, Hagar went out of the room to fetch a dust-pan and
broom. Before she could return with them she was recalled by a cry
from Vark; and on rushing back she saw Jacob prone on the floor
among the broken china. He had fainted, and the paper was still
clutched in his hand.</p>

<p>"Bring water&mdash;salts!" cried Vark, his eyes
filled with a triumphant light at the success of his plot.
"My venerable friend is ill!"</p>

<p>"What have you been doing to him?" demanded Hagar,
as she loosened the scarf round the old man's neck.</p>

<p>"I? Nothing! He read that paper which fell out of the
jar&mdash;Jimmy's jar," added Vark,
pointedly&mdash;"and went down like a ninepin!"</p>

<p>There was a jug of water on the table, used by Vark for diluting
his gin, so Hagar sprinkled the wrinkled face of her master with
this fluid, and slapped his hands. Vark looked on rather anxiously.
He did not wish the old man to die yet; and Jacob was a long time
coming out of his swoon.</p>

<p>"This paper made him faint," said Vark, removing it
from Jacob's feeble grasp. "Let us see what it
says." He knew the contents quite well, but nevertheless he
read it aloud in a distinct voice for the benefit of Hagar. Thus
ran the words: "Memo.: To extract the juice of
foxglove&mdash;a poison difficult to trace&mdash;nothing can be
proved after death. Small doses daily in old man's tea or
gruel. He would die in a few weeks without suspicion. Will trust
nobody, but will prepare drug myself."</p>

<p>Hagar looked steadily at Vark. "Who wrote that," she
said in a low voice&mdash;"the old man's son
or&mdash;you?"</p>

<p>"I?" cried Vark, with well-simulated indignation,
"why should I write it?&mdash;or how could I write it? The
penmanship is that of James Dix; it was concealed in his
tobacco-jar; the jar was broken by accident; you saw it yourself.
Do you dare to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be silent!" interrupted Hagar, raising
Jacob's head; "he is reviving."</p>

<p>The old pawnbroker opened his eyes and looked wildly around.
Little by little his senses returned to him, and he sat up. Then,
with the aid of Hagar, he climbed into his chair, and began to talk
and sigh.</p>

<p>"Little Jimmy wants me to die," he moaned, feebly.
"Hagar's son wants to kill me. Foxglove poison&mdash;I
know it! Not a trace does it leave after death. Hagar's son!
Hagar's boy! Parricide! Parricide!" he cried, shaking
his two fists in the air.</p>

<p>"He wanted the money, you know," hinted Vark,
softly.</p>

<p>"He shall not have the money!" said Jacob with
unnatural energy. "I'll make a new
will&mdash;I'll disinherit him! Parricide! Hagar shall have
all!"</p>

<p>"I, Mr. Dix? No, no!"</p>

<p>"I say yes, you jade! Don't cross a dying man. I am
dying; this is my death-blow. O Jimmy, Jimmy! Wolf's cub! My
will! my will!"</p>

<p>Pushing back Hagar, who strove to keep him in his chair, he
snatched up the candle and staggered towards the safe to get his
will. While he was looking within, Vark hastily fumbled in his
capacious pockets. When Jacob replaced the candle on the table,
Hagar saw thereon a sheet of paper covered with writing; also pen
and ink. Jacob, clutching the will, beheld these things also, and
anticipated the question on Hagar's lips.</p>

<p>"What's all this?"</p>

<p>"Your new will, Mr. Dix," explained Vark, smoothly.
"I never did trust your son, and I knew some day that you
would find him out. I therefore prepared a will by which you left
everything to Hagar. Or," added the lawyer, taking another
document from his pocket, "if you chose to make me your
heir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You? You? Never!" shrieked Jacob, shaking his fist.
"All shall go to Hagar, the namesake of my dead wife.
I'm glad you had the sense to see, that failing Jimmy,
I'd leave her my money."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dix," interrupted Hagar, firmly, "I do
not want your money; and you have no right to rob your son
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No right! No right, you jade! The money is mine! mine! It
shall be yours. I could have forgiven anything to Jimmy save his
wish to poison me."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he did wish it," said Hagar,
bluntly.</p>

<p>"But the paper&mdash;his own handwriting!" cried
Vark.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I know Jimmy's handwriting," said
Jacob, the veins in his forehead swelling with rage. "He is a
devil&mdash;a par&mdash;par&mdash;!" The violence of his
temper was such that Hagar stepped forward to soothe him. Even Vark
felt alarmed.</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, you old fool!" said he, roughly;
"you'll break a blood-vessel! Here, sign this will.
I'll witness it; and&mdash;" He stopped, and whistled
shrilly. A man appeared. "Here is another witness,"
said Vark. "Sign!"</p>

<p>"It's a plot! a plot!" cried Hagar.
"Don't sign, Mr. Dix. I don't want the
money."</p>

<p>"I'll make you take it, hussy!" snarled Jacob,
crushing the will up in his hand. "I shall leave it to
you&mdash;not to Jimmy, the parricide. First I'll destroy
this." With the old will he approached the fire, and threw it
in. With the swiftness of a swallow Hagar darted past him and
snatched the document away from the flames before it was even
scorched. Jacob staggered back, mad with rage. Vark ground his
teeth at her opposition. The stranger witness looked stolidly
on.</p>

<p>"No!" cried Hagar, slipping the will into her
pocket. "You shall not disinherit your son for me!"</p>

<p>"Give&mdash;give&mdash;will!" panted Jacob, and,
almost inarticulate with rage, he stretched out his hand. Before he
could draw it back he reeled and fell; a torrent of blood poured
from his mouth. He was dead.</p>

<p>"You fool!" shrieked Vark, stamping.
"You've lost a fortune!"</p>

<p>"I've saved my honesty!" retorted Hagar,
aghast at the sudden death. "Jimmy shall have the
money."</p>

<p>"Jimmy! Jimmy!" sneered Vark, wrathfully. "Do
you know who Jimmy is?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the rightful heir!"</p>

<p>"Quite so, you jade&mdash;and the red-haired Goliath who
drove you to this pawn-shop!"</p>

<p>"It is a lie!"</p>

<p>"It is the truth! You have robbed yourself to enrich your
enemy!"</p>

<p>Hagar looked at the sneering face of Vark; at the dead man lying
at her feet; at the frightened countenance of the witness. She felt
inclined to faint, but, afraid lest Vark should steal the will
which she had in her pocket, she controlled herself with a violent
effort. Before Vark could stop her, she rushed out of the room, and
into her bedroom. The lawyer heard the key turn in the lock.</p>

<p>"I've lost the game," he said, moodily.
"Go and get assistance, you fool!" this to the witness;
then, when the man had fled away, he continued: "To give up
all that money to the red-haired man whom she hated! The
girl's mad!"</p>

<p>But she was only honest; therefore her conduct was
unintelligible to Vark. So this was how Hagar Stanley came to take
charge of the pawn-shop in Carby's Crescent, Lambeth. Her
adventures therein may be read hereafter.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="II" id="II"></a>Chapter II<br>
The First Customer And The Florentine Dante</b>
</h2>

<p>IT has been explained otherwhere how Hagar Stanley, against her
own interests, took charge of the pawn-shop and property of Jacob
Dix during the absence of the rightful heir. She had full control
of everything by the terms of the will. Jacob had made many good
bargains in his life, but none better than that which had brought
him Hagar for a slave&mdash;Hagar, with her strict sense of duty,
her upright nature, and her determination to act honestly, even
when her own interests were at stake. Such a character was almost
unknown amongst the denizens of Carby's Crescent.</p>

<p>Vark, the lawyer, thought her a fool. Firstly, because she
refused to make a nest-egg for herself out of the estate; secondly,
because she had surrendered a fine fortune to benefit a man she
hated; thirdly, because she declined to become Mrs. Vark. Otherwise
she was sharp enough&mdash;too sharp, the lawyer thought; for with
her keen business instinct, and her faculty for organizing and
administering and understanding, he found it impossible to trick
her in any way. Out of the Dix estate Vark received his due fees
and no more, which position was humiliating to a man of his
intelligence.</p>

<p>Hagar, however, minded neither Vark nor any one else. She
advertised for the absent heir, she administered the estate, and
carried on the business of the pawn-shop; living in the back-parlor
meanwhile, after the penurious fashion of her late master. It had
been a shock to her to learn that the heir of the old pawnbroker
was none other than Goliath, the red-haired suitor who had forced
her to leave the gipsy camp. Still, her honesty would not permit
her to rob him of his heritage; and she attended to his interests
as though they were those of the man she loved best in the world.
When Jimmy Dix, alias Goliath, appeared to claim the property,
Hagar intended to deliver up all to him, and to leave the shop as
poor as when she entered it. In the mean time, as the months went
by and brought not the claimant, Hagar minded the shop, transacted
business, and drove bargains. Also, she became the heroine of
several adventures, such as the following:</p>

<p>During a June twilight she was summoned to the shop by a sharp
rapping, and on entering she found a young man waiting to pawn a
book which he held in his hand. He was tall, slim fair-haired and
blue-eyed, with a clever and intellectual face, lighted by rasher
dreamy eyes. Quick at reading physiognomies, Hagar liked his
appearance at the first glance, and, moreover, admired his good
looks.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wish to get some money on this book,"
said the stranger in a hesitating manner, a flush invading his fair
complexion; "could you&mdash;that is, will you&mdash;"
He paused in confusion, and held out the book, which Hagar took in
silence.</p>

<p>It was an old and costly book, over which a bibliomaniac would
have gloated.</p>

<p>The date was that of the fourteenth century the printer a famous
Florentine publisher of that epoch; and the author was none other
than one Dante Alighieri, a poet not unknown to fame. In short, the
volume was a second edition of "La Divina Commedia,"
extremely rare, and worth much money. Hagar, who had learnt many
things under the able tuition of Jacob, at once recognized the
value of the book; but with keen business
instinct&mdash;notwithstanding her prepossession concerning the
young man&mdash;she began promptly to disparage it.</p>

<p>"I don't care for old books," she said,
offering it back to him. "Why not take it to a secondhand
bookseller?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't want to part with it. At the
present moment I need money, as you can see from my appearance. Let
me have five pounds on the book until I can redeem it."</p>

<p>Hagar, who already had noted the haggard looks of this customer,
and the threadbare quality of his apparel, laid down the Dante with
a bang. "I can't give five pounds," she said
bluntly. "The book isn't worth it!"</p>

<p>"Shows how much you know of such things, my girl! It is a
rare edition of a celebrated Italian poet, and it is worth over a
hundred pounds."</p>

<p>"Really?" said Hagar, dryly. "In that case,
why not sell?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't want to. Give me five
pounds."</p>

<p>"No; four is all that I can advance."</p>

<p>"Four ten," pleaded the customer.</p>

<p>"Four," retorted the inexorable Hagar. "Or
else&mdash;"</p>

<p>She pushed the book towards him with one finger. Seeing that he
could get nothing more out of her, the young man sighed and
relented. "Give me the four pounds," he said, gloomily.
"I might have guessed that a Jewess would grind me down to
the lowest."</p>

<p>"I am not a Jew, but a gipsy," replied Hagar, making
out the ticket.</p>

<p>"A gipsy!" said the other, peering into her face.
"And what is a Romany lass doing in this Levitical
tabernacle?"</p>

<p>"That's my business!" retorted Hagar, curtly.
"Name and address?"</p>

<p>"Eustace Lorn, 4: Castle Road," said the young man,
giving an address near at hand. "But I say&mdash;if you are
true Romany, you can talk the calo jib."</p>

<p>"I talk it with my kind, young man; not with the
Gentiles."</p>

<p>"But I am a Romany Rye."</p>

<p>"I'm not a fool, young man! Romany Ryes don't
live in cities for choice."</p>

<p>"Nor do gipsy girls dwell in pawn-shops, my
lass!"</p>

<p>"Four pounds," said Hagar, taking no notice of this
remark; "there it is, in gold; your ticket also&mdash;number
eight hundred and twenty. You can redeem the book whenever you
like, on paying six per cent. interest. Good night."</p>

<p>"But I say'" cried Lorn, as he slipped money
and ticket into his pocket, "I want to speak to you,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good night, sir," said Hagar, sharply, and vanished
into the darkness of the shop. Lorn was annoyed by her curt manner
and his sudden dismissal; but as there was no help for it, he
walked out into the street.</p>

<p>"What a handsome girl!" was his first thought; and
"What a spitfire!" was his second.</p>

<p>After his departure, Hagar put away the Dante, and, as it was
late, shut up the shop. Then she retired to the back-parlor to eat
her supper&mdash;dry bread-and-cheese with cold water&mdash;and to
think over the young man. As a rule, Hagar was far too
self-possessed to be impressionable; but there was something about
Eustace Lorn&mdash;she had the name pat&mdash;which attracted her
not a little. From the short interview she had not learnt much of
his personality. He was poor, proud, rather absent-minded;
and&mdash;from the fact of his yielding to her on the question of
price&mdash;rather weak in character. Yet she liked his face, the
kindly expression of his eyes, and the sweetness of his mouth. But
after all he was only a chance customer; and&mdash;unless he
returned to redeem the Dante&mdash;she might not see him again. On
this thought occurring to her, Hagar called common-sense to her
aid, and strove to banish the young man's image from her
mind. The task was more difficult than she thought.</p>

<p>A week later, Lorn and his pawning of the book were recalled to
her mind by a stranger who entered the shop shortly after midday.
This man was short, stout, elderly and vulgar. He was much excited,
and spoke badly, as Hagar noted when he laid a pawn-ticket number
eight hundred and twenty on the counter.</p>

<p>"'Ere, girl," said he in rough tones,
"gimme the book this ticket's for."</p>

<p>"You come from Mr. Lorn?" asked Hagar, remembering
the Dante.</p>

<p>"Yes; he wants that book. There's the brass. Sharp,
now, young woman!"</p>

<p>Hagar made no move to get the volume, or even to take the money.
Instead of doing either, she asked a question. "Is Mr. Lorn
ill, that he could not come himself?" she demanded, looking
keenly at the man's coarse face.</p>

<p>"No; but I've bought the pawn-ticket off him.
'Ere, gimme the book!"</p>

<p>"I cannot at present," replied Hagar, who did not
trust the looks of this man, and who wished, moreover, to see
Eustace again.</p>

<p>"Dash yer imperance! Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because you did not pawn the Dante; and as it is a
valuable book, I might get into trouble if I gave it into other
hands than Mr. Lorn's."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blest! There's the
ticket!"</p>

<p>"So I see; but how do I know the way you became possessed
of it?"</p>

<p>"Lorn gave it me," said the man, sulkily, "and
I want the Dante!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for that," retorted Hagar, certain
that all was not right, "for no one but Mr. Lorn shall get
it. If he isn't ill, let him come and receive it from
me."</p>

<p>The man swore and completely lost his temper&mdash;a fact which
did not disturb Hagar in the least. "You may as well clear
out," she said, coldly. "I have said that you
shan't have the book, so that closes the question."</p>

<p>"I'll call in the police!"</p>

<p>"Do so; there's a station five minutes' walk
from here."</p>

<p>Confounded by her coolness, the man snatched up the pawn-ticket,
and stamped out of the shop in a rage. Hagar took down the Dante,
looked at it carefully, and considered the position. Clearly there
was something wrong, and Eustace was in trouble, else why should he
send a stranger to redeem the book upon which he set such store? In
an ordinary case, Hagar might have received the ticket and money
without a qualm, so long as she was acting rightly in a legal
sense; but Eustace Lorn interested her strangely&mdash;why, she
could not guess&mdash;and she was anxious to guard his interests.
Moreover, the emissary possessed an untrustworthy face, and looked
a man capable, if not of crime, at least of treachery. How he had
obtained the ticket could only be explained by its owner; so, after
some cogitation, Hagar sent a message to Lorn. The gist of this
was, that he should come to the pawn-shop after closing time.</p>

<p>All the evening Hagar anxiously waited for her visitor,
and&mdash;such is the inconsequence of maids&mdash;she was angered
with herself for this very anxiety. She tried to think that it was
sheer curiosity to know the truth of the matter that made her
impatient for the arrival of Lorn; but deep in her heart there
lurked a perception of the actual state of things. It was not
curiosity so much as a wish to see the young man's face
again, to hear him speak, and feel that he was beside her. Though
without a chaperon, though not brought up under parental
government, Hagar had her own social code, and that a strict one.
In this instance, she thought that her mental attitude was
unmaidenly and unworthy of an unmarried girl. Hence, when Eustace
made his appearance at nine o'clock, she was brusque to the
verge of rudeness.</p>

<p>"Who was that man you sent for your book?" she
demanded, abruptly, when Lorn was seated in the back-parlor.</p>

<p>"Jabez Treadle. I could not come myself, so I sent him
with the ticket. Why did you not give him the Dante?"</p>

<p>"Because I did not like his face, and I thought he might
have stolen the ticket from you. Besides, I"&mdash;here Hagar
hesitated, for she was not anxious to admit that her real reason
had been a desire to see him again&mdash;"besides, I
don't think he is your friend," she finished,
lamely.</p>

<p>"Very probably he is not," replied Lorn, shrugging
his shoulders. "I have no friends."</p>

<p>"That is a pity," said Hagar, casting a searching
glance at his irresolute face. "I think you need
friends&mdash;or, at all events, one staunch one."</p>

<p>"May that staunch one be of your own sex," said
Lorn, rather surprised at the interest this strange girl displayed
in his welfare&mdash;"yourself, for instance?"</p>

<p>"If that could be so, I might give you unpalatable advice,
Mr. Lorn."</p>

<p>"Such as&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Don't trust the man you sent here&mdash;Mr.
Treadle. See, here is your Dante, young man. Pay me the money, and
take it away."</p>

<p>"I can't pay you the money, as I have none. I am as
poor as Job, but hardly so patient."</p>

<p>"But you offered the money through that Treadle
creature."</p>

<p>"Indeed no!" explained Eustace, frankly. "I
gave him the ticket, and he wished to redeem the book with his own
money."</p>

<p>"Did he really?" said Hagar, thoughtfully. "He
does not look like a student&mdash;as you do. Why did he want this
book?"</p>

<p>"To find out a secret."</p>

<p>"A secret, young man&mdash;contained in the
Dante?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There is a secret in the book which means
money."</p>

<p>"To you or Mr. Treadle?" demanded Hagar.</p>

<p>Eustace shrugged his shoulders. "To either one of us who
finds out the secret," he said, carelessly. "But indeed
I don't think it will ever be discovered&mdash;at all events
by me. Treadle may be more fortunate."</p>

<p>"If crafty ways can bring fortune, your man will
succeed," said Hagar, calmly. "He is a dangerous friend
for you, that Treadle. There is evidently some story about this
Dante of yours which he knows, and which he desires to turn to his
own advantage. If the story means money, tell it to me, and I may
be able to help you to the wealth. I am only a young girl, it is
true, Mr. Lorn; still, I am old in experience, and I may succeed
where you fail."</p>

<p>"I doubt it," replied Lorn, gloomily; "still,
it is kind of you to take this interest in a stranger. I am much
obliged to you, Miss?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call me Hagar," she interrupted, hastily. "I
am not used to fine titles."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Hagar," said he, with a kindly glance,
"I'll tell you the story of my Uncle Ben and his
strange will."</p>

<p>Hagar smiled to herself. It seemed to be her fate to have
dealings with wills&mdash;first that of Jacob; now this of
Lorn's uncle. However, she knew when to hold her tongue, and
saying nothing, she waited for Eustace to explain. This he did at
once.</p>

<p>"My uncle, Benjamin Gurth, died six months ago at the age
of fifty-eight," said he, slowly. "In his early days he
had lived a roving life, and ten years ago he came home with a
fortune from the West Indies."</p>

<p>"How much fortune?" demanded Hagar, always
interested in financial matters.</p>

<p>"That is the odd part about it," continued Eustace;
"nobody ever knew the amount of his wealth, for he was a
grumpy old curmudgeon, who confided in no one. He bought a little
house and garden at Woking, and there lived for the ten years he
was in England. His great luxury was books, and as he knew many
languages&mdash;Italian among others&mdash;he collected quite a
polyglot library."</p>

<p>"Where is it now?"</p>

<p>"It was sold after his death along with the house and
land. A man in the city claimed the money and obtained
it."</p>

<p>"A creditor. What about the fortune?"</p>

<p>"I'm telling you, Hagar, if you'll only
listen," said Eustace, impatiently. "Well, Uncle Ben,
as I have said, was a miser. He hoarded up all his moneys and kept
them in the house, trusting neither to banks nor investments. My
mother was his sister, and very poor; but he never gave her a
penny, and to me nothing but the Dante, which he presented in an
unusual fit of generosity."</p>

<p>"But from what you said before," remarked Hagar,
shrewdly, "it seemed to me that he had some motive in giving
you the Dante."</p>

<p>"No doubt," assented Eustace, admiring her
sharpness.</p>

<p>"The secret of where his money is hidden is contained in
that Dante."</p>

<p>"Then you may be sure, Mr. Lorn, that he intended to make
you his heir. But what has your friend Treadle to do with the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Treadle is a grocer in Woking," responded Lorn.
"He is greedy for money, and knowing that Uncle Ben was rich,
he tried to get the cash left to him. He wheedled and flattered the
old man; he made him presents, and always tried to set him against
me as his only relative."</p>

<p>"Didn't I say the man was your enemy? Well, go
on."</p>

<p>"There is little more to tell, Hagar. Uncle Ben hid his
money away, and left a will which gave it all to the person who
should find out where it was concealed. The testament said the
secret was contained in the Dante. You may be sure that Treadle
visited me at once and asked to see the book. I showed it to him,
but neither of us could find any sign in its pages likely to lead
us to discover the hidden treasure. The other day Treadle came to
see the Dante again. I told him that I had pawned it, so he
volunteered to redeem it if I gave him the ticket. I did so, and he
called on you. The result you know."</p>

<p>"Yes; I refused to give it to him," said Hagar,
"and I see now that I was quite right to do so, as the man is
your enemy. Well, Mr. Lorn, it seems from your story that a fortune
is waiting for you, if you can find it."</p>

<p>"Very true; but I can't find it. There isn't a
single sign in the Dante by which I can trace the
hiding-place."</p>

<p>"Do you know Italian?"</p>

<p>"Very well. Uncle Ben taught it to me."</p>

<p>"That's one point gained," said Hagar, placing
the Dante on the table and lighting another candle. "The
secret may be contained in the poem itself. However, we shall see.
Is there any mark in the book&mdash;a marginal mark, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Not one. Look for yourself."</p>

<p>The two comely young heads, one so fair, the other so dark, were
bent over the book in that dismal and tenebrous atmosphere.
Eustace, the weaker character of the twain, yielded in all things
to Hagar. She turned over page after page of the old Florentine
edition, but not one pencil or pen-mark marred its pure white
surface from beginning to end. From "L'Inferno"
to "Il Paradiso" no hint betrayed the secret of the
hidden money. At the last page, Eustace, with a sigh, threw himself
back in his chair.</p>

<p>"You see, Hagar, there is nothing. What are you frowning
at?"</p>

<p>"I am not frowning, but thinking, young man," was
her reply. "If the secret is in this book, there must be some
trace of it. Now, nothing appears at present, but later
on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," said Eustace, impatiently, "later
on?</p>

<p>"Invisible ink."</p>

<p>"Invisible ink!" he repeated, vaguely. "I
don't quite understand."</p>

<p>"My late master," said Hagar, without emotion,
"was accustomed to deal with thieves, rogues, end vagabonds.
Naturally, he had many secrets, and sometimes by force of
circumstances, he had to trust these secrets to the post.
Naturally, also, he did not wish to risk discovery, so when he sent
a letter, about stolen goods for instance, he always wrote it in
lemon-juice."</p>

<p>"In lemon-juice! And what good was that?"</p>

<p>"It was good for invisible writing. When the letter was
written, it looked like a blank page. No one, you understand, could
read what was set out, for to the ordinary eye there was no writing
at all."</p>

<p>"And to the cultured eye?" asked Eustace, in
ironical tones.</p>

<p>"It appeared the same&mdash;a blank sheet," retorted
Hagar. "But then the cultured mind came in, young man. The
person to whom the letter was sent warmed the seeming blank page
over the fire, when at once the writing appeared, black and
legible."</p>

<p>"The deuce!" Eustace jumped up in his excitement.
"And you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think that your late uncle may have adopted the same
plan," interrupted Hagar, coolly, "but I am not sure.
However, we shall soon see." She turned over a page or two of
the Dante. "It is impossible to heat these over the
fire," she added, "as the book is valuable, and we must
not spoil it; but I know of a plan."</p>

<p>With a confident smile she left the room and returned with a
flat iron, which she placed on the fire. While it was heating
Eustace looked at this quick-witted woman with admiration. Not only
had she brains, but beauty also; and, man-like, he was attracted by
this last in no small degree. Shortly he began to think that this
strange and unexpected friendship between himself and the
pawnbroking gipsy beauty might develop into something stronger and
warmer. But here he sighed; both of them were poor, so it would be
impossible to&mdash;</p>

<p>"We will not begin at the beginning of the book,"
said Hagar, taking the iron off the fire, and thereby interrupting
his thoughts, "but at the end."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Eustace, who could see no good reason
for this decision.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hagar, poising the heated iron over the
book, "when I search for an article I find it always at the
bottom of a heap of things I don't want. As we began with the
first page of this book and found nothing, let us start this time
from the end, and perhaps we shall learn your uncle's secret
the sooner. It is only a whim of mine, but I should like to satisfy
it by way of experiment."</p>

<p>Eustace nodded and laughed, while Hagar placed a sheet of brown
paper over the last page of the Dante to preserve the book from
being scorched. In a minute she lifted the iron and paper, but the
page still showed no mark. With a cheerful air the girl shook her
head, and repeated the operation on the second page from the end.
This time, when she took away the brown paper, Eustace, who had
been watching her actions with much interest, bent forward with an
ejaculation of surprise. Hagar echoed it with one of delight; for
there was a mark and date on the page, half-way down, as thus:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="0606101h-images/page050.png" width=
"800" height="168" alt="">
</p>

<p>"There, Mr. Lorn!" cried Hagar,
joyously&mdash;"there is the secret! My fancy for beginning
at the end was right. I was right also about the invisible
ink."</p>

<p>"You are a wonder!" said Eustace, with sincere
admiration; "but I am as much in the dark as ever. I see a
marked line, and a date, the twenty-seventh of December, in the
year, I presume, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight. We
can't make any sense out of that simplicity."</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry," said Hagar, soothingly;
"we have found out so much, we may learn more. First of all,
please to translate those three lines."</p>

<p>"Roughly," said Eustace, reading them, "they
run thus: 'O abundant grace, with whom I tried to look
through the eternal light so much that I lost my
sight.'" He shrugged his shoulders. "I
don't see how that transcendentalism can help us."</p>

<p>"What about the date?"</p>

<p>"One thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight," said
Lorn, thoughtfully; "and this is ninety-six. Take one from
the other, it leaves fifty-eight, the age at which, as I told you
before, my uncle died. Evidently this is the date of his
birth."</p>

<p>"A date of birth&mdash;a line of Dante!" muttered
Hagar. "I must say that it is difficult to make sense out of
it. Yet, in figures and letters, I am sure the place where the
money is concealed is told."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Eustace, giving up the solution of
this problem in despair, "if you can make out the riddle it
is more than I can."</p>

<p>"Patience, patience!" replied Hagar, with a nod.
"Sooner or later we shall find out the meaning. Could you
take me to see your uncle's house at Woking?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; it is not yet let, so we can easily go over it.
But will you trouble about coming all that way with me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! I am anxious to know the meaning of this line
and date. There may be something about your uncle's house
likely to give a clue to its reading. I shall keep the Dante, and
puzzle over the riddle; you can call for me on Sunday, when the
shop is closed, and we shall go to Woking together."</p>

<p>"O Hagar! how can I ever thank&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank me when you get the money, and rid yourself of Mr.
Treadle!" said Hagar, cutting him short. "Besides, I am
only doing this to satisfy my own curiosity."</p>

<p>"You are an angel!"</p>

<p>"And you a fool, who talks nonsense!" said Hagar,
sharply. "Here is your hat and cane. Come out this way by the
back. I have an ill enough name already, without desiring a fresh
scandal. Good night."</p>

<p>"But may I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing!" retorted Hagar, pushing him out
of the door. "Good night."</p>

<p>The door snapped to sharply, and Lorn went out into the hot July
night with his heart beating and his blood aflame. He had seen this
girl only twice, yet, with the inconsiderate rashness of youth, he
was already in love with her. The beauty and kindness and brilliant
mind of Hagar attracted him strongly; and she had shown him such
favor that he felt certain she loved him in return. But a girl out
of a pawn-shop! He had neither birth nor money, yet he drew back
from mating himself with such a one. True, his mother was dead, and
he was quite alone in the world&mdash;alone and poor. Still, if he
found his uncle's fortune, he would be rich enough to marry.
Hagar, did she aid him to get the money, might expect reward in the
shape of marriage. And she was so beautiful, so clever! By the time
he reached his poor lodging Eustace had put all scruples out of his
head, and had settled to marry the gipsy as soon as the lost
treasure came into his possession. In no other way could he thank
her for the interest she was taking in him. This may seem a hasty
decision; but young blood is soon heated; young hearts are soon
filled with love. Youth and beauty drawn together are as flint and
tinder to light the torch of Hymen.</p>

<p>Punctual to the appointed hour, Eustace, as smart as he could
make himself with the poor means at his command, appeared at the
door of the pawn-shop. Hagar was already waiting for him, with the
Dante in her hand. She wore a black dress, a black cloak, and a hat
of the same somber hue&mdash;such clothes being the mourning she
had worn, and was wearing, for Jacob. Averse as she was to using
Goliath's money, she thought he would hardly grudge her these
garments of wo for his father. Besides, as manageress of the shop,
she deserved some salary.</p>

<p>"Why are you taking the Dante?" asked Eustace, when
they set out for Waterloo Station.</p>

<p>"It may be useful to read the riddle," said
Hagar.</p>

<p>"Have you solved it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I am not sure," she said,
meditatively. "I tried by counting the lines on that page up
and down. You understand&mdash;twenty-seven, twelve, thirty-eight;
but the lines I lighted on gave me no clue."</p>

<p>"You didn't understand them?"</p>

<p>"Yes I did," replied Hagar, coolly. "I got a
second-hand copy of a translation from the old bookseller in
Carby's Crescent, and by counting the lines to correspond
with those in the Florentine editlon I arrived at the
sense."</p>

<p>"And none of them point to the solution of the
problem?"</p>

<p>"Not one. Then I tried by pages. I counted twenty-seven
pages, but could find no clue; I reckoned twelve pages; also
thirty-eight; still the same result. Then I took the twelfth, the
twenty-seventh, and the thirty-eighth page by numbers, but found
nothing. The riddle is hard to read."</p>

<p>"Impossible, I should say," said Eustace, in
despair.</p>

<p>"No; I think I have found out the meaning."</p>

<p>"How? how? Tell me quick!"</p>

<p>"Not now. I found a word, but it seems nonsense, as I
could not find it in the Italian dictionary which I
borrowed."</p>

<p>"What is the word?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when I have seen the
house."</p>

<p>In vain Eustace tried to move her from this determination. Hagar
was stubborn when she took an idea into her strong brain; so she
simply declined to explain until she arrived at Woking&mdash;at the
house of Uncle Ben. Weak himself, Eustace could not understand how
she could hold out so long against his persuasions. Finally he
decided in his own mind that she did not care about him. In this he
was wrong. Hagar liked him&mdash;loved him; but she deemed it her
duty to teach him patience&mdash;a quality he lacked sadly. Hence
her closed mouth.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Woking, Eustace led the way towards his
late uncle's house, which was some distance out of the town.
He addressed Hagar, after a long silence, when they were crossing a
piece of waste land and saw the cottage in the distance.</p>

<p>"If you find this money for me," he said, abruptly,
"what service am I to do for you in return?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of that," replied Hagar, promptly.
"Find Goliath&mdash;otherwise James Dix."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Lorn, flushing. "Some one
you are fond of?"</p>

<p>"Some one I hate with all my soul!" she flashed out;
"but he is the son of my late master, and heir to the
pawn-shop. I look after it only because he is absent; and on the
day he returns I shall walk out of it, and never set eyes on it, or
him again."</p>

<p>"Why don't you advertise?"</p>

<p>"I have done so for months; so has Vark, the lawyer; but
Jimmy Dix never replies. He was with my tribe in the New Forest,
and it was because I hated him that I left the Romany. Since then
he has gone away, and I don't know where he is. Find him if
you wish to thank me, and let me get away from the
pawn-shop."</p>

<p>"Very good," replied Eustace, quietly. "I
shall find him. In the mean time, here is the hermitage of my late
uncle."</p>

<p>It was a bare little cottage, small and shabby, set at the end
of a square of ground fenced in from the barren moor. Within the
quadrangle there were fruit trees&mdash;cherry, apple, plum, and
pear; also a large fig-tree in the center of the unshaven lawn
facing the house. All was desolate and neglected; the fruit trees
were unpruned, the grass was growing in the paths, and the flowers
were straggling here and there, rich masses of ragged color.
Desolate certainly, this deserted hermitage, but not lonely, for as
Hagar and her companion turned in at the little gate a figure rose
from a stooping position under an apple-tree. It was that of a man
with a spade in his hand, who had been digging for some time, as
was testified by the heap of freshly-turned earth at his feet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Treadle!" cried Lorn, indignantly. "What
are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Lookin' fur the old un's cash!"
retorted Mr. Treadle, with a scowl directed equally at the young
man and Hagar. "An' if I gets it I keeps it. Lord! to
think as 'ow I pampered that old sinner with figs and such
like&mdash;to say nothing of French brandy, which he drank by the
quart!"</p>

<p>"You have no business here!"</p>

<p>"No more 'ave you!" snapped the irate grocer.
"If I ain't, you ain't, fur till the 'ouse
is let it's public property. I s'pose you've come
'ere with that Jezebel to look fur the money?"</p>

<p>Hagar, hearing herself called names, stepped promptly up to Mr.
Treadle, and boxed his red ears. "Now then," she said,
when the grocer fell back in dismay at this onslaught,
"perhaps you'll be civil! Mr. Lorn, sit down on this
seat, and I'll explain the riddle."</p>

<p>"The Dante!" cried Mr. Treadle, recognizing the book
which lay on Hagar's lap&mdash;"an' she'll
explain the riddle&mdash;swindling me out of my rightful
cash!"</p>

<p>"The cash belongs to Mr. Lorn, as his uncle's
heir!" said Hagar, wrathfully. "Be quiet, sir, or
you'll get another box on the ears!"</p>

<p>"Never mind him," said Eustace, impatiently;
"tell me the riddle."</p>

<p>"I don't know if I have guessed it correctly,"
answered Hagar, opening the book; "but I've tried by
line and page and number, all of which revealed nothing. Now I try
by letters, and you will see if the word they make is a proper
Italian one."</p>

<p>She read out the marked line and the date. "'Ficcar
lo viso per la luce eterna, 27th December, '38.'
Now," said Hagar, slowly, "if you run all the figures
together they stand as 271238."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" said Eustace, impatiently; "I see.
Go on, please."</p>

<p>Hagar continued: "Take the second letter of the word
'Ficcar.'"</p>

<p>"'I.'"</p>

<p>"Also the seventh letter from the beginning of the
line."</p>

<p>Eustace counted. "'L.' I see," he went
on, eagerly. "Also the first letter, 'F,' the
second again, 'i,' the third and the eighth,
'c' and 'o.'"</p>

<p>"Good!" said Hagar, writing these down. "Now,
the whole make up the word 'Ilfico.' Is that an Italian
word?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," said Eustace, thoughtfully.
"'Ilfico.' No."</p>

<p>"Shows what eddication 'e's got!"
growled Mr. Treadle, who was leaning on his spade.</p>

<p>Eustace raised his eyes to dart a withering glance at the
grocer, and in doing so his vision passed on to the tree looming up
behind the man. At once the meaning of the word flashed on his
brain.</p>

<p>"'Il fico!'" he cried, rising.
"Two words instead of one! You have found it, Hagar! It means
the fig-tree&mdash;the one yonder. I believe the money is buried
under it."</p>

<p>Before he could advance a step Treadle had leaped forward, and
was slashing away at the tangled grass round the fig-tree like a
madman.</p>

<p>"If 'tis there, 'tis mine!" he shouted.
"Don't you come nigh me, young Lorn, or I'll
brain you with my spade! I fed up that old uncle of yours like a
fighting cock, and now I'm going to have his cash to pay
me!"</p>

<p>Eustace leaped forward in the like manner as Treadle had done,
and would have wrenched the spade out of his grip, but that Hagar
laid a detaining hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Let him dig," she said, coolly. "The money is
yours; I can prove it. He'll have the work and you the
fortune."</p>

<p>"Hagar! Hagar! how can I thank you!"</p>

<p>The girl stepped back, and a blush rose in her cheeks.
"Find Goliath," she said, "and let me get rid of
the pawn-shop."</p>

<p>At this moment Treadle gave a shout of glee, and with both arms
wrenched a goodly-sized tin box out of the hole he had dug.</p>

<p>"Mine! mine!" he cried, plumping this down on the
grass. "This will pay for the dinners I gave him, the
presents I made him. I've bin castin' my bread on the
waters, and here it's back again."</p>

<p>He fell to forcing the lid of the box with the edge of the
spade, all the time laughing and crying like one demented. Lorn and
Hagar drew near, in the expectation of seeing a shower of gold
pieces rain on the ground when the lid was opened. As Treadle gave
a final wrench it flew wide, and they saw&mdash;an empty box.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what," stammered Treadle,
thunderstruck&mdash;"what does it mean?"</p>

<p>Eustace, equally taken aback, bent down and looked in. There was
absolutely nothing in the box but a piece of folded paper. Unable
to make a remark, he held it out to the amazed Hagar.</p>

<p>"What the d&mdash;l does it mean?" said Treadle
again.</p>

<p>"This explains," said Hagar, running her eye over
the writing. "It seems that this wealthy Uncle Ben was a
pauper."</p>

<p>"A pauper!" cried Eustace and Treadle together.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Hagar, and read out from the page:
"When I returned to England I was thought wealthy, so that
all my friends and relations fawned on me for the crumbs which fell
from the rich man's table. But I had just enough money to
rent the cottage for a term of years, and to purchase an annuity
barely sufficient for the necessities of life. But, owing to the
report of my wealth, the luxuries have been supplied by those who
hoped for legacies. This is my legacy to one and all&mdash;these
golden words, which I have proved true: 'It is better to be
thought rich than to be rich.'"</p>

<p>The paper fell from the hand of Eustace, and Treadle, with a
howl of rage, threw himself on the grass, loading the memory of the
deceased with opprobrious names. Seeing that all was over, that the
expected fortune had vanished into thin air, Hagar left the
disappointed grocer weeping with rage over the deceptive tin box,
and led Eustace away. He followed her as in a dream, and all the
time during their sad journey back to town he spoke hardly a word.
What they did say&mdash;how Eustace bewailed his fate and Hagar
comforted him&mdash;is not to the point. But on arriving at the
door of the pawn-shop Hagar gave the copy of Dante to the young
man. "I give this back to you," she said, pressing his
hand. "Sell it, and with the proceeds build up your own
fortune."</p>

<p>"But shall I not see you again?" he asked,
piteously.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Lorn; you shall see me when you bring back
Goliath."</p>

<p>Then she entered the pawn-shop and shut the door. Left alone in
the deserted crescent, Eustace sighed and walked slowly away.
Hugging to his breast the Florentine Dante, he went away to make
his fortune, to find Goliath, and&mdash;although he did not know it
at the time&mdash;to marry Hagar.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="III" id="III"></a>Chapter III<br>
The Second Customer And The Amber Beads</b>
</h2>

<p>AFTER the episode of the Florentine Dante, Hagar lost her high
spirits. She had sent Eustace away to make his fortune, and to
discover, if possible, the lost heir of Jacob Dix. By this act of
self-denial, as it really was, she had deprived herself of all
pleasure; she had robbed herself of what might have been a bright
future; consequently she was less cheerful than of yore.
Nevertheless, she felt convinced that Lorn loved her, and that he
would earn her gratitude&mdash;possibly her hand&mdash;by returning
with Goliath at his heels. When that event took place she would
recover at once her spirits and her lover; but at present the
business of the pawn-shop took up her undivided attention, and
forced her to put away sad thoughts and melancholy considerations.
Also, Providence provided distraction for her dismal humors by
sending her a negress to pawn a necklace of amber beads. Although
Hagar did not know it at the time, this was the beginning of a
second and rather more serious adventure.</p>

<p>It was drawing to night one August evening when the woman made
her appearance, and the atmosphere of the pawnshop was darker than
usual. Still, it was sufficiently light for Hagar to see that her
customer was a tall and bulky negress, arrayed in a gaudy yellow
dress, neutralized by trimmings of black jet beading. As the
evening was hot and close, she wore neither cloak nor jacket, but
displayed her somewhat shapeless figure to the full in this
decidedly startling costume. Her hat was a garden of
roses&mdash;red, white and yellow; she wore a large silver brooch
like a shield, an extensive necklace of silver coins, and many
bangles of the same metal on her black wrists. As a contrast to
these splendors she wore no gloves, nor did she hide her coal-black
face with a veil. Altogether, this odd customer was the blackest
and most fantastically-dressed negress that Hagar had ever seen,
and in the dim light she looked a striking but rather alarming
figure.</p>

<p>On Hagar coming to the counter this black woman produced out of
a silver-clasped sealskin satchel a necklace, which she handed
silently to Hagar for inspection. As the light was too imperfect to
admit of a close examination, Hagar lighted the gas, but when it
flamed up the negress, as though unwilling to be seen too clearly
in the searching glare, stepped back hastily into the darkness.
Hagar put this retrograde movement down to the natural timidity of
a person unaccustomed to pawning, and took but little notice of it
at the time. Afterwards she had cause to remember it.</p>

<p>The necklace was a string of magnificent amber beads threaded on
a slender chain of gold. Each bead was as large as the egg of a
sparrow, and round the middle of every single one there was a
narrow belt of tiny diamonds. The clasp at the back was of fine
gold, square in shape, and curiously wrought to the representation
of a hideous Ethiopian face, with diamonds for eyes. This queer
piece of jewelry was unique of its kind, and, as Hagar rapidly
calculated, of considerable value. Nevertheless, she offered,
according to custom, as low a sum as she well could.</p>

<p>"I'll give five pounds on it," said she,
returning to the counter.</p>

<p>Rather to her surprise, the negress accepted with a sharp nod,
and then took out of her bag a scrap of paper. On this was written
laboriously: "Rosa, Marylebone Road." The name and
address were so imperfect that Hagar hesitated before making out
the pawn-ticket.</p>

<p>"Have you no other name but Rosa?" she asked,
sharply.</p>

<p>The negress shook her head, and kept well in the shadow.</p>

<p>"And no more particular address than Marylebone
Road?"</p>

<p>Again the black woman made a negative sign, whereat, annoyed by
these gestures, Hagar grew angered.</p>

<p>"Can't you speak?" she demanded, tartly.
"Are you dumb?"</p>

<p>At once the negress nodded, and laid a finger on her lips. Hagar
drew back. This woman was black, she was dumb, she gave half a
name, half an address, and she wished to pawn a valuable and unique
piece of jewelry. The whole affair was queer, and, as Hagar
considered, might be rather dangerous. Perhaps this silent negress
was disposing of stolen goods, as the necklace seemed too fine for
her to possess. For the moment Hagar was inclined to refuse to do
business; but a glance at the amber beads decided her to make the
bargain. She could get it cheap; she was acting well within the
legal limits of business; and if the police did appear in the
matter, no blame could be attached to her for the transaction.
Biased by these considerations, Hagar made out the ticket in the
name Rosa, and took a clean new five-pound note out of the
cash-box. As she was about to give ticket and money across the
counter she paused. "I'll take the number of this
note," she thought, going to the desk; "if this negress
can't be traced by name or address, the bank-note number will
find her if it is necessary."</p>

<p>Deeming this precaution judicious, Hagar hastily scribbled down
the number of the five-pound note, and returning to the counter,
gave it and the ticket to her queer customer. The negress stretched
out her right hand for them; and then Hagar made a discovery which
she noted mentally as a mark of identification if necessary.
However, she said nothing, but tried to get a good look at the
woman's face. The customer, however, kept well in the shadow,
and swept note and ticket into her bag hurriedly. Then she bowed
and left the shop.</p>

<p>Six days later Hagar received a printed notice from New Scotland
Yard, notifying to all pawn-brokers that the police were in search
of a necklace of amber beads set with diamonds, and clasped with a
negro's face wrought in gold. Notice of its whereabouts was
to be sent to the Detective Department without delay. Remembering
her suspicions, and recalling the persistent way in which the
negress had averted her face, Hagar was not much surprised by this
communication. Curious to know the truth, and to learn what crime
might be attached to the necklace, she wrote at once about the
matter. Within four hours a stranger presented himself to see the
amber beads, and to question her concerning the woman who had
pawned the same. He was a fat little man, with a healthy red face
and shrewd twinkling eyes. Introducing himself as Luke Horval, of
the detective service, he asked Hagar to relate the circumstances
of the pawning. This the girl did frankly enough, but without
communicating her own suspicions. At the conclusion of her
narrative she displayed the amber beads, which were carefully
examined by Mr. Horval. Then he slapped his knee, and whistled in a
thoughtful sort of way.</p>

<p>"I guessed as much," said he, staring hard at Hagar.
"The negress did it."</p>

<p>"Did what?" asked the girl, curiously.</p>

<p>"Why," said Horval, "murdered the old
woman."</p>

<p>Murder! The word had a gruesome and cruel sound, which caused
Hagar's cheek to pale when it rang in her ears. She had
connected the amber beads with robbery, but scarcely with the
taking of life. The idea that she had been in the company of a
murderess gave Hagar a qualm; but, suppressing this as a weakness,
she asked Horval to tell her the details of the crime and how it
bore on the pawning of the amber beads.</p>

<p>"It's just this way, miss," explained the
detective, easily. "This Rosa is the nigger girl of Mrs.
Arryford&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is Rosa her real name?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I s'pose she thought she might lose the
beads if she gave a wrong one; but the address ain't right.
It's the other end of London as Mrs. Arryford lives&mdash;or
rather lived," added Horval, correcting himself,
"seeing she now occupies a Kensal Green grave&mdash;Campden
Hill, miss; a sweet little house in Bedford Gardens, where she
lived with Rosa and Miss Lyle."</p>

<p>"And who is Miss Lyle?"</p>

<p>"The companion of Mrs. Arryford. A dry stick of a
spinster, miss; not to be compared with a fine girl like
you."</p>

<p>Hagar did not deign to notice the compliment, but sharply
requested Mr. Horval to continue his story, which he did, in no
wise abashed by her cold demeanor.</p>

<p>"It's just this way, miss," said he again;
"the old lady, the old maid and the nigger wench lived
together in Bedford Gardens, a kind of happy family, as one might
say. Mrs. Arryford was the widder of a West Indian gent, and as
rich as Solomon. She brought those amber beads from Jamaica, and
Rosa was always wanting them."</p>

<p>"Why? The necklace was very unsuitable to one of her
condition."</p>

<p>"'Twasn't exactly the cost of it as she
thought about," said Horval, nursing his chin, "but it
seems that the necklace is a fetish, or charm, or lucky-penny, as
you might say, to bring good fortune to the wearer. Mrs. Arryford
was past wanting good luck, so hadn't no need for the beads.
Rosa asked her for them, just for the good luck of them, as you
might say. The old girl wouldn't part, as she was as
superstitious as Rosa herself over that necklace; so in the end
Rosa murdered her to get it."</p>

<p>"How do you know she did?" asked Hagar,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"How do I know?" echoed the detective in surprise.
"'Cause I ain't a fool, miss. Last week Mrs.
Arryford was found in her bed with a carving knife in her heart, as
dead as a door-nail, and the beads were missing. Miss Lyle, she
didn't know anything about it, and Rosa swore she
hadn't left her room, so, you see, we couldn't quite
hit on who finished off Mrs. Arryford. But now as I know Rosa
pawned these beads, I'm sure she did the job."</p>

<p>"What made you think that the beads might have been
pawned?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that was Miss Lyle's idea; a sharp old girl she
is, miss. She was very fond of Mrs. Arryford, as she well might be,
seeing as the old lady was rich and kept her like a princess. Often
she heard Rosa ask for those beads, so when Mrs. Arryford was
killed and the beads missing she told me as she was sure Rosa had
done the trick."</p>

<p>"But the pawning?"</p>

<p>"Well, miss," said Horval, scratching his chin,
"it was just this way. Miss Lyle said as how Rosa, to get rid
of the necklace until the affair of the murder was blown over,
might pawn it. I thought so too, so I sent a printed slip to all
the pop-shops in London. You wrote that the beads were here, so it
seems as Miss Lyle was right."</p>

<p>"Evidently. By the way, who gets the money of Mrs.
Arryford?"</p>

<p>"A Mr. Frederick Jevons; he's a nephew of Miss
Lyle's."</p>

<p>"A nephew of Miss Lyle's!" echoed Hagar, in
surprise. "And why did Mrs. Arryford leave her money to him
instead of to her relatives?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's just this way, miss," said Horval,
rising. "She hadn't got no relatives; and as Mr. Jevons
was a good-looking young chap, always at the house to see his aunt,
she took a fancy to him and left the money his way."</p>

<p>"You are sure that Miss Lyle is no relation to Mrs.
Arryford?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. She was only the old girl's
companion."</p>

<p>"Was Mrs. Arryford weak in the head?"</p>

<p>"Not as I ever heard of," said Mr. Horval, with a
stare, "but you can find out, if you like, from Miss
Lyle."</p>

<p>"Miss Lyle! How am I to see her?"</p>

<p>"Why," said the detective, clapping on his hat,
"when you come to see if Rosa is the same nigger as pawned
the amber beads. Just leave someone to look after the shop, miss,
and come with me right away."</p>

<p>With true feminine curiosity, Hagar agreed at once to accompany
the detective to Campden Hill. The shop was delivered into the
charge of Bolker, a misshapen imp of sixteen, who for some months
had been the plague of Hagar's life. He had a long body and
long arms, short legs and a short temper, and also a most malignant
eye, which indicated only too truly his spiteful nature. Having
given a few instructions to this charming lad, Hagar departed with
Horval in the omnibus, and arrived at Bedford Gardens early in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>The house was a quaint, pretty cottage, which stood in a
delightful garden&mdash;once the solace of poor dead Mrs.
Arryford's soul&mdash;and was divided from the road by a tall
fence of iron railings closed in with wooden planks painted a dark
green. The room into which the detective and gipsy were shown was a
prim and rather cosy apartment, which bore the impress of Miss
Lyle's old-maidism in the disposition of the furniture. When
they were seated here, and were waiting for Miss Lyle, who had been
advised of their arrival, Hagar suddenly asked Horval a leading
question.</p>

<p>"Is Rosa dumb?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Bless you, no!" answered Horval. "It's
true as she don't talk much, but she can use her tongue in
nigger fashion. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"She said she was dumb when she pawned the
beads."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was 'cause she was too 'cute to let
her voice betray her," replied Horval, smiling. He had humor
enough to note Hagar's unconscious bull; but as she was
likely to be useful to him in the conduct of the case, he did not
wish to anger her by remarking on it.</p>

<p>When Miss Lyle made her appearance, Hagar, after the manner of
women, took immediate note of her looks and manner. The old maid
was tall and lean and yellow, with cold gray eyes, and a
thin-lipped, hard-tempered mouth, turned down at the curves. Her
iron-gray hair was drawn tightly off her narrow forehead and
screwed into a hard-looking knob behind. She wore a black stuff
gown, somber and lusterless; collar and cuffs of white linen, and
cloth slippers, in which she glided noiselessly. Altogether an
unpromising, hard woman, acidulated and narrow-minded, who looked
disapprovingly on the rich beauty of Hagar, and remarked her graces
with a jaundiced eye and a vinegary look. The cough with which she
ended her inspection showed that she condemned the girl at first
sight.</p>

<p>"Is this young person necessary to your conduct of the
case?" said Miss Lyle, addressing herself to Horval, and
ignoring Hagar altogether.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, miss," replied Horval, on whom the
antagonistic attitude of the two women was not lost. "She
keeps the pawn-shop at which Rosa pawned the beads!"</p>

<p>Miss Lyle gave a start of virtuous horror, and her thin lips
wreathed in a viperous smile. "The wretch did kill my poor
friend, then," she said in a soft and fluty voice. "I
knew it!"</p>

<p>"She pawned the amber beads, Miss Lyle,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, don't say the wretch didn't kill my
martyred friend," snapped Miss Lyle, going to the bell-rope;
"but we'll have her in, and perhaps this young person
will recognize her as the viper who pawned the beads."</p>

<p>"It is to be hoped so," said Hagar, very dryly, not
approving of being spoken at in the third person; "but the
negress kept her face turned away, and I might
not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is your duty to recognize her," exclaimed Miss
Lyle, addressing herself to the girl for once. "I am
convinced that Rosa is a dangerous criminal. Here she is&mdash;the
black Jezebel!"</p>

<p>As the last word fell from her mouth the door opened, and Rosa
entered the room, whereat Hagar uttered an exclamation of surprise.
This regress was rather short, and more than a trifle stout. It is
true that she wore a yellow dress trimmed with black jet beading;
that silver ornaments were on her neck and wrists; also that she
was without the wonderful hat. Still, Hagar was surprised, and
explained her ejaculation forthwith.</p>

<p>"That is not the woman who pawned the beads!" she
declared, rising.</p>

<p>"Not the woman?" echoed Miss Lyle, virulently.
"She must be! This is Rosa!"</p>

<p>"Yis, yis! I Rosa," said the negress, beginning to
weep, "but I no kill my poo' dear missy. Dat one big
lie."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, miss, that this is not the woman?"
asked Horval, rather dismayed.</p>

<p>Hagar stepped forward, and looked sharply at the sobbing negress
up and down. Then she glanced at the woman's hands and shook
her head.</p>

<p>"I am prepared to swear in a court of law that this is not
the woman," she said, quietly.</p>

<p>"Rubbish, rubbish!" cried Miss Lyle, flushing.
"Rosa coveted the necklace, as it was connected with some
debased African superstition, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It one ole fetish!" interrupted Rosa, her eyes
sparkling fire at the old maid, "and ole missy she did wish
to gib it me, but you no let her."</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" said Miss Lyle, with dignity.
"The necklace was not fit for you to wear. And because I
persuaded Mrs. Arryford not to give it to you, you murdered her,
you wretch! Down on your knees, woman, and confess!"</p>

<p>"I no 'fess!" exclaimed the terrified negress.
"I no kill my missy! I no gib dose amber beads for money. If
dose beads mine, I keep dem; dey a mighty big fetish, for
sure!"</p>

<p>"One moment," said Horval, as Miss Lyle was about to
speak again, "let us conduct this inquiry calmly, and give
the accused every chance Miss," he said, turning to Hagar,
"on what day, at what time, was it that the beads were
pawned?"</p>

<p>Hagar calculated rapidly, and answered promptly: "On the
evening of the 23d of August, between six and seven
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Miss Lyle, joyfully&mdash;"and
on that very evening Rosa was out, and did not return till
nine!"</p>

<p>"Me went to see Massa Jevons for you," said Rosa
vehemently; "you send me."</p>

<p>"I send you! Just listen to the creature's lies!
Besides, Mr. Jevons's rooms are in Duke Street, St
James's, whereas it was at Lambeth you were."</p>

<p>"I no go to dat gem'man's house. You send me
to de train Waterloo!"</p>

<p>"Waterloo!" said Horval, looking sharply at Rosa.
"You were there?"</p>

<p>"Yis, masse; me dere at seven and eight."</p>

<p>"In the neighbourhood of Lambeth," murmured Horval.
"She might have gone to the pawn-shop after all."</p>

<p>"Of course she did!" cried Miss Lyle,
vindictively&mdash;"and pawned the amber beads of my poor
dead friend!"</p>

<p>"She did nothing of the sort!" interposed Hagar,
with spirit. "Whosoever pawned the beads, it was not this
woman. Besides, how do you know that Rosa killed Mrs.
Arryford?"</p>

<p>"She wanted the beads, young woman, and she killed my
friend to obtain them."</p>

<p>"No, no! dat one big lie!"</p>

<p>"I am sure it is!" said Hagar, her face aflame.
"I believe in your innocence, Rosa. Mr. Horval," she
added, turning to the detective, "you can't arrest this
woman, as you have no grounds to do so."</p>

<p>"Well, if she didn't pawn those
beads&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She did not, I tell you."</p>

<p>"She did!" cried Miss Lyle angrily. "I believe
you are an accomplice of the creature's!"</p>

<p>What reply Hagar would have made to this accusation it is
impossible to say, for at this moment a young man walked into the
room. He was good-looking in appearance, and smart in dress, but
there was a haggard look about his face which betokened
dissipation.</p>

<p>"This," said Miss Lyle, introducing him, "is
my nephew, the heir to the property of my late dear friend. He is
resolved, as such heir, to find out and punish the assassin of his
benefactress. For my part, I believe Rosa to be guilty."</p>

<p>"And I," cried Hagar, with energy, "believe
her to be innocent!"</p>

<p>"Let us hope she is," said Jevons, in a weary voice,
as he removed his gloves. "I am tired of the whole
affair."</p>

<p>"You are bound to punish the guilty!" said Miss
Lyle, in hard tones.</p>

<p>"But not the innocent," retorted Hagar, rising.</p>

<p>"Young woman, you are insolent!"</p>

<p>Hagar looked Miss Lyle up and down in the coolest manner; then
her eyes wandered to the well-dressed figure of Jevons, the heir.
What she saw in him to startle her it is difficult to say; but
after a moment's inspection she turned pale with suppressed
emotion. Stepping forward, she was about to speak, when, checking
herself suddenly, she beckoned to Horval, and advanced towards the
door.</p>

<p>"My errand here is fulfilled," she said, quietly.
"Mr. Horval, perhaps you will come with me."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you can go also, Rosa," cried Miss Lyle,
angered by the insulting gaze of the girl. "I am mistress
here in my nephew's house, and I refuse to let a murderess
remain under its roof!"</p>

<p>"Be content," said Hagar, pausing at the door.
"Rosa shall come with me; and when you see us again with Mr.
Horval, you will then learn who killed Mrs. Arryford, and
why."</p>

<p>"Insolent hussy!" muttered Miss Lyle, and closed the
door on Hagar, Horval and the black woman.</p>

<p>The trio walked away, and shortly afterwards picked up an
omnibus, in which they returned to the Lambeth pawnshop. Hagar
talked earnestly to Horval the whole way; and from the close
attention which the detective paid to her it would seem that the
conversation was of the deepest interest. Rosa, a dejected heap of
misery, sat with downcast eyes, and at intervals wiped away the
tears which ran down her black cheeks. The poor negress, under
suspicion as a thief and a murderess, turned out of house and home,
desolate and forsaken, was crushed to the earth under the burden of
her woes. On her the fetish necklace of amber beads had brought a
curse.</p>

<p>On arriving at the shop Hagar conducted Rosa into the back
parlor; and after a further conference she dismissed the
detective.</p>

<p>"You can stay with me for a week," she said to
Rosa.</p>

<p>"And den what you do?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Hagar, with an agreeable smile, "I
shall take you with me to denounce the assassin of your late
mistress."</p>

<p>All that week Rosa stayed in the domestic portion of the
pawn-shop, and made herself useful in cooking and cleaning. Hagar
questioned her closely concerning the events which had taken place
on the night of the murder in the house at Bedford Gardens, and
elicited certain information which gave her great satisfaction.
This she communicated to Horval when he one day paid her a hurried
visit. When in possession of the facts, Horval looked at her with
admiration, and on taking his leave he paid her a compliment.</p>

<p>"You ought to be a man, with that head of yours," he
said; "you're too good to be a woman!"</p>

<p>"And not bad enough to be a man," retorted Hagar,
laughing. "Be off with you, Mr. Horval, and let me know when
you want me up West."</p>

<p>In four more days Horval again made his appearance, this time in
a state of the greatest excitement. He was closeted with Hagar for
over an hour, and at its conclusion he departed in a great hurry.
Shortly after noon Hagar resigned the shop into Bolker's
charge, put on hat and cloak, and ordered Rosa to come with her.
What the reason of this unexpected departure might be she did not
inform the negress immediately; but before they reached their
destination Rosa knew all, and was much rejoiced thereat.</p>

<p>Hagar took Rosa as far as Duke Street, St James's, and
here, at the door of a certain house, they found the detective
impatiently waiting for them.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Horval," said Hagar, coming to a stop,
"is he indoors?"</p>

<p>"Safe and sound!" replied Horval, tapping his
breastcoat pocket&mdash;"and I have got you know what here.
Shall we come up?"</p>

<p>"Not immediately. I wish to see him by myself first. You
remain outside his door, and enter with Rosa when I call
you."</p>

<p>Mr. Horval nodded, with a full comprehension of what was
required of him, and the trio ascended the dark staircase. They
paused at a door on the second landing. Then Hagar, motioning to
her companions that they should withdraw themselves into the gloom,
rapped lightly on the portal. Shortly afterwards it was opened by
Mr. Frederick Jevons, who looked inquiringly at Hagar. She turned
her face towards the light which fell through the murky staircase
window, whereat, recognizing her, he stepped back in dismay.</p>

<p>"The pawn-shop girl!" said he in astonishment.
"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I wish to see you," replied Hagar, composedly,
"but it is just as well that our conversation should be in
private."</p>

<p>"Why, you can have nothing to say to me but what the whole
world might hear!"</p>

<p>"After I have mentioned the object of my visit you may
think differently," said Hagar, with some dryness.
"However, we'll talk here if you wish."</p>

<p>"No, no; come in," said Jevons, standing on one
side. "Since you insist upon privacy, you shall have it. This
way."</p>

<p>He showed her into a large and rather badly furnished room.
Evidently Mr. Fred Jevons had not been rich until he inherited the
fortune of Mrs. Arryford.</p>

<p>"I suppose you will be moving to the Bedford Gardens house
soon?" said Hagar, sitting composedly in a large
armchair.</p>

<p>"Is that what you came to speak to me about?"
retorted Jevons, rudely.</p>

<p>"Not exactly. Perhaps, as you are impatient, we had better
get to business."</p>

<p>"Business! What business can I have to do with
you?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Hagar, quietly, and looking directly at
him, "the business of those amber beads which
you&mdash;pawned."</p>

<p>"I," stammered Jevons, drawing back with a pale
face.</p>

<p>"Also," added Hagar, solemnly, "the business
which concerns the commission of a crime."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a&mdash;a crime!" gasped the wretched
creature.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the most terrible of all
crimes&mdash;murder!"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what&mdash;what do you&mdash;you
mean?"</p>

<p>Hagar rose from her chair, and, drawn to her full height,
stretched out an accusing arm towards the young man. "What I
mean you know well enough!" she said, sternly. "I mean
that you murdered Mrs. Arryford!"</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" cried Jevons, sinking into a
chair, for his legs refused to support him longer.</p>

<p>"It is not a lie&mdash;it is the truth! I have
evidence!"</p>

<p>"Evidence!" He started up with dry and trembling
lips.</p>

<p>"Yes. Through her influence over Mrs. Arryford, your aunt
induced her to make you her heir. You are fond of money; you are in
debt, and you could not wait until the old lady died in the course
of nature. On the night of the murder you were in the
house."</p>

<p>"No, no! I swear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You need not; you were seen leaving the house. To throw
suspicion on Rosa you disguised yourself as a negress, and came to
pawn the amber bead necklace at my shop. I recognized that the
supposed black woman was minus the little finger of the right hand.
You, Mr. Jevons, are mutilated in the same way. Again, I paid you
with a five-pound note. Of that note I took the number. It has been
traced by the number, and you are the man who paid it away. I
saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jevons jumped up, still white and shaking. "It's a
lie! a lie!" he said, hoarsely. "I did not kill Mrs.
Arryford; I did not pawn the beads. I did&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did both those things!" said Hagar, brushing
past him. "I have two witnesses who can prove what I say is
true. Rosa! Mr. Horval!"</p>

<p>She flung the outside door wide open, while Jevons again sank
into the arm-chair, with an expression of horror on his white face.
"Rosa! Horval!" he muttered. "I am
lost!"</p>

<p>Rosa and the detective entered quickly in response to
Hagar's call, and with her looked down on the shrinking
figure of the accused man.</p>

<p>"These are my witnesses," said Hagar, slowly.
"Rosa!"</p>

<p>"I saw dat man in de house when my missy died," said
the negress. "I hear noise in de night; I come down, and I
see Massa Jevons run away from de room of my missy, and Missus Lyle
let him out by de side door. He kill my poo' missy&mdash;yes,
I tink dat."</p>

<p>"You hear," said Hagar to the terrified man.
"Now, Mr. Horval."</p>

<p>"I traced the five-pound note you gave him by its
number," said the detective. "Yes, he paid it away at
his club; I can bring a waiter to prove it."</p>

<p>"You hear," said Hagar again; "and I know by
the evidence of your lost finger that you are the man, disguised as
a negress, who pawned the necklace which was stolen from the person
of Mrs. Arryford, after you murdered her. The dead woman, as Rosa
tells us, wore that necklace night and day. Only with her death
could it have been removed. You murdered her; you stole the
necklace of amber beads."</p>

<p>Jevons leaped up: "No, no, no!" he cried, loudly,
striking his hands together in despair. "I am
innocent!"</p>

<p>"That," said Horval, slipping the handcuffs on his
wrists, "you shall prove before a judge and jury."</p>

<p>When Jevons, still protesting his innocence, was removed to
prison, Hagar and the negress returned to Carby's Crescent.
It can easily be guessed how she had traced the crime home to
Jevons. She had noticed that the negress who pawned the beads had
no little finger. On being brought face to face with Rosa, she had
seen that the woman had not lost the finger; and when Jevons had
removed his gloves she had seen in his right hand the evidence that
he was one with the mysterious black woman of the pawn-shop. Still,
she was not certain; and it was only when Rosa had deposed to the
presence of the man at midnight in the Bedford Gardens house, and
when Horval had traced the five-pound note of which she had taken
the number, that she was certain that Jevons was the murderer.
Hence the accusation; hence the arrest. But now the fact of his
guilt was clearly established. To obtain the wealth of Mrs.
Arryford the wretched man had committed a crime; to hide that crime
and throw the blame on Rosa he had pawned the amber beads; and now
the amber beads were about to hang him. In the moment of his
triumph, when preparing to enjoy the fruits of his crime, Nemesis
had struck him down.</p>

<p>The news of the arrest, the story of the amber beads, was in all
the papers next day; and next day, also, Miss Lyle came to see
Hagar. Pale and stern, she swept into the shop, and looked at Hagar
with a bitter smile.</p>

<p>"Girl!" she said, harshly, "you have been our
evil genius!"</p>

<p>"I have been the means of denouncing your accomplice, you
mean," returned Hagar, composedly.</p>

<p>"My accomplice; no, my son!"</p>

<p>"Your son!" Hagar recoiled, with a startled
expression. "Your son, Miss Lyle?"</p>

<p>"Not Miss, but Mrs. Lyle," returned the gaunt, pale
woman; "and Frederick Jevons is my son by my first husband.
You think he is guilty; you are wrong, for he is innocent. You
believe that you will hang him; but I tell you, girl, he will go
free. Read this paper," she said, thrusting an envelope into
the hand of Hagar, "and you will see how you have been
mistaken. I shall never see you again in this life; but I leave my
curse on you!"</p>

<p>Before Hagar could collect her wits, Miss&mdash;or rather
Mrs.&mdash;Lyle, as she called herself, went hurriedly out of the
shop. Her manner was so wild, her words so ominous of evil, that
Hagar had it on her mind to follow her, and, if possible, prevent
the consequences of her despair. She hurried to the door, but Mrs.
Lyle had disappeared, and as there was no one to mind the shop,
Hagar could not go after her. Luckily, at this moment Horval turned
the corner, and at once the girl beckoned to him.</p>

<p>"Miss Lyle&mdash;did you see her?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Horval, with a nod "she's on
her way across Westminster Bridge."</p>

<p>"Oh, follow her&mdash;follow her quickly!" cried
Hagar, wildly, "she is not herself; she is bent on some rash
deed!"</p>

<p>Horval paused a moment in bewilderment; then, grasping the
situation, he turned, without a word, and raced down the street in
the trail of Miss Lyle. Hagar watched his hurrying figure until it
turned the corner; then she retreated to the back parlor, and
hurriedly opened the envelope. On the sheet of paper she found
within the following confession was written:</p>

<p>"I am not a spinster, but a widow," began the
document abruptly&mdash;"a twice-married woman. By my first
husband I had Frederick Jevons, who passes as my nephew, and whom I
love better than my own soul. When my second husband, Mr. Lyle,
died, I cast about for some means of employment, as I was poor.
Mrs. Arryford advertised for an unmarried woman as a companion; she
absolutely refused to have any companion but a spinster. To get the
situation, which was a good one, as Mrs. Arryford was rich, I
called myself Miss Lyle, and obtained the place. Mrs. Arryford had
no relatives and much money, so I schemed to obtain her wealth for
my son, whom I introduced as my nephew. Rosa, the black maid, had a
great deal of influence over her weak-minded mistress, and in some
way&mdash;I don't know how&mdash;she fathomed my purpose. It
was a battle between us, as Rosa was determined that I should not
get the money of Mrs. Arryford for my son. Finally I triumphed, and
Frederick was left sole heir of all the old lady's wealth.
Then Rosa learnt, by eavesdropping, the true relationship between
myself and Frederick. She told her mistress, and with Mrs. Arryford
I had a stormy scene, in which she declared her intention of
revoking her will and turning me and my son out on the world as
paupers. I begged, I implored, I threatened; but Mrs. Arryford,
backed up by that wicked Rosa, was firm. I sent for my son to try
and soften the old lady, but he was not in town, and did not come
to see me till late at night. When he arrived I told him that I had
killed Mrs. Arryford. I did so to prevent her altering her will,
and out of love for my dear son, lest he should lose the money.
Frederick was horrified, and rushed from the house. I believe Rosa
saw me let him out by the side door. I was determined to throw the
blame on Rosa, as I hated her so. Knowing that she coveted the
necklace of amber beads, I stole it from the neck of the dead woman
and gave it to my son next day. I suggested that he should dress up
as Rosa, and pawn the necklace, so that she might be suspected. To
save me, he did so. I obtained a dress that Rosa was fond of
wearing&mdash;yellow silk trimmed with black beads; also the
jewelry of the creature. Frederick blackened his face, and pawned
the beads in a pawn-shop at Lambeth. I sent Rosa on a pretended
errand to Waterloo Station, at the time Frederick was pawning the
beads, so as to get evidence against her that she was in the
neighborhood. Then I suggested to Horval, the detective, that the
beads might have been pawned. He found the shop, and I thought my
plot had succeeded; that Rosa would be condemned and hanged.
Unfortunately, the woman who kept the pawn-shop was clever, and
traced Frederick by means of his mutilated right hand. I hate her!
Frederick is now in prison on a charge of murder, which he did not
commit. I am guilty. I killed Mrs. Arryford. Frederick knows
nothing. He helped me to save myself by trying to throw the blame
on Rosa. All useless. I am guilty, and I am determined that he
shall not suffer for my sin. Officers of the law, I command you to
release my son and arrest me. I am the murderess of Mrs. Arryford.
I swear it."</p>

<p>JULIA LYLE.</p>

<p>"Witnesses:</p>

<p>"Amelia Tyke (housemaid).<br>
"Mark Drew (butler)."</p>

<p>Hagar let the document fall from her hands with a sensation of
pity for the wretched woman.</p>

<p>"How she must love her son," thought the girl,
"to have murdered a kind and good woman for his sake! It is
terrible! Well, I suppose he will now be released and will enter
into possession of the wealth his mother schemed to obtain for him.
But he must do justice to Rosa for all the trouble he has caused
her. He must give her an annuity, and also the necklace of amber
beads, which has been the cause of tracing the crime home to its
door. As for Mrs. Lyle&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment, white and breathless, Horval rushed into the
parlor. Hagar sprang to her feet, and looked anxiously at him,
expectant of bad news. She was right.</p>

<p>"My girl," cried Horval, hoarsely, "Miss Lyle
is dead!"</p>

<p>"Dead? Ah!" said Hagar to herself. "I thought
as much."</p>

<p>"She threw herself over Westminster Bridge, and has just
been picked out of the water&mdash;dead!"</p>

<p>"Dead!" said Hagar again. "Dead!"</p>

<p>"As a door-nail!" replied the detective in a
perplexed tone. "But why&mdash;why did she commit
suicide?"</p>

<p>Hagar sighed, and in silence handed to the detective the
confession of the dead woman.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>Chapter IV<br>
The Third Customer And The Jade Idol</b>
</h2>

<p>HAGAR was a shrewd, clear-headed girl, who, having been educated
in the hard school of Jacob Dix, knew the value of money and the
art of driving good bargains. Otherwise she was uncultured and
uneducated, although, to speak truly, she had a considerable
knowledge of pictures and china, of gems and silverware. But a
schoolboy knew more than she did as regards bookish information.
She was ignorant of geography, as that science had been taught
neither in the gipsy camp nor in the Lambeth pawn-shop. China was
to her&mdash;ware, and not a vast empire of the East. But when the
third customer came to pawn an idol of sea-green jade Hagar learnt
something concerning the Celestial Kingdom.</p>

<p>The man was a sailor, with a coarse face reddened by wind and
salt water, and two twinkling blue eyes, which peered at her
shrewdly from under shaggy eyebrows. He had strong white teeth,
which glistened through a heavy mustache, a head of fair curly
hair, and a heavily-built figure well supported on stalwart legs.
His rough trousers of blue serge, his black pilot jacket with brass
buttons, and his gaudy loose cravat were all redolent of the ocean
wave. Rings of gold in his large red ears added to his queer
aspect; and he rolled into the shop like one to whom the firm earth
is strange after the swinging and pitching of a ship.</p>

<p>This mariner cast uneasy glances over his shoulder as he entered
the shop, and finally swung into one of the sentry boxes like a
vessel coming to anchor. Here he took off his gold-banded cap and
wiped his rough brow with a red handkerchief of Chinese silk.
Hagar, with her hands resting lightly on the counter, waited for
him to speak, and was rather surprised when he still kept silent,
and still continued to glance over his shoulder in the direction of
the door. Finally she lost patience.</p>

<p>"Well, what can I do for you?" she asked
sharply.</p>

<p>The mariner leant across the counter, and spoke in a hoarse
voice like the roaring of waves. "Nathaniel Prime is my name,
miss," he said; almost in a whisper&mdash;"Nat fur
short; and I'm third mate on board a tea ship as trades from
Hong Kong to London's port and back agin."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Prime," said Hagar, as he paused,
"what do you want?"</p>

<p>Nat pulled a small parcel wrapped in a blue check handkerchief
out of his pocket, and plumped it on the counter. "I've
a small article here, miss, as I wants to lodge with you fur safe
keeping."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Hagar, adapting this speech to her own
ideas, "you want to pawn something. What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's Kwan-tai&mdash;that's what it is,
miss."</p>

<p>Hagar drew back. "What gibberish are you talking?"
she asked, frowning.</p>

<p>"Chinese," replied the mariner promptly.
"Kwan-tai is the god of war in China, miss.
This"&mdash;he unrolled the handkerchief and displayed a
particularly ugly idol&mdash;"is his image. I got it from his
temple in the Street of the Water Dragon in Canton. Jest look at
it, miss&mdash;but wait a bit." He rolled back to the door,
stepped out on to the pavement, and looked to right and left.
Apparently he was satisfied with this survey, for with a complacent
whistle he returned to continue the conversation. "I thought
that blamed Chinaman might be arter me," said he, slipping a
plug of tobacco into his capacious mouth; "he'd knife
me like pie to get that d&mdash;d thing there."</p>

<p>"Knife you, man! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Mr. Prime, "this China
d&mdash;&mdash;Yu-ying is his name&mdash;wants to git that there
god; so, as I don't want a bowie exploring my inside, I think
it's good biz to leave it with you fur safe
keeping."</p>

<p>Hagar put down the idol and stepped back. "So you want to
transfer the danger to me?" she said, dryly. "No, thank
you; take that ugly thing away!"</p>

<p>"Now, don't you make any mistake, miss," said
Nat, pushing back the idol in his turn. "Yu-ying don't
know as I'm on this lay. All I wants is to leave Kwan-tai in
this here shop for a week. There ain't no danger in
that."</p>

<p>Hagar picked up the god again and considered. It was a
revoltingly ugly figure carved out of green jade, and had diamonds
for eyes, crossed legs, and two large, fan-like hands resting on a
protuberant stomach. Not a desirable article to possess, save as a
curiosity; but no doubt it had some sacred significance in the
almond eyes of Yu-ying; hence his desire to obtain it, even at the
cost of a man's life. For a moment or two Hagar hesitated as
to taking Kwan-tai in pawn; but as there seemed to be no immediate
danger and might not be any, she resolved to trade. Hagar was so
far Hebraic that she never lost the chance of making a bargain; but
then, according to some folk, the Romany are one of the ten lost
tribes.</p>

<p>"I'll give you thirty shillings on it," she
said, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Thirty bob it is," assented Nat, promptly,
"as all I want is to leave this 'ere idol in your
diggings fur safety. If 'twas pawning, I guess thirty quid
'ud be nearer my price. I reckon that there piece of jade is
worth two hundred pound!"</p>

<p>"I don't know the market value of jade,"
retorted Hagar, impatiently. "All my business with you is to
lend money on the thing. It's thirty shillings or
nothing."</p>

<p>"Don't I tell you it's a deal?" said Mr.
Prime, shifting the quid of tobacco to the other side of his mouth.
"Give us a scratch of the pen to say as you've got
Kwan-tai in charge."</p>

<p>"Name and address?" demanded Hagar, making out the
ticket.</p>

<p>"Nathaniel Prime, mariner, 20, Old Cloe Street,
Docks," said the sailor. "It's a pub, y'
know, miss&mdash;the Nelson. I'll stand you a drink if you
looks me up, and proud to do it fur a slap-up gal like
yourself!"</p>

<p>"Here's the ticket and the money, Mr. Prime. If
that's all your business, get out sharp!"</p>

<p>"Sharp's the word," said the obedient mariner,
slipping the thirty shillings into his pocket; "and if
Yu-ying comes smelling round here, jest you up anchor and steer fur
me at the Nelson. I'm the bad man from the back of beyond
when that heathen's about!"</p>

<p>Mr. Prime nodded in a friendly way to Hagar, and rolled out of
the shop door. She heard him singing a chanty as he left
Carby's Crescent, and it was only when the roar of his lusty
voice died away that she bethought herself of the diamond-eyed
idol. Kwan-tai was a very ugly deity, but curious and attractive in
his way; so, for the furtherance of business, and to see if there
was any truth in Nat's story about Yu-ying, the girl placed
the Chinese god in the shop window. He smiled as complacently
there, out of his almond eyes, amongst the dusty wrecks as formerly
he had beamed on his worshipers in the Street of the Water Dragon
in far Canton.</p>

<p>Now, if there be one vice above another which ruins the female
sex, it is that of curiosity. Here was Hagar told a surprising fact
concerning the idol Kwan-tai, and at once she resolved to test if
Nat's story was true. By putting the jade god in the window,
she afforded Yu-ying a chance of seeing it; and then, if he wanted
to possess the talisman&mdash;as it apparently was&mdash;she
expected that he would enter the shop and offer to purchase it. Not
for a moment did she think that he would kill her, or even attempt
her life. That statement she believed to be an embellishment of
Prime's to adorn his queer story.</p>

<p>"And I don't believe a word of it!" said the
doubting Hagar. "However, the jade idol is exposed in the
shop window, and we will see what will come of it."</p>

<p>Greatly to her surprise, trouble came of her folly, and that
speedily. At noon next day she was eating her simple dinner in the
back parlor with the door leading into the shop open, so that she
might hear the approach of possible customers. Most of the
inhabitants of the Crescent were within doors at the midday meal
and the little square was quite deserted. Suddenly Hagar heard the
crash of glass, and sat paralyzed for the moment in sheer
astonishment at the unusual sound. When she recovered her wits and
the use of her limbs, she ran rapidly into the shop, and beheld the
warning of Nat Prime verified to the letter. The middle pane of the
shop window was broken, and the jade idol was gone. With an
ejaculation of surprise and Hagar sprang to the door, and saw a
blue-bloused figure racing down the narrow street which led to the
thoroughfare.</p>

<p>"The Chinaman! the Chinaman!" cried Hagar, giving
chase. "Thief! stop&mdash;stop&mdash;thief! Yu-ying!
Yu-ying!"</p>

<p>Followed by a crowd, which had collected like magic in answer to
her cries, Hagar sped as lightly as a deer down the alley. But she
was no match for the nimble Chinaman. When she reached the crowded
street, Yu-ying&mdash;as it doubtless was&mdash;could not be seen.
She appealed to the bystanders, to a stolid policeman, to the
cab-drivers; but all to no purpose. Certainly they had seen the
Chinese thief flying out of the Carby Crescent <i>cul-de-sac</i>,
but no one had taken particular notice of him. Hagar ran this way,
that way; looked, questioned, considered; all in vain. Yu-ying had
vanished as though the earth had swallowed him up, and with him the
jade idol of Nat Prime. Blaming herself for her credulity and
headstrong folly in putting Kwan-tai into the window, Hagar
returned crestfallen to the pawn-shop. Having placed a temporary
barricade before the broken pane, and having sent for the glazier
to mend it, Hagar sat down to consider what was to be done relative
to the theft.</p>

<p>Assuredly Prime would return at the end of the week to redeem
the jade god, and Hagar did not know what excuse to make for its
loss. Without doubt, Yu-ying had followed Nat to the shop on the
previous day, and had ascertained the fact of the pawning. He had
watched his opportunity to steal the god, as he evidently preferred
this illegitimate way, to buying it in a proper manner. Probably
Yu-ying, with the astuteness of the Chinese character, guessed that
Hagar could not and would not sell it; hence his raid on the shop
window. However, the idol was gone, and Hagar judged it wise to
advise Nat Prime immediately of the loss. It might be that he knew
the whereabouts of Yu-ying, and could tax him with the theft.
Thinking this the best course to adopt under the circumstances,
Hagar wrote to Prime at the address he had given her. Then she
prepared to receive him, and to make the best of a bad business. In
her letter she made no mention of the theft.</p>

<p>It was two days before Prime appeared in person to answer her
note; and he explained his negligence by stating that he had been
down at Brighton to interview a friend. Then he asked to see the
jade idol, to assure himself that it was safe. When Hagar told him
of its loss, and of Yu-ying's exploit, his rage was
frightful. He swore volubly for ten minutes; and such was his
command of bad language that he scarcely repeated himself in
delivering a string of oaths. In his subsequent conversation it may
be as well to omit these flowers of speech.</p>

<p>"I knew that blamed Chinaman had followed me!" he
said, when somewhat calmer, "if y' mind, miss, I went
to look if the coast wor clear. He must ha' sneaked round the
corner, I guess. Cuss all Celestials, say I!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry the idol is gone, Mr. Prime&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, miss, don's 'ee say another word. How
was a young gal like you to best a Chinky? Why, Yu-ying 'ud
have the teeth out of yer 'ead afore ye cud say
knife!"</p>

<p>"Still, I am to blame," persisted Hagar. "I
should not have put the jade god in the window."</p>

<p>"Winder or no winder, it 'ud have been jest the
same," returned Nat, gloomily; "if Yu-ying hadn't
got the god so easily, he'd have burgled the shop to get it.
Aye, miss, and have cut your throat into the bargain!"</p>

<p>"Why does he want this idol so particularly?"</p>

<p>"Fur the same reason as I do. Fifty thousand pounds is the
reason!"</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand pounds!" echoed Hagar, drawing back:
"the idol isn't worth that!"</p>

<p>"Not in itself, miss; but it kin git that cash. I reckoned
to have it myself, and chuck deep-sea sailing; but now I opines
that blamed John Chinaman's scooped the pool."</p>

<p>"Why don't you look up Yu-ying and tax him with the
theft?"</p>

<p>"He'd only lie, miss; and as fur looking him up, I
guess he's made himself mighty scarce by this time. But
I'll go on the trail, anyhow. Good-day t' ye, miss, and
don't you put trust in them Chinese devils."</p>

<p>After which speech Nat rolled away with a philosophical air,
leaving Hagar very regretful for having contributed to the loss of
the idol by her negligence and perverse folly. All the same, she
did not believe the statement about the fifty thousand pounds. Yet,
as she might have argued, but did not, Nat had told the truth
concerning the desire of Yu-ying to possess the idol, so why should
he not have spoken truly concerning the money? And, after all,
Hagar knew no details likely to confirm the tale. On consideration
she dismissed Nat and Yu-ying and the jade Kwan-tai from her
thoughts, and considered that she had purchased a new experience at
the cost of thirty shillings.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Nat was seated in the taproom of the Nelson,
down the docks way, with a pipe in his mouth and a tankard of beer
before him. For several days he had sat thus alone waiting&mdash;as
would appear from his expectant attitude&mdash;for some visitor.
Four days after the loss of the idol, he was no longer by himself,
for in a chair near him sat a dried-up, alert man clothed in black,
with bright eyes and a keen expression. This individual was a
gentleman&mdash;a doctor&mdash;and the visitor expected by Nat
Prime.</p>

<p>"If y'd on'y come a week ago, I'd not
have pawned the idol," said Nat, in a gloomy tone,
"an' the blamed thing wouldn't have been
lost."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I see, I see. But why did you pawn it?"
asked the doctor, fretfully.</p>

<p>"Why," said Prime, drily, "'cause I
didn't want my throat cut by Yu-ying; as long as I carried
that idol on me, my life wasn't worth a red cent!"</p>

<p>"How did Yu-ying learn the value of the idol?"</p>

<p>"He was a priest in the war-god's temple, I reckon.
I've seed him do joss-pigeon a dozen times; and when he kim
on board the Havelock as stewart I guessed as he wos arter the
idol. But I slept with one eye open," added Nat,
triumphantly, "an' I guess he didn't best me till
I put Kwan-tai into that blamed pop-shop!"</p>

<p>"But I don't see how he gained a knowledge of the
iron box in London," persisted the doctor, irritably,
"or learnt about Poa's treasure."</p>

<p>Prime drank some beer, and leant forward to speak, emphasizing
his remarks by means of his pipe stem. "Now, look'ee
here, Dr. Dick," said he, slowly, "what wos it y'
told me a year ago, afore I went this trip to Chiner?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Dr. Dick, thoughtfully, "I told
you that my uncle had been at the sack of the Summer Palace in
Pekin. Chinese helped to loot the place as well as the French and
English. Among these a priest called Poa collected a number of
small gold images of Kwan-tai to the value of fifty thousand
pounds, and fled with them to England. He placed these in an iron
box, and left it with a countryman of his own in London. After
selling a few of the images he returned to China, and to his
service as a priest in the Temple of Kwan-tai in Canton. He
intended to send for the iron box, and restore the images of the
god to his temple; but, struck down by sickness, he was unable to
carry out his intention. Fearful of being tortured for sacrilege if
he told the truth, Poa wrote in Chinese characters a description of
the whereabouts of the treasure in London, and placed the paper in
the interior of a small jade idol, with diamond eyes, which stood
in the Kwan-tai Temple in the Street of the Water Dragon. My uncle
did some service for Poa, who, out of gratitude, told him the
secret. Shortly afterwards he died, and my uncle, unable to gain
access to the temple and steal the idol, was forced to return to
England. He took up his residence at Christchurch, Hants, and died
there, leaving a paper telling the story of Poa's treasure. I
found the paper two years ago, and knowing you were trading to
Canton, I came up to see you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Prime, taking up the thread of the
story, "and you asked me to get the jade idol out of that
there temple. Well, I stole it, and I believe that pig of a Yu-ying
saw me stealing. Any rate, he turned up aboard of the Havelock, and
somehow&mdash;I can't guess in what way&mdash;he learnt the
whole yarn, and tried to git back the idol. I bested him on the
voyage; and when I kim ashore I expected to find you and get the
iron box right away. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was ill," interrupted Dick, impatiently. "I
couldn't come up. You might have got the treasure yourself
and then shared it with me."</p>

<p>"Now, that's blamed silly, doctor! I couldn't
read the Chinese writing which I found inside the idol; and as
you're a Chinese scholard&mdash;taught by your uncle,
y' said&mdash;I waited fur you to kim up and read it. Fur
safety, I put the idol in the pop-shop, and Yu-ying&mdash;cuss
him&mdash;followed me and stole it. So I guess by this time
he's got the whole lot of the golden gods."</p>

<p>"Probably; but how did he learn that they were in
existence, and that the production of the jade idol was necessary
to obtain the treasure of Poa?"</p>

<p>"Can't say, sir, onless that Poa told some of his
brother priests."</p>

<p>"Poa died fifteen years ago," replied Dick, sharply;
"if he had told them on his death-bed, they would not have
waited all this time to get the treasure."</p>

<p>"Well, I calc'late as they've annexed the same
this trip," said Nat, coolly.</p>

<p>While thus conversing, the landlord of the Nelson entered the
tap-room, and informed Prime that a lady wished to see him. Rather
surprised&mdash;for he had few female friends&mdash;Nat instructed
that the visitor should be admitted. In a moment or so she appeared
on the threshold, and, to his still greater surprise, Nat beheld
Hagar.</p>

<p>"'Tis the pop-shop gal!" he said, rising.
"And what might you want, miss?"</p>

<p>"To restore to you the jade idol," replied Hagar,
taking the god Kwan-tai out of her pocket.</p>

<p>"Glory alleluia!" shouted Nat, snatching it from her
grasp. "How the creation did you git it?"</p>

<p>"When I opened the shop door this morning, it was hanging
to the knob by a string."</p>

<p>"Yu-ying couldn't make anything out of it, I guess.
Here, doctor, see if the paper's inside."</p>

<p>Dick, in a state of considerable excitement, having been
previously instructed by his uncle's paper how to discover
the secret, unscrewed the head of the idol. When removed, a cavity
was revealed; inside the cavity a strip of rice paper, scrawled
with Chinese characters in vermilion.</p>

<p>While he was deciphering these, Nat turned to Hagar.</p>

<p>"Thankee, miss," he said, graciously. "If we
git the money, I'll give 'ee a pound or so."</p>

<p>"I don't want it," replied Hagar, abruptly.
"Give me the pawn-ticket and thirty-one shillings&mdash;that
is, what I gave you, and the percentage. Then I'll
go."</p>

<p>Nat produced money and ticket from his pocket, and gave them
into her hand. "But I'd like to do summat fur you
gitting that idol back," said he, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Prime," said Hagar, pausing at the door,
with a smile, "when you get the fifty thousand pounds you
talk about, reward me by coming to the shop, and telling me the
story. I should like to know why Yu-ying stole the god; also why he
restored it."</p>

<p>"I'll tell 'ee, never fear, miss; and a rum
yarn it is. Y' won't take a drain, miss? No? Well, good
day! good day, and thankee."</p>

<p>When Hagar retired Nat came back to the table, and found that
Dr. Dick had ascertained the meaning of the Chinese characters.
They gave the address of one Yeh, who kept an opium shop&mdash;or
rather den&mdash;in Vesey Street, Whitechapel.</p>

<p>"We must go there," said Dick, rising, "and
interview this Yeh. I dare say he has the iron box in
charge."</p>

<p>"I guess some Chinky of sorts has the box," assented
Nat, "but 'twon't be Yeh. If Poa lef' the
box along o' him, I surmise he's dead and buried by
this time. Even Chinamen ain't immortal."</p>

<p>"Yeh or another&mdash;what does it matter, Prime? All we
have to do is to show Kwan-tai's jade image to the custodian
of the box, and it will be handed over to us."</p>

<p>"That's so," replied Nat, glancing at his
watch. "Seems as we've got the whole arternoon to
engineer the job. Let's grub a bit, and start right away for
Whitechapel."</p>

<p>While at the meal, Prime seemed thoughtful, and did not respond
very enthusiastically to Dr. Dick's delight at discovering
the whereabouts of the treasure. Dick commented on this.</p>

<p>"You don't seem over-pleased, Nat," he said;
in a piqued tone, "yet your share will be twenty-five
thousand pounds; and you ought to be both contented and delighted.
What's your trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yu-ying, doctor. I don't trust that heathen a cent.
What did he give back the jade god for?"</p>

<p>"Because he couldn't find the secret of opening
it," replied Dick; "and seeing that the image was no
good, he restored it to its proper owner."</p>

<p>Nat shook his head. "As a priest of the temple, Yu-ying is
the proper owner of that there god," said he, doubtfully.
"I stole it, y' know, so 'twasn't mine; not
much. No, doctor; there's something queer about the biz.
Guess this Chinky's rubbin' it in with salt."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Nat?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Mr. Prime, coolly,
"'twouldn't surprise me to find as how Yu-ying
has lifted the lot of them gods of gold, and he's sent back
Kwan-tai so as we kin take a squint at the empty box. It 'ud
be like a Chiner d&mdash;l to play low in that style."</p>

<p>"I hope not, I trust not!" cried Dick, turning pale.
"But we had better make certain of what has been done. Come,
Nat; let us start for Whitechapel at once."</p>

<p>Still shaking his head, for a long acquaintance with Chinamen
had inspired him with a wholesome mistrust of the race, Nat paid
his bill, and set out for Whitechapel in the company of Dr.
Dick.</p>

<p>"You take my word for it, doctor," said he, when
they were in the train, "there's a big sell waiting for
us at the end of this trip. I guess 'twasn't honesty
has made that Celestial give back the jade idol."</p>

<p>On arriving at Whitechapel, the two adventurers had some
difficulty in discovering Vesey Street; and it was quite an hour
before they ascertained its whereabout. It proved to be a narrow
and dirty alley of no great length, midway in which was placed the
dwelling of Yeh. A red-painted sign, sprinkled with golden Chinese
characters, announced that the house was "the Abode of a
Hundred Blessings," and that Yeh was a dealer in goods from
the Flowery Land. Dick translated this for the benefit of Nat, who
could speak but not read Chinese, and commented thereon.</p>

<p>"Either the original Yeh is in existence, or this is a son
of his," he said, and on Nat grunting assent they both
stopped at the door of the house which they fondly hoped contained
the treasure of Poa, the golden idols of the Imperial dynasty of
T'sin.</p>

<p>In answer to their knock, a sleek, soft-footed China-boy,
dressed in a blue indigo-hued blouse and with his pigtail down,
appeared to admit them. Nat, as more experienced in Chinese speech,
explained that they wanted to see Yeh. After some hesitation, the
boy conducted them through a long dark passage into a rather large
room piled up with goods, amongst which moved three or four
Chinamen. These packages were the ostensible reason of Yeh's
business; but at the back of the shop, through another dark
passage, there was an opium den. The boy spoke to a spectacled
Chinese merchant about the two Englishmen, whereupon he came
forward and addressed them in his own tongue.</p>

<p>"What can your vile slave do for the lords who honor his
despicable house?" asked the suave Celestial, with all the
flowery humbug of Chinese speech. Nat, conversant with such
rhodomontade, replied in a similar fashion. "Your humble
guests would see the learned and respectable Yeh."</p>

<p>"He is my worshipful father," said the Chinaman,
with a bow. "And what would the gracious lords with the
reverend Yeh?"</p>

<p>For answer, Nat pulled the jade idol out of his pocket; at the
sight of which the son of Yeh went as green as the god's
image. Down he fell on his knees and knocked his forehead three
times on the floor; after which, without wasting time in
explanation, he conducted the two Europeans into the opium den.
Here, on a kind of elevated platform, and under the smiling face of
a particularly ugly Joss, sat Yeh, the merchant, a very old and
wrinkled man. He wore heavy spectacles with tortoiseshell rims;
also a thickly-wadded blouse of red silk embroidered elaborately in
gold thread. Like his son, he was likewise greatly struck by the
sight of jade Kwan-tai, and, like him, made genuflections.</p>

<p>"The learned Poa was my much-esteemed friend," he
said, bowing to the Europeans; "with me he left an iron box,
to be delivered to him who showed me the image of the mighty
war-god. But Poa did not say that the sacred jade god would be
shown twice!"</p>

<p>"Oho!" cried Dick, in disgust.
"Yu-ying!"</p>

<p>"You know the name, I see," said Yeh, a trifle
grimly; "this priest of the temple in the Street of the Water
Dragon is your much-admired friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" said Nat, eagerly; "we gave him
the jade god so that he should come and look at the iron box of
Poa; but we did not tell him to take it away."</p>

<p>"He obeyed your commands, my lord," replied Yeh,
rising stiffly; "he looked at the box, but he did not take it
away."</p>

<p>Dr. Dick jumped up with a cry of relief and delight. "Then
the box is here!" he said, in excited tones. "Take us
to see it at once!"</p>

<p>"It waits your noble presence in another room."</p>

<p>So speaking, Yeh, followed by the anxious adventurers, passed
through a little door into a kind of strong room, dimly lighted by
a small grated window. In a corner, towards which the old Chinaman
pointed, there was a large iron box painted black, upon the lid of
which were inscribed some Chinese characters in white paint. From a
nail above this Yeh took a small copper key, and presented it to
Dick with a bow. Then he turned to go, "My lords can look at
Poa's secret alone," said he, backing with many bows to
the door. "Who am I that I should meddle with the business of
those favored by Kwan-tai?"</p>

<p>On being left alone, the two men looked at one another in some
surprise and a little doubt. "The job's been easier
than I thought," said Nat, after a pause. "All the
same, I guess as Yu-ying's got some trick to play
us."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" replied Dick, going on his knees
before the box. "Here is the key, and within, no doubt, we
shall find the golden gods of T'sin."</p>

<p>"Well," said Nat, with a nod, "if
everything's square, I'll never cuss a heathen Chinee
again. Open the box, doctor."</p>

<p>The key turned easily in the lock, and Dick flung back the lid.
In an instant a flare of fire spouted out with a great roar. The
two men, the room, and the greater part of Yell's dwelling
were blown to shreds. They had expected to find a fortune, instead
of which they discovered dynamite and a terrible death.</p>

<p>Two months after this, when London had almost forgotten the
mysterious explosion in Vesey Street, Whitechapel, a Chinaman was
reporting himself to the priests of Kwan-tai's temple,
Canton, in this fashion:</p>

<p>"Most holy men," said he, pointing to a number of
golden images which lay on a lacquer table before him, "here
are the images of Kwan-tai, the gods of the Imperial House of
T'sin, brought back from the dark land of the Outer
Barbarians by your servant Yu-ying. When your greatnesses found the
confession of the evil priest Poa that he had stolen the gods, and
had confided the secret of their whereabouts to the jade image of
Kwan-tai, you ordered your unworthy slave to search and find the
treasure, so that it should be restored to the temple in the Street
of the Water Dragon. But before your servant could depart to the
Land of Darkness, a foreign devil, also possessed of Poa's
secret, stole the jade image which contained the name of the
hiding-place. I, foolish Yu-ying, followed the barbarian in a
tea-junk to his own land; but it was many days before I could get
the jade image. Then the foreign devil pawned for gold the sacred
idol of war, and it was placed in the window of the shop. I broke
the window, most reverend priests; I stole the image, and going to
the house of Yeh, I recovered the golden idols which are now before
you. But I wished to punish Yeh for his sacrilege in conspiring
with Poa against Kwan-tai; and also to kill the foreign devil who
had thieved the jade god. To this end I removed the golden idols
from the box, and in their place I left a dangerous powder of the
barbarians, which they call dynamite. This I arranged with care so
that when the lid of the box was flung open it would rush out like
the breath of the Fire Dragon, and slay those who came to steal the
gods. As I intended, holy ones, so it happened, as I have learnt
since. The foreign devil and a friend were shattered, and also the
house of Yeh was destroyed. It was for this end that I restored the
idol Kwan-tai to the pawn-shop; and thus did I lure the foreign
devils to their deaths. Now, no one knows the truth, mighty
servants of Kwan-tai, save yourselves. Say, have I done
well?"</p>

<p>And all the sleek priests answered with one voice:
"Yu-ying, you have done well. Your tablet shall be placed in
the temple of Kwan-tai."</p>

<p>And while this explanation was being made, Hagar, in far-off
London, was waiting for the return of Nat Prime to hear the story
of the jade idol. But he never appeared.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="V" id="V"></a>Chapter V<br>
The Fourth Customer And The Crucifix</b>
</h2>

<p>MENTION has been made of Bolker, the misshapen imp, who was
Hagar's factotum and the plague of her life. With her clear
brain and strong will, she could manage most people, but not this
deformed street arab, whose nature seemed to be compounded of all
that was worst in human beings. He lied freely, he absented himself
from the shop when he had no business to do so, he even stole
little things, when he thought it was safe to run the risk with so
vigilant a mistress; but, notwithstanding all these vices, Hagar
kept him as servant. Her reason was that he possessed three
redeeming virtues: he was an excellent watch-dog, he was admirable
at clinching bargains, and he was cunning enough not to lose his
situation. Clever servants have been retained by mistrustful
mistresses for less reasonable qualities.</p>

<p>When Hagar went out on business&mdash;which she frequently
did&mdash;Bolker stayed to look after the shop, and to receive such
customers as might present themselves. To these he gave as little
as he possibly could on the articles they wished to pawn; and when
Hagar returned he had usually some tales to tell of excellent
business having been transacted for the good of the shop. Then
Hagar would reward him with a little money and Bolker would take
unauthorized leave to misconduct himself generally on the proceeds.
This program never varied.</p>

<p>One day Hagar returned late in the evening, having been in the
country on an excursion connected with a copper key. This adventure
will be related another time, for the present story deals with the
strange episode of the silver crucifix. It was this article which
Bolker had ready to show Hagar when she entered the pawn-shop at
eight o'clock.</p>

<p>"See here, missus!" said Bolker, pointing to the
wall at the back of the shop; "there's a fine thing I
got for you&mdash;cheap!"</p>

<p>It may be here remarked that Bolker had been to school, and
having a remarkably clever brain as a set-off against his deformed
body, he had succeeded in gaining a certain amount of learning, and
also a mode of speaking, as regards both diction and accent, much
above the ordinary conversation of his class. Proud of this
superiority, the clever imp spoke always slowly and to the point,
so that he might preserve his refined speech.</p>

<p>"Dirt cheap, missus!" added Bolker, who used vulgar
words when excited, and he was so now. "Ten pound I lent on
it; the silver itself is worth more than that!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can always trust your judgment in these
matters," laughed Hagar, and took down the crucifix to
examine it more particularly.</p>

<p>It was over a foot long, made of refined silver now somewhat
tarnished from neglect and exposure to the air; and the workmanship
was peculiarly fine and delicate. The figure of the Christ crowned
with a thorn-wreath was exquisite; and the arms of the cross
itself, enchased with arabesque patterns, were beyond all praise
from an artistic point of view. Altogether, this silver crucifix,
obtained by the crafty Bolker for ten pounds&mdash;a sum greatly
below its real value&mdash;was a remarkably fine sample of
Renaissance workmanship in the style of Cellini. Learned in such
things, Hagar, even in the yellow glow of the badly lighted lamp,
saw its magnificence and worth at a glance. She patted
Bolker's red head of hair with approval.</p>

<p>"Good little man!" said she, in a pleased tone.
"You always do well when I am out of the shop. There is
half-a-crown. Go and enjoy yourself, but don't make yourself
sick with smoking a pipe as you did last time, my boy But one
moment," she added; "who pawned this?"</p>

<p>"Gemma Bardi, 167, Saffron Hill."</p>

<p>"An Italian woman. Like enough, as the crucifix is of the
Renaissance," said Hagar, musingly. "What was she like,
Bolker?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a fine, handsome girl," replied Bolker, leering
in a man-about-town style; "black hair and eyes the same just
like yours, missus, only I guess you're the finer woman of
the two. Here&mdash;don't you box my ears," shouted the
imp, wriggling out of Hagar's grip, "or I shan't
tell you what I found out!"</p>

<p>"About this crucifix?" asked Hagar, dropping her
hands.</p>

<p>"Yes. 'Tain't a crucifix; it's a
dagger."</p>

<p>"A dagger, you young fool! What are you
talking?"</p>

<p>"Sense, missus&mdash;as I always do. Look here, if you
don't believe me."</p>

<p>Bolker took the presumed crucifix in his lean, small hands, and
with deft fingers he touched a concealed spring set where the four
arms of the cross joined. At once the lower and longer arm, with
the silver Christ attached thereto, slid down, and lo! the cross
was changed into a slender and, sharp-pointed poniard, the handle
of which was formed by the upper arms and the, so to speak, haft of
the cross. The symbol of Christ, of peace, of faith, had become a
deadly and dangerous weapon of bloodshed. Hagar was so startled
that Bolker, the discoverer, grinned.</p>

<p>"It's fine, ain't it?" he said, gloating
over the shining blade. "It would stick a man like fun! I
dare say it's been through lots. My eye, what
larks!"</p>

<p>The joy of the boy was so grim and unnatural that Hagar snatched
the crucifix&mdash;or rather the poniard, as it was now&mdash;from
his grasp, and pushed him out of the shop with the sharp command
that he was to put up the shutters. When he had done so, and all
was safe for the night, he went away to enjoy himself with his
half-crown; while Hagar carried the newly-pawned article into the
back parlor to examine it anew, as she ate her frugal supper. The
crucifix, which was at once a symbol of peace and war attracted her
strangely.</p>

<p>Why did it possess these dual characteristics? To what end had
its maker placed in the hands of priests this deadly and concealed
weapon? The hands of the Christ were not attached to the cross
bars; and the sheath&mdash;as it might be&mdash;of the poniard
slipped easily off the blade, figure and all. Hagar wondered in her
imaginative fashion if it had glimmered, a symbol of Christianity
over the dying, or had flashed cruelty into the heart of some
helpless human being. From the old bookseller in Carby's
Crescent she had heard some strange stories of the Italian
Renaissance&mdash;that wild and contradictory time. Religion had
then gone hand in hand with paganism; Savonarola had grown up
beside the Medici; Popes had decreed peace, and had plunged whole
nations in war; and the laugh of a friend had oftentimes been but a
prelude to the death-blow. Of this many-sided, sinful epoch the
crucifix dagger was a symbol; it represented at once its art, its
religion, and its lust of blood. Hagar evoked strange visions in
her dingy parlor from that strange piece of silver.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in the imperative demands of business, Hagar forgot
her dreams about the crucifix, and looked upon it as an article of
value merely pawned by its owner, and which would be redeemed in
due time. A month later the ticket made out in the name of Gemma
Bardi was brought to her by a man of the same nationality. This
tall, slender, supple Italian, with oval olive face and fierce eyes
had come to take the crucifix out of pawn. Although he produced the
ticket and offered the money, Hagar hesitated at giving the article
to him.</p>

<p>"It was pawned by Gemma Bardi," said she, taking
down the crucifix from where it hung in the obscurity.</p>

<p>"My wife," replied the man, briefly.</p>

<p>"She sent you to redeem it?"</p>

<p>"<i>Gran Dio!</i> Why not?" he broke out,
impetuously. "I am Carlino Bardi, her husband. She pawned the
crucifix against my will, while I was absent in the country with my
organ. Now that I have returned, I come with ticket and money to
redeem it. I do not wish to lose the Crucifix of
Fiesole."</p>

<p>"The Crucifix of Fiesole," repeated
Hagar&mdash;"is that what it is called?"</p>

<p>"Of a surety, signorina; and it is worth much
money."</p>

<p>"More than ten pounds, I am sure," said Hagar,
smiling, as she picked up the note silently placed on the counter
by Carlino. "Well, I have no right to refuse you the
crucifix. You give me the ticket, principal, and interest, so all
is legal and shipshape. Take up your cross."</p>

<p>"My cross!" echoed Carlino, with a flash from his
big eyes. "Gemma is my cross."</p>

<p>"Your wife! That is a strange way to speak of one dear to
you."</p>

<p>"Dear to me, signorina! That may be; but she is dear also
to Pietro Neri. May the pains of hell seize him!"</p>

<p>"Why? What has he done?"</p>

<p>"Run away with Gemma," said Bardi, fiercely.
"Oh, she went cheerfully enough. To get the money for my
dishonor she pawned the crucifix."</p>

<p>"Oh. So she did not send you to redeem it?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Carlino, with tranquil insolence.
"That was a lie I told to get back my property without
trouble. But now it is mine"&mdash;he clasped the silver
Christ convulsively to his breast. "I shall make Gemma and
Pietro pay for their evil deed!"</p>

<p>"You speak English well for a foreigner."</p>

<p>"I ought to," answered the man, indifferently.
"I have been ten years in England, and I have almost
forgotten my Tuscan tongue. But I remember still what Tuscan
husbands do to faithless women and their paramours. We kill
them!"&mdash;his voice leaped an octave to a shrill scream of
wrath&mdash;"we kill the man and the woman!"</p>

<p>Thrilled by the terrible hatred of this passionate Latin nature,
Hagar started back. The man was leaning across the counter, and
showed no disposition to depart; nor did she want him to leave her,
for there had come upon her a desire to learn the history of the
Fiesole crucifix. Bending forward, she touched it lightly with the
tips of her fingers.</p>

<p>"How did this come into your possession?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I stole it from a painter in Florence."</p>

<p>"You stole it!" echoed Hagar, confounded by the
frankness of this admission.</p>

<p>"Yes. I was the model of an artist&mdash;one Signor
Ancillotti, who had a studio in Piazza San Spirito, hard by the
Ponte Santa Trinita of the Arno. This crucifix hung in his rooms,
and once, when I was posing as his model, he told me the legend
which gave it the name of the Crucifix of Fiesole. It was the story
which made me steal it."</p>

<p>"But why? What is the story?"</p>

<p>"A common one," said Bardi,
bitterly&mdash;"man's love and a woman's
faithlessness to her husband There was a silversmith in Florence,
what time the Magnificent ruled, who was called Guido. He had one
fair wife whom he loved very dearly. She did not care for his love,
however, and fled with a young Count of good family, one Luigi da
Francia. From France, you understand, for from that country the
race had come to Florence in the days of the Republic. Luigi was
handsome and rich; Guido, ugly and rather poor, although a clever
craftsman; so you cannot wonder that the wife&mdash;Bianca was her
name&mdash;fled from the one's arms to the other's
palace. Guido determined upon revenge, and manufactured this
crucifix."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more did any one else," said Bardi, cutting her
short. "When Guido finished the crucifix he disguised himself
as a priest, and went up to see Count Luigi in his palace at
Fiesole. Afterwards the nobleman and Bianca were found dead with
dagger thrusts in their hearts, and Guido was missing. Between the
corpses lay this silver crucifix; but no one ever knew how they
died."</p>

<p>"Why not? Guido killed them with his dagger."</p>

<p>"No," said Bardi, shaking his head. "Guido had
no dagger with him at the time. Count Luigi was always afraid of
assassination, for he had many enemies; and every visitor was
searched by his retainers to see that they carried no concealed
weapons. Guido, the supposed priest, was searched also, and had
nothing on him but the silver crucifix. So the legend grew that
whosoever had a faithless wife, the possession of the Crucifix of
Fiesole would give him power to slay her and her lover, as Guido
had slain his two deceivers. Therefore," added Bardi, grimly,
"as I had then married Gemma, and thought that some day she
might be faithless, I stole the crucifix from Signor Ancillotti. It
seems I was right to do so."</p>

<p>"A strange story," said Hagar, meditatively
"and stranger still that the means by which Guido slew were
not discovered long ago."</p>

<p>"Do you know how he killed them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. By means of that crucifix."</p>

<p>Bardi looked at the cross eagerly, and a lurid light came into
his eyes as he gazed. "How?" he questioned, loudly.
"Tell me, signorina."</p>

<p>But Hagar refused to impart that knowledge.</p>

<p>The story of the man deserted by his wife was so similar to that
of the faithless Bianca and the forsaken Guido that Hagar dreaded
lest Bardi should learn the secret of the concealed dagger and
repeat the Cinque de Cento tragedy of Fiesole. With this idea in
her mind she wished the Italian to depart, ignorant of the devilish
ingenuity of the cross. But Fate willed that in her despite Bardi
should gain the evil knowledge. He learnt it forthwith from the
lips of Bolker.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" cried that imp, as he entered the shop, to
see Carlino holding the crucifix. "You have got that
dagger?"</p>

<p>"Dagger!" said Bardi, with a start.</p>

<p>"Bolker, you wretched child, hold your tongue!" said
Hagar, vehemently.</p>

<p>"Why should I? My tongue's my own, and if that cove
wants to know how this crucifix can be changed into a dagger,
it's only fair. See here!" and before Hagar could
interfere Bolker had the cross in his hands, and a finger on the
spring. "You touch this, and the lower part
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Bardi, snatching back the cross, and
examining the deadly mechanism. "I see now how Guido killed
his enemies. Gemma does not know of this; Pietro is ignorant; but
they shall learn&mdash;both. I&mdash;I, the betrayed husband, shall
teach it to them."</p>

<p>"Bardi!" said Hagar, catching him by the arm,
"do not take&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is mine&mdash;mine!" he interrupted, furiously.
"I go to search for the evil ones! I go to put the Crucifix
of Fiesole to the use for which it was created by Guido! Look in
the papers, signorina, and sooner or later you will see again the
tale of Luigi, of Bianca, of the deceived Guido!"</p>

<p>He tore his sleeve from her grip, and rushed furiously from the
shop, racing out of the crescent into the crowded streets, wherein
he was soon lost. Hagar ran to the door, but could not stop his mad
career; so all she could do was to rage at Bolker, the
mischief-maker, who, comprehending nothing of the Italian's
excitement, was standing open-mouthed in the shop.</p>

<p>"You imp! You goblin!" raged Hagar, boxing his large
ears. "You have put murder into that man's
head!"</p>

<p>"Murder!" repeated Bolker, dodging her slaps,
"what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The man's wife has deceived him. He'll kill
her with that dagger!"</p>

<p>"Jiminy!" said the imp, a light breaking in on his
brain. "Kill her with a crucifix! What a rum murder it will
be! I'll keep my eye on the papers, you bet!"</p>

<p>After which speech he ran out of the shop to escape further
punishment, while Hagar was left to bewail the perverse fate which
had sent the talkative lad to Bardi at so critical a moment.
However, it was not her fault that he had gained the fatal
knowledge; nor could it be laid to her charge if he did use the
crucifix-dagger to kill Gemma and Pietro. Salving her conscience
thus, Hagar waited for the consummation of the tragedy, and daily,
as advised by the Italian, she read the papers to see if it
occurred. But for many weeks nothing came of her reading, and Hagar
concluded that either the man had not found his wife, or, having
found her, had condoned her offense against his honor. Which
conclusion showed how little Hagar knew of the fierce and
passionate Tuscan nature.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Bardi, his heart filled with vengeful hatred,
was tracking his runaway wife and her lover with dogged
persistence. The cost of his travels was little, as his profession
was that of an organ-grinder, and with his box of music he could
earn his livelihood on the road. Whither they had gone he did not
learn for a long time; but at length he ascertained definitely that
the pair were in the southern counties of England. Pietro was an
organ-man also; and with Gemma was now no doubt tramping from
village to village, earning a pittance. The ten pounds obtained for
the crucifix would not last forever, and then the pair would be
reduced to gain a livelihood by the organ. Bardi cursed both, as he
thought of them living together; and felt that the silver cross was
safe in his breast when he started on their trail. With that
infernal weapon of Guido's he intended to kill those who had
deceived him, and repeat in the nineteenth century the wild tragedy
of Fiesole.</p>

<p>For some weeks he saw nothing of the couple, but from sundry
sources he discovered their whereabouts. Yet as soon as he arrived
in some town or village where he had been advised of their presence
he would learn that they had departed in some unknown direction.
Whether they knew, or did not know, that he was tracking them,
Bardi could not say; but certainly at many times when just within
his reach they would elude him in the most exasperating fashion.
Any one less bent upon revenge would have given up the task; but,
sustained by undying hatred, Carlino followed the weary trail with
the persistence of a bloodhound. As soon might the twain expect to
escape death as to elude the betrayed husband, the deceived
friend.</p>

<p>It was at Daleminster that he found them, and revenged himself
on the infidelity of the one, the treason of the other. Daleminster
is a quiet, desolate cathedral town, very quaint, very beautiful,
set in the very heart of Midland cornfields, and made up of ancient
red-roofed houses which cluster round the great minster of Saint
Wulf's. There it rises, a poem in stone, with its great
central tower soaring into the misty blue of English skies; and its
magnificent facade carved with saints, and angels, and grotesque
faces of peering devils&mdash;a strange medley of Heaven and hell.
Before it, extends a little square, in the center of which rises an
ancient cross sculptured with religious imagery. It was near this
relic of medieval piety that Carlino saw his wife.</p>

<p>The day was dull and rainy&mdash;April weather, of storm, with
occasional bursts of sunshine. In that desolate and forsaken
square, where the grass sprang greenly betwixt worn stones, Gemma,
in the gay colors of her Neapolitan garb, stood grinding Italian
melodies out of the organ. Pietro was not with her, and Carlino
wondered for a moment if he had deserted her, now that the moneys
obtained for the silver crucifix were expended. The woman appeared
sad and lamentable enough as she looked to right and left in the
hope of gaining stray coppers. The melancholy music of "Ah,
che la morte" was sighing forth in the damp air, when her
wandering gaze alighted suddenly on the man she had betrayed. With
folded arms Bardi looked at her as the music faltered and stopped;
but for the time being he said nothing. Nor did the woman; she was
as petrified as any of the grim and saintly statues which looked
down upon them both.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" demanded Bardi, in the Italian
tongue.</p>

<p>Gemma put her hand to the necklace of blue beads dangling from
her brown throat, and strove to speak. Her face was set and white,
her lips were dry with fear, and she could only stare at Carlino
with terrified eyes. The man came a step nearer and laid a
persuasive hand on her white linen sleeve. She shuddered and drew
away.</p>

<p>"Where is your lover?" demanded Bardi, in silky
tones. "Has he left you?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied, hoarsely, finding her voice at
last. "He is ill."</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;in this town?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He caught cold; it settled on his lungs; he is very
ill."</p>

<p>Gemma uttered these staccato sentences in a mechanical manner,
as though compelled to do so against her will, under the mesmeric
gaze of the man. The unexpected appearance of Bardi stunned and
appalled her; she could not think what to do; her brain refused to
act. At length a request made by Carlino released her from the
mesmeric spell which enchanted and froze her.</p>

<p>"Lead me to him," said he, in a quiet way. "I
wish to see him."</p>

<p>Gemma felt the blood rush from her heart to her face, and sprang
back with a loud cry, which echoed through the lonely square and
down the desolate streets.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" she cried, vehemently. "You will
kill him!"</p>

<p>"Why? I have not killed you, and you are the guiltier of
the two. Pietro was my very good friend until you tempted him with
your beauty. Kill Pietro!"&mdash;the man laughed in a jeering
manner&mdash;"woman, I have let you live."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hate you! I hate you!" said Gemma, drawing
her black brows together, and sending a flash at him from her
somber eyes. "I love Pietro!"</p>

<p>"I know you do. So much that you left me for him, and
pawned the silver Christ of Fiesole to pay for the
journey."</p>

<p>"I left the pawn-ticket behind," she muttered,
sullenly.</p>

<p>"I know it. Here is the crucifix!" and with that
Bardi drew it from his bosom to hold it before her eyes. She shrank
back before the symbol of faith, and uttered a low cry, at which
her husband jeered.</p>

<p>"<i>Dio!"</i> said he, scoffingly. "You have
religion still, I see; yet I thought you would have finished with
such things when you were base enough to leave me. Why did you sell
the crucifix and fly, Gemma? Did I beat you, or starve
you?"</p>

<p>"You would not let me have money!" cried Gemma,
dashing the tears from her eyes; "whenever I wanted a ribbon
or a silver brooch you refused to give me a single
<i>soldo."</i></p>

<p>"And why?" was the swift answer. "Because I
was saving all, that we could go back to Italy and buy a little
vineyard near my own village&mdash;near Lastra-a-Signa. There is
one I know of at Mosciano, which my father wrote and told me was
for sale at a small price. I have the money now, and I intended to
tell you of it; but I came back to find that you had fled with that
infamous Pietro."</p>

<p>Gemma sobbed. Like most women, she had a practical side to her
character, and the vineyard would have been a little heaven to her,
setting aside the joy of returning to Signa. She would not have
fled had she known of these plans, as she had not loved Pietro
overmuch. Besides, he beat her, now that the money was gone; and
they earned very little by the organ. It was horrible to think that
she had lost all, for a few months of illicit love.</p>

<p>"O Carlino, forgive me!" she moaned, stretching out
her arms.</p>

<p>"Lead me to Pietro and I shall see," he replied, and
took her organ&mdash;or rather Pietro's&mdash;on his strong
shoulders.</p>

<p>Without a word, Gemma led the way out of the square, down
tortuous streets into a poor part of the town. She was afraid of
Carlino, and could not quite understand what he intended to do to
Pietro. Probably he would kill him; and then he would be arrested
and hanged. But then the money would come to her, and she would
have all the vineyard to herself. Again, Carlino might forgive
Pietro, and take her back. Gemma was a clever woman, and trusted to
extricate herself out of all difficulties by her wiles. Still, she
knew Carlino's violent temper, and she dreaded the worst. At
the door of the poor house where she lived with her lover she
stopped, and faced Bardi with a resolute air.</p>

<p>"Pietro is within," she said, hurriedly, "ill
in bed; but I shan't take you to him unless you swear that
you intend him no harm."</p>

<p>"I swear by this crucifix!" said Bardi, thinking of
it as a dagger and not as a cross.</p>

<p>"Have you a knife on you?" demanded Gemma, still
doubtful.</p>

<p>"No," smiled Bardi, thinking how the old Fiesole
tragedy was repeating itself. "I have nothing with me but
this crucifix." Then, as she still seemed dubious, he added:
"You can see for yourself if you like."</p>

<p>Not knowing what to make of this smiling complacency, so
different to his usual stern demeanor, Gemma passed her hands
through his clothes to feel if he had any weapon concealed therein.
Her fears were groundless. Bardi wore little clothing, and she
assured herself beyond all doubt that he was unarmed; he had
nothing wherewith to kill Pietro. Certainly he might strangle him
with his bare hands; but that was not the Tuscan fashion of
disposing of a rival. Perhaps, after all, he meant to forgive
Pietro.</p>

<p>"You see," said Carlino, when her arms dropped,
"I am unarmed; I have nothing with me save this silver
crucifix. As Pietro is so ill he may like to look at it."</p>

<p>His look as he said this was hardly pleasant, and a glimpse of
it might have put the woman on her guard; but it was lost on her,
as already she had turned her back, and was climbing the crazy
stairs. Bardi followed her, carrying the organ on his broad back,
and holding in his two hands the silver crucifix, like some priest
bearing the Host to the dying. Gemma conducted him into a bare
garret on the topmost story. Here Carlino put down the organ and
looked around.</p>

<p>In a corner near the window Pietro, wild-looking, with his
unshaven beard of a week's growth, lay on a pile of straw
roughly covered with some pieces of coarse sacking. He was
emaciated and haggard about the face, and his skin was flushed red
with the burning of the fever which consumed him. At times a dry
hacking cough would echo through the bleak room, and the man would
fall back on the poor bed in a paroxysm of pain. Clearly he was
very ill, as Gemma had said, and not long for this world; knowledge
that he was dying did not move Carlino's determination. He
had come hither to slay Pietro with the crucifix, and he was bent
upon executing his purpose.</p>

<p>"Carlino!" cried the sick man, raising himself on
one elbow with a look of mingled terror and surprise. "You
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gemma, moving towards her lover;
"he has come to forgive you and to take me back."</p>

<p>"That is so," answered Bardi, raising the crucifix
aloft. "I swear by this cross. Dear Pietro," he added,
moving towards the bed, "I know you were tempted
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep off! Keep off!" screamed Neri, shrinking back.
"Liar! you have come to kill me. I see it in your
eyes!"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Gemma, soothingly; "he has no
weapon."</p>

<p>"None, my wife!" echoed Bardi, touching the spring
of the cross&mdash;"only this dagger!" and Gemma saw
the silver Christ fall on the floor, while the cross which had
borne Him remained, a poniard, in the right hand of her deceived
husband. With a cry of horror, she flung herself on the sick
man.</p>

<p>"Me first! Me first!"</p>

<p>"No! You later!" cried Bardi, dragging her off
"This for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Carlino!" shrieked Neri, as the dagger flashed
downward&mdash;"for the love of&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest of the cry ended in a gurgle, as a stream of blood
burst from his breast and stained the bedclothes.</p>

<p>"Murderer! Assassin!" gasped Gemma, scrambling on
her hands and knees towards the door. "I
shall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Die!" snarled Bardi. "Die!"</p>

<p>When it was all over, he stood looking at the two dead bodies,
and began to think of his own safety. His plan was soon made.</p>

<p>"I shall wound myself, and say that there was a
struggle," he muttered; "that they tried to kill me,
and I struck in self-defense. One little wound will be evidence
enough to save my life."</p>

<p>He placed the dagger at his throat, and setting his teeth with
stern determination, he inflicted upon himself a slight gash. Then
he rent his clothes as evidence of the clutching of hands, and
thrust the stained dagger into the grip of the dead woman.</p>

<p>"She tried to kill me because I slew Pietro in
self-defense," he said, rehearsing the story to himself;
"so now I&mdash;ah! <i>Dio!</i> What is this?"</p>

<p>A cold feeling, as of iced water, was creeping through his
veins, a film of gray mist swam before his eyes, and in his throat,
where he had inflicted that lying wound, there rose a ball which
choked him. He staggered and fell on his knees and hands, striking
the silver image of the Christ across the room. The walls spun
round and round, his eyes grew dark, and with a sob of agony he
pitched forward on to the bodies of his victims&mdash;dead.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>One week later Hagar was rewarded for her searching by reading
the conclusion of the tragedy of the Fiesole Crucifix. The journal
explained the finding of the three dead bodies, and commented upon
the deadly ingenuity of the weapon used, which was at once a dagger
and a crucifix. It added that one of the men and the woman had been
struck to the heart, and so had died; but mentioned that the third
corpse had a slight wound only, inflicted on the neck. "Quite
insufficient to cause death," said the sapient reporter;
"therefore, how the other man died&mdash;his name has been
ascertained to be Carlino Bardi&mdash;is a mystery."</p>

<p>It might have been to the Press; but Hagar was better informed.
A short time previously, Bolker had confessed that when he
discovered the secret of the crucifix a thin piece of paper had
been wrapped round the blade of the poniard. This he had kept, not
that it was of value, or that he had any reason to withhold it from
his mistress, but simply out of a thievish magpie propensity which
was inherent in his nature. Finding it one day in his
pocket&mdash;for he had forgotten all about it&mdash;he gave it to
Hagar. As it was written in Italian, and she was ignorant of the
language, Hagar took it to the old bookseller, of whom mention has
been made, to have it translated. This was done by a customer of
his, and the following translation was handed to Hagar the next
day:</p>

<p>"I, Guido, of Florence, have manufactured this dagger,
hidden in this silver crucifix, to slay Count Louis from France and
my faithless wife, Bianca, who with him has deceived me. As I may
not be able to strike them to the heart, I have anointed this blade
with a deadly poison, so that the slightest scratch of the poniard
causes death. I write this warning and place it within the
crucifix, so that he who finds it may beware of touching the point;
and that he may use it upon a faithless wife, as it is my intention
to do."</p>

<p>&mdash;Signed at Florence in Tuscany.</p>

<p>"GUIDO."</p>

<p>Hagar looked at this paper, after reading the report of the
tragedy, and mused. "So," said she to herself,
"Carlino killed his wife and her lover; but how did it come
about that he wounded himself, and died of the poison?"</p>

<p>There was no answer to this question, for Hagar never learnt
that Bardi had inflicted the wound on himself to save his life,
hereby slaying himself as surely as the law would have done.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>Chapter VI<br>
The Fifth Customer And The Copper Key</b>
</h2>

<p>THE several adventures in which she had been engaged begot in
Hagar a thirst for the romantic. To find that strange stories were
attached to many pawned articles; to ascertain such histories of
the past; to follow up their conclusions in the future&mdash;these
things greatly pleased the girl, and gave her an interest in a
somewhat dull life. She began to perceive that there was more
romance in modern times than latter-day sceptics are willing to
admit. Tropical scenery, ancient inns, ruined castles, are not
necessary to engender romance. It is of the human heart, of human
life; and even in the dingy Lambeth pawn-shop it blossomed and
bloomed like some rare flower thrusting itself upward betwixt the
arid city stones. Romance came daily to the gipsy girl, even in her
prosaic business existence.</p>

<p>Out of a giant tooth, an unburied bone, a mighty footprint,
Cuvier could construct a marvelous and prehistoric world. In like
manner, from some trifle upon which she lent money, Hagar would
deduce tales as fantastic as the Arabian Nights, as adventurous as
the story of Gil Blas. Of such sort was the romance brought about
by the pawning of the copper key.</p>

<p>The man who pawned it was in appearance like some Eastern mage;
and the key itself, with its curious workmanship, green with
verdigris, might have served to unlock the tower of Don Roderick.
Its owner entered the shop one morning shortly before noon, and at
the sight of his wrinkled face, and the venerable white beard which
swept his breast, Hagar felt that he was a customer out of the
common. With a gruff salutation, he threw down a paper parcel,
which clanged on the counter.</p>

<p>"Look at that," said he, sharply. "I wish to
pawn it."</p>

<p>In no wise disturbed by his discourtesy, Hagar opened the
package, and found therein a roll of linen; this, when unwound,
revealed a slender copper key of no great size. The wards at the
lower end were nearly level with the stem of the key itself, as
they consisted merely of five or six prickles of copper encircling
at irregular intervals the round stem. The handle, however, was
ornate and curious, being shaped like a bishop's crozier,
while within the crook of the pastoral staff design the letters
"C.R." were interwoven in an elaborate monogram.
Altogether, this key&mdash;apparently very ancient&mdash;was a
beautiful piece of workmanship, but of no value save to a dealer in
rarities. Hagar examined it carefully, shook her head, and tossed
it on the counter.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't give you five shillings on it,"
said she, contemptuously; "it is worth nothing."</p>

<p>"Bah, girl! You do not know what you are talking about.
Look at the workmanship."</p>

<p>"Very fine, no doubt; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the monogram, you blind bat!" interrupted the
old man. "'C.R.'&mdash;that stands for Carolus
Rex."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Hagar, picking up the key again, and
taking it to the light of the window; "it is an historic key,
then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is said to be the key of the box in which the
First Charles kept the treasonous papers which ultimately cost him
his head. Oh, you may look! The key is authentic enough. It has
been in the Danetree family for close on two hundred and fifty
years."</p>

<p>"And are you a Danetree?"</p>

<p>"No; I am Luke Parsons, the steward of the
family."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Hagar, with a piercing glance.
"Then how comes the key into your possession?"</p>

<p>"I don't recognize your right to ask such
questions," said Parsons, in an angry tone. "The key
came into my possession honestly."</p>

<p>"Very probably; but I should like to know how. Do not get
in a rage, Mr. Parsons," added Hagar, hastily; "we
pawnbrokers have to be very particular, you know."</p>

<p>"I don't know," snapped the customer;
"but if your curiosity must be satisfied, the key came to me
from my father Mark, a former steward of the Danetrees. It was
given to him by the then head of the family some sixty years
ago."</p>

<p>"What are all these figures graven on the stem?"
asked Hagar, noting a number of hieroglyphic marks.</p>

<p>"Ordinary Arabic numerals," retorted Parsons.
"What they mean I know no more than you do. If I did I should
be rich," he added, to himself.</p>

<p>"Ah! there is some secret connected with these
figures?" said Hagar, overhearing.</p>

<p>"If there is, you won't find it out," replied
the old man, ungraciously; "and it is none of your business,
anyhow! What you have to do is to lend money on the key."</p>

<p>Hagar hesitated. The article, notwithstanding its workmanship,
its age, and its historical associations, was worth very little.
Had its interest consisted of these merely, she would not have
taken the key in pawn. But the row of mysterious figures decided
her. Here was a secret, connected&mdash;as was probable from the
remark of the old man&mdash;with a hidden treasure. Remembering her
experience with the cryptogram of the Florentine Dante, Hagar
determined to retain the key, and, if possible, to discover the
secret.</p>

<p>"If you are really in want of money, I will let you have a
pound on it," she said, casting a glance at the threadbare
clothes of her customer.</p>

<p>"If I did not need money, I should not have blundered into
your spider's web," he retorted. "A pound will
do; make out the ticket in the name of Luke Parsons, The Lodge,
Danetree Hall, Buckton, Kent."</p>

<p>In silence Hagar did as she was bid; in silence she gave him
ticket and money; and in silence he walked out of the shop. When
alone she took up the key, and began to examine the figures without
loss of time. The learning of many secrets had created in her a
burning desire to learn more. If ingenuity and perseverance could
do it, Hagar was bent upon discovering the secret of the copper
key.</p>

<p>This mysterious object was so covered with verdigris that she
was unable to decipher the marks. With her usual promptness, Hagar
got the necessary materials, and cleaned the key thoroughly. The
figures&mdash;those, as Parsons had said, of Arabic
numerals&mdash;then appeared clearer, and Hagar noted that they
extended the whole length of the copper stem. Taking paper and
pencil, she copied them out carefully, with the following
result:</p>

<p align="center">
"20211814115251256205255&mdash;H&mdash;38518212."</p>

<p>"An odd jumble of figures!" said Hagar, staring at
the result of her labors. "I wonder what they
mean."</p>

<p>Unversed in the science of unraveling cryptograms, she was
unable to answer her own question; and after an hour of profitless
investigation, which made her head ache, she numbered the key
according to the numeral of the ticket, and put it away. But the
oddity of the affair, the strange circumstance of the figures with
the letter "H" stranded among them, often made her
reflective, and she was devoured by curiosity&mdash;that parent of
all great discoveries&mdash;to know what key and figures meant.
Nevertheless, for all her thought no explanation of the problem
presented itself. To her the secret of the key was the secret of
the Sphinx&mdash;as mysterious, as unguessable.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to her that there might be some story, or
legend, or tradition attached to this queer key, which might throw
some light on the mystery of the figures. If she learnt the story,
it was not improbable that she might gain a hint therefrom. At all
events. Parsons had spoken of concealed riches connected with the
reading of the cypher. To attempt to unravel the problem without
knowing the reason for which the figures were engraved was,
vulgarly speaking, putting the cart before the horse. Hagar
determined that the cart should be in its proper place, viz., at
the tail of the animal. In other words, she resolved first to learn
the legend of the key, and afterwards attempt a reading of the
riddle. To get at the truth, it was necessary to see Parsons.</p>

<p>No sooner had Hagar made up her mind to this course than she
resolved to carry out her plan. Leaving Bolker to mind the shop,
she went off down to Kent&mdash;to the Lodge, Buckton, that address
which Parsons had given to be written on the ticket. With her she
took the key, in case it might be wanted, and shortly after midday
she alighted at a little rural station.</p>

<p>Oh, it was sweet to be once more in the country, to wander
through green lanes o'er-arched with bending hazels, to smell
the perfume of Kentish orchards, to run across the springy turf of
wide moors golden with gorse! Such a fair expanse was stretched out
at the back of the station, and across it&mdash;as Hagar was
informed by an obliging porter&mdash;Danetree Hall was to be found.
At the gates thereof, in a pretty and quaint lodge, dwelt surly Mr.
Parsons, and thither went Hagar; but in truth she almost forgot her
errand in the delights of the country.</p>

<p>Her gipsy blood sang in her veins as she ran across the green
sward, and her heart leaped in her bosom for very lightness. She
forgot the weary Lambeth pawn-shop; she thought not of Eustace
Lorn; she did not let her mind dwell upon the return of Goliath and
her subsequent disinheritance; all she knew was that she was a
Romany lass, a child of the road, and had entered again into her
kingdom. In such a happy vein she saw the red roofs of Danetree
Hall rising above the trees of a great park; and almost immediately
she arrived at the great iron gates, behind which, on one side of a
stately avenue, she espied the lodge wherein dwelt Parsons.</p>

<p>He was sitting outside smoking a pipe, morose even in the golden
sunlight, with the scent of flowers in his nostrils, the music of
the birds in his ears. On seeing Hagar peering between the bars of
the gate he started up, and literally rushed towards her.</p>

<p>"Pawn-shop girl!" he growled, like an angry bear.
"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Civility in the first place; rest in the second!"
retorted Hagar, coolly. "Let me in, Mr. Parsons. I have come
to see you about that copper key."</p>

<p>"You've lost it?" shouted the gruff
creature.</p>

<p>"Not I; it's in my pocket. But I wish to know its
story."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Parsons, opening the gates with
manifest reluctance.</p>

<p>Without replying Hagar marched past him, into his garden, and
the porch of his house. Finally she took her seat in the chair
Parsons had vacated. The old man seemed rather pleased with her
ungracious behavior, which matched so well with his own; and after
closing the gates he came to stare at her brilliant face.</p>

<p>"You're a handsome woman, and a bold one,"
said he, slowly. "Come inside, and tell me why you wish to
know the story of the key."</p>

<p>Accepting the invitation with civility, Hagar followed her
eccentric host into a prim little parlor furnished in the ugly
fashion of the early Victorian era. Chairs and sofa were of
mahogany and horsehair; a round table, with gilt-edged books lying
thereon at regular intervals, occupied the center of the apartment,
and the gilt-framed mirror over the fireplace was swathed in green
gauze. Copperplate prints of the Queen and the Prince Consort
decorated the crudely-papered walls, and the well-worn carpet was
of a dark-green hue sprinkled with bouquets of red flowers.
Altogether a painfully ugly room, which made any one gifted with
artistic aspirations shudder. Hagar, whose eye was trained to
beauty, shuddered duly, and then took her seat on the most
comfortable of the ugly chairs.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to know the story of the key?"
asked Parsons, throwing his bulky figure on the slippery sofa.</p>

<p>"Because I wish to read the riddle of the key."</p>

<p>Parsons started up, and his face grew red with anger. "No,
no! You shall not&mdash;you must not! Never will I make her
rich!"</p>

<p>"Make who rich?" asked Hagar, astonished at this
outburst.</p>

<p>"Marion Danetree&mdash;the proud hussey! My son loves her,
but she disdains him. He is breaking his heart, while she laughs.
If that picture were found she would be rich, and despise my poor
Frank the more."</p>

<p>"The picture? What picture?"</p>

<p>"Why, the one that is hidden," said Parsons in
surprise. "The clue to the hiding-place is said to be
concealed in the figures on the key. If you find the picture, it
will sell for thirty thousand pounds, which would go to that cruel
Miss Danetree."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand," said Hagar, rather
bewildered. "Would you mind telling me the story from the
beginning?"</p>

<p>"As you please," replied the old man, moodily.
"I'll make it as short as I can. Squire Danetree, the
grandfather of the present lady, who is the only representative of
the family, was very rich, and a friend of George the Fourth. Like
all the Danetrees, he was a scamp, and squandered the property of
the family in entertainments during the Regency. He sold all the
pictures of the Hall save one, 'The Nativity,' by
Andrea del Castagno, a famous Florentine painter of the
Renaissance. The King offered thirty thousand pounds for this gem,
as he wished to buy it for the nation. Danetree refused, as he had
some compunction at robbing his only son, and wished to leave him
the picture as the only thing saved out of the wreck. But as time
went on, and money became scarce, he determined to sell this last
valuable. Then the picture disappeared."</p>

<p>"How did it disappear?"</p>

<p>"My father hid it," replied Parsons, coolly.
"It was not known at the time, but the old man confessed on
his death-bed that, determined to save the family from ruin, he had
concealed the picture while Squire Danetree was indulging in his
mad orgies in London. When my father confessed, the spendthrift
squire was dead, and he wished the son&mdash;the present Miss
Danetree's father&mdash;to possess the picture and to sell
it, in order to restore the fortunes of the family."</p>

<p>"Well, did he not tell where the picture was
hidden?"</p>

<p>"No; he died on the point of revealing the secret,"
said Parsons. "All he could say was 'The key! the
key!' Then I knew that the hiding-place was indicated by the
row of figures graven on the stem of the copper key. I tried to
make out the meaning; so did my son; so did Squire Danetree and his
daughter. But all to no purpose. None can read the
riddle."</p>

<p>"But why did you pawn the key?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't for money, you may be sure of
that!" snapped the old man&mdash;"or I should not have
taken a paltry pound for it. No, I pawned it to put it beyond my
son's reach. He was always poring over it, so I thought he
might guess the meaning and find the picture."</p>

<p>"And why not? Don't you want it found?"</p>

<p>Parsons's face assumed a malignant expression.
"No!" said he, sharply&mdash;"for then Frank
would be foolish enough to give the picture to Miss
Danetree&mdash;to the woman who despises him. If you guess the
riddle, don't tell him, as I don't want to make the
proud jade rich."</p>

<p>"I can't guess the riddle," replied Hagar
hopelessly. "Your story does not aid me in the
least."</p>

<p>While thus speaking, her eyes wandered to the wall at the back
of the glum old steward. Thereon she saw in a frame of black wood
one of those hideous samplers which our grandmothers were so fond
of working. It was a yellow square, embroidered&mdash;or rather
stitched&mdash;with the alphabet in divers colors, and also
a' array of numerals up to twenty-six. Hagar idly wondered
why the worker had stopped at that particular number; and then she
noticed that the row of figures was placed directly under the row
of letters. At once the means of reading the key riddle flashed on
her brain. The cypher was exceedingly simple. All that had to be
done was to substitute letters for the figures. Hagar uttered an
ejaculation which roused old Parsons from his musings.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" said he, turning his
head: "what are you looking at, girl? Oh," he added,
following her gaze, "that sampler; 'twas done by my
mother; a rare hand at needlework she was! But never mind her just
now. I want to know about that riddle."</p>

<p>"I can't guess it," said Hagar, keeping her
own counsel, for reasons to be revealed hereafter. "Do you
wish your key back? I have it here."</p>

<p>"No; I don't want my son to get it, and make that
proud wench rich by guessing the riddle. Keep the key till I call
for it. What! are you going? Have a drink of milk?"</p>

<p>The offer was hospitably made, but Hagar declined it, as she had
no desire to break bread with this malignant old man. Making a curt
excuse, she took her leave, and within the hour she was on her way
back to London, with a clue to the cypher in her brain. The sampler
had revealed the secret; for without doubt it was from his
wife's needlework that the Parsons of sixty years before had
got the idea of constructing his cryptogram. In the sampler the
figures were placed thus:</p>

<p>and Parsons had simply substituted figures for letters. The
thing was so plain that Hagar wondered why, with the key-sampler
staring him in the face, the steward had not succeeded in reading
the riddle.</p>

<p>When back in the shop, she applied her test to the figures on
the key, and found out the meaning thereof. Then she considered
what was the best course to pursue. Clearly it was not wise to tell
Parsons, as he hated Miss Danetree, and if he found the picture
through Hagar's aid he might either hide it again or destroy
it. Should she tell Miss Danetree herself, or Frank Parsons, the
despised lover? After some consideration the girl wrote to the
latter, asking him to call on her at the shop. She felt rather a
sympathy with his plight after hearing his father's story,
and wished to judge for herself if he was an eligible suitor for
Miss Danetree's hand. If she liked him, and found him worthy,
Hagar was resolved to tell him how to find the picture, and by
doing so thus aid him to gain the hand of the disdainful beauty.
If, on the other hand, she did not care for him, Hagar concluded to
reveal her discovery to Miss Danetree herself. Her resolution thus
being taken, she waited quietly for the arrival of the
steward's son.</p>

<p>When he presented himself, Hagar liked him very much indeed, for
three reasons. In the first place, he was handsome&mdash;a sure
passport to a woman's favor; in the second, he had a fine
frank nature, and a tolerably intelligent brain; in the third, he
was deeply in love with Marion Danetree. This last reason
influenced Hagar as much as anything, for she was at a romantic
age, and took a deep interest in love and lovers.</p>

<p>"It is most extraordinary that my father should have
pawned the key," said Frank, when Hagar had told her story,
less the explanation of the riddle.</p>

<p>"It may be extraordinary, Mr. Parsons, but it is very
lucky&mdash;for you."</p>

<p>"I don't see it," said Frank, raising his
eyebrows. "Why."</p>

<p>"Why," replied Hagar, drawing the key out of her
pocket, "because I have discovered the secret."</p>

<p>"What! Do you know what that line of figures
means?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When I paid my visit to your father, I saw an
article in his room which gave me a clue. I worked out the cypher,
and now I know where the picture is hidden."</p>

<p>Young Parsons sprang to his feet with glowing eyes.
"Where&mdash;oh, where?" he almost shouted. "Tell
me, quick!"</p>

<p>"For you to tell Miss Danetree, no doubt," said
Hagar, coolly.</p>

<p>At once his enthusiasm died away, and he sat down, with a frown
on his face. "What do you know about Miss Danetree?" he
asked, sharply.</p>

<p>"All that your father told me, Mr. Parsons. You love her,
but she does not love you; and for that your father hates
her."</p>

<p>"I know he does," said the young man, sighing,
"and very unjustly. I will be frank with you, Miss
Stanley."</p>

<p>"I think it is best for you to be so, as I hold your fate
in my hands."</p>

<p>"You hold&mdash;fate! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Hagar shrugged her shoulders in pity at his obtuseness.
"Why," she said, quietly, "this picture is worth
thirty thousand pounds, and Miss Danetree is worth nothing except
that ruined Hall. If I tell you where to find that picture, you
will be able to restore her fortunes, and make her a comparatively
rich woman. Now you cannot read the cypher; I can; and so&mdash;you
see!"</p>

<p>Young Parsons laughed outright at her comprehensive view of the
situation, although he blushed a little at the same time, and gave
an indignant denial to the hinted motive which prompted
Hagar's speech. "I am not a fortune-hunter," he
said, bluntly; "if I learn the whereabouts of
Castagno's 'Nativity,' I shall certainly tell
Mar&mdash;I mean Miss Danetree. But as for trading on that
knowledge to make her marry me against her will, I'd rather
die than act so basely!"</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear young man, I am afraid you have no business
instincts," said Hagar, dryly. "I thought you loved the
lady."</p>

<p>"You are determined to get at the truth, I see. Yes; I do
love her."</p>

<p>"And she loves you?"</p>

<p>Parsons hesitated, and blushed again at this downright
questioning. "Yes; I think she does&mdash;a little," he
said, at length.</p>

<p>"H'm! That means she loves you a great
deal."</p>

<p>"Well," said the young man, slyly, "you are a
woman, and should be able to read a woman's character.
Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But you forget that I have not seen this
particular woman&mdash;or rather angel, as I suppose you call
her."</p>

<p>"You are a queer girl!"</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;a love-sick young man!" rejoined
Hagar, mimicking his tone. "But time passes; tell me about
your wooing."</p>

<p>"There is little to tell," rejoined Frank,
dolefully. "My father is, as you know, the steward of the
Danetree family; but as they were ruined by the Regency squire, his
duties are now light enough. Miss Danetree is the last of the race,
and all that remains to her is the Hall, the few acres which
surround it, and a small income from the rents of two outlying
farms. I was brought up from childhood with Marion&mdash;I must
call her so, as it is the name which comes easiest to my
lips&mdash;and I loved her always. She loves me also."</p>

<p>"Then why will she not marry you?"</p>

<p>"Because she is poor and I am poor. Oh, my position as son
of her steward would not stand in the way could I support her as my
wife. But my father always refused to let me learn a profession or
a trade, or even to earn my own livelihood, as he desired me to
succeed him as the steward of the Danetree property. In the old
days the post was a good one; but now it is worth
nothing."</p>

<p>"And your father dislikes Miss Danetree."</p>

<p>"Yes, because he thinks she scorns me&mdash;which she does
not. But she will not let me tell him the truth until there is a
chance of our marriage."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hagar, producing the paper on which was
written the line of figures, "I am about to give you that
chance. This cypher is quite easy; figures have been substituted
for letters&mdash;that is all. A is set down as one, B as two, and
so on."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand."</p>

<p>"I will show you. These figures must be divided into
numbers, and a letter set over each. Now, the first number is
twenty, and the twentieth letter of the alphabet is
'T.' The twenty-first letter is 'U.' Then
come the eighteenth and the fourteenth letters. What are
they?"</p>

<p>Frank counted. "'R' and
'N,'" he said, after a pause. "Ah! I see
the first word is T, U, R, N,&mdash;that is turn!"</p>

<p>"Exactly; represented by numbers, 20, 21, 18, 14. Now you
understand, so I need not explain further. Here is the cypher
written out."</p>

<p>Young Parsons took up the paper and read as follows:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="0606101h-images/page146.png" width=
"900" height="270" alt="">
</p>

<p>"Turn key left eye eighth cherub!" repeated Parsons,
in puzzled tones. "I have no doubt that you have solved the
problem correctly; but, I do not know what the sentence
means."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hagar, rather sharply, "it means,
I should think, that the left eye of some cherub's head is a
keyhole, into which is to be thrust the copper key upon which the
figures are engraved. Doubtless, by turning the key the wall will
open, and the picture will be discovered."</p>

<p>"What a clever girl you are!" cried Parsons, in
admiration.</p>

<p>"I use my brains, that is all," said Hagar, coolly.
"I'm afraid you don't. However, are there a
number of sculptured cherubs in Danetree Hall?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there is a room called 'The Cherubs'
Room,' from a number of carved heads. How did you guess that
there was more than one?"</p>

<p>"Because the letter 'H' corresponds with the
figure eight; so no doubt there are more than eight heads. All you
have to do is to take this copper key, put it into the left eye of
the eighth cherub, and find the picture. Then you can marry Miss
Danetree, and the pair of you can live on the thirty thousand
pounds. If she is as clever as you, you'll need it
all."</p>

<p>Quite impervious to Hagar's irony, Frank Parsons took his
leave with many admiring words and protestations of gratitude. When
he found the picture he promised to let Hagar know, and to invite
her to Danetree Hall to see it. Then he departed, and it was only
when she was left alone that Hagar reflected she had not got back
the pound lent on the key. But she consoled herself with the
reflection that she could demand it when the hidden picture was
discovered. Principal and interest was what she required; for Hagar
was nothing if not businesslike.</p>

<p>That same evening Frank was seated in the prim little parlor
with his dour father. He had been up to the Hall, and had proved
the truth of Hagar's reading by discovering the picture; also
he had seen Marion Danetree, and told her of the good fortune which
was coming. She would be able to buy back the lost acres of the
family, to restore and refurnish the old house, to take up her
position again in the county, and reign once more as the lady of
Danetree Hall. All this Frank told his father, and the old
man's brow grew black as night.</p>

<p>"You have made her rich!" he
muttered&mdash;"that proud girl who looks upon you as dirt
beneath her feet."</p>

<p>Frank smiled. He had not told his father the termination of the
interview with Marion; nor did he intend to do so at present.</p>

<p>"We'll talk of Marion and her pride
to-morrow," he said, rising; "I am going to bed just
now; but you know how I discovered the picture, and how it has been
restored to the Danetrees as grandfather wished."</p>

<p>When his son left the room, Luke Parsons sat with folded hands
and a dull pain in his heart. It was gall and wormwood to him that
the woman who rejected Frank should acquire wealth and regain her
position through the aid of the man she despised. Oh, if he could
only hide the picture, or even destroy it!&mdash;anything rather
than that proud Marion Danetree should be placed on an eminence to
look down on his bright boy. To rob her of this newly-found
wealth&mdash;to take away the picture&mdash;Parsons felt that he
would commit even a crime.</p>

<p>And why should he not? Frank had left the key on the
table&mdash;the copper key which was to be placed in the left eye
of the cherub. Parsons knew well enough&mdash;from the explanation
of his son&mdash;how the key was to be used; how his father had
designed the hiding-place of the Castagno picture. The lock and key
which had belonged to the First Charles had been given to the old
man by his master. He had placed the first behind the cherub, with
the keyhole in the left eye, so as to keep the panel or portion of
the wall in its place; and on the second he had graven the numbers
indicating the locality. Parsons rose to his feet and stretched out
his hand for the copper key. When he touched it, all his scruples
vanished. He made up his mind then and there to go up that night to
the Hall and destroy the picture. Then Marion Danetree would no
longer be rich, or benefit by the secret which Frank had
discovered. It will be seen that Mr. Parsons never thought of
Hagar's share in the reading of the cypher.</p>

<p>As steward he had keys of all the doors in the Hall, and was
able easily to gain admission at whatever hour he chose. He chose
to enter now, and with a lantern in his hand, and a clasp-knife
hidden in his pocket, he went on his errand of destruction.
Unlocking a small side door under the greater terrace, he passed
along the dark underground passages, ascending to the upper floor,
and in a short space of time he found himself in "The
Cherubs' Room."</p>

<p>It was a large and lofty apartment, paneled with oak darkened by
time and carved with fruit and flowers and foliage after the mode
of Grinling Gibbons. Between each panel there was a
beautifully-carven cherub's head, with curly hair, and wings
placed crosswise under the chin. The moonlight streaming in through
the wide and uncurtained windows showed all these things clearly to
the wild eyes of the old man; and he made haste to fulfil his task
before the moon should set and leave him in darkness. Swinging the
lantern so that its yellow light should illuminate the walls,
Parsons counted the cherubs' heads between the panels,
starting from the door, and was rewarded by finding the one he
sought. The left eye of this face was pierced, and into it he
inserted the slender copper stem of the key. There was a cracking
sound as he turned it, and then the whole of the panel swung
outward to the left. On the back of this he beheld the picture of
Andrea del Castagno. The sight of it was so unexpected that he
started back with a cry, and let fall the lantern, which was
immediately extinguished. However, this mattered little, as he had
ample light in the rays of the summer moon. In the white radiance
he relighted his candle, and then, betwixt the yellow glare of the
one and the chill glimmer of the other, he examined the gem of art
which, in the interests of mistaken pride, he proposed to destroy.
It was beautiful beyond description.</p>

<p>Under a lowly roof of thatched straw lay the Divine Child,
stretching up His little Hands to the Holy Mother. With arms
crossed upon her breast in ecstatic adoration, Mary bent over Him
worshiping; and in the dim obscurity of the humble dwelling could
be seen the tall form and reverend head of Joseph. Above spread the
dark blue of the night sky, broken by golden dashes of color, in
which were seen the majestic forms of wide-winged angels looking
earthward. At the top of the picture there was a blaze of light
radiating from the Godhead, and in the arrowy beam streaming
downward floated the white specter of the Holy Dove. The marvelous
beauty of the picture lay in the dispersion and disposition of the
various lights: that mild luster which emanated from the Form of
the Child, the aureole hovering round the bowed head of Mary; the
glory of the golden atmosphere surrounding the angels; and, highest
and most wonderful of all, the fierce white light which showered
down, blinding the terrible, from the unseen Deity. The picture was
majestic, sublime: a dream of lovely piety, a masterpiece of
art.</p>

<p>For the moment Parsons was spellbound before this wounderful
creation which he intended to destroy. Almost he was tempted to
forego his evil purpose, and to spare the beautiful vision which
spread itself so gloriously before trial. But the thought of Marion
and her scorn, of Frank and his hopeless love, decided him With a
look of hatred he opened the knife, and raised the blade to slash
the picture.</p>

<p>"Stop!"</p>

<p>With a cry, Parsons dropped the knife and wheeled round at that
imperious command. At the further end of the room, candle in hand,
stood the tall form of a woman. She wore a dressing-gown hastily
thrown over her shoulders; her hair was loose, her feet were bare;
and she approached the steward noiselessly and swiftly. It was
Marion Danetree, and her eyes were full of anger.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here at this time of night?" she
demanded haughtily of the sullen old man. "I heard a cry and
the noise of a fall, and I came down."</p>

<p>"I want to spoil that picture," said Parsons between
his teeth.</p>

<p>"Destroy Castagno's 'Nativity'? Take
away my only chance of restoring the family fortunes? You are
mad."</p>

<p>"No; I am Frank's father. You despise him; you hate
him. Through him you have found the picture; but now&mdash;"
He picked up the knife again.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment!" said Marion, comprehending
Parsons's motive; "if you destroy that picture, you
prevent my marriage with Frank."</p>

<p>"What?"&mdash;the knife crashed on the
floor&mdash;"are you going to marry my boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did not Frank tell you? When we discovered the
picture together this afternoon, he asked me to be his wife. I
consented only too gladly."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but I thought you despised him!"</p>

<p>"Despise him? I love him better than all the world! Go
away, Mr. Parsons, and thank God that He sent me to prevent you
committing a crime. I shall bring that picture to Frank as my
dowry. He shall take my name, and there will once more be a Squire
Danetree at the Hall."</p>

<p>"O Miss Danetree&mdash;Marion&mdash;forgive me!"
cried Parsons, quite broken down.</p>

<p>"I forgive you; it was love for Frank made you think of
this folly. But go&mdash;go! it is not seemly that you should be
here at this hour of the night."</p>

<p>Parsons closed up the panel in silence, locked it, and turned to
go. But as he passed her he held out his hand.</p>

<p>"What is this?" asked Marion, smiling.</p>

<p>"My gift to you&mdash;my marriage gift&mdash;the copper
key which has brought you a husband and a fortune."</p>

The Sixth Customer And The Silver Teapot</b>
</h2>

<p>OF all the people with whom Hagar had to do while managing the
Lambeth pawn-shop, she liked always to remember Margaret Snow. The
memory of that pale, blind old maid, with her sorrowful story and
her patient endurance, never died out of the girl's heart.
The pitiful little episode of the silver teapot, which she pawned
so unwillingly, and only out of sheer necessity; the sad tale
recounted by the crushed creature, and the unexpected part which
she took herself in the conclusion of such tale: all these things
served to keep green the memory of the sad woman whom Hagar called
her sixth customer. There was even something ludicrous in parts of
the affair; something naive and childlike in the absolute
simplicity of the romance; but Hagar never saw its humor. All she
knew was that Margaret was a martyr and a saint, and that the world
was the loser for not knowing her story. Such as it is, the tale
runs thus:</p>

<p>It was dusk one November evening when Margaret entered the shop,
with a parcel tied up in an old towel. Hagar knew her well by sight
as a blind woman who lived in an attic at the top of the end house
in Carby's Crescent, and as one who earned a hard and
penurious living by weaving hand-baskets of straw for a great
emporium at the corner of the outside street. These baskets&mdash;a
speciality of the great shop&mdash;were given to customers in which
to carry away small parcels; and as the demand was constant, the
supply was the same. Margaret could always sell as many of these
baskets as she could weave; but, although skilful and nimble with
her long fingers, she could rarely earn more than ten shillings a
week. On this she had to live, and dress, and buy food, so her
existence was really a kind of miracle. Still, she had never asked
charity of a single soul, being proud and reserved: and in all the
years she had dwelt in Carby's Crescent she had never entered
the pawn-shop. Knowing this, Hagar was astonished to see her
standing in one of the sentry-boxes, with the bundle placed on the
counter before her.</p>

<p>"Miss Snow!" cried Hagar, in sheer surprise.
"What is the matter? Is there anything that I can do for
you?"</p>

<p>The thin pale face of the woman flushed as she heard herself
called by her name; and her voice was hesitating and low as she
laid one slender finger on the bundle, before making reply.</p>

<p>"I have been ill, Miss Stanley," she explained,
softly, "so I have not done much work lately. Very little
money has come in. I&mdash;I am obliged to&mdash;to pay my rent
and&mdash;and&mdash;" She broke down altogether, and added
desperately: "Please lend me something on this."</p>

<p>Hagar became a business woman at once "What is it?"
she said, undoing the bundle deftly.</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;it is&mdash;a silver teapot," faltered
Miss Snow; "the only valuable I possess. I wish to pawn it
for three months, until I can redeem it. I&mdash;I&mdash;hope to
repay the money by then. Three&mdash;three pounds will
be&mdash;" Her voice died away in her throat: and Hagar saw
her poor thin hand steal up to her averted face to brush away a
tear.</p>

<p>The teapot was a square one of Georgian design, with fluted
sides, an elegantly-curved spout, and a smooth handle of ivory.
Hagar was quite willing to lend on it the required three pounds, as
the silver was worth more, until she made a curious discovery. The
lid of the pot was closed tightly, and soldered all round, in a
manner which made it quite impossible to be opened. This odd
circumstance rendered the teapot for all practical purposes
entirely useless; no one could use an hermetically sealed
vessel.</p>

<p>"Why is this teapot closed?" asked Hagar in
surprise.</p>

<p>"It was done thirty years ago by my order," replied
the blind woman, in a calm voice; then, after a pause, she added in
faint and hestitating tones: "There are letters in
it."</p>

<p>"Letters? Whose letters?"</p>

<p>"Mine and&mdash;a person's with whom you have no
concern. Please do not ask any more questions, Miss Stanley. Give
me the money and let me go. I hope to redeem the teapot in three
months."</p>

<p>Hagar hesitated and looked doubtful. "As it is sealed up,
the teapot is hardly of much use," she said, after a pause.
"Take it back, my dear Miss Snow, and I'll lend you the
three pounds."</p>

<p>"Thank you, no," replied the old maid, coldly.
"I take charity from no one. If you can't lend the
money on the teapot, give me back my property."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I'll take it in pawn if you like,"
rejoined Hagar, with a shrug. "Here are three sovereigns, and
I'll make out the ticket at once."</p>

<p>The hand of the blind woman closed on the money with a sigh of
mingled regret and relief. When Hagar returned with the ticket she
saw that Margaret was fondling the piece of silver as though
unwilling to part with it. She drew back, flushing, on hearing the
approaching foot-steps of Hagar, and taking the ticket in silence,
moved away with tears running down her withered cheeks. Hagar was
touched by this mute misery.</p>

<p>"Can you find your way back home in the darkness?"
she called out.</p>

<p>"My dear," said the elder woman with dignity,
"day and night are the same to me. You forget that I am
blind. Also," she added, with an attempt at lightness,
"I know every inch of this neighborhood."</p>

<p>When she departed Hagar put away the teapot, and wondered a
little over the odd circumstance of it being closed, and containing
love-letters. She was certain that the letters were full of love
from the faltering way in which Margaret had mentioned them; also
because they were her own and "a person's with whom you
have no concern."</p>

<p>That last sentence, as spoken by the blind woman, showed Hagar
only too truly her indomitable reserve and pride. She must have
been reduced to her last crust before she could have brought
herself to pawn the queer casket&mdash;and a teapot as a receptacle
for love-letters was very queer indeed&mdash;which contained the
evidence of her youth's dead romance. Thirty years ago the
teapot had been sealed; Hagar knew also that thirty years ago the
heart of this blind and unattractive old maid had been broken. Here
indeed was material for a true romance&mdash;and that of the
strangest, the most pitiful.</p>

<p>"What a strange place is a pawn-shop!" said Hagar,
philosophizing to herself. "All the flotsam and jetsam of
human lives drift into it. Broken hearts, wrecked careers, worn-out
and dead romances&mdash;this is the place for them all. I should
like to know the story of that sealed-up teapot."</p>

<p>Indeed, so curious she was to know it that she felt
half-inclined to call on the old maid, and ask for information. But
Hagar, although a poor girl, and a wandering gipsy, and the
manageress of a low London pawn-shop, had a natural instinct of
delicacy which withheld her from forcing the confidence of one
disinclined to give it.</p>

<p>Miss Snow was a lady born, as all Carby's Crescent knew,
and her unbending pride was proverbial. The few words with which
she had checked Hagar's inquiries about the letters enshrined
in the teapot showed plainly enough that the subject of the hinted
romance was not one to be touched upon. Hagar therefore kept the
teapot in the shop, and forbore to call upon its owner.</p>

<p>For some weeks Margaret continued to weave her baskets and take
them to the shop which employed her. She went to church every
Sunday morning, according to her usual custom; and other than these
outings she remained secluded in her freezing garret. In that year
the winter was particularly severe in London, and snow fell thickly
before Christmas. In her desire to save money for the redemption of
the teapot, Margaret denied herself a fire, and reduced the amount
of food she took, to as little as would sustain life. In her thin
clothing and well-worn shoes she went to shop and church amid
falling snow, and in the teeth of cutting winds. Naturally, with
lack of clothing, food and fire, with her weight of years, and
emaciated frame, she fell ill. One morning she did not appear, and
the woman of the house went up to find her in bed.</p>

<p>Still, her bold spirit, her inborn pride, kept her resolute to
refuse charity; and she wove her baskets sitting up in her
buckle-bed, between bouts of pain and anguish. In these straits she
must have died, but that God in His pity for this helpless and
tortured woman sent an angel to aid her. The angel was Hagar; and a
very practical angel she proved to be.</p>

<p>Learning from the gossip of the neighborhood that Miss Snow was
ill, and remembering the episode of the silver teapot, Hagar
marched up to the freezing garret and took charge of the old maid.
Margaret objected with all her feeble force; but the kind-hearted
gipsy girl was not to be deterred from what she conceived to be her
duty.</p>

<p>"You are ill and alone, so I must look after you,"
she said, throwing a rug, which she had brought, over the poor
woman.</p>

<p>"But I cannot pay you. All I have of value is the silver
teapot."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hagar, proceeding to kindle a good
fire, "that is safe in my shop, so don't trouble about
it. As to payment, we'll talk about that when you get
better."</p>

<p>"I shall never get better," groaned Margaret, and
turned her face to the wall. And indeed, Hagar thought, that was
true enough. Worn by years of cold and privation, Margaret's
body was too feeble to resist much longer the inroads of disease.
When she left her garret again it would be feet foremost; and
another London pauper would be added to the great army of the
unknown dead. With Margaret the sands of time were running out very
rapidly.</p>

<p>Hagar was like a sister to her. She kept her supplied with fire
and food and blankets; she gave her wine to drink; and, when she
could get away from the shop, she came oftentimes to sit by that
poor bedside. It was on such an occasion that she heard the one
romance of Margaret's life, and learnt why the
love-letters&mdash;they truly were love-letters&mdash;had been
placed in the silver teapot.</p>

<p>It was late in December, and the ground was white with snow. The
shops, even in Carby's Crescent, were being decked with holly
and mistletoe for the season of Yule; and, after closing the
premises, Hagar had come to pass an hour with Margaret. There was a
good fire&mdash;one which would have made wrathful the miserly
heart of the late Jacob Dix&mdash;and a fair amount of light from
two candles placed on the mantelpiece. Margaret was cheerful, even
gay, on this evening; and with her hand in Hagar's she
thanked the girl for her kindness.</p>

<p>"But indeed thanks are weak," said the blind woman;
"you have fed the hungry and clothed the naked. After thirty
years of doubt, my dear, you have restored my faith in human
nature."</p>

<p>"How did you lose it?"</p>

<p>"Through a man, my dear; one who said that he loved me,
yet who broke off our engagement without any reason."</p>

<p>"That was strange. Why did you not ask him for his
reason?"</p>

<p>"I could not," said Margaret, with a sigh; "he
was in India. But it is a long story, my dear. If you care to
listen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted," said Hagar,
quickly&mdash;"especially if it explains why you sealed up
the letters in the teapot."</p>

<p>"Yes; it explains that. In that teapot&mdash;which was the
only present I ever received from John Mask&mdash;I placed his
cruel letters thirty years ago; also mine to him, which he sent
back."</p>

<p>"Why did he send back your letters?" asked
Hagar.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I cannot say; but he returned them.
Oh!" she cried with a burst of anguish, "how cruel, how
cruel! and I loved him so&mdash;I loved him! But he forgot me and
married Jane Lorrimer. Now they are rich and prosperous and happy,
while I&mdash;I am dying a pauper in a garret. And the silver
teapot is pawned," she finished pathetically.</p>

<p>Hagar patted the thin hand which gripped the bedclothes.
"Tell me the story," said she,
soothingly&mdash;"that is, if it will not cause you too much
pain.</p>

<p>"Pain," echoed Margaret, bitterly. "When the
heart is broken it feels no pain, and mine was broken thirty years
ago by John Mask." She remained silent for a moment, and then
continued: "I lived at Christchurch, in Hants, my dear, in a
little cottage just outside the town. This I inherited from my
parents, together with a trifle of money&mdash;not much, indeed,
but sufficient to live upon. Both my father and mother had died,
leaving me alone in the world at the age of twenty; so I lived in
my cottage with Lucy Dyke and a little maid as my servants. Lucy
was near my own age, and looked after the house well. I was blind,
you see, my dear," said Margaret, softly "and could do
nothing for myself. Dear Lord but I have had to earn my own living
since then."</p>

<p>Overcome by bitter memories, she paused for a moment. Hagar did
not dare to break the silence; and in a short time Margaret resumed
her tale.</p>

<p>"Also, I had a dear friend called Jane Lorrimer, who lived
near with her parents, and who visited me constantly. We were like
sisters, and I loved her better than any one in the world till John
Mask came to Christchurch. He was visiting the rector of the
parish, and I met him. Although I never saw his face, I was told
that he was very handsome; and he had a sweet low voice, which
charmed me greatly. You know, my dear, how we poor blind folk love
a sympathetic voice. Well, I loved John, but I had no idea that
there would be any return of that love; for how could a blind girl
hope that a handsome young man would look on
her&mdash;especially," added Margaret in a melancholy tone,
"when Jane was so handsome?"</p>

<p>"But he did not love Jane," observed Hagar,
significantly.</p>

<p>"No," said the blind woman, proudly; "he loved
me, and this he told me after we had known each other a year. We
became engaged, and life was then at its brightest for me. However,
he was going out to India to be a tea-planter; and he said when he
was settled there and had made a fair amount of money that he would
send for me. Alas! alas! that promise was never kept."</p>

<p>"Why wasn't it?" asked Hagar, bluntly.</p>

<p>"Who can tell?" said Margaret, sadly. "Not I;
not Jane. She was as surprised as I was when the end came. Although
blind, my dear, I can write fairly well, and John made me promise
to correspond with him. I did so for more than a year, and he
answered faithfully."</p>

<p>"Who read his letters to you?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes Jane, sometimes Lucy Dyke. Ah! they were both
good friends to me in my trouble. At first John's letters
were very affectionate, but as the months went by they grew colder
and colder. Oftentimes Jane said that she would not read them to
me. I wrote to John asking the meaning of this change; but his
replies were not satisfactory. At last, eighteen months after his
departure, I received back my letters."</p>

<p>"Really! Did Jane or Lucy bring them to you?"</p>

<p>"No; Jane was absent in London seeing friends; and Lucy at
the moment was out of the house. The little maid brought me the
packet. I opened it, thinking it might be a present from John, as
he had given me nothing but the silver teapot, which he presented
to me before he departed. I made the little maid wait till I opened
the packet; and I asked her to read the letter from John
enclosed."</p>

<p>"Did she?"</p>

<p>"Yes; oh, the pain of it!" cried Margaret. "He
said that it was best that our engagement should end, and that he
returned to me my letters, thirteen in all. Not an excuse, or a
sigh, or a regret. Only two curt, cruel lines, breaking off our
engagement, and the packet of my letters. I was distracted with
grief; and I placed the letters in my bosom while I
wept."</p>

<p>"What did Lucy say when she returned?"</p>

<p>"She was very angry with the little maid for having read
the letter to me and causing me such pain. She wanted me to destroy
my own letters, but I refused. I kept them by me day and night;
John had touched them, and they were all that remained to me of
him. Then I saw that my romance was dead and done with. I took my
own letters and those he had written me, and tying them up in a
bundle, I placed them with my own hands in the silver teapot. Then
I went to a jeweler, and had the lid closed. It has not been opened
since."</p>

<p>"Did you tell Lucy or Jane that you had done
this?"</p>

<p>"I told no one. I kept my own secret, and none guessed
what the teapot contained of my one hour of happiness. Then shortly
afterwards misfortunes fell on me. I lost my money through the
wickedness of my trustee, and had to give up my house and dismiss
Lucy and my little maid. Jane went out to India to an uncle, and
she took with her Lucy as maid. In six months from her departure I
heard that she had married John Mask."</p>

<p>"Did she write and tell you so?"</p>

<p>"No; she never wrote to me, nor did he. As for myself,
after receiving back my letters with those cruel two lines, after
enshrining them in the teapot, I strove to forget him. I never
wrote a line to him; I never mentioned him. He had treated me
cruelly, and he was dead to me. That was the end of my romance, my
dear."</p>

<p>"And how did you come to London?"</p>

<p>"I lost my all, as I told you," said Margaret,
simply; "and, as I could not bear to live poor where I had
been well off, I left Christchurch and came to London. Oh, my dear,
why should I tell you of the miseries I endured! Blind and poor and
friendless, I suffered greatly; but it was all nothing compared to
the suffering of that hour when John broke my heart. Finally, I
drifted here, to earn my bread by weaving baskets; and here I die.
Alas! poor Margaret Snow!"</p>

<p>"And John Mask and his wife?"</p>

<p>"They live in the West End, in Berkeley Square, rich and
prosperous, with sons and daughters by their side. Lucy is the
housekeeper. Oh, I learnt it all from a friend of mine in
Christchurch. Ah! how happy&mdash;how happy they are!"</p>

<p>"Did you reveal yourself to them?"</p>

<p>"No. Why should I? They would not care for me to haunt
them like a ghost of the past. They are rich and honored and
happy."</p>

<p>"And you lie here, poor and dying!" said Hagar,
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Yes; it is hard&mdash;hard. But I must not complain. God
has sent you to me to make my last moments happy. You are
good&mdash;good, my dear. You have done much for me; but one thing
more you must do. Open the teapot."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Hagar, in surprise&mdash;"open
what has been closed for thirty years!"</p>

<p>"Yes; I wish you to read me John's letters before I
die. Let me go to my rest knowing that he loved me once. To-morrow,
my dear, you must do this for me. Promise."</p>

<p>"I promise," said Hagar, folding the blankets over
her. "To-morrow I shall have the teapot opened, and bring you
the letters&mdash;your own and John Mask's."</p>

<p>With this promise she took her leave for the night, after first
seeing that Margaret was warm and comfortable. In her own bed,
Hagar meditated on the sadness of the story which had been told to
her, on the passionate love of the man for the blind woman, which
had died away so strangely. That he should have ceased to love
Margaret was not uncommon, as men, particularly when absent, are
only too often prone to forget those they leave at home; but it was
curious that he should have married Jane Lorrimer. A doubt stole
into Hagar's mind as to whether Margaret had been treated
fairly; whether there might not have been other reasons for the
sudden ending of her romance than she knew of. For such suspicion
Hagar had no grounds to go upon; but all the same she could not rid
her mind of the doubt. Perhaps the letters might set it at rest;
perhaps all had happened as Margaret had told. Nevertheless, Hagar
was anxious that the morrow should come&mdash;that the teapot
should be opened and the letters read. Then she would learn if
treachery and woman's wiles had parted the lovers, or if the
story was merely one&mdash;as Margaret believed&mdash;of a
faithless man and a broken-hearted woman.</p>

<p>The next day Hagar left the shop in charge of Bolker, and took
the silver teapot to a jeweler in the adjacent thoroughfare. He
soon melted the solder, and opened the lid. Within, beneath a pile
of dried rose-leaves, she found the packet of letters, tied up with
a blue ribbon. There was something sacrilegious to her imaginative
mind, in thus disturbing the relics of this dead-and-done-with
romance; and it was with reverent care that Hagar carried the
teapot and its contents to the house in Carby's Crescent.
After thirty years of moldering under the rose-leaves, these
letters, yellow and faded, were restored to the light of day; and
the woman who had written them when young and fair was now lying
withered and dying in the winter of her age. Hagar was profoundly
moved as she sat by that humble bedside with the ancient
love-letters on her lap.</p>

<p>"Read them all," said Margaret, with the tears
running down her face; "read the letters of John in which he
told me of his love thirty years ago. Thirty years! Ah, dear God!
when I was young and fresh! Oh, oh, oh! Youth and love!" she
wept, beating the bedclothes with trembling hands&mdash;"love
and youth! Gone! gone!&mdash;and I lie dying!"</p>

<p>Steadying her voice with an effort in the presence of this
sacred grief, Hagar read the letters written from India by the
absent lover. There were ten or twelve of them&mdash;charming
letters, full of pure and undying love. From first to last there
was no sentiment but what breathed devotion and trust. The writer
spoke tenderly of his poor blind love; he promised to make her her
path with roses, and in every way to show himself worthy of honor
and affection. Up to the twelfth letter there was not a hint of
parting or of a desire to break off the engagement; only in the
thirteenth letter&mdash;two curt lines, as Margaret had
said&mdash;came the announcement, with the swiftness and
unexpectedness of a thunderbolt. "It is better that our
engagement should end," wrote John, coldly; "therefore
I return you the thirteen letters you wrote me." And that was
all. This unexpected communication, coming so suddenly after the
fervor of the dozen letters, took away Hagar's breath.</p>

<p>"Excepting in the last I do not see anything cruel or cold
in these letters, Miss Snow," said Hagar, when she had ended
her reading.</p>

<p>Margaret put up one thin hand to her head. "No, no,"
she stammered, confusedly; "and yet I am sure John wrote
cruelly. It is so long ago that perhaps I forget; but his last
letters were cold, and hinted at a desire that we should part. I
remember Jane and Lucy reading them to me."</p>

<p>"I don't see any hint of that," replied Hagar,
doubtfully; "in fact, in the last two or three he asks, as
you have heard, why you wish the marriage postponed."</p>

<p>"I never wished that!" murmured Margaret, perplexed.
"I wanted to marry John and be with him always. Certainly I
never said such a thing when I wrote to him. Of that I am
sure."</p>

<p>"We can soon prove it," said Hagar, taking up the
other packet. "Here are your letters to John&mdash;all of
them. Shall I read them?"</p>

<p>Receiving an eager assent, the girl arranged the epistles in
order of dates, and read them slowly. They were scrawled rather
than written, in the large, childish handwriting of the blind; and
most of them were short, but the first six were full of love and a
desire to be near John. The seventh letter, which was better
written than the previous ones, breathed colder sentiments; it
hinted that the absent lover could do better than marry a blind
girl, who might be a drag on him, it said.</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" cried Margaret, breathlessly. "I
never wrote that letter!"</p>

<p>She was sitting up in the bed, with her gray hair pushed off her
thin, eager face; and turning her sightless eyes towards Hagar, she
seemed almost to see the astonished face of the girl in the
intensity of her desire.</p>

<p>"I never wrote that letter!" repeated Margaret, in a
shrill voice of excitement; "you are making some
mistake."</p>

<p>"Indeed I read only what is written," said Hagar;
"let me continue. When I finish the other five letters we
shall discuss them. But I fear&mdash;I fear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You fear what?"</p>

<p>"That you have been deceived. Wait&mdash;wait! say nothing
until I finish reading."</p>

<p>Margaret sank back on her pillow with a gray face and quick
in-drawn breathing. She dreaded what was coming, as Hagar well
knew; so the girl continued hurriedly to read the letters, lest she
should be interrupted. They were all&mdash;that is, the last five
or six&mdash;written in better style of handwriting than the former
ones; and each letter was colder than the last. The writer did not
want to leave her quiet English home for distant India. She was
afraid that the engagement was a mistake; when she consented to the
marriage she did not know her own mind. Moreover, Jane Lorrimer
loved him; she was&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jane!" interrupted Margaret, with a
cry&mdash;"what had Jane to do with my love for John? I never
wrote those last letters; they are forgeries!"</p>

<p>"Indeed they look like it," said Hagar, examining
the letters; "the handwriting is that of a person who can
see&mdash;much better than the writing of the early
letters."</p>

<p>"I always wrote badly," declared Margaret,
feverishly. "I was blind; it was hard for me to pen a letter.
John did not expect&mdash;expect&mdash;oh, dear Lord, what does it
all mean?"</p>

<p>"It means that Jane deceived you."</p>

<p>"Deceived me!" wailed Margaret,
feebly&mdash;"deceived her poor blind friend! No,
no!"</p>

<p>"I am certain of it!" said Hagar, firmly.
"When you told me your story, I was doubtful of Jane; now
that I have read those forged letters&mdash;for forged they
are&mdash;I am certain of it. Jane deceived you, with the aid of
Lucy!"</p>

<p>"But why, dear Lord, why?"</p>

<p>"Because she loved John and wished to marry him. You stood
in the way, and she removed you. Well, she gained her wish; she
parted you from John, and became Mrs. Mask."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it; Jane was my friend."</p>

<p>"Naturally; and for that reason deceived you," said
Hagar, bitterly. "Oh, I know well what friendship is! But we
must find out the truth. Tell me the exact address of Mrs.
Mask."</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>"Because I shall call and see her. I shall learn the
truth, and right you in the eyes of John."</p>

<p>"What use?" wept Margaret, bitterly. "My life
is over, and I am dying. What use?"</p>

<p>Feeble and hopeless, she would have made no effort herself; but
Hagar was determined that the secret, buried in the silver teapot
for thirty years, should be known, if not to the world, at least to
John Mask. These many days he had deemed Margaret faithless, and
had married a woman who, he believed, gave him that love which the
blind girl had refused. Now he should learn that the wife was the
traitress, that the rejected woman had been true and faithful even
unto death. Hagar made up her mind to this course, and forcing the
address from the unwilling lips of Margaret, she went the very next
day to the stately mansion in Berkeley Square. So came Nemesis to
the faithless friend after the lapse of thirty years. The justice
of the gods is slow, but it is certain.</p>

<p>Margaret lay weeping in her bed. As yet her feeble brain could
not grasp the truth. John, whom she had believed faithless, had
been true; and in his eyes all these years it was she who had been
cruel. To her all was confusion and doubt. Not until the afternoon
of the next day did she learn the truth for certain. It was Hagar
who told it to her.</p>

<p>"I went to the house in Berkeley Square," said
Hagar, "and I asked for Mrs. Mask. She was out, and I saw the
housekeeper&mdash;none other than your former servant, Lucy Dyke;
Mrs. Jael now," added the girl,
contemptuously&mdash;"well off, trusted, and comfortable.
That is the reward of her treachery."</p>

<p>"No, no! Lucy&mdash;surely she did not deceive
me?"</p>

<p>"I made her confess it," said Hagar, sternly.
"I told her of the letters in the teapot; of your hard life,
and of your dying bed. At first she denied everything; but when I
threatened to tell Mr. Mask the wretch confessed the truth. Yes, my
poor Miss Snow, you were deceived&mdash;bitterly deceived&mdash;by
your friend and your servant. They made a sport of your blindness
and love."</p>

<p>"Cruel! cruel!" moaned Margaret, trembling
violently.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was cruel; but it is the way of the world,"
said Hagar, with bitterness. "It seems that Jane was in love
with your John; but as he was true to you, she could not hope to
marry him. Determined, however, to do so, she bribed Lucy with
money, and the pair resolved to part you from John by means of
lying letters. Those you wrote to India never reached him. Instead
of your epistles, Jane wrote those which I read to you, urging a
breaking-off of the engagement, and hinting at her own love. John
thought they came from you, and wrote back&mdash;as you have heard
<i>now</i>&mdash;asking why you wished the marriage broken off.
When Lucy or Jane read the letters to you thirty years ago, they
altered the sense so that you should think John cruel. But why
explain further?" cried Hagar, with a burst of deep anger.
"You saw&mdash;you know how they succeeded. John broke off
the engagement and sent you back your letters. For that your
treacherous enemies were not prepared. If Lucy had been in the
house, you would never have received the packet. No wonder she
wanted you to burn the letters, seeing that the forged ones were
amongst them. Had you not hidden them away in the silver teapot,
Lucy would have found means to destroy them. However, you know how
they have been perserved these thirty years, to prove the truth at
last. Revenge yourself, Miss Snow! Jane is the honored wife of
John; Lucy is the confidential housekeeper, comfortable and happy.
Tell John the truth, and punish these vixens!"</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do? What can I do?" cried
Margaret. "I do not want to be cruel, but they ruined my
life. Jane&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is coming to see you; and John also," said
Hagar, rapidly. "The two will be here in an hour. Then you
can denounce the treachery of Jane, and show John those letters to
prove it. Ruin her! She ruined you."</p>

<p>Margaret said nothing. She was a religious woman, and nightly
recited the Lord's Prayer; "Forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive them that trespass against us." Now&mdash;and
in no idle fashion&mdash;she was called upon to prove the depth of
her belief&mdash;the extent of her charity. She was asked to
forgive her bitterest enemies those two women who had ruined her
life, and who had built up prosperous existences on such ruins. It
was hard to say "Go in peace" to these. Hagar was
implacable, and urged revenge; but Margaret&mdash;weak, sweet
soul&mdash;leant to the side of charity. Waiting the arrival of her
false friend, her lost lover, she prayed for guidance and for
strength to sustain her in the coming ordeal. It was the last and
most painful phase of her long, long martyrdom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mask arrived an hour later, as Hagar had announced, but
alone. Her husband had been detained by business, she explained to
the girl, and would come on later. Like herself, he was anxious to
see their dying friend.</p>

<p>"Does he know the truth?" asked Hagar before
admitting the visitor.</p>

<p>Jane was now a large and prosperous woman, with an imperious
temper, and in an ordinary case would have replied sharply. But the
discovery of her treachery, the knowledge that her victim was
dying, had broken her down entirely. With a pale face and quivering
lips, she shook her head, and signed that she could not bring
herself to speak. Hagar stood aside and permitted her to pass in
silence. She would have lashed the perfidious woman with her
tongue, but deemed it more just that the traitress should be
punished by the friend she had wronged so bitterly. Mrs. Mask
entered the room, and slowly walked over to the bedside. The blind
woman recognized her footstep: yes! recognized it, even after these
many years.</p>

<p>"Jane," said Margaret, reproachfully, "have
you come to look at your work?"</p>

<p>The prosperous lady recoiled as she saw the wreck of the merry,
happy girl she had known thirty years before. Tongue-tied by the
knowledge that Margaret spoke truly, she could only stand like a
culprit beside the bed, and like a culprit await her sentence.
Hagar remained at the door to listen.</p>

<p>"Have you nothing to say?" gasped Margaret,
faintly&mdash;"you who lied about me with your
accomplice&mdash;who made my John believe me faithless? My John!
alas, he has been yours&mdash;won by dishonor&mdash;these thirty
years!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I loved him!" stammered the other woman at
last, goaded into defending herself.</p>

<p>"Yes, you loved him and betrayed me. For years I have
suffered hunger and cold; for years I have lived with a broken
heart, alone and miserably!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, I am sorry!"</p>

<p>"Sorry! Can your sorrow give me back thirty years of
wasted life&mdash;of long-enduring agony? Can sorrow make me what I
should have been&mdash;what you are&mdash;a happy wife and
mother?"</p>

<p>"Margaret," implored Jane, sinking on her knees,
"forgive me! In spite of all my prosperity, I have suffered
in secret. My sin has come home to me many a time, and made me
weep. I searched for you when I returned to England; I could not
find you. Now I am willing to make what expiation you
wish."</p>

<p>"Then tell your husband how you tricked him and ruined
me."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no! Anything but that, Margaret! For God's
sake! I should die of shame if he knew. He loves me now; we are
old; we have children. Two of my boys are in the army; my daughter
is a wife and mother. What you will, but not that; it would destroy
all; it would kill me!"</p>

<p>She bowed her head on the bed-clothes and wept. Margaret
reflected. Her revenge was within her grasp. John was coming, and a
word from her would make him loathe the woman he had loved and
honored these many years&mdash;would make him despise the mother of
his children. No, she could not be so cruel as to ruin the innocent
to punish the guilty. Besides, Jane had loved him, and it was that
love which had made her sin. Margaret raised herself feebly, and
laid her thin hand on the head of the woman who had martyrized
her.</p>

<p>"I forgive you, Jane. Go in peace. John shall never
know."</p>

<p>Jane lifted up her face in amazement at this God-like
forgiveness. "You will not tell him?" she muttered.</p>

<p>"No. No one shall tell him. Hagar, swear to me that you
will keep silent."</p>

<p>"I swear," said Hagar, a little sullenly. "But
you are wrong."</p>

<p>"No; I am right. To gain forgiveness we must forgive
others. My poor Jane, you were tempted, and you fell. Of Lucy I
shall say nothing; God will bring home her sin to her in&mdash;Ah!
dear Lord! Hagar! I&mdash;I&mdash;I die!"</p>

<p>Hagar ran to the bedside, and placed her arms round the lean
frame of poor Margaret. Her face was gray, her eyes glazed, and her
body fell back in the arms of Hagar like a dead thing. She was
dying; the end of her martyrdom was at hand.</p>

<p>"Give! give&mdash;" she whispered, striving to raise
one feeble hand.</p>

<p>"The teapot!" said Hagar. "Quick&mdash;give it
to her!"</p>

<p>Jane seized the teapot&mdash;ignorant that it contained the
letters which proved her guilt&mdash;and placed it in the hands of
the poor soul. She clasped it feebly to her breast, and a smile of
delight crept slowly over her gray face.</p>

<p>"John's gift!" she faltered,
and&mdash;died.</p>

<p>A moment later the door was pushed open, and a portly man with
gray hair entered the room. He saw Jane sobbing by the bedside,
Hagar kneeling with tears in her eyes, and on the bed the dead body
of the woman he had loved.</p>

<p>"I am too late," said he, approaching. "Poor
Margaret!"</p>

<p>"She has just died," whispered Hagar. "Take
your wife away."</p>

<p>"Come, my dear," said John, raising the repentant
woman; "we can do no good. Poor Margaret! to think that she
would not marry me! Well, it is best so; God has given me a good
and true wife in her place."</p>

<p>"A good and true wife!" muttered Hagar, with
irony.</p>

<p>With Jane on his arm, the former lover of Margaret moved towards
the door. "I shall of course see to the funeral," he
said in a pompous tone. "She shall be buried like a
princess."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Mask!&mdash;and she lived like a
beggar!"</p>

<p>A faint flush of color crept into the man's cheeks,
withered with age. "That was not my fault," he said,
haughtily; "had I known of her wants, I would have helped
her; though, indeed," he added, bitterly, "she deserves
little at the hands of one whom she wronged so deeply. I loved her,
and she was faithless."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Hagar, and for the moment she felt
inclined to tell the truth, but the memory of her promise
restrained her; also a glance at the white face of Jane, who
thought that her secret was about to be revealed.</p>

<p>"What do you say?" asked John, looking back.</p>

<p>"Nothing. But&mdash;the silver teapot?"</p>

<p>"My gift. Let it be buried with her."</p>

<p>He passed through the door without another word, leaving Hagar
alone with the dead. Had he known of the contents of the teapot
which the dead woman held clasped in her arms, he might not have
departed with his wife by his side. But he went out ignorant and
happy.</p>

<p>Hagar looked at the retiring forms of the married pair; at the
white face of the dead woman at the bare, bleak room and the silver
teapot. Then she laughed!</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>Chapter VIII<br>
The Seventh Customer And The Mandarin</b>
</h2>

<p>THERE was something very queer about that lacquer mandarin; and
something still queerer about the man who pawned it. The toy itself
was simply two balls placed together; the top ball, a small one,
was the head, masked with a quaintly-painted face of porcelain, and
surmounted by a pagoda-shaped hat jingling with tiny golden bells.
The large ball below was the body, gaily tinted to imitate the
official dress of a great Chinese lord; and therefrom two little
arms terminating in porcelain hands, exquisitely finished even to
the long nails, protruded in a most comical fashion. Weighted
dexterously within, the mandarin would keel over this side and
that, to a perilous angle, but he never went over altogether. When
set in motion the big ball would roll, the arms would wag, and the
head nod gravely, a little red tongue thrusting itself out at every
bow. Then the golden bells would chime melodiously, and rolling,
wagging, nodding, the mandarin made all who beheld him laugh, with
his innocent antics. He was worthy, in all his painted beauty, to
be immortalized by Hans Andersen.</p>

<p>"A very pretty toy?" said Hagar, as the quaint thing
tipped itself right and left, front and back. "It comes from
China, I suppose?"</p>

<p>She asked this question of the customer, who demanded two pounds
on the figure; but in place of answering her, he burst out into a
hoarse laugh, and leered unpleasantly at the girl.</p>

<p>"Comes from other side of Nowhere, I reckon,
missus!" he said, in a coarse voice; "and a
bloomin' rum piece of goods 'tis, anyhow!"</p>

<p>Hagar did not like the man's looks at all, although she
was by no means exacting on the score of personal
beauty&mdash;especially with regard to the male sex. Still, there
was something brutal about this fellow which revolted her every
sense. He had a bullet-head, with a crop of closely-cut hair; a
clean-shaven face of a blue-black dirty hue, where the beard had
been removed; a low forehead, a snub nose, a large ugly mouth, and
two cunning gray eyes which never looked any one straight in the
face. This attractive gentleman wore a corduroy suit, a red linen
handkerchief round his throat, and a fur cap with earflaps on his
head. Also he carried a small black pipe between his teeth, and
breathed therefrom an atmosphere of the vilest tobacco. Certainly
the toy was queer; but the man queerer. Not at all the sort of
person likely to be in possession of so delicate a work of Chinese
art and fancy.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this?" demanded Hagar, drawing
her black brows together and touching with one finger the swaying
mandarin.</p>

<p>"It's all on the square, missus!" growled the
man in an injured tone. "I didn't prig the blessed
thing, if that's yer lay. A pal o' mine as is a sailor
brought it from Lord-knows-where an' guv' it me. I
wants rhino, I do; so if you kin spring two quid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll give you twenty shillings," said Hagar,
cutting him short.</p>

<p>"Oh, my bloomin' eyes! if this ain't robbery
an' blue murder!" whined the man; "twenty bob!
why, the fun you gits out of it's worth more!"</p>

<p>"That's my offer&mdash;take it or leave it. I
don't believe you came honestly by it, and I'm running
a risk in taking it."</p>

<p>"Sling us the blunt, then!" said the customer,
sullenly; "it's the likes of you as grinds down the
likes of me! Yah! you an' yer preachin'."</p>

<p>"In whose name am I to make out the ticket?" asked
Hagar, coldly.</p>

<p>"In the name of Mister William Smith&mdash;Larky Bill they
calls me; but 'tain't hetiikit to put
h'endearin' family names on pawn-tickets. I lives in
Sawder Alley, Whitechapel."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you go to a nearer pawn-shop,
then?" said Hagar, taking down Mr. Smith's address,
without smiling at his would-be wit.</p>

<p>"That's my biz!" retorted Bill, scowling.
"'Ere, gimme the tin; an' don't you arsk no
questions an' you won't be tol' no lies!
D'ye see?"</p>

<p>Hagar stamped her foot. "Here's the money and the
ticket. Take yourself and your insolence out of my shop.
Quick!"</p>

<p>"I'm gitting!" growled the man, shuffling
towards the door. "See 'ere, missus; I comes fur that
doll in three months, or it may be four. If it ain't all
right an' 'anded up to me proper, I'll break your
neck!"</p>

<p>"What's that you say?"</p>

<p>Hagar was over the counter, and close at hand by this time.
Larky Bill stared open-mouthed at her spirit. "You say
another word, my jail-bird," said Hagar, seizing his ear,
"and I'll put you into the gutter!"</p>

<p>"Lordy! what a donah!" muttered Bill, rubbing his
ear when he found himself outside. "She'll look arter
the toy proper. Three months. Tck!" he rapped his thumbnail
against his teeth. "I can't get less from the beak; but
I've bested Monkey anyhow!"</p>

<p>And with these enigmatic words, Mr. Smith turned on his heel and
went to Whitechapel There his forebodings were realized, for at the
very door of his own house in Sawder Alley, he was taken in charge
by a grim policeman, and sent to prison for four months. He had
stolen some fruit off a coster's barrow on the day previous
to his arrest, and quite expected to be&mdash;as he phrased
it&mdash;nabbed for the theft. Therefore he employed the small
remnant of freedom still remaining to him in pawning the mandarin
in the most distant pawn-shop he could think of, which happened to
be Hagar's. As Mr. Smith left the court to do his four
months, a wizen-faced man slouched close to him.</p>

<p>"Bill," he growled, edging against the policeman,
"where's that doll?"</p>

<p>"That's all right, Monkey! I've put it where
you won't git it!" grunted Smith.</p>

<p>When Black Maria rolled away with Bill inside, the man he had
called Monkey stood on the edge of the pavement and cursed freely
till a policeman moved him on. He had a particular desire to gain
possession of that doll, as he called it; and it was on this
account that Larky Bill had taken the trouble to hide it. Monkey
never thought of a pawn-shop. It was a case of diamond cut diamond;
and one rogue had outwitted the other.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Hagar, quite unaware of the value attached to
the Chinese toy, placed it away among other pawned articles upon a
high shelf. But it did not always remain there, for Bolker, a child
in many ways, notwithstanding his precocious intelligence, found it
out, and frequently took it down to play with. Hagar would not have
permitted this had she known, as the toy was given into her charge
to keep safe, and she would have been afraid of Bolker spoiling the
painting or rubbing off the gilding. Bolker knew this, and was
clever enough to play with the mandarin only when Hagar was absent.
He placed it on the counter, and made it sway in its quaint
fashion. The waving arms, the nodding head, and the roseleaf of a
tongue slipping in and out, enchanted the lad, and he would amuse
himself for hours with it. It was strange that a gilded toy, no
doubt made for the amusement of grave Chinese Emperors, should
descend to afford pleasure to an arab of London City. But the
mandarin was an exile from the Flowery Land, and rocked as merrily
in the dingy pawn-shop as ever he had done in the porcelain palaces
of Pekin.</p>

<p>A month or two after the mandarin had been pawned, Bolker
announced in the most unexpected manner that he intended to better
himself. He had been given, he said, the post of shop-boy in a
West-end bookseller's establishment; and as he was fond of
literature, he intended to accept it. Hagar rather wondered that
any one should have placed sufficient confidence in this arab to
give him a situation; but she kept her wonderment to herself, and
permitted him to go. She was sorry to lose the benefit of his acute
intelligence, but personally she had no great love for this
scampish hunchback; so she saw him depart without displaying much
sorrow. Thus Bolker vanished from the pawn-shop and from
Carby's Crescent, and ascended into higher spheres.</p>

<p>Nothing new happened after his departure. The mandarin remained
untouched on the shelf, and the dust collected over his motionless
figure. Hagar quite forgot about the toy and its pawner; and it was
only when Larky Bill was released from prison and came to claim his
property that she recalled the incident. She took down the figure,
dusted it carefully, and set it swaying on the counter before Mr.
Smith. Neither Bill nor Hagar noticed that it did not roll as
easily and gracefully as usual.</p>

<p>"Here's the quid and interest and ticket,"
said Bill, tendering all three. "I'm glad to get this
'ere back again. No one's touched it, 'ave
they?"</p>

<p>"No. It has been on that shelf ever since you pawned it.
Where have you been?"</p>

<p>Larky Bill grinned. "I've been stayin' at a
country 'ouse of mine fur my' ealth's
sake," he said, tucking the mandarin under his arm.
"Say, missus, a cove called Monkey didn't come
smellin' round 'ere fur this h'image?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of. Nobody asked for the toy."</p>

<p>"Guess it's all right," chuckled Bill,
gleefully. "Lord, to think as how I've done that bloke!
Won't he cuss when he knows as I've got em!"</p>

<p>What "them" were Mr. Smith did not condescend to
explain at that particular moment. He nodded familiarly to Hagar,
and went off, still chuckling with the mandarin in charge. Hagar
put away the money, and thought that she had seen the last of Bill;
but she reckoned wrongly. Two hours afterwards he was back in the
shop, mandarin and all, with a pale face, a wild eye, and a mouth
full of abuse. At first he swore at large without giving any
explanation; so Hagar waited till the bad language was ended, and
then asked him quietly what was the matter. For answer Bill plumped
down the Chinese toy on the counter, and clutched his fur cap with
both hands.</p>

<p>"Matter, cuss you!" he shrieked,
furiously&mdash;"as if ye didn't know! I've been
robbed!"</p>

<p>"Robbed! What nonsense are you talking And what have I to
do with your being robbed?"</p>

<p>Bill gasped, and pointed to the mandarin, who was rolling
complacently, with a fat smile on his porcelain visage.
"That&mdash;that doll!" he spluttered.
"I've been robbed!"</p>

<p>"Of the doll?" asked Hagar, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Y' young Jezebel! Of the
dimins&mdash;dimins!"</p>

<p>"Diamonds!" echoed the girl, starting back in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes! Y' know, hang you, y' know! Twenty
thousan' pount of dimins! They was in that doll&mdash;inside
'im. They ain't there now! Why not? 'Cause
you've robbed me! Thief! Yah!"</p>

<p>"I did not know that there were any jewels concealed in
the mandarin," said Hagar, calmly. "Had I known I
should have informed the police."</p>

<p>"Blown the gaff, would ye? An' why?"</p>

<p>"Because a man in your position does not possess diamonds,
unless he steals them. And now I think of it," added Hagar,
quickly, "about the time you pawned this toy Lady
Deacey's jewels were stolen. You stole them!"</p>

<p>"P'raps I did, p'raps I didn't!"
growled Bill, mentally cursing Hagar for the acuteness of her
understanding. "'Tany rate, 'twarn't your
biz to prig 'em!"</p>

<p>"I tell you I never touched them! I did not know they were
in there!"</p>

<p>"Then who did, cuss you? When I guv you the doll, the
dimins were inside; now they ain't. Who took
'em?"</p>

<p>Hagar pondered. It was certainly odd that the diamonds should
have been stolen. She had placed the mandarin on the shelf on the
day of its pawning, and had not removed it again until she had
returned it to its owner. Seeing her silent, Bill turned the toy
upside down, and removed a square morsel of the lacquer, which
fitted in so perfectly as to seem like one whole piece. Within was
the dark hollow of the ball&mdash;empty.</p>

<p>"I put them dimins into 'ere with my own
'and," persisted Bill, pointing one grimy finger at the
gap; "they were 'ere when I popped it; they ain't
'ere now. Where are they? Who's bin playing with my
property?"</p>

<p>"Bolker!" cried Hagar, without thinking. It had just
flashed across her mind that one day she had found Bolker amusing
himself with the mandarin. At the time she had thought nothing of
it, but had replaced the toy on its shelf, and forbidden the lad to
meddle with it. But now, recalling the episode, and connecting it
with Bolker's sudden departure, she felt convinced that the
imp had stolen the concealed jewels. But&mdash;as she
wondered&mdash;how had he become cognizant that twenty thousands
pounds' worth of diamonds was hidden in the hollow body of
the doll? The thing puzzled her.</p>

<p>"Bolker?" echoed Larky Bill, wrathfully. "And
who may that cuss be?"</p>

<p>"He was my shop-boy; but he left three months ago to
better himself."</p>

<p>"I dessay! With my dimins, I'll bet. Where is he,
that I may cut his bloomin' throat!"</p>

<p>"I shan't tell you," said Hagar, alarmed by
the brutal threat of the man, and already regretting that she had
been so candid.</p>

<p>"I'll make you! I'll twist your neck!"
raged Bill, mad with anger.</p>

<p>He placed his great hands on the counter to vault over; but the
next moment he dropped back before the shining tube of a neat
little revolver, which leveled itself in Hagar's hands. She
had lately purchased it for defense.</p>

<p>"I keep this always by me," said she, calmly,
"to protect myself against such rogues as you!"</p>

<p>Bill stared at her blankly, then turned on his heel and left the
shop. At the door he paused and shook his fist.</p>

<p>"I'll find that Bolker, and smash the life out of
him!" he said, hoarsely; "then, my fine madam,
I'll come back to lay you out!" after which he
vanished, leaving the mandarin, with its eternal smile, still
rocking on the counter.</p>

<p>Hagar put away the pistol, and took up the figure. Now that she
knew about the diamonds, and had forced Bill to admit, as he had
done indirectly, that they had been stolen from Lady Deacey, she
thought it possible that the Chinese toy might belong to the same
owner. In spite of her fearlessness, Hagar was not altogether happy
in her mind as regards the burglar. If he did not find the
diamonds, he was quite capable of returning to murder her. On the
whole, Hagar concluded that it would be just as well for society at
large, and herself in particular, if Mr. Smith were restored to the
prison whence he had lately emerged. After some consideration she
resolved to see Vark, the lawyer, and tell him the episode of the
mandarin, taking the image with her as evidence. Vark, if anyone,
would be able to deal with the intricacies of the affair.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Bill Smith had repaired to the public-house
which guarded the narrow entrance to Carby's Crescent, and
there was drowning his regrets in strong drink. As he drained his
tankard of ale, he fell into conversation with the fat
landlord&mdash;a brutal-looking prize-fighter, who looked as though
he had been in jail&mdash;quite a bird of Mr. Smith's
feather. These two congenial spirits recognized each other, and
became friendly&mdash;so friendly, indeed, that Bill thought it a
good opportunity to extract information regarding the whereabouts
of Bolker. He was too wise to explain his reason for making these
inquiries.</p>

<p>"That's a fine gal in the pawn-shop, hay!"
said he, with a leer.</p>

<p>"Wot&mdash;'Agar? She's a plum, ain't
she?&mdash;but not for every man's pickin'; oh, no; not
she! 'Agar kin look arter herself proper!" said the
landlord.</p>

<p>"Does she mind that shorp all alone?"</p>

<p>"Jus' now she does," replied mine host.
"She 'ad a boy, a wicked little 'unchback devil;
Bolker's 'is name. But he's hoff; gitting a wage
in West-end, as I do 'ear."</p>

<p>"Wes'-end?" said Bill, reflectively.
"An' where might 'e 'any out
there?"</p>

<p>"Ho, in a swell, slap-up book-shop. Juppins, Son an'
Juppins, Les'er Square way. 'Is parients live down
'ere, but Bolker's that set up with 'is good luck
as 'e looks down on 'em."</p>

<p>"Do he now!" said Bill, amiably. "I'd
twist 'is neck if he wos my kid. No more booze, thankee.
I'm orf t' see a pal o' mine."</p>

<p>The result of this conversation was that Mr. Smith repaired to
Leicester Square and loafed up and down the pavement before the
book-shop. He saw Bolker several times during the day; for, having
been told by the landlord that the lad was a hunchback, he had no
difficulty recognizing him. Up till the evening he kept a close
watch, and when Bolker had put up the shutters and was walking home
towards Lambeth, Bill followed him stealthily. All unknowing that
he was followed by a black shadow of crime and danger, Bolker
paused on Westminster Bridge to admire the red glories of the
sunset; then plunged into the network of alleys which make up
Lambeth. In a quiet lane by the river he was gripped from behind; a
large hand was clapped over his mouth to prevent his crying out,
and he was dragged down on to a ruined wharf which ran out through
green slime into the turbid waters of the stream.</p>

<p>"Now, then, I've got ye!" said his captor in a
savage tone&mdash;"an' I've got a knife too,
y' bloomin' thief! Jes' y' answer me
strife, or I'll cut yer 'ead orf!"</p>

<p>Bolker gasped with alarm; but, not recognizing the threatening
face of the man before him, he recovered a little of his native
impudence, and began to bluster.</p>

<p>"Here, now, what do you mean by this? What have I
done?"</p>

<p>"Done, y' whelp! Opened that doll an' prigged
them dimins!"</p>

<p>"Larky Bill!" cried Bolker, at once recognizing his
peril. "Here, let me go!"</p>

<p>"Not till y' give up my property&mdash;my
dimins."</p>

<p>"What property? What diamonds?"</p>

<p>"Oh, y' know what 'm drivin' at, cuss
you! Y're the 'unchback as wos in the shorp kep'
by that foine gal 'Agar. I popped that doll, with dimins in
'is innards, an' you stole 'm."</p>

<p>"I did nothing of the sort. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Ere! drop yer lies, y' imp! Y' know
moy naime, y' did, so y' knows more! Jes' look et
this knoif! S'elp me but I'll slip it int' ye, ef
y' don't tell!"</p>

<p>He threw the terrified boy across his knee, and placed the cold
steel at his throat. The rose-red sky spun overhead in the eyes of
Bolker, and he thought that his last hour had come. To save himself
there was nothing for it but confession.</p>

<p>"What! wait! I'll tell you!" he gasped.
"I did take the diamonds."</p>

<p>"Y' young cuss!" growled Bill, setting the lad
on his feet again with a jerk. "An' 'ow did
y' know they was inside that himage?"</p>

<p>"Monkey told me."</p>

<p>Bill started to his feet with an oath, but still kept his grip
on Bolker's shoulder to prevent him getting away.
"Monkey," he said, fiercely. "Wot did 'e
tell y'?"</p>

<p>"Why, that Lady Deacey's diamonds were inside the
mandarin."</p>

<p>"How did Monkey come to find that doll?"</p>

<p>"He got the office from a girl called Eliza, who saw you
pawning the toy."</p>

<p>"Liz sold me," muttered Bill. "I thought as I
sawr'er on that doy. She' mus' ha' twigged
that doll under m' arm, and guessed as I popped it. Gord!
I'll deal with 'er laiter, I will! Garn, y' doryg
and tell me th' rest!" he added, shaking the boy.</p>

<p>"There is no more to tell," whimpered Bolker, his
teeth chattering. "Monkey couldn't get the mandarin,
'cause he had not the ticket. He made friends with me, and
asked me to steal it. I wouldn't, until he told me why he
wanted it. Then he said that you had stolen twenty thousand
pounds' worth of diamonds from Lady Deacey's house in
Curzon Street, and had hidden them in the mandarin. He said
we'd go whacks if I'd steal them for him. I
couldn't get the mandarin, as Hagar's so sharp she
would have missed it, and put me in jail for stealing it; so I
opened the doll, and took out the diamonds which were in a leather
bag."</p>

<p>"Moy bag, moy dimins!" said Bill, savagely.
"What did y' do with 'em?"</p>

<p>"I gave them to Monkey, and he cleared out with them. He
never gave me a single one; and I don't know where to find
him."</p>

<p>"I does," growled Mr. Smith, releasing Bolker,
"an' I'll fin' 'im and slit his
bloomin' throat. 'Ere! I say, y' come
back!" for, taking advantage of his release, Bolker was
racing up the wharf.</p>

<p>Bill gave chase, as he wanted to obtain further information from
the lad; but Bolker knew the neighborhood better than the burglar,
and soon eluded him in the winding alleys.</p>

<p>"It don't matter!" said Bill, giving up the
chase and wiping his brow. "Monkey's got the swag.
Might ha' guessed as he'd round on me. I'll jest
see 'im and Liz, and if I don't make 'm paiy fur
this, maiy I&mdash;!" Then he clinched his resolve with an
oath, which it is unnecessary to repeat here. After relieving his
feelings thus, he went in search of his perfidious friend, with
murderous thoughts in his heart.</p>

<p>At first he thought that it would be difficult to find Monkey.
No doubt the man on obtaining the diamonds had gone off to America,
North or South, so as to escape the vengeance of his pal&mdash;Bill
had always been Monkey's pal&mdash;and to live comfortably on
the fruits of his villainy. Later on the burglar learnt, rather to
his surprise, that Monkey was still in London, and still was
haunting the thieves' quarter in Whitechapel. Bill wondered
at this choice of a residence when the man had so much money in his
possession; but he ascribed this longing to Monkey's love for
his old haunts and associates. Nevertheless, knowing that Bill was
out of prison, it was strange that the man did not look after his
skin.</p>

<p>"'E knows wot I am when I'm riz!" said
Bill to himself, as he continued his search, "so he ought to
get orf while 'is throat ain't cut! Blimme; but
I'll 'ave a drop of 'is 'eart's blood
fur every one of them bloomin' dimins!"</p>

<p>One evening he found Monkey in the parlor of a low public-house
called the Three Kings, and kept by a Jew of ill-fame, who was
rather a fence than a landlord.</p>

<p>His traitorous friend, more wizened and shriveled up than ever,
was seated in a dark corner, with an unlighted pipe in his mouth, a
half-drained tankard of bitter before him, and his hands thrust
moodily into his pockets. If Monkey had the diamonds, his
appearance belied their possession, for he looked anything but
prosperous. There was no appearance of wealth in his looks or
manner or choice of abode.</p>

<p>"Wot, Bill, ole pal!" he said, looking up when Mr.
Smith hurled himself into the room. "Y've got
h'out of quod!"</p>

<p>"Yus! I've got h'out to slit yer
throat!"</p>

<p>"Lor!" whined Monkey, uncomfortably.
"Wot's you accusin' me fur? I ain't done
nuffin', s'elp me!"</p>

<p>Bill drew a chair before that of Monkey, and taking out his
knife played with it in a significant manner. Monkey shrank back
before the glitter of the blade and the ugly look in his
pal's eyes, but he did not dare to cry out for assistance,
lest the burglar should pounce on him.</p>

<p>"Now, look 'ee 'ere, Monkey," said Bill,
with grim deliberation, "I don't want none of yer
bloomin' lip, ner his eiather! D' y' see?
I've seen that beast of a kid as you put up to steal my
dimins, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yah! that kid!" cried Monkey, with sudden ferocity.
"Wish I'd 'im 'ere; I'd squeeze the
'eart out o' him!"</p>

<p>"Wot fur? Didn't 'e git y' the
swag&mdash;moy swag&mdash;cuss y'?"</p>

<p>"No, 'e didn't; an' ef 'e ses
'e did, 'e's a liar&mdash;a bloomin' busted
liar, s'elp me! I tell you, Bill, 'e kep' them
shiners to 'imself, cuss 'im!"</p>

<p>"Thet's a d&mdash;d lie, y' sneakin'
dorg!" said Bill, politely.</p>

<p>"M' I die if 'tain't gorspel
truth!" yelped Monkey. "Look 'ee 'ere, ole
pal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't y' call me pal!" interrupted
Bill, savagely. "I ain't no pal of yourn, y'
terbaccer-faiced son of a bloomin' 'angman! Liz blew
the gaff on me poppin' that himage, and y' tried to git
m' swag when I was doin' time. An' y' did
get it, y'&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I didn't!" snapped Monkey, interrupting in
his turn. "The kid stuck to the swag, I tell y'.
'Course I knowed of them dimins!"</p>

<p>"'Course y' did!" growled William,
ironically. "Didn't I tell y' 'ow I cracked
that crib in Curzon Street, an' prigged th' dimins
an' th' himage? Yah! y' cuss!"</p>

<p>"I knows y' did, Bill. An' you tole me
'ow y' stowed the swag inside the doll. My heye! that
was sharp of y'; but y' moight 'ev trusted a pal!
I didn't know y' popped the doll till Liz told me. She
sawr y' goin' in t' that popshorp with the Chiner
thing under yer arm; an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you'd set 'er arter me!" cried
Bill! savagely. "She didn't git int' Lambeth on
the chance!"</p>

<p>"Yus," said Monkey, doggedly, "I did put
'er on yer trail. Y' hid the dimins in that image, and
cleared out with it. I couldn't foller meself, so I set Liz
ont' ye. She tole me as 'ow y'd popped th'
thing; so when y' wos doin' time I tried to git it
again, tho' that young cuss 'es sold me."</p>

<p>"Blimme! but I've a moind to slit yer throat!"
said Bill, furiously. "Wot d' y' mean
tryin' to coller my swag?"</p>

<p>"Why, fur yer own sake, Bill, s'elp me. I thort the
gal might fin' out. But y' needn't git up, Bill;
I didn't git them dimins. The boy hes them."</p>

<p>"That's a lie. I tell y'!"</p>

<p>"'Tain't! When I tole the kid about the dimins
he stole 'em sure, an' lef' th' doll so es
the pawn-shop gal wouldn't fin' out. But I never saw
'im agin, though I watched the shorp like a bloomin'
tyke. The boy cleared out with them dimins. I wish I'd
'im 'ere! I'd choke the little
d&mdash;l!"</p>

<p>Bill reflected, and slipped the knife into his pocket. Without
doubt Monkey was speaking the truth; he was too savagely in earnest
to be telling a falsehood. Moreover, if he really possessed the
diamonds, he would not remain hard up and miserable in the
thieves' quarter of dingy Whitechapel. No; Bolker had kept
the jewels, and had deceived Monkey; more than that, in the
interview on the ruined wharf he had deceived Bill himself. Priding
himself on his astuteness, Mr. Smith felt savage at having been
sold by a mere boy.</p>

<p>"If I kin on'y git 'im agin!" he
thought, when leaving the Three Kings, "I'll take the
'ead orf 'm, and chuck 'is crooked karkuss
int' the river mud!"</p>

<p>But he found it difficult to lay hands on Bolker, although for
more than a week he haunted the shop in Leicester Square. Warned by
his one experience that Bill was a dangerous person to meddle with,
Bolker had given notice to his employers, and at present was in
hiding. Also, he was arranging a little scheme whereby to rid
himself of Larky Bill's inopportunities. Vark was the man who
undertook to carry out the details of the scheme; and Hagar was
consulted also with regard to its completion. These three people,
Vark, Hagar, and Bolker, laid an ingenious trap for unsuspecting
Bill, into which he walked without a thought of danger. He had been
betrayed by Monkey, by Bolker, by Liz; now he was going to be sold
by Vark, the lawyer. Truly, the fates were against Bill at this
juncture.</p>

<p>Vark was a thieves' lawyer, and had something in him of a
latter-day Fagin; for he not only made use of criminals when he
could do so with safety, but also he sold them to justice when they
became dangerous. As he saw a chance of making money out of Bill
Smith, he resolved to do so, and sent for the man to visit him at
once. As Vark had often done business with the burglar, Bill had no
idea that it was in the lawyer's mind to betray him, and duly
presented himself at the spider's office in Lambeth, like a
silly fly. The first thing he saw on entering the room was the
mandarin swaying on the table.</p>

<p>"You are astonished to see that," said Vark,
noticing his surprise. "I daresay; but you see, Bill, I know
all about your theft of the Deacey diamonds."</p>

<p>"Who tole you?" growled Bill, throwing himself into
a chair.</p>

<p>"Hagar of the Pawn-shop," replied Vark, slowly and
with significance.</p>

<p>Bill's eyes lighted up fiercely, in precisely the way Vark
wished. The lawyer had not forgiven Hagar for refusing to marry
him, and for curtailing his pickings in the Dix estate. For these
reasons he wished her evil; and if he could inoculate the
burglar's heart with a spite towards her he was bent on doing
so. It appeared from Bill's next speech that he had
succeeded.</p>

<p>"Oh, 'twas that gal, wos it?" said Mr. Smith,
quietly. "I might ha' guessed it, by seein' that
himage. Well, I owe 'er one, I do, and I guess I'll owe
'er another. But that's my biz; 'tain't
yourn. Wot d'ye want, y' measly dorg?" he added,
looking at the lean form of Vark in a surly manner.</p>

<p>"I want to see you about the Deacey diamonds. Why did you
not bring them to me when you stole them?"</p>

<p>"Whoy? 'Cause I didn't b'lieve in
ye!" retorted Bill. "I know'd I wos in fur toime
when I prigged them apples, an' I wasn't going to trust
my swag to y' or Monkey. Y'd ha' sold
me."</p>

<p>"Well, Monkey did sell you."</p>

<p>"Yah! 'e didn't get much on th'
deal!"</p>

<p>"No; but Bolker did."</p>

<p>"Bolker!" echoed Bill, grinding his teeth:
"d' y' know that crooked cuss? Y' do! Well,
see 'ere!"&mdash;Bill drew his clasp-knife out of his
pocket and opened it&mdash;"I'm goin' to slip
that int' 'im fust toime as I claps eyes on 'is
ugly mug!"</p>

<p>"You'd better not, unless you want to be
hanged."</p>

<p>"Wot d' I care?" growled Bill, sulkily;
"scragged, or time with skilly an' hoakum. It's
all th' saime t' me."</p>

<p>"I suppose you wonder where the diamonds are?"</p>

<p>"Yus. I want 'em!"</p>

<p>"That's a pity," said Vark, with
irony&mdash;"because I am afraid you won't get
them."</p>

<p>"Where is them dimins?" asked Bill, laying his open
knife on the table.</p>

<p>Vark passed over the question. "I suppose you know that
the police are after you for the Deacey robbery?" he said,
slipping his hand idly across the table till it was within reach of
the knife. "Oh, yes; Lord Deacey offered a reward for the
recovery of the jewels. That has been paid, but as you are still at
large, the police want you, my friend!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I ain't afraid of y' givin' me up;
I'm too useful t'y', I am, and I knows too much
about y'. The pealers shawn't put me in quod this
toime. Who got the reward?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Bolker got it."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n him! Bolker!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Monkey made a mistake when he trusted the lad.
Bolker thought that he would make more out of honesty than by going
shares with Monkey. When he found the jewels, he went off with them
to Scotland Yard. Lady Deacey has them now, and Bolkers,"
added Vark, smiling, "has money in the bank."</p>

<p>"Cuss 'im; whoy didn't I cut 'is
bloomin' throat down by the river?"</p>

<p>"That is best known to yourself," replied Vark, who
was now playing with the knife. "You are in a tight place, my
friend, and may get some years for this robbery."</p>

<p>"Yah! No one knows I did it!"</p>

<p>"There is the evidence against you," said Vark,
pointing to the mandarin. "You stole that out of Lord
Deacey's drawing-room along with the diamonds. You pawned it,
and Hagar can swear that you did so. Bolker can swear that the
stolen diamonds were inside. With these two witnesses, my poor
Bill, I'm afraid you'd get six years or
more!"</p>

<p>"Not me!" said Bill, rising. "Y'
won't give me up; and I ain't feared of any one
else."</p>

<p>"Why not? There is a reward offered for your
apprehension."</p>

<p>"What d' I care? Who'll git it?"</p>

<p>"I will!" replied Vark, coolly, rising.</p>

<p>"You?" Bill recoiled for a moment, and sprang
forward. "Cuss you! Y'd sell me, y' shark! Gimme
my knife!"</p>

<p>"Not such a fool, Mr. Smith!"</p>

<p>Vark threw the knife into a distant corner of the room, and
leveled a revolver at the bullet head of the advancing burglar.
Bill fell back for the moment&mdash;fell into the arms of two
policemen.</p>

<p>He gave a roar like a wild beast.</p>

<p>"Trapped, by&mdash;!" he yelled, and struggled to
get free.</p>

<p>The next moment Hagar and Bolker were in the room, and Bill
glared at one and the other.</p>

<p>"Y' trapped me, d&mdash;n y'!" said he;
"wait till I git out!"</p>

<p>"You'll kill me, I suppose?" said Hagar,
scornfully.</p>

<p>"No; shawn't kill you, nor yet that little d&mdash;l
with th' 'unch. There's on'y one cove as
I'd swing for&mdash;that beastly thief of a
lawyer!"</p>

<p>Vark recoiled before the glare in the man's eyes; and as
Bill, foaming and cursing, was hurried out of the room, he looked
at Hagar with a nervous smile.</p>

<p>"That's bluff," he said, feebly.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," replied Hagar,
quietly.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mr. Vark. I'm afraid you won't live
more than seven years; there will be a funeral about the time of
Larkey Bill's release."</p>

<p>When she went out, Bolker grinned at the lawyer and, with
frightful pantomime, he drew a stroke across his neck. Vark looked
at the clasp knife in the corner and shivered. The mandarin on the
table rolled and smiled always.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>Chapter IX<br>
The Eighth Customer And The Pair Of Boots</b>
</h2>

<p>HE was a very little lad, reaching scarcely to the top of the
counter; but he had a sharp, keen face, intelligent beyond his
years with the precocity taught by poverty. Hagar, looking at his
shock of red hair, and the shrewd blue eyes which peered up at her
face, guessed that he was Irish; and when he spoke, his brogue
proved her guess to be a correct one. She stared at the ragged,
bare-footed urchin with some amusement, for this was the smallest
customer she had yet had. But Micky&mdash;so he gave his
name&mdash;was quite as sharp as customers of more mature
years&mdash;in fact, sharper. He bargained astutely with Hagar, and
evidently had made up his small mind not to leave the shop until he
obtained his own price for the article he was pawning. This was a
pair of strong laborer's boots, hob-nailed and stout in the
soles. The red-haired boy heaved them on to the counter with a
mighty clatter, and demanded seven shillings thereon.</p>

<p>"I'll give you five," said Hagar, after
examination.</p>

<p>"Ah, now, would ye?" piped the brat, with shrill
impudence. "Is it taking the bread out av me mouth ye
w'uld be afther? Sure, me mother sid sivin bob, an'
'tis sivin I want."</p>

<p>"Where is your mother, boy? Why did she not come
herself?"</p>

<p>"Mother's comforting herself wid the drink round the
carner; an' sure I'm aqual to gittin' th'
dirthy money meself! Sivin bob, alannah, ant may the hivins be yer
bed!"</p>

<p>"Where did you get these boots?" said Hagar, asking
another question, and ignoring the persuasive tone of the lad.
"I see there are letters marked in nails on the two
soles."</p>

<p>"Ah! there moight be," assented Micky, complacently;
"there's a 'G' on one foot, an' a
'K' on the other; but me fawther's name is
Patrick Dooley, an' he's in Amerikey, worse luck.
Mother got thim boots foive days gone in the counthry. They wos a
prisint, me darlin'; an' as they wos too big fur me
an' me mother, we pop them, dear, fur sivin bob."</p>

<p>"Take six," said Hagar, persuasively; "they
aren't worth more."</p>

<p>"Howly saints! listen to the lies av her!" shrieked
Micky. "Six, is it? An' how can I go to me mother wid a
shillin' wrong? Sure, it's breakin' me hid
she'd be afther, wid a quart pot! An' what's
money to the loikes av you, me dear?"</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;here! take the seven shillings!" said
Hagar, anxious to rid herself of this shrieking imp.
"I'll make out the ticket in the name of Mrs.
Dooley."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bridget Dooley, av Park Lane," said Micky,
grandly. "Sure that will do as well as any other place.
It's on the tramp we are&mdash;bad luck to it! If
'twasn't for thim boots we got in Marlow, it's
without a copper we'd be."</p>

<p>"Here! take the ticket and money. I daresay you stole the
boots."</p>

<p>"Is it takin' away me characther y'd be
afther? Stalin'? Wasn't thim boots a prisint to me, for
pure charity an' love av the saints? Ah, well, I'm
goin'&mdash;I'm goin'! Sivin bob; it's
little enough onyhow; but phwat's the use of lookin'
for justice to Oireland in the counthry av the Saxon
toyrant?" and Micky went out, singing "The Wearing of
the Green" in a very shrill and unpleasant voice.</p>

<p>Hagar put the boots away, never expecting that a story could be
attached to so ordinary a pawned article. But two days afterwards
she was reading an account of a murder, and, to her surprise, the
very boots, now reposing on a high shelf in her shop, were
mentioned as a link in the chain of evidence likely to hang the
assassin. Coincidences occur in real life oftener than the world
cares to admit; and this was a case in point. A pair of boots with
initials on the soles had been pawned in her shop; and
now&mdash;scarcely forty-eight hours afterwards&mdash;she was
reading about them in a newspaper. It was strange&mdash;almost
incredible; but, to quote a trite and well-worn saying,
"Truth is stranger than fiction." Briefly, the history
of the crime was as follows:</p>

<p>Sir Leslie Crane, of Welby Park, Marlow, had been shot by his
gamekeeper, George Kerris. It seemed that the man was engaged to
marry a farmer's daughter, Laura Brenton by name; and Sir
Leslie had been paying the girl more attention than was consistent
with their respective positions. Kerris had remonstrated with the
baronet, who had forthwith discharged him. A week later, Crane,
having gone out after dinner for a stroll in the park, had been
found dead by a pond known as the Queen's Pool, which was
some little distance from the gates. Footmarks had been discovered
in the soft mud near the water, which showed that the assassin had
worn boots marked on the soles with the letters "G" and
"K." These had been traced, through a Marlow bootmaker,
to George Kerris The man had been arrested, but neither denied his
guilt nor affirmed his innocence. Still, as the report said, there
could be no doubt that he had killed Sir Leslie in a fit of jealous
rage, and also because he had been discharged. The boots could not
be found, so undoubtedly the man had got rid of them after wearing
them on the night of the murder. The report in the paper concluded
by stating that the dead baronet was succeeded by his cousin, now
Sir Lewis Crane.</p>

<p>"Strange that the boots should have been pawned in
London," thought Hagar, when she finished reading this
article, "and stranger still that they should have been
pawned by that Irish lad! On the day he came here, he said the
boots had been given to him five days previously. It is two days
since then, so that in all makes seven days. H'm! To-day is
the twenty-first of August, so I suppose Kerris must have given the
boots to Micky on the fourteenth. Let me see the date of the
crime."</p>

<p>On examination she found that the murder had been committed on
the night of the twelfth of August, and that Kerris had been
arrested on the thirteenth. Here Hagar came to a full stop and
reflected. If Kerris had been in jail on the fourteenth&mdash;as
from the report in the paper he undoubtedly was&mdash;he could not
have given the boots to Micky on that day. Yet the Irish lad had
confessed to receiving the boots at Marlow, and had given a time
which, as reckoned out by Hagar, corresponded with the fourteenth
of the month. But on that day the man who owned the boots was under
lock and key.</p>

<p>"There's something wrong here," said Hagar to
herself, on making this discovery. "Perhaps Kerris is
innocent in spite of the evidence of the boots. What am I to
do?"</p>

<p>It was difficult to say. Certainly the accused man did not
assert his innocence&mdash;a fact which was rather astonishing on
the face of it. No one would let themselves be hanged for a murder
which they did not commit. Yet, if Kerris were guilty, he must have
had an accomplice, else how could the boots have been given to the
Irish tramp when their owner was in prison? The man, thought Hagar,
might be innocent after all, in spite of his strange silence.
Still, not knowing all the circumstances of the case&mdash;save the
garbled and bare report in the newspaper&mdash;the girl did not,
and could not, make up her mind in the matter. At the present
moment, her sole course was to write and state that the boots had
been pawned. This Hagar did at once, and the next day received a
visit from the detective who had charge of the case.</p>

<p>He was called Julf, a lean, tall, dark and solemn creature, who
went very cautiously to work&mdash;especially in cases of murder.
He had a conscience, he said, and would never forgive himself did
he hang the wrong criminal. Julf knew how often circumstantial
evidence helped to condemn the innocent; how likely even the most
acute detective was to be deceived by outward appearances; and how
intricate and dark were the paths which led to the discoveries of
mysterious crimes. Hence he was slow and circumspect in his
dealings.</p>

<p>On arriving at the Lambeth pawn-shop he examined the boots,
asked Hagar a few questions, and then sat down with her to thresh
out the matter. Julf saw that the girl was shrewd and clever from
the remarks she had made anent the pawning of the boots; so he was
quite willing to discuss the affair freely with her. In contrast to
many self-sufficient detectives, Julf always believed that two
heads were better than one, especially when the second head was
that of a woman. He had a great respect for the instinct of the
weaker sex.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the man's guilty, right
enough," he said, in his solemn way. "He had quarreled
with Sir Leslie over this girl, and had been dismissed for
insolence. Besides, he was seen coming out of the park at ten
o'clock&mdash;just after the murder!"</p>

<p>"Had he his gun with him?"</p>

<p>"No; but that's no matter. Sir Leslie was shot
through the heart with a pistol. Now, Kerris had a pistol, but that
can't be found either. You didn't have a pistol pawned
here, did you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing was pawned but the boots," said Hagar,
"and Kerris could not have given them to Micky; it seems that
he was in prison on the day the lad got them."</p>

<p>"That is true enough. We must find this boy, and learn who
gave him the boots on that day. But if Kerris is innocent, why
doesn't he say so?"</p>

<p>"It is a mystery," sighed Hagar. "You say that
Kerris's pistol cannot be found?"</p>

<p>"No, not in his house; so I daresay he flung it away after
killing Sir Leslie."</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" said Hagar, shrewdly, "then the
weapon with which the murder was committed can't be found
either."</p>

<p>"But the pistol is the same; Kerris used it, and then got
rid of it."</p>

<p>"Why don't you search for it?"</p>

<p>"We have searched everywhere, but it cannot be
found."</p>

<p>"Have you drained the pond near which the crime was
committed?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," said Julf, meditatively; "we
haven't done that. It's a good idea!"</p>

<p>Hagar sighed impatiently. "I wish I had this case in my
own hands!" she said, sharply; "I believe I'd
find the assassin."</p>

<p>"We have found him," replied the detective,
stolidly. "Kerris killed Sir Leslie."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!"</p>

<p>"Then why doesn't he deny it?"</p>

<p>"I can't say. Is Kerris much in love with this Laura
Brenton?" asked Hagar, turning her large bright eyes on
Julf.</p>

<p>"I should think so! He's madly in love with
her."</p>

<p>"And she with him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't say that," replied Julf;
"that is quite another thing. I fancy from what I have heard
that she gave far too much encouragement to that young baronet.
Kerris evidently had cause for jealousy; so I do not wonder he
killed Sir Leslie."</p>

<p>"You have yet to prove that he did."</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Julf, rising to take his leave.
"He quarreled with the baronet: he was discharged. His own
pistol is missing, and the dead man was shot with a pistol. Then
there is the evidence of the boots with his initials on the soles.
You can't get over that. Don't you talk nonsense, my
girl; there is a strong case against Kerris."</p>

<p>"I can see that; but there is one point in his favor. He
did not give those boots to Micky."</p>

<p>"Evidently not. But to prove that point we must find the
lad."</p>

<p>This was easier said than done, for Micky and his mother had
disappeared as completely as though the earth had swallowed them
up. All the police and detective forces in London tried to find the
boy, but could not. Yet on his evidence turned the whole case. And
all this time George Kerris, in the Marlow prison, refused to open
his mouth. Most people believed him to be guilty on the evidence of
the boots; but Hagar, on the evidence of the pawning, insisted that
he was innocent. Still, she could not understand why he held his
tongue at such a crisis.</p>

<p>It has been stated several times that Hagar found her life in
the pawn-shop extremely dull, and seized every opportunity to gain
for herself a little diversion. A chance of amusement in unraveling
the mystery of the boots offered itself now; and this she resolved
to take. Also, the conduct of the case would necessitate a visit
into the country; and, weary of the narrow streets of Lambeth,
Hagar eagerly desired a breath of fresh air. She left the shop in
charge of an elderly man, who had been her assistant since
Bolker's departure, and took the train to Marlow. When she
arrived there, Julf, more solemn than ever, met her at the railway
station.</p>

<p>"Good-day," said he, quietly. "You see I have
agreed to let you assist me in finding out the truth of this case;
though to my mind the truth is already plain enough."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it, Mr. Julf. Take my word for it,
George Kerris is innocent of the crime."</p>

<p>"Is he?" said Julf, in sceptical tones; "then
who is guilty?"</p>

<p>"That is what I have come to find out," retorted
Hagar. "I am obliged to you for letting me help you, though,
to be sure, I do so only to gratify my own curiosity. But you
won't repent of your concession. I am to have a free
hand?"</p>

<p>"You can do exactly as you like."</p>

<p>"Can I? Then I shall first call and see the new
baronet."</p>

<p>Refusing the offer of Julf to accompany her, on the plea that
she could execute her business better alone, Hagar walked to Welby
Park, which was on the other side of Marlow, and asked to see Sir
Lewis Crane. At first, owing to her gipsy-like appearance, she was
refused admittance; but on mentioning that her business had to do
with the murder of the late baronet, Sir Lewis consented to see
her. When face to face with him, Hagar, for reasons of her own,
examined him closely.</p>

<p>He was an ugly, elderly little creature, many years older than
his dead cousin, and had a mean yellow face, stamped with an
expression of avarice. Hagar had seen just such another pinched,
cunning look on the face of Jacob Dix, and she knew without much
trouble that the man before her was a miser. However, she wasted no
time in analyzing his character&mdash;knowing that it would reveal
itself in the forthcoming conversation&mdash;but at once mentioned
her business.</p>

<p>"I am come on the part of Mr. Julf to see about this
murder," she said, curtly.</p>

<p>Sir Lewis raised his eyes. "I did not know that the
Government employed lady detectives!" was his remark.</p>

<p>"I am not a detective, but the owner of the shop in which
the boots of George Kerris were pawned."</p>

<p>"The boots which prove his guilt," said Crane, with
an air of relief, which did not escape Hagar.</p>

<p>"I rather think that they prove his innocence!" was
her cold reply.</p>

<p>"Oh! you are talking about them having been given to that
tramp when Kerris was in prison. I know all about that, as the
detective told it to me. But, all the same, Kerris is guilty, else
he would deny his guilt."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea why he does not do so?"</p>

<p>Crane shrugged his shoulders. "No; unless it is that he
knows himself to be guilty."</p>

<p>"I believe him to be innocent."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! My cousin admired Laura Brenton, who was engaged
to Kerris, and was foolishly attentive to her. On that score the
man was insolent; so Leslie discharged him. In committing the
murder, he took a double revenge."</p>

<p>"Where were you, Sir Lewis, when your cousin was
killed?"</p>

<p>"In the park," replied the baronet, frankly,
"After dinner my cousin and I went out for a stroll. In a
short time he made some excuse to leave me, as I believe he wished
to meet Laura by the Queen's Pool. I walked in the opposite
direction, and shortly afterwards I came back to the house. Leslie
had not returned, so I went to look for him, and found his dead
body by the Pool."</p>

<p>"Did you hear the pistol shot?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I paid no attention to it. My cousin was in the
habit of firing at a target, and I thought he might be doing so
then."</p>

<p>"What! firing at a target in the twilight! Could your
cousin see in the dark like a cat?" said Hagar, with
irony.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that!" retorted
Crane, snappishly. "I have told you the story, as you
represent the detective Julf. I say no more!"</p>

<p>"I don't want you to say more. May I go and look at
the pond?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. One of the servants shall show it to
you."</p>

<p>"Can't you come yourself?" said Hagar, with a
keen glance.</p>

<p>Crane drew back, and his yellow face grew pale.
"No," said he, in an almost inaudible voice. "I
have seen enough of that horrible place!"</p>

<p>"Very good; I'll go with the servant," replied
Hagar, and marched towards the door.</p>

<p>"What do you want to see the pool for?" he asked,
following.</p>

<p>"I wish to find the lost pistol."</p>

<p>When Hagar had taken her departure, Sir Lewis, pale and nervous,
stood near the open window. "Confound this woman!" he
thought, clenching his hand. "She is far too clever; but I
don't think she'll be quite clever enough to find that
pistol," he added, in a satisfied tone.</p>

<p>The Queen's Pool was a circular sheet of water filled with
lilies, at the lower end of the park. On the way thereto Hagar
asked the servant who was guiding her a few questions.</p>

<p>"Was Sir Lewis poor before he got the estate?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"Very poor, miss; hadn't a sixpence but what he got
from Sir Leslie."</p>

<p>"Was he on good terms with his cousin?"</p>

<p>"No, miss; they was quarreling fearful. On the night of
the murder they had a row royal!"</p>

<p>"What about?" asked Hagar, turning a keen look on
the man.</p>

<p>"About money and that gal Laura. Sir Lewis loved her just
as much as Sir Leslie; but she didn't care a straw for either
of them, being taken up with Kerris."</p>

<p>"How does she take her lover's arrest?"</p>

<p>"Why, miss, she cries, and cries, and swears that he is
innocent, and talks nonsense."</p>

<p>"What kind of nonsense? There may be some sense in
it?"</p>

<p>"I dursn't tell you, miss," said the servant
casting a hurried look round, "it 'ud be as much as my
place is worth."</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand," said Hagar, serenely;
"this Laura says that Sir Lewis killed his cousin."</p>

<p>"Yes, she do," replied the man, aghast at her
penetration; "but how could you guess, miss, is
more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Hagar, cutting him short as they
arrived at the pool. "Is this the place where the murder was
committed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss; we found the body there in the mud; and just
beside it the marks of the boots."</p>

<p>Hagar reflected, and asked another question. "Did Sir
Lewis ever visit Kerris?"</p>

<p>"He did, miss, just two days afore the murder&mdash;went
to see him about some game."</p>

<p>"Oh, did he?" murmured Hagar to herself. "I
think there was something more than game in that visit."</p>

<p>Of this she said nothing to the man, who stood on the bank,
watching her searching about the place. The pool was filled with
clear water, and on it the lilies floated placidly. Hagar peered in
to see if there was any trace of the pistol used to kill Sir
Leslie; but although the water was crystal-clear, and she searched
carefully, not a sign of the weapon could she see. The grass round
the pool was closely shorn, and some little distance up the slope
stretched a terrace with a flight of shallow stone steps. On either
side of these, at the lower end, were two pillars, bearing urns of
marble sculptured in classic fashion with nymphs and dancing fauns.
In these bloomed scarlet geraniums, now in full flower; and as
Hagar, idly gazing around, caught sight of the vivid blossoms an
idea entered her head. Dismissing the man, for whom she had no
further use, she moved swiftly towards the terrace, and lifted one
of the pots out of its marble urn.</p>

<p>"No sign of a pistol there," she said, replacing the
pot with a sense of disappointment. "I may be wrong. Let me
examine the other."</p>

<p>This time she was rewarded for her shrewd guess. At the bottom
of the right-hand urn, quite concealed by the pot, she found a
small pistol. On its stock there was a silver plate, and on that
plate a name was engraved. At the sight of this latter the eyes of
Hagar glistened with much satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I thought so!" said she to herself, "and now
to tell Julf!"</p>

<p>The detective was waiting for her at the park gates, and looked
up expectantly as she moved towards him with a smile on her face.
With grim satisfaction she placed the pistol in his hand.</p>

<p>"There is the weapon with which Sir Leslie was
killed!" she said, in a tone of triumph. "I found it
under the geranium pot in one of those urns. What do you think of
that?"</p>

<p>"The pistol of Kerris!" said Julf quite amazed.</p>

<p>"No; not the pistol of Kerris, but of the man who murdered
Sir Leslie."</p>

<p>"Kerris," repeated Julf, with dogged obstinacy.</p>

<p>"Look at the name on the silver plate, you
idiot!"</p>

<p>"Lewis Crane!" read the detective, stupefied then he
looked up with an expression of blank astonishment on his solemn
face. "What!" he muttered, "do you think Sir
Lewis killed his cousin?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it!" replied Hagar, firmly. "I
have just learnt from a servant that he was in love with the girl
Laura also, and that he was poor and dependent upon the dead man
for money. The two had a quarrel on the night of the murder, as
they were walking in the park. Because of this quarrel they parted,
each going different ways. Sir Lewis said that he returned home,
that he heard the pistol shot, and thought that his cousin was
shooting at a target&mdash;as if a man would do so in the
twilight!" added the girl, contemptuously. "What he
really did&mdash;Lewis, I mean&mdash;was to follow his cousin, and
shoot him by the Queen's Pool; then he hid the pistol in the
marble urn, and crept back to the house to play his comedy. I tell
you, Mr. Julf, that Kerris is innocent. I said so always. Sir Lewis
is the guilty person, and he slew his cousin out of jealousy of
Laura Brenton, and because he wanted the dead man's
money."</p>

<p>"But the boots&mdash;the footmarks in the mud?"
stammered Julf, quite confounded by this reasoning. "The
marks were made by the boots of Kerris."</p>

<p>"I quite believe that," admitted Hagar;
"another portion of Sir Lewis's very clever scheme to
ward off suspicion from himself. The servant who led me to the
Queen's Pool will tell you, as he told me, that Sir Lewis
just a day or two before the murder paid a visit to the cottage of
Kerris. Now, it is my opinion that while there he stole the boots,
and wore them on the night on which he committed the murder, with
the intention of throwing the blame on Kerris, whom Laura Brenton
loved. Don't you see what his game was, Mr. Julf? He wanted
to gain a title and money, so as to marry Laura: so he slew his
cousin to get the first, and laid the blame&mdash;by circumstantial
evidence&mdash;on George Kerris, to get the second. Now what do you
say?"</p>

<p>"It looks black against Sir-Lewis, certainly,"
admitted Julf; "still, I cannot think that he would
dare&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah! men dare anything to gratify their passions!"
retorted Hagar, shrewdly; "besides, he thought that he made
all safe for himself by wearing the boots of Kerris. It was Sir
Lewis who gave the boots to Micky. Oh, if that boy could only be
found!"</p>

<p>"He is found!" said Julf, quickly. "I got a
telegram while you were in the park. The police picked him up in
Whitechapel, and will send him down here to-morrow. If he can swear
that Sir Lewis gave him the boots, I shall get a warrant out for
that man's arrest."</p>

<p>"I believe he is guilty," said Hagar, in a
meditative fashion, "and yet I am not altogether
sure."</p>

<p>"Why not? There is certainly a strong case against
him."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; but why, if Sir Lewis is guilty, should Kerris
keep silent, and not declare his innocence? I must see the man and
find out. Can I get into the jail?"</p>

<p>"I'll take you there myself to-morrow
morning," replied Julf. "I should like to know the
reason of his silence also. It can't be love of Sir Lewis as
makes him hold his tongue."</p>

<p>"No; that is what puzzles me. After all, like Kerris, the
baronet may be innocent."</p>

<p>Julf shook his head. "I can't think where you will
find a third party on which to lay the guilt&mdash;unless,"
he added, with an afterthought, "you blame the Irish boy who
pawned the boots."</p>

<p>"It may be even him!" said Hagar, seriously.
"But we'll know to-morrow, I fancy. Kerris, Sir Lewis,
Micky&mdash;h'm! I wonder which of the three killed that poor
young man."</p>

<p>Hagar thought over this problem for an hour or so, then, not
being able to solve it, she put it out of her head for the night.
As for Julf, he was so much impressed by Hagar's cleverness
in finding the pistol and constructing a case against Sir
Lewis&mdash;who he now began to believe was guilty&mdash;that the
next morning, before taking her to see George Kerris in prison, he
conducted her to an outlying farm.</p>

<p>"Laura Brenton lives here," he said; "ask her
about Sir Lewis, and see if we can strengthen the case against
him."</p>

<p>Laura was a fine, tall, handsome girl, somewhat masculine in her
looks; but at the present moment she seemed ill, and appeared
haggard&mdash;which was no wonder, seeing that one of her lovers
was dead, and the other in prison. However, she was quite willing
to answer Hagar's questions, and declared most emphatically
that Kerris was innocent.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't kill a fly!" said she, weeping,
"although he was angry with me for meeting Sir Leslie; but I
never saw any harm in doing so."</p>

<p>"Opinions differ," said Hagar, coldly, not approving
of this morality. "You met Sir Leslie on the night of the
murder?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't!" stammered the girl,
fiercely. "Who says so?"</p>

<p>"Sir Lewis. He told me that his cousin left him in the
park&mdash;after their quarrel&mdash;to see you by the
Queen's Pool."</p>

<p>This Laura denied flatly. "I went into Marlow on that
evening to buy some ribbon," she explained, "but I
never went near Welby Park. Sir Lewis is a liar and a
murderer!"</p>

<p>"A murderer? Why should he murder his cousin?" asked
Hagar, sharply.</p>

<p>"Because he loved me, and I would have nothing to say to
him."</p>

<p>"You loved Sir Leslie?"</p>

<p>"I did not!" blazed out the girl, wrathfully.
"I loved neither of them, but only George Kerris. He is
innocent, and Sir Lewis is guilty. I believe he killed his cousin
with the pistol Sir Leslie gave him."</p>

<p>"What do you know about that pistol?"</p>

<p>"Why," explained Laura, quietly, "I went to
Welby Park with father to pay the rent, and in the library, on the
table, there was a pistol with a silver plate on it. Sir
Lewis&mdash;he was not the baronet then&mdash;told me that Sir
Leslie had given it to him, and showed me his own name on the
plate. As Sir Leslie was shot with a pistol, I believe Sir Lewis
did it."</p>

<p>"But had not George Kerris a pistol also?"</p>

<p>"Yes; an old thing that wouldn't fire straight. I
tried it myself at a target which George set up on the
farm."</p>

<p>"The pistol isn't in George's
house."</p>

<p>"I don't know where it is, then," said the
girl, indifferently; "but I am sure of one thing, that George
is innocent. Oh, try and get him out of jail!"</p>

<p>"And Sir Lewis hanged?" said Hagar, drily.</p>

<p>"Yes!" cried Laura, fiercely: "he's a
murdering beast; I should like to see him dead!"</p>

<p>Rather wondering at the fierceness of the girl, Hagar left her,
and went on to the jail in which Kerris was incarcerated. The
gamekeeper was a huge blond man, with a fresh, handsome face.
Usually his expression was frank and kindly, but now, owing to
recent events, he looked sullen. In spite of all Hagar's
questioning, he persisted in declining an explanation.</p>

<p>"I'll say neither one thing nor another," he
declared; "if I did kill Sir Leslie, or I didn't, is my
business. Anyhow, he deserved to be killed."</p>

<p>"Who are you screening?" asked Hagar, changing her
tactics.</p>

<p>"No one," replied Kerris, a color rising in his
face.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are, else you would not jeopardize your neck.
But you shall be saved in spite of yourself. I know who killed Sir
Leslie."</p>

<p>"You do?" asked the man, looking up anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, his cousin, Sir Lewis. We have found his pistol
concealed where the murder took place; he stole your boots to wear
them, and throw the blame on you. You came out of Welby Park at ten
o'clock, after the murder was committed. Did you not see Sir
Lewis?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," replied Kerris, hastily.
"I saw no one. I heard a shot, and thought poachers might be
about, but as Sir Leslie had discharged me I didn't think it
was my business to see after them."</p>

<p>"Sir Lewis paid you a visit shortly before the
murder?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did; to see me about some game."</p>

<p>"Did you miss the boots after he left?"</p>

<p>"I never missed them till the night of the murder, when I
wanted to put 'em on," said Kerris. "I
hadn't worn them for some days, as they were new boots, and
rather hurt my feet."</p>

<p>"Then no doubt Sir Lewis stole them for his own
purposes," said Hagar triumphantly. "He is guilty, and
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am innocent!" cried Kerris, proudly. "I
don't mind saying it now. I never killed Sir Leslie; I never
laid a finger on him."</p>

<p>"And you did not say so before because you are screening
some one. Who is it?"</p>

<p>Kerris made no reply, but looked uneasy.</p>

<p>Before Hagar could repeat her question, the answer thereto came
from a most unexpected quarter. The door of the cell was opened,
and Julf entered, with an expression of profound astonishment on
his face.</p>

<p>"Here's a go!" he cried to Hagar. "Micky
has arrived, and has told me from whom he received the
boots!"</p>

<p>"Sir Lewis?"</p>

<p>"No! I have seen Sir Lewis, and he denies his guilt; also,
he tells me a story which corroborates Micky's evidence, and
explains why Kerris here holds his tongue."</p>

<p>Kerris rose from his seat on the bed with a bound, and strode
towards Julf, looking worried and fierce.</p>

<p>"Not a word! not a word!" he said, between his
clenched teeth. "Spare her!"</p>

<p>"Her!" cried Hagar, a light breaking in on her.
"Laura Brenton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Laura Brenton," replied Julf, shaking off the
gamekeeper. "Micky has seen her; it was she who gave him the
boots."</p>

<p>"I told her to; I told her to!" interrupted Kerris,
in despair.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! you wish to screen her, as you have tried to do
all along. But you are wrong. Laura Benton is not worth your
sacrificing your life, my man. She is the guilty person who killed
Sir Leslie. And why? Because he had cast her off, and was about to
marry another woman."</p>

<p>Kerris gave a great cry. "It is false&mdash;false! She
loved me!"</p>

<p>"She loved herself!" retorted Julf, sharply.
"Sir Leslie promised to marry her, and because she could not
force him to keep that promise she killed him. It was to throw the
blame on you that she stole the boots and wore them on the night
she met Sir Leslie by the Queen's Pool. It was to get Sir
Lewis into trouble that she stole his pistol to kill his
cousin."</p>

<p>"And did she hide it in the urn?" asked Hagar,
astonished by these revelations.</p>

<p>"No; Sir Lewis did so. He knew that Laura committed the
crime."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"He heard the shot, and went to see who had fired it. By
the Queen's Pool he found his cousin's dead body, and
picked up his own pistol on the bank. As Laura, to his knowledge,
had taken it away from the library on the day she came with her
father to pay rent, he knew that she had killed Sir Leslie. To
screen her, and not thinking of his own danger should the pistol
with his name on it be found, he hid it in the urn where you found
it. So, you see, two men have tried to screen this woman, who loved
neither of them."</p>

<p>"She loved me&mdash;me!" cried Kerris, in agony.
"Oh, why did Sir Lewis speak!"</p>

<p>"To save himself from arrest," replied Julf.
"He was not so loyal as you, my poor fellow. However, you
will soon be released. To-day, I arrest Laura."</p>

<p>And this was done on that very morning. Laura was arrested, and,
terrified by the statements of Micky and Sir Lewis, although George
Kerris loyally kept silent, she confessed all. Julf's
explanation was correct. She had met Sir Leslie on the night of the
murder by the Queen's Pool, with the intention of killing him
should he persist in his intention of casting her off. He did so,
and she killed him. She had stolen the pistol and the boots to
throw the blame, should occasion arise, on Sir Lewis and Kerris.
Also, she had taken away the pistol of Kerris from his cottage to
inculpate him. But for Hagar and the episode of the pawned boots,
which Laura had given to Micky to get rid of, she might have
succeeded in her vile plans, and have escaped free, to ruin other
men. As it was, she confessed her crime, and was condemned to penal
servitude for life. She deserved the scaffold, but she escaped that
through the leniency of the jury, on the score of her youth and
beauty.</p>

<p>Released from the prison into which he had cast himself so madly
to save an ungrateful woman, George Kerris came up to Lambeth and
redeemed those fatal boots which had been pawned by Micky.</p>

<p>"I am going to Australia," he said to Hagar.
"I failed to save her, so I cannot bear to remain at Marlow.
I knew she was guilty all along; for she had been in my cottage the
day previous to the murder, and had carried off these boots, on the
plea that her father wished for a similar pair, and wanted to see
them. When the footmarks with my initials were traced in the mud of
the pond, I guessed that she had worn the boots, and had killed Sir
Leslie. I loved her so dearly that I would have suffered in her
place: but you with your clear head found her out, and now she is
paying for her wickedness. Life is over for me here; I go to
Australia, and I shall take these boots which ruined her with
me."</p>

<p>"Why did you do all this for Laura&mdash;that worthless
woman?"</p>

<p>"Worthless she is, I know," rejoined Kerris;
"but&mdash;I loved her!" and with a nod he departed,
carrying the boots and himself into exile.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="X" id="X"></a>Chapter X<br>
The Ninth Customer And The Casket</b>
</h2>

<p>HAGAR had almost a genius for reading people's characters
in their faces. The curve of the mouth, the glance of the
eyes&mdash;she could interpret these truly; for to her feminine
instinct she added a logical judgment masculine in its discretion.
She was rarely wrong when she exercised this faculty; and in the
many customers who entered the Lambeth pawn-shop she had ample
opportunities to use her talent. To the sleek, white-faced creature
who brought for pawning the Renaissance casket of silver she took
an instant and violent dislike. Subsequent events proved that she
was right in doing so. The ninth customer&mdash;as she called
him&mdash;was an oily scoundrel. In appearance he was a respectable
servant&mdash;a valet or a butler&mdash;and wore an immaculate suit
of black broad-cloth. His face was as white as that of a corpse,
and almost as expressionless. Two tufts of whisker adorned his lean
cheeks, but his thin mouth and receding chin were uncovered with
hair. On his badly-shaped head and off his low narrow forehead the
scanty hair of iron-gray was brushed smoothly. He dropped his
shifty gray eyes when he addressed Hagar, and talked softly in a
most deferential manner. Hagar guessed him to be a West-end
servant; and by his physiognomy she knew him to be a scoundrel.</p>

<p>This "gentleman's gentleman"&mdash;as Hagar
guessed him rightly to be&mdash;gave the name of Julian Peters, and
the address 42, Mount Street, Mayfair. As certainly as though she
had been in the creature's confidence, Hagar knew that name
and address were false. Also, she was not quite sure whether he had
come honestly by the casket which he wished to pawn, although the
story he told was a very fair and, apparently, candid one.</p>

<p>"My late master, miss, left me this box as a
legacy," he said deferentially, "and I have kept it by
me for some time. Unfortunately, I am now out of a situation, and
to keep myself going until I obtain a new one I need money. You
will understand, miss, that it is only necessity which makes me
pawn this box. I want fifteen pounds on it."</p>

<p>"You can have thirteen," said Hagar, pricing the box
at a glance.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed, miss, I am sure it is worth fifteen,"
said Mr. Peters (so-called): "if you look at the
workmanship&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have looked at everything," replied Hagar,
promptly&mdash;"at the silver, the workmanship, the date, and
all the rest of it."</p>

<p>"The date, miss?" asked the man, in a puzzled
tone.</p>

<p>"Yes; the casket is Cinque Cento, Florentine work. I dare
say if you took it to a West-end jeweler you could get more on it
than I am prepared to lend. Thirteen pounds is my limit."</p>

<p>"I'll take it," said Peters, promptly.
"I don't care about pawning it in the West-end, where I
am known."</p>

<p>"As a scoundrel, no doubt," thought Hagar,
cynically. However, it was not her place to spoil a good
bargain&mdash;and getting the Renaissance casket for thirteen
pounds was a very good one&mdash;so she made out the ticket in the
false name of Julian Peters, and handed it to him, together with a
ten-pound note and three sovereigns. The man counted the money,
with a greedy look in his eyes, and turned to depart with a
cringing bow. At the door of the shop he paused, however, to
address a last word to Hagar.</p>

<p>"I can redeem that casket whenever I like, miss?" he
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if it pleases you?" replied Hagar,
coldly, "so long as you pay me a month's interest for
the loan of the money."</p>

<p>"Thank you, miss; I shall take back the box in a
month's time. In the meantime I leave it in your charge,
miss, and wish you a very good day."</p>

<p>Hagar gave a shudder of disgust as he left the shop; for the man
to her was a noxious thing, like a snake or a toad. If instinct
were worth anything, she felt that this valet was a thief and a
scoundrel, who was abusing the trust his employer placed in him.
The casket was far more likely to have been thieved than to have
come to Mr. Peters by will. It is not usual for gentlemen to leave
their servants legacies of Cinque Cento caskets.</p>

<p>The box, as Peters called it, was very beautiful; an exquisite
example of goldsmith's art, worthy of Benvenuto Cellini
himself. Probably it was by one of his pupils. Renaissance work
certainly, for in its ornamentation there was visible that mingling
of Christianity and paganism which is so striking a characteristic
of the re-birth of the Arts in the Italy of Dante and the Medici.
On the sides of the casket in relief there were figures of dancing
nymph and piping satyr; flower-wreathed altar and vine-crowned
priest. On the lid a full-length figure of the Virgin with upraised
hands; below clouds and the turrets of a castle; overhead the glory
of the Holy Ghost in the form of a wide-winged Dove, and fluttering
cherubs and grave saints. Within the casket was lined with dead
gold, smooth and lusterless; but this receptacle contained
nothing.</p>

<p>Without doubt this tiny gem of goldsmith's art had been
the jewel-case of some Florentine lady in that dead and gone
century. Perhaps for her some lover had ordered it to be made, with
its odd mingling of cross and thyrsus; its hints of asceticism and
joyous life. But the Florentine beauty was now dust; all her days
of love and vanity and sin were over; and the casket in which she
had stored her jewels lay in a dingy London pawn-shop. There was
something ironic in the fate meted out by Time and Chance to this
dainty trifle of luxury.</p>

<p>While examining the box, Hagar noticed that the gold plate of
the case within was raised some little distance above the outside
portion. There appeared to her shrewd eyes to be a space between
the base of the casket and the inner box of gold. Ever on the alert
to discover mysteries, Hagar believed that in this toy there was a
secret drawer, which no doubt opened by a concealed spring. At once
she set to work searching for this spring.</p>

<p>"It is very cleverly hidden," she murmured, having
been baffled for a long time; "but a secret recess there is,
and I intend to find it. Who knows but what I may stumble on the
evidence of some old Florentine tragedy, like that of the Crucifix
of Fiesole?"</p>

<p>Her fingers were slender and nimble, and had a wonderfully
delicate sense of feeling in their narrow tips. She ran them
lightly over the raised work of beaten silver, pressing the
laughing heads of the fauns and nymphs. For some time she was
unsuccessful, until by chance she touched a delicately-modeled
rose, which was carven on the central altar of one side. At once
there was a slight click, and the silver slab with its sculptured
figures fell downward on a hinge. As she had surmised, the box was
divided within into two unequal portions; the upper one, visible
when the ordinary lid was lifted, was empty, as has been said; but
in the narrowness of the lower receptacle, between the false and
the real bottoms of the box, there was a slim packet. Pleased with
her discovery&mdash;which certainly did credit to her acute
intelligence&mdash;Hagar drew out the papers. "Here is my
Florentine tragedy!" said she, with glee, and proceeded to
examine her treasure-trove.</p>

<p>It did not take her long to discover that the letters&mdash;for
they were letters, five or six, tied up with rose-hued
ribbon&mdash;were not fifteenth century, but very late nineteenth;
that they were not written in Italian, but in English. Penned in
graceful female handwriting upon scented paper&mdash;a perfume of
violets clung to them still&mdash;these letters were full of
passionate and undisciplined love. Hagar only read one, but it was
sufficient to see that she had stumbled upon an intrigue between a
married woman and a man. No address was given, as each letter began
unexpectedly with words of fire and adoration, continuing in such
style from beginning to end, where the signature appended was
"Beatrice." In the first one, which Hagar
read&mdash;and which was a sample of the rest&mdash;the writer
lamented her marriage, raged that she was bound to a dull husband,
and called upon her dearest Paul&mdash;evidently the
inamorato's name&mdash;to deliver her. The passion, the
fierce sensual love which burnt in every line of this married
woman's epistles, disgusted Hagar not a little. Her pure and
virginal soul shrank back from the abyss revealed by this lustful
adoration; trembled at the glimpse it obtained of a hidden life.
There was, indeed, no tragedy in these letters as yet, but it might
be&mdash;with such a woman as she who had penned them&mdash;that
they would become the prelude to one. In every line there was
divorce.</p>

<p>"What a liar that valet is!" thought Hagar, as she
tied the letters up again. "This casket was left to him as a
legacy, was it? As if a man would entrust such compromising letters
to the discretion of a scoundrel like Peters! No, no; I am sure he
doesn't know of this secret place, or of the existence of
these letters. He stole this casket from his master, and did not
know that it was used to hide these epistles from a married woman.
I'll keep the casket safely, and see what comes of it when
Mr. Peters returns."</p>

<p>But she did not put the letters back in their secret recess. It
might be that the valet would return before the conclusion of the
month; and if she were out of the shop at the time, her assistant
would give back the casket. Hagar felt that it would be wrong to
let the letters get into the hands of so unscrupulous a scoundrel
as she believed Peters to be. Did he find out the secret of the
hiding-place, and the letters were within, he was quite capable of
making capital out of them at the expense of the unhappy woman or
his own master. He had the face of a blackmailer; so Hagar reclosed
the casket, and put away the letters in the big safe in the
parlor.</p>

<p>"She is a light woman&mdash;a bad woman," she
thought, thinking of that Beatrice who had written those glowing
letters&mdash;"and deserves punishment for having deceived
her husband. But I won't give her into the power of that
reptile; he would only fatten on her agony. If he comes back for
the casket, he shall have it, but without those letters."</p>

<p>Hagar did not think for a moment that Peters knew of the
existence of these epistles, else in place of pawning the box he
would have levied blackmail on the wretched Beatrice or her lover.
But when in two weeks&mdash;long before the conclusion of the
month&mdash;the valet again appeared, he showed Hagar very plainly
that he had learnt the secret in the meantime. How and from whom he
had learnt it Hagar forced him to explain. She was able to do this,
as he wanted back the casket, yet had not the money to redeem it.
This circumstance gave her a power over the man which she exercised
mercilessly: and for some time&mdash;playing with him in
cat-and-mouse fashion&mdash;she pretended to misunderstand his
errand. But at first sight she saw from his greedy eyes and the
triumphant look on his face that he was bent on some knavery.</p>

<p>"I wish to look at my box, if you please, miss,"
said he, on first entering the shop. "I cannot redeem it as
yet, but if you would permit me to examine it I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" said Hagar, cutting him short; she had
no patience with his flowery periods. "Here is the box. Look
at it as long as you please."</p>

<p>Peters seized the casket eagerly, opened it, and looked into the
empty space within; then he shook it, and turned it upside down, as
though he expected the inner box to fall out. In a moment Hagar
guessed that he had become aware, since pawning the casket, that it
contained a secret receptacle, and was looking for the same. With
an ironic smile she watched him fingering the delicate carvings
with his clumsy hands, and saw that with such coarse handling the
casket would never yield up its secret. She therefore revealed it
to him, not for his satisfaction, but because she wanted to know
the history of the love-letters. For these, without doubt, the
creature was looking, and Hagar congratulated herself that she had
obeyed her instinct, and had placed the letters beyond his
reach.</p>

<p>"You can't find it, I see," she observed, as
Peters put down the casket in disgust.</p>

<p>"Find what?" he asked, with a certain challenge in
his regard.</p>

<p>"The secret drawer for which you are looking."</p>

<p>"How do you know that I look for a secret drawer,
miss?"</p>

<p>"I can guess as much from the persistent way in which you
press the sides of that box. Your late master, who left you the
casket as a legacy, evidently did not explain its secrets. But if
you wish to know, look here?" Hagar picked up the box deftly,
touched the altar rose with a light finger, and revealed to Mr.
Peters the secret recess. His face fell, as she knew it would, at
the sight of the vacant space.</p>

<p>"Why, it's empty!" he said aloud in a
chagrined tone. "I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you would find some letters within,"
interrupted Hagar, smartly. "No doubt; but you see, Mr.
Peters&mdash;if that is your name&mdash;I happen to have
anticipated you."</p>

<p>"What? You have found the letters?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a neat little bundle of them, which lies in my
safe."</p>

<p>"Please give them to me," said the man, with
tremulous eagerness.</p>

<p>"Give them to you!" repeated Hagar, contemptuously.
"Not I; it is not my business to encourage
blackmailing."</p>

<p>"But they are my letters!" cried Peters getting red,
but not denying the imputation of blackmailing. "You cannot
keep my letters!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can," retorted Hagar, putting the box on the
shelf behind her; "in the same way that I can keep this
casket if I so choose."</p>

<p>"How dare you!" said the man, losing all his
suavity. "The box is mine!"</p>

<p>"It is your master's, you mean; and the letters
also. You stole the casket to get money, and now you would steal
the letters, if you could, to extort money from a woman. Do you
know what you are, Mr. Peters? You are a scoundrel."</p>

<p>Peters could hardly speak for rage; but when he did find his
voice, it was to threaten Hagar with the police. At this she
laughed contemptuously.</p>

<p>"The police!" she echoed. "Are you out of your
mind? Call a policeman if you dare, and I give you in charge for
thieving that box."</p>

<p>"You cannot; you do not know my master's
name."</p>

<p>"Do I not?" retorted Hagar, playing a game of bluff.
"You forget that the name and address of your master are in
those letters."</p>

<p>Seeing that he was baffled in this direction, the man changed
his high tone for one of diplomacy. He became cringing and
wheedling, and infinitely more obnoxious than before. Hagar could
hardly listen to his vile propositions with calmness; but she did
so advisedly, as she wished to know the story of the letters, the
name of the woman who had written them, and that of the
man&mdash;Peter's master&mdash;to whom they had been sent.
But the task was disagreeable, and required a great deal of
self-restraint.</p>

<p>"Why not share the money with me?" said Peters, in
silky tones; "those letters are worth a great deal. If you
let me have them, I can sell them at a high price either to my
master or to the lady who wrote them."</p>

<p>"No doubt," replied Hagar, with apparent
acquiescence; "but before I agree to your proposal I must
know the story."</p>

<p>"Certainly, miss. I shall tell it to you.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment," interrupted Hagar. "Is Peters
your real name?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss; but the address I gave was false; also the
Christian name I gave you. I am John Peters, of Duke Street, St.
James's, in the employment of Lord Averley."</p>

<p>"You are his valet?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have been with him for a long time; but I lost
some money at cards a week or two ago, so
I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you stole this casket," finished Hagar,
sharply.</p>

<p>"No miss, I didn't," replied Peters, with
great dignity. "I borrowed it from my lord's room for a
few weeks to get money on it. I intended to redeem and replace it
within the month. I shall certainly do so, if our scheme with these
letters turns out successful."</p>

<p>Hagar could scarcely restrain herself from an outbreak when she
heard this wretch so coolly discuss the use he intended to make of
the profits to be derived from his villainy. However, she kept
herself calm, and proceeded to ask further questions with a view to
gaining his entire confidence.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Peters, we will say you borrowed it," she
remarked, ironically; "but don't you think that was
rather a dangerous proceeding?"</p>

<p>"I didn't at the time," said Peters, ruefully,
"as I didn't know my lord kept letters in it. I did not
fancy he would ask after it. However, he did ask two days ago, and
found that it was lost."</p>

<p>"Did he think you had taken it?"</p>

<p>"Lor' bless you, no!" grinned the valet.
"I ain't quite such a fool as to be caught like that.
My lord's rooms have been done up lately, so he thought as
perhaps the paper-hangers or some of that low lot stole the
box."</p>

<p>"In that case you are safe enough," said Hagar,
enraged at the ingenious villainy of the creature. "But how
did you come to learn that there were letters hidden in this box?
You didn't know of them when you pawned it."</p>

<p>"No, miss, I didn't," confessed Peters,
regretfully; "but yesterday I heard my lord say to a friend
of his that there were letters to him from a married lady in the
secret place of the box, so I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you would find the secret place, and use the letters
to get money out of the married lady."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. That's what we are going to do,
ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Is the married lady rich?" asked Hagar, answering
the question by asking another.</p>

<p>"Lor', miss, her husband, Mr. Delamere, has no end
of money! She'd give anything to get those letters back. Why,
if her husband saw them he would divorce her for sure! He's a
proud man, is Delamere."</p>

<p>"Has he any suspicion of an intrigue between his wife and
Lord Averley?"</p>

<p>"Not he, miss; he'd stop it if he had. Oh, you may
be sure she'll give a long price for those
letters."</p>

<p>"No doubt," assented Hagar. "Well, Mr. Peters,
as I am your partner in this very admirable scheme, you had better
let me see Mrs. Delamere. I'll get more out of her than you
would."</p>

<p>"I daresay, miss. You're a sharp one, you are! But
you'll go shares fair?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; if I get a good sum, you shall have half,"
replied Hagar, ambiguously. "But where does Mrs. Delamere
live?"</p>

<p>"In Curzon Street, miss; the house painted a light red
You'll always find her in now about seven. Squeeze her for
all she is worth, miss. We've got a good thing on in this
business."</p>

<p>"It would seem so," replied Hagar, coolly.
"But if I were you, Mr. Peters, I would redeem this casket as
soon as I could. You may get into trouble else."</p>

<p>"I'll take the money out of my share of the
cash," said the scoundrel. "Don't you take less
than five hundred, miss; those letters are worth it."</p>

<p>"Be content; I'll see to all that. To-morrow I shall
interview Mrs. Delamere; so if you come and see me the day after, I
will tell you the result of my visit."</p>

<p>"Oh, there can only be one result with a sharp one like
you," grinned Peters. "You squeeze Mrs. Delamere like
an orange, miss. Say you'll tell her husband, and
she'll pay anything. Good day, miss. My stars, you're a
sharp girl! Good day."</p>

<p>Mr. Peters departed with this compliment, just in time to stop
Hagar from an unholy desire to throw the casket at his head. The
man was a greater scoundrel even than she had thought; and she
trembled to think of how he would have extorted money from Mrs.
Delamere had he obtained the letters. Luckily for that lady, her
foolish epistles were in the hands of a woman far more honorable
than herself.</p>

<p>Although untitled, Mrs. Delamere was a very great lady.
Certainly she was a beautiful one, and many years younger than her
lord and master. Mr. Delamere was a wealthy commoner, with a long
pedigree, and an over-weening pride. Immersed in politics and
Blue-books, he permitted his frivolous and youthful wife to do as
she pleased, provided she did not drag his name in the mud. He
would have forgiven her anything but that. She could be as
extravagant as she pleased; gratify all her costly whims; and
flirt&mdash;if she so chose, and she did choose&mdash;with fifty
men; but if once the name of Delamere was whispered about in
connection with a scandal, she knew well that her husband would
seek either a separation or a divorce. Yet, with all this
knowledge, pretty, silly Mrs. Delamere was foolish enough to
intrigue with Lord Averley, and to write him compromising
letters.</p>

<p>She never thought of danger. Averley was a gentleman, a man of
honor, and he had told her a dozen times that he always burnt the
letters she wrote him. It was therefore a matter of amazement to
Mrs. Delamere when a gipsy-like girl called to see her with a
sealed envelope, and mentioned that such envelope contained her
letters to Averley.</p>

<p>"Letters! letters!" said Mrs. Delamere, brushing her
fluffy yellow curls off her forehead. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that your letters to Lord Averley are in this
envelope," replied Hagar, looking coldly at the dainty doll
before her. "I mean also that did your husband see them he
would divorce you!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Delamere turned pale under her rouge. "Who are
you?" she gasped, her blue eyes dilating with terror.</p>

<p>"My name is Hagar Stanley. I am a gipsy girl, and I keep a
pawn-shop in Lambeth.'</p>

<p>"A pawn-shop! How&mdash;how did you get my&mdash;my
letters?"</p>

<p>"The valet of Lord Averley pawned a silver box in which
they were concealed," explained Hagar. "He intended to
use them as a means to extort money from you. However, I obtained
the letters before he did, and I came instead of him."</p>

<p>"To extort money also, I suppose?"</p>

<p>For the life of her, Mrs. Delamere could not help making the
remark. She knew that she was speaking falsely; that this girl with
the grave, dark, poetic face was not the kind of woman to blackmail
an erring sister. Still, the guilty little creature saw that
Hagar&mdash;this girl from a pawnshop of the slums&mdash;was
sitting in judgment upon her, and already, in her own mind,
condemned her frivolous conduct. Proud and haughty Mrs. Delamere
writhed at the look on the face of her visitor, and terrified as
she was at the abyss which she saw opening at her feet, she could
not help making a slighting remark to gall the woman who came to
save her. She said it on the impulse of the moment; and impulse had
cost her dearly many a time. But that Hagar was a noble woman it
would have cost the frivolous beauty dearly now.</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Delamere," replied Hagar, keeping her
temper&mdash;for really this weak little creature was not worth
anger&mdash;"I do not wish for money. I came to return you
these letters, and I should advise you to destroy them."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly do that!" said the fashionable
lady, seizing the envelope held out to her; "but you must let
me reward you."</p>

<p>"As you would reward any one who returned you a lost
jewel!" retorted the gipsy, with curling lip. "No,
thank you; what I have done for you, Mrs. Delamere, is above any
reward."</p>

<p>"Above any reward!" stammered the other wondering if
she heard aright.</p>

<p>"I think so," responded Hagar, gravely. "I
have saved your honor."</p>

<p>"Saved my honor!" cried Mrs. Delamere, furiously.
"How dare you! How dare you!"</p>

<p>"I dare, because I happen to have read one of those
letters; I read only one, but I have no doubt that it is a sample
of the others. If Mr. Delamere read what I did, I am afraid you
would have to go through the Divorce Court with Lord Averley as
co-respondent."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are mistaken," stammered Mrs.
Delamere, drawn into defending herself. "There is nothing
wrong between us, I&mdash;I swear."</p>

<p>"It is no use to lie to me," said Hagar, curtly.
"I have seen what you said to the man; that is enough.
However, I have no call to judge you. I came to give you the
letters; you hold them in your hand; so I go."</p>

<p>"Wait! wait! You have been very good. Surely a little
money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am no blackmailer!" cried Hagar, wrathfully;
"but I have saved you from one. Had Lord Averley's
valet become possessed of those letters, you would have had to pay
thousands of pounds for them."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," whimpered the foolish little
woman. "You have been good and kind; you have saved me. Take
this ring as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I want no gifts from you," said Hagar, going to
the door.</p>

<p>"Why not&mdash;why not?"</p>

<p>Hagar looked back with a glance of immeasurable contempt.
"I take nothing from a woman who betrays her husband,"
she said, tranquilly. "Good-night, Mrs. Delamere&mdash;and be
careful how you write letters to your next lover. He may have a
valet also," and Hagar left the magnificent room, with Mrs.
Delamere standing in it, white with rage and terror and
humiliation. In those few contemptuous words of the poor gipsy
girl, her sin had come home to her.</p>

<p>Hagar had come to the West-end to see the woman who had written
the letters; now she walked back to her Lambeth pawn-shop to
interview the man to whom they had been sent. She was not a girl
who did things by halves; and, bent upon thwarting in every way the
scoundrelism of John Peters, she had sent a message to his master.
In reply Lord Averley had informed her that he would call on her at
the time and place mentioned in her letter. The time was nine
o'clock; the place, the dingy parlor of the pawn-shop; and
here Hagar intended to inform Lord Averley of the way in which she
had saved Mrs. Delamere from the greed of the valet. Also, she
intended to make him take back the casket and repay the money lent
on it. In all her dabblings in romance, Hagar never forgot that she
was a woman of business, and was bound to get as much money as
possible for the heir of the old miser who had fed and sheltered
her when she had come a fugitive to London. Hagar's ethics
would have been quite incomprehensible to the majority of
mankind.</p>

<p>True to the hour, Lord Averley made his appearance in
Carby's Crescent, and was admitted by Hagar to the back
parlor. He was a tall slender, fair man, no longer in his first
youth, with a colorless face, which was marked by a somewhat tired
expression. He looked a trifle surprised at the sight of
Hagar's rich beauty, having expected to find an old hag in
charge of a pawn-shop. However, he made no comment but bowed
gravely to the girl, and took the seat she offered to him. In the
light of the lamp Hagar looked long and earnestly at his handsome
face. There was a look of intellect on it which made her wonder how
he could have found satisfaction in the love of a frivolous doll
like Mrs. Delamere. But Hagar quite forgot for the moment that the
fullest delight of life lies in contrast.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you wondered at receiving a letter from a
pawn-shop," she said, abruptly.</p>

<p>"I confess I did," he replied, quietly: "but
because you mentioned that you had my casket I came. It is here,
you say?"</p>

<p>Hagar took the silver box off a near shelf, and placed it on the
table before him. "It was pawned here two weeks ago,"
she said, quietly. "I lent thirteen pounds; so, if you give
me that sum and the month's interest, you can have
it."</p>

<p>Without a word Lord Averley counted out the thirteen pounds, but
he had to ask her what the interest was. Hagar told him, and in a
few moments the transaction was concluded. Then Averley spoke.</p>

<p>"How did you know it was my casket?"</p>

<p>"The man who pawned it told me so."</p>

<p>"That was strange."</p>

<p>"Not at all, my lord. I made him tell me."</p>

<p>"H'm! you look clever," said Averley, looking
at her with interest. "May I ask the name of the man who
pawned this?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. He was your valet, John Peters."</p>

<p>"Peters!" echoed her visitor. "Oh, you must be
mistaken! Peters is an honest man!"</p>

<p>"He is a scoundrel and a thief, Lord Averley; and but for
me he would have been a blackmailer."</p>

<p>"A blackmailer?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There were letters in that casket."</p>

<p>"Were letters!" said Averley, hurriedly, and drew
the box towards him. "Do you know the secret?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I found the secret recess and the letters. It was
lucky for you that I did so. Your indiscreet speech to a friend
informed Peters that compromising letters were hidden in the
casket. He came here to find them; but I had already removed
them."</p>

<p>"And where are they now?"</p>

<p>"I gave them back to the married woman who wrote
them."</p>

<p>"How did you know who wrote them?" asked Lord
Averley, raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I read one of the letters, and then Peters told me the
name of the lady. He proposed to me to blackmail her. I ostensibly
agreed, and went to see the lady, to whom I gave back the letters.
I asked you here to-night to return the casket; also to put you on
your guard against John Peters. He is coming to see me to-morrow,
to get&mdash;as he thinks&mdash;the money obtained by means of the
letters. That is the whole story."</p>

<p>"It's a queer one," replied Averley, smiling.
"I shall certainly discharge Peters, but I won't
prosecute him for thieving. He knows about the letters, and they
are far too dangerous to be brought into court."</p>

<p>"They are not dangerous now, my lord. I have given them
back to the woman who wrote them."</p>

<p>"That was very good of you," said Averley,
satirically. "May I ask the name of the lady?"</p>

<p>"Surely you know! Mrs. Delamere."</p>

<p>Averley looked aghast for a moment, and then began to laugh
quietly. "My dear young lady," he said, as soon as he
could bring his mirth within bounds, "would it not have been
better to have consulted me before giving back those
letters?"</p>

<p>"No," said Hagar, boldly, "for you might not
have handed them over."</p>

<p>"Certainly I should not have handed them to Mrs.
Delamere!" said Averley, with a fresh burst of laughter.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because she never wrote them. My dear lady, I burnt all
the letters I got from Mrs. Delamere, and I told her I had done so.
The letters in this casket signed 'Beatrice' were from
a different lady altogether. I shall have to see Mrs. Delamere.
She'll never forgive me. Oh, what a comedy!" and he
began laughing again.</p>

<p>Hagar was annoyed. She had acted for the best, no doubt; but she
had given the letters to the wrong woman. Shortly the humor of the
mistake struck her also, and she laughed in concert with Lord
Averley.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I made a mistake," she said, at
length.</p>

<p>"You couldn't help it," replied Averley
rising. "It was that scoundrel Peters who put you wrong. But
I'll discharge him to-morrow, and get those letters of
Beatrice back from Mrs. Delamere."</p>

<p>"And you'll leave that poor little woman
alone," said Hagar, as she escorted him to the door.</p>

<p>"My dear lady, now that Mrs. Delamere has read those
letters she'll leave me alone&mdash;severely. She'll
never forgive me. Good-night. Oh, me, what a comedy!"</p>

<p>Lord Averley went off, casket and all. Peters never came back to
get his share of the blackmail, so Hagar supposed he had learnt
from his master what she had done. As to Mrs. Delamere, Hagar often
wondered what she said when she read those letters signed
"Beatrice." But only Lord Averley could have told her
that and Hagar never saw him again; nor did she ever see Peters the
blackmailer. Finally, she never set eyes again on the Cinque Cento
Florentine casket which had contained the love-letters of&mdash;the
wrong woman.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>Chapter XI<br>
The Tenth Customer And The Persian Ring</b>
</h2>

<p>ONE of the last customers of any note who came to the Lambeth
pawn-shop was a slender, wiry man with an Oriental face, not unlike
that of Hagar herself. His countenance was oval, his nose aquiline
in shape, and he possessed two dark sparkling eyes; also a long
black beard, well trimmed and well kept. In fact, this beard was
the neatest thing about him, as his dress&mdash;a European
garb&mdash;was miserably poor, and the purple-hued cloth which he
had twisted round his head for a turban was worn and soiled. He was
nevertheless a striking figure when he presented himself before
Hagar, and she examined him with particular interest. There was a
gipsy look about the tenth customer, which seemed to stamp him as
one of the gentle Romany. Even keen eyed Hagar was deceived.</p>

<p>"Are you of our people?" she asked, abruptly, after
looking at him for a moment or so.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," replied the man, in very good
English, but with a foreign accent. "What people you speak
of?"</p>

<p>"The Romany&mdash;the gipsy tribes."</p>

<p>"No, lady; I no of dem. I know what they are&mdash;oh,
yes, they in my own country as in dis."</p>

<p>"Where is your country?" demanded Hagar, vexed at
her mistake.</p>

<p>"Iran; wheat you call Persia," replied the customer.
"My name, lady, is Alee; I come from Ispahan dese two year.
Oh, yes; a long time I do stop in dis town."</p>

<p>"A Persian!" said Hagar, looking at his swarthy face
and delicate features. "I don't think I ever saw a
Persian before. You are very like one of the Romany; not at all
like a Gentile."</p>

<p>"Lady, I no Gentile, I no Christian; I am follower ob de
Prophet. May his name be blessed! But dis not what I do come to
speak," he added, with some impatience. "You give money
on ring, eh!"</p>

<p>"Let me see the ring first," said Hagar,
diplomatically.</p>

<p>Alee, as he called himself, slipped the ring in question off one
of his slender brown fingers, and handed it to her in silence. It
was a band of dead gold, rather broad, and set in it was an oval
turquoise of azure hue, marked with Arabic letters in gold. The
ring had the look of a talisman or amulet, as the queer
hieroglyphics on the stone seemed the words of some charm, stamped
thereon to avert evil. Hagar examined the ring carefully, as she
had never seen one like it before.</p>

<p>"It is a queer stone," she said, after looking
through a magnifying glass at the turquoise. "What do you
want on it?"</p>

<p>"One pound?" replied Alee, promptly; "just for
two&mdash;tree days. Eh, what! you give me dat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I think the ring is worth five times as much.
Here is the money; I'll make out the ticket in your name of
Alee. How do you spell it?"</p>

<p>The Persian took the ticket from Hagar, and in very fair English
letters wrote down his name and address. Then with a bow he turned
to leave the shop; but before he reached the door she called him
back.</p>

<p>"I say. Alee, what do these gold marks on this stone
mean?"</p>

<p>"Dey Arabic letters, lady. Dey a spell against de Jinns.
'In de name ob Allah de All-Merciful.' Dat what dem
letters say."</p>

<p>"They say a good deal with a word or two," muttered
Hagar. "Arabic must be something like shorthand. When do you
want back the ring?" she asked, aloud.</p>

<p>"In two&mdash;tree days," replied the Persian.
"Say dis week. Yes. Good night, lady; you keep dat ring all
right. Yes. So."</p>

<p>Alee took himself out of the shop with another bow, and Hagar,
after a further examination of the queer ring with its talismanic
inscription, put it away on a tray with other jewels. She wondered
very much if it had a story attached to it; and, having read the
"Arabian Nights" of late, she compared it in her own
mind to the ring of Aladdin. It looked like a jewel with a history,
did that inscribed turquoise.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the next day another Persian arrived. Hagar
recognized him as such from his resemblance to Alee; indeed, but
for the difference in expression the two men might have passed for
twins. Alee had a soft look in his eyes, a melancholy twist to his
mouth; while this countryman of his had a hawk-like and dangerous
fierceness stamped on his lean face. He was dressed similarly to
Alee, but wore a yellow turban instead of a purple one, and gave
his name to Hagar as Mohommed; also, he took out of his pocket the
pawn-ticket, which he handed to the girl.</p>

<p>"Alee, my countryman, he send dis," said he, in
broken but very fair English; "he want de ring which he leave
here."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he come for it himself?" asked
Hagar, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Alee ill; him bery bad; he ask me to get de ring. But if
you no gib me&mdash;why, I tell Alee; he come himself
den."</p>

<p>"Oh, there is no necessity for him to do so,"
replied Hagar, getting the ring. "You would not have the
ticket with you if everything was not square. Here is Alee's
property. One pound and interest. Thank you, Mr. Mohommed. By the
way, you are a friend of Alee?"</p>

<p>"Yis; I come to dis place when he come," replied
Mohommed, passively, "him very great frien' of me. Two
year we in dis land."</p>

<p>"Both of you speak English very well."</p>

<p>"Tank you, yes; we learn our Inglees in Persia for long
time; and when we here we spike always&mdash;always. Goot-tay; I do
take dis to Alee."</p>

<p>"I say," called out Hagar, "has that ring a
story?"</p>

<p>"What, dis? I no know. Him charm against de Jinn; but
dat's all. Goot-day; I go queek to Alee. Goot-day."</p>

<p>He went away with the ring on his finger, leaving Hagar
disappointed that the strange jewel with its golden letters had not
some wild tale attached to it. However, the ring was gone, and she
never expected to hear anything more of it, or of the two Persians.
A week passed, and no Alee made his appearance; so Hagar concluded
that everything was right, and that he had really sent Mohommed to
redeem the ring. On the eighth day of its redemption she was
undeceived, for Alee himself made his appearance in the shop. Hagar
was surprised to see him.</p>

<p>The poor man looked ill, and his brown face was terribly lean
and worn in its looks. An expression of anxiety lurked in his soft
black eyes, and he could hardly command his voice as he asked her
to give him the ring. The request was so unexpected that Hagar
could only stare at him in silence. It was a moment or so before
she could find words.</p>

<p>"The ring!" she said, in tones of astonishment.
"Why, you have it! Did not your friend Mohommed give
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mohommed!" cried Alee, clenching his hands; and the
next moment he had fallen insensible on the outer floor of the
shop. The single mention of the name Mohommed in connection with
the ring had stricken the poor Persian to the heart. His entrance,
his behavior, his fainting&mdash;all three were unexpected and
inexplicable.</p>

<p>Recovering from her first surprise, Hagar ran to the assistance
of the fallen man. He was soon revived by the application of cold
water, and when he could rise Hagar, like the Good Samaritan she
was, conducted him into the back parlor and made him lie down on
the sofa. But more than ordinary weakness was the matter with the
man; he was suffering from want of food, and told Hagar faintly
that he had eaten nothing for two days. At once the girl set
victuals before him, and warmed some soup to nourish him. Alee ate
sparingly but well; and although he refused to touch wine, as a
follower of the Prophet, he soon became stronger and more cheerful.
His gratitude to Hagar knew no bounds.</p>

<p>"You are as charitable as Fatima, the daughter ob our Lord
Mohommed," said he, gratefully, "and your good deed, it
will be talked ob by de angel Gabriel on de Las'
Day."</p>

<p>"How is it you are so poor?" asked Hagar, restive
under this praise.</p>

<p>"Ah, lady, dat is one big long story."</p>

<p>"Connected with the ring?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; dat ring would haf mate me reech,"
replied the Persian, with a sigh; "but now dat weeked one
vill git my moneys. Aha!" said Alee, furiously, "dat
Mohommed is de son ob a burnt fazzer!"</p>

<p>"He is a scoundrel certainly! How did he get the
pawn-ticket?"</p>

<p>"He took it away when I ill."</p>

<p>"Why did he want the ring?"</p>

<p>Alee reflected for a moment, and then he evidently made up his
mind what course to pursue. "I weel tell you, lady," he
said, looking with thankful eyes at Hagar. "You haf been good
to me. I weel tell you de story ob my life&mdash;ob de
ring."</p>

<p>"I knew that ring had some story connected with it,"
said Hagar, complacently. "Go on, Alee; I am all
attention."</p>

<p>The Persian obeyed forthwith; but, as his English was imperfect
at times, it will be as well to set forth the story in the
vernacular. Being still weak, it took Alee some time to tell the
whole tale; but Hagar heard him patiently to the end. His narrative
was not without interest.</p>

<p>"I was born in Ispahan," said the Persian, in his
grave voice, "and I am a Mirza&mdash;what you call here a
prince&mdash;in my own country. My father was an officer of the
Shah's household, and very wealthy. When he died I, as his
only son, inherited his wealth. I was young, rich, and not at all
bad-looking, so I expected to lead a pleasant life. The Shah, who
had protected my father, continued the sun of his favor to me; and
I accompanied him to the Court at Teheran, where I speedily became
high in his favor. But alas!" added Alee, in the flowery
language of his country, "soon did I cover the face of
pleasure with the veil of mourning, and ride the horse of folly
into the country of sorrow." He paused, and then added, with
a sigh: "Her name was Ayesha."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Hagar, the cynic. "I was waiting to
hear the name of the woman. She ruined you, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"She and another," sighed Alee, stroking his beard.
"I melted like wax in the flame of her beauty, and my heart
turned to water at the glance of her eyes. She was Georgian, and
fairer than the chief wife of Sulieman bin Daoud. But alas! alas!
what saith Sa'adi; 'Wed a charmer and wed
sorrow!'"</p>

<p>"Well," said Hagar, rather patiently, "I know
all about her looks. Go on with the story."</p>

<p>"On my head be it!" said Alee. "I purchased
this Georgian in Ispahan, and made her my third wife; but so lovely
and clever she was, that I speedily raised her to the rank of the
first. I adored her beauty, and marveled at her wit. She sang like
a bulbul, and danced like a Peri."</p>

<p>"She seems to have been a wonder, Alee! Go on."</p>

<p>"There was a man called Achmet, who hated me very
much," continued Alee, his eyes lighting up fiercely at the
mention of the name. "He saw that I was rich, and favored by
the King of Kings, so he set his wits to work to ruin me. Having
heard of my beautiful wife Ayesha, he told the Shah of her
loveliness, which was that of a houri in Paradise. Fired by the
description, my Sovereign visited at my house, and I received him
with due splendor. He saw all my treasures&mdash;among others, my
wife."</p>

<p>"I thought you Turks never presented your wives to
strangers?"</p>

<p>"We are Persians, not Turks," corrected Alee,
quietly, "and the Shah is no stranger in the houses of his
subjects. Also, he has the right to pass the forbidden door to the
Abode of Felicity."</p>

<p>"What is the Abode of Felicity?"</p>

<p>"The harem, lady. But to tell you the story of my
ruin.</p>

<p>"The Shah saw my beautiful Ayesha, and her burning glances
were as arrows of delight in his heart. He returned to his palace
with a desire to possess my treasure. Achmet, who had right of
access to the person of the Shah, strengthened this desire, and
declared that I was unhappy with Ayesha."</p>

<p>"And were you?"</p>

<p>Alee sighed. "After the coming of the King of Kings I
was," he confessed. "My wife wished to enter the royal
harem, and warm herself in the glory of the royal sun. She was
silent and melancholy, or cross and fierce. I did what I could to
console her, but she refused to listen to me, treated me as dirt
beneath her feet, and sometimes she even smote me on the mouth with
her pearl-embroidered slipper. Tales of our constant quarrels were
carried to the Shah by the perfidious Achmet who declared that I
ill-treated my beautiful Georgian. At last Achmet told the King
that I had wished I were rid of the woman, if only for the meanest
jewel worn by his august self."</p>

<p>"Did you say that?"</p>

<p>"In a fit of rage one day I said something like it,"
said Alee, darkly; "but I never intended my foolish speech to
be taken seriously. However these idle words were reported to the
Shah, and he sent for me. 'Alee,' said he, 'it
has been said that thou deemest the meanest thing worn by us of
more value than your wife Ayesha. If that be so, take this ring,
which we give thee freely, and surrender thy lightly-valued wife to
dwell in the shadow of our throne. Thou hast my leave to go.'
Lady, I bowed myself to the ground, I took the ring you know of,
and I went."</p>

<p>"Did you not say that you wished to keep
Ayesha?"</p>

<p>"No; the word of the Shah is law. Had I expressed such a
wish I should have lost my head; as it was, I lost my wife.
Returning home, I made known the Shah's desire, and urged her
to fly with me beyond his power. Desirous of entering the royal
serail, however, she refused, and so I carried her off by force. I
drugged her one night, placed her on a camel, and set out for the
nearest seaport disguised as a merchant."</p>

<p>"Was your flight successful?"</p>

<p>"Alas, no," replied Alee, in melancholy tones.
"Achmet was on the watch, and had me followed. My wife was
taken from me by force, but only too willingly on her own part. For
daring to disobey the royal command I suffered the bastinado on the
soles of my feet until I fainted away."</p>

<p>"Poor Alee!"</p>

<p>"Mad with anger, I let the wrath of the heart overpower
the judgment of the mind, and rashly joined in a conspiracy to
overthrow the King of Kings. Again my evil genius Achmet thwarted
and discovered me. I was forced to fly from Persia to save my life;
and all my wealth was forfeited to the royal treasury. A goodly
portion of it, however, was given to Achmet for his having found
out the conspiracy. After many adventures, which I need not relate
here, I came to this land, where I have lived in poverty and misery
for two years. My wife is a queen in the serail of the Shah; my
enemy is the ruler of a province; and I, lady, am the exile you
see. All that I carried out of the Shah's kingdom was the
ring which he gave me in exchange for my beautiful
Ayesha."</p>

<p>He paused, and Hagar waited for him to continue the story.
Finding that he still kept silent, she addressed him impatiently:
"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;except that since I have been here it has been
told to me that both Achmet and Ayesha wish to get me back to
Persia, that they may kill me. The Georgian never forgave me for
carrying her away, and only my death will glut her vengeance. As
for Achmet, he is never free from dread while I live, and wishes me
to die also. If they can manage it, those two will have me carried
back to Persia, and there have me slain."</p>

<p>"They can't take you out of London against your
will."</p>

<p>Alee shook his head. "Who knows!" said he.
"There is the case of the Chinaman who was lured into the
Embassy to be sent back to China. If the Government of England had
not interfered he would have been a dead man by this time. I keep
always away from the Persian Embassy."</p>

<p>"You are wise to do so," replied Hagar, who
remembered the case. "But about the ring. Why did you pawn
it, and why did Mohommed steal it by means of the
pawn-ticket?"</p>

<p>"There was a friend of mine in Persia," explained
Alee, "who saved for me out of my property seized by the Shah
a box of jewels. Knowing that I was starving in this land, he sent
the Jewels to me in charge of a servant. I received a letter from
him, in which he stated that the servant had been instructed to
give up the Jewels to me when I produced the ring. I foolishly told
Mohommed about this, and one night he tried to thieve the ring from
me, thinking that he would show it to my friend's servant and
get my jewels. In fear lest he should obtain it, I pawned it with
you for safety, until the servant should arrive."</p>

<p>"Is the servant here now?"</p>

<p>"He arrived last week," replied Alee, mournfully,
"and he is now waiting for me at Southampton. But, alas! I
speak foolishly. When I fell ill after pawning the ring, Mohommed
stole the ticket, and, as you know, he obtained the ring. I have no
doubt that by this time he has shown it to the servant of my
friend, and is possessed of the jewels. Mohommed the accursed is
rich, and I remain poor. Now, lady, you know why a darkness came
over my spirit, and why I fell as one bereft of life. Surely, I am
the sport of Fortune, and the most unlucky of men! I am he of whom
the poet spoke when he said:</p>

<p class="poem">'Strive not, contend not; thy future is
woe;<br>
Accept of thy sorrows, for Fortune's thy foe.'
"</p>

<p>The poor man recited this couplet in faltering tones, and burst
into tears, rocking himself to and fro in an agony of grief. Hagar
was sorry for this unfortunate person, who had been so unlucky as
to lose wife, and wealth, and country. She gave him the only
comfort that was in her power.</p>

<p>"Here are twenty shillings," said she, placing some
silver in his hand. "Perhaps Mohommed has not yet gone to
Southampton; or it may be that the servant with your jewels has not
yet arrived. Go down to Hampshire, and see if you can recover your
ring."</p>

<p>Alee thanked her with great emotion, and shortly afterwards left
the shop, promising to tell her of the issue of this adventure.
Hagar saw him go away with the fullest belief in his honesty of
purpose, and perfect trust in the truth of his story; but later on,
when alone, she began to wonder if she had not been gulfed by two
sharpers. The whole story told by Alee was so like an adventure of
the "Arabian Nights" that Hagar became more than a
trifle doubtful of its truth. As the days went by, and Alee did not
return as he had promised, she fancied that her belief was a true
one.</p>

<p>"Those two Persians have played a comedy of which I have
been the dupe," she said to herself; "it has all been
done to get money. And yet I am not sure; the pair would not take
all that trouble for a miserable twenty shillings. After all,
Alee's story may be true; and he may be at Southampton trying
to recover his ring and jewels."</p>

<p>In this conjecture she was perfectly right, for all the days of
his absence Alee had been at Southampton vainly looking for
Mohommed the thief. His twenty shillings had soon been expanded;
but luckily he had met with an Englishman whom he had known in
Persia. This gentleman, an Oriental scholar and a liberal-minded
man, had recognized Alee, dirty and miserable, as he haunted the
Southampton quays looking for the servant of his friend and the
recreant Mohommed. Carthew&mdash;for that was the
Englishman's name&mdash;was profoundly shocked to find one
whom he had known wealthy in such misery. He took Alee to his
hotel, supplied him with food and clothes, and requested to know
how the Persian had fallen so low. Alee told this Samaritan the
same story as he had told Hagar; but, versed in the craft and
topsy-turvydom of the East, Carthew was not so surprised or
sceptical as the gipsy girl had been. He was sorry for poor Alee,
who had been for so long the butt of Fortune, and determined to
befriend him.</p>

<p>"I suppose there is no chance of your regaining the
Shah's favor?" he asked the unfortunate man in his own
tongue.</p>

<p>"Alas! no. What is, is. I conspired against the King of
Kings; I was betrayed by Achmet; so there is no way in which I can
approach again the Asylum of the Universe."</p>

<p>"Humph! looks like it," growled Carthew, stroking
his white beard. "And Achmet, that son of a burnt father, is
high in favor?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he is the governor of a province, and as he is
friendly with Ayesha, who is now the favorite of the Shah, he is
above all fortune. It is strange," added Alee, reflectively,
"that those so rich and high-placed should wish to get me
back to my death."</p>

<p>"They know they have wronged you, my friend, and so they
hate you. But you are safe in England. Even the Shah cannot seize
you here."</p>

<p>Alee reminded Carthew, as he had done Hagar, of the Chinese
kidnapping case which had created so great a stir in England.
Carthew laughed. "Why, don't you see that the case is
your very safeguard?" said he. "If the Persian Embassy
seized you, they would have to release you. Remember, now that I
have met you, you are not friendless. You stay by me, Alee, and you
will be safe from the vengeance of your wife and Achmet."</p>

<p>"But I do not wish to live on your charity."</p>

<p>"You needn't," said the Oriental scholar,
bluntly. "As you know, I am translating the Epic of Kings
which Ferdusi wrote. You must assist me, and I'll engage you
as my secretary. In a few months you'll be on your feet
again, and no doubt I shall be able to find you some regular
employment. As for that scoundrel Mohommed who stole the ring,
I'll set the police after him. By the way, I suppose he dare
not go back to Persia again!"</p>

<p>"No; he was a conspirator also," replied Alee.
"We fled together from the wrath of the Shah. He was nearly
captured and beheaded in mistake for me, as we are so like one
another; but he managed to escape, and joined me in England. Still,
he is safer here than I, as he has no powerful enemies who desire
his return to Persia."</p>

<p>"It's a case of Dilly duck, come and be
killed," said Carthew, with a grim laugh. "Well, we
must hunt up the scoundrel, and find your jewels if possible. Who
was the friend who sent them to you?"</p>

<p>"Feshnavat, of Shiraz. He was a friend of my
father's, and is, as you know, a great merchant."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know him," said Carthew, nodding; "a
fine old man. I have no doubt he recovered your jewels, and sent
them here all right. The pity is that he made their delivery depend
upon the showing of the Shah's ring. Though, to be sure, he
never anticipated that a villain would rob you of it. Truly, Alee,
you are the most unlucky of men!"</p>

<p>"Not since I met with you, O comforter of the poor!"
replied Alee, gratefully "You have been charitable and good,
even as the woman who helped me in the great city. But to both
reward shall come. What says the poet:</p>

<p class="poem">'Give freely to the poor your gold;<br>
What's spent will come back
forty-fold.'&nbsp;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Alee," said Carthew, with a half-sigh,
"your couplet and gratitude are but bringing the posey of the
East into the prose of the West. You are in London, my
friend&mdash;in ordinary, commonplace London; and not with
Sa'adi in the gardens of Shiraz."</p>

<p>Carthew was as good as his word, and employed Alee to aid him in
translating the Epic of Kings. With the first money which he earned
the Persian visited Hagar&mdash;to repay her, and to tell her all
that had befallen him since he had left her shop. Hagar was pleased
to see him, and gratified at the refunding of the money; for such
action quite restored her faith in Alee, which she had been
beginning to lose. She asked after Mohommed; but concerning that
rascal the Persian was unable to give any news.</p>

<p>"He haf took my ring and jewels," sighed Alee,
mournfully, "and in some lan' far away he live on my
moneys. But the justice of Allah, who sees the black beetle in the
black rock, will smite him. He will fall in his splendor and
evil-doing, as the people of Od went down to the dust. It is
written."</p>

<p>In the meantime Carthew, who had a genuine liking for Alee, made
all inquiries about the absent Mohommed and the missing ring. For
many weeks he learnt nothing; but finally chance set him on the
track of the thief, and in the end he learnt all. He discovered
what had become of Mohommed and of the ring; and the discovery
astonished him not a little. It was an Attache of the Persian
Embassy who revealed the truth; and Carthew judged it best that the
lips of this same man should relate the story to Alee.</p>

<p>"My friend," said he one day to the Persian
"do you know a countryman of yours called Mirza
Baba?"</p>

<p>"I have heard of him," replied Alee, slowly,
"but he has not seen my face, nor have I beheld him. Why do
you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because he knows what has become of your ring."</p>

<p>"And of Mohommed? Oh, my friend, tell me of these
things!" cried the Persian.</p>

<p>"Nay, Alee; it is better that the truth should come from
the lips of Mirza Baba himself. I will ask him here to tell
you."</p>

<p>"But he may learn who I am!" muttered Alee, in
dismay.</p>

<p>"I think not, as he has never seen your face,"
replied Carthew, smiling, "besides&mdash;" He broke off
with a nod. "Well, you'll hear the story as he tells
it; but call all your self-command and Oriental impassiveness to
your aid. You'll need courage."</p>

<p>"Let it be as you say," rejoined Alee, folding his
hands. "To-day and to-morrow are in the hands of the
All-Wise."</p>

<p>True to his promise, Carthew next day received Mirza Baba in his
house, and introduced him to Alee, who gave his countryman a
feigned name. The Persian of the Embassy, who was a very great man
indeed, paid little attention to Alee, whom he regarded simply as
the secretary of Carthew, and as one quite beneath his notice. This
neglect suited Alee, who sat meekly on one side, and listened to
his own story, and to the story of Mohommed and the missing ring.
Mirza Baba, in response to the request of Carthew, told it over
pipes and coffee, and greatly astonished Alee in the telling.</p>

<p>"You know," said the Mirza, addressing himself
particularly to Carthew, and quite ignoring his own
countryman," that this dog of an Alee, on whose head be
curses! had the folly to conspire against the peace of the
Shah&mdash;on whom be blessings! He escaped from the Land of the
Sun, and came to this island of thine. Hither he was traced, and to
assert the majesty of the Asylum of the Universe it was resolved
that this son of a burnt father should be brought back to Persia
for punishment. The Banou Ayesha, who is the Pearl of the East, was
bent upon seeing the head of this traitor, to whom aforetime she
had been wife, ere the King of Kings had deigned to cast his eyes
upon her. Also Achmet, the most zealous of governors, who had
discovered the conspiracy of the evil-minded Alee, wished to punish
him. Orders were sent to our Embassy that Alee should be taken,
even in the streets of London, and sent back in chains to the Court
of Teheran; but this, it was difficult to do.</p>

<p>"H'm! I think so!" replied Carthew, drily.
"The Chinese Embassy tried on that game with Sun Yat, and had
to give him up. The English Government do not recognize the
Embassies as so many neutral territories in London."</p>

<p>"It is true; I know it," answered Baba, coolly.
"Well, as there was no chance of capturing Alee in that way,
it was resolved to employ stratagem. A letter, purporting to be
written by Feshnavat, of Shiraz, was sent to this traitor, in which
it was set forth that a box of jewels, saved from the wreck of his
property, was being sent to England, and that it would be given up
at Southampton to the bearer of the Shah's ring. You know of
the ring, my friend?" added the Mirza.</p>

<p>"Yes; the ring given by the Shah to Alee in exchange for
his wife. Go on."</p>

<p>"That is so. The dog surrendered his spouse, who is now
the Pearl of Persia, for the meanest ring worn by the Shah. It was
known that he bore it to this land, so it was arranged by the Pearl
and Achmet that such ring should be the means to lure this traitor
to his death. Well, my friend," continued Baba, with a
chuckle, "the plot contrived by the wit of Banou Ayesha was
successful. Alee went to Southampton, and finding the supposed
servant of Feshnavat, produced the ring, and demanded the jewels.
This was at night, so at once the traitor was seized, and placed on
board the waiting vessel to be taken to Persia."</p>

<p>"That was very clever," said Carthew, stealing a
glance at Alee, who was painfully white. "And what happened
then?"</p>

<p>"Lies and misfortune," replied Baba Mirza.
"This Alee, when he learnt the truth, swore that he was not
the man we sought, but one Mohommed, and that he had stolen the
ring to get the jewels. Of course, no one believed this story,
which, without doubt, was a mere trick to save his life. He was
carefully watched, and was told that on arriving in Persia he would
be beheaded at once. In fear of this death, the wretch escaped one
night from the cabin in which he was confined, and threw himself
into the sea. He left behind him the ring; and this, seeing that
the man was dead, was taken to Persia, in proof that Alee had been
seized. The ring is now worn by the Pearl of Persia; but never has
she ceased regretting that Alee escaped her vengeance."</p>

<p>After telling this story, which was listened to, with outward
composure but inward fear by Alee, the Mirza took his leave. When
alone with the Persian, Carthew turned to address him.</p>

<p>"Well, Alee," said he, kindly, "you see
Fortune has not forsaken you yet! She has saved you, and punished
Mohommed for his theft."</p>

<p>"What is, is," said Alee, with Oriental
impassiveness; "but in truth it is wondrous that I escaped
the snare. Now I can live in peace; for, thinking me dead, neither
Ayesha nor Achmet will seek me again. I have lost the ring, it is
true; but I have gained my life. Now I shall take another name, and
dwell for the span of my days in England."</p>

<p>"It is a queer ending to the story," said Carthew,
reflectively.</p>

<p>"The tale is as strange as any of the 'Thousand and
One Nights,'" replied Alee. "It should be written
in letters of gold. It is of such that the poet writes:</p>

<p class="poem">"Go forward on thy path, tho' darkness
hides it;<br>
Thy destiny is sure, for Allah guides it."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>Chapter XII<br>
The Passing Of Hagar</b>
</h2>

<p>IT was now two years since Hagar had presented herself to the
astonished eyes of Jacob Dix, and one year since the death of the
old miser had left her in sole charge of the pawnshop. During all
these months she had striven hard to do her duty, for the sake of
the man who had taken pity on her poverty. She had toiled early and
late; she had neglected no opportunity to make bargains; and she
had lived penuriously the meanwhile. All moneys accruing from the
business she had paid into the bank; and all accounts of receipts
and payments she had placed in the hands of Vark, the lawyer. At
any time that Goliath chose to arrive, she was ready to hand over
the pawn-shop and property to him, after which it was her intention
to leave.</p>

<p>As yet she had no idea in her head what was to become of her
when the arrival of the lost heir reduced her to the position of a
pauper. It had, indeed, occurred to her that it would be best to
return to her tribe again, and take up the old gipsy life. On
account of Goliath she had exiled herself from the Romany tents: so
when he came into his inheritance she would be free to return
thereto. As a wealthy man, Jimmy Dix, <i>alias</i> Goliath, would
not care to spend his life in roaming the country with vagrants;
and thus she would be relieved of his presence. Hagar was getting
very tired of the shop and the weary life of Carby's
Crescent; and often the nostalgia of the roads came upon her.
Several times of late she had wished that Goliath would claim his
heritage, and relieve her of the irksome task which she had taken
on her own shoulders, out of gratitude to Jacob Dix. But as yet the
absent heir had not made his appearance.</p>

<p>Hagar knew very well that Eustace Lorn was looking for him.
Pursuant to the promise he had given her, and expecting the reward
of her hand on his return, Lorn had been these many months on the
trail of the missing man. All over England and Scotland had he
tramped, inquiring of every gipsy, every vagrant, every town scamp,
the whereabouts of Goliath; but all in vain, for Goliath seemed to
have vanished completely. Indeed, Eustace began to fear that he was
not in the United Kingdom, else he would certainly have heard of
him, or the man would have seen in the newspapers the advertisement
inquiring for his whereabouts. From time to time Eustace wrote to
Hagar of his ill success, and received replies wherein she
expressed her detestation of the shop, and bidding him continue his
search; whereupon, encouraged to fresh exertions, Eustace would
resume his wanderings. His adventures while thus engaged were many
and various; and in the end his efforts were crowned with
success.</p>

<p>One day, while Hagar was seated rather disconsolately in the
back parlor, the side-door, which had been used by Dix for such of
his friends as wished to dispose of stolen goods&mdash;a form of
business which Hagar had abandoned&mdash;was opened boldly, and a
tall man strode into the room. Hagar rose indignantly to repel the
intruder, who had no right to enter by that way, when suddenly she
saw his countenance, and fell back a step.</p>

<p>"Goliath!" she said with a pale face.</p>

<p>The tall man&mdash;he was almost a giant in point of height and
size&mdash;nodded and smiled. He had closely-cropped red hair, and
a rather brutal cast of countenance, by no means prepossessing.
Again familiarily nodding to Hagar, who recoiled from him in
aversion, he seated himself in a large armchair by the fire, which
had formerly been used by dead Jacob Dix.</p>

<p>"My father's chair," said he, with a grin.
"I have come to take possession of it, my dear."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear it," replied Hagar,
recovering the use of her tongue. "Certainly it was about
time, Mr. Dix."</p>

<p>"Don't call me Mister, or Dix, my dear! To you I
shall always be Goliath&mdash;your Goliath."</p>

<p>"Indeed you shan't!" retorted Hagar, in a
spirited manner. "I hate you now just as much as I did when
you forced me to leave my people."</p>

<p>"That is uncommon cruel of you, seeing as you have been
wearing my shoes all this time!"</p>

<p>"I have been wearing your father's shoes, you mean,
and for your benefit solely. I did so simply because your father
was good enough to take me in, after you had exiled me from the
Romany."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know all about that, Cousin Hagar. We're
cousins, ain't we?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and we are likely to continue cousins. But I'm
tired of this sparring, Goliath. Where have you been all this time?
and how did you learn that your father was dead?"</p>

<p>"Where I've been I'll tell you later,"
replied Goliath, rendered surly by the attitude of Hagar,
"and as to how I knowed the old 'un was gone&mdash;why,
a cove called Lorn told me just after I got out."</p>

<p>"Got out!" cried Hagar, noting the queer wording of
the phrase; "so you have been in prison, Goliath!"</p>

<p>"You're a sharp one, you are!" grinned the
red-haired man. "Yes, I've been in quod though I
didn't intend to tell you so yet. I was Number Forty-three
till a week ago, and they ticketed me for horse-coping. I got two
years, and was took just arter you gave me the slip in New Forest;
so now you know how I didn't see your noospaper notice about
the old 'un kicking the bucket."</p>

<p>"You might speak of your father with more respect!"
said Hagar, in a disdainful tone; "but what can one expect
from a convict?"</p>

<p>"Come, none of that, cousin, or I'll twist your
neck."</p>

<p>"You dare to lay a finger on me, and I'll kill
you!" retorted Hagar, fiercely.</p>

<p>"Yah! You're as much a spitfire as ever!"</p>

<p>"More so&mdash;to you!" replied the girl. "I
hate you now as I did when I left my tribe. Now you have come back,
I'll go."</p>

<p>"And who is to look after the shop?"</p>

<p>"That is your business. My task here is ended. To-morrow
I'll show you all the accounts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Won't you share the property with me?" asked
Goliath, in a wheedling tone.</p>

<p>"No, I shan't! To-morrow you must come with me and
see Vark, to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vark!" echoed Goliath, starting to his feet;
"is it that old villain who is to hand me over my
tin?"</p>

<p>"Yes; your father employed him, so I
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't think! there ain't no time for
thinking! Job! I'd better get my money afore the head of old
Vark is stove in!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Hagar, bewildered by his
tone.</p>

<p>"Mean!" echoed Goliath, pausing at the door.
"Well, I was in quod, as I told ye; there I came across Bill
Smith&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The mandarin customer?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we managed to talk&mdash;how it don't matter
to you; but I guess, when Bill Smith's out of quod, that Vark
is bound for Kingdom-come! And Bill Smith is out!"</p>

<p>"What!" shrieked Hagar, alive at once to the danger
which threatened the lawyer. "Out! Escaped?"</p>

<p>"That's the case. He got away last week, and they
ain't got him yet. I'd best go and tell Vark to load
his pistols. I don't want the old villain choked until I get
my property square. You come too, cousin."</p>

<p>"Not just now. To-morrow."</p>

<p>"To-morrow won't do for me!" growled Goliath.
"You come to-day, quick!"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Hagar, very disdainfully, "it is no
use your taking that tone with me, Goliath. I must get ready my
accounts to-night; and tomorrow, if you come here, I'll take
them with you to Vark. When everything is set out to your
satisfaction, you can enter into your property at once."</p>

<p>"Then you won't come now?"</p>

<p>"No; I have given you my answer."</p>

<p>"You'd best give me a pound or two," said
Goliath, crossly. "I'm cleaned out, and I need money to
get a bed for the night. You are as obstinate as ever, I see; but
if you won't come, you won't. But I'll go and see
Vark myself, and tell him about Bill Smith."</p>

<p>After which speech Goliath, with money in his pocket, went off
to see the lawyer, cursing Hagar freely for her obstinacy. The man
entirely forgot how she had devoted herself these many months to
looking after his property; all he thought of was, that he loved
her now, as much as he had done in the old days, and that she was
still set on having nothing to do with him. Had she been an
ordinary girl, he might have broken her spirit; but it was useless
to attempt bullying with Hagar. She could give as good as she got;
and this great, hulking Goliath could only admire and desire this
spirited gipsy girl who disdained him and his money.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hagar to herself as she saw the last of
him, "I have had one unexpected visitor; so by all the laws
of coincidence I should have another to-day. I never knew one
strange event happen without another following on its
heels."</p>

<p>Hagar did not think precisely in so bookish a fashion, but the
gist of her ideas was as above; and this proved correct before
nightfall, at which time the unexpected second event duly occurred.
This was none other than the arrival of Eustace Lorn, who entered
the shop with a smile on his lips and a love light in his eyes. The
girl knew his step&mdash;by some intuition of love, no
doubt&mdash;and rushed to meet him with outstretched hands. These
Eustace clasped ardently in his own; but as yet&mdash;so dignified
was the attitude of Hagar&mdash;he did not venture to kiss her. His
speech was warmer than his actions.</p>

<p>"Hagar! my dear Hagar!" he cried, in rapture,
"at last I have come back. Are you not glad to see
me?"</p>

<p>"I am delighted!" replied Hagar, beaming with
pleasure&mdash;"more delighted than I was to see
Goliath."</p>

<p>"Ah! he has returned, then? I found him at last, you see;
and I recognized him from your description."</p>

<p>"He did not tell me of your meeting, Eustace."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was in this way," replied Lorn, as they
entered the parlor together. "I had searched for him
everywhere, as you know, but could not find him. Where he has been
all these months I cannot say, as at our interview he refused to
tell me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he had a good reason for his silence," said
Hagar, noting the fact that Goliath had kept quiet concerning his
prison experiences.</p>

<p>"I dare say," laughed Lorn. "He looks a scamp.
Well, I was down near Weybridge, resting by the roadside, when I
saw a tall red-haired man passing. Remembering your description of
Jimmy Dix, I felt sure that it was him; and I called out the name
'Goliath.' To my surprise, instead of stopping, he took
to his heels."</p>

<p>"Ah, he had a good reason for that also."</p>

<p>"Not an honest one, I am afraid. Well; I ran after him,
and in spite of his long legs I managed to catch him up. Then he
showed fight; but when I explained who I was, and who you were, and
how his father had died and left a fortune, Goliath grew quiet and
friendly. He fraternized with me, accepted the loan of a few
shillings&mdash;which was all I could spare&mdash;and took himself
off to London. You have seen him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and to-morrow I make up my accounts and give him
over his property. Then I shall be free&mdash;free! Oh!"
cried Hagar, stretching her arms, "how delicious it will be
to be free once more&mdash;to leave this weary London, and see the
sky and stars, sunrise and sunset&mdash;to hear the birds, and
breathe the fresh air of the moors! I am going back to my tribe,
you know."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Eustace, taking her hand;
"but I do know that I love you, and I have an idea that you
love me. In this case, I think that instead of going back to your
tribe you should come to your husband."</p>

<p>"My husband&mdash;you!" cried Hagar, with a charming
blush.</p>

<p>"If you love me," said Eustace, and then was
quiet.</p>

<p>"You leave the burden of proposing on me," cried
Hagar, again. "Well, my dear, I will not hide from you that I
do love you. Hush! let me go on. I have seen but little of you, yet
what I have seen I have loved, every inch of it. I can read faces
and estimate character better than most, and I know that you are a
true, good, honorable man, who will make me, a poor gipsy, a better
husband than I dared to expect. Yes, Eustace, I love you. If you
care I will marry you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Care! Marry me!" said Lorn, in rapture. "Why,
my angel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment," interrupted Hagar more seriously.
"You know that I have no money, Eustace. Jacob Dix did not
leave me a penny. I refuse to take anything from Goliath, who wants
to marry me; and to-morrow I leave this shop as poor as when I came
into it two years ago. Now, you are poor also; so two paupers are
foolish to marry."</p>

<p>"But I am not poor!" cried Eustace,
smiling&mdash;"that is, I am not rich, but I have sufficient
for you and me to lead the life we love."</p>

<p>"But the life I love is the gipsy life," objected
Hagar.</p>

<p>"I also am Romany by instinct," said Eustace
joyously. "Have I not led the life of a vagabond these many
months while looking for Goliath? See here, my dearest girl; when I
left you I sold the Florentine Dante to a collector of books for a
goodly sum. With the money I sought a caravan, and stocked it with
books suitable for the country folk. All this time, my dear, I have
been traveling with my caravan from town to town, earning my living
by selling books; and I find it, really and truly, a very
profitable concern. I ask you to be my wife&mdash;to share my
caravan and gipsy life; so if you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eustace!" cried Hagar, joyfully, and threw her arms
round his neck. That was all; the situation adjusted itself between
them without further words. When the pair stepped out into
Carby's Crescent to see the caravan&mdash;it was round the
corner&mdash;they were already betrothed. For once in this world
the course of true love was running smoothly. To marry Eustace; to
live in a caravan; to wander about the country in true Bohemian
fashion&mdash;Hagar could conceive of no sweeter existence. At last
she was rewarded for her toils in the pawn-shop.</p>

<p>"This is our future home, Hagar," said Eustace, and
pointed to the caravan.</p>

<p>It was a very spick and span vehicle, painted a light canary
color, picked out with pale blue; and on either side was
inscribed&mdash;also in azure&mdash;the legend, "E. Lorn,
Bookseller." A sleek gray horse in brown harness was between
the shafts; and the windows of the caravan were barred with brass
rods and curtained with the whitest of curtains. Hagar fell in love
with this delightful Noah's ark&mdash;as Eustace playfully
called it&mdash;and clapped her hands. As it was about six
o'clock and twilight, the street was almost emptied of
people, so Hagar could indulge in her raptures to her heart's
content.</p>

<p>"O Eustace, Eustace! 'Tis beautiful! 'tis
perfect!" she cried. "If it is as neat within as
without, I shall love it dearly!"</p>

<p>"You'll make me jealous of the caravan," said
Eustace, rather uneasily. "But don't look inside,
Hagar."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said she, with a wondering look.</p>

<p>"Oh, because, because&mdash;" he began, in
confusion, and then stopped. Hagar looked at the door of the
caravan, and Eustace turned his eyes in the same direction. It
opened slowly, and a face&mdash;a brutal white face&mdash;looked
out. The man to whom this visage&mdash;it was covered with a hairy
growth of some days&mdash;belonged peered out at Eustace; then his
gaze wandered to Hagar. As the light fell on his sullen looks, she
gave a cry; the man on his side uttered an oath, and the next
moment, dashing open the door, he had leaped out, and brushing past
the pair, was racing down the street which led from Carby's
Crescent into the larger thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Eustace looked surprised at this sudden flight, and turned an
inquiring look on Hagar, who was pale as sculptured stone.</p>

<p>"Why are you so pale?" he said, taking her hand;
"and why did my friend run away at the sight of
you?"</p>

<p>"Your friend?" said Hagar, faintly.</p>

<p>"Yes; for the time being at all events. He is only a poor
tramp I found near Esher the other day. He was lying in a ditch
half-dead for want of food, so I took him into my caravan, and
looked after him till he got better. He asked me to take him up to
London; and I was about to tell you about him when he ran
away."</p>

<p>"Why did you not wish me to look into the
caravan?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Eustace, "this tramp seemed
rather nervous; I'm afraid a hard life has told on the poor
soul. A strange face always made him afraid, and I thought that if
you looked in suddenly, he might be alarmed. As it
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As it is, he was alarmed when he did see me," burst
out Hagar. "He well might be, as I know him!"</p>

<p>"You know him&mdash;that tramp?"</p>

<p>"Tramp! He is a convict&mdash;Bill Smith&mdash;the one I
wrote to you about."</p>

<p>"What! that blackguard who was engaged in the mandarin
swindle!" cried Eustace, taken aback&mdash;"who stole
those diamonds! I thought he was in prison!"</p>

<p>"So he was; but he escaped last week. The police are
looking for him."</p>

<p>"Who told you this, Hagar?"</p>

<p>"Goliath. He was in prison also, for horse-stealing; but
he has just been let out&mdash;a few days ago. Bill
Smith&mdash;Larky Bill as they call him&mdash;broke out, and he
wants to kill Vark, the lawyer."</p>

<p>"Then I have unconsciously helped him to escape
justice," said Lorn, in vexed tones. "I really thought
he was a tramp; had I known who he was I would not have helped him.
He is a brute!"</p>

<p>"He'll be a murderer soon!" cried Hagar,
feverishly. "For heaven's sake, Eustace, repair your
error by going to Scotland Yard and telling them that the man is in
London! You may be able to prevent a crime."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Eustace, getting on to the
driving seat of the caravan. "I'll see about this
tonight, and return to talk to you to-morrow. One
moment"&mdash;he leaped down again&mdash;"a kiss, my
dear."</p>

<p>"Eustace! there are people about!"</p>

<p>"Well, they didn't stop Bill Smith running away, so
they won't object to a kiss between an engaged couple.
Good-by, dearest, for the last time. To-morrow we meet to part no
more."</p>

<p>It was in considerable agitation that Hagar returned to her
pawn-shop. The coming of Goliath, the arrival of Eustace, the
unexpected escape of Bill Smith&mdash;all these events crowded so
rapidly into her life&mdash;in the space of an hour, as one might
say&mdash;that she felt unnerved and alarmed. She did not know what
the next day might bring forth, and was particularly careful in
locking up the house on this night, lest the escaped convict should
take it into his head to enter therein as a burglar. The next
twelve hours were anything but pleasant to Hagar.</p>

<p>With the daylight came more assurance; also Vark and Goliath.
The lean lawyer was much agitated at the news of the escape, and
feared&mdash;as he well might&mdash;that his miserable life was not
safe from so bitter an enemy as Larky Bill. However, his fear did
not prevent him from attending to business; and the whole of that
morning Hagar was busy explaining accounts and payments and
receipts to Vark and Goliath. The lawyer tried hard to find fault
with the administration of Hagar; to pick holes in her statements;
but, thanks to the rigid honesty of the girl, and the careful
manner in which she had conducted her business, Vark, to his great
disgust, was unable to harm her in any way. Everything was arranged
fairly, and Goliath expressed himself quite satisfied with the
statement of his property. Then he made a speech.</p>

<p>"It seems that I have thirty thousand quid," said
he, exultingly; "also a pop-shop, which I'll give the
kick to. With the rhino I can set up as a gent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you can never be!" retorted Hagar,
scornfully.</p>

<p>"Not unless you look arter me. See here, you jade, when I
was poor you said naught to me; now I am rich you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say the same, Goliath. When you were an honest man I
refused you; now you are a felon I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was a felon," corrected Goliath. "I'm
out of quod now."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't marry you. I hate you!" cried
Hagar, stamping her foot; "and indeed, if you must know,
I'm going to marry Eustace Lorn."</p>

<p>"What! that puppy!" cried Goliath, in a rage.</p>

<p>"That man&mdash;which you aren't! I'll live in
a caravan and sell books."</p>

<p>Here Goliath broke out into imprecations, and was hardly
restrained from violence, so enraged was he. He swore that for her
years of service he would not give Hagar a penny; she would leave
the pawn-shop as poor as when she entered it.</p>

<p>"I intend to," said Hagar, coolly. "I
shan't even take the mourning I wore for your father. My red
dress is good enough for the caravan of Eustace; and to-morrow
I'll put it on, and leave the pawn-shop forever."</p>

<p>This was all that Goliath could get out of her. He offered to
settle the money on her, to go in a caravan round the country if
she wished it; but all to no purpose. Hagar had surrendered her
stewardship in such wise that not even Vark, who hated her, could
find a flaw in the accounts. These things being settled, she
declared that she was going away with Eustace, after one more night
in the pawn-shop. First the altar and the marriage service; then
the caravan and the country; and from this program Hagar never
swerved.</p>

<p>That same evening Eustace came to see Hagar, and told her that
he had given notice at Scotland Yard of Smith's escape, and
that the police were now looking for him. While they were talking
over this, Vark, pale and scared-looking, made his appearance. He
told the engaged pair a piece of news which astonished them not a
little.</p>

<p>"I went to the police about Smith," said he, rubbing
his lean hands together, "and I found out that not only one
convict escaped, but two."</p>

<p>"Two!" cried Hagar; "and the
second?"</p>

<p>"Is Goliath&mdash;your friend Jimmy Dix. He got three
years, not two; and he broke prison with Larky Bill."</p>

<p>"What a fool to come here!" cried Eustace,
recovering from his surprise.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I think he was very wise," said
Hagar; "only I knew him as Goliath, and under that name he
was arrested and sentenced. As James Dix, the heir of Jacob, the
owner of thirty thousand pounds, no one would suspect him of being
an escaped convict. But how did he get rid of his prison
clothes?"</p>

<p>"The police told me," grinned Vark. "The two
broke into a house and stole suits to fit 'em. Bill Smith was
wounded by a steel trap, so hid in the ditch where Mr. Lorn found
him. Goliath came up here boldly to get his money. If I
hadn't heard his description at Scotland Yard I should never
have suspected him."</p>

<p>"Did you tell them he was here?" asked Lorn,
sharply.</p>

<p>"No; but I'll do so unless he gives me half his
money&mdash;fifteen thousand pounds. If he does, I'll smuggle
him over to America. If he doesn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," said Hagar, "if he doesn't, you
Judas?"</p>

<p>"I'll give him up to the police."</p>

<p>"You beast!" cried the girl, furiously, "you
low reptile! You make capital out of everything. Goliath has
conferred nothing on you but benefits; why, he warned you about
Smith, and so gave himself into your hands; yet you would betray
him!"</p>

<p>"I thought you hated the man!" quavered Vark,
astonished at this outburst.</p>

<p>"So I do; but I think you might let him enjoy his money in
peace. If he has been in jail, he hasn't deserved it half so
much as you."</p>

<p>"I want half his money," said the lawyer,
sullenly.</p>

<p>"What good will it do?" asked Lorn. "Bill
Smith may kill you."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of him!" snapped Vark, turning
pale nevertheless. "I have Bolker to stay with me at night,
and I've got my pistols. Besides, the police are after Bill,
so he won't come here."</p>

<p>"Yes, he will," said Hagar, throwing open the door;
"he'll gladly give his own neck to twist yours. Get out
of this place, Judas! You poison the air!"</p>

<p>Vark whimpered and protested, but Hagar drove him out and locked
the door on him. When in the street, he turned round and shook his
fist at the house wherein dwelt the woman he now hated as much as
he had loved. She had escaped his toils, she had run clear of the
traps he had laid for her; and now, having discharged her trust
towards the dead, she was going out into the wide world with the
man she loved; poor indeed as regards worldly wealth, but rich in
the possession of Lorn's honest heart. No wonder Vark was
wrathful.</p>

<p>The house in which Vark lived, was down by the river, and near
that ruinous wharf whither Bill Smith on a certain memorable
occasion had dragged Bolker. It was a gloomy old ramshackle
mansion, which had seen better days in the early part of the
century, but now it was given over to the lawyer, his deaf old
house-keeper, and the rats. On the present occasion Bolker was also
staying there, by desire of Vark. The wretched solicitor, who had
sold so many thieves, and who was now terribly afraid of one,
insisted that the lad should stay by him, in case of need. But
Nemesis was not to be tricked in that way.</p>

<p>Passing through the gloomy streets on his way to this den, Vark,
who had grown a trifle hard of hearing, did not hear the stealthy
footfalls of one who stole after him; nor did he see a shadow
gliding close at his heels. It was a windy night, and the moon was
veiled on occasions by a rack of flying clouds. The lawyer walked
slowly on, until he ascended the flight of worn steps which led to
his hall door. As he did so, a black cloud swept before the moon,
and lingered there so long that Vark could not find the keyhole.
When he did so, the door blew open with a crash, and Vark measured
his length on the stone pavement of the hall. Bill Smith saw his
opportunity of entering the house unnoticed, and flew swiftly up
the steps, and past the prostrate man, who was so confused by his
fall that he did not know of the man flitting by. At this moment
Bill could have killed Vark easily; but he judged that the hall,
with the open door, was too public; moreover, he wished to get into
the room where the lawyer kept his safe. Vark once dead, and Bill
intended to open the safe with his keys, and then escape well laden
with plunder. But of all these dark plans against his life and
moneys Vark was ignorant.</p>

<p>As he gathered himself up and closed the door, his housekeeper
came down the stairs with a candle. Grumbling at her for being
late, Vark made her precede him into a little room at the back,
looking on to the river. Larky Bill took off his boots, grasped the
knife he was carrying, and went after the old man and woman. When
he looked through a crack of the door into the room, he started
back and swore under his breath, for therein were Bolker and
Goliath. Bill began to think he would not be able to kill Vark
after all.</p>

<p>He hid in a dark corner as the housekeeper repassed him on the
way up the stairs, and then returned to his vantage point near the
door of the room, where he could both hear and see. What ensued
made him more resolved than ever to kill Vark. Such an ungrateful
bloodsucker, thought Bill, did not deserve to live.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you here," said Vark to Goliath,
who rose at his entry. "You got my note asking
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, or I shouldn't be cooling my heels in this
hole of yours?" growled Goliath, savagely. "What do you
want?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen thousand pounds," said Vark, tersely.</p>

<p>"Half the money left by the old 'un! And
why?"</p>

<p>"Because I know you bolted from jail," replied Vark,
coolly, "and that the police are looking for you."</p>

<p>"Do you intend to give me up?" asked Goliath,
grinding his teeth.</p>

<p>Vark rubbed his hands. "Why not?" he snarled.
"I gave up Bill Smith and got the reward; but I'd
rather have half your money than put you in jail again."</p>

<p>"I've a mind to kill you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not frightened," said Vark, with an
ugly look. "Bolker sits here, and Bolker has pistols. You
can't kill me."</p>

<p>"No; I'll leave Bill Smith to do that," said
Goliath, coolly.</p>

<p>"Bah! I'm not afraid of that ruffian!"</p>

<p>Before Goliath could reply there was a roar like an angry
beast's, the door was burst violently open, and Bill Smith,
knife in hand, hurled himself into the room. Vark yelled shrilly
like a rabbit caught in a trap, and the next moment was dashed to
the ground by the infuriated convict. Bolker ran out of the room
crying for the police, and flew through the passage, out of the
hall door, and into the windy night. His shrieks roused the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>In a flash Goliath saw a chance of gaining a pardon by saving
Vark from being murdered. He threw himself on Bill, who was
striking blindly with his knife at the struggling lawyer, and
strove to wrench him off.</p>

<p>"Let be, curse you!" shrieked the convict. "He
sold me; he said he'd sell you! If I swing for it, I'll
kill him!"</p>

<p>"No, d&mdash;n you, no!"</p>

<p>Goliath plucked the wretch off the prostrate man like a limpet
off a rock; and then commenced a furious struggle between the pair.
Vark, wounded and covered with blood, had fainted away. The next
moment, while Smith and Goliath were swaying together in a fierce
embrace, the room was filled with policemen, brought hither by the
shrieking Bolker. Seeing them enter, Bill, wrenching himself free
of Goliath, snatched up a revolver, that Bolker had left on the
table when he fled, and fired two shots at the prostrate body of
his enemy.</p>

<p>"Yah! Brute! Curse you! Die!"</p>

<p>Then he returned to the window which overlooked the river, and
keeping the police at bay with the pistol, he wrenched it open.
Goliath sprang forward to seize him, but Bill, with a howl of rage,
dashed the revolver in his face.</p>

<p>"Curse you for rounding on a pal!"</p>

<p>The next moment he had swung himself out of the window, and
those in the room heard the splash of his heavy body as it struck
the waters of the Thames.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>Two months after the foregoing event, a caravan, painted yellow
and drawn by a gray horse, was rolling along one of the green lanes
leading to Walton-on-Thames. It was the beginning of spring, and
the buds were already running along the leafless branches of the
trees, while the sharpness of the air was tempered by a balmy
breath foretelling the advent of the warm months of the year.
Beside the caravan strode a tall dark man arrayed in a rough suit
of homespun, and near him walked a woman with an imperial carriage
and lordly gait. She wore a dress of dark red, much stained and
worn; but her eye was full of fire, and her cheek healthy. The pair
were of humble condition, but looked contented and happy. As the
horse plodded onward in the bursts of sunlight, the two talked.</p>

<p>"So Vark died, after all, Hagar," said the man,
gravely.</p>

<p>"As you know," she replied, "the two pistol
shots killed him; and Bill Smith was drowned in the river as he
attempted to escape. He gave up his life to compass his
revenge."</p>

<p>"I am glad Goliath was pardoned."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that," said Hagar, indifferently,
"I am neither glad nor sorry. I think myself that he only
strove to save Vark in order to gain pardon."</p>

<p>"Well, he got what he wanted," said Eustace,
reflectively.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't if the public hadn't taken the
matter up," retorted Hagar: "but they made him out a
hero. Nonsense! As if Goliath was the man to forgive Vark, who
intended to sell him. Well, he is free now, and rich. I dare say
he'll lose all his money in dissipation. He had much better
have held on to the pawn-shop, instead of giving it up to
Bolker."</p>

<p>"Bolker is very young to have a business."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it," replied Hagar, drily.
"Bolker is young in years, but old in wickedness. He bought
the pawn-shop business with the reward he got from Lord Deacey for
recovering the diamonds. Bolker will grind down the poor of
Carby's Crescent, and develop into a second Jacob
Dix."</p>

<p>"You are glad to be away from the pawn-shop?"</p>

<p>"I should think so!" she replied, with a loving
glance at Eustace. "I am glad to leave dirty Lambeth for the
green fields of the country. I am a gipsy, and not used to the yoke
of commerce. Also, my dear, I am glad to be with you
always."</p>

<p>"Are you indeed, Mrs. Lorn?" said her husband,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Lorn," repeated Hagar, very sedately,
"I am Mrs. Lorn now, and Hagar of the Pawn-shop, with all her
adventures, is a phantom of the past."</p>

<p>Eustace kissed her, and then chirruped the horse onward. They
passed down the lane, across the dancing shadows, and went away
hopefully into the green country towards the gipsy life. Hagar of
the Pawn-shop had come to her own at last.</p>
