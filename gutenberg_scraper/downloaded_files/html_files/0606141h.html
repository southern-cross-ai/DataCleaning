<h1>The Thing In the Upper Room</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Arthur Morrison</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>A shadow hung ever over the door, which stood black in the depth
of its arched recess, like an unfathomable eye under a frowning brow.
The landing was wide and panelled, and a heavy rail, supported by a
carved balustrade, stretched away in alternate slopes and levels down
the dark staircase, past other doors, and so to the courtyard and the
street. The other doors were dark also; but it was with a difference.
That top landing was lightest of all, because of the skylight; and
perhaps it was largely by reason of contrast that its one doorway
gloomed so black and forbidding The doors below opened and shut,
slammed, stood ajar. Men and women passed in and out, with talk and
human sounds--sometimes even with laughter or a snatch of song; but
the door on the top landing remained shut and silent through weeks
and months. For, in truth, the logement had an ill name, and had been
untenanted for years. Long even before the last tenant had occupied
it, the room had been regarded with fear and aversion, and the end of
that last tenant had in no way lightened the gloom that hung about
the place.</p>

<p>The house was so old that its weather-washed face may well have
looked down on the bloodshed of St. Bartholomew's, and the haunted
room may even have earned its ill name on that same day of death. But
Paris is a city of cruel history, and since the old mansion rose
proud and new, the h&ocirc;tel of some powerful noble, almost any
year of the centuries might have seen the blot fall on that upper
room that had left it a place of loathing and shadows. The occasion
was long forgotten, but the fact remained; whether or not some horror
of the ancien r&eacute;gime or some enormity of the Terror was
enacted in that room was no longer to be discovered; but nobody would
live there, nor stay beyond that gloomy door one second longer than
he could help. It might be supposed that the fate of the solitary
tenant within living memory had something to do with the matter--and,
indeed, his end was sinister enough; but long before his time the
room had stood shunned and empty. He, greatly daring, had taken no
more heed of the common terror of the room than to use it to his
advantage in abating the rent; and he had shot himself a little
later, while the police were beating at his door to arrest him on a
charge of murder. As I have said, his fate may have added to the
general aversion from the place, though it had no in no way
originated it; and now ten years had passed, and more, since his few
articles of furniture had been carried away and sold; and nothing had
been carried in to replace them.</p>

<p>When one is twenty-five, healthy, hungry and poor, one is less
likely to be frightened from a cheap lodging by mere headshakings
than might be expected in other circumstances. Attwater was
twenty-five, commonly healthy, often hungry, and always poor. He came
to live in Paris because, from his remembrance of his student days,
he believed he could live cheaper there than in London; while it was
quite certain that he would not sell fewer pictures, since he had
never yet sold one.</p>

<p>It was the concierge of a neighbouring house who showed Attwater
the room. The house of the room itself maintained no such
functionary, though its main door stood open day and night. The man
said little, but his surprise at Attwater's application was plain to
see. Monsieur was English? Yes. The logement was convenient, though
high, and probably now a little dirty, since it had not been occupied
recently. Plainly, the man felt it to be no business of his to
enlighten an unsuspecting foreigner as to the reputation of the
place; and if he could let it there would be some small gratification
from the landlord, though, at such a rent, of course a very small one
indeed.</p>

<p>But Attwater was better informed than the concierge supposed. He
had heard the tale of the haunted room, vaguely and incoherently, it
is true, from the little old engraver of watches on the floor below,
by whom he had been directed to the concierge. The old man had been
voluble and friendly, and reported that the room had a good light,
facing north-east--indeed, a much better light than he, engraver of
watches, enjoyed on the floor below. So much so that, considering
this advantage and the much lower rent, he himself would have taken
the room long ago, except--well, except for other things. Monsieur
was a stranger, and perhaps had no fear to inhabit a haunted chamber;
but that was its reputation, as everybody in the quarter knew; it
would be a misfortune, however, to a stranger to take the room
without suspicion, and to undergo unexpected experiences. Here,
however, the old man checked himself, possibly reflecting that too
much information to inquirers after the upper room might offend his
landlord. He hinted as much, in fact, hoping that his friendly
warning would not be allowed to travel farther. As to the precise
nature of the disagreeable manifestations in the room, who could say?
Perhaps there were really none at all. People said this and that.
Certainly, the place had been untenanted for many years, and he would
not like to stay in it himself. But it might be the good fortune of
monsieur to break the spell, and if monsieur was resolved to defy the
revenant, he wished monsieur the highest success and happiness.</p>

<p>So much for the engraver of watches; and now the concierge of the
neighbouring house led the way up the stately old panelled staircase,
swinging his keys in his hand, and halted at last before the dark
door in the frowning recess. He turned the key with some difficulty,
pushed open the door, and stood back with an action of something not
wholly deference, to allow Attwater to enter first.</p>

<p>A sort of small lobby had been partitioned off at some time,
though except for this the logement was of one large room only. There
was something unpleasant in the air of the place--not a smell, when
one came to analyse one's sensations, though at first it might seem
so. Attwater walked across to the wide window and threw it open. The
chimneys and roofs of many houses of all ages straggled before him,
and out of the welter rose the twin towers of St. Sulpice, scarred
and grim.</p>

<p>Air the room as one might, it was unpleasant; a sickly, even a
cowed, feeling, invaded one through all the senses--or perhaps
through none of them. The feeling was there, though it was not easy
to say by what channel it penetrated. Attwater was resolved to admit
none but a common-sense explanation, and blamed the long closing of
door and window; and the concierge, standing uneasily near the door,
agreed that that must be it. For a moment Attwater wavered, despite
himself. But the rent was very low, and, low as it was, he could not
afford a sou more. The light was good, though it was not a top-light,
and the place was big enough for his simple requirements. Attwater
reflected that he should despise himself ever after if he shrank from
the opportunity; it would be one of those secret humiliations that
will rise again and again in a man's memory, and make him blush in
solitude. He told the concierge to leave door and window wide open
for the rest of the day, and he clinched the bargain.</p>

<p>It was with something of amused bravado that he reported to his
few friends in Paris his acquisition of a haunted room; for, once out
of the place, he readily convinced himself that his disgust and
dislike while in the room were the result of imagination and nothing
more. Certainly, there was no rational reason to account for the
unpleasantness; consequently, what could it be but a matter of fancy?
He resolved to face the matter from the beginning, and clear his mind
from any foolish prejudices that the hints of the old engraver might
have inspired, by forcing himself through whatever adventures he
might encounter. In fact, as he walked the streets about his
business, and arranged for the purchase and delivery of the few
simple articles of furniture that would be necessary, his enterprise
assumed the guise of a pleasing adventure. He remembered that he had
made an attempt, only a year or two ago, to spend a night in a house
reputed haunted in England, but had failed to find the landlord. Here
was the adventure to hand, with promise of a tale to tell in future
times; and a welcome idea struck him that he might look out the
ancient history of the room, and work the whole thing into a magazine
article, which would bring a little money.</p>

<p>So simple were his needs that by the afternoon of the day
following his first examination of the room it was ready for use.</p>

<p>He took his bag from the cheap hotel in a little street of
Montparnasse, where he had been lodging, and carried it to his new
home. The key was now in his pocket, and for the first time he
entered the place alone. The window remained wide open; but it was
still there--that depressing, choking something that entered the
consciousness he knew not by what gate. Again he accused his fancy.
He stamped and whistled, and set about unpacking a few canvases and a
case of old oriental weapons that were part of his professional
properties. But he could give no proper attention to the work, and
detected himself more than once yielding to a childish impulse to
look over his shoulder. He laughed at himself--with some effort--and
sat determinedly to smoke a pipe, and grow used to his surroundings.
But presently he found himself pushing his chair farther and farther
back, till it touched the wall. He would take the whole room into
view, he said to himself in excuse, and stare it out of countenance.
So he sat and smoked, and as he sat his eye fell on a Malay dagger
that lay on the table between him and the window. It was a murderous,
twisted thing, and its pommel was fashioned into the semblance of a
bird's head, with curved beak and an eye of some dull red stone. He
found himself gazing on this red eye with an odd, mindless
fascination. The dagger in its wicked curves seemed now a creature of
some outlandish fantasy--a snake with a beaked head, a thing of
nightmare, in some new way dominant, overruling the centre of his
perceptions. The rest of the room grew dim, but the red stone glowed
with a fuller light; nothing more was present to his consciousness.
Then, with a sudden clang, the heavy bell of St. Sulpice aroused him,
and he started up in some surprise.</p>

<p>There lay the dagger on the table, strange and murderous enough,
but merely as he had always known it. He observed with more surprise,
however, that his chair, which had been back against the wall, was
now some six feet forward, close by the table; clearly, he must have
drawn it forward in his abstraction, towards the dagger on which his
eyes had been fixed...The great bell of St. Sulpice went clanging on,
repeating its monotonous call to the Angelus.</p>

<p>He was cold, almost shivering. He flung the dagger into a drawer,
and turned to go out. He saw by his watch that it was later than he
had supposed; his fit of abstraction must have lasted some time.
Perhaps he had even been dozing.</p>

<p>He went slowly downstairs and out into the streets. As he went he
grew more and more ashamed of himself, for he had to confess that in
some inexplicable way he feared that room. He had seen nothing, heard
nothing of the kind that one might have expected, or had heard of in
any room reputed haunted; he could not help thinking that it would
have been some sort of relief if he had. But there was an
all-pervading, overpowering sense of another Presence--something
abhorrent, not human, something almost physically nauseous. Withal it
was something more than presence; it was power, domination--so he
seemed to remember it. And yet the remembrance grew weaker as he
walked in the gathering dusk; he thought of a story he had once read
of a haunted house wherein it was shown that the house actually was
haunted--by the spirit of fear, and nothing else. That, he persuaded
himself, was the case with his room; he felt angry at the growing
conviction that he had allowed himself to be overborne by fancy--by
the spirit of fear.</p>

<p>He returned that night with the resolve to allow himself no
foolish indulgence. He had heard nothing and had seen nothing; when
something palpable to the senses occurred, it would be time enough to
deal with it. He took off his clothes and got into bed deliberately,
leaving candle and matches at hand in case of need. He had expected
to find some difficulty in sleeping, or at least some delay, but he
was scarce well in bed ere he fell into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>Dazzling sunlight through the window woke him in the morning, and
he sat up, staring sleepily about him. He must have slept like a log.
But he had been dreaming; the dreams were horrible. His head ached
beyond anything he had experienced before, and he was far more tired
than when he went to bed. He sank back on the pillow, but the mere
contact made his head ring with pain. He got out of bed, and found
himself staggering; it was all as though he had been
drunk--unspeakably drunk with bad liquor. His dreams--they had been
horrid dreams; he could remember that they had been bad, but what
they actually were was now gone from him entirely. He rubbed his eyes
and stared amazedly down at the table: where the crooked dagger lay,
with its bird's head and red stone eye. It lay just as it had lain
when he sat gazing at it yesterday, and yet he would have sworn that
he had flung that same dagger into a drawer. Perhaps he had dreamed
it; at any rate, he put the thing carefully into the drawer now, and,
still with his ringing headache, dressed himself and went out.</p>

<p>As he reached the next landing the old engraver greeted him from
his door with an inquiring good-day. "Monsieur has not slept well, I
fear?"</p>

<p>In some doubt, Attwater protested that he had slept quite soundly.
"And as yet I have neither seen nor heard anything of the ghost," he
added.</p>

<p>"Nothing?" replied the old man, with a lift of the eyebrows,
"nothing at all? It is fortunate. It seemed to me, here below, that
monsieur was moving about very restlessly in the night; but no doubt
I was mistaken. No doubt, also, I may felicitate monsieur on breaking
the evil tradition. We shall hear no more of it; monsieur has the
good fortune of a brave heart."</p>

<p>He smiled and bowed pleasantly, but it was with something of a
puzzled look that his eyes followed Attwater descending the
staircase.</p>

<p>Attwater took his coffee and roll after an hour's walk, and fell
asleep in his seat. Not for long, however, and presently he rose and
left the caf&Ccedil;. He felt better, though still unaccountably
fatigued. He caught sight of his face in a mirror beside a shop
window, and saw an improvement since he had looked in his own glass.
That indeed had brought him a shock. Worn and drawn beyond what might
have been expected of so bad a night, there was even something more.
What was it? How should it remind him of that old legend--was it
Japanese?--which he had tried to recollect when he had wondered
confusedly at the haggard apparition that confronted him? Some tale
of a demon-possessed person who in any mirror, saw never his own
face, but the face of the demon.</p>

<p>Work he felt to be impossible, and he spent the day on garden
seats, at caf&eacute; tables, and for a while in the Luxembourg. And
in the evening he met an English friend, who took him by the
shoulders and looked into his eyes, shook him, and declared that he
had been overworking, and needed, above all things, a good dinner,
which he should have instantly. "You'll dine with me," he said, "at
La Perouse, and we'll get a cab to take us there. I'm hungry."</p>

<p>As they stood and looked for a passing cab a man ran shouting with
newspapers. "We'll have a cab," Attwater's friend repeated, "and
we'll take the new murder with us for conversation's sake. Hi!
Journal!"</p>

<p>He bought a paper, and followed Attwater into the cab. "I've a
strong idea I knew the poor old boy by sight," he said. "I believe
he'd seen better days."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The old man who was murdered in the Rue Broca last night. The
description fits exactly. He used to hang about the caf&eacute;s and
run messages. It isn't easy to read in this cab; but there's probably
nothing fresh in this edition. They haven't caught the murderer,
anyhow."</p>

<p>Attwater took the paper, and struggled to read it in the changing
light. A poor old man had been found dead on the footpath of the Rue
Broca, torn with a score of stabs. He had been identified--an old man
not known to have a friend in the world; also, because he was so old
and so poor, probably not an enemy. There was no robbery; the few
sous the old man possessed remained in his pocket. He must have been
attacked on his way home in the early hours of the morning, possibly
by a homicidal maniac, and stabbed again and again with inconceivable
fury. No arrest had been made.</p>

<p>Attwater pushed the paper way: "Pah!" he said; "I don't like it.
I'm a bit off colour, and I was dreaming horribly all last night;
though why this should remind me of it I can't guess. But it's no
cure for the blues, this!"</p>

<p>"No," replied his friend heartily; "we'll get that upstairs, for
here we are, on the quay. A bottle of the best Burgundy on the list
and the best dinner they can do--that's your physic. Come!"</p>

<p>It was a good prescription, indeed. Attwater's friend was cheerful
and assiduous, and nothing could have bettered the dinner. Attwater
found himself reflecting that indulgence in the blues was a poor
pastime, with no better excuse than a bad night's rest. And last
night's dinner in comparison with this! Well, it was enough to have
spoiled his sleep, that one-franc-fifty dinner.</p>

<p>Attwater left La Perouse as gay as his friend. They had sat late,
and now there was nothing to do but cross the water and walk a little
in the boulevards. This they did, and finished the evening at a
caf&eacute; table with half a dozen acquaintances.</p>

<p>Attwater walked home with a light step, feeling less drowsy than
at any time during the day. He was well enough. He felt he should
soon get used to the room. He had been a little too much alone
lately, and that had got on his nerves. It was simply stupid.</p>

<p>Again he slept quickly and heavily and dreamed. But he had an
awakening of another sort. No bright sun blazed in at the open window
to lift his heavy lids, and no morning bell from St. Sulpice opened
his ears to the cheerful noise of the city. He awoke gasping and
staring in the dark, rolling face-downward on the floor, catching his
breath in agonized sobs; while through the window from the streets
came a clamour of hoarse cries: cries of pursuit and the noise of
running men: a shouting and clatter wherein here and there a voice
was clear among the rest--"A l'assassin! Arr&ecirc;tez!"</p>

<p>He dragged himself to his feet in the dark, gasping still. What
was this--all this? Again a dream? His legs trembled under him, and
he sweated with fear. He made for the window, panting and feeble; and
then, as he supported himself by the sill, he realized wonderingly
that he was fully dressed--that he wore even his hat. The running
crowd straggled through the outer street and away, the shouts growing
fainter. What had wakened him? Why had he dressed? He remembered his
matches, and turned to grope for them; but something was already in
his hand--something wet, sticky. He dropped it on the table, and even
as he struck the light, before he saw it, he knew. The match
sputtered and flared, and there on the table lay the crooked dagger,
smeared and dripping and horrible.</p>

<p>Blood was on his hands--the match stuck in his fingers. Caught at
the heart by the first grip of an awful surmise, he looked up and saw
in the mirror before him, in the last flare of the match, the face of
the Thing in the Room.</p>

<h3>THE END</h3>
