<h1>The Demon of the Hartz</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Thomas Peckett Prest</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>THE solitudes of the Hartz forest in Germany, but especially the
mountains called Blockberg, or rather Blockenberg, are the chosen scene
for tales of witches, demons, and apparitions. The occupation of the
inhabitants, who are either miners or foresters, is of a kind that
renders them peculiarly prone to superstition, and the natural
phenomena which they witness in pursuit of their solitary or
subterraneous profession, are often set down by them to the
interference of goblins or the power of magic. Among the various
legends current in that wild country, there is a favourite one which
supposes the Hartz to be haunted by a sort of tutelar demon, in the
shape of a wild man, of huge stature, his head wreathed with oak
leaves, and his middle tinctured with the same, bearing in his hand a
pine torn up by the root. It is certain that many persons profess to
have seen such a man traversing, with huge strides, the opposite ridge
of a mountain, when divided from it by a narrow glen; and indeed the
fact of the apparition is so generally admitted, that modern scepticism
has only found refuge by ascribing it to optical deception.</p>

<p>In elder times, the intercourse of the demon with the inhabitants
was more familiar, and, according to the traditions of the Hartz, he
was wont, with the caprice usually ascribed to these earth--born powers
to interfere with the affairs of mortals, sometimes for their welfare.
But it was observed, that even his gifts often turned out, in the long
run, fatal to those on whom they were bestowed, and it was no uncommon
thing for the pastors, in their care for their flock, to compose long
sermons the burthen whereof was a warning against having any
intercourse, direct or indirect, with the Hartz demon. The fortunes of
Martin Waldeck have been often quoted by the aged to their giddy
children, when they were heard to scoff at a danger which appeared
visionary.</p>

<p>A travelling capuchin had possessed himself of the pulpit of the
thatched church at a little hamlet called Morgenbrodt, lying in the
Hartz district, from which he declaimed against the wickedness of the
inhabitants, their communication with fiends, witches, and fairies, and
particularly with the woodland goblin of the Hartz. The doctrines of
Luther had already begun to spread among the peasantry, for the
incident is placed under the reign of Charles V, and they laughed to
scorn the zeal with which the venerable man insisted upon his topic. At
length, as his vehemence increased with opposition, so their opposition
rose in proportion to his vehemence. The inhabitants did not like to
hear an accustomed demon, who had inhabited the Brockenberg for so many
ages, summarily confounded with Baal--peor, Ashtaroth, and Beelzebub
himself, and condemned without reprieve to the bottomless Tophet. The
apprehensions that the spirit might avenge himself on them for
listening to such an illiberal sentence, added to the national interest
in his behalf. A travelling friar, they said, that is here today and
away tomorrow, may say what he pleases, but it is we the ancient and
constant inhabitants of the country, that are left at the mercy of the
insulted demon, and must, of course, pay for all. Under the irritation
occasioned by these reflections the peasants from injurious language
betook themselves to stones, and having pebbled the priest most
handsomely, they drove him out of the parish to preach against demons
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Three young men, who had been present and assisting in the attack
upon the priest, carried on the laborious and mean occupation of
preparing charcoal for the smelting furnaces. On their return to their
hut, their conversation naturally turned upon the demon of the Hartz
and the doctrine of the capuchin. Maximilian and George Waldeck, the
two elder brothers, although they allowed the language of the capuchin
to have been indiscreet and worthy of censure, as presuming to
determine upon the precise character and abode of the spirit, yet
contended it was dangerous, in the highest degree, to accept his gifts,
or hold any communication with him. He was powerful they allowed, but
wayward and capricious, and those who had intercourse with him seldom
came, to a good end. Did he not give the brave knight, Echert of
Rabenwald, that famous black steed, by means of which he vanquished all
the champions at the great tournament at Bremen? and did not the same
steed afterwards precipitate itself wit its rider into an abyss so deep
and fearful, that neither horse nor man was ever seen more? Had he not
given to Dame Gertrude Trodden a curious spell for making butter come?
and was she not burnt for a witch by the grand criminal judge of the
Electorate, because she availed herself of his gift? But these, and
many other instances which they quoted, of mischance and ill--luck
ultimately attending upon the apparent benefits conferred by the Hartz
spirit, failed to make any impression on Martin Waldeck, the youngest
of the brothers.</p>

<p>Martin was youthful, rash, and impetuous; excelling in all the
exercises which distinguish a mountaineer, and brave and undaunted from
the familiar intercourse with the dangers that attend them. He laughed
at the timidity of his brothers. 'Tell me not of such folly,' he said;
'the demon is a good demon--he lives among us as if he were a peasant
like ourselves--haunts the lonely crags or recesses of the mountains
like a huntsman or goatherd--and he who loves the Hartz--forest and its
wild scenes cannot be indifferent to the fate of the hardy children of
the soil. But if the demon were as malicious as you make him, how
should he derive power over mortals who barely avail themselves of his
gifts, without binding themselves to submit to his pleasure? 'When you
carry your charcoal to the furnace, is not the money as good that is
paid you by blaspheming Blaize, the old reprobate overseer, as if you
got it from the pastor himself? It is not the goblin's gifts which can
endanger you then, but it is the use you shall make of them that you
must account for. And were the demon to appear at this moment, and
indicate to me a gold or silver mine, I would begin to dig away before
his back were turned, and I would consider myself as under protection
of a much Greater than he, while I made a good use of the wealth he
pointed out tome.</p>

<p>To this the elder brother replied, that wealth ill won was seldom
well spent, while Martin presumptuously declared, that the possession
of all the Hartz would not make the slightest alteration on his habits,
morals, or character.</p>

<p>His brother entreated Martin to talk less wildly upon this subject,
and with some difficulty contrived to withdraw his attention, by
calling it to the consideration of an approaching boar chase, This talk
brought them to their hut, a wretched wigwam, situated upon one side of
a wild, narrow, and romantic dell in the recesses of the Brockenberg.
They released their sister from attending upon the operation of
charring the wood, which requires constant attention, and divided among
themselves the duty of watching it by night, according to their custom,
one always waking while his brothers slept.</p>

<p>Max Waldeck, the eldest, watched during the two first hours of
night, and was considerably alarmed, by observing upon the opposite
bank of the glen, or valley a huge fire surrounded by some figures that
appeared to wheel around it with antic gestures. Max at first bethought
him of calling up his brothers; but recollecting the daring character
of the youngest, and finding it impossible to wake the elder without
also disturbing him--conceiving also what he saw to be an illusion of
the demon, sent perhaps in consequence of the venturous expressions
used by Martin on the preceding evening, he thought it best to betake
himself to the safe--guard of such prayers as he could murmur over, and
to watch in great terror and annoyance this strange and alarming
apparition. After blazing for some time, the fire faded gradually away
into darkness, and the rest of Max's watch was only disturbed by the
remembrance of its terrors.</p>

<p>George now occupied the place of Max, who had retired to rest. The
phenomenon of a huge blazing fire, upon the opposite bank of the glen,
again presented itself to the eye of the watchman. It was surrounded as
before by figures, which, distinguished by their opaque forms, being
between the spectator and the red glaring light, moved and fluctuated
around it as if engaged in some mystical ceremonies. George, though
equally cautions, was of a bolder character than his elder brother. He
resolved to examine more nearly the object of his wonder; and
accordingly, after crossing the rivulet which divided the glen, he
climbed up the opposite bank, and approached within an arrow's flight
from the fire, which blazed apparently with the same fury as when he
first witnessed it.</p>

<p>The appearance of the assistants who surrounded it, resembled those
phantoms which are seen in a troubled dream, and at once confirmed the
idea he had entertained from the first, that they did not belong to the
human world. Amongst the strange unearthly forms, George Waldeck
distinguished that of a giant overgrown with hair, holding an uprooted
fir in his hand, with which, from time to time, he seemed to stir the
blazing fire and having no other clothing than a wreath of oak leaves
round his forehead and loins. George's heart sunk within him at
recognizing the well--known apparition of the Hartz demon, as he had
often been described to him by the ancient shepherds and huntsmen who
had seen his form traversing the mountains. He turned, and was about to
fly; but, upon second thoughts, blaming his own cowardice, he recited
mentally the verse of the Psalmist, 'All good angels praise the Lord I'
which is in that country supposed powerful as an exorcism and turned
himself once more towards the place where he had seen the fire. But it
was no longer visible.</p>

<p>The pale moon alone enlightened the side of the valley, and when
George, with trembling steps, a moist brow, and hair bristling upright
under his collier's cap, came to the spot where the fire had been so
lately visible, marked as it was by a scathed oak tree, there appeared
not on the heath the slightest vestiges of what he had seen. The moss
and wild flowers were unscorched, and the branches of the oak tree,
which had so lately appeared enveloped in wreaths of flame and smoke,
were moist with the dews of midnight.</p>

<p>George returned to his hut with trembling steps, and, arguing like
his elder brother, resolved to say nothing of what he had seen, lest he
should awake in Martin that daring curiosity which he almost deemed to
be allied with impiety.</p>

<p>It was now Martin's turn to watch. The household cock had given his
first summons, and the night was well nigh spent. On examining the
state of the furnace in which the wood was deposited in order to its
being coked, or charred, he was surprised to find that the fire had nor
been sufficiently maintained; for in his excursion and its
consequences, George had forgot the principal object of his watch.
Martin's first thought was to call up the slumberers, but observing
that both his brothers slept unwontedly deep and heavily, he respected
their repose, and set himself to supply their furnace with fuel,
without requiring their aid. What he heaped upon it was apparently damp
and unfit for the purpose, for the fire seemed rather to decay than
revive. Martin next went to collect some boughs from a stack which had
been carefully cut and dried for this purpose; but, when he returned,
he found the fire totally extinguished. This was a serious evil, which
threatened them with loss of their trade for more than one day. The
vexed and mortified watchman set about to strike a light in order to
rekindle the fire, but the tinder was moist, and his labour proved in
this respect also ineffectual. He was now about to call up his
brothers, for the circumstance seemed to be pressing, when flashes of
light glimmered not only through the window, but through every crevice
of the rudely built hut, and summoned him to behold the same apparition
which had before alarmed the successive watches of his brethren. His
first idea was, that the Muhllerhaussers, their rivals in trade, and
with whom they had had many quarrels, might have encroached upon their
bounds for the purpose of pirating their wood, and he resolved to awake
his brothers, and be revenged on them for their audacity. But a short
reflection and observation on the gestures and manner of those who
seemed 'to work in the fire', induced him to dismiss this belief, and
although rather sceptical in these matters, to conclude that what he
saw was a supernatural phenomenon. 'But be they men or fiends,' said
the undaunted forester, 'that busy themselves with such fantastical
rites and gestures, I will go and demand a light to rekindle our
furnace.' He relinquished, at the same time, the idea of waking his
brethren. There was a belief that such adventures as he was about to
undertake were accessible only to one person at a time; he feared also
that his brothers in their scrupulous timidity, might interfere to
prevent the investigation he had resolved to commence; and therefore,
snatching his boar--spear from the wall, the undaunted Martin Waldeck
set forth on the adventure alone.</p>

<p>With the same success as his brother George, but with courage far
superior, Martin crossed the brook, ascended the hill, and approached
so near the ghostly assembly that he could recognize, in the presiding
figure, the attributes of the Hartz demon. A cold shuddering assailed
him for the first time in his life, but the recollection that he had at
a distance dared and even courted the intercourse which was now about
to take place, confirmed his staggering courage, and pride supplying
what he wanted in resolution, he advanced with tolerable firmness
towards the fire; the figures which surrounded it appeared more
phantastical, and supernatural, the nearer he approached to the
assembly. He was received with a loud shout of discord and unnatural
laughter, which, to his stunned ears, seemed more alarming than a
combination of the most dismal and melancholy sounds which could be
imagined.----'Who art thou?' said the giant compressing his savage and
exaggerated features into a sort of forced gravity, while they were
occasionally agitated by the convulsion of the laughter which he seemed
to suppress.</p>

<p>'Martin Waldeck, the forester,' answered the hardy youth;----'And
who are you?'</p>

<p>The king of the wastes and of the mine,' answered the
spectre;----'And why hast thou dared to encroach on my mysteries?'</p>

<p>'I came in search of light to rekindle my fire,' answered Martin
hardily, and then resolutely asked in his turn, 'What mysteries are
these that you celebrate here?'</p>

<p>'We celebrate,' answered the demoniac being, 'the wedding of Hermes
with the Black Dragon.--But take thy fire that thou camest to seek, and
begone--No mortal may long look upon us and live.'</p>

<p>The peasant stuck his spear point into a large piece of blazing
wood, which he heaved with some difficulty, and then turned round to
regain his hut, the shouts of laughter being renewed behind him with
treble violence, and ringing far down the narrow valley. When Martin
returned to the hut, his first care, however much astonished with what
he had seen, was to dispose the kindled coal among the fuel so as might
best light the fire of his furnace, but after many efforts, and all
exertions of bellows and fire prong, the coal he had brought from the
demon's fire became totally extinct, without kindling any of the
others. He turned about and observed the fire still blazing on the
hill, although those who had been busied around it had disappeared. As
he conceived the spectre had been jesting with him, he gave way to the
natural hardihood of his temper, and determining to see the adventure
to the end, resumed the road to the fire, from which, unopposed by the
demon, he brought off in the same manner a blazing piece of charcoal
but still without being able to succeed in lighting his fire. Impunity
having increased his rashness, he resolved upon a third experiment, and
was as successful as before in reaching the fire; but, when he had
again appropriated a piece of burning coal, and had turned to depart,
he heard the harsh and supernatural voice which had before accosted
him, pronounce these word; 'Dare not to return hither a fourth
time!'</p>

<p>The attempt to rekindle the fire with this last coal having proved
as ineffectual as on the former occasions, Martin relinquished the
hopeless attempt, and flung himself on his bed of leaves, resolving to
delay till the next morning the communication of his supernatural
adventure to his brothers. He was awakened from a heavy sleep into
which he had sunk, from fatigue of body and agitation of mind, by loud
exclamations of joy and surprise. His brothers, astonished at finding
the Are extinguished when they awoke, had proceeded to arrange the fuel
in order to renew it, when they found in the ashes three huge metallic
masses, which their skill, (for most of the peasants in the Hartz are
practised mineralogists,) immediately ascertained to be pure gold.</p>

<p>It was some damp upon their joyful congratulations when they learned
from Martin the mode in which he had obtained this treasure, to which
their own experience of the nocturnal vision induced them to give full
credit. But they were unable to resist the temptation of sharing their
brother's wealth. Taking now upon him as head of the house, Martin
Waldeck bought lands and forests, built a castle, obtained a patent of
nobility, and greatly to the scorn of the ancient nobility of the
neighbourhood, was invested with all the privileges of a man of family.
His courage in public war, as well as in private feuds, together with
the number of retainers whom he kept in pay, sustained him for some
time against the odium which was excited by his sudden elevation, and
the arrogance of his pretensions. Now it was seen in the instance of
Martin Waldeck, as it has been in that of many others, how little
mortals can foresee the effect of sudden prosperity on their own
disposition. The evil dispositions in his nature, which poverty had
checked and repressed, ripened and bore their unhallowed fruit under
the influence of temptation and the means of indulgence. As Deep calls
unto Deep, one bad passion awakened another:--the fiend of avarice
invoked that of pride, and pride was to be supported by cruelty and
oppression. Waldeck's character, always bold and daring, but rendered
more harsh and assuming by prosperity, soon made him odious, not to
nobles only, but likewise to the lower ranks, who saw, with double
dislike, the oppressive rights of the feudal nobility of the empire so
remorselessly exercised by one who had risen from the very dregs of the
people. His adventure, although carefully concealed, began likewise to
be whispered, and the clergy already stigmatized as a wizard and
accomplice of fiends, the wretch, who, having acquired so huge a
treasure in so strange a manner had not sought to sanctify it by
dedicating a considerable portion to the use of the church. Surrounded
by enemies, public arid private, tormented by a thousand feuds, and
threatened by the church with excommunication, Martin Waldeck, or, as
we must now call him the Baron Von Waldeck, often regretted bitterly
the labours and sports of unenvied poverty. But his courage failed him
not under all these difficulties and seemed rather to augment in
proportion to the danger which darkened around him, until an accident
precipitated his fall.</p>

<p>A proclamation by the reigning Duke of Brunswick had invited to a
solemn tournament all German nobles of free and honourable descent, and
Martin Waldeck, splendidly armed, accompanied by his two brothers, and
a gallantly equipped retinue, had the arrogance to appear among the
chivalry of the province and demand permission to enter the lists. This
was considered as filling up the measure of his presumption. A thousand
voices exclaimed, 'we will have no cinder--sifter mingle in our games
of chivalry.' Irritated to frenzy, Martin drew his sword, and hewed
down the herald who, in compliance with the general outcry, opposed his
entrance into the list. A hundred swords were unsheathed to avenge what
was, in those days, regarded as a crime only inferior to sacrilege, or
regicide. Waldeck, after defending himself with the fury of a lion, was
seized, tried on the spot by the judges of the lists, and condemned, as
the appropriate punishment for breaking the peace of his sovereign and
violating the sacred person of a herald--at--arms, to have his right
hand struck from his body, to be ignominiously deprived of the honour
of nobility, of which he was unworthy, and be expelled from the city.
When he had been stripped of his arms, and sustained the mutilation
imposed by this severe sentence, the unhappy victim of ambition was
abandoned to the rabble, who followed him with threats and outcries,
levelled alternately against the necromancer and oppressor, which at
length ended in violence. His brothers, (for his retinue had fled and
dispersed) at length succeeded in rescuing him from the hands of the
populace, when, satiated with cruelty, they had left him half dead
through loss of blood, through the outrages he had sustained. They were
not permitted, such was the ingenious cruelty of their enemies, to make
use of any other means of removing him, excepting such a collier's cart
as they had themselves formerly used, in which they deposited their
brother on a truss of straw, scarcely expecting to reach any place of
shelter ere death should release him from his misery.</p>

<p>When the Waldecks, journeying in this miserable manner, had
approached the verge of their native country, in a hollow way, between
two mountains, they perceived a figure advancing towards them, which at
first sight seemed to be an aged man. But as he approached, his limbs
and stature increased, the cloak fell from his shoulders, his pilgrim's
staff was changed into an uprooted pine tree, and the gigantic figure
of the Hartz demon passed before them in his terrors. When he came
opposite to the cart which contained the miserable Waldeck, his huge
features dilated into a grin of unutterable contempt and malignity, as
he asked the sufferer, 'How like you the fire MY coals have kindled!'
The power of motion, which terror suspended in his two brothers, seemed
to be restored to Martin by the energy of his courage. He raised
himself on the cart, bent his brows, and, clenching his fist, shook it
at the spectre with a ghastly look of hate and defiance. The goblin
vanished with his usual tremendous and explosive laugh and left Waldeck
exhausted with the effort of expiring nature.</p>

<p>The terrified brethren turned their vehicle towards the towers of a
convent which arose in a wood of pine trees beside the road. They were
charitably received by a bare--footed and long--bearded capuchin, and
Martin survived only to complete the first confession he had made since
the day of his sudden prosperity, and to receive absolution from the
very priest, whom, precisely that day three years, he had assisted to
pelt out of the hamlet of Morgenbrodt. The three years of precarious
prosperity were supposed to have a mysterious correspondence with the
number of his visits to the spectral fire upon the hill.</p>

<p>The body of Martin Waldeck was interred in the convent where he
expired, in which his brothers, having assumed the habit of the order,
lived and died in the performance of acts of charity and devotion. His
lands, to which no one asserted any claim, lay waste until they were
reassumed by the emperor as a lapsed fief, and the ruins of the castle,
which Waldeck had called by his own name, are still shunned by the
miner and forester as haunted by evil spirits. Thus were the evils
attendant upon wealth, hastily attained and ill--employed, exemplified
in the fortunes of Martin Waldeck.</p>
