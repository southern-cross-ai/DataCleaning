<h1>The Unholy Compact Abjured</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Charles Pigault-Lebrun</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>In the churchyard of the town of Salins, department of Jura, may
still be seen the remains of a tomb, on which is sculptured in figures
as rude as the age in which they were carved, a representation of a
soldier, firmly clasped in the arms of a maiden; near them stands the
devil in a menacing attitude. Though the inhabitants of the town are
all ready to swear to the truth of the story, they are not agreed as to
the time when it happened; so that we can only say, that some centuries
have rolled away, since a young soldier named St Amand, a native of
Salins, was returning after a long absence to the bosom of his family.
He walked with quick and cheerful steps, carrying with ease, in a small
knapsack, the whole of his worldly goods. Never since he quitted the
paternal roof, had he felt so happy; for he hoped ere night, to see his
pretty cousin, Ninette, whom he loved with all his heart, and whom he
intended to make his wife.</p>

<p>He walked on, gaily carolling, till he saw a cross-road before him,
and uncertain of his way, he called to an old woman, with her back
towards him, to direct him. She was silent: and, as he ap-proached, he
repeated the call, and she raised her head to answer it. The stout
heart of the young soldier quailed, as he cast his eyes upon a
countenance, such as never before had met his gaze.</p>

<p>He had indeed, reason to tremble; for he had just disturbed in the
middle of an incantation, one of the most powerful witches in the
country. She regarded him with a demoniac smile, and said in a tone
which froze his blood, "Turn where thou wilt, thy road is sure,--it
leads to death!"</p>

<p>For some moments, he stood as if rooted to the spot; but, soon, fear
of the sorceress, who remained gazing upon him, gave him strength to
flee. He ran forward, nor stopped till he had completely lost sight of
the fearful being, whose dreadful prediction had struck him with such
horror. Suddenly a frightful storm arose; the thunder growled, and the
lightning flashed round the weary traveller, who, drenched with rain,
and overcome with fatigue, had hardly strength to proceed. How great
was his joy, when he saw at a distance, a magnificent chateau, the gate
of which stood open. He exerted all his remaining strength to reach it,
and precipitately entered a large hall. There he stopped, expecting
every moment to see some domestics, but no one appeared. He remained
some time, watching the progress of the storm: at length it began to
abate, and he determined to pursue his way; but as he approached the
door, it closed with a loud noise, and all his efforts to open it were
vain.</p>

<p>Struck with astonishment and dismay, the young soldier now believed
that the prediction of the witch was about to be accomplished, and that
he was doomed to fall a sacrifice to magic art.</p>

<p>Exhausted by his vain efforts to open the ponderous door, he sank
for a moment in helpless despondency, on the marble pavement; put his
trust in providence, and soon revived. He said his prayers, and rising,
waited with firmness the issue of this extraordinary adventure. When he
became composed enough to look round him, he examined the hall in which
he was: a pair of folding doors at the further end, flattered him with
the hope of escape that way; but they too, were fastened. The hall was
of immense size, entirely unfurnished; the walls, pavement and ceiling,
were of black marble; there were no windows, but a small sky-light
faintly admitted the light of day, into this abode of gloom, where
reigned a silence like that of the tomb. Hour after hour passed; this
mournful silence remained still undisturbed; and St Amand, overcome
with fatigue and watching, at length sunk into a deep, though perturbed
slumber.</p>

<p>His sleep was soon disturbed by a frightful dream: he heard all at
once, the sound of a knell,.mingled with the cries of bats, and owls,
and a hollow voice, murmured in his ear, "Woe to those who trouble the
repose of the dead!" He started on his feet, but what a sight met his
eyes! The hall was partially illuminated by flashes of sulphurious
fire; on the pavement was laid the body of a man newly slain, and
covered with innumerable wounds, from which, a band of unearthly forms,
whose fearful occupation, proclaimed the hellish origin, were draining
the yet warm blood.</p>

<p>St Amand uttered a shriek of terror, and was in an instant
surrounded by the fiends: already were their fangs, from which the
remains of their horrid feast still dripped, extended to grasp him,
when he hastily made the sign of the cross, and sank senseless upon the
ground. When he regained his senses, the infernal band had vanished,
and he saw bending over him, an old man, magnificently but strangely
dressed: his silken garments flowed loosely around him, and were
embroidered with figures of different animals, and mystic devices. His
countenance was majestic, and his venerable white beard descended below
his girdle: but his features had a wild and gloomy expression: his
eyes, above all, had in their glance, that which might appal the
stoutest heart. St Amand shrunk from this mysterious being, with awe,
mingled with abhorrence, and a cold shudder ran through his veins, as
the old man bent upon him his piercing eyes.</p>

<p>"Rash youth," cried he in a severe tone, "how is it that thou hast
dared to enter this place, where never mortal foot save mine has
trod?"</p>

<p>"I came not willingly," replied St Amand, trembling; "an evil
destiny, and not vain curiosity brought me hither."</p>

<p>"Thou wouldst not the less have expiated thy presumption with thy
life, but for my aid. "</p>

<p>returned the old man, austerely. "I have saved thee from the
vampires who guard it, and it depends upon me, whether thou shalt not
still become their prey."</p>

<p>"Oh! save me, then, I pray thee!"</p>

<p>"And why should I save thee?" demanded the venerable magician. "What
price art thou willing to give me for thy life?"</p>

<p>"Alas! I have nothing worthy of thy acceptance," sighed St
Amand.</p>

<p>"But thou may'st have; and it is only through thee that I can obtain
what I most desire."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"The blood of a dove, for me, would be a treasure, but I may not
kill one; she must be slain for me, by one whose life I have saved.
Should I liberate thee, a dove will fly to thy bosom; swear that thou
wilt instantly sacrifice her for me, and thou shalt be free."</p>

<p>"I swear it!"</p>

<p>Hardly had St Amand uttered the words, when he found himself in the
chamber of Ninette, who, with a cry of joy, rushed into his arms. He
pressed her with transport to his breast; but scarcely had he embraced
her, when he saw the magician standing by his side.</p>

<p>"Wretch!" cried he, "is it thus thou keepest thine oath? Pierce her
heart--she is the dove that thou must instantly sacrifice, if thou wilt
not become a feast for the vampires!"</p>

<p>"Sacrifice her? Never! Never!"</p>

<p>"Then, thou art my prey!" and the fiend assuming his own form,
sprang towards his victim; but he stopped suddenly--he dared not seize
him: for the maiden held him firmly clasped in her arms, and the little
cross of gold, which night and day she wore upon her bosom, had been
blest by the venerable priest, whose gift it was. Thus, nought unholy
dared approach the maiden, and the baffled fiend fled with a tremendous
yell, as the crowing of the cock, announced the approach of dawn.</p>

<p>The cries of the maiden soon brought the neighbours to her chamber,
and among them was the pastor, to whom St Amand related his adventure.
"Oh, my son!" said the good priest, "what have you done? See you not,
that you have entered into a contract with the powers of darkness?
Unable to wreak their vengeance on you, when you had guarded yourself
with the blessed sign of our redemption, the fiend has had recourse to
craft to draw you into his power. You have promised a sacrifice, to the
enemy of God and man, but you have done it in ignorance. Abjure then,
solemnly, the cursed contract, and dread no longer the vengeance of the
fiend."</p>

<p>The young soldier made the required abjuration, during which, the
most dreadful noises were heard: it was the last effort of the demon's
vengeance; for, from that time, he was never seen, nor heard of. St
Amand married Ninette, who had given him such a courageous proof of her
love; and the cross transmitted from her, to her descendants, was
always considered by them as the most precious part of their
inheritance. In process of time, the family became wealthy, and a great
grandson of St Amand erected the monument we have described, to
commemorate the miraculous escape of his ancestor.</p>
