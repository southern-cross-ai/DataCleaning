<h1>Bloody Blanche</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Marcel Schwob</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>When Guillaume de Flavy grew weary of warfare and politics, he
decided to increase his fortunes by taking a wife. He was a big
strong man, broad-shouldered, with a hairy and bosomy chest. He could
grab two armed knights, one with each hand, and force them both to
the ground.</p>

<p>He used to strap on his leggings and go around his lands in
person, right through the mire, clapping his heavy hand upon the
backs of the muddied men who stooped among the furrows.</p>

<p>His broad face was flushed with the blood that always throbbed at
his temples; and he used to crack the bones between his teeth when
eating meat.</p>

<p>One day, riding within the borders of his meadows near Rheims, he
saw the fields belonging to Robert d'Ovrebreuc. He dismounted and
entered the great hall of the house. The enormous chests arranged
along the walls, each one big enough to climb into, looked shabby;
the dining table was rickety, the fire-irons were rusts, and the spit
was coated with dirt an inch thick. Here and there he noticed a
cobbler's apron, awls, and some flat hammers; and there was a man
sitting cross-legged in a corner darning a coarse linen shirt. But
then, squatting on the hearthstones, staring directly at him in
surprise, with golden hair strewn about her pallid face, a little
girl turned her head towards Guillaume de Flavy. She might have been
ten years old: her chest was flat, her limbs scrawny, her hands tiny;
but her mouth was a woman's, sliced across her pale face like a
bloody gash.</p>

<p>It was Blanche d'Ovrebreuc, whose father had within the last few
days succeeded to the title of vicomte d'Acy. Hump-backed and long in
the beard, his hands now fit only for handling tools, he regarded his
fiefs with the startled and worried appearance of a man handling a
dangerous object. The English squire Jacques de B&eacute;thune, who
served under Luxembourg, had already come asking for his daughter,
but her father was undecided, not knowing whether he could expect a
better offer. The estate he had inherited was saddled with debts of
three hundred thousand crowns, the late vicomte d'Acy having himself
frittered away a good ten thousand.</p>

<p>Perhaps the English or the Luxemburgers could take care of
that.</p>

<p>But it was Guillaume de Flavy who carried little Blanche away. He
paid off the debts in order to keep hold of the lands. Once he had
wed her legally, he promised to delay their true marriage for three
years. And so, being an impressive-looking man, he got his hands on
d'Aey's estates and on this scrawny, lawless child. Three months
later little Blanche was wandering around the castle like a diseased
cat, scowling through deadened eyes, having undergone the cruel
nuptials of Guillaume de Flavy.</p>

<p>She did not, and could not, understand, being so very different in
years and in nature. The man was hard on her, as he was on his
barber: at mealtimes, when he had wiped his mouth on the back of his
hand, he flung the food he no longer wanted in the grovelling
barber's face. He yelled and cursed continually, keeping his wine and
victuals in his own clutches. He would gather all the plates in front
of him, leaving Blanche's father and mother at each end of the table.
The mother was already feeble-minded and skeletal--she lived on for a
while, scarcely ever eating or speaking, old and incoherent, then
became sickly pale, and died. The father, wasting away as if he had
taken poison, signed some deeds in Flavy's favour, under the
influence of drink: he had given up his debt-encumbered estates, and
now rubbed his hands together purring over his handsome pension. But
now that he was no longer fed, he wanted money. The poor frightened
creature protested feebly, and composed in his trembling hand a list
of complaints to the king.</p>

<p>Guillaume intercepted these papers; the old man wailed, and the
servants put him in a dungeon.</p>

<p>Letting some daylight into it a month later, they found a dried-up
corpse, its teeth stuck into a shoe from which the rats had gnawed
away the toe.</p>

<p>Little Blanche became uncommonly greedy. She would eat sweets
until she dropped, and her cruel red mouth was stuffed with plump
pies and cream. Leaning over the table with her eyes up against her
food, always staring glassily, she would gobble away at great speed;
then she would throw back her head and gulp down great mouthfuls of
Burgundy, bringing a visible wave of pleasure through her face. She
would upend a goblet of wine down into her gaping mouth, hold it in
her puffed-up cheeks without swallowing, and squirt it out into the
faces of the guests like a living fountain. After the meal, she would
stagger to her feet, fuddled with drink, and do it against the wall
standing up like a man.</p>

<p>These habits appealed to Aurbandac the Bastard, a swarthy and
sinister man whose eyebrows met in a straight line over his nose. He
often came to see Flavy, who was a kinsman, and whose lands he
coveted impatiently. Lithe, wiry, strong as steel in arms and legs,
he cunningly sized up Guillaume's cumbersome body. But little Blanche
was not aroused by him; so he delicately raised the subject of her
clothes, expressing his surprise to see her still wearing her wedding
gown, for he could tell that she had grown since then. He mentioned
some young townswomen who had scarlet dresses of Mechlin lace and
squirrel-fur linings, with long sleeves and a hood trailing red or
green silks down to the ground from its elongated peak. She listened
as if he were telling her about a doll's clothes. Then Aurbandac the
Bastard picked up a glass to join her in a toast, and got her
drinking and laughing, plying her with sweets and poking fun at her
husband, so that she splashed the wine about like a bird bathing and
flapping in a puddle.</p>

<p>The barber, his long face scarred by mutton-bones, leant between
them, at the Bastard's ear.</p>

<p>They plotted to seize the castle: it would be the Bastard's to
keep, while the wife in her innocence would be anyone's, so long as
she had the key to the cellar and the pantry.</p>

<p>One evening, Guillaume de Flay injured his face, tripping on the
threshold and opening up a wound across his cheek and nose. He called
out for the barber, who instantly brought in strange-smelling
medicated bandages. As the night wore on, Guillaume's face bulged up:
his tightly stretched skin was turning white with brown flecks, his
protruding eves were running all the time, and his wound looked
loathesomely gangrenous.</p>

<p>Throughout the next morning he stayed in an armchair, howling with
pain. Little Blanche seemed to be so terrified that she forgot to
drink; and from the other end of the room she watched Guillaume with
her limpid eyes, while her bright red lips twitched feebly.</p>

<p>Hardly had Guillaume gone upstairs to bed, watched over by the
squire Bastoigne, when the castle echoed with a thousand slight
noises. Blanche listened, with one ear to the door and a finger
pressed to her lips. A muffled clashing of coats of mail could be
heard, the dull jarring of arms, the creaking of the grille to the
heavy postern-gate, and an unaccustomed crackling in the courtyard; a
number of mysterious lights from lanterns came and went. Meanwhile
the pitch torches in the great hall where joints of meat were always
served up burned with an upright flame, sending a long thread of
smoke up through the placid air.</p>

<p>Blanche climbed the stairs to her husband's bedchamber on childish
tiptoes; he was sleeping on his back, his puffed-up features heavily
bandaged and facing the rafters. Bastoigne left, because Blanche made
as if to get into bed. And in fact she did slip into it, clasping
that fearsome head in her arms and fondling it. Guillaume was
breathing with difficulty, in fitful gasps. Then little Blanche threw
herself across him, snatched the pillow, held it firmly on to his
swaddled face, and then slid open a Judas-trap above the bed, which
was usually kept sealed up.</p>

<p>The swarthy head of the Bastard poked through it, as he crept in
cautiously. With one bound, he was kneeling on Guillaume's chest, and
he bludgeoned him twice, then three times, with a cloven staff he
carried with him. The man burst out of the sheets, sending out a
dreadful yell from his swollen mouth. But as Bastoigne opened the
door, the barber emerged from under the bed and tackled him; and the
Bastard slit Guillaume's throat with the broad dagger he wore on his
belt. The corpse jerked upright and rolled on to the ground, pulling
little Blanche with it; she stayed there on the floor, pinned down by
the still-warm corpse, drenched in the tepid blood flowing from its
throat--because her dress was caught under her dying husband, and she
was not strong enough to pull herself free.</p>

<p>While the Bastard dashed to the window, the barber considerately
helped little Blanche to her feet; and since Blanche d'Ovrebreuc,
vicomtesse d'Acy, was a religious soul, she wiped her mouth and her
husband's face with her Picardy hood, placed it over his swollen
face, and recited in her childish voice three Our Fathers and one
Hail Mary, amid the yelling of the Bastard's men, who were busy
ransacking the coffers.</p>
