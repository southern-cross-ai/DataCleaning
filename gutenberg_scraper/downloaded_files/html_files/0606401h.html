<h1>The Extraordinary Adventure of a Chief Mate</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>W. Clark Russell</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>In the Newspapers of 1876 appeared the following extracts from the
log of a merchantman:</p>

<p><i>"VOLCANIC ISLAND IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC.--The ship 'Hercules',
of Liverpool, lately arrived in the Mersey, reports as follows: March
23, in 2 degrees 12' north latitude, 33 degrees 27' west longitude, a
shock of earthquake was felt and shortly afterward a mass of land was
hove up at a distance of about two miles from the ship. Michael
Balfour, the chief officer, fell overboard. The buoy was thrown to
him, the ship brought to the wind, and a boat lowered within fifteen
minutes of the occurrence. But though the men sought the chief mate
for some time, nothing could be seen of him, and it is supposed that
he sank shortly after falling into the sea. Masters of vessels are
recommended to keep a sharp lookout in approaching the situation of
the new island as given above. No doubt it will be sighted by other
ships, and duly reported."</i></p>

<p>I am Michael Balfour; I it was who fell overboard; and it is
needless for me to say here that I was not drowned. The volcanic
island was only reported by one other ship, and the reason why will
be read at large in this account of my strange adventure and merciful
deliverance.</p>

<p>It was the evening of the 23d of March, 1876. Our passage to the
equator from Sydney had been good, but for three days we had been
bothered with light head winds and calms, and since four o'clock this
day the ocean had stretched in oil-smooth undulations to its margin,
with never a sigh of air to crispen its marvelous serenity into
shadow. The courses were hauled up, the staysails down, the mizzen
brailed up; the canvas delicately beat the masts to the soft swing of
the tall spars, and sent a small rippling thunder through the still
air, like a roll of drums heard at a distance. The heat was great; I
had never remembered a more biting sun. The pitch in the seams was
soft as putty, the atmosphere was full of the smell of blistered
paint, and it was like putting your hand on a red-hot stove to touch
the binnacle hood or grasp for an instant an iron belaying-pin.</p>

<p>A sort of loathing comes into a man with a calm like this. "The
very deep did rot," says the poet; and you understood the fancy when
you marked the blind heave of the swell to the sun standing in the
midst of a sky of brass, with his wake under him sinking in a sinuous
dazzle, as though it was his fiery glance piercing to the green
depths a thousand fathoms deep. It was hot enough to slacken the
nerves and give the imagination a longer scope than sanity would have
it ride by. That was why, perhaps, I found something awful and
forbidding in the sunset, though at another time it might scarcely
have detained my gaze a minute. But it is true, nevertheless, that
others besides me gaped at the wonderful gushings of hot
purple,--arrested whirlpools of crimson haze, they looked,--in the
heart of which the orb sat rayless, flooding the sea with blood under
him, so magnificently fell was the hue, and flushing the sky with
twenty dies of gold and orange, till, in the far east, the radiance
fainted into the delicacy of pale amber.</p>

<p>"Yon's a sunset," said Captain Matthews, a North of England man,
to me, "to make a fellow think of the last day."</p>

<p>"I'm looking at it, sir," said I, "as though I had never seen a
sunset before. That's the oddest part of it, to my mind. There's fire
enough there to eat a gale up. How should a cat's-paw crawl then?"
And I softly whistled, while he wetted his finger and held it up; but
to no purpose; the draught was all between the rails, and they blew
forward and aft with every swing of the sails.</p>

<p>When the dusk came along, the silence upon the sea was something
to put all sorts of moods into a man. The sky was a hovering velvet
stretch of stars, with a young moon lying curled among them, and
winkings of delicate violet sheet-lightning down in the southwest, as
though some gigantic-tinted lantern, passing, flung its light upon
the dark blue obscure there. The captain went below, after a long,
impatient look round, and I overhung the rail, peering into the water
alongside, or sending my gaze into the frightful distance, where the
low-lying stars hung. With every soft dip of the ship's side to the
slant of the dark folds, there shot forth puffs of cloudy phosphor,
intermixed with a sparkling of sharper fires now and again, blue,
yellow, and green, like worms of flame striking out of their cocoons
of misty radiance. The noise of the canvas on high resembled the
stirring of pinions, and the cheep of a block, the grind of a parrel,
helped the illusion, as though the sounds were the voices of huge
birds restlessly beating their pinions aloft.</p>

<p>Presently the man at the wheel startled me with an observation. I
went to him, and he pointed upward with a long, shadowy arm. I
looked, and saw a corposant, as it is called at sea,--a St. Elmo's
fire,---burning at the end of the crossjack-yard. The yard lay
square, and the polished sea beneath gave back the reflection so
clearly that the mystic fire lay like a huge glow-worm on the black
mirror.</p>

<p>"There should be wind not far off," said the helmsman, in a
subdued voice; for few sailors can see one of these lights without a
stirring of their superstitious instincts, and this particular
exhalation hung close to us.</p>

<p>"I hope so," said I, "though I don't know where it's to come
from."</p>

<p>As I spoke, the light vanished. I ran my eye over the yards,
expecting its reappearance; but it returned no more, and the sails
rose pale and phantom-like to the stars. I was in an odd humour, and
this was an apparition not to brighten one up. Of course one knows
all about these marine corpse-candles, and can explain their nature;
but nevertheless the sudden kindling of them upon the darkness of the
night, in the dead hush of the calm or amid the fury of the shrieking
hurricane, produces feelings which there is nothing in science to
resolve. I could have laughed to find myself sending a half-awed look
aloft, as if I expected to see some visionary hand at work upon
another one of these graveyard illuminations--with a stealing out of
some large, sad face to the melancholy glow; but I returned to the
side very pensive for all that, and there stood watching the fiery
outline of a shark subtly sneaking close to the surface (insomuch
that the wake of its fin slipped away in little coils of green flame)
toward the ship's bows.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the dark curl of a light air of wind shattered
the starlight in the sea, and our canvas fell asleep. I called to the
watch to trim sail, and in a few moments the decks were busy with the
figures of men pulling and hauling and surging out at the ropes in
sulky, slumberous growlings. The captain arrived.</p>

<p>"Little worth having in this, I fear," said he. But make the most
of it. Get the foretopmast stunsail run up. If she creeps but a
league, it is a league to the good."</p>

<p>The sail was sleepily set. Humbugging about with stunsails to the
cat's-paws little pleased the men, especially at night. For three
days they had been boxhauling the yards about to no purpose, and it
was sickening work running stunsail-booms out to airs that died in
their struggles to reach us. However, here was a draught at last, and
the old gurgling and moaning sounds of the breathless, sluggish swell
washing heavily like liquid lead to the sides were replaced by the
tinkling noises of waters parting at the bows with a pretty little
seething of expiring foam, and the hiss of exploding froth-bells. At
eleven o'clock the light breeze was still holding, and the ship was
floating softly through the dusk, the paring of moon swaying like a
silver sickle over the port mizzen topsail yard-arm, everything quiet
along the decks, no light save the sheen from the lamps in the
binnacle, and nothing stirring but the figure of a man in the
forecastle pacing athwartships, and blotting at every step a handful
of stars which lay like dust on the blackness, under the yawn of the
forecourse. On a sudden a steamer's lights showed on the starboard
bow--a green beam, and a yellow one above, with the water on fire
beneath them, and sparks floating away upon her coil of smoke, that
made you think of the spangles of a falling rocket. She went past
swiftly, at no great distance from us. There was not a moan in the
hot breeze to disturb the wonderful ocean stillness, and you almost
thought you caught the beating of the iron heart in her, and the
curious monotonous songs which engines sing as they work. She swept
past like a phantom, running a line of illuminated windows along
which resembled a row of streetlamps out in the darkness; and as she
came on to our quarter she struck seven bells (half-past eleven), the
rich metallic notes of which I clearly heard; and with the trembling
of the last stroke upon the ear her outline melted.</p>

<p>At that instant a peculiar thrill ran through the ship. It may be
likened to the trembling in a floor when a heavy waggon passes in the
street outside. It was over in a breath, but I could have sworn that
it was not my fancy. I walked aft to the wheel, and said to the man,
"Did you notice anything just now?"</p>

<p>"Seemed to me as if the vessel trembled like," he replied.</p>

<p>"As he spoke the ship shook again, this time strongly. It was
something more than a shudder; the sensation was for all the world as
though she had scraped over a shoal of rock or shingle. There was a
little clatter below, a noise of broken glass. The watch, who had
been dozing on deck, sprang to their feet, and their ejaculations of
surprise and fear rolled in a growl among them. The captain ran out
of the companionway in his shirt and trousers.</p>

<p>"What was that, Mr. Balfour?" he bawled.</p>

<p>"Either the shock of an earthquake," said I, "or a whale sliding
along our keel."</p>

<p>"Get a cast of the lead! get a cast of the lead!" he shouted.</p>

<p>This was done to the full scope of the hand-line, without bottom,
of course. By this time the watch below had tumbled up, and all hands
were on deck, staring aloft or over the side, sniffing, spitting,
muttering, and wondering what had happened.</p>

<p>"There's that bloomin' compreesant come again!" exclaimed a hoarse
voice; and, sure enough, a light similar to the one that had hung at
the crossjack yard-arm now floated upon the end of the upper
main-topsail-yard.</p>

<p>"The devil's abroad tonight!" exclaimed the captain. "There's
sulphur enough about," and he fell a-snuffling.</p>

<p>What followed might have made an infidel suppose so; for scarce
were the words out of his mouth when there happened an astonishing
blast of noise, as load and violent as that of forty or fifty cannons
fired all at once, and out of the black sea no farther than a mile
broad on the starboard beam rose a pillar of fire, crimson as the
light of the setting sun and as dazzling too; it lived while you
might have counted twenty, but in that time it lighted up the sea for
leagues and leagues, put out the stars, and made the sky resemble a
canopy of yellow satin; we on the ship saw another's faces as if by
daylight; the shrouds and masts and our own figures cast jet-black
shadows on the deck; the whole ship flashed out to that amazing
radiance like a fabric sun-touched. The column of fire then flattened
and disappeared, and the night rolled down upon our blinded eyes as
black as thunder.</p>

<p>There was no noise--no hissing as of boiling water. If the furious
report that preceded the leap of the fire had rendered its coming
terrible, its extinction was made not less awful by the tomb-like
stillness that attended it. I sprang on to the rail, believing I
could perceive a dark mass--like a deeper dye upon the blackness that
way--upon the water, and to steady myself caught hold of the mizzen
loyal backstay, swinging out to my arm's length and peering with all
my might. My excitement was great, and the consternation that
possessed the ship's crew was upon me. As I leaned, the vessel heeled
violently to a large swell caused by the volcanic disturbances. The
roll was extraordinarily severe, heaving the vessel down to her
covering-board; and the great hill of water running silent and in
darkness through the sea, so that it could neither be viewed nor
heard, made the sickening lurch a dreadful surprise and wonder.</p>

<p>It was in that moment that I fell overboard. I suppose my grip of
the backstay relaxed when the ship lay down; but, let the thing have
happened as it would, in a breath I was under water. It is said that
the swiftness of thought is best shown by dreams. This may be so; yet
I cannot believe that thought was ever swifter in a dream than it was
in me ere I came to the surface; for in those few seconds I gathered
exactly what had befallen me, wondered whether my fall had been seen,
whether I should be saved, realized my hopeless condition if I had
not been observed, and, above all, was thinking steadfastly and with
horror of the shark I had not long ago watched stemming in fire past
the ship. I was a very indifferent swimmer, and what little power I
had in that way was like to be paralysed by thoughts of the shark. I
rose and fetched a breath, shook the water out of my eyes, and looked
for the ship. She had been sliding along at the rate of about four
knots an hour; but had she been at ten she could not seem to have
gone farther from me during the brief while I was submerged. From the
edge of the water, where my eyes were, she appeared a towering pale
shadow about a mile off. I endevoured to scream out; but whether the
cold of the plunge had bereft my voice, or that I had swallowed water
enough to stop my pipes, I found I could utter nothing louder than a
small groan. I made several strokes with my arms, and suddenly spied
a life-buoy floating almost twenty yards ahead of me. I made for it
in a transport of joy, for the sight of it was all the assurance I
could ask that they knew on the ship that I had tumbled over-board;
and, coming to the buoy, I seized and threw it over my head, and then
got it under my arms and so floated.</p>

<p>The breeze, such as it was, was on the ships quarter, and she
would need to describe a considerable arc before she rounded to. I
could hear very faintly the voices on board, the flinging down of
coils of rope, the dim echoes of hurry and commotion. I again sought
to exert my lungs, but could deliver no louder note than a moan. The
agony of mind I was under lest a shark should seize me I cannot
express, and my strained eyeballs would come from the tall shadow of
the ship to the sea about me in a wild searching of the liquid ebony
of it for the sparkling configuration of the most abhorred of all
fish. I could have sworn that hours elapsed before they lowered a
boat from the ship, that seemed to grow fainter and fainter every
time I looked at her, so swallowing is the character of ocean
darkness, and so subtle apparently, so fleet in fact, the settling
away of a fabric under canvas from an object stationary on the water.
I could distinctly hear the rattle of the oars in the rowlocks, and
the splash of the dipped blades, but could not discern the boat. It
was speedily evident, however, that they were pulling wide of me; my
ear could not mistake. Again I tried to shout, but to no purpose.
Manifestly no one had thought of taking my bearings when I fell, and
I, who lay south, was being sought for south-west.</p>

<p>Time passed; the boat never approached me within a quarter of a
mile. They must instantly have heard me, could I have halloed; but my
throat refused its office. I reckoned that they continued to row here
and there for about half an hour, during which they were several
times hailed by the captain, as I supposed; the sound of the oars
then died. A little later I heard the very faint noises made by their
hoisting the boat and hauling in upon the braces, and then there was
nothing for me to do but to watch, with drying eyes, the shadow of
the ship till it faded, and the stars shone where she had been.</p>

<p>The sky shed very little light, and there was no foam to cast an
illumination of its own. However, by this time, as you will suppose,
I was used to my situation; that is to say, the horror and the
novelty of my condition had abated, and settled into a miserable
feeling of despair; so that I was like a dying man who had passed
days in an open boat, and who languidly directs his eyes over the
gunwale at the sea, with the hopelessness that is bred by familiarity
with his dreadful posture. It was some time after the ship had melted
into the airy dusk that I seemed to notice, for the first time since
I had been in the life-buoy, the lump of blackness at which I had
been straining my eyes when the vessel keeled and I fell. It had the
elusiveness of a light at sea, that is best seen (at a distance) by
gazing a little on one side of it. It lay, a black mass, and whether
it was a vast huddle of weeds, or a great whale killed by the
earthquake, or solid land uphove by the volcanic rupture, was not
conjecturable. It hung, still and not very tall, for I could not see
that it put out any stars, and was about a mile distant. Whatever it
might prove, I could not be worse off near on or amid it than I was
here; so, setting my face toward it, I began to strike out with my
legs and arms.</p>

<p>The water was so fiery, it clipped in flashes to every blow of my
hands. I swam in the utmost terror, never knowing but the next moment
I should be feeling the teeth of a shark upon my legs, for the
sparkling of the sea to my kicks and motions was signal enough for
such a beast if it was a league distant; but I may as well sat here
that there is no doubt the shock of the earthquake and the flame
effectually cleared the sea in its neighborhood of every kind of fish
that floated in it, though the hope of such a thing could yield me
but very little comfort while I swam.</p>

<p>I continued to make good progress, and presently, approaching the
block of blackness, for so it looked, perceived that it was certainly
land,--a solid rock, in short,--the head of some mountainous
submarine formation lifted ten or twelve feet above the sea. I could
now discern a faintness of vapour circling up from it and showing
like steam against the stars. Its front stretched a length of a few
hundred feet; how far it went behind I could not tell. A small sound
of creaming waters came from it, produced by the light swell washing
its shelter side. It lay all in a line of grayish darkness even when
I was quite close, and I could see nothing but the shapeless body of
it. On a sudden my feet struck ground, and I waded thirty paces along
a shelf that was under water till my paces lifted to the dry beach.
But by this time I was fearfully exhausted; I could scarcely breathe.
My legs and arms were numbed to the weight of lead. The atmosphere
was warm, but not unbearably so--not hotter than it had been at noon
in the ship. Steam crawled up from every pore, like the drainings of
smoke from damp straw, but it did not add to the distress of my
breathing. I made shift to stagger onward till I had gone about fifty
feet from the wash of the sea. Nature then broke down; my knees gave
way, I stumbled and fell--whether in a swoon or whether in a
death-like slumber, I cannot say; all I can tell is that when I
awoke, or recovered my senses, the sun stood fifteen degrees above
the horizon, and I opened my eyes upon a hot and dazzling sky.</p>

<p>I sat up in the utmost amazement. My mind for some time was all
abroad, and I could recollect nothing. Memory then entered me with a
bound, and I staggered to my feet with a cry. The first thing I took
notice of was that my clothes were nearly dry, which was not very
reconcilable with the steam that was still issuing from the island,
though it was as I say. My bones ached cruelly, but I was not
sensible of any particular languor. The brilliance was so blinding
that I had to employ my eyes very warily in order to see; and it was
not until I had kept opening and shutting them and shading them with
my hands for some minutes that they acquired their old power. The
island on which I stood had unquestionably been hove up in the night
by the earthquake. I cannot figure it better than by asking you to
imagine a gigantic mass of pumice-stone, somewhat flat on top, and
shelving on all sides very gently to the water, lying afloat but
steady on the sea. It was of the hue of pumice, and as clean as an
egg-shell, without a grain of calcined dust or any appearance of
scoriae that I could anywhere observe. It was riddled with holes,
some wide and deep--a very honeycomb; and that I did not break my
neck or a limb in my staggering walk from the beach in the darkness,
I must ever account the most miraculous part of my adventure.</p>

<p>But what (when I had my whole wits) riveted my attention, and held
me staring open-mouthed, as though in good truth the apparition of
the devil had arisen before me, was the body of a ship leaning on its
bilge, at not more than a gunshot from where I stood, looking toward
the interior. When my eyes first went to the thing I could not
believe them. I imagined it some trick of the volcanic explosion that
had fashioned a portion of land or rock (as it may be called) into
the likeness of a ship; but, on gazing steadfastly, I saw that it was
indeed a vessel, rendered extraordinarily beautiful and wonderful by
being densely covered with shells of a hundred different kinds, by
which her bulk was enlarged, though her shape was preserved. Bright
fountains of water were gushing from fifty places in her; all these
waterfalls shone like rainbows, and showed surprisingly soft and
lovely against the velvet green of the moss and the gray and
kaleidoscopic tints of the shells upon her. Lost in amazement, I made
my way toward her, and stood viewing her at a short distance. She had
three lower masts standing--one right in the bows, and the mizzen
raking very much aft. All three masts were supported by shrouds, and
that was all the rigging the sea had left. She looked to be made of
shells and moss; her shrouds and masts were incrusted as thickly as
her hull. She was a mere tub of a ship in shape,being scarce twice as
long as she was broad, with great fat buttocks, a very tall stern
narrowing atop, and low bows with a prodigious curve to the
stem-head. I am not well versed in the shipping of olden times, but I
would have willingly staked all I was worth in the world that the
fabric before me belonged to a period not much later than the days of
Columbus, and that she had been sunk at least three centuries below
the sea; and it was also perfectly clear to me that she had risen in
the daylight, out of her green and oozy sepulchre, with the upheaval
of the bed on which she lay to the convulsion that had produced the
island.</p>

<p>But my situation was not one to suffer me to stand long idly
wondering and staring. The moment I brought my eyes away from the
ship to the mighty desolation of the blue and gleaming ocean, a
horror broke upon me, my heart turned into lead, and in the anguish
of my spirits I involuntarily lifted my clinched hands to God. What
was to become of me? I had no boat, no means of making anything to
bear me, nothing but the life-buoy, that was no better than a trap
for sharks to tear me to pieces in. I was thirsty, but there was no
fresh water on this steaming speck of rock, and I tell you, the
knowing that there was none, and that unless rain fell I must die of
thirst, had like to have driven me mad. Where the ship was, and
beyond it, the island rose somewhat in the form of a gentle
undulation. I walked that way, and there obtained a view of the whole
island, which was very nearly circular, like the head of a hill,
somewhat after the shape of a saucepan lid. It resembled a great mass
of sponge to the sight, and there was no break upon its surface save
the encrusted ship, which did, indeed, form a very conspicuous
object. Happening to look downward, I spied a large dead fish, of the
size of a cod of sixteen or eighteen pounds, lying a-dry in a hole. I
put my arm down and dragged it out, and, hoping by appeasing my
hunger to help my thirst somewhat, I opened my knife and cut out a
little raw steak, and ate it. The moisture in the flesh refreshed me,
and, that the sun not spoil the carcass, I carried it to the shadow
made by the ship, and put it under one of the waterfalls that the
play might keep it sweet. There was plenty more dead fish in the
numerous holes, and I picked out two and put them in the shade; but I
knew that the great heat must soon taint them and rot the rest,
whence would come a stench that might make the island poisonous to
me.</p>

<p>I sat down under the bends of the ship for the shadow it threw,
and gazed at the sea. Perhaps I ought to have felt grateful for the
miraculous creation of this spot of land, when, but for it, I must
have miserably perished in the life-buoy, dying a most dreadful,
slow, tormenting death, if some shark had not quickly dispatched me;
but the solitude was so frightful, my doom seemed so assured, I was
threatened with such dire sufferings ere my end came, that, in the
madness and despair of my heart, I could have cursed the intervention
of this rock, which promised nothing but the prolongation of my
misery. There was but one live spark amid the ashes of my hopes;
namely, that the island lay in the highway of ships, and that it was
impossible a vessel could sight so unusual an object without
deviating from her course to examine it. That was all the hope I had;
but God knows there was nothing in it to keep me alive when I set off
against it the consideration that there was no water on the island,
no food; that a ship would have to sail close to remark so flat and
little a point as this rock; and that days, ay, and weeks might
elapse before the rim of yonder boundless surface, stretching in airy
leagues of deep blue to the azure sky at the horizon, should be
broken by the star-like shining of a sail.</p>

<p>Happily, the wondrous incrusted bulk was at hand to draw my
thoughts away from my hideous condition; for I verily believe, had my
eye found nothing to rest upon but the honeycombed pumice, my brain
would have given way. I stood up and took a long view of the
petrified shell-covered structure, feeling a sort of awe in me while
I looked, for it was a kind of illustration of the saying of the sea
giving up its dead, and the thing stirred me almost as though it had
been a corpse that had risen to the sun, after having been a secret
of the deep for three hundred years.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that if I could board her she might furnish me
with a shelter from the dew of the night. She had channels with long
plates, all looking as of they were formed of shells; and stepping
round to the side toward which she leaned, I found the fore
channel-plates to be within reach of my hands. The shells were
slippery and cutting; but I was a sailor, and there would have been
nothing in a harder climb than this to daunt me. So, after a bit of a
struggle, I succeeded in hauling myself into the chains, and thence
easily dragged myself over the rail on to the deck.</p>

<p>The sight between the bulwarks was far more lovely and surprising
than the spectacle presented by the ships sides. For the decks seemed
not only formed of shells of a hundred different hues; there was a
great abundance of branching corals, white as milk, and marine plants
of kinds for which I could not find names, of several brilliant
colours; so that, with the delicate velvet of the moss, the dark
shades of seaweed of figurations as dainty as those of ferns, and the
different sorts of shells, big and little, all lying as solid as if
they had been set in concrete, the appearance of the ship submitted
was something incredibly fantastic and admirable. Whether the hatches
were on or not I could not tell, so thickly coated were the decks;
but whether or not, the deposits and marine growths rendered the
surface as impenetrable as iron, and I believe it would have kept a
small army of laborers plying their pickaxes for a whole week to have
made openings into the hold through that shelly coating of mail.</p>

<p>My eye was taken by a peculiar sort of protuberance at the foot of
the mainmast. It stood as high as I did, and had something of the
shape of a man, and, indeed, after staring at it for sometime, I
perceived that it had been a man, that is to say, it was a human
skeleton, filled up to the bulk of a living being by the shells and
barnacles which covered it. Ashore, it might have passes for some odd
imitation in shells of the human figure; but, viewing it as I did, in
the midst of that great ocean, amid the frightful solitude of the
great dome of heaven, in a ship that was like the handiwork of the
sea-gods at the bottom of the deep--I say, looking at it as I did,
and knowing the thing had a life in centuries past, and had risen
thus wildly garnished out of the unfathomable secret heart of the
ocean, it awed me to an extent I cannot express, and I gazed as
though fascinated. In all probability, this was a man who, when the
ship floundered, had been securely lashed to the mast for safety or
for punishment.</p>

<p>I turned away at last with a shudder, and walked aft. The wreck
was unquestionably some Spanish or Portuguese carrack or galleon as
old as I have stated; for you saw her shape as you stood on her deck,
and her castellated stern rising into a tower from her poop and
poop-royal, as it was called, proved her age as convincingly as if
the date of her launch had been scored upon her.</p>

<p>What was in her hold? Thousands of pounds' worth of precious ore
in gold and silver bars and ingots, for all I knew; but had she been
flush to her upper decks with doubloons and ducats, I would have
exchanged them all for the sight of a ship, or for a rill of fresh
water. I searched the horizon with feverish eyes; there was nothing
in sight. The afternoon was advancing; the sun was burning unbearably
midway down the western sky, and my thirst tormented me. I dropped
over the side and cut another steak of fish; but though the moisture
temporarily relieved me, the salt of the water flowing upon it dried
into my throat and increased my sufferings. There was a light air
blowing, and the sea trembled to it into a deeper hue of blue, and
met in a glorious stream of twinkling rubies under the setting sun. I
counted half a score of wet black fins round about the island, and
understood the sharks had recovered from their scare, and had
returned to see if the earthquake had cast up anything to eat.</p>

<p>When the sun sank, the night came along in a stride; the curl of
the moon looked wanly down upon me, and the sky flashed with
starshine, so rich and magnificent was the glow of the nearer
luminaries. I re-entered the ship and stepped to the cabin front,
over which extended a "break" or penthouse, under which I might find
some shelter from the dew that was already falling like rain, and
squatted down, lascer-fashion, with my back against the
shell-armoured bulkhead. Great Father! never had I known what
solitude was till then. There was no sound save the quiet foaming of
waters draining from the wreck, and the purring of the very light
swell softly moving upon the beach, and the faint, scarce audible
whispering of the dew-laden draught of air stirring in the stony,
fossilised shrouds. My throat felt like hot brass; I tried to pray,
but could not. Imagination grew a little delirious, and I would
sometimes fancy that the terrible shape at the foot of the mainmast
moved as if seeking to free itself and approach me. There was a
constant glancing of shooting stars on high, swift sparklings and
trailings of luminous dust, and, as on the previous night, here and
there upon the horizon a dim violet play of sheet-lightning. It was
like being at the bottom of the sea, alive there, to be in this
black, shelly, weed-smelling ship. Whether my thought came to me
waking or sleeping I cannot tell; but I know some mad fancies
possessed me, and upon the sable canvas of the night, imagination,
like a magic lantern, flung a dozen febrile-tinctured pictures, and I
particularly recollect conceiving that I was my own soul at the
bottom of the ocean in the ship; that, in the green twilight of the
valley in which I was, I saw many forms of dead men standing or lying
or sitting, preserving the postures in which they had come floating
down into the darkly gleaming profound--figures of sailors of
different centuries clad in the garb of their times, intermixed with
old ordinance making course and rusty streaks upon the sand, the
glimmer of minted money, the gleam of jewels, and fish brightly
appareled and of shapes unknown to man floating round about like
fragments of rainbow. My dreams always wound up with imaginations of
babbling drinks, and then I'd wake with the froth upon my lips.
However, I got some ease by leaving my handkerchief to soak in the
dew and then sucking it.</p>

<p>Several times during the night I had got on to the upper poop--the
deck above the poop anciently termed the poop-royal--and looked
around me. But there was nothing to see, not a shadow to catch the
eye. The breeze freshened somewhat about midnight, and the air was
made pleasant by the musical noises of running waters. I fell asleep
an hour before dawn, and when I awoke the early ashen line was
brightening to the east. The birth of the day is rapid in those
parallels, and the light of the morning was soon all over sea and
sky. I turned to search the ocean, and the first thing I saw was a
brig not above half a mile from the island. She had studding sails
set, and was going north, creeping along before the breeze. The
instant I saw her I rushed on to the poop, where my figure would best
be seen, and fell to flourishing my handkerchief like a maniac. I
sought to shout, but my voice was even weaker than it had been after
I fell overboard. I have no power to describe my feelings while I
waited to see what the brig would do. I cursed myself for not having
kept a lookout, so that I might have had plenty of time to signal to
her as she approached. If she abandoned me I knew I must perish, as
every instant assured me that I had neither mental nor physical power
to undergo another day and night without drink and without hope upon
the island.</p>

<p>On a sudden she hauled up the lee claw of her mainsail, boom-ended
her studding sails and put her helm over. I knew what this signified,
and, clasping my hands, I looked up to God.</p>

<p>Presently a boat was lowered and pulled toward the island. I
dropped over the side, tumbling down upon my nose in my weakness, and
made with trembling legs to the beach, standing, in my eagerness, in
the very curl of the wash there. There were three men in the boat,
and they eyed me, as they rowed, over their shoulders as if I had
been a spectre.</p>

<p>"Who are you, mate, and what country is this?" exclaimed the man
who pulled stroke, standing up to stretch his hand to me.</p>

<p>I pointed to my throat, and gasped, "Water!" I could barely
articulate.</p>

<p>Nothing in this wide world moves sailors like a cry to them for
water. In an instant the three men had dragged me into the boat, and
were straining like horses at their oars, as they sent the boat
flashing through the rippling water. We dashed alongside.</p>

<p>"He's dying of thirst!" was their cry.</p>

<p>I was bundled on deck; the captain ran below, and returned with a
small draught of wine and water.</p>

<p>"Start with that," said he. "You'll be fitter for a longer pull
later on."</p>

<p>The drink gave me back my voice; yet for a while I could scarce
speak, for the tears that swelled my heart.</p>

<p>"Are there any more of ye?" said the captain.</p>

<p>I answered "No."</p>

<p>"But what land's this?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"An island uphove by an earthquake," said I.</p>

<p>"Great thunder!" he cried. "And what's that arrangement in shells
and weeds atop it?"</p>

<p>"A vessel that's probably been three hundred years at the bottom,"
I answered.</p>

<p>"The quake rose it, hey?"</p>

<p>"Just as it is," said I</p>

<p>"Well, boil me," cried the worthy fellow, "if it don't seem to
good to be true! Mr. Fletcher, trim sail, sir. Best shove
along--shove along. Come, sir, step below with me for a rest and a
bite, and give me your tale."</p>

<p>A warily eaten meal with another sup of wine and water made me a
new man. We sat below a long while, I telling my story, he making
notes and talking of the credit he would get for bringing home a
report of a new country, when suddenly the mate put his head into the
skylight.</p>

<p>"Captain!"</p>

<p>"Hullo!"</p>

<p>"The islands gone, sir."</p>

<p>"What d'you mean? that we've sunk it?"</p>

<p>"No, by the lord; but that it's sunk itself."</p>

<p>We ran on deck, and where the island should have been was all
clear sea.</p>

<p>The captain stared at the water, with his mouth wide open.</p>

<p>"Nothing to report after all!" he cried</p>

<p>"I saw it founder!" exclaimed the mate. "I had my eye on it when
it sank. I've seen some founderings in my day; but this beats all my
going a-fishing!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the captain to me, "we didn't come too soon,
sir."</p>

<p>I hid my face in my hands.</p>

<p>The Susan Gray was the name of the brig that rescued me. The
Hercules saw the first of the island, and the Susan Gray the last of
it. Hence, as I said at the start, it was reported by two vessels
only.</p>
