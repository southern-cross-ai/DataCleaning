<h1>The Informal Execution of Soupbone Pew</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<pre>
What is it the Good Book says? I read it last night&mdash;it said:
That he who sheddeth another man's blood by man shall his blood be shed!
That's as fair as a man could ask it, who lives by the gun and
knife&mdash;But the Law don't give him an even break when it's taking away his life.

Ho, the Law's unfair when it uses a chair, and a jolt from an unseen Death;
Or it makes him flop to a six-foot drop and a rope shuts off his breath;
If he's got to die let him die by the Book, with a Death that he can see.
By a gun or knife, as he went through life, and both legs kicking free!&mdash;Songs
of the "Shut-Ins"
</pre>

<p>The condemned man in the cell next to us laughed incessantly. He
had been sentenced that morning, and they told us he had started
laughing as soon as the words, "May the Lord have mercy on your
soul," were pronounced. He was to be taken to the penitentiary next
day to await execution.</p>

<p>Chicago Red had manifested a lively interest in the case. The man
had killed a railroad brakeman, so one of the guards told us; had
killed him coldly, and without provocation. The trial had commenced
since our arrival at the county jail and had lasted three days,
during which time Red talked of little else.</p>

<p>From the barred windows of the jail corridor, when we were
exercising, we could see the dingy old criminal court across the yard
and Red watched the grim procession to and from the jail each day. He
speculated on the progress of the trial; he knew when the case went
to the jury, and when he saw the twelve men, headed by the two old
bailiffs returning after lunch the third day, he announced:</p>

<p>"They've got the verdict, and it's first degree murder. They ain't
talking and not a one has even grinned."</p>

<p>Then when the unfortunate was brought back, laughing that dismal
laugh, Red said:</p>

<p>"He's nutty. He was nutty to go. It ain't exactly right to swing
that guy."</p>

<p>Red and I were held as suspects in connection with an affair which
had been committed a full forty-eight hours before we landed in
town. We had no particular fear of being implicated in the matter,
and the officers had no idea that we had anything to do with it, but
they were holding us as evidence to the public that they were working
on the case. We had been "vagged" for ten days each.</p>

<p>It was no new experience for us in any respect&mdash;not even the
condemned man, for we had frequently been under the same roof with
men sentenced to die. The only unusual feature was Red's interest in
the laughing man.</p>

<p>"Red," I asked, as we sat playing cards, "did you ever kill a
man?"</p>

<p>He dropped a card calmly, taking the trick, and as he contemplated
his hand, considering his next lead, he answered:</p>

<p>"For why do you ask me that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; I just wondered," I said. "You've seen and done
so many things that I thought you might accidentally have met with
something of the sort." "It isn't exactly a polite question," he
replied. "I've seen some murders. I've seen quite a few, in fact.
I've seen some pulled off in a chief's private office, when they was
sweating some poor stiff; and I've seen some, other places."</p>

<p>"Did you ever kill a man?" I insisted.</p>

<p>He studied my lead carefully.</p>

<p>"I never did," he finally answered. "That is to say, I never
bumped no guy off personal. I never had nothing to do with no job
from which come ghosts to wake me up at night and bawl me out."</p>

<p>"They say a guy what kills a man never closes his eyes again, even
when he really sleeps. I go to the hay, and my eyes are shut tight,
so I know I ain't to be held now or hereafter for nothing like
that."</p>

<p>We finished the game in silence, and Red seemed very thoughtful.
He laid the cards aside, rolled a cigarette, and said; "Listen! I
never killed no guy personal, like I say; I mean for nothing he done
to me. I've been a gun and crook for many years, like you know, but
I'm always mighty careful about hurting anyone permanent. I'm careful
about them pete jobs, so's not to blow up no harmless persons, and I
always tell my outside men that, when they have to do shooting, not
to try to hit anyone. If they did, accidental, that ain't my fault.
One reason I took to inside work was to keep from having to kill
anyone. I've been so close to being taken that I could hear the gates
of the Big House slam, and one little shot would have saved me a lot
of trouble, but I always did my best to keep from letting that shot
go. I never wanted to kill no man. I've been in jams where guys were
after me good and strong, and I always tried to get by without no
killings.</p>

<p>"I said I never killed a guy. I helped once, but it wasn't murder.
It's never worried me a bit since, and I sleep good."</p>

<p>He walked to the window and peered out into the yard where a bunch
of sparrows were fluttering about. Finally he turned and said:</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that for quite a while, and I never do until
I see some poor stiff that's been tagged to go away. Some of them
make me nervous&mdash;especially this tee-hee guy next to us. I'll tell
you about Soupbone Pew&mdash;some day you can write it, if you want
to."</p>

<p>Soupbone Pew was a rat who trained years ago with Billy Coulon,
the Honey Grove Kid, and a bunch of other old-timers that you've
never seen. It was before my time, too, but I've heard them talk
about him. He was in the Sioux City bank tear-off, when they all got
grabbed and were sent to the Big House for fifteen years each. In
them days Soupbone was a pretty good guy. He had nerve, and was
smart, and stood well with everybody, but a little stretch in the big
stir got to him.</p>

<p>He broke bad. Honey Grove laid a plan for a big spring&mdash;a
get-away&mdash;while they were up yonder. It looked like it would go
through, too, but just as they were about ready, Soupbone got cold
feet and gave up his insides.</p>

<p>For that he got a pardon, and quit the road right off. He became a
railroad brakeman, and showed up as a shack running between Dodge
City and La Junta. And he became the orneriest white man that God
ever let live, too.</p>

<p>To hoboes and guns he was like a reformed soak toward a drunk He
treated them something fierce. He was a big, powerful stiff, who
could kill a man with a wallop of his hands, if he hit him right, and
his temper soured on the world. Most likely it was because he was
afraid that every guy on the road was out to get him because of what
he'd done, or maybe it was because he knew that they knew he was
yellow. Anyway, they never tried to do him, that job belonging to
Coulon, Honey Grove and the others..Soupbone cracked that no 'bo
could ride his division, and he made it good, too. He beat them up
when they tried it, and he made it so strong that the old heads
wouldn't go against a try when he was the run. Once in a while some
kid took a stab at it, but if he got caught by Soupbone he regretted
it the rest of his life. I've heard of that little road into Hot
Springs, where they say a reward used to be offered to any 'bo that
rode it, and how a guy beat it by getting in the water-tank; and
I've personally met that Wyoming gent on the Union Pacific, and all
them other guys they say is so tough, but them stories is only
fairy-tales for children beside what could be told about Pew. He
went an awful route.</p>

<p>I've known of him catching guys in the pilot and throwing scalding
water in on them; I've heard tell of him shoveling hot cinders into
empties on poor bums laying there asleep. That trick of dropping a
coupling-pin on the end of a wire down alongside a moving train, so
that it would swing up underneath and knock a stiff off the rods, was
about the mildest thing he did.</p>

<p>He was simply a devil. The other railroad men on the division
wouldn't hardly speak to him.</p>

<p>They couldn't stand his gaff, but they couldn't very well roar at
him keeping 'boes off his trains because that was what he was there
for.</p>

<p>His longest suit was beating guys up. He just loved to catch some
poor old broken-down bum on his train and pound the everlasting
stuffing out of him. He's sent many a guy to the hospital, and maybe
he killed a few before my acquaintance with him, for all I know.</p>

<p>Once in a while he ran against some live one&mdash;some real gun, and
not a bum&mdash;who'd given him a battle, but he was there forty ways with
a sap and gat, and he'd shoot as quick as he'd slug.</p>

<p>He didn't go so strong on the real guns, if he knew who they was,
and I guess he was always afraid they might be friends of Honey Grove
or Coulon.</p>

<p>He was on the run when I first heard of him, and some of the kids
of my day would try to pot him from the road, when his train went by,
but they never even come close. I've heard them talking of pulling a
rail on him and letting his train go into the ditch, but that would
have killed the other trainmen, and they was some good guys on that
same run then. The best way to do was to fight shy of Soupbone, and
keep him on ice for Honey Grove and Coulon.</p>

<p>Training with our mob in them days was a young kid called
Manchester Slim&mdash;a real kid, not over eighteen, and as nice and quiet
a youngster as I ever see. He wasn't cut out for the road. It seems
he'd had some trouble at home and run away. Old man Muller, that
Dutch prowler, used to have him on his staff, but he never let this
kid in on any work for some reason. He was always trying to get Slim
to go home.</p>

<p>"Der road is hell for der kits," he used to say. "Let der ole
stiffs vork out dere string, und don't make no new vuns."</p>

<p>The Slim paid no attention to him. Still he had no great love for
the life, and probably would have quit long before if he hadn't been
afraid some one would think he was scared off.</p>

<p>They was a pete job on at La Junta, which me and 'Frisco Shine and
Muller had laid out. We had jungled up&mdash;camped&mdash;in a little
cottonwood grove a few miles out of town, and was boiling out
soup&mdash;nitro-glycerine&mdash;from dynamite, you know&mdash;and Muller sent the
Slim into town to look around a bit. It was winter and pretty cold.
We had all come in from the West and was headed East. We was all
broke bad, too, and needed dough the worst way.</p>

<p>Slim come back from town much excited. He was carrying a Denver
newspaper in his hand.</p>

<p>"I've got to go home, Mull," he said, running up to the old man
and holding out the paper.</p>

<p>"Look at this ad."</p>

<p>Muller read it and called to me. He showed me a little want ad
reading that Gordon Keleher, who disappeared from his home in Boston
two years before, was wanted at home because his mother was dying. It
was signed Pelias Keleher, and I knew who he was, all
right&mdash;president of the National Bankers' Association.</p>

<p>"Well, you go," I said, right off the reel, and I could see that
was the word he was waiting for.</p>

<p>"For certainly he goes," said Muller. "Nail der next rattler."</p>

<p>"All the passengers are late, but there's a freight due out of
here tonight; I asked," said Slim.</p>

<p>"How much dough iss dere in dis mob?" demanded Muller, frisking
himself. We all shook ourselves down, but the most we could scare up
was three or four dollars.</p>

<p>"If you could wait until after tonight," I says, thinking of the
job, but Muller broke me off with:</p>

<p>"Ve don't vant him to vait. Somedings might happens."</p>

<p>"I'd wire home for money, but I want to get to Kansas City first,"
said Slim. "That paper is a couple of days old, and there's no
telling how long it may have been running that ad. I can stop over in
K.C. long enough to get plenty of dough from some people I know
there. I'm going to grab that freight."</p>

<p>"Soupbone on dat freight," said the 'Frisco Shine, a silent,
wicked black.</p>

<p>"Ve'll see Soub," said Muller quietly. "I guess maybe he von't
inderfere mit dis case."</p>

<p>We decided to abandon the job for the night, and all went uptown.
The Slim was apparently very much worried, and he kept telling us
that if he didn't get home in time he'd never forgive himself, so we
all got dead-set on seeing him started.</p>

<p>We looked up the conductor of the freight due out that night and
explained things to him. None of us knew him, but he was a nice
fellow.</p>

<p>"I tell you, boys," he said, "I'd let the young fellow ride, but
you'd better see my head brakeman, Soupbone Pew. He's a tough
customer, but in a case like this he ought to be all right."</p>

<p>"I'll speak to him myself."</p>

<p>Muller went after Pew. He found him in a saloon, drinking all by
his lonesome, although there was a crowd of other railroad men in
there at the time. Muller knew Pew in the old days, but there was no
sign of recognition between them. The old Dutchman explained to Pew
very briefly.</p>

<p>"It vould pe a greed personal favor mit me, Soub; maype somedimes
I return it."</p>

<p>"He can't ride my train!" said Pew shortly. "That's flat. No
argument goes."</p>

<p>The Dutchman looked at him long and earnestly, murder showing in
his eyes, and Pew slunk back close to the bar, and his hand dropped
to his hip.</p>

<p>"Soub, der poy rides!" said Muller, his voice low but shaking with
anger. "He rides your rattler. Und if anyding happens by dot poy, de
Honey Grove Kit von't get no chance at you! Dot's all, Soub!"</p>

<p>But when he returned to us, he was plainly afraid for the
Slim.</p>

<p>"You don't bedder go to-nid," he said. "Dot Soub is a defil, und
he'll do you."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," said Slim. "He can't find me, anyhow."</p>

<p>The old man tried to talk him out of the idea, but Slim was
determined, and finally Muller, in admiration of his spirit,
said:</p>

<p>"Vell, if you vill go, you vill. Vun man can hide besser as two,
but der Shine must go mit you as far as Dodge."</p>

<p>That was the only arrangement he would consent to, and while the
Slim didn't want the Shine, and I myself couldn't see what good he
could do, Muller insisted so strong that we all gave in..We went down
to the yards that night to see them off, and the old man had a
private confab with the Shine. The only time I ever saw Muller show
any feeling was when he told the boy goodby. I guess he really liked
him.</p>

<p>The two hid back of a pile of ties, a place where the trains
slowed down, and me and Muller got off a distance and watched them.
We could see Soupbone standing on top of a box-car as the train went
by, and he looked like a tall devil. He was trying to watch both
sides of the train at the same time, but I didn't think he saw either
Slim or the Shine as they shot underneath the cars, one after the
other, and nailed the rods. Then the tram went off into the darkness,
Soupbone standing up straight and stiff.</p>

<p>We went back to our camp to sleep, and the next morning before we
were awake, the Shine came limping in, covered with blood and one arm
hanging at his side.</p>

<p>I didn't have to hear his story to guess what had happened.
Soupbone made them at the first stop. He hadn't expected two, but he
did look for the kid. Instead of warning him off, he told him to get
on top where he'd be safe. That was one of his old tricks. He didn't
get to the Shine, who dodged off into the darkness, as soon as he
found they were grabbed, and then caught the train after it started
again. He crawled up between the cars to the deck, to tip the Slim
off to watch out for Soupbone. Slim didn't suspect anything, and was
thanking Soupbone, and explaining about his mother.</p>

<p>The moment the train got under way good, Soupbone says:</p>

<p>"Now my pretty boy, you're such a&mdash;good traveler, let's see you
jump off this train!"</p>

<p>The kid thought he was joshing, but there wasn't no josh about it.
Soup pulled a gun. The Shine, with his own gun in hand, crawled clear
on top and lay flat on the cars, trying to steady his aim on
Soupbone. The kid was pleading and almost crying, when Soupbone
suddenly jumped at him, smashed him in the jaw with the gun-barrel,
and knocked him off the train. The Shine shot Soupbone in the back,
and he dropped on top of the train, but didn't roll off. As the Shine
was going down between the cars again, Souphone shot at him and broke
his arm. He got off all right, and went back down the road to find
the kid dead&mdash;his neck broke.</p>

<p>Old man Muller, the mildest man in the world generally, almost
went bug-house when he heard that spiel. He raved and tore around
like a sure enough nut. I've known him to go backing out of a town
with every man in his mob down on the ground, dead or dying, and not
show half as much feeling afterward. You'd 'a' thought the kid was
his own. He swore he'd do nothing else as long as he lived until he'd
cut Soupbone's heart out.</p>

<p>The Shine had to get out of sight, because Soupbone would
undoubtedly have some wild-eyed story to tell about being attacked
by hoboes and being shot by one. We had no hope but what the Shine
had killed him.</p>

<p>Old man Muller went into town and found out that was just what had
happened, and he was in the hospital only hurt a little. He also
found they'd brought Slim's body to town, and that most people
suspected the real truth, too. He told them just how it was,
especially the railroad men, and said the Shine had got out of the
country. He also wired Slim's people, and we heard afterward they
sent a special train after the remains.</p>

<p>Muller was told, too, that the train conductor had notified Pew to
let Slim ride, and that the rest of the train-crew had served notice
on Pew that if he threw the boy off he'd settle with them for it. And
that was just what made Soupbone anxious to get the kid. It ended his
railroad career there, as we found out afterwards, because he
disappeared as soon as he got out of the hospital.</p>

<p>Meantime me and Muller and the Shine went ahead with that job, and
it failed. Muller and the nigger got grabbed, and I had a tough time
getting away. Just before we broke camp the night before, however,
Muller, who seemed to have a hunch that something was going to
happen, called me and the Shine to him, and said, his voice
solemn:</p>

<p>"I vant you poys to bromise me vun ting," he said. "If I don't get
der chance myself, bromise me dot venefer you find Soubbone Bew, you
vill kill him deat."</p>

<p>And we promised, because we didn't think we would ever be called
on to make good.</p>

<p>Muller got a long jolt for the job; the Shine got a shorter one
and escaped a little bit later on, while I left that part of the
country.</p>

<p>A couple of years later, on a bitter cold night, in a certain town
that I won't name, there was five of us in the sneezer, held as
suspects on a house prowl job that only one of us had anything to do
with&mdash;I ain't mentioning the name of the one, either. They was me,
Kid Mole, the old prize-fighter, a hophead named Squirt McCue, that
you don't know, Jew Friend, a dip, and that same 'Frisco Shine. We
were all in the bull-pen with a mixed assortment of drunks and vags.
All kinds of prisoners was put in there over night. This pokey is
down-stairs under the police station, not a million miles from the
Missouri River, so if you think hard you can guess the place. We were
walking around kidding the drunks, when a screw shoved in a long,
tall guy who acted like he was drunk or nutty, and was hardly able to
stand.</p>

<p>I took one flash at his map, and I knew him. It was Pew.</p>

<p>He flopped down in a corner as soon as the screw let go his arm.
The Shine rapped to him as quick as I did, and officed Mole and the
rest. They all knew of him, especially the Honey Grove business, as
well as about the Manchester Slim, for word had gone over the country
at the time.</p>

<p>As soon as the screw went up-stairs I walked over to the big
stiff, laying all huddled up, and poked him with my foot.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, you big cheese?" I said. He only
mumbled.</p>

<p>"Stand up!" I tells him, but he didn't stir. The Shine and Mole
got hold of him on either side and lifted him to his feet. He was as
limber as a wet bar-towel. Just then we heard the screw coming
down-stairs and we got away from Pew. The screw brought in a jag&mdash;a
laughing jag&mdash;a guy with his snoot full of booze and who laughed like
he'd just found a lot of money. He was a little, thin fellow, two
pounds lighter than a straw hat. He laughed high and shrill, more
like a scream than a real laugh, and the moment the screw opened the
door and tossed him in, something struck me that the laugh was
phoney. It didn't sound on the level.</p>

<p>There wasn't no glad in it. The little guy laid on the floor and
kicked his feet and kept on laughing. Soupbone Pew let out a yell at
the sight of him.</p>

<p>"Don't let him touch me!" he bawled, rolling over against the
wall. "Don't let him near me!"</p>

<p>"Why, you big stiff, you could eat him alive!" I says.</p>

<p>The jag kept on tee-heeing, not looking at us, or at Pew either
for that matter.</p>

<p>"He's nuts," said Jew Friend.</p>

<p>"Shut him off," I told the Shine.</p>

<p>He stepped over and picked the jag up with one hand, held him out
at arm's length, and walloped him on the jaw with his other hand. The
jag went to sleep with a laugh sticking in his throat. Soupbone still
lay against the wall moaning, but he saw that business all right, and
it seemed to help him. The Shine tossed the jag into a cell. Right
after that the screw came down with another drunk, and I asked him
about Pew.</p>

<p>"Who's this boob?" I said. "Is he sick?"</p>

<p>"Him? Oh, he's a good one," said screw. "He only killed his poor
wife&mdash;beat her to death with his two fists, because she didn't have
supper ready on time, or something important. That ain't his blood on
him; that's hers. He's pretty weak, now, hey? Well, he wasn't so weak
a couple of hours ago, the rat! It's the wickedest murder ever done
in this town, and he'll hang sure, if he ain't lynched
beforehand!"</p>

<p>He gave Soupbone a kick as he went out, and Soupbone groaned.</p>

<p>Said I: "It's got to be done, gents; swing or no swing, this guy
has got to go. Who is it&mdash;me?"</p>

<p>"Me!" said the Shine, stepping forward.</p>

<p>"Me!" said the Jew.</p>

<p>"Me!" chimed in Mole.</p>

<p>"All of us!" said the hophead.</p>

<p>"Stand him up!" I ordered.</p>

<p>The lights had been turned down low, and it was dark and shadowy
in the jail. The only sound was the soft pad-pad of people passing
through the snow on the sidewalks above our heads, the low sizzling
of the water-spout at the sink, and the snores of the drunks, who
were all asleep.</p>

<p>Us five was the only ones awake. The Shine and Mole lifted
Soupbone up, and this time he was not so limp. He seemed to know that
something was doing. His eyes was wide open and staring at us.</p>

<p>"Pew," I said in a whisper, "do you remember the kid you threw off
your rattler three years ago?"</p>

<p>"And shot me in the arm?" asked Shine.</p>

<p>Pew couldn't turn any whiter, but his eyes rolled back into his
head.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he whispered. "Don't say that. It made me crazy! I'm
crazy now! I was crazy when I killed that little girl tonight. It was
all on account of thinking about him. He comes to see me often."</p>

<p>"Well, Pew," I said, "a long time back you were elected to die. I
was there when the sentence was passed, and it'd been carried out a
long time ago if you hadn't got away. I guess we'll have to kill you
tonight."</p>

<p>"Don't, boys!" he whined. "I ain't fit to die! Don't hurt me!"</p>

<p>"Why, you'll swing anyway!" said Friend.</p>

<p>"No! My God, no!" he said. "I was crazy; I'm crazy now, and they
don't hang crazy people!"</p>

<p>I was standing square in front of him. His head had raised a
little as he talked and his jaw was sticking out. I suddenly made a
move with my left hand, as though to slap him, and he showed that his
mind was active enough by dodging, so that it brought his jaw out
further, and he said, "Don't." Then I pulled my right clear from my
knee and took him on the point of the jaw. The Shine and Mole jumped
back. Soupbone didn't fall; he just slid down in a heap, like his
body had melted into his shoes.</p>

<p>We all jumped for him at the same time, but an idea popped into my
head, and I stopped them.</p>

<p>Soupbone was knocked out, but he was coming back fast. You can't
kill a guy like that by hitting him. The jail was lighted by a few
incandescent lights, and one of them was hung on a wire that reached
down from the ceiling over the sink, and had a couple of feet of it
coiled up in the middle. Uncoiled, the light would reach clear to the
floor. I pointed to it, but the bunch didn't get my idea right away.
The switch for the lights was inside the bull-pen, and I turned them
off. I had to work fast for fear the screw upstairs would notice the
lights was out and come down to see what the trouble was. A big arc
outside threw a little glim through the sidewalk grating, so I could
see what I was doing.</p>

<p>I uncoiled the wire and sawed it against the edge of the sink,
close to the lamp, until it came in two. Then I bared the wire back
for a foot. The gang tumbled, and carried Pew over to where the wire
would reach him. I unfastened his collar, looped the naked end of the
wire around his neck and secured it. By this time he was about come
to, but he didn't seem to realize what was going on.</p>

<p>All but me got into their cells and I stepped over and turned the
switch-button just as Pew was struggling to his feet. The voltage
hit him when he was on all fours. He stood straight up, stiff, like a
soldier at salute. There was a strange look on his face&mdash;a surprised
look. Then, as though someone had hit him from behind, his feet left
the floor and he swung straight out to the length of the wire and it
broke against his weight, just as I snapped off the current. Pew
dropped to the floor and curled up like a big singed spider, and a
smell like frying bacon filled the room.</p>

<p>I went over and felt of his heart. It was still beating, but very
light.</p>

<p>"They ain't enough current," whispered Mole. "We got to do it some
other way."</p>

<p>"Hang him wid de wire," said the Shine.</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;nix!" spoke up the Jew. "I tell you that makes me
sick&mdash;bumping a guy off that way. Hanging and electricity, see?
That's combining them too much. Let's use the boot."</p>

<p>"It ain't fair, kind&mdash;and that's a fact," whispered McCue. "It's a
little too legal. The boot! Give him the boot!"</p>

<p>The voice of the screw came singing down the stairs:</p>

<p>"Is that big guy awake?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I shouted back, "we're all awake; he won't let us
sleep."</p>

<p>"Tell him he'd better say his prayers!" yelled the screw. "I just
got word a mob is forming to come and get him!"</p>

<p>"Let him alone," I whispered to the gang. Mole was making a noose
of the wire, and the Shine had hunted up a bucket to stand Pew on.
They drew back and Soupbone lay stretched out on the floor.</p>

<p>I went over and felt of his heart again. I don't remember whether
I felt any beat or not. I couldn't have said I did, at the moment,
and I couldn't say I didn't. I didn't have time to make sure, because
suddenly there run across the floor something that looked to me like
a shadow, or a big rat. Then the shrill laugh of that jag rattled
through the bull-pen. He slid along half-stooped, as quick as a
streak of light, and before we knew what was doing he had pounced on
Soupbone and had fastened his hands tight around the neck of the big
stiff. He was laughing that crazy laugh all the time.</p>

<p>"I'll finish him for you!" he squeaked. He fastened his hands
around Soupbone's neck. I kicked the jag in the side of the head as
hard as I could, but it didn't faze him. The bunch laid hold of him
and pulled, but they only dragged Soupbone all over the place.
Finally the jag let go and stood up, and we could see he wasn't no
more drunk than we was. He let loose that laugh once more, and just
as the Shine started the bucket swinging for his head, he said: "I'm
her brother!" Then he went down kicking.</p>

<p>We went into our cells and crawled into our bunks. Soupbone lay
outside. The Shine pulled the jag into a corner. I tell you true, I
went to sleep right away. I thought the screw would find out when he
brought the next drunk down, but it so happened that there wasn't no
more drunks and I was woke up by a big noise on the stairs.
The door flew open with a bang, and a gang of guys came down,
wild-eyed and yelling. The screw was with them and they had tight
hold of him.</p>

<p>"Keep in, you men!" he bawled to us..."That's your meat!" he said
to the gang, pointing at what had been Soupbone. The men pounced on
him like a lot of hounds on to a rabbit, and before you could bat an
eye they had a rope around Soupbone's neck and was tearing up the
stairs again, dragging him along.</p>

<p>They must have thought he was asleep; they never noticed that he
didn't move a muscle himself, and they took the person of Soupbone
Pew, or anyways what had been him, outside and hung it over a
telegraph wire.</p>

<p>We saw it there when we was sprung next morning. When the screw
noticed the blood around the bull-pen, he said:</p>

<p>"Holy smoke, they handled him rough!" And he never knew no
different.</p>

<p>If the mob hadn't come&mdash;but the mob did come, and so did the
laughing jag. I left him that morning watching the remains of
Soupbone Pew.</p>

<p>"She was my sister," he said to me.</p>

<p>I don't know for certain whether we killed Soupbone, whether the
jag did it, or whether the mob finished him; but he was dead, and he
ought to have died. Sometimes I wonder a bit about it, but no ghosts
come to me, like I say, so I can't tell.</p>

<p>They's an unmarked grave in the potter's field of this town I
speak of, and once in a while I go there when I'm passing through and
meditate on the sins of Soupbone Pew. But I sleep well of nights. I
done what had to be done, and I close my eyes and I don't never see
Soupbone Pew.</p>

<p>He turned once more to gazing out of the window.</p>

<p>"Well, what is there about condemned men to make you so nervous?"
I demanded.</p>

<p>"I said some condemned men," he replied, still gazing. "Like this
guy next door."</p>

<p>A loud, shrill laugh rang through the corridors.</p>

<p>"He's that same laughing jag," said Chicago Red.</p>
