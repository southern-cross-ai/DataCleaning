<h3><a name="s1"></a>AN APOLOGUE</h3>

<p>There was a pause in the game. Spades were trumps, and the two
Besique Knaves were lying on the table side by side. The Professor
held sequence cards almost entirely, and it required careful play on
the part of his adversary to prevent his getting both the sequence
and the double besique. Therefore there was a pause in the game.</p>

<p>The King of Diamonds and the King of Clubs were lying side by
side, and began to talk. The King of Clubs was a stupid king. He
always said the same thing over again. No matter what excellent
reasons you gave him, nor how clearly you showed him what foolish
remarks he made, he always repeated the last words he had said. This
was, no doubt, very stupid; but it gave him a great advantage in
argument.</p>

<p>The King of Diamonds, on the contrary, was very clever. His
intellect was of so rare a quality, and of so hard and fine a temper,
and had been so carefully and sharply cut and elaborated into
crystals, that it was enabled to pierce further into a millstone than
that of any other card--yes, even that of the cleverest of the
Knaves, for the intellect of these latter is always spoilt by a sort
of worldly cunning, and a too great reference to the gains and
advantages of present good.</p>

<p>'I tell you,' said the King of Clubs, in a loud and positive
voice, 'that it is all chance. In an affair in which I was lately
engaged, and in which my suite were trumps, there were with me the
two Aces, my brother, the King of Clubs, my own consort, the two
Tens, and one of the Knaves. Now, I ask you, what could any skill
effect against such a force as this?'</p>

<p>As this was the ninth time the king had related this anecdote in
precisely the same words, the King of Diamonds began to feel the
conversation a bore, and if his perfect culture would have permitted
such a thing, he would have felt irritated, which, of course, he
never did. He therefore replied with extreme politeness, in a soft
and melodious voice--</p>

<p>'The force of your reasoning, my dear Clubs, and the interesting
anecdote you have just related, admit of no reply. I see clearly that
everything is the result of chance, and I also see, I think clearly,
that: chance forms itself under certain contingencies into a sort of
system by which unexpected results are obtained. Thus, I have often
noticed that when everything seemed clear before us, and the game our
own, in the most unexpected way everything is changed; instead of
lying peaceably on our own side of the table, we are transferred to
the enemy's camp. The play of one particular card appears to have
subverted the most formidable combinations, and conclusions which I
fancied certain dissolve into air.'</p>

<p>The King of Clubs did not understand a word of all this, but, as
his companion appeared to be agreeing with what he himself had
stated, he did not think it worth while to relate his anecdote over
again, and remained silent.</p>

<p>'I think it must be plain to every one,' continued the King of
Diamonds, still with extreme politeness, 'even to the most stupid,
that we are governed by a higher intellect than our own; that as the
cards fall from the pack, in what you so forcibly describe as chance
medley merely, they are immediately subjected to analysis and
arrangement, by which the utmost possible value is extracted from
these chance contingencies, and that not unfrequently the results
which chance itself seemed to predict are reversed. This analysis and
arrangement, and these results, we cards have learnt to call
intellect (or mind), and to attribute it to an order of beings
superior to ourselves, by whom our destinies are controlled. These
truths are taught in our Sunday schools, and will, I think, scarcely
be denied. But what I wish to call your attention to, is a more
abstruse conception which I myself have obtained with difficulty, but
which your more robust--that is the term, I think, you Liberals
use--intellect will, I doubt not, readily grasp. It has occurred to
me that even the fall of the cards is the result merely of more
remote contingencies, and is resolvable into laws and systems similar
to those to which they are afterwards subjected. I was led at first
to form this conception by an oracular voice which I once heard,
whether in trance or vision I cannot say. The words I heard were
somewhat like these:-</p>

<p>'"If we could sufficiently extend our insight we should see that
every apparently chance contingency is but the result of previous
combinations: that all existence is but the result of previous
existence, and that chance is lost in law. But side by side with this
truth exists another of more stupendous import, that, just as far as
this truth is recognised and perceived, just so far, step by step,
springs into existence a power by which law is abrogated, and the
apparent course of its iron necessity is changed. To these senseless
cards" (whom the voice here alluded to I fail to see)--"to these
senseless cards, doubtless, the game appears nothing but an
undeviating law of fate. We know that we possess a power by which the
fall of the cards is systematised and controlled. To a higher
intelligence than ours, doubtless, combinations which seem to us
inscrutable are as easily analysed and controlled. In proportion as
intellect advances we know this to be the case, and these two would
seem to run back side by side into the Infinite Law, and Intellect
which perceives Law, until we arrive at the final problem, whether
Law is the result of intellect, or intellect of Law." These were the
remarkable words I heard.'</p>

<p>I do not understand a word you have said,' replied the King of
Clubs. 'I remember in an affair in which I was engaged--'</p>

<p>Here the King of Spades suddenly came down upon the table at his
brother monarch's side, and the game was played out.</p>

<p>When the game was over, and the other player was gone, the
Professor's little daughter came to the table, and began to play with
the cards.</p>

<p>'Why does the Herr Councillor, who is so rich, come and play with
you, papa?' she said.</p>

<p>'We were boys together, and he likes to come and hear me talk; for
while he has been growing rich and great, I have been thinking, which
he has no time to do.'</p>

<p>The Professor would not have said this to any one else, but it was
only his little daughter, and there was no reason why he should not
say what was in his mind.</p>

<p>'Why did you not ask God to make you rich and great?' said the
little girl.</p>

<p>'I asked the All-father,' said the Professor, looking very kindly
at the child, 'to give me all that was good, and He has given me
everything, even a little girl.'</p>

<p>The child was taking all the royal cards in her hands and placing
them side by side upon the table, so that she made a pretty picture,
bright with colours and gay forms; but one card was wanting, so that
the royal dance-figure was not perfect, and one place was vacant.</p>

<p>A card was lying on the floor with its back uppermost.</p>

<p>'Pick me up that card, papa,' said the Professor's little
daughter. 'It is a king.'</p>

<p>The Professor stooped down and picked up the card. It was a paltry
seven of hearts.</p>

<p>Now the father could not complete the picture for his child, for
the wise King of Diamonds had fallen by misadventure into the large
pocket of the rich councillor's embroidered coat, and was gone.</p>

<h2><a name="s2"></a>ELLIE; A STORY OF A BOY AND GIRL.</h2>

<p>When I came home from Eton one vacation, I found a new inmate at
Abbot's Calvert: one whom at first I was very much surprised at, and
afterwards very much delighted with. This was a little girl, of about
fifteen, the daughter of a very distant cousin of my father's, who,
having lived a life of privation, partly, I believe, caused by errors
of his own, had died prematurely, without either choosing or being
able, I do not know which, to interest his noble relatives in his
behalf. When he died, and his little daughter was left alone and
helpless in the world, my mother had caused inquiries to be made
about her, which resulted in her being sent for into the country. The
moment she arrived at Abbot's Calvert it was plain that she was
permanently established there. It was impossible for any creature to
be with her for five minutes without loving her. My mother, who had
no daughters of her own, adopted her altogether as one; and the
Marquis himself, who rarely spoke to any one except my mother and his
eldest son, condescended to pet her. She was even then a remarkably
graceful girl, tall, and giving great promise of that extraordinary
loveliness which two years afterwards she possessed. It was not
astonishing, then, that I, a boy of seventeen, used to ladies'
society and fond of it, fell desperately in love (with the
desperation of seventeen) with this charming little creature; or, on
the other hand, that she, transferred from the narrow poverty of her
father's life to a stately old mansion with 'parks and ordered
gardens great,' with ponies to ride, and boats upon the river, with
carriage drives, and picnics, was very happy, and thought a good deal
of her young companion, who, whenever he arrived, took the greatest
trouble and felt the greatest pleasure in pleasing her. In spite of
all these pleasures, it was rather dull most of the year at Abbot's
Calvert, for my mother did not take Ellie to London, but left her
nominally in the schoolroom, under the care of her governess, a lady
recommended by the single but invaluable characteristic of never
being in the way. It was not astonishing, then, that in this new life
of hers the girl was very happy, or that she was very fond of
'Fred.'</p>

<p>'Fred' is very different now, so it is not conceited to say that I
was then a good specimen of an English lad, such as you may see
scores of in the public schools, with well cut features, and auburn
hair, tall, but not too tall, well built, active, holding my place in
all games, used to society, just bashful enough to be well mannered,
and no more. If I am to tell my story at all, I must be allowed to
say thus much, so that it may be understood.</p>

<p>I do not want it to be a long story, so it will be enough to say
things went on in this way for two years, till I left Eton finally in
June, and came down home for the vacation, looking forward to going
up to Cambridge to Trinity at the beginning of the term. I had not
seen Ellie for nearly six months, for I had not been in the country
at Easter, 'having spent the holidays in London. It was my brother
Lord Canham's first session in Parliament, and the family had been in
London longer than usual. When I got into the hail, then, and found
her there waiting for me, I scarcely knew her, such a perfectly
lovely creature had she grown. She was standing beneath the picture
of the last Abbot, with the sunlight falling on her coloured by the
old armorial bearings of the Abbey which still remain in the windows
(for the Calverts had been tenants of the old monks for centuries,
and have always preserved a kindly feeling towards their memory, as
indeed was not unreasonable, seeing that they had come in for by far
the largest part of their lands). She was tall, and very slightly
formed, her features and complexion perfectly faultless, her eyes
large and dreamy, what some people thought heavy and expressionless
(though they lighted up enough many times that I knew of), her hair
of the palest auburn, wavy all over and very abundant. I felt shy and
bashful for a moment, but, fortunately for myself, I crushed down
this feeling and kissed her, as I should have done a year ago.</p>

<p>That year's summer was a glorious one, day after day of lovely
skies, soft showers, warm quivering air, sultry 'all-golden'
afternoons, short wonderful nights, like dreams of day, full of
perfume, of cool zephyrs, of rustling voices in the trees. Parliament
sat late, and the house was almost deserted the most part of the
time; we were not without neighbours, and formed parties of pleasure
every few days, but these only served to point and intensify the zest
with which Ellie and I spent the intervening days alone. In the
gardens, on the croquet-lawn, on the river, riding or wandering in
the lanes, galloping over the grassy slopes of the Chase (I had
taught Ellie to ride myself, and she did my instruction the greatest
credit), driving a miniature basket phaeton into the neighbouring
town to the Cathedral service and to the shops, day after day of this
delightful summer flew by unheeded. I imagine, from the novels I have
read, that it will be thought by some people very wrong that we
should have been left together in this way, and that they will say
that it is highly improbable and absurd to suppose that my mother
should have permitted this intimacy to go on in so unchecked a way.
All I can say is, that these ideas never entered into any phase of
society with which I was acquainted; a perfect absence of any feeling
of the kind, of any approach to what I have seen described as a
restless meddling propensity to match-making, or to an equally
restless fear of it, characterised, or would have characterised, if
any one had ever thought of it, the people among whom I lived, and no
one more so than my mother. The Marquis and Marchioness were down for
a few days in the middle of summer, and Canham also for a week. I
know that my father spoke to Canham about us, but that he pooh-poohed
the whole affair, called Ellie a charming little thing, whom he had a
great mind to fall in love with himself, and that my father thought
no more, or little more about us. I do Canham the justice to say he
never did interfere with us, being wholly occupied with preparing a
speech on the tenant-right of Ireland, a subject about which he knew
nothing and cared less, only, as the family had large estates in that
island, it was thought well for him to make a speech, which, while
not embarrassing the Government, might rouse great enthusiasm in his
favour among the Irish: and this he found was quite sufficient to
occupy him while at Abbot's Calvert.</p>

<p>When I first came home in June Ellie had told me something which
had not affected us much at the time, when we had all the holidays
before us, but which, as time passed by, assumed a more formidable
appearance.</p>

<p>This was that my mother had decided that she should spend a year
at least at a ladies' school, of which great things had been told
her, in a little village in the northern counties, called Southam,
which boasted of a fine old minster or collegiate church, and aped in
all its arrangements a small cathedral city. Ellie did not object to
this arrangement. My father and mother were going to Italy at the end
of October, and the house would be very dull all the autumn. She
looked forward to this school life with expectation of amusement.</p>

<p>September arrived, and the day when Ellie was to leave was very
near, when my other, one morning at breakfast, expressed eat
annoyance at the illness of Allen, her favourite maid, who, she
informed us, had en selected as Ellie's escort.</p>

<p>'Who was to take Ellie now,' 'she said, she did not know?'</p>

<p>I struck in with the happy audacity of my age and class.</p>

<p>'It was absurd to talk in that way; who should take Ellie except
myself? I had never thought of anything else.'</p>

<p>My mother immediately acquiesced, with that outward indifference
with which she received most things, and with that unconscious and
undemonstrative but profound conviction, that everything that her
family did, or proposed to do, was right.</p>

<p>'Oh very well,' she said; 'if you think of doing so that will be
very nice; that will settle everything pleasantly. Ellie will be very
willing, no doubt.'</p>

<p>I looked across at Ellie; no one could have found fault with her
eyes for dulness at that moment.</p>

<p>'Yes, she was very willing.'</p>

<p>At this moment my father, who rarely took any notice of our
conversation, raised his eyes from his newspapers and letters, and
asked what we were talking of.</p>

<p>'Oh nothing,' my mother said, 'only Allen is so unwell that she
cannot take Ellie to school, and Fred very kindly says he will go
with her.'</p>

<p>'Hum,' said my father.</p>

<p>As he went out of the breakfast-room he told me to follow him into
the library, and seating himself in his favourite chair, in the great
oriel window, he turned to me with the air of a man who is saying a
good thing--'I have not the least objection, of course, sir, to your
making a fool of yourself; you will do so with great success,
doubtless, many times during the next few years, but you will please
to remember that a man of your name ought not to make a fool of any
one else.'</p>

<p>I had not the faintest idea what to say, so I said--</p>

<p>'Certainly not, my Lord.'</p>

<p>I very seldom called my father 'My Lord,' perhaps because he very
seldom spoke to me; but this seemed to be one of those rare occasions
when it was dramatically consistent, at least, to do so.</p>

<p>I went back into the morning-room, which was also the music room,
where Ellie was practising at the grand piano. I half lay on a couch
watching her, a ray of sunlight piercing the drawn blinds and
lighting up her hair, and beyond a Choir of Angels by Sabbatini that
hung over the piano.</p>

<p>Both my brother and myself had, when quite little boys, been
trained by my mother, who was a very clever woman, to watch our own
motives and feelings, and to look events as they occurred in the
face, and to trace, as far as we could, the succession of cause and
effect in them, relatively to ourselves; not very much, however, with
a view to arranging our own future, but as a matter of pure
philosophy. It was, therefore, impossible for me to act in any
circumstances perfectly thoughtlessly or without reflection; but, as
I lay watching Ellie, I was conscious that I was acting, and should
go on acting, under the influence of a sort of instinct, which told
me I was safe and right. Looking back on those days now, with no
possible motive for self-deception, I believe I was right; I believe
that, even had things happened very differently to what, alas! they
did, both Ellie and I were safe.</p>

<p>When the morning came for us to set out, we were driven down to
the cathedral town, and travelled to Southam by express.</p>

<p>'Look here,' I said to the guard, as we got into the carriage, 'I
will give you a sovereign at Southam if no one gets in here beside
ourselves.'</p>

<p>No one attempted to get into that compartment between Bishopstone
and Southam. We had a delightful and comfortable ride, wrapped up in
a corner of the carriage like the babes in the wood, and the only
fault we found with the journey was that it was too short.</p>

<p>At Southam we were expected, and found a fly waiting to take us up
to the school. We passed the grand old minster, with its Norman
towers, sleeping in the evening sunshine, and reached the school, a
pleasant country house surrounded with gardens, and fields planted
with rows of beeches, in which the rooks were cawing.</p>

<p>Ellie was taken away upstairs, and the servant, telling me that
some ladies were at tea with her mistress, suggested that I should
join them. I had sent in my card 'Lord Frederick Staines Calvert,' on
which I had added, rather patronisingly, 'Miss Elinor Calvert, for
Ellie had no cards. I entered a large pleasant room, where several
ladies and one or two clergymen were at tea at a long table. I fancy
they had expected an older and more imposing person from my card, for
they seemed uncertain as to who I was, as I came in, and no one rose
to welcome me.</p>

<p>A pretty and clever looking young lady, whom I took to be the
chief manager in the school, held out her hand to me without rising
as I came up the room, and, as I bowed over it, showed me a chair
which had been placed next to her. At the top of the table was a
severe looking old lady, to whom I was introduced, evidently the
mistress of the school; and just opposite me was a little pleasant
looking bright old lady, who took the greatest interest in
everything, and began to talk to me at once.</p>

<p>'We expected a much older gentleman from your card, Lord
Frederick,' she said, looking very sharply at me; 'Miss Calvert
cannot be your sister?'</p>

<p>'It is all the same,' I said; 'we have been brought up together.'
Which was a fib.</p>

<p>'You are a very good brother,' she said, still looking at me very
hard; 'I know many who would think it a great "bore," as they call
it, to bring their sisters to school.'</p>

<p>Her eyes were so sharp and full of meaning that I could not help
wincing, and am not even sure that I did not blush, especially as the
clever looking young lady by me seemed amused.</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and Ellie was shown in. She had
changed her dress, and was looking fresh and beautiful. I had never
before been so conscious of her really extraordinary loveliness, nor
so proud of it, as when I saw the effect it produced on these people
as she came up the room.</p>

<p>Room was made for her by the austere old lady herself, whose face
softened and quite beamed with kindness as she turned to her.</p>

<p>'We were just saying, my dear,' she said, 'how good it was of your
brother--cousin, I believe he is, but he says it is all the same--to
bring you here. That was before we saw you; we do not wonder at all
now that he was glad to do so.'</p>

<p>'No,' said the little old lady; 'I was going to ask you, Lord
Frederick, what you travelled down together for; I have no need to
ask anything of the kind now.'</p>

<p>We sat some time at tea, and talked pleasantly. The pretty young
lady was very intelligent and amusing. Canham's tenant-right speech
had after all turned out a very good one, and one of the clergymen
spoke to me about it. They were all quiet intelligent people, and I
enjoyed myself. After tea we went into a drawing room, which opened
into the room where we were, and stood about, still talking. Ellie
sat rather apart upon an ottoman. I went to her, and, sitting down by
her side, said mischievously, alluding to the cosy way in which we
had travelled--'What did we travel down together for, Ellie?'</p>

<p>She was shy and sad now, and could scarcely smile. I sat some time
by her, talking of what we should do at Christmas, and how pleasant
it would be, and she cheered up a little to remind me of a sort of
interlude I had promised to write, and to insist on my not forgetting
some little playful hit, which we had concocted against one of the
family. I was conscious that we were the object of great interest to
the people in the room. The clever young lady told me afterwards in
that very room (ah me, on what a different day!) that they had all
taken it as a settled thing--a match desired by the family.</p>

<p>At last I rose to go away. Ellie came out with me to the door. She
hung about my neck for a moment--one, two kisses--and then a third,
and she was taken upstairs, and I drove away, under the beech-trees,
where the rooks were gone to rest, and by the great old towers of the
minster, upon which the moon was just risen, as I looked back.</p>

<p>I went down to Ryde, to Canham, who had his yacht there. We
cruised about the Channel for a few days, and took part in a regatta,
and then he took me round the east coast to Cromer, and I came up to
Cambridge, and entered at Trinity at the beginning of the term.</p>

<p>The excitement of yachting, and of the new life at Trinity (and
especially the boating, into which I entered with great zest, having
been in the first boat at Eton), put Ellie almost entirely out of my
head, so that for many days I scarcely thought of her at all.</p>

<p>The splendid summer of that year was prolonged into a superb, but
moist and unhealthy, autumn, with a luxuriant vegetation, caused by
the sultry and showery summer, and causing, in its turn, fever, and
in some places cholera. Cambridge was lovely during day after day of
golden misty sunlight on the gorgeous foliage of the 'Backs.' Of
course I had many friends already among the Eton men, and had plenty
of company, but I did not altogether forget Ellie, and had even begun
to work upon the interlude for Christmas, having found a man who had
a taste for such things. But for two or three days our boating coach
had been working us very hard, and I think that I had scarcely
thought of Ellie once, when one evening I came down from my rooms
(which were on the staircase which turns up opposite the Hall,
looking into the Neville Court), and stood on the steps, looking down
into the great quadrangle, a little before Hall. A cloudless blue sky
was overhead, the sun was just setting on the quaint buildings, the
grass-plots, the fountain--on that beautiful court, in short, on
which, that he might look once more from his death-bed, a late master
made them draw up the blinds of his sick-room. The evening was close
and sultry, and the court was very quiet, though the men were all
standing about, waiting for Hall. As I stood upon the steps, some one
came across from the porter's lodge with a paper in his hand. It was
handed about among the men, 'Lord Frederick Calvert,' and with a joke
or two, was passed on to me. I see as plainly as I shall ever see
anything in life the scene before me, as I stood with it, a moment,
unopened in my hand, the old buildings, the chapel, the blue sky, the
grass, the fountain, the men in their blue gowns standing about, the
next moment it was rolled away like a scroll altogether out of sight.
'Ellie is dying,' the message from my mother said; 'come down to
Southam at once. She says nothing but "Fred."'</p>

<p>I got to the station a few minutes before the train started; I
caught the express at Huntingdon, and came on all night; I heard
nothing but Ellie's voice calling me by name. My father was well
known on the Great Northern, and they stopped the express for me at
the nearest station on that line to Southam, and I got a carriage and
two horses, and came on as fast as I could bribe the man to go. As we
got near our journey's end the dawn broke, and the sun, true to the
character of that year, rose upon a splendid autumn morning. The few
birds that were left sang gaily, the moist trees and grass and
brambles were covered with a thousand glittering drops, the blue sky
was streaked with varied colour, everything sang of new life, new
hope, new beauty, the resurrection from the night. Only in my heart I
felt a chill hatred of this beautiful nature, of this lovely,
unsympathising companion which mocks our grief; in my heart I felt,
as I have felt since at calmer and more solemn times, that this
beauty of nature has little in common with our deepest sorrows and
our highest hopes.</p>

<p>The grand old minster towers, with their Norman tracery, were
shining in the slanting glory of the rising sun; the rooks were
wheeling above the beeches. We had come rather slowly the last few
miles, but we swept through the village and up the drive at a gallop.
The house was ghastly with the white blinds. The maid who opened the
door was the same who had waited upon us at tea that evening, and
knew me at once before I spoke. Ellie was gone. From the first moment
the plague had struck her down she had said but one word, at first
continually, then at longer and longer intervals, but always the
same--'Fred.'</p>

<p>'Why did we travel down together, Ellie? Such a little way through
life.</p>

<p>In the far-off spaces of Eternity--.in the Light which no man can
approach unto--we shall know.</p>

<h3>Part 1</h3>

<p>AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL</p>

<p>When, in the year 1787, I entered, at the age of nineteen, the
university of the kingly city of Wenigstaat, I was, no doubt, a very
foolish young man, but I am perfectly certain that I was not a fool.
I suffered not only from that necessary disease which from the very
nature of existence it is impossible for a young man to escape, the
regarding of life from his own standpoint, as a man on first coming
into a brilliantly lighted and crowded room must of necessity, for a
few moments, be conscious of the varied scene only as it strikes
himself; but I was also to some extent subject to that fatuity which
haunts some young men, the forming of opinions and the giving audible
expression to them. Notwithstanding all this, I was at the same time
conscious of such a crowd of ideas, actuated by such ideas, and
stirred to the depths of my being by the emotions and results which
these ideas wrought upon me, that looking back with the impartiality
which the lapse of thirty years gives even to the review of one's
self, I feel perfectly confident that I was not a fool. I shall, I
fear, have to describe at some length how I came to be what I was,
but I will be as short as I can. My history would be worth nothing in
itself, but it is interwoven closely with that of some others whose
personality seems to me well worthy of record.</p>

<p>I was the eldest son of the pastor of the little village of
Waldreich in the wooded mountains of Bavaria. Though my father had a
large family, and his cure was only a village one, he was not so poor
as most of his order, for he had a little private income derived from
houses in Bayreuth: my mother had also some little money of her own.
My father was a man of a singular patience and quietude of conduct.
He divided his time between cultivating his little garden and
orchard, and preparing his sermons with elaborate care. When, in
after years, I became possessed of many of these beautifully written
discourses, I was amazed at the patience, care, and scholarship
expended upon these addresses to a few peasants, most of whom fell
asleep during the time of hearing. I believe that my father's sole
relaxation and indulgence consisted in poring over an old folio
Terence which he possessed, and which, shielded amidst the mysteries
of a dead language, he could read in perfect security, without fear
of scandalising his flock. Indeed it is possible that they regarded
it as a work of deep theology, and perhaps they were right.</p>

<p>The little village of Waldreich lies immediately at the foot of
the wooded hills. We ascended from the garden and croft of the
pastor's house straight into the fir-woods and the oak-dingles that
led up into the mysterious and wild heights above--into the mists and
cloud-shadows--into a land of green mountain-woods rising against
blue skies--a land of mist and rain-showers, of the tints of rainbows
spanning the village, and of coloured prisms of light stealing down
crag and forest-dingle--a land of rushing streams and still, solemn,
dark lakes--a land of castles upon distant peaks and of the faint
smoke of charcoal-burners on the hillsides. Through all the varied
changes of the day in this romantic land, from the cheerful dawn,
loud with the song of birds and the lowing of cattle, to the solemn
evening stillness, I passed the first few years of my life. The
scenes around him penetrated into the boy's being and formed his
nature. However, I have no wish to become wearisome in describing all
these influences and these results minutely. There is one influence,
however, which must be dwelt upon if the story is to be told at all,
for it was the leading influence of my life--the influence of sound.
From a very little child I was profoundly impressed by the sounds of
nature: the rushing water, the rustling oaks, the sighing and moaning
wind down the mountain-valleys spoke to me with distinct utterance,
and with a sense of meaning and even of speech. These sounds were
more even than this: they became a passion, a fascination, a haunting
presence, even a dread.</p>

<p>I can give one instance of this. Below the village and parsonage
house, where we lived, was a beautiful meadow on the banks of the
swift winding river. This meadow was my greatest delight as a little
child. At the lower end was a mill, and a mill-pool and race; and
around the edges of the pool beds of flags had planted themselves for
ages, forming a thick phalanx of waving pointed leaves. Nothing could
exceed the fascination this sight had for me, not only when the
yellow flowers mingled with the green stately leaves, but at other
times of the year when I listened hour after hour to the whispering
murmur through the innumerable lances of the reeds. But to reach this
meadow it was necessary to pass a row of vast, lofty, straggling
trees (I suppose some species of poplar), and no words can describe
the terror which the same wind, which delighted me so much in the
gentle murmur of its reed-music, inspired me with when heard through
these lofty swaying branches. I often, even in those early days,
wondered why the music of the wind through the green rushes on the
water's edge should have thrilled me with cheerfulness and joy, while
the same wind wailing through the branches of the great trees high
above my head crushed me with an unspeakable horror and dread.
Doubtless in this latter was the sense of vastness and unapproachable
height, infinite as it seemed to a little child--the touch, even, of
the infinite must ever, it would seem, be appalling to man.</p>

<p>It was in this way and by these experimental methods that I began
so early to recognise the mysterious connection that exists between
sound and human feeling.</p>

<p>Down the long winding oak-dingles, between the high cliffs and the
wooded slopes of the hills, there came to me as a little child
whispers and murmurs of dreams and stories of which at that time I
knew nothing, and to which I could give in those early days no
intelligent voice or meaning. But, as I grew in years and listened to
the talk of nurse and peasant, and of village lads and children, and
heard from them the legends of elf-kings and maidens and wild hunters
of the forest, weird and fantastic indeed, yet still strangely
instinct with human wants and hopes, I began to connect such
sympathy, felt then, as it seemed, for the first time, with human
life in all its varied aspects, and stories of human loves and joys
and terrors, with these sounds of nature, the sweeping wind through
wood.</p>

<p>I use these last words advisedly because, even in those earliest
days, it seemed to me that all sound that was of spiritual import was
in some hidden sense the product of the wind and of wood. There was a
wailing of the wind at night through the crevices of the high-pitched
roof and the panelled walls of the old parsonage that thrilled me as
with a message from on high, but this was still wind and wood. Butt
where the wind had no part, where it was not sound so much as noise,
in the clanging of metal upon metal, in the inarticulate screaming of
senseless creatures, the terror that I had felt in the wailing
wood,--that terror that had still something in it of the higher life
and hope,--was turned into the mere panic of despair.</p>

<p>I distinctly remember that I had these feelings as a child; but,
since those days, I have pleased myself in finding that the great
Goethe shared with me my dislike to the continuous barking of a dog.
'Annihilation,' he said one day, in conversation with the
Legationsrath Falk, 'is utterly out of the question; but the
possibility of being caught on the way by some more powerful, and yet
baser monas, and subordinated to it--that is unquestionably a very
serious consideration; and I, for my part, have never been able
entirely to divest myself of the fear of it. At this moment a dog was
heard repeatedly barking in the street. Goethe sprang hastily to the
window and called out to it: 'Take what form you will, vile larva,
you shall not subjugate me.' A gallant boast but an ineffectual one!
Noise, especially if continued on one note, deadens and destroys the
soul, the life of the mind within the brain. The constant reiteration
of one note will drive a man mad, just as the continual fall of a
drop of water upon the same spot of the head will cause madness and
death. You may prove this on the violin. Whereas if you laid your
head down in the meadow by the river on the long grass, there came to
you in the whispering wind something like the sea-murmurs that live
within the shell--tidings of a delicate life, news of a world beyond
the thought of those who merely haunt the palaces of earth.</p>

<p>These two, the murmur of the wind through grass and the whisper
within the shell, are perhaps the most delicate sounds that Nature
can produce: was it possible that I should find in art something more
perfect still? In this passion for sound, in which I lived as in a
paradise, it may be asked, Where did music find a place? The music
that I heard in my childhood was not of the best class; and perhaps
this might be the reason that musical sound rather than music seemed
to haunt those hours of childhood, for among the untutored sounds of
Nature there are, now and again, musical notes of surpassing beauty.
Among the railing sounds of the wind that haunted the high-pitched
roof above the boarded ceiling of our bedroom, there was one perfect
and regular note. It never varied, except in loudness according to
the force of the wind. This note, in its monotony, had an enthralling
upon my imagination. I had once associated certain thoughts with its
message: no doubt the continued association of ideas of recollected
imagery would explain the rest.</p>

<p>The wandering musicians that played in the court-yard on summer
evenings upon hautboys and fiddles no doubt reached me with a strange
message from afar, especially in the shrill high notes; and on
Sunday, in the village church, the organist thundered out fugues and
fantasias, but it was the final cadences only that touched me:
somehow the organ seemed wanting in that supreme searching power of
wind and wood.</p>

<p>But one day, it was a summer evening, there came into the
court-yard four zither players from the South. I say zither players,
but their instruments were more like the old Italian lutes for size
and the number of strings. They were regulated each at a certain
interval, including only the notes of the middle octaves.</p>

<p>They played a singular rapid music with little tune. It was like a
rippling maenad dance: apparently reckless and untrained, yet in
reality perfectly regulated in step and figure, every note true to
its corresponding note in the higher or lower octave, and now and
again all united in one sudden consonant harmony, by which the wild
lawless music vindicated its perception of unison and the moral
perfection of pure sound; but even in this there seemed to me nothing
that spoke in just the same voice as did the gentle whisper of that
teaching wind through grass and wood.</p>

<p>On the organ in the parish church, written in faded gold letters,
were the words from Luther's Bible: 'The wind bloweth where it will,
and thou hearest the sound of it well, so is every one that is of the
spirit born.'</p>

<p>When, as a child, I sat during long sermons the little grated seat
of the pastor's children, I pondered over these words, and for a long
time could find no reason or congruity in them. What had the wind
blowing where it listeth to do with the birth of the spirit? But on
one hot summer afternoon, when I had fallen asleep during my father's
discourse, I was suddenly aroused by the cessation of the preacher's
voice and by the murmuring fall of harmony, for the organist probably
had been asleep too, and was playing unconsciously such simple notes
as came first to hand. I say I awoke suddenly into life and sense,
and saw the rich mellow tints of the organ-wood, and these mystic
letters all lighted up with the gilding rays; and an inward
consciousness came like a flash of lightning from heaven into the
child's mind that the wandering, seeking wind through reed or
organ-pipe or flute, or over strings of violin or grassy hill, spoke
to the spirit and to the spirit-born, and to such only, with a
sufficient and adequate voice. This conception came to me like a
message from above. It raised my thoughts of Nature and harmonised
her voices with the needs and desires of my own soul. I pondered over
it day and night; but before long an event occurred which was in the
end the means of leading me beyond this half truth, and of more fully
opening to me the gates of the mystical city of sound, of which this
organ-text had already given me some fairy glimpses, and of revealing
to me at last the true music which is not only heard by the
spirit-born but is born of the spirit itself. My father went once
every month on a kind of supernatural mission, as it seemed to us
children, to an unknown and dimly conceived mansion or
mountain-palace in the hills. That is, he was chaplain to the old
Gr&auml;fin von Wetstein, and once a month he preached before her on
Sundays. Sometimes, on special occasions, an ornamental or
state-coach was sent for the pastor, who thus seemed rapt as in a
celestial chariot from his family and the ordinary village folk.</p>

<p>One surprising day, when the lad was between fourteen and fifteen,
the father said to him: 'Put on thy best clothes, for tomorrow thou
shalt go with me to the Gr&auml;fin.'</p>

<p>It may well be imagined that there was not much sleep for the boy
that night.</p>

<p>It would take too long to tell of the wonders of that journey in
the state-coach, of the foolish, but perhaps natural pride of sitting
there above the common folk, and observing through the windows the
respect paid by all to the magnificent and symbolic vehicle, if not
to those who sat therein.</p>

<p>When we reached the schloss, which stood high up on the hills amid
woodland meadows and cow-pastures, then indeed the boy's expectation
and excitement grew too painful almost to be borne. He passed through
the gardens, with terraces and urns and statues, and the cascades of
water that came down from great ponds, formed in the summits of the
hills by building high stone walls and dams across the ravines. Later
on he was even presented to the Gr&auml;fin, who, herself a wizened,
faded old woman, stood beneath the portraits of her ancestors, by a
great window in the gallery of the schloss, overlooking the valleys
and the champaign country beyond.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason this old woman, who scarcely spoke to any
one and seemed to take no interest in the present world, looking, as
it were, constantly out of the high windows into the driving
cloudland, as though she saw there all her past life and the figures
of all those who had alone made it dear to her, and who were
themselves all gone into the cloudland of the Infinite Unseen,--this
old woman, not at the first interview, but at the second or third, in
the fresh mornings over the early coffee, took a strange liking for
the little village lad. As this ill-assorted pair sat at the open
window on the quiet summer evenings, far above the distant woodland
and the forest meadows, face to face with the long streaks of solemn
light along the horizon, an almost imperceptible murmur, so soft and
gentle was it, passed up through the branches of the sycamore and
chestnut trees and of the lower growing pines, and, mingling with the
distant Ranz des Vaches, brought up as it seemed the life and
struggles and sorrows of the plain and of the people into the ears of
this worn-out, old, feeble aristocrat of the hills. She would say to
the boy: 'And what do you do, you children, in the winter nights,
when you steal back in your night-dresses to the great fire, and the
father is reading Terence? Tell it to me all again.'</p>

<p>Finally, she insisted upon my staying with her for weeks at a
time, and she bound herself to the pastor, by a written paper, to
provide for my future career. The boy led mostly a wild life, for his
interviews with his patroness took place at odd times and hours, but
he had some lessons from a resident cleric who superintended the
household, and had other teachers more than perhaps any one knew.</p>

<p>My father had often told his listening family of the great nobles
who would from time to time stay at the schloss, and how he would be
invited, being of a witty and conversational habit, derived probably
from his reading in Terence, to dine with them.</p>

<p>Some of these great noblemen I also saw at a distance in the
garden or elsewhere; but on one occasion a young Graf came to stay
some days with his great-aunt, having returned quite lately from the
Italian tour with his tutor. This tutor, an Italian, performed
wonderfully, it was said, on the violin. He was invited to play
before the Gr&auml;fin, and the boy was admitted among the domestics
of the schloss.</p>

<p>Then, on a sudden, was revealed to him the secret which had
escaped him so long, the consciousness of the existence of which had
haunted him in the wind-swept meadow and amid the awful, swaying
branches of the lofty trees.</p>

<p>I am not going to describe this playing. Attempts have been
sometimes made to describe violin-playing in words, but rarely, I
think, with much success. I shall only say that almost as soon as he
began to play what seemed to me then a singularly strange idea
occurred to me. This man, I thought, is not playing on his
instrument: he is playing on my brain. His violin is only as it were
the bow, or rather, every note of his violin vibrates with the
according note of the brain-fibre. I do not say that I put the
thought exactly into these words; but these are the words into which,
at the present time, I put the recollection of my thought. I need not
point out how my ignorance erred in detail, how the brain has no
extended strings corresponding to the strings of a violin; but I have
since thought that there was more truth in this wild idea of a
child's ignorance than would at first appear, and it seemed to lead
the way to a second thought, which crossed my mind in the transport
of ecstasy produced by this, the first violin playing worthy of the
name, which I had ever heard.</p>

<p>I knew the secret now, both of the entrancing whisper of the
wind-music and also why, at a certain point, it had failed. The
blind, senseless wind, blowing merely where it listed, had aroused
the human spirit through the medium of grass and reed and rock and
forest, and called it through the fairy gate into cloud and
dreamland; but when, instead of the blind, senseless wind the
instructed human spirit itself touched the strings, music, born of
cultured harmony, through all the long scale of accordant sound, won
for the listening, rapt, ecstatic spirit an insight and an entrance
into realms which the outward eye had not seen, the secrets of which
it is not lawful or possible to utter to any save to the
spirit-born.</p>

<p>'You seem absorbed in the music, my boy,' said this gentleman to
me: 'do you play the violin, perchance?'</p>

<p>I said that I had played on no instrument save picking out
harmonious thirds on an old harpsichord at the parsonage house. My
father was perfectly an amateur: he loved music so much that he
refused to play himself, or to allow any one else to play in his
hearing save those who could play well: 'playing a little' was his
dread.</p>

<p>The gentleman shut up his precious violin in its case and produced
another, on which he showed me the possibility of varying the note
through every shade of pitch by the position of the finger on the
vibrating string. It is impossible to describe the delight I felt
when I was able to feel out a chord of three notes.</p>

<p>'I am violating your father's instructions perhaps,' said the
gentleman, smiling; 'but every one must have a beginning.
Nevertheless he has much on his side. It has been said, rather
cynically, "The moment a man touches an instrument he ceases to be a
musician."'</p>

<p>I did not understand this then, but I understood it well
afterwards.</p>

<p>The gentleman left one of his less cherished instruments behind
him, with some simple exercises which he enjoined me to practise
only, and to attempt nothing else, but I blush to say that I did not
follow his advice. I played the chords he left me now and again, but
I was absorbed in the one idea that his playing had left with me--the
thought of the human spirit informing the senseless wind. I delighted
only in the fancy that I was a mere automaton, and that the pervading
spirit--the spirit that inspires man and breathes in Nature--was
playing through my spirit upon the obedient vibrating strings. In
this way I played fantasias of the most striking and original
character, and at the same time destroyed all my chances, or ran a
serious risk of doing so, of ever becoming a violinist.</p>

<p>Three quiet years passed in this manner, during which I lived
almost constantly at Geiselwind with the Gr&auml;fin, who, in fact,
treated me as her own son. At the end of that time she informed me
that she intended to send me to the university of Wenigstaat. She
chose this university for me, she told me, because it was near, but
above all because it was not famous, but was, in fact, a mere
appanage to a kingly city, and was therefore less likely to pervert
from the correct and decorous habits in which they had been brought
up, the ideas and habits of young men. She would provide me with a
sufficient income, and would take care that my wardrobe and
appointments were those of a gentleman, a station which she wished me
to occupy and to maintain without disgrace.</p>

<p>The habits of society in the universities and elsewhere were very
different in those days from what they have since become. The old
society of the days before the revolution existed in its full
strength. French taste in costume and amusements was universal; and
the fashion of philosophic inquiry which was copied from the French
was a mere intellectual toy, and had no effect upon the practical
conclusions of those who amused themselves with it. The merits of
republican institutions and the inviolability of the rights of man
were discussed as abstract questions, without a thought that the
conclusions would ever be applied to modern life, or to the daily
relationships of nobles and peasants and townspeople. Before the
bursting of the torrent which was to sweep it out of existence, the
old world slumbered in a rainbow-tinted evening light of delicately
fancied culture and repose.</p>

<p>The habits and appearance of university students have changed more
completely than those of any other class. In the most advanced cities
even in those days they dressed completely in the French manner, in
embroidered suits and powdered hair, fluttering from toilette to
toilette, and caring little for lectures or professors. In the old
stately city of Wenigstaat, it may be easily understood, the ideas
and habits of the past existed with a peculiar unchangeableness.</p>

<p>I regretted leaving the life of hill and forest and dreamy
phantasy in which I had found so much to delight me, but the natural
love of youth for change and adventure consoled me. One great
advantage I derived from the choice the Gr&auml;fin had made for me
was, that I did not change the character of my outward surroundings.
I was nearly nineteen when I left Geiselwind and arrived one evening
in a postchaise at Wenigstaat.</p>

<p>The city lay in a wooded valley surrounded by hills covered to
their summits with woods of beech and oak and fir: through these
woods running streams and cascades forced their way now through the
green mountain meadows, now over rocky steeps and dingles: a soft
blue sky brooded over this green world of leaf and grass and song
birds, and sunlit showers swept over the woodland and deepened the
verdure into fresher green. In the centre of this plain, almost
encircled by a winding river, the city was built upon a hill which
divided itself into two summits, upon one of which stood the
cathedral and upon the other the King's palace. Between these summits
the old town wound its way up, past gates and towers and market-place
and rathhaus and the buildings of the university, with masses of old
gabled houses of an oppressive height and of immemorial antiquity,
with huge overhanging stories and tiers of rooms wandering on,
apparently without plan or guide, from house to house and street to
street--a human hive of intricate workmanship, of carpentry-work and
stonework and brickwork, all crowded together in the little space of
the rising hill-street above the rushing stream, a space small in
itself but infinite in its thronged stories of centuries of life--a
vast grave, not only of generations of the dead, themselves lying not
far from the foundations of their homes, but of buried hopes, of
faded beauty, of beaten courage and stricken faith and patience
crushed and lost at last in the unequal fight with fate. The dim
cathedral, full of storied windows of deep bloodstained glass and of
colossal figures of mailed heroes guarding emblazoned tombs, faced
the King's palace, a massive ivy-covered fortress relieved here and
there with fa&ccedil;ades of carved work of the later
Renaissance.</p>

<p>The tired horses of my postchaise struggled up over the stone
pavement of this steep street amid the crowd of loiterers and
traffickers and gay pleasure-seekers that thronged it and drew up
before the Three Roses in the Peterstrasse, where a room had been
provided for me. Here I slept, and here I dined every day at an
ordinary frequented by many of the principal citizens, by some of the
wealthier students, and by some officials and courtiers, when it was
not the turn of the latter in waiting at the palace. This table was
one at least of the centres of life and interest in the little kingly
city.</p>

<p>To a boy reared in a country parsonage and an old half-deserted
manor-house, all this, it may be conceived, was strange enough; but
somehow it did not seem to me wholly strange. I had been trained at
the table of the Gr&auml;fin to the usages of polite life, and the
whispering wind and the solemn forests of my childhood had seemed to
lift me above a sense of embarrassment, as though the passing scenes
before me were but the shadows and visions of a dream. I looked down
the long table at the varied faces, at the talkers and showy ones, at
the grave citizens, at the quiet humorous students, who now and then
said a few words that turned the laugh against the talkers, at the
courtiers affecting some special knowledge of affairs of state about
which the King probably troubled himself little; and I remember that
it all seemed to me like turning the pages of a story-book, or like
the shifting scenes of a play, about which latter, though I had never
seen one, I had read and heard much.</p>

<p>On the second and third day I found myself seated by a little
elderly man, very elaborately dressed, with powdered hair and a
beautifully embroidered coat. I have always felt an attraction
towards old men: they are so polite, and their conversation, when
they do talk, is always worth listening to. Something of this
feeling, perhaps, showed itself in my manner. On the third day he
said to me on rising from dinner: 'I perceive, sir, that you are a
stranger here; you seem to me to be a quiet well-bred young man, and
I shall be glad if I can be of any use to you. You are doubtless come
to the university, and are evidently well connected. I am a
professor--a professor of belles lettres and music, and I have been
tutor to the Crown Prince. I may possibly be of some service to you:
some of the great professors are rather difficult of access.'</p>

<p>'I am the adopted son of the Gr&auml;fin von Wetstein, sir,' I
answered. 'I have letters to several of the professors of the
university, but I find them much occupied in their duties, and not
very easy of approach.</p>

<p>'We will soon remedy all that,' he said, smiling. 'To what course
of study are you most inclined, and what is the future to which your
friends design you?'</p>

<p>I fear, sir,' I returned, 'that my future is very undefined. I
am--as you say you are a professor of music--very fond of the violin;
but I am a very poor performer, and I fear I shall never be a
proficient.'</p>

<p>'I profess music,' said the old gentleman, with his quaint smile,
'but do not teach it: I only talk about it. I will introduce you,
however, to a great teacher of the violin, and, indeed, if you would
like it, we can go to him now. This is about the time that we shall
find him disengaged.'</p>

<p>We went out together into the crowded market-place and turned to
the left hand, up a street of marvellous height, narrowness, and
steepness which led round the eastern end of the cathedral, and
indeed nearly concealed it from sight. At the top of this street, on
the side farthest from the cathedral, the vast west window of which
could just be seen over the gables, chimneys, and stork-nests of the
opposite houses, we stopped before the common door of one of the
lofty old houses, against the posts of which were attached several
affiches or notices of differing forms and material. Among these my
companion pointed out one larger and more imposing than the rest:
'Veitch, teacher of the violin.'</p>

<p>'I ought to tell you,' said the old gentleman, 'that my daughter
is reader to the Princess, and that she comes to Herr Veitch for
lessons on the violin, that she may assist her Highness. If the Graf
von Wetstein should take lessons here also, he may possibly meet
her.'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon,' I said: 'I must correct an important mistake.
I am only the adopted son of the Gr&auml;fin von Wetstein. I am not
the Graf: my name is Saale.'</p>

<p>The old gentleman seemed rather disappointed at this, but he
rallied sufficiently to say: 'You may nevertheless meet my daughter,
Herr von Saale.'</p>

<p>It sounded so pleasantly that I had not the hardihood to correct
him again.</p>

<p>I was accordingly introduced to every one in Wenigstaat as Herr
von Saale, and I may as well say, once for all, that I did not suffer
for this presumption as I deserved. Some weeks later on I received a
letter from the Gr&auml;fin, in which she said: 'I have noticed that
you have been mentioned to me in letters as Otto von Saale. As I have
chosen to adopt you, and as Saale is the name of a river, and
therefore is to a certain extent territorial, I think perhaps that
this may not be amiss; and I flatter myself that I have sufficient
influence at the Imperial Court to procure for you a faculty which
will enable you to add the prefix von to your patronymic.'
Accordingly, some months afterwards, I did receive a most important
and wordy document; but I had by that time become so accustomed to my
aristocratic title that I thought little of it, though its
possession, no doubt, may have saved me from some serious
consequences.</p>

<p>We have been standing too long on the staircase which led up to
Herr Veitch's room on the second floor of the great rambling house.
The room which the old gentleman led me into was one of great size,
occupying the entire depth of the house. It had long deep-latticed
windows at either end raised by several steps above the level of the
room: the window towards the front of the house looked down the steep
winding street; from the other I saw, over the roofs of the city,
piled in strange confusion beneath the high-pitched windows of the
upper town, a wide prospect of sky and river and valley, and the
distant blue mountains and forests of the Fichtelgebirge, where my
home had been.</p>

<p>The room was somewhat crowded with furniture, chiefly large old
oaken presses or cabinets apparently full of books, a harpsichord,
clavichord, and several violins. In the centre of this apartment, as
he rose to receive us, stood an elderly man, rather shabbily dressed,
with an absent expression in his face 'Herr Veitch,' said my guide,
'permit me to present to you Herr von Saale, a young gentleman of
distinguished family and connections, who has come to reside in our
university He is anxious to perfect himself in the violin, upon which
he is already no mean performer.'</p>

<p>I was amazed at the glibness with which this surprising old
gentleman discoursed upon that of which he knew so little.</p>

<p>The old violinist looked at me with a dazed and even melancholy
expression, his eyes seemed to me to say as clearly as words could
have spoken: 'Here is another frivolous impostor intruded upon
me.'</p>

<p>'Is this one of my daughter's days?' said my friend, the old
gentleman.</p>

<p>'No; I expect her to-morrow about this time.'</p>

<p>'The Princess,' said my friend, 'is very shy: she dislikes taking
lessons from men, and prefers to gain her knowledge of music from my
daughter.'</p>

<p>The old master took up a violin that lay upon the table and handed
it to me. I played a simple lesson that had been left me by the
Italian, the only one that had taken my fancy, for it had in its few
notes, as it seemed to me, something of the pleading of the
whispering wind.</p>

<p>The old man took the violin from me without a word: then he drew
the bow across the strings himself and played some bars, from, I
imagine, some old forgotten Italian master. As he played the solemn
chords of the sonata, in the magnetic resonance of its full smooth
rich notes, there was something that seemed to fill all space, to
lead and draw the nerves and brain, as over gorgeous sun-coloured
pavements and broad stately terraces, with alluring sound and
speech.</p>

<p>He laid down the violin after he had played for a few minutes, and
went to the harpsichord, which stood near to the window looking down
into the street.</p>

<p>'You know something of music,' he said to me: 'do you understand
this?</p>

<p>He struck a single clear note upon the harpsichord and turned
towards the window, a casement of which was open towards the crowded
street.</p>

<p>'Down there,' he said,--'where I know not, but somewhere down
there,--is a heart and brain that beats with that beat, that vibrates
with the vibration of that note, that hears and recognises and is
consoled. To every note struck anywhere there is an accordant note in
some human brain, toiling, dying, suffering, here below.'</p>

<p>He looked at me, and I said: 'I have understood something of this
also.'</p>

<p>'This is why,' he went on, 'in music all hearts are revealed to
us: we sympathise with all hearts, not only with those near to us but
with those afar off. It is not strange that in the notes of the
higher octaves that speak of children and lark singing and heaven,
you, who are young, should hear of such things; but, in the sudden
drop into the solemn lower notes, why should you, who know nothing of
such feelings, see and feel with the old man who returns to the
streets and fields of his youth? He lives, his heart vibrates in such
notes: his life, his heart, his tears exist in them, and through them
in you. Just as one looks from a lofty precipitous height down into
the teeming streets of a great city, full of pigmy forms, so in the
majestic march of sound we get away from life and its littleness, and
see the whole of life spread out before us, and feel the pathos of it
with the pity of an archangel, as we could never have done in the
bustle of the streets there below.'</p>

<p>'You are cutting the ground from under my feet, my friend,' said
the old Professor, rather testily. 'It is your business to teach
music, mine to talk about it.'</p>

<p>The old master smiled at this sally, but he went on all the same.
I thought that he perceived in me a sympathetic listener.</p>

<p>'Have you never felt that in the shrill, clear, surging chords of
the higher notes you were climbing into a loftier existence, and do
you not feel that for the race itself something like this is also
possible? It will be in and through music that human thought will be
carried beyond the point it has hitherto reached.'</p>

<p>He paused a moment and then went on in a lower, less confident
voice. 'This is my faith, and I shall die in it. There is one thing
only which saddens me. There are men, ay, great performers, real
masters of the bow--who know nothing of these things, who have no
such faith. There is none whom I would sooner regard as a devil than
such a one. Sometimes when I hear them they almost destroy the faith
that is in me--the faith in my art.'</p>

<p>'Pooh! pooh! my friend,' said the Professor. 'They are not so bad
as that! They have simply the divine gift of the perception of
harmony--the instinctive harmonic touch. They know not why or
how.</p>

<p>They are not devils. Herr von Saale,' he went on, with, for him,
considerable earnestness, 'do not believe it. I fancy that you are in
danger of falling into the fatal error of supposing that you can play
on the violin in the same way that you can whistle an air, by the
mere force of the mental faculty. You cannot form a more mistaken
notion. The variation of the thirty-secondth of an inch in the sudden
movement of the finger on the string will cause the note to be out of
tune; and the man who puts his finger on the right spot at the right
second of time, though he may have no more mental instinct than a
pig, will produce in the utmost perfection the chords of the most
angelic composer.'</p>

<p>'I deny it!' cried the master, in a kind of fury, walking up and
down the long room, 'I deny it! There is true sympathy and
cooperation in the nerves and tissues of this faithful despised
servant, the material human frame, even to the finger-tips, with the
informing, teaching spirit. There is a tremor, a shading, a trill of
meaning, given by the spirit to the nerves and tissues that no
instinctive touch of harmony will ever give. The ancient Greeks (as
you ought to know, Herr Professor, for you speak of them often
enough) had no music worthy of the name, for they had no instruments;
but had they had our instruments they would have produced the most
ravishing music, for the spirit taught them what music was apart from
outward sound, and they talked as beautifully as you talk in your
lecture-room of the divine laws of motion and of number, and of the
harmonies of sound and of the mind.'</p>

<p>The Professor seemed rather taken aback by this onslaught, and
turning to me, said:</p>

<p>'Well, Herr von Saale, you had better come with me: I will show
you some of the sights of our kingly city. You shall come to Herr
Veitch to-morrow, when perhaps you will see my daughter.'</p>

<p>He seemed to me strangely willing that I should see his
daughter.</p>

<p>He took me into the great cathedral and showed me the gigantic
mailed figures that guarded the tombs of the kings, talking very
learnedly upon heraldry, about which he seemed to know a great deal.
The next morning I went to Herr Veitch at the appointed time and
found him alone, playing over a set of old Italian sonatas. He seemed
to have been much put out by the Professor's remarks of the day
before, and to regard me with kindliness as having been apparently on
the opposite side; but when he came to talk to me I did not see much
difference between his advice and that of the Professor.</p>

<p>'The Professor is so far right,' he said, 'in that of all
instruments the violin needs the most careful study, the most
practised fingering, the most instinctive aptitude of ear and touch.
It is all very well to talk of expression, but expression with faulty
execution is fatal on the violin. It is true that some of the most
entrancing players have been self-taught amateurs, but they were such
because they had musical genius by birth, and it was therefore
possible to them to be amateurs and to be self-taught. In concerted
music no amount of expression will enable a performer to take his
part or to be tolerated. What pleases me in your playing is that you
are able to produce smooth and sweet notes: the scrapy, scratchy
period with you has apparently been short. What you want is greater
certainty of touch and ear. This can only be obtained by patient
labour and study.'</p>

<p>I set to work to play lessons, and while we were thus engaged the
door opened and a young lady entered, accompanied by a tall and
imposing domestic in the royal livery. I did not need to be told that
this was the Professor's daughter, the Fr&auml;ulein Adelheid, the
reader to the Princess. She appeared to me on this, the first time
that my eyes rested upon her, a handsome, stately girl, with a steady
fixed look, and grave solemn eyes and mouth, which seldom changed
their expression or smiled. She was rather above the common height,
with fair brown hair and eyes, and was richly dressed in white, with
a lace kerchief across her shoulders, and a broad white hat with a
crimson feather. She seemed to me a true German girl, with earnest,
steadfast truth and feeling; but I did not fall in love with her at
first sight.</p>

<p>'This is Otto von Saale, Fr&auml;ulein,' said the master, 'whom
your father introduced to me yesterday, and of whom he may have
spoken to you. He is very fond of music and the violin, and your
father seemed much taken with him. His forte is expression.'</p>

<p>The Fr&auml;ulein regarded me without embarrassment, with her
steady brown eyes. 'Do you play in concert, Herr von Saale?' she
said.</p>

<p>'He is not quite equal to that yet,' said Herr Veitch. 'The
prospect of playing with you, will, I am confident, inspire him with
resolve to practise with the necessary patience.'</p>

<p>'That will be very well timed,' she said serenely, 'as we want to
perform a trio before the Princess.'</p>

<p>'He must work some time before he can do that,' observed Herr
Veitch decisively.</p>

<p>They set to work to play, and I confess that I felt indescribable
mortification in being unable to take a part. All my beautiful
fantasias and wind-music seemed at the moment nothing to the power of
joining in a concerted piece. The beauty of the playing, however,
soon soothed my ruffled vanity and banished every thought save that
of delight. The master and pupil were playing in perfect accord both
in feeling and sympathetic touch--the old man and the stately
beautifully dressed girl--it was a delicious banquet of sight and
sound.</p>

<p>After they had played some time, Herr Veitch said, to my great
delight: 'Otto will play you a lesson of his which the whispering
woodlands of his mountains have taught him. You will like it.'</p>

<p>I took the bow with a tremor of delight and excitement. I played
my very best. I endeavoured only to listen to--to think only of the
woodland voices that had spoken to the child; and after a few moments
I seemed, indeed, once again to be a child beside the dance-like
waving rushes with their sunny dance-music, by the pool, or beneath
the solemn poplars with the weird and awful notes that sounded amid
their distant branches high above me in the sky. When I stopped I
fancied that the brown eyes looked at me with a softer and more
kindly gaze.</p>

<p>'He will do,' said the master; 'he will play the trio before the
Princess anon, if he will be good.'</p>

<p>For several days I was very good: I practised continually scales
and passages and shades of accent, both with the master and in my
chamber at the 'Three Roses,' where, had I not been in Germany, I
should no doubt have been thought a nuisance. I saw the Fr&auml;ulein
Adelheid almost every day, and was allowed once or twice to play in a
simple piece. So everything seemed to prosper, when one fatal day I
broke waywardly loose from this virtuous and regular course. It was
after this manner that it came about.</p>

<p>One morning in the late summer I woke up with a sudden surprising
sense of a crisp freshness, of a sudden strain of livelier colour
shot through sky and woodland, of a change beginning to work through
masses of brown foliage and cloudless summer sky. The touch was that
of the angel of decay: but the first signs of his coming were gentle
and gracious, with a sense even of life-giving in that new feeling of
a change. The first day of autumn had dawned. As I rose, intending to
go to the master, the city lay in a wonderful golden mist, through
which the old streets and gables and spires seemed strange to the
sight, with the romantic vision, almost, of a dream. An intense
longing possessed me for the woods and hills. It seemed to me as if a
far-off voice from the long past hours of childhood was calling me to
the distant rocks and forests: a faint, low voice, like that strange
whisper through the short grass, to hear which at all you must lay
your ear very close indeed to the ground: a note untuned, uncertain,
untrammelled, but with a strange alluring power, making itself felt
amid the smooth, cultured, artistic sounds to which I had given
myself up, and saying, as in the old harmonic thirds which as a child
I had delighted to pick out, 'Come back to me.' I was engaged to Herr
Veitch, but it was uncertain whether the Fr&auml;ulein would be able
to come. There was some talk that the Princess would make an
excursion with a guest of distinction into the mountains, and her
reader might possibly be required to accompany her. The Princess was
understood to be very shy, and to surround herself as much as
possible with her ladies and women.</p>

<p>The irresistible impulse was too strong for me. I sent a message
to Herr Veitch, and hastened out of the confining streets, past the
crumbling gates and towers, into the valley and the fields. I
wandered down the banks of the stream, by which the road ran, for
some hours, until the sun was high in the heavens, and every sound
and leaf was hushed in the noontide stillness and heat. Then crossing
the river at a ferry, where a little village and some mills stayed
its current for a time, I ascended a steep path into the wooded
meadows, whence the seductive voice seemed still to come. In a broad
upland valley that sloped downwards to the plain and to the river I
came upon a wide open meadow skirting the wild pathless wood. Here,
at a corner of the outstanding copse, I saw to my surprise a number
of horses picketed and apparently deserted by their grooms, and
turning the corner of the wood I saw in the centre of the meadow an
unexpected and most beautiful sight.</p>

<p>In the midst of the meadow, only, as it seemed, a few paces from
me, was a group of gentlemen in hunting costume, some with long
curved horns slung at their backs. Some servants and grooms were
collected a few paces behind them, but a little to the side nearest
to me, close to two men of distinguished appearance some paces in
advance of the rest, stood the most beautiful creature that I had
ever seen. She was dressed as a huntress of romance, in green trimmed
with white, and a hat fringed with white feathers, and a small silver
bugle hung by her side. But it was not her dress, or her figure, that
gave her the indescribable charm that made her so lovely: it was the
bewitching expression of her face. Her features might possibly have
been described as large, but this, as her complexion was of perfect
delicacy and freshness, only increased the subduing charm of the shy,
fleeting, coy expression about her eyes and mouth. Two ladies stood
close behind her, neither of whom was the Fr&auml;ulein, but I knew
at once that this could be none other than the Princess. No family of
pure German origin could have produced such a face: she sprang,
doubtless, as is becoming to a daughter of kings, from a mixed
race.</p>

<p>A perfect stillness and hush, as of expectation, pervaded the
scene: even the well-trained horses made no movement as I passed by
them. One of the grooms caught a glimpse of me and made a slight
sign: then, just as the group had settled itself on my sight, a
slight, scarcely perceptible rustle was heard in the wood, and a stag
of full age and noble bearing came out into the meadow and stood at
gaze, startled but not alarmed. One of the gentlemen in front raised
a short hunting-piece, and the Princess, in a soft sweet undertone
that penetrated all the listening air and left an imperishable memory
upon the heart, exclaimed: 'Oh, do not kill it! How beautiful it
is!'</p>

<p>A short, sharp crack, a puff of smoke, and the stag leaped
suddenly into the air and fell lifeless, shot between the eyes.</p>

<p>There was a sudden outbreak of exclamation and talk, a rush of the
hunters towards the fallen beast. Two or three of the gentlemen drew
around the Princess and her ladies, as if to protect her, and in the
excitement no one noticed me. I stood for a moment or two, my eyes
fixed on this changing, sensitive, inexpressibly beautiful face. Then
the beaters and foresters came out of the wood: some remained with
the fallen stag, and the rest of the party moved on farther up into
the forest followed by the grooms and horses. I returned at once,
silent and fancy-struck, to the city, and passed the rest of the day
and the entire night in a dream.</p>

<p>The next morning I made my best excuses to Herr Veitch, and tried
to settle to my work, but I found that this was impossible until I
had made a full confession. He took it very quietly and as a matter
of course: not so, however, did the Fr&auml;ulein, a day or two
afterwards, when he revealed the whole story to her. She looked at me
strangely with her great brown eyes as one who foresaw some great
danger awaiting me; and I wondered, in vain, from what quarter it
would come.</p>

<p>I made great progress under her tuition. In playing with her in
unison I learned more in a few minutes than in any other way. The
instinct of fingering seemed to come naturally by her means, by her
gentle guidance, by her placid rule. Here again outward harmonies of
nature and of art corresponded in its contrast with the life of the
spirit; with the rapt, enthralling passion of love which had come
upon me by the vision in the forest, and with the calm sympathy which
was growing up in my heart with the Fr&auml;ulein, smooth, broad,
tranquil, as the full harmonious chords which she taught me to play.
But with all this I confess that the prevailing thought of my mind
was that I should some day, and that soon, take my part in this music
before the lovely Princess; that I should see again that
indescribable, enchanting face.</p>

<p>'We are getting on,' said Herr Veitch: 'we shall be ready
soon.'</p>

<p>'Let us have a rehearsal,' said Adelheid, with her grave, gentle
smile: 'let us have a rehearsal to-morrow in Das Vergnugen, in the
garden-valley of the palace.'</p>

<p>Below the palace, on the side farthest from the city, the wooded
valley formed a fairy garden of terraces and of streams flowing down
from the hills. In the bottom of the valley were buildings, somewhat
on a small scale, after the fashion of the French garden-palaces of
Trianon and Marly, and in these little houses some of the
court-officials had rooms. The Professor and his daughter occupied
one of the most charming suites of apartments opening upon a wide
lawn beneath the terraced garden leading up to the palace, broken up
by clipped hedges and rows of statues. I had never seen this garden
of romance until the afternoon of the rehearsal. In the excitement
and nervousness of the hour I was dimly conscious of a solemn blue
sky overhead, of the dark foliage of the dying summer rising on the
steep hillsides on every hand, of a still afternoon full of sombre
tints and sleeping sunlight, of the late-flowering china-roses and
the tall asters, of massive wreaths of clematis, of a sense of
finished effort and growth, and of a hush and pause before decay set
in and brought the end of life and of the year: the little stone
palace with its carved pilasters and wreaths of fruit and flowers,
the weather-stained, moss-tinted statues and urns,--of all this I was
dimly conscious as in a dream.</p>

<p>The Herr Professor was more than usually spruce in his apparel. I
had purchased, boylike, a new dress for the occasion. It was the
period of frizzled, powdered hair, and lace and embroidery. A man who
wore plain clothes and his hair au naturel was considered eccentric
and of doubtful character. We formed a group on the little in-closed
grass-plot outside the windows of the Professor's sitting-room,
separated from the great lawns by the low clipped hedges and the
wreathed urns. I noticed that the Fr&auml;ulein seemed anxious and
almost expectant, and was continually turning her head in the
direction of the palace-gardens. At last she said to her father: 'I
fear that I have committed a blunder. I begged to be excused from
attending the Princess, and I told her that I was going to practise
with the master here, but I said nothing of Otto, or that he would be
here. It is quite possible that the Princess may come down through
the gardens to hear the master play.'</p>

<p>The Professor shrugged his shoulders 'It is too late now,' he
said, 'the sight of Otto will not kill her.'</p>

<p>'No,' said his daughter doubtfully; but she shook her head as
though a catastrophe was very imminent.</p>

<p>A tremor of excitement and of suppressed delight passed through my
frame. If the mere thought of the rehearsal had excited me, what must
I have felt at such a possibility as this?</p>

<p>We began to practise the trio with the violoncello and two
violins. The violin parts were very lively and quick; but the great
charm of the piece lay in some perfectly modulated chords of great
beauty distributed through the parts in a sustained, broad, searching
tone on the fourth string. Herr Veitch played the violoncello with
consummate skill. We had played the piece nearly through when
Adelheid suddenly ceased, and turned in the direction of the wider
lawns to which was access between the urns; and the next moment the
same lovely creature I had seen some days before, but now very
differently dressed, came through the opening in the low hedge,
accompanied by a beautiful young lady, evidently of high rank, whom I
also recognised as one of the ladies I had seen in the wood. The
Princess looked for a moment serenely at the group, who drew backward
a step or two and bowed very low; but the next moment, as her eyes
fell upon me, she flushed suddenly, and her face assumed an
expression of embarrassment, and even reproof.</p>

<p>'I did not understand that you had strangers here, Fr&auml;ulein,'
she said, and stopped.</p>

<p>'This, Royal Highness,' said Adelheid, bowing very low, 'is a
young gentleman, Otto von Saale, who is to play in the trio. It did
not occur to me to mention him to the Royal Highness.'</p>

<p>The Princess looked very disconcerted and mortified, but her
embarrassment only made the unique expression of her face more
exquisitely piquant and enchanting. I would willingly have risked
untold penalties to secure such a sight. The young lady who
accompanied her regarded me with an expression of loathing animosity
and contempt, as much as to say, 'What do you mean by using your
miserable existence to get us into this scrape?'</p>

<p>The Professor came to the rescue with great aplomb. Herr Veitch
evidently regarded the whole matter with lofty contempt.</p>

<p>'If the Royal Highness will deign to take a seat,' said the
Professor, 'she may still hear the trio rehearsed. We will regard
Otto as second violin merely. One violin is much like another.'</p>

<p>'Oh, sit down, my Princess!' said the young lady coaxingly; 'I
should so like to hear the violins.'</p>

<p>The Princess hesitated, and looked still more enchantingly
confused and shy, but she sat down at last. It was reported that, as
a boy, her brother, the Crown Prince, had been mortally in dread of
the Professor. It is possible that his sister may have conceived
something of a similar feeling. In spite of my excitement I had the
sense to take the greatest pains. I kept my attention perfectly fixed
upon my playing, and the clear notes of the great chords came in
perfectly true and in time. When we had finished there was a short
embarrassed pause. Then Adelheid whispered to me, 'Play that lesson
of yours of the woodland breeze.'</p>

<p>Scarcely knowing what I did I began to play; but I had not
finished the opening bars before a slight change in the attitude of
the Princess attracted my eyes, and suddenly, as if by inspiration, I
conceived the fancy that I was playing to a creature of the forest
and of the wind. She was sitting slightly forward, her eyes fixed
upon the woodland slope before her, her slight, lithe figure and
prominent speaking features like no offspring of common clay, but
innate in that primeval god-sprung race of the golden hours, before
the iron horny-handed sons of men had filled the earth with toil and
sorrow and grime: the race from which had sprung the creatures that
had filled romance with elf-legends and stories of elf-kings and
ladies and beings of gentle and fairy birth; for, as the untrammelled
wood-notes that stole across the strings now sunk into a whisper, now
swelled into full rich chords and harmonies, I could almost fancy
that I saw this glorious creature, while the mystic notes lasted,
grow into a more serene and genial life, as though she breathed an
air to which she was native, and heard once again the wild notes of
the hills and of the winds in the sere antique forest-country that
was hers by right of royal ancient birth.</p>

<p>As I played the concluding notes the Princess rose and stood
before us once again, as I had seen her stand in the forest-meadow
when she had pleaded unavailingly, in those marvellous tones which
would never pass from my memory, for the beautiful stag. Then she
bowed very courteously to the others, and, taking no notice whatever
of me, moved away, attended by her companion.</p>

<h3>Part 2</h3>

<p>NARRATIVE</p>

<p>There is a gap in Otto von Saale's autobiography which it may be
well to fill up from other sources, as we shall by this means obtain
a knowledge of some incidents of which he could not possibly have
been cognisant.</p>

<p>Two or three days after the rehearsal in the palace-garden the
Princess was seated in her own room in the palace, accompanied only
by her reader. The relationship between the two was evidently, in
private, of the most intimate character.</p>

<p>The room was high in the palace, and a surpassing view lay before
the windows. Immediately in front, over a terrace or glacis planted
with sycamore-trees, the roofs and gables and chimneys of the old
city lay like a great snake, or rather like several great snakes,
climbing the ridges of its steep streets, and crowned with the spires
and towers of its cathedral and churches and rathhaus and university
halls. Over and beyond this stretched a vast extent of wooded valleys
and hills, of forest and mountain and glancing river, of distant blue
stretches of country indistinguishable and unknown, and in the remote
distance along the sky-line a faint range of snow-clad peaks. A vast
expanse of cloudland, strange and varied as the earth itself, and
almost as tangible and real, filled the upper regions of this
landscape with motion and life and varied form. It was evening, and
the night-clouds had piled themselves in threatening and lurid forms
above the dark wind-tossed forest-land. The white smoke-wreaths from
the city curled up before the cathedral towers, and the storks and
kites in long trailing flocks wended their way home from the distant
fields. The Princess sat, still and silent, looking out over the wide
prospect, with searching, questioning eyes, that seemed to penetrate
beyond its farthest bound.</p>

<p>I am still listening,' she said at last, 'to that violin lesson
that the young man--Otto von Saale, did you call him?--played the
other day. Is he considered to be a great performer? In its echoing
repeats I seemed to hear voices that I had never heard before, and
yet which seemed as though they were the voices of my kin, that told
me whence I came, and who I was, and what I might become.'</p>

<p>'He plays with surpassing feeling,' replied Adelheid, 'and with
delicacy of shading and of touch, most surprising as he is only a
novice at the violin. You may judge of this when you remember how
simple the piece was that he played--a few chords constantly
repeated--yet he made them, as you say, speak to the heart, a
different utterance for every chord. His forte is expression.'</p>

<p>'Is he in love with you?' said the Princess, with the calmest,
most unmoved manner and tone.</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'You are in love with him?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I love him, for he is in every way worthy to be loved. But
it is of little importance what I think of him. He is hopelessly,
desperately, passionately in love with you.'</p>

<p>'In love with me?' The Princess did not move, and not the faintest
shade of deeper colour flushed her cheek; but the faint, shy, kindly
smile deepened, and the questioning eyes softened to an expression
which was certainly that of supreme, amused beneficence--possibly of
something else. 'In love with me! When did he ever see me
before?'</p>

<p>'He saw you some days ago in the forest: the day that the Prince
von Sch&ouml;ngau shot the stag.'</p>

<p>The Princess sat quite still, looking out upon the southern sky,
which was all aglow with a red reflected light. Long dark lines of
cloud, like bars of some Titanic prison-house, drew themselves out
across the sky; and the masses of cloud, tinged with a sudden glow of
crimson, formed a wild contrast with the faint blue of the dying sky,
and the green of the waving woodlands below. The deepening glow
spread higher over the whole heaven, till the world below became
suffused with its sober brilliance, and tower and gable and the
climbing ridges of the street and the white smoke-wreaths shone in
the mellow light. The distant stretch of country flushed with this
mystic light, which certainly was not of earth, seemed instinct with
a quivering life--the life of forest and farm-people--the life of
hidden townships too distant to be discerned--of rivers bordered with
wharves and shipping--the life of a kingdom of earth--and, in her
mountain eyrie, with set, wistful eyes, over the regions of her
father's rule, the Princess sat at gaze, a creature slight, shy,
delicate, yet born of eagle-race.</p>

<p>Her companion waited for some words, but they did not come: then
she spoke herself.</p>

<p>'He was born among the forests of the Fichtelgebirge and has
listened to the spirits of the wood and mountain from a child; that
is why he plays so well.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the Princess, 'that is why, in his playing, I heard a
talk that I had long wished to hear--a speech which seemed familiar
and yet which I had never heard here--the speech of a people from
which my race is sprung. And you say that he is in love with me?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Adelheid, somewhat sadly; 'at this moment he would
give worlds to see you again.'</p>

<p>'Oh, he shall see me again!' said the Princess, with her quaint,
shy smile: 'he shall see me again; he shall play before the King.
More than that,--he shall marry you!'</p>

<p>The King was a strikingly handsome, tall, distinguished man, of
between fifty and sixty years of age. His father had died when he was
a boy, and he had been brought up by his mother as regent of the
kingdom. She was a very clever woman, and surrounded her son with the
most able men she could attract to her court. She trained him in the
most exalted ideas of his position and responsibility, and when she
died, after having with much difficulty found a wife whom she
considered to be suitable for him, she left him, at the age of five
and twenty, profoundly impressed with the conviction that something
wonderful was expected of him in every action and word. As he was a
man of very moderate capacities, though perfectly good-natured and
conscientious, this impression might possibly have placed him in very
painful predicaments; but the King very wisely fell back early in
life on the obvious alternative of doing absolutely nothing and
saying very little. It may surprise some persons to be told how
wonderfully the country prospered under this imposing, but silent and
inactive monarch. He had been as a boy impressed with the misery of
some classes of his people, and he had been known as a young man to
absent himself from court for days together, and to wander, attended
only by one companion, among the poor and struggling classes; and the
only occasions on which he spoke at the privy-council were when he
advocated the passing of some measure which his plain common sense
told him would be beneficial to his people. He was therefore
immensely popular, and was thought, even by many of his familiar
courtiers, to be a man of remarkable ability. He had a habit of
repeating the last words of any one who spoke to him with an air by
which he seemed to appropriate all the wisdom which might be
contained in them to himself. 'I have been attending the
privy-council, sire.' 'Ah! you have been attending the privy-council,
yes.' And it really was difficult not to fancy that you had been
listening to a long and exhaustive treatise upon privy-councils
generally and their influence on the government of states; so perfect
was the manner of the King.</p>

<p>'Sire,' said the Princess to her father, the same evening on which
she had had the talk with Adelheid, 'I wish you to hear a young
performer on the violin, Otto von Saale, who is a pupil of Herr
Veitch. I heard him once by accident in Das Vergnugen. I wish him,'
continued the Princess, with serene candour, after a slight pause, I
wish him to marry the Fr&auml;ulein.'</p>

<p>'Yes?' said the King, 'you wish him to marry the Fr&auml;ulein? I
have observed, on more than one occasion, that efforts of this
character may be abortive.'</p>

<p>The King paused, as though on the point of saying more, but
apparently doubting whether he could safely venture upon further
assertion, he remained silent. After a pause he went on: 'You
consider this young man to be a promising performer?'</p>

<p>'His forte,' replied the Princess, 'as the Fr&auml;ulein says, is
expression. His playing has a strange fascination for me.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' replied the King, 'his forte is expression. Good! When do
you wish me to hear this young man?' he continued after a pause.</p>

<p>'I thought we might have a chamber-concert of music after supper,
on one of the evenings that the Prince von Schongau is here. Herr
Veitch and the Fr&auml;ulein will play.'</p>

<p>Except on occasions of great state the King and his family supped
in private, a second table being provided for the courtiers. A strict
etiquette was observed in the palace, similar to, and founded upon,
that of Versailles.</p>

<p>On the evening upon which the Princess had finally decided, a
somewhat larger company than usual assembled in the great salle. The
doors were thrown open shortly after supper, and the chamberlain with
his white wand announced, after the manner of the French Court:
'Gentlemen! The King!'</p>

<p>The great salle was floored with marble, and surrounded with
marble pillars on every side. A thousand lights flickered on the
countless jewels that decked the assembly. Great vases of flowers
filled the corners, and graced the tables of the room.</p>

<p>The King came forward with long accustomed composure to the seat
provided for him, near to a harpsichord in the centre of the salle: a
step behind him followed the Princess. She was en pleine toilette,
sparkling with jewels, and if Otto von Saale had had any worlds to
give, he might almost have been pardoned had he given them for such a
sight; for a creature more delicately beautiful--so absolutely set
apart and pure from aught that is frivolous and vain, and yet so
winning in the unconscious piquancy of her loveliness--he would
scarcely find elsewhere. She was followed by several ladies, and
three or four gentlemen, preceded by a prince of a royal house, who
had formed part of the King's supper-party, brought up the rear of
the procession.</p>

<p>The King sat in his chair a little in advance of the rest: on
either side of him were seated the Princess and the Crown Prince, and
the ladies and gentlemen who had had the honour of supping with the
royal party were seated behind them. Herr Veitch played the
violoncello, and the Professor was prepared to accompany on the
harpsichord.</p>

<p>The attitude and expression of the King were delightful to watch.
He sat back in his chair, his fingers meeting before his chest, a
faint smile of serene beneficence on his beautifully-cut features--a
gracious, presiding power of another and a loftier sphere.</p>

<p>One or two pieces were played first, then came a trio of
Corelli's, in which the harpsichord took no part.</p>

<p>Did it sound in the Princess's ear alone, or did there run through
all the wealth of pure harmonies a strange new quality of tone? Wild,
glancing, in tune yet untuned and untunable, like the silver thread
of the brooklet through the grass, or the single changeless woodnote
of the breeze wailing through the organ-harmonies of the midnight
mass in a mountain-chapel. It spoke to the Princess's heart, as she
sat some little space backward from her father's chair, her delicate
steadfast face fixed upon the scene before her, which, doubtless, she
did not see. It seemed to speak of an alluring lawlessness, of that
life of unconventional freedom, of that lofty rule and dominion over
their own fate and circumstance, of that free gratification of every
instinct and faculty, which has such an attraction to the
highly-born. It seemed to call her with a resistless power back into
a pristine life of freedom which was hers by right of ancient
ancestral birth, a world of freedom and love and unquestioned
prerogative which belonged to the nobles of the golden age. Almost
she was persuaded by the searching power of its magic note to believe
that all things belonged to the &eacute;lite of earth's children--the
favourites of life, those delicately nurtured and born to the purple
of the world's prismatic rays. Should she listen to this siren chord
it might even happen to her to lose that stainless insight which its
wild tone had itself evoked; but, in the perfection of a concerted
piece, its wild uniqueness was kept, by grace of finished art,
invariably true to the dominant concord of pure harmony, an existence
and creation as it were in harmonious sound, of which it formed a
part. To the Princess as she listened to the vibrating strings it
seemed that, with a vision beyond her years, so potent in suggestion
is music, she looked into another world, as one looks down from a
lofty precipitous height into the teeming streets of a great city,
and the pigmy crowds are instinct with a strange interest--a world of
human suffering and doubt and terror, of love unrequited, of
righteousness unrecognised, of toil and sorrow and despair
unrelieved, until, in the thronged theatres and market-places, where
life stands waiting its abiding doom--the times and seasons of the
world's harvest being fully ripe--the riddle of righteousness and of
wrong is answered, and in the sad gray dawn of the eternal day the
dividing sickle is put in.</p>

<p>There was a pause in the wave of sound, and the Princess was dimly
conscious that Otto von Saale was playing alone. So magnetic was the
searching tone that there seemed nothing in the wide universe save
herself and his strange impalpable personality that approached her in
mystic sound; but happily beyond and above its sorcery was once more
felt the sense of restraining, abiding, cultured harmony--the full,
true, settled chords, and the according regular law and sequence of
time and pitch.</p>

<p>Then she knew that all were standing up, and she rose in her seat
beside the King. A peculiar lustre of gracious courtesy shone in the
monarch's attitude and manner.</p>

<p>'Herr Veitch,' he was saying, 'we thank you: the Princess thanks
you. Herr von Saale, the Princess thanks you. I perceive--' here his
Majesty paused for a moment to give importance to what was to come,
'I perceive, sir, that your forte is expression.'</p>

<p>The most wearied cynic must have felt a glow of genuine pleasure
as the King said these words, so contagious was the regal, benevolent
satisfaction that the exigencies of the occasion had been fitly
met.</p>

<p>Otto bowed low before the King, then he turned to salute the
Princess; but, as he looked up, his eyes met her marvellous eyes and
were fixed by a magic spell, so intense, searching, personal and yet
abstracted was the look they met. His entire being was caught up and
rapt into hers in an ecstasy of ravishment. Had the gaze lasted
another second he must have fainted away.</p>

<h3>Part 3</h3>

<p>AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL</p>

<p>I did not go to Herr Veitch until some days after the concert at
the palace. Indeed, I did not care to go. I felt as though I had
broken with all continent and decorous life, and was entering upon a
delirious course of adventure such as I had read of in some fatal
romance of ill-repute, whose course was unnatural and ghastly even in
its delights, and whose end was tragic and disastrous. I was appalled
even at the splendour of my dream.</p>

<p>But when I did muster courage to go to the master, I was
astonished to find that nothing seemed to have happened at all.</p>

<p>Herr Veitch did not even appear to have noticed my absence. He was
in a very propitious humour, and complimented me very much on my
playing at the palace.</p>

<p>'I never knew you,' he said, 'play with so much certainty and
correctness. There is always in your playing a certain originality
which might become, as I have often told you, a great snare, indeed
fatal in its results. So long, however, as you play as
conscientiously as you did the other night, though there will always
be a singularity in your style to which some might object, yet you
will stand, to my mind, among the great performers on the
violin.'</p>

<p>I had never heard the old man utter such praise before.</p>

<p>Nor did I at first notice anything in the manner of the
Fr&auml;ulein towards me which would show that she was conscious of
the necessity for any change. But there soon came a change, which was
entirely of my own bringing about. I neglected the master and the
violin. I hardened my heart against the Fr&auml;ulein, and especially
avoided the hours when I thought she would be with Herr Veitch. Her
wistful eyes had no effect upon me, so foolish and delirious had I
become.</p>

<p>One day Herr Veitch said to me, 'Yesterday the Fr&auml;ulein
brought us great news. The Princess is betrothed to the Prince von
Schongau, who has been staying so long at the palace. He was present,
you remember, on the evening of the concert.'</p>

<p>I was conscious that my face wore a contemptuous, unbelieving
sneer. In my madness I thought to myself that I knew much better than
to believe such foolish gossip.</p>

<p>At last Herr Veitch took me seriously to task. 'Something has
happened to you,' he said. 'You are bewitched, some evil eye has
fascinated you. You are no longer the same sensible pleasant lad that
you were. The Fr&auml;ulein notices it also. She says she does not
know what is come over you. I tell her that all young men are
fools.'</p>

<p>I did not deign to answer the good old man, but left him with my
nose in the air. Indeed, I seemed to tread on air. I thought of
nothing but palace-gardens and Hyrcanian woods full of terrible
delights and secret pleasures. I believed myself to be altogether
separate from my fellows, and to be reserved for some supreme
exceptional fate. I am not willing to dwell longer than I can help
upon this period, the remembrance of which is most distasteful to me.
I shall have to describe at some length the supreme and crowning act
of folly, and this must suffice the reader.</p>

<p>But in simple honesty, and to relieve my own conscience by public
confession, I must relate one incident, so fatuous and unworthy was
it, so nobly and graciously forgiven and condoned. I had not been to
Herr Veitch for many days; but one morning an unconquerable impulse
forced me to visit him. I believe that I was impelled, with all my
assumed scepticism, to seek more tidings of the Prince von Schongau
and his reported espousals. I had quite lost count of the
Fr&auml;ulein's mornings, and, indeed, I am ashamed to say, that I
had ceased to think of her. I was therefore somewhat chagrined when,
on entering the room, I found myself in her presence, as well as in
that of Herr Veitch. My manner must have been singularly constrained
and boorish, and I could see that the master regarded me with
disapproval, not to say contempt. In spite of my affected
indifference, I could see that Adleheid was watching me with wistful
and pitiful eyes. Some evil demon made my heart harder and more
scornful than ever; and I conceived the most hateful and injurious
thoughts against one whose sweetness and devotion ought, on the
contrary, to have filled me with affectionate devotion. I played
badly, and this only increased my spiteful and angry mood. So violent
did my passion and an evil conscience at last make me, that I threw
down my violin in a fit of ungovernable temper and rushed out of the
room. I wandered restlessly about the streets for some time, in a
kind of frenzy against mankind in general, my mind filled with the
image of the Princess, and with a sense of intolerable wrong that my
exceptional fortune was not recognised by all the world,--so
confident was I in my infatuation. At last it suddenly occurred to me
to go to the theatre, where the Fr&auml;ulein had said the royal
family were expected to be present. Lost in the crowded and
enthusiastic audience, which would doubtless fill the place--the
report of the betrothal being spread throughout the city--I might see
the Princess and indulge a secret sense of my exclusive fate.</p>

<p>When I entered the theatre at the bottom of the Peterstrasse,
however, I found a rumour already current that the King was not well
and could not be present, and that the Princess refused to come
without him. Whether the strange Crown Prince would visit the theatre
alone, no one seemed to pretend to know.</p>

<p>I shall remember that evening as long as I live. The little
old-fashioned theatre, as I know now it must have been, so different
from the great theatres I have since seen at Dresden and Berlin,
seemed to me, then, to be the most gorgeous of pleasure-places,
blazing with lights and crowded with what was to me a gay and
brilliant throng of superbly dressed and ornamented people. I found a
vacant place in the pit near the orchestra. When I entered the
curtain had not risen, but the orchestra were playing. The band
consisted mostly of violins, and would, no doubt, be considered poor
and thin at the present day, but such music has, to my mind, a
subtle, delicate tone which is missed now. I did not know what the
overture was, and curiously enough I have never heard it again:
probably it was some local composition; but there is sounding in my
ears, as I write, the simple, thrilling air, the recurring chords.
The music ceased and the curtain rose.</p>

<p>Up to this time the royal box opposite the stage had remained
empty, and the audience had manifested a restless impatience which
paid no attention to anything, either in the orchestra or upon the
stage; but the actors had hardly begun their parts when the
attention, which was now being attracted towards them, was suddenly
diverted in another direction, and a young distinguished-looking man
entered the royal box. His breast was a mass of stars and orders, and
the rest of his apparel was covered with embroidery and lace; but his
tall, slight figure, and the careless self-respect of his manner,
enabled him to support so much finery with success. He came down
without pause to the front of the box and remained standing, while
the actors, dropping their parts, sang a verse of the National
Folk-song, accompanied by the audience and supported by the band. The
Prince bowed once slightly, then stood quite still, facing the
enthusiastic house. From his point of view, doubtless, he saw a
waving sea of faces, tumultuous, indistinguishable, indistinct; but
in my eyes, and to my thought, as I stood lost in the tossing,
excitable crowd about me, there was no one in the whole theatre but
myself and him. As I looked at him a wild antagonism, an insane
confidence and desire to pit myself against him, took possession of
me. My folly even went so far as to picture to my mind a lovely,
broken-hearted creature, bound to a betrothal odious to her,
stretching out her hand towards another fate. The Prince had sat down
in his box, slightly wearied in his daily round of life, not
expecting very much entertainment from the play; more pleased,
perhaps, at the gay scene the crowded theatre itself presented to his
eyes, perfectly unaware, certainly, of the ferocious glances one of
the audience in a remote corner was directing towards his unconscious
person.</p>

<p>I spent the ensuing night and day in a fever of passionate
excitement; but on the next afternoon an event occurred which reduced
every other consideration to worthlessness, and exaggerated the
delirium from which I suffered to the highest pitch. On my return to
the 'Three Roses' from attending a lecture of the university--for I
did attend lectures sometimes--I found a royal footman waiting for me
with a note from the Princess. The world seemed to swim before my
eyes as I took the billet from the man. It had been given him by the
Princess herself, he said, who had charged him to deliver it to no
one but myself.</p>

<p>I opened the billet and read: 'The Princess Cynthia will be in Das
Vergn&uuml;gen, on the terrace above the cascades, this evening at
eleven o'clock. She wishes to see Herr von Saale there without
fail.</p>

<p>Even in the state of exaltation in which I had lived for some
days, I could scarcely believe my senses. Yet there could be no
possible doubt that the message was a genuine one. The billet was
distinguished from ordinary letters by its paper, and was closed with
a massive seal bearing the royal arms.</p>

<p>To this moment it is a mystery to me how I passed the intervening
hours from the time the man left me till eleven o'clock. I know that
at the time the thought of this necessity overwhelmed me with
despair. I have some misty recollection of wandering down the valley
by the river, of gibbering passing forms which with intolerable
intrusion seemed to force themselves between me and the only
conceivable event towards which all human history had been tending
since the world began.</p>

<p>The garden of Das Vergnugen was defended against intrusion by
natural boundaries, very slightly assisted by art. The valley on the
palace-side was impregnable, and the steep, rocky, wooded slopes on
the farther side of the river were so inclosed at the top as to
render intrusion difficult or impossible. The right of entr&eacute;e
was given me through my connection with the Professor and the
Fr&auml;ulein, and I had no difficulty in obtaining it on this
momentous night.</p>

<p>Mysterious shadows, dark and vast under the pale moonlight, the
great trees and banks of leaves, rose in strange distinct outline on
every side, as I made my way through the lawns and garden-walks. The
nightingales were singing all around me: the festoons of roses,
robbed of all colour by the pallid light, hung like the ruined
garlands of a dead festival, and sheets of clematis fell like
cascades from the tall hedges and forest trees, and filled the air
with a stifling perfume that presaged decay. Every now and again a
strange whispering music stole through the valley and along the
wooded slopes, the echo of wind-harps and harmonica-wires concealed
among the terraces and groves. As the night advanced and the moon
sank lower in the sky, the starlight grew more intense, with a clear
distinct light, in which the sharp dark outlines of the shadows stood
out in weird contrast with the beauty which, even in the moment of
startled terror, the heart felt to be around. The wayward music that
strayed through the leaves, and the fine clear notes of the
nightingales, that harmonised with the cold silver light in which
valley and river and stone terrace lay in mystic unreality, seemed
like a fatal spell to enslave my spirit, a ghost-melody, a pale,
beckoning hand to entice me on. And it was not only that these sights
and sounds of a pallid and even terrifying beauty lured me on, but my
infatuation was so perfect that I traversed the lawns and terraces in
the full expectation of finding at the trysting-place the most
lovely, the most unique of creatures, a creature born to be the
possession and the delight of her own race and kind, and of such
only, to whom it would seem presumption and treason for any other
even to look. Long years afterwards, writing in the cool blood of
middle life, the remembrance of this folly makes me shiver with an
intolerable shame; but at the moment, so potent was the wizard spell
that untamed, unquestioning youth and the wild, romantic
wood-teaching, and the autumnal music of the winds, and the
well-spring of fresh hope and love and trust, bursting out like a
clear fountain amid the flowering grass and woodland singers, had
cast about my path that, as I passed the terraces and the arcades of
roses and clematis, I believed confidently that in another moment I
should have the Princess, blushing, shy, palpitating, in my arms.</p>

<p>I turned a terraced corner bordered with statues and urns, and
shaded with tall yew and holly hedges that grew high up in the woods.
I came upon a broad and long terrace, shining in the clear light. On
the left hand, far above me, from the mountain summit a single broad
cascade fell, like a wall of flashing molten silver, sudden and
straight into a deep pool, from which by several outlets, formed by
the piers of the terrace-bridge upon which I stepped, it fell again,
in four or five cascades of far greater depth, into the valley
beneath.</p>

<p>The moon, which was setting a little behind me, cast a full and
strong light upon the broad terrace--a light as bright as day. As I
turned the corner my heart almost ceased to beat, for I saw, not a
dozen yards from me, the Princess herself coming forward to meet me,
as it seemed with outstretched hands. The bright light revealed in
perfect distinctness the soft, gracious outline of her slight figure
and the shy expression of her face. I made a step forward, my heart
leaping to my mouth, when suddenly it sank again with a sickening
chill, for behind the Princess, only a few steps apart, was the
strange Crown Prince, and close to him stood another figure, which I
also recognised at once.</p>

<p>The Princess came forward with her faint, bewitching smile.</p>

<p>'You are here, Herr von Saale,' she said: 'I knew you would not
fail. We are an awkward number for a moonlight stroll, and I wanted a
companion for the Fr&auml;ulein.'</p>

<p>A sickening sense of self-recognised, self-detected folly--folly
too gross and palpable, it might be feared, to escape even the
detection of others--crushed me to the earth.</p>

<p>What would have happened, what inconceivably fatal folly I might
have committed, I cannot tell--a mad whirl of insane thought rushed
through my mind; but the Princess kept her steady eyes fixed full
upon mine. 'Herr von Saale,' they said, as plainly as, ay, plainer
than, words could speak,--'Otto von Saale, I believe in you. You have
taught me something that I never knew before. You have taught me what
I am, and you have shown me what I may become. You yourself surely
will not fail.'</p>

<p>The steady, speaking eyes, calm in the pale white light--the
intense, overmastering power and thought--drew me out of myself, as
at the evening concert at the palace; but now, thanks to the purpose
and command that spoke in them, with a fortifying help and strength.
The boyish nature, fascinated and uplifted even in the depths of its
folly and shame, rose--thanks to her--in some sense equal to the
pressing need. Surely she must be right. Behind Otto von Saale, the
fool, there must be another Otto von Saale who would not fail.</p>

<p>Something of what was passing in my mind rose, I suppose, into my
eyes, for the expression of the Princess's face changed, and an
inexpressibly beautiful look came into her eyes, amid the quaint
reserve which her rank and disposition gave to her habitual look. It
seemed to speak, with a start of grateful joy at the sudden gift, of
certain abiding faith--faith in herself and in me--faith in the full,
pure notes of life's music, which they who are born of the spirit, in
the turmoil of the world's passion and desire, alone can hear.</p>

<p>The Princess turned away very quietly towards the Crown Prince.
'You remember Herr von Saale the other evening?' she said; and his
Royal Highness bowed.</p>

<p>They moved together towards the other end of the terrace, and I
approached Adelheid.</p>

<p>It may be thought that I must have found some difficulty and
confusion in speaking to her; but, strange as it may appear, it was
not so. It seemed to me as though the demon of vanity and folly had
been completely exorcised, as though the courage and faith that shone
upon me from the Princess's eyes had blotted out and effaced the
miserable, infatuated past as though it had never been. It is given
to some natures, at some propitious moments at the turning-points of
life, by a happy acquiescence in right doing to obliterate the evil
past. The intolerable sense of disgrace and shame had, as it were,
stung the lower, vain reptile-self through its vital cord, and it lay
dead and withered in the way. The flattering mask was torn from its
features, and nothing was left but a shudder at the memory of a
creature so contemptible and vile.</p>

<p>I told Adelheid that I did not know how to excuse my conduct of
the last few days, that some demon seemed to have possessed me, that
Herr Veitch had said truly that this was the case, and that I had
been fascinated--by some evil eye, I was about to say; but I stopped
suddenly, remembering that the eyes that had fascinated me had been
those of the Princess, those eyes that had restored me to the
dominion of the higher self. Escaping from this pitfall as best I
could, I promised that I would return to my practising, and this
brought us to the end of the terrace, where was a flight of stone
steps that led down into the valley. Here the Princess turned to us
and said that she wished to show the Prince the cascades from the
steps, some little way down: they would return to us immediately on
the terrace. They went down the steps and we turned back along the
terrace-walk.</p>

<p>The moon by this time had set, and a countless host of stars lit
the arched sky above us; and over the leafy walls on every side,
darkened and deepened in shade, a delicate, faint, clear light seemed
to chasten and subdue the heart--the starlight of the soul. There was
no sound but that of the rush of water, for the nightingales and the
wind-harps were too far below. There seemed to arise around us, and
to enwrap us in its emboldening folds, a protecting mist and garment
of solemn, faded light and measured sound. Enshrouded in this mystic
veil fear and embarrassment were taken away, and in clear, true
vision we saw each other for the first time.</p>

<p>'You have taught me the violin,' I said; 'but there is another
instrument, the strings of which vibrate to even higher tones: will
you teach these strings also to vibrate in unison to your touch? It
has been neglected, and is out of tune: it wants the leading of a
master-hand.'</p>

<p>'I fear the instrument is accustomed to another hand,' Adelheid
said.</p>

<p>'A violin,' I said, 'is played on by many a one, and they fail;
but it is not cast aside. At last he comes for whom it was
predestined long ago, while the wood was growing in the tree, while
the mellowing sunshine and the wind were forming it--were teaching it
secrets that would fit it to teach mankind in sound. He to whom it
was predestined comes. He takes it in his hand, and we know that
once, at least, in this life, supreme music has been heard. Will you
try this instrument of mine? It may, perchance, be worth the trying,
for it is a human heart.'</p>

<p>'I will try it,' she said.</p>

<p>There is not much more to tell. He that is happy has no history;
and the life that is in tune with the melodies of heaven, in tune
because it is guided by a purer life, inspired by a loftier impulse
than its own, cannot fail of being happy. In the sustained and
perfect harmonies that result from the concord of full, pure, true
notes, there is rest and peace for the wearied and troubled brain;
and the harmonies of life, that absorb and hush the discords of the
world, are heard only in the private walks and daily seclusions in
which love and Christian purity delight. Both harmonies came to me
through a teacher of the violin.</p>

<p>And the Princess?</p>

<p>One summer afternoon in the year 1806 a gay city lay smiling in
the afternoon sun. It lay in a fair plain watered by shining streams,
and surrounded in the blue distance by wooded hills. The newly-built
esplanades stretched away into the meadows, and from among the
avenues of linden-trees the birds were singing merrily. But a fatal
spell seemed to hang over this lovely scene, and the city might have
been a city of the dead. Not a chance figure could be seen in its
streets and boulevards: the windows of its houses were all fastened,
and the blinds and jalousies drawn down and closed.</p>

<p>And more than this: every few moments a deathly terror tore the
serene, calm air, and, alighting like a shrieking fiend, crashed into
house and grove. The Prussian army was in full retreat across the
fords of the river lower down, and the city was being bombarded by a
battery of the French.</p>

<p>The blinds in the long streets were all drawn and the shutters
closed; but there was one house in which not a blind was down nor a
window closed. This was the palace, which stood in the centre of the
city, looking upon the Grand Platz, and surrounded by chestnut and
sycamore trees. The King was with the army on the distant Thuringian
slopes; but it was known through all the city that the Queen was
still in the palace and had refused to leave; and in the hearts of
the citizens, wherever a few met together, or in the homes where they
spoke of this, despair and anguish were soothed into gratitude and
trust.</p>

<p>But gradually as the evening drew on matters became worse. The
terrible cannonade, it is true, ceased; but a party of French
chasseurs, followed by infantry, occupied the market-place, and the
work of plunder was systematically begun. The crash of doors burst in
and the shrieks of the inhabitants were heard on every side. At seven
o'clock in the summer evening houses were in flames in front of the
palace, and the light was so intense that people could read
handwriting, both in the palace-court and in the market-place.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, a most wonderful thing occurred. The great iron
gates of the court-yard, which had remained closed, were thrown open,
and a state carriage, gorgeously caparisoned and drawn by six white
horses, accompanied by servants in full liveries, issued forth in the
evening light, amid the added glare of the flaming houses. It passed
on its stately way through the crowded, agitated Platz, the lawless
soldiers standing back astonished and abashed, till it reached the
great hotel of the 'Three Kings,' where a marshal of France, a
brother-in-law of the Emperor, had taken up his quarters for the
night an hour before. It did not remain long; but in a few moments it
was known throughout the city that the Queen's intercession had
prevailed, that orders had been given to extinguish the
conflagration, and that the pillage would immediately cease.</p>

<p>The people, young and old, swarmed into the streets. From by-lane
and causeway and boulevard, rich and poor, without distinction, child
and old man and grandam, crowded around the stately carriage with the
white horses, wherein sat a beautiful woman of middle age, serene and
stately, but very pale with long watching and with grief. Sobs, and
words of blessing, and cries of love and joy, resounded on every
side; but amid that countless throng there was no heart so full of a
strange pride and gratitude to God as was that of an unknown
stranger, by chance in the city, standing unnoticed in the dark
shadows of the palace groves. I knew her--had known her longer than
they all; for it was the Princess Cynthia of the old, unforgotten,
boyish days.</p>

<h2><a name="s4"></a>THE BARONESS HELENA VON SAARFELD.</h2>

<p>Travelling in Germany on one occasion, I passed the evening at a
small inn among some mountains with a middle-aged man whom I soon
discovered to have been an actor. In the course of the evening he
told me the outlines of the following story, together with much
interesting detail relating to an actor's life. I have endeavoured to
work into the story what I could recollect of his observations, but
not being able to take notes at the time, and having little intimate
knowledge of German life, I have lost much of the local colouring and
graphic detail which interested me so much at the time. This short
introduction will suffice.</p>

<p>In a considerable town in Germany (said the actor) there have been
for several generations a succession of dukes who have patronised the
German theatre and devoted the principal part of their revenue to its
support. In this city I was born. My grandfather had been an actor of
some repute, whose acting in some of his principal characters
Schiller is said greatly to have admired. His son, however, did not
follow in his father's art, but degenerated, as most would call it,
into a stage-carpenter and inferior scene-painter. He was, however, a
man of considerable reading, and of a certain humour, which mostly
took the form of bitter sarcasm and dislike of the theatrical
profession. From my birth he formed a determination to bring me up as
a printer, for besides that his fondness for reading naturally caused
him to admire the art by which books are produced, he believed that
education would make gigantic steps within a few years, and that in
consequence printers would never want for occupation. In this
expectation, at any rate in one respect, he was mistaken.</p>

<p>Upon the production of a new piece which the reigning Duke had
himself written, the juvenile actor who was to have taken a boy's
part sickened and died, and the company did not at the moment possess
any child who was fitted to take his place. My father was requested,
or rather commanded, to allow me to learn the few words attached to
the part. He was extremely averse to the proposal, but was compelled
to consent, the matter appearing so trifling. The play was very
successful. The applause was unanimous, and indeed was so
enthusiastic that, not satisfied with lauding the talent of the noble
author and with praising the intelligence of the chief actors who had
so readily grasped the intentions of genius, it had some encomiums
left for the child actor, and discovered a profound meaning in the
few words the Duke had put into my mouth, which it asserted I had
clearly and intelligently rendered. The Duke, pleased at finding
himself so much cleverer than even he had ever suspected, joined in
the applause. He never failed to testify his approbation at the way
in which I piped out the very ordinary words of my single line, and
finally, when the play was withdrawn for a time, he sent an order to
my father to repair one summer afternoon to the ducal Schloss which
overlooked the town. I have since sometimes thought that it was
curious that this play, so full of genius and of humour, was not
re-acted even on this partial stage oftener than it was, and that, in
all the theatres of Germany where I have played my part, I never once
saw it performed, nor even so much as heard it mentioned; so
difficult of recognition is merit in my profession.</p>

<p>The ducal Schloss rose directly above the tall houses of the
superior quarter of the town, the backs of which looked out upon
forest trees which had been planted, and had grown to great size,
upon the steep mountain slope upon which the Schloss was built. My
father, taking me by the hand, led me up the winding road, defended
at the angles by neglected towers, which led to the castle gardens.
On the way he never ceased to impress upon me the misery of an
actor's life.</p>

<p>'The poorest handicraft,' he said, 'by which a man can earn his
crust of bread in quiet is preferable to this gaudy imposture which
fools think so attractive. In other trades a man is very often his
own master, in this he has so many that he does not even know which
to obey. In other trades a man has some inducement to do his best, in
this to excel is in most cases to starve. The moment an actor ceases
to assist the self-love of his fellow-actor, or to minister to the
worst passions of his auditors, he is hated or despised. He works
harder than the simplest journeyman for poorer pay, he is exposed to
greater risk of accident, and the necessities of his part require
such a delicacy of organisation that the least accident ruins it.'
The great trunks of the trees were throwing a fitful shadow over the
steep walks as my father, still holding me by the hand, poured these
dolorous opinions into my ears, and we reached the long terraces of
the ducal gardens.</p>

<p>We were passed on from one gorgeous domestic to another until at
last we found ourselves before the chasseur, a magnificent man of
gigantic height, but with an expression of face perfectly gentle and
beautiful. I had often noticed this man in the theatre, and had
always thought that he would be admirably fitted to represent St.
Christopher, a picture of whom hung in my mother's room. He surveyed
us courteously and kindly, and informed us that the Duke was taking
his wine with a friend on one of the terraces on the farther side of
the hill. Thither he led us, and we found the Duke seated at a small
table in front of a stone alcove ornamented with theatrical carvings
in bas-relief. The view on this side avoided the smoke of the town
and commanded a magnificent prospect of wood and plain crossed by
water, and intersected by low ranges of hills. The afternoon sun was
gilding the tree-tops and the roofs and turrets of the Schloss behind
us.</p>

<p>The gigantic chasseur introduced us to the Duke, who sat at his
wine, together with a gentleman of lofty and kindly expression, whom
I never saw before or since. On the table were wine and dried fruits.
I remember the scene as though it had occurred only yesterday.</p>

<p>'Ah, my good Hans,' said the Duke--he prided himself on his
accurate acquaintance with every one attached to the theatre, and my
father's name was Karl--'ah, my good Hans, I have sent for you
because I have taken an interest in this little fellow, and I wish to
make his fortune. I will take his future into my hands and overlook
his education in his noble profession of player.'</p>

<p>My father looked very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>'Pardon, your highness!' he said, 'I do not design him for a
player. I wish him to be a printer.'</p>

<p>The Duke raised his hand with a magnificent gesture as of a man
who waives all discussion.</p>

<p>'My good fellow,' he said, 'that is all past. This boy has
developed a talent for the highest of all possible professions. He
has shown himself unconsciously appreciative of genius, and able to
express it. His future is mine.'</p>

<p>My father looked very downcast, and the gentleman who sat by the
Duke, with a kindliness of demeanour which has endeared him to me for
ever, said--</p>

<p>'But this good man seems to have decided views about his own
son.'</p>

<p>'My dear Ernest,' said the Duke, 'on every other subject I am most
willing to listen to, and to follow, your excellent advice, but on
this one topic I think you will admit that I have some right to be
heard. We have here,' he continued, leaning back in his chair, and
waving his two hands before him, so that the fingers crossed and
interlaced each other, as his discourse went on, with a continuous
movement which fascinated my eyes, 'we have here the commencement of
an actor's life. We look forward into the future and we see the
possibility of an existence than which nothing more attractive
presents itself to the cultured mind. What to other men is luxury is
the actor's everyday life. His ordinary business is to make himself
familiar with the highest efforts of the intellect of his day, but
this even is not all; every movement of his life is given to the same
fascinating pursuit; whenever he walks the street he is adding to his
store; the most trifling incident--a passing beggar, a city
crowd--presents to him invaluable hints; his very dreams assist him;
he lives in a constant drama of enthralling interest; the greater
stage without is reflected on the lesser stage of the theatre; his
own petty individuality is the glass in which the universal intellect
and consciousness mirrors itself. It is given to him of all men to
collect in his puny grasp all the fine threads of human existence,
and to present them evening after evening for the delight, the
instruction, and the elevation of his fellow-men. We have before us
an individual, small, it is true, and at present undeveloped, before
whom this future lies assured. Shall we hesitate for a moment? This
worthy man, looking at things in a miserable detail, sees nothing but
some few inconveniences which beset this, as every other, walk in
life. It is fortunate that his child's future is not at his
control.'</p>

<p>My father said nothing more; but as he was shown off the final
terrace by the least gorgeous of the domestics, he muttered to
himself so low that I could only just hear him, 'We shall see what
the mother will say.'</p>

<p>But--when we reached our house, which was a lofty gabled dwelling
in the poorer part of the town, but which had belonged to my
grandfather and to his father before him, and had once been a
residence of importance; when we climbed to the upper story and found
ourselves in the large kitchen and dwelling-room which commanded
views both ways, into the street and to the ramparts at the back--he
got no help from his wife.</p>

<p>My mother did not like reading, and even thought in her secret
mind, though she did not say it aloud, that her husband would be much
better occupied in working for his family than in puzzling his brains
over the pages of Kant. She had, therefore, no great admiration for
the great printers of the day, nor was Johann Gutenberg likely to
replace St. Christopher over her bedside. She knew nothing of the
vast stride that education was about to make, nor of the consequent
wealth that awaited the printer's craft, but she did know the theatre
and she knew the Duke. That the Duke had promised to make her son's
fortune was not denied; surely there was little left to desire. It
was decided that night that I should be an actor.</p>

<p>'My son,' said my father, some time afterwards, as he took me to
the lodgings of an actor who had promised to teach me to repeat some
famous parts, 'my son, I have not been able to train thee to the
occupation which I should have desired. I pray God to assist thee in
that which fate has selected. I have one piece of advice which I will
give thee now, though I hope I shall be able to repeat it often.
Never aspire to excellence; select the secondary parts, and any fine
strokes of acting which you may acquire throw into these parts. In
this way you will escape the vindictive jealousy of your fellows; but
if unavoidably you should attract such ill-feeling, leave the theatre
at once, travel is much as possible, act on as many boards as you
can. You will achieve in this way the character of a useful player
who is never in the way. In this way, and in this only, you probably
will never want bread; more than this I cannot hope for.'</p>

<p>I shall not weary you by relating the story of my education as an
actor; it will suffice to say that I found neither my father's
estimate of the profession, nor that of the Duke, to be precisely
correct. If on the one hand I have found littleness and jealousy to
exist among players, on the other I have seen numberless acts of
unpretending and self-denying kindness. It must be remembered fiat
the actor's life is a most exciting and wearing one, and most certain
to affect the nerves and make a man irritable and suspicious. His
reputation and his means of existence are dependent upon the voice of
popular applause--an applause which may be affected by the slightest
misunderstanding or error. It is no wonder, therefore, that he is apt
to take alarm at trifles, or to resent with too much quickness what
seems to be a slight or an unfairness. With regard to the Duke's
ideal view of the profession, I did not find this even altogether
without foundation in fact. I found, amidst all its trivialities and
vexations, the player's training to give an insight into human life
in all its forms, and to encourage the study and observation of the
varieties of city existence more than perhaps any other training
does. I studied the works of the great dramatists and novelists with
attention, not only for my own parts, but that I might understand the
parts of others. I followed my father's advice throughout my life. I
confined myself systematically to secondary parts, but I watched
carefully the acting of the great players, and endeavoured to lead up
to their best effects, and to respond to the emotions they sought to
awaken. By this means I became a great favourite among the best
players, for it is surprising what an assistance the responsive
action of a fellow-actor is in obtaining an effect, while on the
other hand it is very unlikely that the attention of the audience
should be diverted from the principal actor by what tends indeed to
increase the impression he makes. Several of the greatest actors then
in Germany often refused parts unless I played the secondary
character. I was not particular. I would take any part, however
unimportant, provided my salary was not reduced in consequence, and I
endeavoured to throw all my knowledge and training into any part I
undertook. By this means I became a great favourite with authors,
who, if they are worth anything, endeavour to distribute their genius
equally among their characters, and whom nothing irritates so much as
to see everything sacrificed to promote the applause and vainglory of
a single performer. I grew up, much to the surprise of all who knew
me, a very handsome young man; and I generally took the parts of
lovers, when these were not of the first importance, such, for
instance, as the part of Romeo, which, true to the rule I had
adopted, I never attempted. In this way I had visited most of the
cities of Germany, and was well known in all of them, when, at the
request of one of the chief actors of the day, who studied the parts
of the great tragedies which he undertook with the most conscientious
care, I accepted an engagement at the theatre of one of the great
cities of the empire, to which he had also engaged himself for a
considerable time.</p>

<p>The theatre was a large one, and the company numerous and varied.
I might occupy you for a long time with divers descriptions of
character and with the relation of many curious and moving incidents,
but I do not wish to make this a long story, and I will therefore
confine myself to the chief events.</p>

<p>The German stage, as you are aware, is different from your own in
England, in that it does not present such marked contrasts. There is
a great gulf, as I understand, between your highest actors and your
pantomime players; but this is not the case in Germany. As far as I
can understand, we have nothing resembling your pure pantomime, and
what we have which resembles it is introduced in interludes and
after-pieces, and is taken part in, to a considerable extent, by the
same actors who perform in the more serious pieces. There was, for
instance, in the theatre to which I was attached, an old actor named
Apel, who would take the part of grave-digger in Hamlet, and the same
evening, in the after-piece, act the part of what you call the clown.
This part on any stage is the one most liable to accidents, and this
man, in the course of a long professional career, had met with
several, in falling through trap-doors open through the carelessness
of carpenters, or stumbling over unforeseen obstacles. These
accidents had seriously affected his physical system, and he was
rapidly becoming a helpless cripple. He had one child, a daughter,
who danced, for a German, with remarkable grace and agility, and sang
with a rich and touching voice. Of all the avocations which necessity
has forced the unhappy daughters of man to adopt--</p>

<p>'The narrow avenue of daily toil.<br>
For daily bread,'</p>

<p>that of a pantomime dancer, who has a song, is the hardest. I have
stood upon the stage by such a girl as this, and marked the panting
exhaustion with which she completed her dance, and the stupendous
effort with which she commenced her song. Even without the exertion
of the dance, I know of few things more touching than to see a girl
labouring conscientiously through a long, and possibly an
unattractive song, before a wearied and unsympathising audience who
reck nothing of the labour, the pains, and the care which the
performance involves. The girl of whom I speak, whose name was Liese,
had her share, and perhaps more than her share, in this hard lot. She
was a fine German girl of no particular talent, but perfectly
trained; she came of a family of actors, and displayed a kindliness
of disposition and a devotion which were truly German. As her
father's incapacity increased, her exertions redoubled. While they
both were able to take their full part, the income of the pair was
comparatively ample; but as he was obliged to relinquish part after
part of his accustomed performance, she redoubled her exertions, and
took every trifling part which was in kindliness offered her by the
management. I acted with her in innumerable parts of light comedy as
lover and sweetheart, as brother and sister, as betrayer and victim,
and, in turn, as jilted and deceived. I have never been able to this
day to decide whether I was really in love with her or not, but I
rather think my feelings were those of a devoted and affectionate
brother, and I am certain of this, that no man ever reverenced a
woman more than I did this girl. At last the old man's paralysis
became so confirmed that he could scarcely stand; he had to be
carried to the side scenes, and went through hours of agony when his
short part was over.</p>

<p>One afternoon, about this time, after rehearsal, at which neither
father nor daughter had been present, and whose fines for
non-attendance I paid, a proceeding which, as I was known to be so
intimate, passed as a mere matter of arrangement between ourselves, I
went, at the request of the manager, to inquire whether either would
be present at the evening performance.</p>

<p>Herr Apel had been obliged to leave his former lodgings owing to
the reduction of his earnings, and I had not far to go to the dreary,
shabby street near the theatre, where he occupied two rooms on the
first floor. Liese received me in one of the lower rooms, and I
noticed a strange expression in her face which I had never seen
before.</p>

<p>'We could not come to the rehearsal,' she said; 'we have been
rubbing him all day, and he has been in such pain! I do not think
that even he can possibly play to-night. We have our fines
ready.'</p>

<p>'There is no question of fines,' I said, 'with you. You do not
think so badly of Herr Wilhelmj as that, I hope.'</p>

<p>She looked at me curiously, but made no remark. After a pause she
said--</p>

<p>'I sometimes think that nursing him and seeing him suffer affects
me too. I feel at times a strange numbness and pain stealing over me.
What would become of us if I became like him!'</p>

<p>'You must not think of such things,' I said; 'you have plenty of
friends who will help you in every way. Let us go up to him.'</p>

<p>We went together upstairs into a little room where the old clown
lay. He had the expression of an idiot, and seemed absolutely
crippled and helpless; but I was not surprised at this, for I had
seen him even worse before, and known him act the same evening with
much of his old genius and fire. It was a most extraordinary fact
that this man, helpless and idiotic to the last inch of the side
scenes, regained, the moment the footlights flashed in his face and
he saw the crowded theatre before him, all his strength,
recollection, and humour, and went through his part apparently
without an effort, only to collapse the moment he tottered behind the
scenes.</p>

<p>He was whining and moaning as I sat down beside him on the
sofa.</p>

<p>'No one pays any attention, no one takes any care of me,' he said;
'I am a poor old man. I have entertained people in my day--thousands
and thousands; no one does anything for me. My daughter, even, does
nothing; she might do much, but she does nothing; she is only
thinking of herself and her own gains.'</p>

<p>She stood leaning on the end of the couch, looking me full in the
face with a sad, but not unhappy, look in her eyes. I could return
her glance freely. The old man's state was so evident, it did not
embarrass any one whatever he said. She leaned over her father.</p>

<p>'Shall you play to-night, papa?' she said: we used many French
words in the theatre.</p>

<p>A contortion of pain passed over the old man.</p>

<p>It was a curious thing, but as I half rose, involuntarily, to
help, I saw the same spasm of pain pass over the daughter's form, and
she seemed bent down for a moment by it; then she stood upright, and
looked at me with a wistful, earnest, inquiring gaze.</p>

<p>It is just possible--at this hour I do not think that I
should--but still it is just possible that I might have asked what
she had in her thoughts, when the door opened, and a female servant
announced--</p>

<p>'The Count von Roseneau.'</p>

<p>I rose in my seat as a very handsome young man, of some two and
twenty years of age, came into the room. He was well known to us all
as a constant frequenter of the green-room, as you call it in
England. He spoke kindly to the old man, who seemed to brighten at
his presence, nodded to me, but took little notice of Liese. I know
not what prompted me, but I stood for a moment silent, comparing
myself with him. He was handsome, though of a more boyish style of
beauty than mine; he was noble, though said not to be rich. He was
far from clever, and of very moderate education. I was handsomer than
he, trained in every art that makes the possessor
attractive--elocution, gesture, demeanour; my mind stored by the
intelligent familiarity with the highest efforts of human genius; yet
it never occurred to me to put myself for a moment into competition
with him. After a few ordinary phrases, I took my leave.</p>

<p>From this day it seemed to me that Liese was more distant and
reserved with me; she seemed, too, to act with indifference and even
carelessly, and to be often distraite and forgetful. Her father grew
worse and worse. He crept through his part, the mere shadow of his
former self. At last the manager informed his daughter that it was
impossible to allow him to appear any longer upon the stage.</p>

<p>'We will give him a benefit,' he said, 'in a week or two, at which
all the strength of the theatre will assist. He shall be brought on
in a chair, and shall sing his popular song. That must be the
finale.'</p>

<p>In about a month's time the benefit took place. The theatre was
crowded, everything being done to make the entertainment attractive.
Several actors came from distant cities to take part in the
performance, for the old clown was one of the best-known men in the
profession, and was associated with pleasant recollections in the
memory of most players. Two favourite pieces were given with great
applause, and in the interval Herr Apel was brought in in a chair,
which was placed in front of the footlights, and sang his song.</p>

<p>To the last moment, and even as he was carried across the stage,
he seemed almost insensible of what was passing, but once in front of
the lights, and of the great theatre rising tier over tier before
him, every one upon his feet, with waving of handkerchiefs and fans,
and a tumult of applause and of encouraging cries, he raised himself
in the chair, his ace assumed the old inimitable comic expression,
and amid the delighted excitement of the vast crowd, he gave his song
with as much power and wit as he had ever done in the course of his
long career. Nor was this all, for the song being over, and the last
two verses given twice, in response to the repeated encore, the long
applause having a little subsided, the old man rose, and, without
help, tottered forwards towards the lights, and amid the breathless
silence of the house, and with a simple dignity which contrasted
touchingly with his feebleness and his grotesque dress, spoke a few
words of natural regret, of farewell, and of gratitude for the
favours of a lifetime. He even, in the concluding sentence, turned
slightly to the stage, which was crowded, and included his
fellow-actors in the expression of kindly reminiscence and thanks.
The excitement was intense. Men wept like children, not only in the
theatre but on the stage; many women fainted, and it was some time
before the curtain could rise again for the second piece. Herr Apel
was taken home in a comatose state, and scarcely moved or spoke again
during the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>Two days after this performance, as I was leaving the theatre
after the morning rehearsal, I was accosted by a tall chasseur, who
reminded me instantly of my old friend, St. Christopher, in the ducal
court.</p>

<p>'Sir,' he said, with great deference, 'the Baroness Helena von
Saarfeld wishes to speak with you in her carriage, which is close
by.'</p>

<p>I followed the man to a handsome carriage which was standing a few
doors from the stage entrance, a little way down the street. There,
as I stood bareheaded at the open door, I saw for the first time the
most beautiful woman, without exception, that I have ever seen.</p>

<p>Helena von Saarfeld was the only child of the late Baron, who was
enormously wealthy and possessed of vast ancestral estates. He was a
man of great intellect and of superior attainments, and he undertook
the entire education of his only child and heiress. Helena was taught
everything that a man would know, and her father discussed all social
and religious questions with her. He held very singular opinions upon
social problems, and in religion he was much attached to the mystical
doctrines of the Count Von Zinzendorff. At a very early period he had
contracted his daughter in marriage to the young Count von Roseneau,
to whose father he had been much attached; but as the boy grew up,
having been deprived early, by death, of his father's care, the Baron
became dissatisfied with the young man, and it was well known that at
his death, which had taken place about two years before I saw his
daughter, he had left a codicil to his will entirely exonerating her
from any obligation to the young Count, and leaving her future
destiny in her own hands, expressing every confidence in her judgment
and discretion. All these facts were known to me as I approached the
carriage.</p>

<p>The Baroness was at this time between two and three and twenty, in
the full possession of her youth. She was of a perfect height, with
brown hair, lighter than her eyes, and beautifully cut features; her
mouth was perhaps rather large, but this only increased the wonderful
effect of her smile, which was the most bewitching ever seen. She
spoke with animation, and her smile was so constant that the most
wonderful thing about it was that its charm never flagged. This was
the woman who was presented to my gaze as I stood in the sunshine
bareheaded by the carriage-door.</p>

<p>'I have wished to speak to you, Herr Richter,' she said, throwing
a world of fascination into her face and manner is she spoke; 'will
you oblige me by driving a short distance with me in the carriage? I
will not take you far out of town.'</p>

<p>I entered the carriage, and the coachman having orders to drive
slowly, we passed through the crowded streets.</p>

<p>'I was at the theatre the other night,' the Baroness said, 'and I
was extremely touched, as, indeed, we all were, at the sight of that
poor old man; though I do not know that I should call him poor who
all through his life has contributed to the gaiety and innocent
enjoyment of the world, and could at his last breath speak words so
touching and so noble as he did. May I ask of you, Herr Richter, what
will become of him--I am so ignorant of these things--and whether it
were possible for one like I am to help him in any way?'</p>

<p>'I shall be very glad, Madame la Baronne,' I said, 'to undertake
to apply any help you may be most kindly disposed to afford. I am
very intimate with Herr Apel, and can easily find ways of doing so;
and I fear, from what I know of his circumstances, that any aid will
be most welcome.'</p>

<p>'That was what I feared,' she said; 'and it seems to me so sad
that such should be the end of a life of toil like his!'</p>

<p>I saw at once that the Baroness was saying these last words by way
of introduction to something else, and I did not reply. Probably she
noticed this, for she said without the slightest hesitation--</p>

<p>'He has a daughter, I believe.'</p>

<p>'He has,' I replied.</p>

<p>'She is a very clever actress, I am told.'</p>

<p>'She is a very conscientious, hard-working artiste,' I replied,
'and has, for a German, remarkable grace, and she sings
charmingly.'</p>

<p>'And she is a very good girl.'</p>

<p>'She is one of the best girls I ever knew. She is devoted to her
father, and, I fear, is injuring herself by her exertions to make up
the deficiency which is involved in his failing health. She is a
thoroughly true and excellent girl.'</p>

<p>The Baroness looked at me for a moment before she replied; then
she said--</p>

<p>'You speak, Herr Richter, as I was given to expect. Fr&auml;ulein
Apel is fortunate in having so true a friend.'</p>

<p>There was a pause. I knew something was coming, but I did not know
what. Then she said, still without the slightest hesitation--</p>

<p>'The life of an actress is a difficult and exposed one, Herr
Richter?'</p>

<p>'It is, Madame la Baronne; but like all other ideas, this one has
been exaggerated. A girl in this, as in other walks, has ample means
of protection, and I have never heard that Fr&auml;ulein Apel has
even needed such.'</p>

<p>She looked at me again for a moment. I began to think that she was
the most lovely creature that ever walked the earth.</p>

<p>'But gentlemen and nobles court their acquaintance a good deal, do
they not? This must be a great temptation in their sphere of
life.'</p>

<p>'Some gentlemen frequent the greenroom,' I replied, 'and are fond
of talking to the actresses. In some theatres it is forbidden.'</p>

<p>'Has Fr&auml;ulein Apel any friends of this kind?' said the
Baroness; and now for the first time I detected a slight hesitation
in her manner; but it was so trifling that no one but an actor would,
I think, have perceived it. 'The Count von Roseneau, for
instance.'</p>

<p>'The Count is a frequenter of the theatre,' I said, 'and I have
seen him speaking to Liese--to Fr&auml;ulein Apel--in fact, I have
met him at her house.'</p>

<p>The Baroness was looking straight before her now. She said without
hesitation, but still seriously--</p>

<p>'I fear that any acquaintance between them will not be for
good.'</p>

<p>There was a pause. I scarcely knew what to say. It was the
Baroness who broke it.</p>

<p>'I will not take you farther out of your way,' she said. 'I do not
ask you to understand me, or not to misinterpret anything that I have
said, for it is notorious that Herr Richter can do nothing but what
the noblest gentleman might think. I hope I may see you again.'</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the superb courtesy with which she
said this. The carriage was stopped, and I alighted, and made my
adieux.</p>

<p>As I walked back into the city, pondering over this strange
interview, I made up my mind decisively that, in spite of any
obstacle and misunderstanding, the Baroness was deeply attached to
the Count von Roseneau. You will have an opportunity of judging for
yourself whether this was the fact or not, but I ask you to remember
that this was the impression upon my mind, because it probably
influenced my after conduct in an important crisis.</p>

<p>After this, matters went on for some time much as usual. The
Baroness sent me several sums of money, which I tried to appropriate
to the wants of Herr Apel and his daughter, but I found more
difficulty in doing this than I expected. Liese showed a shyness and
reserve towards me which I had never seen before. Once or twice I
thought I noticed the same wistful glance that I had noticed before,
but there was no reason why I should inquire into her thoughts, and I
did not do so. I adopted the simple plan of placing the money in
comparatively small sums in the old man's hand, and I have reason to
know that he immediately gave them to his daughter. Matters went on
in this way for some time.</p>

<p>At last one evening there was a second piece at the theatre which
somewhat resembled the first part of you pantomimes. There was a kind
of love-story running through it, but broken in upon by every kind of
absurdity. We had played Hamlet for the first piece, considerably cut
down, in which I took the part of Horatio. The actor who played
Hamlet said courteously to me amid the applause that closed the
play--</p>

<p>'Half of this, Richter, belongs to you,' and insisted on taking me
by the arm as he went before the curtain.</p>

<p>I played the lover in the second piece. I had noticed during the
evening that the manner of Liese was unusually excited; she spoke
much, and to every one; she was unusually friendly with me, and when
the piece came on she took every opportunity of clinging to me, and
playing her part in the most lively and charming way. I never saw her
look more attractive. Towards the end of the piece, when the climax
of absurdity was nearly reached, there was a scene in which the King,
the Lord Chancellor in his robes, and the two lovers meet in conclave
to consult partly over state affairs, and partly over the fate of the
two latter. Towards the end of the consultation, apparently as a
relief to more serious business, it occurs to the Chancellor to sing
a song and dance a hornpipe. After performing his part to admiration,
and careering round the stage several times, he disappeared through
the side scenes, and the King, inspired apparently by his example,
waved his ball and sceptre, advanced to the footlights, and, singing
his song, also danced round the stage, his robes greatly encumbering
him, and, finishing up with a pirouette, which under the
circumstances was highly creditable, also vanished from the scene. It
then came to my turn, and leaving the side of Liese, by whom I had
stood hitherto, I also sang two verses of a popular melody, and
finished by a dance; as I came back, amid applause, Liese regarded me
with a glance full of kindliness and congratulation, and glided
forward to the footlights with the most graceful motion, to sing her
song. I did not leave the stage, but stood watching her. She wore the
dress of a Swiss country girl, and I some picturesque lover's
costume. I noticed an unusual stillness in the crowded theatre, and
fancied something uncommon in the rich tones of her voice. She was
encored, and repeated the last verse; then she commenced her dance,
coming round the stage three times. Each time that she passed me she
made a graceful motion of her hand, to which I replied by kissing the
tips of my fingers in an attitude of extreme devotion, which indeed
was little exaggeration of what I really felt. After the third time
she came forward to the footlights, and made her pirouette higher
than usual, amid a thunder of applause. Then she fell, flat and
motionless, upon the boards.</p>

<p>I had her in my arms in a moment. There was a rush of actors upon
the stage, and the curtain fell with a crashing sound. We could hear
the excitement and confusion amid the audience without. The manager
went before the curtain in response to repeated calls, and said that
an unfortunate accident had happened to Mademoiselle Liese. Except as
far as she was concerned the piece would go on. He begged the
forbearance of the audience for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had carried Liese to a couch. She was quite conscious
and spoke, but she could not move a limb. She never moved again.</p>

<p>Amid the crowd around her, some one at last forced his way. I
turned and recognised Von Roseneau.</p>

<p>'Richter,' he said, 'my carriage is close at hand; we will take
her home.'</p>

<p>His manner was so wild and excited that I turned and looked at
him. He was not in his evening dress, but appeared dressed for a
journey.</p>

<p>'You do not generally have your carriage here, Count,' I said.</p>

<p>'No,' he replied distractedly; 'but for this accursed accident she
would have been mine to-night.'</p>

<p>I looked at him for a moment.</p>

<p>'The paralysis is, then, only half to blame, Count von Roseneau,'
I said.</p>

<p>We saw no more of the Count, and learnt that he had left the city.
It appeared that he was deeply in debt, and, though he evidently had
considerable sums of money at his control, that his person was not
safe from arrest. The family estates had been heavily encumbered even
in his father's time, though had he lived he would probably have
succeeded in freeing them from debt. The Count had deposited a sum of
money with an agent to be applied to the support of Herr Apel. Some
days afterwards the agent called upon me and informed me that this
sum was still at our disposal. I declined to receive it.</p>

<p>It seemed that, uncertain of my feelings towards her, haunted by a
terrible dread of approaching paralysis, and overwhelmed with the
charge and burden of her father's state, Liese had yielded to the
proposals of the Count, which promised ease and luxury to them all.
If I could have made up my mind sooner, had I spoken to her more
openly and freely, and endeavoured to win her confidence, it might
have been different. Poor Liese!</p>

<p>I will tell you what we must do, Liese,' I said as cheerfully as I
could two days after the accident, as I was sitting by her bed. She
had recovered so far as to be able to move one arm a little. 'I will
tell you what we must do. You must marry me. We will then live all
together and take care of the old man as long as he lives. Then when
you have rested a long time and got quite well, we shall be as happy
as the day is long.'</p>

<p>And so--I am telling a long story--we settled it. The Baroness
came to see Liese several times. We were married in her room by a
priest--most of us actors profess to be Catholics--and the Baroness
was present at the ceremony. We moved to an old house in a better
part of the town, where we had a large room with a long low window at
either end commanding cheerful views, the one into a market place,
the other over the distant country with mills and a stream. Here
Liese lay in a clean, white bed, with the old man seated beside her;
he became much quieter and gentler after he had given up acting; and
in the same room we had our meals, and lived. We were rather
straitened for money, for now that I was bound to the city and
theatre by my wife's state, some little advantage was taken, and I
was told the theatre could not afford so high a salary. It is the way
of the world. Indeed we should have been very poorly off, more than
once, but for the Baroness, who sent me money openly from time to
time. I took it without hesitation. One day she came to see us when I
was at home, and remarked how comfortable we were in our large room,
and the cheerful picturesque view at the back, like a landscape by an
old master, and how happy the old man seemed. When she went down to
her carriage, and I was handing her in, she said, looking straight
before her, and with a kind of strange scorn in her voice--</p>

<p>'There is some difference, Herr Richter, between a noble of the
empire and you!'</p>

<p>We went on in this way for more than a year. I was content enough;
indeed, I should have been a wretch to have been impatient, for I
knew it could not last very long. The doctors went on giving us hopes
and expectations, but I knew better. I could see that the malady was
gradually stealing over Liese's faculties and consuming her life. She
had lost the use of both arms, and would lie for hours without the
least sign of life, and she took nothing but a little broth. The old
man died first: he went away very peacefully in his chair in the
evening sunlight, saying that it was time to dress. Some two months
after his death, I was sitting by Liese in the afternoon, learning my
part. It was autumn, and the room was full of a soft light; opposite
to the bed was an old clock, upon the dial of which was an accidental
mark. I had noticed that if I left when the minute hand reached this
mark, I could reach the theatre easily without hurry. I sat watching
the hand slowly approaching the spot. The room was perfectly still,
nothing but the loud ticking of the clock being heard. The hand was
within three minutes of the mark when Liese, who had lain motionless
and unconscious for hours, suddenly stirred. I turned towards her in
surprise; she looked up full in my face and smiled, and at the same
moment she raised her right arm, which had never moved since the
fatal night, and held out her hand to me. I grasped it in mine, and
the next moment she was gone.</p>

<p>I acted that night as usual, for the public must not be
disappointed. But I took a holiday soon after, and went a tour
through the mountains. Not that I wish you to suppose that I was
overwhelmed with grief; on the contrary, now that I have no
temptation that way, I am ashamed to remember that I felt a sense of
relief. Were the temptation to occur again, no doubt I should feel
the same.</p>

<p>When I returned from my little tour I found myself courted. Now
that I was free to go where I liked, the management suddenly found
that I was very useful, and offered me a considerable increase of
salary to remain. Indeed, I was so flattered and courted that I
became somewhat vain and light-headed. I dressed finely, and went
much into society, for I was invited to some of the best houses in
the city as an agreeable and entertaining guest. I saw the Baroness
frequently, and was always invited to her garden--parties, which she
received at a small but beautiful ch&acirc;teau, a mile or two from
the city, by the stream which flowed before poor Liese's room.
Indeed, I was quite at home at the ch&acirc;teau, and the servants
treated me almost as an inmate.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of one of these parties, about two years after
Liese's death, the Baroness took an opportunity, as she passed, to
say to me--</p>

<p>'I am going to-morrow to spend a few days at Saarfeld, which I
think you have never seen. It is a strange, old, romantic place among
the Bavarian Alps, and I think would please you. I wish you would
arrange to come over and stay a night or two. I shall be quite alone,
as I go on business of the estate.'</p>

<p>I promised to go.</p>

<p>As the travelling chaise wound up from the valleys by long and
gradual ascents, and the beauties of the mountain forests revealed
themselves one by one, I seemed to be entering an enchanted land of
romance and witchery. Light mists hovered below the lofty summits,
and over the thick foliage of the oaks and beech-trees. They were
illumined with prismatic colours by the slanting sunbeams which shot
in strange and mystic rays through mountain crag and forest glade,
throwing up portions in wild relief and depressing others into
distant shade. The huts of hunters and woodmen, and the wreaths of
smoke from the charcoal burners, were the only signs of life in this
wild land of forest and hill. The lofty woods of black pine climbing
the higher summits shut in the view on every side.</p>

<p>At last I reached the ch&acirc;teau, which stood high up in the
forest, commanding an extensive and surprising view.</p>

<p>It was indeed a strange, wild old place of immense size, with long
rows of turrets and windows, and massive towers of vast antiquity. We
entered a court-yard, surrounded by lofty walls, so completely
covered with ivy that the windows could scarcely be seen. It seemed
as though the real and living world were entirely shut out and lost
sight of. The whole place, however, was in perfect repair, and was
richly furnished. The staff of servants was ample. The majordomo, who
always accompanied his mistress, welcomed me with great kindness. The
Baroness, he said, was at that moment engaged with the steward; if I
would take some slight refreshment after my journey, she would
receive me presently in the grand salon. I was shown into a
dining-room, where a slight repast was awaiting me.</p>

<p>The rooms were hung with portraits of the old barons of Saarfeld,
with tapestry of strange device, and with still stranger pictures of
the old German and Italian masters, and were furnished with cabinets
and sideboards, evidently of extreme antiquity. The sense of glamour
and of mystery increased upon me at every step; I seemed to be acting
in a wild and improbable piece.</p>

<p>When I had taken what refreshment I wanted, I asked to be shown my
room that I might arrange my dress before seeking the Baroness. I had
scarcely finished before the major-domo again appeared, and informed
me that his mistress was waiting for me in the grand salon. I found
this to be a magnificent apartment, with a long row of lofty windows
in deep recesses overlooking the wild forest. Tall portraits of more
than life-size hung upon the walls, and a massive stone
chimney-piece, the height of the room, and carved with innumerable
devices, fronted the windows. The polished oak floor would have been
dangerous to walk on, but an actor is always equal to such feats.</p>

<p>The Baroness was standing in the centre of the vast room, which
was clear of furniture. I seemed to see her at last in her full
perfection, as though such a lovely creature required such a setting
as this before she could be fully and perfectly seen. She was easy
and composed, and began to speak at once.</p>

<p>'I wish to tell you, my dear friend,' she said, why I have asked
you to come here, because it is only fair to you that you should know
it at once.'</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, and I could only look at her in silent
admiration. I had not the remotest idea what she was going to say,
but it seemed to me more and more that I was acting a strange and
unnatural part.</p>

<p>'You are aware, my dear friend,' she repeated, 'that my father had
some thought of marrying me, had he lived, to the Count von Roseneau,
but long before his death he saw in that unhappy young man what made
him change his intention. He spoke to me often with great freedom on
this as on every other subject; it was the wonderful privilege which
I enjoyed with such a father. He spoke to me much of the relationship
between man and wife, of the peculiar duties and trials of each, and
of the necessity of long and careful thought and of seeking for the
best guidance in such a matter. He impressed upon me the value of
eternal principles rather than of accidental forms; and though he
insisted continually on the necessary observance of outward forms and
decencies, yet he pointed out to me that circumstances might arise
where all the necessary principles and qualities which alone give
forms any value could exist, though some of the form itself might
appear wanting. Finally, in the most solemn manner he assured me, and
confirmed it in his will, that he was perfectly satisfied to leave
the matter in my hands, convinced that I should follow out the great
principles upon which his life had been based, and show myself worthy
of the confidence and education he had bestowed upon me. I believe
that I am about to act in a manner that would meet his full approval.
I believe that those circumstances have actually arrived which he
foresaw, and that I have found the man whom he would welcome as a
son. I offer you my hand.'</p>

<p>She pronounced these words, even to the last, without any hurry of
manner or the slightest sign of excitement beyond the charming
animation with which she always spoke. You will naturally suppose
that their effect upon me was overwhelming, but if so you are
mistaken. It has been a matter of profound astonishment to me, in
every succeeding moment of my life, that I acted as I did.
Afterwards, of course, reasons appeared which justified, and even
approved in the highest degree, my conduct; but that, at the instant,
when in another moment I might have had this glorious creature in my
arms, I should have remained unmoved, has never ceased to fill me
with astonishment. I can only account for it by one wild and
seemingly improbable supposition. You will not believe it, but I am
firmly convinced that during the whole interview I thought that I was
on the stage, I thought that I had a part given me, and that I spoke
words which I had already carefully conned. I am the more convinced
that this was the case because I made no longer pause than would have
been proper could you conceive such a scene to be enacted upon the
stage.</p>

<p>'Baroness,' I said, and I see the words now before me as plainly
as if I read them from a play-book, 'Baroness, it cannot be necessary
to say that the offer you have made overwhelms me to the earth. I do
not use such phrases as gratitude, and favour, and condescension;
words at any time are unequal to the task of expression, and to use
them now would only be an insult to your heart and mine. But I should
be utterly unworthy of the amazing regard which you have shown to me,
and of the undeserved approbation with which your own goodness has
led you to regard me, were I to hesitate fir a moment to urge you to
reflect before you commit yourself to such a step. You have yourself
allowed that your father insisted on the necessity of submission to
the forms and decencies of outward life. Think or a moment of the
consequences to yourself of such a step as you now, with the sublime
unconsciousness of the highest natures, propose to me. You have
created out of your own nobleness an image which you call by my name,
but you will find the reality an idol and a delusion, and you will
find the world's verdict, on the whole, to be right. I entreat you to
pause.'</p>

<p>'Herr Richter,' she said, looking me full in the face, and no
language can express the beauty of her confiding glance, 'every word
you say only confirms my choice. I offer you my hand.'</p>

<p>This second trial was very hard.</p>

<p>'My conscience is not at rest,' I said. 'I entreat you to
reflect.'</p>

<p>A very slight shade passed over the beautiful face, and a look of
something like incredulity came into the wonderful eyes.</p>

<p>'You refuse my offer?' she said.</p>

<p>'I entreat you to weigh well what I have said.</p>

<p>'I might well say, Herr Richter,' she said, 'that there is some
difference between you and other men.'</p>

<p>There was a pause. The interview became embarrassing. I turned
slightly towards the window, and it occurred to me to walk into the
embrasure and look out. When I turned round, after a minute or two, I
found that the Baroness had taken advantage of my action and had left
the room.</p>

<p>I went out into the park. The moment I was alone a host of reasons
rushed into my mind, all of them insisting with one voice on the
propriety of the course I had, as it were involuntarily, taken. I was
firmly convinced that whether she knew it or not the Baroness was
attached with all the tenacity of her girlhood's recollections to the
Count von Roseneau. Supposing this to be the case, I could well see
that the position, when novelty had played its part, of the
player-husband would not be a dignified or enviable one. I knew, none
better, the effect of the overpowering sympathies of rank and class,
and of the revulsion which inevitably follows action, which is the
result of excited feeling. I knew the ultimate irresistible power of
the world's verdict. Of course some demon might have suggested that I
should take the temporary wealth of delight which was offered to me,
and, when the inevitable catastrophe came, go my quiet way unharmed,
but I should hope that there are few men who would desire a temporary
pleasure at so stupendous a cost.</p>

<p>I wandered in the park and forest for a couple of hours. Then I
came back to the ch&acirc;teau. I was uncertain what to do, but I did
not like to leave without seeing the Baroness again. I went to my
room. Here I found one of the valets arranging my toilette for the
evening. I had not been in the room many minutes before the majordomo
entered. His manner was even more urbane and polite than in the
morning.</p>

<p>The Baroness, he said, earnestly hoped that I would favour her
with my company at dinner; the meal would be served in less than an
hour.</p>

<p>The man's manner was so marked that I could not help looking at
him. Was it possible that the household could have any idea of what
had taken place?</p>

<p>I found the Baroness in an antechamber which opened upon one of
the lesser dining-rooms. There were several servants standing about
between the two rooms, but she seemed utterly indifferent to their
presence. Her manner was perfectly unembarrassed, and she came
forward to greet me, holding out her beautiful hand.</p>

<p>'My dear friend,' see said, 'I feared you had left Saarfeld in
displeasure. I hope you will not deprive me of what I value so
highly. I have quite recovered from the little natural vexation I
felt at your refusal of my offer. I will not offend again. Let us go
to dinner.'</p>

<p>'On one condition, Baroness,' I said, as I gave her my arm, 'that
you are not too fascinating. I might take you at your word.'</p>

<p>'Your chance is gone by, sir,' she said, with a delightful moue.
'The ivory gates are closed.'</p>

<p>I still felt as though I were performing in a play. I never
exerted myself to please as I did that night. When the evening was
over, I said, 'I fear I shall not see you in the morning. I must be
at the theatre to-morrow night.'</p>

<p>'I shall not stay here many days,' said the Baroness. 'You must
call on me the moment I return, my friend.'</p>

<p>I raised the hand she gave me, and kissed the tips of her fingers,
but I did not press her hand. When a man is walking in slippery
places he is wary of his steps.</p>

<p>I visited the Baroness immediately on her return, and found her as
friendly and unembarrassed as ever. The months glided by with great
quietude. The theatre was under good management; it was prosperous,
and the best actors frequently visited it. It was one of those
halcyon periods which visit all theatres at times. My popularity
increased, and I could have demanded almost any salary. I was invited
to other cities, but these visits I made very sparingly. What,
however, might perhaps have been expected occurred, and caused me
great annoyance. A report spread through the city that I was about to
be married to the Baroness. It was universally believed.</p>

<p>'Have you heard the news?' men said one to another. 'The beautiful
Helena von Saarfeld, for whom princes were not high enough, or
cultured, or religious enough, who was almost too good to walk the
earth, is going to marry Richter the player! What do you think of
that?'</p>

<p>'Have you heard the news, Herr Richter?' said the Baroness one
afternoon as I entered her drawing-room.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said. 'It has annoyed me beyond expression. Who could
have originated such a report?'</p>

<p>'Oh,' she said, with a bewitching under-glance of her eyes, 'such
things cannot be hidden. It is not my fault that it is not true.'</p>

<p>'That is all very well, my pretty friend,' I thought to myself,
'while the Count is away and out of mind, but what will happen should
he return?'</p>

<p>I was congratulated on all hands, and could only deny that there
was a word of truth in the report.</p>

<p>'It is most annoying to me,' I said. 'I shall have to give up
visiting the Baroness.' My friend would not hear of this, however,
and seemed to take every opportunity of appearing with me in public.
This had very much the desired effect, for when people saw we had
nothing to conceal, they grew wearied of talking about us, and the
matter pretty much dropped.</p>

<p>One evening as I was dressing in the theatre I received a note
from the Baroness, asking me to come to her ch&acirc;teau the next
day at one o'clock, without fail. I was true to the time, and found
her in a little morning-room where she transacted business. She
seemed excited beyond her wont.</p>

<p>'My dear friend,' she said, 'I have sent for you because I want
your advice and protection. I have good reason to know that I am
safer in your care than I am in my own. There was a man here
yesterday, a kind of Jew lawyer, who made an excuse to see me, though
his business might well have been settled with the agent. When he had
said what he had to say, however, he became very mysterious, and said
that he had lately seen the Count von Roseneau, and that he had
something to communicate which it very much concerned me to hear. His
face wore a low, cunning expression as he said this, which disgusted
me, and I told him that I had nothing to say on such subjects to him,
and that if he had anything to communicate it must come through my
agent. He told me he could tell it to no one but myself. I thought
immediately of you; and told him that if he liked to call here
to-morrow at this time I would ask a gentleman, a very intimate
friend, to be present, and then he could say what he wished. He
hesitated at this, but I turned my back upon him, and left the
room.'</p>

<p>'Do you know any evil of the man?' I asked.</p>

<p>'I know nothing of such people,' she said scornfully. 'I know no
more evil of him than I do of a toad, but I shudder at both.'</p>

<p>The man was speedily announced. He was evidently of the lowest
type of his profession, and had a mean and hang-dog look. I do not
know whether he knew me or not, but he took little notice of any but
the Baroness.</p>

<p>He began his tale at once.</p>

<p>He had lived in Berlin, where the Count von Roseneau was, and had
been engaged in some inferior business connected with the mortgage on
the Count's estates.</p>

<p>'The Count's affairs,' he said, 'were getting more and more
involved; he was deeply in debt, was very short of money, and indeed
had been more than once under arrest. The mortgages were foreclosed
on all his estates, and the estates themselves offered for sale, when
one day, going over some deeds in the office of the lawyer who was
engaged in managing what little remained to do on his behalf, I
discovered a most important memorandum, signed by the Count himself.
It is not necessary to explain before the Baroness,' he continued,
turning to me, 'the exact nature of the complicated business, but you
will understand that the paper had been given in lieu of deeds which
never seem afterwards to have been executed, and was the sole
evidence which decided the possession of the estates, or, at least,
of the most considerable one. It had been inclosed by mistake in a
parcel of copies that had been returned to the Count. I found him
alone, and placed the paper in his hands. It was some time before he
understood its character, but when at last he was convinced that its
possession restored him to wealth and honour, a singular expression
came into his face.</p>

<p>'"This is a nice homily, my good fellow," he said, "on you men of
business, with all your chicanery of deeds, and evidences, and
papers, and signing, and counter-signing, and all the rest of the
devil's game. What do you want for this paper? You did not bring it
for nothing, I presume."</p>

<p>'"Well", I said, "a thousand marks would not seem too much for
such a service."</p>

<p>'"A thousand marks," said the Count, rising, "is all I have in the
world; nevertheless I will give it for this paper."</p>

<p>"I should think so," I said. "A thousand marks are not much for
estates and wealth."</p>

<p>'The Count went to his secr&eacute;taire, took out a rouleau of
gold, and handed it to me.</p>

<p>Then he sat down again, and looked at the paper steadily for some
time.</p>

<p>'"Neat," he said to himself more than to me: "pretty, very pretty,
but not my style; never was the Von Roseneau style, that I ever
heard."</p>

<p>'Then he bowed me politely out of the room. What happened I heard
from his valet. As soon as I had left the Count sat down at the
secr&eacute;taire, wrote some lines in an envelope, fastened up the
paper in it, directed it, and called the servant.</p>

<p>'"You will take this to the address," he said, "and give it to the
principal. If he is out, wait for him, though it be all day. You will
give it into no hands but his. Tell me when it is done."</p>

<p>'The Count is now,' continued the Jew, 'in absolute penury. He has
applied for a commission in the Bavarian Infantry, which he is
certain to receive. The miserable pay will be all he will have to
live on. He has business in this city which requires his presence. I
expect him here, for a few hours, in a day or two.'</p>

<p>The Baroness rose from her chair, and I could see that she was
pale.</p>

<p>'You will settle with this--this gentleman,' she said to me, and
left the room.</p>

<p>'Well,' I said to the man. 'You want something for the
communication, I suppose?'</p>

<p>I saw that he did not know who I was, for his manner was
deferential, as to a gentleman of rank.</p>

<p>He said he left it to the Baroness.</p>

<p>I gave him a heap of notes, as I knew it would be the Baroness's
wish, and he left well satisfied.</p>

<p>I went into the drawing-room to the Baroness.</p>

<p>She was standing in the window, looking at the gorgeous flowers
that were heaped together in profusion--a soft and pensive light in
her eyes. She was evidently thinking of the Count, and of their early
days.</p>

<p>Her attitude and expression were so lovely that I stopped
involuntarily to gaze. She looked up, and saw, I suppose, something
in my look which she had not seen before, for she flushed all over,
and said, with a softened, pleased expression, which was bewitching
to see--</p>

<p>'You are a strange man, Richter; I know you love me.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I love you, Baroness,' I said, 'better than I love
myself.'</p>

<p>'That is nothing,' she said, flushing again. 'Do you think I did
not know that? Do you think I should have acted as I have done had I
not doubted whether in all Germany, nay, in Europe itself, there
could be found a man so good as you!'</p>

<p>'Let us hope, Baroness, for the sake of Europe, there may be a
few.'</p>

<p>'Well,' she said, sitting down, 'I want you to do something for
me. A very little thing this time. I want you to find out when the
Count comes, to go to him, and to get him to come over to Saarfeld to
me.'</p>

<p>'What are you going to say to him?' I said.</p>

<p>She looked up suddenly, as in anger, but the next instant a
touching look of humility came over her face, and she said--</p>

<p>'I am going to make him the same offer that I did to you,
sir!'</p>

<p>I shook my head. 'Do you know so little of your own people--of
your own order--as that,' I said. 'He will refuse.'</p>

<p>'I am not only a noble,' she said, almost pitifully, 'I am a woman
too.'</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then she said, 'Why do you say that he will
refuse?'</p>

<p>'He has the distinguishing vice of his order,' I said, 'insolent,
selfish pride. It is notorious that he took great umbrage at what he
considered interference in his affairs by your father and yourself,
and at the blame which the breaking off of the match implied. He will
think that you make him the offer now out of pity. H is pride of race
will rebel, and he will refuse a future, however splendid, marked by
favours received and restrained by gratitude, and, he may even think,
by compulsion. I have a better plan. I will seek him out; and it I
find that he does not refuse to talk with me, and I do not see why he
should, I will let him understand that you are kindly disposed
towards him. I will recall his early days, and I will endeavour to
make him believe that he is performing a chivalrous action, and
forgiving injuries, and is conferring rather than receiving a favour.
I hope to succeed. You said to me this morning that you were safer in
my keeping than in your own. Trust to me now, though God knows I only
do it to please you I am not responsible for the result.'</p>

<p>'No,' said the Baroness, getting up from her seat. 'I am a woman,
and I will go my own way. I will have him at Saarfeld, where we were
so happy as children. I will tell him all myself.'</p>

<p>'She trusts to her charms,' I said as I left the house. 'It cannot
be wondered at. Come what may, I will not marry her. The world shall
never say that this divine creature married Richter the player.'</p>

<p>Some few days afterwards I learnt that the Count had arrived. In
the interval I had urged the Baroness to dispense with my advocacy
altogether, and simply to send a message; but this she refused to do.
I had nothing left but to do my best.</p>

<p>I called at the hotel at which the Count was staying, and sent in
my name. I was immediately shown up to a private room.</p>

<p>'I see you are surprised to see me, Count von Roseneau,' I said,
'but I am not come to revive any reminiscences of the past. I simply
bring you a message from the Baroness Helena, who asked me to tell
you that she wished to see you at Saarfeld.'</p>

<p>'If I showed any wonder, Herr Richter,' said the Count, 'it was
simply that I was surprised that you should condescend to call upon
me. As you have mentioned the Baroness, I am glad of the opportunity
of saying that I am convinced that she can have no truer friend than
yourself.'</p>

<p>'The Baroness,' I said, 'is of the opinion that I might become the
best means of telling you that she still cherishes the recollections
of her early childhood. If I might venture to say anything, I would
say that we do not war against women, and that though doubtless many
things may have happened founded upon exaggerated reports, yet the
Count von Roseneau will not cherish such paltry recollections in such
a moment as this.'</p>

<p>'The Baroness,' said the Count, 'has chosen well, though I fancy I
can see that she has acted against the advice of her best friend. I
will go to Saarfeld at any moment she may appoint, and anything that
is within my power, and which is consistent with the honour of my
family, I will do; the more willingly because by doing so I know I
shall oblige you.'</p>

<p>This was all very well, and I did not see what else I could say.
There was a polished coldness about the Count's manner which seemed
to imply that the Baroness and he moved in a charmed circle within
which it was intrusion for any one to venture. I had delivered my
message, to the words of which the Baroness had almost limited me,
and I rose to take my leave; but I was not prepared for what
ensued.</p>

<p>The Count followed me to the door.</p>

<p>'Herr Richter,' he said, speaking in a very different tone from
that which he had hitherto used, 'I wish to say something else. I
wish, if I can possibly say it, to say something which will cause you
to think less hardly of me with regard to one who is dead; which will
offer you some thanks, though thanks from such a source must be
utterly worthless--for--but there are no words which can express what
I mean--if you do not see it, there is no help.'</p>

<p>I stood looking at him across the threshold for a moment.</p>

<p>'In the matter of which you speak, Count von Roseneau, if I
understand you, and I think I do, I also was to blame. It is not for
me to judge another. If you owe me thanks for anything that is past,
let me entreat you to weigh well every word you say at Saarfeld.'</p>

<p>'I promise you,' said the Count.</p>

<p>With regard to the interview at Saarfeld, I only know what the
Baroness told me. I believe that she told me every word that fell
from the Count, but her own words and manner I had to collect as best
I could. It was evident that she adopted a very different method from
that which she had done toward myself. She received the Count
indifferently, and put off the important moment as long as possible.
No doubt she brought to play the whole fascination of her manner and
person, but she selected the great salon as the scene of her final
effort. In what way she introduced the subject I do not know, but she
told me that she was standing in one of the embrasures of the windows
when the Count replied--</p>

<p>'Helena, I am unworthy of you, but I am grateful all the same. I
cannot allow you to sacrifice yourself simply out of pity to me. I am
a ruined man--ruined in purse and reputation. The auguries which
influenced your opinion of me when we were younger are
fulfilled--more than fulfilled. What would the world say if, when the
fear alone of possible consequences rendered your union with me
unsuitable; I were to avail myself of such a union when all these
dreary predictions have been verified? Let the world say what it
will, the Von Roseneaus are proud; that which was denied me because I
was unworthy I cannot accept because I am poor. Besides, I cannot
forget one who is dead.'</p>

<p>The Baroness was standing against the embrasure of the window
which was lined with tapestry. She was evidently anxious to retain
her perfect composure, but as the Count continued speaking with a
manly openness of purpose, her calmness was sorely tried. The last
words came to her help. She grew composed instantly, and her face
darkened with displeasure.</p>

<p>'You should take lessons from the stage, Count,' she said,
somewhat bitterly. 'The actor declines a supreme favour with better
grace than you.'</p>

<p>The Count said nothing; he was probably not displeased at the loss
of temper which would bring the interview to a close.</p>

<p>'Then you refuse my offer?' she said at last.</p>

<p>'I cannot accept.'</p>

<p>'Mine is a strange fate, Count von Roseneau,' she said. 'In this
hall, beneath the portraits of my ancestors, I have, in violation of
all the customs of my sex, offered my hand to two men, one an actor
and one a noble, and have been rejected by both.'</p>

<p>'The actor, madam,' said the Count, stepping back, 'you may well
regret; the noble is not worth a thought.'</p>

<p>The Baroness did not bear her second disappointment so well as the
first. She looked sad, though the smile lost nothing of its
sweetness, nor her manner of its vivacity. She had a wistful look in
her eyes sometimes when they met mine, which, it might be thought,
must have made my resolution hard to keep. If you like you may call
my determination a selfish fancy which my vanity alone enabled me to
maintain. The Baroness spoke a great deal of the Count, and talked to
me much of her early days, and of the confusions and ill-feeling when
the young Count's conduct first began to arouse the fears of her
father.</p>

<p>'I get very old and prosy, my friend,' she said--she grew lovelier
every day--'and I fatigue you with this talk; but I have no friend
but you to whom I can speak of these things.' She devoted herself to
charity and good works; she visited the hospitals, and her carriage
was to be seen in the worst purlieus of the city.</p>

<p>One day she told me she had received an invitation to travel in
Italy with some cousins of her mother's, the head of the party being
a superb old gentleman whom I had often met, and who reminded me of
Don Quixote. This old gentleman had at first been very cold and
haughty, but after some time his manner changed suddenly, the cause
of which alteration the Baroness explained to me.</p>

<p>'The old gentleman,' she said, 'took me to task very severely upon
the danger of my intercourse with you, and gave himself much trouble
in repeating at great length the most wise maxims. I let him run on
till he was quite out of breath, and then I said: "My dear cousin,
all that you have said is quite true, and shows your deep knowledge
of the world. There has been the greatest danger of what you dread
taking place. I offered my hand to Herr Richter years ago, and any
time within the last five years, excepting one short week, I would
have married him if he would have had me." I saw that the old Baron
was very polite the next time you met.'</p>

<p>The Baroness wanted me to accompany her to Italy, and offered to
settle a large sum of money on me absolutely, so that I might give up
my profession.</p>

<p>'No, Baroness,' I said, 'let us go on as we have begun. We have
had a fair friendship, for which I do not say how much I thank you,
and which no breath of calumny has ever stained; do not let us spoil
it at last.'</p>

<p>So we parted, but only for a time.</p>

<p>When the party had left for Italy I felt less tied to the city,
and accepted engagements elsewhere. I acted in Berlin, and so far
departed from my rule as to take one or two principal parts with more
success than I had expected. This was chiefly owing to the fact that
in Germany the new reading of any part is welcomed with enthusiasm,
and a host of critics immediately discover numberless excellences in
it, chiefly to show off their own cleverness. Many of these gentlemen
were kind enough to point out many beauties in my acting of which I
was entirely unconscious. This led to my receiving invitations to
other cities, which I accepted. In the course of my wanderings I
arrived at a city on the French frontier, where I accepted an
engagement for several nights to play Max Piccolomini. In the midst
of this engagement the war between Germany and France suddenly broke
out, and before we were aware we found ourselves involved in the
marches and counter-marches of armies. The theatre was closed and the
company dispersed. I attempted to return into Saxony, but the
advancing armies so blocked the roads that I was compelled to turn
back. The French were advancing with equal rapidity, and I found
myself shut in between the opposing troops. The campaign was so
complicated that what was the rear one day became the advanced guard
the next. The utmost confusion seemed to prevail.</p>

<p>At last I found myself in a little suburb of some large town
devoted to Lusthauses and gardens of pleasure; pretty little cottages
appeared on every side surrounded by gardens and grass-plots dotted
with alcoves and sheltered by lofty trees. The French made a sudden
advance, and held the adjoining slope, but did not come into the
suburb. A small detachment of German Uhlans had halted in the
village, and were watching the French.</p>

<p>I was standing in the door of one of the cottages with the officer
of the little troop, when the chasseur of the Baroness, whom I knew
so well, rode up. I sprang forward to meet him, and learnt that a
skirmish had taken place outside the town, and that the wounded men
were being brought from the front in charge of an ambulance corps to
which the Baroness had attached herself.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards the corps arrived, bringing with them
several wounded men. I shall never forget the look of glad surprise
in the face of the Baroness when she saw me. It is the most cherished
recollection of my life.</p>

<p>'You come, as always, in the right time, my friend,' she said. 'In
a few minutes we shall be in the thick of the battle. Whenever I want
help and protection, you appear. How did you learn that I was
here?'</p>

<p>'I did not know you were in Germany, Baroness,' I said. ' It is
the will of God that we should meet; something is going to happen
which concerns us both.'</p>

<p>She wore the ambulance dress, with the white cross upon her arm,
and looked more lovely than ever.</p>

<p>We had not stood above five minutes before we heard firing to the
right and left; and the Uhlans mounted and rode off, advising us to
retire into the cottages with the wounded. It was too late, they
said, for the ambulance corps to retire further into the rear.</p>

<p>Having deposited the wounded as best we could, the Baroness and I
went into an upper room which looked out to the side over a small
grass-plot flanked by a low wall and a plantation of willows. The
firing came nearer and nearer, and all along the slope on our left we
could see the French lines and the artillery officers riding up and
down. We did not know what was going on.</p>

<p>Suddenly a roar like hell itself shook the earth from end to end;
the cannon balls came crashing through the branches of the trees, and
a hail of lead swept off the leaves, tore up the grass in faint
lines, and shook the wall of the cottage with their dull thud. We
could see a strange commotion among the plantations on our right, and
the next moment a form which we both knew too well vaulted over the
low wall and came across the grass. A second after him other officers
leaped the wall, and without waiting to see if their men followed,
hurried across the lawn, and up the slope. They had no need to pause.
The next moment the Bavarian infantry, the men falling at every step,
cleared the fence, and in spite of the torrent of fire which seemed
to burn the earth before it, crossed the garden, and ascended in
almost unbroken line the hill beyond, half concealed by the shattered
trees. Other regiments followed, equally steady, and equally exposed
to the never-ceasing storm, and in about eight minutes the firing
lulled; the French had fallen back.</p>

<p>We went out of the cottage. Never in the wildest stage effect
could such a transformation be beheld as this village scene
presented. Eight minutes ago, smiling in the sunshine, peaceful,
bright with flowers, and green grass and trees--now shattered,
mangled, trodden down, the houses in ruins and in flames, the trees
broken and leafless, the ground strewn with the dying and the dead.
The ambulance was already at work, but the Baroness did not stop.</p>

<p>'Let us go to the front, my dear friend,' she said.</p>

<p>I knew what she meant. The chasseur, who kept close to his
mistress, followed us, and we went forward up the slope, picking our
way among the fallen men, and now and then stopping while the
Baroness gave some poor fellow a drink of water, and assured him that
the ambulance corps would be up immediately. As we ascended the slope
and looked back for a moment, we could see that the village and the
whole line of country was occupied by the main body of the German
troops--a magnificent sight.</p>

<p>At last, near the top of the slope, we met two Bavarians who were
carrying an officer between them. The Baroness knelt down, and,
without hesitation, the men laid their burden before her, in her
arms.</p>

<p>'We do not think he is dead, lady,' said one of them, the tears
streaming down his face. 'He moved once as we came along.'</p>

<p>He lay perfectly still, to all appearance lifeless, his eyes
closed.</p>

<p>'Speak to him,' I said; 'perchance he may hear you.'</p>

<p>'Von Roseneau,' cried the Baroness, in a tone I never wish to hear
again, 'Von Roseneau, will you marry me now?'</p>

<p>The despairing tremor of her voice seemed to recall the departed
spirit already wandering in other lands. The dying man opened his
eyes, a brilliant smile lighted his face, his gaze met that of the
Baroness, and he held out his hand, but he could not speak The next
moment he fell back dead within her arms.</p>

<p>'And what became of the Baroness?' I asked, for the actor
paused.</p>

<p>'She became a canoness, and devoted herself entirely to the
mystical religion of the Count von Zinzendorff.'</p>

<h2><a name="s5"></a>THE MARQUIS JEANNE HYACINTHE DE ST. PALAYE.</h2>

<h3>Part 1</h3>

<p>In one of the mountainous districts of the south of France, which
in the last century were covered with forests, the highway ran up
through the rocky valley by the side of a roaring torrent. On the
right hand and on the left the massive foliage descended to the
banks, and filled up the small and intervening ravines with a bosky
shade. Here and there a lofty crag broke out from the sea of green
leaves, and now and then the pointed roofs of a ch&acirc;teau or the
spire of a village church witnessed to the existence of man, and gave
an interest and a charm to the beautiful scene.</p>

<p>It was a day in the late autumn of the year 1760. The departing
smile of nature, which in another hour would be lost in death, was
upon every tree and leaf. The loveliest tints and shades, so delicate
that at the moment of their perfection they trembled into
nothingness, rested upon the woodlands on every side. A soft wind
whispered through the rustling leaves laden with mellow odours and
with the pleasing sadness that comes with the falling leaf. The
latest flowers of the year with unconscious resignation wasted, as it
might seem, tints which would not have disgraced the warmest hues of
summer upon heaps of withered leaves, and dry moss, and rotting wood.
The loveliest hour of the year was the last.</p>

<p>The highway crossed an ancient bridge of great height with a
cunningly pointed arch. Just beyond the bridge a smaller path turned
up on the left hand as you ascended the valley. It wound its way up
the wooded valleys as though with no definite end, yet it was smooth
and well kept, more so, indeed, than the highway itself, and
doubtless led to some ch&acirc;teau, the orders of whose lord the
peasantry kept the road in good repair. Let us follow this road on an
evening at the end of October the year we have already mentioned, for
we shall meet with a pretty sight.</p>

<p>Some distance up the road on the left was a small cottage, built
to mark and protect the path to a natural terrace formed, as far as
art had had a hand in the proceeding, by some former lord of the
domain to command a view of the neighbouring mountains and country.
Several of these terraces existed in the wood. At the point where the
path entered the private road to the ch&acirc;teau the wood receded
on every side, and left a wide glade or savannah across which the
sunshine lay in broad and flickering rays. Down this path there came
a boy and girl, for they were little more, though their dress and the
rank of life they held gave an appearance of maturity greater than
their years. The lady was of supreme beauty even for a heroine of
romance, and was dressed with a magnificence which at any other
period of the world would have been fantastic in a wood. She was
clinging to the arm of a handsome boy of some two and twenty years of
age, whose dress, by its scarf and some other slight peculiarities,
marked the officer of those days. His face was very handsome, and the
expression on the whole was good, but there was something about the
eyes and the curve of the lips which spoke of violent passions as yet
unsubdued.</p>

<p>The girl came down the path clinging to his arm, her lovely face
upraised to him, and the dark and reckless expression of his face was
soothed and chastened into a look of intense fondness as he looked
down upon it. Rarely could a lovely autumn afternoon receive its
finishing touch from the passing of so lovely a pair.</p>

<p>The valley was perfectly solitary; not a single sound was heard,
nor living creature seemed astir. It was as if Nature understood, and
held her breath to further the purposes of their lonely walk. Only
for a moment however. At the instant they left the path and entered
upon the grassy verge that bordered the way to the ch&acirc;teau,
they both started, and the girl gazed before her with an expression
of wild alarm, while the young man's face grew darker, and a fierce
and cruel look came into his eyes. But what they saw would seem at
first sight to give little cause for such emotion. A few yards before
them, walking leisurely across the grass from the direction of the
road, appeared a gentleman of some twenty-eight or thirty years of
age, of whom at first sight there could be no question that he was
one of the most distinguished and handsomest men of his day. He was
carefully dressed in a style which only men of exceptional figure can
wear without extravagance, but which in their case seems only fitting
and right. He wore a small walking sword, so hung as not to interfere
in the least with the contour of his form, with which his dress also
evidently harmonised. His features were faultlessly cut, and the
expression, though weary and perhaps almost insolent, bore slight
marks of dissipation, and the glance of his eyes was serene and even
kindly. He saw the pair before him and instantly stopped. It is
probable that the incident was equally embarrassing on both sides,
but the visible effect was very different. The two young people stood
utterly silent and aghast. The lady was evidently frightened and
distressed, while her companion seemed prepared to strike the
intruder to the earth. On the other hand the Marquis, for such was
his rank, showed no signs of embarrassment.</p>

<p>'Pardon, Mademoiselle,' he said; 'I perceive that I have committed
a gaucherie. Growing tired of the hunt, I returned to the
ch&acirc;teau, and hearing from the servants that Mademoiselle had
gone down into the forest to visit her old nurse at the cottage by
the terrace, I thought how pleasant it would be to go to meet her and
accompany her home. I had even presumed to think,' he continued,
smiling, and as he spoke he turned to the young man with a gesture of
perfect courtesy--' I even presumed to think that my presence might
be some small protection to Mademoiselle in the wilds of the forest.
I was unaware, of course, that she was guarded with such loyal and
efficient care.' He paused for a moment, and then continued with
greater dignity and kindliness of expression, 'I need not add,
Mademoiselle, as a gentleman whose name hitherto, I believe, has been
free from taint--I need not add that Mademoiselle need fear no
embarrassment in the future from this chance encounter.'</p>

<p>It was perhaps strange, but it seemed that the politeness and even
friendliness of the Marquis, so far from soothing, irritated the
young man. He remained silent, but kept his black and angry glance
fixed upon the other.</p>

<p>But the girl seemed differently affected. She hesitated for a
moment, and then took a step forward, speaking with her clasped hands
before her, with a winning and beseeching gesture.</p>

<p>'You see before you, Monsieur le Marquis,' she said, 'two as
miserable young creatures as, I hope, exist upon the earth. Let me
present to you Monsieur le Chevalier de Grissolles, of the regiment
of Flanders--'</p>

<p>The gentlemen bowed.</p>

<p>'--Who has known me all my life,' continued the girl, speaking
rapidly; 'who has loved me--whom I love. We meet today for the last
time. We should not have told you--I should not have mentioned this
to you--because I know--we know--that it is useless to contend
against what is fixed for us--what is decreed. We meet to-day for the
last time; the fleeting moments are run-fling past--ah! how
quickly--in another moment they will be gone.'</p>

<p>Here the emotion that overpowered her choked her utterance. She
stopped, and to prevent herself from falling, she clung to the
Chevalier's arm.</p>

<p>The Marquis looked at her in silence, and his face became
perfectly beautiful with its expression of pity. A marble statue,
indeed, might almost have been expected to show emotion at the sight
of such beauty in such distress. There was a pause. Then the Marquis
spoke.</p>

<p>'I am most honoured,' he said, 'to be permitted to make the
acquaintance of Monsieur le Chevalier, whose name, if I mistake not,
is already, though that of so young an officer, mentioned with
distinction in the despatches of Monsieur de Brogue. For what you
have said to me, Mademoiselle--and what you have condescended to
confide to me has torn my spirit--I fear I can offer you but little
consolation. Your good sense has already assured you that these
things are settled for us. They are inevitable. And in the present
case there are circumstances which make it absolutely essential to
the interests of Monsieur le Comte, your father, that these
espousals, at any rate, should take place at once. Even were I'--here
he turned to the Chevalier with a smile--' even were I to pick a
quarrel with your friend, and, a few seconds sooner than in the
natural course of events it probably would, allow his sword to pass
through my heart, I fear the result would be simply to substitute
another in my place--another who, I, with perhaps a natural vanity,
may fancy, would not place matters in a happier light. But let us not
look at things too gloomily. You say that this is your last hour of
happiness; that is not necessary. It is true that the espousals must
take place at once. The interests of your father require this. But
there is no need that Mademoiselle's feelings should not be consulted
with regard to the final consummation of the nuptials. These need not
be hurried. Monsieur le Chevalier may have other opportunities of
making his adieux. And I hope that my influence, which, in after
years, may be greater than it is at present, will enable me to
further any views he may have with regard to higher commands in the
service of his majesty.'</p>

<p>The words were those of ordinary compliment, yet the manner of the
Marquis was so winning that, had it been possible, it would have
affected even the Chevalier himself; but if a highwayman is
threatening your life it is not much consolation that he offers to
return you a franc piece.</p>

<p>The Chevalier remained cold and gloomy.</p>

<p>The Marquis looked at him for a moment; then he continued,
addressing himself to the girl--'But I am intruding myself on
Mademoiselle. I will continue my walk to the terrace; the afternoon
is delightfully fine. As you are aware, Monsieur le Comte is hunting
in the valleys to the west. All the piqueurs are withdrawn to that
side of the forest. I should hope that Mademoiselle will not again be
interrupted in her walk.'</p>

<p>Then without another word he courteously saluted the young people,
and continued his walk up the path. He never turned his head, indeed
he would have allowed himself to be broken on the wheel rather than
have done anything of the kind, but the others were not so reticent;
several times they stopped and looked back at the Marquis as he
paused every now and then as if to admire the beauties of the scene.
At last he reached the corner of the cottage and disappeared from
their view.</p>

<p>The beauties of the scene, however, did not entirely occupy the
mind of the Marquis. At the most enchanting point, where opening
valley and stream and mountain and distant tower burst upon his view,
he paused and murmured to himself, 'Some men, now, might have made
mischief out of this. Let us wait and see.'</p>

<h3>Part 2</h3>

<p>The Ch&acirc;teau de Front&ecirc;nac was built upon a natural
terrace half way up the slope of the forest, with the craggy ravines
clothed with foliage surrounding it on every side. It consisted of
two courts, the oldest of which had been built in the earliest days
of French domestic architecture, when the detached buildings of the
medi&aelig;val castle were first brought together into a compact
block. In accordance with the singular notion of those days that the
south and west were unhealthy aspects, the principal rooms of this
portion of the ch&acirc;teau faced the north and east. They consisted
of vast halls and saloons succeeding each other with apparently
purposeless extension, and above them a suite of bed-chambers of
solemn and funereal aspect. These saloons and bed-chambers had been
left unaltered for centuries, and the furniture must have been
antique in the reign of Henri Quatre. The other court had been built
much more recently, and, in accordance with more modern notions, the
chief apartments faced the south and west. From its windows terraced
gardens descended into the ravine, and spread themselves along the
side of the hill. The architecture had probably, when first the court
had been added to the ch&acirc;teau, contrasted unpleasantly with the
sombre pile beyond; but the lapse of centuries with their softening
hand had blended the whole into a unity of form and colour, and
adventurous plants creeping silently over the carved stonework of the
straggling fronts wrought a soft veil of nature's handiwork over the
artificial efforts of man.</p>

<p>The saloons in this part of the ch&acirc;teau were furnished more
or less in the modern taste with cabinets of ebony and ivory of the
days of Louis Quatorze, and buhl-work of the eighteenth century; but
as the modern articles were added sparingly, the effect on the whole
was quiet and pleasing. The De Front&ecirc;nacs, while enjoying the
more convenient portion of their abode, prided themselves upon the
antique apartments, and kept them in scrupulous repair. In these vast
and mysterious halls all the solemn meetings and ceremonies of the
family had place. Here when death had touched his own, the De
Front&ecirc;nacs lay in state; here the infant heir was baptized;
here the important compacts of marriage were signed; here the feast
of Noel was held. It is true that for the last century or so these
ideas had been growing weaker, and the usages of modern life and the
fascinations of the capital had broken in upon these ancient habits,
and weakened the attachments and associations from which they sprang;
but the De Front&ecirc;nacs were a fierce and haughty race, and never
entirely lost the characteristics of their forefathers. Now and
again, at some distaste of court life, or some fancied slight on the
part of the monarch, they would retire to their forest home, and
resume for a time at least the life and habits of a nobler and a
prouder day.</p>

<p>In the largest of these old saloons, the day after the meeting in
the forest, the whole household of the ch&acirc;teau was assembled.
At a long table were seated several gentlemen well known in Paris as
among the highest of the noblesse de robe, and rolls of parchment and
masses of writing, with great seals hanging from their corners,
covered the table. The walls of the saloon were hung with portraits
of several epochs of art, including the works of artists then alive;
for it was a peculiarity of the De Front&ecirc;nacs that, venerating
as they did the antique portion of their ch&acirc;teau, they
invariably hung the portraits of the family as they were painted in
these old and faded rooms, reserving for the modern apartments the
landscapes and fancy pictures which from time to time they
purchased.</p>

<p>When the moment had arrived at which the contracts were to be
signed, there was a movement in the room, and Mademoiselle de
Front&ecirc;nac, accompanied by her mother, entered and advanced
towards the table. She was perfectly collected, and bowed to the
Marquis with an unembarrassed grace. No one ignorant of the
circumstances of the case would have supposed that anything
approaching to a tragedy was being enacted in that room.</p>

<p>The Marquis signed more than one document, and as he stepped back
from the table he ran his eyes carelessly over the room, with which
he was unacquainted. Fronting him, above a massive sideboard with the
full light of the opposite window upon it, was the portrait of a
young man in the cuirass of an officer of cavalry of a previous
century, whose eyes were fixed upon the Marquis with a stern and
threatening glance. It seemed that, stepping from the canvas, there
confronted him, as a few hours before he had met him in the forest,
the Chevalier de Grissolles, whom he had found with Mademoiselle de
Front&ecirc;nac.</p>

<p>Nothing probably could have made the Marquis start, but he gazed
upon the portrait with interest not unmixed with surprise, and as
soon as Mademoiselle had retired, which she did when her signatures
had been obtained, he turned to the Count with a courteous
gesture.</p>

<p>'These apartments, Count,' he said, 'are certainly as fine as
anything of the kind in Europe. I have seldom, indeed, seen anything
that can be compared to them. And doubtless the portraits upon the
walls are of exceptional interest. By your leave, I will glance round
them;' and, accompanied by the Count, he passed through several of
the rooms, listening attentively to the descriptions and anecdotes
which the different portraits required and suggested. There was
somewhat of sameness perhaps in the story, for the French nobility
had little scope of action other than the battle-field, and the
collection lacked the pleasing variety of an English
portrait-gallery, where the variety of costumes, here a soldier,
there a divine, now a lawyer or judge, and then a courtier, charms
the eye and excites the fancy. The Marquis came back perhaps all the
sooner to the great saloon.</p>

<p>The saloon was empty, and the lawyers and rolls of parchment were
gone. The Marquis went straight to the portrait which had attracted
his attention, and stood facing it without saying a word; the Count,
after glancing carelessly round the room, followed his guest's
example.</p>

<p>The vast hall was perfectly empty. The tables had been pushed
aside into the windows, and the superb figure of the Marquis,
standing upon the polished floor, would have been of itself
sufficient to furnish the scene, but in proportion as the interest
which the portrait had excited was manifested in the attitude of the
Marquis, so much the more the figure on the wall seemed to gather
life and intensity, and to answer look for look with its living
opposite.</p>

<p>'That painting,' said the Count, after a moment's pause, 'is the
portrait of a cadet of my family, or rather, I should say, of a
female branch of it, a Chevalier de Grissolles. He was a youth of
great promise, a favourite and aide-de-camp of the Prince de
Cond&eacute;; and he fell at Jarnac by his master's side. Enough of
him,' and the Count's manner changed as he glanced round the chamber,
and advanced confidentially to the Marquis. 'Enough of him; but I am
not sorry your attention has been directed towards his portrait,
because it enables me to introduce, with somewhat less embarrassment,
a subject to which I have hitherto shrunk from alluding. I am sorry
to say,' continued the Count, with an uneasy smile, 'that the
chevalier whose portrait you see before you was not the last of his
race. There have been others who have borne the name, and there is
one now. He is a lad in the regiment of Flanders, and was brought up
in my family. Unfortunately he was allowed to attend Mademoiselle de
Front&eacute;nac in her recreations, and a boy and girl attachment
was formed between them, from which harmless child's play no one
foreboded any evil. The young fool is constantly breaking away from
his regiment, in which he is a great favourite, and is hanging about
my daughter; and from what Madame la Comtesse tells me--I--I hardly
like to say it, it is so absurd!--she is positively attached to him,
seriously and devotedly attached. Positively I cannot sleep
sometimes; this stupid affair has given me so much annoyance.'</p>

<p>It did not increase the good humour of the Count, who was already
in a sufficiently bad temper, to notice, as he could not help doing,
that the Marquis did not seem in the least surprised at the
information he had received, and what was still more irritating, that
he seemed to regard it with perfect indifference. He appeared, in
fact, to be much more interested in studying the portrait before him,
probably admiring it as a work of art.</p>

<p>'My dear Count,' he said at length, 'I am really sorry that you
should allow yourself to be so much annoyed over what seems to me to
be a mere trifle. This marriage-contract, so honourable to me, is now
signed; at the present moment les messieurs de robe are engaged, I
doubt not, in arranging those pecuniary matters which you explained
to me were of so much importance: why, then, should we trouble
ourselves? As to this little pastorale which it seems is being
enacted as a sort of interlude to the more serious business of the
stage, it is what I imagine invariably takes place. What would become
of the poets and romancists otherwise? We must think of our own
youth, Count, and not be too hard upon the young people. Positively I
feel quite old when I think of those delightful days--that
spring-time of existence, those first loves,' and the Marquis closed
his eyes and sighed deeply, apparently from his heart.</p>

<p>The Count took a turn or two in the saloon, but it did not seem to
soothe his temper.</p>

<p>'This is all very well,' he said sharply, 'and very witty; in
delicate badinage we all know no one can equal Monsieur de St.
Palaye, but I assure you this is no laughing matter. This affair has
grown beyond a joke. When my daughter has the honour--an honour, I am
well aware, far higher than any she had a right to expect--of signing
herself Madeleine, Marquise de St. Palaye, it will not be my place,
of course, to say a word. Then her honour will be in her husband's
keeping--her honour and his. But while she remains in my house she is
my daughter, and in my care, and I tell you plainly that this matter
is past a joke.'</p>

<p>A fleeting expression of extreme ennui passed over the Marquis's
face, and he evidently suppressed an inclination to yawn. Then with
more bonhomie than he had previously shown he put his hand on his
companion's arm.</p>

<p>'Well, my dear Count,' he said smilingly, 'I will do anything you
wish--anything, that is, short of unpleasantly hurrying the
nuptials--that I cannot do. It would be--in fact, it would be such
wretched taste--tears!--a scene!--a--an esclandre in general, my dear
Count!'</p>

<p>Then linking his arm in that of the Count, he led him, still sulky
and grumbling, out of the saloon, and into the modern court of the
ch&acirc;teau; and the long lines of ancestors on the walls followed
them as they passed with angry and vindictive looks, as though
enraged that they could not descend from their places and join again
in the turmoil of life.</p>

<h3>Part 3</h3>

<p>The second morning after the contract had been signed, the Marquis
was seated in his dressing-room, about an hour before
d&eacute;jeuner, reading, apparently with great entertainment, though
not for the first time, Le Taureau Blanc of Monsieur de Voltaire.
While he was thus agreeably occupied the door was violently thrown
open, and the Count, heated and excited, burst into the room.</p>

<p>'Marquis,' he said, utterly regardless of any who might hear, 'let
me beg of you to get to horse at once and come with me. I have
positive information that my daughter is at this moment giving an
interview to that young scoundrel on one of the terraces in the wood.
While we speak they may be planning an elopement--nay, even carrying
it into effect. Let me beg of you to come at once.</p>

<p>The Marquis laid down his book, crossed one knee over the other,
and leaning back on his chair looked the Count in the face steadily
for a second or two, as who should say, 'This man will be too much
for me; I shall have to press forward the nuptials, I see, in
self-defence.' Then he sighed deeply and rose from his seat.</p>

<p>'Very well, my dear Count,' he said, 'I will be as quick as
possible. Pierre, see that they bring some horses round; come into my
closet yourself, and send Charles and Alphonse and all the men here
at once. I will make haste, my dear Count, indeed I will.'</p>

<p>Whether the Marquis did make haste as he said, or whether the
number of valets impeded each other, it is certain that it was a long
time before he descended to the court of the ch&acirc;teau, where he
found the Count pacing up and down, fuming and cursing his delay.
They got to horse as soon as possible, and rode down the forest road,
but the Marquis reined his horse in so often, and made such
inappropriate remarks upon the beauty of the morning and of the view,
that the Count could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>'Monsieur le Marquis,' he said, 'I am sorry I have disturbed you
so much; I am very anxious to press forward, but I will not hurry
you, I will ride forward at once.'</p>

<p>'Pray do not delay a moment on my account,' said the other; 'I
shall rejoin you anon.'</p>

<p>The Count put spurs to his horse, and, followed by his servants,
was lost to sight behind the windings of the path.</p>

<p>The moment he disappeared the Marquis drew his rein, and turning
to his valet, said in a tone perfectly different from that which he
had hitherto used--</p>

<p>'On the north terrace, do you say?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Monsieur le Marquis,' replied the man, with a smile; 'on the
north terrace to the left: not on the old terrace, as the Count is
wrongly advised. They have been there a long time; I should think
they must be about parting.'</p>

<p>The Marquis turned his horse, and, followed by his men, retraced
his steps until they reached a scarcely perceptible path which, now
on their right hand, found its way down into the road. Here he
dismounted, and taking his riding-whip with him in place of a cane,
began leisurely to ascend the path. When he had gone a yard or two,
however, he turned to the valet and said--'Wait here with the horses,
and should Monsieur le Comte return, say to him that I have taken the
opportunity of the fine morning to enjoy one of the numerous views on
his delightful estate. Say that to him, neither more nor less.'</p>

<p>When the Marquis reached the head of the path he found himself at
the end of a long and grassy terrace, from which the path was
screened by thick bushes. Standing for a moment so concealed, he
became conscious of the presence of the two young lovers whom he had
met some few days ago in the forest. Again he could see the face of
the young girl, and again he was moved by the sight. He waited till
they had reached the other end of the terrace, and then came forward,
so as not to startle them by his sudden appearance. They met half
way.</p>

<p>'I am sorry once again,' said the Marquis, speaking simply and
without affectation, 'to intercept Mademoiselle, especially as this
time I have no excuse, but have acted with prepense. Monsieur le
Comte, your father, is ridden out in hot haste and temper upon some
mischievous information he has received concerning Mademoiselle and
Monsieur le Chevalier. I did what I could to delay him, and finally
left him, having better information, it appears, than he had. But he
will be here anon. I was compelled to leave my horses in the road
below, and when he returns from his fruitless quest he will doubtless
follow me here. Monsieur le Chevalier will doubtless see the
propriety of avoiding an unpleasant meeting.'</p>

<p>'I have to thank you, Monsieur le Marquis,' said the young man,
whose manner seemed compounded of an intense dislike and a sense that
politeness was due to one who, under singular circumstances, had
behaved in a more friendly manner than could have been looked for; 'I
have to thank you for previous courtesy, and for, I have no doubt,
much consideration to-day. I will not linger any more.'</p>

<p>He took the girl in his arms and imprinted a kiss upon her lips,
which, under the circumstances, was perhaps scarcely courteous; then,
gloomily bowing to the Marquis, he plunged into the thickest of the
wood and disappeared.</p>

<p>The Marquis took no notice of the warmth of his leave-taking, but
having his riding-whip and hat in one hand, he offered the other arm
to the girl, saying--</p>

<p>'If Mademoiselle will honour me by taking a turn upon the terrace
before her father's arrival I shall esteem it a favour, as it will
give me the opportunity of saying a single word.'</p>

<p>The girl took his arm willingly, and as she did so she said, with
a winning and confiding gesture--'Monsieur le Marquis, I think you
are the best and kindest of men.'</p>

<p>'I wish to put before Mademoiselle,' said the Marquis, speaking
gently, but very gravely, 'one or two considerations; and I could
wish that it were possible for her to regard it as the advice of an
absolutely impartial friend. The first is one of which I hesitate to
speak, because it seems to cast a slur, in some manner, upon the
character of Monsieur le Chevalier. But man is very weak, especially
when exposed to such temptation as, fortunately for him, rarely in
this world crosses his path. These shady groves and grassy banks are
the places where the deceitful god delights to work his mischief--a
mischief which is never repaired. I know, of course, that there are
many who speak of these things lightly, and who even view these
flowery but dangerous paths with approbation; but I cannot think that
Mademoiselle would tread them without violating the biens&eacute;ance
which alone makes life tolerable, or tainting the purity of those
lustrous ranks of which she will be the brightest star. I pass at
once to another thought which it is not impossible Monsieur le
Chevalier has already suggested.' He paused, as the tremor of the
girl's hand upon his arm showed that he was not speaking in vain. 'I
mean,' he continued, 'the project of seeking in another land that
happiness which I fear appears to Mademoiselle to be denied her in
this. Could I see any permanent prospect of happiness in such a
course I would not shrink, Quixotic as it might seem, from advising
you to adopt it. But there appear to me insuperable objections to
such a course. I do not see how it is possible for Mademoiselle so to
elude the affectionate solicitude of her family as to obtain more
than a couple of hours' start.</p>

<p>Couriers on swift horses would be sent to the Intendants of the
provinces, to the postmasters on the great roads, and to the officers
on the frontiers. After experiencing toil and hardships, which it is
pitiful to think of, Mademoiselle would probably be overtaken before
she reached the frontier. But supposing that such was not the case;
supposing that she succeeded, by the skill of Monsieur le Chevalier
and the swiftness of his horses, in reaching a foreign land, the
Chevalier is a sworn servant of the King of France. He would be
arrested in any court and city of Europe; he would be brought back to
France, and the Bastile, or some inferior prison, would be his home
for life. When I add to this the hardships of life in a foreign land,
of the rupture of family ties, of hatred and animosity where there
should be nothing but serenity, of the failure of family schemes and
hopes, and of the tie which binds persons of our rank all over the
world to discountenance actions which are regarded as subversive of
family order, and even life--I cannot, I say, when I think of such
certain hardship, of such possible disgrace and misery--I cannot
advise Mademoiselle to adopt such a course. The certainty that she
would soon be separated from her friend seems to me to decide the
matter.'</p>

<p>The Marquis paused; but as the girl made no reply, he
continued--</p>

<p>'For myself, I say nothing; it is my misfortune that I have been
introduced to Mademoiselle under circumstances which render it
impossible that I should make that impression which it would have
been the ambition of my life to achieve; but this, perhaps, I may
say, that should Mademoiselle decide to let matters take their
course, and as far as circumstances will permit, to repose in me her
confidence, it would indeed seem a fatality no less strange than sad
should she prove the first who, in the long course of centuries, had
reason to regret that they placed confidence in the word of a St.
Palaye.'</p>

<p>It seemed that something in the words of the Marquis, strange as
they may appear to some people, or something in his manner as he
spoke them, did not affect the girl unpleasantly, for she was in the
act of saying, what indeed she had said before, but now with one
slight but important modification--'Marquis, you are the best and
kindest of men,'--when her father, heated with riding and with anger,
burst through the trees at the end of the terrace, and overlooking in
his fury what was before his eyes, exclaimed--'Well, Marquis, I told
you how it would be: I cannot find them! This wretched girl 'he
stopped suddenly, open-mouthed, as straight before him, apparently on
the most friendly terms, the girl hanging confidingly upon her
companion's arm, stood the Marquis, and she of whom he was in such
desperate chase. It was impossible for either to conceal a smile.</p>

<p>'My dear Count,' said the Marquis, 'I am sorry you have had so
much unnecessary trouble. The truth is that after you left me it
occurred to me that, in the little domestic scene you were
anticipating, I should play an insignificant, not to say a somewhat
ridiculous figure. Warm as is the interest which I must naturally
feel in everything that concerns Mademoiselle, I think that these
family matters are always best managed by the family itself. I
therefore turned aside to enjoy perhaps the most beautiful of the
many beautiful views to be found on this estate, and to my delight I
found Mademoiselle engaged in a precisely similar occupation. It
augurs well.</p>

<p>I am sure, for our future happiness, that at this early period our
tastes are found to be so similar.'</p>

<p>The Count saw that he was being laughed at, and indeed it may as
well be confessed at once that the Marquis erred in the manner in
which he treated the Count. This, however, should be remembered in
extenuation, that nothing could be more intolerable to him than the
part of jealous husband and lover which the Count appeared determined
to force him to play. It was not in human nature but that he should
take a little quiet revenge.</p>

<p>'But did you see nothing of the Chevalier?' blundered out the
Count.</p>

<p>'Really, my dear Count, I have not had time, had I possessed the
power, to challenge my adversary to mortal combat, to run him through
the heart, to cut him up into small bits, and to bury him beneath the
sod. Besides, you will observe that the grass all around is perfectly
undisturbed. I assure you solemnly,' continued the Marquis,
apparently with the greatest earnestness, 'that the Chevalier does
not lie murdered beneath my feet.'</p>

<p>The words were spoken in Jest, but they were recalled to memory
afterwards by more than one.</p>

<p>The Count turned sulkily away, and his daughter and the Marquis
followed him back to the ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<h3>Part 4</h3>

<p>A few days after these events the Count removed his family to
Paris, travelling in several large carriages, and accompanied by
numerous servants on horseback. The Marquis accompanied them, and, by
what might appear a curious coincidence, on the very morning upon
which they set out on their journey the Chevalier received, at the
little auberge on the farther side of the forest, where he lodged, an
imperative order to join his regiment without delay. Furious at the
success of what he conceived to be the interference of the Marquis
and the Count, he obeyed the order, resolved to return to Paris at
the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>The winter passed in Paris as winters in great cities usually do.
The Chevalier stole up from the frontier more than once, and at court
balls, at the theatre, and at the private assemblies he succeeded in
seeing Mademoiselle de Front&ecirc;nac more often than he perhaps had
expected, but though his opportunities exceeded his hopes, the result
was not proportionally favourable. Whether Mademoiselle had succumbed
to the paternal influence, or whether the Marquis had succeeded in
substituting his own attractions for those of the Chevalier, it was
evident that her manner became colder and more reserved at each
interview.</p>

<p>The winter at last was over, and one evening in summer, after a
royal concert at Versailles, when the king's violins had performed
such delicate and yet pathetic music of Monsieur Rousseau's that the
court was ravished by it, the Chevalier met his mistress by
appointment in one of the pavilions of the orangery. He had secret
means of obtaining admission to the precincts of the palaces which
were well understood by the courtiers of those days.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Front&eacute;nac was perfectly pale as she came
into the pavilion, and she seemed to walk with difficulty; she
stopped immediately when within the door, and spoke at once, as
though she were repeating a lesson.</p>

<p>'Do not come any nearer, Monsieur le Chevalier,' she said; 'I am
the wife of another.'</p>

<p>He stopped, therefore, where he was, on the other side of the
small pavilion, and across the summer evening light that mingled with
the shimmer of the candelabras, he saw her for the last time.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a moment or two, and then she said, still as
though conning a part--</p>

<p>'I have promised, Monsieur le Chevalier de Grissolles, to be the
wife of the Marquis de St. Palaye, and I will keep my word.'</p>

<p>'You are not speaking your own words, Madeleine,' he said eagerly;
'let your own heart speak!' and coming forward across the pavilion,
he was on the point of taking her hand.</p>

<p>Then the door by which she had entered opened again, and the Count
de Front&ecirc;nac, with a quiet and firm step, glided in, and stood
by his daughter's side.</p>

<p>At this sight, which revealed to him, as it seemed, the
faithlessness of his mistress, and the plot which was woven around
him on every side, the Chevalier lost his self-control.</p>

<p>'I was aware, Monsieur le Comte,' he burst forth, 'that in this
pays du diable the privileges of parents were numerous and
inalienable, but till this moment I did not know that eavesdropping
was one of them.'</p>

<p>The Count made no reply, except by raising his hat; and his
daughter, bowing with a mechanical grace that was pitiful to see,
said--'I wish you farewell, Monsieur le Chevalier.'</p>

<p>'Madeleine,' said the young man, 'I wish you farewell for ever;
and I pray God, with what sincerity will be known when we stand, each
of us, before His judgment bar, that you may not bitterly regret your
words this night.'</p>

<p>Then, perfectly pale, but more composed than before he had spoken,
he too raised his hat courteously, and left the room.</p>

<p>That evening there were enacted within a stone's throw of each
other two very different scenes.</p>

<p>When the Marquis de St. Palaye returned to his hotel he was told
that the family lawyer, Monsieur Cacotte, was waiting to see him,
having at the first possible moment brought him some deeds which
Monsieur le Marquis was very anxious should be completed.</p>

<p>The Marquis would see him at once, and after a few minutes' delay,
he entered the room, in which the lawyer was seated at a table which
was covered with parchments. The room was one in which the Marquis
usually sat when the festivities of the day, whether at home or
abroad, were over; it was richly furnished as a library, and upon the
wide hearth there burned a fire of wood, though it was summer.
Greeting the lawyer with great friendliness of manner, St. Palaye
threw himself somewhat wearily into a chair, and gazed at the blazing
wood-ashes.</p>

<p>A servant entered the room with wine.</p>

<p>'I am sorry, Monsieur le Marquis,' said the lawyer, 'to come to
you at so unseasonable an hour; but your instructions were so precise
that the moment this first will was ready it should be brought to you
to sign, that I did not dare to wait till the morrow.'</p>

<p>'You did quite right, Monsieur Cacotte,' said the Marquis. 'No one
can tell what may happen before the morrow.'</p>

<p>'I have indeed,' continued the lawyer, 'prepared both wills, so
that Monsieur can satisfy himself that they are both exactly alike.
The one will be signed immediately after the marriage; the other at
once. They both contain the same clauses, and especially the one upon
which Monsieur le Marquis so much insisted: "That the sum of fifty
thousand louis d'or, charged upon the unsettled estates in Poitou and
Auvergne, should be paid within three months of the death of the
testator to Monsieur le Chevalier de Grissolles, for a purpose which
he will appreciate and understand." Those, I think, were the words
Monsieur wished to have used.'</p>

<p>'They seem quite correct,' said the Marquis.</p>

<p>'I am sorry,' continued the lawyer, 'that this extra expense,
which seems to me unnecessary, should be entailed.'</p>

<p>'In that,' said the Marquis politely, 'you only show, Monsieur
Cacotte, that care and interest in the good of the family which you
have always manifested both in the time of my father and of myself.
My father, the late Marquis de St. Palaye, always expressed to me the
obligation under which he conceived himself to be in this respect,
and this obligation is, of course, much increased in my case.'</p>

<p>'The obligation, Monsieur le Marquis,' said the lawyer, 'if such
there be, has been too liberally repaid both by your father and
yourself.'</p>

<p>'To tell the truth, Monsieur Cacotte,' said the Marquis, leaning
back in his chair, with his feet stretched out towards the fire, and
speaking with an appearance of being perfectly at home with his
companion, and desirous of confiding in him--'to tell the truth, I
am, even in this age of science and encyclopaedias, somewhat
superstitious, and I have a presentiment--the St. Palayes often had
it--that I have not long to live. Do not suppose that I shrink from
this prospect, though it is a singular statement for a man to make
who is about to marry, and to marry such a bride as mine! Yet I do
not mind confiding to you, Monsieur Cacotte, that I am somewhat
wearied of life. The world grows very old, and it does not seem to
mend.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur le Marquis has been too long unmarried,' said the
lawyer. 'I am not surprised that he should be wearied of the
enjoyments which he has had the opportunity of tasting to such
repletion. He will speak differently when he has a lovely woman by
his side, and knows the felicity of wife and child.'</p>

<p>'Ah, Monsieur Cacotte!' said the Marquis, smiling, 'you speak, as
they all do, of felicity. There is such a thing, believe me, as the
intolerable weariness of a too constant felicity. When I hear even of
the joy of the future, and of the bliss of heaven, it seems to me
sometimes that the most blissful heaven is to cease to exist.--Let me
sign the deed.'</p>

<p>A servant was called in as a witness, and the Marquis signed the
first will. Then he said to Monsieur Cacotte--</p>

<p>'The marriage will take place in six weeks in Auvergne; I hope
that Monsieur Cacotte will honour the ceremony with his presence. I
can assure you from my own experience that you will have nothing to
complain of in the hospitality of Monsieur le Comte.'</p>

<p>The Chevalier returned to his lodging about the same time that the
Marquis entered his hotel. His valet awaited him that he might change
his dress as usual before going into the town to spend the remainder
of the evening. The man perceived at once that his master was excited
and unhappy. He was an Italian by birth, and had accompanied the
Chevalier in his campaigns, and in his secret visits to the Chateau
de Front&ecirc;nac. He saw that the crisis had arrived.</p>

<p>'Does Monsieur go down into Auvergne this autumn?' he said.</p>

<p>'We go down once more,' said the Chevalier gloomily. He had
divested himself of his court dress, and was taking from his valet a
suit of dark clothes somewhat resembling a hunting suit. 'Yes, we go
down once more: this cursed marriage will take place a month
hence.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur takes this marriage too much to heart,' said the
Italian,--and as he spoke he handed the coat, which his master put
on, 'it may never take place. A month hence in the country they will
begin to hunt--to hunt the boar. No doubt the party at the
ch&acirc;teau will divert themselves in this way while the nuptial
ceremonies are arranged. It is a dangerous sport. Many accidents take
place, many unfortunate shots--quite unintentional. Monsieur le
Chevalier is a finished sportsman. He has a steady hand and a sure
eye. C'est un fait accompli.'</p>

<p>The Chevalier started: in the large glass before him he saw a
terrible figure dressed as for the chase, but pale as a corpse, and
trembling in every limb as with the palsy. He shuddered and turned
away.</p>

<h3>Part 5</h3>

<p>The piqueurs sent up word to the ch&acirc;teau that a magnificent
boar had been lodged in a copse at the foot of the forest road. An
answer was sent down accordingly that the Marquis would drive him
early in the morning, and that he should be turned if possible
towards the ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>In the morning, therefore, very early, the whole household was
astir. The ladies were mounted, and, divided into parties, cantered
down the road and along the forest paths to those points where,
according to the advice of their several attendant cavaliers, the
hunt would most likely be seen to advantage. The Marquis, it was
said, had been down at a still earlier hour to rouse the boar. Every
now and then a distant horn sounding over the waving autumn forest
told that the sport had commenced.</p>

<p>The ladies were gay and delighted, and those of the gentlemen who,
like Monsieur Cacotte, were not much accustomed to country life and
scenes, shared their enjoyment to the full. And indeed it seemed a
morning out of fairyland. From every branch and spray upon which the
leaves, tinted with a thousand colours, were trembling already to
their fall, hung sparkling festoons of fairy lace, the mysterious
gossamer web which in a single night wreathes a whole forest with a
magic covering which the first hour of sunlight as soon destroys.
Yellows, browns, and purples formed the background of this dazzling
network of fairy silver which crossed in all directions the forest
rides.</p>

<p>But though the morning was so lovely the ladies grew tired of
riding up and down waiting for the hunt. The horns became fainter and
more distant, and it became evident that the chase had drifted to the
eastward.</p>

<p>'Why do you stay here, Monsieur de Circassonne?' said Mademoiselle
de Front&ecirc;nac, smiling, to a young man, almost a boy, who had
with the utmost devotion remained by the side of herself and a very
pretty girl, her companion. 'Why do you stay here? You are not wont
to desert the chase. What can have happened to the Marquis and the
rest?'</p>

<p>The boy looked somewhat sheepish, and replied to the latter part
of the question only.</p>

<p>'I fancy that the boar has broken out, in spite of the piqueurs,
and that the Marquis has failed to turn him. They have probably lost
him in the forest.'</p>

<p>'But is not that very dangerous?' said the pretty girl. 'If they
do not know where the boar is, he may burst out upon us at any
moment.'</p>

<p>The boy looked at her as though much pleased.</p>

<p>'That is quite true,' he said. 'It was one reason why I
stayed.'</p>

<p>Monsieur de Circassonne was not far wrong in his opinion. This is
what had happened.</p>

<p>When the Marquis arrived at the cover, very soon after sunrise, he
found that the boar, ungraciously refusing to wait his opponent's
convenience, had broken cover, and wounding one of the piqueurs, who
attempted to turn him, had gone down the valley. He was described as
an unusually fine animal, and the dogs were upon his track.</p>

<p>The course which the boar had taken lay through the thick of the
forest. It was rugged and uneven, and he could only be pursued on
foot. After some distance had been traversed, the scent was suddenly
crossed by a large sow, who, as frequently happened, apparently with
the express purpose of diverting the pursuit from her companion,
crossed immediately in front of the dogs and went crashing down
through the coppice to the right. Most of the hounds followed her,
and the piqueurs, with few exceptions, followed the dogs. The
Marquis, however, succeeded in calling off some of the oldest hounds,
and, accompanied by two or three piqueurs, followed the original
chase. Some distance farther on, however, the boar had taken to the
water, and the scent was lost. At the same time the horns sounding in
the valley to the right showed that the deserters had come up with
their quarry, and distracted the attention of both piqueurs and dogs.
The former were of opinion that the boar had simply crossed the
river, and taking the dogs across they made a cast on the opposite
bank, where the dogs ran backwards and forwards baying
disconsolately. The Marquis, however, believing that the boar had
followed the course of the stream for at least some distance, kept on
the left bank, and forcing his way round one or two craggy points,
found at last the spot where the boar, apparently but a few moments
before, had scrambled up the bank. He sounded his horn, but either
from the baying of the dogs, or the noise and excitement in the
valley below, he was disregarded, and pushing aside the branches
before him, the Marquis found himself at the foot of a ravine down
which a mountain torrent was rushing to join the river below. The bed
of the ravine was composed of turf overstrewn with craggy rock, and
on either side rugged cliffs, out of the fissures of which lofty oaks
and chestnuts had grown for centuries, towered up towards the
sky.</p>

<p>The Marquis waited for a moment, but hearing no reply to his horn,
he entered the ravine alone.</p>

<p>As he did so, the strange shapes which the hanging roots and
branches of the trees assumed might seem to beckon and warn him back;
but, on the other land, a thousand happy and pleasing objects spoke
of life and joy. The sun shone brilliantly through the trembling
leaves, birds of many colours flitted from spray to spray,
butterflies and bright insects crossed the fretted work of light and
shade. The chase was evidently before him--why should he turn
back?</p>

<p>Some fifty yards up the valley the rocks retreated on either side,
leaving a wide and open grassy space, down which the torrent was
rushing, and over which fragments of basaltic rock, split from the
wooded cliffs above, were strewn. At the summit of this grassy slope,
standing beneath a bare escarpment of basalt, the Marquis saw the
boar.</p>

<p>Its sides and legs were stained with mud and soil, but the chase
had been very short, and the animal seemed to have turned to bay more
out of curiosity and interest than from terror or exhaustion. It
stood sniffing the air and panting with excitement, its hair
bristling with anger, its white and polished tusks shining in the
sun.</p>

<p>When the Marquis saw this superb creature standing above him on
the turf, a glow of healthy and genuine pleasure passed over his
face. He swung his horn round far out of reach behind his back, and
drew his long and jewelled knife. The boar and he would try this
issue alone.</p>

<p>For some seconds they stood facing each other. Then the posture of
the Marquis changed inexplicably. He rose to his full height, his
gaze was fixed as if by fascination upon a long range of low rocks
above him to the left, and an expression of surprise, which did not
amount to anxiety even, came into his face. Then he dropped his
knife, threw his arms up suddenly over his head, and falling
backwards, rolled once over and lay motionless upon the uneven turf
in an uneasy posture, his head lower than the limbs. A puff of white
smoke rose from the rocks above, and the reverberating echo of a
hunting piece struck the rocks and went on sounding alternately from
side to side down the valley.</p>

<p>The boar, startled at the shot, and still more, probably, by the
sudden fall of his adversary, crept into the thicket, and, while a
man might count sixty, an awful silence fell upon hill, and rock, and
wood. The myriad happy creatures that filled the air with murmur and
with life became invisible and silent, and even the rushing torrent
ceased to sound.</p>

<p>Then a terrible figure, habited in the costume of the chase, but
trembling in every limb as with a palsy, rose from behind the rocks
upon the left. With tottering and uneven steps, it staggered down the
grassy slope, and stood beside the fallen man. The Marquis opened his
eyes, and when he saw this figure he tried to raise himself from the
uneasy posture in which he had fallen. When he found it was
impossible, a smile of indescribably serene courtesy formed itself
gradually upon his face.</p>

<p>'Ah, Chevalier,' he said, speaking slowly and at intervals, 'that
was scarcely fair! Make my regrets to the Marquise. Monsieur
Cacotte--will speak to you--about--my--will.'</p>

<p>Then, the smile fading from the lips, his head fell back into the
uneasy posture in which it had lain, and the Marquis Jeanne Hyacinthe
de St. Palaye rested in peace upon the bloodstained grass.</p>
