<h2><a name="s1"></a>THE KIRK SPOOK</h2>

<p>Before many years have passed it will be hard to find a person who
has ever seen a parish clerk.</p>

<p>The parish clerk is all but extinct. Our grandfathers knew him
well--an oldish, clean-shaven man, who looked as if he had never been
young, who dressed in rusty black, bestowed upon him, as often as
not, by the rector, and who usually wore a white tie on Sundays, out
of respect for the seriousness of his office. He it was who laid out
the rector's robes, and helped him to put them on; who found the
places in the large Bible and Prayer Book, and indicated them by
means of decorous silken book-markers; who lighted and snuffed the
candles in the pulpit and desk, and attended to the little stove in
the squire's pew; who ran busily about, in short, during the
quarter-hour which preceded Divine Service, doing a hundred little
things, with all the activity, and much of the appearance, of a
beetle.</p>

<p>Just such a one was Caleb Dean, who was clerk of Stoneground in
the days of William IV.</p>

<p>Small in stature, he possessed a voice which Nature seemed to have
meant for a giant, and in the discharge of his duties he had a
dignity of manner disproportionate even to his voice. No one was
afraid to sing when he led the Psalm, so certain was it that no other
voice could be noticed, and the gracious condescension with which he
received his meagre fees would have been ample acknowledgement of
double their amount.</p>

<p>Man, however, cannot live by dignity alone, and Caleb was glad
enough to be sexton as well as clerk, and to undertake any other
duties by which he might add to his modest income. He kept the
churchyard tidy, trimmed the lamps, chimed the bells, taught the
choir their simple tunes, turned the barrel of the organ, and managed
the stoves.</p>

<p>It was this last duty in particular, which took him into church
'last thing', as he used to call it, on Saturday night. There were
people in those days, and may be some in these, whom nothing would
induce to enter a church at midnight; Caleb, however, was so much at
home there that all hours were alike to him. He was never an early
man on Saturdays. His wife, who insisted upon sitting up for him,
would often knit her way into Sunday before he appeared, and even
then would find it hard to get him to bed. Caleb, in fact, when off
duty, was a genial little fellow; he had many friends, and on
Saturday evenings he knew where to find them.</p>

<p>It was not, therefore, until the evening was spent that he went to
make up his fires; and his voice, which served for other singing than
that of Psalms, could usually be heard, within a little of midnight,
beguiling the way to church with snatches of convivial songs. Many a
belated traveller, homeward bound, would envy him his spirits, but no
one envied him his duties. Even such as walked with him to the
neighbourhood of the churchyard would bid him 'Good-night' whilst
still a long way from the gate. They would see him disappear into the
gloom amongst the graves, and shudder as they turned homewards.</p>

<p>Caleb, meanwhile, was perfectly content. He knew every stone in
the path; long practice enabled him, even on the darkest night, to
thrust his huge key into the lock at the first attempt, and on the
night we are about to describe--it had come to Mr Batchel from an old
man who heard it from Caleb's lips--he did it with a feeling of
unusual cheerfulness and contentment.</p>

<p>Caleb always locked himself in. A prank had once been played upon
him, which had greatly wounded his dignity; and though it had been no
midnight prank, he had taken care, ever since, to have the church to
himself. He locked the door, therefore, as usual, on the night we
speak of, and made his way to the stove. He used no candle. He opened
the little iron door of the stove, and obtained sufficient light to
show him the fuel he had laid in readiness; then, when he had made up
his fire, he closed this door again, and left the church in darkness.
He never could say what induced him upon this occasion to remain
there after his task was done. He knew that his wife was sitting up,
as usual, and that, as usual, he would have to hear what she had to
say. Yet, instead of making his way home, he sat down in the corner
of the nearest seat. He supposed that he must have felt tired, but
had no distinct recollection of it.</p>

<p>The church was not absolutely dark. Caleb remembered that he could
make out the outlines of the windows, and that through the window
nearest to him he saw a few stars. After his eyes had grown
accustomed to the gloom he could see the lines of the seats taking
shape in the darkness, and he had not long sat there before he could
dimly see everything there was. At last he began to distinguish where
books lay upon the shelf in front of him. And then he closed his
eyes. He does not admit having fallen asleep, even for a moment. But
the seat was restful, the neighbouring stove was growing warm, he had
been through a long and joyous evening, and it was natural that he
should at least close his eyes.</p>

<p>He insisted that it was only for a moment. Something, he could not
say what, caused him to open his eyes again immediately. The closing
of them seemed to have improved what may be called his dark sight. He
saw everything in the church quite distinctly, in a sort of grey
light. The pulpit stood out, large and bulky, in front. Beyond that,
he passed his eyes along the four windows on the north side of the
church. He looked again at the stars, still visible through the
nearest window on his left hand as he was sitting. From that, his
eyes fell to the further end of the seat in front of him, where he
could even see a faint gleam of polished wood. He traced this gleam
to the middle of the seat, until it disappeared in black shadow, and
upon that his eye passed on to the seat he was in, and there he saw a
man sitting beside him.</p>

<p>Caleb described the man very clearly. He was, he said, a pale,
old-fashioned looking man, with something very churchy about him.
Reasoning also with great clearness, he said that the stranger had
not come into the church either with him or after him, and that
therefore he must have been there before him. And in that case,
seeing that the church had been locked since two in the afternoon,
the stranger must have been there for a considerable time.</p>

<p>Caleb was puzzled; turning therefore, to the stranger, he asked
'How long have you been here?'</p>

<p>The stranger answered at once 'Six hundred years.'</p>

<p>'Oh! come!' said Caleb.</p>

<p>'Come where?' said the stranger.</p>

<p>'Well, if you come to that, come out,' said Caleb.</p>

<p>'I wish I could,' said the stranger, and heaved a great sigh.</p>

<p>'What's to prevent you?' said Caleb. 'There's the door, and here's
the key.'</p>

<p>'That's it,' said the other.</p>

<p>'Of course it is,' said Caleb. 'Come along.'</p>

<p>With that he proceeded to take the stranger by the sleeve, and
then it was that he says you might have knocked him down with a
feather. His hand went right into the place where the sleeve seemed
to be, and Caleb distinctly saw two of the stranger's buttons on the
top of his own knuckles.</p>

<p>He hastily withdrew his hand, which began to feel icy cold, and
sat still, not knowing what to say next. He found that the stranger
was gently chuckling with laughter, and this annoyed him.</p>

<p>'What are you laughing at?' he enquired peevishly..'It's not funny
enough for two,' answered the other.</p>

<p>'Who are you, anyhow?' said Caleb.</p>

<p>'I am the kirk spook,' was the reply.</p>

<p>Now Caleb had not the least notion what a 'kirk spook' was. He was
not willing to admit his ignorance, but his curiosity was too much
for his pride, and he asked for information.</p>

<p>'Every church has a spook,' said the stranger, 'and I am the spook
of this one.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said Caleb, 'I've been about this church a many years, but
I've never seen you before.'</p>

<p>'That,' said the spook, 'is because you've always been moving
about. I'm flimsy--very flimsy indeed--and I can only keep myself
together when everything is quite still.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Caleb, 'you've got your chance now. What are you
going to do with it?'</p>

<p>'I want to go out,' said the spook, 'I'm tired of this church, and
I've been alone for six hundred years. It's a long time.'</p>

<p>'It does seem rather a long time,' said Caleb, 'but why don't you
go if you want to? There's three doors.'</p>

<p>'That's just it,' said the spook, 'They keep me in.'</p>

<p>'What?' said Caleb, 'when they're open.'</p>

<p>'Open or shut,' said the spook, 'it's all one.'</p>

<p>'Well, then,' said Caleb, 'what about the windows?'</p>

<p>'Every bit as bad,' said the spook, 'They're all pointed.' Caleb
felt out of his depth. Open doors and windows that kept a person
in--if it was a person--seemed to want a little understanding. And
the flimsier the person, too, the easier it ought to be for him to go
where he wanted. Also, what could it matter whether they were pointed
to not?</p>

<p>The latter question was the one which Caleb asked first.</p>

<p>'Six hundred years ago,' said the Spook, 'all arches were made
round, and when these pointed things came in I cursed them. I hate
new-fangled things.'</p>

<p>'That wouldn't hurt them much,' said Caleb.</p>

<p>'I said I would never go under one of them,' said the spook.</p>

<p>'That would matter more to you than to them,' said Caleb.</p>

<p>'It does,' said the spook, with another great sigh.</p>

<p>'But you could easily change your mind,' said Caleb.</p>

<p>'I was tied to it,' said the spook, 'I was told that I never more
should go under one of them, whether I would or not.'</p>

<p>'Some people will tell you anything,' answered Caleb.</p>

<p>'It was a Bishop,' explained the spook.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Caleb, 'that's different, of course.'</p>

<p>The spook told Caleb how often he had tried to go under the
pointed arches, sometimes of the doors, sometimes of the windows, and
how a stream of wind always struck him from the point of the arch,
and drifted him back into the church. He had long given up
trying.</p>

<p>'You should have been outside,' said Caleb, 'before they built the
last door.'</p>

<p>'It was my church,' said the spook, 'and I was too proud to
leave.'</p>

<p>Caleb began to sympathize with the spook. He had a pride in the
church himself, and disliked even to hear another person say Amen
before him. He also began to be a little jealous of this stranger who
had been six hundred years in possession of the church in which Caleb
had believed himself, under the vicar, to be master. And he began to
plot.</p>

<p>'Why do you want to get out?' he asked..'I'm no use here,' was the
reply, 'I don't get enough to do to keep myself warm. And I know
there are scores of churches now without any kirk-spooks at all. I
can hear their cheap little bells dinging every Sunday.'</p>

<p>'There's very few bells hereabouts,' said Caleb.</p>

<p>'There's no hereabouts for spooks,' said the other. 'We can hear
any distance you like.'</p>

<p>'But what good are you at all?' said Caleb.</p>

<p>'Good!' said the spook. 'Don't we secure proper respect for
churches, especially after dark? A church would be like any other
place if it wasn't for us. You must know that.'</p>

<p>'Well, then,' said Caleb, 'you're no good here. This church is all
right. What will you give me to let you out?'</p>

<p>'Can you do it?' asked the spook.</p>

<p>'What will you give me?' said Caleb.</p>

<p>'I'll say a good word for you amongst the spooks,' said the
other.</p>

<p>'What good will that do me?' said Caleb.</p>

<p>'A good word never did anybody any harm yet,' answered the
spook.</p>

<p>'Very well then, come along,' said Caleb.</p>

<p>'Gently then,' said the spook; 'don't make a draught.'</p>

<p>'Not yet,' said Caleb, and he drew the spook very carefully (as
one takes a vessel quite full of water) from the seat.</p>

<p>'I can't go under pointed arches,' cried the spook, as Caleb moved
off.</p>

<p>'Nobody wants you to,' said Caleb. 'Keep close to me.'</p>

<p>He led the spook down the aisle to the angle of the wall where a
small iron shutter covered an opening into the flue. It was used by
the chimney sweep alone, but Caleb had another use for it now.
Calling to the spook to keep close, he suddenly removed the
shutter.</p>

<p>The fires were by this time burning briskly. There was a strong
up-draught as the shutter was removed. Caleb felt something rush
across his face, and heard a cheerful laugh away up in the chimney.
Then he knew that he was alone. He replaced the shutter, gave another
look at his stoves, took the keys, and made his way home.</p>

<p>He found his wife asleep in her chair, sat down and took off his
boots, and awakened her by throwing them across the kitchen.</p>

<p>'I've been wondering when you'd wake,' he said.</p>

<p>'What?' she said, 'Have you been in long?'</p>

<p>'Look at the clock,' said Caleb. 'Half after twelve.'</p>

<p>'My gracious,' said his wife. 'Let's be off to bed.'</p>

<p>'Did you tell her about the spook?' he was naturally asked.</p>

<p>'Not I,' said Caleb. 'You knew what she'd say. Same as she always
does of a Saturday night.'</p>

<p>This fable Mr Batchel related with reluctance. His attitude
towards it was wholly deprecatory.</p>

<p>Psychic phenomena, he said, lay outside the province of the mere
humourist, and the levity with which they had been treated was
largely responsible for the presumptuous materialism of the age.</p>

<p>He said more, as he warmed to the subject, than can here be
repeated. The reader of the foregoing tales, however, will be
interested to know that Mr Batchel's own attitude was one of humble
curiosity. He refused even to guess why the revenant was sometimes
invisible, and at other times partly or wholly visible; sometimes
capable of using physical force, and at other times powerless. He
knew that they had their periods, and that was all..There is room, he
said, for the romancer in these matters; but for the humourist,
none.</p>

<p>Romance was the play of intelligence about the confines of truth.
The invisible world, like the visible, must have its romancers, its
explorers, and its interpreters; but the time of the last was not yet
come.</p>

<p>Criticism, he observed in conclusion, was wholesome and necessary.
But of the idle and mischievous remarks which were wont to pose as
criticism, he held none in so much contempt as the cheap and
irrational POOH-POOH.</p>

<h2><a name="s2"></a>BONE TO HIS BONE</h2>

<p>William Whitehead, Fellow of Emmanuel College, in the University
of Cambridge, became Vicar of Stoneground in the year 1731. The
annals of his incumbency were doubtless short and simple: they have
not survived. In his day were no newspapers to collect gossip, no
Parish Magazines to record the simple events of parochial life. One
event, however, of greater moment then than now, is recorded in two
places. Vicar Whitehead failed in health after 23 years of work, and
journeyed to Bath in what his monument calls 'the vain hope of being
restored'. The duration of his visit is unknown; it is reasonable to
suppose that he made his journey in the summer, it is certain that by
the month of November his physician told him to lay aside all hope of
recovery.</p>

<p>Then it was that the thoughts of the patient turned to the
comfortable straggling vicarage he had left at Stoneground, in which
he had hoped to end his days. He prayed that his successor might be
as happy there as he had been himself. Setting his affairs in Qrder,
as became one who had but a short time to live, he executed a will,
bequeathing to the Vicars of Stoneground, for ever, the close of
ground he had recently purchased because it lay next the vicarage
garden. And by a codicil, he added to the bequest his library of
books. Within a few days, William Whitehead was gathered to his
fathers.</p>

<p>A mural tablet in the north aisle of the church, records, in
Latin, his services and his bequests, his two marriages, and his
fruitless journey to Bath. The house he loved, but never again saw,
was taken down 40 years later, and re-built by Vicar James Devie. The
garden, with Vicar Whitehead's 'close of ground' and other adjacent
lands, was opened out and planted, somewhat before 1850, by Vicar
Robert Towerson. The aspect of everything has changed But in a
convenient chamber on the first floor of the present vicarage the
library of Vicar Whitehead stands very much as he used it and loved
it, and as he bequeathed it to his successors 'for ever'.</p>

<p>The hooks there are arranged as he arranged and ticketed them.
Little slips of paper, sometimes bearing interesting fragments of
writing, still mark his places. His marginal comments still give life
to pages from which all other interest has faded, and he would have
but a dull imagination who could sit in the chamber amidst these
books without ever being carried back 180 years into the past, to the
time when the newest of them left the printer's hands.</p>

<p>Of those into whose possession the books have come, some have
doubtless loved them more, and some less; some, perhaps, have left
them severely alone. But neither those who loved them, nor those who
loved them not, have lost them, and they passed, some century and a
half after William Whitehead's death, into the hands of Mr Batchel,
who loved them as a father loves his children. He lived alone, and
had few domestic cares to distract his mind. He was able, therefore,
to enjoy to the full what Vicar Whitehead had enjoyed so long before
him. During many a long summer evening would he sit poring over
long-forgotten books; and since the chamber, otherwise called the
library, faced the south, he could also spend sunny winter mornings
there without discomfort. Writing at a small table, or reading as he
stood at a tall desk, he would browse amongst the books like an ox in
a pleasant pasture.</p>

<p>There were other times also, at which Mr Batchel would use the
books. Not being a sound sleeper (for book-loving men seldom are), he
elected to use as a bedroom one of the two chambers which opened at
either side into the library. The arrangement enabled him to
beguile.many a sleepless hour amongst the books, and in view of these
nocturnal visits he kept a candle standing in a sconce above the
desk, and matches always ready to his hand.</p>

<p>There was one disadvantage in this close proximity of his bed to
the library. Owing, apparently, to some defect in the fittings of the
room, which, having no mechanical tastes, Mr Batchel had never
investigated, there could be heard, in the stillness of the night,
exactly such sounds as might arise from a person moving about amongst
the books. Visitors using the other adjacent room would often remark
at breakfast, that they had heard their host in the library at one or
two o'clock in the morning, when, in fact, he had not left his bed.
Invariably Mr Batchel allowed them to suppose that he had been where
they thought him. He disliked idle controversy, and was unwilling to
afford an opening for supernatural talk. Knowing well enough the
sounds by which his guests had been deceived, he wanted no other
explanation of them than his own, though it was of too vague a
character to count as an explanation. He conjectured that the
window-sashes, or the doors, or 'something', were defective, and was
too phlegmatic and too un-practical to make any investigation. The
matter gave him no concern.</p>

<p>Persons whose sleep is uncertain are apt to have their worst
nights when they would like their best. The consciousness of a
special need for rest seems to bring enough mental disturbance to
forbid it. So on Christmas Eye, in the year 1907, Mr Batchel, who
would have liked to sleep well, in view of the labours of Christmas
Day, lay hopelessly wide awake. He exhausted all the known devices
for courting sleep, and, at the end, found himself wider awake than
ever. A brilliant moon shone into his room, for he hated
window-blinds. There was a light wind blowing, and the sounds in the
library were more than usually suggestive of a person moving about.
He almost determined to have the sashes 'seen to', although he could
seldom be induced to have anything 'seen to'. He disliked changes,
even for the better, and would submit to great inconvenience rather
than have things altered with which he had become familiar.</p>

<p>As he revolved these matters in his mind, he heard the clocks
strike the hour of midnight, and having now lost all hope of falling
asleep, he rose from his bed, got into a large dressing gown which
hung in readiness for such occasions, and passed into the library,
with the intention of reading himself sleepy, if he could.</p>

<p>The moon, by this time, had passed out of the south, and the
library seemed all the darker by contrast with the moonlit chamber he
had left. He could see nothing but two blue-grey rectangles formed by
the windows against the sky, the furniture of the room being
altogether invisible.</p>

<p>Groping along to where the table stood, Mr Batchel felt over its
surface for the matches which usually lay there; he found, however,
that the table was cleared of everything. He raised his right hand,
therefore, in order to feel his way to a shelf where the matches were
sometimes mislaid, and at that moment, whilst his hand was in
mid-air, the matchbox was gently put into it!</p>

<p>Such an incident could hardly fail to disturb even a phlegmatic
person, and Mr Batchel cried 'Who's this?' somewhat nervously. There
was no answer. He struck a match, looked hastily round the room, and
found it empty, as usual. There was everything, that is to say, that
he was accustomed to see, but no other person than himself.</p>

<p>It is not quite accurate, however, to say that everything was in
its usual state. Upon the tall desk lay a quarto volume that he had
certainly not placed there. It was his quite invariable practice to
replace his books upon the shelves after using them, and what we may
call his library habits were precise and methodical. A book out of
place like this, was not only an offence against good order, but a
sign that his privacy had been intruded upon. With some surprise,
therefore, he lit the candle standing ready in the sconce, and
proceeded to examine the book, not sorry, in the disturbed condition
in which he was, to have an occupation found for him..The book proved
to be one with which he was unfamiliar, and this made it certain that
some other hand than his had removed it from its place. Its title was
'The Compleat Gard'ner' of M. de la Quintinye made English by John
Evelyn Esquire. It was not a work in which Mr Batchel felt any great
interest. It consisted of divers reflections on various parts of
husbandry, doubtless entertaining enough, but too deliberate and
discursive for practical purposes. He had certainly never used the
book, and growing restless now in mind, said to himself that some boy
having the freedom of the house, had taken it down from its place in
the hope of finding pictures.</p>

<p>But even whilst he made this explanation he felt its weakness. To
begin with, the desk was too high for a boy. The improbability that
any boy would place a book there was equalled by the improbability
that he would leave it there. To discover its uninviting character
would be the work only of a moment, and no boy would have brought it
so far from its shelf.</p>

<p>Mr Batchel had, however, come to read, and habit was too strong
with him to be wholly set aside. Leaving 'The Compleat Gard'ner' on
the desk, he turned round to the shelves to find some more congenial
reading.</p>

<p>Hardly had he done this when he was startled by a sharp rap upon
the desk behind him, followed by a rustling of paper. He turned
quickly about and saw the quarto lying open. In obedience to the
instinct of the moment, he at once sought a natural cause for what he
saw. Only a wind, and that of the strongest, could have opened the
book, and laid back its heavy cover; and though he accepted, for a
brief moment, that explanation, he was too candid to retain it
longer.</p>

<p>The wind out of doors was very light. The window sash was closed
and latched, and, to decide the matter finally, the book had its
back, and not its edges, turned towards the only quarter from which a
wind could strike.</p>

<p>Mr Batchel approached the desk again and stood over the book. With
increasing perturbation of mind (for he still thought of the
matchbox) he looked upon the open page. Without much reason beyond
that he felt constrained to do something, he read the words of the
half completed sentence at the turn of the page---'at dead of night
he left the house and passed into the solitude of the garden.'</p>

<p>But he read no more, nor did he give himself the trouble of
discovering whose midnight wandering was being described, although
the habit was singularly like one of his own. He was in no condition
for reading, and turning his back upon the volume he slowly paced the
length of the chamber, 'wondering at that which had come to
pass.'</p>

<p>He reached the opposite end of the chamber and was in the act of
turning, when again he heard the rustling of paper, and by the time
he had faced round, saw the leaves of the book again turning over. In
a moment the volume lay at rest, open in another place, and there was
no further movement as he approached it. To make sure that he had not
been deceived, he read again the words as they entered the page. The
author was following a not uncommon practice of the time, and
throwing common speech into forms suggested by Holy Writ: 'So dig,'
it said, 'that ye may obtain.'</p>

<p>This passage, which to Mr Batchel seemed reprehensible in its
levity, excited at once his interest and his disapproval. He was
prepared to read more, but this time was not allowed. Before his eye
could pass beyond the passage already cited, the leaves of the book
slowly turned again, and presented but a termination of five words
and a colophon.</p>

<p>The words were, 'to the North, an Ilex.' These three passages, in
which he saw no meaning and no connection, began to entangle
themselves together in Mr Batchel's mind. He found himself repeating
them in different orders, now beginning with one, and now with
another. Any further attempt at reading he felt to be impossible, and
he was in no mind for any more experiences of the unaccountable.
Sleep was, of course, further from him than ever, if that were
conceivable. What he did, therefore, was to blow out the candle, to
return to his moonlit bedroom, and put on more clothing, and then to
pass downstairs with the object of going out of doors.</p>

<p>It was not unusual with Mr Batchel to walk about his garden at
nighttime. This form of exercise had often, after a wakeful hour,
sent him back to his bed refreshed and ready for sleep.</p>

<p>The convenient access to the garden at such times lay through his
study, whose French windows opened on to a short flight of steps, and
upon these he now paused for a moment to admire the snow-like
appearance of the lawns, bathed as they were in the moonlight. As he
paused, he heard the city clocks strike the half-hour after midnight,
and he could not forbear repeating aloud 'At dead of night he left
the house, and passed into the solitude of the garden.'</p>

<p>It was solitary enough. At intervals the screech of an owl, and
now and then the noise of a train, seemed to emphasise the solitude
by drawing attention to it and then leaving it in possession of the
night. Mr Batchel found himself wondering and conjecturing what Vicar
Whitehead, who had acquired the close of land to secure quiet and
privacy for a garden, would have thought of the railways to the west
and north. He turned his face northwards, whence a whistle had just
sounded, and saw a tree beautifully outlined against the sky. His
breath caught at the sight. Not because the tree was unfamiliar. Mr
Batchel knew all his trees. But what he had seen was 'to the north,
an Ilex.'</p>

<p>Mr Batchel knew not what to make of it all. He had walked into the
garden hundreds of times and as often seen the Ilex, but the words
out of 'The Compleat Gard'ner' seemed to be pursuing him in a way
that made him almost afraid. His temperament, however, as has been
said already, was phlegmatic. It was commonly said, and Mr Batchel
approved the verdict, whilst he condemned its inexactness, that 'his
nerves were made of fiddle-string', so he braced himself afresh and
set upon his walk round the silent garden, which he was accustomed to
begin in a northerly direction, and was now too proud to change. He
usually passed the Ilex at the beginning of his perambulation, and so
would pass it now.</p>

<p>He did not pass it. A small discovery, as he reached it, annoyed
and disturbed him. His gardener, as careful and punctilious as
himself, never failed to house all his tools at the end of a day's
work. Yet there, under the Ilex, standing upright in moonlight
brilliant enough to cast a shadow of it, was a spade.</p>

<p>Mr Batchel's second thought was one of relief. After his
extraordinary experiences in the library (he hardly knew now whether
they had been real or not) something quite commonplace would act
sedatively, and he determined to carry the spade to the
tool-house.</p>

<p>The soil was quite dry, and the surface even a little frozen, so
Mr Batchel left the path, walked up to the spade, and would have
drawn it towards him. But it was as if he had made the attempt upon
the trunk of the Ilex itself. The spade would not be moved. Then,
first with one hand, and then with both, he tried to raise it, and
still it stood firm. Mr Batchel, of course, attributed this to the
frost, slight as it was. Wondering at the spade's being there, and
annoyed at its being frozen, he was about to leave it and continue
his walk, when the remaining works of 'The Compleat Gard'ner' seemed
rather to utter themselves, than to await his will--.'So dig, that ye
may obtain.'</p>

<p>Mr Batchel's power of independent action now deserted him. He took
the spade, which no longer resisted, and began to dig. 'Five
spadefuls and no more,' he said aloud. 'This is all foolishness.'</p>

<p>Four spadefuls of earth he then raised and spread out before him
in the moonlight. There was nothing unusual to be seen. Nor did Mr
Batchel decide what he would look for, whether coins, jewels,
documents in canisters, or weapons. In point of fact, he dug against
what he deemed his better judgement, and expected nothing. He spread
before him the fifth and last spadeful of earth, not quite without
result, but with no result that was at all sensational. The earth
contained a bone.</p>

<p>Mr Batchel's knowledge of anatomy was sufficient to show him that
it was a human bone. He identified it, even by moonlight, as the
radius, a bone of the forearm, as he removed the earth from it, with
his thumb.</p>

<p>Such a discovery might be thought worthy of more than the very
ordinary interest Mr Batchel showed. As a matter of fact, the
presence of a human bone was easily to be accounted for.</p>

<p>Recent excavations within the church had caused the upturning of
numberless bones, which had been collected and reverently buried. But
an earth-stained bone is also easily overlooked, and this radius had
obviously found its way into the garden with some of the earth
brought out of the church.</p>

<p>Mr Batchel was glad, rather than regretful at this termination to
his adventure. He was once more provided with something to do. The
reinterment of such bones as this had been his constant care, and he
decided at once to restore the bone to consecrated earth. The time
seemed opportune. The eyes of the curious were closed in sleep, he
himself was still alert and wakeful.</p>

<p>The spade remained by his side and the bone in his hand. So he
betook himself, there and then, to the churchyard. By the still
generous light of the moon, he found a place where the earth yielded
to his spade, and within a few minutes the bone was laid decently to
earth, some 18 inches deep.</p>

<p>The city clocks struck one as he finished. The whole world seemed
asleep, and Mr Batchel slowly returned to the garden with his spade.
As he hung it in its accustomed place he felt stealing over him the
welcome desire to sleep. He walked quietly on to the house and
ascended to his room. It was now dark: the moon had passed on and
left the room in shadow. He lit a candle, and before undressing
passed into the library. He had an irresistible curiosity to see the
passages in John Evelyn's book which had so strangely adapted
themselves to the events of the past hour.</p>

<p>In the library a last surprise awaited him. The desk upon which
the book had lain was empty.</p>

<p>'The Compleat Gardener' stood in its place on the shelf. And then
Mr Batchel knew that he had handled a bone of William Whitehead, and
that in response to his own entreaty.</p>
