<h1>A Box of Dead Roses</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Ethel Mills</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<p>THE old lady was a most amusing creature, and she had a past
which was a record amongst pasts. Only that she was rich enough to
buy the whole district, its "society" would have "cut" her long
ago; as it was, people only talked about her with meaning looks and
whispered condemnation. At least, the generation to which she
belonged did that; the younger one only looked and wondered. Bent
with rheumatism, bushy-browed., fierce-eyed and
hard--featured--there remained no trace of the beauty and charm
which (so report said) had sent more than one good man to the
devil.</p>

<p>On sunny days she would have her chair moved on to the wide,
vine-sheltered verandah. She liked to see what was going on; and
she said that in Australia most things happened on verandahs. This
particular one had been planned and built in early pioneering days,
and had, no doubt, seen many ups and downs of varied incident.</p>

<p>One could listen to her by the hour when she was in the vein for
remembering pages from her own life or from other lawless lives of
early days, when all country west of the station was unknown
Australia. Like most old people, she was given to repetition, but
she told me a story once which neither I nor anyone else could ever
induce her to tell again.</p>

<p>It was about a young wife--the most innocent of brides, who
thought the world of her husband, and had no wish or look for other
men. Yet the house was full of other men in those days, and they
all gave thoughts or looks, more or less, to the prettiest woman in
the district. Every evening she used to stand at her bedroom door,
looking along the verandah, until she saw her husband returning
from his work; and every evening he brought her a rose from the big
bush by the steps. That was during the first months of her
marriage. Next year, the rose-bush bore as abundantly as ever, but
the man often forgot to pick a flower for her; and, after a time,
he forgot altogether.</p>

<p>The young wife was painfully ideal and long-suffering, and never
gave him a word of reproach; she was still so much in love with him
that she was shy, and blushed like a girl when he came near her
unexpectedly. "Fancy: after two years of married life!"</p>

<p>And the old lady smiled wickedly, and continued:</p>

<p>"She was tired one night, and went to bed early, leaving her
husband smoking and reading in the dining-room; but it was so hot
that she presently got up, threw on a gown, and strolled along the
verandah in the shadow for a breath of cool air. The sultriness of
the air brought out the strongest scent of the moonflowers. Just
there, at the corner near the rose-bush, she saw her husband with
his arms round a woman, kissing her lips over and over again--they
were full, very red lips, such as men like to kiss.</p>

<p>"The woman was one of the housemaids--the soft-voiced,
self-contained, velvet-footed one who usually brought in the tray
for supper, and whose eyes never left the floor as she did so--a
girl who seemed to have no thought beyond her duties.</p>

<p>"The wife heard enough to show her that the woman had thoughts
for many things besides--enough to tell her that those kisses were
not the first by any means; that the man's life had been a long
lie, except, perhaps, during the very early days of marriage. She
liked to think that he was all hers then. A delusion also,
possibly; but a harmless one.</p>

<p>"As it was, she stole off to bed without saying a word. I call
that a 'verandah tragedy,' my dear; because her whole nature
changed in a few moments. Not that there was much to notice one way
or the other at first--except that she said she could not bear the
scent of the moonflowers, and had the creeper taken up at the
roots. She did not even send away the housemaid. Why should she?
But things were a great deal more pleasant for the 'other men'
afterwards--a great deal, my dear! She used to sing and play to
them, and dance with them, and flirt with them, and fill the house
with visitors, and so on--in fact, she was a beauty, and had only
just awakened to a knowledge of her power. You see, the station and
money belonged to her; so she was freer than most wives.</p>

<p>"There was the baby, of course--a lovely, soft-faced little
thing that used to take its mid-day sleep in a string hammock,
swung up there by the trellis. She was fond of the child; yet, when
it died and was buried by the lagoon in the garden, she used to sit
dry-eyed, looking at the hammock that swung loosely in every breeze
without its accustomed burden. She even said she was not sorry;
because the boy might have grown up to break some woman's heart,
and the world was well rid of the breed. Perhaps it was best so;
though--looking at the other side of the question--he might have
lived to blush for his mother.</p>

<p>"One day her husband was brought in, dead-kicked by the horse he
was trying to catch in the yard. They carried him straight up the
verandah to the big spare-room, and the blood was dripping,
dripping all the way.</p>

<p>"She was a tidy, methodical woman always, and she sent for the
housemaid--the velvet-footed one--and bade her wash the boards. The
girl had a wonderful power of self-command usually, yet, at sight
of that blood, she shivered and trembled like one with the palsy.
Sentimental people said the wife was perfectly inhuman to think of
the state of her verandah at such a time--and, of course, a kind
friend told her. She laughed as she said, 'No! I am not
heart-broken. I went through that experience two years ago.'</p>

<p>"Well, my dear" (and the old lady's voice sounded a little
tired), "she lived a long, long life, and rather a varied and
interesting one, from an outsider's point of view, at any rate. I
often sit and think of her and of many things that happened on this
old verandah, but of late years I forget a great deal. I like best
to remember the days when the young wife used to stand listening,
listening for the husband's step--the sweetest music in the world
to her.</p>

<p>"No doubt she was an arrant little fool and bored him to death.
I think, now, that he was no worse than the majority of men: a
clever, interesting woman could have managed him. She became all
that afterwards--for other men; but, as I said before, she was a
totally different woman. Live every inch of your life, my dear!"
finished the old lady, impressively. "One life, one love!--the idea
is perfectly absurd."</p>

<p>Two years later I saw the old lady again--feebler, worn in body
and mind. She still sat in sunny weather on the verandah, but now
she always had a little cardboard box on her lap, caressing it with
her withered fingers.</p>

<p>"Look, my dear!" she said; "this box is full of dead
rose-leaves--they all came off that bush by the corner, years ago.
Young people are so careless and forgetful. I may die at any
moment, and unless I had it with me they would never remember to
bury it in my grave. They are the dearest things I possess; the
reason why they are so dear I shall carry a secret to my grave
also."</p>

<p>The old lady had forgotten that she had ever told me a story
with roses in it.</p>
