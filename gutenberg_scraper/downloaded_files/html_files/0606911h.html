    The Heart of a Savage</b></h2>
  <p>It was night at Tahiti, in the Society Islands. The trade-wind had died
    away, and a bright flood of shimmering moonlight poured down upon the slumbering
    waters of a little harbour a few miles distant from Matavai Bay, and the
    white curve of beach that fringed the darkened line of palms shone and glistened
    like a belt of ivory under the effulgence of its rays. For nearly half a
    mile the broad sweep of dazzling sand showed no interruption nor break upon
    its surface save at one spot; there it ran out into a long narrow point,
    on which, under a small cluster of graceful cocos, growing almost at the
    water&rsquo;s edge, a canoe was drawn up.</p>
  <p>Seated upon the platform of the outrigger, and conversing in low tones,
    were a man and woman.</p>
  <p>The man was an European, dressed in the uniform of a junior naval officer
    at the end of the last century. He was of medium height, with a dark, gipsy-like
    complexion and wavy brown hair, and as he drew the woman&rsquo;s face to
    him and kissed her, her skin showed not so dark as his.</p>
  <p>The woman, or rather girl, was a pure-blooded native, wearing only the island <i>pareu</i> of
    tappa cloth about her loins and a snow-white <i>teputa</i> or poncho of the
    same material over her gracefully-rounded shoulders. The white man&rsquo;s
    right arm was round her waist, she held his left hand in hers, and with her
    head against his bosom looked up into his face with all the passionate ardour
    of a woman who loves.</p>
  <p>For a few moments the man ceased speaking and looked anxiously over his
    shoulder at a number of white tents, pitched in a grove of breadfruit trees
    some few hundred yards away.</p>
  <p>As he looked, the moonlight shone upon the musket barrel of a sentry, whose
    head could just be discerned above the beach as he paced slowly to and fro
    before the tents.</p>
  <p>Bending her head of wavy, glossy black hair, the girl pressed her lips softly
    upon the white man&rsquo;s hand, and raising her face again, her eyes followed
    his, and as she noticed his intent look, a curious, alarmed expression came
    into her own lustrous orbs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Does the soldier see us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man smiled reassuringly and shook his head; then still clasping the
    girl&rsquo;s waist within his arm, he gazed earnestly into her beautiful
    face and sighed and muttered to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly in the Tahitian tongue and speaking
    very softly, &ldquo;you are a beautiful woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl&rsquo;s lips parted in a tender smile, her eyes glowed with a soft,
    happy light, and again she took his hand in hers and kissed it passionately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My white lover,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;would that I could tell
    thee in thine own tongue how I love thee. But the language of Peretane (Britain)
    is hard to the lips of us of Tahiti; yet, in a little time, when thou hast
    learned mine, thou wilt know all the great love that is in my heart for thee,
    and then thou shalt tell me all that is in thine for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man drew her slender figure to his bosom again; although he spoke her
    tongue but indifferently and she knew little of his, the ardent love which
    shone in her eyes and illumined her whole face, made her meaning plain enough.
    For a minute or so he remained silent, then again the girl&rsquo;s eyes sought
    his and her hand trembled as she noted the troubled, anxious look deepening
    upon his features.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kirisiani,&rdquo; she said, stroking his sun-bronzed cheek, &ldquo;what
    is in thy mind to make this cloud come to thine eyes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina,&rdquo; he answered in English, &ldquo;the time is near now
    for us to part&rdquo;; then seeing that the girl did not quite comprehend,
    he repeated his words in the native language.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And wilt thou leave me who loveth thee, to sail away with the white <i>Arii</i> (an
    officer, captain or chief), thy enemy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I help it? Am I not the King&rsquo;s officer? Did I yield
    to my love for thee and let the ship sail without me, then in mine own land
    I should be held up to scorn as a false man, and those of my name would be
    shamed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl slowly bent her head and put her hands over her face; then came
    a sudden, silent gush of tears. For a while she sobbed softly, as only women
    sob when some bright dream of love and happiness passes away for ever. Then
    with a quick movement she freed herself from the man&rsquo;s encircling arms,
    flung herself upon her knees on the sand, raised her tear-dimmed, starlike
    eyes to his, and spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet thou knowest we love thee; and if thou wilt remain with us my
    people will take thee to their hearts, and thou shalt become a chief among
    us. For see, I, Mahina, am of good blood, and there is no other woman in
    the land that loves thee as I do. And thou shalt have as many slaves as Tin&#257;,
    our chief, and like him, be carried upon men&rsquo;s shoulders wherever thou
    goest, so that thy feet shall not touch the ground.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man took her hands from his knees and, passing his arms around her,
    tenderly lifted her up to her seat again. Then with his forehead resting
    upon his hand he sat and thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Mahina. It cannot be as thou desirest; for I am the King&rsquo;s
    servant, an <i>Arii</i>, and it would be death to me were I to yield to my
    love for thee and flee from the ship like one of the common sailors. Some
    day I may return&mdash;when I am no longer serving in a King&rsquo;s ship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was on the point of rising and bidding her return to her home in the
    native village which lay some distance back from the cluster of tents, when
    she sprang to her feet and stood before him with one hand pressed to her
    panting bosom.</p>
  <p>Barely eighteen years of age, her tall, slender figure, as she stood in
    the flood of moonlight, showed all the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood.
    Unlike the generality of the Polynesian women (who possess in their youth
    a faultless symmetry of figure rivalled by no other race in the world, yet
    too often have somewhat flattened faces), her features were absolutely perfect
    in their oval regularity and beauty, and through the olive skin of her cheek
    there now glowed a dusky red, and her lover saw that her frame was shaking
    with over-mastering passion as she strove to speak. Only once before had
    Fletcher Christian seen her look like this&mdash;when some of her girlish
    companions had coupled his name with that of Nuia, the sister of Tin&#257;,
    the chief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina,&rdquo; said her lover, stepping forward and essaying to take
    her hand.</p>
  <p>She drew quickly back, and made an almost threatening gesture.</p>
  <p>Christian paused irresolutely, for the look of scorn and fury in the girl&rsquo;s
    eyes daunted and shamed him. Then he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina, this is folly. Why art thou so angered with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou false white man!&rdquo; she answered, and the strange, hoarse
    break in her young voice startled him&mdash;its melody and sweetness were
    changed into the jarring accents of rage and wounded pride; &ldquo;touch
    me no more,&rdquo; and here a quick, sobbing note sounded in her throat. &ldquo;Am
    I nothing to thee? Is all my beauty so soon dead to thee, and wilt thou put
    such shame upon me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Mahina, but listen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should I listen to thee, now that thou art about to cast me off?
    Dost thou think that I am a Tahitian woman, to be played with till thou hast
    tired of me; and then be given, with a laugh, to some other white man on
    the ship&mdash;as I have seen done? Did I not tell thee once that though
    I was born in this land of Tahiti my mother&rsquo;s mother came from the
    far distant island of Afit&#257;&mdash;the island that springs up like a
    steep rock from the blue depths of the unknown sea? And by her was my mother
    taught to despise these dog-eaters of Tahiti; and as my mother was taught,
    so she taught me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For the hundredth time since he had fallen under the spell of the girl&rsquo;s
    beauty and succumbed to the witchery of her ways and to the sound of her
    melting voice, her white lover again felt that her presence would overcome
    his resolution to part with her and return to his hateful duty; and
    for the hundredth time he struggled to resist a fascination he knew was fatal.
    So, not daring to look into the danger-depths of her now tear-dimmed eyes,
    he spoke again with seeming calm, but yet his face paled and flushed and
    paled again at the sound of his own cold words. He loved her, he said, but
    how could he escape from the ship? The punishment would be death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;nay, not so, my lover, but life for
    us both. Listen to me, and I will show thee that we shall never part again.
    And heed not the hot words of anger that leapt from my heart&rdquo;; and
    then with all the eloquence of her passionate nature she unfolded to him
    a plan of escape, and as she spoke her eyes and hands and lips came to the
    aid of her soft, low voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina,&rdquo; and he turned from her abruptly and walked to and
    fro upon the sand, with working face and clenched hands, &ldquo;let this
    end, girl; I cannot do as you wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; and again the tender voice became harsh and the red spark
    came into the dark eyes, &ldquo;then there is some painted woman in thine
    own land whom thou lovest&mdash;a woman such as is she whom we saw on the
    ship&mdash;and it is for her thou hast cast me off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, you pretty fool,&rdquo; said the man in English, with a laugh,
    as he took her hand, &ldquo;are you like your mother&mdash;offended at a
    silly jest? Did not you cry with the other girls, &lsquo;<i>Huaheine no Peretane
    maitai</i>,&rsquo; (&ldquo;The Englishwoman is good&rdquo; to look at) and
    when you were told that it was but a figure of wax did you not laugh with
    them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied the girl, and her voice had a sullen tone, &ldquo;but
    how know I that this image, which thou sayest was made by one of the sailors
    of the ship, is not the image of one thou lovest in Peretane? And my mother
    hath told me that this image of the woman with the hair like the sun and
    eyes like the ocean blue is carried on the ship as a spell to keep the white
    men&rsquo;s hearts hard to us women of Tahiti.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the man, in Tahitian, &ldquo;I tell thee no lies,
    Mahina; &rsquo;twas but a silly jest of the sailors. The thing was the waxen
    head and shoulders of a woman, and the sailors, to make the people laugh,
    made unto it a body and wrapped it in garments and made pretence that it
    was an Englishwoman. Thy countrymen knew it was but a jest&mdash;but thy
    mother, who, lacking keen vision, for she is old, was foolish enough to believe
    in it; so when she placed presents of mats and food at its feet, all who
    saw laughed at her; and because she was angered at this hath she told thee
    this silly tale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, if the thing lives not, how is it that the man who showed it
    to our people carries it with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou silly little one! know that in my country there be men who are
    workers and dressers of men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s hair, and such images
    as that which thou hast seen are placed outside their dwellings so that men
    may know their trade. And this man on the ship dresses and curls and whitens
    the false heads of hair that some of us wear by placing them on the head
    of the image&mdash;for then is his task easy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said in a whisper, &ldquo;forgive me; but tell me
    that thou wilt not leave me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, Mahina, tempt me not again; it cannot be. Good-night. Go
    to thy mother&rsquo;s house&mdash;and try to forget me.&rdquo; Then, not
    daring to look into her agonised face, he hurriedly embraced her and walked
    quickly towards the tents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said the girl, as she sank down with her black mantle
    of hair falling over her shoulders, &ldquo;go, then, and see Mahina no more.
    It is because I am not white that thou leavest me here with hunger in my
    heart for thee.&rdquo; And as she heard the sound of his footsteps over the
    loose pebbles some distance away, followed by the sentry&rsquo;s challenge,
    she lay prone upon the sand and wet it with a flood of anguished tears.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
The Cutting of the Cable</b></h2>
  <p>Scarce two cables&rsquo; lengths away from the dark fringe of palms which
    lined the white, shimmering beach, the <i>Bounty</i> lay motionless upon
    the placid, reef-sheltered waters of the quiet little bay, her hempen cable
    hanging straight up and down from hawse-pipe to anchor, fifteen fathoms below
    her forefoot. From the cabin windows a light in the captain&rsquo;s berth
    shot a dulled gleam upon the darkened water under her cumbrous stern, which
    the bright rays of moonlight had not yet touched, for though the moon was
    full it was not high, and the ship lay head to the south-eastward, with her
    bows toward the verdured slopes of Orohena Mountain, whose mist-capped summit
    towered seven thousand feet to the sky. Aloft, the ship&rsquo;s black spars
    stood silhouetted against the snow-white canvas bent in readiness for her
    departure; for in a day or two her long stay at Tahiti would come to an end,
    and the bows of the little barque would be turned southward for her voyage
    to the West Indies.</p>
  <p>In the great cabin, the chief entrance to which was from the main deck,
    the moon-rays sent a stream of light through the open doors, and showed
    a strange sight to see on shipboard.</p>
  <p>Instead of being fitted up like a King&rsquo;s ship, or indeed as a merchantman,
    the whole cabin space was filled with young breadfruit plants. Reaching fore
    and aft from the cabin doors to the transoms were five tiers of stout shelving,
    built to receive the pots in which the plants were placed; while sloping
    upwards towards the after part of the quarter deck from the transoms themselves
    were five tiers more. Nearly all the plants were fully-leaved, and a stray
    moonbeam now and then pierced its way through them to strike against and
    illumine the dark mahogany doors of the rooms on either side of this strangely
    furnished cabin.</p>
  <p>Nearly nine months before, the <i>Bounty</i>, of 215 tons burden, had left
    Spithead for Tahiti under the command of Lieutenant William Bligh, who had
    been sailing-master with the great navigator Cook in the <i>Resolution</i>.
    The ship which Bligh now commanded was specially fitted to convey specimens
    of the breadfruit tree from Tahiti&mdash;the Otaheite of Cook&mdash;to the
    West Indies, in the hope that the tree would there take root and flourish
    and furnish as bountiful a food supply to the negroes of those islands as
    it did to the light, copper-coloured people of the isles of the Pacific.</p>
  <p>Of the forty-six persons who sailed from Spithead in the <i>Bounty</i>,
    all, save Fletcher Christian, the senior master&rsquo;s mate, and a guard
    of four men who were on shore, were at that moment on board; and all, except
    the anchor watch, were deep in slumber.</p>
  <p>Walking to and fro on the forepart of the upper deck was Edward Young, a
    square-built, dark-complexioned man of twenty-two, and midshipman in charge
    of the watch. For nearly an hour he had thus paced the deck, glancing now
    at cloud-capped Orohena, six miles away, and now at the white tents
    of the shore party with the dark figure of the sentry in the foreground.
    Presently he stopped and looked intently towards another part of the beach
    where, an hour before, he had seen two figures seated upon a canoe which
    was drawn up on the hard, white sand; they were gone, but his quick eye discerned
    the smaller of the two disappear among the coconut groves towards the village
    of Papawa, while the taller person walked quickly over to the largest of
    the four tents and entered it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said to himself, and an amused smile flitted over his
    sallow features, &ldquo;Master Fletcher and Mahina, as I thought. He&rsquo;s
    badly love-smitten with that girl...no wonder he doesn&rsquo;t grumble at
    doing duty over the breadfruit plants on shore, with such a woman as that
    to sit by his side and charm him with her sweet prattle... Better to be at
    that than doing this cursed dog-trot up and down in the moonlight...and yet &rsquo;tis
    dangerous...aye, as dangerous for him as it is for me to linger among these
    people so long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sighed, and then baring his left arm, looked at a name tatooed upon it
    lengthwise; then with an angry gesture of contempt, pulled down his sleeve,
    and resumed his walk to and fro.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dangerous! Aye, indeed it is! Else why should I, a King&rsquo;s officer,
    and as proud a man as Fletcher Christian&mdash;whom I call a fool&mdash;commit
    such folly as this? What would my fine uncle say did he know that I had gone
    so far as to promise this girl, whose name is on my arm, never to leave her.
    And though I do leave her, is it less dishonourable for me to beguile her
    with lies because my skin is white and hers is brown? Well, in a week or
    so, poor Alrema will have to learn to forget me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A cool breath of air touched his cheek, and looking shoreward he saw the
    plum&egrave;d palm-tops swaying gently to and fro; then again a smart puff
    rippled the glassy surface of the water between the ship and the shore and
    swept seaward; and Young saw the black wall of a rain squall come fleeting
    down from the dark shadow of the mountain.</p>
  <p>Calling to the watch to stand-by, the young officer picked up his oil-skin,
    which one of the men brought him, put it on, and waited for the squall to
    strike the ship. Quickly it loomed down upon the line of palms, the black
    cloud paling to a misty white as it drew nearer; then it rustled, then fiercely
    shook the waving branches and drenched them with an ice-cold shower ere it
    hummed and whistled through the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> cordage and sent her
    sharply astern, to tauten up her cable as rigid as an iron bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pretty stiff while it lasts, Tom,&rdquo; said one of the anchor watch
    to a messmate, as, ten minutes afterwards, the tail end of the squall passed
    and the bright moonlight again played upon the soaking decks. &ldquo;Damme,
    but I&rsquo;d like to see a stiffer one come along and part the cable, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the droning hum of the squall ceased and the palm branches hung pendulous
    to rest again, a woman, nude, except for the narrow girdle of leaves around
    her waist, raised herself from the foot of a coconut tree behind which she
    had crouched, and looked at the ship. In her right hand was an open clasp
    knife. She leant her back against the tree and gazed steadily at the <i>Bounty</i> for
    nearly a minute, then with an angry exclamation cast the knife from her into
    the sea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fool that I was! Why did I not cut the rope through? Even though
    the young <i>Arii</i> had seen me he would not have raised his hand to harm
    me, for he too would gladly see the ship cast away and broken upon the reef,
    so that he need not leave my cousin Alrema.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An hour later, when daylight broke, Edward Young, after calling the ship&rsquo;s
    company, again went to the bows to take a look at the cable. It was his last
    duty before reporting to his relief that all was well, and then turning in.
    As he peered over the low bows of the vessel he saw the hemp cable stretching
    away down into the clear depths of the calm water. In a moment his sailor&rsquo;s
    eye saw that all the strands of the cable but one were parted.</p>
  <p>His sallow face turned white, then flushed again, and quickly walking aft
    he knocked at the door of the state room occupied by Lieutenant William Bligh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; inquired a sharp, imperious voice; then ere the
    young man had given his name the cabin door opened and a man of medium height,
    little more than thirty years old, stood facing the midshipman. His features
    were clear cut and refined and of singular whiteness&mdash;remarkable in
    one whose occupation was the sea&mdash;and his complexion contrasted strikingly
    with the jet black of his hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cable is nearly chafed through, sir, or the strands have parted.
    There was a strong squall just before daylight and the ship strained very
    heavily upon it. I think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep your opinions to yourself. You are a damned careless fellow,
    and not fit even to keep anchor watch. Where is it chafed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About a fathom below the water, sir,&rdquo; answered the young man
    with an unsteady voice and an angry gleam in his dark eyes. &ldquo;When I
    looked just now it was tautened out, and I saw that only one strand remained.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah,&rdquo; said the commander with a contemptuous laugh; &ldquo;and
    you have the audacity to attempt to screen your carelessness by telling me
    it has chafed&mdash;a couple of fathoms down from the hawse-pipe and in fifteen
    fathoms of water! The fact is, some of the natives have been off in a canoe
    and cut it under your nose. You ought to have prevented it. Were you asleep
    on your watch, Mr. Young? Answer me quickly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was not, sir,&rdquo; answered the young man quietly, steadying
    his voice; &ldquo;and I will swear that no canoe has come near the ship since
    I took charge of the deck. I believe she brought up to her anchor so suddenly
    during the squall that the jerk caused the cable to part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will do. I will see to this matter myself. You are all alike&mdash;  every
    one of you. There is not an officer in the ship that I can trust. Order my
    boat away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The angry, red flush in the commander&rsquo;s pale cheeks and the steady
    glitter in his light blue eyes boded ill to the young officer, whose own
    dark features were dyed deep with repressed passion; but by a powerful effort
    he overcame the desire to hurl back his superior officer&rsquo;s taunts,
    and saluting the captain with a hand which trembled with rage, he withdrew.</p>
  <p>In a quarter of an hour Bligh stepped out of his boat on to the beach. Before
    he had walked a dozen paces he was met with smiles of welcome by Moana and
    Tin&#257;, two of the leading chiefs, as had ever been the case during the
    many weeks of the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> stay at the island.</p>
  <p>But instead of the outstretched hand of friendship the angry officer gave
    them but a cold inclination of his head, and passed them by. At the entrance
    to the principal tent stood Fletcher Christian, who saluted as the commander
    approached.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Christian,&rdquo; and the moment the master&rsquo;s mate heard
    the sharp, fierce ring in his captain&rsquo;s tones, his jaw set firmly and
    his eye looked steadily into Bligh&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Mr. Christian, the cable
    has been cut. Most providentially, however, despite the criminal negligence
    of Mr. Young, the officer of the watch, one strand was not severed. That,
    fortunately, held the ship; otherwise she would now be lying on the reef.
    I am determined that the culprit shall be found and made an example of&mdash;as,
    by God! he shall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good, sir. Shall I send word for Tin&#257; and the other chiefs
    to come to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why so, sir? What reason have you to jump to the conclusion that
    this piece of villainy is the work of the natives?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine, sir, who else should be suspected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is a matter of opinion. I have mine. But as you have made the
    suggestion I will at least put your uncalled-for suspicions to the test of
    investigation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me, sir&mdash;&rdquo; began Christian, when Bligh cut him
    short with an imperious gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send for Tin&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In another minute a tall, stout, but handsome native whose speaking countenance
    expressed the most timid deference and respect, joined the captain and Christian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tin&#257;,&rdquo; said Bligh, fixing his keen eyes upon the chief&rsquo;s
    face, which already showed the deepest concern, &ldquo;what does this mean?
    My ship&rsquo;s cable has been cut. Some of your people have done it. Let
    them be found instantly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Like the simple child of nature that he was, the chief clasped his hands
    beseechingly together, and the quick tears welled up into his dark eyes ere
    he could speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What man is there of mine, oh friend of Tuti (Cook) and friend of
    Tin&#257;, who would do thee or thine such wrong as this?&rdquo; and then
    with the utmost distress depicted on his face he beckoned to him a fine,
    handsome woman of about thirty, and hurriedly spoke a few words to her. As
    she quickly walked away to do his bidding, he turned to Bligh, and in pleading
    accents besought him to wait a little till his wife Aitia returned.</p>
  <p>The captain of the <i>Bounty</i> nodded, seated himself upon a stool which
    the sentry brought to him, and waited. The chief&rsquo;s house was but a
    short distance from the tents and soon the woman returned carrying with her
    a framed picture of a naval officer. It was a portrait of Captain Cook, painted
    by Webber in 1777, which the great navigator had presented to the Tahitians,
    and which they treated with as much reverence as if it were a god.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said the chief, taking the picture from Aitia&rsquo;s
    hand, and the accents of perfect truth rang in his voice, &ldquo;see, this
    is Tuti,&rdquo; and he held it out towards the two officers; &ldquo;would
    I, Tin&#257;, whom he knew as Umu (His former name of Umu had devolved upon
    his son) his friend, and whose eyes love to look upon this, his face which
    speaketh not, would I tell thee lies? Nay, oh chief, it is my mind that none
    of my people have done this thing; but yet who can tell the wickedness that
    cometh into the hearts of men at times? And so now will I speak and seek
    if there be a man among my people with such an evil heart, and if there be
    then will I myself slay him before thee, so that the bitterness that is in
    my heart and thine shall die away and be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then, before the officer could frame a reply to the chief&rsquo;s impassioned
    speech, Aitia was at his feet, the tears streaming down her face while she
    repeated her husband&rsquo;s protestations of love and affection for all
    who came from the land of Peretane.</p>
  <p>The earnest manner of the chief had its effect upon the quick, impulsive
    temper of Bligh&mdash;a man who could change in a moment from the violence
    of intemperate passion to the most winning amiability of manner.</p>
  <p>In more gentle tones he replied that he was satisfied that Tin&#257;  would
    do his best to discover who had cut the cable, although if the culprit were
    found he hoped he would not go so far in punishing him as to take his life.
    Then he turned to Christian, and altering the suave tone in which he had
    addressed the chief, curtly ordered him to take the boat&rsquo;s crews and
    load the boats with plants.</p>
  <p>Merely touching his hat, the master&rsquo;s mate repeated the order to the
    coxswain of the boat near by and turned away.</p>
  <p>In an instant Bligh&rsquo;s pale cheek flushed angrily, and he sprang to
    his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the devil do you mean by receiving my order in that manner?
    Why don&rsquo;t you answer me when I address you? By heavens, sir, I will
    teach you the respect due to your superior officer!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian turned and faced him; and Bligh, hot and furious as was his mood
    now, could not but notice the repressed passion in his eyes and the paleness
    that blanched his tanned cheeks, and realise that Fletcher Christian was
    not a man to drive to desperation.</p>
  <p>For a moment the younger man did not answer, then the pallor of his countenance
    purpled with the sudden rush of blood to his face, the thick black eyebrows
    came together and his forehead showed two deep furrows as he replied&mdash;and
    in his voice there was no attempt to disguise the bitterness of heart within
    him&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I treat you, sir, with all the respect that the rules of the Service
    demand; with the same courtesy&rdquo;&mdash;and here his tones rang with
    contemptuous sarcasm&mdash; &ldquo;I answer you as you show to me. Nothing,
    sir, shall induce me to forget that I am compelled by my <i>duty</i> to adopt
    that courtesy and respect. But, sir, beyond that I will take care to be no
    more civil to you than your treatment of me demands or justifies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beware, sir; you are treading on dangerous ground&mdash;you are mutinous!
    I&rsquo;ve half a mind to make a prisoner of you and keep you under arrest
    until we reach England. By heavens, sir, I&rsquo;ll stand none of your insolence
    and misconduct! You and every other officer of the ship shall be brought
    up to the mark and learn your duties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the master&rsquo;s mate made no reply, and walked quietly away after
    the boat&rsquo;s crew; and Bligh, his frame trembling with passion, went
    towards the house of Tin&#257; the chief.</p>
  <p>Aided by the willing hands of the natives, men and women, who had stood
    by listening with deep concern to the angry discussion between the two officers,
    the boats&rsquo; crews soon loaded their boats, and Christian was left alone.
    Suddenly he felt a hand placed upon his and a voice murmured&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kirisiani, dost know who cut the rope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He started, and turned to meet the beautiful face of the girl he had talked
    with during the night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Mahina, tell me not, else must I tell his name to the captain&mdash;and
    that means death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She laughed. &ldquo;Thou knowest that it was I who did it. And yet tell
    of it if thou so desirest. What is death to me, my beloved, if thou leavest
    me? Listen&mdash;I will tell thee all. So that I might keep thee near me
    always, and my eyes look into thine, from sunrise to dark, and my hand lie
    in thine through the silence of the night, I swam to the ship as the wind
    and rain swept down from the dark valleys of Orohena, and cut the rope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina, Mahina, &rsquo;twas well for thee that the chief of the ship
    is no friend of mine&mdash;even now hot words passed between us&mdash;else
    would I tell him &rsquo;twas thee. With us, who are servants of the King
    of Britain, no woman&rsquo;s love must count&mdash;our love to him is first
    of all. Forget that thou hast ever seen me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She flung her arms round his neck and drew his face down to hers. &ldquo;Thou
    art mine&mdash;if thou leavest in the ship then will I curse thee and die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ere he could say more, with an angry sob she had gone.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    White Men and Brown Women</b></h2>
  <p>Two days had passed, and now as the departure of the ship drew near the
    natives redoubled their kindnesses to the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> people. Christian,
    with his morbid mind brooding over the scene between himself and his commander,
    did his duty in a dull, mechanical way and scarce spoke even to Edward Young,
    the one man to whom his gloomy nature sometimes relaxed. The parting, too,
    between Mahina and himself had had its effect upon him and he now clearly
    saw that, untutored savage as she was, she was yet a tender, loving woman
    whose heart he had cruelly tortured. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he reasoned with
    himself, &ldquo;it cannot be helped. She will never see me again, poor child.
    She will soon cast me out of her memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A mile or two away from where the <i>Bounty</i> rode at anchor, at a little
    village called Torea, Mahina and Nuia, the handsome sister of Tin&#257; the
    chief, sat together with their arms clasped round each other&rsquo;s waists.
    Mahina&rsquo;s eyes were wet with tears, but yet there was shining through
    them the light of radiant happiness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See, Nuia, how I have wronged thee! Always, always was my heart wrung
    by the idle words of those who said that Kirisiani wavered in his love between
    thee and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nuia laughed, and her bright, starlike eyes looked honestly into those of
    her friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false. True, I once coveted him; but soon I saw it was for
    thee alone that he cared. And then it was that Steua (George Stewart, midshipman)
    told me he loved me, and &rsquo;tis he alone that I care for now; and gladly
    will I help thee to keep thy lover, even as do I desire to keep mine. And
    listen now, while I tell thee how this shall be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Nuia told her friend how some of the seamen with whom the women had
    tender relations had declared for days their intention of deserting to the
    mountains and there remaining until the <i>Bounty</i> sailed. The women had
    promised to assist them, even though they knew Tin&#257; would resent the
    act bitterly. They trusted, however, that after Bligh was gone, the chief&rsquo;s
    love for his sister would procure their pardon. Only the previous day Nuia
    and Alrema and two other girls named Ohuna and Ahi, who were devoted to two
    seamen named Millward and Churchill, had arranged to steal the ship&rsquo;s
    cutter during the night, land some miles down the coast where they would
    be met by Nuia and her companions, and make their way over the mountains
    to Taravao&mdash;the peninsula that connects the district of Taiarapu with
    Tahiti. Here they were to conceal themselves till &ldquo;the wrath of Tin&#257; had
    ceased.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night, oh friend of my heart,&rdquo; said Nuia, placing her cheek
    against the bare bosom of her friend and embracing her lovingly, &ldquo;this
    shall be done. Alrema&rsquo;s lover, Etuati, who hateth the chief of the
    ship as bitterly as does thy Kirisiani, to-night again keepeth the watch.
    He hath taken the hands of these men in his and sworn to turn away his face
    when they steal the boat; and to-night, perhaps, will my Steua escape from
    the ship and come to me. Then, one by one, all those of the white men that
    hate to leave this land of ours will hide away, and the Arii Pirai (Captain
    Bligh) will trouble not, for in Taravao it will be hard for him to seek them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A fierce light shone in Mahina&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;True, how could he?
    And yet it would please me better could I see Pirai dead. For ever is he
    saying bitter words to the man I love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nuia looked at her companion for a moment, then rose, and, going to a corner
    of the house, reached her hand up to the thatch; then she took down a pistol
    and gave it to her friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See, this is the little gun that Pirai the captain gave to my brother
    Tin&#257;. To-night Alrema gives it to her lover, who hath sworn to kill
    Pirai some day for the foul words he ever gives him, even as he speaks foul
    words to thy lover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then the two girls separated&mdash;Nuia to give the pistol into Alrema&rsquo;s
    hand for Young, and Mahina to watch for her lover, should Christian come
    ashore in the evening.</p>
  <p>At one o&rsquo;clock next morning Edward Young was again keeping anchor
    watch. It was dark and rainy and no one else was to be seen on deck but the
    sentry&mdash;John Millward. Presently Young felt a hand on his shoulder,
    and heard the voice of Churchill, the ship&rsquo;s corporal&mdash; &ldquo;Mr.
    Young!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake be careful, Churchill! Are you all ready?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve got the second cutter alongside. Muspratt is in
    her. We&rsquo;ve eight muskets and six bags of powder and ball. Five of the
    muskets and some ammunition will be hidden by Alrema, who will be watching
    for you to escape. Why don&rsquo;t you come now, sir? There are half a dozen
    others ready to do so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, not now. I must get away alone. Alrema will let you know
    when.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodbye, sir,&rdquo; whispered Churchill.</p>
  <p>The midshipman pressed his hand, and the corporal stepped softly along the
    deck, till he reached the spot where Millward the sentry stood, peering anxiously
    out into the gloom which enveloped the ship. A quick gesture from Churchill,
    and the two figures dropped quietly over the side and were gone.</p>
  <p>For some minutes Young looked for the boat through the darkness, as those
    in her pulled with muffled oars towards the shore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s satisfactory,&rdquo; muttered the young man to himself; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
    something for our amiable and worthy commander to think over at breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lieutenant Bligh did think over it at breakfast; and soon Young was in irons
    and awaiting a promised flogging for &ldquo;being asleep on his watch and
    allowing the damned scoundrels to desert,&rdquo; as his commander forcibly
    expressed it.</p>
  <p>Four days afterwards, as Christian made his rounds of the ship he came upon
    Young, still in leg irons, waiting, with deadly hatred in his heart, for
    Bligh to visit him.</p>
  <p>In the bosom of his shirt lay Tin&#257;&rsquo;s pistol, and as the figures
    of Christian and a seaman darkened the entrance to the stuffy cabin his fingers
    clutched the weapon savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are all taken, Young,&rdquo; muttered his superior officer; &ldquo;they
    gave themselves up to Bligh this morning, and are now on board. I wish with
    all my heart I could set you free, for Bligh swears he will flog you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I swear, Christian, that he shall die if he attempts it. My God!
    are we Englishmen or slaves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian shook his head gloomingly, and with a pitying look at the young
    man, went on deck, passing on his way the manacled figures of the three captured
    men. They lay together in the sail locker, their backs raw and bleeding from
    the four dozen lashes which they had each received in the morning.</p>
  <p>Their dreams of and dash for liberty had been brief. Landing at the spot
    agreed upon, Nuia and her two friends, Ohuna and Ahi, met them with the warmest
    demonstrations of affection and loyalty; then they learned with alarm that
    Oripah and Tamiri, two of Tin&#257;&rsquo;s subsidiary chiefs, had forbidden
    the people in any way to aid or shelter them; and that Tin&#257; himself
    had bitterly reproached his sister Nuia for her share in the conspiracy&mdash;for
    by some means the whole plan of escape had been made known to him. Then after
    a hurried discussion the three deserters, accompanied by Ahi and another
    girl named Tahinia, set out again for Tetuaroa, a group of low-lying coral
    islands twenty-eight miles from where the <i>Bounty</i> lay. There they hoped
    to be free from interference; for the chief of the islands, Miti, was related
    to Tahinia.</p>
  <p>But when half-way across a furious squall drove them back to the mainland.
    Landing at a village called Tetaha the deserters remained hidden till they
    were surprised by Bligh and a boat&rsquo;s crew; and although they were prepared
    to fight to the last, the girls, to their surprise, begged them to surrender.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milwa,&rdquo; said Nuia to Millward, the moment they saw Bligh approaching,
    accompanied by his boat&rsquo;s crew and Tin&#257;, &ldquo;waste neither
    these men&rsquo;s blood nor thine. Yield&mdash;and I, Nuia, swear that the
    ship shall not take thee away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Relying on the repeated assurances of the girls, who wept in the earnestness
    of their beseechings, the three deserters came out of the house and stood
    before Bligh and his party.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surrender, you villains!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir, we surrender,&rdquo; answered Churchill; and under
    his breath he said to his companions&mdash; &ldquo;to be free again before
    long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When the men were brought on board, Bligh, whose face was livid with passion,
    turned to Fletcher Christian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Muster the hands, Mr. Christian. I&rsquo;ll show you and the others
    like you whether I will tolerate this spirit of mutiny and disregard of my
    orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then in sullen silence the ship&rsquo;s company were mustered on the main
    deck to witness the flogging of the deserters.</p>
  <p>As the bleeding form of Muspratt, the last to be punished, and the greatest
    sufferer, was led away from the gratings, one of the boatswain&rsquo;s mates
    named Morrison said to the midshipman Stewart in a low voice: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    glad, sir, I wasn&rsquo;t picked on to flog poor Bill Muspratt. My God, sir,
    how long is this to go on? The men are bordering on mutiny. Last night the
    captain took away every present of food given to us by the natives and said
    that it was his, and that every one on the ship, from the master down, was
    a damned thief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart gave him a warning glance as he answered in a whisper: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    talk to me, Morrison; if the captain sees you it means the cat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ten minutes later, as Christian was employed in hoisting in the cutter,
    Bligh&rsquo;s imperious tones were heard asking for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Christian,&rdquo; said the captain, walking up to where the master&rsquo;s
    mate stood, and his voice quivered with rage, &ldquo;I find that you had
    the audacity to send a coconut to that scoundrel Young to drink just now.
    By the Lord, sir, do you want me to send you to join him?&rdquo; And then
    with a passionate gesture he turned on his heel and again sought his cabin.</p>
  <p>The master&rsquo;s mate, with blazing eyes and face white with anger, turned
    and looked at the seamen who stood around him with their hands on the boat-falls.
    Not a word escaped his lips, but in their eyes he read their dangerous sympathy.</p>
  <p>That night Bligh slept ashore at Tin&#257;&rsquo;s house, and when all but
    the anchor watch were asleep a canoe glided gently alongside, and Mahina
    and Alrema stepped on deck and were met by their lovers. Young had secretly
    been released from his irons by Christian the moment Bligh had left the ship.
    For some hours the four conversed earnestly together, then just as the first
    grey streaks of dawn began to pierce the horizon the girls embraced the two
    men tenderly and went quietly back to their canoe.</p>
  <p>Down below, as Christian was replacing the handcuffs on Young&rsquo;s wrists,
    the midshipman gripped his companion&rsquo;s arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Christian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as God is my judge I intend to
    keep faith with that girl, even if it costs me my life; and you, Christian,
    are you made of stone? Can you leave Mahina&mdash;to lead such a life as
    we are made to live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The master&rsquo;s mate dashed Young&rsquo;s arm aside. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s
    sake, man, don&rsquo;t ask me. My brain is on fire,&rdquo; and for a minute
    or two he walked quickly to and fro, seemingly oblivious of the other&rsquo;s
    presence. Then he stopped suddenly and faced Young with a short, bitter laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That all depends on what happens. If Bligh treats me as a man...I
    will pocket his past insults...and prove a cruel, heartless scoundrel to
    that poor girl. If he does not...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He finished the sentence with a gesture of despair, and went on deck.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
    The First Sailing of the &ldquo;<i>Bounty</i>&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>The time to say farewell had come at last, and from early dawn the beach
    was crowded with natives. For two days the genial, kindhearted people had
    entertained their white friends with their simple sports, and the crew of
    the <i>Bounty</i>&mdash;save for those who lay ironed and sweltering in her &rsquo;tween
    decks&mdash;were given liberty by their stern captain. Sometimes in the midst
    of the mirth and song that prevailed during the <i>hivas</i> or dancing of
    the natives, strange spells of silence would fall, and Tin&#257; the chief
    and his stately wife would, with tears streaming from their eyes, leave the
    assembled throng and retire to their house. Tender-hearted, simple, and affectionate,
    they had conceived for Bligh, despite his occasional outbursts of passion
    and his severe treatment of the ship&rsquo;s company, a sincere and lasting
    respect; and that evening, when he came ashore dressed in his full uniform,
    with his sword by his side, smiling in that engaging manner which seemed
    so natural to him at times, even those few of the natives who feared and
    disliked him for his tyranny, demonstrated at least their respect for his
    rank and position in the most marked and earnest manner.</p>
  <p>Long past midnight the singing and dancing continued, and Bligh, as he stood
    on the beach, grasping the hands of Tin&#257; and Aitia in his, was content.
    Nearly two-thirds of his crew were ashore, and now as he stood there
    watching he saw them taking farewell of their native friends, who with the
    most extravagant demonstrations of sorrow, begged them to remain till the
    morning. He had no suspicion that this was assumed and that nearly half of
    his men had whispered to some <i>taio</i> (male friend) or pretty girl, &ldquo;We
    will return soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he said to the chief, holding out his white hand
    again, &ldquo;good-night, Tin&#257; and Aitia. Remember that to-morrow, soon
    after daylight, we sail. Yet I shall be pleased to see you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then the boatswain&rsquo;s whistle sounded for the men to return to the
    boats, and amid the weeping of those of the islanders who did not know what
    Mahina and the other women knew, Bligh and his men called out their farewells
    and pulled towards the ship.</p>
  <p>But with the first signs of dawn, those on board, looking shoreward, saw
    a vast concourse of natives on that part of the beach nearest the <i>Bounty</i>;
    and every few minutes numbers of people of both sexes were arriving through
    the palm-groves from inland villages, carrying gifts of fruit and native
    clothing, intended as parting presents for the voyagers. The waters, too,
    of the little bay were alive with canoes; many of them had come from the
    distant villages of Taiarapu, a day&rsquo;s journey, laden to the water&rsquo;s
    edge with simple tokens of affection for Bligh and his crew. As the canoes
    passed under the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> stern on their way to the shore the
    people in them were much affected when they noted the unmistakable signs
    of the ship&rsquo;s departure. They had daily heard for a month past from
    Bligh himself that he hoped to sail on the following day, but the continued
    delays seemed to have inspired them with hope; the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> people,
    they believed, had become so attached to their island friends that they could
    not part from them, and it was even possible, to their simple minds, that
    Bligh would abandon the mission on which he was sent by the unknown King
    of England.</p>
  <p>Sitting a little apart from the others and apparently taking no heed of
    the bustle around them, the girls Mahina and Nuia conversed with each other
    in low tones. Alrema, although accused by Tin&#257; of helping his sister
    in aiding the seamen to desert, had been forgiven, and was just then, with
    Aitia, conveying to Bligh a farewell present of two handsome parais or mourning
    dresses, which were to be given to King George.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina,&rdquo; and Nuia placed her hand on her friend&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;all
    will yet be well. Why look so sad? Dost thou doubt our lovers&rsquo; promises?
    See, only a little while ago, Alrema went on board to see her lover Etuati&mdash;he
    who is now bound with iron rings on his hands and feet&mdash;and this he
    said to her: &lsquo;Tell those that love us that we will return to Tahiti
    ere a moon has passed.&rsquo; Come, my friend, let us go to the ship for
    the last time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By this time the <i>Bounty</i> was surrounded by hundreds of canoes, and
    her decks were thronged with natives who, each man singling out his particular
    taio, or white friend, pressed upon his acceptance some farewell gift. Bligh,
    standing on the quarter deck, was conversing with Aitia and her husband,
    and behind him stood a boatswain&rsquo;s mate holding in his arms two muskets
    and two pistols, with bags of powder and ball. These were a gift from the
    commander to Aitia, whose skill as a markswoman rendered the gift specially
    pleasing and valuable.</p>
  <p>Raising his hat, and addressing her as if she were some great English lady,
    the captain of the <i>Bounty</i> said that the gifts were in token of his
    own personal liking for her and her husband, and as a proof of the friendship
    of the king of Great Britain. Then, while a respectful silence fell upon
    every one on board, the stately Aitia touched her forehead with the weapons
    one after another, and flinging herself at Bligh&rsquo;s feet clasped them
    in her hands and wept.</p>
  <p>Gently disengaging her hands the commander straightened his slender figure,
    and his sharp tones rang out: &ldquo;Clear the decks, Mr. Christian; and
    you, Tin&#257;, ask your people to get into their canoes. Aitia, goodbye;
    Tin&#257;, goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian, who had just bidden a hurried, passionate farewell to Mahina,
    sprang to the ship&rsquo;s forecastle and then some of the seamen manned
    the little capstan; the fiddler took his seat upon its head and scraped a
    dismal tune, every now and then breaking off in the middle of a bar to wave
    his bow to some Tahitian friend whom he knew, as he or she went over the
    side to a canoe. The ship was already hove short; and a few fathoms of the
    great hemp cable flaked upon the deck soon brought the anchor to the cathead.
    The topsails bellied out as the wind filled them; the men sprang aloft to
    man the yards at the word of command from Bligh, who had explained to Tin&#257; that
    with this ceremony and the firing of guns the ships of King George saluted
    the sovereigns of other nations; but as the gun-firing might injure the breadfruit
    plants on board it would be omitted. The sailors aloft gave a last cheer,
    the water began to ripple and bubble under the bluff bows of the <i>Bounty</i> and
    from the crowd of sorrowing people burst a cry of &ldquo;<i>Ioarana no ti
    atua ti</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;May the gods protect thee for ever and ever&rdquo;).</p>
  <p>A puff rippled across the bay, the ship lay over to it and sped quickly
    towards the passage between the roaring lines of surf which leapt and seethed
    upon the shelving ledges of coral reef. In another five minutes the vessel&rsquo;s
    bows rose and fell to the sweep of the ocean swell, and the <i>Bounty</i> stood
    out into the open sea.</p>
  <p>Then those who watched from the shore saw her square her yards and head
    to the south, for Bligh intended to call at the Friendly Islands before proceeding
    to the West Indies. Hour after hour, and still the people watched the lessening
    canvas of the ship sink below the horizon. Towards noon the breeze failed,
    and not till the green shadows of the mountains turned into a soft purple
    under the rays of the setting sun was the white speck lost to sight.</p>
  <p>Then Mahina and Nuia, who were the last to go, turned sadly away and went
    home to their dwellings of thatch to wait and hope.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    The Last Straw</b></h2>
  <p>For thirteen days the <i>Bounty</i> had sailed westward over a placid sea,
    the light south-east trades which filled her canvas scarce causing more than
    a noiseless ripple under her forefoot. On the morning of the fourteenth day
    she sailed through a cluster of low-lying, richly-verdured islands&mdash;the
    Namuka Group, and dropped her anchor in ten fathoms, in the clear, motionless
    waters of a reef-enclosed spot off the main island. The day was beautifully
    fine but intensely hot, and the dying wind gave the ship scarcely way enough
    to bring her to an anchor.</p>
  <p>In a very short time Bligh had opened communication with the natives of
    Namuka&mdash;a fierce, muscular race, who, however, professed friendship,
    agreeing to let him procure such supplies as he wanted from the island, and
    promising their assistance in wooding and watering the ship. The calm and
    dignified manner of the commander seemed to impress the savage, intractable,
    and treacherous Tongans as it had the gentle and kindly-natured Tahitians;
    and Bligh again showed those peculiar phases of his character which made
    him treat even the most dangerous natives with humanity and forbearance,
    and yet toward his officers and crew behave with undeserved, terrible severity.</p>
  <p>As soon as the captain returned on board, in sharp, fretful tones he ordered
    the boats away; one under the command of Mr. Nelson, the botanist, and another
    with Christian in charge, to wood and water the ship.</p>
  <p>For some hours the work went on without interference, till the natives,
    all of whom were armed with spears, clubs, and slings, began to surround
    the white men and steal everything they could lay their hands upon. Some
    of them actually took the casks of water from Christian&rsquo;s men and rolled
    them away into the coconut groves. Every moment their demeanour became more
    threatening and their insulting gestures and language were so unmistakable
    that Christian got his men together in order to cover the boats, and then
    paused irresolutely as to his next course of action. For Bligh had given
    orders that no matter how the natives behaved they were not to be molested,
    and on no excuse were they to be fired upon.</p>
  <p>In a few minutes their numbers had so increased that they began to show
    signs of making a rush upon Christian&rsquo;s scanty force, evidently mistaking
    his forbearance for fear; and soon some hundreds of them attempted to cut
    him off from the boats. It was only at this juncture that he gave orders
    to fire a volley over the heads of the now advancing and yelling body of
    savages. To this they responded with derisive jeers, shaking their spears
    and clubs and calling out &ldquo;<i>Mat&eacute;! mat&eacute;!</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Kill!
    kill!&rdquo;).</p>
  <p>With great difficulty Christian got his men back into the boats without
    injury being inflicted on either side, and reported himself to Bligh, who
    severely reprimanded him.</p>
  <p>Wiping the beads of perspiration from his face, the young man replied to
    his commander&rsquo;s censure: &ldquo;It is impossible, sir, to carry on
    the duty unless some steps are taken to prevent the landing party from being
    cut off by the natives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a damned cowardly lot of fellows!&rdquo; sneered Bligh; &ldquo;and
    is it possible that you, Mr. Christian, an officer in the King&rsquo;s Service,
    are afraid of a troop of savages while you and your men have firearms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian&rsquo;s face paled and his limbs shook as if in a fit of ague:  &ldquo;Our
    arms are of no avail, sir, while you forbid their use.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carry on the work and don&rsquo;t attempt to argue with me,&rdquo; was
    the contemptuous answer.</p>
  <p>So with wrath eating his heart out Christian went back to his task, and
    by almost superhuman endurance and forbearance managed to complete the wooding
    and watering of the ship.</p>
  <p>At last the work was finished, and the <i>Bounty</i> once more at sea, and
    on the afternoon of the 26th of April she lay becalmed between Namuka and
    the island of Tofoa, whose sharp-pointed volcanic cone could be seen thirty
    miles away, with thin blue curls of smoke ascending from its hidden fires
    into the windless atmosphere, while the sea was of glassy calmness and the
    ship drifted steadily to the eastward.</p>
  <p>Pacing to and fro upon the quarter deck, with the red fury spot showing
    upon his pale cheeks, the captain presently said, in his quick, angry way,
    as his eye glanced along the deck&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Morrison, send Mr. Christian here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Fletcher Christian&rsquo;s watch on deck, and he at once responded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Christian, what has become of the pile of drinking coconuts which
    was stowed between the guns? Some scoundrel has taken them. I demand to know
    who was the person!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you, sir, what has become of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean you will not. By heavens, sir, you shall! I have no doubt
    that whoever took them did so with the sanction of the officers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A lump rose in Christian&rsquo;s throat and his voice sounded hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think, sir, that you are mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We shall see! Pass the word for all the officers to come on deck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a few minutes they were all assembled, and Bligh, now in a fever heat
    of unreasoning passion, attacked them in the same manner. For some seconds
    no one answered; then Fryer the master, and Christian and Young assured him
    each in turn that they had not seen any of the men take the coconuts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Bligh, and his thin, clean-cut lips curled contemptuously, &ldquo;you
    have taken them yourselves! Mr. Elphinstone,&rdquo; turning to the junior
    master&rsquo;s mate, &ldquo;bring every coconut in the ship on deck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; went on Bligh, as four or five seamen came on the poop
    carrying bunches of coconuts, which they placed in heaps on the deck, &ldquo;please
    tell me, each of you, which of these heaps you individually claim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The officers spoke in turn, and then but one heap of coconuts remained&mdash;that
    belonging to Christian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this yours, Mr. Christian?&rdquo; said Bligh, in a voice trembling
    with passion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I really do not know, sir. It is difficult to tell one pile of coconuts
    from another; but I hope you don&rsquo;t think me mean enough to steal yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God, sir, I do! You must have stolen these from me or you could
    give a better account of them! You infernal rascals! You are all thieves
    alike and combine with the men to rob me. I will flog you all and make some
    of you jump overboard before we reach Endeavour Straits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Calling Samuel his clerk, Bligh ordered all the grog to be stopped, and
    only half a pound of yams to be served to each officer&rsquo;s mess in the
    future&mdash;and a quarter of a pound only if a single yam was missed. And
    then, his handsome features distorted with rage, and muttering curses, he
    turned upon his heel and went below.</p>
  <p>The officers stood and eyed each other with anger and amazement, and began
    to complain audibly; but Christian, with a strange look in his dark eyes,
    ordered them in a hoarse and broken voice, some to their duty, others to
    their watch below.</p>
  <p>When eight bells struck he was relieved by the master and went to his cabin.</p>
  <p>And Edward Young, as he watched Fletcher Christian pass him, with his hands
    clenched and his face blanched to a deathly white, smiled to himself and
    said, &ldquo;It is the last straw.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
    The Rubicon</b></h2>
  <p>When Christian reached his cabin he threw himself upon his sea-chest&mdash;almost
    the only article of furniture that the place contained&mdash; and cursed
    aloud his wretched existence. He thought of the long voyage before him, each
    day wearisome enough even if spent in agreeable companionship with his fellows,
    but a very purgatory with such a man as Bligh to goad him every hour with
    foul language and petty insults.</p>
  <p>His gloomy reflections were broken in upon by a voice asking permission
    for the speaker to enter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asked angrily.</p>
  <p>A seaman drew aside the canvas screen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The captain sends his compliments, sir, and requests the pleasure
    of your company to supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian sprang to his feet, his face flaming with passion. &ldquo;Tell
    him to go to the devil and take his supper in the only company he is fit
    for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alexander Smith, the sailor who had brought the message, for a moment stared
    in astonishment, yet waited in respectful silence. This was the first time
    during all the long voyage that an officer had so far forgotten himself as
    to express his feelings about the commander before a common seaman. With
    the seamen themselves such outbursts were frequent enough, but here was an
    officer&mdash;the senior master&rsquo;s mate, the third man in rank in the
    ship&mdash;ordering a common sailor to tell his commander to go to the devil,
    the only fit company for him!</p>
  <p>Smith was a young man of twenty-two, the son of a Thames lighterman; but
    he had been born with brains, and had taught himself to read and write, while
    his mother had brought him up to do his duty and respect his superiors in
    that old fashion which is good. This was his first voyage in a King&rsquo;s
    ship, but he knew what was due from Christian to his commander.</p>
  <p>So, instead of smiling, either openly or covertly, at Christian&rsquo;s
    rage, he thought for a moment, pulled awkwardly at a lock of his hair, gave
    a slight cough, and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begging your pardon, Mr. Christian, did you say that I was to tell
    the captain you felt too poorly, and kindly asked to be excused?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian glanced quickly at him, and then forgot his anger. The sailor
    was not much to look at, a strongly-built fellow below the middle height,
    with his face pitted deeply from the effects of small-pox, and his naked
    chest disfigured with tatoo marks&mdash;a coarse, rough seaman in dress and
    appearance, a gentleman in instincts&mdash;and, above all, a man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smith, you&rsquo;re a good fellow to bring me up with a round turn
    like that! Give me your hand, and deliver your own message, and accept my
    gratitude!&rdquo;  And the officer grasped the sailor&rsquo;s hand and wrung
    it warmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; and Smith&rsquo;s honest tones trembled with
    pleasure, for he liked and respected the young man, and felt proud of having
    thus won his confidence. &ldquo;A few months longer, sir, and it&rsquo;ll
    be all serene with us.&rdquo; Then, with a respectful salute, he was gone.</p>
  <p>The master&rsquo;s mate sat down again on the chest, and leant his cheek
    upon his hands. The last words of Smith&mdash; &ldquo;a few months longer&rdquo;&mdash;had
    once more set his brooding mind to work.</p>
  <p>He rose to his feet again; the close, hot atmosphere of his stuffy quarters
    seemed to oppress and choke him, and his brain was dulled and aching with
    the misery in his heart. He stepped out, and, gaining the deck quietly, leant
    upon the bulwarks and looked moodily over the star-lit ocean to where the
    steep cone of Tofoa upreared its darkened form three thousand feet in the
    air. It was the first dog-watch, when on ship-board men sing and make merry;
    but on this ship came no sounds of violin or choruses of seamen, for all,
    officers and men alike, were sullen and gloomy, and brooded over the incidents
    of the past few days.</p>
  <p>The wind was very light, and the ship scarce held steerage way; everything
    was still, and the grave-like silence oppressed the man. Now and then a gleam
    of red, smoky flame would flash in the sky to the eastward, and a strange,
    dulled muttering would be borne over the waters as the raging forces pent
    up in black Tofoa boiled and seethed within its groaning heart. The sight
    possessed a fascination for him, and for nearly half an hour he stood and
    watched the shooting dull-red flame and listened to the awful sounds which
    broke from the mountain in the violence of its convulsions.</p>
  <p>Presently he changed his attitude of dejection, and his eye lightened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten miles away,&rdquo; he muttered, gazing at the dark shape of Tofoa, &ldquo;and
    there are beaches on the west side where landing is easy, and a network of
    low islets within another six leagues. By heavens, I&rsquo;ll risk it! Anything
    is better than this&mdash;better, even, the jaws of a shark!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He went quietly forward and collected a number of boat-oars and some hand-spikes
    from the racks; these he brought to a place in the after part of the ship,
    where he was not likely to be seen, and began to lash them together.</p>
  <p>He was interrupted suddenly by Young. &ldquo;What the h&mdash;l are you
    doing, Christian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am making a raft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A raft?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, a raft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why? What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because, Young, I can stand this no longer. I am about to try and
    make Tofoa on this raft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madness! You could never reach there, even if there were no sharks.
    There is a fearful current setting to the westward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. Sharks are better company than this infernal
    tyrant. Why, do you know, Young, that the damned, pitiful scoundrel actually
    invited me to sup with him to-night, no doubt thinking to propitiate me for
    the insults of this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you&rsquo;ve suffered no more than I. But still, this is
    sheer madness, Christian. You are not, surely, such a fool as to incur all
    the odium of becoming a deserter, for what?&mdash;to be turned into shark&rsquo;s
    meat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue with me, Young,&rdquo; he answered fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    made up my mind to get out of this floating hell, and I mean to leave the
    ship either in the first or middle watch. You know of my intention. If you
    think it your duty, tell the gentle Bligh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Young laughed. &ldquo;Not I, Christian. I&rsquo;ll not move in the matter,
    except to dissuade you from such folly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cease, cease, my dear fellow; it is too late. Either this, or I put
    an end to my life. But if your sympathies are with me, do me this favour&mdash;go
    to the steward and on some pretence or other get me food. Put it in a bag
    with some nails and hoop-iron and beads, or anything likely to take the fancy
    of the natives, and bring it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Young at once went away, and procuring a canvas bag put in it food, some
    bottles of water, and a few articles for barter. But at the same time he
    told the boatswain&rsquo;s mate of Christian&rsquo;s watch and the officers
    in charge of the first and middle watches, and begged them to keep the matter
    secret, but on no account to give the young man an opportunity of carrying
    out his rash project, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said he earnestly, &ldquo;Mr. Christian
    is not in a fit state to leave the ship; the man is ill in mind and body,
    and not responsible for his actions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slowly the night passed, and more than once Christian came on deck with
    the intention of putting his idea of escape into practice; but he always
    found some one ready to talk to him, and so no opportunity came. At half-past
    three he gave up all further attempts, and sick in mind, lay down in his
    bunk. Then eight bells struck, and he was called by Stewart to take the morning
    watch.</p>
  <p>As Stewart turned to go on deck he pressed Christian&rsquo;s hand sympathetically,
    and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Mr. Christian, I know your design. For God&rsquo;s
    sake, sir, try to have patience, and give up your intention. If you carry
    it out, it only means a dreadful death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will make no further attempt to-night, at least,&rdquo; he answered,
    in a strange, husky voice; but he gave the midshipman&rsquo;s hand a firm
    grip.</p>
  <p>For some minutes he sat upon his sea-chest, with his face buried in his
    hands, thinking; and the darkness of the night, the hoarse mutterings and
    muffled thunder from distant Tofoa, found a responsive echo in his maddened
    brain.</p>
  <p>The signs of dawn were reddening the horizon as Christian reached the deck;
    and the black pall of smoke which had hovered over Tofoa&rsquo;s lofty peak
    was vanishing before the breath of a light air which was coming over the
    water from the south-east but had not yet stirred the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> canvas.</p>
  <p>Thomas Hayward, the midshipman of the watch, had mustered his men; the wheel
    had been relieved, the look-out stationed, and those of the watch who were
    not needed had gone forward to lay about the deck to doze or sleep.</p>
  <p>Leaning over the forecastle rail the look-out stood watching the movement
    of a huge shark that swam to and fro, close to the ship&rsquo;s port side.
    Presently Young, whose attention was drawn to the monster by the seaman,
    leant over the waist and watched also, and shuddered as he thought of Christian
    and his raft; then, knowing that Christian would not disturb him, he lay
    down between two guns.</p>
  <p>Pacing to and fro on the starboard side of the little poop the master&rsquo;s
    mate was waiting for the breeze to reach the ship, to give the order to brace
    the yards round to meet it. Perhaps had that light, cooling air which was
    now sweeping away sulphurous smoke from Tofoa&rsquo;s black sides, reached
    the silent ship and sent the crew hurrying about her decks, the desperate
    deed that was so soon to follow would never have been done. But as Christian
    looked aloft, he saw the pendant topsails give a feeble flap or two and then
    hang limp and dead as before; a faint breath of air touched his burning temples,
    and then silence, deep and oppressive, fell upon the ship again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A dead calm still,&rdquo; he muttered to himself; &ldquo;I wish to
    God a squall would put us on our beam ends or founder the ship&mdash;anything
    but this.&rdquo;  And then he stepped to the side and watched, with a curious
    sense of fascination, the sullen mass of the burning mountain.</p>
  <p>The utter impossibility of his leaving the ship unless to die by the teeth
    of the sharks was now forced upon his mind, for there beneath the counter
    he saw swimming to and fro a brute that would have made short work of him
    upon the fragile raft on which he had thought to venture his life. But yet&mdash;and
    his hands clenched savagely&mdash;submission to his lot was not possible&mdash;better
    death itself than endure it longer.</p>
  <p>Then his thoughts went back to a night on the white beach at Tahiti, the
    murmuring sway and rustle of plum&eacute;d palms, and the soft symphony of
    the throbbing surf on the distant reef, as Mahina&rsquo;s starlike eyes,
    dimmed with her farewell tears, looked past his own into the cloudless vault
    of heaven above them; and her passionate pleadings as she placed her trembling
    hands upon his arm seemed even now to be borne to him across the sea, and
    made the quick, hot blood of youth surge madly through his veins. Madness
    to think of her now! Yes, he knew that; but yet she loved him&mdash;would
    give her life for him, even. A savage! And he a King&rsquo;s officer, yet
    a slave to a vindictive tyrant&mdash;his life one daily round of insult and
    shame... A savage, yet a gloriously beautiful woman, whom only his duty to
    his King and country made him forget.</p>
  <p>Then his face flushed hotly. Forget her! What folly to try to deceive himself!
    He loved her!...He struck his clenched hand on the rail, and then his brain
    caught fire, his breath came in short, quick gasps, and the WAY OUT flashed
    into his mind.</p>
  <p>What would be his life at sea? Bligh, even if suffered until the ship returned
    to England, was not the only coarse, cruel tyrant in the Service. And it
    would be at least seven months ere the voyage was ended&mdash;seven months
    of torture, shame and misery. And over there, far beyond the sea-rim lay
    at least happiness with one who loved him.</p>
  <p>What did it matter after all? Perhaps after long, long years of service
    he would be put aside for other and younger men who had influence and social
    position. But then, he thought, he was an officer, a man of good family.
    The insults he had received might be forgotten were he one of the rough,
    coarse seamen for&rsquo;ard&mdash;such a man, for instance, as Quintal who,
    when brutally flogged by Bligh, swore he would kill his oppressor. But a
    seaman forgot and forgave a flogging, and an officer and a gentleman must
    forget and&mdash;no, not forgive&mdash;an insult from his superior.</p>
  <p>So, as he paced to and fro on the little poop and as the dawn began to break
    he sought to get rid of the devil tempting him; but he sought in vain. Again
    and again Mahina&rsquo;s soft voice and choking sobs sounded in his ears.  &ldquo;I
    will love thee for ever and ever and ever; how canst thou leave me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then the WAY OUT came into his heart again. It was so easy of accomplishment,
    too. He stopped suddenly in his hurried pacing to and fro and his quick mutterings;
    for the man at the wheel was regarding him curiously. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he
    muttered to himself, then cried aloud &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; He
    stepped to the break of the poop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hayward,&rdquo; he called in a hoarse whisper.</p>
  <p>Hayward jumped up from the hatch where he had been lying and came to the
    foot of the poop ladder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you call me, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;and his voice seemed like the voice or another man
    to the speaker himself&mdash; &ldquo;come up here and look after her. I want
    to go below and lash up my hammock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The midshipman looked inquiringly at him. &ldquo;You are ill, sir,&rdquo; he
    said; &ldquo;better get into your hammock instead. Hallet is sleeping on
    deck. Let me call him to relieve you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and his voice had a strange, sharp ring in it; &ldquo;come
    up here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not thinking of that raft again, Mr. Christian? There&rsquo;s
    been a shark swimming round the ship all night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn you, come up here when I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; said Hayward in a changed voice, and he walked
    aft to the binnacle without another word.</p>
  <p>Christian ran forward. The men of his watch lay sleeping on the fore-hatch,
    and among them he was quick to recognise two seamen, Quintal and McCoy, men
    who had been severely punished for trivial offences by Bligh. Both were good
    seamen, and, with Alexander Smith, had a particular liking for Christian,
    who had treated them with a great deal of kindness. The master&rsquo;s mate,
    now that he had determined to take the plunge, seemed to have rapidly sketched
    in his mind a feasible plan of action. He stooped down and awakened both
    of them quietly.</p>
  <p>The men sprang to their feet and would have called the rest of the sleeping
    watch, but with a warning gesture Christian stopped them. Then he motioned
    them to follow him to the waist of the ship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said he, speaking quickly; &ldquo;I have determined
    to take charge of this ship. Captain Bligh is no longer fit to command her.
    You two know him&mdash;<i>and you know me!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The seamen, half dazed at the suddenness of the question, hesitated a moment. &ldquo;My
    God, men!&rdquo; he said hoarsely, &ldquo;answer me. Heavens! Why do you
    hesitate? Are you men or cowards? You, Quintal, will you help me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help you, sir?&rdquo; and Matthew Quintal, a young man of scarce
    twenty-one years, seized his jumper on either side with his brawny hands
    and showed his broad, tattooed chest. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you
    mean, sir, but I&rsquo;ll follow you to hell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good; and now, McCoy, you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A grim smile flickered over McCoy&rsquo;s features. Like Quintal he was
    tattooed on both chest and arms, and was a broad-shouldered, strongly-made
    man, with deep-set eyes and a face denoting undaunted courage and resolution.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am with you, sir, and with Mat Quintal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go you then, McCoy, and rouse the armourer. Tell him I want the key
    of the arm-chest to shoot a shark. You, Quintal, rouse up Churchill, Muspratt,
    and Millward, and remind them of the flogging Bligh gave them at Tahiti;
    then bring them quietly to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The men stepped softly below to the &rsquo;tween decks to carry out their
    orders. As soon as their backs were turned young Smith, who, unobserved by
    Christian, lay awake upon the main-hatch, rose and came towards the officer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you about to do, Mr. Christian?&rdquo; he said in whispered
    tones. &ldquo;I heard your orders. Stop them, sir, before it is too late,
    for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Smith, is that you? It is too late, too late now. Will you sail
    under my orders, or will you make me shoot you, as I certainly will do if
    you give the alarm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young seaman&rsquo;s face paled. &ldquo;Your threat, sir, would not
    stop me if I had not already decided. I don&rsquo;t like to join in a mutiny,
    but it is your act, sir, and not mine; and you will have to answer for it,
    not me. Captain Bligh is no friend of mine; and I&rsquo;ll never desert a
    gentleman like you for him. You can count on me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian took his hand and gripped it fiercely. Then McCoy returned with
    the key of the arm-chest, which was kept aft; following him up the ladder
    came Quintal, accompanied by a fair-haired lad named Ellison, and Millward,
    one of the three for whom Quintal had gone below&mdash;all in a state of
    suppressed excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Quintal; &ldquo;Muspratt and Churchill
    are coming. They are with us, but they are below bringing up some of the
    others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For one brief moment the madness of the deed flashed across Christian&rsquo;s
    brain as he saw the figures of the seamen coming up from the &rsquo;tween
    decks; but the phrase &ldquo;they are with us&rdquo; reminded him that he
    was now a mutineer, and too far on his fatal course to draw back. He set
    his teeth and, in another minute, followed by his associates in the desperate
    venture, was serving out weapons to his party from the arm-chest.</p>
  <p>The noise made by the clank of the arms, slight as it was, had by this time
    wakened all the watch on deck; and Hayward, sitting on the wheel grating,
    was suddenly astounded to see Christian running towards him, cutlass in hand,
    followed by a number of armed seamen. The watch came tramping aft, and Christian,
    with a maddening sense of triumph in his heart, felt that the supreme moment
    had arrived.</p>
  <p>Quick as lightning he spoke some hot words to McCoy and Quintal, who repeated
    them to the thronging and excited sailors; Quintal and Ellison then rapidly
    passed weapons to four or five of the watch. These, stepping apart from the
    others, at once ranged themselves with Christian and his party.</p>
  <p>Still, despite the fierce, eager mutterings and the clash of arms from those
    on deck, there had been no great noise or confusion, and none of those who
    slept below were awakened; the mutineers, from ready force of habit, obeying
    unhesitatingly the orders of the passionate man who was once their officer
    and now their ringleader.</p>
  <p>There was a moment&rsquo;s pause; a dozen armed men, grim and determined,
    stood around their leader, waiting. As the sun leapt, a flaming ball of blood-red
    fire, from out the sleeping sea, Christian looked into the dark and working
    faces of the crew and waved his cutlass in the air; then, following their
    leader, the desperate men made a dash for Bligh&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
    Mutiny</b></h2>
  <p>Although it was now daylight the great cabin was still in semi-darkness
    when Christian, followed by Churchill, by Mills, the gunner&rsquo;s mate,
    and a seaman named Birkett, burst in upon the sleeping commander.</p>
  <p>As a flood of sunlight poured through the widely-opened door Bligh, aroused
    by the rush of hurrying feet, started up in his bunk to find a musket levelled
    at his heart, and the livid face of Christian looking savagely into his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he said in his quick, imperious way, preparing
    to spring out of his berth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you utter another word I&rsquo;ll shoot you,&rdquo; answered Christian,
    still presenting his piece; then suddenly he grounded it upon the deck with
    a crash and turned to his followers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drag him out and lash his hands behind his back,&rdquo; he cried.
    Again the commander tried to spring from his bed, his cheek white, not with
    fear but with suppressed rage; and again he threw himself back as Christian,
    whose eyes gleamed with a deadly, awful hatred, thrust the muzzle of the
    musket almost into his face.</p>
  <p>In another moment the men sprang upon Bligh, and with savage fury dragged
    him out of his bunk, and Mills, the instant his captain&rsquo;s feet touched
    the deck, seized his white, delicate hands and lashed them behind his back
    with a piece of native cinnet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drag him up on deck,&rdquo; and Christian stood aside to let the
    seamen execute his orders.</p>
  <p>The moment the struggling form of Bligh appeared on deck, young Ellison,
    who had taken the wheel, sprang towards them, tore a bayonet from the hands
    of a seaman near him, and launched himself upon the captain with an imprecation,
    but was thrust back by Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand back, boy!&rdquo; said Christian fiercely; &ldquo;I alone will
    deal with him. You, Smith, and you, McCoy, keep guard over him, and if he
    tries to utter a word show him no mercy&mdash;blow his brains out on the
    spot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In grim and ominous silence McCoy and Smith, with loaded muskets and fixed
    bayonets, stepped out and stationed themselves on either side of the bound
    man. Christian, hitherto doubtful of the fidelity of his party, noted with
    a savage satisfaction that McCoy&rsquo;s face was working with passion, and
    that he at least was prepared to carry out his leader&rsquo;s orders, while
    Smith&rsquo;s open, ruddy countenance was now set and stern.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Quintal, accompanied by a seaman named Williams, who was stripped
    to the waist and armed with a cutlass, had burst into the cabin of Fryer,
    the master and senior officer under Bligh, and ordered him on deck.</p>
  <p>Fryer sprang up with a loud cry and reached for his pistols, which were
    on a rack over his head; but Quintal was too quick for him and seized him
    by the wrist in a vice-like grip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, or, by God! you are a dead man, Mr. Fryer! Keep
    quiet and no one will hurt you; resist, and I&rsquo;ll run you through,&rdquo; and
    Williams leant across him and secured the pistols.</p>
  <p>The dangerous look in his eyes as he pointed them at the master&rsquo;s
    heart told Fryer that resistance meant death, but folding his arms across
    his chest he stood defiantly facing them both.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Have you taken the ship?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we have. Mr. Christian is our captain now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Captain Bligh? What have you done with him, you villains?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep a civil tongue in your head, Mr. Fryer; we are desperate men,
    and yet we don&rsquo;t want to kill you. I&rsquo;ll tell you what we intend
    doing with the captain,&rdquo; and he laughed grimly; &ldquo;we are going
    to put him in the small cutter and let him try living on three-quarters of
    a pound of yam a day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The small cutter! Why, her bottom is almost out; she&rsquo;s worm-eaten
    and full of holes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The boat is a lot too good for him even if she had no bottom at all,&rdquo; answered
    Quintal. &ldquo;Now go on deck, Mr. Fryer, and mind this, if you make one
    attempt at resistance you are a dead man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As soon as they reached the deck they saw Christian standing on the poop,
    giving orders to get out the boat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, Christian, what are you about?&rdquo; and Fryer,
    disregarding the menacing gestures of the mutineers, placed his hand on his
    shipmate&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Are you mad, man? Consider the consequences!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a word from you, Fryer!&rdquo; and Christian dashed aside his
    hand fiercely. &ldquo;I tell you that I have been in hell for weeks past.
    This dog, this infernal, malignant scoundrel, has brought all this upon himself.
    Stand back, I tell you&mdash;I am dangerous!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Christian, let me implore you...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Christian, let me speak. We have always been
    friends, and you may trust me. Resist this mad impulse before it is too late.
    Let the captain go down to his cabin again and leave me to tackle the men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a fearful oath Christian turned upon him and pointed his cutlass at
    Fryer&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;Silence! I tell you for the last time. I don&rsquo;t
    want to murder you, Fryer, but, by the God above me, I&rsquo;ll run you through
    if you don&rsquo;t cease!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fryer&rsquo;s bronzed cheek paled a moment, but his eye never quailed even
    when the cutlass point touched his breast. &ldquo;Will you not at least get
    out a better boat than the cutter?&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! by heavens, I will not! That boat is good enough for such a ruffian,&rdquo; then
    lowering his weapon he turned away and beckoned to Smith and McCoy to leave
    their prisoner and come to him, and for half a minute he conversed eagerly
    with them; while Bligh managed to get near enough to the master to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Fryer,&rdquo; he said quickly, yet calmly, &ldquo;there must
    be some of the officers and men who will not fail me in the hour of need.
    For God&rsquo;s sake, Fryer, try to find some of them ere this villain murders
    us all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But low as were his tones Christian heard him, and stepping up to the captain
    and Fryer, when within a foot or two of Bligh, he seized him by the shoulder
    and made as if to run him through.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Advance one step nearer, and by the God above us this cutlass goes
    through your cowardly, brutal heart! All the officers and men not with me
    are guarded below; you can do no good now; your authority on this floating
    hell is gone for ever. Here, two of you men take Mr. Fryer back to his cabin
    and lock him in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By this time the cutter was afloat; but Christian, realising that it would
    be impossible to crowd all of those who were well-affected to Bligh into
    her, had also lowered the launch, a six-oared boat measuring twenty-three
    feet from stem to stern.</p>
  <p>Two officers, Hayward and Hallet, and Elphinstone, Heywood, and Stewart
    (midshipmen), Ledward the surgeon, Cole the boatswain, Purcell the carpenter,
    and some seamen, meanwhile had been secured either below or on deck. One
    or two of the youngsters, among whom was Peter Heywood, a lad of fifteen,
    scarcely understanding what they were doing in the confusion and excitement,
    had been compelled to lend the mutineers a hand in getting out the launch;
    and Bligh&rsquo;s keen eye happened to fall on this boy as he was helping
    with the boat-falls.</p>
  <p>This was unfortunate for Heywood, who was at once put down by his commander
    as one of the ring-leaders, and suffered for it later.</p>
  <p>Suddenly Christian sprang upon the poop from the main-deck, and again held
    a consultation with Smith and McCoy. He turned and gazed savagely at Bligh,
    who met his look with unflinching calmness. For a few moments the two men
    regarded each other with looks of deadliest hatred, and then Fletcher Christian&rsquo;s
    voice rang out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pass all but Captain Bligh over the side into the boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then with oaths, struggles, and entreaties some twenty men were dragged
    along the deck and passed down into the boat. Bligh, who stood near the gangway,
    now made an appeal to the leader of the mutineers, who was on the poop watching
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you will stop this even now, Mr. Christian, I will promise nothing
    more shall come of it,&rdquo; he called out.</p>
  <p>The master&rsquo;s mate, flinging down the cutlass he still held, ran down
    the poop and faced his enemy; and the crew drew back as he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain Bligh, listen to me. I could kill you as you stand before
    me now, but I am no murderer. Tyrant and coward, I and those who have suffered
    with me have done with you for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A crimson flush dyed the commander&rsquo;s face from brow to chin, and he
    clenched his hands together tightly at the insulting words.</p>
  <p>Then the boat was veered astern, and McCoy, making the painter fast to the
    stern rail, turned to his leader for further orders.</p>
  <p>Going to the stern of the ship, Christian eyed the condition of the boat
    for a minute in silence, till the boatswain made an attempt to soften his
    heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Christian,&rdquo; he cried, standing up in the boat, &ldquo;let
    me plead with you for myself as well as Captain Bligh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, Mr. Cole,&rdquo; Christian answered. &ldquo;I have been in
    hell for the past two weeks and am determined to bear it no longer. You know,
    Cole, that during the whole voyage I have been treated like a dog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you not let the master, who is an old man, remain on board,
    and take some of the men out of the boat to lighten her?&rdquo; called Bligh,
    from where he stood at the gangway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; was the fierce reply; &ldquo;Mr. Fryer must go with you&mdash;do
    you think we are fools? But some or the men may come out of the boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A brief discussion among those in the boat ended in two or three seamen
    asking to be taken on board. The boat was hauled alongside under the counter
    and they ascended to the deck; and the boatswain, who was a relative of one
    of them, said to him, &ldquo;Goodbye and God bless you, my boy; but for my
    wife and children I too would stay with the ship also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again Bligh spoke, and there was now no sharp, imperious ring in his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Christian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pawn my honour as
    a King&rsquo;s officer&mdash;  I&rsquo;ll give you my solemn word, with God
    as my witness, never to think of this if you will desist from this outrage
    even now. Consider my wife and family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mutineer laughed mockingly. &ldquo;No, Captain Bligh. If you had any
    honour things would not have come to this pass; and if you had any regard
    for your wife and family you should have thought of them before, and not
    have behaved like the heartless villain you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, by Christian&rsquo;s orders, Bligh&rsquo;s clothes, his commission,
    private journal, and pocket-book were passed down, his hands were liberated,
    and he was ordered into the boat, which was hauled amidships to receive him.
    Christian handed to him over the side a book of nautical tables and his own
    quadrant, saying as he did so: &ldquo;That book is sufficient for every purpose,
    and you know my quadrant to be a good one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again the boat was veered astern. Bligh, standing up, raised his clenched
    hand and cursed the mutineers bitterly, swearing vengeance against those
    on the ship who would not help him to retake her. Laughs and jeers from the
    group on the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> poop was the only notice taken of him.
    Then for the last time the mutineers heard his voice and they ceased their
    gibes at the dignity of his tones as he spoke to those whom he thought yet
    faithful to him on board.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, my lads; you can&rsquo;t all come with me, but I will
    do you justice if ever I reach England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boat&rsquo;s painter was then cast off by Quintal, and the crew took
    to their oars, Bligh giving his commands in a calm and collected manner.
    The ocean was calm and only a faint breeze rippled the surface of the placid
    sea.</p>
  <p>As the departing commander and his crew dipped their oars into the water
    they saw Christian leaning on the rail over the stern, regarding them intently.
    Presently he stood up and gave an order; the yards were swung round, and
    a cheer came over to them from the ship&mdash; &ldquo;Hurrah for Tahiti!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>And as the crowded boat grows smaller and smaller to the vision of the desperate
    man who stands gazing at her from the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> stern, so let
    those in her go out of this story; they have no further part in it. But the
    memory of that daring boat voyage will live for ever in our country&rsquo;s
    annals. Who has not read of Bligh&rsquo;s indomitable courage and resolution,
    his admirable forethought for the eighteen suffering beings who braved the
    venture with him, from the first day when the over-crowded little craft was
    cast off from the ship until it sighted Timor, forty-one days after? His
    successful conduct of that terrible voyage over an all but unknown sea, losing
    as he did only one of his men, yet encountering the risk of wreck by violent
    storms, of massacre by savage islanders, of the pangs of hunger and the agonies
    of thirst, well entitled him to the honours that his country paid him. In
    that act of his life he played his part nobly, and all else that he did ill,
    when measured against such fortitude in the face of danger and death, may
    well be forgotten.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  &ldquo;Hurrah for Tahiti!&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Standing with folded arms and gloomy face, in which all passion seemed to
    be dead, the leader of the mutineers watched the launch gradually increase
    her distance from the <i>Bounty</i>. The last words of Bligh as the boat
    was cast off still rang in his ears: &ldquo;I will do you justice if ever
    I reach England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These were ominous words, and they brought vividly before him the horrors
    of his situation. &ldquo;If justice is done,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;what
    will become of me? My God! Why did I not put an end to my life before this
    madness got the better of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The wild cheer of &ldquo;Hurrah for Tahiti!&rdquo; from his followers roused
    him to a sense of his present position. It was evident that to others besides
    himself a return to Tahiti was one of the inducements for the desperate deed
    just accomplished. And he was quick to realise, too, that for the safety
    of them all he must assert himself and take command of the ship. Even had
    Bligh not heard that defiant cry as the mutineers swung round the yards,
    Tahiti would be the first place thought of by those who would surely come
    in search of them. How soon would that search begin? That it would begin
    sooner or later he never doubted. The possibility of Bligh and those with
    him not being picked up by some ship, or not reaching some place of safety,
    never occurred to him. And yet every one but himself realised how small indeed
    was the chance that those in the frail little launch would escape death in
    one or other of the lingering and dreadful forms to which he had so mercilessly
    consigned them.</p>
  <p>The murmuring of voices roused him from his gloomy reflections, and presently
    McCoy, Quintal, Smith, and others of the more active of the mutineers gathered
    round their leader, while the rest of the men, forming a group on the main
    deck, were talking in excited tones of what ought to be done for the best.</p>
  <p>He turned to those near him and spoke, with every trace of excitement absent
    from his voice and manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Men, remember that our future safety from death at the yard-arm depends
    upon the discipline of a well-ordered ship being maintained. Now that the
    thing is done we have to guard ourselves for the future. Therefore, as you
    all have to rely upon me for the navigation of the ship, and as I am the
    only officer left, until we have settled upon some safe island, and got rid
    of her, you will have to obey my orders. Are you agreed to that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Mr. Christian; you can depend upon us,&rdquo; they answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then. I have decided to take the ship to Tubuai. It will
    not be safe for us to remain at Tahiti; search will be made for the <i>Bounty</i>,
    and Tahiti will be the first place a ship will visit. You, Smith, McCoy,
    and Quintal, who were among the first to stand by me in this undertaking,
    can arrange with me a plan for our mutual safety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But we want to go back to Tahiti,&rdquo; cried several of the others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Christian quietly, &ldquo;you want to go back
    because of the women you have left there. Do not fear, you shall see Tahiti
    again. Now listen, and I will tell you what my plan is. First, let us go
    to Tubuai and form a settlement there. Then, when that is finished, I propose
    to return to Tahiti and bring away as many people as choose to come&mdash;that
    is if these women still run in your minds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a bitter ring in his last words, and Smith, in a low voice, asked
    him to humour the men more, &ldquo;for remember, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you
    have given them their liberty and you will have to take care how you cross
    them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The caution was needed; most of the men by no means relished the prospect
    of delay in returning to the delights of Tahiti, and one of them in no uncertain
    manner expressed his sentiments, adding&mdash; &ldquo;You know Mr. Christian,
    we have a couple of navigators left, if you can&rsquo;t hit it with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked Christian quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Stewart and Mr. Heywood are both below.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; and Fletcher Christian turned fiercely to Quintal. &ldquo;Why
    were these two&mdash;one a mere child&mdash;not sent away in the boat? Are
    you such villains as not to have told me, if you knew it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was just an idea of ours,&rdquo; answered the seaman who had first
    spoken&mdash;Williams, the Guernsey man; &ldquo;we thought it just as well
    to have more than one navigator on board in case anything went wrong with
    you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian did not reply. He felt that he had no claim to their obedience
    other than they chose to admit, and that this was but a reasonable precaution
    on their parts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are these two now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Down below; kept prisoners until all the row was over,&rdquo; answered
    Williams. &ldquo;Shall I pass the word for them to be brought upon deck?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Christian; &ldquo;bring them up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart and Heywood&mdash;the first-named an acting mate, and the second
    a mere, ruddy-faced boy on his first voyage to sea&mdash;were accordingly
    brought up, and to the surprise of every one, as they came up the ladder,
    they were followed by the swarthy-faced Edward Young.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does this mean, Mr. Christian?&rdquo; said Stewart as soon as
    he reached the poop-deck. &ldquo;Why have we been kept prisoners? I know
    that you have taken the ship and turned Captain Bligh adrift with the other
    officers. Why have we been detained against our wills?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not my fault you are here,&rdquo; answered Christian gloomily. &ldquo;I
    thought that you were gone in the boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However that may be,&rdquo; replied Stewart excitedly, &ldquo;because
    you have turned pirate that is no reason why we should do so. I would rather
    die than remain with you and be branded as a mutineer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I too, Mr. Christian,&rdquo; broke in young Heywood. &ldquo;I
    have a family at home, and no act of mine shall bring disgrace on them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian smiled bitterly at the lad. &ldquo;These are hard words&mdash;but
    God knows I cannot blame you for them. Yet I hope, my boy, that you will
    forgive me for the misfortune I have brought upon you; and I promise that
    at the first port we reach, if it be a spot where it is likely a ship may
    touch, you can separate from us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair enough,&rdquo; said a seamen named Thompson. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas
    I and Williams who kept you below against your wills; and I for one will
    help you to leave the ship by and by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what have you to say, Mr. Young?&rdquo; asked Christian, turning
    to him; &ldquo;how do you come to be among us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young man laughed quietly and leant against the skylight as he answered. &ldquo;I
    am here of my own free will. I heard what was going on on deck and quietly
    got out of the way until you had decided matters&mdash;and I&rsquo;m damned
    glad you have decided &rsquo;em this way. Bligh is a good riddance, and while
    I didn&rsquo;t want to take an active part in the row I wasn&rsquo;t going
    to help him; and so long as you have the command I am ready to serve under
    you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well done, sir,&rdquo; cried several of the men at this speech, which
    was delivered with the utmost coolness, and evoked audible expressions of
    disgust and contempt from Stewart and Heywood; and then one of the seamen
    made some coarse jest about Alrema and Tahiti.</p>
  <p>A look of contempt passed over Christian&rsquo;s features as he glanced
    at his dark, saturnine-faced ally, and for the instant he forgot he was the
    leader of mutineers, and felt as Stewart and Heywood did towards the young
    man. Then he remembered the situation, and taking Young by the hand, said
    in mingled tones of contempt and friendliness: &ldquo;Thank you, Young. I
    am glad that I am not the only &lsquo;infernal scoundrel&rsquo; (mocking
    Bligh&rsquo;s voice) on board the <i>Bounty</i>.&rdquo; Then turning to the
    others he said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, men, are you agreed? Shall we set a course for Tubuai? Fortunately
    for us the south-east trades have not yet set in for good, and we ought to
    make a quick run there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; cried several of the leading spirits among
    them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll abide by you; let it be Tubuai.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then keep her east-south-east,&rdquo; said Christian to the man at
    the wheel, and as the ship&rsquo;s head came to the wind a point or two,
    the yards were braced up and the little barque began to slip through the
    water with the now freshening breeze.</p>
  <p>An hour later, when Tofoa was but a pale blue cone on the horizon, an agreement
    was arrived at that Young, Churchill, Quintal, Smith, and McCoy should, with
    the new commander, at once settle a definite plan of action for the future;
    and the rest of the mutineers, coming aft, shook hands with one another and
    swore they would faithfully adhere to whatever was decided upon.</p>
  <p>Then, under the direction of Young, the breadfruit plants were taken out
    of their racks and passed to two seamen, who, standing on the cabin transoms,
    with many a jest at this ending of the scientific expedition, pitched them
    out of the stern ports into the sea.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    The Council in the Cabin</b></h2>
  <p>The council in the now denuded cabin of the <i>Bounty</i> was conducted
    in a friendly enough manner. In Smith and Young&mdash;both of whom were well-liked
    by the crew&mdash;Fletcher Christian had two powerful allies. Young,
    disgusted with life at sea under such a tyrannical commander as Bligh, yet
    without the high spirit that had moved Christian to such a desperate deed
    as mutiny, was willing and indeed eager to lead the life of luxurious ease
    that they all anticipated in the future; for he fully recognised that he,
    in joining his fortunes with those of Christian, had for ever dissevered
    himself from all hope of returning to England; and while he despised all
    those around him save Christian, he was yet perfectly agreeable to associate
    with them now on terms of equality.</p>
  <p>Smith, in his strong devotion to Christian, seemed to have thrown over the
    teachings of his youth, and showed by his earnest manner that he was ready
    to stand or fall by his new leader.</p>
  <p>McCoy and Quintal, rough seamen, from long habits of obedience and following
    the lead of Young and Smith, acquiesced in all that was proposed; the only
    doubtful supporter was Churchill, who wanted the ship to be headed for Tahiti
    at once. But obstinate as was the latter, he had no part in the plotting
    that was already going on among some of the crew to compel Christian to abandon
    the idea of Tubuai and make for Tahiti instead.</p>
  <p>The first matter decided was that Christian should be treated in every respect
    as would be a King&rsquo;s officer commanding the ship, until such time as
    the mutineers had found a place of refuge on some island where they would
    be safe from discovery or capture. No one of those who sat in council in
    the cabin for a moment thought of ever returning to Europe to face the ignominious
    death that would certainly await them; and Young, in his mocking manner,
    took care to show the seamen who sat with him at the cabin table that it
    was better for them all to die of old age on some island than be hanged at
    the yard-arm in England.</p>
  <p>Following this, it was agreed that Young, being well liked by the crew,
    should be second in command and take charge of one watch; while Mills, the
    gunner&rsquo;s mate, who was the next in rank as well as the oldest man on
    board, should take charge of the other half of the ship&rsquo;s company.</p>
  <p>Stewart and Heywood were to be regarded as &ldquo;prisoners at large,&rdquo;  and
    this decision was at once made known to them; but they both refused the privilege
    of the freedom of the ship if it involved any assurance on their part of
    loyalty to the mutineers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send for them, Mr. Christian,&rdquo; suggested Smith, &ldquo;and
    see if you can&rsquo;t get them to join us. They&rsquo;ll listen to you,
    I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Presently the two lads were brought into the cabin, and both frankly stated
    to Christian their intention of endeavouring, by some means or other, to
    reach England and doing all in their power to bring him and those with him
    to justice when they got there.</p>
  <p>A dangerous look came into Edward Young&rsquo;s eyes. Heywood saw it, but
    although his fresh, boyish face paled a moment, he returned Young&rsquo;s
    frown with a look of defiance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said Christian shortly; &ldquo;but I tell you,
    foolish boys, you are treading on dangerous ground. Take my advice and keep
    your intentions to yourselves, else you will repent your folly. There are
    men on board the ship who have gone too far to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To hesitate at pitching two damned young fools overboard,&rdquo; broke
    in Young savagely; but a look from Christian made him cease. And then the
    council came to an end.</p>
  <p>The new commander, however, took no steps to prevent Stewart and Heywood
    from going among the crew, though he knew they were endeavouring to form
    a party for recapturing the ship. He was confident that however some of the
    men might attempt to frustrate his plan of first making Tubuai, none would
    be mad enough to risk destruction by listening to any talk about the ship
    being recaptured.</p>
  <p>But Quintal, McCoy, and Smith, fortunately for the success of the enterprise,
    did not share their leader&rsquo;s faith, and a few days after they had returned
    to their old duties as able seamen they found that the daring midshipmen
    had so far succeeded in alienating some of the crew from Christian that a
    plot was ripe to retake the vessel.</p>
  <p>One night when the ship was some two or three miles to the southward of
    Savage Island&mdash;an isolated but fertile spot about three hundred miles
    from Tofoa&mdash;Quintal stood at the forward weather rail, gazing at the
    high cliffs of grey coral rock against whose jagged sides the ocean rollers
    dashed unceasingly and sent showers of spray high up to the dense foliage
    which grew on the verge of their summits. Presently he was joined by Smith,
    who whispered&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heywood and Stewart, with five others, will try to retake the ship
    to-morrow evening. Don&rsquo;t talk to me now, but follow me aft by and by;
    then we can tell Christian. That scoundrel Coleman was the first to join
    them, and has promised to serve them out arms to-morrow night. All of them,
    except Coleman, are in the gunner&rsquo;s watch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A quarter of an hour later, Christian, with a grim smile, dismissed Smith
    and Quintal and watched for his chance. About eleven o&rsquo;clock a furious
    rain squall swept down from the south-east, and among those who were sent
    aloft to take in sail by the gunner&rsquo;s mate, who was in charge of the
    watch, were the five men who had agreed to support Heywood and Stewart. While
    these were busy aloft and Coleman was asleep&mdash;it being his watch below&mdash;Smith,
    McCoy, and Quintal and another seaman made a dash for the arm-chest and conveyed
    it to the cabin.</p>
  <p>Arming all those men of whose loyalty he was absolutely assured, Christian
    waited till the men came down from aloft and the watch was about to be relieved.
    Then he called the plotters aft and addressed them. A ship&rsquo;s lantern,
    held by a seaman who stood beside him, threw a broad ray of light upon the
    anxious faces of the men gathered on the soaking deck; and then for the first
    time they saw that the men in Young&rsquo;s watch were grouped aft behind
    Christian and his fellow officer.</p>
  <p>Calling upon the five plotters each by name, Christian addressed them&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have discovered that you mean to retake the ship. Now weigh my
    words well: if bloodshed follows it will be your fault. Some of you who are
    anxious to get back to Tahiti have listened to two foolish boys, little thinking
    of the madness of such an attempt. The arm-chest is now in my cabin, and
    at the first attempt on your part to take the command of the ship from me
    I will shoot every man concerned in it. God knows I do not want to be your
    leader longer than I can help, and no one among you is less content than
    I, but,&rdquo; and here he turned to those immediately around him, &ldquo;it
    is necessary for the general safety of us all that I, and I alone, should
    have charge of the ship; and, by God! while she remains afloat and I alive
    I will keep command.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A deep growl of approval came from those of his party who stood near him
    as he finished; then in gentle tones Christian addressed Heywood and Stewart,
    who had now come on deck. Although he seemed outwardly cool the lads could
    see that he was labouring under strong emotion and was striving to speak
    to them calmly and dispassionately. He besought them to make no further effort
    to retake the ship, but to support him in his authority&mdash;such as it
    was, he said bitterly&mdash;till the ship finally reached Tahiti, and assured
    them that this course was best for all parties. &ldquo;And you, Heywood,&rdquo; he
    said kindly, placing his hand on the lad&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;answer
    me this: have you, or you, Stewart, ever known me to tell you a lie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Christian, never,&rdquo; replied the boy emphatically, looking
    him directly in the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then, my lads, I beg of you both to believe that it would be
    a bitter sorrow to me to hurt either of you. I have suffered too much myself
    to wreck your future lives by any needless act of mine; nor will you be in
    bodily danger unless you drive us to stern measures. And I swear to you that
    I bear you no ill-will for what has passed...no, my lads, none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Loyal as they were to their duty, both Stewart and Heywood saw the force
    of his argument and believed in his promise to set them free as soon as possible;
    and assured him they would cause no further trouble. Then the watch was changed
    and the matter ended.</p>
  <p>But from that time the arm-chest was carefully watched by men on whom reliance
    could be placed, and every night Churchill, who now kept the key, made his
    bed upon the box, and slept with a brace of loaded pistols by his side.</p>
  <p>Day after day the <i>Bounty</i> crept slowly along to the eastward, till
    early one morning the look-out sighted the two misty blue peaks of Tubuai
    rising from the sea. As the ship drew nearer to the land, the peaks united
    at the base and showed an island of verdant hills and bright, shining beaches
    of golden sand encompassed by a wide belt of surf-beaten coral reef.</p>
  <p>The wind was light but steady, and Christian succeeded in working the ship
    through the passage on the north-west side without much trouble, although
    she was beset by a great number of canoes filled with natives who made unmistakable
    signs of defiance to the white men.</p>
  <p>As soon as the ship was secured, Christian and his men sought to induce
    the natives to come on board, but only one or two responded to his invitation;
    and they, by their suspicious and haughty demeanour, showed their distrust
    and dislike of the white strangers. Not a woman or child was visible in the
    canoes, and every man was armed with a club and spear. The only dress they
    wore was a girdle or rather bandage round their loins, and a turban of <i>tappa</i> cloth
    round their heads of glossy, jet-black and curling hair. They were a far
    handsomer and more active race than the Tahitians, much lighter in colour,
    and of a daring and warlike disposition, and their open hostility to the <i>Bounty</i> party
    was every minute becoming more apparent.</p>
  <p>Not anticipating such a reception as this, Christian was in a dilemma. To
    have to force a landing would be a serious matter, and after a brief consultation
    with some of the men, this idea was abandoned. The ship had been brought
    there by him against the wishes of the majority, and to have to fight for
    a footing was, as Williams said, &ldquo;more than they had stomach for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will not ask you to fight,&rdquo; said Christian, &ldquo;for that
    would only mean useless slaughter on both sides. These people are, as you
    can see, brave and determined, and it is a bitter disappointment to me to
    find them so hostile. But yet I have to consider this&mdash;the island, as
    you see for yourselves, is of amazing fertility and I do not think that we
    could find a better place to live in. Further, it is not likely to be visited
    by ships, and would be a safe retreat for us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough, Mr. Christian,&rdquo; answered one of the
    seamen. &ldquo;Much as I want to get to Tahiti, I only want to do so to get
    the woman I left there&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a lot more like me. I, for
    one, think that Tubuai is a better place for us than Tahiti.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Martin; &ldquo;and although I want to go to
    Tahiti for the same reason as most of us, I&rsquo;m willing to come back
    here. To my mind this island is far better; but at the same time we don&rsquo;t
    want our throats cut.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Satisfied that the crew would be willing to return, Christian then proposed
    that they should make for Tahiti, embark as many Tahitians as would come
    with them, return to Tubuai, and either establish friendly relations with
    the people or force a landing and build a fort.</p>
  <p>To this the men readily assented, for they could easily see that the island
    was not only very rich and fertile, but also well out of the way of discovery,
    and with a little trouble could be made capable of resisting the attack of
    even an European force.</p>
  <p>So, with hundreds of natives still paddling about the ship in their red-ochre-painted
    canoes and uttering loud cries of defiance, the anchor was hove up, the ship
    warped out to sea again, and with a light breeze filling her canvas, headed
    due north for Tahiti.</p>
  <p>The following morning Christian collected together in the main cabin all
    the curiosities given to Bligh and his officers by the people of Tahiti,
    as well as all the clothes and other property left by those who had been
    sent away with him. Then he mustered the crew aft and addressed them, pointing
    to the piles of goods on the cabin deck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, my fellow pirates, is the first batch of plunder&mdash;you
    see I call things by their right names. Draw lots and divide it among yourselves.
    Everything that is there will be of value to you for the purposes of barter
    with the natives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sneering tone in which he spoke caused many an angry look, but without
    another word he turned from them and went on deck.</p>
  <p>Four days later, on the 5th of June&mdash;thirty-eight days after the mutiny&mdash;the
    peak of Orohena lay right ahead; at dawn the following day the <i>Bounty</i> sailed
    into Matavai Bay, and as the cries of welcome were heard, for awhile all
    else was forgotten.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
    Pipiri the Areoi</b></h2>
  <p>On the same hill where nearly six weeks before she had watched the lessening
    sails of her lover&rsquo;s ship sink below the horizon, Mahina again sat
    looking seaward. Day after day since the <i>Bounty</i> had sailed she had
    laid her simple offerings of fruit upon the altar of Oro and prayed for Christian&rsquo;s
    return to her, and night after night when the rest of the people were singing
    and dancing upon the broad sward in front of Tin&#257;&rsquo;s house she,
    sometimes accompanied by Alrema, sat on the hill and the two girls thought
    or talked of Young and Christian. But to-day her friend was not with her;
    and only an hour before angry words had passed between her old, fierce-tempered
    mother and herself about her white lover, and the girl, after a passionate
    burst of tears, had stolen silently away to the hill to be alone with her
    thoughts.</p>
  <p>Old Manuhuru, like the average civilised mother, had certain views for her
    daughter, and ever since the <i>Bounty</i> had sailed had sought to induce
    the girl to forget her white lover and accept for her husband Pipiri the
    Areoi priest. And of all the men of Tahiti who had sought her love Mahina
    hated most the tall, handsome young Areoi, for he was steeped to the lips
    in bloodshed. Only a few years before the <i>Bounty</i> came to Tahiti, Pipiri
    had with his own hands slain his two children, according to the rites of
    the horrible fraternity, which demanded that a candidate entering upon his
    novitiate should publicly kill his children and put his wife aside, unless
    she too should become an Areoi. Mahina had seen the awful deed, had heard
    the wail of agony from the mother of the children when their ruthless father
    had plunged his knife into their bosoms; and had fled the scene with terror
    in her heart, for Pipiri had long sought her love, and she knew he had only
    become an Areoi that he might force her to marry him.</p>
  <p>The girl, by every device she could contrive, avoided meeting the young
    priest, and to her great joy, since she had shown her open preference for
    Christian, Pipiri had not molested her further, although she had frequently
    seen him talking earnestly with her mother. Only once since Christian had
    sailed had she met him. She was returning with Alrema from her look-out on
    the hill, when the Areoi sprang upon the girls as they passed along the narrow,
    palm-shaded path. His face was stained scarlet with the juice of the <i>mati</i> berry,
    his long black hair hung loosely down over his copper-coloured shoulders,
    and his gleaming savage eyes struck terror into her heart; but Alrema faced
    him dauntlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ho, Mahina, daughter of Manuhuru, and Alrema the saucy-tongued,&rdquo;  he
    cried mockingly, &ldquo;whence come ye? Are ye still waiting for the white
    men who will never return? Dost think that thy eyes can draw back the great
    outriggerless canoe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is that to thee, Pipiri the slaughterer?&rdquo; asked Alrema,
    tearing away her hand from his grasp; &ldquo;and seek not to frighten us.
    Think not that because thou hast become an Areoi <i>I</i> fear thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I know that thou fearest no one,&rdquo; replied the priest fiercely; &ldquo;but &rsquo;tis
    not thee for whom I waited here. Thou art but a chattering fool, whose tongue
    I may yet cut off at the roots; but it is thee, Mahina, who hast eaten into
    my heart&mdash;so now I ask thee once more, Why dost thou wait for this white
    lover of thine? He will never return, I tell thee. Heed not the talk of this
    fool Alrema and those like her&mdash; who have listened to their white lover&rsquo;s
    lies. Fifty and two days have gone since the ship sailed, and I tell thee
    thou wilt never see thy white man again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mahina took courage from Alrema, whose rounded bosom panted with rage at
    the mocking words of the Areoi, and she sought to soften Pipiri&rsquo;s savage
    nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should I alone be the one woman for whom thou carest, Pipiri?
    There are many others better than I. So pray thee let me be as I am. Yet
    if Kirisiani comes not back in three moons from now, then I will be thy wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Areoi laughed. &ldquo;Nay, in less time than that. Only just now thy
    mother swore to me that I might take thee in one moon; for in me, too, is
    the same blood that flows in thy veins&mdash;the blood of the race of Afit&#257;,
    and for that alone thou shouldst come to me.&rdquo; Then without further
    words he stood aside and let the girls pass on to their homes.</p>
  <p>That was ten days ago, and Mahina, as she sat with her face leaning upon
    her hands and gazed seaward, felt the tears well up into her eyes. Her mother
    had indeed promised her in marriage to the blood-stained Areoi, whom the
    old woman regarded as a superior man even to the highest chief in the land
    on account of the blood-tie between them, and because of the bitter, undying
    hatred he showed to the white men. This she was always ready to stimulate,
    telling him scornfully that he knew not how to dispose of a rival or he would
    have enticed Christian from the village and killed him.</p>
  <p>Away to the westward the blue, sailless ocean sparkled and shimmered in
    the rays of the sun; and nearer in, though far below where she sat, the long
    rollers of pale emerald swept in serried lines upon the shelving reef of
    the little bay, and wavering clouds of misty spume drifted slowly before
    the wind as the rollers curled over and burst upon the rocky barrier on their
    passage to the shore.</p>
  <p>For nearly an hour Mahina sat thus, hearing no sound save the soft crooning
    note of some resting pigeon in the silent forest around her, or the faint
    murmur of voices from a party of men in fishing canoes who had landed on
    the white beach far below; then, with despair in her heart, she rose to return
    to the village. And there, with his back against the bole of a great tamanu
    tree, again stood Pipiri the Areoi, looking at her intently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why dost thou watch me?&rdquo; she asked, trying to pass him, but
    he stayed her gently with his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because, oh foolish one, I love thee, I love thee; and I hate to
    see thy cheeks, that were once so round and soft, grow thin and drawn with
    the folly that is consuming thee. See,&rdquo; and he pointed with his bronzed
    and brawny arm to the ocean, &ldquo;see how evenly the sky touches the water,
    as the half-shell of a coconut would stand upon my hand. No white sail will
    break through the sky-rim, and no white man shall come between thee and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If Oro so wills it. But the time that my mother has given me to wait
    is not yet gone; why dost thou for ever trouble me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because Orotetefa hath spoken to me from his altar and told me to
    wait no longer, for thy white lover will never return. And to-morrow shall
    our marriage feast be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He ceased suddenly, for there was borne to them through the silence of the
    surrounding forest a cry that sent the blood dancing through the veins of
    the girl before him with a maddening joy&mdash; &ldquo;A ship! a ship!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She sprang away from him to the verge of the hill and there&mdash;not a
    far distant speck on the horizon, but rounding the northern point&mdash;was
    a ship, standing in before the breeze and furling her sails as she approached
    the anchorage.</p>
  <p>A quick mist filled the girl&rsquo;s dark eyes, and she staggered for a
    moment upon her feet. Then she turned and looked into the rage-distorted
    face of the Areoi priest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast lied to me, Pipiri the Areoi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In another moment, evading the savage grasp with which he sought to stay
    her, she was flying down the hillside to the beach. </p>
  <p class="note">The Areois were an extraordinary fraternity, followers of the gods Orotetefa
    and Urutetefa, and Mr. Ellis gives a full description of them in his &ldquo;Polynesian
    Researches.&rdquo; They were, he says, not only priests, and so regarded
    by the people as allied to the gods themselves, but strolling players and
    privileged libertines. The association was composed of seven classes. A candidate&rsquo;s
    admission to the first class was signalised by the slaughter of his children,
    as a proof of his devotion to the principle of infanticide. Their power and
    influence was beyond comprehension to the civilised mind; and their rites
    and ceremonies were of so bloody and revolting a nature, so utterly monstrous
    and degrading that they &ldquo;appeared to have placed their invention on
    the rack to discover the most hideous crimes of which it was possible for
    man to be guilty.&rdquo;  Yet for all this the natives of the Society Islands,
    especially the chiefs, looked upon them with feelings akin to veneration.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
    Together Again</b></h2>
  <p>Before the panting girl reached the beach the <i>Bounty</i> was at anchor
    and her deck crowded with natives, who greeted Christian and the ship&rsquo;s
    company with the most extravagant manifestations of joy. For him personally
    they had always shown the liveliest regard; not only was he one of Tuti&rsquo;s
    people, but his uniform kindness to them had won their hearts, and, indeed,
    Bligh himself was the only one of the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> company whom
    they feared more than they loved.</p>
  <p>Tin&#257; himself was among the first to board the ship, and his frank,
    ingenuous countenance betrayed his astonishment at the return of his friends,
    while his wondering, inquiring glance as his eye roved over the group of
    officers on the poop-deck showed that he was quick to discover the
    absence of Bligh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ia oro na oe, Kirisiani</i>,&rdquo;  he said with a smile, advancing
    to Christian, &ldquo;and where is the chief Pirai? And why hath the ship
    come back so soon? Hast thou already been to Peretane and returned in three
    moons?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fletcher Christian was quick with his answer. &ldquo;Nay, Tin&#257;, friend
    of my heart, we have been fortunate. See, when we neared the island that
    is called Tonga we there met the great chief, he whom you call Tuti. He took
    on board his ship our chief Pirai and many others of our people and all the
    presents of breadfruit trees for our king. And then said he to me, &lsquo;Go
    thou back, Kirisiani, to the country of Tin&#257;, my friend, and say these
    words to him,  &lsquo;I, Tuti, his friend, need yams and pigs and other food;
    my people are many and I cannot feed them all, for the sea is wide between
    here and Britain.&rsquo; And for these things have I returned to Tahiti,
    while Tuti awaits me at Tonga. And for a gift he hath sent thee by me much
    iron, for he knoweth that iron is needed by thy people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tin&#257; smiled pleasantly and expressed his earnest desire to serve both
    Cook and Bligh; and he and many minor chiefs who had flocked on board greeted
    every one of the mutineers as old and dear friends.</p>
  <p>For some minutes great excitement and confusion prevailed, and in the midst
    of the pleasant clamour a small canoe, paddled by two young women, ran alongside
    the ship, and Mahina sprang up the ladder on deck, and with a soft, joyous
    cry threw herself into Christian&rsquo;s arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast returned, my own,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Oro hath
    heard my prayers, and thy heart is still mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An angry flush for a moment suffused Christian&rsquo;s cheek at this demonstration
    before the whole ship&rsquo;s company, and drawing her aside he rebuked her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina,&rdquo; he said severely, &ldquo;in my country it is only
    the base and lower sort who show their hearts in this way before all men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl trembled, but quickly recovered herself, and her dark eyes flashed.
    Drawing back from her lover she spoke in such tones of wounded pride that
    Christian felt his cheeks burn with shame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Truly, I had forgotten that the blood of the white man is cold,&rdquo;  then
    placing her hands on her eyes, she walked away, and the hot tears trickled
    through her fingers.</p>
  <p>Few as were her words, they touched him. He remembered that since he had
    parted from this girl two months before the whole of his life had been changed.
    Her passionate devotion to him during the five months the <i>Bounty</i> first
    remained at Tahiti was the one bright spot which then had made life endurable,
    and now, her faithful heart bursting with love for him, he had met her tender
    embraces with what to her was cold brutality. &ldquo;She alone is the only
    soul on earth who will love me to the end,&rdquo; he thought bitterly; &ldquo;she
    alone will not shrink from contact with me, in the time to come.&rdquo; He
    followed and took her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;forgive me, for thou knowest
    that for thy sake I have thrown away for ever my country and kindred. Thou
    art the one woman dear to me in the world, and thy life is my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She flung her arms round his neck and, caring not for those who stood about
    on the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> deck, kissed him again and again in all the
    abandonment of her fondness.</p>
  <p>Whispering that she might wait for him in the cabin, he gently disengaged
    her arms, and turned away to look for Tin&#257;.</p>
  <p>That night every one of the mutineers, except their chief and Smith, went
    ashore to their native friends; and as the sound of their singing and dancing
    floated across the bay to the ship, Mahina, in the cabin of the <i>Bounty</i>,
    lifted her eyes to Christian&rsquo;s and contentedly laid her head upon his
    breast.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>The <i>Bounty</i> was once more ready for sea. Great numbers of hogs, goats,
    and fowls were cheerfully given by the islanders to Christian and his companions,
    and, for a small parcel of some red feathers-which were highly prized
    by the natives&mdash;Tin&#257; presented them with a cow and bull which had
    been left on the island by Captain Cook. Water, wood, <i>mahi</i> (baked
    fermented breadfruit), yams, coconuts and breadfruit were also put on board
    in profusion. After making a careful survey of the ship and listening to
    various suggestions made by the crew for her repair, the leader of the mutineers
    went ashore for the last time before his marriage, which was to take place
    on the following day.</p>
  <p>Accompanied by Smith, the young man, after landing and pushing through the
    crowd of natives who had gathered on the beach and sought to detain him in
    friendly converse, made his way to a native house of considerable size and
    handsome construction.</p>
  <p>Here Heywood and Stewart were living. The latter had renewed his former
    tender relations with Nuia, who, the moment Christian entered, met him with
    a bright smile of welcome.</p>
  <p>Then she went for Stewart and Heywood, who were lying on the village lawn
    under the shade of a breadfruit tree. Christian had permitted the two young
    officers to leave the ship on the day after her arrival, principally because
    of the passionate entreaties of Nuia, who imagined he was her lover&rsquo;s
    enemy and would kill him for some neglect of duty, and secondly because he
    had induced both not to reveal the true cause of his return to the islanders,
    so long as the <i>Bounty</i> remained at Tahiti. As for the natives themselves,
    although they had begun to suspect that all things were not quite as the
    mutineers represented them, yet they believed that Cook had good reasons
    for sending the ship back to Tahiti; and that he <i>had</i> done so they
    never for a moment doubted. So Tin&#257; and his people were pleased enough
    when Christian proposed that some of them should sail away in the <i>Bounty</i> and
    visit Peretane and King George. To further the deception, Christian stated
    that he had no objection to some of his own men, who had allied themselves
    to native women, remaining behind at Tahiti. This proposal was made to account
    for the fact that besides Heywood and Stewart several of the crew had determined
    to sever themselves from the ship&rsquo;s company; not for the same reasons
    which animated the two midshipmen, but because the women with whom they were
    living did not care to venture to sea in the &ldquo;great outriggerless canoe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a few minutes Heywood and Stewart entered the house.</p>
  <p>Both of them looked cheerful and well, and Christian could not help feeling
    pleased at the friendly manner in which they returned his greeting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have come to see you, perhaps for the last time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
    to thank you for the manner in which you have kept your promise to a broken
    and disgraced man. Heaven knows, my lads, that I would gladly assist you
    to return to England if it were in my power. But have no fear; that a ship
    will be sent out here is an absolute certainty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Heywood ventured to question him as to when he intended sailing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not ask me,&rdquo; he replied hurriedly, while the hot blood mounted
    to his forehead; &ldquo;it may be soon, it may not be for a week, but I cannot
    come and see you again...and I want you to shake hands with me before I go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After a momentary hesitation Stewart held out his hand, but young Heywood,
    whose eyes were filled with tears, with boyish impulsiveness sprang forward
    before his companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodbye, sir; I will never forget how good you have always been to
    me on the <i>Bounty</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian took their hands in his and wrung them. &ldquo;Goodbye, my lads.
    God bless you both, and forgive me all the harm I may have done you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he turned away, and with Smith closely following him, was soon lost
    to sight.</p>
  <p>Soon after dawn the village was astir with the preparations for Christian&rsquo;s
    marriage.</p>
  <p>Troops of natives carrying presents of food and other articles kept constantly
    arriving from all parts of the coast, and the first to welcome them and instruct
    them where to place their gifts was old Manuhuru, Mahina&rsquo;s mother.
    She was quick to recognise, as soon as Christian returned the possessor of
    so many riches, the advisability of withdrawing all further opposition to
    her daughter&rsquo;s marriage with the young Englishman; for with all her
    hatred of the white men she was very avaricious.</p>
  <p>Only that morning she had bidden Pipiri give up all hope of her child now
    that Christian had returned; and the young warrior-priest, with savage hatred
    in his heart, had cursed her and sworn yet to possess her daughter if fifty
    white men stood in his way.</p>
  <p>As Mahina was connected through her parents with the reigning family of
    Tahiti, the marriage ceremony was to be performed in the <i>marae</i> or
    temple of Oro instead of in the family <i>marae</i>, and thither went all
    the people to witness the event.</p>
  <p>Mahina, sitting on a mat, was surrounded by a number of young girls who
    had arrayed her in her wedding garments; at a sign from the officiating priest
    of Oro she rose and advanced to meet her white lover, who, attended by Alexander
    Smith and a number of young natives of strikingly handsome appearance, was
    now walking across the grassy sward towards her, his plain uniform contrasting
    strangely with the wild, yet picturesque, garb of his island friends, most
    of whom had their hair profusely decorated with wreaths of white and scarlet
    blossoms. Round each man&rsquo;s waist was a girdle composed of scarlet leaves
    of the <i>ti</i> plant, and bright yellow strips of the plantain leaf. Upon
    each wrist and ankle were circlets of pieces of pearl shell fitted into an
    embroidered net work of red and black cinnet; the islanders&rsquo; light
    brown skins shone with the scented oil with which they had anointed themselves,
    and the beautiful curved lines or deep blue tattooing with which their bodies
    were so freely covered stood out with such startling distinctness that even
    Smith, the most tattooed man of all the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> crew, could
    not help uttering a cry or admiration.</p>
  <p>When about fifty feet distant from each other, the two parties stopped,
    and a pretty little maiden, carrying in her hand a ripe plantain and a young
    drinking coconut, advanced out from among the women surrounding Mahina, and
    addressed the young native chief who led Christian&rsquo;s party&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are ye that come here so gaily clad, and why do ye come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, Kirisiani, come to the altar of Oro so that I may take for my
    wife Mahina, daughter of Manuhuru,&rdquo; replied the mutineer, taking the
    plantain and coconut from her and giving her a piece of stained native cloth
    in return.</p>
  <p>The child returned to her party, who began to chant some verses in praise
    of the beauty of Mahina; then the ranks opened out, and Christian, prompted
    by a chief, stepped to her side.</p>
  <p>Together they slowly walked to the <i>marae</i>, where they seated themselves
    upon mats, Christian at one end of the temple, Mahina at the other, while
    the people disposed themselves round the sacred edifice in silence.</p>
  <p>The leafy screen in front of one of the sacred dormitories opened; Harere,
    the priest, clothed in the vestments of his sacred office, stepped forward,
    and, spreading a small square of white tappa cloth in the centre of the temple,
    bade Mahina and the white man seat themselves upon it. Then, standing directly
    in front of Christian, he said, in a loud voice, &ldquo;<i>Kirisiani, taata
    Peretane, eita anei oe e faa &rsquo;rue i ta oe vahine?</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Christian,
    the Englishman, wilt thou not cast away this woman?&rdquo;) to which the
    mutineer replied &ldquo;<i>Eita</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;No&rdquo;). The same question
    was put to Mahina, and the girl, with a happy smile lighting up her lovely
    face, and her little hand pressing her lover&rsquo;s, quickly gave the same
    answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fortunate then may your lives be if thus ye remain true one to another,&rdquo; said
    Harere. Then stepping back from them and facing the sacred altar of Oro,
    the priest prayed to the god that the Englishman and his wife might live
    together in affection, that male children might be given to them in the earlier
    years of their married life, that they might not &ldquo;hunger nor thirst,
    nor see blood shed within their house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then old Manuhuru stepped into the sacred enclosure, bearing in her hands
    a heavy piece of <i>ahu vavau</i>, or tappa cloth, which she spread out upon
    the stone floor of the temple; and Harere the priest bade the lovers sit
    upon it and hold each other by the hand while he again addressed them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hearken, Englishman. It is the custom of this land for the man and
    the woman who marry before Oro and sit as thou and this woman sit now, to
    place before them the skulls of their ancestors, whose spirits, entering
    into the dead bones, will hear the vows that ye have made one to the other.
    But thou, Kirisiani, art from a far-off country, and it is not the custom
    of thy people to carry about with them on the sea the skulls of their forefathers.
    And the mother of thy wife, though now as we are, Tahitian, is, like thee,
    of strange blood&mdash;her mother&rsquo;s people came from a distant land
    which sprang from out the sea, and neither hath she a skull to place before
    thee. And for this does Manuhuru now make a sacrifice before Oro.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He handed to Mahina&rsquo;s mother a large shark&rsquo;s tooth with the
    base embedded in a piece of polished wood. Advancing to Christian, the old
    woman seized his right arm and made a small cut with the sharp point of the
    tooth upon the palm of his hand, then did the same upon the hand of her daughter.
    As the blood flowed and dripped down she caught it upon a piece of cloth
    with her left hand, and with her right she thrust the keen-edged tooth into
    her own breast, brow, and left shoulder, over and over again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See, white man,&rdquo; she croaked. &ldquo;Once I hated thee and
    all white men, but now thy blood and mine and my daughter&rsquo;s have mixed.
    And if thy blood is as good as mine&mdash;for I am of Afit&#257;&mdash;then
    does this mingling of it with mine render thee equal to Mahina; and, moreover,
    the mixing of blood shall bind thee closer to thy wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Scarcely able to conceal his disgust at the frightful spectacle the old
    woman presented, with her face and shoulders streaming with blood, Christian
    was glad to submit to the concluding part of the ceremony, which was the
    brief suspension over the heads of the married pair of a large piece of cloth
    called <i>te tapoi</i>.</p>
  <p>Leaving the temple Christian and his bride were escorted to a new house
    specially prepared for them in which to receive their presents, and the young
    man could not but be touched at the people&rsquo;s expression of their kindly
    feeling towards him, and the overwhelming display of their generosity.</p>
  <p>The rest of the day was spent in the wildest enjoyment and sumptuous feasting;
    then when darkness descended upon the scene the women and girls sang and
    danced, and a band of Areois delighted the people by their wild pantomimic
    exhibitions far into the night.</p>
  <p>But in the midst of the merry clamour Mahina, without bidding her aged mother
    farewell, stole quietly away to the ship to await her husband, who had gone
    to take leave of Tin&#257;. As she paddled off alone in a tiny canoe, the
    tall, stalwart figure of Pipiri the Areoi appeared on the beach. For a few
    seconds he watched her as she disappeared in the darkness. Then he plunged
    into the water and swam noiselessly in the same direction.</p>
  <p>Long before daylight next morning Mahina awoke and found that her husband
    was gone from her side. A wild look of fear for a moment blanched her olive
    cheek; then a smile parted her lips as she heard his voice on deck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Man the capstan, lads.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She ran on deck and found the ship crowded with natives, among whom were
    Tin&#257; and his noble wife, who wept when Christian bade them farewell.
    To King George the chief sent many messages, for he firmly believed that
    the <i>Bounty</i> was on her way to England.</p>
  <p>Amid the sounds of weeping and the sighing of tender farewells the anchor
    came in sight, the ship&rsquo;s head swung round, and the <i>Bounty</i> was
    again under way.</p>
  <p>Once outside the white line of foaming surge which thundered on the reef,
    Edward Young, who had been securing the anchor, came quietly aft and stood
    beside his wife Alrema, who, with Mahina and other women, was on the poop.
    Presently, as Christian passed, Young caught him by the arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like to disturb you last night, and so acted on my
    own responsibility. Stewart and Heywood came on board and announced their
    determination to sail with us if you would permit them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fletcher Christian&rsquo;s face darkened. &ldquo;Stewart and Heywood! What
    does this mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Treachery,&rdquo; answered Young, &ldquo;and I determined to meet
    treachery with deceit. I told them that I was certain you would never consent
    to their coming on board again, but that if they liked to stow themselves
    away till we got out to sea I would not say anything about it, but let them
    discuss the matter with you afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you mad, Young, to do this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sallow-faced midshipman laughed. &ldquo;Not a bit of it. They might
    do us more harm by remaining at Tahiti than they would by coming with us.
    Stewart has Nuia with him, and although she is as true as steel to the chicken-hearted
    dog, she has let it out to Alrema that he persuaded Heywood to come on board
    with him last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you think is his intention?&rdquo; asked Christian moodily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To recapture the ship, and try to sail her to England and get a commission&mdash;while
    we dangle from a yard-arm at Portsmouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why let them come on board?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To prevent their giving us trouble in the future. There are lots
    of islands where no ships are ever likely to touch, and we can put them ashore
    before we reach Tubuai&mdash;and be damned to them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To let them perhaps die, with their fate unknown! But there, Young,
    forgive me. You have done wisely. Let them come on deck, and I will watch
    them closely till a fitting time arrives for us to rid ourselves of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On board the <i>Bounty</i> were several native women, the wives of Smith,
    Quintal, and McCoy, and two Tahitian men, brothers of Smith&rsquo;s and Quintal&rsquo;s
    wives, who had determined to accompany the white men. These Christian was
    glad to see, as he thought they would prove useful as interpreters.</p>
  <p>But an hour later, after his talk with Young, and when the land was twenty
    miles astern, it was found that many more natives had hidden themselves on
    board, and that altogether the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> complement had been
    increased by twelve women, eight boys, and nine men.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b> <a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    The End of Pipiri</b></h2>
  <p>Seven days later the ship was once more at Tubuai, but the passage had been
    so rough that most of the live stock were washed overboard, and the natives
    had to help work the ship. To add to the troubles of the voyage, Mahina and
    the other women suffered so much from sickness that they were in the last
    stage of exhaustion when Tubuai was sighted. And Christian, who, from the
    hour he had plunged into the mutiny had repented it, grew morose and miserable
    with the bitterness of unavailing regret and the anxieties of his position
    as leader.</p>
  <p>Well it was for him that at this time and in the black days to come, the
    example of Smith and Young kept alive in the rest of the crew a respect for
    him; for these two men, by their undeviating loyalty to their leader and
    their influence for good with their fellow-mutineers, preserved the spirit
    of obedience to their chief, and thus averted the worst danger that could
    threaten such a company.</p>
  <p>As the ship entered the passage, the Tubuaians, instead of attacking the
    ship as it was feared they would, came off in their canoes in great numbers,
    and seeing the Tahitians on board, quickly made friends with them. They clambered
    up the sides of the <i>Bounty</i>, seized the ropes, and helped the sailors
    to warp the vessel through the reef to a safe anchorage. In a very short
    time barter was begun; Christian, accompanied by Mahina, went ashore, and
    with her aid as interpreter he soon negotiated with the chief of the island
    for a strip of land on which to erect a fort.</p>
  <p>But the Tubuaians were less friendly when they found that the white men
    intended to live among them, and they sought to withdraw from the treaty
    they had just made.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We like not the white strangers,&rdquo; said one of them to Mahina. &ldquo;How
    comes it that if, as thou sayest, the white chief is thy husband he remained
    not with thee in the Big Land? Why comes he here to seek a home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Foolish man,&rdquo; answered the wily Mahina haughtily. &ldquo;Little
    dost thou know of the customs of these clever white men. They are as wise
    as the gods, and like not the ways of the people of Tahiti. And the men of
    Peretane are more like those of Tubuai&mdash;they eat and drink and live
    alike&mdash;and for this reason do they desire to remain on Tubuai.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This compliment, and the gift of a quantity of iron, induced the Tubuaians
    to offer no further opposition. The ground was to the eastward of the entrance
    at a place called Avamoa; and here, in spite of shoal water and the numberless
    coral boulders which studded the lagoon, it was determined to bring the <i>Bounty</i>.</p>
  <p>The ship was lightened as much as possible&mdash;no easy task, for there
    was but one boat&mdash;and after much labour she was brought close up to
    the site of the proposed fort and moored in six fathoms of water. For two
    days the work of lightening the ship proceeded steadily, and Christian took
    part with the others in the task. The Tubuaians lent some assistance; but
    their habits of pilfering at last brought such an explosion of wrath from
    the leader of the mutineers that they desisted, and matters again went on
    smoothly for a time.</p>
  <p>It was the custom of Mahina, Alrema, Nuia, and the other Tahitian women
    to sit about the poop and watch the labours of their white husbands, and
    listen to the loud, excited cries of the half-naked, fierce-looking Tubuaians
    as they swarmed about the main deck, examining with intense curiosity the
    strange fittings of the ship, and arguing vociferously among themselves as
    to their use.</p>
  <p>Late one afternoon, just after the last boat load had left for the site
    of the fort, and the wild islanders had gone ashore in their canoes, Mahina
    was standing alone at the stern. Gazing down into the transparent depths
    of the lagoon and watching the many-hued fish that swam in and out among
    the branches of the coral forest which covered the bottom, she was startled
    by a touch upon the shoulder, and turning, she met the face of Pipiri the
    Areoi, looking at her with intense hatred gleaming from his eyes. So changed
    was he by his sickness on the voyage that she could not recognise him, and,
    in addition to this (perhaps for the purpose of disguise), he had shaved
    his head completely, and his once carefully trimmed beard had disappeared.</p>
  <p>She uttered a cry of alarm, and in an instant Christian was beside her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>With terror in her face she pointed to Pipiri and murmured: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
    Pipiri the Areoi; he hath frightened me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian looked at the Tahitian and gradually recognised his features,
    and remembered that the people at Pare and Matavai had told him that if he
    had not returned the Areoi would have married Mahina.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you come here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was hidden in the bowels of the ship,&rdquo; answered the man,
    defiantly. He staggered as he spoke, and Christian correctly surmised that
    some of the seamen had given him rum to drink.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why? What good can come of this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I might be with Mahina&mdash;she of whom thou hast robbed me,&rdquo; he
    replied savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor fool,&rdquo; muttered the mutineer in English, adding in Tahitian,  &ldquo;Truly
    I pity thee, but yet thou art a fool to have hidden thyself in the ship;
    for now will I make thee work and thou shalt be a bond slave to thy countrymen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; answered the Areoi proudly. &ldquo;Have not others
    of my countrymen come with thee; why, then, should I not live in Tubuai as
    an Areoi and an Aito?&rdquo; (a warrior).</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will answer thee, Pipiri the slaughterer, thou cruel and bloody-handed
    man&rdquo;&mdash;and Mahina faced him. &ldquo;Thou hast come for no
    good purpose; and truly we should be foolish to trust thee, save as a slave
    may be trusted. Do I not know that thou hast sworn to be revenged because
    I would have none of thee?&rdquo; Turning to her husband she coutinued, &ldquo;Send
    this man away. Let him go live among the Tubuaians, and suffer him not to
    come near the ship nor our people. I know his bad and cruel heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Tahitian laughed hoarsely. &ldquo;Truly, Mahina, thou art a clever woman.
    I indeed will go and live with the people of Tubuai; but I swear by my gods
    to return and take my revenge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next instant he sprang over the side, and Christian, in an endeavour
    to soothe his wife&rsquo;s fears and at her earnest entreaty, gave the order
    that he was not to be allowed to approach the whites in future.</p>
  <p>Parties were now formed to fell timber, the fort was planned, and men under
    the direction of Edward Young began to dig a moat round the site. The <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> armament
    of four four-pounders and ten swivels was got on shore; the Tahitians who
    had accompanied the ship took an active part in the work, principally because
    of the probability of their seeing the guns used in action against the Tubuaians
    and witnessing the destruction the weapons would accomplish.</p>
  <p>All this labour took some weeks to perform, and during that time it daily
    became more evident that the people of Tubuai disliked their visitors; indeed,
    during the last days of unloading the ship and digging the moat two or three
    skirmishes took place between them and the white men and their Tahitian allies.</p>
  <p>Early in September, however, so far had the work of constructing the fort
    progressed, that most of the people left the ship and took up their quarters
    therein. The four-pounders and swivels were mounted in such a position as
    to make Christian perfectly sure that, should the Tubuaians attack the stronghold,
    they would suffer a disastrous defeat. But while aware that such an attack
    might be made, he was yet hopeful that ere long they would recognise his
    desire to live among them in peace. Mahina, day after day, went into the
    principal town, and strove to impress the head chief, Maouri, that the white
    men&rsquo;s advent would prove of advantage to his people. Still, though
    they received the beautiful Tahitian with the greatest courtesy and respect,
    they were cold and suspicious in their manner. One day, when accompanied
    by Alrema, she visited the village, they found the whole population assembled
    in the square, listening to an address by an orator. The moment the two women
    came in view the orator disappeared, not so quickly but that in him they
    had recognised Pipiri the Areoi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us go back,&rdquo; Mahina said to Young&rsquo;s wife; &ldquo;mischief
    is meant to us in the fort; else why should these people gather together
    to listen to Pipiri, who is the enemy of us all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fearing that an attack was intended, Christian, as soon as Mahina told him
    what she had seen, doubled his sentries and kept a careful watch. For two
    nights they were undisturbed, but on the third, just after darkness had settled
    on the island, Talalu, a Tahitian sentry on the western face of the fort,
    called them to arms.</p>
  <p>Scarcely had they time to snatch up their weapons and fire a volley, when
    a large party of the islanders surrounded the fort on three sides and began
    a determined assault. With wild cries of defiance and in face of a continuous
    fire of musketry and grape from the swivels, they jumped into the moat and
    scrambled up on the other side. Scores of them were shot down as they appeared
    over the bank, for many carried torches made of the spathe of the coconut
    tree, with which they intended to fire the buildings within by throwing them
    over the palisade of coconut logs that enclosed it. The light from these
    torches, slight as it was, showed the assailants so clearly to Christian&rsquo;s
    garrison, that ere they could form for their second rush McCoy, Quintal and
    Smith each fired a swivel loaded with grape into the surging mass. Dreadful
    cries of agony followed, and so terrified were the Tubuaians at the awful
    effects of the fire that they wavered and were about to retreat. Instantly
    half a dozen chiefs, waving their spears, sprang to the front; then the attacking
    party, beating their battle-drums loudly, again advanced to the assault.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, as the dark, waving line of Tubuains swept over the undulating
    ground which lay between them and the western face of the fort, a blaze of
    light lit up the surrounding forest, and Mahina and the other women appeared
    beside the white men, carrying torches which revealed not only the naked
    forms of the savages now trying to scale the palisade, but also the dead
    and wounded who had fallen from the white men&rsquo;s first fire, and who
    lay on the edge of and in the bottom of the moat. So irresistible, however,
    was the rush of the assailants, that fifteen or sixteen of them succeeded
    in clambering over the stockade and jumping down into the fort. Armed with
    a short stabbing spear in the left and a heavy ebony-wood club in the right
    hand, these daring fellows made a rush at Christian, McCoy, and Smith, who
    were firing through the palisade at the swarm of yelling savages outside.
    Loud warning cries from Mahina and Alrema made Christian turn suddenly, but
    too late to avoid a vicious thrust from a spear, which passed through his
    left arm. Then came the report of a pistol close to him&mdash;the rush of
    foemen bore him back to the palisade bruised, stunned, and bleeding, and
    there he fell exhausted.</p>
  <p>Flinging the blazing torches into the centre of the fort, the women with
    knives and cutlasses in their hands, sprang down from where they stood to
    help their white husbands; and while some continued to fire at point-blank
    range into the thick mass of natives outside, the rest of the white men and
    Tahitians made short work of those within. Soon not one was left alive; the
    women, at the command of Mahina, seized all their dead bodies, save one,
    dragged them to the top of the palisade and with cries of contempt hurled
    them over among the assailants.</p>
  <p>For nearly ten minutes more the Tubuaians sought to force an entrance through
    the stout logs, heedless of the fire from the seamen&rsquo;s muskets, which
    were thrust through the spaces and discharged with deadly effect. Seizing
    the musket barrels the valorous savages by sheer strength tore them from
    the hands of those who held them, then with cries of defiance thrust their
    spears through the same apertures. By this time three of the white men had
    received severe wounds, and Young was just about to remove one of the four-pounders
    from where it was mounted to that part of the palisading where the assault
    was heaviest, when the Tubuaians broke and fled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said Young, wiping his powder-blackened face and addressing
    Christian, whose arm was being bound up by Mahina and Talalu, &ldquo;that
    was warm while it lasted. Not badly hurt, I trust, Christian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the leader, &ldquo;only a thrust from a spear
    through the arm; the rascal meant it for my heart, though,&rdquo; and then
    he closed his eyes from weakness. Round him stood the seamen, stripped to
    their waists, with cutlasses and muskets gleaming in the dying light of the
    torches which still lay burning on the ground. With one hand leaning on her
    husband&rsquo;s shoulder, in the other a cutlass bloody from hilt to point,
    was Alrema. Like the men around her she was bare to the waist, and her shapely
    arms and bosom were as ensanguined as the weapon she carried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Etuati,&rdquo; she panted with a smile when the light shone
    on her all but nude figure, and startled Young, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not my
    blood that thou seest; not once did a spear touch me. Ah, these dogs of Tubuai!
    Ah, my husband, thou didst not know that in our country we women go to war
    side by side with our husbands and our lovers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stern and callous as he was by nature, the young man shuddered visibly as
    he looked at the shocking appearance of his young wife; stretching out his
    hand he unclasped hers from the cutlass, and gently led her towards the hut
    in which she slept.</p>
  <p>Christian rose to his feet and was about to follow them when Mahina stayed
    him. &ldquo;Dost thou know whose was the hand that sent the spear?&rdquo; she
    asked. &ldquo;Come with me and I will show thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the middle of the stockade lay a naked savage. By the light of the torch
    held by Mahina, Christian saw the tatooing on the dead man&rsquo;s back and
    legs, and knew that he was a Tahitian.</p>
  <p>Stooping down, Mahina turned the body over, and pointed to the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pipiri!&rdquo; exclaimed Christian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, Pipiri the Areoi; he who swore to have thy life and mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor devil,&rdquo; said Christian in English, and then to Mahina, &ldquo;he
    hath a bullet hole through his chest. Who killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; she answered, holding out Young&rsquo;s pistol&mdash;the
    pistol with which he had once sworn to kill Captain Bligh.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
    Farewell to Tubuai</b></h2>
  <p>For a few days after the battle the white men remained undisturbed in the
    fort; but instead of the elation that might have been expected from such
    a decisive victory, there now fell upon the mutineers a strange, brooding
    feeling of discontent.</p>
  <p>Stewart and Heywood, ever bent upon retaking the ship and returning with
    her to England, had again succeeded in alienating some of the men from Christian,
    whose disregard of their wishes to remain at Tahiti had aroused their resentment.</p>
  <p>Working upon this, Stewart, little by little, brought some of these men
    to believe that if they aided him in recovering the ship, they would not
    only be given a free pardon for any actual part taken in the mutiny, but
    would be rewarded for their loyalty to Heywood and himself. Tired of the
    hardships and discomforts of settlement on an island where the natives were
    so hostile, and already regretting their severance from civilisation, they
    were not long in promising to aid the two midshipmen in any scheme devised
    to recapture the <i>Bounty</i> and sail her to England; or, failing that,
    to return to Tahiti and give themselves up to the King&rsquo;s ship that
    they knew would be sent in search of them.</p>
  <p>Morrison, the boatswain&rsquo;s mate, in particular, professed his readiness
    at any time that Stewart and Heywood might appoint to join them in either
    seizing the ship and making Christian and Young prisoners, or escaping from
    Tubuai and returning to Tahiti, and Alexander Smith, ever on the alert in
    his devotion to Christian, soon discovered that a second plot had been devised
    by Stewart, Heywood, and Morrison to steal the boat, provision her, and escape
    in the night. It became evident to Christian that his authority would be
    gone if he did not either make some concessions, or crush the malcontents
    at once and for ever. After discussing the matter seriously with Smith and
    Young, he called the people together and addressed them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You all seem so discontented with this place,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
    there are, I find, so many of you who will not hesitate to turn traitors
    to the rest of us, that I have determined, if you are agreed, to return to
    Tahiti. There, those who wish to separate from me can go, and those who wish
    to remain with me can do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This proposal was at once agreed to. It was also resolved to divide into
    two parts the ship&rsquo;s stores and fairly share them between the two parties;
    then those who chose to do so could go ashore at Tahiti, and those who desired
    to stand by Christian could accompany him in the ship to some island afterwards
    to be decided upon by himself and his adherents.</p>
  <p>And so once more the worn-out old <i>Bounty</i> was floated out to deep
    water, and all hands set to work to take on board her stores and armament
    again. That part of their labour accomplished, Christian sent parties out
    to collect the remainder of the live stock, which had not been seen since
    the attack on the fort.</p>
  <p>But again the islanders attacked them in such force, and with such undaunted
    courage and fierce resolution, that the landing-party had to retreat
    to the ship; and, indeed, they narrowly escaped being cut off before the
    boat could rescue them.</p>
  <p>Christian, who was engaged with Mahina, Alrema, and some Tahitians in bending
    on the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> after canvas, at once opened fire from the ship
    to cover the retreat of his men; as soon as the boat came alongside he ordered
    those in her on deck for a glass of grog, and leaving the women to guard
    the ship, led a strong party on shore to make a second attempt.</p>
  <p>For nearly a mile they marched through the rich tropical forest without
    molestation; then there suddenly broke forth the deafening rattle of the
    native battle&mdash;drums, and some five hundred Tubuaians&mdash; among them
    many women&mdash;sprang out from their ambush and made a furious attack with
    clubs, spears, and slings. Fortunately the ground favoured the white men,
    six of whom were armed with muskets loaded with slugs, and these inflicted
    terrible slaughter at the first volley. Twice did the Tubuains make determined
    efforts to break through and separate the white men, but throwing down their
    muskets and keeping the Tahitians in the centre, the seamen drew their cutlasses
    and hewed and slashed at the naked bodies of the savages till the leafy ground
    was soaked and soddened into a bloody mire. But for the slaughter inflicted
    by the muskets of the Tahitians, however, the enemy would have borne them
    down by sheer force of numbers. Christian, whose great strength and skill
    in all muscular exercises had made him famous in Tahiti, fought with such
    courage and fury that he soon had a pile of dead and dying Tubuaians forming
    a breastwork around him; and, leaning his weapon over their bodies, Talalu,
    the big Tahitian, fired into the enemy at such close range that the natives
    at last wavered, broke, and fled.</p>
  <p>So exhausted, however, were Christian and his party, many of whom were badly
    wounded by spear-thrusts, that all further attempt to recover the stock was
    abandoned, and after two or three hours&rsquo; rest they returned to the
    ship. At the landing-place they were met by a friendly chief, named Tairoa-Maina,
    and two of his friends, who, always having been well-disposed to Christian,
    took no part in the assault. They had just arrived from the principal village,
    where the bodies of those who fell in the attack were brought, and with grim
    satisfaction the mutineers learnt that fifty-six men and seven women had
    been killed and twice as many badly wounded, principally by cutlasses and
    musket slugs.</p>
  <p>Fearing to remain on the island after the ship sailed, Tairoa-Maina besought
    Christian as his pledged taio, or friend, to take him and his two companions
    away with him. To this the mutineer consented.</p>
  <p>On the following day, all being in readiness, the ship well stocked with
    provisions, and the wind being from the S.E. the <i>Bounty</i> once more
    got under weigh. Three days later she was off the island of Maitea, a high,
    verdure-clad spot about seven miles in extent, lying thirty miles due east
    from the southern point of Tahiti.</p>
  <p>Running in close under the lee side, Christian hove-to the ship, called
    all hands aft, and divided everything on board into two lots in readiness
    for the time of separation. Then, before the lusty trade wind, the <i>Bounty</i>,
    not waiting for the crowd of canoes that were paddling eagerly off towards
    her filled with natives shouting welcome, stood away due west. At dusk Tahiti
    was in sight, and on the following morning the ship once more lay at anchor
    in Matavai Bay.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
    The Last Sailing of the &ldquo;<i>Bounty</i>&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Once more were the white men welcomed with unaffected joy by the simple-hearted
    Tahitians, who yet wondered at their second return and made many inquiries
    as to its cause. Among those who thronged on board were the relatives of
    Pipiri the Areoi; these told enigmatically by Mahina that the priest would
    be long in returning, were at first angry and then suspicious; but when in
    answer to a direct question put to Christian, they learned that he had been
    killed in a fight against his countrymen and their white friends, they were
    seized with shame and retired with downcast faces. Later on in the day came
    Tin&#257;  and his beautiful wife, who welcomed Christian and his comrades
    with every demonstration of affection and esteem, though they too marvelled
    at the second return of the <i>Bounty</i>; this Christian did not attempt
    to explain, knowing that those Tahitians who accompanied the ship would not
    fail to tell their countrymen of all the events that had transpired since
    they sailed from Tahiti. But Tin&#257; expressed his delight at hearing from
    Christian that many of the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> crew had returned for the
    purpose of living among his people, and readily gave assistance to land the
    stores belonging to the shore party.</p>
  <p>For the third time the ship was now wooded and watered and prepared for
    sea. When everything was in readiness, Christian mustered the hands, and
    desired all those who wished to remain on shore to go to the larboard side
    of the ship, and all those who intended to remain by him to the starboard.
    The first to step over to the larboard were Stewart and Heywood, who were
    at once followed by thirteen seamen. His own party Christian found to consist
    of Edward Young, his next in command; Mills, the gunner&rsquo;s mate; Brown,
    the gardener; Martin, McCoy, Williams, Quintal, and, of course, the faithful
    Alexander Smith; besides these there stepped over to starboard Tarioa-Maina,
    the young Tubuaian chief, his two friends, and three Tahitian men with their
    wives, one of whom bore in her arms a female infant. Each of Christian&rsquo;s
    white followers had with him a native wife, and thus the whole of his party
    totalled twenty-eight persons.</p>
  <p>For a moment or two Christian looked from one to another of those ranged
    on the larboard side, then told them in an unmoved voice to get into the
    boat. In a few minutes they were gone, and the boat was being pulled shorewards.
    Turning to those of the ship&rsquo;s company who were still standing on the
    starboard side, he informed them of his intention to sail in a day or two,
    and said he would be pleased if they would not visit the shore again. This
    they unhesitatingly promised.</p>
  <p>That night&mdash;the 22nd of September&mdash;he went on shore in a canoe
    and, landing a short distance from the village, made his way to the house
    of the chief Tipa&rsquo;uu, the father of Nuia, Stewart&rsquo;s wife.</p>
  <p>Entering quietly he found the two youths in conversation with the old chief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to say goodbye again. Let us
    now speak together for the last time, and bury the past. I can never forget
    that until that morning in April we were always good friends. Shake hands
    then, my lads, for the last time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am very sorry all this has happened, sir,&rdquo; said young Heywood, &ldquo;and
    only just now Stewart admitted that you were sorely tempted,&rdquo; and he
    held out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God knows, Christian,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;I bear you no malice,
    for I cannot forget that after we gave you our promise not to interfere with
    your plans I induced Heywood to join me in breaking that promise. I can only
    plead as my excuse that I never intended to be false to that pledge; but
    seeing many of the men were ripe to join me in the attempt to retake the
    ship I felt justified in breaking it. I can only say again that although
    you have damned our prospects in life I freely forgive you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so, Stewart,&rdquo; said the mutineer, &ldquo;your reputation
    as a loyal officer shall not suffer, nor shall this boy&rsquo;s. You are
    both innocent of participating in my crime. Be guided by me. Bligh will probably
    reach England; whether he does so or not a ship will be sent out to search
    for us. When she arrives here, go off at once to her and give yourselves
    up to the commander. Tell him, as I tell you now, that this disaster was
    brought about entirely by me, and I alone am responsible for the act.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear that we shall have difficulty in clearing ourselves,&rdquo;  answered
    Stewart, moodily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not if you give yourselves up at once and tell the exact truth. No
    one, not even my followers, not even I myself, thought of mutiny until I
    came on deck in the morning watch, and then the temptation suddenly came
    upon me. You both know what a life that damned scoundrel&mdash;God forgive
    me if I speak of a dead man&mdash;led us all, and how he picked me out particularly
    for his insults and unaccountable malice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is true enough; the wonder is that you bore with him so long.
    But it is too late to talk of that now,&rdquo; said Stewart, with a ring
    of sympathy in his voice; &ldquo;when do you sail, and where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear lads,&rdquo; he answered mournfully, &ldquo;where I am going
    is a question I cannot answer, and if I could it would be better unanswered,
    for you will be asked what has become of me. I shall leave at daylight and
    probably search for some uninhabited island on which to spend the remainder
    of my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The natives say you do not intend sailing for a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Stewart. I gave that out on purpose; every one is on board and
    all is ready, and I hope to be clear of the bay to-morrow morning, before
    even a native is awake, and so by that means avoid the fuss of another leave-taking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was silent for a while, then turning to Heywood, earnestly besought him
    to see his relatives in England and tell them the truth. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo;  said
    he, &ldquo;when you reach England my people will have learned to hate and
    despise me as a mutineer. Tell them what you have seen of my sufferings and
    my provocation, and ask them to forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silence fell upon them again in the darkened house, and nought was heard
    save the heavy breathing of the mutineer. Suddenly he rose, grasped their
    hands without a word, and, turning away, walked slowly down to the white
    line of beach whereon his canoe lay.</p>
  <p>Old Tipa&rsquo;uu awaking from his sleep a few minutes later, kindled afresh
    the dying fire, and as the flame leapt up and illuminated the house he saw
    that the faces of Stewart and Heywood were wet with tears.</p>
  <p>An hour before daylight Fletcher Christian, who had been shut up for some
    hours alone in his cabin, came on deck and called the hands, and ere the
    mists of Orohena had begun to float away before the chilly breaths of the
    land breeze, the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> anchor was up to her bow, and, with
    all her canvas spread, she was slipping out of the bay.</p>
  <p>When daylight broke the natives gave a cry of astonishment, for the ship
    had disappeared.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>The story of those of the mutineers who remained at Tahiti can be told in
    a few words. Who has not heard of the horrors of the <i>Pandora&rsquo;s</i> &ldquo;box,&rdquo; the
    term applied to the round house built by the merciless Captain Edwards of
    the <i>Pandora</i> frigate on the deck of his ship as a prison for his wretched
    captives.</p>
  <p>The <i>Pandora</i>, sent out to search for the mutineers, arrived at Tahiti
    on March 23, 1791. The sailors surrendered themselves, two seamen, Thompson
    and Churchill excepted, for the last-named had been murdered sometime previously
    by Thompson, who in turn was killed by the Tahitians, not before he richly
    deserved death for his atrocious crimes.</p>
  <p>The white men had occupied their time on shore in building a schooner in
    which some had intended to leave the island, but they were unable to put
    to sea for want of sails.</p>
  <p>Stewart&rsquo;s wife, Nuia, who was the daughter of the chief with whom
    he lived, had borne a child, and her love for her white husband has formed
    the theme of many a Tahitian love song. When the <i>Pandora</i> sailed the
    heart-rending grief of this gentle girl affected even the rough seamen whose
    duty it was to force her away from Stewart&rsquo;s side. Six weeks after
    she died of a broken heart.</p>
  <p>Amid the tears and lamentations of the Tahitians, the frigate left with
    her prisoners on the 19th of May, the little schooner sailing with her. From
    the day the unhappy men surrendered until their arrival at the Cape of Good
    Hope, they were all treated with great brutality by Edwards&mdash;Heywood
    and Stewart, officers and mere youths as they were, receiving no more mercy
    at his hands than did the others.</p>
  <p>Three months were spent by the <i>Pandora</i> in a vain search for the <i>Bounty</i> and
    those on board, and then the frigate was headed for Timor; on August 28th,
    while making her way through Endeavour Strait, she crashed on a reef, and
    on the following day was abandoned a total wreck.</p>
  <p>The previous inhumanity of Captain Edwards towards his prisoners was, immediately
    after the ship struck, if possible, increased. For a long time he made no
    attempt to save them with the rest of the ship&rsquo;s company. From the
    box in which they were confined the only means of egress was by a scuttle
    on the top.</p>
  <p>Some of them, as the <i>Pandora</i> rolled and dashed them, heavily ironed
    as they were, from one side to the other of their dreadful prison, bruised
    and bleeding, cried out that they would be drowned like rats in a hole, for
    already the vessel was breaking up fast, but their vindictive gaoler ordered
    them to be quiet or they would be fired upon. Only at the last moment did
    he give the order to take their irons off; and then, if it had not been for
    the humanity of one of the <i>Pandora&rsquo;s</i> boatswain&rsquo;s mates,
    they would all have been drowned. He, brave fellow, hearing their cries,
    declared he would either free them or drown with them; he dropped the keys
    of their irons through the scuttle, and with the greatest difficulty (for
    the water was up to his waist) forced off the iron bar which kept the scuttle
    closed.</p>
  <p>When the survivors reached a small sand quay and Edwards mustered them it
    was found that thirty-one of the frigate&rsquo;s crew and Stewart and three
    of the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> seamen were drowned.</p>
  <p>Then began a long voyage to Coupang on the island of Timor, there being
    ninety-nine persons in all, divided between three boats. The story
    of their dreadful sufferings need not here be told; but after a voyage of
    nineteen days, on September 19th, two of the boats reached Coupang, the third
    arriving three days later. From Coupang they were conveyed in a Dutch ship
    to Java, where they found the <i>Resolution</i>&mdash;the schooner built
    by the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> people at Tahiti&mdash;which had early parted
    company with the <i>Pandora</i> and had arrived six weeks before, her crew
    having endured similar privations. From Batavia they were taken to the Cape
    of Good Hope, their numbers having been increased at a former place by the
    addition of more prisoners&mdash;the survivors of the Bryant party, eleven
    convicts who had escaped from Sydney.</p>
  <p>Embarking in the Gorgon, man-of-war, at the Cape, Edwards and his unfortunate
    prisoners at last reached England safely, and the mutineers were tried by
    court-martial. Bligh was not present, having sailed on a second voyage
    to Tahiti for another cargo of of breadfruit plants.</p>
  <p>The trial ended in the acquittal of three seamen and the conviction of six
    others, among them Heywood. The general tenor of the evidence went to prove
    Morrison and Heywood innocent. But Bligh had left behind him statements inculpating
    these men. The Admiralty, after the court-martial was over, considered the
    evidence and ultimately unconditionally pardoned Heywood, Morrison, and a
    seaman named Muspratt, and executed the others.</p>
  <p>Heywood and Morrison were permitted to re-enter the service, and both of
    then had honourable careers, the first after attaining the rank of captain
    died full of years and honours in 1831, and Morrison became gunner of the <i>Blenheim</i>,
    in which ship, in 1807, he was lost with all hands.</p>

    The Search for a Resting-Place</b></h2>
  <p>The <i>Bounty</i> lay becalmed within a few miles of a long, low-lying atoll
    densely covered with coconut trees. The wind had fallen light during the
    night, but though the land was then forty miles distant, the strong current
    set the ship steadily to the eastward, and now at ten o&rsquo;clock in the
    morning those on her decks could see between the palm trees the pale green
    waters of a placid lagoon shimmering in the bright sunlight. Fifty miles
    north and south it stretched, and Talalu, who with others of his countrymen
    was gazing at the strange island from the fore-yard, his dark eyes full of
    expectancy, called out to Mahina and Alrema, who were on the poop deck, that
    he could see a great village and many people running to and fro on the beach
    getting ready their canoes to come out to the ship.</p>
  <p>Sitting aft upon the skylight, with two charts spread out before him, was
    the leader of the mutineers. Although but two weeks had passed since the
    ship left Tahiti, the anxieties of his position had already told upon Christian,
    and his face was drawn and haggard. Mahina stood behind him, with her shapely
    hand resting upon his shoulder, and looked with interest at the pencilled
    line of the ship&rsquo;s course marked upon one of the charts by her husband.
    Opposite were Young, McCoy and his wife, and two or three others of the mutineers,
    while their wives sat on the deck and listened eagerly to what their husbands
    were saying.</p>
  <p>Turning to his comrades, Christian pointed to the larger of the two charts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This island which we are now closing is called Fakarava, and there
    is a good entrance into the lagoon. If you think it advisable for us to take
    the ship in, it can easily be done. But I cannot see that any good will come
    from our wasting the time. As you know, this is the seventh island we have
    sighted since we left Tahiti, and every one has proved unsuitable for our
    purpose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with this one?&rdquo; said Williams, who
    had just come down from aloft. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s big enough for us all, isn&rsquo;t
    it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; answered Christian coldly, &ldquo;but, as I have pointed
    out to you before, while the natives of all these islands were friendly enough,
    the islands themselves were most unsuitable. They were mere sand banks covered
    with coconuts, and although some of them were of great extent, the narrow
    strips of land enclosing the lagoons were barely half a mile broad. Supposing
    that we had stayed on one of them, stripped and sank the ship, and lived
    ashore, what possible chance would there have been of concealing ourselves
    if a ship entered the lagoon, or what chance of defending our refuge? None.
    None at all. Then, the productions of such places are poor; there is literally
    nothing growing on them but coconuts. But, as some of you thought that in
    this group we should easily find an island as fertile as Tubuai, I acceded
    to your wishes, and we have spent ten days among them seeking a suitable
    spot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that I was one to persuade you, sir,&rdquo; said
    Quintal. &ldquo;We ought to have stood to the south again, as you wanted
    to, and got among the high islands like Tubuai. As you say, it would be folly
    for us to leave the ship for any place that we can&rsquo;t live comfortably
    on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On this chart of Captain Bligh&rsquo;s,&rdquo; resumed the leader, &ldquo;you
    will see that all these islands which we are now sailing among are marked
    as &lsquo;low coral lagoons.&rsquo; That there are others which do not appear
    on the chart, and which are higher and more fertile, I have no doubt; but
    I believe from what Mahina and Talalu tell me, that these, which have not
    yet been discovered by any navigator, lie a long way to the south and east.
    That there is one such place I am certain. But before we listen to what my
    wife has to say on the matter, and before I give my own idea as to the best
    course, let me remind you that to-day expires the time we agreed to spend
    in cruising among the islands to the north and east of Tahiti.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Mr. Christian,&rdquo; said Smith, who with his wife had
    now joined the party around the skylight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Up to the present,&rdquo; resumed Christian, speaking slowly and
    coldly, &ldquo;you have proved loyal to me, even though dissenting from my
    plans. I, like yourselves, am but a felon dodging the gallows, and it is
    better that you should bear with me a little longer, till I succeed in finding
    a safe resting-place for us all. Then it will be every one for himself; I
    shall have no further claim on your obedience, and you none of any nature
    on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An anxious look crept into Smith&rsquo;s eyes, but he had no time to say
    anything.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; continued the leader, &ldquo;by leaving Tahiti with
    me you have cut yourself off from the last chance you might have had of saving
    your necks if captured by a King&rsquo;s ship; that being the case, we are
    all in the same plight, and your interests are also mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Christian, you have acted towards us like a man. I don&rsquo;t
    regret what has happened, and I am going to obey you as captain of this ship
    till the end; and I am very much mistaken if you won&rsquo;t find every man
    on board of her of my way of thinking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Smith who spoke, and when he had finished he looked at the others
    for approval. Every one of them answered heartily, &ldquo;Aye, aye, go ahead,
    Mr. Christian; we&rsquo;ll see it through under you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A faint smile of satisfaction for a moment lit up Christian&rsquo;s countenance,
    but the habitual melancholy, which had now settled upon him, returned the
    next instant, and he continued his remarks in cold, indifferent tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before we left Matavai Bay I had practically made up my mind that
    this island&rdquo;&mdash;and he placed his hand upon the smaller chart&mdash; &ldquo;was
    the most suitable place for us to reach. This book&rdquo;&mdash;taking it
    from Mahina, &ldquo;was written by Captain Carteret, and this chart was made
    by him when he discovered the island, thirty years ago. This is what he says,&rdquo; and
    opening the book, he read:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;On the morning of July 2, 1767, a young gentleman named Pitcairn,
    being on the look-out at the mast head, observed a spot on the horizon, which
    on approaching it next day appeared to rise like a great pyramid out of the
    sea. It proved to be an island, one and a half miles in length and four and
    a half in circumference, its summit attaining a height of 1,008 feet, itself
    surrounded by a coral reef and covered with trees. The coast was formed for
    the most part of rocky projections, off which lay numerous fragments of stone,
    while a small stream of fresh water trickled down at one end of the island.
    The surf, which broke upon the shore with great violence, rendered landing
    impossible, but there should be no great difficulty in fine weather in doing
    so. The place seems to be uninhabited, a great number of sea-birds hovered
    around, and the waters almost swarm with fish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place for us, lads,&rdquo; said Quintal, with an
    inquiring look at the others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will see,&rdquo; continued Christian, &ldquo;that in the big
    chart the island is not shown at all, but in this rough sketch of it, drawn
    by Captain Carteret, the position is given as lat. 20&deg; 2&rsquo; south;
    long. 133&deg; 21&rsquo; west.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s more than four hundred leagues from Tahiti,&rdquo; began
    Williams, when Christian checked him by a look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is more than that, as you say, and whether Captain Carteret&rsquo;s
    position is correct or not, I cannot tell; I think not; for it is known that
    the instruments he had on board the <i>Swallow</i> were very indifferent.
    But in another reference to the island he says that it was visible at fifteen
    leagues. I think, therefore, we could scarcely miss it, unless we ran by
    it in the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, sir,&rdquo; cried McCoy and Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, as far as I know, no one but Carteret has ever seen this place,
    and its isolated position will be a safeguard to us. Furthermore, although
    my wife and I have talked of the island often enough, I was careful in leaving
    Tahiti to give neither Heywood nor Stewart a hint of our future movements.
    Now listen to what my wife has told me, and then decide quickly whether you
    will agree to our standing to the south-east and looking for this Pitcairn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again the rest of the mutineers answered that they trusted him, and would
    follow his advice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then. My wife, as Talalu and your own wives will tell
    you, is not of Tahitian blood. Her ancestors were blown away to sea from
    an island far away from Tahiti, which they only reached after spending many
    months among these islands through which we have been cruising for the past
    ten days. Their home lay, according to them, many weeks&rsquo; fast sailing
    to the south-east of Tahiti. Mahina, though she knows but little of the origin
    of her people, yet knows that the place they came from was called Afit&#257;,
    and Carteret&rsquo;s description of Pitcairn, as far as I have been able
    to make her understand it, tallies in the main with the description she has
    heard her mother give of Afit&#257;. Remember that we have with us many Tahitians,
    and Tairoa-Maina and the other Tubuaians, and it would be well to take them
    into our confidence and tell them where we are going. We cannot afford to
    deceive them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He ceased speaking; then, as no one demurred to his suggestion, he asked
    Young to muster all the natives aft. As soon as they had grouped behind the
    white men, Christian said to his white comrades&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My wife is, I think, a favourite with all these men. Let her talk
    to them and tell them that we are about to look for the home of her forefathers,
    and they will be well content.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The seamen consented, and Christian explained to Mahina what was wanted
    of her. She, readily understanding, at once complied; and it was easy to
    see, by the flush of pleasure upon her cheeks and her bright smile, that
    the task was a pleasing one.</p>
  <p>Placing her hand on Carteret&rsquo;s chart, and giving a swift glance of
    intelligence and affection at Christian, she spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See, men of Tahiti and Tubuai, my husband desireth me to tell thee
    of the home of my people, so that ye may know why it is the ship stayeth
    so long out upon the sea. It is because that of all the lands we have seen
    since we sailed we have seen none so fair to look upon as Tahiti and Tubuai;
    and it is in my husband&rsquo;s heart to find a land that shall be both fair
    to look at and good to live upon. But naught have we yet seen but such places
    as this,&rdquo;  and she pointed to the low-lying island on the larboard
    side; &ldquo;and so, because I have told him of the rich land from whence
    my fathers came, it is in his mind that we go there and live. And I have
    heard Manuhuru, my mother, speak of this land, for there was her mother born
    and there she lived, until there came a time when, with many others, she
    was blown out to sea and returned no more, for their canoe was swept away
    by a strong south wind for many, many days till they reached strange islands.
    Some were killed by the people of these places, but my mother&rsquo;s mother,
    and four others with her, one day stole a sailing canoe from the people of
    the island called Marutea and set out again to seek their own home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the place she speaks of,&rdquo; said Christian, pointing
    to Marutea on the large chart, &ldquo;a good eight hundred miles to the north-west
    of Pitcairn Island.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whites and natives crowded round the chart and looked at the spot indicated
    by Christian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But again the winds and the gods were against them, and so they sailed
    towards the setting sun, and on the tenth day saw the shadow of Orohena stand
    out against the sea-rim, and at night they landed at Tiarapu and dwelt there
    in peace among the people, who were kind to them. But yet were their hearts
    always towards their own land, which, though it be but a small place, yet
    is green as Tahiti, and is a land good to live in; and sometimes when the
    sun sank below the sky-rim and they watched the top of Orohena become wrapped
    in the white mists of the valleys, they would look at one another and sigh
    and say: &lsquo;Ah, that is like our land of Afit&#257; rising from the sea.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>A cry broke from Tairoa-Maina, the Tubuaian chief: &ldquo;Afit&#257;! Truly,
    Kirisiani, thy wife and I are of one blood; for I, too, know of this land
    which riseth from the sea, and is far away, towards the edge of the world.
    My father came from Afit&#257;, and there are many others in Tubuai whose
    fathers came from there, long, long ago, in seven canoes. This did they because
    Afit&#257;, though so rich, was too small for so many to live upon. And because
    of the strange blood in my veins it was that the men of Tubuai liked me not,
    and I desired to come away with thee. Let us, oh Kirisiani, go seek the land
    of Afit&#257;, which is far towards the rising sun from Tubuai. For it is
    indeed, as thy wife sayeth, a land good to look upon, and rich in woods,
    and water and fish, and yams and bread-fruit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For some minutes there was an excited buzzing of voices among the natives,
    and the men eagerly besought Christian to lead them to the home of his wife&rsquo;s
    people; while Edward Young and the rest of the ship&rsquo;s company seemed
    equally interested and as anxious to learn more. Presently Talalu, who generally
    acted as spokesman for his countrymen, stepped out from the others and addressed
    the leader of the white men. This man, who was the tallest and strongest
    of all the Tahitians on board, had, like Smith, conceived a great admiration
    for Fletcher Christian, and had evinced it in many ways since the <i>Bounty</i> left
    Tahiti; and being a man of chiefly rank, his influence over the rest of the
    natives on board was great.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kirisiani,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;I, Talalu, the son of Poahanehane,
    will follow thee wherever thou goest, and work and fight for thee. And as
    I do, so will my countrymen with thee on the ship do. This we swear by our
    gods, and by the blood in our veins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then one by one the simple brown people crowded round Christian and
    touched his hands and feet in token of their fealty to him; and the dull,
    brooding shadow for a little time left his face as he shook hands with them
    all in the English fashion, his example being followed by Young and the rest
    of the white men.</p>
  <p>Then Tairoa-Maina pressed forward, and the handsome chief, his black eyes
    gleaming with excitement at the prospect of seeing his father&rsquo;s island
    home, knelt at Mahina&rsquo;s feet and touched the deck with his forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I too,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will go with thy husband, Mahina,
    and be a true man to him; for is he not a man of a good heart? And together
    shall we search for and find the land of Afit&#257;, thy land and mine. For
    now, Mahina, when I hear thy voice, do I hear the voice of my father that
    is dead; and it may be that thou and I are of one blood. And for that alone
    would my heart be for ever towards Kirisiani, thy husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian smiled again. Despite his own morbid nature, he had grown to like
    the handsome Tubuaian, and the chief&rsquo;s devotion to Mahina pleased him
    greatly. A little behind were the rest of Mahina&rsquo;s country-women, who,
    not comprehending the discussion, had now surrounded her with soft murmurs
    of excitement, and presently Christian, noting this, turned to his wife with
    a laugh&mdash;the first for many months.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is well, Mahina, that thy countrymen are so with thee and me;
    but what say all these women to this search for the land of Afit&#257;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She turned her lustrous eyes, beaming with affection, on the mutineer. &ldquo;It
    is not the part of a woman, unless she be a great ruler, to say aye or nay
    to her master&rsquo;s will; and surely thou didst not think to ask these
    women their thoughts on this matter. That would be folly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a good doctrine, Mahina,&rdquo; answered Christian; &ldquo;there
    will be no man-and-wife quarrels to break our peace on Afit&#257;.&rdquo; Then,
    pressing her hand, he turned away to attend to the ship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here comes a fleet of canoes,&rdquo; called out Quintal to Young,
    and almost at the same moment the glassy surface of the water stirred and
    rippled to the breeze as it came darkening along from the north-east to fill
    the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> sails.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind the canoes,&rdquo; answered Young, flinging down the mainbraces; &ldquo;get
    the head-sheets over; and here, away to the main deck, all you women!&mdash;out
    of the way and give us a pull on the braces!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So with many a bubbling laugh and merry jest the Tahitian women tripped
    down and seized the ropes in their soft little hands; and as the ship leaned
    gently over and the froth began to bubble under her bluff old bows, Christian
    put the helm hard up, wore her round, and set her head to the south-east.</p>
  <p>Mahina, standing beside him, gazed intently into her husband&rsquo;s eyes
    as he looked at the compass; then as he steadied the ship she watched him
    inquiringly; and he nodded and smiled at her in return.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, Mahina, that is where we must go to seek for Afit&#257;; may
    we find it soon.&rdquo; He gave over the wheel to Williams, walked quietly
    away, picked up the charts and books, and went below.</p>
  <p>But on the main-deck, as the long, palm-clad line of Fakarava, with its
    white gleam of sandy beach, sank slowly below the horizon, the white seamen
    and their native wives and the rest of the ship&rsquo;s company sang and
    laughed and chattered; and as the <i>Bounty</i> slipped over the long ocean
    rollers she spread on either side white sheets of snowy foam, and surged
    along before the lusty breath of the ever-freshening breeze.</p>
  <p>So began the search for the land of Afit&#257;. A district in Tahiti.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
    The Flight of the Kan&aacute;pu</b></h2>
  <p>On further careful study of Carteret&rsquo;s book and chart, the mind of
    Fletcher Christian was greatly disturbed, for he knew that there was much
    to fear if the position of Pitcairn had been wrongly laid down. The currents,
    too, in this part of the world were but little understood by those few navigators
    who had sailed among the islands; indeed, the natives themselves were far
    better informed of both the winds and currents of Eastern Polynesia than
    were the few European voyagers among the various groups since the days of
    Carteret and Cook.</p>
  <p>Carteret had laid down the centre of Pitcairn in lat. 20&deg; 2&rsquo;  south,
    and long. 133&deg; 21&rsquo; west; but although Christian was fairly confident
    of sighting the island by keeping a careful look-out and heaving-to at night
    when he got near it, he felt that his limited knowledge of the winds and
    currents might lead to prolonged and tedious search.</p>
  <p>For twenty-one days after leaving Fakarava the <i>Bounty</i> sailed south-
    easterly. Several low-lying atolls were sighted, but no sign of high land
    had been seen; yet, by Christian&rsquo;s calculations (only revealed to Young,
    Smith, and McCoy), he had twice sailed over the position assigned to the
    island by Carteret. His misgivings that a strong current had set him too
    far to the eastward were daily growing stronger. His only chronometer, through
    an accident, had been rendered useless, and besides this the weather latterly
    was gloomy and the sun seldom visible. The last land had been sighted eighteen
    days after leaving Fakarava, and Talalu and Tairoa-Maina, who from the break
    of day were continuously aloft on the lookout, assured him on that day that
    no land lay further to the south-east but Afit&#257; and a little sandy island
    called Oeno, about half a day&rsquo;s sail to the northward. Small as this
    island was, they declared that the clamour of the sea-birds, whose resting-place
    it was, would reveal its presence even on the darkest night; and this alone
    somewhat reassured him in the hope that he had not drifted past it or Pitcairn
    in the darkness. A day&rsquo;s sail further to the eastward was another island
    which they said was called Fenua-manu; this, too, was the home of millions
    of sea-birds, whose voices stifled the beating of the surf upon the reefs,
    so great were their numbers.</p>
  <p>With his chin upon his hands, Fletcher Christian gazed moodily at the chart
    before him. Mahina, who by the cabin door was watching him with tender interest,
    heard him sigh wearily. Stepping up to him, she pressed her cool hand to
    his forehead, and leant her cheek against his in loving sympathy.</p>
  <p>In the great cabin no sound broke the stillness save the swish and swirl
    of the ship&rsquo;s wake as she slipped through the water; and presently
    Christian, drawing the girl&rsquo;s slender figure to a seat beside him,
    pointed to the chart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you and three of my white comrades
    alone know that the ship hath twice sailed over the place where this island
    of Afit&#257;  should have been; and no sign have we yet seen, not even a
    drifting coconut or a piece of wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears; for a few moments her bosom heaved,
    and she tried to speak without showing her emotion; and Christian, moody
    and preoccupied as he was, knew by her voice that she felt for and sympathised
    with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kirisiani, I too have looked and looked and prayed to Oro and Tane
    to guide the ship to Afit&#257;, but now I begin to fear that the gods have
    turned aside from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He pressed her hand in silence, and was about to bid her come with him on
    deck when the murmuring of voices at the door of the great cabin broke in
    upon them, and presently Talalu, Tairoa-Maina, and two other natives asked
    leave to speak with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let them wait awhile,&rdquo; he said sullenly, although knowing that
    in the Tubuaian chief and his Tahitian comrade he had two firm friends, who
    with Smith, Young, and McCoy would stand by him to the last. For nearly half
    an hour he remained communing with himself and endeavouring to think out
    some other course for the future, should his search be still unrewarded on
    the following day.</p>
  <p>Already the long voyage had had a bad effect upon most of the mutineers,
    and only that morning he had noticed the gloomy faces and sullen manner of
    the men when changing the ship&rsquo;s course another point to the southward.
    Some of the Tahitians were suffering from the effects of the strange food
    which, for weeks, they had been forced to live upon, and the confinement
    told seriously on their health and spirits. Yet, despite this, their regard
    for Mahina, and their faith in, and respect for Christian were unbroken,
    and they would have endured the most prolonged hardships rather than let
    either imagine that they were repining. With some of the white seamen, however,
    these feelings were wanting. Although there was no open expression of discontent,
    more than one murmured at the delay, declaring that Christian and Young,
    either through ignorance or design, were not doing their duty to their associates.</p>
  <p>It was no wonder, therefore, that Christian himself grew day by day more
    anxious and less confident of finding this island of Carteret&rsquo;s. True,
    the place was small and solitary, and, unless his reckoning was very exact,
    might easily be missed. Twice had he sailed across Carteret&rsquo;s position,
    and nothing had rewarded his search; and now he felt that another day&rsquo;s
    fruitless quest would assure him either that his observations had been incorrect
    or that the island had disappeared by some convulsion of nature. Worn out
    with anxiety, with constant watching, and his own sad emotions, nothing but
    the devotion and tender love of Mahina had kept him from ending it all with
    a loaded pistol which he always carried in his pocket.</p>
  <p>He pushed the chart away wearily, and was about to go on deck when Mahina,
    who had remained, touched his arm, and with a timid, beseeching look asked
    him to let Tairoa-Maina and the other natives have speech with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in, friends,&rdquo; he said, in kindly tones.</p>
  <p>The Tubuaian chief, who, with Talalu and two other natives, had been patiently
    waiting at the cabin door, came in, sat silently down, and waited permission
    to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak, my brother,&rdquo; said Mahina to Tairoa-Maina. &ldquo;My
    husband is wearied, and would go out upon the deck to breathe the cool wind
    of the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pleased at the relationship assigned to him by Christian&rsquo;s wife, the
    handsome young Tubuaian looked at them with affectionate regard, and said
    he and those with him desired to speak of something in their minds, at which
    they prayed him not to be angered, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; he added, with a grave
    smile, &ldquo;we men of brown skin are but fools on the great ocean when
    the sky is dull and there is neither sun nor moon nor stars to guide us.
    But with the clever white men it is different; they are full of wisdom to
    guide a ship, even if there be neither sun by day nor stars by night. Yet
    in some little things we have wisdom, and that is why we now ask that thou,
    Kirisiani, will listen to us&mdash;who are thy friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I well know,&rdquo; said the mutineer, placing his hand on Tairoa&rsquo;s
    shoulder. &ldquo;Speak, my brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou knowest, Kirisiani, that for many days I have climbed the masts
    and watched, so that I might be the first to see the land of Afit&#257;;
    and when it grew dark I have waited upon the deck and listened to hear if
    the sound of beating surf came over the sea. Last night, as Talalu and I
    lay on the deck, and the ship rose and fell and made no sound, we saw first
    one and then another of the birds called <i>kan&aacute;pu</i> fly swiftly
    over the ship towards the westward. As we watched there came another, and
    then another, and then a flock of twenty or more, and these too all flew
    swiftly westwards, for we saw their shadows darken the bright strip of water
    that shot out from the dying moon. Then, as we lay down again, there came
    to our minds that on Oeno, the little sandy islet but a day&rsquo;s sail
    from Afit&#257;, there do the <i>kan&aacute;pu</i> breed in the thick puka
    scrub which groweth in the sand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mahina quickly; &ldquo;I have heard my mother say
    that on Oeno the cries of the <i>kan&aacute;pu</i> when they come home to
    roost at night drown the noise of the breaking surf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said the Tubuaian, &ldquo;and so have I been told. Yet
    only at night; for in the daytime they fly to the lagoon of Fenua-manu, where
    they find many fish. We talked of this as we lay on the deck, and I desired
    to come and tell thee, Kirisiani, of the flight of the birds, but feared
    that thou wouldst chide me for doubting thy skill to guide the ship. But
    I have heard some of those with us say some little things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian smiled bitterly. &ldquo;They speak truly, my friend; I cannot
    find this land of Afit&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leaning over towards him and placing his hand on Christian&rsquo;s, the
    Tubuaian continued: &ldquo;But this morning, when the lower half of the sun
    was still buried in the sea, we saw many, many <i>kan&aacute;pu</i> and <i>katafa</i> flying
    swiftly towards it, and Afit&#257; lieth between Oeno and Fenua-manu.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. &ldquo;Thanks, my good friend. I see now
    thy meaning. For two days have I thought that the ship hath come too far
    towards the rising sun, and that the place we seek lieth westward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even so think we,&rdquo; answered Talalu, &ldquo;for the current
    runneth strong towards the rising sun, and the <i>kan&aacute;pu</i> and the <i>katafa</i> went
    westward to rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a little while Christian considered. Oeno, the sandy island which both
    Mahina and Tairoa asserted was but a day&rsquo;s sail north and west from
    Afit&#257;, was not marked in any of the two or three charts he possessed,
    but Ducie Island, the &ldquo;Fenua-manu,&rdquo; or Island of Birds, of the
    natives, was, and lay due east of Oeno. And he knew the natives relied much
    upon simple indications to find their position when making long voyages at
    sea. He soon made up his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We will turn the ship to follow the <i>kan&aacute;pu</i>,&rdquo; he
    said.</p>
  <p>The natives sprang to their feet, and with animated countenances waited
    for him to precede them on deck.</p>
  <p>The <i>Bounty</i>, with the gentle trade-wind filling her sails, was steering
    an E.N.E. course, when Christian, with Mahina and the others, came on deck.
    Sitting near the wheel was Young, who had charge of the watch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young,&rdquo; said Christian, &ldquo;I am convinced that if this
    island is in existence it is to the west of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So Alrema says,&rdquo; nonchalantly replied the young man; &ldquo;but
    I didn&rsquo;t think it worth while mentioning it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you say? Shall we keep her away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;why not? As we cannot find it ourselves by the chart
    let us go west by all means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hands to the braces, men!&rdquo; called out Christian after a moment&rsquo;s
    hesitation. &ldquo;We are going to run down to the westward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a few minutes the yards were hauled round, and the <i>Bounty</i> was
    heading west by north. Telling Talalu and Tairoa to go aloft, Christian turned
    to Young and Smith and related the incident of the previous night.</p>
  <p>About four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, just as Christian was about to
    lie down for an hour, there burst from Talalu on the fore top-gallant yard
    a cry that sent a thrill through the hearts of every one on board&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Te fenua no Afit&#257;!</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The land of Afit&#257;!&rdquo;).</p>
  <p>There was a sudden rush aloft, Christian himself ascending the main rigging
    slightly in advance of McCoy, Quintal, and Young.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There it is, sir!&rdquo; said Quintal excitedly, pointing almost
    right ahead.</p>
  <p>Then as the others saw the faint blue outline of a pyramidal peak rising
    from the sea, a cheer broke from them, and the people on the deck took it
    up and repeated it again and again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; said Christian to Edward Young. Instinctively their
    hands met, and in silence they all gazed intently at the little spot, which
    at that far distance no eye but that of a seaman or a native could distinguish
    from a cone-shaped cloud. Ducie Island, about ninety miles east of Pitcairn.
    It is uninhabited now. The old name, Fenua-manu, meant &ldquo;The
    Island of Birds.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
    The Story of Afit&#257;</b></h2>
  <p>Towards sunset, when the <i>Bounty</i> was still some thirty miles distant
    from the land, the trade-wind as usual died away, and by eight in the evening
    the new moon shone over a sea as calm as a mountain lake. Fearing that the
    easterly current would set the ship back in the night during the continuance
    of the calm, Christian and Young had carefully taken the ship&rsquo;s bearings
    just as the pale blue of the distant island was changing to a shade of purple
    under the rays of the setting sun.</p>
  <p>The knowledge that their long search was ended at last inspirited every
    one on board. After supper the men gathered on the main deck, and with their
    wives and their brown-skinned shipmates forgot the weary days which had tried
    their tempers and forbearance so severely. Alrema, who had an influence upon
    her countrymen almost equal to that of Mahina, was in high spirits, and Young,
    despite his usual seeming indifference to her vivacity and beauty, was yet
    secretly pleased to see the respect with which she was treated by the others.
    Her conduct during the attack on the fort at Tubuai had shown her to be possessed
    of a fiery, undaunted courage; indeed, had the murmurers known that this
    beautiful Tahitian girl with the dark, languorous eyes, and soft red lips
    had advised Young to induce Christian to shoot them, they would have remembered
    the incident of the bloody cutlass, and been more careful of their speech
    in her hearing. Yet now she seemed but a merry-hearted, mirth-loving
    girl, and as she raised her sweet voice in some old Tahitian love-song, while
    her eyes sought those of Edward Young, the men were struck with her bright
    and animated beauty.</p>
  <p>Tired of singing and talking with the group assembled on the main-deck,
    she presently ascended to the poop, where her husband sat with Christian
    and Mahina discussing their plans for the future.</p>
  <p>She seated herself beside Young, and listened till they ceased talking&mdash;then
    said, clasping Mahina&rsquo;s hand in her own, &ldquo;Tell us, oh friend
    of my heart, the story of this land of Afit&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied Mahina, smiling and stroking Alrema&rsquo;s dark
    hair, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis but little I know, and that little did I learn from
    my mother; but call hither Tairoa-Maina, and let him tell the story, for
    he hath more knowledge of Afit&#257;  than I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian&rsquo;s consent having been gained, the Tubuaian chief was called
    upon the poop, and sat in front of the little group with his two faithful
    attendants behind him; his swart, handsome features lit up with pleasure
    when he was told what was wanted of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kirisiani,&rdquo; said Mahina, caressing her husband&rsquo;s cheek
    with her soft, brown hand, &ldquo;but for this dear friend, Tairoa-Maina,
    still might we have been searching for this land of his and my father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; answered Christian frankly, &ldquo;but for him we might
    perhaps have never found it. Thou seest, Mahina, that in some things the
    white men have not the knowledge nor judgment of thy people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; she answered gravely, &ldquo;we have no such things
    as those <i>tuhi</i> (books) of thine which are full of wisdom. And it is
    strange to us that by looking at some little black marks thou couldst tell
    us of the sea chief who saw the land of Afit&#257; thirty years ago. Yet,
    though we have no wise men among us like thee and the great Tuti and Pirai,
    we have memories and songs and tales which have come down from father to
    son; and all that is told is remembered by the children, and they, when they
    grow up, tell it to their children, so that all may know the beginning of
    things since Taaroa the father of the gods and his two sons Oro and Tane
    made the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Acquainted as he was in some degree with the wild and fabulous nature of
    almost every Polynesian tradition bearing upon the ancestry of the people,
    Christian was convinced by the many long conversations he had held with Mahina
    about her descent that much of what she told him had a basis of fact. The
    Tahitian custom of deifying their ancestors would naturally result in confusing
    historical facts and rendering them absurd, but his keen observation and
    quickly acquired knowledge of the Tahitian tongue enabled him to sift out
    in a great measure the real from the fabulous and visionary. He therefore,
    while listening to Tairoa-Maina&rsquo;s story of Afit&#257;, quickly divested
    it of all that was mythological and fictitious, and accepted the substance
    of it as fact.</p>
  <p>To his mind much of what Mahina told him of Afit&#257; had appeared no more
    than the vague traditions of native legend, but as he listened to the Tubuaian
    chief&rsquo;s story he found a remarkable resemblance between the two accounts.</p>
  <p>Sitting in the light of the moon, which fell upon his symmetrical head and
    shoulders and revealed the curious and delicate tracery of the tattooing
    upon his polished skin, the young chief related the Tubuaian story about
    the land and the people whence he came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Long, long ago, Kirisiani, Taaroa the Sky-Producer, and Oro and Tane
    his sons, between them created new lands by dipping their hands to the bottom
    of the deep sea and dragging them up above the surface, so that the trees
    might grow and men live upon them. In those days there dwelt upon Huahine
    a <i>taata paari</i> (wise man) named Poiata, who had himself been created
    by the gods, and his wife Mahinihini. In the same house lived Rumia and his
    wife Motupapa; only these four were on Huahine. At the end of two years neither
    of the women had borne a child to their husbands, and Poiata and Rumia, assailing
    them with bitter words and blows, drove them away to the sea-shore, and bade
    them go swim out into the ocean and drown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; cried Mahinihini, &lsquo;give us a canoe, so that
    at least we may seek some other land and hide the shame of our childlessness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Poiata and Rumia laughed and jeered at them, and pointing to
    a great shark that lay upon the water outside the reef, mockingly bade them
    hold on to its fin and begone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now this shark was Tahua; and the two women, who wept as they swam,
    approached him silently, and clambering upon his great back, held on to his
    fin while Tahua sped away with them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For many days he swam southward and eastward, till Mahinihini and
    Motupapa saw, rising out of the sea, what seemed the fin of another great
    shark; so high was it that it pierced the clouds, even as does the peak of
    Orohena. But when they drew near they saw that it was land rising up steeply
    from the deep sea, and on the high cliffs there stood strange men with yellowish
    faces and circlets of red and green parrots&rsquo; feathers round their foreheads.
    As the two women gazed in fear and trembling, Tahua the shark sank from beneath
    them, and they struck out and swam to the shore. The strange men ran down
    the cliffs and helped them to land, and gave them food to eat and coconuts
    to drink. Seven men were they, and they said they came from a great country
    to the east where the mountain-tops were for ever covered with white clouds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How came they there?&rdquo; asked Christian.</p>
  <p>Tairoa-Maina shook his head. &ldquo;No man knoweth. But they were pleased
    to see Motupapa and Mahinihini, for there were no women with them on the
    island, which they had named Afit&#257;&mdash;&lsquo;the land shot up by
    fire from the bottom of the sea.&rsquo; So these two women became wives to
    the seven men, and they bore seven children to each man. By and by, as the
    years passed on, there came more of the strange people from the great eastern
    land; and they were pleased with the beauty of Afit&#257; and the great richness
    of the land, and dwelt with Mahinihini and Motupapa and their husbands. Very
    joyously they lived together, until the people grew so in number that breadfruit
    and <i>taro</i> and yams and plantains began to be scarce because of the
    many mouths of children who cried with hunger. And when the land would no
    longer hold them and famine came, twenty-and-two score men and women sailed
    far away in canoes to seek another home. Westward they sailed for ten days
    till a storm separated them, and four of the canoes came to the land of Tubuai,
    and four to the land of Rapa. Of those that reached the land of Rapa I know
    nought, save that the chief was named Teata-rua; but of those that came to
    Tubuai my father was one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did he ever tell thee how appeared this Afit&#257;, this lonely
    island that springeth up from the sea like the fin of a shark that swimmeth
    on the surface?&rdquo; asked Mahina.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have heard my father say,&rdquo; answered the chief, &ldquo;that
    so steep are its mountains that they shut in from the winds the rich soil
    of the belly of the land; and down the sides of the hills run many streams
    of water sweet to drink. And save in one place no reef ran out from the shore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That does not agree with Carteret,&rdquo; said Young to Christian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the great ocean rollers,&rdquo; added Mahina, &ldquo;for ever
    dashed up against the face of the cliffs so that no strangers could land
    in their canoes, else would they be broken to pieces in the angry surf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But still there is one little spot on the north and north-west,&rdquo;  continued
    the Tubuaian chief, &ldquo;so small that only those who have lived in Afit&#257;  can
    find it, where the sea is not always rough. And on the eastern side there
    is a small bay, where, when the wind is from the west and south, the sea
    is quiet, and a deeply-laden canoe can land with safety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is the water deep?&rdquo; asked Christian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, so deep is it, that five fathoms from the shore the water is
    as blue as the deep ocean; and close to the high cliffs swim great fish that
    we in Tubuai catch only with lines a hundred fathoms in length. Ah, Kirisiani,
    to-morrow wilt thou see if Mahina and I have told thee aught but the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the pleasant tones of the chief&rsquo;s voice ceased there came a gentle
    puff of air, which filled the ship&rsquo;s upper canvas, and Christian and
    Young sprang to their feet, quickly followed by the natives, and trimmed
    the sails for the coming breeze.</p>
  <p>For three or four hours the <i>Bounty</i> slid softly over a moonlit sea;
    then as dawn broke and the red sun sprang from the horizon, Fletcher Christian
    and his comrades saw the island for which they had so long sought lying before
    them bright and shining green upon the sunlit sea.</p>
  <p>An hour later the ship was hove-to as close to the land as her safety permitted,
    and Christian, in her one boat with Taiaro-Maina and some white seamen, was
    searching for the only little bay where it was thought a landing might be
    effected.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
        Bounty Bay</b></h2>
  <p>Within twenty minutes of leaving the ship Christian and his boat&rsquo;s
    crew were close under the cliffs of the island; and rowing carefully, just
    outside the curl of the breaking surf, they sought the landing-place described
    by the Tubuaian chief as being on the south and east side. As the strong
    arms of the natives urged the boat along, Christian looked at the grim, precipitous
    cliffs which rose sheer from the thundering surf at their base, and a strange
    sense of loneliness almost akin to fear came over him. The outlines of the
    solitary island were savage, and the terror of its forbidding exterior was
    increased by the tumult of the waves which hurled themselves with astounding
    fury against its grey coral walls. Sometimes, as a huge, swelling sea swept
    in like a moving wall towards them, the natives would give a warning cry;
    and Christian, bringing the boat&rsquo;s head round to meet it, would watch
    the mighty volume of water fling itself, with a hoarse roar, high upwards
    against the solid face of stone, to fall back in drenching sheets of foam
    upon the swirling cauldron which leapt and eddied and boiled beneath. Here
    and there deep and narrow chasms split up the vertical mass of rock, and
    into these gaps, many of them terminating in caverns black as night, the
    sea rushed with such irresistible force that misty spray and spume shot upward
    over the very summits of the cliffs, like the belching smoke from the crater
    of a volcano in the throes of a violent convulsion. Right to the verge there
    drooped down in places thick clusters of a light-green coloured creeper,
    whose pendants, turned yellow by the salty spray, swayed wildly to and fro
    like banners waved by mysterious, invisible hands, so fierce were the air
    blasts caused by the terrific inrush of water.</p>
  <p>Scarcely speaking above a whisper, the natives rowed quickly along, their
    dark eyes shining with pleasure when they saw the feathery tufts of coco-palms
    showing above the dense thicket scrub, where the cliffs were less precipitous
    and revealed a slight glimpse of the interior of the island. And now, as
    the boat drew near the south-western point where a high, cathedral-like rock
    stood, blackly-grim, amid the white seethe of boiling surge, there came a
    strange wild clamour, a savage symphony of crashing, thundering surf and
    hoarse guttural croaks and shrill pipings, and from every crag and rock and
    jagged pinnacle along the shore, there soared aloft a vast swarm of sea-birds,
    which whirled and circled above the boat with outstretched wing and frightened
    eye. Then, as if satisfied with their quick scrutiny of the strange intruders,
    they rose higher in air and vanished behind the towering cliffs.</p>
  <p>Keeping well clear of three or four sharp-peaked rocks which raised their
    black heads from the water as the receding billows uncovered them to view,
    the boat at last rounded the point and Christian headed her along the shore
    to the north-west; and almost at the same moment Tairoa-Maina drew in his
    oar, and sprang to his feet with an exultant shout.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See, Kirisiani! the beach! the beach! And see, too, the leaping torrent
    above. &rsquo;Tis indeed the land of Afit&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian, himself too excited to speak, now gave his attention to effecting
    a landing; the crew took in their oars and, picking up canoe paddles in their
    place, waited for the word to run the boat ashore during a lull in the surf,
    which even on the sheltered beach broke heavily. For some five or ten minutes
    they lay rising and falling upon the rollers; then, seeing his opportunity,
    Christian gave the order, the natives plunged their paddles into the water
    with swift, strong strokes, and sent the boat spinning shoreward on the crest
    of a curling wave. Twenty feet from the beach they leapt out, in another
    minute the boat had touched the shingle, and the crew had hauled it out of
    danger.</p>
  <p>Directly in front of them was a winding path, long unused, which led to
    a plateau beyond; Christian and Tairoa led the way up the ascent, and they
    quickly gained the edge. And then even Christian could not repress a cry
    of excited admiration at the marvellous beauty of the scene. Back from the
    white beach, which like a strip of ivory lay below amid the emerald green
    of a belt of encircling coco-palms, there stood revealed an amphitheatre
    of the loveliest verdure and most enchanting appearance, surrounded on three
    sides by wild and densely wooded mountains. Westward, about a mile away across
    the plateau, a lofty peak raised itself high above its less conspicuous fellows,
    whose bold and romantic-looking semicircle, diversified by noble, jutting
    crags and tapering peaks, encompassed the softer beauties of the smiling
    valley. Scarcely more than a mile in width from east to west, the extraordinary
    fertility and variety of verdure was such that Christian and his companions
    gazed upon their surroundings with feelings little short of rapture. Overhead,
    the lofty plumes of the stately palms swayed and rustled to the flower-scented
    breath of the trade-wind as it stirred the rich green foliage of the breadfruit
    trees. Along the seaward-facing edge of the plateau clusters of pandanus
    palms, with their ripe, red fruit, waved their feathery banners to the breeze.
    Beyond the crowns of the murmuring palms, and the wide outspreading branches
    of the <i>tamanu</i> and breadfruit and pandanus trees, lay the blue, heaving
    bosom of the Pacific.</p>
  <p>For some little time they remained spellbound, drinking in the beauty of
    land and sea and sky around them, and listening to the music of the mountain
    torrent as it wound downward through its rocky bed to the bright valley,
    to mingle its pure waters with the ocean. Then with a sigh of satisfaction
    the leader bade his men follow him back to the boat. A mile off he could
    see the <i>Bounty</i>, which had just gone about, and was now standing in
    again, her white canvas shining in the dazzling sunlight.</p>
  <p>Before launching the boat, the crew threw into her a hundred or more of
    young drinking coconuts, which they had hastily gathered from the nearest
    trees, for the use of the women. Then, all talking together of the richness
    and fertility of the island, they picked up their canoe paddles and quickly
    sent the boat in safety through the breaking surf.</p>
  <p>Christian was soon on deck and described the appearance and capabilities
    of the island to the foremost of his comrades, who were all well pleased
    at his account, and left their future course entirely in his hands. He was
    not long, therefore, in coming to a decision.</p>
  <p>The wind was now from the south-east and blew gently but steadily into the
    little bay, so it was agreed that the ship should work round the south-west
    point and be headed directly for the beach. The deep water which ran close
    to the foot of the mountains all round the island, except where a narrow
    strip of beach separated land and sea, would enable them to get everything
    out of the <i>Bounty</i> likely in the future to be useful; and the destruction
    of the ship, Christian knew, would prevent his companions from yielding to
    any sudden impulse and risking his and their safety by an attempt to leave
    the long-sought place of refuge.</p>
  <p>In order that Young and Brown (the gardener) might take a look at their
    future home, Christian sent the boat away a second time; for the wind being
    light it would be some time before he could effect the purpose he had in
    view. Two hours later, when she was within a quarter of a mile of the southern
    point of the little bay, the boat was seen coming out again, and soon gained
    the ship. Young was greatly pleased with the beauty of the place, and reported
    that he had searched for a suitable anchorage and had found a spot where
    the ship would be safe enough during the continuance of such calm weather,
    for the sea on that side of the island was but moderate.</p>
  <p>But at the word &ldquo;anchorage&rdquo; Christian shook his head, and Young
    therefore pursued the subject no further. Brown, who had a considerable knowledge
    of botany, said that he had found many plants upon the island which were
    edible and would prove of value; and his and Young&rsquo;s remarks confirmed
    Christian and the others in their opinion that the island would, when the
    ship&rsquo;s stores were exhausted, yield them ample provisions in all respects
    save that of animal food. The varied fruits and vegetables also would be
    enough to support them till the ship&rsquo;s stock of goats, pigs, and fowls
    had so increased that they might begin to kill them with safety.</p>
  <p>The boat being passed astern, Christian hove the ship to, called all hands
    together and told them his intentions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have decided to run the ship ashore, and then burn her,&rdquo; he
    said.</p>
  <p>Without hesitation every one agreed to abide by his decision. Then the sails
    of the <i>Bounty</i> were filled for the last time, and in a few minutes
    she was heading straight for the beach.</p>
  <p>Every heart on board beat more quickly as the old ship neared the end of
    her life.</p>
  <p>Christian, his eyes fixed upon a small rock which marked the centre of the
    little bay, stood at the helm. The act of severing this last link with the
    past almost unnerved him, and every moment of the ship&rsquo;s progress towards
    the breakers seemed like an hour. Whole years of time in the life that was
    now for ever gone raced swiftly in the current of his thoughts. But this,
    the end for him of all his past, so lingered in its fulfilment, that time
    after time he was on the point of throwing the ship aback, saving her from
    destruction before it was too late and giving him, felon as he was, a last
    chance to end his days, even though a fugitive, in a foreign land; or he
    could return to England, and then&mdash;a disgraceful death. With the means
    of escape cut off perpetual exile faced him, and disseverance from all which
    was once dear.</p>
  <p>A slight touch upon his arm, and Mahina stood looking into his face and
    reading his mind as clearly as if he had spoken aloud. With the gentle pressure
    of her hand, the look of unutterable love from the dark, tender eyes, his
    indecision was gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thou art right; I was wavering. To
    all men this moment comes sometimes in their lives, and they often decide
    wrongly; but between thee and what lieth beyond I should indeed be a fool
    to hesitate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her lips quivered; bending her head over the wheel she kissed his hand,
    and her warm tears of silent sympathy nerved him anew.</p>
  <p>A few seconds more, and with a voice as firm as though he were about to
    anchor the ship, Christian gave the word to let go the halliards and sheets,
    and, while the hissing of the boiling surf breaking across the entrance of
    the bay drowned the rattle of blocks and the flapping of canvas, the <i>Bounty</i> ploughed
    through the seas towards the shore. Wave after wave swept roaring past her
    on either side, their snowy summits running level with the tops of her bulwarks;
    with slowness tormenting to her expectant crew, she gradually lost her way,
    struck the beach gently, ground a few feet of furrow in the glistening pebbles
    and sand, and then settled into her last resting-place with scarcely a quiver
    of her timbers.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
    Hewers of Wood and Drawers of Water</b></h2>
  <p>With shouts of joy the Tahitians and Tubuaians, men and women alike, clambered
    from the bows of the ship to the beach; the white men caught their enthusiasm,
    and they too, all but Christian, who remained with Mahina, jumped ashore,
    and for a while everything was forgotten but the one delightful truth that
    the weary quest for a resting-place was ended at last.</p>
  <p>Christian, however, soon recalled them to the need for work. Before abandoning
    their old home it was necessary to build a new one. So the ship was made
    as secure as possible where she lay, and while the white men went to work
    to dismantle her, the brown people, with Christian and Mahina, set about
    selecting a site for their dwellings.</p>
  <p>For the first few days after landing they lived in tents and such rough
    shelters as could be built with canvas and planks from the ship, and during
    this time a survey was made of the island. It was then by mutual consent
    divided into nine parts&mdash;one portion to each Englishman. As for the
    islanders, none of the white men, except Christian and Smith, seemed to think
    of them as having equal shares and rights in the undertaking; even Mahina
    seemed surprised that her husband should regard them as anything but servants
    and tillers of the soil. Finding that all the other seamen except Smith were
    determined against giving their brown associates any land whatever, Christian,
    after a few words of expostulation, withdrew all further opposition and let
    matters take their course, and the Tahitians and Tubuaians began to build
    houses and prepare land for planting.</p>
  <p>But just as axes and hoes had been served out to the natives by McCoy and
    Young, and while the rest of Christian&rsquo;s comrades were present, the
    Tubuaian chief stepped out from among the natives, and fixing his eyes on
    the man Williams, who had especially resented the idea that land should be
    given them, he addressed Christian. He spoke very slowly and clearly, and
    even those of the mutineers whose knowledge of the Tubuaian language was
    limited, could grasp the meaning of his words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, Tairoa-Maina, am a chief. In my own land of Tubuai, for me, a
    warrior and a man of good blood, to labour for others would be shameful and
    degrading. But I and Talalu, who is my friend, and of as good blood as myself,
    have no thoughts such as this now; our hearts are eaten up with love for
    Kirisiani and his wife Mahina, and for they alone do I and Talalu go forth
    to labour like slaves. Like myself, Kirisiani is a chief in his own land,
    that I well know. And I know, oh men of Peretane, that there are some among
    you who have evil in your hearts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cease, cease, my brother,&rdquo; said Mahina, taking the chief&rsquo;s
    hand. &ldquo;Well do my husband and myself know that thou and Talalu are
    indeed friends to us; but, I pray thee, make no bad blood between him and
    the other white men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always had too much to say,&rdquo; said Williams, advancing
    to Tairoa savagely with his hand upon his knife. Christian sprang upon him
    and gripped him by the wrist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand back, Williams. Raise your hand to that man and I&rsquo;ll
    choke you. Do you want to begin our new life by bloodshed? Listen to me,
    and weigh well my words. I have long seen how you have tried to harass and
    thwart me in my endeavours for our common good; of that which is passed I
    will think no more; but, by the living God, do not attempt it again! And
    do not seek to injure this man Tairoa-Maina, who has been a good friend to
    us all, and should in common justice have equal rights with ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a look of bitter hatred, Williams sullenly turned away, and calling
    his wife Faito to follow him, left the others and took no further part in
    their discussions.</p>
  <p>During the following week the <i>Bounty</i> was stripped of everything below
    and aloft, inside and outside; even her planks were removed from her sides,
    and the copper, nails, bolts, and such useful articles carefully stored on
    shore, and nothing of her being left out of the water but the frame, she
    was set on fire. What remained of her charred hull was floated and sunk in
    the bay, which from that day the white men called Bounty Bay, and
    the Tubuaians <i>Te Moega te Pahi</i>&mdash;the resting-place of the ship.</p>
  <p>Although Christian relinquished the command of his fellow adventurers as
    soon as they had landed, he was still tacitly recognised as their leader,
    and his advice sought and taken upon many matters. For some days the people
    lived in tents, and all, brown and white alike, worked at clearing the nine
    portions of land, and building thereon houses, the roofs of which were skilfully
    and quickly thatched by the women. For this they used the stiff leaves of
    the pandanus or screw-palm, which grew on the island in profusion, and yielded,
    in addition to its strong, useful timber and leaves, quantities of rich yellow
    fruit.</p>
  <p>Mahina, always a favourite with the Tahitians, had now gained very great
    influence over them all, and Alrema, who was possessed of undaunted courage
    and iron resolution, was equally well-liked, and was a fitting mate
    for her husband, who, reckless as he was by nature, felt and yielded to the
    influence of his young and beautiful wife, whose easy manners and soft ways
    veiled, as he knew, a capacity for heroic deeds where her love for him was
    concerned or her jealousy or hatred was aroused. Unknown to Christian she
    had been, from the very day of their return to Tahiti, a silent force working
    both in his and her husband&rsquo;s interests to maintain their supremacy
    over the rest of the white men. Nothing escaped her keen observation; danger
    to Christian, she knew, meant danger to Young, and she was quick to note
    and take heed of the slightest murmuring of disaffection, and to nullify
    it by inducing Christian, either through Mahina or Young, to make some concession.</p>
  <p>Of Quintal and Williams she was especially distrustful. The former, once
    an ardent supporter of Christian, had of late begun to associate much with
    Williams, who was of a dangerous and savage disposition. Faito, his wife,
    was a tender, delicate girl, scarcely more than fifteen years of age; but
    at a period when even the roughest and coarsest of men might have been expected
    to have shown her some tenderness and consideration, she received nothing
    but curses for her weakness and incapacity to attend fully to his wants.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she one day said weepingly to Alrema and Mahina,
    as the three were plaiting thatch for the roof of a house, &ldquo;perhaps
    he will again be the same to me when my child is born and I become strong
    again. But to-day he cursed me because, being wearied, I lay down for a little
    while, and he said that he was a fool to take such a weak thing as I to wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alrema&rsquo;s eye flashed and her white teeth showed through her parted
    lips. &ldquo;Aye, I heard the dog&mdash;and I heard more; what said he of
    Malama, the wife of Kawintali (Quintal)?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Faito covered her face with her hands; in an instant Mahina&rsquo;s arms
    were round her waist and her head pillowed upon Mahina&rsquo;s bosom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, heed him not, Faito; Malama fears him, and never wilt thou be
    wronged by her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl tried to smile through her tears. &ldquo;It may be so; but to-day
    he said that &rsquo;twas Malama who should have been wife to him, for she
    is well and strong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so strong but that my knife shall eat into her heart if she comes
    between thy husband and thee,&rdquo; said Alrema fiercely. &ldquo;Her husband
    is but a dull head where women are concerned; but thy husband is as cunning
    as a rat. And I know that they both are evilly disposed to Kirisiani and
    to my husband; they say this land of Afit&#257; is too small for so many.
    By and by they shall have but a very small piece&mdash; so small indeed that
    a child may step across it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With these ominous words Alrema went away; and so began to germinate the
    seeds of discontent and distrust, which later ripened to a deadly feud.</p>
  <p>But for some little time matters went on well enough; even those who were
    secretly resentful of Christian&rsquo;s influence over their brown-skinned
    associates yet worked willingly enough for the common good, and performed
    the daily task allotted to them without murmuring.</p>
  <p>Within three weeks, nine houses&mdash;one for each of the mutineers&mdash;were
    completed, and Christian one day announced that the next joint work would
    be to provide four similar dwellings, three for the Tahitians and their wives,
    and one for the three Tubuaians&mdash;who, being single men, would live together.</p>
  <p>For some moments no one spoke&mdash;then Williams, who was sitting beside
    Quintal upon the bole of a large <i>toa</i> tree which had been felled for
    house-building, laid down his pipe, stood up, and confronted Christian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect us to build houses for these natives, do you,
    Mr. Christian?&rdquo; he said, and Alrema, who stood near, noted the glance
    that passed between him and Quintal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should we not? Are not these people as good as ourselves? Have
    they not done thrice as much as we have in building our own dwellings?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He spoke quietly, but there was a dangerous tone in his voice, and Young,
    Mahina, and Alrema, who knew now his slightest mood, looked with anxiety
    for what was to follow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, for one, will be damned if I work for savages,&rdquo; said Quintal,
    rising and standing beside Williams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come here to work, Mr. Christian,&rdquo; joined in
    Mills, the gunner&rsquo;s mate, gloomily; &ldquo;I think these fellows ought
    to work for us, and not we for them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are all pretty much of this opinion?&rdquo; asked Christian slowly,
    with an inquiring glance, and in a savagely contemptuous tone of voice.</p>
  <p>A quick and angry murmur of assent came from all but Young and Smith, who
    quietly walked apart from the others and stood beside Christian.</p>
  <p>Then Smith, after a whispered word with Alrema and his own wife, Terere,
    stepped out in front.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, for one, sir, will lend a hand right willingly. Give your orders,
    Mr. Christian, and I&rsquo;ll obey them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This brought no remark from the rest, and Young drawing his comrade aside,
    said quietly, &ldquo;My dear Christian, what is the use of sneering at the
    men in this fashion. It is scarcely likely that British seamen&mdash;damned
    lazy dogs they are, too&mdash;could be induced to work side by side with
    island savages; and your manner of asking them invited their refusal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pushing aside Young&rsquo;s restraining hand, Fletcher Christian turned
    to the group of seamen, and, with flashing eyes and voice trembling with
    rage and contempt, said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have your own way; I have done with the lot of you, and am glad to
    be clear of you. For your own sakes I have, so far, kept control. If I led
    you into mutiny I stood by you and brought you to a place of safety. I can
    die or live here&mdash;I care nothing which way it is. But understand this:
    I will be no party to making slaves of men whom I look upon as equal to myself&mdash;and
    superior to such damned soldiers as you. Go to hell, the whole lot of you,
    in your own way!&rdquo; Then he walked rapidly away, followed by the trembling
    Mahina, and the unmoved, undaunted Alrema.</p>
  <p>As soon as he had disappeared among the palm-groves, Talalu, who understood
    enough English to comprehend the nature of the discussion that had taken
    place, turned to Young, and said in Tahitian&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not quarrel about this matter, Etuati. There are plenty of us
    to build houses. Our hands are strong and our hearts are not made sore because
    these our friends think we alone should work on Afit&#257;. Come, my countrymen,
    let us to work. Never must angry words come between us and the white men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A cheerful assent was the response; the natives shouldered their axes and,
    followed by Tairoa and the others, walked off in single file towards a clump
    of <i>toa</i> trees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, damn it all,&rdquo; said Mills, with a coarse laugh, &ldquo;those
    fellows have more sense than Christian! <i>They</i> know well enough that
    we ain&rsquo;t the sort to work for them. Why, it&rsquo;s agin&rsquo;  nature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a few days after this nothing occurred to widen the breach. The Tahitians
    worked with a will, lightening their labours with many a song and merry jest;
    for they were by nature an amiable and kindly-hearted people, full to overflowing
    of the most generous instincts and noble impulses, and their devotion to
    Christian and his beautiful wife was sufficient reason for them to toil unrepiningly
    for the rest of the white men; to their simple minds, those who sought to
    oppress them were of Christian&rsquo;s race and, as such, had a claim upon
    them. But underneath all their present content there was yet a hidden current
    of dissatisfaction which only the quick mind of Alrema had fathomed, and
    she was a woman who meant to make use of it when the time came. So, while
    the white seamen lay in their houses and ate and drank and were waited upon
    by their obedient Tahitian wives, the brown men let the white slowly but
    surely assume the rights of masters over them, and uncomplainingly became
    hewers of wood and drawers of water.</p>
  <p>At night when the fires were blazing and the rude lamps brought from the
    ship were lighted, the islanders would assemble in front of the white men&rsquo;s
    houses; and with the wives of the mutineers (except Alrema and Mahina) sing
    old Tahitian songs such as the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> people had heard in
    the days when their ship floated on the placid waters of Matavai Bay. Sometimes,
    when the sea was smooth, men and women together would go down to the ledges
    of the cliffs and fish in the deep waters at their base, returning home laden
    with many a weighty basket. Tairoa-Maina and his two countrymen had
    already made a canoe, and the marvellous ingenuity with which it was constructed
    with such rough tools&mdash;for they had but axes and knives and a few chisels&mdash; aroused
    the admiration even of the lazy Englishmen. The houses of the white men,
    too, were monuments of the untiring patience and skill of the Tahitians.
    Built of the timber of breadfruit and <i>toa</i>, and thatched beautifully
    with the russet-coloured leaves of the pandanus palm, oblong in shape, they
    bore an almost exact resemblance, inside and out, to the dwellings in Tahiti
    and Tubuai. Their furniture was nearly all of native pattern, and consisted
    in each house of the owner&rsquo;s share of the spoils from the <i>Bounty</i>,
    with rough wooden stools and benches made from the wood of the breadfruit, <i>toa</i> or <i>tamanu</i> tree.
    The floors were first of all laid out with about a foot of smooth, seaworn
    pebbles, brought by the women in baskets from the little beach where the
    ship was run ashore, and then covered over with coarse mats of coconut leaf.
    Over this was spread finer matting made from the pandanus leaf, and over
    this again squares of canvas cut from the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> sails. Upon
    this a thick layer of still finer mats, brought from Tahiti, was placed,
    and this formed the beds of the occupants.</p>
  <p>The long months spent at sea upon the ship had greatly changed the habits
    and customs of the Tahitians, until in some things there was but little difference
    between them and their white associates&mdash;or rather masters. But now
    that they were both once more on land the Englishmen were glad to adopt,
    in their turn, many of the ways of the natives, and so the two races gradually
    acquired from each other such new habits and modes of life as were best suited
    to their altered state.</p>
  <p>To their white husbands the Tahitian women were always considerate and dutiful;
    they ministered to the men&rsquo;s wants so skilfully that the rough sailors
    found their days slip by in the greatest ease and comfort, and had some sort
    of selfish affection for their wives. It was contrary to the custom of Tahiti
    for the women to eat with the men, or even to drink out of the same utensils
    as their husbands, or partake of food which had been either handled or prepared
    by the superior sex; and in this respect the laws of custom proved too strong
    to be broken, even though their husbands good-humouredly urged them to do
    so, they were quite content to wait upon their lords and masters and eat
    by themselves afterwards. But Christian, Young, and Smith, who regarded their
    wives as something better than mere chattels or objects of selfish passion,
    tried hard to combat this custom, and in some degree succeeded; so that Mahina,
    Alrema, and Terere all abandoned the Tahitian habit of one regular meal on
    rising, and taking food and drink at infrequent intervals during the remainder
    of the day, and prepared and ate meals in the English fashion.</p>
  <p>Although no longer on more than terms of ordinary civility with the rest
    of the white men, other than Young and Smith, Christian would come in the
    evenings sometimes from his house to exchange a few words with them as they
    sat outside upon the grassy sward before their dwellings listening to the
    Tahitians as they sang and chanted or played music upon their reed <i>vivos</i>.
    When they were tired of singing, the happy monotony of the long nights would
    be relieved by the brown women, who, like all Polynesians, were born story-tellers,
    with tales of their early childhood, the old traditions and legends of their
    island homes, and about the marvellous origin and great deeds of their ancestors.
    Fabulous and absurd as was much even of their history&mdash;for it was so
    interwoven with their wild mythology that the seamen merely heard it with
    a good-natured smile of contempt&mdash;there was yet enough of truth in it
    to interest Christian and Young; and their attention pleased the wives of
    the seamen greatly, and indeed helped to sow the seeds of indifference towards
    their husbands, who they now began to perceive were men in intelligence far
    below the one-time officers of the <i>Bounty</i>.</p>
  <p>But even the rough seamen could not fail to be amused at some of the early
    Tahitian notions of England. For instance, they had somehow acquired the
    idea&mdash;perhaps from travellers&rsquo; tales of early voyages&mdash; that
    England was once a large island, the centre of which was made of iron; but
    continuous wars with other nations had resulted in all the outside soil being
    shot away with cannon balls till there was nothing left but a solid mass
    of iron. It was also believed that there were ships in England forty leagues
    long with masts so high that they pierced beyond the clouds, and that a young
    man in full health and strength going to the masthead grew grey before he
    reached the deck again; while on the great round tops of the lower masts
    were rich gardens of fruit, in which men lived.</p>
  <p>Another story told how the captain of an English ship of war, which carried
    so many cannons that it took one man a year to count them, was incensed at
    the conduct of the people of a certain island; so that hooking one of the
    ship&rsquo;s anchors to a mountain, he set sail, tore the island from its
    foundations, and towed it away to the region of cold, where the people perished.
    But although these tales were believed by their narrators, they would not
    accept the white men&rsquo;s stories of stone houses many feet high and of
    rivers crossed by bridges of stone with no support underneath.</p>
  <p>As time wore on, some of the women began to adopt the semi-European style
    of clothing; and this while it did not become them so well as their own native
    dress, yet pleased their husbands and showed the women&rsquo;s desire to
    render themselves attractive in the white men&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
    Mahina&rsquo;s First-Born</b></h2>
  <p>Gloomy and melancholy as ever, since the day of the mutiny Christian had
    gradually allowed his bitter thoughts so utterly to overcome him that even
    towards Mahina he showed cruel indifference. For days a word would not escape
    his lips, save when his wife put some direct question to him concerning his
    movements or intentions; and both Young and Smith, attached to him as they
    were, now ceased their evening visits entirely. Sometimes, when the fires
    were lit after sunset, Mahina&mdash;her dark eyes filled with tears&mdash;would
    watch her husband go to the door of their little dwelling, stand there for
    a minute or two lost in thought, and walk silently away along the edge of
    the cliffs. Often when she would have accompanied him, he quietly, but yet
    firmly, pushed her hand aside, and with an impatient exclamation quickened
    his steps so as to be away from her the sooner. Hour after hour would pass
    while Mahina, weeping softly to herself, sat outside awaiting her husband&rsquo;s
    return. Sometimes her solitude would be broken by the gigantic Talalu, whose
    dog-like devotion to Christian led him to leave his own house and join her
    in her saddened watch.</p>
  <p>Early one morning Mahina, accompanied by Alrema and Talalu, set out for
    a day&rsquo;s ramble in the wild, mountainous interior of the island; Christian,
    scarcely noting her absence, left the house a few hours later for his solitary
    haunts on the high cliffs. About sunset he returned, and the moment his figure
    appeared over the ridge behind which the little house was situated, Mahina
    ran to meet him with outstretched hands, her face radiant with childish joy.
    Placing her hand on her husband&rsquo;s arm she told him in excited tones
    that she and Talalu had found traces of her ancestors in many places on the
    southern portion of the island.</p>
  <p>Flinging down his musket, Christian seated himself on the low, rough seat
    erected by the side of his dwelling, and for some moments seemed quite oblivious
    of Mahina&rsquo;s presence. At last, however, in answer to her continued
    exclamations of delight, he replied bitterly&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trouble me not with such things, Mahina. What care I who lived here
    in the past? The misery of living in the present is enough for me,&rdquo; and
    so saying he buried his face in his hands.</p>
  <p>The savage energy in his voice made her tremble at first, but the indifferent
    manner in which he treated the news of her discovery touched her to the quick,
    and she blazed out in hot anger&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou cruel Kirisiani! What have we who love thee done that thou shouldst
    cease to care for us? What have I, thy wife, done that thou shouldst so answer
    when I speak to thee? Were I a slave thou couldst not insult me more than
    thou hast done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian merely shrugged his shoulders, rose and walked back towards the
    cliffs, although food had been prepared for him by his disheartened wife.</p>
  <p>Brushing away the tears that would still come, Mahina entered the silent
    house, put out the lamp, and seated herself before the dimly-burning fire,
    wondering what it was that had so changed her husband&rsquo;s manner towards
    her and, indeed, to every one else. That he was engaged in working alone
    on one of the highest spots on the island she knew, for he had taken tools
    with him from time to time; but where the spot was and what was the nature
    of his toil she could not even guess. He had sternly forbidden her to follow
    him, and even Talalu dared not attempt to discover his retreat.</p>
  <p>So for many days Talalu and Mahina contented themselves with talking over
    their discoveries with Tairoa-Maina, who himself a descendant of the now
    extinct people of Afit&#257;, of course took a keen interest in all that
    related to his ancestors.</p>
  <p>Taking some food with them, the three one day set out to make further explorations.
    On the eastern side of the island some rocks were discovered among a dense,
    scrubby thicket, through which they had to cut their way with seamen&rsquo;s
    cutlasses brought for the purpose; on the faces of these rocks were rude
    drawings of birds, fishes, turtle, and of the sun, moon and stars, besides
    what Tairoa-Maina said was a chart of the islands in the surrounding ocean,
    showing the track to be taken by a canoe in voyaging among them. At another
    spot, not far from the high cathedral-shaped rock on the south-east
    point, they found in a cave numbers of stone spear and arrow-heads. Many
    of these were unused implements, and the cave in which they were found had
    evidently been a storehouse for food as well as an armoury; for in its earthen
    floor were a number of pits which had once been silos for the storage of
    breadfruit, yams, and other food. Almost in the centre of the island, Tairoa
    one day came across the very burial-places of his and Mahina&rsquo;s forefathers.
    Round this cemetery were a number of rude images of human figures, and huge
    squared blocks of stone lay about in profusion.</p>
  <p>At evening they returned home, full of the important discoveries they had
    made, and would again have spoken to Christian on the subject, but that his
    distant manner forbade them.</p>
  <p>As the days passed this moroseness so grew upon him that there was little
    doubt his mind had become diseased, and about a week after Mahina&rsquo;s
    discoveries in the mountains he began to absent himself from her for two
    or three days together.</p>
  <p>Unknown even to his tender and devoted wife, he had furnished a roomy cave
    situated in a mountain recess on the opposite side of the island. It was
    his intention, he afterwards told Mahina, to hide in this cavern should a
    ship of war by any chance arrive. He had stocked it with provisions and water,
    and arms and ammunition, so that he might defend himself to the last in case
    of discovery, for he swore that he would never be taken alive.</p>
  <p>The completion of his hiding-place seemed to please him somewhat, and he
    now at times was more sociable with the other white men when by chance he
    passed their dwellings or met any of them in his lonely walks; and sometimes,
    to their great joy, he would join Talalu and the other natives in a fishing
    excursion. Then, as she saw him ascending the cliffs towards their home,
    Mahina&rsquo;s face would brighten, and she and her girl friends would eagerly
    welcome him, and instantly prepare to cook the fish he brought.</p>
  <p>For some little time matters went on without change in Christian&rsquo;s
    home till towards the close of the year an event occurred which temporarily
    roused him from his lethargy. This was the birth of his first child&mdash;a
    boy.</p>
  <p>To Mahina&rsquo;s great happiness, her husband consented that the customs
    of her race should be observed, and at her request he went away to his cave
    to remain there till the child was born.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, under the direction of Quintal&rsquo;s wife, the oldest
    Tahitian woman present, the others prepared in the centre of the great room
    a sort of bower of leaves and fine matting. Upon its floor was placed a heap
    of heated stones, which were constantly replaced by others as they cooled.
    Upon the stones were thrown great bunches of such sweet-smelling herbs and
    flowers as the island afforded, and these were from time to time sprinkled
    with water, so that the house was kept filled with the perfume of the herbs.
    In this bower Mahina remained till the birth of her infant; and then Christian
    was waited upon by the other women and asked what <i>amua</i> (gifts) he
    had ready for the child.</p>
  <p>Having been previously instructed by Quintal&rsquo;s wife, he replied&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is all that I, Kirisiani of Peretane, have for mine and Mahina&rsquo;s
    infant, for it is all that this land of Afit&#257; yields,&rdquo; and he
    placed in their hands small quantities of breadfruit, <i>taro</i>, and such
    other fruits as grew on Pitcairn. This was all that was expected of him,
    and the women went away pleased that he had allowed them to follow their
    native customs so far. In Tahiti it was the practice for a woman to live
    some weeks with her new-born infant in the sacred grounds of the <i>maraes</i> or
    temples of Oro and Tane, in order that the favour of the gods might be assured
    for the child&rsquo;s future. But under the influence of their white husbands
    the women of Pitcairn had abandoned much of their religious ceremonies, and
    so this one was not observed by Mahina, on the plea that, although they had
    found a <i>marae</i> on the island, there was nothing to show that it had
    been built by worshippers of Oro and Tane, but really because she knew that
    Christian disliked her clinging to Tahitian customs.</p>
  <p>After Christian had presented his gifts, he was followed by all the others,
    each person bringing an <i>amua</i> either of food, live stock, clothing
    or matting. These were deposited at the mother&rsquo;s feet, and the ceremonies
    were concluded.</p>
  <p>To Mahina&rsquo;s delight Christian remained constantly with her for some
    weeks after this event; his manner to her and the infant was gentle and kind,
    and she now began to hope that her husband&rsquo;s former affection for her
    had not entirely died away. Poor girl, she was soon undeceived.</p>
  <p>One evening she and her friends were at one end of the room silently toying
    with the infant; Young, Smith, and Christian were sitting smoking on the
    bench outside. The evening was wonderfully clear and still and, but for the
    ceaseless throbbing of the surf upon the cliffs below, no sound disturbed
    the silence.</p>
  <p>Presently she heard Young&rsquo;s voice addressing her husband, and (for
    she now spoke English fairly well and understood it still better) listened
    to hear what they were saying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you intend to call the boy?&rdquo; asked Young. &ldquo;Will
    you name him after yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Christian, with intense contempt; &ldquo;do you
    think that I will let the little savage perpetuate his father&rsquo;s name
    and shame? She can call the brat by any name she pleases, except mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Both Young and Smith were silent, and the latter looked troubled. Attached
    as he was to Christian, he felt that Mahina&rsquo;s steady devotion had deserved
    better of her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a strange man, Christian,&rdquo; said Young, presently; and
    calling Alrema he took her by the hand and led her away, giving Christian
    only a curt &ldquo;good-night.&rdquo; He was soon followed by Terere and
    her husband; Christian remained alone outside, lost in thought, and heard
    nothing of a soft sobbing within.</p>
  <p>Midnight was long past when he rose and went inside. He thought Mahina was
    asleep, but just as he laid his head upon the pillow he felt her hand upon
    his forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kirisiani, I heard thee speak to-night. Not all did I understand;
    only this&mdash;that thou dost despise thy child, and wilt not give him thy
    name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call it by some Tahitian name, Mahina; &rsquo;tis not an English
    child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; she answered brokenly; &ldquo;but yet &rsquo;tis thy
    child, and his eyes are thy eyes; and when I look into his face I see thy
    eyes looking into mine, as they did when thy heart was warm with love for
    me, its mother. And for this do I desire to call it by a name of thy tongue
    and by no other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he answered, after a moment&rsquo;s thought, &ldquo;have
    your own way&mdash;stay, I have a name for it. It was born upon a Thursday
    in October. Call it Thursday October, for&rdquo;&mdash;and his voice grew
    hard and sneering&mdash; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis the way they name negro children
    in the West Indies. It is only fitting that this little savage should have
    some such name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Mahina, not understanding the full meaning of his words, called her
    first-born by the name given it by her husband.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
    The First to Die</b></h2>
  <p>All day long, from the red blush of sunrise till the mantle of the quick,
    tropic night enshrouded the lonely island, thousands upon thousands of sea-birds
    circled round the high mountain peaks and vine-covered crags of Afit&#257;,
    and filled the air with their wild clamour. At one place, where the grim
    cliffs started sheer upward from the crashing surf, they had made their rookeries
    upon a series of narrow ledges which traversed the face of the rock in undulating
    lines from the summit. The highest of these ledges was perhaps fifty feet
    from the scrub-covered edge of the precipice; the lowest just out of the
    reach of the drenching spray that in stormy weather sprang upward in misty
    showers from the wild commotion of the waves beneath.</p>
  <p>Here, with faces turned seaward, the great black frigate birds and the blue-billed
    kan&aacute;pu, with many other species of ocean rangers, sat upon their eggs
    and hatched their young, and the weird cries of the fledglings mingled with
    the hoarse, croaking notes of the parent birds all through the night, and
    were borne in strange, mournful cadences and mysterious quaverings through
    the darkened forest to the dwellings of the mutineers and their brown-skinned
    associates.</p>
  <p>The eggs of these birds were much relished by the white men, and it was
    one of the duties of their patient wives to hazard their lives along the
    line of cliffs in collecting them. Sure-footed and agile, the women would
    sometimes be lowered by their companions above to the perilous ledges full
    fifty feet down, fill their baskets with eggs, and be hauled up again in
    safety, thinking nothing of the dreadful death that awaited them if the rope
    parted or they became overwhelmed with giddiness. The topmost ledge, where
    the fierce-eyed frigate birds had made their rookery, could be reached by
    clambering down the cliff and along its jagged face.</p>
  <p>For two or three days great numbers of these sea-birds had been seen flying
    swiftly towards the island from the eastward, and the Tahitians understood
    that the breeding season drew near, and that very shortly the female birds
    would be sitting.</p>
  <p>Early one morning Faito, the gentle, delicate-featured wife of the coarse
    and brutal Williams, set out along the edge of the cliffs to see if the frigate
    birds had begun to lay. She was alone. Heart-broken as she was at her husband&rsquo;s
    cruel conduct, her loving nature impelled her to venture her life upon the
    cliffs, so that she might be the first to bring the much-coveted eggs to
    her savage master.</p>
  <p>Presently, as she walked along, softly singing to herself some chant of
    her Tahitian childhood, a pretty black and white kid&mdash;the progeny of
    one of the goats brought to the island in the <i>Bounty</i>&mdash;sprang
    out from the dense thicket scrub which bordered the mountain path, and darted
    along the edge of the precipice.</p>
  <p>The cry of delight that escaped from Faito at the prospect of catching the
    animal reached the ears of Talalu, who was some few hundred yards away, cutting
    down a <i>toa</i> tree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take care, take care, Faito,&rdquo; he cried, as the girl sped swiftly
    along, her black hair streaming behind her, her dark eyes glowing, and her
    bare bosom panting in the excitement of pursuit&mdash;for she knew that the
    capture of the kid would at least bring a pleasant word from Williams; then,
    ere Talalu could shout another warning, her flying feet caught in a creeper,
    and without a cry she pitched headlong over the cliffs, with the sound of
    happy laughter yet upon her lips.</p>
  <p>Dashing through the thick scrub, Talalu reached the edge of the precipice
    and looked over; there, on a little pebbly beach, hollowed out in the face
    of a chasm in the cliffs, he saw the dead and bleeding body of Faito lying
    upon the stones.</p>
  <p>This was the prologue to a bloody tragedy yet to be enacted on Pitcairn.</p>
  <p>Clambering down to the bottom of the cliffs by a devious and dangerous route,
    Talalu at last gained the spot where the body of the dead girl lay. He took
    it tenderly in his arms and pressed his face to hers, with streaming eyes
    and sobs of pity, then slowly and laboriously began the perilous ascent.</p>
  <p>It was noon when he reached the settlement. Williams and Quintal were sitting
    together in front of the former&rsquo;s house when the Tahitian drew near
    with his burden.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the hell&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; asked the dead woman&rsquo;s
    husband roughly, when he saw his wife&rsquo;s figure lying in Talalu&rsquo;s
    brawny arms; then, brute though he was, his dark features paled when her
    countryman turned Faito&rsquo;s dead face towards him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy wife is dead, oh worker of iron. She sought to catch a kid, thinking
    to please thee. She tripped and fell&mdash;and died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gently laying the body down upon the couch or mats, he walked away without
    a word.</p>
  <p>The tidings of Faito&rsquo;s death soon brought the rest of the white men&rsquo;s
    wives to Williams&rsquo; house, sobbing as they ran. The first to fling herself
    weeping upon the cold bosom of the dead girl was Nahi, the wife of Talalu.
    She was a tall, slenderly built woman, with big, passionate eyes, although
    she had the gentle, timid manner of a child. Seating herself by the body
    of the girl, Nahi first pressed her lips to the cold face of her friend,
    and then in whispered tones directed the others in their ministrations to
    the dead. Towards sunset, as they moved to and fro in the great room of the
    house, a figure darkened the doorway and Williams&rsquo; harsh voice broke
    in upon the silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hallo, Nahi,&rdquo; he said in English, without even glancing at
    the shrouded figure upon the floor, &ldquo;how are you? It&rsquo;s not often
    I catch a sight of you&mdash;and, by God! you&rsquo;re too pretty a woman
    not to see often.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slowly Nahi rose to her feet. She understood every word that was said to
    her, yet curbed her anger, and with downcast eyes and trembling hands answered
    him in Tahitian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We come, Iron-worker, to mourn for Faito, thy wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Something in her voice, and in her trembling, yet indignant attitude, made
    the callous-hearted man turn away without a further word. He stepped to the
    door, stood there irresolutely for a moment, and then disappeared into the
    darkness.</p>
  <p>All through the night the mourning watchers sat beside the dead girl; at
    dawn the brown men dug her grave in the garden, some distance from the back
    of Williams&rsquo; dwelling. Just as the sun became level with the summit
    of the cliffs and shot its bright darts through the leafy forest aisles,
    the little funeral procession gathered round the grave, and Faito&rsquo;s
    body, lying upon a bier covered with garlands and wreaths of flowers and
    leaves, was placed beside it. Then, one by one, each of the men and women
    brought offerings of food and young drinking coconuts and placed them by
    the bier, for to them the girl&rsquo;s soul was hovering near, and her body
    would need refreshment on its long journey to the world beyond. Nahi (who
    was not only a devoted friend of Faito, but a distant blood-relation as well),
    seated herself beside the grave, and in her soft Tahitian tongue, chanted
    stories of the dead girl&rsquo;s life; she sang of her innocent childhood,
    of her deep affection for her parents; of her loving, gentle nature; of her
    soft, tender beauty; of her love for the white iron-worker, and her voyage
    with him in the <i>Bounty</i>. And then the singer&rsquo;s soul seemed to
    quicken, and her voice quivered and broke as she told the story of Faito&rsquo;s
    death; and from those who sat around came quick, responsive sobs of grief.</p>
  <p>When she ceased the women took keen-edged sharks&rsquo; teeth, and thrust
    them into their arms and shoulders till the blood poured forth, while the
    men covered their faces with their hands, and bent their heads to the ground.</p>
  <p>For nearly an hour they sat thus, then in silence the men rose and walked
    quietly away, leaving the women to mourn by themselves, in accordance with
    Tahitian custom, for two days beside the grave.</p>
  <p>That night Mahina, who was alone in the house with her child, sought out
    Christian in his cave, where he had been for the past two days, and told
    him of Faito&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her troubles are over,&rdquo; was his moody answer. &ldquo;Would
    that I had the courage to leap over the cliffs and so end mine. But why come
    and tell me this? It concerns me not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was ever my friend,&rdquo; answered Mahina, gently, &ldquo;my
    friend and thine. I pray thee come mourn with me at her burial, else will
    shame fall upon me if thou art absent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He raised his dark face to hers, and an angry gleam shone in his eyes. &ldquo;I
    tell thee, Mahina, thou dost but pester me. The woman is dead. Would I were
    in her place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou cruel man,&rdquo; she said, and the tears fell quickly from
    her eyes as she pressed her child to her bosom, &ldquo;thou art always in
    this strange mood now. Alas! what evil has happened to thee and me? What
    wicked spirit has turned thy heart against us? Art thou tired of thy wife?
    Is thy child, born to thee out of my great love, hateful to thy sight?&rdquo; Then
    the infant awoke, and she pressed it to her aching breast to soothe its cries.</p>
  <p>Christian sprang up from the matted couch upon which he lay, and with the
    light of madness in his eyes, cursed her, her child, and himself. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo;  he
    said at last, hoarsely, &ldquo;go, leave me to my misery.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
    A Loyal Friend</b></h2>
  <p>Mahina went alone to the burial of her friend, and the other women, when
    they saw her, knew that her sorrow was not so much for the dead girl as for
    the dead love of Christian.</p>
  <p>Returning from her husband&rsquo;s cave, she met Edward Young, who spoke
    so kindly that her overwrought feelings brought a flood of tears, and Young,
    with a strange look, had drawn her to him and bidden her be of good courage.
    He would always be her friend, he said, and it grieved him to see her sad.
    And Mahina, drying her tears, pressed his hand gratefully, and in her innocent
    fashion placed her cheek against his for a moment; for was he not her husband&rsquo;s
    friend and brother, and therefore hers. And Edward Young, as she walked away,
    watched her with a smile on his lips, and muttered to himself&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The man is a fool. She is a glorious creature, and I&mdash;well I
    don&rsquo;t suppose <i>he</i> cares.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On the second morning, long ere the sun had dried the glittering diamonds
    of dew trembling on every leaf and blade of grass, Williams came across the
    greensward towards his wife&rsquo;s grave and addressed the mourning women.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; he said roughly. &ldquo;Faito&rsquo;s had enough
    of this foolery, and so have I. Put her in the ground, and make an end of
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Talalu and his countrymen stepped quietly out from beneath the shade
    of a great <i>tamanu</i> tree which stood near. They had brought their final
    offerings to the dead, and as they placed these at the foot of the grave,
    all the rest of the white men but Christian appeared upon the scene.</p>
  <p>At the harsh command of Williams, the women huddled timidly together, looking
    fearfully at one another; and Talalu, leaving his countrymen, softly besought
    the man to allow them to continue their funeral customs, so that the spirit
    of Faito might rest in peace. Mahina, too, joined in his pleadings.</p>
  <p>To the brown-skinned people Williams had ever been a cruel taskmaster for
    whom they worked without murmuring for the sake of his wife, whom they loved;
    and now that she was dead he seemed to care nothing, and would not even permit
    them to &ldquo;comfort her spirit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The remaining white men looked on in curious silence, while Talalu and Mahina
    begged Williams not to interrupt them. Williams had, however, acquired a
    certain influence over his countrymen, and they were not disposed to interfere.</p>
  <p>Again the harsh voice of the man bade the mourners cease. &ldquo;Let this
    folly end,&rdquo; he said angrily in Tahitian; &ldquo;begone, and get back
    to work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The words stung Talalu to the quick, and with flashing eyes and clenched
    hands he faced the white man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou dog without a heart!&rdquo; he cried fiercely, &ldquo;may thy
    mother&rsquo;s skin be made into a water-bottle! Not content with our service
    and thy wife&rsquo;s devotion, thou would&rsquo;st harrow the soul of the
    dead with thy harsh and cruel voice. Shame on thee for a pitiless man! Go
    home and leave us with the body and the spirit of our kinswoman. She is nothing
    to thee now. Thou canst not harm her body, but her spirit is tormented by
    thy very presence here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a furious gesture Williams advanced towards him, cursing him for an
    impudent slave, in the coarse language he always used towards the Tahitians.</p>
  <p>But quick as lightning Mahina intercepted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop, thou low-born sailor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and leave us,
    as Talalu hath desired thee, or it will go ill with thee! I swear by Oro
    and Tane and the bones of my father to stab thee to the heart if thou dost
    but even raise thy hand to Talalu.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Callous as the white men were, they drew back and muttered to Williams to
    leave her and her fellow-mourners alone; and Williams himself blanched before
    the slight figure of Christian&rsquo;s wife, and with a savage threat of
    vengeance against Talalu, turned away, followed by the rest of the mutineers
    except Young. He, walking apart from them, seated himself on the trunk of
    a fallen tree near by, called Alrema, and told her to hasten to his house
    and bring his fowling-piece, as he intended to shoot some sea-birds.</p>
  <p>As soon as her graceful figure disappeared among groves of breadfruit between
    the grassy sward and the houses of the white men, Young walked over to where
    Mahina sat, apart from the others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear friend of my heart,&rdquo; he said, taking her hand, &ldquo;thou
    knowest that I am thy friend, dost thou not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Mahina, &ldquo;always my friend&mdash;my friend
    and my brother, and the friend and brother of my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A disappointed look swept over Young&rsquo;s face, and he dropped her hand
    moodily. &ldquo;Nay, not so now. It is always in my heart that he whom I
    once loved as a brother hath acted cruelly to thee. Thou art a woman fair
    and sweet, and to be for ever loved. And because he hath neglected and turned
    his heart away from thee and thy love hath my friendship for him grown smaller
    and smaller day by day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By and by, when the evil moods have left him, he will love me again,&rdquo; said
    Mahina, looking straight before her, and as she spoke, the falling tears
    belied her hopeful words.</p>
  <p>For many minutes they sat thus, she weeping softly to herself, and Young
    watching his opportunity to speak again. Presently he saw Alrema returning
    with his fowling-piece. He rose and touched Mahina lightly on the shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Farewell till to-morrow,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;Remember
    that I am always, always thy friend&mdash;and that I love thee&mdash;<i>he</i> no
    longer does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked up with a low, startled cry, and hastily rising from her seat,
    went over to the other women and took her child from Terere. The tone of
    Young&rsquo;s words had filled her with a strange feeling of misery and fear.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
    The Oppressor</b></h2>
  <p>For some time nothing happened to disturb the uneventful life of the islanders.
    Mahina, with aching heart, saw Christian daily grow more melancholy and morose,
    and was heedless of all else. But as the year drew to a close her saddened
    face and sorrowful eyes must have touched her husband&rsquo;s heart, and
    when the birth of her second child was drawing near he left the cave and
    dwelt with her till the infant was born and she was strong again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call him Charles,&rdquo; he said to her as she sat with him
    one evening nursing the infant; and the words, simple as they were, filled
    her still loving heart with a great joy. Twice only had she met Young since
    the day of Faito&rsquo;s burial, and though he had tried to detain her, she
    managed to get away from him; for she now felt that he cared for her more
    than his loyalty to Alrema justified.</p>
  <p>During the same year others of the mutineers became fathers. In addition
    to Mahina&rsquo;s two there were now three other children playing upon the
    matted floors of their parents&rsquo; dwellings by day, and lulled to sleep
    at night by the ceaseless throbbing of the surf that beat against the stern
    cliffs of their island home.</p>
  <p>The houses occupied by Christian and Mahina, Young and Alrema, and Smith
    and Terere were a considerable distance from those of the other white men.
    That of Christian was furthest north-west of all; indeed, it was quite shut
    out of view from the rest by a short, abrupt spur which shot eastward from
    the mountains almost to the verge of the beetling cliffs.</p>
  <p>Williams and Young lived near to each other. Some months after the burial
    of Faito the former called upon his neighbour and asked him to come outside
    for a few minutes. Alrema, who had noticed that her husband and Williams
    were becoming very intimate, gave the visitor an angry glance from her dark,
    long-lashed eyes, as he sat upon the bench in front of the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a bit of a walk,&rdquo; said Williams presently
    as Young joined him; &ldquo;I want to have a talk with you over that little
    matter&rdquo;; and he laughed coarsely, and by a gesture indicated his own
    dwelling.</p>
  <p>Young nodded, and Alrema saw the two men saunter off together along the
    cliffs. She had always disliked Williams, and thought he was in some way
    responsible for her husband&rsquo;s manner to herself, which had so altered
    of late. Passionately fond of, and fiercely jealous of him, her quick perception
    of the change in his conduct filled her with a vague, undefined alarm; and
    although as yet she did not doubt his loyalty, she had seen how his face
    brightened visibly whenever Mahina and her child came to visit them. Of Mahina
    herself she had no misgivings; but it seemed strange that whereas in former
    days she had always accompanied Young to Christian&rsquo;s house, he now
    frequently went there alone, although she had told him that Christian was
    in his cave. Mahina, too, seemed different, and her face wore a troubled,
    nervous look which her friend could not understand.</p>
  <p>After the birth of his second child Christian remained, for a time, constantly
    with his beautiful wife, whose face grew radiant with happiness. But soon
    his brooding mood returned to him in all its former force, and he resumed
    his lonely walks along the cliffs and spent his nights alone in his mountain
    cave. Mahina, Alrema knew, had long since resigned herself to her husband&rsquo;s
    fits of gloom, yet now she appeared more than ever a prey to melancholy.
    In some way Williams seemed to be connected with this, and Alrema noticed
    that whenever Young went to Christian&rsquo;s house Williams had preceded
    him there.</p>
  <p>Taking up her infant daughter in her arms, Alrema went outside and sat down
    under the shade of a breadfruit tree to wait her husband&rsquo;s return.
    For nearly an hour she amused herself playing with the child, till, overpowered
    by the soft, languorous morning air, she, pillowing her head upon a rolled-up
    mat, slept.</p>
  <p>The sun was high when she was awakened by hearing voices near. She at once
    recognised Williams&rsquo; harsh, and her husband&rsquo;s cool, quiet tones.
    As they talked they were passing through the breadfruit grove and stopped
    quite close to where she lay. Williams was speaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s understood. You stand by me and I&rsquo;ll stand
    by you. I&rsquo;m going to get the woman I want if I have to shoot every
    damned red-skinned savage on the island to get her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going in for anything like that,&rdquo; she heard her
    husband reply; &ldquo;I am quite content to wait till&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till that lunatic jumps over the cliffs and leaves a widow for you,&rdquo; said
    Williams, with a coarse laugh. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got more patience
    than me. If I wanted her I&rsquo;d make just as short a job of him as I mean
    to make of this Talalu. Anyway, I&rsquo;m going to set you a good example
    by taking another wife. Man alive! what are you afraid of? She&rsquo;ll be
    willing enough before long to come to you. She ain&rsquo;t the kind of woman
    to stay by herself while her husband leaves her to live in a cave. I daresay,&rdquo; he
    added, with another rude laugh, &ldquo;that Alrema would lend you a hand
    to talk her over. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d have made Faito do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An angry exclamation of dissent from Young, and Alrema heard him leave his
    companion and go towards the house. Then, her brain reeling with dreadful
    suspicions of the man she loved and the friend she trusted, she took up her
    sleeping infant and followed him.</p>
  <p>Williams, with a wicked look upon his evil face, strode away towards his
    own dwelling. He had managed to secure one of the best and most fertile portions
    of the nine lots into which the island was divided, and by his domineering
    conduct succeeded in making the islanders perform more labour in its cultivation
    than they expended upon any other of the mutineers&rsquo; land. As he drew
    near his plantation he saw the gigantic figure of Talalu and the slender,
    graceful form of Nahi, his gentle wife, moving about in the garden. They
    were building a low wall of coral stones to enclose the plantation, and Williams&rsquo;  eyes
    gleamed savagely as he saw Nahi, who had just placed a stone in position,
    look up at her husband&rsquo;s face with a smile, to which Talalu responded
    with an endearing expression and a loving caress.</p>
  <p>The white man stood for a while watching them. The woman&rsquo;s lithe,
    supple figure, her bared bosom and long mantle of black hair falling over
    her rounded shoulders fascinated and yet irritated his savage, sensuous nature. &ldquo;That
    fellow, that cursed, great hulking brute to possess such a woman! And he
    only a slave!&rdquo; He watched her white teeth gleam, as her lips parted
    in an admiring smile, when Talalu, raising a huge, jagged stone in his brawny
    arms, placed it lightly upon the smaller one her slender hands had lifted.</p>
  <p>Williams sat and waited. He knew that at noontime they would cease working
    for an hour to rest and wait upon him while he ate his mid-day meal. And
    then he meant to act.</p>
  <p>Presently, Talalu, glancing up at the sun, spoke to Nahi. They ceased their
    labours, and walked towards their own little dwelling of thatch. Outside
    stood a hollowed tree trunk filled with water. Then Williams saw Nahi, dropping
    the garment of tappa-cloth which encircled her waist, deftly replace it by
    a girdle of leaves, then her husband taking a cocoanut shell, dipped it into
    the water and poured it over her shoulders again and again to wash away the
    dust which stained her clear, bronzed skin. Nude to the hips, her lissome
    figure glinted and shone like a polished statue of metal in the bright morning
    sun, as the water ran down over her back, bosom, and legs, while her shapely
    arms were raised as she held up her glossy mantle of hair. Her bath finished,
    she took the coconut shell from her husband&rsquo;s hand and motioned him
    to stoop; but Talalu, with gentle, jesting rudeness, pushed her away, and
    filling the shell poured stream after stream of the cooling water over his
    own body.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last time you&rsquo;ll ever do that for her,&rdquo; said
    Williams to himself, as his lustful eyes revelled in the beauty of the girl&rsquo;s
    figure. He got up, went inside and threw himself upon his couch. They would
    be in presently, he knew, to bring him his dinner of yams, fish, and birds&rsquo; eggs.</p>
  <p>Nahi came first. In one hand she carried a platter of woven coconut leaves,
    upon which were a baked fish and some roasted breadfruit, in the other a
    young drinking coconut. Outside, Talalu, thrusting a pointed stake into the
    ground, began to husk some more nuts for the white man to drink.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Haeri mai</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Come here&rdquo;), his master called.</p>
  <p>The Tahitian&rsquo;s huge figure stood in the doorway, holding a half-husked
    coconut in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t do any work to-day, Talalu,&rdquo; said Williams,
    with a growl of apparent good nature. &ldquo;Tetihiti and Nihu are going
    out fishing for Kawintali (Quintal). You may go with them. Nahi can stay.
    Malama (Quintal&rsquo;s wife) will be here soon with her husband, and she
    can help Nahi to work upon the mat she is making for the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; answered the unsuspecting Tahitian, with a pleased smile; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    well, oh Iron-worker, that the mat be soon finished. Then will Nahi and I
    carry up many baskets of fine pebbles, so that the mat may rest flat and
    even on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May you be lucky in your fishing,&rdquo; called Nahi, as her husband,
    a minute later, passed the door, carrying his basket of fishing tackle. Then,
    the white man&rsquo;s meal being in readiness, she took up a fan and stood
    by him while he ate.</p>
  <p>For some minutes he ate his food in silence, then motioned to the woman
    to come nearer. She obeyed him with a timid glance, and a slight tremor quivered
    her bare shoulders for a moment.</p>
  <p>Suddenly Williams pushed his stool back from the table. Fixing his eyes
    on Nahi&rsquo;s expectant face, he said to her in English&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nahi, my girl, I&rsquo;ve always had a fancy for you, and I want
    you. You&rsquo;re going to be my new wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a look of wild terror she shrank back, her hands covering her face.
    The next instant the man seized her by the wrists.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, now, none of that, Nahi! I&rsquo;m going to have you for my
    wife, so don&rsquo;t be a fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; she pleaded in Tahitian; &ldquo;how can I be wife
    to thee? Am I not wife to Talalu? &rsquo;Tis but a poor jest to so frighten
    a weak woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laughed fiercely. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no jest. Thou art my desire and I
    will have thee. As for thy husband&mdash;&rdquo; he made a contemptuous gesture.</p>
  <p>The woman&rsquo;s eyes blazed. She tore her hands from his grasp and faced
    him. &ldquo;Thou coward! He is better than thou art. He is of chief&rsquo;s
    blood&mdash;thou but a slave in thine own land,&rdquo; and with a sudden
    spring she bounded through the open doorway and ran swiftly in the direction
    of the other white men&rsquo;s houses.</p>
  <p>With panting bosom and gasping breath she reached Christian&rsquo;s house
    and darted inside. Mahina was seated on the matted floor crooning to her
    youngest child; Christian, as usual, was away at his cave.</p>
  <p>Shaking with fear and anger, Nahi, generally so calm and gentle, flung herself
    at Mahina&rsquo;s feet and wept.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is this, friend of my heart?&rdquo; asked Mahina, laying her
    infant down and drawing the girl&rsquo;s head upon her lap. She listened
    in grave silence until Nahi had finished her story, which ended in an earnest
    appeal. &ldquo;Kirisiani,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;was strong and powerful,
    and none of the white men dared face his anger. Surely he would not let the
    Iron-worker do this wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The white men, I fear, care little what becomes of us of Tahiti now,&rdquo; said
    Mahina sadly; &ldquo;yet will we go to my husband and tell him thy trouble.
    Still do I fear that he will not heed thee; and then indeed must thou go
    to the Iron-worker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nahi wept silently; when she ceased Mahina sought to comfort her, telling
    her that if the Iron-worker succeeded in taking her away from Talalu it would
    not be her fault&mdash;she would but yield to circumstances.</p>
  <p>The woman turned her tear-stained face to Mahina in open wonder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What! Hast thou no other words of comfort for me than these? Put
    thyself in my place. How can I do this wrong to the man I love&mdash;he who
    hath toiled and fought for me? Wouldst thou so wrong <i>thy</i> husband as
    to listen to words of love from another man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My husband!&rdquo;&mdash;Mahina laughed bitterly. &ldquo;Little does
    he care if other men speak words of love to me. His heart is dead, and I
    am but a leaf in his path.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Nahi gently, placing her hands on her friend&rsquo;s
    shoulder, &ldquo;thy Kirisiani hath still a true heart for thee. He is not
    as these low-blooded dogs of sailors. He is an <i>arii</i> (a chief) of the
    same blood as Tuti; and the sailors fear him. Come then, dear friend, and
    join thy voice with mine, so that he may save me from the Iron-worker, whom
    I hate and fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We will go, Nahi. Yet hope for nothing. Kirisiani&rsquo;s love for
    us, which was once so strong and hot, has grown cold. For me, who would give
    my life for his, he cares naught. But a little while ago, when my babe was
    born, he was kind to me and sat by my side here when the sun sank in the
    sea, and let his hand rest in mine.&rdquo; Her soft voice trembled in mournful
    pathos. &ldquo;But again the black thoughts came to him, and he left me to
    return to his cave. He careth for me no longer. Yet will we go and pray him
    to protect thee from this evil man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In an hour the two women reached Christian&rsquo;s cave at the furthest
    extremity of the island. It opened from a high ridge of black, jagged, and
    almost inaccessible rocks. Near by was a tiny cascade, leaping noisily from
    ledge to ledge as it coursed towards the valley.</p>
  <p>From its situation the cave commanded an extensive view of the horizon round
    the whole island, and its occupant would see a sail long before any one else
    on Pitcairn could discern it. Approach was so difficult that, even if a large
    party succeeded in crossing the dizzy, narrow ledge of rocks connecting it
    with the mountain spur beneath, Christian could have shot every one of them
    before they were within a hundred feet of his refuge.</p>
  <p>As they passed through the little settlement on their mission, the two women
    called at the other houses, and told the story of Williams&rsquo; design.
    Just as they reached the ridge they heard some one following them, and looking
    back saw the stalwart figure of Smith, who had come to help them in gaining
    Christian&rsquo;s assistance. Behind him came Young.</p>
  <p>As the sound of their voices ascended to the heights, they saw Christian
    emerge from the cave. He was dressed in shirt and trousers only, and his
    long black hair hung, loose and neglected, about his shoulders. For a few
    moments he regarded them without speaking; then as Mahina in a timid voice
    said they desired to talk to him, he descended the ridge to meet them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why is this?&rdquo; he asked sullenly, with an angry look at each
    in turn; &ldquo;am I to have no peace, no rest? Can I not live alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith&rsquo;s honest, open face flushed deeply, but he said nothing; the
    women should speak first, he thought, then he would try.</p>
  <p>Nahi, in a trembling voice, told her story, and sobbingly besought his help,
    and Mahina joined her in her earnest entreaties.</p>
  <p>He heard them through in moody silence, and turned to Smith. &ldquo;From
    the time of our landing here, on this cursed rock, I have avoided all interference
    with any of you. You have made slaves of these Tahitians, who are better
    than any white man on the island except yourself and Young. If they retaliate
    upon you, it will be your own faults. I don&rsquo;t say that you and Young
    are like the rest; but yet you have permitted those scoundrels, McCoy, Quintal,
    Mills, and Williams to oppress these unfortunate people. Still, I will make
    one more effort for the common good, and try to dissuade this ruffian from
    stealing Talalu&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well spoken, Mr. Christian,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;By God! sir,
    I&rsquo;ll not see Talalu wronged in this fashion if you&rsquo;ll help me;
    and I dare swear Mr. Young will join us in clapping a stopper on his game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Accompanied by Nahi and Mahina, the three men returned to the settlement.
    As they walked, Young tried to speak to Mahina in a whisper, but with a nervous
    look she quickened her pace and caught up to her husband, who was in advance
    of them all.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
    The Quarrel</b></h2>
  <p>When they reached the settlement, they found nearly all the little community
    assembled outside the large storehouse.</p>
  <p>Williams himself was not among them, neither was Talalu; but Lunalio, a
    Raiatean girl, the wife of Martin, whispered to Nahi that he was coming.
    A look of joy overspread Nahi&rsquo;s face. She knew Williams&rsquo; savage
    disposition and feared that Talalu had met with some treachery as he returned
    with his companions from fishing. And, indeed, Williams, with a loaded musket
    in his hand, had taken up his position behind a rock on the path leading
    up from the cliffs, intending to shoot the unsuspecting man as he ascended.
    But it so happened that Talalu, instead of taking the mountain track, came
    with his companions along the wider and more frequented path leading directly
    to the storehouse; and the white man, hiding his musket among the rocks,
    had waited till the natives were out of sight, and then followed them. A
    quarter of an hour later he sauntered coolly towards the assembled people,
    and the babble of excited tongues told him that the Tahitians were discussing
    with the whites his intention to appropriate Nahi.</p>
  <p>A dead silence ensued the moment he made his appearance. Standing in front
    of the storehouse were the white men, most of them armed with muskets and
    cutlasses. Whether they were for or against him Williams could not for the
    moment tell, but he had no doubt of the feelings of the islanders, whose
    dark eyes blazed with hatred. A little apart from the rest of them stood
    Talalu, in his hand a keen-edged turtle-spear, and with a look of suppressed
    fury upon his face.</p>
  <p>Squaring his shoulders, and placing his hands jauntily upon his hips, Williams
    bade the white men a mocking good-day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite a little gathering, I see. Ain&rsquo;t I got an invitation,
    or didn&rsquo;t you think my company good enough? Are you talking about me?&rdquo; and
    he shot a fierce glance at Fletcher Christian, who regarded him with unmoved
    features.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We <i>are</i> talking about you, Williams,&rdquo; said Christian
    quietly, stepping out from the other white men. &ldquo;What are you trying
    to do with this man&rsquo;s wife? For the peace of our little community&mdash;for
    God&rsquo;s sake&mdash;think before you go further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine, Mr. Christian,&rdquo; he answered rudely, &ldquo;but &rsquo;tis
    hard if I can&rsquo;t do as I choose with my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian looked at him contemptuously. &ldquo;Your own! What right have
    you to speak of this woman Nahi as yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are you to question my right? You are not an officer of the <i>Bounty</i> now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian&rsquo;s face paled at the insulting words, but he restrained himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not ask you as a right, Williams, but as a favour, not to attempt
    this thing. I am sure every man but yourself sees that you will rue it if
    you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is what I told him long ago,&rdquo; broke in Quintal, who, rude
    and overbearing as he was in some respects to the Tahitians, was never tyrannical,
    and often tried to check Williams&rsquo; brutality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say this, Quintal,&rdquo; said Christian. &ldquo;Williams
    does not seem to know what it is he contemplates.&rdquo; His eye fell upon
    the stalwart figure of Talalu, who with gleaming eyes and clenched hands
    was looking at the persecutor of his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come here, Talalu,&rdquo; said Christian.</p>
  <p>The islander looked at him for a moment; then thrusting the barbed point
    of his turtle-spear into the ground, he walked slowly over to the white man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it thou wouldst say to me, Kirisiani?&rdquo; he asked in
    deep, guttural tones, which quivered with passion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; and Fletcher Christian&rsquo;s voice rang out loud and
    clear, as he pointed contemptuously to Williams&mdash; &ldquo;this do I say.
    This Williams the Iron-worker is but a poor, uncultured slave, who knows
    naught that is good, and the evil in his heart hath killed all knowledge
    of what is right and just. I pray thee have patience with him, and we will
    try to teach him better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the hell do you mean?&rdquo; asked Williams savagely, who understood
    Tahitian sufficiently well to know what Christian had said. &ldquo;What sort
    of talk is this? Do you mean to tell this cursed, naked savage that he is
    a better man than I am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better than you! By heavens, you ruffian, you are a thousand times
    more of a savage than he? And I, who am to blame for bringing such men as
    him from their homes and exposing them to the danger of contact with such
    sweepings of the hulks as you are, will take care you do him or his countrymen
    no more wrong than you have done already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, Mr. Christian, don&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; said Brown. &ldquo;Williams
    is as good a man as any of us, and I don&rsquo;t see why you should aggravate
    him by such words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn such talk, I say,&rdquo; said Mills insolently, walking apart
    from the others and standing beside Williams, &ldquo;if the man wants the
    woman, let him have her. He ain&rsquo;t got a wife, and you can&rsquo;t expect
    a white man to go without one when one can be had for the taking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Talalu turned upon him. &ldquo;I will kill him or any other man who tries
    to take my wife from me,&rdquo; he muttered with set lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None of that, my fine fellow,&rdquo; said Brown in English. &ldquo;Take
    care what you say about killing people. You will find that we can do some
    killing if we are put to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Williams looked at Christian with rage and hatred in his face. &ldquo;What
    do you think of it now, Mr. Christian? Am I to do as I like and as my ship-mates
    want me to, or are you going to join with these damned savages and try to
    stop me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you plainly what I will do, Williams. I will protect
    these people at the hazard of my life; and though I stand alone I will prevent
    this outrage, even if I fight the whole lot of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is mad to say this,&rdquo; whispered Edward Young to Mahina, as
    he pressed her hand, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; and he gave her a meaning look, &ldquo;for
    your sake, Mahina, I will stand by him.&rdquo; Then he stepped out and stood
    beside her husband, and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not stand alone, Mr. Christian, while I am here. While
    I don&rsquo;t altogether agree with you, I don&rsquo;t believe in Williams
    taking the woman against her will. Let us come to some arrangement about
    her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, too, am with you, sir!&rdquo; cried Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I!&rdquo; &ldquo;And I!&rdquo; echoed Quintal and McCoy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, my lads,&rdquo; said Christian; &ldquo;I knew there were
    some among us with a sense of justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Williams looked at the four men one after another and folded his brawny
    arms across his tattooed chest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he sneered; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not going to be
    any fighting over this. But you can make certain of one thing. If you won&rsquo;t
    give me my own way in this matter you may go to hell, the whole lot of you,
    before I&rsquo;ll sweat at the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> forge making tools for
    these cursed savages to till your ground. And yet, by God! I&rsquo;ll get
    my own way all the same in the end!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he walked away towards his house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trouble will come of this, mark my words, Mr. Christian,&rdquo; said
    Brown. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a pity you should in-interfere with the man. You&rsquo;ll
    find he&rsquo;ll have the woman in spite of you, never fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then his life will pay the penalty,&rdquo; answered Christian fiercely.  &ldquo;You
    do not seem to understand, Brown, that while a single girl may be taken by
    force sometimes the marriage-tie among the Tahitians is held as sacred as
    among civilised people. But I think Talalu will take care of his wife, and
    there are three or four men who will help him to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, with a few words of farewell to the islanders who thronged around
    him with protestations of gratitude, he turned quickly away with Mahina by
    his side.</p>
  <p>Before they had gone a hundred yards they heard some one running after them,
    and Nahi, flinging herself on the ground before Christian, clasped her arms
    around his knees and kissed his feet, wetting them with tears of gratitude.</p>
  <p>That night Williams cooked and ate his supper alone, for Talalu and Nahi
    had taken shelter in the house of Tairoa-Maina, the Tubuaian chief.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
    The Revolt of Talalu</b></h2>
  <p>For three days nothing happened. The people of Pitcairn, white and brown,
    went about their daily occupations as usual, but there was a suppressed excitement
    and an ominous calmness that augured ill for the future, and the rift between
    the two parties&mdash;those who sided with Christian, and those who supported
    Williams&mdash;widened slowly but surely.</p>
  <p>Ever since the day of the quarrel the islanders had been sulky and suspicious
    in their manner to all the white men except Christian and Smith. Young, although
    openly declared as Christian&rsquo;s <i>taio</i> or friend, they regarded
    with distrust, even though Alrema, doubtful as she was beginning to feel
    of her husband&rsquo;s loyalty to herself, strove to persuade them of his
    goodwill towards them.</p>
  <p>To them Christian had always been a fair and just man, refusing to recognise
    any distinction between them and his white comrades. They would have fought
    for and followed him to the death had occasion arisen for the sacrifice.</p>
  <p>Tairoa-Maina and the other Tubuaians, being unmarried, lived by themselves
    in a separate house, and thither went Talalu and his gentle wife for refuge
    for the time being from the savage Williams. Fearing to remain much longer
    near his former master, Talalu determined to build himself a new house among
    the mountains in a secluded little valley about half a mile lower down than
    Christian&rsquo;s cave. Every morning, axe on shoulder, accompanied by Nahi,
    he set out to work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will live like Kirisiani,&rdquo; he said, when his countrymen asked
    him why he desired to leave them; &ldquo;even as he lives so will I. These
    white men are bad masters; no longer will I work for them like a slave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On the fourth morning after the quarrel, Williams rose from his bunk and
    began to make preparations for his breakfast. The fertility of the island
    was such that this gave him little labour. In his house were supplies of
    breadfruit, yams, and bananas, and overhead on the cross-beams hung strings
    of dried fish. In addition to these he had his share of the stores from the <i>Bounty</i>,
    such as wine, biscuit, rice, and salted pork, but his extravagance had left
    him but little of the meat, and he uttered a savage curse when on lifting
    the little two-gallon wine keg he found it empty. To procure more meant a
    walk to the storehouse, some distance away; and before he could get the wine
    he would have to ask Quintal, who, by common consent, was in charge of all
    the stores that remained. He had always been accustomed to drink wine with
    his food, and the loss of it annoyed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If that cursed Talalu had been here,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;this
    wouldn&rsquo;t have happened. What right had the fellow to clear out, and
    take his wife with him too? And the breadfruit and yams were cold. If Nahi
    were here they would have been heated for him. Curse them both, the damned
    copper-hided savages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As he ate he worked himself into a state of savage fury. What right had
    that fellow to have such a handsome woman as Nahi for his wife? If he were
    out of the way she wouldn&rsquo;t make such a fuss; would no doubt be proud
    to become the wife of a white man. Damn that fine-talking fellow, Christian!
    Only for him the thing would have been done. Brown and Mills would have stood
    by if Talalu made a noise about his wife being taken. By God! he&rsquo;d
    stand it no longer. He&rsquo;d bring the pair of them back to work at once.</p>
  <p>His eye caught his musket, hanging on brackets over his bunk. He took it
    down, loaded it, and then walked rapidly away in the direction of the house
    occupied by Talalu and his wife.</p>
  <p>With murder in his heart he reached the dwelling of Tairoa-Maina. Neither
    the chief nor his two countrymen were visible, but Talalu and Nahi were at
    work in the garden at the back. They were digging yams, and the white man
    watched them in sullen silence for a few minutes. Every movement of the woman&rsquo;s
    graceful figure angered him against her husband. What was he? A slave; a
    cursed savage. A man who had no right to possess a beautiful wife. He would
    not only have the woman, but make the man work for him as well.</p>
  <p>Creeping along the wall of coral stones that enclosed the garden, he reached
    a spot not twenty yards from them. Then he stood up and covered the man with
    his musket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come back with me, you two,&rdquo; he called fiercely, in Tahitian; &ldquo;if
    you don&rsquo;t come outside at once, I&rsquo;ll kill the pair of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nahi, with heart full of love, threw herself before her husband, but Talalu
    said something to her in a low voice, and she turned and faced the white
    man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even as thou wilt, master,&rdquo; replied Talalu quietly, and taking
    Nahi&rsquo;s hand he came outside the wall.</p>
  <p>With his gun over his shoulder the white man followed them, triumphantly
    smiling to himself at this proof of his power of command.</p>
  <p>Very quietly they walked before him, till they reached his house, then entered
    it, and Nahi seated herself upon the matted floor.</p>
  <p>Williams stood in the doorway for a moment, regarding them with a smile
    of victory. He intended to let them feel their position at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a damned good mind to give you a lacing, Mister Talalu,&rdquo; he
    said in English, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll put it off for a bit and give you
    another chance. But I want something to eat. You, Nahi, go to Kawintali and
    ask him for some rice and wine and salted meat; and you, Talalu&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He never spoke again. The Tahitian sprang upon him like a tiger, seized
    his throat with both hands, and squeezing his windpipe, forced him to the
    ground. For a minute they struggled fiercely, but the white man, though strong
    and active, was but as a child in the giant&rsquo;s grasp. They swayed to
    and fro a little, and then Williams lay upon the ground with the brown man&rsquo;s
    knee upon his chest, making feeble efforts to free himself from the grasp
    of death.</p>
  <p>Presently he ceased to struggle, and was only conscious enough to know that
    all hope was gone and his time was come. One glance from his bloodshot eyes
    into the death-dealing face of the man above him told him that.</p>
  <p>For a little while the Tahitian relaxed his hold. Beside him, her eyes dilated
    with triumphant hatred, Nahi bent over the prostrate figure, all the bitterness
    of the past reflected in her dark face. She had watched the struggle with
    a sense of victory. Who in the old days at Matavai could vie with Talalu
    in wrestling? And when she saw the huge form of her husband bear the slighter
    figure of their joint oppressor to the earth, she laughed.</p>
  <p>With the foam of the agony of death flecking his lips, and breathing in
    awful, fitful gasps, Williams lay before them, one hand of Talalu still gripping
    his throat. The musket lay upon the floor beside the men. Williams had carried
    it at full cock, and the priming had been spilt when he dropped it to meet
    the onslaught of Talalu.</p>
  <p>Still keeping his hand upon the sailor&rsquo;s throat Talalu turned to his
    wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take thou the powder horn and prime the gun,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>She took the horn from the peg upon which it hung and did as he told her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now put the end of the gun to this dog&rsquo;s temple.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She dropped upon one knee and pressed the muzzle of the gun to William&rsquo;s
    dark forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now pull the little piece of iron,&rdquo; said Talalu, &ldquo;and
    let his black soul depart unto the land of evil spirits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a flash and the heavy musket-ball dashed out the wretched man&rsquo;s
    brains, ploughed through the matted floor, and scattered the coral pebbles
    in a white shower against the furthest side of the house. Then Talalu, with
    bloodied right hand, rose to his feet and stood regarding the body of his
    enemy.</p>
  <p>Picking up the lifeless form of Williams, the Tahitian motioned to his wife
    to follow, and walked towards the cliffs to the same place where, a few months
    before, he had seen the wife of the dead man fall.</p>
  <p>Standing on the jagged cliff edge, he looked down. Far below him lay the
    rough, pebbly beach upon which Faito had fallen and dyed the stones with
    her blood. Then he raised the white man high in his mighty arms and cast
    him over with a bitter curse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lie there, thou who slew thy wife with cruel words, and would have
    stolen mine,&rdquo; he cried, as he dashed the body upon the stones.</p>
  <p>He looked down a while longer at his dead enemy, and then, taking Nahi&rsquo;s
    hand in his own, turned homewards.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
    Nahi&rsquo;s Message</b></h2>
  <p>The report of the gun which killed Talalu&rsquo;s oppressor was heard by
    all who happened to be in their houses at the time. Each thought it was but
    a shot fired at some ocean bird winging its way seaward from one of the many
    islands rookeries, and no one imagined that it was the beginning of a fatal
    and bloody epoch in the history of their island home.</p>
  <p>But Talalu, as he returned with his wife by his side, knew that his deed
    would bring forth great things in the near future, and set himself to prepare
    for whatever might happen.</p>
  <p>Half-way between the cliffs and his own dwelling, he stopped and spoke to
    Nahi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hasten, oh pearl of my heart, to the houses of all our countrymen
    and to that of Tairoa-Maina the Tubuaian, and bid them come to me. And this
    shalt thou say to them: &lsquo;Talalu sendeth greeting and saith that &ldquo;The
    sun hath risen a bloody red; and the white men will seek for revenge for
    what hath been done.&rdquo; Talalu saith also &ldquo;The hand to the club,
    for death cometh swiftly and suddenly to men unprepared.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh husband with the strong hand and brave heart, why should&rsquo;st
    thou fear? The white men are just, and will not harm thee for killing the
    Iron-worker, that man of evil heart and cruel will. If I give this message
    of thine, will not they think that all the men of our race are plotting to
    slay them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The giant Tahitian placed his bloodstained hand upon his wife&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Do
    as I bid thee. I tell thee the white men will not forgive me the death of
    the Iron-worker. And it is well that we be prepared for their wrath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; pleaded Nahi, &ldquo;surely Kirisiani and Etuati and
    Simeti are our friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; answered Talalu bitterly. &ldquo;Who can tell?
    Hast thou not seen that they have no faith in each other? Dost thou not know
    that Etuati, whom I once thought the true <i>taio</i> of Kirisiani, hath
    spoken words of love to Mahina his wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is but the custom of our country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Talalu interrupted&mdash; &ldquo;Thou dost not know, Nahi, that this our
    custom of <i>taio</i> is held in abhorrence by men of chief&rsquo;s rank
    and blood in Peretane, such as Etuati and Kirisiani. Often hath Kirisiani
    told me, when speaking of the customs of white men, that for a man to cast
    the eye of desire upon the wife of his friend is counted shame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She bent her head in mute obedience to her husband&rsquo;s will. Surely
    Talalu her husband, who was for ever talking to the white men of the customs
    of their country, knew what was right.</p>
  <p>So she sped quickly away, first to the house of Tairoa-Maina, and there
    told the Tubuaians of Williams&rsquo; death and gave her husband&rsquo;s
    message.</p>
  <p>Without waiting to be questioned, she added&mdash; &ldquo;And see, oh men
    of Tubuai, that ye bring with ye guns and powder and lead; for even as my
    husband sayeth the sun hath risen a bloody red.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then leaving the wondering and excited Tubuaians she went to the hut of
    the Tahitians and gave the same warning. As she passed from house to house
    the wives of the white men saw her and sought to question her, but she evaded
    them and disappeared among the boscage of the mountain forest towards the
    dwelling of Mahina and her husband.</p>
  <p>Through the open doorway of the house she saw the figures of Alrema and
    Mahina. They were seated together preparing their morning meal, and Christian&rsquo;s
    two children played beside them.</p>
  <p>Panting with excitement, Nahi threw herself upon the couch at the further
    end of the room and asked for a drink. Alrema opened a young coconut and
    and brought it to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why dost thou breathe so hard, my friend?&rdquo; she said with a
    laugh.  &ldquo;Drink and then come eat with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nahi drank, but refused to eat. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well that I have met thee
    here, Alrema.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Something in her face made them rise quickly and asked what brought her.</p>
  <p>She laughed nervously. &ldquo;Listen thou, Alrema, wife of Etuati, and thou
    Mahina, wife of Kirisiani the chief. My husband hath slain the Iron-worker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mahina, with a cry of fear, clasped her infant in her arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, he slew him with his own gun, because he sought to take me.
    And when the fire leapt from the mouth of the gun, and the lead dashed out
    his brains, Talalu took up his body and carried it upon his shoulders to
    the cliffs and cast it upon the stones where Faito died. And this message
    hath my husband sent to the men of Tahiti and Tubuai &lsquo;The sun hath
    risen a bloody red; be prepared.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>The two others exchanged a quick responsive glance of alarm, but Nahi, excited
    as she was, did not notice it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But thou must not tell Tahinia, nor Malama, nor Lunalio, nor any
    of the women who have white husbands. Even of thee, friends of my heart,
    was I frightened, but I remembered that thy husbands have ever been of kind
    hearts to us of Tahiti. Did not thine, Alrema, and thine, Mahina, and the
    husband of Terere seek to save me from the dog whom my husband hath slain?
    And for that shall no harm come to them or to thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mahina, with a terrified glance at the exultant face of Nahi, turned appealingly
    to Alrema. What should she do to warn Christian? He was in his cave. Perhaps
    in his lonely morning walk along the cliffs he might meet some of her countrymen
    who, never thinking of all that he had done for their welfare, might shoot
    or spear him.</p>
  <p>Fearful for their husbands, Mahina and Alrema saw the lithe figure of Nahi
    glide away into the darkness from Christian&rsquo;s lonely dwelling. Despite
    the knowledge that Young was wavering in his loyalty to her, his wife still
    loved him passionately, and never felt anything but friendship for Mahina;
    so, urging her to go to Christian and warn him of the impending trouble,
    she set out in search of Young, who had gone fishing for the night. And Mahina,
    leading one child by the hand and pressing the other to her bosom, walked
    quickly along the rocky path towards the cave.</p>
  <p>A strange silence already seemed to deaden the clear morning air. Soon after
    the first rosy flush of dawn had changed the grey of the wooded mountain
    sides to a living green, Matthew Quintal, gun in hand, came along the path
    from his house towards the cliffs, wondering why he had met none of the brown
    men on their way to their work in the white men&rsquo;s gardens. He was going
    towards a great <i>toa</i> tree which grew in a little valley near Martin&rsquo;s
    house, where at early morning many frigate birds roosted, for he had promised
    Malama to shoot some for her, and wanted Isaac Martin to join him.</p>
  <p>But ere he came in sight of the shipmate&rsquo;s house Martin met him. His
    thin, sallow face wore an anxious look, and to Quintal&rsquo;s surprise he
    carried a pistol and cutlass as well as a musket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was going to look for you, Mat,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there is
    something in the wind. One of the Tahiti men was here a little while ago
    telling my wife that Talalu had killed Jack Williams. Didn&rsquo;t you know
    it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied Quintal with a startled exclamation and look of
    alarm. &ldquo;What had we better do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us go and tell the others. There&rsquo;s going to be fighting,
    I can see. Every one of those fellows thinks a lot of Talalu, and as far
    as I can make out only we two know that Williams is dead. We&rsquo;ll find
    them all working at Young&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
    Alrema&rsquo;s Song</b></h2>
  <p>Young was building a new storehouse upon his ground, and thither went the
    two men. As soon as they emerged from the forest path upon Young&rsquo;s
    clearing they could see him with Smith and Brown at work.</p>
  <p>None of the Tahitians had appeared to assist them, and the three men were
    discussing the cause of their absence. Young, who had been fishing in the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> boat
    all night off the south end of the island, was in a bad temper. He had been
    obliged to land at an inconvenient spot through the sea rising suddenly,
    and on returning home just after daylight found that Alrema was away. Such
    an unusual occurrence mystified and irritated him; for how could he know
    that the loving girl had waited at the usual landing-place in Bounty Bay
    till past daylight, and then returned home, unhappy and anxious at the absence
    of her husband?</p>
  <p>But as Quintal and Martin came walking quickly along towards Young and his
    companions, Alrema appeared on the path, far in advance of them. She was
    followed closely by the wives of two of the Tahitians, who were plainly watching
    her movements.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beware, Alrema,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;we know why thou
    hast come here. Talalu hath done no wrong, and our husbands will stand by
    him if it cometh to the shedding of blood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; fiercely said the other, a short, powerful woman, whose
    long hair, wetted with the morning dew that had fallen on her head as she
    came through the narrow forest path, hung black and lustreless upon her brown,
    naked shoulders, &ldquo;and I, Toaa, will strike this knife into thy heart
    if thou goest nearer to the white men,&rdquo; and she showed Alrema a short
    broad-bladed dagger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye fools,&rdquo; answered Alrema contemptuously, &ldquo;can I not
    labour in my husband&rsquo;s garden without listening to thy silly threats?
    What doth it concern me that Talalu hath killed the Iron-worker? Stay me
    not, I tell thee. I have but come to dig yams for our morning meal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without further words she entered the walled enclosure, apparently taking
    no heed of the three white men who were now talking earnestly together. She
    meant to tell them of their danger, but how to do so with the two women close
    beside her she knew not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, you two, come and help Alrema to dig yams,&rdquo; called out
    Young angrily in English to the other women. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make some
    of you work for me to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fearing to disobey, they silently followed Alrema, and began to assist her
    in her labours; and as they worked Alrema sang. Sweet, clear, and loud her
    voice rang out in the morning air, and the white men looked at one another
    in surprise, for at the end of the first verse she added in English another
    line.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen to my singing, white men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two Tahitian women near her looked up suspiciously. Unlike Alrema, who
    now spoke the white men&rsquo;s language with perfect fluency, they barely
    understood a dozen words of English. Still they kept close and Toaa watched
    Young&rsquo;s wife narrowly. With apparent composure she went on with her
    song&mdash;one of the old Tahitian love songs, half recitative but full of
    melody, and presently noticed that Young and the other men had drawn nearer,
    and were listening, though with apparent unconcern.</p>
  <p>The second verse told how a girl of Raiatea, pursuing a phantom lover, journeyed
    over sea and land moon after moon, till she sank faint and dying under a
    grove of coconut trees on the beach of an unknown land, whither her quest
    had led her.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;So she lay there faint and dying;<br>
    Bloodied were her cinnet sandals<br>
    With her journey long and weary;<br>
    And her eyes were raised above her<br>
    At the young nuts, thick in clusters,<br>
    Growing close, yet far beyond her;<br>
    For her hands, too weak to reach them,<br>
    Bruised and bleeding<br>
Lay upon her aching bosom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a swift glance at the white men she changed into English.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Listen, white men, to my singing;<br>
    Dead is Williams, Iron-worker;<br>
    He was killed at early morning,<br>
Know you not the man who slew him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God! Do you hear that?&rdquo; said Young.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sh! wait a bit, she&rsquo;ll tell us more presently,&rdquo; whispered
    Smith; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you see she&rsquo;s afraid of the other women?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again Alrema&rsquo;s bird-like notes went back into Tahitian. Striking her
    spade into the ground as she sang&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;And the heavens swirled about her,<br>
    With her pain, and thirst, and hunger;<br>
    But her heart kept calling, calling,<br>
For the lover who had mocked her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She raised the end of a yam from the rich black soil, turned round and placed
    it in a basket behind her; then her voice, quivering yet strong, took up
    in English the thread of warning to the listening white men.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Do you hear me? Understand me?<br>
    Go away and get your muskets;<br>
    All the brown men now are arming,<br>
    Arming so that they may kill you;<br>
Go away and warn the others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art a vain fool,&rdquo; said the woman Toa&#257; to her in a
    tone of contempt; &ldquo;dost thou think to charm the ears of our masters
    with thy croaking voice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alrema tried to laugh good-naturedly, and again went on with the Tahitian
    love-song. The women, however, she feared suspected her, and she sang
    the next verse quickly, while Young, Brown, and Smith with bated breath listened
    for her next words in English.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;See these women working with me,<br>
    They suspect me, they will kill me,<br>
    If they know I give you warning.<br>
    Go away and tell the others,<br>
Leave me here to follow quickly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By heavens, that&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; whispered Young to his companions. &ldquo;Let
    us get away as quickly as possible. My wife&rsquo;s warning is clear enough.
    We must go and tell the others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Quintal and Martin coming down the ridge now,&rdquo; said
    Brown.  &ldquo;They seem to know what&rsquo;s up, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go and meet them,&rdquo; replied Young hurriedly, &ldquo;and tell
    them to wait till Smith and I come. We must not let these women know that
    we have any suspicion of what is wrong; listen, do you hear that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alrema was singing again in English, and telling them she was sure the two
    women had been sent to get powder and ball from Williams&rsquo; house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Off you go, Brown, but don&rsquo;t walk too quickly. Tell Quintal
    and Martin that Smith and I will be with them in a minute or two. Then slip
    through the breadfruit grove to Williams&rsquo; house, and get all his ammunition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Presently Alrema saw with satisfaction that Brown was sauntering away, and
    as soon as he was out of sight Young and Smith came over to where the women
    were working.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are going to McCoy&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said he, addressing Alrema
    quietly; &ldquo;you can stay here and cook us some yams.&rdquo; Then with
    sudden severity he turned to Toaa and the other woman. &ldquo;As for you
    two, stay here and dig till we return, or &rsquo;twill be worse for your
    backs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They gave him sullen glances in reply and muttered acquiescence. Smith and
    Young left the garden and went to join Quintal and Martin, but the moment
    they were out of the women&rsquo;s sight they ran, and soon reached the other
    white men.</p>
  <p>For some minutes the three women worked on in silence. Alrema picked up
    her basket of yams, and was moving towards the house when Toaa called her
    back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whither goest thou?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh fool and dull of hearing,&rdquo; Alrema replied coolly. &ldquo;Didst
    you not hear my husband tell me to cook these yams? I haste to do his bidding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou liest,&rdquo; said Toaa fiercely; &ldquo;thou hast told him
    something in thy cunning song,&rdquo; and she sprang at her, knife in hand.</p>
  <p>But Alrema, by an agile movement, escaped the savage thrust, and, seeing
    that it was now too late for concealment, leapt over the low stone wall of
    the garden and fled swiftly after her husband.</p>
  <p>With Young leading the way, the three white men ran quickly towards the
    houses of the other Europeans. In a few minutes they were overtaken by Brown,
    who reported that Williams&rsquo; house was in the possession of Talalu and
    his friends, and consequently he had not dared attempt to enter it. By the
    time they reached the summit of the rise overlooking the rest of the houses,
    they were joined by Alrema, who had cleverly returned unobserved to her husband&rsquo;s
    house, fearing that Young had not secured all the arms there. This, however,
    he had done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Christian?&rdquo; asked Young, as they gained the top of
    the hill and stopped to draw breath for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In his cave,&rdquo; answered Martin, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s no use
    waiting for him. Alrema says that Mahina has gone to call him. He&rsquo;ll
    be with us presently. What are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a hurried consultation, and it was quickly resolved that Talalu
    must be taken prisoner and punished.</p>
  <p>As they talked they were joined by McCoy, Christian, and Mahina. Christian
    unconsciously assumed the leadership, and after deciding upon their plan
    of action they proceeded in a body towards Williams&rsquo; house, determined
    at all risks to quell the revolt which was threatening their safety.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
  &ldquo;His Heart&rsquo;s Desire&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>In less than half an hour the white men reached the low stone wall enclosing
    Williams&rsquo; house and garden, and saw that the door of his dwelling was
    closed; but the two unglazed windows were opened, and from them half a dozen
    brown, excited faces peered out upon the Europeans. Each native held a musket
    at full cock, along the barrel of which his eye glanced.</p>
  <p>Suddenly Christian stopped, and help up his hand to the white men who followed
    him. Then grounding his musket he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have come with you, because on the spur of the moment I thought
    it my duty to make common cause with men of my own colour against a common
    danger. I forgot that this man Williams deserved his fate. He was a thorough-paced
    scoundrel, and has met, I have no doubt, his just deserts. Therefore, I will
    take no part in this affair; settle it yourselves. I leave it to you to consider,
    before you harm Talalu, what you may bring upon yourselves by becoming his
    murderers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Walking away from his surprised and angry fellow-countrymen, he sat down
    quietly upon the wall and waited to see what would happen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Edward Young contemptuously, &ldquo;if you
    won&rsquo;t stand by us in a matter like this we must do without you. For
    the sake of my wife and child I will not let this fellow escape punishment.
    You, it is easy to see, care naught for yours,&rdquo; and he glanced quickly
    at Mahina, who stood near.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right, Mr. Young,&rdquo; said Quintal; &ldquo;you lead us and we&rsquo;ll
    follow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Telling the rest of the white men to stand back, Young advanced close to
    the house and called to Talalu that he wished to speak to him.</p>
  <p>The heavy wooden door swung open, and the gigantic figure of the Tahitian
    faced the white man. He was stripped to the waist and held a musket in his
    hand, but, seeing that Young&rsquo;s piece lay on the ground, he put his
    down also.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it that ye seek, Etuati?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We come to seek thee; thou hast killed the Iron-worker, and we will
    see justice done. No one, white or brown, must slay his fellow-man and be
    allowed to escape,&rdquo; answered Young quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He sought to rob me of my wife. Am I a slave to suffer such a wrong
    as that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us shoot the beggar!&rdquo; called out Martin and Brown together,
    and Mills, too, urged Young to stand aside and let them end the matter at
    once.</p>
  <p>But Young begged them to have patience. He wished to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.</p>
  <p>Talalu listened quietly, his eyes fixed upon Christian, who sat with his
    chin upon his hand, regarding the two parties with an aspect of utter indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the Tahitian to Young, &ldquo;so that there may
    be peace between the white men and the brown, I swear by the god of the white
    men, and by the god Oro, to do in this matter as Kirisiani wills. I know
    that he is a just man and will do no wrong either to me or to thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; answered Young, &ldquo;speak to him and tell him
    this; for but a little time ago he told me he cared naught for any of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He fell back to the white men, and told them of the Tahitian&rsquo;s proposition.
    To it they all consented, feeling sure that, however much Christian kept
    himself aloof from them, he would never actually take sides against them
    with the islanders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Christian coldly, when Young asked him to
    speak to Talalu. &ldquo;As I have said, I will take no side, but if Talalu
    wants my opinion I will give it. Whether he acts upon it or not will not
    trouble me.&rdquo; He walked through the little gateway up the path to the
    door of the house, but half way he stopped; for the big Tahitian with hands
    outstretched advanced towards him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art a just man, Kirisiani,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as just as
    Tuti, and I, Talalu, son of Totaro, have no fear of thee. This do I say&mdash;mine
    was the hand that slew the Iron-worker; and thou art a just man, and
    will not let these thy countrymen kill me because I did that which was right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment or two Christian hesitated, and then with a bitter laugh replied
    in a cold voice&mdash;&ldquo;Thou foolish man, dost thou think my countrymen
    care for thy wrongs? Thou hast killed their comrade&mdash;a man who was useful
    to them because of his skill. Thou art but a savage; thy skin is brown, theirs
    is white; and in their eyes he of the brown skin hath neither rights or wrongs.
    Therefore, oh man with the brown skin, who hast no heart to feel, and no
    soul to suffer, lay down thy weapon and feel the justice of these thy masters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mocking bitterness and contempt which rang through his voice cut the
    faithful Talalu to the heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this thy justice, Kirisiani? Thou, the husband of Mahina! Thou,
    for whom we of the brown skins and loving hearts would lay down our lives!
    Thou of whom Nahi my wife said, when I cast the Iron-worker over the cliffs, &lsquo;Kirisiani
    is thy friend and will stand to thee!&rsquo; Hast thou no other answer for
    me but this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Talk to me no more,&rdquo; Christian replied passionately; &ldquo;I
    care neither for thee, nor for these white men, nor for myself. Do as thou
    wilt&mdash;it matters not to me; so that none of ye trouble me, I care not.
    Farewell,&rdquo; and with angry impatience he turned away and was soon lost
    to view. Mahina, with her infant in her arms, quickly followed, endeavouring
    to overtake him.</p>
  <p>Then Talalu, with his hands clasped together and downcast head, returned
    to the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me my gun,&rdquo; he said sadly to Tairoa-Maina.</p>
  <p>Holding the weapon up over his head, he turned to Young, who had by this
    time with the help of Smith succeeded in quieting the most turbulent of his
    comrades.</p>
  <p>Throwing his musket at Young&rsquo;s feet the gigantic Tahitian spoke&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do with me as it seems best to thee. I swore by Oro my god that Kirisiani
    should decide between us. But his heart has turned to stone. Do with me as
    you will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Something in the despairing accents of Talalu&rsquo;s voice touched even
    the callous heart of Young, and he could not help admiring the loyalty to
    his word which made the Tahitian, savage as he was, surrender so quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is well,&rdquo; he said, picking up the man&rsquo;s musket from
    the sward. &ldquo;Come with me; I promise that no harm shall befall thee
    till this thing that thou hast done hath been well considered. But say this
    to thy friends in the house&mdash;if before the sun sets they do not lay
    down their arms and bring them to my house, I will kill thee with my own
    hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell them that thyself,&rdquo; said the Tahitian proudly; &ldquo;how
    can I, a man, say this to them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Advancing to the house Young gave the natives his warning, but ere one of
    them could reply Talalu sprang to his side with a haughty gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heed him not, my friends. The words are his, not mine. I, Talalu,
    give my life because of the oath I swore to Kirisiani, who hath deserted
    me. Am I a dog to buy my life from these white men because of thy friendship
    for me, oh men of Tahiti and Tubuai? If I die, do thou, Tairoa-Maina, friend
    of my heart, take Nahi for thy wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The door was shut again with a cry of defiance, and again the musket barrels
    protruded through the windows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave them alone for the present,&rdquo; commanded Young; and with
    their prisoner walking calmly before them, the white men marched away.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Clasping her child to her bosom, Mahina followed her husband as quickly
    as her strength would permit. The events of the past few days had exhausted
    her in mind and body, and she began to fear her husband&rsquo;s morbid behaviour
    was turning into actual madness. Thrice as she caught sight of him in the
    rough ascent of the rocky path had she called his name and asked him to stop,
    but he seemed to take no heed. At last when she gained the summit of the
    ridge which overlooked the valley wherein his house stood, she saw him standing,
    his gaunt figure silhouetted against the sky-line, with folded arms, and
    head sunk upon his chest. As she came near he seemed to be asleep, for he
    made no sign to show he knew of her presence.</p>
  <p>Setting the sleeping child gently down upon a mossy cleft in the rock, she
    stepped softly to him and touched his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kirisiani,&rdquo; she said, panting from the long and hurried walk, &ldquo;I
    pray thee, come home to thy house to-night. I fear to be alone, so far from
    thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a savage oath, and the light of madness gleaming in his eyes, he thrust
    her rudely away.</p>
  <p>With a despairing, heart-broken cry she staggered and fell upon the jagged
    rocks, and Christian, without even looking behind, resumed his journey to
    his cave.</p>
  <p>An hour later, when Mahina awoke to the consciousness of her misery, she
    was alone in her husband&rsquo;s house with her head pillowed against Edward
    Young&rsquo;s bosom, whilst he kissed her again and again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art my heart&rsquo;s desire,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
    The Tongue of a Woman</b></h2>
  <p>Darkness fell on the lonely island, and the muffled roar of the breakers
    beating against the cliffs of Afit&#257; was the only sound that disturbed
    the silence of the night.</p>
  <p>In the big living-room of Edward Young&rsquo;s house Talalu sat moodily
    upon a mat in one corner, wondering what had become of Nahi. His captors,
    at Young&rsquo;s request, had not bound their prisoner, but had left Alrema
    on guard over him with a loaded musket and pistol.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where was Nahi?&rdquo; he wondered. &ldquo;Why was she, the faithful,
    loving wife, not with him now?&rdquo; Alrema, by Young&rsquo;s direction,
    had given him food, but it lay beside him untasted. Young himself was absent;
    for soon after bringing Talalu to the house he had quietly left again. Alrema
    sat at the open doorway, her pale, handsome face wearing a disturbed expression.
    Where was her husband? Why was he so eager to get away at such a time as
    this, when men&rsquo;s minds were disturbed and the scent of blood was in
    the air! But for her proud and haughty nature she would have watched his
    movements, and would now have gone in search of him. But Mahina&rsquo;s soft,
    gentle face rose before her, with her pleading eyes, and Alrema lowered her
    head and wept silently. How could she kill Mahina, who had ever been her
    friend, and who had eyes and heart for Kirisiani alone? And yet&mdash;ah!
    she could think no longer. Perhaps her husband was gone elsewhere, and Mahina
    slept alone with her children.</p>
  <p>The long, long hours passed slowly away till midnight; then a step crunched
    upon the pebbly path, and Young entered the house. His face was calm, but
    Alrema saw that his dark eyes burned with unusual brilliancy.</p>
  <p>As he seated himself, Smith came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Young,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the others have just held a sort
    of meeting at Brown&rsquo;s house, and are now coming up to demand that we
    wait no longer for the Tahitians to surrender. They say their lives are in
    danger while the natives have arms in their possession. I have tried to persuade
    them to leave the matter to you, but they won&rsquo;t listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered the other quietly; and Alrema noticed
    that he spoke somewhat brokenly, as if out of breath. &ldquo;I can do no
    more, but if they insist in pursuing this quarrel to the bitter end, I must
    see it through with the rest of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alrema handed him a young coconut to drink. He took it from her hand, but
    his eyes avoided his wife&rsquo;s face. Then, taking his musket and putting
    a pistol in his belt, he spoke to Talalu.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must come with us,&rdquo; he said, not unkindly to the Tahitian, &ldquo;so
    that your countrymen may see that no harm hath been done thee. I will try
    and reason with them.&rdquo; Then, leaving Alrema with her child, the three
    men stepped out into the darkness to meet the others.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Nahi had not deserted her husband in his extremity. While he sat a prisoner
    in Young&rsquo;s house, wondering why she had not come near him, Nahi was
    busy with her tongue. Since nightfall she had been in Williams&rsquo; house
    talking to her countrymen, and with passionate eloquence stirring their hearts
    to the doing of a great deed; and the Tahitians and Tubuaians, as they watched
    her flashing eyes sparkle and glow like diamonds in the faint light and listened
    to her fiery appeal, shifted uneasily and muttered to one another in low
    tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why dost thou urge us to such a bloody deed, oh Nahi?&rdquo; said
    Manale, a short, stout man, who, with his musket upon his knees, sat cross-legged
    on the floor. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not for blood we seek, but for the
    right to live and work for ourselves, and no longer remain slaves. Thou art
    but a woman, and shouldst not urge&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; and she clenched her hand fiercely round the hilt
    of the knife she held&mdash;&ldquo;a woman, yes. But thou, Manale&mdash;bulky
    as thou art in body, thy heart is as the heart of a tiny fish. Will ye five
    be slaves to these cruel white dogs? Shame on ye all! Is there no one among
    you better than a Mahu?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, insult us not, Nahi, with such bitter words,&rdquo; said Tairoa-Maina; &ldquo;we
    are <i>men</i>. It is in our minds that Kirisiani will help
    us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She laughed bitterly. &ldquo;Kirisiani! He whom my husband trusted before
    other men&mdash;only to be betrayed! He has turned from our people, and cares
    not if his countrymen rid themselves of us. Death is before ye all, I tell
    thee. Will ye let these white men slay ye one by one? Have ye not guns in
    thy hands? Five pieces of iron, and death lieth within them, ready to leap
    out with flame and smoke. Live and be slaves! Act and be men!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She ceased; the lamp of tui tui nuts flickered, wavered and died out, and
    darkness fell upon them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us talk,&rdquo; said Tairoa-Maina in a whisper to the other four.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, talk,&rdquo; said Nahi, &ldquo;talk. And think that even now
    my husband lies dead because ye have proved cowards!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Five minutes passed; then Nahi, with fierce joy, saw them rise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come thou and see us act,&rdquo; said Manale to her, as he touched
    her arm, and they all filed out in silence.</p>
  <p>Young and Smith, with Talalu walking between them, had scarcely gone a hundred
    yards from the house when they met Quintal and McCoy coming down the rugged
    path towards Young&rsquo;s dwelling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Young,&rdquo; said McCoy, &ldquo;we have determined to clap a
    stopper on this mutiny at once. We can&rsquo;t let these fellows take charge
    of the island any longer, and we want you to come along with us and surprise
    them before daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;m agreeable. But at the same time&rdquo;&mdash;and
    Young laughed ironically&mdash;&ldquo;it does me good to hear you&mdash;or
    any of us&mdash;talk about putting down a mutiny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call it by any name you like,&rdquo; said McCoy, roughly. &ldquo;But
    it won&rsquo;t do for us to let this thing go on. We came to you because
    we know you won&rsquo;t leave us in the lurch, like Mr. Christian has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right; lead on. Where are the others?&rdquo; said Young.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone on ahead slowly; we&rsquo;ll overtake them before
    they reach the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Following Young in Indian file, the three white men and the Tahitian walked
    as quickly as the night would permit along the narrow path which wound gently
    up a hill thickly covered with hibiscus shrubs. So sinuous was their course,
    however, that objects even a few yards ahead could not be perceived.</p>
  <p>No sound disturbed the silence of the island night, save for the throbbing
    of the ever-restless surf and the strange, plaintive cries of the young sea-birds
    in their rookeries on the cliffs.</p>
  <p>Suddenly there rang out, and echoed and re-echoed in quavering reverberations
    in the hollows of the hills, three musket shots in quick succession, followed
    by the hoarse, weird clamour of tens of thousands of birds as they rose and
    circled in wild alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God!&rdquo; cried Young, &ldquo;we must run; that&rsquo;s our
    men firing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This comes of too much palavering. While we&rsquo;ve been paying
    out fathoms of talk the fight has begun,&rdquo; said Quintal, angrily; and
    the four white men, leaving Talalu to his own devices, took to their heels
    and ran excitedly in the direction of the firing, which seemed, however,
    to be nearer the white men&rsquo;s houses than to that of the Tubuaians.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looks as if our fellows had grabbed &rsquo;em while they were asleep,
    and court-martialled &rsquo;em on the spot while we&rsquo;ve been arguing
    over the thing,&rdquo;  said McCoy as he ran with the others.</p>
  <p>But their surmises were entirely wrong. Before getting more than two hundred
    yards further Smith, who was in advance, stumbled and fell over something
    in the darkness; the hands he put out to save himself plunged into a pool
    of blood which was oozing from the body of Brown, who lay dead in the middle
    of the track, with a jagged bullet-hole through his chest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God, it&rsquo;s Brown!&rdquo; cried Smith, feeling the man&rsquo;s
    face, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a fight. Come on, men, for heaven&rsquo;s sake;
    we may be in time to save the others&rdquo;; and Young, followed by McCoy
    and Quintal, rushed along the track in search of their comrades, and in a
    few seconds had left Smith many yards behind.</p>
  <p>Stooping down again over the body of the murdered man, Smith felt his heart
    to satisfy himself that he was dead. He lifted the still bleeding figure,
    carried it a few yards away from the path, and proceeded to grope for his
    own musket, which he had dropped.</p>
  <p>As he stooped a dark form silently stepped out from the thick undergrowth
    lining the path. A clubbed musket was raised in the air, and Smith fell and
    lay unconscious close to the corpse of his fellow-country-man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Aue!</i>&rdquo; said Manale the Tubuaian to Nihu the Tahitian,
    who accompanied him, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis Simeti whom I have slain. And I would
    not have harmed him, for he hath ever been good to us. But this dog&rdquo;&mdash;and
    he spurned the body of the other white man&mdash;&ldquo;was our enemy, and
    my hand was strong with hate when I slew him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Young and the others ran on, but only for a short distance, when again an
    exclamation of horror burst from them; this time two dead men lay in their
    path&mdash;Mills and Martin.</p>
  <p>Then, before they could realise what had happened, five muskets blazed out
    from a rocky ridge above, and several naked figures sprang from their ambush
    with savage yells.</p>
  <p>None of the white men were struck, but Quintal and McCoy, terrified out
    of their wits, dropped their muskets and fled. The intense darkness favoured
    them. They succeeded in evading the rush of their opponents, and were soon
    clambering down the mountain side in the hope of finding better shelter in
    the dense scrub of the valley. Young alone stood his ground, and fired his
    musket at the first of the natives who sprang upon him; but he missed his
    mark, and before he could club the weapon Nihu struck him a blow on the head
    with a musket, and laid him senseless.</p>
  <p>The five figures bent over him for a moment, and talked hurriedly among
    themselves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Etuati,&rdquo; said Tetihiti; &ldquo;he lieth as one dead.
    For the sake of Alrema, his wife, who is of my blood, let him live, oh friends&rdquo;;
    and he warded off the musket of the savage Manale, who had pressed the muzzle
    of the weapon to Young&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;But the other two, Makoi and
    Kawintali, must die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So they sped away in pursuit of Quintal and McCoy.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
    After the Storm</b></h2>
  <p>For some minutes Edward Young lay stunned upon the rocky path, a stream
    of blood oozing from a severe cut in his head. Presently the cool night air
    brought him back to consciousness, and, as by slow degrees his senses returned
    he feared that he alone was left alive of all the white men on the island,
    and it was likely enough that even his hours were numbered. With a struggle
    he rose slowly and painfully, dragging his footsteps along the road until
    he reached his house. Fearful of again encountering the enraged islanders
    he proceeded with the greatest caution, stopping suddenly, when at a turn
    in the narrow track he saw three figures in a crouching position.</p>
  <p>He dropped upon his hands and knees and scanned them carefully. Presently
    he recognised Nahi, Alrema, and Terere. The three women were supporting Smith,
    who was too badly hurt to stand upon his feet. As Young watched, doubtful
    whether to approach or not, he saw a fourth figure join them, and knew Mahina
    by the black mantle of hair falling down her back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is <i>he</i> dead, I wonder?&rdquo;  he muttered to himself. &ldquo;Better
    for him if he is. I will never surrender her again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rose to his feet and advanced towards them. The women gave a startled
    cry, and Smith fell back upon the ground with a groan of agony.</p>
  <p>Alrema&rsquo;s arms were round Young&rsquo;s neck in an instant, and her
    fearful, panting bosom pressed to his lovingly. &ldquo;My husband, my husband,&rdquo; she
    murmured, &ldquo;thou art wounded; yet Nahi said thou wouldst be safe.&rdquo; She
    turned fiercely upon the wife of Talalu, who covered her face with her hands
    and wept.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas! what have I done?&rdquo; said Nahi, &ldquo;the fire of anger
    in my countrymen&rsquo;s hearts was kindled by me, and in their wrath they
    knew not friend from foe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mahina drew near, trembling from head to foot; and Alrema, with an agonised
    heart, saw her husband&rsquo;s hand steal out to her friend&rsquo;s and give
    it a quick, warm pressure. Then Mahina sank upon her knees in the darkness
    and wept silently. Did Alrema know that she, her friend, had yielded, and
    that Edward Young no longer cared for the brave, loyal wife who had fought
    and bled for him in the days gone by in Tubuai?</p>
  <p>Alrema did know. But maddened as she was by the discovery of her husband&rsquo;s
    faithlessness, she was yet true to Mahina; and all her love for Young welled
    up fresh and strong in her heart when she felt him swaying to and fro on
    his feet from weakness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou cruel Nahi,&rdquo; she cried bitterly, &ldquo;dost thou think
    that thy husband is more dear to thee than mine is to me&rdquo;&mdash;a sob
    choked her utterance&mdash;&ldquo;he for whom my life is ever ready to be
    given? If he comes to further harm I swear I will kill thee, thou false and
    wicked Nahi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nahi sprang to her feet, and her black eyes gleamed with fire as she threw
    her arms wide out. &ldquo;What I have done was for the love of Talalu! But
    let us not waste time in words; hide thy husband and the husband of Terere
    until the fury of our people hath spent itself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was now agreed that Young, who was only just able to walk, should go
    on ahead and conceal himself in a cave in the mountains, known only to the
    women, who would bring him food and water until he was safe from pursuit
    or further vengeance from the brown men; and, supported by Alrema and the
    trembling Mahina, the wounded man set out, and the three toiled slowly along.
    Then Young began to talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave me by myself,&rdquo; he said weakly in English. &ldquo;You,
    Alrema, return home and see to our child. Maybe she has come to harm. You,
    Mahina, look for your husband, he may be dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What matters it to me?&rdquo; burst from Mahina. &ldquo;Would that
    I, too, were dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take thou my husband to the cave, Mahina.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Alrema who spoke, steadying her voice through unseen tears.  &ldquo;Take
    him to the cave whilst I seek out thy husband and bring him to thee&mdash;to
    thee and to his friend&mdash;his true and good friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The bitterness of the words, &ldquo;his true and good friend,&rdquo; pierced
    the anguished heart of Christian&rsquo;s wife like a knife-stab.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, Alrema, leave me not, I pray thee. See, thy husband needs
    us both. Stay with me; for the love I have always borne thee, stay with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Alrema only answered her with a sob, and in another instant was gone,
    to fall upon her face a few yards away and weep out her shame and bitterness
    of heart. &ldquo;For the sake of my child,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;for
    the sake of my child, neither his blood nor hers shall redden my hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then rising to her feet she went to seek Christian.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Smith had fainted. His wife, as soon as he returned to consciousness, assisted
    him to his feet; they set out towards the cave where Young was gone, and
    in another hour their journey was successfully accomplished.</p>
  <p>The wives of McCoy and Quintal&mdash;Puni the Huahine woman, and Malama&mdash;  meantime
    sat alone in their houses, weeping at the thought of the fate which they
    felt sure had overtaken their husbands. Nahi, on her way to seek Talalu had
    called in and spoken words of encouragement which somewhat allayed their
    fears. She promised that she would restrain her countrymen from further attacking
    the white men; then still fearful as to what had become of her own husband,
    she quickly ran the rest of the distance to her little dwelling in Williams&rsquo; enclosure.
    When she entered she found the gigantic Tahitian quietly seated cross-legged
    upon a mat, with his musket beside him, eating his supper. She embraced him
    tenderly and began to tell him of all that had happened.</p>
  <p>He interrupted her in the middle of her recital. &ldquo;I know all, Nahi.
    I was hidden in a clump of trees and saw all that took place between thee
    and the wounded white men. And now that thou hast returned in safety I myself
    will go to Manale and the others, and stay their hands from further killing.
    Enough blood has been shed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Towards dawn the islanders returned from their fruitless search for McCoy
    and Quintal, and as they filed one by one into Williams&rsquo; house they
    were met by Talalu, who had just missed them in the darkness.</p>
  <p>In a few words he so worked upon their feelings that they readily agreed
    to do no further harm to the remaining white men, and consented to meet and
    discuss their future relations towards each other.</p>
  <p>Christian, slumbering in the loneliness of his mountain cave, had heard
    the report of the muskets and guessed what was happening; but he was perfectly
    indifferent as to how the quarrel might end, and so remained where he was.
    About two or three hours before dawn he felt a touch upon his arm and saw
    a woman&rsquo;s figure bending over him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; he said angrily, thinking it was Mahina who had
    disturbed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have come, Kirisiani, to tell thee that three of the white men
    are dead, and Simeti and Etuati wounded. Didst thou not hear the guns?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard them, Alrema, but it is naught to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naught to thee? Hast thou no thought to ask if Mahina and thy children
    be alive or dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laughed bitterly. &ldquo;None. What care I for Mahina? Dost thou think
    I am blind? Hast thou not seen what I have seen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The woman sank on her knees beside him, and, taking his hand in hers, wept
    passionately. &ldquo;Aye, I know it now. But yet Mahina is my friend, else
    had I killed her. And because of that and for my great friendship for thee
    have I brought thy two children, so that thou mayest take them to their mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; asked Christian as he rose, and with steel and
    flint lit the rude lamp of coconut oil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is waiting for thee in the cave with Simeti and my husband. And
    see, this do I swear&mdash;only because I bade her stay and help the wounded
    men did she remain away from thy house and children. Else would she have
    come, and with them sought thee here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian regarded her for a moment or two in silence. He admired her intense
    loyalty and devotion to Mahina, which was put to such a test, and so restrained
    himself from sneering at her weakness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are my children?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They wait outside. I feared to bring them to thee till we had spoken
    together a little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bring them in,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and stay with them here till
    I return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She placed her hand upon his shoulder. &ldquo;Thou wilt hurt neither my
    husband nor Mahina?&rdquo; she said beseechingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;neither. For the sake of
    these, my children, I will not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She took his hand and kissed it again. &ldquo;Forgive her, Kirisiani. When
    thou didst cast her aside from thee on the cliffs she became in the hands
    of my husband, who is a cunning man, as a twig that is bent by the fingers
    of a child. Only for this she had remained true to thee and he true to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again he laughed with bitter scorn. &ldquo;All women are alike, and all
    men are false to their friends and their duty when a woman&rsquo;s face comes
    between. Stay here till I return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just as dawn broke, Christian, guided by the directions Alrema had given
    him, found and entered the cave, and was greeted with an exclamation of joy
    from Smith; Young, who lay upon a couch of leaves, merely nodded to him and
    said nothing. Mahina was not visible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am glad to find you both alive&mdash;<i>both</i>,&rdquo; he added,
    with a steady glance at Edward Young, whose eyes dropped before his, &ldquo;although
    if every white man on the island had been killed it would have been but justice.
    How can these people trust men who, even among themselves, are guilty of
    the blackest treachery to each other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a little while no one spoke; then came a murmur of voices outside, and
    Talalu stood before the three white men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is my message to ye, oh white men who were once my friends;
    these are the words of Temua, Nihu, the men of Tubuai, and I, Talalu. Let
    there be peace between us. We sought not blood; only when it was forced upon
    us did we fight and kill. Let there be peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I blame neither thee nor them,&rdquo; said Christian quietly, &ldquo;and
    now I tell these two men here, who were once my friends, but whom I wish
    to see no more, that they will do well to make peace with thee and thy countrymen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without a word of farewell he turned and left them with Talalu, who, as
    both Young and Smith saw, was unfeignedly glad at their escape; and they
    in their turn were relieved to hear that McCoy and Quintal were safe.</p>
  <p>As the sun rose they heard plaintive notes of wailing for the dead rising
    from the valley below, and soon after, Nahi and some of the Tahitian men
    came, unarmed, to tell them that their comrades&rsquo; graves were being
    dug.</p>
  <p>Still weak from loss of blood, Young and Smith managed to leave their retreat
    and, assisted by the now friendly Tahitians, reach the valley, where they
    saw standing round the three bodies a little group of brown people. As they
    drew near, Manale stepped out from the others and offered his hand to Young.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it peace between us?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is peace,&rdquo; said Young and Smith, both taking his hands.</p>
  <p>Presently they were joined by McCoy and Quintal; and the bodies of the slain
    men, having been wrapped in mats by the women, were placed in their graves
    in silence, broken only by the sobs of their wives.</p>
  <p>Walking slowly away from the cave, Fletcher Christian, with white, despairing
    face, went first to his house, intending to bring away some further articles
    for his own use in his retreat. The door was closed, but not fastened on
    the inside. Pushing it open, he saw the figure of his wife upon her couch.
    She had been weeping, and as he entered the room trembled in every nerve;
    then, ere he could restrain her, cast herself at his feet and flung back
    her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kill me,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;kill me, else will I die as did
    Faito.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drew back from her coldly. &ldquo;Thou art but a woman, and men do not
    kill women in my country, even though they be false to their husbands. Listen
    to me. So that I never see thy face again I am content. But still would I
    see my children sometimes. Therefore with thee they shall remain, and sometimes
    will I come to them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In another moment he was gone, and Mahina looked wildly after his retreating
    figure. Then she swayed and fell, and an hour after Alrema, with tears of
    pity filling her star-like eyes, came in with the children and embraced her
    friend lovingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He will yet love thee again,&rdquo; said the loyal girl&mdash; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    but a black cloud that will vanish. And see, I too forgive thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
  &ldquo;Mine the Hand!&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>A month had elapsed. To Mahina it was a month of misery.</p>
  <p>With her children she passed her days and nights in solitude, broken only
    by visits from Talalu and Alrema, who both knew the secret of her suffering.
    Once or twice only had she caught sight of Christian as he wandered about
    his cliffs at dusk, and had been impelled by her love to follow and speak
    to him; but with a cold gesture of indifference he had waved her back and
    walked slowly on, oblivious to her heart-wrung sobs.</p>
  <p>And not to Mahina alone had come suspense and grief; Alrema suffered too,
    for her husband now neglected her for the company of McCoy and Quintal. Since
    the deaths of Brown, Mills, and Martin, a period of incessant watchfulness
    and suspicion had ensued&mdash;the white men dreaded the brown, the brown
    suspected the white. Edward Young, fearful of more bloodshed, had tried to
    persuade the islanders to give their arms up to him; but this, though they
    repeated their assurance of good will towards the seamen, they refused to
    do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To Kirisiani alone will we give up our guns,&rdquo; said one of the
    Tubuaians, &ldquo;for in him alone have we faith. And Kirisiani himself saith
    that there is no faith or honour in any among ye. Thou, Etuati, who wert
    once his sworn <i>taio</i>, knowest if he speaketh truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Young winced at the native&rsquo;s words, but said nothing. His mad infatuation
    for Mahina still remained, yet he was sensible of his own degradation and
    treachery to Christian, and a sense of shame kept him from approaching Mahina
    since that fatal evening. Mahina herself, though the man had acquired a strange
    power over her, forcing her to believe his passionate declaration of love,
    trembled with fear lest she should see him again.</p>
  <p>Talalu, ever faithful both to her and her husband, was the one man on the
    island with whom Christian now held converse, and the big-hearted fellow
    more than once sought him out in his retreat and tried to induce him at least
    to meet and speak to his wretched wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is but a woman, Kirisiani; and see, oh friend, her heart is eaten
    up for love of thee. Canst thou not take her to thee again? Thou art strong;
    she is weak. Are women of Peretane never unfaithful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Christian, though he listened to the friendly Tahitian, would answer, &ldquo;Let
    it be as it is&mdash;she is nought to me, nor I to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One night as the two sat together on the edge of the cliffs, looking over
    the wide expanse of star-lit ocean, the Tahitian began to talk of the condition
    of affairs between his countrymen and the whites, and urged Christian to
    destroy, if possible, the growing unrest and suspicion which disturbed both
    parties.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy countrymen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;go about in fear of us, with
    their muskets ever to their hands. Thou, who art a chief among them, canst
    still make them listen to thee; then will they forget all that is past, for
    we of Tahiti and Tubuai do not seek more bloodshed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can do nothing for thee, Talalu. Bitterly do I repent the misery
    and death that I have wrought to white men and brown; but I can do nothing&mdash;no
    longer will I interfere between thy people and my countrymen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One night all that remained of the mutineers assembled in Young&rsquo;s
    house. The last to enter was Smith, accompanied by Terere, whom he placed
    outside to watch. The door was carefully closed, and the men sat on the rough
    wooden benches which, with a table, formed the furniture of the living room.
    For some minutes they conversed in low tones; then Young rose and spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can delay no longer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Tahitians, my
    wife will tell you, intend to attack us at daybreak. They firmly believe
    that we shall not rest until we have avenged the murder of our countrymen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The other men looked at each other and nodded acquiescence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yesterday, so Alrema says, they came to the horrible resolution of
    killing us all except Christian. Him they look upon as mad, and, as you know,
    they have a curious feeling of regard for mad people. They consider the insane
    as inspired and protected by the gods, and their lives are held sacred. Now,
    God knows, I have no wish to see more bloodshed on this island; but,&rdquo; and
    here Young&rsquo;s face paled and his words came slowly, &ldquo;it seems
    to me that my wife&rsquo;s advice, however dreadful it may appear, should
    be followed. Either they or we must die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>McCoy struck the table with his huge, heavy fist. &ldquo;Speaking for myself
    and Mat Quintal, I think we ought to have done it long ago. Mr. Christian&rsquo;s
    damned fine ideas about the rights o&rsquo; these bloody-minded savages is
    all very well when you haven&rsquo;t got to live with them. I am for settling
    it at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; said Smith, &ldquo;but I suppose
    my opinion won&rsquo;t alter the matter one way or another. Since Mr. Christian
    won&rsquo;t have anything to do with us, I am willing to look to Mr. Young
    as our leader. If he considers it necessary for our safety to murder these
    people&mdash;why I&rsquo;ve gone too far to hold back now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder is an ugly name, Smith,&rdquo; said Young quickly, &ldquo;and
    I&rsquo;ve no mind to accept your help. McCoy, Quintal, and myself can do
    what is to be done without you. We must either kill or be killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Mr. Young,&rdquo; said Quintal approvingly. &ldquo;Smith
    had better go to his friend, Mr. Christian, and live in his cave. We three
    can settle this business. We don&rsquo;t want any white-livered man among
    us at a time like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a fierce glance Smith sprang to his feet. &ldquo;Damn you, Quintal,
    you are too ready with your tongue. I&rsquo;m no more white-livered than
    you are. You knew that when we took the ship off Tofoa. If Mr. Young says
    the word I am ready to fight, or murder, or whatever you like to call it,
    all the Tahitians myself. To my mind he&rsquo;s a King&rsquo;s officer still&mdash; leastways
    so far as my obedience to him goes. Say what is to be done, and I&rsquo;ll
    have a hand in the doing of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Words, words, idle words, and nothing is done. In a little time it
    may be too late. While ye talk, and talk, I, Alrema, will alone do the deed.
    Mine shall be the hand to strike.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alrema was sitting in a corner of the house, her dark eyes watching with
    intense interest each movement of the white men, and listening to every word
    spoken; and her husband, as he turned towards her, saw in her eyes the look
    he had seen long ago on Tubuai, when she held in her hand a blood-stained
    cutlass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I alone will do it,&rdquo; and seizing an axe from a tool-rack on
    the wall she waved her hand to the whites, opened the door, and was gone.</p>
  <p>Picking up their muskets the four men hastily followed Alrema along the
    narrow track which led to the dwelling of her countrymen and the house of
    Williams.</p>
  <p>At the doorway of Williams&rsquo; house sat the huge Talalu, musket in hand,
    keeping watch while his countrymen slept. For some weeks they had never rested
    without setting a watch, for their wives warned them continually that the
    white men were dangerous and were plotting mischief. Nahi, who seemed animated
    by the bitterest feeling of hatred against all the whites save Christian,
    had continually declared that sooner or later the remaining Englishmen would
    avenge the deaths of their comrades by a sudden massacre. Her repeated warning
    had so worked upon the fears of her countrymen as to force them into believing
    its truth, and they resolved to be beforehand with the white men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kill them, kill them,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Only when their blood
    runs shall we be safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So they sat together in the darkened room and agreed to make an attack next
    morning at daybreak, in which Nahi and the wives of the Tahitians were to
    take part. After arranging the details, the plotters lay down to sleep, leaving
    Talalu on watch. He was to call them at dawn; and as the brown men spread
    their mats upon the gravelled floor, Nahi whispered in his ear, &ldquo;To-morrow,
    my husband, those who sought thy life will be silent for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Nahi little knew that Alrema, ever on the alert, had learned from Puni
    the danger that overhung the white men, and had guarded against it.</p>
  <p>Talalu, sitting dreamily on the doorstep of the house, with his musket across
    his knees, woke with a start. Surely a footstep rustled the dead pandanus
    leaves that lay along the path? He opened his half-closed eyes and listened.
    Nothing broke the stillness but the murmuring hum of the surf, and the strange
    weird rustle of the wind as it soughed through the groves of pandanus and
    coco-palms. He bent his head again and dozed, then in an instant was upon
    his feet. Some one was approaching, for this time he heard clearly the crackling
    of dead leaves underfoot.</p>
  <p>Leaning on his musket his keen eye eagerly scanned the darkness of the night.
    A soft footfall behind him&mdash;and it was too late. Before he could rise
    and face the intruder, or call an alarm, Alrema&rsquo;s axe had cleft his
    skull in halves, and the watcher&rsquo;s cry of warning mingled with his
    dying groan.</p>
  <p>Swinging the weapon over her head, Alrema, followed by the white men, dashed
    into the house, and then, in the dim light of the flickering lamp, began
    a horrible slaughter of the sleeping men. Manale, who lay nearest the door,
    fell as he rose, beneath a blow from Alrema&rsquo;s axe, which sank deep
    into the broad, naked bosom; and three shots from the white man&rsquo;s muskets
    did the rest of their bloody work.</p>
  <p>One of the Tubuaians alone succeeded in leaping past his assailants and
    gaining the door; but Young drew a pistol from his belt, sprang before him
    and pointed the weapon at his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; cried Alrema, &ldquo;shoot! spare none, so that we
    may have peace afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The savage thirst for slaughter in her voice steadied the wavering hand
    that but for her would have spared. For a moment he hesitated, then aimed
    the pistol at the Tubuaian&rsquo;s breast, pulled the trigger, and the last
    of the brown men fell upon his face on the blood-stained mats.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter32"></a>Chapter 32<br>
    Nahi&rsquo;s Revenge</b></h2>
  <p>Too terrified to aid their husbands, and each moment expecting to share
    their fate, the wives of the murdered men crouched together in horror at
    one end of the room, nor could all the endeavours of the Englishmen soothe
    their fears. At last Young and his companions went away and left them with
    their dead. Alrema, fearless as she was, went with them, for there was in
    Nahi&rsquo;s face a look of such deadly hatred that even her iron-souled
    nature quailed before it.</p>
  <p>At sunrise next morning two people alone on the island knew nothing of what
    had happened&mdash;Fletcher Christian and Mahina. That morning she sat beside
    him in the cave, fanning his flushed face and aching head, for he was ill
    and suffering in mind and body. Two days before, at sundown, as he wandered
    along the wild and rugged track leading to his mountain retreat, she had
    watched him unseen, and saw that he staggered as he walked and had scarce
    strength enough to drag his weary feet along. She waited till darkness set
    in and then followed, her heart beating fast in an agony of hope and fear.
    Peering cautiously in she saw her husband fling himself upon his couch and
    mats and lie there, his face turned away from her, breathing heavily and
    painfully. For some minutes she stood and watched him with tears of loving
    pity filling her eyes. Her husband! He whose love was once hers, and might
    yet be again! And he was ill and weak. Surely he would not curse her now?</p>
  <p>Softly she crept in through the darkness and sat near him, longing yet fearing
    to speak; but soon she knew by his low mutterings and the way in which he
    flung his arms about that he was ill of fever. She had surmised as much when
    she saw him going towards the cave, and knew how perfectly helpless even
    a strong man became in a few hours from the first attack.</p>
  <p>Quickly she made her way in the darkness back to her house, filled a small
    basket with some ripe limes, roused her children, and, leading one and carrying
    the other, returned as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p>Short as was her absence, she knew as soon as she entered the cave by the
    sound of Christian&rsquo;s breathing that he was much worse. Placing the
    children&mdash;of whose fretful cries her husband seemed quite unconscious&mdash;by
    themselves in a corner, she quickly cut some of the limes in halves and squeezed
    them into a coconut-shell, with a little water. Then she raised Christian&rsquo;s
    head upon her knees, and the fever-stricken man, suffering from the
    agonies of a burning thirst, eagerly drank the life&mdash;giving draught.
    All that night she sat beside him, cooling his aching head and giving him
    at short intervals a mouthful of lime-juice. Towards morning the violence
    of the fever abated. He slept, and Mahina was happy as she watched.</p>
  <p>The dawn came, and Christian&rsquo;s breathing grew soft and regular. Mahina
    took his hand in hers, and raised it to her lips; then, overcome by weariness,
    she lay beside him and slept too.</p>
  <p>As the first streaks of sunlight, piercing the mountain mists, lit up the
    dark and jagged rocks which hid the cave within their bosom, Christian awoke,
    and knew that the fever was gone. Then a cry escaped him, as he saw the sleeping
    figures of his wife and children; and the basket of limes and the wet bandage
    just fallen from his temples told him all. She had come to him when he was
    ill and suffering; come to him when his last words to her had been a curse.
    A great pity welled up in his heart as he looked at her pale, worn face,
    so full of pain and suffering. Her thick mantle of black hair seemed like
    a funeral pall to her body, now so weak and thin.</p>
  <p>A blade of yellow sunshine shot in through the mouth of the cave; it touched
    her face and glorified it with a strange radiance, and Fletcher Christian&rsquo;s
    better nature came back to him once more.</p>
  <p>Sinking quietly back upon his pillow he reached out his hand and placed
    it gently upon her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A broken cry of trembling happiness, then in an instant she was on her knees
    before him, with her hands clasped tightly together, and a look of unutterable
    yearning in her dark, sad eyes. He drew her to him and kissed her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art my wife,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>With streaming eyes she flung her arms round his neck and sobbed out her
    joy to live again upon her husband&rsquo;s bosom.</p>
  <p>All that morning she remained in the cave, for Christian was still weak
    from the fever. In the afternoon, to her great joy he told her that henceforward
    she and the children should remain with him there, as he had no desire to
    return and live in the valley. Mahina eagerly set about removing all their
    possessions to the new home. When she returned, the sight of Christian playing
    with and caressing her children filled her with a wild sense of happiness,
    and already her face was glowing with all the old beauty which had once fascinated
    the man she loved.</p>
  <p>In her excitement about removing the contents or their old house, Mahina
    did not notice the absence of the people from the village. That night, however,
    when after so many months of misery she and her children lay beside her husband,
    she talked with Christian of the growing suspicion and hatred now again rending
    the life of the little community.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only thee of all the white men do my people trust,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Wilt
    thou not yet come and decide between them and thy countrymen, ere it be too
    late? Is it not better, my husband, for all men to dwell together in peace?
    A hot word leadeth to a blow, and the hand toucheth the musket, and death
    leaps out from the hollow iron.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True, Mahina,&rdquo; he answered mournfully; &ldquo;I alone am to
    blame for the bloodshed in Afit&#257;. But never more will I interfere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How long they had slept they knew not, when suddenly they awoke to the report
    of firearms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What new horror is this?&rdquo; muttered Christian to himself, as
    he hastily rose and dressed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my countrymen who have again attacked the white men,&rdquo;  answered
    Mahina, trembling with fear lest her people should seek Christian&rsquo;s
    life in their mad lust for slaughter, and her newly-found happiness come
    to a sudden end.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis as likely that the white men have attacked the brown,&rdquo;  answered
    Christian bitterly. &ldquo;Are we not all rebels and murderers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Determined to shoot the first man who should attempt to enter with hostile
    intent, he took a stool to the mouth of the cave, and sat there musket in
    hand, waiting for the dawn. No further sound reached them from the valley,
    and they were beginning to hope that they had heard only the Tahitians discharging
    their pieces to frighten away &ldquo;evil spirits,&rdquo; but as the day
    broke, they saw the figure of Alrema clambering up the path along the ridge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; cried Mahina to the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas! Mahina, the white men are well, but all or our countrymen and
    the men of Tubuai are dead; the white men have slain them all. And their
    wives have now fled in fear and hidden themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a few words she told her dreadful story, and added how, when daylight
    came, the wives of McCoy and Smith, going to comfort the widows of the murdered
    men, found nothing there but the cold bodies of the victims&mdash;the women
    had fled. So while the four seamen buried those whom they had slain, their
    wives went in search of the missing women, and Alrema had come to the cave,
    thinking that they might have taken refuge with Christian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou cruel murderess,&rdquo; said Christian sternly to Alrema, &ldquo;so
    thine was the bloody hand which took the life of Talalu! May the gods punish
    thee, thou cruel and wicked woman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His savage words terrified her, and she shrunk back in alarm. Disdaining
    further speech with her, Christian turned to Mahina.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, Mahina, let us seek for these poor creatures who in the madness
    of their despair and terror may do themselves injury.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leaving the sleeping children, and closely followed by Alrema, Christian
    and Mahina began to descend the mountain by the narrow and intricate path
    winding to the plain. Sometimes it led through huge crevices in the rock,
    which shut out the light on either side, and left only a patch of blue sky
    overhead; sometimes it ran sharply over the dizzy summit of the broken mountain,
    from whence they could see the surf-beaten beach below.</p>
  <p>Suddenly the quick seaman&rsquo;s eye of Christian detected moving figures
    on <i>Bounty</i> Beach, and he stopped and gazed intently down. Away from
    the wash of the waves the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> boat lay bottom upwards,
    rapidly falling into decay from disuse; and the figures he had seen were
    turning it over upon its keel.</p>
  <p>Even while he looked he saw the three women, the moment they had turned
    the boat over, begin to drag her towards the water; but they were not strong
    enough to make much progress in their efforts.</p>
  <p>A cry of pity escaped Mahina.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What would they do?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The boat is old and rotten,
    and they seek to drag it to the water! Save them, my husband, ere they die
    by the sharks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, it is I who have filled them with fear, and &rsquo;tis I who
    will save them from death!&rdquo; And Alrema bounded down the dangerous path,
    her long, black hair flying about her naked shoulders as she sprang from
    ledge to ledge, thoughtless of danger to herself in her effort to avert this
    last calamity.</p>
  <p>Christian and Mahina followed closely, but when Alrema gained the beach
    the women had succeeded in floating the boat and, using her bottom boards
    as paddles, had sent her some little distance from the shore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come back, come back, thou foolish Nahi!&rdquo; Alrema cried frantically
    from the beach. &ldquo;Come back; I swear by the gods that no harm shall
    come to thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A heavy roller lifted the boat and carried her back for some distance shoreward,
    and the women had all they could do to keep her from broaching to; but Nahi
    while she paddled looked over her shoulder at Alrema and cursed her bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou murderess!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;rather will we drown or
    go into the bellies of the sharks than live in this bloody land of Afit&#257; with
    thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alrema took no heed of her words, but cast off her waist-cloth of tappa
    and plunged into the sea. She could see that there was a brief lull in the
    succession of rollers tumbling in upon the beach, and that, poor as their
    boards were, the women would succeed in getting out to deep water unless
    she managed to reach the boat quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paddle, paddle,&rdquo; panted Nahi to the others; &ldquo;let not
    the red-handed woman touch the boat!&rdquo; and she plunged her board into
    the water with all her strength&mdash;it broke in halves, and the boat broached
    to.</p>
  <p>She stood up in the stern, with despair in her eyes, and looked round her.
    Already Alrema was within a few feet of the boat, and in imploring tones
    was calling to the women to return, when Nahi spoke to her two companions
    in a low voice. They looked inquiringly at her, and she answered their looks
    with an impatient gesture to cease paddling.</p>
  <p>Panting, and now almost exhausted, Alrema at last gained the boat, put out
    her right hand and grasped the gunwale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said faintly, &ldquo;come back with me, Nahi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Looking down at her with savage hatred, the wife of Talalu smiled cruelly
    at the pleading face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I come.&rdquo; And, without another
    word she sprang out of the boat, clasped her arms round Alrema&rsquo;s neck,
    and uttering a curse with her last breath, dragged her enemy to death with
    her beneath the water.</p>

    The Brew of Death</b></h2>
  <p>A fortnight after the last of the tragedies which had marked the life of
    the island dwellers, Christian withdrew himself for ever from all association
    with the rest of the white men, and spent his whole time in the cave, scarce
    speaking even to his now heart-broken wife, though her patient, winning ways
    won from him sometimes a mute caress.</p>
  <p>By day she watched with the tenderest solicitude over her husband&rsquo;s
    lonely wanderings; by night she listened to the strange mutterings which
    broke his sleep; torturing her mind with dread that the end of her brief
    happiness was near.</p>
  <p>The other women still lived in constant fear of some new horror, and when
    the white men&rsquo;s wives had performed their daily round of tasks for
    their husbands&rsquo; homes, they gathered together in the dusk of the evening
    with the widows of the murdered men, and tremblingly asked each other what
    the morrow would bring forth&mdash;would it be death for all? Nothing that
    the white men could say could quiet their fears; and at last in their extremity
    they came to the resolution to poison all the white men who remained,
    lest their masters should plan some new attack upon them.</p>
  <p>But as soon as they had come to this determination, some of them, fearful
    that their plans might miscarry, and their intended victims retaliate upon
    them with some dreadful punishment, secretly informed Young, Smith, McCoy,
    and Quintal of the plot. At first the white men listened incredulously, and
    when they did believe the story they understood that the women had been driven
    to this horrible device through fear alone, and not from any desire for vengeance
    upon their husbands&rsquo; murderers. And so when one by one the plotters
    confessed and begged for forgiveness, Young and the others not only readily
    granted it, but tried hard to persuade them that their terror was groundless.</p>
  <p>Worn with the results of a fever which, soon after the tragic end of his
    wife, had wasted his once great strength and muscular frame, Edward Young
    was now greatly changed. As he listened to the women&rsquo;s tale he raised
    his hands above his head, and swore by their gods and the Christ-God of the
    white men that no harm should come to them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us who are left dwell together in peace,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>With fresh hope kindled in their bosoms, the poor women bent their heads
    to the ground and kissed his feet, and swore to work for and obey him and
    the other white men to the end of their lives.</p>
  <p>So the months went by in quiet and uneventful life, and although the little
    community at the settlement sometimes saw Mahina and her two children, her
    husband never came near them. Twice he and Young met, and the latter&rsquo;s
    face flushed deeply at the memory of the past, but Christian spoke to him
    calmly, without a sign of either anger or bitterness, and then went on his
    way indifferent to all around him.</p>
  <p>Young himself had now so far succeeded in controlling his passion for Mahina
    as to marry the widow of one of the murdered Tahitians, and sought by his
    conduct to make her and the other women feel that their lives were in no
    danger. The terrible fate of Alrema had had a good and lasting effect upon
    his reckless nature, and there now seemed no likelihood of a further tragedy
    breaking the monotony of existence on the lonely island. Christian lived
    entirely in his cave, but occasionally worked with Mahina in the garden of
    their deserted house, and cheerfully gave part of its yield to those of the
    community whose lands were not so fruitful.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Three years passed, then there came a change. One evening McCoy walked over
    to Quintal&rsquo;s house, accompanied by Puni, his Huahine wife. Quintal
    and his wife Malama were rolling into a cylindrical shape a bundle of wild
    tobacco leaf, while their little half-blood son lay asleep.</p>
  <p>Seating himself cross-legged on the matted floor beside his comrade, and
    briefly nodding to Malama, McCoy said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of this damned
    life, Mat; the same round day after day, night after night&mdash;no change,
    no pleasure. Young and Smith don&rsquo;t have much to say to us, and Christian
    is as good as a dead man, for all he has to do with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as tired of it as you are, Bill,&rdquo; answered Quintal; &ldquo;but
    what are we to do? We can&rsquo;t leave here even if we had a good boat&mdash;we
    dare not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I know that well enough; but I&rsquo;ve an idea how we can make
    a life a little pleasanter&mdash;for us two, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you remember once I was telling Brown about a ship&rsquo;s company
    that was cast away at Martinique, or some island near there, who found a
    plant, out of which they made barrels and barrels of good grog?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, this isn&rsquo;t Martinique.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but the same plant grows here. Just before poor Will Brown was
    killed he told me&mdash;it&rsquo;s the thing the women call ti. Why, it&rsquo;s
    growing all over the island&mdash;there&rsquo;s acres of it in the little
    valley at the back of Tautumah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How are we going to make it?&rdquo; said Quintal, with sudden interest.  &ldquo;It
    would be a glorious thing to have a taste of grog again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> copper boiler and my knowledge of
    the thing. I worked in a distillery in Dublin when I was a boy, and it&rsquo;ll
    go hard if I can&rsquo;t make a still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, my hearty. Come on, it&rsquo;s a fine night&mdash;let
    us go and get the copper out of the store house. We&rsquo;ll make a cradle
    for it, and Malama and Puni here can carry it up at once. If you can make
    grog out of ti root I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re a damned clever fellow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A week later McCoy rushed into Quintal&rsquo;s house, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    done, Mat, I&rsquo;ve got good spirit; come and try it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Quintal did try it, not once, but several times. An hour afterwards he and
    his comrade reeled up to Young&rsquo;s house, where Smith was seated at the
    table, receiving instruction in reading and writing from Young. Of late this
    manner of passing their evenings had become a settled thing between them.
    What few books were on board the <i>Bounty</i> when Christian had run her
    ashore had been quietly taken possession of by Smith, and from these, with
    the aid of Young and his own intelligence, he was rapidly improving himself.</p>
  <p>As he and Young sat together at the table their women occupied themselves
    in stitching clothes made from tappa cloth, and as they worked they spoke
    in low tones, lest they should disturb their white husbands.</p>
  <p>With a drunken laugh, McCoy, followed by Quintal, staggered into the dimly-lighted
    room, and, steadying himself with one hand on the table, addressed Young
    and Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come and have a glass of grog, Mr. Young,&rdquo; he hiccoughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, come along and drink confusion to the King, and bring the women
    with you,&rdquo; cried Quintal, leering amiably at Terere and Young&rsquo;s
    wife, who had sprung to their feet in alarm; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good liquor
    we&rsquo;ve got&mdash; none of your <i>Bounty</i> slops, none of Old Grog&rsquo;s
    slush, but the real thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, these fellows are drunk or mad,&rdquo; exclaimed Young, with
    a look of astonishment at Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where could they get drink?&rdquo; answered Smith, looking first
    at one and then at the other. They met his expression of wonder with coarse
    guffaws.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get it! Why, you damned fools, we made it! I made it! What&rsquo;s
    your book learning amount to? It couldn&rsquo;t teach you to make prime liquor
    like it,&rdquo;  said McCoy, who was ready to quarrel with any one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you have found a way of making spirit, it is about the worst thing
    you could have done. You&rsquo;ll kill yourselves with it,&rdquo; said Young,
    who remembered that both McCoy and Quintal were several times punished while
    on the <i>Bounty</i> for drunkenness.</p>
  <p>McCoy answered with a curse, Quintal made a threatening gesture, and a desperate
    quarrel would have ensued, but Smith interfered; and finally, to pacify the
    drunken men, he and Young went across to McCoy&rsquo;s house to taste his
    brewing.</p>
  <p>It was fortunate for both Young and Smith that each conceived a dislike
    for the fiery liquor at the first taste. When McCoy and Quintal, with drunken
    insistence, urged them to make a night of it, and kept swallowing drink after
    drink, the other two surreptitiously threw theirs on the ground. Promising
    to return later on, they at last managed to escape, and get back to their
    frightened wives.</p>
  <p>On the following evening the drunkards, who had slept till near noon, again
    appeared. This time they were so savage in their demeanour, and threatened
    such fearful villainies, that the other two men feared bloodshed, and hid
    themselves with their wives in a thicket near the house. For two days and
    nights the two seamen continued their drinking bout; each evening their drunken
    yells and horrid blasphemies reached even the dwellers in Christian&rsquo;s
    cave, and made Mahina tremblingly press her infant to her bosom.</p>
  <p>On the morning of the third day, McCoy in his frenzy, rushed from his house,
    followed by the equally maddened Quintal, took the path along the edge of
    the cliffs, and, reaching the highest peak, threw himself headlong upon the
    rocks below.</p>
  <p>A hideous laugh of approval came from Quintal as he saw McCoy leap to death,
    then, with a look of insane cunning, muttering and gibbering to himself,
    he returned to the settlement, and went inside his house. There he poured
    out a pannikin of the fiery liquid, and tossed it off; then, picking up an
    axe and a burning brand, set off at a run towards the other houses. His dreadful
    appearance and the wild curses he shouted upon every one sent the Tahitian
    women fleeing before him to seek refuge with Smith and Young, who rushed
    to the doorway and saw the demented creature destroying Williams&rsquo; house
    with his axe. In a few minutes he had utterly wrecked it, and then, flinging
    down his weapon, he advanced towards Young&rsquo;s house, waving the firebrand
    in his hand.</p>
  <p>Apparently unconscious that his movements were watched, he sprang over the
    low stone wall and made straight for the house, looking at the thick drooping
    thatch, and grinning like a fiend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; cried Young, as musket in hand he pushed past
    Smith and the terrified women, and faced Quintal, &ldquo;stand back, Quintal,
    and throw away that firestick, or, as God is above me, I will shoot you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A mocking laugh was the wretch&rsquo;s answer; he staggered past, and seizing
    a bunch of the light, dry thatch in his left hand thrust the firestick into
    its centre.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to burn your&mdash;&rdquo; He never finished, for
    Young, raising his musket, fired, and shot the miserable man dead.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 34<br>
  &ldquo;Try to Forget the Past&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Christian, as soon as he heard of the death of Quintal, bitterly reproached
    himself as the cause; his old brooding manner returned to him in all its
    former intensity, and, nothing that Mahina or Smith said could soften the
    feeling of passionate remorse which now took possession of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God knows, Mr. Christian,&rdquo; said Smith to the mutineer in an
    endeavour to rouse him from his melancholy, &ldquo;you have nothing to reproach
    yourself with. You are not responsible for what led to the death of these
    men. If my musket had been loaded I would have shot Quintal myself; and I
    am no lover of bloodshed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Christian made no answer, but buried his face in his hands; and presently
    Smith, seeing that he seemed to have become unconscious of his presence,
    returned to his house. Descending the ridge he met Young coming up. His face
    was very pale, and Smith saw that he was suffering deeply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t overtax yourself like this, Mr. Young,&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A deep flush dyed Young&rsquo;s sallow face. &ldquo;I am going to Christian.
    Do you think he will see me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith looked at him curiously for a moment, then held out his hand, &ldquo;I
    am sure he will, sir. God knows you have done him bitter wrong, but he said
    to me only the other day, when he was speaking of his wife, that he had too
    many sins upon his own head to judge either you or her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Edward Young&rsquo;s hand trembled a little as he leaned upon his stick;
    and without another word he turned and went towards Christian&rsquo;s cave.</p>
  <p>The dead silence of the place oppressed him, and the sight of Christian&rsquo;s
    figure, as he sat with his hands to his face at the entrance to the cave,
    made him hesitate and shook his resolution, but only for a moment.
    He took a few quick steps and touched the man who had once been his friend
    on the shoulder. Christian raised his head and looked at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have come to you, Christian, for the last time. I am not a sentimental
    fool, but I feel that if you would once more give me your hand and think
    of me, not as the cowardly scoundrel I have proved, but as your old and trusted
    messmate of days gone by, I should be less miserable. I feel that I am a
    dying man&mdash;will you forgive and forget?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Only the sound of Young&rsquo;s panting breath was heard for a few moments,
    and then Fletcher Christian stood up and held out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I forgive you freely, Young. Not for the sake of our comradeship
    in crime, but in the knowledge that I, too, need forgiveness in the sight
    of God for the bloody deeds that my mad folly and hasty temper have brought
    about. There is my hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a little time neither of them spoke. Young, looking at the gaunt figure
    of his old shipmate, was filled with pity.</p>
  <p>His memory flew back to the days at Matavai when the young officer had vanquished
    in friendly contest the picked wrestlers of Tahiti, and Tin&#257; and the
    gentle Aitia had praised his strength and courage. And Christian, as he listened
    to Young&rsquo;s laboured breath and almost whispered tones, knew that his
    time was not far off, yet that for them both there was at least some hope
    of a brighter future, short as it might be.</p>
  <p>Presently Young, with his hand on Christian&rsquo;s shoulder, broke the
    silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us try, old friend, to reconcile ourselves to our lot. I have
    not long to live, but by God&rsquo;s help will try to lead a better life
    than I have done. I think it is Smith&rsquo;s teaching... And so I want you
    to come down to the settlement and live with us again... The men who were
    ever a disturbing influence here are dead&mdash;one by my hand... You alone
    can inspire all that are left of us with hope for the future. What is there
    to keep you from us now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remorse, Young&mdash;the misery of my thoughts&mdash;the constant
    dread&mdash;but there, my dear fellow, leave me to myself. You and Smith
    alone, of all the fated wretches who participated in my villainy, have striven
    to lead decent lives. If the others had been like you, our life here would
    have been different. It is too late now; I cannot bear to think of it. My
    crime was bad enough when I saw it in all its hideousness five minutes after
    that morning off Tofoa, but now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Christian,&rdquo; and Young&rsquo;s voice took a deep earnestness, &ldquo;you
    suffered under Bligh as none of us suffered. I, aye, and Smith too, were
    equally guilty with you and the mutiny was no crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No crime! Is it no crime to have been the murderer of nineteen persons?&mdash;nineteen
    of my fellow-countrymen turned adrift to die of the horrors of hunger and
    thirst in an open boat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They may have reached land.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A faint light came into Christian&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;&ldquo;Young, if I
    could but dare to hope it! God knows I would give my life twenty times over
    to know it. But, even if they did, all England knows the infamy of Fletcher
    Christian, the disgraced mutineer... But what difference does it make? Have
    I not the blood of those who landed here with me upon my soul?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rose from his seat and paced to and fro in the gathering dusk, and Young
    could see that his emotion had for the time mastered him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;try to forget the past. Once
    more I implore you, Christian, to return to the settlement. Your wife&rdquo;&mdash;and
    he turned his face away as he spoke as if fearful that even darkness could
    not hide the burning flush of shame upon his cheeks&mdash;&ldquo;your wife
    is in no fit state to live here. The dreadful loneliness of it is killing
    her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A step sounded near, and the next moment Smith joined them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, indeed, Mr. Christian. She was never a strong woman, and her
    time is near. Surely you will let her come and be tended by our women?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sincerity of the appeals touched him at last. &ldquo;You are right,
    Smith. God bless you, old friends both, for making me think of her a little.
    Yes, we will come and dwell in the settlement till the child is born.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next day Mahina came down from the cavern with a great joy in her heart;
    for the loneliness of her life, even with her husband to watch over her,
    robbed her of both health and strength, and she loved to hear the sound of
    her countrywomen&rsquo;s voices.</p>
  <p>A few weeks afterwards her third child was born; and while the other two
    played with the children of McCoy, Quintal, and Young, Mahina was tenderly
    nursed and cared for by the Tahitians till she grew strong again.</p>
  <p>But soon, unable to conquer his aversion to the society of his fellow-men,
    Christain again left her to return to his cave, bidding her to follow him
    when she was well enough.</p>
  <p align="center">* * *&nbsp;  * * * *</p>
  <p>The first day of the nineteenth century came in as did most days at Pitcairn&mdash;a
    flush of sunlight melting the mists of the mountain tops, piercing the dark
    shades of the wooded valleys with broad blades of golden light, and rousing
    the sleeping rookeries of sea-birds into clamorous life. Long ere the glittering
    dews of the night that hung in beady drops from every leaf and blade of grass
    had quivered and fallen to the first breaths of the trade-wind, Christian
    awoke from his broken slumbers, and was moodily taking his accustomed walk
    along the eastern cliffs.</p>
  <p>What had happened in the world he had left behind? he thought. Was he accounted
    as long since dead? Was there one living soul in all England whose thoughts
    went out to him sometimes? Slowly he paced along buried in thought. When
    he reached the end of his walk he sat on a jutting ledge of rock overhanging
    the boiling surf three hundred feet below, where his eye ranged over the
    wide expanse of sparkling ocean. Day after day, for years he had looked out
    thus upon the bosom of the sailless sea, and had seen nothing but the swift
    flight of the blue-billed kan&aacute;pu and fierce-eyed frigate birds as
    they sailed to and fro or plunged from aerial heights into the deep; or far
    above, the snow-white tropic birds, floating with motionless wing and gazing
    down at the human figure below. Was it likely, he thought, that his refuge
    would ever be discovered? Would&mdash;</p>
  <p>He started to his feet and with dilated eyes looked at the horizon. There,
    clearly within view, were the topgallant sails of a ship!</p>
  <p>Crouching&mdash;he knew not why&mdash;upon his knees, he clutched the ledge
    of rock with shaking hands and watched for nearly a quarter of an hour. The
    trade-wind was fast bringing the ship nearer, and before long her courses
    rose to view. A few minutes more he gazed, then, struck by a sudden impulse,
    he ran along the ledge till he reached the pathway to Bounty Bay.
    He bounded down the steep and fearful descent to where the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> boat
    was hauled up upon rough skids laid down by Young and Smith many months before.
    Old as she was, the boat was not now unseaworthy, as she had been when Nahi
    and the other Tahitian women attempted to escape in her; for Smith had put
    her in a fair state of repair, so that she might be used for fishing when
    the surf did not break too heavily upon the shores of the little bay.</p>
  <p>Christian tugged vainly at the boat and rocked her from side to side in
    an endeavour to start her down the skids; but his strength was not equal
    to the task.</p>
  <p>He ceased his efforts, and then looked seaward, but the ship was not visible
    from where he stood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! for some help,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;but that I cannot,
    dare not seek; neither Young nor Smith must see me.&rdquo; He thought for
    a moment, then with excitement, began again to ascend the path to his cave.
    Panting with his exertions he soon gained the top of the cliffs, and ran
    along the dangerous path till he reached the cavern. He darted inside and
    quickly reappeared with his musket and a block and tackle, which he had often
    used to drag weights to his retreat. With this he hoped to launch the boat
    by making one end of the tackle fast to a point of rock just at the water&rsquo;s
    edge, and the other to her stern ringbolt. The musket he intended to fire
    to attract notice from the ship should other means fail.</p>
  <p>Returning to the beach he was soon exerting all his strength to start the
    heavy little boat down to the water.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter35"></a>Chapter 35<br>
    The Last Shot on Afit&#257;.</b></h2>
  <p>By this time the ship was within three or four miles of the island, and
    had been seen by one of the Tahitian women. She ran back to the settlement,
    and roused the little community to a state of wild excitement by her loud
    cries of &ldquo;A ship! a ship! A ship is coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Soon Young and Smith reached the cliffs, and one glance at the ocean showed
    them the vessel&mdash;a ship of war, they were quick to perceive, by the
    cut of her canvas and her lofty spars.</p>
  <p>Young was scarcely able to walk, and his excitement at first prevented him
    from speaking, but when he could control himself he held a hurried consultation
    with Smith, who then set off for Christian&rsquo;s cave to inform him of
    the ship&rsquo;s approach, while Young returned to the settlement and told
    Mahina to prepare to leave the house and, with the other women, be ready
    to hide herself if necessary.</p>
  <p>They had resolved, as a first step towards safety, that every person on
    the island should assemble near the cavern. The difficulty of access and
    the remoteness of its situation, they thought, would afford them all a safe
    retreat from such people as might land. It was hoped by Young and Smith that,
    unless the vessel was a King&rsquo;s ship specially sent to search for the
    missing mutineers, those who placed foot on shore would not easily discover
    that the island was inhabited. As a first precaution, however, some of the
    women were sent to remove all traces of human occupancy from the two little
    beaches, and to cover up the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> boat with dead coconut
    branches and bushes.</p>
  <p>Four of them departed to do this, while Mahina and her children, with the
    remaining women, set out for Christian&rsquo;s cave.</p>
  <p>But when they reached the cavern they found it deserted by both Christian
    and Smith, and saw that no preparations had been made to defend the narrow
    path leading to the stronghold.</p>
  <p>Frightened at the absence of the two men, the terrified women ran hither
    and thither, calling loudly, and seeking for traces of them; till presently
    Mahina, wildly excited, sped down the path and looked over the edge of the
    cliffs to the beach below. Then a cry of alarm broke from her.</p>
  <p>Beckoning to the others, she flew down the perilous path to the shore. Half-way
    she stumbled and, but for a projecting pinnacle of rock, would have pitched
    headlong to the beach. Before she recovered herself the other women overtook
    her, and were peering down to discover what it was that had so agitated her.
    But from where they clustered together they could see only the billows bursting
    in foam upon the black rocks below; and while they waited for Mahina to explain
    there came the report of a musket from beneath.</p>
  <p>Too far down on their way to turn back, as their fears dictated, Mahina&rsquo;s
    companions stood trembling and hesitating, their hearts filled with an undefined
    apprehension that some fresh tragedy had occurred.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Smith, filled with anxiety for his leader, had hurried along the rocky track
    to Christian&rsquo;s cave. The dreaded hour had arrived at last&mdash;the
    hour that he and the other mutineers had so often feared. A King&rsquo;s
    ship! Yes, she could be no other! His seaman&rsquo;s eye told him she was
    a ship of war. Perhaps she was a Frenchman? That was not likely. She was
    English&mdash;sent to search for them; and even if she were not, she evidently
    intended to send a boat ashore. Once a landing party from the ship ascended
    the cliffs they could not fail to see the houses, and would not take long
    to find those who lived in them. Then would come discovery and a disgraceful
    death.</p>
  <p>But, thought he, Christian will never be taken alive; and even if the presence
    of white men upon the island should be discovered, the cave was hard to find.
    And still, even if the ship were in search of Christian and his companions,
    the identity of the inhabitants might not perhaps be suspected. If the worst
    came to the worst, they could make a fight of it to the death in such a place
    as Christian&rsquo;s stronghold.</p>
  <p>So ran the quick current of his thoughts as he panted up the ridge to the
    cave&mdash;then, with an exclamation of dismay, he saw that it was untenanted.</p>
  <p>As loudly as possible he called Christian&rsquo;s name, but only the countless
    reverberation of his cries answered him from the desolate solitude. A hurried
    glance down the path which he had just ascended showed no human being in
    sight. Surely Christian could not be far off? He must either be coming along
    the ridge and hidden from view, or lying asleep somewhere along the edge
    of the cliffs. Perhaps he had gone to the beach?</p>
  <p>Hastily descending again, Smith struck across to the eastern side of the
    island, till he came to a spot which overlooked Bounty Bay. He knew
    that Christian, in his lonely wanderings, sometimes visited the place, and
    sat for hours upon the wreckage of the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> spars. A thick,
    stunted growth of matted scrub and vines grew to the very edge of the cliffs,
    but hastily pushing through it, the seaman looked down. There, far below,
    he saw the man he sought, bending his tackle to launch the <i>Bounty&rsquo;s</i> boat!</p>
  <p>The next moment, too anxious even to lose time by descending the regular
    path Smith, at the hazard of his life, began to scramble down the almost
    precipitous face of the cliff. At last, with bleeding feet and hands, he
    reached the shore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, Mr. Christian, what are you trying to do?&rdquo; he
    demanded, breathlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What am I trying to do?&rdquo; repeated Christian fiercely&mdash;&ldquo;I
    am about to end it all. That is a King&rsquo;s ship, and I am going to give
    myself up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must be mad to talk like this. Come away at once and let us get
    back to the cave, or we shall all be discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will be your own fault if you are; you and those with you may
    do as you please, but I will board that ship,&rdquo; answered Christian wildly,
    and Smith saw that he was nearly mad with excitement. As he spoke he still
    strained with all his might on the tackle, and the boat, once started, slid
    down the skids till her stern touched the pebbly beach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God, you shan&rsquo;t do this! Our lives as well as yours depend
    upon your hiding with us&rdquo;; and Smith laid his hand on the fall of the
    tackle so as to prevent Christian from unshipping the hook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand back, Smith! Stand back, I say. I swear that no longer shall
    justice go unsatisfied. I will go!&rdquo; As a wave dashed up, the boat lifted
    and floated; he sprang past Smith, jumped in and cast off the tackle.</p>
  <p>Seizing hold of the gunwale, Smith exerted all his strength and drew the
    boat broadside on to the beach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beware, man, beware!&rdquo; and Christian&rsquo;s eyes blazed with
    sudden fury&mdash; &ldquo;let go your hold, I say. I am dangerous!&rdquo; Smith
    recognised it was no time for words; he released his hold, jumped into the
    boat, and threw himself upon the desperate man. They went down together,
    and the boat rocked from side to side with the violence of their struggle.
    No word was spoken, but there was in Christian&rsquo;s face such a look of
    savage determination to overcome his friend, that Smith at last aimed a blow
    at his head, thinking to stun him for a time.</p>
  <p>Nerved with a madman&rsquo;s strength, the blow only seemed to rouse him
    to greater fury; with a mighty effort he freed himself from Smith&rsquo;s
    left arm, which was wound about his waist, and in another moment his hand
    grasped the barrel of the loaded musket, which he drew towards him by the
    muzzle.</p>
  <p>Then Smith again threw himself upon him. There was a short, fierce struggle,
    a report, and Fletcher Christian sank back with a groan&mdash;the ball had
    passed through his chest.</p>
  <p>Sick with horror, Smith staggered to his feet and raised the dying man in
    his arms. He lifted him out of the boat and carried him to the beach, where
    he placed him in a sitting posture; then tearing off his shirt he sought
    to stanch the fearful rush of blood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God, sir! my God, sir! you don&rsquo;t think &rsquo;twas my doing?&rdquo; he
    asked in anguished tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, my good fellow,&rdquo; gasped Christian, &ldquo;you are not
    to blame. My foot must have touched the trigger... I was mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith knelt beside him, overcome with grief and blinded by tears. He took
    his leader&rsquo;s hand in his and tried to speak, but one look at the gaping
    wound told him that the end was near.</p>
  <p>And then there echoed from the cliffs a cry of heart-broken agony. Mahina,
    springing from rock to rock, had reached the overhanging ledge under which
    her husband lay, and, looking down, saw him.</p>
  <p>Leaping to the ground, she turned upon Smith. &ldquo;Thou murderer; thou
    hast slain him!&rdquo; she cried, and pushing him away, threw herself upon
    her knees beside her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, Mahina,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;not so. My foot struck the
    gun... He hath ever been my friend... Listen to me...for in a little time
    I die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slowly and gaspingly the words came, and Mahina, with a sob of misery, saw
    the grey shadows of death dimming the eyes of him she loved so well.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He shall not die; he shall not die!&rdquo; she cried wildly to Smith
    and Young, who had now joined them, and was overcome at the scene before
    him. &ldquo;Save him, save him, lest ye both die accursed!&rdquo; then burst
    into anguished weeping, as she bent her face upon her husband&rsquo;s knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that you, Young?&rdquo; asked Christian faintly&mdash;&ldquo;my
    time is nearly run, old friend,&rdquo; and he put out his brown, sun-tanned
    hand. &ldquo;But, quick; listen to me... Save yourselves while there is yet
    time... The ship must be near now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Young, pressing his hand, &ldquo;she kept off quite
    suddenly when within a mile of the land. I saw her stand away again to the
    westward. In another hour she&rsquo;ll be hull down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Mahina. wife...come closer
    to me...and you, Young and Smith, give me your hands. Promise me that no
    one but yourselves shall ever know where I lie. Let no other white man point
    to my grave and say, &lsquo;Fletcher Christian...mutineer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He ceased, then by a dying effort, opened his arms wide.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mahina! My wife! Mother of my children!...it is all over now,&rdquo; he
    sighed with his last breath, as his arms closed gently round her neck.</p>
  <p>She pressed her cheek to his; his head sank upon her shoulder, and then
    lay there in the quietness of death.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Years later, when Pitcairn was &ldquo;discovered,&rdquo; the venerable man,
    loved and revered by the children of the mutineers under the name of John
    Adams, revealed his identity with Alexander Smith, and tremblingly waited
    to hear his fate from the lips of the naval officers who had landed on the
    island. The story of the death of Young from consumption soon after that
    of Christian, as well as the deaths of the others of the ill-starred company,
    was told by him; though, faithful to his promise, he refused to show his
    leader&rsquo;s last resting-place; and the listeners heard for the first
    time the fate of the <i>Bounty</i> mutineers.</p>
