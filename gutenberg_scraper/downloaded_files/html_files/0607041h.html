<h1>The Troubles Of Australian Federation</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>G. B. Barton</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>THE Commonwealth of Australia has been inaugurated in Sydney with
all the pride, pomp, and circumstance that can be brought to bear on
the occasion. The Earl of Hopetoun, first of a long line of
Governors-General, was welcomed on his official landing on the shores
of Port Jackson by hundreds of thousands of people gathered together
from all parts of this Continent, and from many other corners of the
British dominions. For some time prior to the event the mighty task
of devising the most appropriate forms, functions, and ceremonies,
without regard to expense, had absorbed the energies of the
Government of New South Wales, aided by a Parliamentary and a
citizens' committee, with numerous sectional sub-committees, to say
nothing of a host of newspaper correspondents brim-full of the
silliest possible suggestions for their consideration. With all this
brain-power devoted to the simple object of constructing a gorgeous
pageant, beautifying the city of Sydney, and providing a round of
entertainments during the first week of the year, it would have been
strange indeed if the spectacle then presented did not rival a
Venetian carnival.</p>

<p>One of the most attractive features in the programme will be
contributed by the Imperial Government.</p>

<p>The Duke of York will visit Australia for the special purpose of
opening the first session of the Federal Parliament, and a select
body of troops, to the number of 1,000, chosen from the finest
regiments in the army, and representing every branch of the service,
will form His Royal Highness's guard of honour.</p>

<p>These troops formed part of the procession through the streets of
Sydney on the day of the Earl's official landing; and they were
joined on the march by representative troops from all the federated
colonies, from New Zealand, and also from Canada, including those who
have served with so much distinction in South Africa. The Royal Navy
will also be well represented. In addition to the ships of war
forming the Australian fleet, and the auxiliary squadron, there will
be first-class cruisers and battleships.</p>

<p>Theatrical displays have an irresistible charm for the multitude,
of course, and the multitude will be enthusiastically pleased. But it
is not a cheerful reflection for the student of politics that all
this concentration of thought, power, and purpose, to say nothing of
the money, should be devoted to the single object of amusing a vast
crowd of sightseers. If only a tithe of it were employed on the
solution of the many political problems which lie in wait for the
statesmen of the Federation, there might be something to show for it
in the end. The three primary questions-the Federal tariff, the
Federal capital, and the Federal finance-are complicated enough to
defy all the ingenuity that can be brought to bear on them. As soon
as the various amusements have run out and the crowds have scattered
to their home the serious business of the Commonwealth will have to
be taken in hand. When the writs have been prepared and issued for
the first elections, the people will be overwhelmed with a series of
political discussions, involving bitter party issues, for which no
previous experience will have prepared them. At the present time, for
instance, I anticipate that one of the most commonplace topics of
Australian politics is the degeneracy of the Parliaments and the
general incapacity for sound and prudent administration shown by
successive Ministers. After nearly half a century of responsible
government, it is a dismal fact that it has proved an unmistakable
failure, disappointing all the hopes that were formed of it by its
founders, and entailing upon the people an enormous load of public
debt, with a corresponding burden of taxation.</p>

<p>There is evidence enough and to spare to show that these
statements are not unfounded generalizations. During a general
election which has just been concluded in Victoria a Melbourne daily
journal of great note as the organ of Victorian democracy published a
series of "Papers for the People," in which it reviewed the political
situation of the time. It began with an uncompromising exposure of
parliamentary degeneracy, which it attributed largely to the
corrupting influence exercised by payment of members. This system, by
the way, was introduced in Victoria mainly through the strenuous
advocacy of the journal referred to as one of the most cherished
planks of the democratic platform. The result is seen in the degraded
condition of the average member. He is described as nothing better
than a greedy professional politician, seeking every means of
increasing his salary by the fees and allowances paid to members of
Boards and Royal Commissions, appointed at his instance by
subservient Ministers. His greed for office is not less remarkable
than his lust for gain. There is such a dead level of mediocrity
among the members that one man considers himself quite as capable as
another, and everyone asserts his claim to a portfolio with absolute
confidence in his own merits. The manner in which they attend to
their legislative duties corresponds exactly with the standard of
parliamentary morality they have set up. Most of them never take any
pains to inform themselves on the subjects before the House. For half
the time it is in session there is barely a quorum in attendance, and
when the division bell rings they come trooping in from the
billiard-room, the refreshment bar, the hotel across the street, the
ante-rooms, or other haunts to which they retire in order to escape a
debate. The only business to which they pay any serious attention is
the town agency of their country constituents, which includes all
sorts of commissions and odd jobs, from interviewing a Minister down
to the most ordinary transaction.</p>

<p>Out of such materials as these it is impossible to suppose that
capable and energetic administrators of public affairs can be found.
The Government is of much the same mould and character as the
Parliament from which it is evolved.</p>

<p>One of its distinguishing features is its anxiety to shirk its
proper responsibility on every matter of importance by appointing a
Select Committee, a Board, or a Royal Commission to deal with it. At
least thirty instances of this kind have occurred within the last
year or two, comprising all kinds of inquiries, from Law Reform, Old
Age Pensions, and State Banks, to complaints of personal grievances
and petitions for redress. Some of these questions are manifestly
such as to require considerable technical knowledge; but that makes
no difference, they are handed over as a matter of course to men who
do not even pretend to have any knowledge of the kind. The most
flagrant case in point is that of the Railway Standing Committee, to
which Parliament has entrusted the business of reporting upon all
proposals for the construction of new lines, and also of public works
generally-say a question of water supply. The members who compose
this body know nothing of railway or civil engineering; there are no
experts among them, although they are allowed fees at the rate of
&pound;1 1s. for each sitting, and &pound;1 11s. 6d. for the
chairman. A similar body in New South Wales, by the way, is paid at
the rate of &pound;2 2s. for each sitting, and &pound;3 3s. for the
chairman; and sittings are adjourned from day to day so often that
the fees paid amount to a substantial salary.</p>

<p>This line of criticism was applied to the chief departments of the
public service, and with similar results.</p>

<p>Incapable administration and wasteful expenditure were found to be
their common characteristics, while the theory of parliamentary
responsibility was proved to be a sheer delusion. It is not too much
to say that these strictures might have been directed at the state of
affairs in New South Wales with equal point and accuracy. In that
colony, or State, as we may say now, the same degeneracy has shown
itself in its Parliament. Its members can hardly claim to stand on a
higher level than their neighbours, and the administration of affairs
is open to the same censure. The Parliaments of the other States may
have a better record to show; but whether they have or not, the
question arises, What is the prospect before us with respect to a
Federal Parliament?</p>

<p>Every country, it is said, is governed as well as it deserves to
be; and since the same electors who have deliberately returned these
corrupt and time-serving politicians to represent them will choose
the members of the Federal Parliament, is it to be supposed that they
will return men of a higher class to represent them in its two
Houses? There is no difference in the franchise, and there are no
conditions to be met by candidates other than those existing under
the present system. There is nothing to show that candidates at the
Federal elections will be materially different, in point of character
and capacity, from those who have so often hoodwinked the provincial
electors. Laws have been proposed, and will probably be passed, to
prohibit dual representation, so that no one will be allowed to hold
seats in the Federal and provincial Parliaments at the same time.
There are indications, too, that the few able and experienced men in
the latter will sever their connection with them in order to confine
their attention to Federal politics and posts of honour. That, of
course, would mean the perpetuation of provincial degeneracy.</p>

<p>The one thing needed in order to realize the dreams of Federal
enthusiasts is a complete revolution in the character of Australian
politics and politicians, and without that there seems very little
prospect of the new order of things being much better than the old.
The appearance of a higher order of candidates than those we have
been so long accustomed to would certainly give confidence in the
future of the Federation; but up to the present time there is no
reason to suppose that the type of representative so much needed is
likely to be seen in practice. There is a special reason for a
thorough change in the character of our representatives, and a
remodelling of our legislative methods. For nearly ten years past
each of these Parliaments has been dominated by a small section of
its members, known as the Labour Party, mostly men of the working
class, elected for the sole purpose of advocating and enforcing their
class interests. This purpose they have succeeded in effecting to
their hearts' desire. Forming a third party in the House, and acting
independently, they have held the balance of power in their hands,
and have given their support to Ministers on the single condition
that their policy is embodied in the Ministerial programme. Each
Ministry in its turn depends for its very existence on the votes of
this section. However powerful or popular a Premier may be in the
country, his position is no better than that of Faust with
Mephistopheles at his elbow.</p>

<p>This condition of affairs is inexpressibly degrading to Parliament
and Government alike, since both are deprived of their independence.
While it is undoubtedly right that the working classes should be
represented in the Legislature, it is not right that they should be
in a position, simply through the weakness of party government, to
exercise a controlling influence of this character over the
legislation of the country. They insist on "majority rule" as their
basic principle; but, tested by it, they form but one-sixth of the
total number of electors in New South Wales, and probably not more in
the other colonies.</p>

<p>The largest number of representatives they have been able to
return is twenty-two in a House of 125 members. Under normal
conditions their votes would be of no great account, but when it
happens, as it generally does, that the rest of the House is about
equally divided, they hold the key of the situation, and make or
unmake Ministries at their pleasure.</p>

<p>And yet, despite the obvious dangers arising from the tyranny of a
class, the other sections of the community-representing as they do
the various producing and commercial interests, and consequently the
stability and prosperity of the country-cannot shake off the apathy
with which they have regarded the situation from the first. Conscious
as they must be of their own political strength if they should choose
to exert it, they prefer to remain inactive, and to leave their
representation in the hands of the professional politicians who have
consistently betrayed them. It needs only a glance at the course of
recent legislation to see the necessity for immediate action, in
order to avert the disasters with which the country is threatened. At
the dictation of the Labour Party the electoral laws have been
re-cast, in order to strip property-holders of their plural votes and
establish the principle of One Man, One Vote; the colony has been
divided into single electorates, in order to facilitate the return of
democratic candidates; and now the suffrage is about to be conferred
on women, as it has been in South Australia and Western Australia,
without anything to show that the great majority of them desire to
have it. In the same manner the system of taxation has been altered,
in order to shift the burden as much as possible from the poor to the
rich. Customs' duties, never felt to be oppressive, have been
removed, and their place supplied by land and income taxes, the
latter undoubtedly inquisitorial and obnoxious to all whose incomes
exceed &pound;200 a year. At the same behest the laws regulating the
relations of employer and employed have been revised entirely in the
interest of the latter. The climax has now been reached in an
Arbitration Bill, which proposes to set up a court with power to
enforce its awards against employers, virtually placing them at the
mercy of the trade unions, whose liability in case of defeat is said
to be mythical. Not the least of these triumphs has been achieved by
simple thumb-pressure on Ministers. A minimum rate of seven shillings
a day has been fixed as the amount of wages to be paid to labourers
on all contracts for the public service, one result of which is that
employers in the country districts find it increasingly difficult to
obtain labour.</p>

<p>There cannot be any cause for wonder, in the face of such facts as
these, that the leaders of this omnipotent party should openly boast
of their successes, and proclaim their intention to repeat in the
Federal Parliament the tactics which have won such victories in the
States. They have already opened their campaign in New South Wales,
where they confidently expect to secure five or six seats in the
House of Representatives, which will number seventy-six. Supposing
that an equal proportion of seats should be obtained in the other
States, their combined strength would certainly place them in a
position to hold the fate of every Federal Government in their hands.
Their programme would include, in addition to more class legislation,
several amendments in the Federal Constitution for the purpose of
enabling them to make what alteration they pleased in it by the votes
of a simple majority on a Referendum. The spirit in which they have
entered on the campaign may be seen in the words of one of their
members, in a speech delivered at a recent meeting of the Political
Labour League. He declared that "the working classes during the past
five years had shown the country that they were masters of the
situation. Prime Ministers had been taught that their lease of power
would only last with their fidelity in regard to the demands of the
workers. They had revolutionized the politics of the country. Some of
the enthusiastic advocates of the Federation Bill believed that they
were going to abolish the Labour Party, and it was the desire of that
party to defeat that object, and break down beyond restoration the
old r&eacute;gime which reigned a few years ago."</p>

<p>A striking instance of the power exercised by this section was
seen towards the end of last year, when five out of the six
Australian Governments were displaced by their votes. Their defeat
was attributed to the anti-democratic action of the Premiers during
the two Referendum campaigns on the Federation Bill, the second of
which took place in the previous June. On both occasions there had
been a violent contest between the Democratic and Conservative
forces, in which the former suffered a severe defeat, chiefly through
the influence of the Premiers. This was especially the case in New
South Wales, which formed the battlefield of Australian democracy.
The Premier of the time (Mr. Reid) was the first to go under, and the
votes which destroyed his Government were those of the Labour Party,
to whom he owed his five years of office and his Jubilee honours. The
votes were given on a question which had nothing to do with
federation; but it served the purpose of the Democrats just as
well-indeed, much better-because it deprived their unexpected
hostility of any appearance of revenge.</p>

<p>To understand their action, it is necessary to recollect that all
through the sittings of the Convention he acted as the advocate of
their principles, notably in connection with the provisions of the
Bill for securing "majority rule" in disputes between the two Houses,
and also on a Referendum on any proposed amendment of the
Constitution. On the former question the Convention agreed, mainly at
his instance, to a clause for the prevention of deadlocks. It
provided that, in the event of a Bill being rejected by the Senate a
second time, after an interval of three months, that body, although
elected for six years on the rotation principle, might be dissolved
at the same time as the House, elected for three; and, further, that
after their re-election a joint sitting should take place if they
again disagreed, at which the question should be decided by a
three-fifths majority.</p>

<p>This proposal, however, proved to be utterly distasteful to the
Democrats, who insisted that a three-fifths majority would mean the
defeat of the House on every division, and consequently of majority
rule.</p>

<p>To prevent such a disaster, they demanded the substitution of a
simple majority, and carried their point in the New South Wales
Assembly when the question of amendments in the Bill was under
discussion.</p>

<p>At a conference of the Premiers held in Melbourne, in January,
1899, at Mr. Reid's instance, to consider this and other amendments,
he endeavoured to get a simple majority in place of a three-fifths
one. The other Premiers, however, substituted an absolute majority of
both Houses, and the Bill was finally so amended.</p>

<p>So far from pacifying his imperious supporters, this last
amendment served only to inflame their discontent. The hubbub grew
louder and louder. "Majority rule is in danger," they cried, and as
the day fixed for the final Referendum approached, every Democrat in
town and country was adjured to vote against the Bill. At their
instance a public holiday was proclaimed, and electors' rights were
issued to all who applied for them, whether their names were on the
rolls or not, in order that "the manhood of the country" might decide
the event.</p>

<p>Although it might seem obvious enough that the dead-lock
provisions, even with a three-fifths majority, placed the Senate at
the mercy of the House, the Democrats contended that the House would
be defeated whenever a trial of strength should take place between
the two. They worked out the sum in this fashion. Supposing that
there should be six colonies in the federation-as there are-the
number of members allotted to each would be as follows:</p>

<pre>
                  House of Representatives.   Senate.
New South Wales         26                      6
Victoria                23                      6
Queensland              10                      6
South Australia          7                      6
West Australia           5                      6
Tasmania                 5                      6

                        76                     36

Total 112
</pre>

<p>A three-fifths majority of 112 being sixty-eight, it follows that the
sixty-one members representing the two largest colonies, with a
united population of over 2,500,000, would be defeated by the
fifty-one members representing the four smaller, with a joint
population of, say, 1,200,000. They would be seven votes short on a
division. On the other hand, although it is not less clear that, with
an absolute majority in place of a three-fifths one, the sixty-one
members would have a majority of ten over their fifty-one opponents,
they assumed that the representatives of the larger States would
always be caught napping by those of the smaller.</p>

<p>The main source of their dissatisfaction lay in the principle of
equal State representation in the Senate, undoubtedly one of the
radical defects in the Constitution. The stock arguments in its
favour as a basis of union made no impression on them. They were not
reconciled to it by the fact that the State of Nevada, with 45,000
people, has equal voting power in the Senate of the United States
with that of New York, notwithstanding its 6,000,000 inhabitants.
Majority rule is their basic principle, and without absolute
safeguards for it, they would view with suspicion any constitution,
however liberal it might be in other respects. The fact that the
island of Tasmania, with a population of 170,000, is to enjoy the
same voting strength in the Senate as New South Wales with 1,450,000,
amounts, they say, to giving one man in the former eight times the
voting power of one in the latter.</p>

<p>The result of the polling at the last Referendum proved a still
bitterer pill for them. Notwithstanding their vigorous and
well-organized efforts to defeat the Bill, it had a majority of
25,000 in New South Wales, and that majority might have been more
than doubled had it not been for the opposition of a strong
Conservative section, who objected to the financial clauses of the
measure. The Labour Party was utterly routed. The defeat was hard to
endure, but it might have been endured with some patience had it not
been attributable so largely to the double-dealing of their
once-trusted leader. To grasp the prize of the Federal Premiership,
he threw all his democratic professions to the winds, and appeared on
the platform as the eloquent and earnest champion of a measure which
they regard as undermining the first principles of democracy.</p>

<p>The sore humiliation from which they suffered in the defection of
their too versatile chief was not the only unpleasant experience they
had to put up with. They were equally deceived and disappointed in
the working of the Referendum. Looking upon it as an infallible
weapon of offence, they saw it easily turned against them, and used
with deadly effect against their own ranks. When it came to a trial
of strength between them and the rest of the population, they proved
to be in a hopeless minority. It was not in human nature that
disappointments of this kind should be tamely endured, still less
forgotten, by fighting politicians, and it speaks well for their
organization and tactical skill that they should have been able, in
the face of such crushing defeats, to possess their souls in patience
until the whirligig of time brought in his revenges. Now it remains
to be seen whether the Federal Parliament and Government are destined
to pass under their control, and with them the Constitution
itself.</p>
