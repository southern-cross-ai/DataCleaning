  <h3>A BRAN MAK MORN &amp; KULL STORY</h3>

<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h2>

<p class="first">LIKE the Conan epos, the stories featuring King Kull are set in a pseudo-historical period that Robert E. Howard called the "Hyborian Age." He described this era in some detail in an essay published under the homonymous title in the February 1936 issue of <i>The Phantagraph</i>. The following excerpts provide a context for the present story. The complete essay is available here:
<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0603571h.html">
The Hyborian Age</a></p>
<br>

<p class="quote">"OF that epoch known by the Nemedian chroniclers as the Pre-Cataclysmic Age, little is known except the latter part, and that is veiled in the mists of legendry. Known history begins with the waning of the Pre-Cataclysmic civilization, dominated by the kingdoms of Kamelia, Valusia, Verulia, Grondar, Thule and Commoria. These peoples spoke a similar language, arguing a common origin. There were other kingdoms, equally civilized, but inhabited by different, and apparently older races.</p>

<p class="quote">"The barbarians of that age were the Picts, who lived on islands far out on the western ocean; the Atlanteans, who dwelt on a small continent between the Pictish Islands and the main, or Thurian Continent; and the Lemurians, who inhabited a chain of large islands in the eastern hemisphere.</p>

<p class="quote">"There were vast regions of unexplored land. The civilized kingdoms, though enormous in extent, occupied a comparatively small portion of the whole planet. Valusia was the western-most kingdom of the Thurian Continent; Grondar the eastern-most. East of Grondar, whose people were less highly cultured than those of their kindred kingdoms, stretched a wild and barren expanse of deserts. Among the less arid stretches of desert, in the jungles, and among the mountains, lived scattered clans and tribes of primitive savages. Far to the south there was a mysterious civilization, unconnected with the Thurian culture, and apparently pre-human in its nature. On the far-eastern shores of the Continent there lived another race, human, but mysterious and non-Thurian, with which the Lemurians from time to time came in contact. They apparently came from a shadowy and nameless continent lying somewhere east of the Lemurian Islands.</p>

<p class="quote">"The Thurian civilization was crumbling; their armies were composed largely of barbarian mercenaries. Picts, Atlanteans and Lemurians were their generals, their statesmen, often their kings. Of the bickerings of the kingdoms, and the wars between Valusia and Commoria, as well as the conquests by which the Atlanteans founded a kingdom on the mainland, there were more legends than accurate history."</p>

<h2><a id="kings1" name="kings1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:38%">
  The Caesar lolled on his ivory throne&mdash;<br>
  His iron legions came<br>
  To break a king in a land unknown,<br>
  And a race without a name.<br>
  &mdash;The Song of Bran</p><br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THE dagger flashed downward. A sharp cry broke
in a gasp. The form on the rough altar twitched convulsively and
lay still. The jagged flint edge sawed at the crimsoned breast,
and thin bony fingers, ghastly dyed, tore out the still-twitching heart. Under matted white brows, sharp eyes gleamed
with a ferocious intensity.</p>

<p>Besides the slayer, four men stood about the crude pile of
stones that formed the altar of the God of Shadows. One was of
medium height, lithely built, scantily clad, whose black hair was
confined by a narrow iron band in the center of which gleamed a
single red jewel. Of the others, two were dark like the first.
But where he was lithe, they were stocky and misshapen, with
knotted limbs, and tangled hair falling over sloping brows. His
face denoted intelligence and implacable will; theirs merely a
beast-like ferocity. The fourth man had little in common with the
rest. Nearly a head taller, though his hair was black as theirs,
his skin was comparatively light and he was gray-eyed. He eyed
the proceedings with little favor.</p>

<p>And, in truth, Cormac of Connacht was little at ease. The
Druids of his own isle of Erin had strange dark rites of worship,
but nothing like this. Dark trees shut in this grim scene, lit by
a single torch. Through the branches moaned an eerie night-wind.
Cormac was alone among men of a strange race and he had just seen
the heart of a man ripped from his still pulsing body. Now the
ancient priest, who looked scarcely human, was glaring at the
throbbing thing. Cormac shuddered, glancing at him who wore the
jewel. Did Bran Mak Morn, king of the Picts, believe that this
white-bearded old butcher could foretell events by scanning a
bleeding human heart? The dark eyes of the king were inscrutable.
There were strange depths to the man that Cormac could not
fathom, nor any other man.</p>

<p>"The portents are good!" exclaimed the priest wildly, speaking
more to the two chieftains than to Bran. "Here from the pulsing
heart of a captive Roman I read&mdash;defeat for the arms of
Rome! Triumph for the sons of the heather!"</p>

<p>The two savages murmured beneath their breath, their fierce
eyes smoldering.</p>

<p>"Go and prepare your clans for battle," said the king, and
they lumbered away with the ape-like gait assumed by such stunted
giants. Paying no more heed to the priest who was examining the
ghastly ruin on the altar, Bran beckoned to Cormac. The Gael
followed him with alacrity. Once out of that grim grove, under
the starlight, he breathed more freely. They stood on an
eminence, looking out over long swelling undulations of gently
waving heather. Near at hand a few fires twinkled, their fewness
giving scant evidence of the hordes of tribesmen who lay close
by. Beyond these were more fires and beyond these still more,
which last marked the camp of Cormac's own men, hard-riding,
hard-fighting Gaels, who were of that band which was just
beginning to get a foothold on the western coast of
Caledonia&mdash;the nucleus of what was later to become the
kingdom of Dalriadia. To the left of these, other fires
gleamed.</p>

<p>And far away to the south were more fires&mdash;mere pinpoints
of light. But even at that distance the Pictish king and his
Celtic ally could see that these fires were laid out in regular
order.</p>

<p>"The fires of the legions," muttered Bran. "The fires that
have lit a path around the world. The men who light those fires
have trampled the races under their iron heels. And now&mdash;we
of the heather have our backs at the wall. What will fall on the
morrow?"</p>

<p>"Victory for us, says the priest," answered Cormac.</p>

<p>Bran made an impatient gesture. "Moonlight on the ocean. Wind
in the fir tops. Do you think that I put faith in such mummery?
Or that I enjoyed the butchery of a captive legionary? I must
hearten my people; it was for Gron and Bocah that I let old Gonar
read the portents. The warriors will fight better."</p>

<p>"And Gonar?"</p>

<p>Bran laughed. "Gonar is too old to believe&mdash;anything. He
was high priest of the Shadows a score of years before I was
born. He claims direct descent from that Gonar who was a wizard
in the days of Brule the Spear-slayer who was the first of my
line. No man knows how old he is&mdash; sometimes I think he is
the original Gonar himself!"</p>

<p>"At least," said a mocking voice, and Cormac started as a dim
shape appeared at his side, "at least I have learned that in
order to keep the faith and trust of the people, a wise man must
appear to be a fool. I know secrets that would blast even your
brain, Bran, should I speak them. But in order that the people
may believe in me, I must descend to such things as they think
proper magic&mdash;and prance and yell and rattle snakeskins, and
dabble about in human blood and chicken livers."</p>

<p>Cormac looked at the ancient with new interest. The semi-madness of his appearance had vanished. He was no longer the
charlatan, the spell-mumbling shaman. The starlight lent him a
dignity which seemed to increase his very height, so that he
stood like a white-bearded patriarch.</p>

<p>"Bran, your doubt lies there." The lean arm pointed to the
fourth ring of fires.</p>

<p>"Aye," the king nodded gloomily. "Cormac&mdash;you know as
well as I. Tomorrow's battle hinges upon that circle of fires.
With the chariots of the Britons and your own Western horsemen,
our success would be certain, but &mdash;surely the devil himself
is in the heart of every Northman! You know how I trapped that
band&mdash;how they swore to fight for me against Rome! And now
that their chief, Rognar, is dead, they swear that they will be
led only by a king of their own race! Else they will break their
vow and go over to the Romans. Without them we are doomed, for we
can not change our former plan."</p>

<p>"Take heart, Bran," said Gonar. "Touch the jewel in your iron
crown. Mayhap it will bring you aid."</p>

<p>Bran laughed bitterly. "Now you talk as the people think. I am
no fool to twist with empty words. What of the gem? It is a
strange one, truth, and has brought me luck ere now. But I need
now no jewels, but the allegiance of three hundred fickle
Northmen who are the only warriors among us who may stand the
charge of the legions on foot."</p>

<p>"But the jewel, Bran, the jewel!" persisted Gonar.</p>

<p>"Well, the jewel!" cried Bran impatiently. "It is older than
this world. It was old when Atlantis and Lemuria sank into the
sea. It was given to Brule, the Spear-slayer, first of my line,
by the Atlantean Kull, king of Valusia, in the days when the
world was young. But shall that profit us now?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?" asked the wizard obliquely. "Time and space exist
not. There was no past, and there shall be no future. NOW is all.
All things that ever were, are, or ever will be, transpire
<i>now</i>. Man is forever at the center of what we call time and
space. I have gone into yesterday and tomorrow and both were as
real as today&mdash;which is like the dreams of ghosts! But let
me sleep and talk with Gonar. Mayhap he shall aid us."</p>

<p>"What means he?" asked Cormac, with a slight twitching of his
shoulders, as the priest strode away in the shadows.</p>

<p>"He has ever said that the first Gonar comes to him in his
dreams and talks with him," answered Bran. "I have seen him
perform deeds that seemed beyond human ken. I know not. I am but
an unknown king with an iron crown, trying to lift a race of
savages out of the slime into which they have sunk. Let us look
to the camps."</p>

<p><br>
AS they walked Cormac wondered. By what strange freak of fate
had such a man risen among this race of savages, survivors of a
darker, grimmer age? Surely he was an atavism, an original type
of the days when the Picts ruled all Europe, before their
primitive empire fell before the bronze swords of the Gauls.
Cormac knew how Bran, rising by his own efforts from the
negligent position of the son of a Wolf clan chief, had to an
extent united the tribes of the heather and now claimed kingship
over all Caledon. But his rule was loose and much remained before
the Pictish clans would forget their feuds and present a solid
front to foreign foes. On the battle of the morrow, the first
pitched battle between the Picts under their king and the Romans,
hinged the future of the rising Pictish kingdom.</p>

<p>Bran and his ally walked through the Pictish camp where the
swart warriors lay sprawled about their small fires, sleeping or
gnawing half-cooked food. Cormac was impressed by their silence.
A thousand men camped here, yet the only sounds were occasional
low guttural intonations. The silence of the Stone Age rested in
the souls of these men.</p>

<p>They were all short&mdash;most of them crooked of limb. Giant
dwarfs; Bran Mak Morn was a tall man among them. Only the older
men were bearded and they scantily, but their black hair fell
about their eyes so that they peered fiercely from under the
tangle. They were barefoot and clad scantily in wolfskins. Their
arms consisted in short barbed swords of iron, heavy black bows,
arrows tipped with flint, iron and copper, and stone-headed
mallets. Defensive armor they had none, save for a crude shield
of hide-covered wood; many had worked bits of metal into their
tangled manes as a slight protection against sword-cuts. Some
few, sons of long lines of chiefs, were smooth-limbed and lithe
like Bran, but in the eyes of all gleamed the unquenchable
savagery of the primeval.</p>

<p>These men are fully savages, thought Cormac, worse than the
Gauls, Britons and Germans. Can the old legends be
true&mdash;that they reigned in a day when strange cities rose
where now the sea rolls? And that they survived the flood that
washed those gleaming empires under, sinking again into that
savagery from which they once had risen?</p>

<p>Close to the encampment of the tribesmen were the fires of a
group of Britons&mdash;members of fierce tribes who lived south
of the Roman Wall but who dwelt in the hills and forests to the
west and defied the power of Rome. Powerfully built men they
were, with blazing blue eyes and shocks of tousled yellow hair,
such men as had thronged the Ceanntish beaches when Caesar
brought the Eagles into the Isles. These men, like the Picts,
wore no armor, and were clad scantily in coarse-worked cloth and
deerskin sandals. They bore small round bucklers of hard wood,
braced with bronze, to be worn on the left arm, and long heavy
bronze swords with blunt points. Some had bows, though the
Britons were indifferent archers. Their bows were shorter than
the Picts' and effective only at close range. But ranged close by
their fires were the weapons that had made the name Briton a word
of terror to Pict, Roman and Norse raider alike. Within the
circle of firelight stood fifty bronze chariots with long cruel
blades curving out from the sides. One of these blades could
dismember half a dozen men at once. Tethered close by under the
vigilant eyes of their guards grazed the chariot horses&mdash;
big, rangy steeds, swift and powerful.</p>

<p>"Would that we had more of them!" mused Bran. "With a thousand
chariots and my bowmen I could drive the legions into the
sea."</p>

<p>"The free British tribes must eventually fall before Rome,"
said Cormac. "It would seem they would rush to join you in your
war."</p>

<p>Bran made a helpless gesture. "The fickleness of the Celt.
They can not forget old feuds. Our ancient men have told us how
they would not even unite against Caesar when the Romans first
came. They will not make head against a common foe together.
These men came to me because of some dispute with their chief,
but I can not depend on them when they are not actually
fighting."</p>

<p>Cormac nodded. "I know; Caesar conquered Gaul by playing one
tribe against another. My own people shift and change with the
waxing and waning of the tides. But of all Celts, the Cymry are
the most changeable, the least stable. Not many centuries ago my
own Gaelic ancestors wrested Erin from the Cymric Danaans,
because though they outnumbered us, they opposed us as separate
tribes, rather than as a nation."</p>

<p>"And so these Cymric Britons face Rome," said Bran. "These
will aid us on the morrow. Further I can not say. But how shall I
expect loyalty from alien tribes, who am not sure of my own
people? Thousands lurk in the hills, holding aloof. I am king in
name only. Let me win tomorrow and they will flock to my
standard; if I lose, they will scatter like birds before a cold
wind."</p>

<p><br>
A CHORUS of rough welcome greeted the two leaders as they
entered the camp of Cormac's Gaels. Five hundred in number they
were, tall rangy men, black-haired and gray-eyed mainly, with the
bearing of men who lived by war alone. While there was nothing
like close discipline among them, there was an air of more system
and practical order than existed in the lines of the Picts and
Britons. These men were of the last Celtic race to invade the
Isles and their barbaric civilization was of much higher order
than that of their Cymric kin. The ancestors of the Gaels had
learned the arts of war on the vast plains of Scythia and at the
courts of the Pharaohs where they had fought as mercenaries of
Egypt, and much of what they learned they brought into Ireland
with them. Excelling in metal work, they were armed, not with
clumsy bronze swords, but with high-grade weapons of iron.</p>

<p>They were clad in well-woven kilts and leathern sandals. Each
wore a light shirt of chain mail and a vizorless helmet, but this
was all of their defensive armor. Celts, Gaelic or Brythonic,
were prone to judge a man's valor by the amount of armor he wore.
The Britons who faced Caesar deemed the Romans cowards because
they cased themselves in metal, and many centuries later the
Irish clans thought the same of the mail-clad Norman knights of
Strongbow.</p>

<p>Cormac's warriors were horsemen. They neither knew nor
esteemed the use of the bow. They bore the inevitable round,
metal-braced buckler, dirks, long straight swords and light
single-handed axes. Their tethered horses grazed not far
away&mdash;big-boned animals, not so ponderous as those raised by
the Britons, but swifter.</p>

<p>Bran's eyes lighted as the two strode through the camp. "These
men are keen-beaked birds of war! See how they whet their axes
and jest of the morrow! Would that the raiders in yon camp were
as staunch as your men, Cormac! Then would I greet the legions
with a laugh when they come up from the south tomorrow."</p>

<p>They were entering the circle of the Northmen fires. Three
hundred men sat about gambling, whetting their weapons and
drinking deep of the heather ale furnished them by their Pictish
allies. These gazed upon Bran and Cormac with no great
friendliness. It was striking to note the difference between them
and the Picts and Celts&mdash;the difference in their cold eyes,
their strong moody faces, their very bearing. Here was ferocity,
and savagery, but not of the wild, upbursting fury of the Celt.
Here was fierceness backed by grim determination and stolid
stubbornness. The charge of the British clans was terrible,
overwhelming. But they had no patience; let them be balked of
immediate victory and they were likely to lose heart and scatter
or fall to bickering among themselves. There was the patience of
the cold blue North in these seafarers&mdash;a lasting
determination that would keep them steadfast to the bitter end,
once their face was set toward a definite goal.</p>

<p>As to personal stature, they were giants; massive yet rangy.
That they did not share the ideas of the Celts regarding armor
was shown by the fact that they were clad in heavy scale mail
shirts that reached below mid-thigh, heavy horned helmets and
hardened hide leggings, reinforced, as were their shoes, with
plates of iron. Their shields were huge oval affairs of hard
wood, hide and brass. As to weapons, they had long iron-headed
spears, heavy iron axes, and daggers. Some had long wide-bladed
swords.</p>

<p>Cormac scarcely felt at ease with the cold magnetic eyes of
these flaxen-haired men fixed upon him. He and they were
hereditary foes, even though they did chance to be fighting on
the same side at present&mdash;but were they?</p>

<p>A man came forward, a tall gaunt warrior on whose scarred,
wolfish face the flickering firelight reflected deep shadows.
With his wolfskin mantle flung carelessly about his wide
shoulders, and the great horns on his helmet adding to his
height, he stood there in the swaying shadows, like some half-human thing, a brooding shape of the dark barbarism that was soon
to engulf the world.</p>

<p>"Well, Wulfhere," said the Pictish king, "you have drunk the
mead of council and have spoken about the fires&mdash;what is
your decision?"</p>

<p>The Northman's eyes flashed in the gloom. "Give us a king of
our own race to follow if you wish us to fight for you."</p>

<p>Bran flung out his hands. "Ask me to drag down the stars to
gem your helmets! Will not your comrades follow you?"</p>

<p>"Not against the legions," answered Wulfhere sullenly. "A king
led us on the Viking path&mdash;a king must lead us against the
Romans. And Rognar is dead."</p>

<p>"I am a king," said Bran. "Will you fight for me if I stand at
the tip of your fight wedge?"</p>

<p>"A king of our own race," said Wulfhere doggedly. "We are all
picked men of the North. We fight for none but a king, and a king
must lead us&mdash; against the legions."</p>

<p>Cormac sensed a subtle threat in this repeated phrase.</p>

<p>"Here is a prince of Erin," said Bran. "Will you fight for the
Westerner?"</p>

<p>"We fight under no Celt, West or East," growled the Viking,
and a low rumble of approval rose from the onlookers. "It is
enough to fight by their side."</p>

<p>The hot Gaelic blood rose in Cormac's brain and he pushed past
Bran, his hand on his sword. "How mean you that, pirate?"</p>

<p>Before Wulfhere could reply Bran interposed: "Have done! Will
you fools throw away the battle before it is fought, by your
madness? What of your oath, Wulfhere?"</p>

<p>"We swore it under Rognar; when he died from a Roman arrow we
were absolved of it. We will follow only a king&mdash;against the
legions."</p>

<p>"But your comrades will follow you&mdash;against the heather
people!" snapped Bran.</p>

<p>"Aye," the Northman's eyes met his brazenly. "Send us a king
or we join the Romans tomorrow."</p>

<p>Bran snarled. In his rage he dominated the scene, dwarfing the
huge men who towered over him.</p>

<p>"Traitors! Liars! I hold your lives in my hand! Aye, draw your
swords if you will&mdash;Cormac, keep your blade in its sheath.
These wolves will not bite a king! Wulfhere&mdash;I spared your
lives when I could have taken them.</p>

<p>"You came to raid the countries of the South, sweeping down
from the northern sea in your galleys. You ravaged the coasts and
the smoke of burning villages hung like a cloud over the shores
of Caledon. I trapped you all when you were pillaging and
burning&mdash;with the blood of my people on your hands. I burned
your long ships and ambushed you when you followed. With thrice
your number of bowmen who burned for your lives hidden in the
heathered hills about you, I spared you when we could have shot
you down like trapped wolves. Because I spared you, you swore to
come and fight for me."</p>

<p>"And shall we die because the Picts fight Rome?" rumbled a
bearded raider.</p>

<p>"Your lives are forfeit to me; you came to ravage the South. I
did not promise to send you all back to your homes in the North
unharmed and loaded with loot. Your vow was to fight one battle
against Rome under my standard. Then I will aid your survivors to
build ships and you may go where you will, with a goodly share of
the plunder we take from the legions. Rognar had kept his oath.
But Rognar died in a skirmish with Roman scouts and now you,
Wulfhere the Dissension-breeder, you stir up your comrades to
dishonor themselves by that which a Northman hates&mdash;the
breaking of the sworn word."</p>

<p>"We break no oath," snarled the Viking, and the king sensed
the basic Germanic stubbornness, far harder to combat than the
fickleness of the fiery Celts. "Give us a king, neither Pict,
Gael nor Briton, and we will die for you. If not&mdash;then we
will fight tomorrow for the greatest of all kings &mdash;the
emperor of Rome!"</p>

<p><br>
FOR a moment Cormac thought that the Pictish king, in his
black rage, would draw and strike the Northman dead. The
concentrated fury that blazed in Bran's dark eyes caused Wulfhere
to recoil and drop a hand to his belt.</p>

<p>"Fool!" said Mak Morn in a low voice that vibrated with
passion. "I could sweep you from the earth before the Romans are
near enough to hear your death howls. Choose&mdash;fight for me
on the morrow&mdash;or die tonight under a black cloud of arrows,
a red storm of swords, a dark wave of chariots!"</p>

<p>At the mention of the chariots, the only arm of war that had
ever broken the Norse shield-wall, Wulfhere changed expression,
but he held his ground.</p>

<p>"War be it," he said doggedly. "Or a king to lead us!"</p>

<p>The Northmen responded with a short deep roar and a clash of
swords on shields. Bran, eyes blazing, was about to speak again
when a white shape glided silently into the ring of
firelight.</p>

<p>"Soft words, soft words," said old Gonar tranquilly. "King,
say no more. Wulfhere, you and your fellows will fight for us if
you have a king to lead you?"</p>

<p>"We have sworn."</p>

<p>"Then be at ease," quoth the wizard; "for ere battle joins on
the morrow I will send you such a king as no man on earth has
followed for a hundred thousand years! A king neither Pict, Gael
nor Briton, but one to whom the emperor of Rome is as but a
village headman!"</p>

<p>While they stood undecided, Gonar took the arms of Cormac and
Bran. "Come. And you, Northmen, remember your vow, and my promise
which I have never broken. Sleep now, nor think to steal away in
the darkness to the Roman camp, for if you escaped our shafts you
would not escape either my curse or the suspicions of the
legionaries."</p>

<p>So the three walked away and Cormac, looking back, saw
Wulfhere standing by the fire, fingering his golden beard, with a
look of puzzled anger on his lean evil face.</p>

<p><br>
THE three walked silently through the waving heather under the
faraway stars while the weird night wind whispered ghostly
secrets about them.</p>

<p>"Ages ago," said the wizard suddenly, "in the days when the
world was young, great lands rose where now the ocean roars. On
these lands thronged mighty nations and kingdoms. Greatest of all
these was Valusia&mdash;Land of Enchantment. Rome is as a village
compared to the splendor of the cities of Valusia. And the
greatest king was Kull, who came from the land of Atlantis to
wrest the crown of Valusia from a degenerate dynasty. The Picts
who dwelt in the isles which now form the mountain peaks of a
strange land upon the Western Ocean, were allies of Valusia, and
the greatest of all the Pictish war-chiefs was Brule the Spear-slayer, first of the line men call Mak Morn.</p>

<p>"Kull gave to Brule the jewel which you now wear in your iron
crown, oh king, after a strange battle in a dim land, and down
the long ages it has come to us, ever a sign of the Mak Morn, a
symbol of former greatness. When at last the sea rose and
swallowed Valusia, Atlantis and Lemuria, only the Picts survived
and they were scattered and few. Yet they began again the slow
climb upward, and though many of the arts of civilization were
lost in the great flood, yet they progressed. The art of
metalworking was lost, so they excelled in the working of flint.
And they ruled all the new lands flung up by the sea and now
called Europe, until down from the north came younger tribes who
had scarce risen from the ape when Valusia reigned in her glory,
and who, dwelling in the icy lands about the Pole, knew naught of
the lost splendor of the Seven Empires and little of the flood
that had swept away half a world.</p>

<p>"And still they have come&mdash;Aryans, Celts, Germans,
swarming down from the great cradle of their race which lies near
the Pole. So again was the growth of the Pictish nation checked
and the race hurled into savagery. Erased from the earth, on the
fringe of the world with our backs to the wall we fight. Here in
Caledon is the last stand of a once mighty race. And we change.
Our people have mixed with the savages of an elder age which we
drove into the North when we came into the Isles, and now, save
for their chieftains, such as thou, Bran, a Pict is strange and
abhorrent to look upon."</p>

<p>"True, true," said the king impatiently, "but what has that to
do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kull, king of Valusia," said the wizard imperturbably, "was a
barbarian in his age as thou art in thine, though he ruled a
mighty empire by the weight of his sword. Gonar, friend of Brule,
your first ancestor, has been dead a hundred thousand years as we
reckon time. Yet I talked with him a scant hour agone."</p>

<p>"You talked with his ghost&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or he with mine? Did I go back a hundred thousand years, or
did he come forward? If he came to me out of the past, it is not
I who talked with a dead man, but he who talked with a man
unborn. Past, present and future are one to a wise man. I talked
to Gonar while he was alive; likewise was I alive. In a timeless,
spaceless land we met and he told me many things."</p>

<p>The land was growing light with the birth of dawn. The heather
waved and bent in long rows before the dawn wind as bowing in
worship of the rising sun.</p>

<p>"The jewel in your crown is a magnet that draws down the
eons," said Gonar. "The sun is rising&mdash;and who comes out of
the sunrise?"</p>

<p>Cormac and the king started. The sun was just lifting a red
orb above the eastern hills. And full in the glow, etched boldly
against the golden rim, a man suddenly appeared. They had not
seen him come. Against the golden birth of day he loomed
colossal; a gigantic god from the dawn of creation. Now as he
strode toward them the waking hosts saw him and sent up a sudden
shout of wonder.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;or what is it?" exclaimed Bran.</p>

<p>"Let us go to meet him, Bran," answered the wizard. "He is the
king Gonar has sent to save the people of Brule."</p>

<p class="verse" style="margin-left:38%">
"I have reached these lands but newly<br>
From an ultimate dim Thule;<br>
From a wild weird clime that lieth sublime<br>
Out of Space&mdash;out of Time."<br>

<hr>

<p><br>
THE army fell silent as Bran, Cormac and Gonar went toward the
stranger who approached in long swinging strides. As they neared
him the illusion of monstrous size vanished, but they saw he was
a man of great stature. At first Cormac thought him to be a
Northman but a second glance told him that nowhere before had he
seen such a man. He was built much like the Vikings, at once
massive and lithe&mdash;tigerish. But his features were not as
theirs, and his square-cut, lion-like mane of hair was as black
as Bran's own. Under heavy brows glittered eyes gray as steel and
cold as ice. His bronzed face, strong and inscrutable, was clean-shaven, and the broad forehead betokened a high intelligence,
just as the firm jaw and thin lips showed willpower and courage.
But more than all, the bearing of him, the unconscious lion-like
stateliness, marked him as a natural king, a ruler of men.</p>

<p>Sandals of curious make were on his feet and he wore a pliant
coat of strangely meshed mail which came almost to his knees. A
broad belt with a great golden buckle encircled his waist,
supporting a long straight sword in a heavy leather scabbard. His
hair was confined by a wide, heavy golden band about his
head.</p>

<p>Such was the man who paused before the silent group. He seemed
slightly puzzled, slightly amused. Recognition flickered in his
eyes. He spoke in a strange archaic Pictish which Cormac scarcely
understood. His voice was deep and resonant.</p>

<p>"Ha, Brule, Gonar did not tell me I would dream of you!"</p>

<p>For the first time in his life Cormac saw the Pictish king
completely thrown off his balance. He gaped, speechless. The
stranger continued:</p>

<p>"And wearing the gem I gave you, in a circlet on your head!
Last night you wore it in a ring on your finger."</p>

<p>"Last night?" gasped Bran.</p>

<p>"Last night or a hundred thousand years ago&mdash;all one!"
murmured Gonar in evident enjoyment of the situation.</p>

<p>"I am not Brule," said Bran. "Are you mad to thus speak of a
man dead a hundred thousand years? He was first of my line."</p>

<p>The stranger laughed unexpectedly. "Well, now I know I am
dreaming! This will be a tale to tell Brule when I waken on the
morrow! That I went into the future and saw men claiming descent
from the Spear-slayer who is, as yet, not even married. No, you
are not Brule, I see now, though you have his eyes and his
bearing. But he is taller and broader in the shoulders. Yet you
have his jewel&mdash;oh, well&mdash;anything can happen in a
dream, so I will not quarrel with you. For a time I thought I had
been transported to some other land in my sleep, and was in
reality awake in a strange country, for this is the clearest
dream I ever dreamed. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Bran Mak Morn, king of the Caledonian Picts. And this
ancient is Gonar, a wizard, of the line of Gonar. And this
warrior is Cormac na Connacht, a prince of the isle of Erin."</p>

<p>The stranger slowly shook his lion-like head. "These words
sound strangely to me, save Gonar&mdash;and that one is not
Gonar, though he too is old. What land is this?"</p>

<p>"Caledon, or Alba, as the Gaels call it."</p>

<p>"And who are those squat ape-like warriors who watch us
yonder, all agape?"</p>

<p>"They are the Picts who own my rule."</p>

<p>"How strangely distorted folk are in dreams!" muttered the
stranger. "And who are those shock-headed men about the
chariots?"</p>

<p>"They are Britons&mdash;Cymry from south of the Wall."</p>

<p>"What Wall?"</p>

<p>"The Wall built by Rome to keep the people of the heather out
of Britain."</p>

<p>"Britain?" the tone was curious. "I never heard of that
land&mdash;and what is Rome?"</p>

<p>"What!" cried Bran. "You never heard of Rome, the empire that
rules the world?"</p>

<p>"No empire rules the world," answered the other haughtily.
"The mightiest kingdom on Earth is that wherein I reign."</p>

<p>"And who are you?"</p>

<p>"Kull of Atlantis, king of Valusia!"</p>

<p>Cormac felt a coldness trickle down his spine. The cold gray
eyes were unswerving&mdash;but this was
incredible&mdash;monstrous&mdash; unnatural.</p>

<p>"Valusia!" cried Bran. "Why, man, the sea waves have rolled
above the spires of Valusia for untold centuries!"</p>

<p>Kull laughed outright. "What a mad nightmare this is! When
Gonar put on me the spell of deep sleep last night&mdash;or this
night!&mdash;in the secret room of the inner palace, he told me I
would dream strange things, but this is more fantastic than I
reckoned. And the strangest thing is, I know I am dreaming!"</p>

<p>Gonar interposed as Bran would have spoken. "Question not the
acts of the gods," muttered the wizard. "You are king because in
the past you have seen and seized opportunities. The gods or the
first Gonar have sent you this man. Let me deal with him."</p>

<p>Bran nodded, and while the silent army gaped in speechless
wonder, just within earshot, Gonar spoke: "Oh great king, you
dream, but is not all life a dream? How reckon you but that your
former life is but a dream from which you have just awakened? Now
we dream-folk have our wars and our peace, and just now a great
host comes up from the south to destroy the people of Brule. Will
you aid us?"</p>

<p>Kull grinned with pure zest. "Aye! I have fought battles in
dreams ere now, have slain and been slain and was amazed when I
woke from my visions. And at times, as now, dreaming I have known
I dreamed. See, I pinch myself and feel it, but I know I dream
for I have felt the pain of fierce wounds, in dreams. Yes, people
of my dream, I will fight for you against the other dream-folk.
Where are they?"</p>

<p>"And that you enjoy the dream more," said the wizard subtly,
"forget that it is a dream and pretend that by the magic of the
first Gonar, and the quality of the jewel you gave Brule, that
now gleams on the crown of the Morni, you have in truth been
transported forward into another, wilder age where the people of
Brule fight for their life against a stronger foe."</p>

<p>For a moment the man who called himself king of Valusia seemed
startled; a strange look of doubt, almost of fear, clouded his
eyes. Then he laughed.</p>

<p>"Good! Lead on, wizard."</p>

<p>But now Bran took charge. He had recovered himself and was at
ease. Whether he thought, like Cormac, that this was all a
gigantic hoax arranged by Gonar, he showed no sign.</p>

<p>"King Kull, see you those men yonder who lean on their long-shafted axes as they gaze upon you?"</p>

<p>"The tall men with the golden hair and beards?"</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;our success in the coming battle hinges on them.
They swear to go over to the enemy if we give them not a king to
lead them&mdash;their own having been slain. Will you lead them
to battle?"</p>

<p>Kull's eyes glowed with appreciation. "They are men such as my
own Red Slayers, my picked regiment. I will lead them."</p>

<p>"Come then."</p>

<p><br>
THE small group made their way down the slope, through throngs
of warriors who pushed forward eagerly to get a better view of
the stranger, then pressed back as he approached. An undercurrent
of tense whispering ran through the horde.</p>

<p>The Northmen stood apart in a compact group. Their cold eyes
took in Kull and he gave back their stares, taking in every
detail of their appearance.</p>

<p>"Wulfhere," said Bran, "we have brought you a king. I hold you
to your oath."</p>

<p>"Let him speak to us," said the Viking harshly.</p>

<p>"He can not speak your tongue," answered Bran, knowing that
the Northmen knew nothing of the legends of his race. "He is a
great king of the South&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He comes out of the past," broke in the wizard calmly. "He
was the greatest of all kings, long ago."</p>

<p>"A dead man!" The Vikings moved uneasily and the rest of the
horde pressed forward, drinking in every word. But Wulfhere
scowled: "Shall a ghost lead living men? You bring us a man you
say is dead. We will not follow a corpse."</p>

<p>"Wulfhere," said Bran in still passion, "you are a liar and a
traitor. You set us this task, thinking it impossible. You yearn
to fight under the Eagles of Rome. We have brought you a king
neither Pict, Gael nor Briton and you deny your vow!"</p>

<p>"Let him fight me, then!" howled Wulfhere in uncontrollable
wrath, swinging his ax about his head in a glittering arc. "If
your dead man overcomes me&mdash;then my people will follow you.
If I overcome him, you shall let us depart in peace to the camp
of the legions!"</p>

<p>"Good!" said the wizard. "Do you agree, wolves of the
North?"</p>

<p>A fierce yell and a brandishing of swords was the answer. Bran
turned to Kull, who had stood silent, understanding nothing of
what was said. But the Atlantean's eyes gleamed. Cormac felt that
those cold eyes had looked on too many such scenes not to
understand something of what had passed.</p>

<p>"This warrior says you must fight him for the leadership,"
said Bran, and Kull, eyes glittering with growing battle-joy,
nodded: "I guessed as much. Give us space."</p>

<p>"A shield and a helmet!" shouted Bran, but Kull shook his
head.</p>

<p>"I need none," he growled. "Back and give us room to swing our
steel!"</p>

<p><br>
MEN pressed back on each side, forming a solid ring about the
two men, who now approached each other warily. Kull had drawn his
sword and the great blade shimmered like a live thing in his
hand. Wulfhere, scarred by a hundred savage fights, flung aside
his wolfskin mantle and came in cautiously, fierce eyes peering
over the top of his out-thrust shield, ax half-lifted in his
right hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly when the warriors were still many feet apart Kull
sprang. His attack brought a gasp from men used to deeds of
prowess; for like a leaping tiger he shot through the air and his
sword crashed on the quickly lifted shield. Sparks flew and
Wulfhere's ax hacked in, but Kull was under its sweep and as it
swished viciously above his head he thrust upward and sprang out
again, cat-like. His motions had been too quick for the eye to
follow. The upper edge of Wulfhere's shield showed a deep cut,
and there was a long rent in his mail shirt where Kull's sword
had barely missed the flesh beneath.</p>

<p>Cormac, trembling with the terrible thrill of the fight,
wondered at this sword that could thus slice through scale-mail.
And the blow that gashed the shield should have shattered the
blade. Yet not a notch showed in the Valusian steel! Surely this
blade was forged by another people in another age!</p>

<p>Now the two giants leaped again to the attack and like double
strokes of lightning their weapons crashed. Wulfhere's shield
fell from his arm in two pieces as the Atlantean's sword sheared
clear through it, and Kull staggered as the Northman's ax, driven
with all the force of his great body, descended on the golden
circlet about his head. That blow should have sheared through the
gold like butter to split the skull beneath, but the ax
rebounded, showing a great notch in the edge. The next instant
the Northman was overwhelmed by a whirlwind of steel&mdash;a
storm of strokes delivered with such swiftness and power that he
was borne back as on the crest of a wave, unable to launch an
attack of his own. With all his tried skill he sought to parry
the singing steel with his ax. But he could only avert his doom
for a few seconds; could only for an instant turn the whistling
blade that hewed off bits of his mail, so close fell the blows.
One of the horns flew from his helmet; then the ax-head itself
fell away, and the same blow that severed the handle, bit through
the Viking's helmet into the scalp beneath. Wulfhere was dashed
to his knees, a trickle of blood starting down his face.</p>

<p>Kull checked his second stroke, and tossing his sword to
Cormac, faced the dazed Northman weaponless. The Atlantean's eyes
were blazing with ferocious joy and he roared something in a
strange tongue. Wulfhere gathered his legs under him and bounded
up, snarling like a wolf, a dagger flashing into his hand. The
watching horde gave tongue in a yell that ripped the skies as the
two bodies clashed. Kull's clutching hand missed the Northman's
wrist but the desperately lunging dagger snapped on the
Atlantean's mail, and dropping the useless hilt, Wulfhere locked
his arms about his foe in a bear-like grip that would have
crushed the ribs of a lesser man. Kull grinned tigerishly and
returned the grapple, and for a moment the two swayed on their
feet. Slowly the black-haired warrior bent his foe backward until
it seemed his spine would snap. With a howl that had nothing of
the human in it, Wulfhere clawed frantically at Kull's face,
trying to tear out his eyes, then turned his head and snapped his
fang-like teeth into the Atlantean's arm. A yell went up as a
trickle of blood started: "He bleeds! He bleeds! He is no ghost,
after all, but a mortal man!"</p>

<p>Angered, Kull shifted his grip, shoving the frothing Wulfhere
away from him, and smote him terrifically under the ear with his
right hand. The Viking landed on his back a dozen feet away.
Then, howling like a wild man, he leaped up with a stone in his
hand and flung it. Only Kull's incredible quickness saved his
face; as it was, the rough edge of the missile tore his cheek and
inflamed him to madness. With a lion-like roar he bounded upon
his foe, enveloped him in an irresistible blast of sheer fury,
whirled him high above his head as if he were a child and cast
him a dozen feet away. Wulfhere pitched on his head and lay
still&mdash;broken and dead.</p>

<p>Dazed silence reigned for an instant; then from the Gaels went
up a thundering roar, and the Britons and Picts took it up,
howling like wolves, until the echoes of the shouts and the
clangor of sword on shield reached the ears of the marching
legionaries, miles to the south.</p>

<p>"Men of the gray North," shouted Bran, "will you hold by your
oath <i>now</i>?"</p>

<p>The fierce souls of the Northmen were in their eyes as their
spokesman answered. Primitive, superstitious, steeped in tribal
lore of fighting gods and mythical heroes, they did not doubt
that the black-haired fighting man was some supernatural being
sent by the fierce gods of battle.</p>

<p>"Aye! Such a man as this we have never seen! Dead man, ghost
or devil, we will follow him, whether the trail lead to Rome or
Valhalla!"</p>

<p>Kull understood the meaning, if not the words. Taking his
sword from Cormac with a word of thanks, he turned to the waiting
Northmen and silently held the blade toward them high above his
head, in both hands, before he returned it to its scabbard.
Without understanding, they appreciated the action. Bloodstained
and disheveled, he was an impressive picture of stately,
magnificent barbarism.</p>

<p>"Come," said Bran, touching the Atlantean's arm; "a host is
marching on us and we have much to do. There is scant time to
arrange our forces before they will be upon us. Come to the top
of yonder slope."</p>

<p>There the Pict pointed. They were looking down into a valley
which ran north and south, widening from a narrow gorge in the
north until it debouched upon a plain to the south. The whole
valley was less than a mile in length.</p>

<p>"Up this valley will our foes come," said the Pict, "because
they have wagons loaded with supplies and on all sides of this
vale the ground is too rough for such travel. Here we plan an
ambush."</p>

<p>"I would have thought you would have had your men lying in
wait long before now," said Kull. "What of the scouts the enemy
is sure to send out?"</p>

<p>"The savages I lead would never have waited in ambush so
long," said Bran with a touch of bitterness. "I could not post
them until I was sure of the Northmen. Even so I had not dared to
post them ere now&mdash;even yet they may take panic from the
drifting of a cloud or the blowing of a leaf, and scatter like
birds before a cold wind. King Kull&mdash;the fate of the Pictish
nation is at stake. I am called king of the Picts, but my rule as
yet is but a hollow mockery. The hills are full of wild clans who
refuse to fight for me. Of the thousand bowmen now at my command,
more than half are of my own clan.</p>

<p>"Some eighteen hundred Romans are marching against us. It is
not a real invasion, but much hinges upon it. It is the beginning
of an attempt to extend their boundaries. They plan to build a
fortress a day's march to the north of this valley. If they do,
they will build other forts, drawing bands of steel about the
heart of the free people. If I win this battle and wipe out this
army, I will win a double victory. Then the tribes will flock to
me and the next invasion will meet a solid wall of resistance. If
I lose, the clans will scatter, fleeing into the north until they
can no longer flee, fighting as separate clans rather than as one
strong nation.</p>

<p>"I have a thousand archers, five hundred horsemen, fifty
chariots with their drivers and swordsmen&mdash;one hundred fifty
men in all&mdash;and, thanks to you, three hundred heavily armed
Northern pirates. How would you arrange your battle lines?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Kull, "I would have barricaded the north end of
the valley &mdash;no! That would suggest a trap. But I would
block it with a band of desperate men, like those you have given
me to lead. Three hundred could hold the gorge for a time against
any number. Then, when the enemy was engaged with these men to
the narrow part of the valley, I would have my archers shoot down
into them until their ranks are broken, from both sides of the
vale. Then, having my horsemen concealed behind one ridge and my
chariots behind the other, I would charge with both
simultaneously and sweep the foe into a red ruin."</p>

<p>Bran's eyes glowed. "Exactly, king of Valusia. Such was my
exact plan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what of the scouts?"</p>

<p>"My warriors are like panthers; they hide under the noses of
the Romans. Those who ride into the valley will see only what we
wish them to see. Those who ride over the ridge will not come
back to report. An arrow is swift and silent.</p>

<p>"You see that the pivot of the whole thing depends on the men
that hold the gorge. They must be men who can fight on foot and
resist the charges of the heavy legionaries long enough for the
trap to close. Outside these Northmen I had no such force of men.
My naked warriors with their short swords could never stand such
a charge for an instant. Nor is the armor of the Celts made for
such work; moreover, they are not foot-fighters, and I need them
elsewhere.</p>

<p>"So you see why I had such desperate need of the Northmen. Now
will you stand in the gorge with them and hold back the Romans
until I can spring the trap? Remember, most of you will die."</p>

<p>Kull smiled. "I have taken chances all my life, though Tu,
chief councilor, would say my life belongs to Valusia and I have
no right to so risk it&mdash;" His voice trailed off and a
strange look flitted across his face. "By Valka," said he,
laughing uncertainly, "sometimes I forget this is a dream! All
seems so real. But it is&mdash;of course it is! Well, then, if I
die I will but awaken as I have done in times past. Lead on, king
of Caledon!"</p>

<p>Cormac, going to his warriors, wondered. Surely it was all a
hoax; yet &mdash;he heard the arguments of the warriors all about
him as they armed themselves and prepared to take their posts.
The black-haired king was Neid himself, the Celtic war-god; he
was an antediluvian king brought out of the past by Gonar; he was
a mythical fighting man out of Valhalla. He was no man at all but
a ghost! No, he was mortal, for he had bled. But the gods
themselves bled, though they did not die. So the controversies
raged. At least, thought Cormac, if it was all a hoax to inspire
the warriors with the feeling of supernatural aid, it had
succeeded. The belief that Kull was more than a mortal man had
fired Celt, Pict and Viking alike into a sort of inspired
madness. And Cormac asked himself&mdash;what did he himself
believe? This man was surely one from some far land&mdash;yet in
his every look and action there was a vague hint of a greater
difference than mere distance of space&mdash;a hint of alien
Time, of misty abysses and gigantic gulfs of eons lying between
the black-haired stranger and the men with whom he walked and
talked. Clouds of bewilderment mazed Cormac's brain and he
laughed in whimsical self-mockery.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="kings3" name="kings3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="verse" style="margin-left:38%">
"And the two wild peoples of the north<br>
Stood fronting in the gloam,<br>
And heard and knew each in his mind<br>
A third great sound upon the wind,<br>
The living walls that hedge mankind,<br>
The walking walls of Rome."<br>
&mdash;Chesterton</p>
<hr>

<p><br>
THE sun slanted westward. Silence lay like an invisible mist
over the valley. Cormac gathered the reins in his hand and
glanced up at the ridges on both sides. The waving heather which
grew rank on those steep slopes gave no evidence of the hundreds
of savage warriors who lurked there. Here in the narrow gorge
which widened gradually southward was the only sign of life.
Between the steep walls three hundred Northmen were massed
solidly in their wedge-shaped shield-wall, blocking the pass. At
the tip, like the point of a spear, stood the man who called
himself Kull, king of Valusia. He wore no helmet, only the great,
strangely worked head-band of hard gold, but he bore on his left
arm the great shield borne by the dead Rognar; and in his right
hand he held the heavy iron mace wielded by the sea-king. The
Vikings eyed him in wonder and savage admiration. They could not
understand his language, or he theirs. But no further orders were
necessary. At Bran's directions they had bunched themselves in
the gorge, and their only order was&mdash;hold the pass!</p>

<p>Bran Mak Morn stood just in front of Kull. So they faced each
other, he whose kingdom was yet unborn, and he whose kingdom had
been lost in the mists of Time for unguessed ages. Kings of
darkness, thought Cormac, nameless kings of the night, whose
realms are gulfs and shadows.</p>

<p>The hand of the Pictish king went out. "King Kull, you are
more than king &mdash;you are a man. Both of us may fall within
the next hour&mdash;but if we both live, ask what you will of
me."</p>

<p>Kull smiled, returning the firm grip. "You too are a man after
my own heart, king of the shadows. Surely you are more than a
figment of my sleeping imagination. Mayhap we will meet in waking
life some day."</p>

<p>Bran shook his head in puzzlement, swung into the saddle and
rode away, climbing the eastern slope and vanishing over the
ridge. Cormac hesitated: "Strange man, are you in truth of flesh
and blood, or are you a ghost?"</p>

<p>"When we dream, we are all flesh and blood&mdash;so long as we
are dreaming," Kull answered. "This is the strangest nightmare I
have ever known &mdash;but you, who will soon fade into sheer
nothingness as I awaken, seem as real to me <i>now</i>, as Brule,
or Kananu, or Tu, or Kelkor."</p>

<p>Cormac shook his head as Bran had done, and with a last
salute, which Kull returned with barbaric stateliness, he turned
and trotted away. At the top of the western ridge he paused. Away
to the south a light cloud of dust rose and the head of the
marching column was in sight. Already he believed he could feel
the earth vibrate slightly to the measured tread of a thousand
mailed feet beating in perfect unison. He dismounted, and one of
his chieftains, Domnail, took his steed and led it down the slope
away from the valley, where trees grew thickly. Only an
occasional vague movement among them gave evidence of the five
hundred men who stood there, each at his horse's head with a
ready hand to check a chance nicker.</p>

<p><i>Oh,</i> thought Cormac, <i>the gods themselves made this
valley for Bran's ambush!</i> The floor of the valley was
treeless and the inner slopes were bare save for the waist-high
heather. But at the foot of each ridge on the side facing away
from the vale, where the soil long washed from the rocky slopes
had accumulated, there grew enough trees to hide five hundred
horsemen or fifty chariots.</p>

<p>At the northern end of the valley stood Kull and his three
hundred Vikings, in open view, flanked on each side by fifty
Pictish bowmen. Hidden on the western side of the western ridge
were the Gaels. Along the top of the slopes, concealed in the
tall heather, lay a hundred Picts with their shafts on string.
The rest of the Picts were hidden on the eastern slopes beyond
which lay the Britons with their chariots in full readiness.
Neither they nor the Gaels to the west could see what went on in
the vale, but signals had been arranged.</p>

<p>Now the long column was entering the wide mouth of the valley
and their scouts, light-armed men on swift horses, were spreading
out between the slopes. They galloped almost within bowshot of
the silent host that blocked the pass, then halted. Some whirled
and raced back to the main force, while the others deployed and
cantered up the slopes, seeking to see what lay beyond. This was
the crucial moment. If they got any hint of the ambush, all was
lost. Cormac, shrinking down into the heather, marveled at the
ability of the Picts to efface themselves from view so
completely. He saw a horseman pass within three feet of where he
knew a bowman lay, yet the Roman saw nothing.</p>

<p>The scouts topped the ridges, gazed about; then most of them
turned and trotted back down the slopes. Cormac wondered at their
desultory manner of scouting. He had never fought Romans before,
knew nothing of their arrogant self-confidence, of their
incredible shrewdness in some ways, their incredible stupidity in
others. These men were overconfident; a feeling radiating from
their officers. It had been years since a force of Caledonians
had stood before the legions. And most of these men were but
newly come to Britain; part of a legion which had been quartered
in Egypt. They despised their foes and suspected nothing.</p>

<p>But stay&mdash;three riders on the opposite ridge had turned
and vanished on the other side. And now one, sitting his steed at
the crest of the western ridge, not a hundred yards from where
Cormac lay, looked long and narrowly down into the mass of trees
at the foot of the slope. Cormac saw suspicion grow on his brown,
hawk-like face. He half turned as though to call to his comrades,
then instead reined his steed down the slope, leaning forward in
his saddle. Cormac's heart pounded. Each moment he expected to
see the man wheel and gallop back to raise the alarm. He resisted
a mad impulse to leap up and charge the Roman on foot. Surely the
man could feel the tenseness in the air&mdash;the hundreds of
fierce eyes upon him. Now he was halfway down the slope, out of
sight of the men in the valley. And now the twang of an unseen
bow broke the painful stillness. With a strangled gasp the Roman
flung his hands high, and as the steed reared, he pitched
headlong, transfixed by a long black arrow that had flashed from
the heather. A stocky dwarf sprang out of nowhere, seemingly, and
seized the bridle, quieting the snorting horse, and leading it
down the slope. At the fall of the Roman, short crooked men rose
like a sudden flight of birds from the grass and Cormac saw the
flash of a knife. Then with unreal suddenness all had subsided.
Slayers and slain were unseen and only the still-waving heather
marked the grim deed.</p>

<p><br>
THE Gael looked back into the valley. The three who had ridden
over the eastern ridge had not come back and Cormac knew they
never would. Evidently the other scouts had borne word that only
a small band of warriors was ready to dispute the passage of the
legionaries. Now the head of the column was almost below him and
he thrilled at the sight of these men who were doomed, swinging
along with their superb arrogance. And the sight of their
splendid armor, their hawk-like faces and perfect discipline awed
him as much as it is possible for a Gael to be awed.</p>

<p>Twelve hundred men in heavy armor who marched as one so that
the ground shook to their tread! Most of them were of middle
height, with powerful chests and shoulders and bronzed
faces&mdash;hard-bitten veterans of a hundred campaigns. Cormac
noted their javelins, short keen swords and heavy shields; their
gleaming armor and crested helmets, the eagles on the standards.
These were the men beneath whose tread the world had shaken and
empires crumbled! Not all were Latins; there were Romanized
Britons among them and one century or hundred was composed of
huge yellow-haired men &mdash;Gauls and Germans, who fought for
Rome as fiercely as did the native-born, and hated their wilder
kinsmen more savagely.</p>

<p>On each side was a swarm of cavalry, outriders, and the column
was flanked by archers and slingers. A number of lumbering wagons
carried the supplies of the army. Cormac saw the commander riding
in his place&mdash;a tall man with a lean, imperious face,
evident even at that distance. Marcus Sulius &mdash;the Gael knew
him by repute.</p>

<p>A deep-throated roar rose from the legionaries as they
approached their foes. Evidently they intended to slice their way
through and continue without a pause, for the column moved
implacably on. Whom the gods destroy they first make
mad&mdash;Cormac had never heard the phrase but it came to him
that the great Sulius was a fool. Roman arrogance! Marcus was
used to lashing the cringing peoples of a decadent East; little
he guessed of the iron in these western races.</p>

<p>A group of cavalry detached itself and raced into the mouth of
the gorge, but it was only a gesture. With loud jeering shouts
they wheeled three spears length away and cast their javelins,
which rattled harmlessly on the overlapping shields of the silent
Northmen. But their leader dared too much; swinging in, he leaned
from his saddle and thrust at Kull's face. The great shield
turned the lance and Kull struck back as a snake strikes; the
ponderous mace crushed helmet and head like an eggshell, and the
very steed went to its knees from the shock of that terrible
blow. From the Northmen went up a short fierce roar, and the
Picts beside them howled exultantly and loosed their arrows among
the retreating horsemen. First blood for the people of the
heather! The oncoming Romans shouted vengefully and quickened
their pace as the frightened horse raced by, a ghastly travesty
of a man, foot caught in the stirrup, trailing beneath the
pounding hoofs.</p>

<p>Now the first line of the legionaries, compressed because of
the narrowness of the gorge, crashed against the solid wall of
shields&mdash; crashed and recoiled upon itself. The shield-wall
had not shaken an inch. This was the first time the Roman legions
had met with that unbreakable formation&mdash;that oldest of all
Aryan battle-lines&mdash;the ancestor of the Spartan
regiment&mdash;the Theban phalanx&mdash;the Macedonian
formation&mdash;the English square.</p>

<p>Shield crashed on shield and the short Roman sword sought for
an opening in that iron wall. Viking spears bristling in solid
ranks above, thrust and reddened; heavy axes chopped down,
shearing through iron, flesh and bone. Cormac saw Kull, looming
above the stocky Romans in the forefront of the fray, dealing
blows like thunderbolts. A burly centurion rushed in, shield held
high, stabbing upward. The iron mace crashed terribly, shivering
the sword, rending the shield apart, shattering the helmet,
crushing the skull down between the shoulders&mdash;in a single
blow.</p>

<p>The front line of the Romans bent like a steel bar about the
wedge, as the legionaries sought to struggle through the gorge on
each side and surround their opposers. But the pass was too
narrow; crouching close against the steep walls the Picts drove
their black arrows in a hail of death. At this range the heavy
shafts tore through shield and corselet, transfixing the armored
men. The front line of battle rolled back, red and broken, and
the Northmen trod their few dead underfoot to close the gaps
their fall had made. Stretched the full width of their front lay
a thin line of shattered forms &mdash;the red spray of the tide
which had broken upon them in vain.</p>

<p>Cormac had leaped to his feet, waving his arms. Domnail and
his men broke cover at the signal and came galloping up the
slope, lining the ridge. Cormac mounted the horse brought him and
glanced impatiently across the narrow vale. No sign of life
appeared on the eastern ridge. Where was Bran&mdash;and the
Britons?</p>

<p>Down in the valley, the legions, angered at the unexpected
opposition of the paltry force in front of them, but not
suspicious, were forming in more compact body. The wagons which
had halted were lumbering on again and the whole column was once
more in motion as if it intended to crash through by sheer
weight. With the Gaulish century in the forefront, the
legionaries were advancing again in the attack. This time, with
the full force of twelve hundred men behind, the charge would
batter down the resistance of Kull's warriors like a heavy ram;
would stamp them down, sweep over their red ruins. Cormac's men
trembled in impatience. Suddenly Marcus Sulius turned and gazed
westward, where the line of horsemen was etched against the sky.
Even at that distance Cormac saw his face pale. The Roman at last
realized the metal of the men he faced, and that he had walked
into a trap. Surely in that moment there flashed a chaotic
picture through his brain&mdash;defeat&mdash; disgrace&mdash;red
ruin!</p>

<p>It was too late to retreat&mdash;too late to form into a
defensive square with the wagons for barricade. There was but one
possible way out, and Marcus, crafty general in spite of his
recent blunder, took it. Cormac heard his voice cut like a
clarion through the din, and though he did not understand the
words, he knew that the Roman was shouting for his men to smite
that knot of Northmen like a blast&mdash;to hack their way
through and out of the trap before it could close!</p>

<p>Now the legionaries, aware of their desperate plight, flung
themselves headlong and terribly on their foes. The shield-wall
rocked, but it gave not an inch. The wild faces of the Gauls and
the hard brown Italian faces glared over locked shields into the
blazing eyes of the North. Shields touching, they smote and slew
and died in a red storm of slaughter, where crimsoned axes rose
and fell and dripping spears broke on notched swords.</p>

<p>Where in God's name was Bran with his chariots? A few minutes
more would spell the doom of every man who held that pass.
Already they were falling fast, though they locked their ranks
closer and held like iron. Those wild men of the North were dying
in their tracks; and looming among their golden heads the black
lion-mane of Kull shone like a symbol of slaughter, and his
reddened mace showered a ghastly rain as it splashed brains and
blood like water.</p>

<p>Something snapped in Cormac's brain.</p>

<p>"These men will die while we wait for Bran's signal!" he
shouted. "On! Follow me into Hell, sons of Gael!"</p>

<p>A wild roar answered him, and loosing rein he shot down the
slope with five hundred yelling riders plunging headlong after
him. And even at that moment a storm of arrows swept the valley
from either side like a dark cloud and the terrible clamor of the
Picts split the skies. And over the eastern ridge, like a sudden
burst of rolling thunder on Judgment Day, rushed the war-chariots. Headlong down the slope they roared, foam flying from
the horses' distended nostrils, frantic feet scarcely seeming to
touch the ground, making naught of the tall heather. In the
foremost chariot, with his dark eyes blazing, crouched Bran Mak
Morn, and in all of them the naked Britons were screaming and
lashing as if possessed by demons. Behind the flying chariots
came the Picts, howling like wolves and loosing their arrows as
they ran. The heather belched them forth from all sides in a dark
wave.</p>

<p>So much Cormac saw in chaotic glimpses during that wild ride
down the slopes. A wave of cavalry swept between him and the main
line of the column. Three long leaps ahead of his men, the Gaelic
prince met the spears of the Roman riders. The first lance turned
on his buckler, and rising in his stirrups he smote downward,
cleaving his man from shoulder to breastbone. The next Roman
flung a javelin that killed Domnail, but at that instant Cormac's
steed crashed into his, breast to breast, and the lighter horse
rolled headlong under the shock, flinging his rider beneath the
pounding hoofs.</p>

<p>Then the whole blast of the Gaelic charge smote the Roman
cavalry, shattering it, crashing and rolling it down and under.
Over its red ruins Cormac's yelling demons struck the heavy Roman
infantry, and the whole line reeled at the shock. Swords and axes
flashed up and down and the force of their rush carried them deep
into the massed ranks. Here, checked, they swayed and strove.
Javelins thrust, swords flashed upward, bringing down horse and
rider, and greatly outnumbered, beleaguered on every side, the
Gaels had perished among their foes, but at that instant, from
the other side the crashing chariots smote the Roman ranks. In
one long line they struck almost simultaneously, and at the
moment of impact the charioteers wheeled their horses side-long
and raced parallel down the ranks, shearing men down like the
mowing of wheat. Hundreds died on those curving blades in that
moment, and leaping from the chariots, screaming like blood-mad
wildcats, the British swordsmen flung themselves upon the spears
of the legionaries, hacking madly with their two-handed swords.
Crouching, the Picts drove their arrows point-blank and then
sprang in to slash and thrust. Maddened with the sight of
victory, these wild peoples were like wounded tigers, feeling no
wounds, and dying on their feet with their last gasp a snarl of
fury.</p>

<p>But the battle was not over yet. Dazed, shattered, their
formation broken and nearly half their number down already, the
Romans fought back with desperate fury. Hemmed in on all sides
they slashed and smote singly, or in small clumps, fought back to
back, archers, slingers, horsemen and heavy legionaries mingled
into a chaotic mass. The confusion was complete, but not the
victory. Those bottled in the gorge still hurled themselves upon
the red axes that barred their way, while the massed and serried
battle thundered behind them. From one side Cormac's Gaels raged
and slashed; from the other chariots swept back and forth,
retiring and returning like iron whirlwinds. There was no
retreat, for the Picts had flung a cordon across the way they had
come, and having cut the throats of the camp followers and
possessed themselves of the wagons, they sent their shafts in a
storm of death into the rear of the shattered column. Those long
black arrows pierced armor and bone, nailing men together. Yet
the slaughter was not all on one side. Picts died beneath the
lightning thrust of javelin and shortsword, Gaels pinned beneath
their falling horses were hewed to pieces, and chariots, cut
loose from their horses, were deluged with the blood of the
charioteers.</p>

<p>And at the narrow head of the valley still the battle surged
and eddied. Great gods&mdash;thought Cormac, glancing between
lightning-like blows &mdash;do these men still hold the gorge?
Aye! They held it! A tenth of their original number, dying on
their feet, they still held back the frantic charges of the
dwindling legionaries.</p>

<p><br>
OVER all the field went up the roar and the clash of arms, and
birds of prey, swift-flying out of the sunset, circled above.
Cormac, striving to reach Marcus Sulius through the press, saw
the Roman's horse sink under him, and the rider rise alone in a
waste of foes. He saw the Roman sword flash thrice, dealing a
death at each blow; then from the thickest of the fray bounded a
terrible figure. It was Bran Mak Morn, stained from head to foot.
He cast away his broken sword as he ran, drawing a dirk. The
Roman struck, but the Pictish king was under the thrust, and
gripping the sword-wrist, he drove the dirk again and again
through the gleaming armor.</p>

<p>A mighty roar went up as Marcus died, and Cormac, with a
shout, rallied the remnants of his force about him and, striking
in the spurs, burst through the shattered lines and rode full
speed for the other end of the valley.</p>

<p>But as he approached he saw that he was too late. As they had
lived, so had they died, those fierce sea-wolves, with their
faces to the foe and their broken weapons red in their hands. In
a grim and silent band they lay, even in death preserving some of
the shield-wall formation. Among them, in front of them and all
about them lay high-heaped the bodies of those who had sought to
break them, in vain. <i>They had not given back a foot!</i> To
the last man, they had died in their tracks. Nor were there any
left to stride over their torn shapes; those Romans who had
escaped the Viking axes had been struck down by the shafts of the
Picts and swords of the Gaels from behind.</p>

<p>Yet this part of the battle was not over. High up on the steep
western slope Cormac saw the ending of that drama. A group of
Gauls in the armor of Rome pressed upon a single man&mdash;a
black-haired giant on whose head gleamed a golden crown. There
was iron in these men, as well as in the man who had held them to
their fate. They were doomed&mdash;their comrades were being
slaughtered behind them&mdash;but before their turn came they
would at least have the life of the black-haired chief who had
led the golden-haired men of the North.</p>

<p>Pressing upon him from three sides they had forced him slowly
back up the steep gorge wall, and the crumpled bodies that
stretched along his retreat showed how fiercely every foot of the
way had been contested. Here on this steep it was task enough to
keep one's footing alone; yet these men at once climbed and
fought. Kull's shield and the huge mace were gone, and the great
sword in his right hand was dyed crimson. His mail, wrought with
a forgotten art, now hung in shreds, and blood streamed from a
hundred wounds on limbs, head and body. But his eyes still blazed
with the battle-joy and his wearied arm still drove the mighty
blade in strokes of death.</p>

<p>But Cormac saw that the end would come before they could reach
him. Now at the very crest of the steep, a hedge of points
menaced the strange king's life, and even his iron strength was
ebbing. Now he split the skull of a huge warrior and the
backstroke shore through the neck-cords of another; reeling under
a very rain of swords he struck again and his victim dropped at
his feet, cleft to the breastbone. Then, even as a dozen swords
rose above the staggering Atlantean for the death stroke, a
strange thing happened. The sun was sinking into the western sea;
all the heather swam red like an ocean of blood. Etched in the
dying sun, as he had first appeared, Kull stood, and then, like a
mist lifting, a mighty vista opened behind the reeling king.
Cormac's astounded eyes caught a fleeting gigantic glimpse of
other climes and spheres&mdash;as if mirrored in summer clouds he
saw, instead of the heather hills stretching away to the sea, a
dim and mighty land of blue mountains and gleaming quiet
lakes&mdash;the golden, purple and sapphirean spires and towering
walls of a mighty city such as the earth has not known for many a
drifting age.</p>

<p>Then like the fading of a mirage it was gone, but the Gauls on
the high slope had dropped their weapons and stared like men
dazed&mdash;<i>For the man called Kull had vanished and there was
no trace of his going!</i></p>

<p><br>
AS in a daze Cormac turned his steed and rode back across the
trampled field. His horse's hoofs splashed in lakes of blood and
clanged against the helmets of dead men. Across the valley the
shout of victory was thundering. Yet all seemed shadowy and
strange. A shape was striding across the torn corpses and Cormac
was dully aware that it was Bran. The Gael swung from his horse
and fronted the king. Bran was weaponless and gory; blood
trickled from gashes on brow, breast and limb; what armor he had
worn was clean hacked away and a cut had shorn halfway through
his iron crown. But the red jewel still gleamed unblemished like
a star of slaughter.</p>

<p>"It is in my mind to slay you," said the Gael heavily and like
a man speaking in a daze, "for the blood of brave men is on your
head. Had you given the signal to charge sooner, some would have
lived."</p>

<p>Bran folded his arms; his eyes were haunted. "Strike if you
will; I am sick of slaughter. It is a cold mead, this kinging it.
A king must gamble with men's lives and naked swords. The lives
of all my people were at stake; I sacrificed the
Northmen&mdash;yes; and my heart is sore within me, for they were
men! But had I given the order when you would have desired, all
might have gone awry. The Romans were not yet massed in the
narrow mouth of the gorge, and might have had time and space to
form their ranks again and beat us off. I waited until the last
moment&mdash;and the rovers died. A king belongs to his people,
and can not let either his own feelings or the lives of men
influence him. Now my people are saved; but my heart is cold in
my breast."</p>

<p>Cormac wearily dropped his sword-point to the ground.</p>

<p>"You are a born king of men, Bran," said the Gaelic
prince.</p>

<p>Bran's eyes roved the field. A mist of blood hovered over all,
where the victorious barbarians were looting the dead, while
those Romans who had escaped slaughter by throwing down their
swords and now stood under guard, looked on with hot smoldering
eyes.</p>

<p>"My kingdom&mdash;my people&mdash;are saved," said Bran
wearily. "They will come from the heather by the thousands and
when Rome moves against us again, she will meet a solid nation.
But I am weary. What of Kull?"</p>

<p>"My eyes and brain were mazed with battle," answered Cormac.
"I thought to see him vanish like a ghost into the sunset. I will
seek his body."</p>

<p>"Seek not for him," said Bran. "Out of the sunrise he
came&mdash;into the sunset he has gone. Out of the mists of the
ages he came to us, and back into the mists of the eons has he
returned&mdash;to his own kingdom."</p>

<p>Cormac turned away; night was gathering. Gonar stood like a
white specter before him.</p>

<p>"To his own kingdom," echoed the wizard. "Time and Space are
naught. Kull has returned to his own kingdom&mdash;his own
crown&mdash;his own age."</p>

<p>"Then he was a ghost?"</p>

<p>"Did you not feel the grip of his solid hand? Did you not hear
his voice &mdash;see him eat and drink, laugh and slay and
bleed?"</p>

<p>Still Cormac stood like one in a trance.</p>

<p>"Then if it be possible for a man to pass from one age into
one yet unborn, or come forth from a century dead and forgotten,
whichever you will, with his flesh-and-blood body and his
arms&mdash;then he is as mortal as he was in his own day. Is Kull
dead, then?"</p>

<p>"He died a hundred thousand years ago, as men reckon time,"
answered the wizard, "but in his own age. He died not from the
swords of the Gauls of this age. Have we not heard in legends how
the king of Valusia traveled into a strange, timeless land of the
misty future ages, and there fought in a great battle? Why, so he
did! A hundred thousand years ago, or today!</p>

<p>"And a hundred thousand years ago&mdash;or a moment
agone!&mdash;Kull, king of Valusia, roused himself on the silken
couch in his secret chamber and laughing, spoke to the first
Gonar, saying: 'Ha, wizard, I have in truth dreamed strangely,
for I went into a far clime and a far time in my visions, and
fought for the king of a strange shadow-people!' And the great
sorcerer smiled and pointed silently at the red, notched sword,
and the torn mail and the many wounds that the king carried. And
Kull, fully woken from his 'vision' and feeling the sting and the
weakness of these yet bleeding wounds, fell silent and mazed, and
all life and time and space seemed like a dream of ghosts to him,
and he wondered thereat all the rest of his life. For the wisdom
of the Eternities is denied even unto princes and Kull could no
more understand what Gonar told him than you can understand my
words."</p>

<p>"And then Kull lived despite his many wounds," said Cormac,
"and has returned to the mists of silence and the centuries.
Well&mdash;he thought us a dream; we thought him a ghost. And
sure, life is but a web spun of ghosts and dreams and illusion,
and it is in my mind that the kingdom which has this day been
born of swords and slaughter in this howling valley is a thing no
more solid than the foam of the bright sea."</p>
