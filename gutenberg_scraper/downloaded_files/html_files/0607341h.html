<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THE minute I stepped ashore from the <i>Sea
Girl</i>, merchantman, I had a hunch that there would be trouble.
This hunch was caused by seeing some of the crew of the
<i>Dauntless</i>. The men on the <i>Dauntless</i> have disliked the
<i>Sea Girl</i>'s crew ever since our skipper took their captain to
a cleaning on the wharfs of Zanzibar&mdash;them being narrow-minded
that way. They claimed that the old man had a knuckle-duster on his
right, which is ridiculous and a dirty lie. He had it on his
left.</p>

<p>Seeing these roughnecks in Manila, I had no illusions about
them, but I was not looking for no trouble. I am heavyweight
champion of the <i>Sea Girl</i>, and before you make any wisecracks
about the non-importance of that title, I want you to come down to
the forecastle and look over Mushy Hansen and One-Round Grannigan
and Flat-Face O'Toole and Swede Hjonning and the rest of the
man-killers that make up the <i>Sea Girl</i>'s crew. But for all
that, no one can never accuse me of being quarrelsome, and so
instead of following my natural instinct and knocking seven or
eight of these bezarks for a row, just to be ornery, I avoided them
and went to the nearest American bar.</p>

<p>After a while I found myself in a dance hall, and while it is
kind of hazy just how I got there, I assure you I had not no great
amount of liquor under my belt&mdash;some beer, a few whiskeys, a
little brandy, and maybe a slug of wine for a chaser like. No, I
was the perfect chevalier in all my actions, as was proven when I
found myself dancing with the prettiest girl I have yet to see in
Manila or elsewhere. She had red lips and black hair, and oh, what
a face!</p>

<p>"Say, miss," said I, the soul of politeness, "where have you
been all my life?"</p>

<p>"Oooh, la!" said she, with a silvery ripple of laughter. "You
Americans say such theengs. Oooh, so huge and strong you are,
senyor!"</p>

<p>I let her feel of my biceps, and she give squeals of surprise
and pleasure, clapping her little white hands just like a child
what has found a new pretty.</p>

<p>"Oooh! You could just snatch little me oop and walk away weeth
me, couldn't you, senyor?"</p>

<p>"You needn't not be afraid," said I, kindly. "I am the soul of
politeness around frails, and never pull no rough stuff. I have
never soaked a woman in my life, not even that dame in Suez that
throwed a knife at me. Baby, has anybody ever give you a hint about
what knockouts your eyes is?"</p>

<p>"Ah, go 'long," said she, coyly&mdash;"Ouch!"</p>

<p>"Did somebody step on your foot?" I ask, looking about for
somebody to crown.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;let's sit theese one out, senyor. Where did you learn
to dance?"</p>

<p>"It comes natural, I reckon," I admitted modestly. "I never knew
I could till now. This is the first time I ever tried."</p>

<p>From the foregoing you will see that I am carrying on a quiet
conversation, not starting nothing with nobody. It is not my fault,
what happened.</p>

<p>Me and this girl, whose name is Raquel La Costa, her being
Spanish that way, are sitting peacefully at a table and I am just
beginning to get started good telling her how her eyes are like
dark pools of night (pretty hot, that one; I got it offa Mushy
Hansen, who is all poetical like), when I notice her looking over
my shoulder at somebody. This irritates me slightly, but I ignore
it, and having forgotten what I was saying, my mind being slightly
hazy for some reason, I continue:</p>

<p>"Listen, cutey&mdash;hey, who are you winkin' at? Oh, somethin'
in your eye, you say? All right, as I was sayin', we got a feller
named Hansen on board the <i>Sea Girl</i> what writes po'try.
Listen to this:</p>

<p>"Oh, the road to glory lay</p>

<p>Over old Manila Bay.</p>

<p>Where the Irish whipped the Spanish</p>

<p>On a sultry summer day."</p>

<p>At this moment some bezark came barging up to our table and,
ignoring me, leaned over and leered engagingly at my girl.</p>

<p>"Let's shake a hoof, baby," said this skate, whom I recognized
instantly as Bat Slade, champion box fighter of the
<i>Dauntless</i>.</p>

<p>Miss La Costa said nothing, and I arose and shoved Slade back
from the table.</p>

<p>"The lady is engaged at present, stupid," says I, poking my jaw
out. "If you got any business, you better 'tend to it."</p>

<p>"Don't get gay with me, Costigan," says he, nastily. "Since when
is dames choosin' gorillas instead of humans?"</p>

<p>By this time quite a crowd had formed, and I restrained my
natural indignation and said, "Listen, bird, take that map outa my
line uh vision before I bust it."</p>

<p>Bat is a handsome galoot who has a way with the dames, and I
knew if he danced one dance with my girl he would figure out some
way to do me dirt. I did not see any more of the <i>Dauntless</i>
men; on the other hand, I was the only one of the <i>Sea Girl</i>'s
crew in the joint.</p>

<p>"Suppose we let the lady choose between us," said Bat. Can you
beat that for nerve? Him butting in that way and then giving
himself equal rights with me. That was too much. With a bellow, I
started my left from the hip, but somehow he wasn't there&mdash;the
shifty crook! I miss by a yard, and he slams me with a left to the
nose that knocks me over a chair.</p>

<p>My brain instantly cleared, and I realized that I had been
slightly lit. I arose with an irritated roar, but before
hostilities could be renewed, Miss La Costa stepped between us.</p>

<p>"Zut," said she, tapping us with her fan. "Zut! What is theese?
Am I a common girl to be so insult' by two great tramps who make
fight over me in public? Bah! Eef you wanta fight, go out in ze
woods or some place where no one make scandal, and wham each other
all you want. May ze best man win! I will not be fight over in
public, no sir!"</p>

<p>And with that she turned back and walked away. At the same time,
up came an oily-looking fellow, rubbing his hands together. I
mistrust a bird what goes around rubbing his hands together like he
was in a state of perpetual self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Now, now, boys," said this bezark, "le's do this right! You
boys wanta fight. Tut! Tut! Too bad, too bad! But if you gotta
fight, le's do it right, that's what I say! Let fellers live
together in peace and enmity if they can, but if they gotta fight,
let it be did right!"</p>

<p>"Gi' me leeway&mdash;and I'll do this blankety-blank right,"
says I, fairly shaking with rage. It always irritates me to be hit
on the nose without a return and in front of ladies.</p>

<p>"Oh, will you?" said Bat, putting up his mitts. "Let's see you
get goin', you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, now, boys," said the oily bird, "le's do this right!
Costigan, will you and Slade fight for me in my club?"</p>

<p>"Anywheres!" I roar. "Bare-knuckles, gloves, or
marlin-spikes!"</p>

<p>"Fine," says the oily bird, rubbing his hands worse than ever.
"Ah, fine! Ah&mdash;um&mdash;ah, Costigan, will you fight Slade in
the pit of the serpent?"</p>

<p>Now, I should have noticed that he didn't ask Slade if he'd
fight, and I saw Slade grin quietly, but I was too crazy with rage
to think straight.</p>

<p>"I'll fight him in the pit of Hades with the devil for a
referee!" I roared. "Bring on your fight club&mdash;ring, deck, or
whatever! Let's get goin'."</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk!" says the oily bird. "Come on."</p>

<p>He turned around and started for the exit, and me and Slade and
a few more followed him. Had I of thought, I would have seen right
off that this was all working too smooth to have happened
impromptu, as it were. But I was still seething with rage and in no
shape to think properly.</p>

<p>Howthesomever, I did give a few thoughts as to the chances I had
against Slade. As for size, I had the advantage. I'm six feet, and
Slade is two inches shorter; I am also a few pounds heavier but not
enough to make much difference, us being heavyweights that way. But
Slade, I knew, was the shiftiest, trickiest leather-slinger in the
whole merchant marine. I had never met him for the simple reason
that no match-maker in any port would stage a bout between a <i>Sea
Girl</i> man and a <i>Dauntless</i> tramp, since that night in
Singapore when the bout between Slade and One-Round Grannigan
started a free-for-all that plumb wrecked the Wharfside A.B. Slade
knocked Grannigan out that night, and Grannigan was then champion
slugger aboard the <i>Sea Girl</i>. Later, I beat Grannigan.</p>

<p>As for dope, you couldn't tell much, as usual. I'd won a
decision over Boatswain Hagney, the champion of the British Asiatic
naval fleet, who'd knocked Slade out in Hong Kong, but on the other
hand, Slade had knocked out Mike Leary of the Blue Whale, who'd
given me a terrible beating at Bombay.</p>

<p>These cogitations was interrupted at that minute by the oily
bird. We had come out of the joint and was standing on the curb.
Several autos was parked there, and the crowd piled into them. The
oily bird motioned me to get in one, and I done so.</p>

<p>Next, we was speeding through the streets, where the lights was
beginning to glow, and I asked no questions, even when we left the
business section behind and then went right on through the suburbs
and out on a road which didn't appear to be used very much. I said
nothing, however.</p>

<p>At last we stopped at a large building some distance outside the
city, which looked more like an ex-palace than anything else. All
the crowd alighted, and I done likewise, though I was completely
mystified. There was no other houses near, trees grew dense on all
sides, the house itself was dark and gloomy-looking. All together I
did not like the looks of things but would not let on, with Bat
Slade gazing at me in his supercilious way. Anyway, I thought, they
are not intending to assassinate me because Slade ain't that
crooked, though he would stop at nothing else.</p>

<p>We went up the walk, lined on each side by tropical trees, and
into the house. There the oily bird struck a light and we went down
in the basement. This was a large, roomy affair, with a concrete
floor, and in the center was a pit about seven feet deep, and about
ten by eight in dimensions. I did not pay no great attention to it
at that time, but I did later, I want to tell you.</p>

<p>"Say," I says, "I'm in no mood for foolishness. What you bring
me away out here for? Where's your arena?"</p>

<p>"This here's it," said the oily bird.</p>

<p>"Huh! Where's the ring? Where do we fight?"</p>

<p>"Down in there," says the oily bird, pointing at the pit.</p>

<p>"What!" I yell. "What are you tryin' to hand me?"</p>

<p>"Aw, pipe down," interrupted Bat Slade. "Didn't you agree to
fight me in the serpent pit? Stop grouchin' and get your duds
off."</p>

<p>"All right," I says, plumb burned up by this deal. "I don't know
what you're tryin' to put over, but lemme get that handsome map in
front of my right and that's all I want!"</p>

<p>"Grahhh!" snarled Slade, and started toward the other end of the
pit. He had a couple of yeggs with him as handlers. Shows his
caliber, how he always knows some thug; no matter how crooked the
crowd may be, he's never without acquaintances. I looked around and
recognized a pickpocket I used to know in Cuba, and asked him to
handle me. He said he would, though, he added, they wasn't much a
handler could do under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"What kind of a deal have I got into?" I asked him as I
stripped. "What kind of a joint is this?"</p>

<p>"This house used to be owned by a crazy Spaniard with more
mazuma than brains," said the dip, helping me undress. "He yearned
for bull fightin' and the like, and he thought up a brand new one.
He rigged up this pit and had his servants go out and bring in all
kinds of snakes. He'd put two snakes in the pit and let 'em fight
till they killed each other."</p>

<p>"What! I got to fight in a snake den?"</p>

<p>"Aw, don't worry. They ain't been no snakes in there for years.
The Spaniard got killed, and the old place went to ruin. They held
cock fights here and a few years ago the fellow that's stagin' this
bout got the idea of buyin' the house and stagin' grudge
fights."</p>

<p>"How's he make any money? I didn't see nobody buyin' tickets,
and they ain't more'n thirty or forty here."</p>

<p>"Aw, he didn't have no time to work it up. He'll make his money
bettin'. He never picks a loser! And he always referees himself. He
knows your ship sails tomorrow, and he didn't have no time for
ballyhooin'. This fight club is just for a select few who is too
sated or too vicious to enjoy a ordinary legitimate prize fight.
They ain't but a few in the know&mdash;all this is illegal, of
course&mdash;just a few sports which don't mind payin' for their
pleasure. The night Slade fought Sailor Handler they was forty-five
men here, each payin' a hundred and twenty-five dollars for
admission. Figure it out for yourself."</p>

<p>"Has Slade fought here before?" I ask, beginning to see a
light.</p>

<p>"Sure. He's the champion of the pit. Only last month he knocked
out Sailor Handler in nine rounds."</p>

<p>Gerusha! And only a few months ago me and the Sailor&mdash;who
stood six-four and weighed two-twenty&mdash;had done everything but
knife each other in a twenty-round draw.</p>

<p>"Ho! So that's the way it is," said I. "Slade deliberately come
and started trouble with me, knowin' I wouldn't get a square deal
here, him bein' the favorite and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said the dip, "I don't think so. He just fell for that
Spanish frail. Had they been any malice aforethought, word would
have circulated among the wealthy sports of the town. As it is, the
fellow that owns the joint is throwin' the party free of charge. He
didn't have time to work it up. Figure it out&mdash;he ain't losing
nothin'. Here's two tough sailors wanting to fight a grudge
fight&mdash;willin' to fight for nothin'. It costs him nothin' to
stage the riot. It's a great boost for his club, and he'll win
plenty on bets."</p>

<p>The confidence with which the dip said that last gave me cold
shivers.</p>

<p>"And who will he bet on?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Slade, of course. Ain't he the pit champion?"</p>

<p>While I was considering this cheering piece of information, Bat
Slade yelled at me from the other end of the pit:</p>

<p>"Hey, you blankey dash-dot-blank, ain't you ready yet?"</p>

<p>He was in his socks, shoes and underpants, and no gloves on his
hands.</p>

<p>"Where's the gloves?" I asked. "Ain't we goin' to tape our
hands?"</p>

<p>"They ain't no gloves," said Slade, with a satisfied grin. "This
little riot is goin' to be a bare-knuckle affair. Don't you know
the rules of the pit?"</p>

<p>"You see, Costigan," says the oily bird, kinda nervous, "in the
fights we put on here, the fighters don't wear no
gloves&mdash;regular he-man grudge stuff, see?"</p>

<p>"Aw, get goin'!" the crowd began to bellow, having paid nothing
to get in and wanting their money's worth. "Lessee some action!
What do you think this is? Start somethin'!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" I ordered, cowing them with one menacing look. "What
kind of a deal am I getting here, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you agree to fight Slade in the serpent pit?"</p>

<p>"Yes but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tryin' to back out," said Slade nastily, as usual. "That's like
you <i>Sea Girl</i> tramps, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blank, exclamation point, and asterisk!" I roared, tearing off
my undershirt and bounding into the pit. "Get down in here you
blank-blank semicolon, and I'll make you look like the last rose of
summer, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Slade hopped down into the pit at the other end, and the crowd
began to fight for places at the edge. It was a cinch that some of
them was not going to get to see all of it. The sides of the pit
were hard and rough, and the floor was the same way, like you'd
expect a pit in a concrete floor to be. Of course they was no
stools or anything.</p>

<p>"Now then," says the oily bird, "this is a finish fight between
Steve Costigan of the <i>Sea Girl</i>, weight one-eighty-eight, and
Battling Slade, one-seventy-nine, of the <i>Dauntless</i>,
bare-knuckle champion of the Philippine Islands, in as far as he's
proved it in this here pit. They will fight three-minute rounds,
one minute rest, no limit to the number of rounds. There will be no
decision. They will fight till one of 'em goes out. Referee,
me.</p>

<p>"The rules is, nothing barred except hittin' below the
belt&mdash;in the way of punches, I mean. Break when I say so, and
hit on the breakaway if you wanta. Seconds will kindly refrain from
hittin' the other man with the water bucket. Ready?"</p>

<p>"A hundred I lay you like a rug," says Slade.</p>

<p>"I see you and raise you a hundred," I snarl.</p>

<p>The crowd began to yell and curse, the timekeeper hit a piece of
iron with a six-shooter stock, and the riot was on.</p>

<p>Now, understand, this was a very different fight from any I ever
engaged in. It combined the viciousness of a rough-and-tumble with
that of a legitimate ring bout. No room for any footwork, concrete
to land on if you went down, the uncertain flare of the lights
which was hung on the ceiling over us, and the feeling of being
crowded for space, to say nothing of thinking about all the snakes
which had fought there. Ugh! And me hating snakes that way.</p>

<p>I had figured that I'd have the advantage, being heavier and
stronger. Slade couldn't use his shifty footwork to keep out of my
way. I'd pin him in a corner and smash him like a cat does a rat.
But the bout hadn't been on two seconds before I saw I was all
wrong. Slade was just an overgrown Young Griffo. His footwork was
second to his ducking and slipping. He had fought in the pit
before, and had found that kind of fighting just suited to his
peculiar style. He shifted on his feet just enough to keep weaving,
while he let my punches go under his arms, around his neck, over
his head or across his shoulder.</p>

<p>At the sound of the gong I'd stepped forward, crouching, with
both hands going in the only way I knew.</p>

<p>Slade took my left on his shoulder, my right on his elbow, and,
blip-blip! his left landed twice to my face. Now I want to tell you
that a blow from a bare fist is much different than a blow from a
glove, and while less stunning, is more of a punisher in its way.
Still, I was used to being hit with bare knuckles, and I kept
boring in. I swung a left to the ribs that made Slade grunt, and
missed a right in the same direction.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a cruel, bruising fight with no favor.
I felt like a wild animal, when I had time to feel anything but
Slade's left, battling down there in the pit, with a ring of
yelling, distorted faces leering down at us. The oily bird,
referee, leaned over the edge at the risk of falling on top of us,
and when we clinched he would yell, "Break, you blank-blanks!" and
prod us with a cane. He would dance around the edge of the pit
trying to keep in prodding distance, and cussing when the crowd got
in his way, which was all the time. There was no room in the pit
for him; wasn't scarcely room enough for us.</p>

<p>Following that left I landed, Slade tied me up in a clinch,
stamped on my instep, thumbed me in the eye, and swished a right to
my chin on the breakaway. Slightly infuriated at this treatment, I
curled my lip back and sank a left to the wrist in his midriff. He
showed no signs at all of liking this, and retaliated with a left
to the body and a right to the side of the head. Then he settled
down to work.</p>

<p>He ducked a right and came in close, pounding my waist line with
short jolts. When, in desperation, I clinched, he shot a right
uppercut between my arms that set me back on my heels. And while I
was off balance he threw all his weight against me and scraped me
against the wall, which procedure removed a large area of hide from
my shoulder. With a roar, I tore loose and threw him the full
length of the pit, but, charging after him, he side-stepped somehow
and I crashed against the pit wall, head-first. Wham! I was on the
floor, with seventeen million stars flashing before me, and the
oily bird was counting as fast as he could,
"Onetwothreefourfive&mdash;"</p>

<p>I bounded up again, not hurt but slightly dizzy. Wham, wham,
wham! Bat came slugging in to finish me. I swished loose a right
that was labeled T.N.T., but he ducked.</p>

<p>"Look out, Bat! That bird's dangerous!" yelled the oily bird in
fright.</p>

<p>"So am I!" snarled Bat, cutting my lip with a straight left and
weaving away from my right counter. He whipped a right to the wind
that made me grunt, flashed two lefts to my already battered face,
and somehow missed with a venomous right. All the time, get me, I
was swinging fast and heavy, but it was like hitting at a ghost.
Bat had maneuvered me into a corner, where I couldn't get set or
defend myself. When I drew back for a punch, my elbow hit the wall.
Finally I wrapped both arms around my jaw and plunged forward,
breaking through Slade's barrage by sheer weight. As we came
together, I threw my arms about him and together we crashed to the
floor.</p>

<p>Slade, being the quicker that way, was the first up, and hit me
with a roundhouse left to the side of the head while I was still on
one knee.</p>

<p>"Foul!" yells some of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" bellowed the oily bird. "I'm refereein' this
bout!"</p>

<p>As I found my feet, Slade was right on me and we traded rights.
Just then the gong sounded. I went back to my end of the pit and
sat down on the floor, leaning my back against the wall. The dip
peered over the edge.</p>

<p>"Anything I can do?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said I, "knock the daylights out of the blank-blank
that's pretendin' to referee this bout."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the aforesaid blank-blank shoved his snoot over the
other end of the pit, and shouted anxiously, "Slade, you reckon you
can take him in a couple more rounds?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Bat. "Double your bets; triple 'em. I'll lay him in
the next round."</p>

<p>"You'd better!" admonished this fair-minded referee.</p>

<p>"How can he get anybody to bet with him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh," says the dip, handing me down a sponge to wipe off the
blood, "some fellers will bet on anything. For instance, I just
laid ten smackers on you, myself."</p>

<p>"That I'll win?"</p>

<p>"Naw; that you'll last five rounds."</p>

<p>At this moment the gong sounded and I rushed for the other end
of the pit, with the worthy intention of effacing Slade from the
face of the earth. But, as usual, I underestimated the force of my
rush and the length of the pit. There didn't seem to be room enough
for Slade to get out of my way, but he solved this problem by
dropping on his knees, and allowing me to fall over him, which I
did.</p>

<p>"Foul!" yelled the dip. "He went down without bein' hit!"</p>

<p>"Foul my eye!" squawked the oily bird. "A blind man could tell
he slipped, accidental."</p>

<p>We arose at the same time, me none the better for my fiasco.
Slade took my left over his shoulder and hooked a left to the body.
He followed this with a straight right to the mouth and a left hook
to the side of the head. I clinched and clubbed him with my right
to the ribs until the referee prodded us apart.</p>

<p>Again Slade managed to get me into a corner. You see, he was
used to the dimensions whereas I, accustomed to a regular ring,
kept forgetting about the size of the blasted pit. It seemed like
with every movement I bumped my hip or shoulder or scraped my arms
against the rough cement of the walls. To date, Slade hadn't a mark
to show he'd been in a fight, except for the bruise on his ribs.
What with his thumbing and his straight lefts, both my eyes were in
a fair way to close, my lips were cut, and I was bunged up
generally, but was not otherwise badly hurt.</p>

<p>I fought my way out of the corner, and the gong found us
slugging toe to toe in the center of the pit, where I had the
pleasure of staggering Bat with a left to the temple. Not an awful
lot of action in that round; mostly clinching.</p>

<p>The third started like a whirlwind. At the tap of the gong Slade
bounded from his end and was in mine before I could get up. He
slammed me with a left and right that shook me clean to my toes,
and ducked my left. He also ducked a couple of rights, and then
rammed a left to my wind which bent me double. No doubt&mdash;this
baby could hit!</p>

<p>I came up with a left swing to the head, and in a wild mix-up
took four right and left hooks to land my right to the ribs. Slade
grunted and tried to back-heel me, failing which he lowered his
head and butted me in the belly, kicked me on the shin, and would
have did more, likely, only I halted the proceedings temporarily by
swinging an overhand right to the back of his neck which took the
steam out of him for a minute.</p>

<p>We clinched, and I never saw a critter short of a octopus which
could appear to have so many arms when clinching. He always managed
to not only tie me up and render me helpless for the time being,
but to stamp on my insteps, thumb me in the eye and pound the back
of my neck with the edge of his hand. Add to this the fact that he
frequently shoved me against the wall, and you can get a idea what
kind of a bezark I was fighting. My superior weight and bulk did
not have no advantage. What was needed was skill and speed, and the
fact that Bat was somewhat smaller than me was an advantage to
him.</p>

<p>Still, I was managing to hand out some punishment. Near the end
of that round Bat had a beautiful black eye and some more bruises
on his ribs. Then it happened. I had plunged after him, swinging;
he sidestepped out of the corner, and the next instant was
left-jabbing me to death while I floundered along the wall trying
to get set for a smash.</p>

<p>I swished a right to his body, and while I didn't think it
landed solid, he staggered and dropped his hands slightly. I
straightened out of my defensive crouch and cocked my right, and,
simultaneous, I realized I had been took. Slade had tricked me. The
minute I raised by chin in this careless manner, he beat me to the
punch with a right that smashed my head back against the wall,
laying open the scalp. Dazed and only partly conscious of what was
going on I rebounded right into Slade, ramming my jaw flush into
his left. Zam! At the same instant I hooked a trip-hammer right
under his heart, and we hit the floor together.</p>

<p>Zowie! I could hear the yelling and cursing as if from a great
distance, and the lights on the ceiling high above seemed dancing
in a thick fog. All I knew was that I had to get back on my feet as
quick as I could.</p>

<p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four," the oily bird was
counting over the both of us, "five&mdash;Bat, you blank-blank, get
up!&mdash;Six&mdash;seven&mdash;Bat, blast it, get your feet under
you!&mdash;eight&mdash;Juan, hit that gong! What kind of a
timekeeper are you?"</p>

<p>"The round ain't over yet!" yelled the dip, seeing I had begun
to get my legs under me.</p>

<p>"Who's refereein' this?" roared the oily bird, jerking out a
.45. "Juan, hit that gong!&mdash;Nine!"</p>

<p>Juan hit the gong and Bat's seconds hopped down into the pit and
dragged him to his end, where they started working over him. I
crawled back to mine. Splash! The dip emptied a bucket of water
over me. That freshened me up a lot.</p>

<p>"How you comin'?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Great!" said I, still dizzy. "I'll lay this bird like a rug in
the next round! For honor and the love of a dame! 'Oh, the road to
glory lay&mdash; '"</p>

<p>"I've seen 'em knocked even more cuckoo," said the dip, tearing
off a cud of tobacco.</p>

<p>The fourth! Slade came up weakened, but with fire in his eye. I
was all right, but my legs wouldn't work like they should. Slade
was in far better condition. Seeing this, or probably feeling that
he was weakening, he threw caution to the winds and rushed in to
slug with me.</p>

<p>The crowd went crazy. Left-right-left-right! I was taking four
to one, but mine carried the most steam. It couldn't last long at
this rate.</p>

<p>The oily bird was yelling advice and dashing about the pit's
edge like a lunatic. We went into a clinch, and he leaned over to
prod us apart as usual. He leaned far over, and I don't know if he
slipped or somebody shoved him. Anyway, he crashed down on top of
us just as we broke and started slugging. He fell between us,
stopped somebody's right with his chin, and flopped, face
down&mdash;through for the night!</p>

<p>By mutual consent, Bat and me suspended hostilities, grabbed the
fallen referee by his neck and the slack of his pants, and hove him
up into the crowd. Then, without a word, we began again. The end
was in sight.</p>

<p>Bat suddenly broke and backed away. I followed, swinging with
both hands. Now I saw the wall was at his back. Ha! He couldn't
duck now! I shot my right straight for his face. He dropped to his
knees. Wham! My fist just cleared the top of his skull and crashed
against the concrete wall.</p>

<p>I heard the bones shatter and a dark tide of agony surged up my
arm, which dropped helpless at my side. Slade was up and springing
for me, but the torture I was in made me forget all about him. I
was nauseated, done up&mdash;out on my feet, if you get what I
mean. He swung his left with everything he had&mdash;my foot
slipped in some blood on the floor&mdash; his left landed high on
the side of my skull instead of my jaw. I went down, but I heard
him squawk and looked up to see him dancing and wringing his left
hand.</p>

<p>The knockdown had cleared my brain somewhat. My hand was numb
and not hurting so much, and I realized that Bat had broke his left
hand on my skull like many a man has did. Fair enough! I came
surging up, and Bat, with the light of desperation in his eyes,
rushed in wide open, staking everything on one right swing.</p>

<p>I stepped inside it, sank my left to the wrist in his midriff,
and brought the same hand up to his jaw. He staggered, his arms
fell, and I swung my left flush to the button with everything I had
behind it. Bat hit the floor.</p>

<p>About eight men shoved their snoots over the edge and started
counting, the oily bird being still out. They wasn't all counting
together, so somehow I managed to prop myself up against the wall,
not wanting to make no mistake, until the last man had said "ten!"
Then everything began to whirl, and I flopped down on top of Slade
and went out like a candle.</p>

<p>Let's pass over the immediate events. I don't remember much
about them anyhow. I slept until the middle of the next afternoon,
and I know the only thing that dragged me out of the bed where the
dip had dumped me was the knowledge that the <i>Sea Girl</i> sailed
that night and that Raquel La Costa probably would be waiting for
the victor&mdash;me.</p>

<p>Outside the joint where I first met her, who should I come upon
but Bat Slade!</p>

<p>"Huh!" says I, giving him the once over. "Are you able to be
out?"</p>

<p>"You ain't no beauty yourself," he retorted.</p>

<p>I admit it. My right was in a sling, both eyes was black, and I
was generally cut and bruised. Still, Slade had no right to give
himself airs. His left was all bandaged, he too had a black eye,
and moreover his features was about as battered as mine. I hope it
hurt him as much to move as it did me. But he had the edge on me in
one way&mdash;he hadn't rubbed as much hide off against the
walls.</p>

<p>"Where's that two hundred we bet?" I snarled.</p>

<p>"Heh, heh!" sneered he. "Try and get it! They told me I wasn't
counted out officially. The referee didn't count me out. You didn't
whip me."</p>

<p>"Let the money go, you dirty, yellow crook," I snarled, "but I
whipped you, and I can prove it by thirty men. What you doin' here,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"I come to see my girl."</p>

<p>"Your girl? What was we fightin' about last night?"</p>

<p>"Just because you had the sap's luck to knock me stiff don't
mean Raquel chooses you," he answered savagely. "This time, she
names the man she likes, see? And when she does, I want you to get
out!"</p>

<p>"All right," I snarled. "I whipped you fair and can prove it.
Come in here; she'll get a chance to choose between us, and if she
don't pick the best man, why, I can whip you all over again. Come
on, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Saying no more, we kicked the door open and went on in. We swept
the interior with a eagle glance, and then sighted Raquel sitting
at a table, leaning on her elbows and gazing soulfully into the
eyes of a handsome bird in the uniform of a Spanish naval
officer.</p>

<p>We barged across the room and come to a halt at her table. She
glanced up in some surprise, but she could not have been blamed had
she failed to recognize us.</p>

<p>"Raquel," said I, "we went forth and fought for your fair hand
just like you said. As might be expected, I won. Still, this
incomprehensible bezark thinks that you might still have some
lurkin' fondness for him, and he requires to hear from your own
rosy lips that you love another&mdash; meanin' me, of course. Say
the word and I toss him out. My ship sails tonight, and I got a lot
to say to you."</p>

<p>"Santa Maria!" said Raquel. "What ees theese? What kind of a
bizness is theese, you two tramps coming looking like theese and
talking gibberish? Am I to blame eef two great tramps go pound each
other's maps, ha? What ees that to me?"</p>

<p>"But you said&mdash;" I began, completely at sea, "you said, go
fight and the best man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say, may the best man win! Bah! Did I geeve any promise? What
do I care about Yankee tramps what make the fist-fight? Bah! Go
home and beefsteak the eye. You insult me, talking to me in public
with the punch' nose and bung' up face."</p>

<p>"Then you don't love either of us?" said Bat.</p>

<p>"Me love two gorillas? Bah! Here is my man&mdash;Don Jose y
Balsa Santa Maria Gonzales."</p>

<p>She then gave a screech, for at that moment Bat and me hit Don
Jose y Balsa Santa Maria Gonzales simultaneous, him with the right
and me with the left. And then, turning our backs on the dumfounded
Raquel, we linked arms and, stepping over the fallen lover, strode
haughtily to the door and vanished from her life.</p>

<p>"And that," said I, as we leaned upon the bar to which we had
made our mutual and unspoke agreement, "ends our romance, and the
glory road leads only to disappointment and hokum."</p>

<p>"Women," said Bat gloomily, "are the bunk."</p>

<p>"Listen," said I, remembering something, "how about that two
hundred you owe me?"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"For knockin' you cold."</p>

<p>"Steve," said Bat, laying his hand on my shoulder in brotherly
fashion, "you know I been intendin' to pay you that all along.
After all, Steve, we are seamen together, and we have just been did
dirt by a woman of another race. We are both American sailors, even
if you are a harp, and we got to stand by each other. Let bygones
be bygones, says I. The fortunes of war, you know. We fought a
fair, clean fight, and you was lucky enough to win. Let's have one
more drink and then part in peace an' amity."</p>

<p>"You ain't holdin' no grudge account of me layin' you out?" I
asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Steve," said Bat, waxing oratorical, "all men is brothers, and
the fact that you was lucky enough to crown me don't alter my
admiration and affection. Tomorrow we will be sailin' the high
seas, many miles apart. Let our thoughts of each other be gentle
and fraternal. Let us forgit old feuds and old differences. Let
this be the dawn of a new age of brotherly affection and square
dealin'."</p>

<p>"And how about my two hundred?"</p>

<p>"Steve, you know I am always broke at the end of my shore leave.
I give you my word I'll pay you them two hundred smackers. Ain't
the word of a comrade enough? Now le's drink to our future
friendship and the amicable relations of the crews of our
respective ships. Steve, here's my hand! Let this here shake be a
symbol of our friendship. May no women ever come between us again!
Good-bye, Steve! Good luck! Good luck!"</p>

<p>And so saying, we shook and turned away. That is, I turned and
then whirled back as quick as I could&mdash;just in time to duck
the right swing he'd started the minute my back was turned, and to
knock him cold with a bottle I snatched off the bar.</p>
