<h1><b>Woman&rsquo;s Place in the Commonwealth</b></h1>
<p align="center" class="author"><b>Catherine  Helen Spence</b></p>


<p align="center" class="note"><i>First printed in &quot;United Australia Quarterly&quot; Volume 2, 1900 </i></p>
<p align="center" class="note">&nbsp;</p>
<p>SIXTY years ago, a little barque  sailed from Greenock, in Scotland, to Australia. Of the 180 passengers, some  landed at Adelaide, some at Melbourne, and the rest at Sydney. I believe that  many rose to wealth and position. In South Australia two were members of  Ministries, and of these one was long President of the Legislative Council.</p>
<p>It was my good fortune to land at  Adelaide, in the province where women have taken a larger share in public affairs  than in any other colony in the island continent, and it has consequently been  my privilege to aid in building up a Federated Commonwealth.</p>
<p>I was even bold enough to stand  as a candidate for the Federal Convention. South Australia had been the first  community to give the municipal vote to women rate-payers, and in 1894 it had  admitted women to full rights of political citizenship, so that there might  well have been one representative woman among her ten delegates. It was also a  good advertisement for the electoral reform which I have advocated by pen and  voice for forty years if I stood or fell on the single issue of Effective  Voting for Federated Australia. I need not say that I was not elected by the  Block vote. It is not easy to get new blood or new ideas into any Parliament by  that discredited method.</p>
<p>The grand democratic basis of the  Commonwealth constitution of &ldquo;one man one vote,&rdquo; needs to be expanded into &ldquo;one  adult one vote,&rdquo; and &ldquo;one vote one value,&rdquo; to make our Senate and our House of  Representatives a model to the civilized world. All over the world  representative institutions are on their trial, and the fears of the timid as  to the encroachments of democracy, can only be allayed by &ldquo;more democracy.&rdquo;  While half of the human race is shut out from public activities, no one can  call the government really democratic. While large and intelligent minorities  are by means of defective machinery disfranchised, democracy is deprived of its  saving salt, of its boldly progressive as well as its wisely conservative  elements.</p>
<p>In the Federal outlook, will not  the South Australian leaven work on the rest of the Commonwealth, especially as  the trend of popular feeling is in favour of the political enfranchisement of  women? The Upper Houses, which opposed &ldquo;one man one vote,&rdquo; have opposed more  strongly the admission of women to political rights. The election of the first  Commonwealth Parliament is a more important event than any that has ever taken  place in Australia&mdash;more important than any subsequent election for this great  legislative body can be; so it is no wonder that all the earnest, thoughtful  women in Australia and Tasmania redouble their efforts for the suffrage, so  that they make their influence felt here, and now, even if they fail wholly or  in part. The Federal constitution has been more liberal than most of the  colonies, and to the larger and grander legislature the claim of women will  appeal with every hope of success.</p>
<p>We have heard much of the Pilgrim  Fathers, but nothing of the Pilgrim Mothers in the United States. It was the  custom of our ancestors to accept the services and the sacrifices of their  womenfolk as a matter of course. But here, in the nineteenth century, in the  life time of many of us, the wilderness has been reclaimed; great cities have been  built, governments have been established, new lights have fallen upon old  traditions inherited from our forefathers, and here, under the Southern Cross,  a great Commonwealth has been organised through peaceful evolution.</p>
<p>In the clearer light of modern thought  men see and acknowledge that women have borne their share of the hardships and  the labours of these new colonies, and this is why New Zealand and South  Australia, when emigration was mainly of families, have given full political  rights to women. Four of the newer States in America have also enlisted woman&rsquo;s  practical common sense and moral influence through the ballot-box, into their  local legislatures. The opposition to woman&rsquo;s suffrage in other more populous  and older States comes from the politicians, who dread the entrance of a vast  number of voters not so manageable for party purposes as men. All the weight of  the drink and gambling interests is brought to bear against the admission of  women to the suffrage, both in England and America; but the anomaly is greatest  in America, because the social influence of women is incomparably strongest  there.</p>
<p>They have invaded every avocation  and profession, not in dozens, but in hundreds and thousands. They have shown  powers of public speaking and organization and united action that have  astonished the world. Women&rsquo;s clubs are more numerous than men&rsquo;s, and embrace a  greater variety of objects, and withal they continue to be the most charming  women in the world. But the wire-pullers and the professional politicians deny  votes to them, while they give them to ignorant foreigners who are more  amenable to party ends and party discipline.</p>
<p>As for the result of granting the  suffrage in South Australia, I never thought that this would transform politics  and moralise politicians at once. The educational effect on both men and women  is good, and it will have increasing influence as experience goes on as a rule,  the newly enfranchised women have voted on the same lines as their husbands and  fathers; but there are exceptions, and so far as I have been able to ascertain,  these exceptions cause no quarrels or bitterness. Men allow their wives to go  to the churches to which they conscientiously adhere, and the far less  important matter of politics is looked on in the same way. I could not say that  any special candidate has been returned by the women&rsquo;s vote, who would not have  been elected without it; but the attitude of candidates and Members of  Parliament towards all questions affecting women and children has been very  much changed now that so great a voting strength lies in the hands of women.</p>
<p>As for influence, that subtle  thing which we are told is so much better for us and for the world than actual  responsible power that has by no means diminished; on the contrary, it has  increased. Husbands, sons, and brothers respect the opinions of wives, mothers,  and sisters far more when these can be backed by votes. Women attend political  meetings in considerable numbers, and put questions to the candidates. Their  presence is felt to be a restraining and moralising influence, even by the  rowdy. As for election day, when once in three years or so, women go to the  polling booth, it is so quiet and orderly that it feels like going to church.  Our elections have always been orderly since we, first of all the colonies&mdash;first,  indeed, in all the world&rsquo;s&mdash;introduced the secret ballot, known in the United  States as the Australian ballot. George Grote, the Historian of Greece, year  after year in his place in Parliament, moved for a secret ballot, and was  called an un-English faddist for his pains; and it is interesting to note that  the first realization of his idea was carried out in South Australia, of which  he was one of the founders; and one of the chief streets of Adelaide bears his  name.</p>
<p>I believe the results in New  Zealand have been similar to the results here, but of that I cannot speak from  personal knowledge. The educational value of the suffrage may be seen here  after five years&rsquo; experience. There is far more interest felt in public  questions, in the character of public men, in questions of public policy, of  loan and expenditure, by the average woman of South Australia than in the other  colonies. These have become part of her business; with the suffrage comes the  responsibility. Frivolous women there are, as well as indifferent and apathetic  men, but the atmosphere is more stimulating to both when equal rights have been  gained.</p>
<p>In the establishment of a Federal  magazine to take broad views of all political and social questions, I hope that  there will be a thorough discussion of this large subject, as well as some  scope for those women from all of the colonies, who love Australia and seek her  best interests, to contribute to its pages. A one-sexed society such as men  have in clubs, and women at afternoon calls, is incomplete and unsatisfactory;  and a one-sexed Federal magazine will not be adequately representative of  Australia.</p>
