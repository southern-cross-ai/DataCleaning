  <p align="center" class="note">An Unconventional Sketch</p>
  <p align="center" class="note">By J.G.L.</p>
  <p>Henry Hertzberg Lawson, one of Australia&rsquo;s most popular poets, was
    born at Grenfell, N.S.W., on June 17th, 1867. His early life was spent on
    the home farm, where he got his first taste of the bitter experiences which
    so often follow the footsteps of the man on the land. Hardships and pinchings
    were much more frequent than bumper harvests or big successes. Of luxury
    or pleasure Lawson knew little or nothing. He was forced to fight every inch
    of his way. &ldquo;Cockie&rdquo; farming is not the easiest of livelihoods.
    Only the true sons of toil who plod on through year after year of drought
    and failure, ever striving to hold the bit of a home together, make of it
    anything like a success. Of those early days Lawson does not say over much.
    He would rather forget them. Still it is possible to catch many a glimpse
    of the poet&rsquo;s home-life from his work. His verses tell the story more
    forcefully than his tongue. Lawson&rsquo;s strength lies not in autobiography.
    When he lifts the pen to picture either bush or city conditions he seldom
    errs. His experience of both is full and varied.</p>
  <p>He &ldquo;gets there&rdquo; every time with words that ring true, because
    they are freighted with stern, hard facts.</p>
  <p>Listen to him when he tells you &ldquo;How the Land was Won,&rdquo; and
    in the telling drops in a bit of autobiography&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;They toiled and they fought through the shame
      of it&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through wilderness, flood, and drought;<br>
  They worked, in the struggles of early days,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sons&rsquo; salvation out.<br>
  The white girl-wife in the hut alone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men on the boundless run,<br>
The miseries suffered, unvoiced, unknown&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&rsquo;s how the land was won.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center" class="note">&mdash;<i>Verses Popular and Humorous</i>.</p>
  <p>No man knows this sort of life intuitively. He must live it. No one need
    ever doubt that Henry Lawson went right through the mill. For better or for
    worse he took the gruelling like a man.</p>
  <p>Leaving the farm, Henry Lawson learnt carriage painting. What sort of a
    hand he was with the brush I cannot say. It is not often that the poetic
    temperament can be persuaded to successfully master the uninteresting trade
    accomplishments.</p>
  <p>How and when he began to write, and with what measure of success his work
    was received by the editors to whom the first lines were sent is another
    matter on which I have no statement to make. Lawson will tell you all this
    himself one of these days. He has it written and ready. When the right day
    comes the manuscript will be carefully edited and be given to the world in
    book form.</p>
  <p>During 1887 Lawson began his connection with the &ldquo;<i>Bulletin</i>.&rdquo; It
    was then that he found the audience he desired. Editor and readers alike
    were not slow to recognise the strength and ability of the new comer. Here
    was a man of merit to whom they might reasonably look for something above
    the average. And Australia did not look to Henry Lawson in vain, for during
    the winter of 1888 he gave us his true and powerful &ldquo;Faces in the Street,&rdquo; which
    will live for a long time among the very best things done by an Australian
    hand. If you have not read this poem do so at the earliest opportunity. It
    is a fine piece of work, full of literary ability and heart. Lawson, at twenty
    years of age, could see and feel. If there is any heart in you this great
    poem will find it.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;They lie, the men who tell us in a loud decisive
      tone<br>
  That want is here a stranger, and that misery&rsquo;s unknown;<br>
  For where the nearest suburb and the city proper meet<br>
  My window-sill is level with the faces in the street&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting past, drifting past,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beat of weary feet&mdash;<br>
  While I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.</p>
  <p class="note">And cause I have to sorrow, in a land so young and fair,<br>
  To see upon those faces stamped the marks of want and care;<br>
  I look in vain for traces of the fresh and fair and sweet,<br>
  In sallow sunken faces that are drifting through the street&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting on, drifting on,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the scrape of restless feet;<br>
  I can sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.</p>
  <p class="note">In hours before the dawning dims the starlight in the sky,<br>
  The wan and weary faces first begin to trickle by,<br>
  Increasing as the moments hurry on with moving feet,<br>
  Till, like a pallid river, flow the faces in the street&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowing in, flowing in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beat of hurried feet&mdash;<br>
  Ah! I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.</p>
  <p align="center" class="note">&mdash;<i>In the Days when the World was Wide</i>.</p>
  <p>These verses will give you some idea of the work which finds a place of
    honour in &ldquo;In the Days when the World was wide,&rdquo; the earliest
    of the volumes which carry Henry Lawson&rsquo;s name. This book was published
    in 1896, by which time he had a big following, and was rapidly rising into
    favour. The title poem of the volume mentioned above, which is replete with
    forceful stanzas that are known throughout Australia, had placed Henry Lawson
    among the first of our poets. Here are a few verses of this&nbsp;great poem&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas honest metal and honest wood&mdash;in
      the days of the Outward bound&mdash;<br>
  When men were gallant and ships were good&mdash;roaming the wide world round.<br>
  The gods could envy a leader then, when &lsquo;Follow me, lads!&rsquo; he
    cried&mdash;<br>
  They faced each other and fought like men in the days when the world was
  wide.</p>
  <p class="note">They tried to live as a freeman should&mdash;they were
      happier men than we,<br>
  In the glorious days of wine and blood, when Liberty crossed the sea;<br>
&rsquo;Twas a comrade true or a foeman then, and a trusty sword well tried&mdash;<br>
They faced each other and fought like men in the days when the world was
    wide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center" class="note">&mdash;<i>In the Days when the World was Wide</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Faces in the Street&rdquo; Henry Lawson claims to be his masterpiece.
    Only very recently did he tell me that he was under twenty years of age when
    he wrote this, his best, poem. I distinctly remember him mentioning the name.</p>
  <p>It was in 1896 that I first met Lawson. At this time he and&nbsp;Mr.
      Le Gay Brereton&nbsp;were engaged putting the finishing touches on &ldquo;In
      the Days when the World was Wide,&rdquo; which Messrs. Angus and Robertson
      then had in the press. They were working in a back store with galley and
      page proofs all over a long table, and seemed not to take matters very
      seriously. It was in that same old store room that Lawson wrote &ldquo;To
      an Old Mate,&rdquo; the introductory poem to his first volume.</p>
  <p class="note">You will find in these pages a trace of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That side of our past which was bright,<br>
  And recognise sometimes the face of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend who has dropped out of sight&mdash;<br>
  I send them along in the place of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letters I promised to write.</p>
  <p align="center" class="note">&mdash;<i>In the Days when the World was Wide</i>.</p>
  <p>This is Lawson all over.</p>
  <p>He is so human. Indeed, he has too much heart. What Lawson suffers through
    that poetic temperament of his no one but himself can ever fully know. He
    sees and feels more keenly than you or I can ever hope to do, and through
    his eyes and his heart he has added materially to the literature of his native
    land.</p>
  <p>There are many people who say they cannot see anything in Henry Lawson&rsquo;s
    work. There are always people who find it so much easier to criticise than
    to praise. Anyone can criticise; very few know just how to express their
    approval of what they see or read.</p>
  <p>Then there is a strong opposition among a certain class to anything Australian. &ldquo;We
    live in Australia; give us something that does not smell of the bush,&rdquo; is
    frequently heard. And this, too, from people who should know better. It is
    a good thing that Henry Lawson began his life in the bush. Had he spent his
    early days in the heart of any of our capitals, he might never have written
    a line worth reading. His work is a standing rebuke to those who see no good
    in their own country. Not even his worst enemy could ever say that Henry
    Lawson has gone back on Australia. He has placed the nation under an obligation
    which can never be fully paid. He is a man in a million, sent to speak to
    us of things that our own half-blind eyes fail to see. And how he has spoken!
    Ever since 1887, when he first got a footing in the &ldquo;<i>Bulletin</i>,&rdquo; he
    has written hard. Now and then he shoots wide of the target, but he generally &ldquo;gets
    home&rdquo; with a clinking &ldquo;bully.&rdquo; He many a time phrases a
    thing in rather an ugly way. That cannot be helped. Eyes are not all focussed
    alike. Nor are all hearts tuned to the same key. Henry Lawson is fearless
    and outspoken to a degree which many dislike. Yet it is a good thing that
    there are men of his stamp in the world. If there were not, many a wrong
    would go unrighted. In &ldquo;The Writer&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; (<i>Verses
    Popular and Humorous</i>) he says:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;I was born to write of the things that are! and the strength was
    given to me;<br>
  &lsquo;I was born to strike at the things that mar the world as the world should
  be!<br>
  &lsquo;By the dumb heart-hunger and dreams of youth, by the hungry tracks I&rsquo;ve
  trod&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fight as a man for the sake of truth, nor pose as a martyred
  god.<br>
  &lsquo;By the heart of &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; and the heart of &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; and
  the men that their hearts deem &ldquo;white,&rdquo;<br>
  &lsquo;By the handgrips fierce, and the hard eyes dim with forbidden tears!<br>
  &mdash;I&rsquo;ll write!</p>
  <p>And the men of the back country do stand by him. They are his audience and
    his friends at the same time. Henry Lawson, the man who &ldquo;humped bluey&rdquo; with
    them, is always sure of a warm reception. He is the bushman&rsquo;s poet
    every time. The &ldquo;back blocker&rdquo; appreciates his work better than
    I do.</p>
  <p>I can tell you a queer incident that will go to show the feeling which exists
    in the minds of some of the men who follow his work very closely. Lawson
    was taking a &ldquo;refresher&rdquo; or two on North Sydney one night, and
    got his tongue loosened. More than likely he started, as he often does when
    he gets a little &ldquo;jolly,&rdquo; to roll off &ldquo;The Ballad of the
    Rouseabout,&rdquo; or something of the kind, which one of his audience recognised.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did you learn that?&rdquo; the listener asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wrote it,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A nice chance you&rsquo;ve got of writing anything like that. That&rsquo;s
    Lawson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Lawson &mdash; Henry Lawson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You lie! Lawson&rsquo;s a &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and with this the
    men came to blows, the poet defending his own name, and his admirer hitting
    out in defence of the writer he admired.</p>
  <p>Being a poet, then, is not all joy, especially when one has to do battle
    for his own name.</p>
  <p>Reverting to the ballad quoted above, I find a passage which holds a lot
    of truth. Poets, Australian poets in particular, have a way of making their
    creations tell rather much of their own history. Henry Lawson is no exception
    to the rule. Of course, it may just happen that there is not the slightest
    connection between the writer and his rouseabout.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;A rouseabout of rouseabouts, above&mdash;beneath
      regard,<br>
  I know how soft is this old world, and I have learnt how hard&mdash;<br>
  A rouseabout of rouseabouts&mdash;I know what men can feel,<br>
  I&rsquo;ve seen the tears from hard eyes slip as drops from polished steel.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;We hold him true who&rsquo;s true to one however
      false he be<br>
  (There&rsquo;s something wrong with every ship that lies beside the quay);<br>
  We lend and borrow, laugh and joke, and when the past is drowned,<br>
  We sit upon our swags and smoke and watch the world go round.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center" class="note">&mdash;<i>Verses Popular and Humorous</i>.</p>
  <p>You would like to know how Henry Lawson works? Very fast. He is one of the
    quickest writers in Australia, and one of the surest. There is no fiddling
    with every second or third line. Once he sits down to write, his thoughts
    fly too fast for his pen. There is no striving for rhymes. He finishes verse
    after verse in one writing. Once he makes a beginning, he invariably goes
    through to the end.</p>
  <p>On one occasion I asked Lawson to write me an ode to an old gum tree. He
    said he would. Several days after he came to me saying, &ldquo;I can do that
    poem for you now, and I&rsquo;ll call it &lsquo;The Stringy-Bark Tree.&rsquo; &rdquo; &ldquo;Right,
    Henry,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;start now.&rdquo; Getting pencil and paper
    he made himself an impromptu desk in the yard at Angus &amp; Robertson&rsquo;s,
    and wrote the following verses, which were first published in &ldquo;<i>The
    Amateur Gardener</i>&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whitebox and pine on the ridges
      afar,<br>
  Where the ironbark, bluegum, and peppermint are;<br>
  There is many another, but dearest to me,<br>
  And the king of them all was the stringy-bark tree.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Then of stringy-bark slabs were the walls of the
      hut,<br>
  And from stringy-bark saplings the rafters were cut;<br>
  And the roof that long sheltered my brothers and me<br>
  Was of broad sheets of bark from the stringy-bark tree.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Now still from the ridges, by ways that are dark,<br>
  Come the shingles and palings they call stringy-bark;<br>
  Though you ride through long gullies a twelve months you&rsquo;ll see<br>
  But the old whitened stumps of the stringy-bark tree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center" class="note">&mdash;<i>When I was King, and Other Verses</i>.</p>
  <p>It is not one man in a million who can see as much in the old stringybarks
    which Lawson has turned to such good account. Many of us rather discount
    the value of these trees. Gums are too common for us. Or is it that we have
    little or no poetry in our &ldquo;mind&rsquo;s eye?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On another occasion to test his memory I asked him to give me a duplicate
    copy of a fairly long thing I had purchased for publication in the &ldquo;<i>Amateur
    Gardener</i>.&rdquo; At first he said he could not possibly do what I asked. &ldquo;Where
    did you lose it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You know how much I liked that poem.
    You are always losing something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thinking for a minute, he asked me two questions. They were&mdash;&ldquo;Can
    you give me the first line?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Have you got half-a-dollar?&rdquo; Answering
    both questions in the affirmative, a bargain was struck, and Henry went to
    work. It was not long before he had re-written, word for word, the whole
    poem. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, as he pocketed the half-crown with a smile, &ldquo;you
    just be more careful in future, or I&rsquo;ll raise my fees.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Henry Lawson&rsquo;s work is no trouble to him. It is all inspiration. When
    he burns the &ldquo;midnight&rdquo; oil it is to unburden his mind of something
    that has been haunting him for days.</p>
  <p>Directly after the last verse, you have two examples of Henry Lawson&rsquo;s
    handwriting. The bolder hand was done in 1905, and the smaller writing during
    1909.</p>
  <p>Speaking about estimating the value of a poet&rsquo;s work (and it is on
    this point that I wish to say something to those who criticise Henry Lawson),
    Frederick Harrison says:&mdash;In our estimate of poetry we must avoid the
    reckoning up of blunders such as examiners score with blue pencil and use
    to subtract marks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We have to take into account the
    sum of truly fine things, the permanent harvest of beauty, power, and insight
    contained in them, of a kind which is independent of place, time, and fashion.
    And in weighing it in this measure we have to admit that uniform grace and
    polish do not constitute in themselves a claim to the highest rank of poetry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    In the Day of Judgment, they tell us, gross offences may be forgiven for
    the sake of transcendent merits, which will outweigh a long life of decorous
    virtue such as needs no expiation.</p>
  <p>If the critics will bear these facts in mind they will do better work. Some
    of them may even be inclined to forget that they are judges of poetry.</p>
  <p>But what does it matter whether a man here and there thinks that Henry Lawson,
    or any other writer, is past his prime? The final court of appeal after all
    is the &ldquo;man in the street,&rdquo; or the man in the bush. What he fancies
    he will have. Your recommendations or mine he takes but little notice of.
    It is enough for him to know that his favourite wrote the poem he is doing
    his best to commit to memory. Against this sort of thing criticisms do not
    count.</p>
  <p>Lawson&rsquo;s fame is firmly rooted. His popularity must increase. To-day
    he belongs to Australia. Some day he will be known the whole world round.
    His work is too human to be soon forgotten. He has written whole-souledly
    of things which men and women know to be true. He has given us quite a big
    sheaf, in which there are many ears full of golden grain. He has pictured
    the hard working men and women as few other pens have ever done. But unfortunately
    Australia does not appreciate him as she ought. You can help to remedy this.
    Let this small volume, and this hastily written and very imperfect introduction,
    set you thinking how best you can help to bring Henry Lawson into his own.
    He deserves the best we can give him. His work is a national one. He has
    done it well. The more I read of him, the more I like him. His follies and
    his failings notwithstanding, I think Henry Lawson&rsquo;s books of poems
    should be in every home in the Commonwealth. Men and women who wish to know
    what is still happening in their own land will find much that is strong,
    and not a little that is wonderfully sweet in its weakness, in the verses
    which have placed Henry Lawson at the head of our truly Australian Poets.</p>
  <p>A verse or two from &ldquo;The Last Review&rdquo; and I have finished:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Turn the light down, nurse, and leave me, while
      I hold my last review.<br>
  For the bush is slipping from me, and the town is going, too;<br>
  Draw the blinds, the streets are lighted, and I hear the tramp of feet&mdash;<br>
  And I&rsquo;m weary, very weary, of the Faces in the Street.</p>
  <p class="note">I was human, very human, and if in the days misspent<br>
  I have injured man or woman, it was done without intent;<br>
  If at times I blundered blindly&mdash;bitter heart and aching brow&mdash;<br>
  If I wrote a line unkindly&mdash;I am sorry for it now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center" class="note">&mdash;<i>When I was King, and Other Verses</i>.</p>
  <p>In closing, let me make one last appeal. Read your Lawson. If you do not
    like the sordid and the ugly, turn to the humorous things, and the clean
    things, of which there are many in the volumes published. You will never
    regret the time you spend in company with this versatile and powerful Australian.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the eye can see,<br>

    Hundreds of miles, in this land of mine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never a soldier seen.<br>
    The dying must die and the dead were left<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmarked by the deadly tired&mdash;<br>
    When struck to the heart in a firing line<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where never a shot was fired.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have flocked to the line since then<br>

    Proud of gold or of being without<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or proud of women and wine&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And into the firing line.</p>
  <p>Pride in poverty&mdash;all the same&mdash;<br>

    Where the soldier birds and farmers, and selectors never rest<br>
    While the sun shines&mdash;and they often work in rainy weather, too:<br>
    But it&rsquo;s all about a young man who had so much work to do.</p>
  <p>One of Mason&rsquo;s sons, Jim Mason, and the straightest of the lot,<br>
    (They were all straight for that matter) Jim was working for old Scott&mdash;<br>
    (Scott that fired at Brummy Hughson, when the &ldquo;stick-ups&rdquo; used
    to be),<br>
    Jim was courting Mary Kelly down at Lowes, at Wilbertree.</p>
  <p>Jim was trucking for a sawmill to make money for the home,<br>
    He was making, out of Mudgee, for the family to come,<br>
    And a load-chain snapped the switch-bar, and Black Anderson found Jim,<br>
    In the morning, in a creek-bed, with a log on top of him.</p>
  <p>There was riding for the doctor&mdash;just the same old reckless race:<br>
    And a spring cart with a mattress came and took him from the place,<br>
    To the hospital at Gulgong&mdash;but they couldn&rsquo;t pull him through&mdash;<br>
    And Jim said &ldquo;It seems a pity&mdash;I&mdash;had so much work to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the hut&mdash;it&rsquo;s close-up finished; and the
    forty acres fenced;<br>
    And&mdash;I&rsquo;ve cleared enough for ploughin&rsquo;, but the dam is just
    commenced!&rdquo;<br>
    Then he said&mdash;and for a moment from the nurse his eyes he hid&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad we wasn&rsquo;t married, for there might have been
  a kid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was all&mdash;at least it wasn&rsquo;t for he didn&rsquo;t die until<br>
    He had &ldquo;fixed it up for Mary with a proper lawyer will,&rdquo;<br>
    And the &ldquo;Forty acre paddick,&rdquo; &ldquo;And I only hope,&rdquo; said
    he,<br>
  &ldquo;That she&rsquo;ll get some decent feller when she&rsquo;s quite got
  over me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Poor old broken-hearted Mason and his &ldquo;missus&rdquo; took their spell,<br>
    But another son and Mary finished Jim&rsquo;s work very well.<br>
    They have grown-up sons and daughters&mdash;some on new selections, too,<br>
    And their hands and hearts are fitted for the work they have to do.</p>

    should do.</p>

    We can write, and have it printed&mdash;They must suffer and be dumb.</p>

    No second wife yet wedded makes a man forget the first.</p>
  <p>Ah! the men who made bad matches think more often than we know,<br>
    Of the girls they should have married, in the glorious long ago,<br>
    And there&rsquo;s many a wife and mother thinks with bitter pain to-day,<br>
    Of her giddy, silly girlhood, and the man she sent away.</p>
  <p>Life is sad for men and women, but the thoughts are bitter sad<br>
    Of the girls we should have married, and the boys we should have had.<br>
    But we&rsquo;ll part now with a handshake, if we cannot with a kiss,<br>
    And bad matches may be mended in a better world than this.</p>

  <p>There&rsquo;s&nbsp;many a schoolboy&rsquo;s bat and ball that are gathering
    dust at home,<br>
    For he hears a voice in the future call, and he trains for the war to come;<br>
    A serious light in his eyes is seen as he comes from the schoolhouse gate;<br>
    He keeps his kit and his rifle clean, and he sees that his back is straight.</p>
  <p>But straight or crooked, or round, or lame&mdash;you may let these words
    take root;<br>
    As the time draws near for the sterner game,&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;boys should
    learn to shoot,<br>
    From the beardless youth to the grim grey-beard, let Australians ne&rsquo;er
    forget,<br>
    A lame limb never has interfered with a brave man&rsquo;s shooting yet.</p>
  <p>Over and over and over again, to you and our friends and me,<br>
    The warning of danger has sounded plain&mdash;like the thud of a gun at sea.<br>
    The rich man turns to his wine once more, and the gay to their worldly joys,<br>
    The &ldquo;statesman&rdquo; laughs at a hint of war&mdash;<i>but something
    has told the boys</i>.</p>
  <p>The schoolboy scouts of the White Man&rsquo;s Land are out on the hills
    today;<br>
    They trace the tracks from the sea-beach sand and sea-cliffs grim and grey;<br>
    They take the range for a likely shot by every cape and head,<br>
    And they spy the lay of each lonely spot where an enemy&rsquo;s foot might
    tread.</p>
  <p>In the cooling breeze of the coastal streams, or out where the townships
    bake,<br>
    They march in fancy, and fight in dreams, and die for Australia&rsquo;s sake.<br>
    They hold the fort till relief arrives, when the landing parties storm,<br>
    And they take the pride of their fresh young lives in the set of a uniform.</p>
  <p>Where never a loaded shell was hurled, nor a rifle fired to kill,<br>
    The schoolboy scouts of the Southern World are choosing their Battery Hill.<br>
    They run the tapes on the flats and fells by roads that the guns might sweep,<br>
    They are fixing in memory obstacles where the firing lines shall creep.</p>
  <p>They read and they study the gunnery&mdash;they&nbsp;<i>ask</i>&nbsp;till
    the meaning&rsquo;s plain,<br>
    But the craft of the scout is a simple thing to the young Australian brain.<br>
    They blaze the track for a forward run, where the scrub is everywhere,<br>
    And they mark positions for every gun and every unit there.</p>
  <p>They trace the track for a quick retreat&mdash;and the track for the other
    way round,<br>
    And they mark the spot in the summer heat where the water is always found.<br>
    They note the chances of cliff and tide, and where they can move, and when,<br>
    And every point where a man might hide in the days when they&rsquo;ll fight
    as men.</p>
  <p>When silent men with their rifles lie by many a ferny dell;<br>
    And turn their heads when a scout goes by, with a cheery growl &ldquo;All&rsquo;s
    well&rdquo;;<br>
    And scouts shall climb by the fisherman&rsquo;s ways, and watch for a sign
    of ships,<br>
    With stern eyes fixed on the threatening haze where the blue horizon dips.</p>
  <p>When men shall camp in the dark and damp by the bough-marked battery,<br>
    Between the forts and the open ports where the miners watch the sea;<br>
    And talk perhaps of their boy-scout days, as they sit in their shelters rude,<br>
    While motors race to the distant bays with ammunition and food.</p>
  <p>When the city alight shall wait by night for news from a far-out post,<br>
    And men ride down from the farming town to patrol the lonely coast&mdash;<br>
    Till they hear the thud of a distant gun, or the distant rifles crack,<br>
    And Australians spring to their arms as one to drive the invaders back.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;ll be no music or martial noise, save the guns to help you through,<br>
    For a plain and a shirt-sleeve job, my boys, is the job that we&rsquo;ll
    have to do.<br>
    And many of those who had learned to shoot&mdash;and in learning learned
    to teach&mdash;<br>
    To the last three men, and the last galoot, shall die on some lonely beach.</p>
  <p>But they&rsquo;ll waste their breath in no empty boast, and they&rsquo;ll
    prove to the world their worth,<br>
    When the shearers rush to the Eastern Coast, and the miners rush to Perth.<br>
    And the man who fights in a Queenscliff fort, or up by Keppel Bay,<br>
    Will know that his mates at Bunbury are doing their share that day.</p>
  <p>There was never a land so great and wide, where the foreign fathers came,<br>
    That has bred her children so much alike, with their hearts so much the same.<br>
    And sons shall fight by the mangrove creeks that lie on the lone East Coast,<br>
    Who never shall know (or not for weeks) if the rest of Australia&rsquo;s
    lost.</p>
  <p>And far in the future (I see it well, and born of such days as these),<br>
    There lies an Australia invincible, and mistress of all her seas;<br>
    With monuments standing on hill and head, where her sons shall point with
    pride<br>
    To the names of Australia&rsquo;s bravest dead, carved under the words &ldquo;Here
    died.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Now this&nbsp;is the song of a prison&mdash;a song of a gaol or jug&mdash;<br>
    A ballad of quod or of chokey, the ultimate home of the mug.<br>
    The yard where the Foolish are drafted; Hell&rsquo;s school where the harmless
    are taught;<br>
    For the big beast never is captured and the great thief never is caught.</p>
  <p>A song of the trollop&rsquo;s victim, and the dealer in doubtful eggs,<br>
    And a song of the man who was ruined by the lie with a thousand legs.<br>
    A song of suspected persons and rouge-and-vagabond pals,<br>
    And of persons beyond suspicion&mdash;the habitual criminals.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Tis a song of the weary warders, whom prisoners call &ldquo;the screws&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
    A class of men who I fancy would cleave to the &ldquo;Evening News.&rdquo;<br>
    They look after their treasures sadly. By the screw of their keys they are
    known,<br>
    And they screw them many times daily before they draw their own.</p>
  <p>It is written on paper pilfered from the prison printery,<br>
    With a stolen stump of a pencil that a felon smuggled for me.<br>
    And he&rsquo;d have got twenty-four hours in the cells if he had been caught,<br>
    With bread to eat and water to drink and plenty of food for thought.</p>
  <p>And I paid in chews of tobacco from one who is in for life;<br>
    But he is a decent fellow&mdash;he only murdered his wife.<br>
    (He is cherub-like, jolly, good-natured, and frank as the skies above,<br>
    And his Christian name is Joseph, and his other, ye gods! is Love!)</p>
  <p>The Governor knows, and the Deputy, and all of the warders know,<br>
    Once a week, and on Sunday, we sit in a sinful row,<br>
    And bargain for chews of tobacco under the cover of prayer&mdash;<br>
    And the harmless Anglican chaplain is the only innocent there.</p>
  <p>Staircase and doors of iron, no sign of a plank or brick,<br>
    Ceilings and floors of sandstone, and the cell walls two feet thick;<br>
    Cell like a large-sized coffin, or a small-sized tomb, and white,<br>
    And it strikes a chill to the backbone on the warmest summer night.</p>
  <p>For fifteen hours they leave you to brood in the gloom and cold<br>
    On the cheats that you should have cheated, and the lies that you should
      have told;<br>
    On the money that would release you, you lent to many a friend,<br>
    And the many a generous action you suffered for in the end.</p>
  <p>Grey daylight follows softly the heartless electric light<br>
    That printed the bars of the window on the wall of the cell all night<br>
    The darkness has vanished &ldquo;hushing&rdquo; when there is nothing to
    hush&mdash;<br>
    And I think of the old grey daylight on the teamster&rsquo;s camp in the
    bush.</p>
  <p>I think of the low bark homestead, the yard and the sinister bail,<br>
    And the shed in a hole in the gully&mdash;a pigsty compared with gaol;<br>
    The drought and the rows and the nagging; the hill where a flat grave is&mdash;<br>
    The gaol of my boyhood as dreadful and barren and grey as this.</p>
  <p>We rise at six when the bell rings, and roll up our blankets neat,<br>
    Then we pace the cell till seven, brain-dulled, and with leaden feet.<br>
    Bolts clank, and the iron doors open, light floods from an iron-barred arch&mdash;<br>
    And we start with a start galvanic at the passionless, &ldquo;Left&mdash;Quick
    march!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Down the crooked and winding staircase in the great wrong-angular well,<br>
    Like the crooked stairs that of late years we have stumbled down to Hell;<br>
    We empty the tubs and muster, with the prison slouch and tread,<br>
    And we take to the cells our breakfast of hominy and of bread.</p>
  <p>The church in its squat round tower, with Christ in His thorny wreath&mdash;<br>
    The reception house is below it, so the gates of Hell are beneath,<br>
    Where sinners are clad and numbered, when hope for a while has died&mdash; <br>
    And above us the gilded rooster that crowed when Peter lied.</p>
  <p>What avail is the prayer of the abbess? Or the raving of Cock-eyed Liz?<br>
    The holy hermit in his cell, or the Holy Terror in his?<br>
    Brothers and sisters of Heaven, seen through the bars in a wall,<br>
    As we see the uncaught sinners&mdash;and God have mercy on all.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="CaptainVonEssonoftheSebastopol"></a>Captain Von Esson of the &ldquo;Sebastopol&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p class="note">(&ldquo;Let me fire one shot for Russia, though that shot should be the
    last.&rdquo; That line happened in a rhyme I wrote for the &ldquo;<i>Bulletin</i>&rdquo; before
    the fall of Port Arthur. Strange to say, I was unaware of the incident of
    the &ldquo;<i>Sebastopol</i>&rdquo;  cruiser till I came across it the other
    day on a recent book on the siege.&mdash;H. L.)</p>
  <p>Of his&nbsp;beauty, or stature, or colour of hair I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest
    hint,<br>
    But he comes to me as a little man, with a scrubby beard and a squint,<br>
    With a heart somewhere if it wasn&rsquo;t there, and an Irish terrier nose,<br>
    With a bark or a yelp for his friends and his crew, and a bull-dog grip for
    his foes.</p>
  <p>The Japs had taken a permanent fort at the price of ten thousand sons,<br>
    And they shelled the ships in the harbour there with their landed naval guns.<br>
    Through sand bags laid on the upper deck, the shells went through with a
    whelt&mdash;<br>
    And some (because of ballistic curve) out under the armoured belt.</p>
  <p>Till each was sunk that the Russians left&mdash;while the buildings reeled
    with the shock,<br>
    Save the last of the Russian ships of war&mdash;the Sebastopol&mdash;in dock.<br>
    And this is the reason&mdash;told in a line&mdash;why there is a tale to
    tell:<br>
    The Sebastopol had a man for boss, and a crew that knew it well.</p>
  <p>He rousted them out from the dens ashore, and they didn&rsquo;t engage in
    prayer,<br>
    For dear men pray when the fight is done, and there wasn&rsquo;t a cheap
    man there.<br>
    He rooted the dock-hands out, when crouched, in deadly fear of the Jap,<br>
    But they stood in greater immediate fear of Von Esson&rsquo;s squint and
    his yap.</p>
  <p>She groped her way in the gathering dusk, out under the time-dulled din,<br>
    And nothing was heard save a whispered word, and the laugh of a Russian Finn.<br>
    He took her out from the harbour trap, where the shells came down like hail,<br>
    For a chance to fight for the Wrong or Right round under the &ldquo;Lizard&rsquo;s
    Tail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My fathers came from the North, my friends, when there was a world to win;<br>
    And something hints of the Northern Wolf in the laugh of a Russian Finn;<br>
    A sailor he was, with gorilla arms, and a mighty, hairy chest&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;T was a laugh of love for his captain man, and a laugh of hate for the
  rest.</p>
  <p>There is neither the time nor the space to tell of the deeds that those
    Russians did;<br>
    Three days on the toppling lid of hell, like an ill-made cauldron&rsquo;s
    lid.<br>
    The breathless pause ere the flashlight fell where the creeping foe was hid,<br>
    The blood-streaked decks, and the grunt or yell, when the stricken slipped
    and slid.</p>
  <p>The faces white in a sudden light, and the ghostly dying grin,<br>
    The great relief when the silence broke, and they revelled in Hell&rsquo;s
    own din.<br>
    The blinding flash and the stunning crash&mdash;strained ears&mdash;strained
    eyes&mdash;dry skin&mdash;<br>
    The short sharp yelp of that captain man, and&mdash;the laugh of the Russian
    Finn.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;T was not for Cause nor for Liberty, Religion, or Glory, or Land&mdash;<br>
    He fought for love of a captain man he could crush with his big right hand.<br>
    Till five torpedo boats round her lay, in the mud, the slush, and the ooze&mdash;<br>
    She sent them down for the Old Greek Church, with the whole of their monkey
    crews.</p>
  <p>But the last one gave her a last thrust home, and left by a friendly tide,<br>
    She lay like a man on his elbow raised, with a hand on her wounded side.<br>
    She was left to be called for later on, with a solid bank beneath&mdash;<br>
    The Japs were short of torpedo boats, and&mdash;they&rsquo;d had enough of
    her teeth.</p>
  <p>But, safe from the landed naval guns, and the last torpedo boat,<br>
    Von Esson worked with his squint and bark till he got his vessel afloat.<br>
    He&rsquo;d marked her a grave with his level eye where the open sea was fair,<br>
    And he steered her out to the deep water, and he grimly sank her there.</p>
  <p>(It&rsquo;s oh, for a chance when a man of men must live the living lie&mdash;<br>
    For a chance to live as a man might live, and die as a man might die!<br>
    When one is a slave to paltry things in a life that never can change,<br>
    It&rsquo;s oh! for a cause, and a decent gun, and a hundred rounds, and the
    range!)</p>
  <p>The boats slipped in in the gathering dusk, and under the time-dulled din,<br>
    And vanished from us to a yap of command, and the grunt of a Russian Finn.<br>
    But somewhere down in a seamen&rsquo;s den (maybe, perhaps within hail),<br>
    There&rsquo;s a drunken rabble of sailor men, and a Finn that tells a tale.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheHorseandCartFerry"></a>The Horse and Cart Ferry</b></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was&nbsp;old Jerry Brown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&rsquo;d an office in town,<br>
    And he used to get jocular, very;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he&rsquo;d go to the Shore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they&rsquo;d serve him no more,<br>
    And, of course, by the passenger ferry,<br>
    A sight on the passenger ferry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this is a song of the ferry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a lay of the juice of the berry;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis the ballad of Brown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&rsquo;d a business in town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And commenced to go down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very slow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you know?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By coming home just a bit merry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Drunks&rsquo;  Boat&mdash;that&rsquo;s right&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a Saturday night<br>
    He would often be past being merry;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his back teeth afloat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the twelve o&rsquo;clock boat,<br>
    And a spectacle there on the ferry<br>
    (A picture to all on the ferry).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mornings, ashamed&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas the last drink he blamed,<br>
    Though the first was the matter with Jerry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his nerve out of joint,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d sneak down to Blue&rsquo;s Point,<br>
    And he&rsquo;d cross by the horse-and-cart ferry,<br>
    Like a thief&mdash;by the horse-and-cart ferry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But long before night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d most likely be tight,<br>
    And a subject and theme for George Perry;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he&rsquo;d cross to the Shore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat worse than before,<br>
    And a nuisance to all on the ferry;<br>
    Singing-drunk on the passenger ferry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it went on<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till his reason seemed gone,<br>
    And the Law, so it seemed, got a derry<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Brown. He went down,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they sent him to town<br>
    One day, by &ldquo;the trap,&rdquo; on the ferry&mdash;<br>
    The Government trap on the ferry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was sober and sane<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came back again,<br>
    And the past he&rsquo;d determined to bury&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, I mean, live it down&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he crossed from the town<br>
    Like a man, on the passenger ferry.<br>
    (There were sceptical souls on that ferry.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say &rsquo;twas the jaw<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his mother-in-law<br>
    Drove him back to the juice of the berry;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he soon got afloat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the passenger boat<br>
    Or adrift on the horse-and-cart ferry<br>
    (Wrongly called the ve-hic-ular ferry).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drink had him fast,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he drank till at last<br>
    He dried up&mdash;a withered old cherry;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they thought him no loss<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they sent him across<br>
    In a box, on the cart-and-horse ferry&mdash;<br>
    In a low, covered trap on the ferry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which I rise to explain&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the moral ain&rsquo;t plain,<br>
    And if you&rsquo;re a cove that gets merry&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always stick, when &ldquo;afloat,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the passenger boat;<br>
    Or else to the cart-and-horse ferry,<br>
    Or you&rsquo;ll make matters worse, like old Jerry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the song of the ferry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lay of the juice of the berry;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you will not deny&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you read by-and-bye&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the casual eye<br>

    I have bequeathed the spirit to&nbsp;<i>fight</i>, I have given the&nbsp;<i>will</i>&nbsp;to
    rise,<br>
    And the slumbering fires of Hate and Love in their dreaming, dreaming eyes.<br>
    That the world shall know and my name shall glow in the light of the aftershine,<br>
    I have set the lines on my children&rsquo;s palms as my fathers did on mine.</p>
  <p>I have given the love for their native land, wherever that land may be<br>
    (My children came from the East, my friends, and round by the Northern Sea),<br>
    And a son of a son of mine enemy, to the end of his treacherous line,<br>
    Shall be stricken to earth, if he dare but speak, by a son of a son of mine.<br>
    That the world shall know and my name shall glow in the light of the aftershine,<br>
    I have set the lines on my children&rsquo;s palms as my fathers did on mine.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheKing"></a>The King</b></h2>
  <p>Among&nbsp;the sons of Englishmen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full many feel like real tears,<br>
    For, though he reigned but scarcely ten,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bore the burden many years.<br>
    He lived the dead past doubly down,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shamed, by manliness and truth,<br>
    The lies that beat about a crown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And round a known man in his youth.</p>
  <p>For he had lived as&nbsp;<i>men</i>&nbsp;have done<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Adam&rsquo;s time, to prove them true.<br>
    He proved it in his manhood&rsquo;s prime,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the end, as strong men do.<br>
    And so he died, and, ever since,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on through years the words shall ring:<br>
  &ldquo;He lived a man, he lived a prince,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And died a gentleman and King.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Unto the friends of his hot youth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his wise age, he still was true.<br>
    He showed, by steadfastness and truth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&nbsp;<i>kings</i>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<i>men</i>&nbsp;can
  do;<br>
    Till all was manlike or forgot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long years ere he found his release;<br>
    He made them loyal who were not,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He won respect, and kept the peace.</p>

  <p>Moonlight peoples Boyd Tower,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystic are its walls;<br>

  <p>O! he lay above us&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High above the surf&mdash;<br>
    Finger-nails and toe-caps<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digging in the turf.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Ben Boyd&rsquo;s Tower.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s an ancient dame in Eden&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basket on her arm&mdash;<br>
    And she goes down the Main Street<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the old, old farm.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hood drawn on her forehead&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withered dame and grey&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never looks on Boyd Tower<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out across the Bay.</p>
  <p>Bright eyes in the ballroom,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coquetting with two,<br>
    Just for love of mischief,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a girl will do.<br>
    A quarrel in the bar-room&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All within the hour&mdash;<br>
    And four men rode from Boyd Town<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Ben Boyd&rsquo;s Tower.</p>

  <p>We love the rose when our day is dead,<br>
